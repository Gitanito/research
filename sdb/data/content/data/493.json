Their names and addresses\nare given above.\nCONVERSAZIONE.\nA Conversazione was held for Members and Associates in the\nhouse of the Society on Wednesday, December 5th, 1928, from\n4 until 6 p.m. Tea was served from 4 until 4.45 p.m. After\ntea Dr. WooUey gave an account of some recent sittings he\nhad attended in Baron v. Schrenck-Notzing's laboratory.\nDr. Woolley began by explaining that, in response to a\nsuggestion made by Miss May Walker, Baron von Schrenck-\nNotzing had very kindly allowed four representatives of the\nSociety, Mrs. Brackenbury, Miss WaUier, Professor Dodds and\nhimself, to be present at the sittings held in his laboratory\nduring last September. They had hoped to take part in his\ninvestigation of the medium Oskar S., but, as reported in the\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie for October, this medium was\nexposed as fraudulent by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing on\n\fJanuaet, 1929 Conversazione S\nSeptember 1st, and these hopes were therefore disappointed.\nA number of sittings were held with the two Schneider brothers,\nWilli and Rudi, under a system of control devised by Baron\nvon Schrenck-Notzing, which has for its object the replacement\nas far as possible of the human element by certain electrical\ndevices. The present method has been in use since last June,\nand consists in the wearing by the medium and by the one\ncontroller of metal wire mittens, which close two independent\nelectric circuits when the controller holds the medium's hands.\nSimilarly made socks cover the medium's feet and close two\nother circuits when placed in contact with two metal plates\non the floor. Each circuit when closed lights up a numbered\nlamp placed above the \" cabinet.\" In addition to this the\nfloor of the cabinet is wholly covered by a board, which when\ntrodden on lights up a fifth lamp by the side of the others.\nThe last precaution has only recently been introduced to\nanswer the suggestion that phenomena might be due to the\npresence of a confederate concealed in the cabinet.\nIt was pointed out that this apparatus proves to all the\nsitters that each of the medium's mittens is in contact with\none of the controller's mittens, and that the fact that they\nare mittens and not gloves enables the controller to feel the\nmedium's hands as well. Further, the medium's mittens are\nsewn to his coat sleeves so that he cannot take them ofl^.\nThe arrangement excludes effectively the fraudulent use of\nthe meditu2i\"s hands. It does not, and probably no mechanical\ncontrol coidd, exclude deliberate fraud by the controller, a\ntheoretical possibility of which there was no question in these\nsittings.\nDr. WooUey gave a short description of some of the pheno-\nmena seen in the Willi sittings, the most interesting being\nwhat appeared to be bulging-out movements of the curtain\nforming the front of the cabinet behind him, and concluded\nby expressing the thanks of the Society to Miss Walker for\nhaving arranged for the sittings, and especially to Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing for his great kindness in allowing the Society's\nrepresentatives to take part in them.\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jandaey, 1929\nCASE.\nL. 1287. A Case of \" Travelling Clairvoyance.\n\"\nWe print below a case of the type usually known as \" travel-\nling clairvoyance.\" Other examples of the same kind of\nexperience will be found in Myers's Human Personality, vol. i.\npp. 553-59, and Mrs. Sidgwick's paper \" On the Evidence for\nClairvoyance,\" Proc. S.P.R., Vol. 7, pp. 30-99. The case has\ncome to us through Lord Charles Hope, a Member of this\nSociety, who is personally acquainted with the percipient,\nMonsieur David, a Frenchman living in London. Monsieur\nDavid's original account of his three experiences was enclosed\nwith a letter from Lord Charles Hope to Mrs. Sidgwick on\nJune 23rd, 1928. At that time Monsieur David had not\nhad an opportunity of visiting the places described in his two\nearlier experiences and verifying the descriptions himself.\nThis he was able to do in September last, and we print his\noriginal statements and the later verification. Of his third\nexperience, on February 4th, 1928, no verification has so far\nbeen obtainable, but it seems best to put the experience on\nrecord with the others.\nI.\n31s^ January, 1928.\nIn the course of a very enjoyable evening spent yesterday\n30th January in tlie company of Mr. Noel Jaquin, Dr. Braun,\nand two other friends, we discussed among other things certain\nphenomena relative to palmistry and psychics, and when I came\nhome at about 12.30 p.m. I went to bed immediately, but not\nfinding sleep at once I thought over the various topics we had\ndiscussed.\nOn the only previous occasion when I had met Mr. Noel Jaquin\nprior to last evening, he had promised to pay me a \" mind\nvisit \" and to send me a description of the room in which we\ngenerally foregather, but he had either forgotten his promise or\nhad not found the time to fulfil it, and the matter was not\nmentioned at all during the evening. It came back to my mind\nat that moment, however, and I wondered whether I could not\n\fJanuary, 1929 Case\nperhaps pay Jaquin the \" mind visit \" he had failed to pay me.\nI was then wide awake, and noticed my wife breathing asleep\nby my side\u2014also that a faint ray of light was creeping into\nthe room between the curtains\u2014but I kept my eyes closed and\nalmost immediately I saw a very distinct picture as follows :\nA row of shops on the left side of a street, these shops showing\nthe very distinct peculiarity that they were projecting several\nyards beyond the frontage of the house above, so that the first\nportion of the shops at least was covered by a flat roof, to\nwhich access could be gained by the first floor windows, and at\nthe side of one of the shops a door leading, presumably through\na passage, to the flats above. The street was dimly lighted.\nThere was no traffic about and I was particularly puzzled by the\nfact that I could see nothing whatever on the right side of\nthe street, which was a perfect blank. I tried repeatedly to\nsee the right side of the street but failed, while I kept on\nregistering the vivid picture of the door in the row of shops on\nthe left side of the street. I felt that I was in front of Jaquin's\nflat but experienced difiiculty in seeing beyond the door, and\nremembering certain phenomena which accompanied a \" mind call\n\"\nfrom Jaquin on one of his friends and which might possibly if\nthey repeated themselves with me frighten my wife, I did my\nbest to go to sleep and very soon lost consciousness.\nI must particularly place on record, that while I know, that\nMr. Jaquin lives in a flat at Palmers Green, I have never visited\nhim, have never had any account of the neighbourhood in which\nhe resides, and that I do not know his address and have never\nbeen in Palmers Green ; also that Palmers Green is 18 miles\naway from Twickenham. In fact I absolutely ignore whether\nMr. Jaquin's flat is in a business or in a residential neighbourhood.\nTo-day, at lunch, I have told my friend Mr. J. W. Miller of this\nvision, and I now consign the precise details to this sheet.\nA copy of the above document was sent by me to Mr. Noel\nJaquin whose exact address I found in the telephone directory, and\nhe informed me that my description of the exterior of his flat,\nthe projection of the shops on the left side of the street, and the\nother side being a perfect blank (big wall), [is correct in every\ndetail.\na2\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1929\nOctober Qth, 1928.\nIn order to verify the accuracy of my vision, I have been\nmyself to 37b Green Lanes, No. 13, the address of Mr. Jaquin,\nand found that the appearance of the building in which Mr.\nJaquin occupies a flat, corresponds exactly to my description, also\nthat exactly opposite the door which gives access to his flat,\nstands a wall with a garden behind it.\nrS^' - II.\n2nd Feburary, 1928.\nLast night (1st February), I went to bed at 12 p.m. and not\nfinding sleep at once, wondered perhaps if I could renew my\nexperiment of \" mind wandering \" and decided to pay Dr. Braun\na \" mind call.\"\nI closed my eyes, and after a very short time found myself\nin front of a garden protected by railings. I went down a gravel\npath between what seemed to be shrubberies and saw the entrance\nto \"a house.\" A flight of stone steps led to a porch and to a\ndoor painted in a rather \" vivid red \" or crimson colour. The\nporch seemed to be dimly lighted.\nI further noticed the peculiar feature that the porch was at\nthe \" extreme left \" of the house and as this seemed rather\nstrange to me\u2014I opened my eyes and made various observations\nto convince myself that I was not asleep and just then heard the\nclock strike one (probably 12.30). When I closed my eyes again\nI, at once, saw distinctly the same porch and the door which\nI could recognise owing to its special colour, and after some\ndifficulty I entered the hall.\nI noticed some light coming from nowhere and thought it\nprobably came from some opening in the wall on the left of\nthe hall\u2014overlooking a garden or conservatory, and at the further\nend of the hall a staircase\u2014presumably leading to the floors above,\nand\u2014an important detail\u2014winding from left to right\u2014also a\ndark recess between the staircase and the wall on the right of\nthe hall\u2014probably leading to a kitchen or a garden.\nOn the right, two doors leading into the drawing room at the\nback and the dining room in the front an opening between the\ndining room and drawing room, and a double window or door\nleading from the drawing room into the garden at the back.\n\fJanuary, 1929 Case 7\nI could only dimly see the furnishing of the rooms, not sufficiently\nto describe them in detail.\nI now want to place on record that, on the night of the 30th\nJanuary, Dr. Braun came with me from London by car and\nalighted somewhere in Castlenau opposite what seemed to be a\ngarden, but I could not see any house behind, and do not know\nDr. Braun's address\u2014nor whether he lives in the main road or\nin a side street\u2014my only impression being that his house was\nsomewhere near Barnes vStation.\nQth October, 1928.\nI have visited Dr. Braun's house ^ in order to check the\naccuracy, or otherwise, of my vision, and found that the approach\nto the house, the porch, with the stone steps at the end of\na gravel path between shrubberies, is exactly as I saw them\u2014the\nporch being at the extreme left of the house, but the door is\nwhite. The door of the adjacent house, however, which is only\na couple of feet to the left, is of the vivid red colour I saw.\nThe staircase I saw is there also, ascending from left to right\n\u2014\nit is not, however, in the hall proper, but somewhat to the\nright in a passage behind the front room. Therefore, I must\nhave seen the staircase which I described through the back\nwall of the front room, exactly as if the hall proper and the\nfront room had formed one big room only.\nFurther, my vision of the interior and the furnishing of the\nroom which was rather vague, does not tally, and I should imagine\nthat being awake, my conscious self was responsible for my\ninaccurate description. . A. David. .\nThis report has been submitted to Dr. Braun, and is certi-\nfied by him as being correct in such particulars as fall within\nhis knowledge.\nIII.\nbth February 1928.\n'\nI went to bed at 12.30 and not finding sleep at once thought\nover my two previous strange experiences of \" mind wandering\n\"\n^ Appended to the original record of this experience was a note by Monsieur\nDavid to the effect that, having looked up Dr. Braun's address in the\nDirectory, he inspected the outside of Dr. Braun's house, -nhich he had\n\"some difficulty in finding\" on February 3rd, 1928, and observed the\npresence of the red door. He also notes that he \" later ascertained from\nDr. Braun that he was not at home on the night of the 2nd of February.\"\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1929\nof the 30th of January and 1st of February, wondering whether\nI could extend my range of vision.\nI thought of paying a mind visit to a friend near Sevenoaks\nor to some of my friends in Paris and while I was still undecided\nI saw a vivid picture as follows :\nA cafe or bar with the usual \" terrace \" (French term for the\nseating accommodation outside the cafe) covered up by sun\nblinds\u2014the cafe being placed on my left in a street which was\nin a slanting position.\nThere was quite a stir inside, and I sensed people moving about\nalthough I could not actually see any one. A counter (serving\ncounter) was on the right of the entrance which was itself at the\nextreme right of the cafe and I thought I could distinguish a coffee\nmachine on the counter but this might have been imagination.\nHowever the striking feature of my vision was that the walls\nbehind the counter and facing the door were covered with mirrors\nand that on the mirrors facing the entrance there were 3 large\nposters\u2014the last one to the left being of a vivid green colour.\nI also saw the name vividly, the name of the proprietor in block\nletters on the sun blind but did not make a note of it at the\ntime and could not remember it the next day\u2014something like\nChenel or Chanel or Bedel.\nI then heard the clock strike 1 (probably one o'clock) and\nwas perfectly awake at the time.\nI have been unable to check up my vision\u2014owing to the\ndistance and the doubt in which I am as regards the exact\nlocality I have visited\u2014but I know that that little cafe exists\nsuch as I have described, with a green poster stuck on the mirror\nfacing the door but where is it\u2014certainly in France but is it\nParis\u2014Senlis\u2014Cannes or any other place where the friends I was\nthinking of at the time might have been ? A. David.\nWith Monsieur David's original records was enclosed the\nfollowing statement, dated May 5th, 1928 :\nEed Hazel, Cole Park Road,\nTwickenham.\nWhile enclosing herewith a detailed account of 3 curious cases\nof \" mind wandering \" which I experienced myself on the 30th\nof January, 1st of February and 4th of February ^ 1928, I think\n1 The experiences took place in the early morning of Jan. 31, Feb. 2 and Feb. 5,\n1928. Ed.\n\fJanuary, 1929 Case 9\nit necessary to add a few comments which might better allow\nto establish the relative value of these observations as compared\nwith others of a similar nature.\nI would say that I am a business man of a rather materialistic\ndisposition, who on principle\u2014and while not denying the possibility\nof strange happenings\u2014will not accept as a fact any phenomenon\nwhich has not been duly probed and verified by people blessed\nwith a critical mind.\nI would further say that I have not made any deep study of\nthe problems of the mind, telepathy or psychics, and that I only\nbecame at all interested in these subjects about 12 months ago.\nIt seems to me therefore extraordinary that I should have obtained\nthe 3 observations I have recorded\n\u2014\nviz. without any preparation\nor training whatsoever and without any real exertion on my\npart.\nI must finally place on record that since my last observation\nof the 4th of February, I have on several occasions tried very\nstrenuously to repeat my experiences of \" mind wandering \" but\nunfortunately without being able to secure any result whatever,\nso much so that were it not for the detailed accounts I wrote\nimmediately after every one of my 3 observations, I would really\ndoubt whether they were not merely the product of my\nimagination.\nA. David.\nANMIAL EEPOET OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1928.\nThe Society has been able in the past year to carry out a\nlarge amount of useful research.\nDealing first with mental phenomena we can record the com-\npletion of ]\\Iiss Jephson\"s experiments in clairvoyance mentioned\nm our last Report. Clairvoyance is a subject which has been\ninsufficiently explored, and these experiments, on which ]\\Iiss\nJephson read a paper in July, published in Part 109 of Pro-\nceedings, are of great importance, not only in providing further\nmuch needed evidence for the existence of clairvoyance as a\nsupernormal faculty, but in throwing light on the experimental\nconditions which help or hinder the occurrence of clairvoyance,\nand possibly of telepathy also.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1929\nThe experiments in telepathy, which began with the broad-\ncasting experiment mentioned in last year's report, have been\ncontinued under the direction of Mr. Soal. With the kind\nassistance of the British Broadcasting Corporation an invitation\nto co-operate in further experiments was broadcast by Professor\nJuhan Huxley in September last, as a result of which upwards\nof 600 percipients are now attempting one night a week to\nobtain impressions from a group acting under Mr. Soal's\ndirection, and are forwarding a record of their impressions to\nthe Society for analysis. It is intended to continue the\nexperiments until Easter 1929. Results of interest have already\nbeen obtained, and the experiment when completed will, it is\nhoped, help to elucidate some matters relating to telepathy at\na distance.\nMr. Besterman has conducted experiments with blind children\nand adults into alleged supernormal faculties. It has often been\nsuggested that the deprivation of normal faculties, such as\nsight, may have a bearing on the exercise of supernormal\nfaculties. The experiments proved of sufficient interest to\njustify preparations for further experiments with blind persons.\nFor this purpose an invitation to co-operate has been inserted\nin the Braille journal Progress.\nIn connexion with the investigation of Mrs. Warren Elliott\nand other mediums, Mr. Saltmarsh, who has kindly been\nanalysing the records for the Society, obtained the assistance\nof various Members in carrying out \" control \" experiments\ndevised to find how far the \" veridical \" results obtained in\ntrance communications are explicable by chance-coincidence.\nThe Council wish once again to thank Mr. Saltmarsh for the\ntime and ingenuity he has expended on this investigation,^\nwhich is now completed ; his Report has been received and\nwe hope to be able to present it to the Society very shortly.\nDuring the year a number of investigations into spontaneous.\n' phenomena have been carried out on behalf of the Council by\nofficers of the Society. Some of these were summarised in the\nJournal for June last, and since that time further cases of\nalleged spontaneous phenomena, including phenomena of \" pol-\ntergeist \" type and an apparition, have been investigated at\nHereford, at Ross, and Llanhilleth in S. Wales. In the last\n\fJanuary, 1929 Annual Report of the Council for 19\u00a38 11\ncase the boy, around whom the disturbances centred, claimed\nto have developed powers of physical mediumship, and three\nsittings were held with him in the Society's Seance Room, but\nwith no definite results.\nVisits have also been made to various physical mediums in\nLondon, and Herr Kraus, concerning whom reports have\nappeared in several continental publications, gave to a small\ncircle of members in our seance room a demonstration of the\nmethods of deception which he said he had employed in\nAustria and Germany. An account of this sitting was printed\nin the December Journal.\nOn the suggestion of Miss May Walker, Baron von Schrenck-\nNotzing was so good as to invite the attendance with her at a\nseries of sittings in his laboratory at Munich of representatives\nof the Society, and Dr. Woolley, Mrs. Brackenbury, and Pro-\nfessor Dodds were able to be present at a number of sittings\nwith Willi and Rudi Schneider. An account of the results of\nthese sittings was given at a Meeting of the Society by Dr.\nWoolley on 5th December.\nThe Council wish to take this opportunity of expressing to\nMiss May Walker their warm appreciation of her kindness in\narranging this meeting, and to Baron von Schrenck-Notzing for\nhis hospitality and for the trouble which he took to make the\nvisit successful.\nThe Hon. Librarian has during the autumn made an extended\ntour on the Continent, in the course of which he has visited\nseveral of the most prominent Continental psychical researchers\nand has had interesting sittings with various mediums, of\nwhich an accoimt will be given later.\nSittings have also been arranged by the Society, either at\nthe Rooms or elsewhere, with a number of clairvoyant or\ntrance mediums. The results so obtained are principally of\nimportance in so far as they provide material which can be\ncompared with that yielded by the long series of sittings with \u2022\nMrs. Warren Elliott.\nThe Council wish again to emphasize their desire to encourage\nthe investigation of the physical phenomena of mediumship,\nwhether spontaneous or experimental, and would urge any\nmembers who may come across instances of any such pheno-\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, I92'j\nmena, however slight and doubtful, to bring them to the\nnotice of the Society's officers. Any communications so received\nare, of course, treated as confidential.\nThe Coimcil wish to thank all those Members and Associates\nof the Society who have during the year assisted them in\ninvestigating occurrences taking place in various parts of the\ncoimtry, particularly the Rev. A. T. Fryer and the Rev. W. S.\nIrving ; also Dr. and Mrs. H. M.

A Catalogue,\nand the first annual Supplement, have been pubhshed, and the\nHon. Librarian is now working on a Subject Index. Catalogues\nwith press marks indicating the position of books on the shelves\nare now for the first time available for persons consulting the\nLibrary ; in this work great assistance has been rendered by\none of our members, Mr. Vinen, who has devoted a very great\ndeal of time and patience to it, and the Council wish to\nexpress their hearty thanks to him. It may be claimed that\nthe Library has never in the Society's history approached its\npresent state of utility and efficiency. During the last year\nthe increase in the number of books borrowed has been con-\nsiderable.\nThe total cost of reorganisation of the Library (for which\nthe money received from the Carnegie Trustees is not available)\namoimts to \u00a3814 9s. 6d. The appeal for donations towards the\nbalance of \u00a3400 mentioned in the last Rej^ort has resulted up\nto the present time in the receipt of \u00a3162 7s. lid. The list is\nstill open and the Council hope that a substantial part of the\nbalance will be met by further donations.\nDuring the year the Council appointed a Committee consist-\n, ing of Mr. Bousfield, K.C., Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. Scott and Mr.\nLambert, to whom Mr. Piddington was subsequently added, to\nconsider what, if any, alterations were desirable in the Society's\nArticles of Association, which have never been systematically\nconsidered since the Society was incorporated in 1895. The\nreport of the Committee has been accepted by the Council.\n\fJanuahy, 1929 Annual Report of the Council for 1928 13\nIt is intended to submit the proposed alterations to the\nnecessary Statutory Meetings at an early date.\nSir Lawrence Jones, Bart., was elected President of the\nSociety last January, and he gave his Presidential Address in\nMarch. The address is published in Proc, Part 106.\nThe sudden death of Mr. Baggally in March deprived the\nCouncil and the Society of an old member who had taken a\nvery active and valuable part in the Society's work.\nTwo former presidents. Dr. L. P. Jacks and Professor Gilbert\nMurray, have felt obliged to resign their places on the Council\nowing to the pressure of other engagements which prevented\nthem from attending meetings of the Council. In neither\ncase does this resignation imply any loss of interest in the\nSociety's work, and both remain Vice-presidents of the Society.\nTo fill the three vacancies thus caused among their elected\nmembers, the Council have appointed Mr. Lambert, Professor Dodds\nand Mr. Bousfield, who have hitherto been co-opted members.\nThe Council have also co-opted to places on the Council the\nHon. Librarian (Mr. Besterman), the Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton,\nD.B.E., Miss Jephson, and Mr. S. G. Soal, all of whom have\ndone important work for the Society.\nOnce again the pressure of work has compelled the Council\nto obtain the assistance of extra staff. Mrs. Brackenbury has\nbeen of great help to the Hon. Research Officer in his depart-\nment ; in particular, she has visited many mediums, and\ninvestigated on the spot several alleged occurrences of spon-\ntaneous phenomena. Miss Carruthers has undertaken the\nlaborious routine work required for Mr. Soal's telepathy experi-\nments. It has also been necessary from time to time to em-\nploy additional clerical assistance.\nOwing to ill-health Sergeant and Mrs. Ham, who for several\nyears did good service to the Society as Housekeepers, could\nnot be kept on in the Society's employment ; their duties\nwere taken over in July by Mr. and Mrs. ToLhurst.\nThe Coimcil have to record with regret the death of several\nold Members of the Society, among whom were : Mr. A. L.\nBaker, Lord Carnock, Professor H. N. Gardiner and Mr. Orville\nPeckham, who have been members for nearly forty years,\nMrs. Smithson (who left the Society a legacy of \u00a3500), Rev.\n\f]4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1929\nDr. Douglas, Sir Frank Dicksee, Mr. C. B. Ingham, and the\nDuke of Newcastle who have been members since the beginning\nof the century, also Lady Grey of Fallodon.\nOne Corresponding Member was elected during the year :\nCount Carl v. Klinckowstroem. Sixty new Members were\nelected, and five Associates became Members. The Society has\nlost by death nine Members and twelve Associates ;\nby\nresignation, thirty-six Members and thirteen Associates ; and\nthrough failure to pay their subscriptions, nine Members and\nthree Associates.

Winther's Experiments in Telekinesis.\nPsychical Research for January-May 1928 contains a detailed\npaper by Professor Winther of Copenhagen dealing with the\nphenomena exhibited by Mrs. Easmussen. These include the\nordinary occurrences such as raps, automatic writing, and trance\nspeech, but the main interest centres on the experiments dealing\nwith possible telekinesis. Professor Winther draws attention to\ncertain unusual circumstances : phenomena occur at every sitting,\nthere are no true \" blank times :\n\" they occur in really good\nlight ; dominance has been obtained over the controls, so that\nthe details are in the hands of the experimenters. After obtaining\npartial levitations of a table, oscillations of balances were observed ;\nin particular oscillation of one balance only of a pair. This led\nProf. Winther to construct a special piece of pendulum apparatus\n;\nhe states, of course . . . we worked with two pendulums,\" but\nit is unlucky that he was so impressed by the motion of the\nbalances. The two pendulums were suspended from a common\nsupport, and each was \" conical,\" that is to say, the bobs could\nmove in any plane or elliptical path. To analyse the motions of\nsuch a pair is very difficult : even if a trace of the motion is\nsecured (which Prof. Winther obtained) we are confronted with\nthe extreme difficulties involved in interpreting such a trace, and\nthere is always the possibility of coupling and interchange of\nenergy via the common support. It is stated that such coupHng\nwas practically non-existent, but the test of this as described is\nscarcely convincing. ^^Tiy such a gratuitous complication was\nadopted is not clear ; a simple pendulum suspended bifilarly so as\nto swing in one plane would have given a perfectly clear trace\non the travelling band used which would have been easy of\ninterpretation : but one must take things as they are.\nThe frame on which the pendulums hung was glass-sided, and\nin the final form the bobs contained an electric lamp and a lens\nby which the paths were automatically recorded on a strip of\nsensitised paper moved horizontally below the bobs at a moderately\nconstant speed. This apparatus was set up in two places. First\nit was secured to a concrete pillar in a cellar, and very perfect\nprecautions were taken to prevent tremors being communicated\n38S\n\f16 \/ournal of Society for Psychical Research Januaky, 1929\nto it. Two trials, wiere made with tla? \"setting without any\nsuccess : the control said that the \" pillar was too damp.\" The\nsecond place was a room in Prof. Winther's house, where the\napparatus was fixed to a stout table secured to the floor\n:\nphenomena started at once. A long description of the first\narrangement is given, which might well have been omitted, since it\nproved useless. It is to be noted that when it was practically\nimpossible for external forces to act on the apparatus, all was\nstill. Motions being observed with the second arrangement, traces\nof them were taken. An approximate analysis is developed by\nwhich the true amplitude of a plane swing not taking place in\na plane perpendicular to that of the moving band can be cal-\nculated, also for finding the amount of any change of azimuth\nof that plane : the damping of the pendulums with free motion\nwas also measured. From these data Prof. Winther calculates\nthe magnitude and approximate direction of the force which\nwould account for the observed changes of amplitude and\nazimuthal plane as shown on the photographic records. But these\nrecords themselves show that the paths were often conical, so\nthat the analysis is not applicable. Further, the traces appear\nto be on too small a scale to make such deductions warrantable,\nespecially in view of the possibility of coupling.\nProf. Winther found that the motion was practically independent\nof the bob-material : he gives many instances in which amplitude\nand phase changes apparently occurred at command, though\nmany of these are accompanied by coupling as is actually visible\non several of his curves. He notes that a glass of water put\non the table showed no sign of tremors which might well be\ntrue for slowish impulses. On the whole, the numerical deductions\nmust be pronounced \" non proven.\" But there remains a resi-\nduum of occurrences of some interest. The amplitudes sometimes\nbecame large enough for the bobs to hit the glass sides, which\nwas a considerable excursion, and it is stated that one pendulum\nhit another which remained at rest : these and a few other inter-\nesting points are still obscure.\nA set of observations is given of the respiration rate of the\nsubject, and the remarkable point is made that this rate often\napproximately coincided with the pendulum rates, though Prof.\nWinther declares that experiment showed it was very difl&cult to\nproduce motion of the pendulums by purposeful action on the floor.\n\fJanuaet, 1929 Review 17\nProf. Winther would gain one's gratitude if he were content to\nrepeat the experiments with a \" one degree of freedom \" pen-\ndulum. Should he get positive results with this, they will merit\nthe most careful consideration.\nC.G.L.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning D. D. Home.\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014The writer of the letter signed P.-P.-S. in the November\nissue of our Journal, in a footnote, asserts that it is \" very prob-\nable \" that D. D. Home frauded on several occasions, without\ngiving a single reference whereby a reader might test the validity\nof this statement ; neither does he refer to the fact that Sir Wm.\nCrookes, who knew him intimately, wrote : \"I was on my guard\neven in D. D. Home's case, although I am bound to say that\nwith him I never detected any trickery or deceit whatever, nor\nheard any first-hand evidence of such from other persons.\" (Proc.\nS.P.R., Vol. VI. p. 99).\nThis conclusion has been endorsed by Prof. Richet, who wrote :\n\" Sometimes, indeed, as in the case of Dunglas Home, it has had\nto be acknowledged that the accusation of fraud was unjustified\n\"\n(Should Spiritism he seriously studied, p. 42).\nTo impugn any man's honour on the basis of a \" probability\n\"\nin the face of such positive testimony from impartial witnesses is\nnot cricket.\"\nMoreover in 1912 Count Solovovo, in our Journal, effectually\ndisposed of ^the evidence of fraud in a particular instance\nwhen Home was accused of having used a gloved foot,\nshowing that the evidence was quite insufiicient to sustain the\ncharge (Vol. XV. pp. 274-284).\nIf a man's character is impugned whilst he is still on earth he\nhas means of redress in the law courts, but the \" Silent Ones\n\"\nhave no remedy, except that innate sense of justice which should\nmake us all scrupulously careful not to smirch another man's good\nname, without solid proof to justify our so doing.\nH. A. Dallas.\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli Janhart, 1929\nReply to Miss Dallas\n:\nI can assure Miss Dallas that she is utterly mistaken, It is not\nin my habit to \" smirch \" other people's good names whatever\ntheir convictions or professions. On the other hand, I do not see\nwhy I cannot say in 1928 that I believe a man to have been\ndetected in fraud merely because that man died in 1886.\nIf Miss Dallas consults No. 1 of the French periodical Revue\nde Paris for 1912 she will find there letters by a Dr. Barthez,\nwho was physician to Napoleon III. ; one of these letters deals\nwith the detection. This is contemporary evidence, though not,\nit is true, first-hand evidence. But there is every reason to\nbelieve that Dr. Barthez was well acquainted with an incident\nwhich had happened in the Emperor's entourage. The date is 1854\n{at Biarritz).\nAgain in M. Paul Heuze's Oil en est la Metapsychique ? (Paris,\nGauthier Villars et Cie. editeurs, 1926) the writer says he repeatedly\nheard the same story from the late Prince Koland Bonaparte,\nwho had it on the authority of the Empress Eugenie.\nAgain in La Societe du Second Empire, 1852-1858, by Comte\nEleury and M. Sonolet the same narrative is found on pp. 149 sqq.\nIt is true that when some seventeen years ago I applied to the\nauthor or authors for further details I found that they could not\nsubstantiate their statements. The fact that these statements were\nmade in a serious book shows nevertheless that the legend of\nD. D. Home's detection was already so to say in the air. It\nhas since materialised in the Barthez letter.\nI was therefore perfectly justified in saying that D. D Home's\nexposure in at least one instance {not \" several,\" as Miss D.\nmakes me say) seemed to me \" very probable.\"\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nEtudes, No. 17, 1928 (Paris). Professor Victor Poucel prints\na paper entitled \" A Telepathic Exploration,\" in which he de-\nscribes some ex2:)eriments made with two of his colleagues after\nreading an account of Mr. Rene Warcollier's and comments on\nthem. The experiments narrated are interesting ; to me personally\nthey are not absolutely convincing, but I willingly admit that\n\fJanuahv, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 19\nopinions on this point may legitimately diiier. The most interest-\ning point about M. Poucel's article is of course the fact of its\nbeing published in a strictly Roman Catholic periodical edited by\nJesuits. It should be noted, however, that the author energeti-\ncally repudiates all tendencies to connect telepathy and clair-\nvoyance with the supernormal aspects of Religion. On the other\nhand, he thinks that telepathy may play an important part in\nhuman destiny, and even calls it the \" terrestrial agent \" of God.\nRevue Metapsychique, September-October 1928. A lecture by\nProfessor R. Santoliquido on \" Biology and Metapsychics \" de-\nlivered in March 1928 at Geneva before the \" International and\nPermanent Centre of Lectures and Congresses on Psychical\nResearch \" is reproduced verbatim.\nProfessor Ch. Richet prints a note in answer to Dr. Osty's\narticle on Notre sixieme sens, to which note Dr. Osty briefly\nreplies.\nA paper by M. Paul Choisnard entitled \" Relations between\nAstrology and Metapsychics \" is a summary of a forthcoming\nbook by the same writer called Astrologie et Metapsychique. Let\nus await the book itself.\nDr. Osty prints a characteristic note on M. Marjan Gruzewski\n(see S.P.R. Journal for July). It now appears that five years\nbefore his first trance \" drawing this gentleman \" s'adonnait\nactive)7ient a la pratique du dessin, en pleine conscience, avec heau-\ncoup de dispositions \"\n(p. 417). The scepticism manifested by\nus appears therefore to have been more than justified.\nProfessor Charles Richet prints a charming fable entitled The\nCarp and the Swallow,\" the idea of which is the same as that\nunderlying Sir Oliver Lodge's ingenious apologue in Why I believe\nin personal Immortality : a beautiful and very profound idea\nadmirably\u2014and amusingly\u2014expressed\n.\n- In the Chronique (by M. Maurice Maire) the death of J. Guzik\nis aimounced and his \" powerful manifestations \" are mentioned,\nJ. G. being called a \" remarkable \" medium for \" materialisations.\"\nI beg to refer the reader in this connection to my \" Note \" in\nthe November Journal.\nTwo interesting extracts are quoted from two letters written\nrespectively in April and June 1913 by Sister Andre de Marie\nImmaculee (Helene Touve), a Roman Catholic missionary in\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 1929\nIndia, briefly describing some mysterious stone-throwings at\nKumbakonam. In the first letter the stones are said to have\nbeen too big to have been \" lancees.\" The manifestations are\nstated in the second letter to have ceased immediately after a\nrelic containing a fragment of the True Cross had been placed\non the edge of the roof of a house which was being built at the\nbishop's wish. In the first letter the stone-throwings are also\nsaid to have ceased after prayers had been said by one of the\nFathers. The writer has no doubt of the diabolical origin of the\nphenomena. The case is certainly very interesting, though far\ntoo briefly described.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, November 1928. Dr. Paul Siinner\nprints the first part of a paper on the supposed psychometric\ngift of Frau Lotte Plaat (see Journal S.P.R.\u2014Notes on Periodicals\n\u2014for June 1928). This part contains almost exclusively general\nconsiderations.\nDr. Marcinowski follows with another instalment of his paper\non Frau Klette's \" Intuitive Character Diagnoses.\" It is still un-\nfinished.\nDr. Zenker relates very briefly some incidents connected with\na new Leipzig clairvoyante whose name is not given.\nHerr Alois Konecny of Prague narrates some physical experi-\nences of his wife's which may have been curious, occurring in\nNovember 1915 on one day.\nProf. Szanto of Bratislava-Pressburg has a paper on psychometry\nunder the title of \" Universal Association as ErJclcirungsjorinzip in\nParapsychology.\"\nThe reminiscences on Zollner of a certain J. A. Repsold, con-\nstructor of astronomical instruments (died 1919), are printed.\nInteresting and valuable as they are, they do not afford us, I\nthink, any new data of importance re the Slade seances of 1877-78.\nHerr Richard Dangel, of Vienna, narrates some tricks of \" North-\nAmerican Medicine-men \" (Indian), abundantly borrowing from\nvarious American works (list given on pp. 680 and 681). The\nincidents decisively suggesting supernormal action are very few.\nJan Guzik's death is spoken of in Kleine Mitteilungen. I note\nthat frauds on his part are admitted (p. 682) and beg to refer\nthe reader again to my note in the November Journal.\nFrom another note we learn that Baron von Schrenck-Notzing\n\fJanuary, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 21\nand other gentlemen of repute, among them a scientist of Prof.\nHans Driesch's eminence, are to be closely connected with Dr.\nSchroder's Institute for Metapsychical Research at Lichterfelde-Ost.\nThis is very satisfactory. They will impress on Dr. Schroder,\nit is to be earnestly hoped, the urgent desirability of avoiding\nin the future coarse language when dealing with his opponents\n;\nand will also surmount his repugnance to have the Physical\nPhenomena of Spiritism investigated by conjurers, this being\none of his several grievances against the S.P.E. {Zeitschr. fiir\nPsych. Forschung, October 1928, p. 295).\nDr. Adolf Schmidt, Secretary of the Berlin Medical Society for\nParapsychical Research, narrates some very curious cases of\nphantoms of the dead experienced by a certain Frau Minna T.\nIn one case the apparition was seen by Frau T.'s daughters.\nExtraordinary\u2014indeed most uncanny\u2014experiences of the same\nlady's after the death of one of her daughters are also related.\nDr. Schmidt certifies her to be of sound mind (p. 680)\u2014which\nmight well have been doubted.\nProf. Dennert, of Godesberg, relates two incidents connected\nwith a clairvoyante Frau N. which suggest\u2014if genuine !\n\u2014\" clair-\nvoyance \" coupled with direct writing.\nZeitschr ift fur Psychische Forschung, November 1928.\nDr. Schroder prints further particulars about the Lichterfelde-\nOst \" Institute for Metapsychical Research,\" its programme, the\nSociety for Metapsychical Research connected with it, etc.\nDr. Mattiesen narrates the Alexander's Tomb Cross-correspond-\nence {Proc. S.P.R., XXVII. pp. 56sqq.).\n\" Man's survival of death \" is the title of a paper by Hofrat\nProf. Max Selling. What the writer says as to the idea of im-\nmortality having been entertained in some form or other by \" all\n\"\npeoples and corresponding therefore to an \" infallible \" instinct\ncould open up a very interesting discussion, from which the\npresent writer must however abstain for more reasons than one.\nIn Kleine Mitteilungen Dr. Schroder describes first of all a\npsychometric experiment with Frau Giinther-Gefiers in July last,\nwhich seems to me unsuccessful.\nHe then proceeds to relate an experiment in \" mango growing\n\"\nwhich he witnessed in 1926 at Shiraz. Seeing that Shiraz is in\nSouth-West Persia the name of \" yoghi \" given to the performer\n\fI\n22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January, 192!)\ndoes not seem very appropriate, nor is the term of mango growing\nquite exact. Tlie account is interesting but by no means con-\nvincing. The \" phenomenon \" was registered on a photographic\nplate. Dr. Schroder quotes by the way from an article by our\nCorresponding Member Count Klinckowstroem in Psychische Studien\nfor 1924 (pp. 356 sqq.) a statement by Dr. Hans Henning of\nDanzig, according to which \" educated Germans \" detained in\nIndia during the War were able to prove by \" numerous \" photo-\ngraphic trials the subjective character of the mango-trick, rope-\ntrick and basket-trick. Various details are given (by Dr. Henning)\nof the way in which \" the Indian \" suggests to the audience what\nhe wants to be seen, but strange to say all these assertions\nappear to be altogether unsubstantiated ! Dr. Schroder is therefore\nquite right when he challenges Dr. H. H. to produce his evidence,\nhowever unpleasant is Dr. S.'s usual brutal way of dealing with\nhis opponents.\nMonistische Monatshefte (Hamburg), November 1928.\nThere are short articles on the Physical Phenomena of Spiritism\nby various writers, including Count Klinckowstroem, under various\ntitles. We shall probably have an opportunity of reverting to\nsome of the points touched upon later on.\nP.-P.-S.\nPsychic Science, October 1928.\nThe Editorial Notes open with a reference to the recent prose-\ncution of Mrs. Caution and Miss Phillimore (of the L.S.A.), and the\neditor then discusses the future of spiritualism, stressing the\nimportance of \" physical phenomena.\"\nThe announcement is made that Mr. Hewat McKenzie has asked\nto be released from office as Principal of the British College of\nPsychic Science, in order to \" devote some time to the production\nof a volume of experiences.\" Mrs. McKenzie has consented for\nthe moment to take his place.\nThere is an article by Mr. Arthur Goadby on the performances\nof \" Black Bear the Psychic Pony,\" who was also discussed by\nMr. Bligh Bond in Psychic Research, January 1928 (see S.P.R.\nJournal, May 1928, p. 269). According to a statement on p. 193, the\npony on one occasion named several playing cards held up to him\nby Mr. Goadby and unseen by anyone except the horse. This\n\fJancart, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 23\nexperiment, if properly carried out, would of course exclude the\nuse of a code between the horse and his master. But most of\nthe experiments seem to have been carried out under poor con-\nditions and without system.\nMrs. Helen Lambert reports \" the Case of Mr. C. E.\", another\ncase of obsession treated by Dr. Titus Bull, with the help of a\nmedium, and Mr. Drayton Thomas has an article on \" The Modus\nOperandi of Trance Communication,\" as observed in his sittings\nwith Mrs. Osborne Leonard (see S.P.K. Jour. Dec. 1928, p. 398,\nfor a review of J\\L:.

B.\" to Dr. Hereward Carrington, who\ncontributes a short introductory note. Mr. A. B. is himself con-\nvinced that his experiences are due to obsession by various known\nand recognised spirits, members of his own family. Dr. Carrington\npoints out that the case according to generally accepted theory\nwould appear to be one of dissociation of personality, combined\nwith hallucinations, but he quotes a statement made by William\nJames in his Report on Mrs. Piper's Hodgson control to the effect\nthat \" the demon theory (not necessarily a devil theory) will have\nits innings again.\" Mr. A. B.'s account of his experiences is on any\ntheory interesting, especially his description of the way in which\nthe voices of his obsessors (which he constantly hears) seem to\nblend with various objective sounds, normally heard, and to be\nreinforced by them.\nThere is a further instalment of Mr. Malcolm Bird's report on\n\" Teleplasmic Thumbprints \" (The Margery Case). A report on\n\" The Chinese Scripts by Margery \" by Dr. Neville Whymant, said\nto be contained in \" the third issue of Psychic Science for 1928,\"\nis here reviewed. But the publication of Dr. Whymant's report in\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jandaht, 1929\nPsychic Scierice seems to have been delayed (it is not included in\nthe third issue, October 1928) and for the present therefore\ncomment is deferred.\nM.

It was followed by an interesting discussion.\n\fFebecaet, 1929 Reply to Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo 27\nA REPLY TO COUNT PEROVSKY-PETROVO-SOLOVOVO.\nBy Dr. E. Mattieseist.\nIn the November issue (1928) of this Journal Count Perovsky-\nPetrovo-Solovovo has brought forward some criticisms against a\nseries of articles which the present writer had published in the\nZeitschrift fur psychische ForscJiung between March 1927 and June\n1928. In those articles I have been trying to introduce a new\nhue of argument in favour of the participation, in the drama of\ntrance-communication, of real and independent entities outside the\nmedium's \" subconsciousness,\" by exhibiting, from the records of\ntrance-sittings collected by the S.P.R., instances of realistic faith-\nfulness in sustaining roles ; of the lifelike distribution of knowledge\namong trance-personalities ; of the purposeful and aggressive\ninsistence of would-be communicators ; of personal reactions\nbetween the various actors on the trance-stage ; of their critical\ndeportment towards each other ; of discrepancies of thought\nbetween them, including cases of misunderstanding and \" mis-\nhearing \" ; of lifelike dramatic intermezzi, offering the appearance\nof a genuine plurality of participators ; of difficulties attending\nthe process of communication, not referable to the act of sub-\nconscious utterance as such,\u2014and so forth. Now into the essence\nof these arguments, which have been received by competent\npsychical researchers (Prof. Driesch among them) as a valuable\ncontribution towards the scientific establishment of the spiritistic\nhypothesis, my critic does not enter in the least, hoping appar-\nently to dispose of the whole structure of my arguments and\nconclusions by discrediting the material on which it is based. My\ninvestigations, he avers, have but the appearance of science,\"\nsince they presuppose throughout the medium's bona fides\n\"\nand\n' assume the genuineness of [trance-Jutterances \"\n(p. 364). But\nin doing this they move on \" precarious ground,\" to prove which\nmy critic instances the doubts cast at some time on Mrs. Thomp-\nson's honesty by Dr. Hodgson (Proc. vol. xvii, p. 138 sqq.). Now\nit is true that Dr. Hodgson, after having attended but six sittings\nwith Mrs. Thompson, suspected (but never proved !) her giving out\nto her sitter information normally, and even surreptitiously,\nacquired. But then he denied Mrs. Thompson's ever having gone\ninto trance during those sittings {op. cit. pp. 139, 143), while,\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical itesearc^ February, 1929\napart from him, no one of those who investigated her phenomena\never doubted the genuineness of her trances in general. In fact,\nas Count Perovsky undoubtedly knows, the very volume just\nquoted contains papers by Sir Oliver Lodge, Mr. Myers, Dr. van\nEeden, Mr. \" Wilson \" and Mrs. Verrall, who all of one accord\ndeclare themselves in favour of the genuineness of the Thompson\ntrances, the supernormality of much of the knowledge shown in\nthem, and even, in part, the plausibility of a spiritistic interpreta-\ntion of certain incidents (see Proc. vol. xvii, pp. 66, 73, 81 sqq.,\n130 sqq., 136, 217 sqq.) ; and in the following vol. (xviii) of the Pro-\nceedings Mr. Piddington published a most valuable and pains-\ntaking examination of Mrs. Thompson's trance-phenomena as a\nwhole, after which there could not, in any unprejudiced reader's\nmind, remain the shadow of a doubt with regard to their genuine-\nness and, to a great extent, supernormality. Nor does even\nCount Perovsky altogether ignore the pro's in Mrs. Thompson's\ncase (p. 365) ; he merely insists that, \" grave doubts\n\u2014\nwhether\nrightly or wrongly\u2014 \" as to a trance-medium repeatedly quoted\nby me having once been uttered, I should not have passed over\nthose suspicions in silence. I surely think, on the contrary, that,\nbeing convinced, from a comprehensive study of the case, that\nDr. Hodgson's doubts had been superseded, I was justified in\nusing the best of her trance records as material for my analytical\nstudy. At any rate, to say that here I was moving on \" utterly\nprecarious ground,\" shows a degree of favouring negative wit-\nnesses, of which I may leave it to my readers to form their own\nopinion. However, be that as it may : assuming even that the\nThompson records had justly and completely been ruled out of\ncourt, I maintain that this would not noticeably weaken the\nfabric of my arguments. I have, in the course of my articles,\nreferred to Mrs. Thompson\u2014if I may trust a cursory counting\n\u2014\njust 22 times ; I have not quoted her at all under several of\nmy headings, and but once and but incidentally under some\nothers. Against this stands the fact of my articles containing\n83 references to Mrs. Piper, 102 to Mrs. Leonard, 39 to Mrs.\nVerrall, and about a dozen to Mrs. \" King,\" Mrs. Salter, Mrs.\n\" Holland \" and various other sensitives. I feel certain that in\nview of these figures any depreciation of my quotations- from the\nThompson records, if it were to be admitted, might be suffered\nto drop out of consideration. For even Count Perovsky's staunch\n\fFebruart, 1929 Reply to Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo 29\nscepticism will hardly go the length of declaring the acts of all\nthose sensitives to be \" utterly precarious ground.\" If such be\nthe case, the S.P.R. might as well give up printing trance-records\nat all, and psychical researchers despair of ever obtaining material\nfor an analytical study of the deeper problems of their science.\nAltogether Count Perovsky is misconceiving the trend of my\nthought when he complains that, while analysing the trance-\nutterances of professional mediums, I throughout assume the\ngenuineness of these utterances \"\n(p. 364), if by \" genuineness\n\"\nhe means their partly supernormal character, not to speak of their\npossible origin in the mind of any departed. What I am\nsolely assuming is the genuineness of the trance-state (or the\nautomatic nature of utterances respectively) an unassailable\nassumption in practically every case I have made use of ; for\nalmost exclusively by analysing the dramatic forms of such utter-\nances have I been trying to prove the participation in them of\nmore than one independent entity,\u2014quite regardless of the contents\nof such utterances, which, of course, form the usual basis for\nascribing to them any supernormal origin. It is, then, the\nvalidity of my conclusions drawn from such analysis which ought\nto be either admitted or else criticized ;\nyet as to that validity\nmy critic has not said one word.\nCount Perovsky equally falls into error when from the general\ndepreciation of my materials he passes on to criticizing individual\ninstances. In my analysis of the White Case I had, inter alia,\ndescribed the curious scene during a Leonard sitting shortly after\nMrs. White's death, when \" Feda \" alone seemed totally unable\nto grasp the fact that her former client had \" passed over,\" while\nthe sitter (Miss Nea Walker) and the communicator (\"' Mr.\nWhite \") were, of course, aware of it and used expressions about\nit which might have enlightened, but ended by \" completely\nbamboozling,\" the control. \" Dr. Mattiesen,\" says the Count,\n\" assumes without further ado that Feda '\nnaturally '\nknew nothing\nof the death, and after an exhaustive discussion of the incidents\nof the sitting based on so strange an assumption, observes that\nanother instance more conclusive of the spirit hypothesis could\nhardly have been quoted. Poor hypothesis indeed if unsupported\nby better evidence !\n\"\n(p. 365). Poor, indeed, if no better\nevidence be available than my critic fondly imagines the present\none to be. As a matter of fact, I did not make the above\n\f30 Journal oj Socitiy fur Faychicat litsearch February, 1929\nassumi^tion \" without further ado,\" but on the explicit testimony\nof Miss Walker, author of The Bridge, who tells us (p. 260) that\n\" Mrs. Leonard had never known Mrs. White's name or address,\nso that newspaper notices would not inform her of the death,\nsupposing she saw any. And she was not told of it in any\nother way.\" But then, assuming even that Mrs. Leonard, and\ntherefore \" Feda,\" might have become aware of the death by\nnormal or any other means, we should still have to weigh the\nlifelike \" naturalness \" of the trance-scene against the possibility\nand likelihood of Feda's creating such a wonderful piece of\n\" comedy \" and make-believe, instead of parading her knowledge\nof the death as a cheap means of proving insight into the happen-\nings of the beyond. I challenge readers to study the record of\nthe sitting in question {The Bridge, p. 262 ff.) and then ask\nthemselves whether they do not find in \" Feda's \" exclusive and\nobvious ignorance of what everybody else knows\u2014conclusive proof\nof the independence, in this case, of cummunicator and control.\nHere is another sample of the Count's \" critical methods \" as\napplied to individual instances : I had been arguing that \" acoustic\nmishearing \" of the communicator by the control contributed one\nproof, amongst others, of their mutual independence. Count P.\nattempts (on p. 365 sq.) to invalidate one of the instances given\nfor this, viz. the apparent mistaking of \" Hodgson \" for \" Hog-\nman \" on the part of \" Rector,\" by declaring it a possible \" piece\nof refined comedy \"\n\u2014thus turning into a criticism an admission\nmade by myself. He does not tell his readers that I had given\nsix instances in all of this special sort of occurrences, which it\nwould be difficult to stamp, all of them, as pieces of comedy.\nAnd even were we to admit a bare possibility of doing so in most\ncases taken singly\u2014does not Count Perovsky admit that it is\noften by the accumulation of stray hints that the weight of an\nexplanation is increased until it well-nigh amounts to certainty,\njust as it is the convergence of various forms of argument in my\narticles which amounts to a new kind of proof of survival ?\nThe second general criticism advanced by Count Perovsky refers\nto the fact that in my articles I have been discussing certain\npro's, but have \" completely ignored \" the contra\"s of the spiri-\ntistic explanation of trance-phenomena ; a fact which is said to\n\" deprive [my] work of scientific value,\" since \" science is no\nplaidoyer \" (366). I am rather amazed at such logic in polemics.\n\fFebruary, 1929 Reply to Count Feruvsky-Petrovo-Solovovo 31\nMy articles did not pretend to constitute a comprehensive treatise\non Spiritism. In them I repeatedly and emphatically proclaimed\nmy intention to set aside, for the time, all those facts which\nrepresent difficulties in the way of a spiritistic explanation of\ntrance-phenomena, and to limit myself to the exhibition of just\none new line of argument in favour of it. (See p. 341 of vol. 3,\nZtschr. f. ps. F., as well as p. 69, referred to by Count Perovsky.)\nI also referred my readers, in the very same sentence, to a paper\nto be jjublished at a later date, in which those difficulties were\nto be discussed at length and worked into a comprehensive theory\nof the trance-drama. What there is unpardonable in such a\nproceeding, or un-\" scientific \" (a regular word-fetish of my critic)\nI am at a loss to make out. Count Perovsky kindly credits me\nwith a knowledge of \" Mrs. Sidgwick's admirable paper in vol. xv\nof Proceedings,\" setting forth some of those difficulties ; and I\nshall credit him with a knowledge of her still more admirable\npaper filling the whole of vol. xxviii, and far more exhaustively deal-\ning with those difficulties. But what of that ? Do Mrs. Sidg-\nwick's investigations preclude any further vindication of spiritistic\nviews ? Far from it, says\u2014Count Perovsky (p. 368). And well\nmight he be aware that even Mrs. Sidgwick, notwithstanding her\nsurpassing acumen in expounding the mortal side of trance-\nmediumship, has more than once declared her willingness to\nadmit, ultimately, a spiritistic interpretation of certain trance-\nphenomena. This being so, what becomes of the Count's\nreproach, and by what canon of logic was I constrained to force\na discussion of surmountable difficulties into an article expressly\ndestined to extend the positive proofs of spiritism by just one ?\nAfter all, I should hardly have thought proper to devote so\nmuch space to the refutation of so ill-considered an attack, were\nit not that in replying to it I meant to meet a class of critics\nand psychical \" researchers \" who ought, I think, at times to be\nreminded to keep within bounds. I mean those \" negativists\n\"'\nwho seem to find the purpose of \" scientific \" work in endless\nfastidious cavilling at details and gnawing at the weaker points\nof individual \" cases,\" even after a genuine natural type of facts\nhas long been established beyond reasonable doubt by the constant\nrecurrence of typical details in a majority of \" strong \" cases.\nThose negativists undoubtedly serve some useful purpose in\nsteadying the advance of research, yet never really contribute\n\f32 Journal 0\/ Society for Psychical Research February, 1929\ntowards the progress of science, which essentially aims at the\nestablishment of a rational synthesis and comprehension of facts.\nTheir resolute \" will to disbelieve \" condemns them to sterility,\nnotwithstanding their perpetual talk of \" scientific standards \" and\n\"critical methods,\" and their names will most likely be forgotten^\nwhen the history of the science of metapsychics, i.e. of those\nsynthetic conceptions, which constitute its framework, shall come\nto be written.\n[This article was received in December, but was held over for\nlack of space.

By J. Aethur Hill.\nRider and Co., London. 5s. net.\nAnother book by Mr. J. Arthur Hill is sure to be welcomed.\nHis new work has the qualities which have characterised his\nformer writings, plus, a closer unity of conception, which gives it\nadditional interest from a literary standpoint. He has always\nshown a full consciousness of the importance of well-attested\nfacts. Whilst recognizing that many things may be true\nwhich cannot be proved to be so, he never bases his convictions\non anything short of good evidence ;\n'\nmoreover, he reviews both\nthe facts and the conclusions to which they have led him in a\n\" dry light.\" Of no one can it be asserted that he is wholl}^\nwithout bias of any kind, but certainly Mr. Hill cannot be accused\nof a bias in favour of credulity. It is the impact of facts of\nexperience which have compelled him, as a logical and honest\nthinker, to the complete change of attitude which he has made\nduring the last twenty-five years.\nIn his last book, in addition to the re-statement of some of\nthe results of psychical research, which have appeared in our\nProceedings and elsewhere, he has added further experiences which\n1 1 confess to looking forward to such a prospect with undisguised cheerful-\nness. And as the same destiny is, I fear, likely to overtake Dr. Mattiesen,.\nmay I express the hope that his serenity in this respect will be in no way\ninferior to my own.\u2014P.-P.-S.\n\fFebruary, 1929 Revieiv 33\nhitherto have not been in print. As the title indicates, his aim\nis not merely to present evidence for supernormal occurrences in\na compact form, but, also, to co-ordinate the knowledge thus\nacquired with Religion and Philosophy. Such attempts are\nspecially interesting at the present time. In a period of transition\nthere is always a risk that truths of vital importance may be dis-\ncarded together with the obsolete interpretations that must be set\naside. The work of interpretation and co-ordination cannot be\nfully done by one writer, or, indeed, at any one period, but\nthoughtful writers can greatly assist in this task, provided they\nkeep themselves abreast of fresh discoveries. Mr. Hill is both\nwell-informed and eminently fair-minded, therefore his contribution\nto the literature of psychical research and to the work of co-\nordinating this subject with previous studies can be recommended\nto all inquirers, especially to those who have not time for personal\nexperiment or prolonged research.\nThe headings of chapters clearly indicate the scope of the work.\n\" Can old doctrines be retained by interpretation ?\n\" \" Possible\nbasis of a new religious world-view.\" \" Conditions of the Here-\nafter,\" etc.\nThe latter chapter is necessarily the least satisfactory ; the\nauthor is obviously aware that it must be so. He admits that\nhe \" has not felt much interested in the matter.\" His remarks\nare quite appropriate, but they do not carry the reader far. He\nconsiders that it is not possible to obtain reliable information\nconcerning the environment of discarnate beings.\nIf human beings, both before and after death, possess mental,\npsychical and spiritual faculties, we may reasonably conclude that\nwe can to some extent understand the nature of conditions after\ndeath in these respects, since we have a common experience in\nthese faculties ; communications claiming to come from the\nBeyond amply support this conclusion. But as they have ceased\nto use physical bodies, we do not know how their organisms may\nbe related to the new environment. Any speculations on this\nline should be held very tentatively. We know, however, that\nprogressive evolution is the law of life ; and therefore we anticipate\nthat enhanced faculties may result in an interpretation of environ-\nment exceeding in interest and delight anything we can at present\nexperience under our limited conditions.\n.\n. H. A. Dallas.\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febkuary, 1929\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nEtudes, 5th November, 1928.\nFather Roure discusses the report on the International Congress\nfor Psychical Research (1927) recently published. Some of his\nremarks deserve attention. He quotes with obvious approval\nProf. Ch. Richet's statement as to the meagre (mediocres) results\nobtained hitherto by spiritists and M. Sudre's remarks to the\nsame effect. A propos of the jAysical phenomena, he speaks of\nSir William Crookes's \" credulity \" re the Katie King apparitions.\nMy belief in the genuineness of the latter is of the slightest\n;\nand yet I do not think we are entitled to regard the matter as\nirrevocably and definitively disposed of. On the whole the writer\nis very sceptical towards physical phenomena ; less so with\nregard to what Prof. Richet calls metapsychique subjective. Speak-\ning of Dr. Osty's investigation of precognition, he expresses the\nopinion that this gentleman's conclusions are too hasty ; and\nutters the\u2014very natural and legitimate\u2014wish of knowing the\ndetails of at least one seance out of the two thousand attended\nby the French investigator : an opinion with which many of us,\nincluding myself, will be inclined to agree.\nWhen Father Roure says on the other hand that it is highly\nimprudent to expose oneself to being told by a voyante about\ncalamities imagined by the latter but which may become real on\naccount of panic seizing the sitter, I think he is only partly\nright. Of course, here as elsewhere, almost everything depends\non the personality of the sitter.\nOn the whole Father Roure's article is interesting chiefly as\nanother indication of a change of attitude towards metapsychical\nresearches on the part of some Roman Catholic circles. If ani-\nmosity there be, it is hardly apparent. It is but just to add\nthat such an attitude is, I believe, an exceptional one.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, December, 1928.\nDr. Siinner, the Editor, concludes his paper on the \" Psycho-\nmetric Gift of Frau Lotte Plaat,\" the second part being chiefly\ndevoted to six seances, which took place in Berlin in June last.\nThe results are summed up by Dr. S. as follows : 28 positive,\n5 negative, and 5 half-negative half-positive, Frau Plaat being\npromoted by him to the rank of one of the great \" psychic\n\fFebruary, 1939 Notes on Periodicals 35\nmediums.\" I confess to being unable to share in this en-\nthusiasm.\nProfessor Dr. Oskar Kraus describes two sittings in Prague with\nFrau M. Silbert, the first very briefly, the second in great detail.\nThe impression produced on me by these accounts is slightly more\nfavourable than is usually the case with this medium. On the\nother hand, Prof. Kraus admits himself (p. 728) that the conditions\n\" were not in accordance with the requirements of severe criticism.\"\nDr. Otto Seeling narrates briefly \" new successes \" obtained by\nFrau Hessel, the Leipzig clairvoyante. Corroboration is given in\nseveral cases, and some of the incidents described may be regarded\nas interesting.\nHerr Daniel Walter, of Graz, has a paper on Baron Lazar\nHellenhach (died in October 1887). A list of his works is given,\nand it is asserted that he saw a World War coming, and indicated\nthe final remedy to be in a League of Nations and in the people's\nright to self-determination. Chapter and verse are not given,\nunfortunately.\n\" Kleine Mitteilungen \" informs us of the death of Herr Max\nSelling, formerly a Professor of the University of Helsingfors, a\nwriter on matters psychical.\nDr. Marcinowski of Bad-Heilbronn brings to a close his paper\non \" Intuitive Chamkterdiagnosen \" begun in the October number\nof the Zeitschrift. Altogether forty-four delineations are given,\nbased on an intuitive \" grasping of the implications of people's\nhand-writing (this definition is my own and the writer would\npossibly object to it, since he explicitly states that Frau Anita\nPlette knows very little of graphology (p. 570) : in Dr. M.'s\nopinion we have to deal here with a form of supernormal know-\nledge which he calls Helhvissen).\nI confess to being not very much impressed by these delinea-\ntions, though I cannot help admiring Frau K.'s style. My reasons\nare the following : (a) we do not know whether the forty-four\n\" diagnostics \" represent the whole of Frau K.'s performances ;\n(6) we are told (p. 577) that she has had much less success in another\nbranch (when dealing with people's horoscopes) ;\n(c) many of the\ndelineations are not reproduced in toto (pp. 583, 587, 676, 677) ;\n(d) we have to rely almost exclusively if not exclusively on Dr.\nMarcinowski himself as to the degree of accuracy in the \" diag-\nnostics \" ;\n(e) we are told (p. 573) that sometimes the symbols\n\f36 Journal uf Society for Psychical iiesmrcA Febkuaky, 1929\nused by Frau K. in her descriptions refer to future events happen-\ning months later : the margin for fortuitously successful \" hits \" is\nthus considerably widened. Apart from these special considerations\nwe have general ones : such characteristics are somewhat like the\ncap that will fit many a head, and it is obvious on the other\nhand that often one and the same person may be characterized\nin a variety of ways. About this particular branch of Psychical\nResearch (and I am inclined to include in it many so-called\n\" psychometric '\"\ncases) there seems to me therefore to float a\nmist of vagueness and imprecision as dangerous as concrete cheat-\ning because so much less conspicuous. I am afraid it is one of\nthe most sterile branches. How much I prefer performances like\nthose of a Ludwig Kahn !\nRevue Metapsychique, November-December 1928.\nIt is significant that out of five papers in the strict sense\nof the word this number contains only two which may be con-\nsidered as dealing with our researches. For M. Andry-Bourgeois\ncontinues his series of articles on \" The Great Problems of Modern\nPhysics,\" which have with those researches no connection what-\never ; and Dr. C. G. Jung's lecture on \" The Structure of the\nSoul,\" delivered in Geneva in June last, has but a slender one.\nDr. Emile Pascal's paper on \" The Production of Somnambulism\nby Scopochloralose \" deals again with orthodox hypnosis. Dr.\nPascal has found that by combining 0.5 gram, of chloralose with\n0.7 milligr. of scopolamine hydrobromide deep sleep can be\ninduced ;\nthat if these doses are slightly increased a state of\nanaesthesia and suggestibility is obtained. Investigation along\nthese lines can, he thinks (and we think), be fruitful.\nM. R. A. Fleury demolishes the book of M. Piobb, Le Secret\nde Nostradamus, and irresistibly shows the extremely arbitrary\ncharacter of the Piobb methods. This article should be read in\nconnection with pp. 323-328 of Dr. R. Baerwald's OkkuUismus und\nSpiritismus, where the \" prophecies \" of the French seer supposed\nto bear on the French Revolution are disposed of in masterly\nfashion by Herr Richard Hennig. One remark of M. Fleury's is,\nhowever, somewhat perplexing : he is still of opinion that Nostra-\ndamus was a medium \" who was many times able to foresee the\nfuture \"\n(p. 502). To some readers this admission will appear\nas weakening to some extent M. Fleury's criticisms.\n\fFebroary, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 37\nM. Dureix, a Grenoble engineer, studies anew (cf. Revue Meta-\npsychique, 1926, No. 5) the question of premonition in gambling.\nThe experiments bear on Mme. Dureix's supposed ability to fore-\ntell winning numbers of the Monte Carlo roulette by drawing out\nof a basket pellets (altogether 37) on which different numbers\nhad been written by M. D. After a very detailed analysis of the\nresults, the latter is bound to admit that they are not decisive\nin favour of the clairvoyance hypothesis, though he is obviously\nimpressed by some of these results.\nWe need not insist on the difference between such experiments\nas those of M. Dureix and trials dealing with clairvoyant perception\nof cards drawn at random out of a pack, where we need not go\nbeyond an extension\u2014however extraordinary\u2014of our ability of\nacquiring knowledge. In the former case, on the contrary, we\nhave to postulate prophetic prevision of the future : a fact for\nwhich in my humble opinion we have no good evidence.\nThere is much to glean in M. Ch. Quartier's \" Metapsychics in\nPrance and Abroad.\" First of all there is a passage dealing with\nMme. Bisson and the late Dr. Geley (p. 523). The reader has\nthe impression that the Secretary of the Institut Metapsychique\nInternational says less than he would like to. Let us hope that\nM. Quartier's discreet allusion will soon be followed by a complete\ndisclosure (cf. \"'Notes on Periodicals\" in the .July and October\nJournal for 1928).\nM. Quartier notes incidentally when speaking of M. Paul Heuze's\nbook, La detestable plaisanterie des animaux calculateurs, that he\nsaw tables (gueridons) move without contact last summer (p. 529).\nMore details, please ! He also narrates briefly the experiments\nin \" thought-graphy \" (surely a very clumsy name) with some\nJapanese mediums of Dr. T. Fukurai, President of the Japanese\nPsychic Institute, Professor at Kohyasan (?) University.

M.\nJoad on \" Psychic Phenomena and an Interpretation of the\nUniverse.\" Assuming for the sake of argument the occurrence of\npsychic phenomena of various kinds Mr. Joad is concerned to see\n\" what our picture of the universe must be if it is going to\ninclude the possibility of these phenomena happening.\"\nA case is contributed by Mrs. McConnel in which some evidence\nconcerning a young man who lost his life in the sinking of the\nsubmarine Ml on November 12th, 1925, was given at a sitting with\nMiss Cummins. It ought to be clearly established (a fact which\nthe record appears to assume) that at the date of the sitting,\nNovember 20th, 1925, no statement as to the young man's death\nhad appeared in any of the papers.\nMrs. F. E. Leaning has \" A Report on a Series of Sjjontaneous\nTelepathic Impressions,\" in which \" the receiver \" is Miss Jane\nSamuels, with whom Mr. Hubert Wales experimented some years\nago (see Proc.

Mr. Price admits that\nas regards the majority of these visions there is no means of\nascertaining whether they have any basis in fact (they differ in\nvarious particulars from the traditional life of the Saint) ; he is,\nhowever, impressed by a coincidence between the death of St.\nAgnes as described by the psychic and the scene portrayed in an\nold Italian picture (the property of Mr. T. Vincent Lane) which\nhas recently been asserted by \" experts \" to be a representation\nof the death of St. Agnes.\nM. Sudre has an article entitled \" A New Martian Romance and\nan Old One,\" in which he gives some account of the famous\ncase of Helene Smith as described by Flournoy in \" Des Indes a\nla Planete Mars,\" and draws an analogy between this case and\nthe recent claim of Dr. Mansfield Robinson to be in psychic\nrapport with Mars, a claim which he has unsuccessfully tried to\nsubstantiate by establishing wireless communication with that planet.\nThere is a further instalment of the Report on \" Teleplasmic\nThumbprints \"'\nby E.

In addition to the voice-phenomena some very\nremarkable apports were observed ; these are attributed to the\nmediumship of Madame Fabienne Rossi, one of the sitters. With-\nout impugning the good faith of any of those present, it may be\nnoted that no scientific conclusions can possibly be drawn from\nobservations made under such lax and uncertain conditions.\n\" As is usual in the case of Direct Voice Seances the room was\nin the most total darkness \"\n(p. 286), neither the room nor the\nsitters were ever searched, nor, so far as is apparent from the\nrecord, was any attempt ever made to control the sitters' move-\nments.\nAmong the \" spirit-voices \" heard were those of Eusapia Pal-\nladino and Rabelais, but it is admitted that in the case of\nRabelais his personal identity was not clearly established.\nH. de G.

Treasurer, Mr. W. H. Salter, in presenting the\nFinancial Statement, which is printed on pp. 46-48, referred\nto the two legacies received by the Society during the past\nyear of \u00a3500 from J\\Irs. Smithson and \u00a3200 from Miss\nSimmonds.\nDuring the year the Society had paid the balance of the\nexpenditure connected with the re-organisation of the Library.\nHe had issued an appeal for subscriptions to the amount of\n\u00a3400, in order that as little as possible of the cost of re-\norganisation should fall on the Society's General Funds, and\nhe was rather disappointed that the total amount received in\nresponse to this appeal was only \u00a3180, including subscriptions\nreceived diiring 1927. The subscription list was still open\nand he hoped that a liberal response would be made to this\nfurther appeal.\nHe would also be glad to see further donations towards the\nSociety's Research Fund which was now reduced to \u00a3210. It\nwas important that the Society should have a good reserve\nin hand in order that it might promptly avail itself of any\nopportunity for research which might occur. The Society's\nfinancial position was, speaking generally, quite sound, but the\nordinary income of the Society was not sufficient to enable it\nto pursue that active policy of research which the Council and\nOfficers of the Society, and the Society as a whole desired,\nimless supplemented by special donations.\nIn the discussion which followed, Mr. Dingwall, Mr. Salter\nand Mr. Besterman took part.\nThe Meeting then proceeded to the election of Members of\nCouncil.\nThe Chairman announced that the six retiring Members of\nCouncil offered themselves for re-election. No other nomina-\ntions having been received, the following were declared to be\nduly elected Members of the Council : Mr. Bousfield, K.C.,\nProfessor E. R. Dodds, the Hon. Everard Feilding, Mr. J. G.\nPiddingt,on, Dr. F. C. S. Schiller and Dr. M. B. Wright.\n\fMarch, 1929 Extraordinary General Meetiny 45\nEXTRAOEDINAKY GENERAL MEETING OF MEMBERS.\nOn the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, the Extra-\nordinary General Meeting convened for the same day was held,\nThe President being in the chair. The same Members were\npresent as at the General Meeting with the exception of Lord\nLeigh who had to leave, but with the addition of Mrs. Thesiger.\nThe Notice convening the Meeting was read by the Secretary.\nThe Chairman made a short explanatory statement as to the\nreasons which had made it desirable to lay before the Society\nfor its approval and adoption a revised form of Articles of\nAssociation.\nThe Resolution set out in the notice was moved by the\nChairman and seconded by Mr. Bousfield.\nMr. Dingwall moved and Mr. Brown seconded the following\namendment\n:\nAmendment to Article 29 : In place of the words :\n\" Then\nsuch persons shall be deemed elected as shall obtain the\nhighest number of votes in accordance with the provisions\nof Article 44 \" shall be substituted the words :\n\" Then\nsuch persons shall be deemed elected as shall obtain the\nhighest number of votes by numbered voting papers,\ncontaining the names of those eligible for election, sent to\nall the Members of the Society at least 14 days prior to\nthe meeting.\"\nA discussion followed in which Colonel Maxwell Dick, Dr.\nV. J. WooUey, Mr. S. C. Scott, Mr. E. N. Bennett and Mr.\nW. H. Salter took part, and the amendment was put to the\nmeeting. On a show of hands there appeared in favour of\nthe amendment, 10 ;\nagainst the amendment, 28 Members.\nThe amendment was therefore declared lost.\nIn the further discussion on the original resolution set out\nin the notice convening the meeting, various Members, in-\ncluding Mr. Dingwall and Mr. Summerson, took part.\nThe original Resolution was then put to the Meeting and\non a show of hands there appeared in favour of the Resolution,\n34 ;\nagainst the Resolution, 6 Members.\nThe Resolution was therefore declared carried by the requisite\nmajority.\n\fo o o z> 00 1-H o O o 01 o o\n1-H\no o 01 o o o OT\nCO o\no 00 00 o o o iH\nCO\nI\u2014\n1\nCI 1\u2014\n1\nI\u2014I \u00bb\u2014\nI\n00\nI\u2014\n<\nCI C^I CO\n1\u2014\n1\nCO\nI\u2014\n<\nX rH\no\n\u00a3843\no\nCI\nCD o o\n00 t-\nT\u2014\n(\n(N CO\n00\ni>\nOi\n1\/5\n1-1\nin CI CO c;\nCl\no CJ 01 I\u2014\n'\nCO 1-H\n\u2014 CD\n^co\n1-H\ni|r\n= 11 -3\nI,- -V ^\no ^\nK, \u00bb ?\ns\nPh\n>>\nM\ngo\nCZ3\nft ci nj\ns I\nirH frt\nh4 o\nto ><\nE -\no P\n^ C3\n^ O\no\n. cs a\n-a\nc .\nS\n\" o\nSi !s c\npp p;\nQ = ti\nQj fc- oj rt\nf4 O P=l\n= c .2\nH E-i CO oj H <!\n1.\n\u00a7\u2022\nP\nCO P. ^\n\u00a33\n(-1\no\no :a\n^ .2 M\nOC rH\n>-H rH\na Oi 00 lO\n00 00 OJ\ni> iH CO CJ\nS o\nPh T3\no\no\n3 CO\nS \"3 W\n<\u00a3 ts S S -S\n5 \u00ab C) O O fi\n\u201e o\n3 E\n\u00b0 P4\n\u00a3 ..

The place, Athens, was selected at the 1927 Congress at\nParis, which also appointed an International Committee, consisting\nof Sir Oliver Lodge, Professor Richet, Dr. Driesch, Mr. Carl Vett\n(Secretary to the Congresses) and Dr. Tanagras, the President of\nthe Hellenic S.P.R., to arrange the programme and ensure that\nall branches of Psychical Research were adequately covered by\npapers from competent researchers.\nThe Hellenic S.P.R. is comparatively young, but under Dr.\nTanagras' able leadership, has shewn great energy, and may be\ntrusted to perform the duties of hospitality to everyone's satis-\nfaction.\nPsychical Research is a subject in which International co-\noperation is not easy. Different countries approach it in very\ndifferent ways. The Congresses have done not a little to promote\nunderstanding between students all over the world, and the level\nof discussion at the Congresses has steadily risen. It is to be\nhoped that our Members will do everything in their power to\nmake the Athens Congress a success.\nIn particular it is hoped that a good number of English students\nwill attend the Congress, more than at Paris, where disappointingly\nfew put in an appearance. It is understood that arrangements\nwill be made to enable those attending the Athens Congress to\nmake excursions to other parts of Greece. It is not too early to\nbegin making plans now.\nFurther information as to exact dates, routes, fares, etc., will\nbe given later.\nA BEQUEST TO OUR READERS FOR INFORMATION.\nAt an anonymous sitting with Mrs. Warren Elliott on 1 7th\nJune, 1927, and again at an anonymous sitting with Mrs.\nDowdall at Cardiff on November 1 7th, 1927, the following\nstatements were made to the same sitter concerning the same\nostensible communicator.\n(I) Tliat he used to read \" funny writing, like no letters at\nall, looks like shorthand but it isn't that.\"\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research M4rch, 1929\n(2) That he was interested in the stars.\n(3) There was associated with him someone called Gerald or\nGeraldine.\n(4) This Gerald or Geraldine was interested in music.\nThis forms an excellent correspondence, but the statements are\nnot veridical of the apparent communicator and the sitter is\nnot able to trace any connection whatsoever.\nIf any reader can throw any light on this matter or knows\nof any person of whom the statements would be true, will\nthey be good enough to communicate with the Society's\nSecretary, 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C.I.\n\" LIFE BEYOND DEATH WITH EVIDENCE.\"\nBy a. W. Trethewy.\nThe purpose of this article is to discuss how far the cases\nquoted by Mr. Drayton Thomas in his book mentioned above\nsupport the spiritistic against the animistic explanation of\npsychic phenomena, which is the main object of the book. In\nsome respects this work resembles Dr. Osty's Supernormal\nFaculties of Man, translated by Mr. de Brath, London, 1923 ;\nboth authors quote cases in favour of their views on the\ngenesis of the phenomena, and deal solely with the mental\nclass. Dr. Osty, though he does not deny human survival,\ndoes not believe in communication from discarnate spirits, but\nhis object is to prove the reality of the phenomena and the\nadequacy of his explanation, not to disprove the theories of\nspiritists. He would presumably explain Mr. Drayton Thomas's\ncases on the same lines as his own, even if he had to extend\nthose lines to embrace the facts.\n2. With some sensitives supernormal cognition purports to\nbe independent of the agency of discarnate spirits, the sensitive\niu a conscious state does not believe that he is subject to such\ninfluences, and there is no external personality which professes\nto direct his clairvoyance or other form of subconscious activity.\nIt is not impossible that in such a case there is some discar-\nnate spirit in the background directing operations but con-\ncealing his part in it, and this may be the opinion of some\n\fMarch, 1929 \" Life Beyond Death with Evidence \" 51\nspiritualists. Similarly some sceptics interpret cases which, have\na spiritistic setting as due to subliminal dramatisation. In the\npresent state of our knowledge it is wiser to recognise both\ncauses as hypothetically possible, and to classify the phenomenon\naccording to the interpretation which seems the more appro-\npriate to the facts, or to mark it as doubtful if the two\nexplanations are equally plausible. The tendency to strain\none theory to cover the whole field should be strongly resisted.\nI therefore discuss only those of Mr. Drayton Thomas's cases\nwhich are most convincing from his point of view, that is to\nsay, seem to bear the impress of an external mind. Several\ncases will claim inclusion because they contain information\nwhich apparently has come from a deceased person. The\ninformation must be knowledge not imagination, truth not\nfiction ; there must be corroboration. Perhaps search has to be\nmade for some object, and if it is successful the alternative\nto giving the credit to the deceased is to attribute the result\nto the medium's clairvoyance. How much scope it is reason-\nable to concede to the latter agency may be a matter of\nopinion. Or verification may have to be obtained by question-\ning some living person, the alternative here will be the reading\nof that person's memories through the sitter by the medium\nas alleged by Dr. Osty for some of his cases.\n3. The medium in every case recorded in Mr. Drayton\nThomas's book was Mrs. Osborne Leonard whose \" Control\n\"\nis Feda. The principal communicators were the author's father\nand sister Etta, both deceased, and it is their identity which\nis the main theme of the book.\n4. Omitting several incidents narrated in the first four\nchapters which would deserve mention if there were not so\nmuch matter of greater significance, I come to the case of\nSymonds versus Sinomons on pp. 47-51. The author asked his\nfather at a sitting to give for evidential purposes some facts\nabout one Symmonds. He mentioned his mother in this\nconnection because she first met his father at Symmonds's\nhouse. At a subsequent sitting his father stated some facts\nabout another man Simmons which the author first took to\nrefer to Symmonds, but he discovered his mistake later. It is\ncertainly a strong point against the mind reading hypothesis\n\f52 Jotirval of Society for Psychical Research March, 1929\nthat owing to the two names having the same sound his\nquestion should be misunderstood and he should be given\ninformation about a man not in his thoughts, including one\nitem, about Mrs. Savery's death, which meant nothing to him\ntill he had referred to Simmons's daughter, p. 48. It seems\nincredible that the medium can have got the facts from any-\nbody's mind as there was no thought to initiate the rapport.\n5. The communication about the purse on pp. 71, 72 seems\nto have really come from his father, who said that an old purse\nof his had been kept by his widow (the author's mother).\nShe was questioned and at first denied having it, but was\nurged to make a further search and then found a purse\ncorresponding with the description. Dr. Osty would probably\nexplain this incident by attributing it to Feda's clairvoyance\n(regarding Feda as a secondary personality of Mrs. Leonard)\nor her power to read the mother's mind through the sitter\n(the author). Such an explanation seems very far fetched in\nthe absence of any clue to the guidance which directed Feda\nto the purse. This seems to me the strongest case mentioned\nin Part I. of Chapter VIIL, but the others are well worth\nreading, though the author might have discussed Feda's clair-\nvoyance on p. 75 as well as telepathy.\n6. The case of the cousin's son on pp. 86, 87 is an important\none. The boy died in Canada and his father wrote to the\nauthor about it, who at his own house mentally asked his\ncommunicators about the boy's present condition, suggesting\nthat he was probably with his grandfather also deceased. At\nthe next sitting they gave details which they said they had\ngot from the grandfather and which were subsequently verified\nthrough the boy's father. It is hardly credible that Feda knew\nof the author's mental request in his study, or of the letter\nwhich prompted it, and that this knowledge enabled her to\nread the mind of the boy's father.^\n7. The next case in the book, p. 87, that of Miss Sands, is\nalso important. She had lost her mother and asked the author\nif he could help her to get a message from the deceased. He\nwas thinking of arranging a sitting for her with Mrs. Leonard\n' Neither this child, his father or grandfather had been named at any\nprevious sitting. \u2014C. D. T.\n\fMarch, 1929 \" Life Beyond Death with Evidence\n\"\n53\nwhen at a sitting of his own Feda referred to the matter,\nspeaking for his father, and said that Mrs. Sands had been to\nsee her daughter who had some trouble with her eyes. This\nstatement about the eyes turned out to be correct. The\nquestion is whether the author's cormnunicators, who had\nknown Mrs. Sands well on earth, had been in touch with her\nand thus foimd out her daughter's condition, or as an alterna-\ntive Feda had got into rapport with Miss Sands' subliminal\nthrough the author, found out the trouble with the eyes and\nput the information into the mouths of the communicators.^\n8. The author's remarks on p. 88 about discarnate spirits\nknowing more about the thoughts than the material surround-\nings of hxmian beings would be interpreted by Dr. Osty as\nbased on the fact that mediums find mind reading easier than\nclairvoyance.\"\n9. The case of Eicketts, pp. 91, 92, is somewhat similar to\nthe last, but there is one important difference. The author's\nfather introduced the subject by referring to one Eicketts still\n^ On receiving Miss Sands' letter I asked my communicators at a sitting\nto help in the matter, telHng them the name. At a subsequent sitting many\nevidential messages were given for Miss Sands. It was after this that I\nfirst thought of inviting her to attend a sitting, and received the information\nabout her eyes. At this date I had not met Miss Sands for thirty years,\nbut Mrs. Sands had spent some hours with us a few years before her death.\n\u2014C. D. T.\n2 If, as suggested by Dr. Osty, mediums find in mind reading an easy\nsource of information, it is difficult to account for the following facts which\nI constantly observe with Mrs. Leonard\n:\n1. The frequent failure to give names, or words, which I am expecting\nand which seem required for completion of the subject in hand. Such words\nare more easily given when relating to something unknown to me or unex-\npected.\n2. Particular items which one anticipates as likely to be given are often\npassed over in favour of others which come as a surprise to me.\n3. Considerable experience in taking notes for first-time sitters shows that\nmessages often come from imexpected communicators to the exclusion of the\ndesired communicators. Sometimes the wished-for person is finally asked\nfor by sitters, but in that case he rarely comes to the front, and, if\ncommunicating at all, appears to be doing it through one of those who\nhave been previously speaking. It suggests to me that Feda cannot get a\ngood rapport with him and prefers to hold on to a previous speaker rather\nthan risk changing over to a direct contact with him. Sometimes, however,\nthe wished-for person is said not to be present.\u2014C. D. T.\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Makch, 1929\nalive whom he had not known on earth, but whom the author\nknew well, and saying that Ricketts had lost a relation about\ntwo years ago. The author had not known of the death, but\nverified it. The author's father said that he had got the\ninformation from Ricketts's unconscious mind. This was\nprobably its source, and the question is whether the communi-\ncator got it or Feda got it through the author.^\n10. The case of the bag, pp. 99-101, is of a similar type.\nHis sister Etta asked at a sitting whether their mother had\nrecently received as a gift a bag which she described The\nmother knew nothing of it when questioned, but received the\nbag subsequently. Etta's explanation is that the giver's thought\nreached the mother's subconscious mind where it was found by\nEtta, enabling her to predict the gift. The alternative theory\nis that Feda, getting into rapport with his mother through the\nauthor, foimd the knowledge in her mind on the transcendental\nplane. (Dr. Osty's phrase.)\n11. Some cases of a diiTerent type follow, in which the\ncommtmicators told the author that they had seen discarnate\nspirits and gave him information about them, previously\nunknown to him, see pp. 101 et seq. The best of these relates\nto his visit to Manchester, p. 102. He had spent an hour\nthere on a visit to a psychic student, and at the next seance\nafter his return home his father mentioned having seen the\nspirit of a boy Tom at that house. A reference to the\nstudent elicited the reply that there was a Tom whom the\ndescription fitted and who since his decease had frequently\ncommunicated with the family. The alternative to accepting\nthe author's father's story is to suppose that Feda got into\ntouch with the student's mind through the author, sensed his\nfeelings about Tom and dramatised the situation. The case of\nthe Americans on pp. 101, 102 hardly admits of such an\nalternative, but it might be argued that Feda got into touch\nwith them through the author and read in their minds the\nstories that mediums had told them. The information about\nthe case is however too vague, and the author's knowledge of the\nAmericans too slight, for much stress to be laid on the incident.\n1 This name had not been mentioned before nor had it been at all pro-\nminent in my mind.\u2014C. D. T.\n\fMarch, 1929 \" Life Beyond Death with Evidence\n\"\n55\n12. In the Salisbuiy case, pp. 103, 104, the author's father\nsaid that one Salisbury, recently deceased and unknown to him\non earth, wished to be remembered to the author's mother and\nstated that he had been interested in old magazines. It was\nknown that a man of this name slightly acquainted with the\nmother had recently died, but nothing about his hobby for old\nmagazines, a fact which was subsequently verified by enquiry.\nThe commimicator's story seems more probable than the theory\nthat Feda being in touch with the mother through the author\ngot somehow through her on to Salisbury's old memories. It\nis hard to eliminate Salisbury's spirit from the picture.\n13. In the medallion case, pp. 104, 105, a widower attended\na seance with the author and succeeded in getting into touch\nwith his wife. At the next seance the author's father said\nthat the wife had told him of the discovery of a medallion.\nReference was made to the husband who had not then heard\nanything about it, but afterwards learnt that his mother-in-\nlaw, who had recently changed her house, had found the\narticle, and that it had stood in his wife's room before her\nmarriage to him. Feda's clairvoyance might conceivably have\nbeen the agency for the discovery, but the chain linking her\nwith the mother-in-law and the wife's property is very weak.\n14. In spite of his arguments in Chapter XI. the author\napparently recognises that book-tests may be ascribed to the\nmedium's clairvoyance and therefore attaches more weight to\nnewspaper tests,^ p. 138. The procedure described there is so\nwell known that the description need not be repeated here.\nThe test containing \" Shooter's Hill,\" p. 139, is a good instance.\nThis was the name which fitted the \" light \" (in an acrostic\nsense)\n\u2014\" an address suggesting being on a hill \" reminding the\ncommunicator of a place where he had lived and \" acquired\na different official standing.\" He had lived on a hill at\nr Ilfracombe and had there been given the post of District\nSecretary.\n^ There have been certain book tests for which I find no possible explana-\ntion in the medium's clairvoyance, however far extended. One example is\nthat quoted on pages 23-27 of my former book, Some New Evidence for\nHuman Survival. It relates to my father's memories of Toddington, and,\nas I consider, contains good evidence for his identity.\u2014C. D. T.\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Maech, 1929\n15. On pp. 139, 140 is the \"May\" test. In a particular\npart of the page is to be found a name \" like that of people\nwith whom your mother has recently renewed friendship.\" A\nreference to his mother elicited the fact that an old friend, a\nMrs. May, had recently revisited the town. Search was then\nmade for the name May and it was found at the indicated place.\n16. On pp. 142-144 is the Ray case. The author was told\nto look for the name of a man just dead about whom he had\nbeen talking lately. He could not think who was meant, but\non coming home that evening heard that a Mr. Ray had died\nwhose name would fit the test. The next day's Times contains\nthe word \" Ray \" in the described place. At the next sitting\nhe tried to get the name through Feda, but she could not say\nit, and he argues from the failure that she cannot read his\nmind readily, so he discounts this explanation of her powers in\nother types of cases.\n17. On pp. 145, 146 is the Poole and Streatham case, these\nnames fitted the direction to look for the name of an old friend\nof the author's wife and of a place associated with the friend.\nThe information about Streatham may have been drawn by\nhis communicators from the wife's mind, as they probably did\nnot know it in their lifetime.\n18. On pp. 149-151 are a number of instances of facts stated\nin connection with newspaper tests, which facts were within\nthe knowledge of the communicator when on earth but were not\nall of them known by the author. These pages deserve study.\n19. These tests depend on some kind of predictive clair-\nvoyance, a process with which it is equally difficult to credit\nFeda or the communicators, but the knowledge of the past\nwhich the tests fit could have been obtained by her only by\ndrawing on the minds of the author and his mother. That\nall this wealth of detail concerning forgotten occurrences could\nhave been available to her in this way pari passu with the\nforecasting of the next day's paper is almost inconceivable,\nwhereas it seems natural that the communicators with their\nmemories at hand may have had events recalled by the entries\nin the paper.\n20. In Chapter XV. the author gives some reasons for\nconsidering Feda to be \" an individual quite distinct from the\n\fMarch, 1929 \" Life Beyond Death with Evidence\n\"\n57\nmedium thxougli whom she speaks,\" p. 165. On p. 163 he\ntells a story of her having spoken to Mrs. Leonard at a direct\nvoice seance, giving Mrs. Leonard a message for him which\nshe (Feda) subsequently expanded at his next sitting with\nMrs. Leonard. It does not seem likely, though in the present\nstate of knowledge it is rash to declare it impossible, that if\nFeda is a secondary personality of Mrs. Leonard they can talk\nto each other when Mrs. Leonard is sitting with another\nmedium. On p. 164 there is a rather intricate account of\nFeda's messages about a cat. Feda spoke about it through\nMrs. Leonard and in the absence of Mrs. Leonard at a sitting\nfor direct voice. It would be interesting to know what Mrs.\nLeonard was doing at the time of that seance, but unfor-\ntunately even the date seems to have been forgotten. In\nChapter XIX. the author mentions other incidents which\npoint to Feda being quite independent of his commimicators.\nThere have been occasions on which his father was trying to\ntell him something through Feda which she could not grasp\nthough he himself could guess what liis father wished to con-\nvey. On p. 191 he says that he has heard Feda whispering\nto his father before begimiing her opening remarks and has\ncaught references to topics afterwards discussed at the sitting. This\nresembles a natural occurrence rather than a dramatised fiction.\n21. The author has some chapters on the process of com-\nmunication as described by Feda and the communicators. Dr.\nOsty also discusses this subject, but deals at greater length\nwith the source from which in his opinion metagnomic\npercipience draws information and with the conditions and\nlimitations of its action. His remarks on these points may to\na great extent be accepted tentatively by those spiritualists\nwho believe that the operating agency is always the medium's\npowers and that the spirits' part, where there is spirit influence,\nis mainly the direction and guidance of those powers. Ac-\ncording to the animistic theory the part attributed to spirits\nis really taken by the medium consciously or subconsciously\nor by a secondary personality or some complex of the medium\nand sitter. Absolute proof is impossible in the present state\nof knowledge, but in the cases quoted, and indeed in many\nothers narrated in Mr. Drayton Thomas's book, appearances\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March, 1929\ncertainly seem to favour the spiritistic explanation. The author\nlays great stress on the realistic aspect of the three person-\nalities, Feda, his father, and his sister. The situation seems to\nextend beyond any field that may reasonably be assigned to\nsubliminal dramatisation.\n22. Dr. Osty on p. 114 of his work regards spiritualistic\npractices as simply facilitating the conditions for the exercise\nof metagnomic powers in a similar way to the effect of hyp-\nnotism or crystal gazing. He considers that mediums mistake\n\" the mental hallucinatory image of the deceased for a real\nphantasmal manifestation,\" p. 133, and that one of his\nspiritualist percipients mimics the gestures of the deceased in\na way that simulates possession, pp. 156, 157. He holds that\n\" controls \" owe their origin to the subconsciousness of the\nmedium which fabricates a fixed or variable personality, pp.\n202, 203. His view about communications concerning\nthe conditions of the after-life is that they are based on the\noriginal mistake of the medium in regarding a hallucinatory\nimage as real. \" The percipient speaks to his apparition\n(which is an excellent way of getting information upon it) and\nhe attributes the mental informing images that he gets in reply\nto conscious inspiration from the dead. Hence too come those\ndialogues between mediums and defunct entities which often\nresult in supernormal cognitions, but more often in mediocre\nromances on the after-life \"\n(p. 133).\nHe does not explain the inconsistency on the part of the\nmedium in giving true information about the earth life of the\ndeceased and nothing but fiction about his fate after death.\nIf one set of statements contains truth why should the other\nbe disbelieved in whole 1 There is striking unanimity between\n\" defunct ''\nentities in statements of the latter kind ; that\nsimilar descriptions have been given in many countries through\nmediums of many races and many periods is a strong point in\ntheir favour. Nor does Dr. Osty take account of mediums\nimder control speaking or writing foreign languages normally\nunknown to them or of their displaying intellectual powers and\ntechnical knowledge far beyond their normal capacity.\n23. Dr. Osty does not give cases to illustrate his views of\nthe fiction underlying spiritistic phenomena. Incidentally he\n\fM ABCH, 192;) \" Life Beyond Death, with Evidence\n\"\n59\nmentions one of his own experiences on pp. 127, 128. A\ndeceased person was correctly described by a spiritualistic\nmedium and when asked for proof of identity said that Dr.\nOsty had stopped his smoking. In a foot-note the Doctor\nsays that if the communicator had really been the deceased\nhe could have given much better evidence. But the remark\nabout smoking was true, and any better point that might have\nbeen made would have come from the same source and might\nhave been discounted by him on the lines of the arguments\nin his book. According to Chap. XVII. of Mr. Drayton\nThomas's book communicators are apt to forget many of their\nearth memories during a seance.\n24. Dr. Osty does not allude to the colour given to the\nspiritistic theory by phenomena of other kinds than those\nwhich he describes ; for instance, direct voice and supernormal\nphotography. In fact, as far as his book shows, he has not\nstudied the question sufficiently to be justified in giving a\npositive opinion. He has done valuable work in showing that\nthe mental phenomena which he has observed are really\ngenuine and in elaborating theories which account for them up\nto a certain point. But until his material embraces other\nkinds of psychic phenomena, and he pays adequate attention\nto the strongest points of the spiritistic case, researchers who\ndiffer from him will not attach weight to his decision against\nspiritualism. There is another matter on which he may see\nfit to modify his opinion. In several passages of his book he\nhas expressed himself unfavourably towards researchers with\nspiritualistic views and seems to regard them as unscientific.\nIf he ever reads Mr. Drayton Thomas's book he will perhaps\nacknowledge that it is a record of useful and critical work.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\" The Scripts of Cleophas.\"\nTo the Editor of The Journal of the S.P.K.\nDear Madam,\u2014With reference to your reviewer's comment on\nThe Scripts of Cleophas (Journal, vol. xxiv. p. 394).\nThe title of \" politaich \" occurs in a well-known inscription,\nBrit.

Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing first\nbecame known in this country for his work in connexion with\n\fApril, 1929 Obituary Notices 65\nhypnotism and therapeutic suggestion, later becoming interested\nin the mental phenomena of psychical research. In 1891 he\ncontributed to the Society's Proceedings, Vol. VIL, a very\ninteresting paper on \" Experimental Studies in Thought-\nTransference.\"\nIn the latter part of his life, however, he was almost ex-\nclusively interested in physical phenomena, and became the\nprotagonist in Germany of the school of thought which affirms\nthe reality of these phenomena. He had a wide experience\nwith many physical mediums, particularly Eva C. and Willi\nand Kudi Schneider. He was the author of numerous books\non hvpnotism. abnormal psychology, and psychical research, of\nwhich the best known are Materialisations-Phaenomene (1914 ;\n2nd enlarged edition, 1923) ;\nPhysikalische Phaenomene des\nMediumismus (1920) ;\nExperimente der Fembewegung (1924).\nThis phase of his activity is represented in the Society's Pro-\nceedings by an article, \" Concerning the Possibility of Decep-\ntion in Sittings with Eva C,\" Vol. XXXIII. Several of his\nbooks have been translated into English, French, and other\nlanguages.\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing was a prominent figure at the\nvarious International Congresses for Psychical Research and\nexercised his great influence to ensure that these Congresses\nshould be truly international. Those of our Members who\nattended the first International Congress at Copenhagen, held\nshortly after the war. will have the most pleasant recollections\nof his dignified courtesy. On various occasions he and his\nwife extended hospitality to Members of this Society visiting\nMimich and gave them facilities for observing phenomena in\nhis well-equipped laboratory. It was as a result of the obser-\nvations made by Mr. E. J. Dingwall in this laboratory in 1922\nthat Willi Schneider was invited to come to this country and\ngave the series of sittings reported on in Proceedings, Vol.\nXXXVI. More recently in the autumn of 1928 Dr. von\nSchrenck-Xotzing invited various Members of the Society,\nincluding the Hon. Research Officer, Dr. WooUey, to a series\nof sittings at which they had an opportunity of studying the\ningenious electrical apparatus designed by the late Karl Krall\nfor the automatic control of physical mediums.\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1929\nConcerning Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing's position in Germany\nProfessor Hans Driesch writes as follows :\nHis influence upon psychical research has been very great in\nthis country, he has been the most popular representative of this\nscience. And his sincerity has never been doubted, though there\nare a good many who believe that he has probably been deceived\nin the first period of his investigations (Eva. C). During his\nwork with the Schneiders his methods were continuously improved\nand, as far as I can judge, are almost perfect now.\nIn any case Baron Schrenck has been a man who occupies quite\na definite and prominent place in the history of science.\nMr. Francis W. Percival.\nWe regret to note the death of Mr. Francis W. Percival, who\nwas associated with the Society in its very early years and\nwas one of the original members of Council named in the\nConstitution of 1882.\nCASE.\nP. 297. An Apparently Premonitory Apparition.\nThe following paragraph appeared in the Daily Express for\nJanuary 19, 1929, under the heading \" Premonition of Death.\"\nA remarkable instance of a premonition of death has occurred\nat Worcester.\nMr. W. Kent, of Foley Road, Worcester, manager for many\nyears of a large furniture shop here, left his work on Monday,\nafter saying to his head salesman that he would die this week.\nHe said that he was sleeping in the bed in which his wife\ndied shortly before Christmas. He awakened in the night.\n\" When I woke up I saw my wife,\" said Mr. Kent according\nto the salesman. \" She seemed quite happy. She beckoned to\nme, walked across the room and vanished.\n\"I knew what she meant.\"\nMr. Kent died a few days later.\nOn January 23rd, 1929, Mrs. Brackenbury wrote to the special\ncorrespondent of the Daily Express at Worcester, asking if she\n\fApril, 1929 Case 67\ncould be put into touch with the head salesman mentioned in\nthe above paragraph. Eventually Mrs. Brackenbury obtained\nfrom the salesman, Mr. Barker, the following statement\n:\nJan. 29th, 1929.\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 28th inst., and should\nonly be too pleased to offer you any assistance I can, as I am\nmyself greatly interested in your Society. The article in the\nDaily Express was not quite correct and I informed them so.\nI was a personal friend of Mr. Kent and have known him, also\nMrs. Kent, for 5 years. The full story would take me too long\nto write. He did not make any statement that he would die\nat any stated time. When he was a young man he had an\nattack of rheumatic fever, this left him with a displaced heart.\nHe was healthy in every respect, except, that he always took\nlife seriously and quietly; he was a very good living man, but\ndid not visit any place of worship, although he was a very\nlearned man as regards scripture, and could quote any problem,\nand practically any sentence from the Bible ; he like myself was\na member of the Loyal Orange Institution, also the Grand Black\nChapter, and a Freemason. He met his wife a then school-\nmistress in Huddersfield, and they were married 36 years ago\nlast Xmas Eve. They have always lived a life of devotion to\neach other, and solely and wholly for each other. Mrs. Kent\ndied just before Xmas, after 11 weeks illness, from diseased nerves.\nBefore she died she asked him not to be long before he followed\nher, and stated she would come to him. He told me every day\nduring her illness that if she died he would soon follow her.\nAfter her death he bucked up tremendously, and I have never\nknown him to be so happy and cheerful. And I may state\nhere that I was in his full confidence and his friend, to whom\nhe always opened his heart.\nOn Monday, Jan. 14th, we arrived at business together at\n9 a.m., and he seemed upset, and told me the following story :\nHe said since Mrs. Kent's death he had lain in the same bed\nin the same room and always kept a nice fire (this is the front\ndownstairs sitting-room), he was lying wide awake for some time,\nand about 2 a.m., Monday 14th, he heard the plain rustle of a\nwoman's skirt, he turned his head towards the door and was\nsurprised to see Mrs. Kent walk into the room.\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apkil, 1929\nShe walked straight to the fireplace, he watched her for a\nfew seconds, and then got out of bed and went to her, as he\nreached the fireplace she vanished.\nHaving finished his story he turned to me and said, \" Mr.\nBarker, it is a premonition, she has come for me.\" This he\nrepeated twice again to me during the morning. The rest of\nthe day we were kept very busy together with business, until\n6.30 p.m., when he left me, very cheerful indeed and apparently\nin the best of health. At 10.15 p.m. the same night he was\nseized with a sudden heart attack. I was not able to see him,\nas he was too ill, until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday 20th. I found\nhim very ill, but greatly improved from the attack. He said\nto me, \" Oh, Mr. Barker, I'm going, Mary came for me Sunday\nnight.\" I laughed this off, and the next few minutes he told\nme he would be back at work after a few days rest. On the\nsame afternoon about 4 p.m. he had another sudden attack,\nfollowed by still another heart attack at 4 a.m., Thursday 21st,.\nfrom which he never recovered.\nMr. Kent had no children and does not leave any friends tO'\nwhom you could communicate. . . . His full name was Thomas\nKent, age 64. . . . George S. Barker.\nIt will be seen from Mr. Barker's statement that there is nO'\nclear evidence here of anything prophetic. Mrs. Kent's sugges-\ntion to her husband, shortly before her death that he should\njoin her before long, would be likely to rouse in Mr. Kent's\nmind an idea that his own death might not be much delayed,\nand obviously in the case of a man suffering from a misplaced\nheart an additional strain or shock of any kind, such as the\nloss of his wife, might be just sufficient to bring on an attacks\nIt is possible that Mr. Kent's vision of his wife in the early\nmorning of January 14th was due entirely to his wife's sug-\ngestion that she would \" come to him.\" But it seems equally\nlikely that the vision was partly due to the externalisation of\nsome subconscious knowledge in Mr. Kent's mind as to his own\nprecarious physical condition and the imminence of a severe\nheart attack.\nWhatever the true explanation may be, the case is interesting^\nand instructive, psychologically, if not psychically, aud is there-\nfore worth putting on record here.\n\fApkil, 1929 Reviews 69\n'\n' KEVIEWS.\nI. The Evidential Value of Certain Mediumistic Phenomena. By\nE. J. Dingwall. Psyche, October 1928.\nThis article is in fact an attack on the work of a group (as\nMr. Dingwall calls it) of S.P.R. workers who have published\nsomewhat largely in our Proceedings, but whose methods as\npsychical researchers have not had the good fortune to meet\nwith Mr. Dingwall's approval. The particular cases he has\nselected for comment seem to be three in number : (a) A series\nof cross-correspondences expounded by Mr. J. G. Piddington in\na paper entitled \" One Crowded Hour of Glorious Life \" (see\nProceedings, vol. xxxvi. p. 345) ; (6) a case called The One-\nHorse Dawn Experiment,\" begun as an experiment in thought-\ntransference, but with some curious developments (see Mrs. Verrall's\noriginal account, Proceedings, vol. xx. and subsequent papers by\nMr. Piddington and Sir Oliver Lodge in Proceedings, vol. xxx.\npp. 175, 291, and 296) ; and (c) the experiments in thought-\ntransference of Professor Gilbert Murray {Proceedings, xxix. p. 64,\nand xxxiv. pp. 212, 336\u2014I myself being responsible for the\nediting of the two later series). I give these references fully\nbecause I do not propose to discuss Mr. Dingwall's article in\ndetail, but should advise any persons interested in the subject,\nnot to be satisfied with his somewhat sketchy and inadequate\naccounts of the evidence, but to refer to the original papers and\njudge for themselves what the evidence amounts to.\nMr. Dingwall's article seems to have been put together some-\nwhat carelessly or hastily. I notice, for example, that he states\non p. 40 apropos of cross-correspondences that \" Unfortunately\nthe greatest secrecy has been observed with regard to the\nidentity of the various automatists. They are known under\ndifferent pseudonyms. . .\n.\" Now to the best of my beUef\nthere have been ten automatists concerned in cross-correspon-\ndences published under the auspices of members of \" the group\n\"\n\u2014four writing under pseudonyms (viz. the Macs, Mrs. Forbes,\nMrs. Holland, and Mrs. Willett), and six writing in their own\nnames (viz. Mrs. Frith, Mrs. Lyttelton,^ Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Salter,\nMrs. Verrall, Mrs. Stuart Wilson). But of these the Macs, Mrs,\n1 Mrs. Lyttelton wrote as \"Mrs. King\" ,at first, but allowed her real name\nto be published in 1923. . ..\n\fVO Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1929\nForbes, and Mrs. Frith come but very slightly into the question\nof cross-correspondences. Omitting these for the purposes of the\npresent discussion we have two automatists writing under pseu-\ndonyms (Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Willett) and five writing under\ntheir own names. I am sorry we cannot relieve Mr. Dingwall\nof the burden of this amount of anonymity, but I think it will\nbe agreed that it is hardly a fair description of it to say that\n\" the greatest secrecy has been observed with regard to the\nidentity of the various automatists.\" It is understood of course\nthat there is no concealment of the identity of any of the\nautomatists from those sponsoring the publication of their scripts.\nHowever, this is something of a digression, as what I am\nspecially concerned to discuss on this occasion, if the editor will\nallow me space, are certain conditions of investigation of tele-\npathy, cross-correspondences, and the mental side of psychical\nresearch generally, which I thmk it important to bear in mind\nand which Mr. Dingwall seems sometimes to overlook. In such\nexperiments and observations there is the inevitable condition\nthat we have to deal with human minds, not with machines or\nchemical reactions, and that therefore we can never repeat ex-\nperiments exactly. It is this, besides the comparative variety\nof the phenomena in an observable form, that makes progress\nin psychical research so slow. Not being able to repeat exactly,\nwe can only accumulate evidence which, though not perfect, is\nas good as we can get, and comparing one case with another\ngradually discover perhaps what elements are essential and what\nnot essential to the results. It is with this object that we are\nanxious to collect as many cases, experimental and spontaneous,\nas we can. And it is with this object that we sometimes, I\nfear, bore our fellow members by urging them to contribute\ntheir share to the investigation by sending us particulars of any\ncase they hear of. No single experiment being in itself crucial\nor conclusive, and none being exactly repeatable, we require\nmany slightly varying ones to convince the world. And, as a\nmatter of fact, it is in this way that the world is gradually\nbecoming convinced of the existence of, e.g., telepathy. The\nattitude towards it now is very different from what it was when\nour Society was founded.\nIt is worth noticing that the kind of evidence on which our\nconclusions in psychical research are likely to be based is like-\n\fApril, 1929 Reviews n\nwise the kind used in historical investigation, in legal investi-\ngation, and in a great deal of scientific investigation, and is also\nthe kind by which we in fact conduct our ordinary mundane\naffairs. But in psychical research we suffer from a special diffi-\nculty, namely, that the facts our evidence has to establish are\nunusual facts\u2014they are not the sort of fact which we instinc-\ntively recognise as being as likely to be true as not. For this\nsort of recognition familiarity is required, and here again the\nrarity of our phenomena makes our progress slow.\nIf it be asked why, if telepathy occurs at all, experiments in\nwhich a prescribed programme is exactly carried out cannot be\nproduced ; one obvious answer is to point to our ignorance\nabout the telepathic process. A., for instance, who tries to\ntransmit an idea to B. otherwise than through the channels of\nsense, sometimes succeeds, but does not know how he does it,\nor what circumstances, mental or external, help or hinder.\nSimilarly B., who sometimes receives the intended idea otherwise\nthan through his senses, does not know how it comes to him.\nThis does not surprise me, because we have so little control over\nour mental processes. Who, for instance, has not struggled\nvainly to remember something\u2014say a name\u2014which he is certain\nhe knows. He fails at the time but later, perhaps the next day,\nwhen he has ceased to think about it, it comes into his mind,\napropos of nothing so far as he can judge. Whence came the\ndifficulty ?\nAll this is not intended to suggest that we should not, aided\nby the sensitive, secure the best conditions we can, and still\nless that we should not record the conditions that do obtain,\nwith as much care as we can. But do not let us reject, or\nregard with undue suspicion, all experiments that are not eviden-\ntially perfect in a mechanical sense.\nAnd this brings me to another result of our inability to repeat\nexperiments exactly. It is that the value of the evidence de-\npends inevitably on the bona fides of the persons concerned.\nWe cannot escape this. Of course, as in ordinary life, if you\nknow a man (or woman) personally, know the character and\nreputation he bears, know his work, and know his friends, you\ncan form a good judgment as to whether he is likely to deceive\nyou intentionally. A judgment so formed is not necessarily\ninfallible. Very occasionally in ordinary life a trusted friend\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apek,, 1920'\nfails us and proves unworthy of the trust placed in him. But\nthis is very rare, and we do not find it necessary to view all\npersons we have to deal with with suspicion\u2014indeed, civilised\nlife could hardly be carried on if we did. But of course we\ncannot transfer intact to the outside public, our own confidence\nin the probity of this or that person sharing in our experiment\n\u2014nor indeed in our own. As Dr. Henry Sidgwick said in an\nearly presidential address to our Society (July 18th, 1883,\nProc. vol. i. p. 250), \" All records of experiments must depend^\nultimately, on the probity and intelligence of the persons recording\nthem ; and it is impossible for us, or any other investigators, to\ndemonstrate to persons who do not know us that we are not\nidiotically careless or consciously mendacious. We can only hope\nthat within the limited circle in which we are known, either alter-\nnative will be regarded as highly improbable.\"\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nII. Vintras, hcresiarque el prophete. By Maurice Garqon. Paris,\nLibrairie critique Emile Nourry. 1928. 191 pages.\nThis book is interesting, though the seriously-minded psychical\nresearcher will glean from it but little. Those phenomena or\nperformances of the \" heresiarch \" which Maitre Gar9on narrates :\nalleged automatic writing and messages purporting to come from\nthe highest religious entities of the Beyond (including St. Joseph,\npromoted by Vintras commander of a special Order of Knights in\nhonour of the Virgin Mary [p. 98]), visions, \" apports \" and bleed-\nings of Hosts, etc., have about them nothing evidential. Still\nother authorities have been inclined to attribute to Vintras\nlevitations of Satanic origin ^\n; and on the whole, and though\nM. Gar9on thinks him an impostor, it is of course possible that\nif genuine mediumship or something like it exists, the Tilly-sur-\nSeulle \" prophet \" may have been one of the privileged few.\nWith the religious schism which Pierre-Eugene-Michel Vintras\n(1807-1875) created in the Roman Catholic Church of France, his\nprosecution, his imprisonment, his relations with Naundorf (the\nsoi-disant Louis XVII. denounced by Pope Gregory XVI. as the\n\" son of perdition \"\n[p. 92]), etc., we are not concerned here. This\nvery brief notice will therefore suffice. I should like, however,\n1 E.g., M. 0. Leroy in La Levitation.\n\fApril, 1929 Reviews 73\nbefore parting with an attractive little book to call attention to\nthe strange occurrences at Agen in the thirties related by the\nwriter on pp. 53-57. Here we have inter alia a case of alleged\npossession of a young woman, with, again, soi-disant \" apports\n\"\nof Hosts, as many as eighty on a single day. With these inci-\ndents Vintras is not connected. I certainly think they were frau-\ndulent\u2014and yet, should they ever occur again, Psychical Research\nwould not, in my opinion, be justified in ignoring them or re-\njecting them de piano without investigation. P.-P.-S.\nIII. The Felicia Scatcherd Memorial Lecture, 1928. By Stanley\nDe Brath. Is.\nThe choice of Mr. Stanley De Brath to deliver the first of the\nlectures instituted to perpetuate Miss Scatcherd's memory was a\nhappy one, in view both of their long association in psychic\nmatters and the similarity of their convictions.\nIn Mr. De Brath's view the \" physical phenomena \" are an\nessential part of the case for Spiritualism, and the first part of\nhis lecture is devoted to an affirmation of the credibility of these\nphenomena. He then outlines a sketch of evolution, inorganic,,\norganic and human, and discusses the bearing of the ideoplastic\ntheory on science and religion.\nMany of our members who knew Miss Scatcherd will be glad to\nobtain a copy of this lecture.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning Method in Psychical Investigation.\n[During a recent visit to Berlin I had the pleasure of a lengthy\nconversation with Professor Christoph Schroder, the head of the\nInstitut fiir Metapsychikalische Forschung. Among other subjects\nwe discussed the problem of method in psychical investigation.\nProfessor Schroder had for some months past been vigorously\ncriticising the methods of the S.P.R. in Continental periodicals\nwith restricted circulations. I therefore suggested to Professor\nSchroder that it would be useful to students of psychical research\nin general if he would formulate his objections to the Society's\nmethods in a letter to the Journal. On my return to London I\nrepeated this invitation, and in response Professor Schroder ad-\ndressed the following letter to me. Theodore Besterman.]\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1929\nDeab Sir,\u2014. . .\nIf in our conversation I repeatedly stressed my disagreement\nwith you, nevertheless it would not have been a subject of any\ndoubt to you that my disagreement is based on purely objective\nconsiderations arising out of my scientific work and experience,\nwhich, for the rest, are extensive. Even if you do not reckon\nWallace and Crookes, for instance, among the founders of the\nS.P.R. but only amongst the oldest members, yet it cannot be\ndisputed that from the first scientific members of your Society\nhave championed the reality of paraphysical ^ phenomena, and to-\nday are still doing so. The S.P.R., however, to judge from its\nutterances, includes to-day mainly men who have doubts about\nthis reality owing to an attitude taken up by them, to a certain\nextent, that is, on principle, and who direct their investigations\nonly to conjuring or fraud.\nThis method I cannot but describe most emphatically as a\nwrong one, and one that is a danger to any progress. It seems\nto me to presume too far in its judgment of the carefulness in\nobservation shown by the other men in the same Society and by\nother investigators ; I cannot, moreover, see any advantage for\nresearch if some members of the Society, or even a majority in\nit (perhaps after a vote has been taken on scientific investiga-\ntions !) should have found themselves convinced of the genuineness\nof paraphysical phenomena.\nI laid stress on the view that the problem of the genuineness\nof the phenomena, even if the aim of the investigation, as it must\nbe before any further test, can no longer be the only object of\ninvestigation. The experiment must have as its aim to obtain\nphenomena which are shown to be genuine after a detailed ex-\namination, and which will enable us gradually to attain an insight\ninto their energetic foundations. This I have already shown by\nmeans of a striking example taken from Frau Rudloff's meta-genetic\ndrawing phenomena (Zeitschrift fiir Psychische Forschung for February).\nThe S.P.R. reviewer is evidently lacking in physio-anatomical\nknowledge, in the knowledge of plasma structure, and of its\npeculiar chemico-physical properties, needed to appreciate the im-\nportance of the investigation carried out at the Kaiser Wilhelm\nInstitute. And probably he is lacking in the goodwill to make\n1 [I use this word to translate the term metapsyehikalisch, coined by Prof.\nSchroder. Th. B.]\n\fApril, 1929 Correspondence 75\nobjective reports owing to his prejudiced attitude against para-\nphysical phenomena.\nFurther, so far as tests for genuineness are to be regarded, or\nare regarded, as needful, it is an utter stagnation in method to\nbase them always on subjective impressions only, as happens, and\nmust always more or less happen, in the case of the gentlemen\nsent travelling round by the S.P.R. What is needed is to make,\nwith the most up-to-date means, objective registrations of the\nproceedings at the sittings, both accoustically and optically. And\nthese records must cover the whole \" sitting \" without a break.\nThat is my method, particularly the method of kinematography\nin the dark, a process on whose perfecting I have spent several\nyears and much money. On this see Zeitschrift filr Psychische\nForschung for September 1927.\nThis method of work is naturally very much more difficult than\nthe other, which studies paraphysical phenomena only from the\nstandpoint of expert conjuring. This means doing the same thing,\nusing the same methods, as was already customary fifty, sixty or\nseventy years ago. Science, it may be added, has not remained\nat the standpoint of that time. This attitude is, in my opinion,\nunworthy of an important Society.\nPsychics will win general scientific recognition only when it\nproduces scientific results by scientific methods, and particularly\nis this so in the paraphysical field which is here in question.\nAnd having a particularly high esteem for the S.P.R. I feel that\nI may hope that it will join with me in this view. Then the\npossibilities of joint work would follow as a natural result.\nOf course the refusal some years ago of a request to the S.P.R.\nhas nothing to do with my objective judgment, even though I\ncould, or had to, see in this an unfriendly action. For it should\nbe well enough known even abroad under what difficult conditions\nGerman science works to-day. This is in no wise disproved that to-day\nin Germany there are still some illiberal rich men, as you implied.\nIt would surely not have been so very great a sacrifice if the\nS.P.R. had put at the disposal of the Library of the Institute a\ncomplete set of the Proceedings, and of the Journal, reserving its\nrights of ownership, so as to serve the cause of research. Mean-\nwhile I have the Proceedings except for the recent years, but\nnothing of the Journal. With friendly greetings,\nYours faithfully, (Sgd.) Schroder.\n'\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, i929\n[Note.\u2014With regard to Professor Schroder's reference to the refusal\nof a request he made to this Society, the facts are as follows :\nIn 1924 Professor Schroder asked the Council to exchange the\nSociety's Proceedings with a Handbuch der Entomologie. The\nCouncil agreed to the exchange provisionally for a year. At the\nend of this time they did not feel able to continue the arrange-\nment, but they presented Professor Schroder with eight volumes\nof Proceedings to complete a set, the other volumes of which he\nhad already obtained elsewhere. They suggested that if Professor\nSchroder desired to obtain future Parts of Proceedings, either he\nor some other member of the Institute he had recently established\nshould join the Society.\nThe Council have in recent years received a considerable number\nof requests for gifts or exchanges of Proceedings. It is not pos-\nsible to accede to all these requests, but each one of them has\nbeen carefully considered and judged, according to the best of the\nCouncil's ability, on its merits.\n\u2014\nEd.'\\\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS. \"\nDie Medizinische Welt, 1928, 5.\nCount Klinckowstroem has a paper on \" The Crisis in Occultism,\"\ndealing with the mediumistic exposures of the last few years.\nParticular importance seems to be attached by him to the Vinton\ninvestigation at Braunau, in the Schneider circle (Psyche, April\n1927). The tone of the paper is sceptical throughout.\nL'Aventure (November, December, 1928, January, 1929).\nM. Paul Heuze prints a paper entitled \" What is to be thought\nof spiritistic phenomena ?\n\" He inclines to believe in the genuine-\nness of some of the mental phenomena, but is thoroughly sceptical\nas to the physical manifestations. In the long list of exposures\nquoted Sambor is mentioned, it being asserted that he was helped\nby an accomplice and that I detected the fraud ; in this form the\nstatement is incorrect. The argument that many things now of\neveryday occurrence would have been thought impossible two\ncenturies ago by all men of common sense is met in the following\nway : all these things, M. Heuze says (flying through the air,\ntalking to a man a thousand kilometres away, listening to a dead\n\fApril, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 77\nperson's voice, etc.), are just as impossible, strictly speaking, now\nas before, \" a moins de trues.\" The discoveries in question have\ntherefore consisted, the writer asserts, in discovering the trick, not\nin finding out new \"human faculties'.\" Man is just as incapable\nnow as he was before, as he will be to-morrow, to listen to a\ndead man's voice, or to see through a wooden board, but the\n\" trick \" has been suppHed by the gramophone, by radiography,\netc. M. Heuze's retort, is not, I think, irrefutable, but is certainly\ninteresting, though I suspect him of using the word \" trick \" in a\nsomewhat ambiguous sense.\nBulletin du Conseil de Recherches Metapsychiques de Belgique.\nJanuary, 1929.\nIn a long paper entitled \" The two great factors of existence\nand of the world's evolution,\" M.M. Rutot and Schaerer discuss\n\" two great creative and directing principles \" underlying the\nCosmos, the first being the physical factor, \" based on cinetic or\nmaterial and unconscious realisation,\" the second being called the\npsychical factor ; the latter has \" a co-ordinating basis, capable of\nbecoming volitional \" through accession to consciousness. M. Rutot\nthinks Dr. Fukurai's experiments in Japan afford a confirmation of\niis and M. Schaerer's theoretical conclusions.\nA case of spirit identity occurring at a seance held in August\nlast is described. If we could be completely certain of the good\nfaith of all the persons present (only two initials are mentioned\nin this connection, the sitters being altogether five in number) and\nif we could exclude cryptomnesia, we should certainly have here a\nvery striking case. But these ifs \" remind us but too well of\nthe evidential weaknesses inherent in such incidents !\nThe words in Aramaic spoken by Theresa Neumann in Kon-\nnersreuth in the presence of Dr. Gerlich, Prof. Wutz, and Prof.\nJohannes Bauer are discussed by Dr. Wessely, an Austrian orien-\ntalist, in the Vienna Reichspost, the article being- the summary\nof a lecture delivered by Dr. W. before the (Roman Catholic)\nLeogeseUschaft. The writer is most positive, even enthusiastic, in\nhis assertions, and speaks of this case of xenoglossy (Dr. W. does\nnot use this term) as of something unheard of and without pre-\ncedent. A series of sentences is quoted, and though among the sen-\ntences we find one mentioned in Matt, xxvii. 46, and Mark xv. 34,\nthis aspect of the Konnersreuth enigma is certainly one of the\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 1929\nmost striking. I doubt, however, if either the Aramaic words or\nthe stigmata or even the fasting are likely to afford us a decisive\nproof of the supernormal character of the phenomena (the latter\nbecause a thorough investigation seems to be beset by peculiar\ndifficulties). A crucial proof in this respect would perhaps be\nmuch more easily obtained through levitation (i.e. attempts at\nlevitation) if the ecclesiastical authorities could be prevailed upon\nto induce T. N. to turn her thoughts in that direction.\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie, January, 1929.\nIn a paper profusely illustrated with photographs taken from\nthe July number of the Proceedings of the British College of\nPsychic Science, Fraulein G.

The results obtained were feeble, barring a very\nlimited number of incidents.\nThe Spukmedium (Poltergeist medium) Vilma Molnar is the\nsubject of a paper by Dr. von Schrenck. He admits that this\ncase has not been investigated \" with a thoroughness permitting us\nto champion the genuineness of all the phenomena,\" still he\nbelieves in that genuineness. The phenomena are attested among\nothers by Princess Windischgraetz of Vienna and Schonau (Bur-\ngenland), to whom Vilma admitted, however, that some were\nfraudulent (p. 29).\nA case of haunting which may have been striking is quoted\nfrom a MS. work of Franz Rolan's written about 1900 and\nunpublished. The ghost was seen by several persons. It must\nbe admitted that as a general rule these spontaneous cases are\nfar more impressive than the Psychical Researcher's experimental\nwork.\n\fApril, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 79\nIn a review of Frenzold Sclimid's Die Wahrheit uber das Wunder\nin Konnersreuth Prof. Oesterreich mentions two new extraordinary\nIndian cases spoken of by the writer, cases which are respectively\nconnected with the names of Sandshaya Madhu and Mangtuyan\nKing, the former being endowed with extraordinary supernormal\nfaculties, the latter being a preacher and Wunderhind.

A\nfew instances are given.-\"-\nP.-P.-S.\n1 Some account of Mme Kahl's phenomena was given by Mr. Besterman at\na Private Meeting of the Society on February 20th, 1929.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April, 192!)\nPsychic Research, January, 1929.\nTliis number opens with the first instalment of a paper by\nMr. B. B. Dudley, entitled \" Psychics versus Mediums.\" The dis-\ntinction between these two classes of persons, according to Dr.\nDudley's definition, is that \" the latter give some evidence of the\npresence of teleplasm or of telekinetic phenomena, while the former\ndo not.\" The thesis which Mr. Dudley wishes to establish is that\npsychic phenomena are \" the product of forces resident in the\nsubconscious mind of living man,\" and involve only \" a faculty\nwhich, however it may vary in degrees, is present in all men and\nperhaps in many animals.\" True mediumistic phenomena, on the\nother hand, the only phenomena involving the agency of discarnate\nminds, are always based upon a rare and peculiar form of physical\nenergy called \" teleplasmic.\" The thesis is one which many\nstudents of psychical research will for one reason or another find\nit difficult to accept. There is an article by Mr. Bligh Bond\nentitled \" Athanasia : My Witness to the Soul's Survival.\" It\ncontains an account of some of the writer's earliest psychical ex-\nperiences, when he sat with a group of personal friends and certain\nphysical phenomena were observed. There is also an article by\nMarius J. Zaayer on \" Thinking Animals : A Statement of the\nNegative Viewpoint,\" which serves as an introduction to a report\nby Mr. J. Malcolm Bird on \"The Briarclifi Pony\" (see S.P.R.\nJourn., January, 1929, p. 22). Mr. Bird, after himself witnessing a\nperformance by the pony, comes to the conclusion (endorsed by other\nobservers, including Dr. Hereward Carrington) that the animal\nexhibited no supernormal powers, but had been taught to observe\na code of signalling used by its owner. Mr. Bird also has an\narticle on \" Dreams\u2014Previsional and Otherwise,\" in which several\ndreams are recorded of the type described by Mr. Dunne.

May, 1929.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nCASE.\nL. 1288. Information received at a Sitting concerning\nMatters unknown to the Sitter.\nWe print below a report received from one of our Members,\nhere called Mrs. Cooper, concerning some information of appar-\nently supernormal origin received by her at sittings with Miss\nGeraldine Cummins. The method of communication was by ouija\nboard, Miss Cummins being in a light trance. The names of\nall persons concerned are known to the Society, but for reasons\nwhich will be apparent pseudonyms or initials have been used\nhere.\nThe purporting communicator at these sittings was Captain\nJ. M., of the 1st Batt. of the Blanhsliire Regiment, an old\nfriend of ]\\Irs. Cooper s, who was killed in the South African\nWar. Sirs. Cooper, who takes her own notes, had her first\nsitting with Miss Cummins on June 22nd, 1927 ; at her fourth\nsitting on October 26th, 1927, the following statement was\nmade :\nJ. M. You know Cunynham.\nMrs. C. Yes, of course. What is the rest of his name ?\nJ. M. Cunynham Dick.\nMrs. Cooper was thinking at the time of a man of the name\nof Dick-Cunynham, now dead, with whom she was acquainted.\nAt a subsequent sitting with Miss Cummins on November\n25th, 1927, it was made clear that reference was intended\nto Colonel W. H. Dick-Cimynham, who was awarded the V.C.\nin the Afghan War in 1879, and died of woimds received\nat Caesar's Camp, Ladysmith, in January 1900. This Colonel\n\f82 Journal of Society for Psychical Research biay, 1929\nDick-Cunynliam Mrs. Cooper never knew, nor at the time\nof the sitting did she consciously remember the circum-\nstances of his death. It is, however, quite possible that she\nhad at some time known them ;\nmoreover, the circum-\nstances of the awarding of the V.C. and of Colonel Dick-\nCunynham's death have been described in several published\nbooks. The incident is only mentioned here as it seems to\nhave been the first emergence of a train of thought followed\nup in subsequent sittings. Colonel W. H. Dick-Cunynham was\nknown to Captain J. M.\nExtracts from later Sittings with Miss Cummins.\nDecember 8th, 1927.\nJ. M. You want me to try to\nput through a name or\ntwo. Did you ever hear of\ntwo men in my regiment\nwho were knocked out as I\nwas ? . . . One was a yoiuig-\nster Vezey. The other is\nFrazer} . . . They gave me\npart of a name which is\nimportant. They could not\nremember it all. It is\nEland\u2014 I think. They\nwere done in near some\nplace like that.\nVezey and Fraser (note spell-\ning) were the names of two\nofficers of the 2nd Batt. of the\nBlankshire Regiment killed at\nElandslaagte in October 1899.\nTo the best of her belief Mrs.\nCooper had never heard of\neither of them. The applying\nof the term \" youngster \" to\nVezey is not very appropriate,\nas he was nearly forty at the\ntime of his death and consider-\nably older than Fraser, who\nwas not yet thirty.\nThe mistake as to the respec-\ntive ages of Vezey and Fraser\nseems to be here corrected.\nApril 2nd, 1928.\nJ. M. I met two men I knew\nthis side lately. One is\ncalled Frazer my regiment.\nHe was quite young. The\nother was a good fellow\nVezey. I had forgotten\neven their names till I ran\nup against them here with\nDick-Cunynham. ...\n^ In selecting pseudonyms care has been taken to choose names which\nrepresent the actual names as well as possible, especially as regards mistakes\nin spellinrr, etc.\n\fMay, 1929 Case 83\nDoes a name beginning\nwith Raven mean anything\nto you ? Raven\u2014 I can't\nremember the rest. Teign-\nmouth \u2014 a place there \u2014 I\nknow there was some connec-\ntion between Dorothy and it.\nMrs. C. Which Dorothy ? You\ndon't mean Miss Cummins ?\nJ. M. No, the other one. Her\nname was connected with\nthat place. Her name is\nthe one connected with\nRavensburn\u2014not more than\na connection. You must\npuzzle this out.\n(Later in the sitting :)\nMrs. C. I'll try to find out\nabout Raven and Dorothy.\nJ. M. No, Nevill. Remember\nDorothy's name.\nApril mh, 1928.\nJ. M. I am sorry I did not\nget the correct meaning\nthrough about Raven. I\nthought of the Raven Inn\nand then I couldn't get the\nother Ravensburn through.\nNevills lived there, not\nDorothy, but I set it as a\npuzzle for you.\nThe allusion to a \" name begin-\nning with Raven \" meant nothing\nto Mrs. Cooper at the time of\nthe sitting. Nor did the allu-\nsion to Teignmouth.\nDorothy is Miss Cunimins's\nfirst name.\nJ. M. You will find Ravens-\nbourne Teignmouth next.\nDorothy Nevill was the name\nof a friend at whose house Mrs.\nCooper and \/. M. had met.\nAt a sitting of Mrs. Cooper's\nwith another medium, not re-\nported here, there had been a\nconfused attempt to make a\nstatement about \" Raven.\" The\nRaven Inn at Shrewsbury is\nvery well known. Mrs. Cooper\nnotes that at the time of the\nsitting of April 18th she had\ntraced a family called Nevill\nliving near Carlisle, who also\nowned land in Shropshire near\nJ. M.'s old home, and she\nthought reference might be in-\ntended to them.\nMrs. Cooper, who has never\nherself visited Teignmouth, was\na2\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1929\nIn my time NeviUs lived\nthere.\nMes. C. Is it the name of a\nhouse ?\nJ. M. Yes, I remembered it,\nand told you Dorothy's\nname was connected with\nit. It is the same surname.\nIn mv time remember.\nunable to find any reference to\na house called Ravensbourne,\neither in Kelly's Directory^ or on\nmaps. Eventually, however, a\nstatement was obtained from the\npostmaster at Teignmouth, as\nfollows :\nPost Office,\nTeignmouth.\n30.4.28.\nWith reference to your en-\nquiry relating to the occupation\nof a house by the name of\nRavensbourne, I beg to inform\nyou that it is confirmed that a\ngentleman of the name of Nevill\noccupied a house of that name\nsituated in the Higher Wood-\nway some years ago.\n(Sgd.) J. E. Needland.\nApril 2m, 1928.\nJ. M. Frazer has been telling\nme about the spree he\nsays I missed, at X- .\nI wasn't with the regiment\nthen. The two battalions\nhad the hell of a time to\nget there, he says\u2014excuse\nthe language, and regi-\nmental gossijo. ... I shall\nbe a prude and not tell you\nof a small scandal that\noccurred at that time. Some\nday you may hear of that\nfamous meeting between the\ntwo battalions. The first\nhad done awfullv well, but\nA military station in India\nwas correctly named with the\nomission of one letter. The\nfirst and second battalions of\nthe Blankshire regiment met at\nthis station in 1898, a fact of\nwhich to the best of her belief\nMrs. Oooper had no knowledge.\nIt is true, as Mrs. Cooper\nascertained by personal enquiry\nafter the sitting, that J. M. did\nnot accompany his regiment to\nIndia. Mention of this fact is\nof some interest, since it would\nnot be easily ascertainable from\nany published source. Mrs.\n1 But see below p. 88.\n\fMay, 1929\nthey little knew what was\nbefore them.\nMay 7th, 1928.\nJ. M. Next time I sj^eak I\nwill tell you more about\nX\u2014 and the spree the\nyoungsters had. Jimmy, as\nwe called the adjutant, knew\nabout it, they tell me.\n85\nCooper did not herself meet, or\nhear anything of J. M. after\nJune, 1897, until she read of\nhis death in S. Africa.\nAt a later sitting on May\n18th there was a reference to\n\" Jimmy, otherwise Jamieson,\nthe adjutant.\" There seems to\nbe some confusion here. Neither\nof the adjutants of the 1st and\n2nd battalions of the Blank-\nshires in 1898 was called Jamie-\nson ; there was a Captain\nJameso)t (note spelling) in the\n1st battalion, but he was not\nthe adjutant. We have ascer-\ntained from an old soldier\nserving with the regiment at\nthe time (see below) that there\nwas an officer in the 2nd bat-\ntalion called Jimmy B . But\nhe also was not adjutant.\nOase\nMay m.h, 1928.\nJ. M. Bv the way, I meant to tell you more about that\nX. affair.\nMes. C. Tell me about the scandal.\nJ. M. It seems hardly fair to repeat this gossip. I won't\ntell you one matter as it may concern some one\nstill alive, but the other concerns the youngster\nhere.\nHe went on the spree, got pretty drunk, I under-\nstand, and with another fellow wandered into a\nhigh-caste Hindu's garden and private residence.\nThe master of the establishment thought they had\ndesigns on his women-folk and threatened to make\na complaint to the Colonel. They managed to\nshut his mouth ; no doubt they oiled his palm.\nThey hadn't an idea as to where they were going.\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psyddcal Research May, 1929\nThey were just a bit fuddled. I haven't got the\nstory properly from them yet, but when I first\n'.\n. heard them mention it, I thought :\n\" By Jove\n!\nhere's something for E.'s museum.\"\nIt is a fact, as mentioned above, that the 1st and 2nd\nbattalions of the Blankshires met at X. in 1898, and it is\nworth noting that meetings between two battalions of the same\nregiment are rare events. The meeting between the two\nbattalions at X. is mentioned in at least one published book,\nand although Miss Cummins informs us that to the best of\nher knowledge she has never read, or even heard of this book\n(the reference was discovered by a Member of the Society\nwho kindly undertook to make some enquiries on our behalf),\nit obviously may be the source of her knowledge ; the con-\ntrary cannot be proved. On the other hand, such an incident\nas is related in the above extract from Mrs. Cooper's sitting on\nMay 18th, 1928, is most unlikely to be mentioned anywhere in\nprint, and it is therefore a point of considerable interest that\nMrs. Cooper has been able to obtain some corroboration of\nthe statement made. The corroboration is contained in a\nletter written to Mrs. Cooper by a friend, Mr. B., as follows :\n2nd July, 1928.\nI was playing golf with Colonel D. the other day and I\nasked him about the events we were discussing.\nHe was there himself as a junior subaltern when the two\nbattalions met.\nWhile he cannot of course remember the details, he does\nrecollect some such incident as the garden episode occurring.\nIt would, of course, have added to the value of the case\nto have a more exact and detailed corroboration of this\nincident, but it is not surprising that such should be hard to\nget, seeing that the incident occurred more than thirty years\nago and can only have been known at the time to a few\npersons, several of whom lost their lives in South Africa a\nfew years later. The old soldier with whom, as already men-\ntioned, we got in touch through one of our Members, when\nquestioned on this point, said he well remembered the meeting\nof the two battalions at X. and the celebrations which ensued.\n\fMat, 1929 Case 87\nOf the garden incident he knew nothing, but that is no\nevidence that such an incident did not occur, for it is not\nlikely that a private soldier would have known of a matter\nof this kind in which only officers were directly involved. On\nthe other hand, this old soldier volunteered to our informant\nan account of another unpublished incident which occurred\nat the same time and involved a man still alive. This is\nworth noting in view of J. M.'s statement on May 18th,\n1928, that he would not tell of one matter \"as it may con-\ncern some one still alive.\" At a later sitting IVIrs. Cooper had\nwith Miss Cummins on January 31st last, an attempt was\nmade to get a further statement from J. M. on this point,\nbut he declined to say anything on the ground that he had\npromised Fraser that he would not give \" the name of any\nliving man connected with that affair,\" i.e. the meeting of the\nbattalions at X. And there for the moment the matter rests.\nImmediately after refusing to give the particular piece of\ninformation asked of him, J. M. added :\nDid you ever hear of West ? or what's his name ?\nTatton ?\nMes. C. \"Who was Tatton ?\nJ. M. You try and find out. You have to do your share\nof the work.\nLieut. Tatton was serving in the 1st battalion of the Blank-\nshires in 1898, at about the time the two battalions met.\nThere was no man of the name of West in either of the two\nbattalions at that time. There was a Lieut. West in another\nregiment which was serving in the Punjab in 1898. No\ncontact between this regiment and the Blankshires has been\ntraced, but such a contact may have occurred. So far as she\ncan remember, Mrs. Cooper had never heard either of Lieut.\nTatton or Lieut. West, until the names were given to her by\nMiss Cummins. Apart from her personal acquaintance with\nJ. M., which ceased in June, 1897, Mrs. Cooper has never had\nany connection with the Blankshires, nor has she any knowledge\nof the book mentioned above, which refers to the meeting of\nthe two battalions at X.\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1929\nSummary of the Case.\nAs regards possible sources of the knowledge shown by Miss\nCummins, normal or otherwise :\n(1) It is extremely improbable that Miss Cummins has ever\nobtained any accidental knowledge of the persons or events\ninvolved. In 1898 she was still a child, living in Ireland, and\nshe has never had through her family or near friends any\nconnection with the regiment here concerned. She has several\nrelatives in the army, but none of them seems a likely source\nof the knowledge shown in the sittings. Nor is it likely\nthat she has obtained the information in trance from any of\nher sitters. She does not give many sittings to members of\nthe public, preferring to spend her time in such w^ork as the\nrecently published Scripts of Cleophas.\n(2) The names of the various officers mentioned could have\nbeen obtained from army lists, and, as already noted, a\nmention of the meeting of the two battalions at X. has been\nfound in a regimental history published some years ago.\nPublished references to this incident are not likely to be\nnumerous. It may be noted that the two mistakes in spelling\nwhich occur in the ouija board record {Frazer and Jamieson)\nsuggest that the source of Miss Cummins's knowledge was\nauditory rather than visual (e.g. from an Army list), though\nthis is not a j^oint to which much weight can be attached.\n(3) It is most improbable that any account of the garden\nincident has ever appeared in print, and the number of persons\nnow living who might have any direct knowledge of such an\nincident must be small.\n(4) With regard to the curious incident of the name Nevill\nassociated with a house called Ravensbourne at Teignmouth,\ninformation on this point, both as regards the name of the\nhouse, and the name of the occupant, is obtainable from\nKelly's County Directory for Devonshire in the issues from\n1914-19 ; the entry does not appear in earlier or later issues.\nThe communicator's statement that in his time \" Nevills lived\nthere \" appears therefore to be incorrect. Mrs. Cooper does not\nknow of any connection he had with Teignmouth. It was at\nanother place in Devonshire, 24 miles from Teignmouth, at the\n\fMay, 1929 Case 89\nhouse of a friend called Nevill, mentioned above, that Mrs.\nCooper and J. M. first met. The information, which has no\ndirect connection with the rest of the case, was apparently\noffered in response to a request from Mrs. Cooper for some\nevidence of knowledge which could not be obtained from her\nmind.\nTHE SCRIPTS OF CLEOPHAS.i\nBy the Rev. Canon H. Bickersteth Ottley, M.A.\n[Editorial note.\u2014 We printed in the Journal for last December,\np. 394, a review of the recently published Scripts of Cleophas,\nwritten hy the hand of Geraldine Cummins. The subject is one\nupon which opinions differ, and it is thought by some students\nof these scripts that the evidence for their supernormal origin is\nbetter than was suggested by our reviewer. We print below a\nstatement of this view sent to us by Canon Ottley.]\nLittle more than a year has elapsed\u2014for the \" Introduction \" to\nthis amazing volume is dated 21st December, 1927\u2014since this\n(first instalment) of The Scripts of Cleophas has been available for\npresent-day students of Christian Origins. The materiel still\nawaiting publication\u2014in Automatic Messages already transcribed in\ntype-written MS.\u2014is, it is understood, sufficient to occupy two, if\nnot three, similar volumes.\nFrom the standpoint of literary and historical interest, this\nremarkable collection of automatic writings\u2014claiming to be nothing\nless than a record emanating from eye-witnesses of the facts\n\u2014\nconstitutes, obviously, a momentous challenge to many conven-\ntional theories and traditions as to the existing \" canonical \" books\nof the N.T., and as to the sources of new information relating to\nthe actual circumstances in which the missionary labours of the\nApostles and their companions took place.\nThose who reahse this point of view will be first to admit\nthat the problems raised by The Scripts of Cleophas are, beyond\nall precedent, formidable and fundamental.\nIt must be remembered, in approaching these problems, that\nthe outstanding feature of the Scripts is furnished by the period\n\u2014A.D. 34-90 (approximately)-within which their contents claim to\nhave been written, and to which alone they refer. The various\n1 Hastings' Encycl. of Religion and Ethics, ii. 572.\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1929\n' scribes,\" or personal attendants and companions, of St. Paul and\nthe other Apostles, greet the reader of the Scripts with a \" first-\nhand \" narrative of what they themselves have lieard and seen,\nin that wonderful half-century which followed after the Pentecostal\nMission of the Apostolic band. Dealing thus, exclusively, with\nthe historical \" infancy \" of Christianity, The Scripts of Cleophas\nelucidate much that appears obscure in connexion with the travels\nof St. Paul and with the foundation of the Primitive Church, and\nfurnish information supplementing the narrative in complete\ndetail. Thus Dr. Sanday, referring to the brevity and incom-\npleteness of the record given in Acts xiii. 4 to xiv. 26, reminds us\nthat \" A whole journey \" is compressed into those two chapters,\n\" but has not left behind it any literature that is now extant^ The\nhappenings incidental to this journey are recorded more fully,\nthough with some dislocation perhaps in sequence, in several\nchapters of the Scripts}\nSuch being the general character of this remarkable volume, it\nwill be realised that\u2014whatever may be its \" origin\n\"\n\u2014its contents\nplace it altogether apart from the entire mass of those strange\nand semi-fabulous writings\u2014roughly to be designated under the\ngeneral description of \"Apocryphal\"\u2014which, as has been truthfully\nsaid, constitute a literature of their own, \" with the intricate details\nof which only Specialists are competent to deal \" {N.T. Apocryphal\nWritings, Dr. J. Orr, p. vii). \" These,\" as Dr. Orr says, \" began\nto be produced in the second century, mostly in Ebionitic and\nGnostic circles, and . . . only later, in modified and expurgated\nforms, . . . passed into the general Catholic tradition. . . . Irenaeus\n[describes them as] forged to bewilder the minds of the foolish,\n. . . and as deviating as far as possible from sound orthodoxy,\nand ... to be rejected as altogether absurd and impious \" (H.E.\niii. 25). As to this literature, Bp. Ellicott claimed that \" these\nspurious Gospels,\" with their \" mendacities, their absurdities, their\nbarbarities, and the inconsequence of their narratives, have never\nbeen excused or condoned \" {On the Apocryphal Gospels, p. 153).\nFrom this farrago of heresy and romance\u2014the by-product of\na venal endeavour to pander to the ignorant credulity of the\nancient Pagan world\n\u2014\nThe Scripts of Cleophas\u2014with its simple\natmosphere of reverent and truthful record of the Apostolic\nmissionary journeyings\u2014stands unalterably and finally apart.\niPp. 98, etc., and 115-139.\n\fMat, 1929 The Scripts of Cleophas 91\nThe present writer has on two occasions personally witnessed\nthe reception \" of the \" Message \"'\nentrusted to the unconscious\ninstrumentality of Miss Cummins. He has submitted the various\n\" theories \" and \" explanations \" advanced by critics, in regard to\nthe bona fides of these communications\u2014and affecting, of course,\nher own sincerity and truthfulness, and the reality of her psychical\npowers\u2014to the severest possible tests. To the study of the\nScripts themselves he has devoted many months of the closest\nand most searching attention that his own academical training\nenabled him to give ;\nand, with an d priori sceptical bias in\nregard to what, from childhood, he had been taught to regard as\nthe \" forbidden \" ground of \" psychical \" communication with \" the\nLife that follows Death,\"\u2014he finds himself constrained to recog-\nnise, in The Scripts of Cleophas, a contribution to the cause of\nChristian present-day \" Apologetics \" of supreme and most oppor-\ntune importance.\nIn this connexion, it may be of interest to quote the words in\nwhich Sir Oliver Lodge permits me to put on record his own\nconvictions about their value. Writing on August 14th, 1928, Sir\nOliver says :\n\" I see no reason to doubt the genuineness of the\nreception, whatever the source may be. . . . That all this detail\nshould have come through, is in itself a remarkable phenomenon.\nIt seems quite unlikely that the subconsciousness of Miss Cummins\nor Miss Gibbes could be regarded as responsible for it. The only\nplan is to judge the writings on their merits ; and I trust that\nthey will receive from scholars the attention they deserve.\" I\nwould end this note with some words in which the \" Messenger\n\"\ndiscloses, through Miss Cummins, the underlying purpose which\ninspires this far-reaching and mysterious volume :\n\" It is our purpose, if the Earth will receive, to sow such seed\nin the hearts of men of your generation that Faith in Our Master\nChrist shall blossom anew. The men of your day believe, may-\nhap, that Christ is dead. It is not so. He liveth, and shall\nlive in the minds of the people of your times, once more.\"\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1929\nREVIEWS.\nI.

Boston [Mass.]. February, 1929. Pp. 399.\nThe Boston Society, in publishing this, its latest volume, has\nagain brought within reach of the student a store of valuable\nrecords of veridical communications through mediums, showing\nknowledge which it is difficult to suppose the mediums could have\nobtained by normal means.\nThe fii'st half of the volume, Mrs. Allison's, gives an account\nfrom the beginning of her attempts to get into communication\nwith her deceased husband through mediums in America and in\nLondon, and has therefore a sort of completeness. We see in it\nhow she has succeeded with some mediums and failed with others\nof good rejifute for no discoverable reason ; and ho'w with certain\nmediums first sittings were successful and later ones failures, and\nvice versa. Extensive quotation from such a report would obvi-\nously be out of place here, and a proper idea of the evidence can\nhardly be given without it. But to anyone desiring specimens,\nI might suggest reading Mrs. Allison's Introduction (pp. 7-10)\n;\na remarkable sitting with Mrs. Dowden (Section XXII, p. 162 ff.) ;\nand, for a different kind of communication, a sitting with Mrs.\nLeonard (Section XXI, p. 1.53) during which Feda gropes for a\ndescription of an object recently purchased by Mrs. Allison, under\ncircumstances that would have been interesting to the professed\ncommunicator. Feda unmistakably gets the idea of it without\nbeing able fully to name it or realise what it is.\nThe second half of the book describes and discusses a number\nof sittings with Mrs. Soule of Boston, at which Dr. Walter Prince\nor his adopted daughter or both were the sitters. Intimate\ndetails were given about circumstances and surroundings of their\nrespective childhoods\u2014and also about Mrs. Prince's last illness,\nwhich can hardly have come to the medium's knowledge by\naccident or enquiry, and which have a distinct individual applica-\ntion to the persons concerned. There is also (p. 353) a striking\nprediction of a serious fire well worth studying. No place is\nnamed, but enough is said to make identification of the place and\nthe fire which subsequently occurred reasonably certain.\n\fMay, 1929 Reviews 93\nThere is very little in the communications recorded in either\npart of the book which could not have been derived from the\nsitter's mind, given an extended power of mind-reading. But\nthere is a good deal that the sitter was not consciously thinking\nof, and there are items here and there so appropriate evidentially\nas to suggest selection by some mind interested in producing\nevidence of identity rather than merely casual scraps of memory\nor of association of ideas. On the other hand, as one would\nexpect from previous experience, there are definitely erroneous\nstatements, and others which, if they refer to true facts at all,\nshow a very imperfect and doubtful apprehension of them. One\ncan only attribute such errors in the midst of so much that is\ntrue to dream-like irrelevance on the part of the communicator,\nwhatever the communicator is, or to some misleading association\nof ideas on the part of the medium. In short, the records here\npreserved raise most of the problems that puzzle us as regards\nveridical mediumistic communications, but also furnish material\nwhich adds to our hope of solving them.\nE.

He is a\nconvinced enemy of the Kriminaltelepath, though, as he is careful\nto point out, he does not deny the reality of clairvoyance and\ntelepathy in general ; he only maintains and attempts to prove\nthere were no cases of telepathy and clairvoyance in those trials\nwith which he was connected as expert.\nAfter a few general remarks (pp. 13-36) he narrates three of\nthese trials in great detail, reproducing verbatim many judicial\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1929\ndocuments hitherto apparently unknown. These trials are : The\nHildebrecht-Mockel trial at Bernburg (December 1924), the Drost\ntrial, again at Bernburg (October 1925), the G. trial at BaUngen\n(October 1925). In the first case the two accused were found\nguilty ; in the Drost case (which acquired at the time a very wide\nnotoriety) there was an acquittal ; in the G. case the accused (the\n\" medium's \" husband) was found guilty.^\nInto the details I will abstain from entering. Suffice it to\nsay that Dr. Hellwig gives at very great length his reasons for\nbelieving that in no instance was there any evidence of super-\nnormal knowledge. The question of the hona fides of the hypno-\ntiser (as distinct from the \" medium \") is also copiously discussed.\nI believe it very likely that the Landgerichtsdirektor's conclusions\nre these three cases are quite correct, though it should be noted\nthat in some instances the opinions of other experts, such as\nHerren Heyse and Tischner (our very esteemed Corresponding\nMember) did not agree with that of Dr. Hellwig.\nThe layman or semi-layman is struck on perusing the book, it\nmust be admitted, by the absence of a detailed report on the\nGiinther-GefEers case, which last year acquired so much notoriety.\nThe writer explains that one of his reasons for abstaining from\nnarrating in detail the Insterburg trial (see Journal S.P.R. for\nJuly 1928) is the fact that the sentence of the court acquitting\nthe Konigsberg clairvoyante fills 121 closely written pages in folio\n(p. 29). On reading this statement I more than ever value con-\nciseness ;\nstill, could not this colossus have been reproduced some-\nwhat curtailed ? A magnum opus dealing with German (only\nGerman) Kriminaltelepathen and setting almost entirely aside the\nGiinther-Gefiers case (Frau G.-G. appears, by the way, in several\nof the excellent photographs adorning the volume) leaves somewhat\non the reader the impression of \" Hamlet \" with the Prince of\nDenmark left out.\nAs brief references were made by me in my Notes on Periodicals\nin the S.P.R. Journal for October and November 1928 to the\nclairvoyante's statement re the Countess Eulenburg case and the\nKaschnitzki case, I must mention here that according to the ex-\ntracts from the court's sentence reproduced by Dr. Hellwig, the\njudges expressed themselves sceptically about both cases and in\nparticular about the Countess E. as witness (pp. 29-32).\n1 1 make mention here of the sentences of the inferior courts only.\n\fMay, 1929 Reviews 95\nAfter the three trials I have mentioned, Dr. Hellwig proceeds to\nrelate with the same abundance of detail the two Poltergeist\n(Spukerscheinungen) cases of Resau (1888-1889), ending with the\nsentencing to fourteen days of Gefdngnisstrafe and to four weeks\nof Haftstrafe, of the supposed culprit Karl Wolter, and of Hopf-\ngarten (1921), where the accused (a watchmaker named Sauerbrey)\nwas acquitted. The latter had been charged with having hypno-\ntised his stepmother and thus plunged her into a semi-conscious\nstate in which she produced slight physical manifestations, which\nDr. Hellwig believes to have been fraudulent.\nDr. Hellwig's is a very matter-of-fact and a very learned work,\nthe work of a judge and of an upright and sagacious man. His\nsincerity is obvious. He believes the German Kriminaltelefath to\nbe a danger, and he makes war on him.\nThere are a good many points in what the learned Land-\ngerichtsdirektoi- says as to which I could raise a discussion ; and I\nbelieve such a discussion might be in some respects interesting and\nfruitful. But I have just remembered what I said as to how much\nI value conciseness ! P.-P.-S.\nSHORT NOTICES.\nJ.

Price 12s. 6d. net.\nMr. Seabrook deals with the superstitions and beliefs of the\nHaitian descendants of the slaves transported to America from\nWest Africa. Among these beliefs are many implying the occur-\nrence of alleged supernormal phenomena. Mr. Seabrook found.\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May, 1929\nhowever, that after investigation he had usually to consider these\nphenomena abnormal rather than supernormal. Thus, the \" dead\n\"'\nmen shown to him working in the cane-fields were almost cer-\ntainly half-wits. Unfortunately, the author is not always so\nsensible, as when he writes that \" white men have died in London\n\u2014and the records are in Scotland Yard\u2014because some monk in\nthe mountains of Thibet marked them to die, and sat droning\nin his far-off cell among the Himalayas \"\n(pp. 53-54).

Price 2s. 6d. net.\nDr. Critchley's pamphlet should be most useful to students of\npsychical research who occasionally come across the phenomenon\nof mirror-writing in automatic writings. The author describes\nboth the physical (hemiplegia, etc.) and the mental defects that\nmay lead to this abnormality, and gives examples both from the\nliterature and from his own experience. He does not appear to\nhave come across any example of the type recently seen by the\npresent reviewer : a script which was not merely reversed line\nby line, but which started in the bottom right-hand corner and\nproceeded from right to left to the top of the page. A problem\nwhich Dr. Critchley merely touches, but which deserves a close\ninvestigation, is that of the mirror-writing of a man of genius,\nLeonardo da Vinci.\nHeinrich Schole, Okkuttisiiius und Wissenschaft. 8vo, pp. 92.\nGottingen : Vandenhoeck and Ruprecht, 1929.\nDr. Schole takes up a position of total scepticism about all the\nphenomena of psychical research, but without contributing any\nnew critical material or thoughts of great value. His little book\nis interesting chiefly for an account of the most impressive\nmanner in which he produced pseudo-telepathic phenomena. He\ndescribes his procedure, and it would seem that he was able to\nguess correctly, by the sense of touch alone, which cards of a\nnumber placed on a table were being mentally selected by a\nperson standing behind him. Unfortunately, Dr. Schole's account\nlacks those details of corroboration and the like which he would\nvery rightly call for in genuine experiments. Th.

He is sceptical re Margery and thoroughly\nsceptical re Kraus, but one constantly has the feeling that he\nsays far less than he thinks. This reticence may be natural,\nbut is nevertheless undesirable : if Psychical Research be a science\nand the Revue Metapsychique be a scientific publication, it is not\neasy to see why a contributor should not express openly his\nopinion ndthout having recourse to a sibylline language, which may\nhave its charm but is out of place in such a connection.\nUnder the title of \" Correspondence \" we have a series of\nletters narrating various, as the sub-title says, spontaneous\nmanifestations of paranormal knowledge.\"\" These are of various\nvalue and interest.

Peyrin, Professor at Grenoble, where a name\n\" Elisa Ber\u2014e \" is given in a dream, whilst the real name,\nunknown to Professor Peyrin, was \" Elisa Berger.\" The coinci-\ndence is certainly striking ; to assert, however, that it is\nabsolutely beyond the possibility of chance, especially when taking\ninto account the gigantic number of dreams dreamt, would possibly\nbe a somewhat risky statement.\n\f98 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Mat, 1929\nZeitschrift fiir Psychische Forschung, January, 1929.\nDr. Schroder prints seven further protocols of sittings with Frau\nRudloff.

It ceases rapping when it notices the sign\nwhich it is accustomed through the trainer to associate with the\nend of the rapping. The writer does not seem to be altogether\nsure of the bona fides of some at least of the initiators of these\ndemonstrations. May I be allowed to observe here that it seems to\nme probable that, beyond a certain point of passionate conviction,\nthere may be between bona fides and mala fides a rather wide and\nnebulous margin, where to trace a precise line of demarcation is a\ntask not only difficult but even somewhat futile.

I. An Alleged Premonition of Death.\nThe following case of alleged premonition of death was inquired\ninto on behalf of the Society by Mrs. Brackenbury, whose\nreport is printed below. The report is based upon personal\ninterviews with the dead boy's mother, Mrs. Burdett, and the\nundertaker, Mr. E. Lambert.\nAn interesting case of alleged premonition of death was reported\nin the Leicester Daily Mercury, 29th January, 1929.\nThe deceased, a young man of 27 years of age, died of pneu-\nmonia on January 27th after a week's illness. The account\ngiven in the Press states that before he became ill he had a\npresentiment of death so definite that he ordered his coffin,\nchose four of his friends to be bearers, and arranged that he\nshould be buried by the side of his younger brother who had\ndied and been buried in the village churchyard seven years\nbefore.\nThe case was investigated by the Society and the statements\nmade in the Press were found to be correct, but during interviews\nwith the boy's mother, and also with the undertaker who supplied\nhis coffin, certain information was given which makes it doubtful\nwhether the case can be regarded as one of actual premonition.\n\fJune, 1929 Cases 103\nThe motlier stated that her son had suffered from water on the\nbrain at an early age and that one foot was deformed. He had\nbeen mentally deficient from birth and was a source of constant\nworry and anxiety to her.\nShe could not send him to school as he had not sufficient power\nof concentration to learn even the simplest lessons. As he grew\nolder the only kind of work he was able to do was to deliver\nnewspapers in the village. But in spite of these defects he had\na certain amount of cunning, could talk quite coherently and had\nvery definite ideas with regard to his personal needs and the way\nto satisfy them. There is little doubt that he did, at times,\nrealize that there was something wrong with him and that he\nwas not quite like other boys. Tliis made him morbid, and he\nfrequently expressed a desire to die and showed an unnatural\ninterest in coffins and coffin-making.\nAfter his younger brother's death this interest increased and a\ngreat deal of his time was spent in the undertaker's workshop\n;\nhe spoke more frequently about dying and about his own funeral.\nThe undertaker, who had known the boy for some years, said that\nwhenever a funeral was about to take place, he always came to\nthe shop to watch the coffin being made and showed a decided\npreference for the more expensive kind.\nSome time after his brother's death, while in this workshop\nwatching a coffin being made, he expressed a wish that a similar\ncoffin, but with black handles, might be made for himself as he\nthought he would not live very long. Soon after this he became\nseriously ill with pneumonia, and throughout the illness said that\nhe would not recover. He talked about the arrangements for\nhis funeral and chose four of his friends as bearers for his coffin.\nNevertheless he made a complete recovery.\nThe incidents referred to in the newspaper occurred in January\n1929. On Sunday January 20th he spent the afternoon with the\nundertaker and his family and, after he had left, they all com-\nmented upon his unusually good health and spirits, although,\nduring the afternoon, he had described precisely the kind of cofiin\nhe wished to have, laying special emphasis on his desire for\nexpensive brass fittings. On the previous occasion he had asked\nthat they should be black. He also expressed a wish to be buried\nby the side of his younger brother, and said that he had arranged\nthis with the Vicar. (This statement was corroborated by the Vicar.)\na2\n\f104 Joiirnal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1929\nOn Monday January 21st lie was again taken ill with pneu-\nmonia and again insisted that he would not recover. He desired\nthat four friends should be asked to act as bearers at his funeral,\ngiving his mother their names. They were the same as those\nchosen during his illness seven years before.\nThis time he did not recover ; his death occurred on January\n27th.\nThe fact that an attack of pneumonia was preceded on two\noccasions by a similar presentiment of death suggests that this\npremonition may have been an expression of some physical symp-\ntom which failed to reach the conscious threshold.\nThis case is hardly comparable with those cases of premonitions\nof events {e.g. accidents) occurring suddenly and by chance, since\nsuch events presumably result from causes external to and un-\nknowable by the subject.\nL. 1289. II. A Veridical Dream.\nThe following case of an apparently veridical dream was\nfirst brought to the notice of the Society by a Press cutting\nrelating to an inquest held by the Coroner for East Wicklow\non the body of Patrick Burke, which was found wedged\nbetween two boulders in the Avonmore River.\nFrom the account of the inquest given in the Irish Times\nof the 29th January, 1929, it appears that Patrick Burke, a\nboy of 14, had been missing since the 17th December, 1928.\nOn the evening of that day he was last seen by his father\nplaying with a football, and when he did not return the father\nsearched for him, and failing to get any trace of him sum-\nmoned help. He searched all that night along the Avonmore\nwith Guards and neighbours, and since that day he had been\nsearching frequently with the assistance of a certain Michael\nH. (his name is known to the Society but not printed here).\nThe father's evidence as reported in the Irish Times proceeds\nas follows :\nMichael H. came to him and told him that he had had a\ndream on the night of January 23rd last, in which he thought he\nhad discovered the boy's body wedged between two rocks down\nthe river. The witness went with him along the river, and\n\fJune, 1929 Cases 105\nMichael H. brought him to a particular spot and indicated the\nrocks he meant. Witness took off his boots and stockings and\nwent into the water, put his hands into the water, felt the body\nand lifted it up sufficiently to identify it as that of his son.\nMichael H., who is a mason, gave his evidence as reported\nin the Irish Times as follows :\nHe had assisted in the search for the missing boy, and had\npassed this particular place on January 23rd, but without seeing\nany signs of the body. That night, after midnight, he dreamt\nthat he recovered the body at this spot, and in the morning told\nWilliam Toole about it. Later he told Mrs. Gavin, of Knockrath,\nand finally went to the father of the boy, whom he brought to\nthe spot.\nAs the case seemed an interesting one Miss Newton wrote\nto Mr. Patrick Burke, Senr., and to Michael H., asking them\ncertain questions. In reply to the questions put to him\nMichael H. stated that he had had the dream on the 23rd\nJanuary ; he had had no other dream of the boy since the\nday he was missing, and had never dreamt before of finding\na body or of looking for the body of some one missing.\nMiss Newton also asked the two following questions :\nQ. Were you looking for the body when you passed the spot\na few hours before you had the dream ?\nAns. I had been looking for the body on the evening before\nI had the dream and passed the spot.\nQ. On that occasion did you happen to look at the two rocks\nin the river ? If not, did you notice them in any way, no\nmatter how slightly 1\nAns. Yes, I looked at the two rocks but did not pay any\nparticular attention to them.\nTo Mr. Burke Miss Newton put, among other questions, the\ntwo following :\nIf, when Michael H. told you about the dream, he took you\nstraight to the spot ? Or walked along the river bank until he\nsaw the two rocks, and pointed them out to you as those that\nhe had dreamed of ?\nIf, when you felt the body with your hand, this was the first\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jone, 1929\nindication that it was there ? Or, could you see it before you\nreached the rocks (when you were wading), or when you were\nstanding by them ? Could you say how deep below the water\nit was ?\nTo these two questions Mr. Burke replied as follows :\nThere is a path along the river and Michael H. brought\nme direct along this path until the rocks were in view and then\npointed out the ones he dreamt of.\nOn wading into the water I could see something white, and\nputting down my hands I felt the body ; this was the first\nindication that it was there. There was a kind of suckage under-\nneath the larger rock and the body was in a half-circle around.\nIn my opinion the body was about 18 inches under the water and\nthe legs about two feet.\nIn a letter dated the 19th February Mr. Burke amplifies\nhis answer to the second question as follows :\nI waded into the water and could see something white before\nreaching the rock ; on coming closer I put down my hands and\nfelt the body. I raised it up and found that the force of water\nhad rolled the jersey up towards the shoulders, leaving the shirt\nvisible between the jersey and pants. ... I came out on the\nbank and looked in where the body lay. I could distinctly see\nthe shirt and I told Michael H. that it was quite visible from\nthe bank.\nFrom the same letter a new fact emerges, namely, that\nMichael H. had before his dream suggested to Mr. Burke\nthat he should put a reward in the paper for the recovery of\nthe body, and that Mr. Burke did, in fact, put a reward of \u00a35\nin the paper for any person finding the body. Mr. Burke also\nsays that at the inquest Michael H. was asked by the\nCoroner if he would take the reward and he said he would\nnot, as a friend of the family, \\mt that about two hours after\nthe inquest Mr. Burke offered him the money and he took it.\nMichael H.'s statements as to his dream do not appear to\nhave been always consistent, as, according to Mr. Burke, he\ninformed Mrs. Burke that he was sleeping at Rathdrum when\nhe had the dream, while at the inquest he stated that he had\n\fJune, 1929 Cases 107\nthe dream at Ballinderry. He appears to have the reputation\namong his neighbours of not being quite normal.\nThe Society was very fortunate in obtaining the assistance\nin investigating the case of Father John O'Doherty, M.A., C.C.,\nof Rathdrum, who closely questioned Michael H., and came\nto the conclusion that notwithstanding the facts stated in the\nlast paragraph his account was in the main truthful. Father\nO'Doherty, it should be stated, took a degree in psychology in\nthe National University of Dublin, and a post-graduate course\nin Colimibia University, New York.\nVarious possible explanations, normal and supernormal, of\nthe incident suggest themselves. To deal first of all with\npossible normal explanations, the fact that Michael H.\nsuggested the offering of the reward and subsequently accepted\nit might be taken as tending to show that, at the time he\nsuggested the reward, he had normal conscious knowledge of\nwhere the body was ; Father O'Doherty discusses this possi-\nbility in his first letter. As it was obviously a material point\nwhat interval of time elapsed between the offering of the\nreward and Michael H. reporting his dream, and as this\ndid not appear from the earlier correspondence, enquiries were\nmade of Father O'Doherty, who in his second letter reported\nthat there was an interval of several days. On the assumption\nthat Michael H. knew where the body was when he sug-\ngested the reward, it is not easy to explain why he should\nhave delayed revealing its whereabouts for so many days after\nthe reward had been offered, or why he should have professed\nthat the whereabouts had been revealed to him in a dream.\nOn the latter point it is possible that he thought that by\nfabricating the story about a dream he would favourably\nimpress the boy's father and the neighbours generally ; if this\nwas his supposition he seems to have been gravely in error,\nas the impression he made was, in fact, an unfavourable one.\nMoreover, Father O'Doherty administered a solemn admonition\nto him to tell the truth, in view of the fact that the case\nmight be printed by the Society and that therefore, if his\nstory were untrue, he would be deceiving not only his con-\ntemporaries but future generations, and Michael H. swore\nto him most solemnly and emphatically that the story was true.\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1929\nBearing all these facts in mind we are probably justified in\ndismissing tlie natural suspicions as to normal knowledge raised\nby Michael H.'s suggestion of the reward.\nAnother possible explanation is that Michael H. may have\n\"ubconsciously noted the situation of the body before his dream,\nand this subconscious knowledge may have expressed itself in\nthe dream. Some colour is lent to this hypothesis by the fact\nthat Mr. Burke on being led to the spot where the body was,\nand on wading a short way into the river, saw what proved\nto be the boy's shirt before reaching the rock. Against this\nit must be said that the Civic Guards had been searching\nfor some time past without finding the body, and that it\nappears from Mr. Burke's statement that shortly before the\nbody had been found the water in the river had been higher,\n\" the flood had gone down a great deal.\"\n- There remains the possibility that prior to his dream Michael\nH. had no normal knowledge, conscious or subconscious, of\nthe whereabouts of the body, and that the dream was super-\nnormal and veridical. This is the view adopted by Father\nO'Doherty, who is a trained psychologist, and has personal\nknowledge of all the parties.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, February 1929.\nHerr Johannes Illig, of Goppingen, has a long paper on the\n\" White Lady \" alleged to appear in the castle of Bernstein,\nBurgenland (Austria, formerly Hungary). The case has been\ninvestigated, we are told, by the late Baron von Sclirenck-Notzing,\nwho put himself into communication with the owner of the castle\nthrough a certain Herr Grabinsky, author of a pamphlet on the\nBernstein apparitions, which pamphlet was apparently of a very\ninadequate character. Thanks to Dr. von Schrenck and Herr Illig\nhimself, the evidential character of the case seems to have been\nmuch improved. A series of narratives from persons who were\neye-witnesses of the apparition is printed in Herr Illig's paper,\nthough in every case only initials are given. Most extraordinary\n(and convincing ?) of all : the phantom was photographed, and\nthe photograph and negative are reproduced on pp. 62-65.\n\fJune, 1929 JSfotes on Periodicals 109\nUnfortunately, Herr Illig says he is unable to give details as to the\ncircumstances of the photographic experiments. He asserts, how-\never, that the photograph was taken by the wife of the owner of\nthe castle under conditions excluding \"all deception and trickery.\"\nAs an explanation Herr Illig postulates in the present instance\npost-mortem action. I should agree with him were the case better\nproved ; for I certainly think that one such instance if well\nattested would be more conclusive of post-mortem action than the\nwhole bulk of all the mediumistic trance-utterances in our posses-\nsion. Unfortunately, the evidence cannot be regarded as con-\nclusive. I wish, however, to state once for all that in my opinion\nsuch occurrences as those alleged to occur at Schloss Bernstein\nmust not be rejected d priori.\nDr. Tischner begins a valuable paper on the history of the\nideo-motoric principle.\nDr. Walter F. Prince replies to Frl. 6. Walther's criticism\n{Zeitsch-ift \/. Parapsychologie, July 1928) on the part of his recent\nreport on European physical mediums dealing with Rudi Schneider ;\nHerr R. Lambert, the translator of Dr. Prince's paper, adds to it\na few remarks, and Dr. Walther has the final word. In Dr.\nPrince's reply my attention has been chiefly arrested by his\ncategorical statement that in his opinion there was nothing super-\nnormal in his sittings with Rudi (p. 88) ; and in Studienrat\nLambert's Nachwort by his attempt to explain in a less sinister\nway an incident occurring at these sittings, and strongly suggestive\nof collusion by Father Schneider.\nKleine Mitteilungen informs us of the death of Herr Karl Krall,\nwhose interesting experiments with the Elberfeld horses will be\nremembered by many.\nA prophetic dream dealing with the Great War, and occurring\non June 8th, 1914, is narrated in the words of \" His Excellency\n\"\nDr. von Kahr, the Bavarian ex-dictator. The dream occurred\nto another Excellency, Herr Ferdinand von Miller. It certainly\ndoes not seem to have been written down before the event ; the\nfact that Italy would join the enemies of Germany had long\nbeen foreseen by discerning Austrian and, I think, also German\nmilitary personalities (such as Conrad von Hotzendorff, the Austrian\nField-marshal) ; and this and other particulars of Herr von Miller's\ndream (the participation of America, and Germany's defeat) are in\nno way more striking than a report submitted to the Tsar early\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June, 1929\nin 1914 by M. Peter Dournovo, a former Minister of the Interior\nof Russia. This report, which was published after the Revolution,\nenumerates Russia's allies and enemies in a future war with such\naccuracy as to suggest a forgery fost eventum. And yet there is\nno reason not to believe it authentic. If I can get it, I will,\nwith the Editor's permission, acquaint readers of the Journal with\nthis extraordinary document.\nZeitschrift. fur ParapsycJiologie, March 1929.\nThis number opens with two short notices on the late Dr.\nFreiherr von Schrenck-Notzing, and we are told that the next\nnumber will be specially devoted to him.\nHilda Zwieselbauer {Journal S.P.R., December 1928, p. 405) is\nagain the subject of an exhaustive paper by Herr Wratnik of\nBriinn (Brno), Czekoslovakia. The phenomena described are extra-\nordinary, but by no means convincing. Nor does an investigator\nready to believe in the existence of materialised boots with thick\nand quite new soles (the \" controlling spirit \" having according to\nhis statement three such pairs in his possession [p. 125]) strike\nme as being peculiarly competent.\nIn an Appendix to Herr W.'s report by the late Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing mention is made of Hilda having been three\ntimes detected at Prague, after which she and her sister Irma were\nsent back to Brno at once. Still Herr A. Liebich, a Brno banker,\nwho had after that a series of seances with both sisters, believes\nhimself to have witnessed genuine manifestations.\nDr. W. Achelis of Berlin discusses \" Telepathy and Neurosis\n\"\nin connection with a case in his experience.\nHerr Alfred Schroder (not to be confused with Dr. Christoph\nSchroder) has a paper on \" Modern Physics and Belief in Spirits.\"\nWe are very forcibly reminded\u2014numerous and impressive figures\nbeing quoted a I'appui\u2014of the limitations of our senses, etc.\nThe article is valuable. I confess, however, that I do not believe\na serious student will in our days deny the existence of '\nsjjirits\n'\nsimply because they may be inaccessible to our senses or because\nAve cannot well imagine the conditions of their existence. On the\nother hand, because the reality of that existence is theoretically\nquite possible, it does not necessarily follow that this reality be\na fact.\nDr. R. Tischner brings to a close his paper on the history of\nthe ideo-motoric principle. The name was given to the \" prin-\n\fJune, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 111\nciple \" by William B. Carpenter in 1852 ; the idea itself is of\nmore remote date. In an Appendix to this very valuable article\nour Corresponding Member mentions a significant passage dealing\nwith the divining rod and occurring in a German publication of\n1798. The same idea is there expressed.\nThe late Herr Karl Krall is the subject of three papers. Deal-\ning with him as Tierpsychologe Dr. Zoller, of Munich, expresses the\ncomplete conviction that in the experiments with the Elberfeld\nhorses at which he (Z.) was present in 1912, these horses did\n\" really and independently think \"\n(p. 167).\nIn Kleine Mitteilungen M. Eothy, of Budapest, gives an account\nof a recent judicial trial in Hungary, where the murderers (four\nin number) of a supposed witch were condemned to three months'\nimprisonment at first, and were subsequently acquitted. The case\nis interesting, chiefly, I think, as affording one more illustration\nof the extraordinary effects which may be due to spontaneous\nauto-suggestion. Beyond this I do not think myself justified in\ngoing, chiefly because, as pointed out by M. Rothy, several\nessential details have not been cleared up. Even as it stands, how-\never, this tragic episode (1927-1928) is worthy of serious attention.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, April, 1929.\nThis number opens with a portrait of the late Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing, and a series of articles dealing with his\npersonality and activities by Prof. Specht, Prof. Bleuler, Prof.\nHoffmann, Prof. Freytag, Dr. Siinner (the Editor of the Z. f.\nParaps.) and others.\nDr. Grustav Zeller has a paper on Dr. E. Tischner a propos of\nthe latter's fiftieth anniversary. In reviewing our Corresponding\nMember's literary work he takes exception somewhat to Dr.\nTischner's rather sceptical attitude re the Crookes-Florence Cook in-\nvestigation (p. 219).\nHerr Lambert has the beginning of a very valuable paper on\nErau Giinther - Gefiers's trial at Insterburg (see Journal for July,\n1928). We shall revert to it when finished.\nDr. Paul Bergmann, of Berlin, has a short paper on Psycho-\nmetry, with special reference to the part [supposed to be] played\nby the inanimate object handled by the sensitive.\nHerr Ludwig Jahn, of Cologne, speaks enthusiastically of the\nlesults obtained by him in the same sphere (Psychometry) with\nErau Lotte Plaat (already known to my readers).\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research June, 1929\nZeitschrift fur Psychische ForscJmng, February 1929.\nThis number opens with another instalment of Dr. Mattiesen's\npaper on Cross-Correspondences.

Some will prefer another explanation (that is, admitting\nthe reality of such cases) e.g. such incidents may seem to some\nto suggest not so much continuous post-mortem action as an impres-\nsion produced, we do not know how nor on what, by a person\nstill alive, which impression becomes\n\u2014\nex hypothesi\u2014perceptible to\nsome other person under conditions as mysterious as those of its\norigin. If I mistake not, this theory was formulated for the first\ntime by Mr. Edmund Gurney.\nIn the \" Foreign Chronique \" a narrative is reproduced from\nConstancia, the official organ of the Argentine Spiritistic Federation,\nin which Senor Alfonso Depascale relates a j^ainful incident sug-\ngestive of prolonged telepathic impression from a little grandson\nto his grandmother, coinciding with the child's fatal illness and\ndeath.\nRevue Spirite, March, 1929.\nSignor Bozzano continues to discuss the \" Death Crisis\n'\"\nin spirit\ncommunications ; M.

After her death, three times in succession the canvas\nwas mysteriously taken out of the frame and put on the floor,\neven after the canvas had been tightly fastened to the frame and\nthe latter to the wall. I think this narrative instructive, not per\nse, but because if investigated it is likely to afford us one more\nillustration of the degree of reliability to be placed on such\naccounts when appearing in the daily press.\nM. P. Yotopoulos, a Corfu lawyer, quotes from a Cretan daily\npaper an article dealing with the \" shadows \" said to show\nthemselves every year at Sphakia (Crete).

Eutot is a thorough believer in the authenticity of the facts,\nthough using throughout the word entitij instead of the word\nspirit. Ajmrt from this, his attitude, so far as the question of\ngenuineness is concerned, seems to be identical with that of the\nmost uncompromising spiritist. In the first paper the behaviour\ntowards Eusapia Palladino of the English [Cambridge] experi-\nmenters is stated to have been \" inqualifiahle \"\n(p. 2-5), and in\nthe note on the Mantes seances the conviction is expressed that\nthe phenomena are authentic.\nM.

It is evident that he was in bad\nhealth at the time, and it is possible, as Mr. Evennett points out,\nthat the whole affair was \" a delusion of [a] temporarily un-\nbalanced mind.\" The only clear evidence as to the objective\ncharacter of the disturbances seems to be contained in a letter\nfrom Ockley describing a visit paid to him in prison by one of\nhis daughters, who \" confessed that there were unaccountable\nsounds,\" but \" wished they had been louder.\"\nPsychic Science, April, 1929.\nThis Number contains a further instalment of the report on\n\" The Direct Voice in Italy,\" of which a first instalment appeared\nin the previous issue, January, 1929. Of the phenomena now\ndescribed the most sensational is the alleged transportation of the\nentranced medium, by some supernormal means involving the\npassage of matter through matter, from the seance-room to a\nneighbouring hayloft, a distance of more than sixty yards. Only\nthose persons who are already convinced on other grounds that\nsuch utterly incomprehensible phenomena may, and sometimes do\noccur, are likely to be favourably impressed by the present\nnarrative, which is open to criticism at many points.\nThere is a short article on \" Experiments with the Crewe Circle,\"\ncontributed by Frederic James Crawley, Chief Constable of New-\ncastle-on-Tyne.

The observations of M. Sudre in Psychic\nResearch, March, 1929, p. 144 (see comment below) suggest a\nquestion as to whether it is certain that the light-proof envelopes\nwere absolutely opaque in all parts. Such effects as were observed\ncould undoubtedly be produced by small rays of light filtering\nthrough on to the plates.\nPsychic Research, March, 1929.\nThis Number opens with an unpublished article by \u2022\nthe late\nProfessor J.

E. Dudley brings to a conclusion his article on \" Psychics\nVersus Mediums \" and M. Rene Sudre relates \" Two Adventures\nin Metapsychics and Occultism.\" The first is concerned with the\nclaim of the \" magnetiser \" Joanny Gaillard of Lyons, to induce mum-\nmification of various substances, e.g. fruit and flesh, by the\ninfluence of a fluid emanating from his hands. A Committee of\ninvestigation consisting mainly of doctors was formed in Paris,\nand their conclusion, based upon experiment, was that the exist-\nence of the alleged fluid was not demonstrated. \" After thirteen\nseances the substances '\ninfluenced '\nby M. Gaillard appear to be\nin the same state of putrefaction as the control specimens.\" M.\nSudre also mentions an unofficial experiment designed to see\nwhether the fluid would influence a photographic plate. Gaillard\nand another person (not supposed to possess the fluid) each held\nhis hand for half an hour over a plate in the dark room. \" The\nresults were suj^erb. Development . . . revealed very clear marks\non each plate. But, what was most disconcerting, these marks\nin the case of the check subject were very much brighter than in\nthe case of Gaillard.\" The observed effects were eventually traced\nto a leakage of light \"in a slightly defective window. . . . Inas-\nmuch as Gaillard was further from this source of light leakage,\nhis '\nfluidic image,' photographically reversed like the other, was\nconsiderably feebler.\"\nM. Sudre's second adventure was concerned with a supposed\nmystical system of numbers (inherited from a Hindu hermit),\nwhereby it was alleged that all questions could be satisfactorily\nanswered. M. Sudre's question \" With what scientist did I shake\nhands to-day ? \" proved too much for the occultists, though it was\ncorrectly answered by a lady in the audience, apparently by\nthought-transference from M.

Chesnut of Des Moines, who has on five occasions,\nspread over a period of about 30 years, had visions which,\nthough differing in detail, conformed to the same general type,\nand each of which was followed by news of the death of a\nrelative, the percipient at the time of the vision having no\nnormal knowledge of the death. In one case (the fourth)\nthe death preceded the vision : and in another (the fifth) the\norder of events does not appear very clearly from the state-\nment received : in the three earlier cases the vision preceded\nthe death.\nThe case first came to the Society's notice through an\nanonymous article in an American paper, in which one of the\npercipient's sons gave an account of the first three visions.\nThe latest of these occurred in 1920, and they were all there-\nfore, under the Society's rule, too old to be printed : but so\nunusual a sequence appeared worth investigating. The same\nmember who arranged for the investigation of the Chaffin Will\ncase (see Proceedings xxxvi. 517 ff.) kindly instructed a firm of\nAmerican lawyers (Messrs. Miller, Kelly, Shuttleworth and\n\fJuly, 1929 Cases 121\nMcManus of Des Moines) to obtain a statement from the\npercipient, and any corroborative evidence available.\nThis firm obtained a statement from Mr. Granville E.\nChesniit. which not only gave substantially the same account of\nthe three earlier visions as was given in the newspaper article\n(the discrepancies do not seem to us to cast any doubt on\nthe accuracy of Mr. Granville Chesnut's memory), but also gave\nan account of two visions of the same kind which he experi-\nenced in 1923 and 1926. These more recent visions brought\nthe whole case within the limits of time which the Society has\nset.\nAs the Chesnut family is now scattered, and some of its\nmembers constantly moving from place to place, it was only\nfound possible to obtain from them brief corroborative state-\nments in support of Mr. Granville Chesnut's narrative. ^Vhere\npersons able to give confirmatory evidence are easy to communi-\ncate with, it is of course preferable to put detailed questions\nto them, and to follow these up, if necessary, with supple-\nmentary questions, but that course was in this case impracti-\ncable. However, the confirmation of Mr. Granville Chesnut's\naccount which has been received from no less than four\nmembers of his family (his wife and three sons) is explicit\nenough to counter-balance this defect.\nMr. Granville Chesnut's statement is not dated, but was\nenclosed in a letter from the Des Moines lawyers dated 15th\nFebruary 1928, from which it appears that the statement had\nthen been recently obtained. It runs as follows :\nStatemext of Granville R. Chesnut regarding Certain Visions.\nI AM now a resident of Des Moines, Iowa, and have been such\nresident for practically tw-enty-five years. I am well and thoroughly\nknown in many sections of the State of Iowa. I have reared a\nlarge family. PracticaUy all of those still living are now residents\nin Iowa or adjoining states, all of whom may be called upon for\nthe verification of the things which I set down here as to fact.\nI am now seventy-three years old and enjoy good health, in\nfact, have always enjoyed good health. Throughout my life I\nhave had repeated visions and have received messages from sources\nunknown to me. A few of these in regard to my immediate\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1929\nfamily I set down here in detail. I have no explanation for them ;\nI do not attempt to explain them. I am merely making the\nstatement that what I say here is the truth and is the statement\nof a fact. I was not at any of the times referred to in any\ndifferent frame of mind than was my usual custom and I can\noffer no explanation as to why these messages came to me but\nsimply state that they did come.\nThe first vision to which I will refer occurred about four or six\nweeks prior to February 9, 1897. I was living on a farm just\nnorth of the water of Spirit Lake, Iowa. I was sleeping in my\nbed as usual one night when suddenly there appeared out of I\nknow not where an apparition or form of a young man, weighing\nabout one hundred thirty five pounds, seated on the back of a\nheadless horse, and with his hat in his hand and riding at great\nspeed towards me. He said in a clearly audible voice, \"It is too\nbad, but it cannot be helped.'' I plainly saw the blood flowing\nfrom the breast and down the side of the man. Nothing further\nwas said by the man on horseback and the vision disappeared.\nI immediately discussed this matter with my wife and after her\nassurance that I was mistaken I went back to sleep. Within a\nvery short time I was awakened a second time and the vision was\nrepeated almost in the form it first appeared. 1 then arose and\ninsisted that something was wrong and was sure to happen but\nknew not what it was.\nOn February 9, 1897, my son, James Richard Chesnut, was\naccidentally shot and killed while hunting. The discharge from the\ngun entered his breast in the identical same spot from which\nI had seen the blood flowing on the form I had seen in my\nvision.\nThe next vision that aj^peared to me was about two or three\nweeks prior to the death of my son, Charles Calvin Chesnut, which\noccurred on December 10, 1902. At this time I was stopping over\nnight in a hotel at Randolph, Iowa. The same messenger which I\nhave referred to above, riding the same horse without a head,\nappeared to me during the night, but in place of the seeming\nhurry that had been exhibited in my former vision the horse\napproached in a leisurely manner. The rider said nothing but\npassed slowly on. On account of my former experience I knew\nthat something was wrong and that another calamity hung over\nmy house. I immediately wrote the members of my family of\n\fJuly, 19211 Cases 123\nthe occurrence and all remember it thoroughly to this day. As\nabove stated, within two or three weeks my son, who was at the\ntime in perfect health, died, having contracted typhoid-pneumonia,\nand passed quickly away.\nThe third vision appeared while I was living at Ames, Iowa.\nMy son, Benjamin David C'hesnut was employed as electrician in\ncharge of the electric light plant at Wheatland, Wyoming. On\nthis occasion the same headless horse with the same rider appeared\nto me during the night. The horse rushing into my view and the\nrider again saying, It is too bad, but it cannot be helped.\"\nBoth then disappeared. There was in this vision no sign of blood\nas had been in the first. I again related my experience to the\nfamily and again felt certain that some terrible calamity was about\nto occur. The expected happened. On January 4, 1920, my son,\nBenjamin David Chesnut, was instantly killed while at his work,\nas I have stated above,\n[According to the newspaper article the accident occurred two\ndays after the vision. Ed.]\nMy grand-daughter, Francelle. in June, 1923, was living with her\nmother in the State of California. At that time I was living in\nOmaha, Nebraska. One night during the month of June there\nappeared to me Avhile I was sleeping a vision in which I appeared\nto be standing in the Union Depot in Omaha. The man whom\n1 had seen on the horse in all my other visions came hurrying\ntowards me with a paper in his hand. As I saw him approach I\nsaid, Who are you ? \" He said, \" I am a messenger.\"' I asked,\nA messenger for whom ?\n\"'\nHe replied, \" I am the messenger of\nDeath.\" I then said to him, \"You did not come this time as you\ndid before, \"\nand he replied. \" I just came in on the overland\nlimited train. Did you not hear it run into the depot ?\n'\"\nAnd I\nsaid that I had. Tlie vision then disappeared. I woke up at this\ntime and lay in my bed thinking of what had occurred. Almost\nimmediately the telephone in our house rang and I went to it and\nreceived the message that my grand-daughter, Francelle, had died\nthat day.\nMr. Granville Chesnut then proceeds to give details of his\nfifth vision, which was of the same general type as the others,\nexcept that the death which followed was not, as in the other\ncases, the death of a blood-relative, but of a connection by\n\f124 Joxirnal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1929\nmarriage. At his request we do not print this part of his\naccount in full. His statement concludes as follows :\nThese statements I make in the presence of witnesses, believing\nin their truth, and for such aid and assistance as they may be to\nothers who have such visitations.\nThis statement here recorded was made in my presence and\nunder my direction, accurately taken down in shorthand and such\nshorthand notes carefully and accurately transcribed, and I hereby\ncertify that the foregoing is the true and correct statement made\nin my presence and before me.\nMrs. Granville Chesnut confirms her husband's statement in\nthe following affidavit\n:\nPolk County, i\n'\nI, Juliana Chesnut, oji oath depose and say, that I am the wife\nof Granville R. Chesnut and a resident of Des Moines, Iowa. That\nI have read the statement of Granville E. Chesnut in which he\ndescribes the vision that appeared to him a short time prior to\nFebruary 9, 1897. I wish to say that I have a distinct recollection\nof the happening of the matters therein described. That at the\ntime thereof, as stated in said statement, my said husband dis-\ncussed the same with me and I observed his actions at the time.\nI further state that at the time of the occurrence of the third\n^^siou at Ames, Iowa, described by my said husband in his said\nstatement, that my said husband related said experience to me at\nthe time of the happening thereof and that I observed his de-\nmeanor and believe the statement made in regard thereto is\ncorrect.\nI further state that as to the other incidents described in said\nstatement by my said husband, I believe them to be true for the\nreason that shortly after the occurrence of each he discussed the\n(Sgd.) Granville R. Chesnut\n1349 E. York Street,\nDes Moines, Iowa.\n(Sgd.) Ralph E.-Cole\nNotary Public\nin and for Polk County, Iowa.\nAFFIDAVIT.\nState of Iowa,\n\fJuly, 1929 Cases 125\nsame witli me aud I had opportunity to know of the happening\nof the events stated and described in his said statement.\nFurther deponent saith not.\nJuliana Chesxut.\nSubscribed in my presence and sworn to before me by said\nJuHana Chesnut this 25th day of January, 1929.\nJohn C. Cross\nNotary Public\nin and for Polk County, Iowa.\nMy commission expires July 4. 1930.\nThree of Mr. Granville Chesnut's sons also made affidavits in\nwhich they state that they are acquainted with all the details\nof their Father's statement, that they heard him describe the\ndetails of such statement at the time each vision therein\nrecited took place, and that they have every reason to believe\nthat the statements therein made are true and that the\noccurrences took place as therein described.\nAs already stated there are some discrepancies between the\nnewspaper article, through which the Society's attention was\nfirst drawn to the case, and Mr. Granville Chesnut's statement.\nThe writer of the newspaper article in giving an account of the\nsecond vision speaks of the \" messenger \" as having arrived by\ntrain : according to Mr. Granville Chesnut's statement it was\nthe messenger in the fourth vision who arrived by train, the\nmessenger in the second vision arriving, as in the first and\nthird visions by horse. The writer of the newspaper article, who\nonly mentions three visions altogether, obviously confused his\nrecollection of these two visions. This lapse of memory on his\npart does not appear to us in any way to invalidate Mr.\nGranville Chesnut's statement.\nBefore considering any supernormal hypothesis, the question\narises whether the facts stated exceed the probability of chance\ncoincidence. It is in favour of the hypothesis of chance that\nMr. Granville Chesnut has, as he says, \" throughout his life\nhad repeated visions,\" and that in one case at least (the first)\nfoirr or six weeks elapsed between the vision and the apparent\nfulfilment. On the other hand it is to be noted that the\nnature of the vision varied in the difierent cases, and that the\ndifferences corresponded with differences in the circumstances of\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1929\nthe subsequent deaths. If more detailed examination of Mr.\nGranville Chesnut and the corroborating witnesses had been\npossible, this element of uncertainty might perhaps have been\neliminated.\nIn the fourth case, the death seems to have preceded the\nvision by a few hours, and the case may therefore be one of\ntelepathy. In the three first cases, in each of which the vision\npreceded the death, and the death could not have been foreseen\nby any normal means, we have apparently to choose between\nchance coincidence and supernormal pre-cognition.\nII. Two Hallucinatory Bilocations of the Self.\nWe print below two records (sent to us through Sir Oliver\nLodge) of subjective experiences, both of which involve in\ndifferent ways an apparent bilocation of the self. The first\nexperience\u2014in which the subject, when in a state of great\nphysical exhaustion had a sensation of being for a time out\nof his body\u2014belongs to a type of which there is a good\nnumber of well-authenticated records : a classic example is\nthat of Dr. Wiltze (see Myers's Hmnan Personality, ii. 315).\nThe second case, in which the subject, while in a state of\napparently normal consciousness, had a fully externalised\nvision of himself, appears to be a rather rare type of hallu-\ncination. The phenomenon is discussed in Dr. Paul SoUier's\nPhenomenes d'Autoscopie, pp. 7 fi\". The cases directly observed\nby Dr. Sollier appear to have been associated with some mental\nabnormality, hysteria or obsession ; but he also notes one or\ntwo recorded instances amongst well-known men of letters, e.g.\nGoethe and Musset.\nI.\nThe subject of this experience, Mr. Norman F. Ellison, sent\nsome account of it to Sir Oliver Lodge in May 1927, and wrote\nagain on January 13th 1929, as follows :\n... I am enclosing a copy of the entry referring to this experience,\nas it appears in the War Diary 1 am writing out, thinking you\nmay Uke to have by you some permanent record in case you wish\nto use it sometime ... Nokman F. Ellison. >\n\fJuly, 1929 Cases 127\n20th February, 1916.\nWe left Mouchiet in the early afternoon and after a grueUing\nmarch along a pave road slippery with mud and melted snow,\nreached Beaumetz at night. The briefest halt and then on to\nWailly, immediately behind the line, some eight miles south of\nArras. From there we waded through a winding communication\ntrench, a mile long but seemingly interminable. Liquid mud to\nthe knees and a bitterly cold sleet benumbing us through. At\nlast we reached the front line and took over from the French\u2014\na\nTerritorial Reserve Battalion.\nThe worst trenches we had ever been in. No repairs had been\ndone to them for months and months. At worst, they had\ncollapsed inwards and did not give head shelter ; at best, they\nwere a trough of liquid muck. H. and I in the same traverse and\nstraight away on sentry duty. We were both too utterly fed-up to\neven curse. Bodily exhausted, sodden and chilled to the bone with\nicy sleet, hungry and without rations or the means of lighting a\nfire to boil a dixey of water ; not a dry square inch to sit upon,\nlet alone a square foot of shelter beneath which to have the solace\nof a pipe, we agreed that this was the worst night of concentrated\nphysical discomfort we had come across hitherto\u2014and neither of us\nwere strangers to discomfort.\nSeveral hours of this misery passed and then an amazing change\ncame over me. I became conscious, acutely conscious, that I was\noutside myself ; that the real \" me \"\n\u2014the ego, spirit or what you\nlike\u2014was entirely separate and outside my fleshly body. I was\nlooking in a wholly detached and impersonal way, upon the dis-\ncomforts of a khaki-clad body, which whilst I realised that it was\nmy own, might easily have belonged to somebody else for all the\ndirect connection I seemed to have with it. I knew that my body\nmust be feeling acutely cold and miserable but I, my spirit part,\nfelt nothing.\nAt the time, it seemed a very natural happening\u2014as the\nimpossibilities of a dream seem right and natural to the dreamer\n\u2014\nand it was only afterwards that I came to the realization that I\nhad been through one of the most wonderful experiences of my\nlife.\nIn the morning H. remarked to me upon my behaviour during\nthe night. For a long time I had been grimly silent and then\nsuddenly changed. My wit and humour under such trying circum-\n\f1 28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, ii\u00bb29\nstances, Jiad amazed him. I had chatted away as unconcernedly\nas if Ave had been warm and comfortable before a roaring fire\n\u2014\nas if there was no War on were his exact words I remember.\nI never mentioned a word to H. or anybody else, about my\nspiritual adventure that night. He would not have understood\nand would have laughed at it all, but nothing will shake my\ninward belief and knowledge that on this particular night my soid\nand body were entirely separated from each other.\n11.\nThe percipient in the second case was Metropolitan-Archbishop\nLloyd, Primate of the American Catholic Church, who wTOte to\nSir Oliver Lodge, as follows :\nChicago, Illinois,\nJanuary 2itli, 1929.\nOn Monday (between 4.15 and 4.30 p.m.) January 14th I reached\nmy house at the above address, feeling greatly wearied, sat in my\nchair, took a newspaper in my hand, and almost immediately (very\nunusual with me) fell into a deep sleep, from which, however, I\nwas sharply aroused in about a quarter of an hour (as I perceived\nby the clock). As I awoke I saw an apj^arition, luminous, vapor-\nous, wonderfully real, of myself, looking interestedly and delightedly\nat myself. Some books (among them Strachey's Elizahcth and\nEssex and a copy of the Arabian Nights lying on a table back of\nmy ghost I could see and identify. After I and myself had looked\nat each other for the space of about 5 seconds, my ghostly self\nvanished for a few seconds, only to return in a more definitely\nclear way, but for a few seconds only. I have written this to you\nAvith the thought that you might be familiar with such unusual (?)\nphenomena. The experience was altogether delightful. Myself\nseemed to be nearly thirty years younger than I am now\u2014nearing\nseventy. I was not asleep. I was not dreaming. I j^ositively,\nbeyond any doubt, saw myself looking at myself, as naturally as\npossible, the only difference being that my alter ego (as he sat\nand looked at me) was diaplianous, I was opaque . . .\nFrederic (E. J. Lloyd).\nIn a subsequent letter Archbishop Frederic gave permission\nfor a full use to be made of his report.\n\fJuly, 1929 Dowsing in Bombay 129\nDOWSING IN BOMBAY.\nWhile passing throuoh the press the proofs of The Diviniiuj-Rod\n(1926) by Sir WiUiam Barrett and myself, 1 was only able to add\nas a footnote to the Introduction (p. xxiii) the fact that an\nofficial dowser had been appointed by the Government of Bombay.\n(As a matter of fact I wrote \" Municipality of Bombay,\" but that\nwas a mistake). Since then I have had the opportunity of\nmaking the acquaintance of Major Pogson, the dowser in question\n(who has been specially seconded from his regiment for the purpose\nof taking up this appointment), and of seeing him at work. And\nI now have before me an official Report on the Work of the Water\nDiviner published by the GoA^ernment of Bombay for each of the\nthree periods October 1925-January 1927, 1927, and 1928. From\nthese reports I summarize the following facts.\nAgriculturists who have failed to find Avater by normal means\n(that is, by engineering advice and the like) are invited to apply\nfor the assistance of the so-called Water Diviner. U]) to .January\n1927 over 1700 such applications had been received. On the 21st\nof August 1926, under the provisions of Government Resolution,\nRevenue Department, No. 9182, Government guaranteed the Water\nDiviner's success to the extent that if water was not struck in any\nof the sites pointed out by him a cultivator would be recompensed\n50 per cent, of his expenses up to a sum of Rs. 400. Up to the\nend of 1927 (later figures are not available) one such refuml had\nbeen made.\nUp to the end of 1928 Major Pogson prospected exactly 750\nareas, in 13 districts, chiefly Dharwar, West Khandesh. Bijapur\nAhmednagar, and Belgaum. In 439 of these areas he indicated\nsites where he declared water would be found at specified depths.\nOf these, owing to various difficulties, only 81 have been fully\nexcavated (many others are in progress). In 79 of these 81 wells\nwater was duly struck, though in six of these cases the supply\nwas negligible or gave out. On 16 additional sites situated in\n\" precarious tracts,\" preliminary bores were sunk. Every bore was\nsuccessful, eight of them being certified by the Engineer of the\nDistrict Local Board, the others having apparently been made\nprivately.\nPrecise details as to the conditions and circumstances under\nwhich the successful wells were sunk are unfortunately wanting.\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psycldeal Research Jlly, 1929\nBut I liave been assured by Major Pogson that lie does not visit\nsites on which wells are required until normal methods of finding\nwater have been tried and have failed, and that in nearly all the\nfields where his successful wells have been put down there are\nothers, normally sunk, that are absolutely dry. Subject to veri-\nfication of these facts, the figures given above undoubtedly mark\na considerable step forward in the regularity and reliability of the\ndowsing faculty. And as regularity and reliability are almost\nessential to a thoroughly scientific investigation, the importance of\nMajor Pogson's work is obvious.\nTheodore Besterman.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue Spirite, April 1929.\nM.

Vol. xxxv, gave him\nmuch food for reflection. \" Ce rapport est inquietant \" M. Sage\nconcludes his paper by reproducing Mr. David Gow's letter in\nour Journal for February 1928.\nZeilschrift fur Psychische Forschunc\/, April 1929.\nProf. Dr. Blacher has the beginning of a paper on the Riga\nseances and mediums (Frau \" Ideler,\" Frau \" Katoda,\" Herr\n' Paleas,\" and others). Judging by some passages of the paper,\nscientific methods of investigation do not find favour with the\nRiga Psychical Researchers ; as to the physical phenomena, they\nconsist chiefly of \" apports \" of a more or less \" spontaneous\n\"\ncharacter, a circumstance hardly calculated to make observation\nworthy of the name easier.\nDr. Christoph Schroder begins the description of experiments\nwith Baroness von Vangel and another lady, similar to those with\nHerr Max Rautenberg {.fournnl S.P.R. November 1928, p. 373).\n\fJuly, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 131\nIt is asserted that in the experiments with Baroness v. Vangel\nresults were obtained 1,043,217,000,000 times superior to what\nchance pure and simple could have given. No grounds are adduced\nfor this statement, as to which a certain doubt may well seem\nlegitimate.\nDr. A. Mattiesen has a further instalment of his ])aper on cross-\ncorrespondences .\nThe same writer devotes four pages to the account of the\nMillesimo sittings in the Castle of the Marquess Centurione Scotto,\ndescribed in Psychic Science for January 1929. It is significant\nthat Dr. Mattiesen himself admits that the seances in question\npresent suspicious features (pp. 127-128).\nDr. Schroder has a short article on a lecture on \" Lord\nNorthcliffe's return \" by Mr. Hannen SwafEer in Berlin, in March\nlast, and identifies himself with the unfavourable comments of\nthe Berlin press.\nZeitschrift fiir Psychische Forschung, May 1929.\nProf. Blacher continues the description of spiritistic seances in\nRiga, the medium being Frau Ideler. This lady is a very valu-\nable subject for scientific investigation, he asserts ; which statement\ndoes not appeal to me as being based on incontrovertible fact.\nThe English cross-correspondences are again discussed by Dr.\nMattiesen. Dr. Christopher Schroder has an article in memoriam\nGuzik ; he also narrates in detail further experiments in the dark\nwith Herr Max Rautenberg and others. These deal chiefly with\nthe sense of sight, but also with the sense of smell. It is alleged\nby Dr. S. with regard to a particular series of such experiments\nwith Herr Rautenberg and the Baroness von Vangel that the\nresults obtained were to chance-coincidence as 1 to about 1 quin-\ntillion, a claim which to some will appear as rather minimising\nthan enhancing the value of Dr. Schroder's account. Be this as\nit may, some of the results narrated are unquestionably curious,\nand we hope that the promised forthcoming instalment dealing\nwith the psychology of animals will be more interesting still.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsychologie, May 1929.\nThis number again opens with a series of articles on the late\nBaron von Schrenck-Notzing by Prof. Richet, Mme Bisson, Prof.\nZimmer, Herr Rudolf Lambert and others. Herr Lambert alludes\nto the suspicious circumstances supposed to have come of late to\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, V.)2'J\nlight in connection with the photographs taken of Eva C.'s (Marthe\nBeraud's) performances ; and whilst admitting that they detract\nfrom the value of the late Dr. Geley's testimony re the pheno-\nmena,\" he maintains that a good deal remains imexplained up to\nthe present day.^ When speaking of the Schrenck-Notzing investi-\ngation of the Schneider phenomena, Herr Lambert states that he\nrepeatedly urged upon the Baron the desirability of the mediums\nbeing tested by different commissions in various places, but un-\nsviccessfully. Herr Lambert thinks this refusal on Dr. von Schrenck's\npart was a tactical mistake. Be this as it may, we should avoid,\nI think, making positive results depend too exclusively on an\nassumption of the bond fides of one and the same observer, whoever\nthis observer may be.\nHerr R. Lambert has also a further instalment of his valuable\npaper on Frau Giinther-Geffers's trial at Insterburg, which paper\nis as yet unfinished.\nAn article on living for some time without food, with sjjecial\nreference to Konnersreuth. by Dr. Walter Kroner is reproduced\nfrom the AerztUche Rundschau.

Lambert brings to a close his valuable paper on Frau\nCTunther-GefJers's Insterburg trial begun in the April number. He\nanalyses the evidence thoroughly and impartially, showing the pros\nand cons and not omitting the suspicious items, of which there\nare not a few. His conclusions are partly favourable to Frau\nCt.-G.'s claims. If there were a German S.P.R., he thinks, it\nought certainly to test the Konigsberg clairvoyant. With this\nI agree. Herr Lambert is quite right in repeatedly pointing out\nthe difference between this clairvoyant's propensity to give sur-\nnames and the avoidance of the same by mediums and clair-\nvoyants in general.\nIn Kleine MitteiluHgen we are informed that on the initiative\nof Frau Eiro Hellberg, a Swedish authoress, a SvensJca Centralen\nfor PsykisJi Farskning (Broffningg, 28, Stockholm) has been founded.\nThis Centralen will give two courses of lectures in July at Wisby,\nGotland, at which Prof. Hans Driesch is to speak and Prof.\nBlacher, of Riga, is to bring a medium for apports.\nAn interesting case of stigmatisation said to have occurred at\nRoccamontina.

In the first, reference is made to Prof. Richet's\n\" astonishing \" experiments with Marthe Beraud (\" Eva Carriere)\nat Algiers, though he thinks some of his later observations with\nthe same \"\"\nmedium \" in Paris \" still more decisive perhaps.\"\nDr. Osty prints a very long paper on '\"\nWhat Medicine has to\nexpect from the experimental study of man's paranormal psychical\nfaculties.\" A particularly interesting part of this paper is devoted\nto some experiments made in October 1927\u2014March 1928 with Mme.\nOlga Kahl, of Paris (a Russian by birth) on the phenomena of\nwhat he calls \" demographism of thought.\" These experiments\nare very striking. They certainly seem to suggest (what we call)\nthought transference coupled with the power of reproducing the\nword or drawing thought of on the \" subject's \" skin. It is much\nto be desired that Mine. Kahl will be thoroughly and systemati-\ncally investigated.^\nIn the same number of the B.

April 1929.\nMonsieur Sudre, during the com-se of an article on dowsing, brings\nto bear perhaps unnecessarily heavy artillery against a French pam-\nphlet in which the phenomena of dowsing are once more, and\nstill without justification, related to those of electricity. Mr. Bond\ncontinues his witness to the souFs survival, again bringing for-\nward the Glastonbury scripts. Mr. Arthur Goa.dby attempts to\ndefend the claims made for the supernormal nature of the feats\nof the pony Black Bear, by ridiculing the suggestion that secret\nsignals are given to the pony by the trainer, who is always\npresent during the pony's performances. Mr. Bird publishes the\nrecords of the sittings held by a group of ladies of no known\nmediumistic faculty. At these sittings, by means of table-tilting,\nmessages were received in which information was given concerning\na considerable number of individuals, stated to be imknown to\nthe sitters, which information has been subsequently verified from\nvarious sources. I am not satisfied that adequate .steps have been\ntaken to establish the claim that the indi-snduals identified were\nunknown to any of the sitters ; and the methods of authentifica-\ntion in general are somewhat scrappy. But if the published\nmaterial could be taken at its face value it would form a case\nof quite exceptional interest.\nDr. Biu^ns publishes the first case of a new series descriptive of\nDr. Bull's treatment of apparent obsession (cp. Proceedings, xxxviii.\n388 ff.). M. Sudre writes of the life and works of Schrenck-\nNotzing, with whose mind his own was \"in strong synchronism\n[s?'c] \" (p. 250). M. Sudre concludes that his subject \"has the\nimmense merit of having established definitely the reality of the\nphysical phenomena of metapsychics \"\n(p. 255). Mr. H. 0. Evennett\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, i929\nprints a series of letters written in 1718 by Simon Ockley, Professor\nof Arabic at Cambridge, describing circumstantially certain pol-\ntergeist phenomena observed by him. Mr. Bond has another\ninstalment of his witness to the soul's survival. Mr. Bird begins\nthe publication of what he calls a layman's survey of psychic\nresearch, amplified from his public lectures.\nIn tlie Bulletin de VInstitut Geneml Psychologique for 1908 (viii.\n105 sqq.) ]\\I. Jules Courtier published an important report of\nsittings held at the Institut with Eusapia Palladino (this report\nwas re-issued in book form). At the request of Herr Lambert\n(cp.

These conclusions are that the phenomena observed with\nEusapia were such that, while he does not consider it to have\nbeen scientifically established that they were genuine, he is sub-\njectively convinced that they were.\nMr. JJingwall contributes an article entitled \" The Crisis in\nPsychical Research \" to the May (i. 68 sqq.) issue of The Realist.\nThe nature of the crisis does not emerge from the article, which\nis in fact another attack on the S.P.R. The Society, in the\nwriter's opinion, \" at one time had a reputation, not altogether\nundeserved, for caution and discretion \"\n(p. 71), but it is now in\na condition of \" internal decay \" (p. 78) which has unfortunately\ncaused it to lose Mr. Dingwall's confidence. This loss might be\nmore regrettable if Mr. Dingwall showed any capacity for adding\nany concrete or constructive suggestions to his purely destructive\npolemics. Th. B.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Veley Scripts.\nDear Editor,\nI have made a few notes on the \" Margaret Veley \" case,\nwliich may perhaps be of some interest to readers of the Journal,\nand may prompt them to send you their own reflections on this\nrather puzzling case.\n1 . Mr. F. inclines to accept two conclusions\n:\n(\u00ab) That some agency external to his own mind is involved\n(p. 363).\n\fJuly, 1929 Correspondence 137\n(b) That the characterisation does not justify the claim that\nM. V. offers good evidence of identity (p. 330).\nI agree with both conclusions. Since it is obvious, however,\nthat the facts referred to in the Script were (at one time at\nleast) within the memory of M. V., the problem is : How did the\nmemories of M. V. get into the automatic script of Mr. V. ?\nMr. V. offers no solution of this problem.\nThe hypothesis I would suggest is : that an intelligent, discarnate\nagent derived these statements from M. V. and transmitted them\nto Mr. V. If this is what occurred several perplexing features\ncan be accounted for.\nThe impersonal character of the communication would seem\nquite natural if M. V. was merely giving information to some\nmember of a group on the \"Other Side.\"\" There is no reason to\nsuppose that she would care to communicate direct, not being\ndrawn to do so by any bond of personal affection, and possibly\nbeing aware that her relations on earth \" dislike any canvassing\nof the possibility of their dead kinswoman and friend having\n'\ncommunicated '\nthrough perfect strangers \"\n(p. 283).\nThose who are already convinced on other evidence that there\nis such a group of Psychical Researchers on the \" Other Side,\"\nwho are working to produce evidence of survival, will find this\nhypothesis consistent with their convictions.\n2. What then is meant by the statement, \" Margaret Veley is\nhere \" ? (p. 285). When the operator from the B.B.C. says, \" We\nare going over to Birmingham,\" we understand him to mean that\na connection is made with Birmingham. I understand this state-\nment, \" M. V. is here,\" in the same sense.\n3. If this interpretation is correct the result would naturally be\na blend of M. V.'s memories, the agent's mentality and the\ncolouring of the medium's mind (p. 333). This sort of amalgam\noccurs under ordinary circumstances on this Side. We all (pro-\nbably) know persons who are particularly liable to assimilate the\nideas, and even to imitate (unconsciously) the manner of those\nthey are with\u2014Mediumship involves this tendency to unintentional\nassimilation. Our experiences of this sort of blend in normal life\nillustrate what occurs in mediumistic experiences.\n4. Whether the fact that some of the statements made have\nbeen in print had any effect on the information given we cannot\nyet know, but we can see that for the purpose of verification the\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1929\nselection of such facts was wise. The selection shown is a feature\nto be accounted for (p. 362). It seems impossible to account for\nit except by assuming that an intelligent agent is operating.\nIf this hypothesis is accepted it is probable that it will afford\na clue to the Gordon Davies case. In that case G. D. was\nunconscious that his mind was being tapped ; and this may be\nthe reason why the selective character of the statements made is\nperhaps a less prominent feature and certainly the information is\nless complete. The prevision in that case introduces a fresh\nproblem not in the Mr. V. case.\n5. The confusion about names offers no difficulty to me, because\nI am familiar with it in myself. I have great difficulty in pro-\nducing familiar names and I have often to resort to similar\nmethods to those used by mediums in order to recall them. For\ninstance, I constantly have to recall the name of Polyanthus\nwhen I want to mention that well-known flower by remembering\na friend called Polly !\nThere is another detail in this connexion which I have observed,\nbut cannot explain. I have repeatedly found that a medium will\ngive a second name\u2014or a quite unfamiliar name\u2014when describing\na personality I recognize. The name I associate with the person\nbeing, apparently, more diflficult to pronounce although it is quite\nsimple.\nIt would be interesting if students would point out in the\nJournal details in the M. V. record which either support the above\nhypothesis, or which seem inconsistent with it.\nH. A.

We congratulate the Institut on this happy develop-\nment and wish it success in its future activities.\nCASE.\nL. 1290. Telepathy at a Distance.\nWe print below a case of apparent telepathy, in which Mrs\nElliott was the percipient. It was first brought to our notice\nby Sir Oliver Lodge. Writrug to Sir Oliver, Mrs. Hammond\n[pseudonjTtn] described the incident in question in the following\nwords :\nI bought Mrs. Elliott (nee Ortner) three night-dresses for a\nbirthday-present, one white, one salmon pink, and one pale pink,\nwithout mentioning the fact to anyone. At 9.15 a.m. on the 5th\nApril (her birthday) she telephoned to thank me for the three\n\" nighties,\" and when I asked if she had already received them\nshe replied \" No, but Mr. Hammond [deceased] has just shown\nthem to me, and told me that you chose three, one being white\nand the other two of different shades.\" The parcel was not\ndelivered to her until 11.45 a.m. that day, and she has a reliable\nwitness to prove that it arrived at that hour !\nI enclose my letter to her for you to see that I never gave her\nthe faintest clue as to the contents of the parcel, and this is the\nfirst time that I have given her anything in the way of clothing\n\u2014it has always been money or flowers. . . . [Letter dated 6 April\n1929.J\nThe relevant portion of Mrs. Hammond's letter to Mrs. Elliott is :\nYou will be receiving a parcel from Selfridge's, and I wish I\nwere there to enjoy your amusement at its contents ! I only hope\nthey will be to your taste, but if in any way you don\"t approve,\nwill you please not hesitate to return them to me, as they have\npromised to change them. [Letter dated 4 April, postmark 5 April,\n1929.]\nMrs. Elliott's account of the incident follows :\nOn Friday morning, 5th April, 1929, I had a letter from Mrs.\nHammond with good wishes for my birthday. She said that she\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobek, 1929\nwas sending me a parcel from Selfridge's, and wished she could be\npresent to see me open it as she thought I would find its contents\n\" amusing.\" I read this letter at about 8 a.m.\nAt about 9 a.m. I had forgotten about this letter while reading\nanother from Sir Oliver Lodge, when Mr. Hammond suddenly\nappeared and said\n\u2014\" They are nightdresses Mrs. Hammond is\nsending you.\"\nThen he showed me a white one\n\u2014\" and there are two other\nshades,\" he said.\nI looked at the clock and saw it was ten minutes past nine.\nI went downstairs to ring up Mrs. Hammond at once in case\nSelfridge's van might call.\nMr. HammomVs tests have always been correct otherwise I would\nnot have ventured to telephone this one.\nI greeted Mrs. Hammond with the words\n\u2014\" Thank you for the\nnighties !\n\"\nShe said\n\u2014\" Oh ! have they come ?\n\" and I replied \" No !\n\"\nShe went on\u2014 Well, how do you know they are nighties ?\n\"\nand I answered\n\u2014\n\" Mr. Hammond has just told me that you are sending nighties,\nand that one is white and there are two of other shades.\" [Dated\n10 June 1929.]\nThe following corroborative statement has been obtained from\nMiss E. Simmon, Mrs. Elliott's daily maid :\nOn Friday morning, 5th April, I was working at Mrs. Elliott's\nhouse, 48, Basing Hill, Golders Green, and saw Selfridge's Delivery\nVan arrive at 11.45 a.m. The van man handed in a parcel which\nMrs. Elliott opened in my presence and this contained three night-\ndresses\u2014one white, one pale pink and one salmon-coloured. The\nbox was marked\u2014\" Not to be delivered before Friday.\" [Dated\n10 June 1929.]\nThe pm:chase of the three nightgowns has been verified from\nMessrs. Selfridge's original invoice, and the delivery instructions\non the parcel, together with the day and time of delivery,\nw^hich was between 11.30 and 12.0 a.m. on the 5th of April,\nfrom their Delivery Note and Remittance Release Slip ; the\nlatter particulars were fm^ther corroborated by a representative\nof the firm.\nIt being thus apparently clear that Mrs. Elliott could not\n\fOctober, 1929 Case 145\nhave had any normal knowledge of the natiire of the present\nshe was to receive (beyond the fact that it probably consisted\nof articles of wear), nor any reason to anticipate it. how did\nknowledge of the nightgowns and their colours reach Mrs.\nElliott's mind ? It is possible that, as Jirs. Elliott herseK\nsupposes, the spirit of Mr. Hammond acted as intermediary.\nBut as all the facts were known to Mrs. Hammond, and vividly\npresent in her consciousness in connection with Jlrs. Elliott and\nthe anticipated surprise the latter would receive on opening the\nparcel, and as the two ladies are in rather close rapport, this\nwould rather seem to be a case of direct thought-transference\nfrom Mrs. Hamynond to Mrs. Elliott. It is well known that\nsuch telepathic impressions are often externahsed in the form\nof spirit communications.\nCORRESPONDEJsTE.\nThe Veley Scripts.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I have read with interest Miss Dallas's comments on the\nMargaret Veley case [Proceedings, xxx.viu. 28]. She agrees with\nme that the scripts do not afford satisfactory evidence that the\nsurviving mind of ^largaret Veley was their author ; but it seems\nto me that in her anxiety to find a spiritualistic interpretation at\nall costs, Miss Dallas invents an entirely arbitrary hypothesis. She\nsays in efiect : Margaret Veley herself did not write these scripts ;\nlet us suppose therefore that the spirit of some other dead person\nunknown wrote them. I presume from letter that she would\nadvance the same \" explanation \" in the Gordon Davis case.\nGordon Da-vds himself did not commimicate but some other (dead)\nperson tapped his mind. A similar argument was put forward by\nj\\Ir. E. W. Dusbury in Light [27 February, 1926, xlvi. 100] in\nreference to the case of John Ferguson. Mr. Duxbury suggested\nthat though John Ferguson was clearly not the individual he\nclaimed to be he was an actual spirit who had been hypnotised\nby the sitter into behaving as if he were the fictitious John\nFerguson !\nWhy, I ask, this constant and unjustified assumption that the\nintelligence communicating must be that of some dead person 1\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1929\nWhy should it not be the subconscious part of the medium's or\nsitter's mind ? Why must the hypothetical spirit of a dead person\nbe introduced at every juncture when there are living minds with\nunexplored potentialities to draw upon for an explanation ?\nIt cannot be too strongly urged that until the invention of\narbitrary hypotheses of the agency of unknown departed spirits is\nbanned from psychical research no progress will be made. An\nhypothesis in science to have any value must lead somewhere and\ngive us some intellectual control over the phenomena we are\nstudying. It is surely wiser to admit ignorance than to invent\nsterile hypotheses which lead nowhere.\nYours, etc.\nS. G. SOAL.\nOBITUARY.\nRichard Baerwald.\nPsychical research in Germany has sustained another loss\nthrough the death of Dr. Richard Baerwald, which occurred in.\nBerlin in May last after a long illness.\nTo Dr. Baerwald's able pen belong (in addition to important\ncontributions to normal psychology), two important works bearing\non our researches : the second volume, devoted to the mental\nphenomena, of Okultisnius in UrJcunden (Berlin 1925, reviewed\nin Proceedings, xxxvi. 340), and Okultismus und Spiritismus\n(Berlin 1926, reviewed in Journal, xxiii. 99 and xxiv. 289).\nDr. Baerwald was thoroughly sceptical about the physical\nphenomena and also about clairvoyance, as contradictory of his\nWeltanschauung, which excluded both belief in a future life and\nof every transcendent faculty supposed, by some, to belong to\nthe human \" soul.\" In telepathy, on the contrary, he did\nbelieve, and seems to have viewed it as a physical faculty pure\nand simple. It is significant of his mentality that in Die\nintellel'tuellen Phdnomene, on the whole a capital work, the main\npart of his efiort as critic of the experiments cited is devoted\nnot so much to the attempt to disprove the hypothesis of\nfraud as by the endeavour to show that explanation by thought-\ntransference is adequate as against the clairvoyance theory.\nTo say this is not by any means to disparage Dr. Baerwald's\nwork. ...\n\fOctober, 1929 Review 147\nFor some three years he was Editor of the Zeitschrift fiir\nhritischen Okkultismus, which unfortnaately ceased to appear in\n1928. As a frequent contributor to that review I had often\nthe occasion to correspond with Dr. Baerwald (whom I never\nsaw), and of this intercourse I have preserved the best possible\nrecollection. I am sorry he is no more. Sit ei terra levis.\nP.-P.-S.\nREVIEW.\nCase Studies Bearing upon Survival. By John F. Thomas.\nBoston Society for Psychic Piesearch, 346 Beacon Street,\nBoston. 1929. 8vo. pp. 150. Price, $1.50.\nThis volume is the first instalment of what promises to be a\nvery important investigation. Mr. Thomas tells us that he had\nbeen interested in psychical research and read a good deal on the\nsubject for more than thirty years before his wife died in 1926,\nbut it was only after that that he began seriously to investigate per-\nsonally. He had sittings with Mrs. Soule of Boston in July 1926,\nand between then and the end of March 1929 had had in person\nor by proxy 214 sittings with seventeen different mediums, viz. :\nMrs. Soule and sixteen mediums in London. These were all fully\nrecorded, and the present volume gives extracts from these records\nshowing knowledge acquired, to all appearance supernormally,\narranged as twenty-four \" Cases \"'\nunder different heads according\nto the subject referred to, and selected as representative of the\nwhole material. The principal communicator purported to be Mr.\nThomas's deceased wife, and knowledge is shown of her charac-\nteristics, physical and mental, of places, events, and people they\nhad both known and of present circumstances concerning himself.\nMr. Thomas was himself the sitter on 101 occasions, and on 93\nothers the sitting was held on his behalf by a secretary-steno-\ngrapher not at any time acquainted with the communicator. In\nthe remaining 16 the sitter was usually his son, J. G. Thomas, and\nin four Dr. J. B. Rhine or Dr. Louise Rhine. Counting the four\ndifferent secretary-stenographers employed there were nine sitters\nin all.\nMr. Thomas tells us that this \" present publication is, in every\nsense, merely a preliminary report \"\n(p. 11), and he adds (p. 149)\nthat he intends \" to submit later the results of a second study of\n\f148 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1920\nthese mediumistic experiments which is to be made as a problem\nin Psychology.\" With a view to this he is studying in the psy-\nchological department of Duke University, North Carolina. The\namount of his material, the unity provided by a single investigator,\ncombined with the variety in mediums, sitters, and conditions,\nshould furnish a rich field for examination, and with an investi-\ngator of Mr. Thomas's perseverance and carefulness, we may hope\nthat considerable light may be thrown on the process and origin of\ncommunication.

Price,\n$1.00.\nThis number contains, besides business notices of the Boston\nSociety, accounts of a number of spontaneous and experimental\npsychical experiences, telepathic, premonitory, and other, of varying\ndegrees of interest and evidential value, but all worth recording.\nMore than half the little volume, however, is occupied by a careful\nexamination by Dr. Walter F. Prince of \" Tests for Historicity\n\"\nin the case of three publications, viz. : The Archho Volume, edited\nby W. D. Mahan, printed in 1913 ;\n\" A Prophecy made in 1732,\"\npublished in the Home Magazine (Washington) in 1900 ; and The\nScripts of Cleophas, published in London in 1928. The first two\nare effectively shown to be literary forgeries not written at the\ndates claimed for them. The last is in a different category. It\nis automatic writing by the hand of Miss Geraldine Cummins, and\nclaims to be inspired by \" Cleophas,\" an early Christian, contem-\nporary of the Apostles. There is no reason to suspect any\nintentional deception on the part of Miss Cummins, for automatic\nwriting is, as we know, liable to produce dream stuff. But Dr.\nPrince gives reasons from internal evidence of the script for be-\nlieving that the author was not a Jew of the first century a.d.\nHe makes historical mistakes which a Jew of that date would not\nhave made. The knowledge shown of the English language we\nmay of course attribute to the automatist, but it is curious that\narchaic forms (not always correct) should be used, even allowing\nfor her knowledge of the Authorised Version of the Bible. Those\nwho are interested in the Scripts of Cleophas should certainly read\nDr. Prince's criticism. E. M. S.\n\fOCTOBEK, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 149\n^(\u2022i(u<at E\/3\u20aci'i'at, January-December 1928.\nThis \" metapsychical review \" is the official organ of the Greek\nSociety for Psychical Research : it was founded in 1925, but the\npresent volume is the first which has come under our notice. It\nis clear that Dr. Angelos Tanagra and the group of fellow-en-\nthusiasts in Athens who were responsible for the establishment of\nthe society and its journal have had many difficulties to contend\nI with, and they are to be congratulated u^^on their courageous\nattempt. That science in Greece has not yet escaped from theo-\nlogical tutelage is indicated by the prominence given in this volume\nto a series of articles on the biological evidence for the existence\nof God, and also by the somewhat superfluous vehemence with\nwhich nineteenth century materialism is elsewhere denounced. In\nanother article the spiritistic hypothesis is rejected on the similar\nground that habitual intercourse with spirits liberated from the\nf\nbody would lead to widespread suicide and thereby frustrate the\ndesign of Providence. But it must be remembered that science in\nthe Balkans is still in its infancv, and that its friends are com-\npelled to walk warily. The most interesting of the articles in this\njournal deal with a series of experiments in long-distance tele-\n1\npathy between a group of members of the Greek S.P.R. at Athens\nand a group of members of the Institut Metapsychique at Paris\nunder the direction of M. WarcoUier. Some striking successes are\nclaimed, and it is to be hoped that a complete record of all the\nexperiments, successful and otherwise, will be made available later.\nTelepathic powers would seem to be unusually common in Greece :\none writer, dealing with experiments in telepathy between different\nclasses in a school, organised by the masters, claims that ten\nschool-children in fifty possess such powers in a recognisable\ndegree ; but the details given are insufficient to enable me to\njudge whether this is so or not. Other articles deal with experi-\nments in clairvoyance, with experimental study of the effects of\ni the Mexican drug peyotl, and with the sensational story of the\nSpetsa hauntings (which is explained by a theory of \" psychic\ntraces \" plus telepathy plus ectoplasm). We hope that the Greek\nS.P.R. will have a long and successful career, and that it will not\nallow prejudice or persecution to divert it from the path of strict\nimpartiality and opeu-mindedness.\nE. R. D.\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1929\nRevue MetapsycJdqiie, May-June 1929.\nM. de Vesme begins an interesting study of \" Obsession and\nPossession in tlie Far East and in Uncivilised Countries.\" The\nevidence adduced in this first instalment and borrowed almost\nexclusively from the Rev. John L. Nevius's Demon Possession (New\nYork 1893 [sic, read Chicago, etc. 1894]) does not imply more than\nauto-suggestion or suggestion, but we are apparently to expect\nmore impressive testimony (chiefly from Eoman Catholic sources)\nfurther on (p. 183).\nThe French text of M. Jules Courtier's letter to Herr Lambert\non Busapia recently printed in Zeitschrift fur Parafsychologie in\nGerman translation is given verbatim [cp. Journal xxv. 136],\nDr. Foveau de Courmelles prints a short note on \" The Memory\nof Matter,\" and M. Frank Grand] ean, Professor of Philosophy at\nGeneva University, has a long paper on Le ';noi' et le 'je\\\"\nbeing a lecture delivered under the auspices of the Centre inter-\nnational permanent de recherches psychiques. The connection of\nboth these productions with our researches is of the slightest.\nM. Grand] can's negative attitude towards William James's theories\nshould be noted. M. Charles Quartier's reviews of books are as\nusual excellent reading. In the Chronique a long letter is printed\nin which Dr. Crandon of Boston answers at length M. Maire's\ncritical remarks about Margery \" in the January-February num-\nber of the Revue (cp. Journal, xxv. 97), M. Maire replying in\nfootnotes. Dr. Crandon's arguments are not always above criti-\ncism and on one particular point are almost suspiciously feeble.\nAn apparently telepathic dream occurring to an American living\nin Paris is printed. If no practical joke was played on M.\nCharles Quartier, which hypothesis the latter rejects, the case may\nbe regarded by some as interesting.\nExperiments with Frau Lotte Plaat are quoted by M. Maire,\nwho seems favourably impressed by Dr. Siinner's report on this\n\" sensitive.\"\nZeitschrift fur Psychische Forschung, June 1929.\nDr. Christoph Schroder has another instalment of his paper on\nthe \" Metaplasma-Phanomenik,\" with photographic plates, most\u2014if\nnot all\u2014of which are already known (and look decidedly suspicious).\nThe names of many old friends adorn the paper, such as those of\nEusapia Palladino, Florence Cook, \" Katie King,\" Mrs. d'Esperance,\n\fOctober, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 151\netc. An interesting incident is quoted from the Bottazzi seances\nwith Eusapia in April-May 1907, at Naples, when a \" materialised\n\"\nhand melted away in Prof. Bottazzi's grasp. Such episodes have\nalways seemed to me to present a certain difficulty in the way of\na natural explanation of teleplasmic \" phenomena.\"\nThe English Cross-correspondences are again discussed by Dr.\nMattiesen.\nHere Driessen narrates mysterious raps which frequently occur in\nhis presence and which have sometimes shown an intelligent pur-\npose. Some may possibly be explained, judging from what the\nwriter says, by practical jokes played by young people living in\nthe same house ; whether all can be so explained is another\nmatter. The writer (a former judge) has also experienced dreams\nof an apparently supernormal character, as Dr. Schroder informs us\nin another place (p. 190).\nThe last mentioned writer describes what may have been a good\ncase of spirit identity occurring at a spiritistic seance. The inci-\ndent is, however, at best, second-hand and nearly ten years old.\nThe mysterious case of Abbe Vachere is discussed by Dr.\nSchroder in a review of the German publications connected with\npsychical research, a propos of Dr. Henri Birven's book dealing\nwith the Abbe. This case must be admitted to be most curious.\nZeitschrift fur ParapsycJwlogie, July 1929.\nGeneral Peter prints a detailed summary of Signer Bozzano's\nnew paper on the Millesimo \" direct voices \" and other phenomena\nin Luce e Otnbra. I may be permitted to point out, with all\nrespect to the distinguished owner of the castle and his friends,\nthat these \" manifestations \" have every appearance of being but\nanother instance of misdirected human ingenuity (an ingenuity of\na very elementary kind).\nHerr Schuppe, of Berlin, has a paper on Herr Melzer's (of\nDresden) \" convincing spontaneous phenomena \"'\n(apports of flowers\nand stones). Alas, they seem to me, on the contrary, altogether\ninconclusive. The same category of supposed phenomena is the\nsubject of another paper by a Herr Selt, who propounds to explain\nthem a theory which will be entitled to every consideration when\nwe have at our disposal one well attested case.\nDr. Ludwig, of Freising, narrates a case of \/SpMA-phenomena\noccurring in Austria in 1900-1901 and described to him by a\n\f15 2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1929\nRoman Catholic priest in 1927. From the S.P.R. standpoint this\ncase is therefore unsatisfactory evidentially speaking, which on\naccount of some of its features is to be regretted.\nDr. V. A. Reko, of Mexico, contributes a short paper on Peyotl\n(which he apparently prefers to write \" Peyote \"\")\n; Dr. Gustav\nZeller discusses the dangers of anthroposophy (a propos of the\nrecent murder of Dr. Carl Unger in Nuremburg) and Dr. Bohm of\nNiiremburg attempts to prove that \" parapsychical j)lienomena\n\"\nhave their origin in a normal faculty, though chiefly remaining\nlatent, j^roper to every living being ; whilst \" paraphysical pheno-\nmena \" represent unusual manifestations of intellectual disharmonies\nand suppressed instincts. The same writer addresses in rather\nsevere terms Herr Neumann, Theresa Neumann's father, whom he\naccuses of preventing by his obstinate refusals scientific investiga-\ntion of his daughter in a clinic. A recent trial for libel d propos\nof Konnersreuth which took place in Munich, both parties (Herr\nvon Lama and Dr. Aigner) being fined by the Court, is briefly\nnarrated. The latter gentleman prints a short article vigorously\ncriticising the ignoring of Theresa Neumann's phenomena by almost\nthe whole of the German medical world.\nHerr Otto Seeling, of Berlin, discusses a recent ordinance of the\nPrussian Home Secretary forbidding the police authorities to avail\nthemselves \u2014 at least directly \u2014of the services of professional\n\" criminal-clairvoyants.\" Contrary to expectation, Herr Seeling\nseems to be somewhat in sympathy with this ordinance.\nHerr D. Walter, of Graz, has a short paper on Prof. Zollner,\nwhom he knew personally, and asserts that this scientist was not\nof unsound mind when he died ; and personal apparently super-\nnormal exj^eriences, some of them interesting, are related by Frau\nS. Riedl of Freising and the Baroness M. Veszi-Mantica of Florence.\nFranek Kluski's mediumship is spoken of in very high terms by\nHerr Geldnerth vdien reviewing Colonel Okolowicz's book about the\nPolish medium. P.-P.-S.\nProceedings of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, vol. i.,\npart ii., April 1929.\nThis Part consists entirely of a short-title catalogue of Mr.\nPrice's library of works on conjuring and kindred subjects. Among\nthese works are many that bear directly and indirectly on psy-\nchical research, and this catalogue therefore deserves a warm\n\fOctober, 1929 Notes on Periodicals 153\nwelcome, as does any publication that helps to systematise the\nstill inchoate fields traversed by psychical research. Eeaders should\nnote, however, that this is a short-title catalogue, and they should\nnot look in it for the full and careful description of each item\nprovided in the S.P.R.'s catalogues. From the bibliographical and\npractical points of view, indeed, the present catalogue leaves much\nto be desired. The information given is frequently insufficient for\nidentification ; it is impossible to distinguish articles and pamphlets\nfrom books ; and the dating of the earlier works is decidedly\noptimistic. Numerous title-pages and illustrations are reproduced.\nThe British Journal of Psychical Research, May-June 1929.\nThe Rev. C. Drayton Thomas inquires into the nature of an\nemanation said to be positively correlated to the process of trance\ncommunication. Miss Crookes publishes two supernormal experi-\nences of an Irish lady apparently resident in New Zealand, one a\ntelepathic dream and the other a phantasm of the living ; each\nincident is to some extent corroborated. Mr. Neil Gow reflects on\nthe control of physical mediums at test-seances. He complains\nthat investigators still attribute the physical phenomena they wit-\nness to fraud even after having obtained all required control of\nthe medium. To meet this situation he proposes that investigators\nshould, under such circumstances, be obliged to sign a declaration\nconcluding, \" We declare we were unable to detect any kind of\nfraud, trickery or subterfuge.\" But Mr. Gow does not seem to\nperceive that such a declaration would not in the least meet his\ncase, which is that fraud is sometimes alleged in cases where it\nadmittedly remains mh detected.\nQuarterly Transactions of the British College of Psychic Science, Ltd.,\nJuly 1929.\nThe chief article in this number is contributed by Mrs. McKenzie\non Mr. T. Lynn, an apport medium. The article is illustrated with\nphotographs which show that the apports are always connected by\nmeans of wires or rods (normal or supernormal) with the medium's\nbody. Mrs. Helen C. Lambert publishes \" A Case of Psychic\nHealing \" of hay-fever. Mr. De Brath writes on the problem of\nsurvival in relation to Myers and to recent developments.\nPsychic Research, June 1929.\nDr. Crandon publishes, with comments, the record of his sitting\nin December 1928 with Mrs. Leonard. He states that cross-\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October, 1920\ncorrespondences were obtained between Mrs. Leonard and Margery.\nEven giving the term \" cross-correspondence \" the very wide mean-\ning unfortunately becoming general in America, there is no evidence\nfor this in the report of Dr. Crandon's sitting. Indeed, the only\nsupernormal matter obtained consists of a few slight and doubtful\ninstances of thought-transference from the sitter to the medium.\nDr. Crandon's much more substantial claims are based on the\nmistaken assumption that Mrs. Leonard has no normal knowledge\nof events in Dr. and Mrs. Crandon's house. Dr. Burns continues\nhis studies in apparent obsession. Mr. Bird reprints Mr. Dingwall's\nrecent article on \"The Crisis in Psychical Research\" (cp. Journal,\nXXV. 136), to which he adds some very sensible comments of his\nown. But Mr. Bird is surely a little too positive when he declares\nthat it is \" Fairly obvious to any clear-sighted student that this\npronouncement [that there is no genuine physical mediumship] is an\nerroneous one \"\n(p. 324). M. Sudre describes Victor Hugo's dab-\nbling in spiritualism during his exile in Jersey.\nPsychic Research, July 1929.\nMr. Bird begins what promises to be a somewhat superfluously\nlengthy survey of the current status of the Schneider mediumship.\nHe seems to be cautiously working round to the conclusion that\nthe Schneiders are fraudulent. About half of the present instal-\nment consists of a partial reprint of Mr. Vinton's article in Psyche,\nof which Mr. Bird, on the whole, approves. But was it really\nnecessary to enter in such detail into the question of Mr. Vinton's\npersonal morality ? Mr. Burns publishes further studies in ap-\nparent obsession. M. Sudre comments favourably on Mr. Salter's\nand Mr. F.'s treatment of the Margaret Veley case. Mr. David\nGow contributes a tolerant and moderate defence of spiritualism.\nTh.

Mrs Leaning refers more than once to the\nhypnagogic visions of the late Lady Berkeley (cp. xxxv. 321, 333, 339,\n346-7, 361 [\"a correspondent\"]). The special interest of these\nvisions lies in the fact that Lady Berkeley put them on record, in\nwater-coloiurs, as soon as possible after the vanishing of the figures,\nand Mrs Leaning thinks that the resulting collection of sketches is\nimique. A selection of these paintings has now been presented to\nthe Society by Sir Ernest Berkeley and Mr Claude Berkeley, through\nthe intermediary of Mrs Leaning. The Society is greatly indebted\nto the donors for a valuable contribution to the study of hypnagogic\nphenomena.\nCASE.\nL. 1291. A Case of Telepathy.\nMrs Sidgwick writes :\nMy nieces Miss Mary and Miss Eve Balfour have a farm at\nHaughley near Stowmarket in Suffolk. Mary is at present travelling\nin the United States of America and on May 10, 1929, as shown by\nthe postmarks, she sent picture post cards to the foreman on the\nfarm, Mr Aldous, and the members of his large yoimg family. In a\nletter (undated) she wrote from Philadelphia to Mrs Wakefield, the\nold nurse of my nieces who lives with them, as follows :\n\" Here's another message for Eve. I was reminded of it by your\nsaying my p.c.s [post cards] had arrived. Rather a funny thing\nhappened about them. There may be nothing in it, but just for\ncuriosity's sake I wish Eve would try to find out if Bert Aldous\never received his. I went to a big circus one night here (I'll look up\nthe date in my diary and write it at the end of this letter) the kind\nof circus that comes to Stow only ten times larger. As we were\nleaving\u2014I was with a few [Philadelphia] friends\u2014about 2 a.m. and\nthe crowd so thick we could only exit out of the Marquee at a snail's\npace, I heard some one say behind me, '\nPerhaps it got lost in the\npost, because she sent a post card to all the others '\n\u2014well the voice\n\f158 Journal of Society Jar Psychical Research November 1929\nwas so like that of Mrs Aldous that I turned round quite startled.\nI couldn't see who had spoken, but I did see a boy that was such an\nexact copy of Bert that I nearly greeted him. This boy was saying,\n'\nI think she might have sent one to me.' Naturally enough I\nthought of my p.c.s and natvu'ally enough I wondered if they had\nall arrived, for I certainly left no one out. [Reasons here given for\nbeing sure of this.] Bert's p.c. if I remember right was an old house\non the [illegible name] Creek. Just for fun try and find out if\nevery one got a p.c. and if not make it known I sent to everybody.\nI see the elate of the circus was May 24th\u20142 a.m. here, would be\nabout breakfast time the next morning at home. I can't remember\nwhen I sent the p.c.s, so don't know if this was about the time of\narrival or not. ...\"\nEve Balfour made the enquiry suggested, and wrote on June 22>\n1929 :\n\" The telepathy case really interesting. Before telling Aldous\nabout it, I asked if any of them had not got a p.c, and he said\nBert hadn't. I asked him if they had talked aboiit it, and he said\nyes they had discussed it at breakfast, and wondered if, as there\nwere so many, she had forgotten him. ...\"\nAn effort was afterwards made to get at the date of the receipt of\nthe post cards from the post marks, but failed because they were\nnot post-marked at this end of their journey. Later Eve Balfour\ndiscussed the probable date of receipt with Aldous and writes\nSeptember 12, 1929 :\n\" As far as I can make out, the Aldous family received Mary's\npost cards on the morning of May 24th.\n\" The data [are] as follows. Aldous is almost sure that they\ncame on a Friday, he also remembers saying at the time that the\ncards had been a long time coming. The cards are post-marked\nMay 10th. This is also a Friday so I conclude that it was exactly\na fortnight later that they were received. I can't remember Mary's\ndates now. I wonder how this fits in.\"\nIt appears therefore that there is no clear evidence for coincidence\nin time between the disappointment of Bert Aldous and Mary\nBalfour's experience. If Aldous's recollection that the cards arrived\non Friday morning. May 24th, is correct, their receipt must have\npreceded Mary's experience by about 24 hours. If, however, they\nwere received on Saturday morning the 25th, the coincidence\nbetween the two events would have been almost exact. It is, of\ncourse, possible that, though the cards arrived on Friday, it was\nonly when the post came in on Satmxlay morning that Bert Aldous\ngave up hope that a card was coming for him.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\fNovember 1929 Non- Veridical Cross-Correspondences 159\nNON-VEEIDICAL CROSS-CORRESPONDENCES.\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh.\nA NOTICE appeared iu the Journal for March 1929 (xxv. 49) asking\nif any reader could throw light on a non-veridical correspondence\nwhich had occurred between a sitting with Mrs Warren Elliott in\nLondon and two sittings with Mrs Dowdall at Cardiff.\nThe Elliott sitting was of the Absent Sitter kind, that is, the\nnote-taker alone was present, the sitter being represented by a relic.\nThe communications which came through were tmrecognisable by\nthe contributor of the relic, and it was only after some months that\nthere was found that a considerable number of the statements were\nveridical for another contributor, Miss X.\nIn the meantime Miss X. had had two ordinary \" sitter present\n\"\nsittings with Mrs Dowdall at Cardiif, at each of which her com-\nmunicator had purported to communicate. It is not completely\ncertain that Miss X. had not seen the record of the Elliott sitting\nbefore going to Cardiff, but there is little doubt that she had not.\nAssuming this to be the case the important fact is that no one\nhad recognised the Elliott sittings as being relevant to Miss X.\nuntil after the Cardiff sittings had taken place. The veridical\nmatter in all sittings might have been derived from the mind of\nMiss X., but the correspondences now in question are non-veridical\nand consequently could hardly have been in her mind. The chance\nthat two independent mediums should both make the same four\nerroneous statements in connection with the same person is extremely\nsmall. The statements were as follows :\nMrs Warren Elliott: 17 June Mrs Dowdall : 16 November 1927.\n1927. \" I get the name Gerald, some-\n\" Him speaks of somebody, Ger- one calling Gerald quite strongly\naldine, done'd well. Perhaps and I can hear music with him.\nhim means done well with music, I think he was either very fond\ncos Topsy me heard him say of music or had something to do\nmusic then, only just music with music on the battlefield.\"\nalone. Music student, student,\nperhaps its Geraldine was music\nstudent ; doesn't know what\nhim means, get music student.\n17 November 1927.\n\" Me thinks that gentleman very \" Was he very interested in the\ninterested in stars and things, stars ? (Sitter : No.) He seems\nieeps on pointing to stars and to be interested in them now.\nthings.\nHim was bookworm, book- Could your father speak lan-\n-worm. Him used to read in guages ? (Sitter : No.) What\n\fKiO Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1929\nfunny language, funny writing, are these funny letters then ? I\nLooks like no letters at all.\" see him writing like little crooks,\nfunny letters, twists and turns.\nAlmost like shorthand but it\nisn't that.\"\nIn the Warren Elliott sitting and in the earlier Dowdall sitting\nthere are references to India and in all three sittings commimica-\ntions purport to come from Miss X.'s father.\nI estimate as minimum probabilities that one in five persons know\nfairly intimately some one called Gerald or Geraldine, that one\nperson in three may be said to be interested in music or to be a\nstudent of music, that one in five may be said to be interested in the\nstars and that one in fifty persons read or write the funny writing\nas described. This last estimate, if shorthand is excluded, as is\nimplied in the Dowdall sitting, is almost certainly very considerably\nunderstated. The references to India seem to suggest that Hindu-\nstani or some other Eastern script is referred to ; the description\nwould fit Arabic and Turkish but not Chinese, where the characters\nare more angular, nor German cursive script, Greek or Russian, as\nthese employ more ordinary looking letters. The communicator is\nobviously not a native of the East, and the number of persons\nother than those of Eastern race who read or write in such languages\nis relatively small, being confined mainly to Anglo-Indians in this\ncountry. Certainly not one in fifty of the population of England\ncould do so. The combined probability is therefore\n1\/5x 1\/3x 1\/5x 1\/50 = 1\/3750.\nI assume that the notice in the Journal has been read by 500\npeople ; there should be therefore one chance in 7| that one of the\nreaders would find complete correspondence. Actually there have\nbeen three replies to the notice, none of which, however, shows\ncomplete correspondence. They are as follows : I. Miss N. :\n(1) Knows a Geraldine ; (2) who is a teacher of music ; (3) a friend\nof Miss M. is interested in the stars ; (4) and had to do with code\nwriting. II. Mr. H. W. :\n(1) Knows a Gerald ; (2) who was not\nparticularly interested in music ; (3) Mr H. W. is interested in the\nstars ; (4) and has had to do with cypher writing. III. Mr C. W. :\n(1 ) Has a daughter Geraldine aged 5| years ; (2) She sings by ear ;\n(3) Mr C. W. is interested in the stars ; (4) and uses shorthand.\nNumber I : the first items may be considered as correct ; as\nregards the last, this cannot be considered as a coincidence as the\nwriting used in the code was ordinary letters. Number II : (1) and\n(3) are correct, (2) incorrect, (4) is a partial success ; in a few of the\ncyphers arbitrary symbols were used, but there is no evidence to\nshow that these signs are correctly described as \" little crooks.\n\fNovEMBEE 1929 Non- Veridical Cross-Gorrespondences 161\ntwists and turns.\" I estimate this as a one-fourth success. Number\nIII : the Geraldine mentioned in the sitting is clearly older than\n5|- years, but I count this as a partial success owing to the name\nbeing correct, say one-half success. The singing by ear can hardly\nbe considered as a corresjDondence with \" interested in music \" or\n\" student of music.\" Shorthand is expressly excluded in the\nDowdall sitting, but I count this as a partial success, say one-fourth.\nI evaluate these as follows. Number I: 5x3x5=75 out of\n3750 ; number II : 5 x 5 x 121 = 312 out of 3750 ; number III :\n2| X 5f X 12| = 156 out of 3750. We have therefore three partial\nsuccesses, one of one-twelfth, one of one twenty-fourth, and one of\none-fiftieth. This is roughly what might have been expected from\npure chance. We are left therefore, with the original problem still\nunsolved.\nIf we accept as a fact, though it is not completely certain, that\nMiss X. had not seen the record of the Elliott sitting before going to\nCardiff, any explanation based on the hypothesis that Mrs Dowdall\nderived the information from her mind seems to be excluded, though\nI suppose that one might cover the facts by telepathy by stretching\ncoincidence to its limit. Suppose, for instance, that the notetaker\nat the Elliott sitting or someone who read the record, subconsciously\nand telepathically transmitted the facts to Miss X., who subcon-\nsciously recognised their relevance to her father and preserved a\nsubconscious memory of the whole, from which Mrs Dowdall drew\nher information. There is, however, nothing to show that anything\nin the record struck anyone as being relevant to Miss X. or her\ncommunicator until she herself noticed it ; in fact, the nature of\nthe relevant statements is such that a very detailed knowledge of her\nfamily affairs, such as Miss X. alone would possess, would have been\nnecessary for the relevance to be observed. We must suppose then\nthat the telepathic transmission to Miss X. was due to pure\nchance.\nAlternatively we might suppose that Miss X. clairvoyantly read\nthe record of the Elliott sitting and noticed the relevance to her\nfather before going to Cardiff. Why her clairvoyant faculty, if she\npossess one, for which there is no evidence, should be turned in this\nparticular direction is not clear, unless we postulate some external\nagent who was cognisant of the facts. The most suitable agent\nwould seem to be her deceased father.\nThere appears to be no other possible connecting link. If, how-\never, we postulate the agency of her deceased father to direct her\nassumed clairvoyance, we might better adopt the more simple\nhypothesis of spirit-communication which requires only the same\npostulate. Once we admit the possibility of communication with\nthe surviving spirit of her deceased father, we have the required\n\f162 Joti^rnal of Society for Psychical Research November 1929\nlink between tlie two sittings, though it is not apparent why these\nirrelevant details should have been given on both occasions. We\nmight perhaps suggest that they were relevant to the communicator\nthough unknown to his daughter, though this seems rather unlikely.\nAlternatively we might suppose that they referred to some other\npersonality who accompanied Miss X.'s father at both sittings.\nThis, however, seems rather far-fetched and there does not, from\nour point of view, appear to be any reasonable cause for the intrusion\nof this irrelevant matter. Still, we are so completely ignorant of the\nconditions which prevail \" on the other side,\" if another side exists\nat all, that it is idle to speculate. In all probability our point of\nview is not applicable at all. Telepathic commmiication between\nthe two mediums seems to be so unlikely as to be barred out. Mrs\nElliott had no apparent knowledge that her sitting referred to\nMiss X., nor that the sitting with Mrs Dowdall was taking place.\nThe position appears to be that none of the suggested hypotheses\ncovers the facts satisfactorily and we are, therefore, compelled to\nadopt the attitude of suspension of judgment and to relegate the\ncase to the class of inexplicable phenomena, at least for the present.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Spiritualistic Hypothesis.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Mr Soal in his reply to Miss Dallas has again raised the issue\nthat the spiritualistic hypothesis is a hindrance to advance in\npsychical research. May I remind him and other readers that this\ncontention has been fully answered by Dr Schiller in Proceedings\n(1901-3), xvii. 248-251 ?\nDr Schiller maintains that to attribute extraordinary retentive-\nness and creativeness to the subconsciousness is to formulate an\nhypothesis which is no more reasonable and no more evidentially\nestablished than the spiritualistic hypothesis. He maintains that\nfrom the point of view of the orthodox psychologist there is nothing\nto choose between the two theories.\nDr Schiller further suggests that the spiritualistic hypothesis has\nmethodological advantages over the subconscious self theory. He\npoints out that the adoption of the former hypothesis avoids the\nalienation of the medium, and that it is further \" more stimulating\nand encouraging, and therefore more likely to bring out the full\npowers of the medium.\" Dr Schiller also refers to the fact that\ncommunications take the spiritualistic form even in cases where the\nmedium rejects this interpretation, and he instances some experi-\n\fNovember 1929 Corresponchnce 163\nments of his brother. And, I might add, Mr Soal's own automatic\nverse ^ is a strilving illustration of this tendency.\nYours etc.,\nIsabel Kingsley.\nThe Conditions of Control at Sittings for Physical\nPhenomena.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014j\\Ir Price's interesting account [see below, p. 170] of his\nsittings with Rudi Schneider in London in April 1929 raises the\nquestion : Are all the persons present at the sitting to be controlled\nor the medium alone ? I answer emphatically : The medium alone.\nThe sitters must be selected with the greatest care. But once so\nselected they must be presumed honest. Of course mistakes are\npossible : I know it well, I who have passed through the \" Cham-\nberlain X.\" experience. 2 But such xmfortimate incidents are\ninseparable from human activity in general. I will compare them\nto railway, motor-car and aviation accidents, which happen every\nday, but which in a sense are regarded as non-existent (time-tables,\netc.).\nThose taking part in spiritualistic sittings of a more or less serious\nnature, must be considered in the same way. Once they are admitted,\ntheir hona-fides is to be regarded as beyond doubt. Should this\nassumption prove false, we have before us but another variety of\nthe \" railway accident \" species. Of course sitters who act as the\nmedium's \" next friend,\" who follow the medium as his or her\nshadow, are to be treated differently ;\nbeing the medium's alter ego\nthey must be subjected to practically the same kind of control.\nI very much hope the electrical control will definitely prove to be\nconclusive and satisfactory. But it is at least superfluous to apply\nit to people necessarily supposed to be honest (otherwise they 7nust\nnot take part in the sitting). Of course electrical control, if applied\nto six, eight or ten people at once instead of to one individual only,\nis likely at first glance to savour more of scientific methods, but this\nis a delusion, not to say a trompe-Vceil. At a certain sitting with the\nlate Guzik held in Paris five or six years ago, some thirty people,\nsome of them of much scientific eminence, were, I believe, tied to\n1 []VIr Soal now allows it to be known that he is the Mr Y. of the Oscar\nWilde and Margaret Veley cases. Ed.]\n2 [This is the case of an educated and cultured official in the Russian Foreign\nOffice, who systematically, and apparently in complicity with a series of\nmediums, simulated supposedly supernormal ph_ysical phenomena. This case\nhas been several times described by Count Pe'rovsky, most recently in his\n^'Xamenlose Betriiger ? Zeitschrift fiir kritischen \"Okkultismus (Stuttgart\nJ 927), ii. 249-258.

How about the mouth ? How about possible apports ? A\nspecial group of \" super-sitters,\" if I may so call them, would have\nto be created and entrusted with the watching and searching of\nthose present ; but here I will ask : Quis custodial custodes ? The\ninvestigation of physical phenomena is sufficiently difficult already\nnot to complicate it further. Let the medium be very closely\nwatched ; let every kind of reasonable method be used to prevent\ncheating ; let everything be done to induce the phenomena to occur\nunder conditions enabling exact observation ; let us be extremely\ncareful in the choice of those who are to attend the sitting, but\naway with all pseudo-scientific paraphernalia which merely tend to\nobscure the main issue.\nYours, etc.,\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nREVIEWS.\nThe Encyclopaedia Britannica. Fourteenth edition.\nPsychical research must reckon itself lucky not to have been\n\" modernised \" and \" humanised \" altogether out of existence in\nthe new Britannica, which has suffered many a sad sea-change in\nits passage across the Atlantic. Not the least of these is the intro-\nduction of misprints (practically non-existent in the old Britannica).\nMr Salter's article (see below), for instance, contains at least half-a-\ndozen.\nA comparison of the present edition with the eleventh, the last\ncomplete one, shows that the general tendency has been to cut\ndown substantially the total space given to the subject, and to\nfollow a policy of centralisation. The main article under \" Psychical\nResearch \" now covers the whole subject is as much detail as can\nbe expected in the space, and the minor headings have accordingly\nbeen drastically reduced.\nThus (to mention only the articles bearing most directly on\npsychical research), while Andrew Lang's articles on \" Apparitions\n\"\nand \" Second Sight,\" and Professor McDougall's on \" Trance \" are\nsubstantially retained, though the two former now have a rather\narchaic flavour, like so many of Lang's writings on psychical\nresearch, Podmore on \" Premonitions \" and the anonymous \" Fire-\nwalking \" have been reduced to a few lines. Lang's articles on\n\" Crystal-Gazing \" and \" Hauntings \" ; N. W. Thomas's on \" Clair-\n\fNOVESTBEK 1929 Reviews 165\nvoyance,\" \" Death-Warnings, \" Medium \" and \" Telepathy \" ; and\nthe anonymous \" D. D. Home,\" are all cut down to bare dictionary\nentries. These entries, however, are all notable for their accuracy\n(except for a small slij) in that on \" Crystal-Gazing \"). Podmore on\n\" Table-Turning \" and Lang on \" Poltergeist \" are dropped alto-\ngether. Under \" Spiritualism \" many who have read with admira-\ntion Mrs Sidgwick\"s masterly essay in the old Britannica will regret\nits disappearance from the new edition. The article which takes its\nplace, however, by Sir Oliver Lodge, is a fair and lucid statement of\nthe subject from the point of view of one thoroughly convinced of\nsurvival.\nAs has been said, the main article on \" Psychical Research\n\"\ncompensates for what has been lost elsewhere. This article, by Mr\nSalter (which replaces that by Lang in the eleventh edition and that\nby Dr Schiller in the so-called twelfth), is a really admirable attempt\nto cover the whole ground in a critical and judicious spirit. It\nforms by far the best available survey in short compass of practically\nthe entire field of psychical research.\nK. Kephren. La Transmission de Pensee. 8vo. pp. 140. Paris :\nFelix Alcan, 1929. Price 12 fr.\nThis book consists largely of theoretical discussions of thought-\ntransference and kindred subjects. These are based on a few\nexperiments in mental suggestion and thought-transference in\nhypnosis conducted by Mile Kephren (pseudonym) in 1917. These\nexperiments were a good deal more successful than any authentic\nones yet recorded. It is the more regrettable therefore that par-\nticulars regarding the subjects and similar details, together with\ncorroborative information, are altogether lacking, and that Mile\nKephren allowed so many years to pass before reporting these results.\nThe experiments should, if possible, be repeated under test con-\nditions.\n'\nTh.

The first is by Maitre M.\nGargon on \" Black Magic of To-day.\" I much appreciate his\nwritings in general, but this lecture has been a disappointment.\nMaitre Gargon carefidly abstains from telling us whether he believes\nhimself in black magic ; he shows us that la magie noire still exists,\nbut no more ; at the most critical point of an invocation to Lucifer\nhe goes away (p. 269).\nM. R. Warcollier discusses \" Telepathy, its relations with the\nSubconscious and the L^nconscious.\" He distinguishes in the human\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1029\nmind four strata : tlie unconscious, the conscious, the subconscious\nand the superconscious. Another writer, Dr Vinchon, informs us\n\u2022on another page that there are two inconscients : the individual\nunconscious and the collective unconscious. Whether by thus\nmultiplying various x's we are likely to come nearer to the clue to\nthe problem_s of psychical research, I am somewhat doubtful. It is\nslightly disconcerting to find M. Warcollier almost \" despairing \" to\nbe able to transfer telepathically conscious thoughts (p. 285),\napparently quite forgetful of all the work of the S. P. R. in thought-\ntransference. I must again state my opinion as to the evidential\nvalue of such experiments as M. Warcollier's : we must, before we\ncan judge them, have all the trials before us (which is not the case).\nA French translation follows of Mr Price's report of his sittings\nwith Rudi Schneider in London in April 1919. M. Henri Desoille\nhas a very long paper on the possible influence of \" occult sciences\n\"\non mental derangement. His conclusions are emphatically in the\naffirmative (p. 371). They seem to me well grounded. The other\npapers :\n\" Hypnosis, with reference to Pavloff's experiments \" by\nDr Thooris, \" The False Dauphins and their Prophets \" by Dr\nVinchon, and M. Sainte-Lague's note on \" Einstein's Theories of\nSpecial Relativity\", have very little connection with our researches.\nBulletin du Conseil de Recherches Melajmjchiqms de Belgique, October\n1929.\nM. Rutot discusses at length \" Psychism and Metapsychism.\"\nTwo proces verbaux by a Mr A. L. Dribbel are printed of sittmgs for\nphysical phenomena at Carshalton with Mr G. P. L'Estrange as\nmedium. Then we have the Mantes sittings again. We are told\nthat, as was to be expected, these take place regularly again (not-\nwithstanding the exposure of last year). Abstracts of two proces-\nverbaux are given. I confess that to my mind they merely illustrate\nonce more the complete evidential worthlessness of most such\naccounts in general and the all -important part played here by the\npersonality of the observer. Finally a note on some Nice sittmgs is\nprinted.\nZeitschriftfiir Parapsychologie, August 1929.\nThis number opens with the first instalment of a translation of\nMr Price's account of sittings with Rudi Schneider in London in\nApril last. General Peter reverts to the \" White Lady \" of Schloss\nBernstein in Burgenland and seems to have no doubt of the genuine-\nness of the case. It should be noted, however, that m a recent\nnumber of the Vienna Reichspost (a Roman Catholic daily paper) an\narticle was printed categorically stating that the alleged apparitions\nwere due to a deliberate hoax. Frau Hessel (a professional clair-\nmyante) of Leipzig, is the subject of another paper by Herr Otto\n\fN0VK5IBBE 1929 Notes on Periodicals 167\nSeeling in which the pros and cons are stated with apparent impar-\ntiality. Dr Heyde of Rostock discusses telepathy and arrives at\nthe conclusion that the immaterial character of consciousness is not\nenough : we must postulate consciousness to have no relation to\nspace (Undrtlichkeit)\n.\nHerr R. Lambert has a long and very sensible paper on the\nMillesimo sittings in Italy, which he conclusively shows to be most\nsusjDicious, as was indeed obvious from the beginning. The most\ninstructive feature of these sittings seems to me to be the light the\naccounts throw on Signer Bozzano's \" critical \" methods and\ncanons of evidence. The Baroness Veszi-Mantica of Florence\nrelates various cases which were commimicated to her by corres-\npondents. The most curious comes from a Dr. R. R, of Vienna,\nwhose niece, five years and a half old, is alleged to be endowed with\nstriking supernormal faculties. The case, if authentic, certainly\ndeserves investigation. An incident related by a Jewish Rabbi\n(automatic writing) may also deserve attention but cannot be\nadequately appreciated, since the Baroness does not give us the\noriginal report.\nZeitsclirift fiir Parapsyclwlogie, September 1929.\nThe concluding part is printed of the translation of Mr Price's\naccount of the Rudi Schneider sittings in London. The German\n\" White Lady \" and kindred matters are the subject of two papers,\none sceptical by Dr Hermann Kiigler of Berlin, the other affirmative\nby Herr Johannes Illig. The latter would have done well, I think,\nif he had attempted to refute the above-mentioned article in the\nVienna ReicJispost. Zollner and the theory of the fourth dimension\nare discussed by Dr Bernoulli of Zurich. The writer affirms, no\ndoubt correctly, that the Leipzig savant had arrived at the con-\nclusion that a fourth dimension of space may exist (following in the\nsteps of Riemann, Mach and, I may add. Gauss and Lobatchevsky)\nbefore the Slade sittings, not after. He is hardly right, however, in\nsaying that Zollner had the satisfaction of seeing almost all the\nexperiments organised by him succeed at these sittings. As a matter\nof fact he had to content himself chiefly, though not invariably,\nwith ersfflte-phenomena, impressive but less convincing than those\ncontemplated.\nFrl. Walther briefly relates the story of Joanna Southcott's box,\nand Herr Arthur Kronfeld of Berlin has a paper on \" Established\nfacts in Parapsychology.\" Telepathy comes for him first (with\nspecial reference to such experiments as Herr Carl Bruck's and\nProfessor Gilbert Murray's) ; then psychometry and clairvoyance.\nExperiments in \" cryptoscopy \" such as Dr Chowrin's, Herr v.\nWasielewski's, etc., seem to him somewhat less satisfactory. Psycho-\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Kovember1929\nmetry is followed by clairvoyance, the physical phenomena coming\nin the last place. The alleged post-mortem message of Houdini to\nhis wife is the siibject of a note by Frl. Walther and of a few words\nby Herr R. Lambert (hpro])os of a pamphlet on The Houdini Messages.\nOur readers will note the part played in the case by the Rev. Arthur\nFord (cp. Journal, November 1928, xxiv. 357). A very interesting\nstatement is made by Dr Jos. Bohm. The Neumann family, it\nwould appear, have consented to Theresa's alleged ability to fast for\nprolonged periods being scientifically investigated (presumably in a\nclinic).\nZeitschrift filr ParapsycJiologie, October 1929.\nDr Siinner, the Editor, narrates in great detail a case of spon-\ntaneous physical phenomena observed recently by him and by a\nfew friends in Charlottenburg. The supposed medium was Lucie\nRegulski, a girl eleven years old. The manifestations consisted of\nraps and noises, attempts at direct 'WTiting on a slate and different\nmovements of objects, and were supposed to be produced by a\ndeceased uncle. The child lay in bed (which was repeatedly moved)\nwhilst the jJienomena were going on. Various incidents happening\nto various persons have led Dr Siinner to the conclusion that we\nhave to deal here with a Familienspuk manifesting itself in the same\nfamily through decades : a statement which, I confess, leaves me\nsomewhat sceptical. Dr Siimier also contributes a very personal\n\" review \" of Dr Moll's recent Zur Psychologie unci Charakterologie\nder Okkultisien. Some people will think that such an attitude\nonly strengthens Dr Moll's accusations. Dr Walther Kroner has\nthe first instalment of a paper on a recent exposure in Berlin of\nGeorge Valiantine, the American trumpet-medium. We shall revert\nto it in detail when it is concluded.\nZeitschrift fiir jysychische Forschung, July 1929.\nThis number opens with a paper by Dr E. Mattiesen on the\nanimistic theory of cross-correspondences, which the writer attempts\nto disprove, with special reference to the part supposed by some to\nhave been played by Mrs Verrall in originating this particular type\nof message. Professor Messer of the University of Giessen has the\nfirst instalment of a paper on the phenomena of possession supposed\nto have been exhibited by Herr Melzer of Dresden. Seeing that the\nlatter gentleman also exhibits such doubtful manifestations as\napporfs, it goes without saying that such incidents as depend on this\nmedium's good faith have no evidential value, so long, at least, as\nthe authenticity of apiports has not been established. Logically\nspeaking, such a canon of evidence seems to me unassailable.\nDr Schroder has a further article on metaplasmic phenomena sup-\n\fNOVEMBEK 1929 Notes on Periodicals 169\nposed to have occurred with, lime d'Esperance, Jliss Goligher and\nMarthe Beraiid (Eva C). As mention is made of the Helsingfors\nsitting in 1893 where j\\Ime d'Esperance's legs are supposed to have\ndematerialised, I may add that M. Aksakov, who subsequently\ninvestigated the incident himself, admitted in print, though inclined\nto think the phenomenon authentic, that it could not be regarded as\ncompletely proved.\nOn another page Dr Schroder mentions various incidents occurr-\ning in Germany of late, in particular trials of various healers. One\nof these ended with the healer (Frau Erna Konig) being fined 1000\nMarks. A very perplexing problem is presented to us by these\npeople, for on the one hand it seems to me preposterous to prevent\nthem, if really endowed with peculiar powers, from curing those\nwhom official medicine cannot help ; on the other quacks cannot be\npermitted to prey on credulous and defenceless people.\nZagadnienia Metapsychiczne, 1929, no. 21-22.\nM. Kazimierz Wyczalkowski, believing metapsychics to be a\nscience more precise and certain in its conclusions than many\nsciences officially recognised (!), insists on the necessity of founding\nin Poland an International Metapsychical Institute. In my humble\nopinion soi-disant psychical research societies of every description are\nalready numerous enough in Poland. May I be permitted to add\nthat we want not so much quantity as quality ? It is intended to\nconvoke a Polish Metapsychical Congress and exhibition in the\nautumn. Dr F. R. Habdank (pseudon}Tn of Dr X.

Dr\nBurns continues his studies in apparent obsession. Dr Crandon\nprints a further reply under the title \" Psychical Eesearch.

For these sittings Schrenck-Notzing's\nelectrical aj^paratus (see Proceedings, xxxviii. diagram facing p. 434)\nwas adapted. As to the methodological defects of this system, I am\nin agreement with Count Perovsky's letter printed on another page\nin this issue. And, from a practical point of view, it is impossible to\ncriticise it, since Mr Price prints only the original German diagram\nby Amareller of Schrenck's wiring, although his own system differs\nvery considerably from this. For instance, Schrenck's system pro-\nvided for the control of the medium only ; Mr Price's wiring is\narranged for the control, in addition, of up to thirteen sitters.\nFurther, the diagram printed by Mr Price (p. 467) of the seance-TOom.\nis not only internally anomalous in its measurements, but does not\nagree in this respect with the text in several vital points.

Hill,'^ in which a person who con-\nducted a public religious service of a Spiritualist Society, in the\ncom'se of which he undertook to act as message-bearer from deceased\n1 66 N.Y. Law Journal 79 (7 October 1921).\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1929\nrelatives to persons present, the alleged messages containing some\nrather trivial predictions, was convicted and imprisoned. This case,\nwhich apparently cannot be found in the official reports, aroused the\nindignation of Dr Walter Franklin Prince.\n^\nA decision was si;bsequently rendered by a Judge sitting alone in\nthe Supreme Court of New Jersey in State v. Delcmey ^ to the effect\nthat where the prediction is made as a part of the public service of a\nSpiritualist Church, the act of prediction falls within the protection\nof the constitutional guarantee of religious liberty. Where the pre-\ndiction is made at a private sitting for a fee, it is no defence that the\naccused was a spiritualist and acted bona fide.\n^\nThe distinction is recognised by the new statute of the State of\nXew York commonly known as the Jenks Law, named from the\nintroducer of the bill into the Assembly. Section 899 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure included in the list of \" disorderly persons\n\"\n\"3. Persons pretending to tell fortunes, or where lost or stolen\ngoods may be found.\" This section of the Statute has been amended\nby the Act of 6 April 1929,* by adding the words \" but this sub-\ndivision shall not be construed to interfere with the belief, practices\nor usages of an incorporated ecclesiastical governing body or the duly\nlicensed teachers or ministers thereof acting in good faith and without\npersonal fee.\"' ^\nThis law is satisfactory to the members of the Spiritualist Church,\nas it throws a protection to some extent over their \" message-\nbearers \" who purport to communicate with deceased persons, since\nfrom time to time predictions will appear in the supposed messages.\nExcept in this fashion there appears to be no connection between\nfortune-telling and spiritualism. The most interesting cases of\nfortune-telling are like mind-reading.^\nFrom time to time decisions in regard to fortune-telling will be\nfound treated as cases of Disorderly Conduct or Vagrancy, and their\nsteady recurrence would indicate that there is no diminution in the\n1 W.

But even when delivered in good faitli pre-\ndictions are not reliable. The state may properly forbid predictions\nfor hire on this account, and particularly on account of the constant\nfrauds for gain practiced by fortune-tellers. This, however, is not\nthe same thing as forbidding a person to act at all as a \" spirit\nmedium,\" or even to take pay for it. Until we know more about the\nsubject, the law should stop at the punishment of mediums for\nconscious fraud. Persons ought not to be forbidden to act as\n\" mediums \" for compensation merely because predictions occur,\nbut the imdertaking to foretell the future for a fee may very properly\nbe forbidden. The Jenks law is certainly a step in the right direction.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Conditions of Control at Sittings for\nPhysical Phenomena.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Count Perovsky deserves our gratitude for raising in his\nletter in the November Journal (xxv. 163) a very important question\nof method in psychical research. He declares emphatically that\nonly the medium should be controlled and that the sitters should\nbe carefully selected, and then trusted. I would like to put the case\nfor dissenting from this curious canon of investigation.\n(1) The Coimt does not tell us who is to select the sitters. What\nguarantees can be suggested that will ensure a right selection ?\n\u2022Surely the quis custodiet custodes question arises already at this stage.\n(2) It is not only necessary to secure trustworthy sitters, but also\nto give the world reason to believe that they are trustworthy. And\neven if those who know them are able to accept them as trustworthy\nat the time, how about future generations that are expected to accept\ntheir testimony ?\n(3) It seems illogical to trust to the good faith of sitters, while\nguarding oneself against deception by mediums. If mediums may\nproperly be suspected of fraud, why not sitters of confederacy ?\n(i) Actually there is ground enough for suspecting sitters. In the\nfirst place the habitual sitter with any medium represents a product\nof selection. He is one who has persevered, either because he is\nspecially attracted by the type of mediumship, or because he is\nincapable of detecting any fraud in it. In either case he is open to\nsuspicion. Secondly, it is among persons like him that confederates\nin fraud are most likely to be sought. Thirdly, the habitual sitter\nis most likely to relax his vigilance and to abate the precautions\nagainst fraud.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1929\n(5) Uncontrolled sitters may not only shake tLe confidence of the\npublic in the reports of sittings, but also detract from the impressive-\nness of the sittings for the sitters themselves. For a sitter Avho is\nconscious of his own complete rectitude cannot possibly be equally\nconfident about all the other sitters. He must always ask himself\nwhether confederacy is not the explanation of what happens. And\nimcontrolled sitters can do mischief also in other ways.\n(6) The fact that no precautions can stop up every source of error\nand deception absolutely seems a very poor reason for not taking as\nmany precautions as are practicable. I express no opinion on the\nadequacy of Mr Price's \" electrical control,\" as I have not yet tried\nit ; but on the face of it it is an added safeguard, and I entirely fail\nto follow the argument that it should be dispensed with, because\npsychical research is so difficult and complicated already. Of course\npsychical research is difficult and complicated, else it would not\nremain in the inchoate condition it is in : but it will make no pro-\ngress unless all its difiiculties and complications are squarely met.\nAn adequate control of the sitters strikes me as one of the most\nobvious and valuable improvements to introduce into the technique\nof sittings, and I cannot see why what is sauce for the goose should\nnot be sauce also for the gander.\nYours, etc.,\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nThe Spiritualistic Hypothesis.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I cannot think that your correspondent Mrs Kingsley is wise\nin appealing to views expressed by Dr Schiller in an article that is\nalmost thirty years old. After the epoch-making work of Freud and\nJung it is surely a little late in the day to maintain that an orthodox\npsychologist would find nothing to choose between the subconscious\nmind theory and the spirit theory. Few modern psychologists, how-\never orthodox, would dare to dispute the fact that there are mental\nhappenings and purposive streams of mental activity running\nbeneath the surface of oiir ordinary waking consciousness or that\nour conscious states are largely influenced by these hidden activities.\nThe exploration of this subconscious territory is no longer taboo and\nthe techniques of hypnotism and suggestion and of psychoanalysis\nare bringing to light facts of immense value. I only ask that in our\nattempts to understand psychical phenomena before appealing to\nthe agency of departed spirits (for whose very existence we have no\nindependent a j)riori evidence) we should first make use of all the\nresources that psychoanalysis and abnormal psychology place at our\ndisposal.\n\fDecember 1929 Corres-pondence 177\nNothing is more remarkable than the way in which subconscious\nmental phenomena accounnodate themselves not only to the beliefs\nof the immediate entourage of the individual subject bu.t also to the\ngeneral beliefs of the age in which they appear. In ancient Greece\nit was the pagan gods and goddesses or the souls of mythological\nheroes who spoke through the oracles ; in the Middle Ages there\nwere veritable epidemics of hysteria in which large numbers fell into\ntrance and were possessed by angels or devils from the pit ;\nto-day\nit is plain Mr Brown of Bermondsey or Uncle Dick, deceased, of\nDalston, who are allowed to shake the tables. In the classical\natmosphere of the Jersey sittings not only did the abstract virtues\ncommunicate but even the Lion of Androcles came back to spell out\nHugoesque verses in the presence \u2014be it carefully noted\u2014of the\ngreat poet himself. The Chevalier des Mousseaux, who was a\ndemonist, used to speak regularly through the planchette with\ndevils. \" Are you he who tempted our first parents ?\n\" he would\nask. \" Yes \" the devil would reply. Or, \" Are you one of those\nwho entered into the swine ?\n\" \" Yes.\"\nOn the other hand in the rationalistic atmosphere of the early\nFrench magnetisers, before the wave of spiritualism came over from\nAmerica, the hypnotised subjects produced all the basic phenomena\nof spiritualism while seldom claiming to be in touch with invisible\nbeings of any kind. These subjects foretold the future, read the\nthoughts of the hypnotist and described apparitions with veridical\ndetails ; but these apparitions were usually apparitions of the living\nand not of the dead.\nIf occasionally the automatic communications assume a spiritual-\nistic formwith subjects whose views are normally opposed to spiritual-\nism, that is not surprising. Freud and his followers have shown\nthat there still exist in the subconscious mind of the individual\nprimitive streams of mental activity which are often in conflict with\nthe beliefs and lines of conduct imposed by civilisation upon the\nordinary waking self. The belief in spirits is a primitive belief held\nby all savage races and it should not surprise us if the irrational\nstrata of mental life inherited from far-back ancestors should surge\nup and colour the automatic communications.\nI turn now to the supposed methodological advantages of spiritual-\nism as a working hypothesis. When experimenting with subjects\nwhose minds are imbued with spiritualistic ideas I agree that it is\nbest for the experimenter to pretend that the \" spirits \" are what\nthey claim to be. If, for instance, I had laughed at John Ferguson\nand told him that he was only a trance modification of the medium's\nsubliminal he would probably have promptly disappeared. To this\nlimited extent it is unfortunately necessary to adopt spiritualism as\na working hypothesis. I say \" mifortunately \" because the danger\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1929\nof antagonising the medium and lier secondary personalities makes\nit practically impossible to submit her to psychoanalysis.\nHence the enormous advantage in working with a subject whose\nmentality is not obsessed with ideas of communication with the dead.\nBut such a subject is a rara avis and more ordinary minds like that\nof Mdlle Helene Smith ^ usually fall into the hands of uncritical\nspiritualists who exploit their phenomena without producing any\nrecords of scientific value. Mdlle Smith herself seems to have been\nquite happy with Prof. Floiirnoy until the spiritualists poured their\npropaganda into her receptive mind. Then she was lost to science ;\nbut the blame cannot fairly be laid at the door of Prof. Flournoy on\nthe ground that \" he explained away her phenomena too completely\n\"\n(in Dr Schiller's words). As a scientific man Flournoy could not\nhave done otherwise than push his observations to their logical\nconclusion.\nBut even if it be admitted that the so-called \" spirits \" are often\nthe occasion of supernormal mental phenomena it is none the less\ntrue that they are incapable of bringing us any nearer to a scientific\nexplanation of these phenomena. I go to a trance medium and\nobserve, say, a case of prevision in which a certain \" spirit \" claims\nto have the power of describing a future scene in my life. If the\nphenomenon were really the result of a new faculty acquired by a\nhuman being after physical death we might reasonably expect this\ndiscarnate human being to furnish us with some intelligent dis-\ncussion of the matter. If however we interrogate him his explana-\ntions are almost invariably absurd and not even superficially\nplausible. It is true that I could not make a man who was born\nblind realise exactly what sight means, but I could at least furnish\nhim with a very intelligent demonstration of the linaitations and\npossibilities of the faculty in enabling us to deal with distant objects\nin the physical world. In any case I should not talk nonsense to\nthe blind man.\nIt does not seem therefore, that we are helped in the least by the\nsupposed spirit's statement that he is a discarnate human being who\nhas acquired new faculties. Our only resource is to fall back upon\nthe ordinary mundane methods of scientific inquiry. We must try\nto get the phenomenon repeated under our own conditions, we must\nvary these conditions and try to discover by elimination the factors\nwhich are important. And we shall be lucky if the self-styled spirits,\nfar from helping us, do not actually hinder and thwart our experi-\nments. For while the non-spiritualistic subject like Ossowiecki will\ncheerfully do his best to comply with our tests the spirit Controls\n^ [The observations by Dr Scliiller referred to by Mrs Kingsley were made\nduring the course of a review of one of Flournoy's publications on his subject\nHelene Smith. Ed.']\n\fDecember 1929 Correspondence 179\nwill probably reply that it is beneath their dignity to read the sealed\nenvelopes and books that we bring into the seance-TOom, will refuse\nour experiments, while still claiming to produce far more marvellous\nphenomena which are not under our control.\nXo single idea of scientific value has been communicated through\nspirit mediums. On the other hand there have been reams of jargon\nand pseudo-science. Xor does Sir Oliver Lodge's theory that men\nof genius are inspired by the mighty dead appear to me\"^to be any-\nthing more than a gratuitous assumption. For it is as well to\nrernember that the mighty dead were once themselves the mighty\nliving ! The mental difierences between men may be just as much\nthe result_ of their heredities and early environments as are the\nphysical differences between men. Because a blacksmith is stronger\nthan ordinary men we do not suppose that the spirit of some dead\nSamson affects his glands and makes strength flow into his muscles !\nAnd this brings me to the chief point of my previous letter. It is\nthat the spirit hj^othesis is rapidly becoming a pseudo-explanation\nin the hands of many spiritualists. It is indeed so wide, so vague, so\nconvenient, that it can be safely applied to almost anything. I shall\nnot be at all surprised to learn soon that the spirits of the dead assist\nthe bacteria in the work of fermentation and putrefaction ! It does\nnot in the least dismay these ardent enthusiasts if the spirit com-\npletely fails to establish his identity, if he remembers things that\nnever happened to him in life, and forgets the vital facts of his\nterrestrial existence. Xo matter ! If he is not the person he claims\nto be it is at any rate another dead man who impersonates him\u2014\na\nspirit of some sort\u2014and so the spirit hypothesis is saved.\nYours etc.,\nS. G. SOAL.\nThe Indian Rope-Trick.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Within the last few days my attention has been drawn to a\nstatement printed on pp. 30-31 of the Society's Journal for 1905-1906,\nvolume xii. This purports to be an accoimt, by an eye-witness, of\na performance of the Indian Rope-trick in Xovember 1897, between\n2 and 3 p.m., outside Watson's Hotel in Bombay.\nThe statement is anonymous ; that anomnnity must be respected,\nalthough as it happens I have met the narrator, and there is no\nreason whatever to impugn her good faith. But it appears to me\nthat it is undesirable to retain on the Society's records, without\ncomment, a story which as it stands purports to be a narrative of\nfact, when there is cogent evidence for its being the record of a\n\fISO Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decembee 1929\ndream ;\nand I think that this consideration stands good even though\nthe record is some 25 years old.\nThe comment, then, which I have to make is as follows. At the\ntime in question, 1897, Watson's Hotel must have been as well\nknown to visitors to India, and to residents in India, as any place\nin India could be. There must be hundreds of people still alive who\nknew it, and who could bear me out when I say that on the opposite\nside of the roadway (not a wide one) running past it there stood a\nrow of tall trees which formed a canopy above the road, thus pro-\nviding ample shade for the jugglers, conjm'ors, snake-charmers, and\npedlars who plied their trades in the roadway for the amusement of\nthe guests on the first-floor balcony of the hotel. And, as I re-\nmember it, this tree-canopy was some twenty feet above the balcony,\nand forty above the level of the road.\nNow the narrative to which I have referred contains the following\nmaterial words :\n\" One of them [the conjurors] threw a rope into the air which\nhitched itself up to apparently nothing in the sky above ; one could\nsee the rope going straight up as far as one could see anything. . . .\nA small boy then swarmed up this rope, becoming smaller and\nsmaller, till he likewise vanished from sight. . .\n.\"\nIf these words mean anything, it is that the free end of the rope and\nthe climbing boy receded vertically to a distance so great that the\nboy could no longer be distinguished by the naked eye. But, as I\nhave mentioned, the tree-canopy was not more than six or seven\nyards above the heads of observers on the balcony, and the field of\nview overhead ended in the canopy. The words of the narration\ncannot be reconciled with this fact. I have no doubt that the narrator\nwatching the conjurors during the hottest and most soporific time\nof the afternoon, simply dozed off, perhaps for not more than a\nminute ; dreamed the supposed facts ; and waking again to the same\nenvironment, supposed herself to have actually witnessed the events\nset forth in the narrative.\nYours, etc.,\nA.

M. Leymarie, Editor of the\nRevue Spirite and an ardent supporter of Buguet, shared the latter's\nfate.\nTo me the most instructive features of this celebrated trial are :\n(fi) the persistence of some of the Spiritualists who appeared in\nCourt as witnesses for the defence (such as Alan Kardecs widow,\nComte de Bullet and others) in their belief in the genuineness of the\nspirit photographs, in spite of Buguet's admission that these were\nforgeries, an admission supported by the exhibition of material\nproofs (dolls) ; (6) the part played by Leymarie.

After rejecting several,\nin particular the one according to which the objects handled by the\npsychometrist are \" impregnated \" with emanations of some kind,\nthe writer postulates the accumulation of all the facts existing in the\nworld, both in their relation to space and to time, in some central\nsuperconsciousness with which every individual is intimately con-\nnected, he being able under certain circumstances to draw knowledge\nout of his own deeper self.

He assumes the human\norganism to be radio-active and to throw off certain emanations\ncapable of influencing at a distance living beings and even inanimate\nsubjects, both for good and for evil. These rays can for instance\nafi:ect the brain of a mechanic or chauffeur or the machinery of a\nship or the engine of a railway train, and thus provoke a disaster in\naccordance with a \" prophetic \" dream previously dreamed.

The\nlearned judge's standpoint is well known : he is a thorough dis-\nbeliever, if not in clairvoyance and telepathy in general, at least in\nthe supernormal capacities of the clairvoyants who specialise in the\ndiscovery of crimes. He does not know, he says, of a single case of\nthe kind in which clairvoyance or telepathy has been proved to\noperate. (The reader should be told that, as conclusively shown by\nDr Hellwig, the Insterburg Court which acquitted the Konigsberg\nKriminaltelepatJiin, also expressed substantially the same view,\nFrau Gunther-Gefi'ers being acquitted merely because it could not be\nproved that she did not herself believe in the genuineness of her\npowers).\nMany interesting subsidiary aspects of the problem are discussed\nby the Potsdam judge (he is in particular very hard on the Press) ;\nthe whole, in spite of inevitable repetitions, is excellent reading,\nwhether we completely agree with Dr Hellwig or not.\nP.-P.-S.\nTijdschrift voor ParapsycJiologie, November 1928-September 1929.\nThese are the first six numbers, forming the first volume, of a new\nDutch bi-monthly periodical devoted to psychical research, the\ncritical level of which is decidedly above the average. In the first\ntwo numbers is a long article by Dr Dietz on the paragnostic dream,\nwhich he holds to be established. But as he bases his argument\nchiefly on Mr Dunne's book, Dr Dietz's conclusions must be received\nwith the same caution as that book. The invention of new terms in\npsychical research is as a rule to be deprecated ; but \" paragnostic\n\"\nseems to be a convenient word to express the acquisition of know-\nledge by supernormal means.\nIn the second and third numbers Mr van Rossen writes on fraudu-\nlent methods in direct writing, spirit-photography, and clairvoyance.\nThe writer shows considerable familiarity with the English literature\nof the subject (as do, indeed, nearly all the contributors to the\nTijdschrift), and gives many iDteresting illustrations of fraud.\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December i<)29\nDr Dietz has ao article in the third number on clairvoyance and\nthe extent of its distribution. He describes soroe experiments with\nplaying-cards dating back to 1916-1917, in which he and others acted\nas percipients. In his own case the procedure was as follows : Dr\nDietz shuffled a pack of cards, then, with closed eyes, cut it ; he then\nwrapped the top card in photographic black paper or placed it in a\nbook. Later this was done by another person. The results were\n(p. 105 ; I have added the chance expectation in each case) : 4712\nguesses, entirely right 128 (chance expectation 91), value right 403\n(chance expectation 363), suit right 1348 (chance expectation 1178),\ncolour right 2433 (chance expectation 2356). These results are\nrather odd : the degree of success increases with the difficulty of the\ntask. That is, the proportion of successes progressively increases\nfrom colour only right to those that were entirely right.\nDr Tenhaeff contributes a study of veridical hallucination to the\nfifth number, from which it appears that it is proposed to undertake\na Dutch census of hallucinations.

In the fourth number Mr De Fremery points to\nthe difficulty of establishing telekinesis in any satisfactory way.\nIt will be seen that the Tijdschrift attempts to cover the whole\nfield of psychical research and its kindred studies. On the whole,\nit has so far done this successfully, and if it will in future avoid\nirrelevancies such as astrology and medicine, it should have a long\nand useful life.\nPsychic Research, October 1929.\nMr Bird prints the first instalment of what promises to be a very\nlengthy survey of so-called experimental telepathy. I say \" so-\ncalled \" because Mr Bird devotes a large part of this instalment to\nMiss Jephson's recent experiments in clairvoyance, one of the objects\nof which was to exclude telepathy. In addition Mr Bird summarises\nDr Bruck's well-known experiments. But the most interesting part\nof his article is an informal account of the wireless experiment in\nthought-transference condiicted by him and by Dr Gardner Murphy\nfrom Newark in 1924. (I may remark parenthetically that Mr Bird\nseems not to be aware of the similar S.P.R. experiment). Before\ncommenting on this experiment I prefer to wait until the official\nfigures are published. I hope that Dr Murphy and Mr Bird will pay\nspecial attention in their report to the results of their first test. In\nthis the percipients were asked to think of a number between 1 and\n1,000, the number selected for transmission being 522. Of the 457\npersons who replied 14 gave 999, 2 gave another number (it is not\nstated which), and all the rest gave dift'erent nmnbers, none being\ncorrect.

An Auditory Premonition.\nMiss Nea Walker writes :\nIn August this year I received a letter from Mrs Leonard telling\nme of a small disaster wliich. had happened to her apparently because\nshe had omitted to attend to a warning given to her by Feda, her\nControl. As often happens, the warning came in the form of a\ncommand not to do a certain thing (in this case not to hold her\nsittings in the usual room), but no reasons were given. As Mrs\nLeonard could not understand the warning, and could herself find\nno reason for it, she ignored it, since to attend to it would have been\nvery inconvenient.\nHer husband was the only person to whom she mentioned the\nwarning before the justification for it appeared. This is unfortunate,\nbut knowing her. Sir Oliver Lodge and one or two others who have\nseen the letter, feel that the story can be accepted as perfectly true,\nand that it should be recorded. I only heard of it because Mrs\nLeonard happened to be writing to me just after the disaster ; it\nwas not sent to me for publication at all.\nI have tried to make the story more valuable from an S.P.R.\npoint of view by asking a few questions of Mrs Leonard as to the\nmanner in which the warning reached her. These, and i\\Irs Leonard's\nanswers, and Mr Leonard's corroboration, I append to the extracts\nfrom the letter.\nExtracts from a letter {dated 7 August [1929^^) from Mrs Leonard to\nMissN. Waller:\n\" Such a horrid thing has happened. Yesterday, while I was\nhaving a sitting (fortunately towards the end) the ceiling of the\nroom gave way, and came down, over six feet in diameter, and the\nrest is all cracked. It was like an explosion, the noise, tho' Feda\nkept murmuring as she retired (which she did very quietly so as not\n\f.2 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli Januakt ]<j30\nto upset me more than she could help), '\nIt's all right\u2014it's all right.'\nThe sitter threw herself on top of me, and the notetaker on top of\nthe sitter. Neither the sitter nor I were hit, though pieces of very-\nheavy material weighing 20 or 30 pounds just missed us, but a piece\nstruck the notetaker on the head. I do hope she Avill be all right.\nIt seemed a terrible lump on her head.\n\" Vases of flowers were knocked over, water and cement ran onto\nand into everything, including the piano. You never saw such a\nhorrid mess.\n\" I thought that I recovered from the shock beautifully except\nfor a congested feeling in the head, but later on I felt really ill,\nhorribly sick all night, a thing that never happens to me, and faint-\ning, not a wink of sleep, put oJJ sitters to-day, feel better to-night. . . .\n\" On examining the ceiling (what's left of it) I fear that having\nthe electric fittings in did the mischief. And now I find that our\nbedroom, that was fitted out for the U.V. Eay lamp, looks as if it\nmight cave in at the ceiling, so I have got to get it all seen to.\nThey were splendid, very thick plaster ceilings, but so heavy that\nwhen once there was a weakness, they had to come down. . . .\n\" The wonderful thing is, that I heard Feda tell me, three times,\nwhile I was on my holiday, towards the end, not to sit in that room\nwhen I returned home.' I told my husband, but as neither of us\ncould see any reason for it, and it would have been a bother changing\nrooms, we put it off, with unpleasant results. I was pleased I had\ntold him what I heard, but sorry I didn't obey orders. '\nThey '\nare\nalways right if they give one these curious instructions in so definite\na manner. Probably Feda did not know it was the ceiling, but\nsimply knew something was wrong in the room. Have changed my\nbedroom, till I get the other ceiling seen to. ...\n\"\nQuestions asked by Miss N. Wall-er {2 September 1929) and Mrs.\nLeonard's written replies (2 November 1929) :\nQ. : The date or dates on which the warnings came, if obtainable ?\nAnyway the approximate time, and any information which settled\nthat.\nA. : Between the ITth and 24th of July. This was the last week\nof my holidays\u2014so I remember it clearly. There were three occasions.\nTwo of the warnings were given mentally. One seemed to be direct\nVoice. All came early in the mornings, soon after waking.\nI received a warning regarding my bedroom ceiling directly I\narrived home on the 24th July. As I opened a cupboard door in\nan unused bedroom, I heard an inward, but very strong, voice say\n' Stop sleeping in your usual room, come and sleep in here.\" I did\nso the next day, but had no idea why.\n\fJanuary 1930 Case 3\nAfter the Seance room ceiling fell, we asked the builder to examine\nmy bedroom (the recently vacated one). He said it must come\ndown. A few weeks later, when the workmen began to tackle it, a\nlarge portion came down by itself, immediately over my bed (where\nthe bed had been) and nearly buried a workman who was standing\nunder it, but no large piece hit him, fortunately.\nQ. : Date of the fall of the ceiling ? That will be the same as the\n\"date of the sitting, which of course you know.\nA. : Tues. afternoon, Aug. 6th.\nQ. : Had you any idea previously, conscious idea that is, that\nthe ceilings were likely to be in a weak state I Can you think of\nanything which might have suggested it to you ?\nA. : I had no idea of any kind. The ceiling that fell, and the bed-\nroom that was declared dangerous were both in the modern part of\nthe house.\nThe ceiling that fell looked perfect, the best in the house. I have\nnever been in a house, before, where a ceiling fell. It is a contingency\nthat has never entered my mind.\nQ. : Can you tell how the warnings came to you, I mean the form\nin which they came ? Was there an externalised voice, or an\ninward voice, or a dream, or automatic writing, or merely an idea ?\nPlease give as much information about this as you can. And at\n\"what intervals of time did the warnings come ?\nA. : I should say it was an \" inward voice \" on two occasions,\niind an external one on the third occasion. A couple or three days\nin between each warning.\nQ. : Will Mr Leonard please corroborate your statement that you\n1;old him of the warnings ? And if by chance any third party was\ntold, and their verification of knowing before the event is available,\nit would be valuable.\nA. (by Mr Leonard) : I remember distinctly my wife telling me\non three occasions that she had been warned not to sit in the usual\n.seance room on her return home. (Signed) F. W. Leonard.\nQ. : If the Sitter and Note-taker have anything to say about the\nevent, and about what Feda did and said at the moment, it might\nbe useful ? They seem to have had remarkable presence of mind.\nA. : The sitter said that Feda simply murmured several times,\nIt's all right. It's all right,\" and left quietly.\nAt the time and during the evening I felt no shock whatever but\nimmediately after going to bed (as soon as I began to try to sleep)\nI had a really bad pain, like a bruised feeling in, and over, the\nstomach. After half an hour, I began to be violently sick. This\ncontinued for some hours, with faintness and exhaustion. I rested\nin bed all next day, too weak to stand up but was all right for work\nagain the day after. I am never sick, normally.\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January i930'\n[The letter and statements quoted above have been seen by me.\nThe incident has been classed as a premonition, bat of course so\nserious a fall of the ceiling must have been preceded by tell-tale\nmarks in or sounds from it ; and in the nature of the case the\npossibility that these indications may have been observed by Mrs\nLeonard unconsciously, or in trance, cannot be ruled out. Ed.'\\\nNOTE CONCEKNING THE HACKING CASE.\nBy J. Arthur Hill and Mrs E. M. Sidgwick.\nOur readers may remember that in 1925 a pamphlet by Mr W.\nHarrison Barwell entitled The Spirit Return of Mr Hacking was\npublished by The Two Worlds Publishing Co., Ltd. The case was\nreprinted from The Two Worlds and it quotes communications\nobtained in Mr Barwell's private circle at Sheffield with no profes-\nsional medium present and purporting to come from Mr Hacking, a\ndeceased schoolmaster of Bury in Lancashire. The case is a remark-\nable one on account of the large amount of detailed information,\ntopographical and personal, given about Bury and its inhabitants,\nmuch of which was ascertained to be true, although the medium said\nhe was imacquainted with Bury and we have fomid no reason to\ndisbelieve his statement. We endeavoiu'ed in various ways to carry\nthe study of the case fiirther. By the kindness of Mr Barwell,\nMr Hill was present at four sittings in Mr Barwell's circle. Among\nother things he received from a communicator other than Mr\nHacking a good deal of new matter concerning the topography and\nformer inhabitants of a district in Yorkshire many miles from Bury\nin Lancashire, matter which he afterwards verified by enquiries on\nthe spot. We do not, however, feel that our various researches add\nsufficiently to the evidence in the case to warrant publication at\npresent. It is to be hoped that the mediima will develop further,\nand that through him, or some other medium, more light may be\nthrown on the source of the knowledge shown. Meanwhile the notes\nand correspondence, to some extent private and confidential, accu-\nmulated concerning the case by both investigators are in the\nkeeping of Mr Hill, who may in due coiirse hand them over to the\nS.P.R. In the meantime he will be glad to hear from anyone\nwho may happen to have information to give connected with the\nsubject.\n\fJanuary 1930 Notes on Psychology of Nonsense Names 5\nNOTES ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF NONSENSE NAMES.\nBy H. F. Saltmarsh.\nIn tlie series of sittings with Mrs Warren Elliott recently reported\nin Proceedings it was found that a considerable number of queer\nnames were given and certain peculiarities in these names were\nnoticed. Some details are given in the Report {Proceedings, xxxix.\n98-9). An attempt has been made to throw some light on the\ngenesis of these names by an experiment in which a number of\npersons were asked to invent sets of nonsense names. They were\nrequested to keep their minds as blank as possible and to write\ndown the names as they came. By a study of these names it was\nhoped that some parallels with the peculiarities noticed with\nIMrs Elliott might be discovered. The subject-matter is from its\nnature very nebulous and is treated here in a rather rough and\nready fashion. Had opportunity permitted, a deeper investigation\nby means of free association tests might have been undertaken, but\nthis would have entailed the expenditiu\"e of a large amount of\ntime and labour on the part of everyone concerned for which the\nimportance of the question was not sufficient justification. More-\nover the rough and ready method of simple inspection of the names\nhas sufficed to reveal certain tendencies, which, if applicable to the\nphenomena of mediumistic communications, throw some light on\nthe subject.\nThe primary requisite for dealing with the matter is to adopt\nsome system of classification for the names. The most obvious\ndivision is into real inventions and common nonsense names.\nExamples of the first class are : Estimol, Ralula, Simoes, Pureeto,\nQuostick, Borawell, etc. ; of the second : Billikins, Jim-jam,\nHanky-panky, Dumpy, Cruikshanlis, and so on.\nAnother division is into what may be called literary soimding\nand comic names. Of the first Anty-dotomor, Talacunate, Carmon,\nBortholotus, may be cited as examples ; of the second, Plimple,\nHonk, Snufters, and Wumpff.\nThere is also a well-defined class which I have called dual names.\nThese are those names which consist of two parts having a similar\nsoimd and differing only in the initial letters, like Rmito-punto, or\nin the vowel soimd, as in Jim-jam. Double names with less close\nresemblance between the two parts, as in Wickle Wambles, may also\nbe considered as a type of duals.\nA further class may be termed the childish names, that is to say,\nnames of the kind which naturally tend to be used with children,\nsuch as Chick-a-biddy, Duckums ; those ending in -kins usually fall\n-into this class.\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1930'\nCertain names show their associative origin clearly on the surface^\nfor example, association with place names, as in Verycombe from a\ncontributor whose home is in Devonshire ; others have a sort of\nfamily likeness to some foreign language.\nTwenty persons took part in this experiment. Of these seven\nproduced lists of names consisting mainly or entirely of real inven-\ntions. The lists of eleven contained mostly common names ; two\nfailed altogether. While those of the second class may occasionally\nproduce a real invention by a sort of transitory flash of genius, it is\nrare for a member of the first class to lapse from his high estate and\ncondescend to a common name. Among the second class we find\nseveral who state that they experienced difficulty in thinlving of\nnames. It may be concluded that the faculty of inventing nonsense\nnames is not given to everybody. The classical example of real\nnonsense names is, of course, Lewis Carroll ; the names invented by\nhim, in Jabberwocky for example, amount to sheer genius.\nIn the group of people before us, the best inventors have given\nas a whole names of a literary character ; their lists contain few, if\nany, common names, no duals and no childish names. The next best\nare those whose names are of the type here termed comic. Inven-\ntion with these does not seem to flow so freely, but this may be\nmerely accidental for this particular group of persons. There is a\ntendency for common names to creep in, also for duals ; the tendency\nto childish names, if it exists, is probably consciously resisted.\nFollowing these are the best of the second class. With them^com-\nnion names or approximations thereto constitute the larger part,\nduals are frequent, and the tendency to childish is very apparent-\nThe remainder of this class should properly be counted as failures ;\ntheir prodtictions are so hackneyed that invention can hardly be said\nto have played any part.\nAlthough the number taking part in the experiment is not suffi-\nciently large to afford a sound basis for generalisation, the following\nseems to be indicated. The scale of inventive faculty seems to\ndescend from literary, through comic, to duals and childish. There\nappears to be some connection between the two latter types of\nnames. I have frequently noticed that many people, in talking to\nyoung children, tend to use many repetitions of the same words or\nsimilar sounds. This is probably due to the fact that the first vocal\nefforts of the infant consist of repetitions of the same meaningless\nsounds and those talking to them imitate this habit.\nThe important fact arising from this experiment is as follows.\nAmong the best inventors there is, in a good proportion of cases,\nclear evidence of habit. One contributor sent in two lists of f5\nnames each, made on different days ; the first list is all of words of\nthree syllables ; the terminations \" al,\" \" ol,\" \" ul \" occur five.\n\fJanuary 1030 Notes OH Psychology of Nonsense Names\ntimes in this list but not once in the second. All the words m both\nlists have what may be called a probable sound ; they might easily\nbe taken for words of a foreign language ;\nthere is a strong individual\ncharacter about all of them. Another contributor sent a list of\n27 names, most of which had a distinct Greek soimd and there was\na tendency to begin with P or Ph. This contributor informed me\nthat he is not a Greek scholar, and though he learned Greek at\nschool, he has forgotten all he learned. Probably subconscious\nmemory came into''play. Here again there is a strong individual\ncharacter about the names. In another case there are some signs of\nGerman influence ; this contributor, however, knows German. In\nanother case where the contributor knows and speaks several\nforeign languages fluently, there is no sign of foreign influence ;\nmost of the names are of the comic variety, which probably accounts\nfor this rather unexpected feature. Had the undoubted literary\ntendencies of this contributor been uppermost in his mind when\ninventing the names, probably some signs of foreign influence\nwould have showed. The evidence of habit among those of poorer\ninventive faculty is less apparent, though there is one case where\neight of the duals out of eleven have P as the initial letter for the\nsecond term, as in Eunto Punto.\nTurning now to Mrs Elliott's names, there is a complete absence\nof duals and childish names ; the absence of common names might\nseem to be due to the fact that the queer ones only have been picked\nout, but a sm-vey of the whole of the names given in the sittings\nshows very few of the common type ; the majority of the names\ngiven are ordinary Christian names which do not come into this\ninquiry at all.\nThe most marked habit with Mrs Elliott is the tendency to com-\nmence nonsense names with the initial 0. It was suggested that this\nmight be due to the influence of a childish association with her\nmaiden name, Ortner, and it was hoped that this experiment might\nshow examples of similar association. None such, however, can be\ntraced, so the matter must be left undetermined. The experiment\nhas shown that name habits do exist, particularly among those\nwhose inventive faculty is good ;\nMrs Elliott undoubtedly belongs\nto this class. The invention of real nonsense names probably works\nby means of association, whereas the production of common names\nis a mere question of memory. What these associations are in any\nparticular case could probably be discovered by means of the psycho-\nanalytic technique, but the importance of the matter does not\nwarrant the expenditure of the requisite time and energy.\nThe conclusions, then, to which we may arrive, tentatively, as the\nresult of this experiment are as follows :\n(1) The faculty of inventing nonsense names varies with different\n\f8 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research January 1930\nindividuals, ranging from complete incapacity np to what might be\ncalled genius.\n(2) Habits are displayed by many persons ; these habits are more\napparent among those whose inventive faculties are good.\n(3) Nonsense names show a tendency to be associated with\ncertain types of real names, such as a particular language, a peculiar\nconstruction, place names, and so on.\n(4) The cause of this association varies with the individual. No\nattempt has been made to discover the cause in any particular\ncase, but it may be surmised that it lies in his or her past history.\nCOERESPONDENCE.\nThe Spirit-Hypothesis.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I had no desire to intervene in the interesting discussion of\nthe spirit-hyjjothesis by Mrs Kingsley and Mr Soal ; but as the\nlatter implies that in the last thirty years I must have changed my\nmind, I suppose I must contribute my mite.\nMay I begin by p)ointing out that I have dealt with the very\nsubject under discussion much less than thirty years ago, namely in\nmy paper in The Case for and against Psychical Belief (1927), especi-\nally pj). 223-i ? I do not feel that I have therein altered my attitude\nmaterially. Nor can I see that the rise of psychoanalysis has altered\nthe status of \" unconscious \" psychic process at all. For strict\npsychological orthodoxy it remains as paradoxical as ever. Indeed\nit can now be disposed of more summarily by means of behaviour-\nism, and if orthodoxy had to choose between psychoanalysis and\nbehaviourism, it would doubtless jjrefer the latter.\nMoreover the methodological advantages of spiritualism seem to\nremain. All the facts Mr Soal mentions at xxv. 177 were known\nbefore ; and it has not grown more convincing than formerly to\nurge that because a belief is primitive it must be wrong. It may\nalso be right. And though the general tendency of psychic pheno-\nmena to assume a spiritualistic form can be explained away, if we\nare willing to make a number of complica.ted assumptions, it yet\nremains one of their primary characteristics, in spite of the excep-\ntional cases to which Mr Soal refers.\nI agree, of course, with Mr Soal that the spirit-hypothesis is \"so\nwide, so vague, so convenient, that it can be safely applied to\nalmost anything \"\n(p. 179). But it shares these advantages Avith all\nthe other hypotheses, and this for the reason that they are all alike\nprojected upon a background of almost total ignorance. So we are\nentitled to ask : is the devil a less elastic hypothesis ? Or the deity,\n\fJanuary 1930 Correspondence 9\nalias the \" cosmic reservoir \" ? Or universal all-embracing tele-\npathy ? All these allegations seem to explain everything, simply\nbecause we hardly know what we mean by them and know too little\nabout the facts to set limits to their operations.\nWhat is the remedy 1 Surely not that we should rule out any\nhypothesis a priori, out of the plenitude of our ignorance, but that\nwe should explore them all, and gradually determine their natures\nand the limits of their powers. Surely that is the way to find out\nw^hat we should mean by terms like \" spirits,\" \" demons,\" \" sub-\nliminal,\" \" telepathy,\" etc. And it is also safe to predict that any\nknowledge we acquire is sure to modify and transform the meaning\nof our terms.\nYours, etc.,\nF.

Price 7s. 6d. net.\nA pleasant and interesting biography written by a dutiful and\nappreciative daughter of a kind and gifted mother. This strain quite\nproperly runs through the whole story. The loyalty of the authoress\nis conspicuous in every discussion personal to her mother. The life\nof Mrs Piper, the celebrated medium, is described from her earliest\nchildhood till the present day with special reference to her super-\nnormal power and her relations with distinguished researchers like\nProfessor William James, Sir Oliver Lodge (who has written an\nintroduction), Dr Hodgson, and others. Many incidents of the family\nlife are also included which have no direct connection with psychical\nmatters. The book is one for interested readers rather than for\nscientific students. The latter, if they wish to study Mrs Piper's\nwork must refer to the records of the Society, in which it has been\nvoluminously discussed from every point of view. Some readers\nmay be encouraged to become students by an agreeable introduction\nto the subject and the indication of the material for future inquiries.\nMrs Piper had some psychic experiences in her childhood, but the\ndiscovery of her mediumistic powers came accidentally more than\nthree years after her marriage. AVhile attending a healing and\ndevelopment circle, apparently for a cure of her own j^hysical ail-\nments, she was suddenly entranced after being touched by the\nmedium. In this state she received by automatic writing a com-\nmunication for one of the sitters purporting to come from his deceased\nson. The sitter welcomed it gratefully and was convinced of its\nauthenticity (pp. 17, 18). She then began to give occasional sittings,\n\f10 Journal of Society for FsychicaL Research January 1930\nbut with some reluctance. Professor William James hearing of her\nachievements proceeded to test her and after several sittings was\nconvinced of the supernormal nature of her sittings. Owing to the\njjressure of other work he made over these duties to Dr Hodgson, who\nwas associated with her from 1887 till his sudden death in 1905. An\naccount of his death preceded by what may have been a warning\nand accompanied by a dream of Mrs Piper's is given in pp. 116-119.\nLater arrangements for her work in the United States and England\nare mentioned. The various Controls are noticed, especially the\nImperator Group. At first the voice was used (p. 84), then came a\nperiod of automatic writing ; there was trance with both methods.\nOn p. 86 is an interesting account of three communications being\nmade simultaneously, one through the voice and two by automatic\nwriting, both hands being used. With the temporary retirement of\nthe Imperator Group in 1911 trance was replaced by conscious\nautomatic writing; in 1915 it began again (pp. 172, 178). A later\nphenomenon is Mrs Piper's power of giving consciously in a waking\nstate with her normal voice spiritual advice of the kind that used to\nbe given by Rector in trance (pp. 88, 89). Some of the most striking\nincidents of her m.ediumship are mentioned with more or less detail.\nThere are several chapters about cross-correspondences and one of\naphorisms. There are descriptions, some of which seem strange\nnow-a-days. of the early precautions taken to test and restrict the\nmedium's normal knowledge, and of the experiments to gauge the\ndepth of her trance. Mrs Piper had to submit to measures requiring\ngreat patience on her part. No complaint is made except of one\nexperiment for Avhich the Society had no more than an indirect and\ntechnical responsibility (pp. 169-175.) It is satisfactory to find the\nemphatic approval of the Society's arrangements expressed in the\nlast paragraph of p. 175.\nOther explanations than the spiritualistic theory for the pheno-\nmena are briefly considered. The problem is similar to that which\nI discussed in the article \" Life Beyond Death with Evidence \" in\nthe Journal for March 1929 (xxv. 50-59). In conclusion the authoress\ncjuotes Sir Oliver Lodge's appreciation of her mother's service to the\ndifficult science of psychical research, a tribute w^hich the general\nopinion of the Society will cordially endorse, \\y Trethewy.\nGwendolyn Kelley Hack, Modern Psijchic Mysteries, Millesimo'\nCastle, Italy.

These phenomena are largely of two tjipes :\nthe direct voice, stated to manifest through the mediumship of the\nMarquis, and apports, for which Signora Rossi's mediumship is\ndeclared to be responsible.\nThe Marquis Centurione Scotto, having lost a son, had sittings\nwith the medium Yaliantine in Mr Bradley's house, and as a result\nof the phenomena there produced he decided to try and obtain the\nso-called direct voice himself. Sittings were held in Millesimo Castle\nand at his house in Genoa, at which remarkable phenomena were\nsoon obtained, consisting, as already noted, of apports as well as of\nthe direct voice, thoiigh the apports never occurred in the absence\nof Signora Rossi. These sittings were reported on in Luce e Omhra\nby Signor Bozzano. whose reports have attracted great attention\never}'where, and especially in England. They have now been\npublished in book form together with supplementary material, the\nwhole edited by Mrs Hack.^ The general interest thus aroused\nseems to make it necessary to \\mte the present review. For it\ncannot be disguised that Signor Bozzano 's reports do not in them-'\nselves merit serious attention on evidential grounds. They show an\nalmost complete lack of understanding of what constitutes good\nevidence and adequate recording of mediumistic sittings. Grounds\nfor this accusation can be foimd on every page of his reports ; but\nit is unnecessary to attempt a detailed criticism, the more so as this\ntask has already been admirably performed (in regard to Signor\nBozzano's original Italian reports) by Herr Lambert in the Zcil-\nschrifi filr Parapsychologie (1929, iv. 465-482). I am in full agree-\nment with nearly all the remarlis of Herr Lambert. Here I merelv\npropose to touch briefly on those incidents and types of incidents to\nwhich Signor Bozzano has drawn special attention in the Preface\nwhich he has contributed to the present volume. This Preface he\nconcludes with the words (p. 19) :\n\" All of which goes to prove that\nthe endeavour to controvert my statements will be not only an\narduous undertaking, but will prove to be literally an impossible\ntask.\" These words show, in no uncertain way, the importance\nwhich Signor Bozzano expects us to attach to his reports ; let us,,\nnevertheless, essay this impossible task.\nA few general observations are first necessary. These sittings were\nheld (with a few unimportant exceptions) without any measures of\ncontrol whatever, in complete darkness, with a gramoi^hone playing\npractically all the time, in the Marquis Centurione Scotto's o\\vn_\n^ In the present review I take into account only Signor Bozzano's reports.\nThe remainder of the book (with the exception of a few pages by Professor\nCastellani) is too confused and ill-arranged to be seriously considered, apart\nfrom being disfigured by scores of misprints and literal mistakes.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1930\nhome, in the presence of his family and friends, those present not\nbeing searched, the seating arrangements not being described (though\nit appears from certain incidents that the two mediums sat side by\nside), and in a room which is nowhere directly described. Indirect\nobservations and two rough sketches (not to scale and apparently\nnot parts of the original reports) show us that this room has doors\non three of its sides and a Avindow (opening apparently over a\ngarden) on the fourth side.\nThe first type of phenomenon to which Signor Bozzano draws the\nspecial attention of critics is the \" infallible precision \"\n(p. 7) with\nw^hich the trumpets \" whirl and twist about with great speed \" and\n\" in total darkness.\" Signor Bozzano declares that this could be\ndone only if the performers were \" nictalopes \" [sic], that is, were\nable to see in the dark. This not being the case (of course we are\nnot told how Signor Bozzano knows this not to be the case), \" it\nw'ould be impossible to obtain [these phenomena] by fraudulent\nmeans.\"\nWliat are the facts ? I open the book at random at p. 174 and\nfind that in the sitting described on that page, \" Mile Chiappini\ntwice received a rather violent knock on the head,\" \" The Marquis\nfelt a blow on his right side,\" \" Bozzano was knocked on the head\n[see below],\" and the Marquis received \" a hard knock on the head.\"\nIs this what Signor Bozzano considers such \" infallible precision\n\"\nthat it must be ascribed to supernormal agency ?\nI turn, in Signor Bozzano's words, \" to a second physical pheno-\nmenon which is equally imjjossible to obtain by fraudulent methods\n\"\n(p. 8). This phenomenon is the cold currents felt at many sittings\nfrom various directions, streams of air which seem sometimes to\nhave attained great strength. A classic method of fraudulently\nproducing this phenomenon is by means of collapsible rubber\nIjalloons, which can be brought into the seance-Toom in a waistcoat\npocket or in even smaller receptacles. These balloons are then\nblown up and deflated separately or together, while held at various\nangles or while being moved about. It will be noted that while this\nis being done the medium has full liberty of speech. It is even\npossible for the medium to be controlled during the deflation of the\nballoons, for these can be put down in convenient places and allowed\nto deflate themselves, the deflated balloons being collected later as\nconvenient.\nNow, on the same page already quoted from (p. 174) we find the\nfollowing passage (my italics) :\n\" The icy wind was stronger than\never, the mediums [ !\n] in the circle stating that they felt chilled to\nthe marrow. M. Passini was touched on the knee by one of the\ntrumpets, and Bozzano was knocked on the Jiead by something of an\nclastic nature which felt like a big indiarubber balloon.'\" It is surely\n\fJanvaey 1930 licvicics 13\nevidence of an utterly uncritical habit of thought that Signer\nBozzano actually wrote these two sentences without even suspecting\n(or giving any sign of suspecting) a causal connection between the\nincidents described in them.\nNext Signor Bozzano adduces the playing during the sittings of a\nNorth American musical instrument called the flexatone.\" He\nwrites (p. 9) that \" no one had ever heard of it before, no one knew\nhow to play it, and its technique appears difficult to acquire.\" The\n\" flexatone \" is first mentioned on p. 85 ; we are not told at whose\nsuggestion so unexpected an instrument was introduced into the\nsittings and for what reason, especially as no one \" had ever heard\nof it before \"\n;\nnor, although \" apported \" swords and other objects,\npictorially quite banal, are illustrated and described at length\n(though of course not in their evidentially imjjortant aspects), does\nSignor Bozzano think it worth while to illustrate or adequately to\ndescribe this instrument. I have been unable to find any reference\nto a \" flexatone \" in the standard musical and other works of refer-\nence. Under these circumstances we lack all the facts necessary to\nenable us to form any kind of judgment as to the merits of Signor\nBozzano's claim.\nThe next phenomenon emphasised by Signor Bozzano (pp. 9-10)\nI cannot deal with as it occurred at a sitting not reported on in the\nbook under review.\nNext we have the apports and \" asports,\" that is, the objects\nsupernormally introduced into and removed from the room. The\nevidence for the supernormal nature of these phenomena is so slight\nthat it requires a mental efiort even seriously to criticise it. However,\nI will briefly touch on one or two of the phenomena of this type\nwhich Signor Bozzano considers to be of special importance. At the\nlast sitting described in the book (pp. 316-320) the doors were sealed\nat the request of the Control, though not of course as a measure of\ncontrol, but merely \" in order to delay the sitting \" so as to enable\na late comer to take part (p. 315) : the window is not mentioned.\nOn this occasion, the only one in the series under consideration in\nwhich even this nominal amount of control was introduced, a doll\nand a sword were \" apported \" from what appears (for of course we\nare not told) to be the next room. The doll is described as \" big\n\"\nand as \" enormously large \"\n(p. 320) : but from the illustrntion\n(facing p. 312, measurements being of coujse not given), this doll\nwould seem to be at most 15 inches high. The sword is also illus-\ntrated (facing p. 328), but of course without measurements. It\nwould seem to be a short sword in its scabbard, of the kind used by\nfootmen against horses, and about two feet long. (This sword is\ndescribed [p. 320] as \" exceedingly heavy \" ; of course the weight is\nnot given, but it is obviously a contradiction in terms to describe\n\f1-i Journal of Society for Psychical Research January 1930\nany practicable sword, sucli as this, as \" exceedingly heavy \"). It\nwill be seen that it is not even necessary to assume the co-operation\nof an accomplice : both these objects could easily be hidden in a\nwoman's dress ; the reader will remember that no apport ever\noccurred in the absence of one of the mediums, Signora Rossi.\nAnother apport to which Signor Bozzano specifically directs\nattention in his Preface (pp. 10-11 ;\ncp. pp. 86, 99) is one in which\nthe Control announced to the Marchioness Centurione Scotto that\na near relative of hers was destined to die. The Marchioness asked\nwho this relative was, and in reply a framed photograph of the\nperson in question was \" apported.\" This incident Signor Bozzano\nconsiders so evidentially .strong that it is in itself \" enough to put\nto confusion all the monotonous and ignorant harangues of the\nadherents of the theory of universal fraud \"\n(p. 99). This modest\nclaim is based on the alleged facts (1) that \"the hypothetical\nfraudulent medium must have guessed that a near relation [s^'c] of\nthe Centurione Scotto's [sic] would be taken seriously ill two days\nlater and would eventually die (p. 99), and (2) that the Marchioness\n\" would ask him just such a question,\" framed \" on the spur of the\nmoment \"\n(p. 99).\nWhat are the facts l As regards (1) Signor Bozzano has radically\naltered the statement of the Control, which was, according to Signor\nBozzano's own report (p. 86) :\n\" Destiny will bring you the death\nof a near relation [.s;c].\" There is here no mention of any illness nor\nof any period of time. Already the prophecy has practically no\nevidential value. What value remains in it when we remember that\nthe medium in question is the Marquis himself and when we read\nthe following exclamation of the Marchioness's (p. 86, my italics) :\n\" Oh, speak, speak, d'Angelo [the Control] ! Is it really true ? The\nlast news was excellent. He was recovering rapidly \" ? As regards\n(2) I can only say that the question which Signor Bozzano regards\nas so strikingly unexpected is in my o^^inion precisely the one that\nis most obvious and the one that is, in fact, invariably asked under\nsuch circumstances.\nSignor Bozzano proceeds to still further \" conclusive \" instances,\nsuch as the levitation of the Marquis with a chair and his \" asporta-\ntion \" from the room ; but it seems useless to continue our analysis.\nIt must be already obvious that Signor Bozzano's claims are wholly\nunfounded, and that the Millesimo sittings have not the slightest\nvestige of scientific value. All groups of jDeople have of course the\nunquestionable right to sit in circles for their own edification ; but\nto put forward such a book as this as a serious contribution to\njDsychical research, and to put it forward with such dogmatic claims\nof infallibility as Signor Bozzano's, is to bring our subject into\ncontempt and disrepute. Theodore Besterman.\n\fJanuaey 1930 Notes on Periodicals 15\nNOTES ON PEEIODICALS.\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie, December 1929.\nMr Florizel voii Renter describes a sitting of Eudi Schneider's at\nBrauuau in April 1928, which he thinks quite convincing and satis-\nfactory. In an account dated 7 February 1917, Fran M. Wagner\nnarrates some poltergeist experiences of hers in Potsdam. Herr\nWilly Seidel contributes a paper on materialisation phenomena in\nEastern (chiefly Japanese) art.\nHerr Fritz Priibusch considers it necessary to suggest once more\nnew names for different branches of \" parapsychology.\" This he\nwould call \" parabiology\" Various other terms also crop up under\nhis pen, such as parascopy, paroscillatorics, proscopy. parakinetics,\nparaplastics. If we had at our disposal half as many perfectly\nattested observations of a positive kind in the domain of physical\nphenomena as we have high-sounding scientific names, I should\ndeem psychical research singularly fortunate.\nThe last instalment of Dr Kroner's detailed account of George\nValiantine's exposure in Berlin in April last is printed, the writer\nsumming up the evidence. To me the most instructive side of the\nwhole episode is not so much Valiantine's fiasco as the part played\nby his admirers and friends such as Mr Bradley, the latter going in\nhis attempts to prevent an exposure so far as to threaten the hostess\nwith an appeal to the Embassy of the United States to interfere in\nthe interest of an American citizen's health ! After reading the\nKroner report it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Mr Bradley's\nname amply deserves to be added to the long list of those spiritual-\nists who, whatever their motives, complicate to the utmost the\npsychical researcher's already arduous task.\nLetters are printed in Dr. Kroner's paper from Professor Bozzano,\nMrs Bradley and Mrs Hack, describing test sittings given by\nValiantine, after leaving Berlin, in Genoa. It is very significant\nthat, whilst in her letter Mrs Bradley says that at the sitting given\nat the request of the Editor of [Luce e] Omhra \" marvellous pheno-\nmena \" occurred, all the seals remaining completely intact after,\nMrs Hack speaks of all the bindings being torn away in some\nmysterious fashion. So great is the discrepancy that one almost\ndoubts whether the two ladies refer to the same sittings.\nKleine Mitteilungen in the same review inform us inter alia of the\ndemise of Herr Tartaruga's \" Parapsychical Institute \" in Vienna ;\nHerr Wilhelm Geyer, of Wiirzburg, narrates a curious incident\noccurring some years ago when he felt irresistibly compelled to insist\nrepeatedly on the presence at a certain party of a young teacher. If\nthe latter had complied with these summonses and come at the time\n\f16 Journal oj Society jor Psychical Research January 1930\nappointed lie would not have become the victim on the same even-\ning of a street scuffle.

Dr Burns concludes his further\nstudies in apparent obsession. The discussion of the current status\nof the Schneider mediumships is most unprofitably continued with\na summary of what has gone before and a lengthy letter from Miss\nMay Walker in criticism of Dr Prince's and Mr Bird's adverse\nreports on the Schneiders. The refutation of Miss Walker's observa-\ntions offers very little difficulty to Mr Bird.\nJournal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, October-December 1929.\nEarlier in the year Drs J. and Louisa E. Rhine published in the\njournal under review (xxiii. 448-466) an investigation of Lady, a\n\" niind-reading \" horse, which they had carried out with the assist-\nance of Professor McDougall. The investigators came to the con-\nclusion, after careful tests during which they gradually eliminated\nnormal methods of communication, that Lady had a genuine\ntelepathic faculty. In the present issue Dr and Mrs Rhine publish\na second report on this horse, from which it appears that she has now\nentirely lost her faculty, and this although she is now older and\nunder much better control than she was before. In the earlier series\nthe investigators found that Lady was most successful when she fell\ninto a curious passive state ; in the later series now reported on this\npassive state had also disappeared. This cessation of faculty is very\ngreatly to be regretted, for the earlier report just mentioned offered\nthe first good, though I think still not conclusive, evidence for\nthought-transference between a human and a lower animal mind.\nJournal de Psychologic, July-October 1929.\nThis doiible number is one of considerable interest to students of\nthe psychological problems connected with psychical research.\nProfessor Claparede contributes (pp. 4.33-493) an encyclopaedic\nsurvey of the problems of sleep, with a valuable bibliography of\nrecent publications. A posthumous study by Georges Lamarque\nof the sensation of obstacles in the blind presents many points of\ninterest, to which I hope to return at a later date. Among the\nshorter papers is one by M.

During the year a number of\ninvestigations were carried out by the Hon. Research Officer and\nMrs Brackenbury. Accounts of two of these cases, both alleged\ndeath premonitions, have been printed in the Journal in April and\nJune respectively (xxv. 66-68, 102-104). Two supposed poltergeist\nhauntings were visited, in St Neots and in Lambeth, but in neither\ncase could any satisfactory evidence be obtained that the dis-\nturbances were of a supernormal character. Two visits were paid\nto a wood at Kingsdown in Kent where an apparition was stated to\nhave been seen by a number of people, but nothing abnormal\nappeared on either occasion, and it seems that the supposed ghost\nwas an instance of practical joking.\nA prolonged investigation by Mrs Brackenbury into the \" tomb-\nstone case \" described by Sir Lawrence Jones in the Journal for\nOctober 1928 (xxiv. 336-337), met with complete success so far as\nconcerns the grave and the tracing of the various living people\nconcerned, all of whom have been interviewed. It is hoped to\nprint the details later.\nTwo series of sittings were held during the year, with M. Pascal\nForthuny and with Mrs Brittain. M. Forthuny spent three weeks\nin London as the guest of the Society and gave three open demon-\nstrations of his mediumship, as well as a nundjer of private sittings.\nIt is hoped to publish in Proceedings a report on the sittings with\nM. Forthuny.\nA-'isits were made to the Falconer brothers, the Edinburgh photo-\ngraphic mediums, and to a designer of an instrument (the so-called\nReflectograph) for receiving alleged spirit communications in the\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research February 1930\ndark. Sittings also took place with Mnie Kahl, who had been\npreviously visited by Mr Besterman (see Proceedings, xxxviii. 413-\n433), and with Mrs Plaat, a psychometric and clairvoyant medium.\nAlthoixgh all these cases were of some interest, the results obtained\nwere not of sufficient importance to justify the printing of a\nreport.\nEx'periwents in Telepathj and Clairvoi\/ance. The experiments in\ntelepathy and clairvoyance mentioned in the last Annual Report\nhave been continued in 1929, and a large amount of material has\nbeen collected which will, it is hoped, prove of assistance towards\na better understanding of both these subjects. In fact, when the\nnumber of percipients who have co-operated and other relevant\ncircumstances have been taken into account, the Council regard\nthese experiments as among the most important pieces of experi-\nmental work which have been undertaken on the Society's\nbehalf.\nThe telepathy experiments under Mr Seal's direction with the\nlarge group of nearly 700 persons with whom Mr Soal was brought\ninto touch through the B.B.C. came to an end in April ;\nby that\ntime 71 experiments spread over 23 weeks had been held.\nAs many of this group had expressed their willingness to co-\noperate in further experiments, Miss Jephson, Mr Soal and Mr\nBesterman invited them to help in developing the lines of research\nsuggested by Miss Jephson's card-guessing experiments in 1928,\nand 285 members of the group took part in the new series. The\ncards to be guessed were enclosed in light-j^roof envelopes, sealed\nin a particular way, the object being to reduce to the minimum the\nchance of percipients obtaining, even accidentally, normal know-\nledge of the cards they had to guess.\nThis series came to an end, so far as this country is concerned,\nin July 1929, but a further series is being conducted in the United\nStates, with the assistance of Professor Gardner Murphy, vv^ith a\ngroup of percipients drawn from the Boston S.P.R.\nProfessor Fliigel atr University College, London, and Professor\nMurphy at Columbia University, U.S.A., have also, at Miss Jeph-\nson's siiggestion, conducted experiments on similar lines with their\nstudents and have kindly placed the results at her disposal.\nThe work of tabulating and analysing the results of the English\nseries has been com]jleted, but in view of the further material to be\nreceived from America, it will be some time before a Report or\nReports on the entire series, telepathic and clairvoyant, can be\nexpected.\nColonel Maxwell Dick and Colonel Hayward have both very\nkindly acted as \" scrutineers \" during these experiments, and Dr\nR. A. Fisher, F.R.S., and Dr E. S. Pearson of University College,\n\fFkbbuarv, 11)30 Avmud Report of the Council for 19^9 21\nLondon, have been of the greatest help in meeting statistical\nproblems which have arisen from time to time. To these gentlemen\nand to Miss Carruthers, who has continued to help in classifying\nthe replies, the Coiuicil wish to express their warm thanks, as also\nto the large number of percipients all over the country who have\nmade the experiments possible. Although these experiments have\nnot achieved one of the results hoped for, namely the discovery of\npercipients possessing telepathic or clairvoyant powers in a marked\ndegree, those who have conducted them are satisfied that, if a\nwider view of the matter be taken, the work done has considerable\nvalue and justifies the large expenditure, both of time and also of\nmoney, which has been incurred.\nFurther Work consequent upon the Investigation of Mrs Warren\nElliott. As mentioned in previous Annual Reports the Society has.\nin consequence of the numerous sittings held with Mrs Warren\nElliott and other mediums, a large number of well-aimotated\nrecords of sittings with these mediums. Mr Saltmarsh. who ha ;\nanalysed the material for the Society, and has prepared a general\nreport on them (published in Proceedings, xxxix. 47-18 i). has been\nengaged on a further analysis of particular aspects of these records.\nThe Seance-Room. With a view to giving every opportunity to\nMembers and Associates to conduct investigations into physical\nphenomena, the Coimcil (as stated in the Journal for November\n1928) is prepared to lend the *Sea?ice-Room for investigations of this\nkind under suitable conditions. Only one application has so far\nbeen received for the use of the Seance-'Room. by private members,\nnamely, an application by Dr Crandon. Mr Theron Pierce and Mr\nBligh Bond for the loan of the Seance-Room, for part of December\n1929, for the purpose of holding sittings at which Mrs Crandon\n{Margery) would give a demonstration of some of her phenomena.\nThree sittings were accordingly held in December to which\nseveral members of the Society and others were invited by Dr\nCrandon, and under the conditions laid down by the Coimcil in\ngranting the application, the Hon. Research Officer was present at\nall three sittings, as an observer only.\nThe Council are prepared to give to other members equal facilities,\nbut only on the understanding that the Hon. Research Officer, or a\nrepresentative nominated by the Council, should l^e entitled to be\npresent at all the sittings, though as an observer only.\nInstitution of the Myers Memorial Lecture. During the year,\nlargely owing to the generosity of Mrs F. W. H. Myers and other\nmembers of the Myers family, and also of an anonymous donor, who\nhas on many other occasions helped in the Society's work, a Fund\nof over \u00a3800 has been raised for the purpose of endowing a lecture\nto be given periodically on any branch of psychical research, with\nb2\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research Feukuauy 1930\nspecial reference \" as far as may be to the work of F. W. H. Myers\nas contained in his Human Personality.'' It is also intended that\nthe Fund should from time to time be used for making grants for\nresearch work in connection with the lecture.\nThe Council have for some time past realised that one of the\nmost serious hindrances to the advancement of psychical research at\nthe present time is that what may be called the \" classics \" of\npsychical research, especially Phantasms of the Living, of which\nMyers was part author, and Human Personality, are neglected by\npersons whose interest in psychical research is recent, and who\nprefer as a basis for their studies more modern works, English and\nforeign, mostly of a standard very inferior to these two books.\nThe Council hope that the Lecture, by reminding the public of\nMyers's work, will do something to raise the level of reading in the\nliterature of psychical research and will also stimulate serious\nresearch work.\nThe President, Sir Lawrence J. Jones, has taken a leading part\nin raising this Fund and in formulating the scheme under which it\nis to be administered. A Trust Deed has been executed, and\nTrustees have been appointed to hold the Fimds. The Inaugural\nLecture under the Trust was delivered by Sir Oliver Lodge on the\n18th Octol^er. This lecture, with additional material, has been\npublished in book form.\nThe Library. During the past year the Library has steadily\ndeveloped with the assistance of the grant from the Carnegie United\nKingdom Trust, which has now run about half its course. The\nnumber of books and pamphlets now in the Library is over 6,400.\nThe number of Members using the Library has increased to 67, and\nthe number of volumes borrowed to 737. Members are reminded\nthat the Society is affiliated to the Central Library for Students and\nto the Association of Special Libraries. Through these organisa-\ntions the Society is able to obtain for its Members, free of cost,\ninformation and the loan of books on all subjects. The Society, in\nturn, undertakes to supply all rec|uired books and information on\npsychical research to its fellow-members of the Central Library and\nof the Association. This modern development in co-operative\nlibrarianship for the first time enables the individual to obtain\ninformation on any subject easily and quickly. Enquiries on this\nsubject should be addressed to the Librarian, S.P.R. During the\npast year 38 volumes have been borrowed from the Society through\nthe Central Library.\nThe Society was represented by Mr Besterman at the Conference\nof the Association of Special Libraries at Trinity College, Cambridge,\nin September, This proved a valuable opportunity for spreading\naccurate information about the Society and its work among special\n\ffebiuary 1930 Annual Report of the Council for 1929 23\nlibrarians from all parts of the country and from the Continent and\nAmerica. The opinion was expressed by one of the organisers of\nthis Conference that the Society's Library is the second best\norganised and most complete special library in the country.\nin June Mr Theodore Besterman who, as Honorary Librarian,\nreorganised the Library, was appointed Librarian and Editor. The\nCouncil again wish to extend their thanks to Mr Vinen for the\nA^aluable assistance he gave in the Library for about eighteen\nmonths.\nThe Editorship of the Journal. In June Mrs Salter, who had\nedited the Journal since 1916, for the greater part of that time in\nan honorary capacity, requested the Council to relieve her of this\nwork, on the ground that it left her no time for research of any\nkind, while at the same time expressing her willingness to continue\nto act as Hon. Editor of Proceedings. The Council accepted Mrs\nSalter's resignation with regret, and appointed Mr Besterman as\nEditor of the Journal.\nArticles of Association. Extraordinary General Meetings of the\nSociety were held on the 31st Jamiary and '20th. February 1929, at\nwhich new Articles of Association recommended by the Council\nwere adopted. The new Articles have been registered with the\nRegistrar of Joint Stock Companies, and are now in force. Copies\nmay be seen at the offices of the Society, and may be obtained by\nMembers at the price of one shilling.\nThe President for 1929. Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart., was re-\nelected President for the year 1929.\nChanges in the Council. During the year the Hon. Everard\nFeilding, who had been a Member of Council for thirty years,\nresigned owing to his inability during the last year or two to attend\nCouncil meetings. His resignation was accepted with great regret,\nand the Council expressed their appreciation of the services he had\nrendered the Society as a Council Member and in other capacities\nduring this long period. On his appointment as Librarian and\nEditor of the Journal Mr Besterman ceased in the ordinary course\nto be a member of Council.\nOhituar)]. The Council regret to record the deaths during the\npast year of two Corresponding Members of the Society, namely\nDr Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing and Dr Morton Prince. They\nalso regret to record the deaths of the following Members and\nAssociates, all of whom have been attached to the Society for a long\ntime or have shown an active interest in the Society's work : Mr\nEdwyn Barclay, Miss Katharine Barlow, Major W.

On the\nother hand, the Society lost, by death, resignations and other\ncauses, 59 Members, 2 Corresponding Members and 23 Associates.\nThe number of Members is at present 618 as against 624 last year ;\nthe number of Associates is 414 as against 437 last year. The total\nmembership is therefore 1,032 as against 1,061 last year. It is, of\ncourse, inevitable that the number of Associates should decline so\nlong as the rule of not electing new Associates is maintained.\nChange of Banl- Address. Members and Associates are par-\nticularly asked to note that the Society's Banking Account has\nbeen transferred from the Hanover Square Branch of the West-\nminster Bank to the new Tavistock Square Branch. W.C. 1, of the\nsame Bank, and to make any necessary adjustments in their\nBanking Orders.\nPublications. Four parts of Proceedings were published during-\nthe year : Part 110 in May. Part 111 in June, Part 112 in August,\nand Part 113 in December.\nThe total amount realised during the past year by the sales of\nProceedings is \u00a3144 2s. 2d. The sales to the general public for the\nyear July 1928-June 1929 amounted to \u00a360 8s. 5d. in Great Britain\nand to \u00a310 8s. 6d. in America. The sales in Great Britain for the\nperiod July-December 1929 amounted to \u00a342 18s. 6d. (owing to the\nwinding-up of our account with our agents, this extra half-year falls\ninto the accounts for 1929). All sales will in future be made direct\nfrom the Society's oifice. In each case the amounts shown are\narrived at after deduction of agents' percentages. The office sales,\nto Mem^bers, at half-price, amounted to \u00a330 6s. 9d.\nMeetings.

Another Case of Telepathy.\nMrs Henry Sidgwick writes :\nThe experience described below\u2014probably, I think, an instance\nof telepathy\u2014occurred to a niece of mine (not one of those con-\ncerned in the case L. 1291 printed in the November Journal, xxv.\n157-8). Its weak point evidentially, regarded as a case of telepathy,\nis that the quasi-hallucinatory impression was of an expected\nevent about which the percipient was feeling strongly. On the\nother hand, the reasons for thinking its source was supernormal are :\n'(1) that it seems to have occurred simultaneously with the actual\nevent, though about half an hour before the event was expected to\noccur ; (2) that so far as we can judge, it corresponded with the\nactual event in details which the percipient had no reason for\nanticipating.\nIn a covering letter my niece, Mrs R. Balfour, writes :\n\" Reddiff,\nWhittiiigJiame.\nNov. 8 1929.\n\" I have been tidying up, and came upon the enclosed paper,\nwhich I believe would interest you to read. I wrote it down very\nsoon after the event which it relates had occurred, and still remem-\nber it with extraordinary vividness. ... It is one of simply crowds\nof instances of an inter-connection between the minds of Ral [her\nhusband] and myself, which one would call telepathy of a sort ;\nonly it is an especially detailed instance.\"\nThe paper referred to is as follows :\n\" Friday \\Wi May 1927.\n\" Entry in my engagement book at above date : Porgies no\nmore.

Tom\nMcDonald the keeper, had dug a grave near Clartyside and promised\nto bury him. Ral had arranged to take the vet. and Porgies to the\n^^orth Lodge at the time, where the deed was to be done.\n\" The last few days were grim : we did all the things he liked\nbest, but he looked so searchingly at us, which made it so much\nworse.\n\" On the morning of the day, we were expecting the vet. to arrive\nat Redcliff at 10.30. At 10 minutes to ten o'clock I went into the\nnursery, and saw Nannie and Gerald, as was my usual custom. I\nwas sure that Ral woxdd come and find me there, if he wanted me,\nAvhen the vet. came, and if there was any suitable opportunity of\nsaying goodbye to Porgies when no one was about.\n\" I stood before the fireplace facing the clock and I had a sense\nof dreary fore-boding, which was so strong that as 1 stood there\nI began to feel rather strange and giddy. I talked to Nannie about\nvarioiis things with my back to her ; and then, all at once 1 Imew\nthat it was happening. I knew that Porgies was dying. I had a\nmost vivid consciousness of Ral's mind : I seemed to be beside\nhim or inside him, seeing what he saw : and Porge was looking at\nme with eyes full of alarm and distress. I heard a series of short\nsharp barks like cries, which died away, and I seemed to go through\nan extremity of pain and sorrow, while Porgies's eyes, unreproachful\nand still gentle, but fast dying, gazed at me with awful distinctness,\nuntil they receded away, and I saw again the face of the clock\nbefore which I stood, and which pointed to 10.5 a.m. I was amazed\nat the control which I still had over myself and my voice, for I\nanswered something which Nannie had said. When I looked at\nher, I saw that her eyes were full of tears, and she suddenly ex-\nclaimed :\n'\nOh, I can't bear Porge going ; he's so lovely.'\n\" I felt rather faint and went awa}^. I went into the little dining\nroom, saying to myself :\n'\nBut he carit be dead yet ! The vet. was\nnot to come till 10.30.' But I could not find Ral anywhere or\nPorgies.\n\" About 25 minutes past ten, he came in, and the moment I saw\nhim I knew all that he had been through. We went out into the\ngarden, and then Ral said :\n'\nIt took longer than I thought it\nwould ; but I don't honestly believe that he felt more than a very\nlittle.'\n\" He explained that the vet., being unable to come himself, had\nsent his assistant, who had arrived at about ten minutes to ten ;\nthey had then gone along to the North Lodge where everything was\nhastily prepared and accomplished.\n\" I said, '\nT thought he would have just died without a sound.\n\fFebruary 1930 Case 31\nbut I heard many little cries.' And I told Ral all that I had felt\nand heard and seen. Ral said, '\nI don't think he was in pain, only\nalarmed at what was coming over him and trying to get breath.\nHe also tried to come towards me, but fell down : and though his\neyes were still open gazing at me, I saw life go out of them straight\naway.' \" So far the nearly contemporary record.\nIn answer to enquiries Mrs Balfour writes, January 1930 : \"I\nshould like to add that I am not aware of ever having had an\nexperience resembling this one. I do not know how far it would be\njustified in being called an hallucination of the senses, because the\nwhole impression seemed to me to take place inside me. Although\nthe face of the clock seemed temporarily to be removed, I do not\nbelieve that the vision I had of Porgies's eyes, which appeared like\nin a long perspective, was seen with my ordinary external eyes at\nall : and if I had heard the little barks with the sense which one\nusually calls hearing, I think I should have wondered whether\nNannie had heard it too. I never wondered that : I always knew\nthat of course she hadn't heard it. My theory was the moment\nafter the event had occurred, and is at the present time, that I had\nbeen somehow inside\u2014or in touch with \u2014Ral's mind, seeing what\nhe saw, and hearing what he heard. That is the sort of feeling which\nI tried to express when I said that ' I had a most vivid consciousness\nof Ral's mind.'\n\"I do not think that I can have unconsciously heard the noise\nof the vet.'s assistant's arrival : the nursery was a long way from\nthe back door, and faced into the garden, far away from either front\nor back door : and the whole house was full of movement, for the\nmaids were cleaning away breakfast in the pantry, and making the\nbeds upstairs.\n\" Ral could not at first remember, when I asked him. whether\nthe vet.'s assistant had come to the backyard of Redclifi, or whether\nhe had come to the North Lodge, and sent Tom McDonald, the\nkeeper, along to Redcliff to intimate his arrival : but on second\nthoughts, Ral says that he believes he must have come straight to\nRedcliff ; that the maid came and said he was outside ; that when\nhe went out to him, he asked for a piece of string which he said\nwould be necessary in order to tie up Porgies's mouth, which Ral\nhad to go indoors again to get. There is no doubt that he came in a\nmotor car.\n\" Ral believes (though he does not clearly remember anything)\nthat they all three \\_i.e. Ral, the vet, and Porge] then got into the\nmotor car and went to the North Lodge [about ten minutes' walk\nfrom Redcliff]. It took a few minutes to prepare the injection\nneedle.\n\" Porgies was a Great Dane, and was loved by all who knew him.\nJean Balfour.\"\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Febuiahy 1930\nOur final document is ]\\lr R.

Price M.10.80.\nThis work of Dr Moll's is a regular indictment of the \" occultists,\"'\n-a term which in Germany seems to be the exact equivalent of the\nFrench \" metapsychistes.\" I do not think it corresponds equally\nwell to the English psychical researcher,\" for one may be a\npsychical researcher without believing in the operation in this\ndomain of forces hitherto unrecognised by science. Whilst the\nterms \" metapsychiste \" and \" Okkultist \" seem to imply the\nexistence of such a belief.\nIn this indictment the late Dr von Schrenck-Notzing occupies a\nprominent place, a circumstance of some delicacy in view of the\nGerman researcher's regretted death. This circumstance does not,\nliowever, prevent Dr Moll from attacking him severely throughout\nhis book ; in the Preface he says that he has struck out of his work\nsome peculiarly pungent criticisms, but he adds : \"A man who\nlooked upon carnival farces as science, who wanted to impose upon\nthe world the carnival mummeries of hvsterical women and other\nmediums as transfigurations, teleplasma or products of the sub-\nconscious, must be pictured according to truth, even after death.\"\nWith which obserA^ation it is difficult for me not to agree sub-\n.stantially, though I am not sure that in two or three places the\nwriter has not transgressed the limits he had set himself in this\nrespect (e.g. when alluding to the Baroness von Schrenok-Notzing's\nbig fortune.)\nAs for the facts Dr Moll brings forward to support his contention,\nthey seem to me to be of somewhat uneven interest and importance.\nA good many are, indeed, of some consequence : such is, for in-\n. stance, the circumstance that in his book on materialisation pheno-\nmena Dr von Schrenck-Notzing did not say one word as to Eva C.'s\nidentity with Marthe Beraud, Professor Richet's and his own sitt-\nings with whom had been violently criticised. The fact that he\nagain and again asserted his belief in their geiiuinencss has nothing\nto do with the matter : whether he be right or wrong, a researcher\n\fFebbuaby 1930 Reviews\nwriting on the same medium several years afterwards was in duty\nboimd to mention the previous sittings.\nIt certainly seems, judging by what Dr Moll says, that our late\nCorresponding Member did not always manifest a truly scientific\nspirit in the domain of psychical research. This, however, must not\nmake us forgetful of the services rendered by him in the same\nsphere. Those services, so far as hypnotism and its official recogni-\ntion in Germany are concerned, Dr Moll freely recognises.\nI will content myself now with a few cursory remarks. On p. 8f\nDr Moll blames \" occultists \" when they speak of their adversaries\nas materialists and at the same time attempt to explain telepathy\nthrough brain-waves. I think that his criticism is justified, and\nthat he is right when he says that such a conception is itself pure\nmaterialism, a materialism which is not in the least supported by\nactual facts : for as yet by no artificial process, be it through\n\" waves \" or through electricity, or through some mechanism, has\nit been possible to start in the brain a psychical process. To have\nrecourse to the brain-wave theory to explain telepathy and to use\nit at the same time against materialism betrays, Dr Moll says, the\ngreatest Gedanken losigkeit\n.\nOn p. 88 the writer quotes Herr Erich Becher as saying : Un-\nfortunately no sittings [with Willi Schneider] could be arranged\nwithout Baron Schrenck and the occultists who stood near him\nbeing present.\" Confidence in such and such a person is subjective,\nsays Dr Moll. And he adds that he has invariably declined to\nbelieve in any experimenter. For one may well imagine a combina-\ntion of circumstances when deception on the experimenter's part\nmight be inspired by lofty motives. Let us suppose that A is con-\nvinced of the \" occult \" faculties of a medium and wants to con-\nvince others, possibly to bring them to what he thinks a loftier\nWeltanschauung. If in the present instance the medium's powers\nfail him. might not the experimenter use a subterfuge to prove his\ngenuineness ? Of course, such a conclusion if pushed to extremity\nwill lead us into the dreary land of infinite doubt. Let us therefore\ncontent ourselves with formulating the following canon of evidence :\nBelief in the genuineness of a prolonged series of experiments should\nbe made to depend as little as possible on belief in the bona fides of\none and the same experimenter.\n' Among the persons taking part in sittings,\" says Dr Moll (p.\n90), there is a particular group which deserves special distrust :\nthe medium's friend and protector,\"\" this with special reference to\nMme Bisson. Whatever be thought with regard to this particular\ncase. I think we are entitled d ce propos to formulate another canon\nof evidence : such protectors or frien.ds should be subjected to as\nsevere a control as the medium. To refuse admittance to such sus-\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research Fkbuiauy lyso\npicioiis doublures altogether might be a mistaken procedure, for it\nis conceivable, speaking theoretically, that to obtain \" phenomena\n\"\nwe must have a combination of the hypothetical powers inherent\nin both A and B.\nOn p. 94: Dr Moll says the indignation felt by \" occultists \" as\nwell as by \" anti-occultists \" against swindling mediums is often\nquite unjustified. In most cases, he thinks, the medium looks upon\nthe whole thing as a practical joke, and a fraudulent medium must\nbe looked upon from an ethical, and in many cases also from a\nlegal standpoint, in an altogether different light from that in which\nwe are boimd to view an investigator who deceives. That the latter\nis infinitely more to l)e blamed than the former, I quite agree ; but\nthe interesting point seems to me this : though I personally dislike\nvery much deception and insincerity I do not remember having\never felt against a medium Avhom I strongly suspected of fraud the\nsame indignation which I should have felt against an ordinary\ndeceiver. Nor is this experience probably unicpie. What is the\nexplanation ?\nWhen discussing conditions generally prevailing at sittings, the\nauthor says that even starting from the \" occult \" standpoint one\ncannot well imagine why the \" phenomena \" shoidd develop better\nif the sitters converse on some indifferent topic (p. 103). We should\nrather have expected just the reverse. I am not sure this argument,\nif taken alone, is very cogent. On the other hand, such a condition\n\u2022certainly favours fraud, and when it is taken in conjunction with\nother supposed conditions (which Dr Moll enumerates) the whole\ncertainly tends to suggest fraud as origin of the supposed pheno-\nmena. One thing is certain : in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred\nthe conditions which facilitate \" phenomena \" also facilitate\ntrickery. This maij be a chance coincidence, but if so it is a singularly\nunfortunate one.\nVery much to the point is the statement on page 108 that some\n' occultists \" or \" parapsychologists \" who pose as something better\nthan the common spiritualist and who pretend to \" enrich science,\"\nwhilst attributing to the spiritualist blind faith only, behave in\nconcrete cases exactly like the latter. As I am writing this I am\nthinking of a \" metapsychist who will never call a \" spirit \" a\n\" spirit.'' bivt an \" entity \" : well, the credulity of this very respect-\nable gentleman is nevertheless gigantic.\nDr Moll concludes with very severe words about the \" occultists\n\"\nto whom he attributes a paranoid mentality. \" See who these\nresearchers are, with Avhat methods they work, how they always\ninstinctively fear a collapse (Z'usammenbntch), and therefore try to\nhold at a distance their adversaries. ...\" This comparison with\nthe paranoid individual occurs in the book more than once, Dr Moll\n\fFkbuuary 1930 Reviews 35\nthinking the similarity very striking. Is he certain that we do not\nmeet with the same more or less morbid phenomenon in other\ndomains I I think it is pretty snre to be found whenever we meet\nwith fanaticism, which I will attempt to define : An excessive\nardour of conviction coupled with intolerance.\nBefore I finish this review of a small but instructive and interest-\ning book, I will add a consideration which I have not found in Dr\nMoll's pages, which may not have fallen into the scope of his work\nbut which seems to me to deserve attention. It is this : even\nsupposing all the phenomena which psychical research investigates\nto be genuine (which is admitting a good deal, not to say far too\nmuch), these phenomena fall far short of the marvels with which\nscience confronts us at every step. Admitting that clairvoyance\nexists, it reveals to us the contents of closed letters and boxes far\nless effectively than the X-rays. There is some evidence for the\nreality of thought-transference ; but the most ardent believer in\ntelepathy will concede that wireless telegraphy and telephony\noperate far more successfully. D. D. Home and the Schneider\nbrothers are asserted to have been occasionally \" levitated.\" but\nthe performances of our aviators are certainly infinitely more\nimpressive. Official science presents us with occurrences, everyday\noccurrences, taking place under unimpeachable conditions and far\nmore striking than the alleged supernormal ones. Science gratifies\nthe instinctive craving for the marvellous inherent in many of us\nto an extent undreamed of by miracle-mongers past and present.\nWhich consideration will perhaps appear to them to deprive alleged\n\" occult \" or \" metapsychical \" manifestations of a good deal of\ntheir interest.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nWilliam Brown, Science and Personalitij.

Dr Brown is well\nJinown as an expert mathematician, and Sir Oliver Lodge, in his\nforeword assiires us that the chapter on the physical sciences is\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Februahy v.m\nan admirable summary of the present-day position.\" Biological\nscience is dealt with more brietiy\u2014except in so far as psychology\nmay be regarded as a department of biology. Dr Brown leans\ntowards the modern doctrine of \" emergence,\" but considers it\nirrational unless we also believe in some background that does not\nchange, something beyond time, the Eternal or the Absolute.\nAfter these preliminary discussions, the main part of the book is\ndevoted to certain problems of psychology, on the solution of which\nour conception of personality depends. The more strictly psycho-\nlogical part of the work opens M'ith the important paper on \" Mental\nUnity and Mental Dissociation \" which formed Dr Brown's Presi-\ndential Address to the Section of Psychology of the British Associa-\ntion at the Leeds Meeting in 1927. He here lays stress on his view\n\" that dissociation is just as normal and necessary as association.\"\nIn this chapter he also makes reference to the problem of survival,\nand expresses his belief that although the unitary personality\n\" carries with it, as a physical correlate, a unitary working of the\nbrain and of other parts of the body, this does not necessarily\ninvolve complete dependence upon the latter for its continued\nexistence.\"\nDr Brown's views on psychical research are expounded more\nfully towards the end of the book, where he devotes two chapters\nto this topic and gives in an appendix a verbatim record of one of\nhis sittings with Mrs Osborne Leonard. Great openness of mind is\nshown by Dr Brown in the matter of possible interpretations of\ntelepathic and clairvoyant phenomena. Sometimes, indeed, he lays\nhimself open to a charge of over-credulity when he is considering\nthe results of his own experiments with shell-shocked soldiers in\nFrance. Yet, curiously enough, in presenting these cases of appar-\nently supernormal phenomena occurring in patients who were\n\" certainly pathological,\" Dr Brown is afraid of giving the impression\nthat he is quoting them against psychical research. This fear is due\nto the prevalence of a belief that if it can be shown that a mediiim\nsuffers from some degree of mental abnormality, \" the messages\nthat they piirport to receive are thereby rendered more doubtful.\"\nThere are no grounds whatsoever for such a belief, but Dr Brown\nhardly refers to the misunderstandings on which it is based. He is\ncontent with the mild declaration that \" if you say that because of\nthis the results obtained are certain to be mere figments, you will\nbe going farther than I am able to go.\"\nWe are told in the author's preface that the chapters on psychical\nresearch Avere included in this volume \" only after much hesitation.\"\nDr Brown's hesitation may be readily understood, and we con-\ngratulate him on his courage in overcoming it ; but the need to\napologise for making use of the data of psychical research in science\n\fFebruary 1930 Reviews 37\nor in philosophy is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. \" Philo-\nsophy without science is empty, science without philosophy is\nblind,\" says Dr Brown ; he might have added that a study of\npersonality without consideration of the evidence supplied by\npsychical research would be, at least, incomplete.\nT.

The York Printing Co., York, Pa., 1929.\nIn this book Miss Tubby describes the results obtained at sittings\nwith a large number of English and American \" psychics.\" At\nmany of these sittings communications were received purporting to\ncome from James H. Hyslop, founder of the American S.P.E., with\nwhom Miss Tubby had been long associated as a fellow-worker.\nI ^ The feature of the evidence upon which Miss Tubby lays most\nstress is that several of these \" psychics \" gave her in connection\nwith a communicator identified as Hyslop the letter X, which she\ninterprets as Hyslop's \" sign.\" It should be observed that this sign\nwas not chosen by Hyslop in his lifetime, but was given posthum-\nously at a sitting taken by Miss Tubby with Mrs Chenoweth in\nAugust 1920. Miss Tubby'herself notes (p. 119) that the sign has\n\" many pertinent significations,\" is \" easily made, often used,\nfamiliar to everyone, apparently trivial, or even an accidental\nerror.\" She therefore considers it a fortunate choice, because it\ncan be so easily given. Those who are sceptically inclined may feel\nthat this characteristic cuts both ways. But to whatever con-\nclusions the evidence may lead, many of Dr Hyslop's friends and\nadmirers will welcome the opportunity to study these records,\nwhich are quoted in full and carefully annotated.\nThere are also records of comniimications of the usual type from\nother friends and relatives of Miss Tubby's.\nH.

As Gurney showed in his far too little-known\naccount of witchcraft in Phaatasins of ihc Living, the widespread\noccurrence of supernormal phenomena resolves itself on analysis of\nsuch a book as this into stories requoted over and over again, and\nvery often based on accounts which were never better than second\nor third hand.\nTo the reprint Miss Yardley has added a valuable sm'Vey of the\nCatholic position in the ghost controversy of the sixteenth century.\nTh.

[This periodical\nhas now discontinued publication.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nA further instalment of Dr Mattiesen's paper on cross-correspond-\nences concludes with the expression of the writer's belief that the\n\" animistic \" theory {i.e. that which postulates action of living\nminds, with special reference to Mrs Verrall's supposed role in\noriginating the cross-correspondences) is inadequate as an explana-\ntion. Dr Mattiesen was next to have discussed the spirit-hypothesis.\nFrau Maria Silbert's phenomena at Graz are the subject of a\npaper (first instalment) by Prof. Kasnacich. It is repeatedly\nasserted that the touches under the table could not have been pro-\nduced by Frau Silbert's feet : a statement the accuracy of which\nmay well be doubted in view of such observations as Dr W. F.\nPrince's and Mr Besterman's. By the way, the writer notes in\npassing that to him the \" concretely impossible \" {real Unmdgliches)\ndoes not exist : he believes in the ''\nlogically impossible \" alone.\nSome of my readers may be surprised to hear that I incline to some\nextent to adhere to such a position ; I will add, however, that\nbecause such and such a phenomenon is theoretically quite possible,\nit does by no means follow that it does exist.\nDr Christoph Schroder discusses \" metaplastic phenomena,\"\nabundantly borrowing from the works of Dr von Schrenck-Notzing\nand Dr. G.

Of this circumstance Dr Schroder (as was\nto be expected) takes no notice.\nThe last-named gentleman prints an interesting account by an\nengineer-in-chief named G., describing mysterious raps occurring\non the eve of the funeral of a lady well known to the writer. These\nraps are said to have accurately reproduced the rhythm of a Vienna\nwaltz indissolubly bound up in Herr G.'s memory with the very\nbeginning of this friendship. All this may be put down, of course, as\na subjective hallucination (the death was known to Herr G., and\nno one else was present), but still is to some extent impressive.\nRevue MetapsycJiique, November-December 1929.\nThis number opens with a very long paper by Dr Osty on\n\" The Diagnosis of Diseases by Subjects endowed with Paranormal\nKnowledge.\" It being a first instalment, we propose to return to\nthis important contribution later on.\nThe same writer discusses the case of Theresa Neumann of\nKonnersreuth d jmpos of a French translation recently published\nof a book {Konnersreuth d la lumiere de la science medicale et psycho-\nlogique) by Dr Hynek, a Czech physician. Dr Osty objects to the\nstrictly Roman Catholic position of this author ; as for the facts\nthemselves, the fasting in particular, he admits that the explanation\nby fraud comes first to the mind. He thinks, however, that to\nadhere to it,\n\" immobilising oneself therefore in indifference\n\"\nwould be \" behaving like a weak-minded man.\" The biological\nproblem in question is of so much importance, he says, that it\nwould be disastrous \" if scientific prejudices, transitory beliefs,\" did\nnot utilise this \" exceptional \" case, \" should it be what numerous\nwitnesses assert it to be.\"\nA short note on Scopochloralose by M. Pascal follows. In the\nChronique by M. Maire much space is devoted to the Valiantine\nsittings in Berlin and to the Lambert criticisms of the Millesimo\nsittings, and to Signer Bozzano's vehement rejoinder. On behalf\napparently of the Institut Metapsychique, M. Maire suggests that\nValiantine should come and give sittings at the Institut, the only\ncondition laid down being that a representative of the latter be\npresent, who will simply \" register \" {constater) the phenomena\nrecorded by his senses, without interpreting their nature and their\norigin.

He was 74 years of age at the time of his death and had been\na Member of the Society for forty years. He was one of the original\nMembers of the American S.P.R. which was formed in 1884 and\nhe joined our Society in 1889, when the (first) American S.P.R.\nceased to exist as an independent body. He was elected a Corres-\nponding Member in 1911 and continued as such till his death.\nDuring the first few years of his professional life Dr Prince devoted\nhimself to diseases of the nose and throat, b\\it he soon turned to\nneurology and in 1895 was appointed instructor in neurology at\nthe Harvard Medical School. From 1902 to 1912 he was Professor of\nNervous Diseases at the Tufts College Medical School. In 1910 he\ndelivered a series of lectures on abnormal psychology at the Univer-\nsity of California. In 1906 he founded the Journal of Abnormal\nPsychology, to which, in the followiDg years, he contributed many\nmiportant papers. In this year, also, he published his best known\nboolc The Dissociation of a Personality, the record of the famous\nBeauchamp Case.\nIn 1898 Dr Prince contributed .to our Proceedings (xiv. 79-97) a\npaper on hysteria and hypnosis, and in the same year his \" Experi-\nmental Study of Visions \" was read at a meeting of the Society and\nsubsequently commented upon by Mr Myers in Proceedings (xiv.\n366-372). At the International Congress of Psychology held in\nParis in August 1900 Dr Prince read a paper on the problem of\nmultiple personality, which was published in Proceedings (xv.\n466-483), under the title of \" The Development and Genealogy of\nthe Misses Beauchamp : a Preliminary Report of a Case of Multiple\nPersonality.\" This was the earliest detailed account of the Beau-\nchamp Case, the full record of which appeared five years later in\nThe Dissociation of a Personality.\nAlthough as these facts indicate Dr Prince had a life-long interest\nin psychical research, we may gather from his writings that he\nbelonged to the extreme right wing of the society. He was unwilling\nto admit the supernormal character of any of the phenomena which\nhe regarded as genuine, and believed that they could all be explained\nin terms of abnormal psychology. He held a theory of the relation\nof consciousness to the physiological processes of the body which\ncompelled him to deny the possibility of survival \" of consciousness\nas we empirically know it.\" \" Whether there is any other kind of\nsurvival, a survival of some entity of which we have no experience,\na soul as distinct from the mind, that is,\" he says, \"something\n\fMarch 1930 Obituaries 43\nbeyond the province of science, something about whicb science can\nhave no opinion whatever.\"\nMorton Prince was known to his friends as a man of wide attain-\nments and many interests. Broadminded in his attitude towards\nthe opinions of others, he was nevertheless always keen to defend\nhis own points of view. More especially on questions connected with\nthe subject which he had made peculiarly his own\u2014abnormal\npsychology\u2014he held strong convictions, but he was always fair and\neven generous in his appreciation of the work and opinions of those\nwho differed from him. It is as a pioneer in the field of abnormal\npsychology that he will be longest remembered ;\nand although the\nmethods of investigation employed by him and the conclusions at\nwhich he arrived have been largely superseded by the methods and\ninterpretations of the analytical schools, students of psychopathology\nmust, for many years to come, refer to his writings if they would\nunderstand all the possibilities of dissociated mental functioning.\nSo, also, students of psychical research cannot escape the implica-\ntions of his work when they try to appraise the nature of the\nphenomena exhibited in trance and cognate states.\nT. W. Mitchell.\nDr Abraham Wallace.\nWe regret to record the death, at an advanced age, of Dr Abraham\nWallace, whose membership of the Society dates back to 1894 and\nwho was a Member of Council from 1895 to 1901, having been\nproposed for co-optation by Mr F. W. H. Myers.\nThroughout his membership Dr Wallace took a keen interest in\nthe Society's work, investigating cases for the Society and co-\noperating in research with other Members of Council, e.g. with Mr\nBaggally in the investigation of Charles Bailey, the Australian\napport medium.\nDr Wallace was, especially in his later years, a convinced spirit-\nualist, but he always retained a strong sense of the necessity for\nexercising critical judgment.\nf\nA SITTING WITH MME KAHL.\nBy I. C. Grondahl.\n[In response to my request Mr Grondahl, a Member of the Society\nwho has had much experience with mediums, has written and consented\nto the publication of the following account. The reader will find it\nuseful to compare the phenomena he describes with similar accounts in\nProceedings, xxxviii. 413-433. Ed.]\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1930 ,\nj\nAccording to my diary it was on Tuesday, 2nd July 1929, just (\nafter noon, that Capt. Jolin Martin of 22 Rue St Jacques, Rouen, ,\n(my maternal uncle) and I called at her hotel in Paris, to asJi: for an\ninterview with Mme Kahl-Toukholka. We were fortunate enough ,\nto meet her husband, M. Toukholka, in the hall of the hotel, and he\nkindly arranged for an interview while we waited a quarter of an\nhour's time. When in Mme Kahl's room we sat, Capt. Martin and\nI side by side, opposite us the clairvoyante, and at a longer distance,,\nbehind her and to the side, M. Toukholka.\nI must remark that we took no notes during the half hour's\ninterview, the few experiments being neat and easy to remember.\nAlso that Mme Kahl produced a pack of cards, but that, being\nunacquainted with the uses of playing cards, I paid no attention to\nwhat was said and done in this connection. I limit myself to the\ndescription of the following four experiments, in which we both\nobserved as carefully as possible.\n1 . We were asked to think of the name of a female relation of one\nof us, write the initial letter on a piece of paper and fold it well up.\nWhen I had done this (screening the paper well and \" composing\n\"\nthe initial in sections) and was holding the folded paper in my closed\nhand, and Mme Kahl grasping my closed hand with hers,\u2014there\nappeared on the inside of her right forearm the figure g (about 2\ninches by |- inch) in a thin red line. It faded away in less than a\nminute. The letter drawn was S (for Sophie, Capt. Martin's late\nmother-in-law).\n2. Asked to write my own first name, there came out in the same\nway longitudinally above Mme Kahl's right WTist a narrow straight \\\nred line, a couple of inches long. My initial is I. j\n3. Asked to write in the same way the name of a female relative\nI wrote that of my only sister. Mme Kahl, after holding for a few\nseconds my closed hand with the folded paper inside it, wrote i\n\" Birgt.\" I had \" drawn \" Birgit. |\n4. I was asked to write the name of my mother (whom she\n'\nmistakenly believed to be alive). Mme Kahl took the much folded\npaper with a pair of pinchers, burnt it over a match flame and\nrubbed the ashes into small fragments. After gazing at the ashes,\nshe dropped a finger ring into a glass of water and gazed into that.\nNo result. Mme Kahl declared herself to be \" fatiguee,\" and her\nhusband explained that it would be no use trying to continue. At\nthis juncture I divulged the fact that my mother was also Capt.\nMartin's sister, whereupon she, taking one of our hands in each of\nhers and looking alternately into our eyes, spelt out deliberately\nI-n-g-a and repeated the name Inga,\u2014which was the right one.\nWhen in the afternoon I saw Dr Osty at the Institut Meta-\npsychique he declared the sitting to have been a good one and\n\fMarch 1930 A Sitting with Mine Kahl 45\nconfirmed my diaracterization of the clairvoyante as \" une grande\nenfant.\"\nIn this account I describe only the successes ; the failures were\nabout twice as many.\nr SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE'S RESIGNATION.\nFor the purpose of record we reprint below certain documents\nwhich have already been circulated to our Members and Associates,\nnamely : I. A circular from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle dated January\n1930 ; II. A reply to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's circular by the\nPresident and the Hon. Secretaries ;\nIII. A reply by Mr Besterman\nto Sir Arthur's circular so far as it concerned Mr Besterman's\nreview of Modern Psychic Mijsteries.\nAlthough the Council regard this particular controversy as a very\ntrivial m^atter, it is conceivable that at some future date our members\nmay wish to know exactly what occurred, and for that purpose we\nfeel justified in reprinting these three documents.\nWe are glad to report that very few of our members have adopted\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's advice to resign from the Society. The\ntotal of resignations in which his circular or Mr Besterman's review\nis mentioned is two to date (27 February) ;\nand the total of all\nresignations since his circular is six.\nOn the other hand, the Council have received several letters\ndisapproving of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's circular or expressing\nconfidence in the way in which the Society's afiairs are conducted.\nAmong the members who have written in this way may be mentioned\n:\nMr F. C. Constable, Miss Dallas, Mr Stanley De Brath, General Sir\nReginald Hart, V.C., and Dr Osty, to whom the Council wish to\nexpress their thanks.\nI. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Circular.\nDear Sir (or Madam),\nI had occasion recently [on the 22nd of January 1930. Ed.\\\nto send the following letter to the Chairman of the Council of the\nS.P.R. :\u2014\nDear Sir, . i. t ?\n\" I have just read an article in the January number of the Journal,\nby Mr Besterman upon the Millesimo sittings. It is, in my judgment,\nsuch a series of misrepresentations and insulting innuendoes that it\ntends to lower the good name of the Society. The insolence by which\nthe considered opinion of a man like Professor Bozzano, who was\npresent, is set aside and treated with contempt by one who was not\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1930\npresent, and who has had very little experience of psychical research,\nmakes one ashamed that such stuff should be issued by an official\nof a Society which has any scientific standing.\nTo appreciate the full absurdity, as well as the gratuitous offen-\nsiveness of Mr Besterman's alternative theory of fraud, one has to\nvisualise what it exactly implies. It means that an Italian nobleman\nof old family, a member of the legislative body, has invited a circle\nof friends to his home in order to practice a succession of complicated\nfrauds upon them. That he is himself implicated is shown by the\nfact that levitation of his own body and other personal phenomena\nare among those most clearly recorded. Having assembled his\nguests he causes the voices of his own dead relatives and others to\nbe sounded in the room. A lady confederate conceals under the\nshort modern skirt a long medieval rapier, a matador's sword, a big\ndoll and other objects quite unseen by a critical company. She or\nsome other confederate produces a large balloon-like object which\nhovers above the company, and in some unspecified way produces\nblasts of ice-cold air. All these and many other wonders are broiight\noff so successfully that in a succession of sittings the company,\nincluding Professor Bozzauo, are completely deceived, and the latter\nstakes his scientific reputation upon the truth of the phenomena.\nThis is the picture which Mr Besterman's theory of fraud would\ncompel us to accept, the whole being done with no conceivable object.\nCan we dignify such nonsense as this by the name of Psychical\nKesearch, or is it not the limit of puerile perversity ?\n\" A further example of prejudice is to be foimd in the allusions on\npage f5 of the same Journal to the real psychic researcher, Mr\nDennis Bradley, and to George Valiantine in Berlin. The assertions\nof the opponents of Spiritualism are at once accepted on their face\nvalue without the slightest attempt at discriminate examination.\n\" I have long waited hoping that the Podmore, Dingwall, Bester-\nman tradition of obtuse negation at any cost would die away. But\nas there is no sign of it, and the obsession seems rather to become\nmore pronoimced, my only resource is, after thirty-six years of\npatience, to resign my own membership and to make some sort of\npublic protest against the essentially unscientific and biassed work\nof a Society which has for a whole generation produced no con-\nstructive work of any kind, but has confined its energies to the\nmisrepresentation and hindrance of those who have really worked\nat the most important problem ever presented to mankind.\nYours faithfully,\nArthur Conan Doyle.\"\nThose of us who are conscious of the extreme importance of the\nmovement called \" Spiritualism.\" or even those who are desirous\n\fMarch 1930 Sir Arthur Concm Doyle's Resignation 47\nto see fair play in the matter, must be aware of the way in which\nthe Society, originally intended to be a sympathetic and fair centre\nfor inquiry, seems to have become simply an anti-spiritualist\norganisation. Everything which tends to prove the truth of that\ncult, no matter how honourable or sane the source may be, is assailed\nby suppression, misrepresentation and every sort of unreasonable\nand vicious opposition.\nFor a generation, since the death of Myers and the end of the\nPiper sittings, the Society has done no constructive work of any\nimportance, and has employed its energies in hindering and belittling\nthose who are engaged in real active psychical research. This latest\narticle of Mr Besterman may be insignificant in itself, but it is a link in\nthat long chain of prejudice which comes down from Mr Podmore, Mrs\nSedgwick [stc], and Mr Dingwall, to the present day. It is necessary,\nas it seems to me, to call a halt, and to make inquiry as to how far\nthe Society is to be for ever in the hands of this small central body\nof reactionaries, or whether they really represent the opinion of the\nmembers. It is not desirable that the Society should lose its inde-\npendence or become a Spiritualistic body, but it is most essential\nthat it shall not treat what so many regard as a matter of supreme\nimportance with the irresponsibility and levity which have been\nshown hitherto, where it has been the custom again and again for\na commentator to jeer at phenomena which he has not witnessed,\nin the face of the most cogent evidence of their having actually\noccurred.\nI would ask those who would wish to appreciate what I say to\nread Mr Besterman's article in the January Journal, and then Pro-\nfessor Bozzano's measured and dignified preface to Mrs Hack's\n\" Modern Psychic Mysteries \" (Rider), which treats of these sittings.\nThis matter is of more importance than would at fijst sight appear,\nfor I say deliberately that these Millesimo sittings are on the very\nhighest possible level of psychical research, both from the point of\nview of accurate reporting, variety of phenomena, and purity of\nmediumship. Therefore, if they can be laughed out of court anything\nwe can produce will be treated with similar contempt. I can hardly\nbelieve, as I read Mr Besterman's criticism, that he has actually\nread the book. It bristles with errors of fact. He complains that\nwe are not told where the sword was apported from.

Yet this slovenly\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1930\ncritic takes advantage of liis official position in order to warn the\nreading public of tlie S.P.R. away from this most important book.\nI have waited long in the hope of some reform but I have now\nconcluded that it is not to be expected, and that the influence of\nthe Society is entirely for evil. I have, therefore, resigned my\nmembership, and the protest would be more effective if those who\nagree with me would see their way to follow my example. It need\nnot hamper their psychic studies. \" In the British College of Psychic\nScience, 15, Queen's Gate, W., they will find an Institution where\nthey can participate themselves in real positive psychical research,\nwith mediums at hand to be tested, a good library, an excellent\nquarterly magazine, and an atmosphere which is progressive and\nnot stagnant.\nI write this under a strong sense of duty, for I am now one of the\noldest members of the S.P.R. I am convinced, however, that they\nhave long been not a help but a hindrance to the psychical knowledge\nof the world, and that a strong protest is called for.\nI may add that, having uttered such a protest, I cannot undertake\nto enter upon prolonged argument or correspondence, nor can I\nattend meetings, as my health hardly permits me to leave the house.\nYours faithfully,\nArthur Conan Doyle,\nM.D. (Edin.), LL.D.\nJanuary 1930.\nI would remind members of the words of that great pioneer Sir\nWilliam Barrett: \"A scepticism which is too lofty to see' the\nexistence of a mass of evidence under its very eyes is anything but\nhealthy. It calls for medical attention.\"\nII. Reply by the President and Hon. Secretaries.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle has been a member of our Society for very\nmany years ;\nhe is an author many of whose writings have given\ngreat pleasure to all of us ; and he is now, most regrettably, ill On\nall three grounds the Officers of the Society would have wished to\navoid entering into controversy with him, but the circular he has\nrecently addressed to our members, inviting them to follow his\nexample in resigning from the Society, calls for an early reply.\nTo Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Spiritualism is, to use his own phrase,\na cult,\" and it is a natural consequence of this point of view that'\nhowever sincerely he may protest his desire that the Society should\nretain its \" independence,\" he should regard as \" obtuse negation\n\"\nand \" unreasonable and vicious opposition \" any criticism of the\nphenomena on which those who take the \" cult \" view of Spiritualism\nare content to base their faith.\n\fMarch 1030 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Resignation 49\nIt has been one of the great achievements of the Society that it\nhas always comprised among its active and loyal members persons\nwhose views on Spiritualism ranged from complete acceptance to\ntotal denial : this has only been possible because an atmosphere of\ntoleration combined with frank mutual criticism has been congenial\nto most of its members. But it would be too much to expect that\nit should be to the liking of all, and from time to time some of our\nmore dogmatic members, both Spiritualists and Anti-Spiritualists,\nhave revolted against it. There have been various secessions in the\npast, but the Society has never allowed itself to be deflected by\nthem from the purpose for which it was founded, namely critical\ninvestigation.\nIt has always been the rule of the Society that the responsibility\nfor both the facts and the reasonings in papers and articles printed\nin Proceedings or the Journal should rest entirely with their authors.\nIt is therefore easy, in a Society as inclusive as ours, for anyone\nseeking to make a case for \" obtuse negation \" to select a list of\npapers having a tendency to deny the supernormality of particular\nphenomena. It would be equally easy to make out as impressive\na list of papers published in recent years which were strongly\naffirmative of the genuineness of them or of other phenomena.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle says \" For a generation, since the death\nof Myers and the end of the Piper sittings, the Society has done no\nconstructive work of any importance.\" The Piper sittings continued,\nof course, for several years after Myers's death, and the principal\nreport on them was published in 1915, which can hardly be called\na \" generation \" back. Shortly after that (in 1919) was published\nthe first of the many papers on Mrs Leonard, all of which can claim\nto be as \" constructive \" as the reports on Mrs Piper, and many of\nwhich are written from a definitely Spiritualistic point of view.\nDoes Sir Arthur suggest that these are of no importance ?\nIt would presumably be useless to remind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\nof the fact that in connection with cross-correspondences the\nSociety has during the alleged dark period developed and patiently\npursued an entirely new line of research ; he has expressed his\npersonal opinion that the cross-correspondences are not of much\nvalue, but this opinion is not shared by a large number of our mem-\nbers, including several who are as convinced Spiritualists as Sir\nArthur himself.\nNor is he probably much interested in the work the Society has\ndone in elucidating the problems of telepathy, though here again\nhe would find himself in disagreement with many Spiritualists, who\nhold that only on a proper understanding of telepathy can a reason-\nable case for survival be founded.\nIt is apparently by the attitude to physical phenomena of con-\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research March 1930\ntributors to Proceedings that the Society is, in Sir Arthur's opinion,\nto be judged. Has Sir Arthur forgotten the report (1909) of the\nNaples sittings with Eusapia Palladino, reckoned by many investi-\ngators the strongest evidence on record for the genuineness of\nphysical phenomena ? And the Willi Schneider sittings at Tavistock\nSquare in 1924 ?\nIf the Society's investigations into physical phenomena have\nthroughout its history been infrequent, this is due to the high\nstandard of control conditions on which the Society has always, and\nproperly, insisted, and to the preference shown by physical mediums\nfor the much lower standard maintained elsewhere.\nOn Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's strictures on Mr Besterman's\nreview of the Millesimo sittings we do not propose to dwell at length,\nas Mr Besterman is replying to them separately. It is, however,\nto be noted that sittings held in complete darkness, for the most\npart without control and without any searching of those present,\nsittings at which phenomena were produced which cannot be\nparalleled in the records of any sittings held under good control\nconditions, are described by Sir Arthur as \"on the very highest\npossible level of psychical research.\" Further comment is superfluous.\nThe theory that since Myers's death the Society, or the Officers\nor Council, have developed an Anti-Spiritualistic bias is as lacking\nin foundation as the contrary theory (which we have also heard\nexpressed) that in recent years it and they have become uncritically\nSpiritualistic.\n(Signed) Lawrence J. Jones, President.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick] \u201e \u201e\nW. H. Salter \/\n'Secretones.\n14 February 1930.\nIII. Eeply by Mr Besterman.\nAs Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has made a contribution of mine to\nthe Journal the ostensible cause of his attack on the Society, I have\nbeen given this opportimity of replying on my own behalf to his\ncircular so far as it concerns my review of the Millesimo sittings.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle is \" ashamed \" that I set aside the\n\" considered opinion \" of Signor Bozzano, and he considers the\nalternative theory of fraud to be absurd and gratuitously offensive.\nBut even during my acquaintance with the work of the Society\n(to the brevity of which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle refers) I have\nlearned that the S.P.R. is concerned not with opinions but with\nfacts, and that it is not accustomed to flinch from offering alternative\nhypotheses where those first suggested do not appear to be in accord-\nance with the facts. What I wrote was written on the basis of such\nfacts as are put before us by Signor Bozzano, and was not concerned\n\fMarch 1930 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Resignation 51\nwitli his opinions. If Signor Bozzano or Sir Artkur Conan Doyle\nconsider my conclusions inaccurate, let them put forward facts, not\nopinions, to refute them.\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's objections to my statements of fact\nare contained in the following two sentences from his letter : \"A\nlady confederate conceals under the short modern skirt a long\nmedieval rapier, a matador's sword, a big doll and other objects\nquite imseen by a critical company. She or some other confederate\nproduces a large balloon-like object which hovers above the company,\nand in some unspecified way produces blasts of ice-cold air.\" This\nis not the case : I say nothing about a lady confederate ; I say\nnothing about a \" short \" skirt, since Signor Bozzano gives no\ninformation on this point, and Signora Rossi may equally well have\nbeen wearing a \" modern \" evening gown, which would have been\nlong ; I do not speak in this connection of \" a long medieval rapier,\na matador's sword, a big doll and other objects,\" but merely of a\ndoll which I suggest measured at most fifteen inches, and of a short\nsword in its scabbard, which I suggest to have been about two feet\nlong (all these \" suggestions \" are inevitable, since Signor Bozzano\ndoes not himself give the necessary information). Even so I merely\nsay that these two objects could have been hidden in a woman's\ndress ; I do not say they ivere, and I also specifically refer to the\nwindow of the room about which we are given no information. I\ndo not refer to a \" large balloon-like object which hovers \" but to\na small balloon that does not hover. It is hardly correct to say that\nthe method suggested by me of producing cold currents is \" un-\nspecified,\" since I devote an entire paragraph to a careful account\nof this well-known method. Finally, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle refers\nto the \" critical company ;\n\" all the evidence, in fact, points to the\ncompany having been utterly uncritical.\nI need say nothing about the third paragraph of Sir Arthur Conan\nDoyle's letter, since he has corrected his mistake in a subsequent\ncommunication. The remarks objected to are not by me but by\nP.-P.-S., and are in any case merely a quite accurate summary of\nan article which was under review. [The third paragraph of Sir\nArt-hux Conan Doyle's letter to the Council originally started, \" A\nfurther example of this gentleman's prejudice . . .\n\"]\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle's observations as to the Society's policy\nit is not in my province to answer. But I may observe that the\n\" Podmore, Dingwall, Besterman tradition of obtuse negation,\"\nis a tradition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's own invention, though\nI am proud to be associated in this way with Podmore, for whose\ncritical methods I have the greatest admiration.\nThe above lines were written for printing in the Journal as a\nreply to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's letter to the Council. In his\n\f52 Journal of Society jor Psychical Research Mahch 1930\ncircular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lias added further criticisms of\nmy review, to which I now reply as briefly as possible. Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle says that I complain \" that we are not told where the\nsword was apported from,\" and goes on to quote a passage tending\nto show that we are told. This is not the case : two different\nswords are in question. Sir Arthur Clonan Doyle says of me, \" He\ntalks of the apports as if their extreme length was two feet ...\"\nThis is not the case : I do not make any such statement. Sir Arthur\nConan Doyle writes of me, \" He complains that he does not know\nwhat a flexatone is, and yet it is described on page 97.\" This is not\nthe case : what I wrote is that the \" flexatone \" is not illustrated or\nadequately described, and that I have been unable to find any refer-\nence to it in the standard musical and other works of reference.\n(Signed) Theodore Besterman.\nU February 1930.\nREVIEW.\nSir Oliver Lodge, Phantom Walls. 8vo, pp. 2-51. London\n:\nHodder and Stoughton, 1929. Price 5s. net.\n\" It is because a beneficent spiritual world has to me become the\nultimate reality.\" says Sir Oliver Lodge, \"that I have composed\nthis book.\" It is a book of a most admirable simplicity and clear-\nness, concerned not so much with evidences, arguments and propa-\nganda, as with musings on the implications of Sir Oliver's spiritual-\nistic faith. The material world which seems so solid and substantial,\nthe \" phantom walls \" which hem us in, are after all nothing but\ntwists and abnormalities in the illimitable, all-penetrating \" ether,\"\nin which we are bidden to seek our spiritual home. To effect the\nreadjustment in our mental outlook which this policy would seem\nto involve Sir Oliver Lodge believes that the physicist is peculiarly\nfitted : he contrasts him with the anatomist and biologist (p. 42),\nwho is typified by Sir Arthur Keith. The latter is not driven to\ntake into his calculations anything beyond the observable material\nbody which he takes as the producer of mind ; whereas the physicist\nhas not only to distinguish the physical from the material (p. 94)\nand to take account of surrounding fields of force, but within the\nlast decade or two has made discoveries which have thoroughly\nupset nearly all the most fundamental principles and compelled\nhim to admit that he does not know what such familiar things as\nlight, matter, and gravitation really are.\nAll of -w^hich is doubtless both true and important, though I cannot\nhelp thinking that Sir Oliver Lodge is not quite prudent in taking\nso seriously the working conceptions of our present day physics :\nthey have little appearance of finality, and seem likely to undergo\n\fMakch 1930 Review\nmany further transformations. Moreover, there is yet another\nscience which Sir Oliver hardly mentions, which stands m more\ndirect relation to psychic phenomena than any other, and may any\nday assume a decisive importance in their estimation. Psychology\nis for the most part still trying, with indifierent success, to become\na science of the old mechanistic type, and has not yet hit upon\neffective working principles of its own. Still some day this may come\nto pass, and then, instead of toying with \"behaviourism and\n\"exact\" measurement, psychology may set itself to elaborate\nseriously the alternative theory always open to it that the body,\nso far from producing mind, is its instrument and product.\nSir Oliver seems to me to be quite right in preferring this alterna-\ntive, though it is of course a theory which will have to be very\nstrenuously tested and confirmed and extended by a vast number\nof experiments, applications and interpretations. It will not do,\nscientifically, to rest content with a suggestion, say, that ex;to-\nplasm \" becomes intelligible if the soul is conceived as moulding\nthe body : the whole physiology of the process will have to be\nstudied and ascertained. ^\nIn general it is not possible to \" prove \" merely the fact ot\nhuman survival and to leave the realm of psychical phenomena an\nassemblage of inexplicable oddities : if they are not wholly fraudu-\nlent, they must indicate a further order of being the exploration\nof which cannot but prove highly instructive, and must transform\nalso our beliefs about the physical order of which we have so often\nsupposed ourselves to have attained final and unalterable knowledge.\nMoreover, any truly scierdific (that is verifiable and progressive)\nknowledge will of course transform, not only our present \" science,\nbut also our \"religion\" and our \"philosophy,\" to both of which\nSir Oliver seems unduly respectful (ch. 12). Our present \" religion\nwould appear to be composed of unverified and largely discordant\npostulates, our present \"philosophy\" of unverifiable prejudices,\ncalled \" a friori truths ;\n\" and neither the one nor the other can\nreally claim exemption from the logical demand for verification.\n^\nAs regards details I have found very suggestive Sir Olivers\nsuggestion (pp. 76 f.) that since \" there are grades of existence or\ngrades of value\" there \"may be grades of survival.\" It has\nalways seemed to me quite fantastic to assume that survival must\nbe thrust upon all whatever they desire and whatever they do. I\nwelcome also Sir Oliver Lodge's discussion on pp. 96-100 which\nmakes pre-existence, as well as survival, a matter of degree. If\nspiritualism can induce the human race to think seriously and\nintelligently about the \" half-beliefs \" in a future life it has played\nwith so long, it will have fully justified itself intellectually.\nF.

The dowser's art, he says,\nseems to him to be at the cross-roads of the physical and psychical\nsciences. The ordinary dowser practises an art which seems to\nconform to the known sciences ; this art is not difficult to acquire,\nand it can render the greatest services to geologists, farmers, physi-\ncians and prospectors. The \" seer \" of water or ore acts as the ordi-\nnary dowser, whilst seeming to be endowed with a very particular\nand hitherto seldom observed sense of sight. The intuitive dowser\nwho questions the dowsing-rod or works on plans and photographs\nseems to handle an \" intelligent wave \" which reminds us of tele-\npathic phenomena. Here we are on the borderland of psychical\nresearch.\nGrande Revue, August 1929.\nMr Maurice Wolf has a paper on \" Allan Kardec, the Father of\nFrench Spiritism,\" which is to a certain extent noteworthy by its\nsympathetic tone towards Hippolyte Leon Denizard Rivail (Allan\nKardec being RivaiFs name in an alleged former existence). Not-\nwithstanding the words \" pere du spiritisme fran9ais,\" the writer\nseems somewhat inclined to see in Allan Kardec \" the incontestable\nchief of a new religion, whose adepts scattered through all lands\nacknowledged his primacy without discussion ;\n\" as a matter of fact\nHivail's authority is nil in Anglo-Saxon countries. It is interesting\n\fMarch 1930 Notes on Periodicals 55\nto learn that in 1861 his works were publicly and solemnly burnt in\nBarcelona by command of the local Bishop, which fate would\nundoubtedly have overtaken \" the father of French spiritism\n\"\nhimself had he lived two or three centuries before !\nRevue des questions scientifiques (Louvain), January 1930.\nM. F. Kaisin, professor of geology at the University of Louvain\n(Belgium) discusses the \" art of discovering sources.\" In the first\npart he deals with orthodox hydrology, with special reference to\nthe work of Abbe Paramelle printed in Paris in 1859 under the same\ntitle, UArt de decouvrir les sources. Abbe Paramelle, by the way,\nenergetically disclaimed being a dowser. In the second part the\nwriter is concerned with the dowsing-rod and pendulum. We are\nopportunely reminded that the latter were used in ages gone-by for\nthe most varied purposes, even including \" the Protestants to be\nmassacred.\" Professor Kaisin shows himself very sceptical as to\nthe present dowsers, among whom figure prominently on the con-\ntinent several Roman Catholic priests. Of the latter some were\ntested at the University of Louvain with quite negative results !\nHis conclusions are distinctly unfavourable to the \" sourcier.\"\nNone of the dowsers whose sayings have thus far been examined is in\nany degree endowed with such an hypothetical faculty, he maintains.\nStill, it may exist in others, though the results of the investigations\nhitherto undertaken in this direction are by no means favourable\nto the \" bacillogyres.\" Here is Professor Kaisin's conclusion :\n\" On the day when the dowsers bring incontestable facts tending to\nestablish the reality of their power, no scientist worthy of the name\nwill refuse to bow down, following in this a habit which honours\nthe profession.

But he was sure that what we are\ndoing was right to do ; he held unwaveringly that through these\nadits lay an unassailable, if a slow, advance into the knowledge\n\u2022\nof things vmseen.\"\nWith but few changes these words may be applied to Lord Balfour,\nwho was a member and a Vice-President of our Society from its\nfoundation in 1882 down to the day of his death, and who was its\nPresident in 1893.\nOf Professor Adams Myers said that his individual judgement\ncould \" without published argument \" carry a serious weight of\nits own. Of Lord Balfour, had he always remained silent, the same\nmight have been said ; but happily, although too fully engaged\nin other spheres of work to do more, he was able to make one\ncontribution to our subject in his Presidential Address ; and this\nAddress carried, and \" can still carry a serious weight of its own \".\nShould any of our members, however, be moved to read it again,\nor to read it for the first time, the date at which it was delivered\nshould be borne in mind ; for its line of argument, though it might\nnot surprise us in 1930, was no ordinary one to put forward in\n1894, when thought still lay under the domination of scientific\ndogmatism.\nLi the obituary notices of Lord Balfour that have recently\nappeared little or no notice has been taken of his interest in psychical\nresearch. Nor is this surprising, for so many-sided were his activities\nthat it can have been no easy task to cover the whole range of\nthem ;\nand, moreover, the depth and persistence of his interest in\nour investigations were probably unknown to, and unsuspected\nby, most of the biographers. It is, therefore, fitting to place on\nrecord in these pages that psychical research was no passing or\noccasional subject of curiosity to him, but one which excited his\nkeenest interest ; an interest that did not merely remain unchanged,\nbut which went on growing, so that during the last 17 or 18 years\nof his life, there was no topic about which he would more eagerly\nseek information from those whom he thought able to supply it.\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research ApeilISSo\nHe was joreventecl by lack of time from making a thorough and\nminute study of the evidence published in Proceedings ; but those\nwho are aware of the quickness of his intellectual grasp may be\ninterested to know that he was a convinced believer in telepathy\nand in survival.\nJ.

P.\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF MEMBERS.\nThe Annual General Meeting of Members of the Society was held\nin the Society's Library at 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C.I,\non Thiirsday, 27 February 1930, at 3.30 p.m., The President in\nthe chair. There were also present : The Rt. Hon. G. W. Balfour,\nMr Theodore Besterman, Mr W. R. Bousfield, Mrs Brackenbury,\nMr H. Dennis Bradley, Mr G. B. Brown, Miss Carruthers, Lieut-CoL\nMaxwell Dick, Mr and Mrs E. J. Dingwall, Mrs Fernald, Miss\nFleming, Mr Herbert Gatliff, Lieut-Col. S. D. Hayward, Miss\nJephson, Mr Jordan-Smith, Miss I. Newton, Mr F. D. Perrott, Mrs\nRobertson, Mrs Rothschild, Mr and Mrs W. H. Salter, Mr W. S.\nMontgomery Smith, Mr N. H. Vinen, and Dr V. J. Woolley.\nThe President stated that the Report of the Council and the\nAccounts for the year 1929 were printed in the current (February)\nnumber of the Journal and had been circulated to all members of\nthe Society, and he would invite discussion on them later.\nWith reference to the Accounts, the Hon. Treasurer (Mr W. H.\nSalter) said : Before dealing with the finances of the last year I\npropose with jom permission to ask our members to take a general\nview of the period covered by the last eight or nine years, which\nhas been from the point of view of finance quite abnormal. This\nperiod has been one of imusual receipts and unusual expenditure.\nIt is, I think, now drawing to a close, and it may be useful to take\nstock of the Society's position as it was in the years immediately\nfollowing the War and as it is now, because the changes which have\ntaken place in the Society's organisation during that time are con-\nsiderable, and I think such as to justify the Society in congratulating\nitself.\nThe first and most obvious change is the change of our quarters.\nInstead of the small, noisy, inconvenient rooms at Hanover Square,\nwe find ourselves, mainly thanks to Miss Newton, in a house which\nis not only far more spacious and quiet but also more economical.\nNext as to the organisation of research : during the War the\nSociety suffered an irreparable loss in the resignation through ill-\nhealth of the Research Officer, Miss Johnson, and was for a time\nleft with no organised research department. A great deal of the\nSociety's work has always been done, and can best be done, by\n\fApril 1930 Annual General Meeting of Members 61\nindividual members working on their own initiative and unofficially ;\nso far from belittling work of this kind, I wish that our members\nwere more enterprising in doing it. But it is also important that the\nSociety should have on its staff and in regular attendance at the\nrooms one or more officials ready, in the hackneyed phrase, \" to go\nanywhere and do anything \", to attend sittings in the Society's\nrooms or elsewhere, and to go promptly to investigate cases of\nhauntings, poltergeists, etc. in any part of the country where they\nare reported. In this respect the Society is now well equipped, and\nit is to be hoped that all members will give members of the Staf?\nengaged on research the loyal support and assistance which they\ndeserve.\nSome of our members probably do not realise the amount of work\nAve have done in recent years in investigating Poltergeists and the\nlike. The results are not often printed in full, partly because on\ninvestigation most of the cases are explicable by normal causes,\nand partly because much of the information our investigators\nobtain is confidential. All we can do is to print from time to time\nabstracts, each of which represents nevertheless a great deal of\ncareful work ; full records are of course drawn up and preserved\nin our archives.\nThe Society now has an excellent .seance-room for which, and for\nthe plant connected with it, the Society has chiefly to thank the\ngenerosity of one of its members. Any one who had experience of\nthe inconvenient conditions under which sittings were held at\nHanover Square will appreciate how much we owe to the donor.\nLastly, on the subject of research, must be mentioned the Myers\nMemorial Fund, the income of which the Council is empowered to\napply to assist particular pieces of research work.\nNext as to the Library : there was no accommodation for a\nproper Library at Hanover Square and soon after we had well\nsettled down in our new quarters the Society undertook the reor-\nganisation of its Library. It made such good progress with its own\nresources under Mr Besterman's supervision that he was able to\nget a handsome grant from the Carnegie Trustees. As to the\nimprovement effected it would be superfluous to say more. Si\nvionumentum. requiris, circumspice !\nAs to the result of the changes indicated above the Society has a\nmuch stronger and more efficient organisation for carrying on its\nwork than it had at Hanover Square. But the organisation could\nnot have been built up, nor could it have been used to carry on the\namount of research the Society has done in recent years, solely out\nof the ordinary income of the Society. The necessary funds have\nbeen provided partly by donations in response to appeals to the\nwhole Society, e.g., to cover the costs of the move to Tavistock\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April luao\nSquare, for research funds, and (more recently) for tlie Library.\nBut the Society coukl not have gone very far if it had not been for\nthe gift of the seance-TOom and its equipment, for the grant from\nthe Carnegie Trustees, and for the generosity of the \" anonymous\ndonor \" who for several years provided practically all the funds\nneeded for research work.\nThe Society's ordinary income, mainly derived from investments\nand subscriptions, is not now, and (as I am informed) never has\nbeen much more than enough to pay for such expenses as rent,\nsalaries, printing, postage, etc. The surplus available for research\nhas always been small, and the Society has had to depend mainly\neither on members carrying on research at their own expense, or on\ndonations made specially for research.\nAs I have already said, the period of abnormal receipts and ex-\npenditure is practically at an end : practically, for the Carnegie\nGrant has not run its full term. In 1929 the Society exhausted the\nbalance of the funds specially given for research, and, mainly owing\nto an exceptionally heavy printing bill, would so far as our General\nFunds are concerned have ended the year with a deficit, had not\nour printers kindly consented to this last bill (amounting to nearly\n\u00a3300) standing over till the New Year, when it was promptly paid.\nThere is no need to take an alarmist view of our finances : our\nordinary income is sufficient to meet our \" ordinary \" expenditure.\nThis, as above stated, never has included a large expenditure on\nresearch. We can out of ordinary income keep the Research\nDepartment going and pay the relatively small expenses of inves-\ntigating spontaneous cases reported from time to time, but we cannot\npay for work on the scale, e.g., of the Warren Elliot investigation.\nIt is for the Society as a whole to consider whether it wishes the\norganisation built up to be used to the fullest, to function at its\nmaximum capacity. I am not proposing to send round the hat at\nthe moment ; but if the occasion for any large-scale investigation\narises I shall do so without hesitation and in full confidence.\nThe more immediate necessity is to improve the Society's ordinary\nincome. The mmiber of our Associates is steadily declining as the\nSociety has for some years suspended for financial reasons the\nelection of new ones. The number of Members (618) is considerably\ngreater than at the end of the War (348), but the number is now\nslightly declining. While we must regret the resignations in recent\nyears, we may congratulate ourselves that only in the rarest instances\nis the cause dissatisfaction with the Society's policy in psychical\nresearch : financial stringency affects our members as it does the\nSociety, and it is, I think, a very remarkable fact that, notwith-\nstanding this stringency, our membership has kept up as well as\nit has done.\n\fApril 1930 Annual Generai Meeting of Members 63\nOf those who have resigned, on grounds of policy, many have\nobviou.sIy not taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with the\nwork the Society has done, and w'e may confidently hope that their\nempty places will be filled by new recruits more suitable to a Society\nwith scientific aims. \"\\. .\nThe President invited discussion.\nMr Dingwall, after congratulating the Council on the good work\ndone in the Library and in carrying out the experiments in\ntelepathy and clairvoyance, called attention to the opportunity\ngiven by the Council to members for carrying out investigations\ninto physical phenomena in the scance-RooB?.. .. He objected to the\ncondition that the Hon. Research Officer^. , or , a representative\nnominated by the Council should be present :^at the sittings ; he\ndisapproved of a stranger being introduced wi%o could do as he\nliked at private sittings. \\\nDr Woolley said he supposed that he was the ptei'son most con-\ncerned in Mr Dingwall's remarks, since in the ordfiiary course he\nwould be present at sittings held in the Society's preinises. If for\nany reason the members of the circle thought his ^esence not\ndesirable, it would possibly not be difficult to find sokie equally\nsuitable person to take his place, but it would not be in the interests\nof the Society to allow any small group of members or others to\nhave the unrestricted use of the room and apparatus, ^t also\nseemed essential that some representative of the Council s'koukt*^\nbe present at the sittings, in order to report on the conditions\\nd' f\nphenomena of those sittings, partly in order that the Council akd^^^\nthe Society should share in the knowledge gained and partly as \\ -^jj\"\ncheck on garbled and exaggerated accounts which might be attri->.^\n'\nbuted to the Society and bring it into disrepute. Mr Dingwall had %^\nsome experience of the usual practice in scientific laboratories. He\nmust realise that no one would be allowed to carry on research in\nany laboratory on the condition that the person in charge of that\nlaboratory should not be allowed to be present.\nMr Besterman, Colonel Dick, Mrs Dingwall, Mr Dennis Bradley,\nMr Gatliff, Mr Salter and others took part in the discussion that\nfollowed.\nNo other points arising out of the Annual Report, the Meeting-\nproceeded to the election of Members of Comicil. The Chairman\nannounced that the six retiring Members offered themselves for re-\nelection. No other nominations having been received, the following\nwere declared to be duly elected Members of the Coimcil : The\nRt. Hon. G. W. Balfour, Mr E. N. Bennett, M.P., Sir Lawrence\nJones, Bart., Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., Professor W. McDougall,\nand Dr V. J. Woolley.\nMr Dingwall raised a question in connection with the review in\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research AnuL 1930\nthe January Journal of the report on the Millesimo sittings. He\nhad not read the book, but Mr Besterman had come to the identical\nconclusions as Herr Rudolf Lambert in his criticism of the sittings\nand he agreed that the sittings from the scientific point of view were\nworthless. He referred to several papers in Proceedings which he\nconsidered fell below the standard set in the review in question,\nand was of opinion that the Society was not entitled to print such\npapers and at the same time refuse to admit the evidence of other\npeople.\nDuring the discussion that followed Mrs Salter pointed out that\ncertain mental phenomena could not be brought under strict\ncontrol, and that common sense and judgement had to be used in\nestimating the value of these phenomena. The physical phenomena\nfell into a totally different category, for they could be brought\nunder observation.\nMr Gerald Balfour pointed out that the papers in Proceedings\nwere signed ;\nthey did not necessarily represent any opinion\ndeliberately arrived at by the Society or by its Council.\nMr Salter and Mr Besterman also took part in the discussion.\nTHE MISPLACED TOMBSTONE CASE.\nIn the Journal for October 1928 (xxiv. 336), there appeared a letter\nfrom Sir Lawrence Jones inviting further particulars (if these could\nbe obtained) of an apparently veridical dream which had been\nrelated many years ago to his brother, who was then Bishop of\nLewes. It is unnecessary to quote the letter in full, but the im-\nportance of the case lay in the fact that the dream was said to have\nled to the discovery of a mistake in connection with the erection\nof a tombstone.\nA somewhat prolonged investigation has resulted in the identifi-\ncation of the place and persons concerned, and the following accounts\nare based upon interviews with the sister and brother-in-law of\nthe deceased, Mr Green, over whose grave the tombstone was\nsupposed to have been erected, and also with Mr Rogers, Vicar of\nH., who officiated at the burial.\nFortunately Mr Rogers had kept most of the documents relating\nto the case, and wrote the following brief account of the circum-\nstances (1 February 1929) : \"Mr Smith, the husband of Mr Green's\nsister, wrote to me stating that his wife's health was suffering and\nbeing undermined owing to a constant recurring dream, in which\nshe dreamt that the cross which should have been erected over her\nbrother's grave, was over that of another person. This communi-\ncation reached me about a year after the funeral.\n\fApril 1'J30 The Misplaced Tovibstone Case 65\n\" I interviewed Mr B., the clerlv and sexton, wlio both dug the\ngrave and officiated as Clerk at the funeral, and who was most\npositive that the cross was over the body of Mr Green, and I wrote\nto Mr Smith to that effect on Sept. 20th 1906. Later on Mr Smith\nwrote to me again, saying that his wife was worse than before and\nstill had these disturbing recurrent dreams, and always the same,\nabout the cross being over the wrong grave. He asked for a personal\ninterview and came down to see me. In this interview, he asked\nthat the grave should be opened so that the matter could be settled.\nThe one reason he persistently gave for this request was the state\nof his wife's health consequent on the dreams.\n\" Mr B. met Mr Smith and myself at the vicarage and we ques-\ntioned him for a long time on every aspect of the case we could\nthink of, but he persisted in his firm belief (over and over again\ncalling our attention to the fact that he had dug the grave and acted\nas clerk at his own father-in-law's funeral which was just before that\nof Mr Green, and was only two or three grave spaces distant and in\nthe same line) that the cross was over the grave of Mr Green.\n\" Then followed the correspondence, which I enclose, from the\nHome Office and the Bishop's Registrar, and acting on the suggestion\nof the Bishop's Registrar (and approved of by the Bishop) in the\npresence of Mr Smith I had the grave opened, and we found that\nthe dream of Mrs Smith was correct. The Cross having been placed\nover Mr Taylor instead of over the brother of Mrs Smith.\n\" Mr B. re-erected the cross over the body of Mr Green at his own\nexpense.\n\" Since this I have had no further correspondence with Mr Smith\non the subject, but for a short time, two or three years perhaps, he\nused to send a few shillings for the upkeep of the grave, then he\nceased to send this and my letters to his address were unanswered.\"\nIt will be seen from this account that Mr Green was not the\nfather of Mrs Smith, as stated in the story told to Sir Lawrence\nJones, but was her brother. The statement with regard to his\nhaving made a fortune is also incorrect, Mr Green having only made\nsufficient money to retire and live in quite a modest way ; the\n\" monument \" was simply a plain stone cross and curb.\nOn 20 June 1929, an interview was obtained with Mrs Smith,\nwho gave the following account of the incidents relating to the\nburial of her brother (30 June 1929) : On his return from China,\nMr Green went to live in H. with two friends of Mrs Smith, a Mr\nLewis and his housekeeper, Mrs Elsdon. When he fell ill Mrs Smith\nwent to H. and helped with the nursing, remaining until he died.\nShe and her husband, Mr Lewis and Mrs Elsdon, were all present\nat the burial. Mr Rogers conducted the service and Mr Lewis acted\nas undertaker. She visited the grave once after the burial and then\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1930\nleft H. A few months afterwards slie went to a firm in Portsmouth\nand chose a cross for the grave. When she received the bill she went\nto H. to make sure that the stone was the one chosen. Directly\nshe saw it she felt certain that it had been placed over the wrong\ngrave and later, when she visited the friend at whose house Mr\nGreen had died, they told her they also had seen it and were of the\nsame opinion but had not liked to worry her by writing about it.\nShe interviewed Mr Rogers and the sexton and both denied that any\nmistake had been made. As Mrs Smith and her friends (one of whom\nhad acted as undertaker) were certain that the stone was over the\nwrong grave, she left the matter in her husband's hands with the\nresult that permission to open the grave was obtained. As we\nalready know, a mistake was discovered and rectified.\nWith regard to the alleged dream, Mrs Smith could not give any\nexplanation as to how the story arose, she had never had any\ndreams about her brother after his death, and had no recollection\nof ever having had any dreams of any kind.\nOwing to the fact that Mr and Mrs Smith had separated shortly\nafter the death of her brother, and were living in different parts of\nthe country, it was some time before Mr Smith could be traced.\nHe had not been in communication with his wife for some years.\nWhen an interview was finally obtained he was not told of the\nprevious one with his wife, so that each statement is a completely\nindependent account of the incident.\nAlthough Mr Green's death took place in 1905, Mr Smith appeared\nto have a clear recollection of the details relating to the burial and\ngave the following account (23 September 1929) : During Mr\nGreen fi residence in the East he and Mr Smith had corresponded\nwith one another from time to time. Owing to failing health, Mr\nGreen wrote to Mr Smith of his intention to return home and retire.\nAbout the time he was due to arrive Mr Smith had a dream in which\nhe saw Mr Green in a pool of water ; he seemed to be calling for help.\nKnowing that his wife was very deeply attached to her brother,\nMr Smith did not mention the dream to her, fearing it might alarm\nher.\nThe first intimation Mr Smith had of Mr Green having landed\nwas through the authorities of a mental hospital, and it was to the\neffect that they had a patient there who appeared to have lost his\nmemory. He kept repeating \" find Smith \". Mr Smith followed the\nmatter up, took charge of his brother-in-law and arranged for him\nto go to the house of the friends at H. (already mentioned) where\nhe was nursed until he died.\nMrs Smith, who had assisted with the nursing had remained in\nH. until after the burial. Mr Rogers officiated at the funeral, and\nMr and Mrs Smith, and the friends at whose house Mr Green died.\n\fApril 1930 The Misplaced Tombstone Case 67\nwere all present at the grave side. After the burial Mr and Mrs\nSmith left H., and returned to their own home some distance away.\nSome months later a tombstone was ordered from a firm in Ports-\nmouth. (According to the records the death took place in August\n1905 and the tombstone was erected in 1906).\nLater, when Mr Smith was going through some unpaid accoimts\nhe came across the bill for the stone. As he looked at it, he received\nthe impression that his brother-in-law was staring at him and trying\nto tell him something. That night he dreamt that the stone had\nbeen placed over the wrong grave. The impression was so strong\nand the dream so vivid that he felt sure something must be wrong.\nWithout telling her of his dream, he suggested to Mrs Smith that they\nshould go to H. the next day in order to make sure that the stone\nwas correctly placed, before paying the account.\nImmediately they saw the stone they realised that it had been\nplaced over the wrong grave. Some friends in the village, who had\nl3een present at the funeral, confirmed this conviction and subse-\nquently Mr Rogers was interviewed. (It is to be noted that Mr\nRogers states that he was interviewed by Mr Smith ; he has no\nrecollection that Mrs Smith was present at the interview). Both\nMr Rogers and the sexton maintained that such a mistake was\nimpossible.\nMr and Mrs Smith returned home, and that night, and for many\nnights after, Mr Smith had the same dream. On several occasions\nhe wrote to Mr Rogers asking that the grave might be opened but\nthe request was refused partly on account of the disturbance such\na proceeding would cause, and partly owing to the assertion of the\nsexton that no such mistake could have been made.\nAlthough the dreams persisted, Mr Smith did not like to tell his\nwife about them, fearing that it might upset her. Finally, being\ndetermined to have the grave opened, he went to Mr Rogers and\nrelated the dreams but attributed them to his wife and said he was\nafraid her health would be affected imless something was done to\nset her mind at rest. After considerable correspondence, permission\nwas obtained from the authorities through Mr Rogers, and the grave\nwas opened. It was found that a mistake actually had been made ;\nthe cross had been placed over the adjoining grave where a burial\nhad taken place (in the early part of August 1905). Mr Smith did\nnot mention his dreams to anyone, other than Mr Rogers, fearing\nthat people would consider him unbalanced, and for this reason\nalso, in all his written communications with Mr Rogers and the Home\nOffice, etc. regarding permission to open the grave, he purposely\nomitted any mention of the dreams.\nAs will be seen from Mr Roger's account, the sexton removed and\nre-erected the cross over Mr Green's grave at his own expense. In\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1930\nview of the time which has elapsed since the incidents here recorded\nactually happened, there are, as might be expected, discrepancies\nVjetween the statements of the various persons concerned ; there is\nhowever, corroboration with regard to the following particulars :\nThe date of Mr Green s death (19 August 1905) ; date and place of\nburial (taken from records and tombstone) ; names of those attending\nfuneral (corroborated by all parties) ; date of erection of tombstone ;\nmistake in erection of tombstone ; and subsequent rectification\n(corroborated by all parties).\nOn the other hand, no corroboration can be obtained with regard\nto the dreams owing to the fact that, with the exception of his\nstatement to Mr Rogers, Mr Smith did not mention them to anyone\neither in the family or outside. We have therefore the fact that a\nmistake had been made which was rectified, but, as to whether Mr\nSmith was prompted to move in the matter simply from the evidence\nof his own eyes and Mrs Smith's impression when they visited the\ngrave, or whether his action was the result of his own alleged\nimpression and dream, it is impossible to say. All that can be done\nis to give the facts as revealed by the people concerned, making\nallowance for discrepancies due to lapse of time, and leave those\nwho read them to draw their own conclusions.\nE. Brackenbury.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Spirit-Hypothesis.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I quite agree with Dr Schiller that the ideas connoted by\nsuch terms as telepathy, clairvoyance, subliminal are at present\nextremely vague and ill-defined. But it is precisely with a view to\nclarifying our fundamental conceptions that I would advocate that\nthe general supervision of the sittings of our few really good mental\nmediums should be in the hands of a trained psychologist. It\nmight not matter whether such a man were a behaviourist or a\npsychoanalist so long as he were adequately trained in the methods\nof psychological enquiry and had a good standing acquaintance with\nthe psychology of abnormal mental states. For there are many\nquestions bearing on the connection of supernormal knowledge with\nthe medium's previous mental history that I believe a competent\npsychologist would be better able to elucidate than an intelligent\nlayman, whether spiritualist or non-spiritualist.\nOne cannot of course entirely rule out the intervention of dis-\ncarnate himian beings as a possible hypothesis, but I do not think\nthat there is the least danger that the spirit-hypothesis will be\n\fApril 1930 Correspondence\nneglected. Its religious and emotional significance secure for it a\nparamount and (from a scientific point of view) disproportionate\namount of attention. Indeed, at present the best sensitives are\nalmost entirely in the hands of convinced spiritualists. Among\nthese are intelligent observers, who seldom, however, experiment,\nor do so only along stereotyped lines. There is therefore real\ndanger that in this general contempt for the services of the trained\npsychologist we are losing golden opportunities of research.\nYours, etc.\nS. G. SOAL.\nA Suggested Experiment in Telepathy.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir, \u2014In Mrs Sidgwick's invaluable sequel to Phantasms of the\nLiving {Proceedings, xxxiii) experimental cases are given (M. CI. 97,\nand a case from Journal, viii. 71) in which an Agent (A) thinks of\na .subject (S), a living person unknown to the Percipient (P). P\nlooks in the crystal and has a vision of S not in the dress and cir-\ncumstances expected by A but as S was at the time of the sitting.\nWhat part do A, P, and S play in these amazing experiments ?\n(1) Must S be a living human being ? (2) Could A be replaced by an\nobject (say a letter) associated with S ?\nExperiments should be tried :\n(1) in which A thinks of (a) an animal (dog, cat, horse), (b) an\ninanimate object (book, chair, car), (c) a deceased person known to\nhim in each case :\n(2) in which P draws a closed envelope from among a number\ncontaining letters written by various persons. P alone of course\nwould know the one chosen, upon which S would depend.\nIn (1) (a) might prove interesting ; also (b) in the case of a\ncherished object whose whereabouts at the time was not known.\nBut it would probably be trying P \" rather high \". As regards (c)\nthe possible results are best imagined !\nIn both (16) and (2) some light would possibly be thrown on\nthe operations of psychometry : in {la) on the function of the\nliving mind in the matter.\nThe function of S as an agent in such experiments might be\ntested in an interesting manner were two agents to sit independently\neach with a scryer and both think of the same friend in the same\nway (dress etc.) at the same time. Other experiments on lines\noutlined above suggest themselves also. In these the function of\nP would also be tested.\nYours, etc.\nErnest S.

The facts\nare as follows. Immediately before my departure from Berlin\n\u2014\nleaving Valiantine to continue the series of sittings at the house of\nFrau von Dirksen\u2014owing to the attitude of several of the sitters\nat the preceding seances at which I had been present, I warned\nFrau von Dirksen of the danger to the health of the medium if a\nlight were turned on suddenly during a sitting. I made no mention\nwhatever of the American Embassy : I said that in such an event\nthe English Embassy in Berlin would be informed.\nP.-P.-S. refers to Mrs Bradley's letter to Frau von Dirksen\nprinted in Dr Kroner's paper. This letter was a short personal one\nand was never intended as a detailed report for publication. Her\nremarks are made upon the Genoa and not the Berlin seances and her\nbrief references to the controlled sittings are absolutely correct.\nIn both of these controlled sittings all the seals were found to\nbe completely intact after the seance, as also was the Leukoplast\nsticking plaster which reached from ear to ear and hermetically\nclosed the mouth of the medium. At the sitting referred to by Mrs\nHack, when Mr Boucers of Luce e Ombra was present, but at which\nProfessor Ernesto Bozzano was not present, again all the seals and\nthe Leukoplast across the mouth were discovered to be intact when\nthe lights were turned on. Immediately prior to the end of the\nseance, after considerable mental and physical phenomena, by\nrequest part of the bindings were supernormally severed, but in\nsuch a manner as to render it impossible for the medium to move\nfrom his chair and impossible for him to speak until the intact\nadhesive plaster was carefully removed from his mouth.\nP.-P.-S. refers to \" Dr Kroner's detailed account of George\nValiantine's exposure in Berlin.\" He omits, however, even to\nintimate what this \" exposure \" consists of. There has been NO\nexposure of Valiantine. Dr Kroner's paper consists merely of a\nmass of sheer assumptions, based upon ignorant and prejudiced\nscepticism, and the only specific allegations made are individual\n\fApril 1930 Correspondence 71\nand uncorroborated. These allegations were carelessly made by\ninefficient and inexperienced sitters and can definitely be proved\nto be untrue.\nDr Kroner's assumptions have been refuted and severely criticised\nby many scientific researchers in Germany. My analysis and reply\nto Dr Kroner is now being translated by Professor Gustave Zeller\nand will be published in Germany in March next.\nYours, etc.\nH.

B.\nSanders is not only out of print but very difficult to obtain, and our\nLibrarian has not yet been able to obtain a copy for our library.\nBoth cases are, however, known to our Society. Myers in his Human\nPersonality discusses both more or less and there is a review, in\nour Proceedings, vol. xiv, of the Mollie Fancher case by Professor\nRomaine Newbold.\n\u2022\u2022\nThere is a useful list of recorded cases of divided personality in a footnote\non -p. 9.5. The earliest mentioned is dated 184.5 and the next lS6i).\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April 1930\nWhy then, it may be asked, does Dr Walter Prince spend so\nmuch time and trouble now on reviewing these two somewhat\ninadequately reported cases of divided personality ? He makes the\nreason fairly clear in his preface (pp. 14 and 15). Among recorded\ncases of the kind they are the two in which there is most evidence\nof the manifestation of supernormal mental faculties by one or more\nof the split up personalities. Both the Rev. C. B. Sanders and\nMiss Mollie Fancher showed at times when in an abnormal state\ntelepathic and clairvoyant powers\u2014meaning by clairvoyance the\npower of perceiving objects and occurrences in the material world\nwithout the use of the senses.\nNow clairvoyance is at present one of the subjects which it is\nmost important for the S.P.R. to study. Good evidence for its\nreality is rare, and there are probably very few of us who believe\nit exists compared with the number prepared to believe in telepathy.\nEvidence for clairvoyance, however, seems to be slowly accumulating\n\u2014in book tests for instance\u2014and it may be that in some cases of\napparent telepathy, the supernormal knowledge, or some of it,\nshown by the percipient is directly acquired without the intervention\nof another human mind. At any rate the whole subject needs\ncareful study and further collection of evidence.\nFrom this point of view the \" two old cases \" of this Bulletin are\nimportant ; as indeed is \" A Case of Psychometry \" described by\nDr Prince in his preface (p. 10). Dr Prince has analysed the evidence\nobtainable about them with great care as to its reliability and its\nreasonable interpretation. He also compares it with what there\nis of similar evidence in other cases. The result is a fuller knowledge\nof the two cases than can be obtained except from the originally\nprinted accounts themselves, and of these the most important,\nthat describing the case of the Rev. C. B. Sanders, is very difficult\nto obtain.^ We may therefore thank Dr Prince and the Boston\nSociety for a valuable and useful piece of work.\nE. M.

If any of our Members know of a copy and can\nput him on the track of it he will be very grateful.

R. W. Wilson.\nThe following brief note on a series of sittings held diiring the past\nyear with Mrs Mason may be of interest. The sittings were held\nanonymously at the rooms of the London Spiritualist Alliance, Ltd.,\nand were taken by two sitters, who attended first separately as\nunconnected people, and later together. No striking evidence of\nsurvival was obtained, but certain statements were made by the\nControl which appeared to the sitters to be undoubtedly super-\nnormal.\nOne of the chief characteristics observed was the almost complete\nabsence of volunteered information (which if given at all was given\nin the first few minutes of the sittings), the phenomena taking the\nform of replies to questions asked by the sitter. The Control always\nshowed eagerness for these questions to be asked, saying they helped\nthe communicator. The first reply to a test question would nearly\nalways be hurried, incorrect and pretty obviously a guess on the\npart of the Control, and the statement having been promptly turned\ndown by the sitter, a paiise would ensue, often followed by correct\ninformation. A typical instance of this took place when the name\nof the country with which the commimicator had business connec-\ntions was desired :\nSitter. Can he tell me the name of this country ?\nControl. America or Australia conditions.\nSitter. No.\nControl (after pause). It's a hot country. Does it begin with S ?\nSitter. Yes.\nControl. Is there an A.I.N, or U ?\nSitter. Yes, an N ; not a U.\nControl. Is there an 0 ? I get I, then S.E. Doesn't the I follow\nS ? I seem to get P. S.P.I. Haven't I given you A ?\nS.P.A.I.N.\nHaving spelt the word Spain, which was correct, the Control seemed\nxmable to pronounce it.\nNames often appear to be received by this medimu in the same\nway, that is, letter by letter, wrongly arranged. Sometimes the\ntask of arranging the letters correctly would prove too much for the\nControl and the word would have to be left. At other times, as was\nthe case with the \" Spain \" incident, the Control would apparently\nbe unable to pronounce the completed word.\n\fMat 1930 Note on the Mediumship of Mrs Mason 75\nAnotlier metliod of receiving names was instanced when the\nChristian name of the sitter (Rosemary) was indicated by a flower\nbeing \" held up \" by the commmiicator. Two apparent interpre-\ntations or gnesses on the part of the Control followed, namely, Violet\nand Daisy, and the subject was then dropped. Shortly afterwards,\nin the same sitting, however, the Control turned to it as follows :\nControl. He puts a large rose on your lap, in connection with\nyour name. A red rose. Do you follow that ?\nSitter. Yes, it means something to me.\nControl. And there is the name Mary called. Rose Mary. I do\nnot understand what it means.\nIn nearly every other sitting, the communicator, when he was\nfirst announced as being present, was said to bring a rose or roses,\nevidently being strongly associated in the medium's mind with this\nflower. It may be of course that the rose is in the nature of a cliche\nwith Mrs Mason, and information on this point from others who have\nhad experience with the medium would be much appreciated by the\nwriter. In one case, the rose certainly seemed to serve as a means of\nidentification, as when the second sitter went alone, in circum-\nstances which do not give reason to suppose that any normal\nassociation with the first sitter arose in the medium's mind. The\nfollowing statements were made :\nControl. He has a daughter on the earth plane ... he shows me\na rose [excitement and recognition by the Control].\nHe's got a daughter Rosemary on the earth plane.\nAnother method of receiving names was instanced when the\ndesired name was \" Crosbj^\" An attempt was made to give it by\nmeans of the sound, thus :\nControl. The name of that man ... 0. Is it Oswell Cosgrave ?\nHaving given isolated pieces of supernormal information the\nControl would often attempt to enlarge on them or interpret them,\nwith disastrous results. Thus, when a correct statement was made\nthat the brother of the sitter had to do with horses, the Control\nfollowed this up by assuming erroneously that they were race-horses,\nand purported to see a particular brown and white horse running\nvery fast.\nUnfortunately great persistence was shown by the Control in\nfishing, so that a good deal had to be discoimted. From the point of\nview of appropriate selection of evidence, the sittings were dis-\nappointing, as the sitters had to ask many questions, thus giving\nthe statements to a great extent the appearance of telepathy from\ntheir own minds. The sitters were, however, convinced that Mrs\nMason has some supernormal faculty, though the limitations of her\nmediumship were very plain in this series of sittings.\n\f76 Journal of Society' for Psychical Research May 1930\nA SUBMERGED MEMORY REVIVED IN A DREAM.\nSome thirty-five years ago I was given a clog, a large white and tan\nspaniel wlio was eventually killed on a railway line. A few weeks\nago something recalled the dog to my memory, but I coukl not\nrecover his name.\nOn 5 February 1930 I had a short nap in my armchair and\ndreamed that this dog came into the room, came up to me and put\nhis head on my knee. I called out, \" Why, it's RoUo ! How are\nyou, Rollo, old man ?\n\" I then woke up and realized that the name\nreally was Rollo. Sir Harry \u00bbStephen, who gave me the dog, corro-\nborates this name.\nLawrence J. Jones.\nCORRESrONDENCE.\nA Correction.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014My attention has been called to an article in The Inter-\nnational Psychic Gazette, dated May 1930, on \" The Late Lord\nBalfour as Psychical Researcher.\" It consists in part of a letter\nfrom Sir Arthur Conan Doyle quoted from The Times of 29 March\n1930, and in part of a not very correct quotation from Mr Andrew\nLang's Introduction to a book on Crystal Gazing by Mr N. W.\nThomas. This last is quoted with a view to supporting Sir Arthur's\nstatement concerning Lord Balfour's activities in psychical research,\nand runs as follows :\n\" I lent the (crystal) ball to Miss Balfour, who often then saw, I\nthink, an old-fashioned piece of furniture (in it).\n\" Her brother (Mr Arthur Balfour) laughed at her and took the\nball into his study, when he returned, looking perplexed. He\nadmitted that he had seen (in it) a person whom he knew, under a\nlamp.\n\" This was about 5 p.m. on a Simday at St Andrews.\" The\naccount goes on to give details of the vision and its verification. \u2022\nOn reading this I was surprised, for my brother Lord Balfom- was\nextremely interested in \" psychical \" phenomena, and it was\nimpossible to suppose that he had had so interesting a \" psychical\n\"\nexperience as a crystal-vision (and that a veridical one) without\nmentioning it to his family, to whom he often did mention his regret\nthat he never had \" psychical \" experiences. I therefore looked up\nthe passage in Mr Thomas's book (Introduction, p. xii.) and then\nfound that what is there said is : \"I lent the ball to a Miss Balfour,\n\fMay 1930 Correspondence 77\nwho only then saw, I think, an old-fashioned piece of furniture.\nHer brother laughed at her and took the ball into the stu.dy. ...\"\nIt will be noticed that the word \" a \" before \" Miss Balfour \" is\nomitted in the article under discussion ; that the word \" often \" is\nsubstituted for \" only \" ; that the phrase \" (Mr Arthur Balfour)\nin brackets after \" brother \" does not occur in the original ;\nand\nthat his study \" is substituted for \" the study \" in the article.\nNo Christian names or .other identifying marks are given, and after\nall Balfoiu- is a fairly common name in the Lowlands of Scotland.\nOther statements show, or tend to show, that the Balfour alluded\nto was not Lord Balfour. In particular a little further down the\npage both in the book and as quoted in the International Psychic\nGazette, Mr Lang says \" afterwards in my study Mr Balfour, who was\nsmoking ...\" Lord Balfour was at no time of his life a smoker and\nonly on the rarest occasions smoked a cigarette. Further, I have\nshown the article to my sister Miss Alice Balfour who, as is well\nknown, kept house for Lord Balfour for over 50 years. She has no\nrecollection whatever of the occurrence in which a Miss Balfoi;r is\nstated to have played so prominent a part ; she never herself saw a\nvision in a crystal ; and she fully agrees with me that if Lord Balfour\nhad an experience of the kind described, he would have communi-\ncated the fact to his family.\nI may add that the same experience is described by Mr Andrew\nLang in his book on Dreams and Ghosts, but with other names for\nthe seer and the person seen. Presumably then in both books the\nnames given are pseudonjTXLS.\nWe must therefore regretfully conclude that the person referred\nto in book and article was not Lord Balfour, and as it is important\nin all matters connected with psychical research that incorrect\ntraditions should not be allowed to grow up so far as this can be\nprevented, I venture to trouble you with this letter.\nYours, etc.,\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nD. D. Home.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014It is a sad pity that Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\nshould have let 55 and 72 years elapse since D. D. Home's seances\nat Biarritz, and 43 years since his death, to attack his credibility as\na medium. An accusation of so flagrant a deception should have\nbeen made at the earliest possible moment, and before all the\nwitnesses had been removed beyond our questions by death, especially\nas (p. 251) the Empress's evidence is reported as contradictory.\n\f78 Jotirnai of Society for Psychical Research May idso\nThe evidence of \" professor \" Dicksomi, a conjurer, wlio, as Count\nPerovsky remarks, is not \" absolutely impartial \"\n(p. 257), seeing\nthat he himself speaks of his \" campagne acharnee \"\n(p. 264) against\nspiritualism, is entirely second-hand or third-hand, may be dis-\nregarded altogether. It was a mistake to allude to it at all. Accusa-\ntions should be as carefully criticised as affirmations. One would\nlike to ask for a plan of the room at Biarritz, and Iioav in the light a\ndoor behind the medium could have been opened without drawing\nthe attention of all the sitters to the fact. If the seance was in the\ndark, it is obvioiis that nothing could have been \" seen \" by Count\nFleury.\nDr Cyon says that the seance was held at Compiegne (whick\nCount Perovsky thinks a negligible slip of memory) and his evidence\nis also a mere repetition of Count Fleury who re-entered the lighted\nroom and saw Home entr'ouvrir la semelle de sa bottine droite\n\"\nor \" oter un de ses souliers \" (both are alleged), place his foot on the^\ncold marble floor and then \" with extraordinary agility \" touch the\nhand of the Empress seated on his left, causing, her to exclaim,\n\" The hand of a dead child has touched me,\" an extraordinary remark\nin any case !\nThe whole reads like an artless fabrication, and one can only\nwonder that the Empress should have been so easily deceived. I\nhave myself attended many of these wearisome seances and shoidd\nconsider \" pulling a dress, ringing a bell, and feeling about under a\ntable \" absolutely unevidential, as would all the reliable experi-\nmenters I have known.\nCount Perovsky quotes from Mr Podmore, who died in 1910, the\nwords concerning Home \" that bulwark and alpha and omega of\njjhysical phenomena with whom modern spiritualism must stand\nor fall \" as if these words, whenever they may have been written,,\nwere final.\nBut sm'ely, if physical phenomena be what is meant, such words\nare meaningless after the careful laboratory experiments of Dr\nGeley, Dr von Schrenck-Notzing, Dr Glen Hamilton, and Dr Crandon,.\nto name only a very few of the later observers. D. D. Home may\nnow be left out of accoimt on the general question without bringing\nsecond-hand and doubtful testimony to invalidate the evidence o\u00a3\nfifty persons of knowledge and position whose names and addresses\nare given in Lord Dunraven's book published in 1870 and lately\nreprinted by the S.P.R.\nI do not wish to vindicate my own well-founded conviction that\nphysical phenomena are positive facts which render nugatory all\ntendencious articles to the contrary ; nor am I specially concerned\nto defend Home or Stainton Moses nor any other medium whose\n\fMay 1930 Correspondence 79\nhonesty is assailed many years after their deaths. Of each of them\nmight be said,\nHe has outsoared the shadow of our night,\nEnvy and cakimny and hate and pain.\nAnd that unrest which men miscall delight\nCan touch him not and torture not again.\nFrom the contagion of the world's slow stain\nHe is secure ; and now can never mourn\nA heart grown cold, a head grown grey in vain !\nYours, etc.,\nS. DE Brath.\n[Count Perovsky writes : Mr S. De Brath thinks that it is \" a sad\npity\" that I should have let 55 and 72 years elapse since D. D. Home's\nsittings at Biarritz before attacking \" his credibility as a medimn.\"\nWell, 72 years ago I did not exist at all, and 55 years ago I was only\nfour years old ! And when D. D. Home died I had hardly begun to\ninterest myself in psychical research at all. All history is based on\nour discussing the activity of and passing judgement on people who\ndied years ago, sometimes many centuries ago. I do not feel in the\nleast inclined, I confess, to treat differently either D. D. Home or\nStainton Moses.\nIt is significant that, whilst speaking at length of Dicksonn and\nCyon. Mr De Brath does not once mention Dr Barthez's name, and\nthis though I expressly say (p. 251) :\n\" To me, however, Dr Barthez's\nevidence suffices.\"\nAnd it is, I confess, disconcerting to me at least to see Mr De Brath\nmention Dr Crandon's careful laboratory experiments \" as evi-\ndence for the reality and genuineness of physical phenomena.]\nNonsense Names.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In the Journal for January Mr Saltmarsh gives the result of\nan attempt to throw some light on the genesis of the nonsense names\nsupplied by \" Topsy,\" by asking a mmiber of persons to invent sets\nof such names. I wonder if this method affords a real parallel. If\nTopsy' s nonsense names should be \" thrown up by the dream\nconsciousness \" I should not expect them to develop on similar lines\nto those one would consciously invent, judging from my own experi-\nence. A dream I had some time back will illustrate my meaning.\nI was (in my dream) speaking to an employe in an office, and asking\nhim about his employers (I noted down on waking the events which\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May loso\nhad led up to this, but they are not relevant). \" Well,\" he said,\n\" I\\Ir Fark is so and so, but Mr Vickhorn is so and so.\" (The spelling\nof the names is as I visualised them on awaking). Now I am as\ncertain as can be th?^t I never saw or heard those names before ;\nand I am fairly certain that if I had set out to invent names as Mr\nSaltmarsh's experimenters were asked to do I should not have\narrived at anything so original. I should probably have invented\n\" associated \" names, or \" literary sounding \" ones, or a class which\nI think Mr Saltmarsh has not suggested, formed by taking a common\nname and altering the initial letter, or combining two syllables of\ndifferent names.\nThe experimenters were, it is true, asked to \" keep their minds as\nblank as possible,\" but I am not clear that invention woidd be\neliminated, fully at least, by this precaution.\nI feel some doubt, therefore, whether that method throws much\nlight on the actual origin of Topsy's nonsense names, at least if the\nexperimenters were similarly constituted to myself, who am obliged\nmournfully to recognize, by repeated experience, how much more\noriginal and swift my subconscious intelligence is than my conscious.\nYours, etc.,\nH. N. Dixon.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In connection with my article on nonsense names in a recent\nissue of the Journal (xxvi. 5) one of the participators in the experi-\nment has written to me with regard to the suggestion that the\nprevalence of names beginning with 0 \" in Mrs Elliott's sittings\nmight be due to an association, formed in childhood, with her own\nsurname. I had noticed with this participator that he had a\ntendency to start his names with \" P \" or \" Ph \" but as his surname\nbegan with a \" W \" I saw no support of my suggestion in his case.\nHe now informs me that his real surname actually begins with \" P,\"\nthe name by which I knew him being a \" non de plume.\" In so far\nas this single example goes it appears to lend some support to my\nsuggestion, although the fact that the letter \" P \" was often followed\nby an \" h \" rather diminishes from its value, for it must be by the\nsound of the letter that any association would be formed, and the\nsound of \" Ph \" is quite distinct from that of \" P \" alone. The\nmatter is of small importance though perhaps possessing some\ninterest as a psychological curiosity ; in any case we cannot\ngeneralise from so small a number of examples.\nYours, etc.,\nW. H. Saltmarsh.\n\fMat 1030 Corresjyoiidence 81\nCross-Correspondences\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014I did not know, until I had tlie letter recently circularized\nby the Society's officers, that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had expressed\nthe opinion that \" the Cross-correspondences are not of much value\";\nhut, if so, I am among those who agree with him on that point.\nWhen studying these, I have an uneasy feeling at the back of my\nmind that, given scholarship, a good reference library and plenty of\ntime, it would be possible to find some sort of cross-correspondence\nbetween almost any two or more passages. The only one of them\nthat made any real impression iipon me is that called \" Alexander's\nTomb \" {Proceedings, xxvii). On the other hand, the experiments in\nthe revival of literary knowledge. \" Lethe \" {Proceedings, xxiv, xxv),\n\" Statins \" {Proceedings, xxvii, called there \" Some Recent Scripts\nAffording Evidence of Personal Survival \") and The Ear of\nDionysius \" {Proceedings, xxix), have never ceased to impress me as\nbeing of extraordinary interest and importance, and I always feel\nsorry that the Society has not found it possible to pursue and\ndevelop that promising line of investigation.\nYours, etc.,\nHubert Wales.\nSHORT NOTICES.\nKarl Gruber, Okkultismus und Biologic.

B.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue ilelajjsychique, January-February 1930.\nThis number opens with a short and completely sceptical paper\nby Prof. Charles Richet dealing with Mme David-Neel's paper in\nthe Revue de Paris (see below). The same writer briefly describes\ntwo recent incidents in the experience of a friend of his to which\nhe is inclined to attribute a supernormal character\nThe jyiece de resistance of this number of the Revue Metapsychique\nis still Dr Osty's long paper (second instalment) on the \" Diagnosis\nof Diseases by subjects 'endowed with paranormal knowledge \".\nThe title is perhaps somewhat misleading, as many of the incidents\ndescribed have little or nothing to do with a medical diagnosis.\nTheir evidential value varies in my opinion a good deal. Some are\nundoubtedly very striking (especially case LX, where a dead body\nis \" clairvoyantly \" discovered by Mme Morel, one of Dr Osty's\nsubjects), and others much less so. We hear hardly anything, by\nthe way, of these subjects' \/ai?'Mfes, surely a most important factor.\nA very interesting case may have been that of M. Berteaux, a\nformer French Minister of War (died in 1911), to whom a fair\n\" pythoness \" is said to have foretold in 1874 that he would be\nGeneral-in-Chief and would be crushed to death by a \" flying car \"\n;\nand in fact M. Berteaux was killed by an aeroplane suddenly falling\n\fMay 1930 Notes on Periodicals 83\non the ground. Unfortunately the evidence as to the prediction\nleaves something to be desired. Prevision of the future in the strict\nsense of the word is so extraordinary and fer se improbable that its\nreality is never likely to be proved by such anecdotes, however\nstriking and exciting. We want something much superior in\nevidence.\nM. Pascal has a valuable paper on the influence of hashish on\nthe unconscious, passing in review the various aspects of that\ninfluence such as enhanced suggestibility, revelation of the subjects'\nsubconscious tendencies, psychological dedoublejnent, etc. It is\nsignificant that on awakening the subject remembers the sensations\nto which hashish had given rise.\nRevue Metapsychique, March-April 1930.\nDr Osty prints a third and last instalment of his paper on the\nsupernormal diagnosis of diseases. This instalment deals at con-\nsiderable length with the mistakes made by \" subjects endowed with\nparanormal knowledge.\" I confess that after reading it I do not\nthink it more difficult than I did before that the explanation of this\nparticular branch of \" metapsychics \" is to be sought purely and\nsimply in haphazard guessing. I would postulate possible super-\nnormal knowledge in a very, very limited number of cases only, and\nthis only tentatively, though I know that many investigators will\ndisagree with me.\nM. de Briey formulates some general ideas and practical sugges-\ntions in connection with dowsing ; and in a short paper entitled\n\" Mental Inertia,\" Dr Osty recalls the findings, favourable to animal\nmagnetism, of the Commission appointed in 1826 by the French\nAcademy of Medicine, which findings, however, subsequently had\nno effect whatever on the study of the subject by official science.\nAn article by M. Victor Forbin on fire-walking in South Africa,\nthe Hawai and Fiji Islands is quoted from the review Aristote\n(November 1929). The explanation is suggested that those walking\nthrough the fire are, it is alleged, protected against combustion by\n\" soles of steam,\" engendered by perspiration, forming themselves\nfor a short time on their feet. This \" explanation \" was given to\nM. Forbin by a Professor Schwartz. The text of an interesting letter\nfrom M. Th. Gautier, of Reunion, to Professor Ch. Richet is further\nprinted. It is asserted in this letter, dated 21 January 1930, that\nfire-walking occurs in that island regularly at the begiiming of\nJanuary, and two photographs (taken by M. Gautier) are appended,\none showing four men walking through the burning embers.\nRevue de Paris, December 1929.\nMme Alexandra David-Neel, author of several books on Thibet\nand Buddhism, the last in date being Mystiques et magiciens de\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1930\nThibet, has a paper on \" Psychical Phenomena in Thibet \". It is\nasserted in it inter alia that \" telepathic transmissions both willed\nand unconscious do not seem to be very rare \" in that country,\nMme David-Neel adding that as far as she is concerned, she is\nconvinced she did receive telepathic messages from lamas with\nwhom she had been in touch. No instances are given. (Two\nexperiences of this type are however described in Mystiques et\nMagiciens, pp. 238-242). A further part of the same paper is\ndevoted to \" materialisations \", perhaps a somewhat misleading\nterm, since hallucination is not excluded, though in two of the\nepisodes narrated it may\u2014or must\u2014have been collective. (One\nmore case is described in Mysti(f!es et Magiciens, pp. 295-297, but\nhere it is difficult to feel sure that we have not to deal with an in-\nstance of mistaken identity ; if not, the \" materialisation \" or\ncollective hallucination appears to have been coupled with a\npremonition.) On the whole and though Mme David-Neel's paper\nis singularly devoid of evidential facts, I do not quite agree with\nM. Richet's sweepingly negative verdict (see above).\nZeitschrift fiir Parapsychologie, March 1930.\nThis number opens with another instalment (profusely illustrated\nwith diagrams) of Professor Chr.

The epithet seems to me\nexaggerated, seeing that the phenomenon occurred in total darkness,\nthat the medium was seated at a certain distance from the circle,\nno one holding her hands, and that the apport consisted of a dozen\nold picture postcards. It seems on the other hand to have coincided\nwith an electrical phenomenon which greatly impressed the sitters.\nApports in the presence of another medium, Heinrich Melzer, are\nnarrated by Herr Hans Schubert.\nFrau Aue-Pogatschnigg, an Austrian now living in Sweden,\nrelates some incidents in her own experience ; and several gentlemen\n(Dr Ludwig Welisch, Dr Dorfler, Prof. Walter) take exception to a\nstatement of Mr Besterman's about a Herr \" Rondon \" (Kordon)\nin our Proceedings, xxxiii. 450.\nDr Gerda Walther has a short paper on Rudi Schneider's recent\nsittings in the National Laboratory for Psychical Research, in which\nshe sees a \" brilliant confirmation \" of the late Dr von Schrenck-\nNotzing's researches with the same medium.

Mr H.\nDennis Bradley (editor), Herr Florizel von Renter, Prof. Johannes\nKasnacich, Dr Gustav Zeller, Herr Konrad Schuppe and Dr Siinner\njoin in attempting to vindicate the medium's reputation and to\nprove that there was no exposure. I note in passing that Mr Bradley\nincidentally speaks (p. 18) of his own mediimiship and of that of his\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research May 1930\nwife for \" direct voices \" : a circumstance whicli to many will\nappear as of some importance in appraising the value of his testi-\nmony in the matter. He also mentions that Mrs Bradley was\naccused of simulating a phenomenon at one of the Genoa sittings\nwith Valiantine, though adding that the accusation was afterwards\nwithdrawn (pp. 63, 64).\nDr Zeller admits (p. 89) that in Berlin as well as in Millesimo the\nconditions of control did not correspond to up-to-date psychical\nresearch standards, which is but another way of saying that from the\nscientific standpoint both the series of sittings were quite worthless.\nAfter that admission it becomes a question of secondary importance\nwhether Dr Kroner was or was not, strictly speaking, justified in\nasserting that Valiantine had been exposed in Berlin. In any case,\nin view chiefly of Frau von D.'s (the hostess) precise and categorical\nstatements about the three private sittings she had with Valiantine,\nit cannot reasonably be doubted that some at least of his \"pheno-\nmena \" were palpably fraudulent.\nZagadnienia Metapsychiczne, 1929, nos. 23-24.\nThis number opens with a paper by M. J. Switkowski insisting\non the difference existing between hypnotism and magnetism and\nspecially criticising the views in this respect of the late Prof. Leh-\nmann of the University of Copenhagen. Dr Klesk's article on\npsychographology deals especially with the well-known Raphael\nSchermann, on whom the highest praise is bestowed. Dr Sokolowski\nnarrates various incidents in connection with a medium called\nGeorge L, occurring in 1924-1927. Several possibly supernormal\nincidents in the life of M. K. are related by M. Wyczalkowski, of\nwhich one may have been a premonition occurring in a dream some\nfive minutes before the actual fact. Short reports on the activities\nin 1929 of the different Polish Societies for Psychical Research (in\nWarsaw two and one in Lwow) are printed.\nTwo papers (by M. Prosper Szmurlo and M. St. Rzewuski) on\ntelepathic experiments systematically carried on between Warsaw\nand Athens (October 1928-May 1929) constitute the ]nece de resistance\nof this number. Thirty seances were held, 118 collective attempts\nwere made, the number of individual ones being much higher.\nThose which dealt with the transmission of colours and scenes are\nregarded as unsatisfactory ; it is maintained on the contrary that\nin the transference of drawings results above what might have been\ndue to chance coincidence were obtained. M. Rzewuski's paper\ncontains an instructive series of tables dealing with the subject,\nwhilst M. Szmurlo's is accompanied with reproductions of some of\nthe most striking results obtained.\nP.-P.-S.\n\fMat 1930 Notes on Periodicals 87\nPsychica, January 1930.\nThe editor, Mme Bordeiieux, describes one of the public sittings\ngiven by Pascal Fortbuny, at which an accomplice was found giving\nhim private signals as to the nature of the subject decided on for\ntelepathic transmission to him by the audience. Mme Bordeneux,\nw^ho has hitherto been one of M. Forthnny's warmest supporters, is\nto be congratulated on her courage in publishing these facts. But\nit is a little strange that we have had to wait till now to learn that\nForthuny has been previously detected in specific instances of\nfraud.\nPsychica, March 1930.\nA letter is printed from M. Forthuny, in which he denies the\nstatements of Mme Borderieux, alleging prejudice and the like.\nThe editor's reply cites other suspicious incidents and quotes various\nobservations of M. Forthuny's which do not redound to his credit.\nThe Science of Life, Parts 28-30.\nThis is a useful work having as its object the presentation of\nbiology in a popular but accurate way. The authors are Mr H. G.\nWells, Professor Julian Huxley, and Mr G. P. Wells. In parts 28-30\nsome attention is given to psychical research. It is attention of a\ndistinctly self-conscious and patronising kind, but not more so than\nwas to be expected from Mr Wells's past pronouncements on the\nsubject. On the whole the writers are soundly critical and manage\nto bring in a good many names and allusions to the literature of\npsychical research with substantial accuracy. There is a mistake,\nhowever, in the initials of Kichard Hodgson, and it is scarcely\nadequate to describe Mrs Verrall as a celebrated medium.\"\nThe chapter on \" Human Behaviour and the Human Mind \" has\na section entitled Automatism and Mediumship.\" The nature of\nAutomatism and Control is explained, as well as the adequacy of\nnormal psychological explanations of these phenomena in themselves.\nIn part 30 an entire chapter is devoted to Borderland Science\nand the Question of Personal Survival.\" The real problems of\nsurvival, however, are not seriously attempted, the best types of\nevidence being barely mentioned or not at all. The supernormal\nphenomenon treated with most favour is, curiously enough, \" dream\nanticipation,\" and that on the basis of Mr Dunne's book, which is\nscientifically without value. The treatment of telepathy is scrappy\n.and rather \"dogmatically sceptical. No attempt is made to estimate\nthe evidence, beyond various allusions (in which Mr Wells's pen is\nto be detected) to its volume.\nUnder the inappropriate heading of \" Clairvoyance, Table-\ntapping, and Telekinesis,\" spirit-communications are dealt with.\n\f88 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research mat i930\nThe discussion consists largely of severe, though very just, criticisms\nof such types of Control as Pheneas of Ur. Materialization and tele-\nplasm are treated with a good deal more approval. Here again the\nemphasis is wrong. Thus, the Eva C. phenomena are considered\nto be more import.ant and actually to be recorded in more detail,\nthan those of Eusapia Palladino, and those of Margery to be more\nimportant than either. The fact is, of course, that the S.P.R.\nPalladino re])ort is by far the best and the most detailed report on\nphysical phenomena yet produced. In discussing the Margery case\nthe writers maintain a \" right to incredulity \" though they \" cannot\nabsolutely reject the evidence for these phenomena.\" Here, as\nthroughout these sections dealing with psychical research, there is\nclear evidence of a conflict of opinion betv,-een the writers. On the\nwhole, however, the conflict has been successfully resolved, and in\ngeneral a praiseworthy suspension of judgement is exercised by the\ncollaborators.\nTh.

The medium was not in trance.\nAfter describing a \" form of a lady only partly building up \" and\nstating that she seemed to be very worried about a man connected\nwith her who had been ill and in consequence feeling very lonely and\ndepressed, the medium gave further impressions concerning him\nwhich are omitted here as irrelevant to the case under review.\nShe continued, \" I believe he must only just be pulling himself\ntogether, because she shows me\u2014do you know who I see ?\n'\nthe still\nsilent man.' It's him that she is showing, sitting sort of slightly\ndoubled up, sitting about. It is him I see and I believe he is sitting\nin a room which is rather oblong and which has a window at the back\n\fJune 1930 Deferred Impression during a Trance Sitting\nof him, seems small panes, and I believe it is fairly higli up\u2014seema\nto be higb up, fairly high from the ground, probably higher than\nthis [the medium indicates her own room which is on the first floor].\nThere seems to be trees, and yet I don't feel that I am in the country\n\u2014I feel I am surrounded with houses. It is one of those what I call\nstuffy rooms, you can't move for furniture. I am almost sure that\nlady is connected with him.\"\nThe article which was used at this sitting, was contributed by\nMr Ashton, to whom a copy of the notes was sent in which the\nleference to the '\nstill silent man '\nwas omitted. He annotated it\nas follows : \"I cannot, even remotely, connect any part of this\nreport with my late wife, who owned the article and which she used\nahnost daily.\" [Dated 11 February 1927].\nThe notes were also sent to Mr Montgomery Smith, an anonymous\n.sitter who was ahvays referred to by the medium as '\nthe still silent\nman.' Mr Montgomery Smith wrote to the Secretary, on his receipt\nof the record, as follows :\n\" I am immensely interested in it. It has\nno bearing at all on present conditions, but if referred to conditions\nprevailing a year ago it is in several points astoundingly accurate.\nI think you will be interested when you read my notes.\" [Dated\n3 February 1927].\nMr Montgomery Smith had had two sittings with Mrs Elliot, one\non 7 October 1926 and one on 11 November 1926. A study of the\nnotes of these sittings shows that most of the contents in the\nAbsent sitter \" sitting on 1 February 1927, might be considered as\nleminiscent of these sittings. The only new material is that follow-\ning the medium's recognition of ' the still silent man.'\nThe sitter's annotations of these previous sittings show that he\n-was seriously ill in December 1925 and January 1926, and in a\n\u2022despondent and hopeless state of mind ; he was suffering in fact\nfrom a breakdown following the shock of his wife's sudden death in\nISTovember 1925. He stated that on 1 February 1926, he was practi-\ncally well again but very weak. His annotation of the new material\nis as follows :\n\" Accurate description of room. I used to sit a good\ndeal after breakfast (and indeed do now while I smoke a pipe) in the\ndining room which is on the top floor, (3rd). It is oblong ;\nit has a\nwindow of small panes and I always sit with my back to this. It\nhas rather a lot of furniture and, as my brother-in-law's children use\nit as a playroom, it is rather encumbered with a lot of their things,\nm that moving about is rather restricted. There are two pieces of\nold furniture, a chair and an oak chest.\n\" This house is in a Square, and the window looks on the Square\ngarden. Early in February last year, 1926, the garden had several\nlarge trees. These were cut down a few weeks later and replaced by\nsaplings, so the garden is now less suggestive of country.\"\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research June 1930\nThe Secretary's note dated 16 May 1927, and written up from\nnotes made on 7 April 1927, is as follows : \"On April 7tli I saw the\nroom which. Mrs Dixon [Mr Montgomery Smith's sister-in-law, in\nwhose house he had been living since his wife's death] and Mr Mont-\ngomery Smith identified with the description given at the '\nAbsent\nSitter '\nsitting, No. 54. It is a slightly oblong room (about 15 x 13-\npaces). The room has the appearance of being more oblong than it\nreally is, owing partly perhaps to the arrangement of the furniture^\nand partly to the position of the door and window, which almost,\nface one another and are placed about the middle of the longer walls.\nThe chair in which Mr Montgomery Smith used to sit stands to the-\nleft of the fireplace with its back to the window. The window has-\nold-fashioned square panes, with perpendicular bars outside, and\nit looks on to trees, the house being in a Square with a central\ngarden. The room is on the third floor.\n\" The Square is oblong, and open only on one side, the north,\nwhich is formed by a biisy thoroughfare. The east and the west\nare the long sides. Mrs Dixon's house is in the middle of the south\nside, furthest removed from the sounds of traffic, and facing the long\nnarrow length of the garden. Mrs Dixon told me that eight or nine\nlarge old trees were cut down in the Spring of 1926, i.e., soon after\nthe period that seems to have been indicated at the sitting. The\nbranches of some of these had come close to her windows.\n\" The room contains a good deal of furniture ; in addition to the\ngenuine old pieces mentioned by Mr Montgomery Smith there are\nseveral modern imitations of old furniture.\"\nThe question might arise whether the article used at the sitting\nmight not have reminded the medium of one used previously and\ncontributed by Mr Montgomery Smith. It was a very large^\npractical house-keeping purse with the appearance of having been\nmuch used. Mr Montgomery Smith had contributed several\narticles, none of which would suggest a resemblance.\nIt is an interesting coincidence that the contributor of the article\nand the man with whom the sitting was concerned were the only\ntwo among our sitters and contributors of articles who were classified\ntogether as representing sitters \" Recently bereaved, with utter\nsense of loss.\" This coincidence may be purely accidental. It\nsuggests however the question whether the article contributed may\nnot have carried with it an influence which the mediimi subcon-\nsciously associated with '\nthe still silent man,' and which roused a\nlatent impression which she may have subconsciously received at\none of the previous sittings.\n\fJune 1930 'rite Case of a Damaged Gravestone 93\nTHE CASE OF A DAMAGED GEAVESTONE.\nM. 109.\nThe following case has been brouglit to our notice through the inter-\nmediary of Mr E. L. Vaughan, a Member of the Society, who wrote :\n\" I enclose a statement of an old friend Mrs Sparkes whom I\ncasually met a few days ago. I have known her over forty years and\nhave always looked upon her as particularly matter-of-fact. The\nlast person I should have thought, to give way to flights of imagina-\ntion. 1 also knew her husband fairly intimately. I had lost touch\nwith them for some years. On discovering that 1 had an open mind\non the subject, she related a number of experiences of which the\nenclosed is, 1 think, sufficiently remarkable and specific to bring to\nyour notice.\" [Letter dated 24 March 1930.]\nThe statement by Mrs. Sparkes is as follows :\n\" My late husband died in May 1929. He is buried at Shamley\nGreen near Guildford.\n\" I ordered a firm of Monimiental Masons to erect a Cross over the\ngrave. They wrote last January that this had been done, and sent\ntheir bill.\n\" My custom is to pay all bills at once. My impulse was, accord-\ningly, to, then and there, send a cheque.\n\" A communicator purporting to be my late husband has been in\nthe habit of sending me messages since his death. I scribble them\ndown on bits of paper or in a note-book.\n\" While I contemplated sending the cheque\u2014I was holding a\npencil not waiting for any message or thinking of anything in\nparticular, when it wrote :\n'\nSee to my grave at Shamley Green. I\nsee a crack at the base of the right side of the cross.' I asked '\nDo\nyou mean on the right side when facing the cross ?\n'\nHe answered\n'\nYes. It is on the right side standing on the path. I see a crack at\nthe lower part. The words are all right on the stone. Do not pay\nfor it until it is mended. Your name will be there [Note by Mrs\nSparkes : I have intended being buried in the same grave when my\ntime comes.] and I do not like it. Do not go on with the payment\nuntil it is attended to, or it vnll not be done.'\n\" I refrained then from sending the cheque. I did so somewhat\nreluctantly as it worries me to have any bill owing. I expected\nhowever to be able to see the grave without any delay\u2014as soon as it\nstopped raining in fact\u2014for the weather was bad and I had a cold\nat the time.\n\"As the days passed without my being able to go, I got more and\nmore restive at not paying the bill or even acknowledging receipt of\nit. Eventually I felt I must take some notice of the receipt of it,\nso wrote that I would settle it as soon as I had seen the Cross.\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1930\n\" The firm was of the highest standing and its charges, 42 guineas\nfor the stone alone, seemed to prechide any reasonable possibility\nof bad work, so I might have sent the cheque to have done with it,\nbut that the messages kept coming. The estimate was for '\nthe best\ncut granite.'\n\" The Cross as ordered, was to be a copy of one seen elsewhere and\nput up by the same firm. The design was : a cross standing on\nthree superimposed blocks of granite. The original was beautiful.\nMy husband's shows bad work. On at last seeing the monument I\nfound a gash three inches long, one inch wide, and one inch deep on\nthe lowest block on the right hand side facing the path.\"\nThe actual script referred to by Mrs. Sparkes has been seen by\nMiss Newton, and runs as follows :\n\" See to . . . stone at the grave and go a ground side of the grave\nto the right side of the stone\n\" at one side of the stone I see a crack do not pay for it until it is\nmended as your name will be that side and I do not like it. You\nmust go to the vicar and tell him about it at once or it will not be\ndone\n\" You will see a crack at the base of the stone do not go on with\nthe payment until it is attended to or it will not be done I see a\ncrack at the base of the right side of the cross at the side you are at\non the path See to it.\n\" Yes, yes, it is on your right side ... as on the path I see a crack\nat the lower part I see a\n\" Yes. Yes, Yes, the words are right on the stone it is the crack\nat the right side on the base it is at a good \" [the next word is\nillegible].\nMiss Newton has interviewed Mrs Sparkes and ascertained that\nMrs Sparkes had had no news of the progress of the stone between\nordering it and hearing that it was completed. None of her friends\nhad seen it in the meantime, nor did she know anyone who had\nvisited the cemetery at Shamley Green after the stone was put up.\nMrs Sparkes also stated that she had no recollection whatever of\nhaving previously seen a similar defect in a tombstone, nor of\nanything that had caused her to associate such a defect with the\ngranite of which the stone is made. She never went to cemeteries\nas she disliked them.\nThe manufacturers of the gravestone were commimicated with\nand confirmed the date of the erection of the gravestone as 22 January\n1930, that Mrs Sparkes was probably advised within a day or so,\nsubsequently, and that the stone bore a tool mark, and that the\nstone was entirely made at their works in Exeter.\nThe gravestone in Shamley Green cemetery was examined on\n12 May 1930 by Dr Woolley and Mrs Brackenbuxy, who confirm that.\n\fJune 1930 The Case o f a Damayed Gravestone '\n95\non the right side of the stone, facing it from the path, there is \" a\ndefect in the granite [which] had been filled up with cement and\nfrom the outline of this defect it has the appearance of a tool mark\nrather than a crack.\" There are one or two other minor tool\nmarks on the stone.\nThe evidence seems to show that Mrs Sparkes received a genuinely\nveridical impression of the mark on the gravestone. Though\nwhether her impression was received by thought-transference from\none of the workmen or others knowing of the mark, by clairvoyance,\nor from a spirit intermediary, must be left an open question.\nA PHANTASM OF THE DEAD CONVEYING INFORMATION\nUNKNOWN TO THE PERCIPIENT.\nBy Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n[The age of this case would as a rule exclude it from the Journal,\nbut in view of its special interest as belonging to a rare type of\nincident, it has been thought useful to record it. Ed.]\nIn January 1930 I made the acquaintance of a Mme. K. of\nBessarabia (now in Rimiania, a Russian province from 1812 to 1917),\nwho related to me a very startling case of post-mortem apparition\nhappening to her uncle, M. Platon Biberi, a Bessarabian landowner\n(address : Of. post. Secureni, Jud. Hotin, Bessarabia). I therefore\nwrote to this gentleman, who kindly replied giving all the information\nin his power.\nAs will be seen from his second letter, in which he answered my\nsecond letter, the evidence unfortunately cannot be made as satis-\nfactory as S.P.R. standards require, but I think the case sufficiently\nstriking as it is. M. Biberi's first letter narrates several other\napparently supernormal incidents, most of them also very curious,\nbut the Alexander Scordelli case appears to me of quite exceptional\ninterest : it contains, as my readers will see, precise information\ngiven by the apparition on a point completely unknown to the per-\ncipient and outside the scope of chance-coincidence. Some will\neven say on two points, but so far as the slippers are concerned, the\namount of coincidence does not seem to me sufficiently striking\nto warrant a supernormal explanation. As to the size of the coffin,\nmay I say that this episode\u2014if we suppose it to have occurred as\ndescribed\u2014seems to me of peculiar value as discrediting, in the\npresent case, the theory of post-mortem action at the time of the\napparition ? For it is surely highly mlikely that the \" spirit \" of\na deceased human being should be preoccupied to such an extent\nwith the position of his remains in the coffin sixty days after his\n\" passing away \" ! On the other hand I can well imagine that some\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1930\nhuman being just dead\u2014supposing his self still to exist in some form\nsomewhere\u2014deeply impressed by what is happening to his dead\nbody and \" telepathing \" accordingly, whether consciously or\nunconsciously. In which case this Scordelli-Biberi episode would\nafford us a good instance of deferred telepathic impression between\nthe dead and the living. (Telepathy from the living alone cannot\nof course be regarded as excluded here).^\nM. Platan Biheris ^ letter of 10 February 1930 {in part).\n... In August 1912 and at his request I brought Alexander\nScordelli, a nephew of mine, into the Britchany zemstvo hospital,\nwhere his state was acknowledged by the physicians to be hopeless\n(he had consumption). Feeling probably that he would not see me\nagain, he thanked me, when saying goodbye, for all and asked me\nnot to forget his daughter, a pupil of one of the Kishinev [Chisinau\nin Rumanian] colleges. Two months later, on a dark October\nevening, a physician of the Britchany hospital telephoned to me :\n\" Poor Scordelli has just died.\" The very dense mud and an\nailment did not permit me to make twenty versts [13 miles] to\nattend his funeral.\nTwo months later (again) I left for Kishinev on business, stopping\nfor twenty-four hours at Beltzy, Bessarabia, on the way.\nI put up at the same inn as usual, went to bed at the regular\ntime, but having put out the light in my room, could not fall asleep\nat once on account of the servants noisily running in the passage,\nthe electric bells ringing and an electric arc-light hissing.\nAs it seemed to me, I was beginning to lose consciousness before\nfalling asleep. I then suddenly commenced perceiving distinctly,\namong other sounds in the passage, a characteristic shuffling of\nslippers, as if a man with feeble gait were approaching the door of\nmy room. When these footsteps stopped before the door, which I\nhad locked, I felt and understood that the visitor was none other\nthan the late Alexander Scordelli. I was seized with fear and\ncovered myself with the counterpane, head included. I then heard\nhim grasping the door handle, beginning to move it and saying :\n\" Open, Uncle, open.\" As I did not answer his request :\n\" Do you\nnot think I can pass through the door ?\n\" he said. Frightened at\nsuch a possibility and making a big effort, I asked him :\n'\nWhat\nI I know of two other incidents where circumstances relating to the external\nappearance or position of the dead body seem to have become prima facie\nknown to the '\nspirit \" supposed to have once animated it. One is narrated in\ndetail in Proceedings, vi. 17. The second I briefly referred to in the Journal,\nxxiv. 264.\n' M. Biberi is now, as he informs me, in his 65th year. This letter, in\ncommon with the following one, has been translated by me from the original\nBussian.\n\fJune 1930 A Phantasm of the Dead 97\n\u2022doest thou want from me ? Speak !\n\" And then the answer came :\n\" Put me in properly ; the coffin is narrow, the coffin is short.\"\nAfter repeating these words twice in a voice already dull and faint\ni.e went slowly away, his slippers still shuffling.\nIn May 1913 (the next year) I happened to go on business to\nBritchany, the borough where Scordelli had died half a year before.\nA woman was waiting on me in my room [at the inn] whose face\nI seemed to know, but without remembering where I had seen her.\nAs she noticed this :\n\" Sir, you probably do not recognise me ?\n\"\nshe asked. \" I was ward-servant in the hospital when you brought\nthe late Scordelli in.\" Feeling that I might learn something of\ninterest from her in connection with the Beltzy apparition, I asked\nlier to tell me how he died. \" Well, he died as I was attending him\n[literally :\n\" on my arms \"]. I held the taper ^ for him, I washed\nhis body after his death and attended his funeral. They buried him\nin his new clothes and with slippers on, for it was difficult already to\nput boots on his feet. One thing was bad : no special coffin was\nordered and he was put into a hospital coffin, such as are kept for\nemergency purposes. Well, this coffin proved to be so narrow and\nshort, that when he was being laid into it, the bones cracked. . .\n.\"\nM. Platon Biberi's letter of 18 March 1930.\nMuch Esteemed Count,\nI did not answer your last letter before, hoping to find out\nthe woman who had given me evidence as to the way in which\nAlexander Scordelli had been buried.\nUnfortunately I have not succeeded in finding this woman. The\n\u2022case is now almost eighteen years old, and it is not known where she\nis now, nay whether she is alive in general.\nI can only confirm the genuineness of her account.\nIn answer to the questions you have put me, I can say the\nfollowing :\n(1) The apparition in question took place two months, not four,\nafter the death.\n^\n(2) Undoubtedly it occurred not whilst I was sleeping, but in a\nstate of some torpor before sleep, which admitted of my hearing and\nfeeling everything, but did not permit me to move.\n(3) In the cases when inexplicable phenomena occurred to me,\nthey were completely fulfilled later on, I may say, and in most\ncases after a brief space of time.\n^ [This probably refers to the prayers said by the bedside of dying people.\nP.-P.-S.]\n^ [On re-reading M.

I thought it had rather interesting points, and is mostly\nuseful I think in showing with what care the evidence for booktests\nshould be weighed. This one was done as a joke more or less, but\nit had quite as much success as the average booktest, and made a\nvery distinct impression on the \" sitter,\" who was new to this line\nof country.\nMrs Everett, a friend of mine here, asked me to tea to meet a\nDr Kendrew who wanted to hear about S.P.R. subjects. He had\nnever heard of booktests, and I was describing how they were\nworked. I said, \" The medium would tell you, for instance, to take\nthe third book from the left from the third shelf in the bookcase\nwhich faces you when you go into your consulting room, and on page\n3 you will find the word '\nbridge '\nor something connected with the\nword bridge.\" I suddenly felt that I had such a clear picture of the\nbookcase that I added, partly for fun, as I thought it would be so\nentertaining if I scored a bull, \" Do look when you get home and\nlet me know the result.\"\nA few days later Dr Kendrew wrote that he had looked in the\nplace, page, and book described, and found the word \" Roberts-\nbridge.\" He came to see me shortly after this, and seemed much\nstruck with the coincidence, though he left it in the balance so to\nspeak. I deepened the impression made by telling him that his\nbookcase was not up to the ceiling, but only the ordinary bookcase\nheight (right), that it had untidy things and a few books on the top\n^ [This incident is narrated at length in M. Biberi's earlier letter to me.\nThe prediction came true in January 1929, 16 years and one week after the\ndream. Mme K., M. Biberi's niece, has stated to me that she (repeatedly, I\nthink) had heard of this premonitory dream before its fulfilment.\nThe first sentence of answer (3) replies to my enquiry whether M. Biberi ever\nhad inexplicable experiences not corresponding to actual facts (this to test the\nprobability of chance-coincidence). P.-P.-S.]\n\fJune 1930 Correspondence 99\nshelf (right), and tliat I saw something long rather like a bone, only\nI knew it wasn't a bone, leaning at this ^ ^ angle on the top (there was\nsomething leaning at that angle but it was a tennis racket and on the\nbottom shelf).\nIsn't this a perfectly typical incident ? The word \" bridge\n\"\nfound in the proper place, myself with a definite feeling of having\nseen the bookcase, the \" sitter \" impressed at the strange coincidence,\nand the bad shot at the racket so typical too.\nHad Dr Kendrew been coached to regard me as a reliable medium,\nand had he had emotional reasons to welcome an incident proving\nknowledge of his home surroundings, I think it would have affected\nhim definitely towards belief. For myself, though I feel chance is\nquite the most likely explanation, I cannot shake myself free from\nimagining that, as I have had clairvoyant experiences, that this may\nbe another of them, even though my more sensible self realises how\nlikely it is that the description of the bookcase would fit nine con-\nsulting rooms out of ten, and that my being a good visualiser would\naccount for the apparent clearness of my mental impression.\nAnother school might consider telepathy from the mind of the sitter,\nwho said he had read the book, a guide book of the district, though\nhe had no conscious knowledge of it.\nMrs Everett is witness to the incident, and you could have Dr\nKendrew's letter. Of course I have never been to Dr Kendrew's\nhouse. ,^\nYours, etc.,\nIna Jephson.\n[In connexion with this letter it appears desirable to point out\nthat no general inference for or against the supernormal origin of\nbooktests can be drawn from a single incident. As Miss Jephson\nherself points out, it would be possible to argue that her success was\ndue to a flash of clairvoyance. The evidence at present available\nsuggests that the amoimt of success obtained in booktests given by\nMrs Leonard is beyond what can be attributed to chance (see, e.g.,\n\" On the Element of Chance in Book-Tests,\" Proceedings, xxxiii.\n606-20).

Stockwell Ltd., 1930.\nPrice 7s. 6d. net.\nIn the Introduction the author states that European history is a\ndrama in which every Act is a cycle of spiritual change, and his\npurpose is to show \" that the principle revealed by the drama is\ncontinuous, uniform and causative ; historical phases being the\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June 1930\ndirect results of a definite law of spiritual consequence.\" In the\nbody of the book lie traces the course of empires and civilisations on\nthese lines, quoting from many authors, with adequate references.\nThe material has been carefully collected and the story has been well\ntold. The author also traces the development of Christianity,\nshowing its connection with secular history. Much of its initial\nsuccess was due to the assurance of the resurrection of Jesus and of\nthe continuous life of His followers after physical death, also to\nbelief in the supernormal phenomena recorded by the early writers.\nFinally he considers how the process of decay can be arrested\nbefore the civilisation of to-day is destroyed like the systems of the\npast, for its present condition is precarious. He declares that as\nthe cumulative action of individuals composes the movements of\ncommtmities the only hope is that there may be a widespread\ndevelopment of spirituality, a \"change of heart..\" In this connection\nhe trusts that some aid may come from psychical research and\nthe growth of New Thought as set forth by J. Troward (pp. 205-209).\nIn discussing the former subject (pp. 193-198), he compares the\nanimistic and philosophic theories of the cause of phenomena. He\nhopes that \" metapsychic \" facts may open the mind of the mass of\nmankind to the survival and possibilities of the human soul and\nthat New Thought may eventually be spread through churches,\nschools and the press (p. 218). It is a suggestive argument and will\nappeal to many who deplore the growth of materialism.\nA. W. Trethewy.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nZeitsclrrift fur Parapsijchologie, May 1930.\nHerr Rudolf Lambert reviews Prof. Hyslop's experiments with\nMrs Chenoweth (Mrs Minnie Soule), which, he thinks, afford striking\nevidence of supernormal power. I do not propose to demur to these\nconclusions in the least, partly on account of the facts themselves,\npartly because I much value the opinion of so reasonable a critic as\nHerr Lambert. It seems to me, however, that he passes a little\ntoo lightly over such a difficulty as the general avoiding of surnames\nin trance-communications ; and he certainly takes no notice of the\nfact that whilst surnames are rarely, in fact hardly ever given,\nChristian names occur constantly. On what supernormal theory, I\nmay ask, can such a strange feature of these trance-utterances be\nexplained ?\nProfessor Winther brings to a close his account of his telekinetic\nexperiments with his Danish medium. Dr Simsa narrates some\np)hysical phenomena of a spontaneous character which he observed\nin Prague in the B. family. The supposed mediums were two,\n\fJune 1930 Xotes on Periodicals 101\nbrother and sister. The manifestations were very varied in character,\nbut many more details would be desirable before expressing an\nopinion as to the genuineness or otherwise of those Dr Simsa wit-\nnessed. I need not explain how much the supposed \" spontaneous\n\"\ncharacter of the performance complicates investigation worthy of\nthe name ; nor need I recall that Dr Simsa seems to have been\npreviously favourably impressed with \" phenomena \" as to whose\nspurious character there is little doubt.\nDr Otto Seeling has a short paper on Eric Jan Hanussen's alleged\n\" clairvoyant \" (public) performances in Berlin ; and Dr Bernouilli\nreviews the Kroner-Bradley controversy about Valiantine. He\nthinks mistakes may have been made on both sides, and concludes\nwith the hope that Valiantine may before long produce genuine\nphenomena under good conditions of control.\nIn Kleine Mitteilungen the translation of a letter by Mr Salter is\nprinted with Herr R. Lambert's reply. The letter bears on the\nVeley case. The question is a delicate one, but I may say that I\ncertainly agree with Herr Lambert that a report bearing on facts\nof a rare character and which jjer se may be convincing for those only\nwho know the medium intimately has no scientific value. On the\nother hand I am afraid it is rather difficult \" to draw the line\n\"\nanywhere in this domain if one tries to be thoroughly logical.

H. Salter read a report on \" The Recent Congress at\nAthens,\" of which a brief summary is printed below.\nSOME INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLTERGEISTS.^\nBy Dr V. J. Woolley.\nThe term Poltergeist has been used for a long time to describe a\nparticular kind of supposed haunting of a house or a person, a\nhaunting which is noisy and often mischievous in character and\nwhich may sometimes result in a good deal of damage to property,\nparticularly property which is at all fragile or easily destructible.\nWhether or not such disturbances are ever really caused by\nsupernormal agencies I do not propose here to inquire. I am only\nconcerned with a limited mmiber of cases which have occurred during\nthe last few years and which have been examined by representatives\nof the Society, and in none of these has it appeared necessary to\nassume that any supernormal agency was concerned. I propose to\ngive some account of the details of these cases as they were first\nreported and as they appeared on examination, and finally to offer\nsome suggestions as to the motives which led the various people\nconcerned to act as they did.\nThe first case came to our notice early in 1928. The house con-\ncerned is situated in South West London and the disturbances\ngained an immense notoriety in the press at the time.\nThe family consisted of an aged father, his three daughters and\na^son, all between 30 and 40, and a boy of 14, the son of one of the\ndaughters. The disturbances had begun some months previously\nby the throwing into the back garden and against the back windows\nof the house of various small hard objects such as coal and potatoes.\nI do not propose to put forward any view as to the agency involved,\nsince it could only be a surmise, but there seemed to be several\ndifferent groups of people who had the opportunity and, in varying\ndegrees, a motive.\n^ Summary of a paper read to a Private Meeting of the Society, 2 April 1930.\n\fJuly 1930 Some Investigations into Poltergeists 105\nAfter about a month of these external disturbances similar things\nbegan to happen indoors, directed mainly against the old father\nwho, wherever he went, was followed by showers of coal, soda and\npotatoes. He became so terrified that he wore his hat and overcoat\nall day and sometimes took refuge under the kitchen table.\nOn Christmas Day 1927, the family appealed to the police who\npaid several visits to the house at intervals. As soon as a police-\nman entered the house the disturbances ceased, but generally began\nagain when he left.\nTowards the middle of January 1928 several pieces of furniture\nwere broken by falling, no one being able to say how the falls were\nbrought about. Other statements that were made to us were that\nan attache case flew across the kitchen without being touched and\nthat some freshly ironed garments left the chair on which they had\nbeen placed, floated through the air and settled on another chair\nwithout becoming unfolded. Unfortunately, nothing approaching\nthese phenomena took place after we arrived, and, without going\nfurther into details of this part of the case, it may be said that noth-\ning was witnessed by us which could not have been brought about\nby normal means . Who were the persons actually concerned in these\nmajor phenomena was never properly cleared up. We formed the\nopinion that several different people were concerned and that they\nwere actuated by different motives, but as there is no conclusive\nevidence against any of them it seems better not to publish charges\nwhich must be speculative and might involve injustice to innocent\npersons.\nWe were, however, able through the very careful and prolonged\nobservations of my collaborator, Mrs Brackenbury, to obtain definite\nknowledge as to the part played, in at any rate the later and minor\ndisturbances, by the boy. Those observations consisted in a de-\ntailed though imobtrusive watching of his movements during every\nmoment that he was on the premises. By this means she was able\nto satisfy herself that all the disturbances she witnessed could have\nbeen produced by him, and that his actions were consistent with\nthe view that he was producing them. Further support was given\nto this view by many details connected with the nature and source\nof the objects thrown and their appearance afterwards.\nJust after the reports of this case had appeared in the Press a\nrather similar series of events occurred at a farm in Kent. The\ndisturbances were not nearly so prolonged or so serious but were\nexaggerated to a fantastic degree by various neighbours. The farm\nwas visited by Mr Lambert, and Mr O'Dell on behalf of the Society,\nand thoTigh no abnormal occurrence took place during their visit\nthey were able to get a report of what had actually happened. From\nthis it seems fairly certain that the farmer's son was the cause of the\nG 2\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1930\ndisturbances which had been described to them, and there can be\nlittle doubt that his actions Were due to the prominence given by\nthe newspapers to the case I first described.\nThe next case which came to our notice was that of an alleged\nboy medium at a small mining town in Wales. The alleged pheno-\nmena took place partly, though not exclusively, at sittings, and were\nsupposed to be due to the spirit of the boy's deceased brother. In\nsome respects, however, the facts are very comparable with those\nof the first case described : the boys were both at about the same\nperiod of bodily development and they had no brothers or sisters\nof at all similar age. It is further a noteworthy fact that both boys,\nwhen told that they had been seen to produce the phenomena by\nnormal means, replied that they did not remember doing it but\nshowed no resentment and made no denial.\nThe last case which I propose to mention was in the house of a\nretired policeman in Huntingdonshire. The family consisted of a\nfather, mother and a 15-year old son. Mrs Brackenbury spent\nsome days with them and was able to observe the boy throwing\nobjects at his father and producing various other disturbances.\nIn all these cases one of the most striking features is the extra-\nordinary credulity of the adult members of the families concerned.\nIn the last case quoted this credulity on the part of the father seemed\nto one of his own friends to be so extreme that he suspected the\nfather and son were in league to produce the phenomena together.\nI think that this unwillingness to admit deception can be explained\npartly by a desire to shield the boy and partly by a natAiral dislike\nto the feeling of having been made a fool of.\nBut what seems to me to be of more interest than the attitude\nof the fathers is the cause for the morbid behaviour of the boys,\nand it is my object to try to discover what common elements if any\nexisted in these various cases in order to get some information as\nto the motives involved. It is perhaps premature to make any\ngeneralisation from observations on three or four cases, and I should\nlike my guesses to be regarded only as tentative suggestions which\nmay be thought of when future cases occur, and then modified or\ndiscarded as the facts demand.\nIn the first place each of these boys had reached an age when he\nhad ceased to be a child and had not become a man. They were all\nadolescents, and, as the reports show, they were all unusually nervous\nand unstable adolescents. They were subject to nervous tics, sense-\nless laughter, jerky movements, all the signs of a badly controlled\nnervous system. That is a common feature of most of these\npoltergeist children and has been described before.\nIn the second place each of them was in effect an only child. They\nhad no companions of their own age and lived mainly with adults.\n\fJuly 1930 Some Investigations into Poltergeists 107\nThirdly, each of them was to an unusual degree in conflict with\nthese adults. It is safe to say that every child on growing up finds\nitself, at various times, oppressed by its guardians who do not\nrecognise its independence and maturity so soon as it thinks they\nshould. The production of these disturbances forms a most effec-\ntive means of making a child an important member of the house-\nhold. If the boy resents being treated too much as a child it would\nbe hard to devise a better revenge or compensation than an active\npoltergeist activity can offer. Not only does he become important\nto outsiders, but what is of far greater value he becomes important\nto himself in feeling that he is outwitting those very adults who think\nhim still a child. In each of these cases I think there is ground for\nsaying that a position of this kind existed. Future cases alone will\nshow if it can be regarded as a widespread factor.\nTHE RECENT CONGRESS AT ATHENS.i\nBy W. H. Salter.\nAny of our Members who could have taken their Easter holiday in\nAthens this year, and omitted to do so, missed the chance of their\nlives. The delights of Greece in April are too well known to require\nrecapitulation. In the present year there were two special attrac-\ntions : the celebrations of the Centenary of Greek independence,\nand the Fourth International Congress for Psychical Research.\nThe Congress, over which Dr Driesch presided with great tact,\nwas in every respect most successful. On the scientific side it was\nfully up to the standard of its predecessors : the business meetings,\nwhich are a necessary part of all Congresses, passed off without the\nslightest friction : and on the social side, thanks to the admirable\narrangements made by Dr Tanagra and our other Greek hosts, it\neasily surpassed its predecessors. It would be impossible to speak\ntoo highly of the hospitality lavished on us. The programme in-\ncluded excursions to many interesting and beautiful places in Athens\nand the neighbourhood. Everyone who attended the Congress must\nhave come away with many delightful memories.\nThe social side of these Congresses has a repercussion on their\nscientific value. In psychical research the personal equation counts\nfor a great deal. Half an hour spent in mild conviviality with one of\nour foreign confreres will give one a better idea of his general ability,\ncandour, and critical faculty, than a week spent reading his books.\nThere is moreover a risk that, if Congresses were not held periodic-\nally, psychical research might develop on gradually divergent lines\n^ Brief summary of a report read to a Private Meeting of the Society, 5 June\n1930.\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1930\nin different countries, until at length, an impassable gulf was estab-\nlished in method, subject-matter, and terminology.\nThere is already an appreciable dift'erence between psychical re-\nsearch of the English and Continental types. In some respects\npsychical research has a wider meaning, in others a more restricted,\nin England than on the Continent. Several^ of the papers read at\nAthens, however interesting in themselves, hardly came within\nwhat we should consider the limits of our subject. Generally speak-\ning, theory plays a much larger part on the Continent than with us.\nThe British bias against theorising, especially when based on a rather\nslight foundation of fact, is probably healthy. But there would be\nno harm if the eminent philosophers and psychologists in our Society\nwould from time to time enlighten us by explaining what relation\nthe facts we seek to accumulate bear to current theories in philo-\nsophy and psychology.\nThere are, on the other hand, several matters in which Continental\npsychical research seems, judged by our standards, to fall short.\nMuch less attention is paid abroad to spontaneous mental pheno-\nmena of the kind collected m Phantasms of the Living : they presum-\nably occur with the same frequency in all countries, but are not\nfollowed up as keenly and carefully as with us. I do not think\nthat we are likely to see in any Continental country elaborate\ninvestigations of the kind carried out in England (and also in\nAmerica) of mental mediums of the type of Mrs Piper, Mrs Leonard\nor Mrs Warren Elliott : that type of medium seems to be for some\nreason an Anglo-American speciality. Again, the more abstruse\nproblems of automatic writing are little understood outside our\nown country.\nThere is a welcome revival of interest abroad in experimental\ntelepathy and clairvoyance. Experiments in long-distance tele-\npathy have been undertaken by groups in Paris, Vienna, Warsaw\nand Athens, but in technique these fall a good deal short of the\nstandards with which we are familiar.\nThese shortcomings are certainly not due to the lack of individual\nability on the part of Continental students, many of whom hold\nhigh academic rank, but to the absence of Societies with an organisa-\ntion, standards and traditions comparable to oiu- own. It is ac-\ncordingly no matter for surprise that suggestions have been made\nfor the formation of an International Society for Psychical Research.\nNo concrete proposal has. yet been made, but the idea is one of\nwhich we are likely to hear a good deal in the next few years. If an\nInternational Society could be formed to supplement, and not to\nsupersede the Societies already existing in different countries, there\nare many useful tasks it might undertake, including the placing on\na more secure and permanent footing of the Congress organisation,\n\fJuly 1930 The Recent Congress at Athens 109\nthe formulation of a proper Glossary (the need for which has several\ntimes been urged by our President, Dr Prince), and the standardisa-\ntion of methods of control for all controllable phenomena.\nAs stated in the June Journal, the Transactions of the Athens\nCongress will be printed in England, at the price of 7s. 6d. The\npapers will be printed in the languages in which they were read\n(English, French and German), and the volume will be one which\nevery serious student must wish to possess.\nThe next Congress will be held, on the invitation of our Society,\nin London in the autumn of 1932, the year of our Jubilee. It should\nbe a point of honour with all of us to see that the London Congress\ndoes not in any respect fall below the high standard set at Athens.\nIN DEFENCE OF D. D. HOME.\nBy Hereward Carrington.\nIt may seem strange that a defence of physical phenomena should\nbe forthcoming from one who, like myself, has generally been\nregarded as one of its severest critics. However, I feel that the\ntruth concerning these historic sittings should precede all other\nconsiderations, and that, if a critic has overstepped the bounds in\ndealing with certain recorded evidence, his attention should be\ncalled to that fact, and any injudicious statements on his part\ncorrected. This I feel can justly be done in the present instance.\nNo sincere student of psychic phenomena should resent the truth,\nno matter how unpleasant that may be. Actual historic documents\nare always welcomed, and because of that I feel that Dr Barthez's\nletter regarding Home should by all means be published, and should\nbe known to researchers generally. The fault I find in Count\nSolovovo's paper is in the extravagant importance he attaches to this\ndocument, and the remainder of his article, in which he attempts\nto criticise Home's sittings generally, and to show that they might\nperhaps all have been of the same nature, and that all his phenomena\nwere (probably) fraudulent. This conclusion is, I think, absolutely\nunjustified.\nFirst of all, however, a few words regarding the famous Barthez\nletter itself. We read :\n\"... The thing is very simple. Mr Hume\nwears thin shoes, easy to take ofJ and put on ; he also has, I believe,\ncut socks which leave the toes free. At the appropriate moment\nhe takes of? one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a\ndress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing\ndone, quickly puts his shoe on again. . .\n.\" This sounds exactly\nlike a dogmatic statement as to how a certain phenomenon was pro-\nduced, made by a man who had not actually seen it so produced,\n\fllO journal of Society for Psychical Hesearch July 1930\nbut who imagined that it must have been so accomplished. As a\nmatter of fact, that is precisely the case ! Dr Barthez did not\nhimself see anything of the kind. In support of his statement, he\nquotes a certain \" M. Morio,\" who, he says, has \" made of it a fine\nrecord, written and signed, with all the details necessary to establish\nthe authenticity of his discovery.\" Yet this extraordinary document\nappears never to have been published ! Where is this first-hand\nstatement from the witness in question ? Surely it should^ have\nbeen produced to back up so grave a charge. As a matter of fact\nI think it highly improbable that Home wore low shoes of the kind ;\nevery photograph and drawing I have seen of Home shows him\nwearing high boots.\nComing now to his criticism of ,the existing evidence, Count\nSolovovo makes much of the fact that Home frequently moved\nfreely about the room, lay on the floor, moved furniture, etc. But\nhe fails to tell us that no phenomena were produced at such times,\nand that manifestations were only noted when Home ceased his\n\" rampaging \" about the room, and again joined the circle. What\nearthly difference does it make what Home did, if he was properly\ncontrolled during the actual production of phenomena ? Providing\nhe was not obviously preparing some subsequent trick, I cannot\nsee what possible bearing all this has on his results. In the vast\nmajority of his sittings, no such perambulations were noted.\nCount Solovovo toys with the idea of an accomplice who might,\nat times, have been smuggled into the room ! Is it contended that\nsuch an accomplice was invariably necessary ? Not at all, it is\nvirtually admitted that the introduction of an accomplice would\nhave been impossible on most occasions. Then why bother to\nintroduce one at all ? If Home could fraudulently produce his\nphenomena without the assistance of a confederate, why should he\never introduce one I Unless a theory is more or less inclusive and\nexplanatory, it is surely superfluous to introduce it.\nIn an earlier criticism, Count Solovovo practically admitted that\nmany of Home's phenomena could not be explained by fraud, and\nattempted to show that hallucination might explain many of these\nfacts {Proceedings, xxi. 436-82). Now, nothing is said about hal-\nlucination, and a resort is again made to possible methods of fraud !\nWhich of these alternatives does Count Solovovo champion ? Or\nis it a combination of both of them ?\nIt is also quite beside the mark to raise questions as to Home's\nprivate life, his morals, his social standing, his financial transactions\netc. All these may have been as shady as you please ;\nthey do not\nat all affect the central problem : Did supernormal phenomena ever\noccur in his presence ? Comit Solovovo makes the point (quite\nrightly, I think) that excellent social position should not prevent\n\fJuly 1930 In Defence of D. D. Home 111\nthe imposition of the severest physical checks and tests. On the\nother hand, I should contend that, no matter how \" low \" that status\nmay be, supernormal phenomena obtahied under the strictest con-\nditions of control necessitate their acceptance. The whole crux of\nthe matter lies in the actual conditions under which manifestations\nare produced.\nCount Solovovo says (p. 259) that \"... we are justified in thinking\nthat, if Sir William Crookes's notes had been as full as Lord Adare's\nwe should have found in them, now and then, indications suggesting\na possible natural explanation of occurrences which as described\nseem to exclude it. . .\n.\" It is nearly always possible to pick holes\nin records of sittings, in this manner, at a distance. The critic\nnotices that such-and-such a point is not adequately covered in the\nreport. He promptly assumes that such-and-such might have\nhappened at the time, and then as promptly concludes that it did\nso happen ! The investigator making the report, however, might\nhave a very clear picture in his mind as to precisely what happened\nduring that period, and know very well that nothing of the sort\nimagined did in fact take place.\nMay I venture to ask Count Solovovo one question ? Does he\nbelieve that one single genuine physical phenomenon has ever\noccurred ? If so, why should not such phenomena occur over and\nover again\u2014a hundred, a million times ? If they have been noted\nin the presence of one medium, why not in the presence of another\n\u2014\nprovided, of course, the conditions were such as to render their\ngenuine character highly probable 1 But perhaps Count Solovovo\ndoes not believe that a single genuine phenomenon has ever been\nobserved ? I can see no valid reason to suppose that supernormal\nphysical phenomena did not occur in Home's sittings, where the\ntestimony seems unanimous and overwhelming. If supernormal\nphenomena occurred in Home's presence, it is to my mind pre-\nposterous to endeavour, at this late date, to show that they did not,\nby picking a few minor flaws in the recorded testimony, and by\npostulating accomplices, hallucination, fraud, etc., as explanatory\nhypotheses. It is possible that Home did trick upon occasion, and\neven that he was caught in such tricks. But the attempt to dispose\nof the whole mass of recorded phenomena, in his case\u2014and indirectly\nof supernormal physical phenomena in general\u2014by these means,\nseems to me a totally unwarranted procedure.\n\f11 2 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July 1930\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nI. A Deferred Impression During a Trance Sitting.\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir, \u2014May I venture to make a few comments on the incident\ndescribed as a \" Deferred Impression,\" an account of which, ap-\npeared in the June Journal (xxvi. 90) ?\nIt is true that in my report on the Warren Elliott sittings I accepted\ntentatively the hypothesis of \" Deferred Impression,\" but sub-\nsequent further study of the facts has caused me to feel considerable\ndoubt as to its applicability.\nIn addition to the two sittings mentioned, viz. those on 7 October\nand 11 November 1926, both of which were \" Sitter Present,\" there\nwere two \" Absent Sitter \" sittings, i.e. sittings at which Mr Mont-\ngomery Smith was not present but relics contributed by him were\nhanded to the medium. These took place on 18 June and 16 July\n1926, making four sittings in all before the date at which the incident\nin question occurred. It may therefore be held that rapport was\nestablished between the medium and Mr Montgomery Smith on\n18 June at the earliest, although they did not actually meet until\n7 October.\nIf we accept as a fact that the communications in question\nreferred to the period about February 1926, as Mr Montgomery\nSmith's evidence tends to show, they were post-dated, as it were,\nto the extent of four months, even if the earliest possible date, viz.\n18 June for the establishment of rapport be taken.\nThat the medium should have acquired these impressions before\nrapport had been established seems incredible ; it implies either\nsome prevision on her part as to her future sitters or else an extremely\nunlikely coincidence.\nWhether we accept as plausible or not the fact that the contri-\nbutor of the article used as a relic at the sitting was in the same\n\" Recently bereaved \" class as Mr Montgomery Smith, led the mind\nof the medium to him by association, we must presume that some-\nhow or other rapport was established with him on that occasion.\nIt seems reasonable to hold that rapport between the medium\nand the sitter is a necessary condition for the transmission of im-\npressions, and the evidence which we have obtained from the Absent\nSitter sittings tends to show that the actual presence of the sitter\nis not indispensable. My point is this. Given the fact of rapport,\nwe may attribute the supernormal knowledge exhibited by the\nmedium to the transmission of impressions from the sitter's mind ;\nthere is, therefore, no reason why that transmission should not have\ntaken place at the actual sitting. If it had occurred at the earliest\n\fJuly 1930 Correspondence 113\ndate at which rapport was possible, it would still have been four\nmonths post-dated. If it occurred at the actual sitting the post-\ndating would be twelve months.\nWe have thus a considerable period of post-dating in any case\nand it seems to me that to import the additional hypothesis of\n\" Deferred Impression \" is a needless complication. I cannot see\nthat there is any greater difficulty in accepting twelve months post-\ndating than four.\nWhy this post-dating should have occurred at all is very obscure.\nThat it was not simply a case of describing past incidents, such as\nfrequently occurs in other sittings, is clear from the wording of the\nrecord. In one place the medium, referring to an incident, says\n\" This is quite recently,\" and in many others she uses language\nwhich can only be taken to imply reference to the present or immedi-\nate past.\nThe hypothesis that it is a simple mistake in date does not seem\nto be very acceptable ; the consistency with which the mistake\napplies over a mmiber of disconnected incidents appears improbable.\nIt must not be thought that in discrediting the hypothesis of\n\" Deferred Impression \" in this case, I am implying that it is not a\nvera causa in some others ;\nmy only reason for regarding it as\nredtmdant here is that it does not bridge the entire gap.\nI fear that I cannot suggest any satisfactory explanation of the\nincident but can only, with considerable diffidence, suggest that it\nmight be regarded as lending some slight support to the idea put\nforward in my report, that an explanation of many of the phenomena\nof mediumship might possibly be found in the postulation of a\nmodification of the temporal conditions governing the medium's\nsubliminal mind.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nII. Nonsense Names.\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir, \u2014In this matter of invented names, perhaps I might add a\npersonal note. I write at once on noting what is perhaps a remark-\nable circumstance. It is my lot frequently to be obliged to invent\nnames for the registration of pedigree stock ; and the names chosen\nare generally \" inspired \" at the birth of the animals. I mean, I do\nnot get dictionaries or concordances and look up crackjaw names,\nand then shorten them. Personally I prefer short names. My\nown consists in all of seven letters\u2014perhaps that is why I do not\ncare for long names.\n\f114 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research Jult 1930\nMy note is, that of 10 animals under my care at present, five have\nnames that \" clink \"\u2014short \" I \" names : Tinka, Kif, Mitty, Dimseys,\nChris. Of the other five animals, Wow is usually called Kiddo,\nKirsty becomes Kiss, Mercy is Missy, and Maria is Missus. The\nexception is Bralp, which is an uninspired name\u2014I made it of\nBr. Alp ( = British Alpine).\nOther loved animals of various kinds in the past, horses, dogs,\ncats, goats, have been Kitty, Milly, Bitty, Silly (Cecilia), Wiggy,\nPiggy, the Biblet, Fish, Higgin, Prittiwhit\u2014I could make the list\ntwice as long. It will be noticed that the initial letter makes no\nmatter in this unconsciousness selectiveness. Nor does the length\nof vowel-sound suggest any association with my own name. I may\nadd that my chief concern with names in my life-time has been\nwith Wild and Pearson only.\nYours, etc.,\nIda Wild.\nTHE JOURNAL IS PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION.\nThe attention of Members and Associates is drawn to the private\nnature of the Journal, from which no quotations should be made\nwithout the previous consent of the Council.

Sir Arthur resigned his member-\nship a few months ago in circumstances known to our readers ; at\nthis time we wish only to pay a tribute to the manifest sincerity and\nenthusiasm invariably shown by him in respect of any cause that\nhe had at heart.\nMiss Clarissa Miles.\nWe regret to have to aimounce the sudden death (in August 1930)\nof a valued member of the Society, Miss Clarissa Miles, who had been\na member of the Society since 1897. She had considerable psychic\n\fOctober 1930 Obituaries 117\nfaculty, and helped Sir William Barrett with experiments in dowsing.\nShe stated in the first paper on her experiments on thought-\ntransference {Proc. xxi. 60) that she had \" learnt from him to make\n[her experiments! of use to outsiders by recording them fully at\nthe time and obtaining on the spot whatever testimony was avail-\nable. In fact,\"' she says, ''whatever scientific value attached to\nthe results of all my experiments is, I feel, entirely owing to his\nconstant help and guidance.\" The conscientious carrying out of\nthe standard thus set before her is characteristic of the reports of\nher experiments given in Proceedings, vols, xxi and xxvii. These\nexperiments were in thought-transference at a distance and were\nmostly made between herself and her friend Miss Hermione Eams-\nden. They aimed high, agent and percipient being in different\nplaces and always many miles apart, and as was to be expected they\nby no means always succeeded, nor when there was success was it\ncomplete. But there were some striking successes and the success\non the whole seems certainly beyond chance, so that the reports\nare a valuable contribution to the work of the Society. Miss Miles\nhad the interests of the Society much at heart and from time to time\nintroduced new members.\nE. M. S.\nCASE OF A PRESENTIMENT ACTED ON.\nP. 300\nWe have received the following narrative through the Countess of\nBalfour, to whom the circumstances were described by Mr Eames,\nof whom she is a patient, within a fortnight of the occurrence He\nafterwards very kindly wrote out this account, incorporating in it\nthe answers to some questions we asked.\nNarrative Statement of Mr E. G. Eames.\nOn Saturday May 2f:th 1930, 1 was driving as usual from St Albans\nto London, along a road I knew exceedingly well, for I had traversed\nit hundreds and hundreds of times. My car is a fast one, I drive\nfastly, for I am always in a hurry, and on this particular morning\nI had some five operations to perform in London before lunch.\nBut a preceding car had for long prevented me from accelerating\nto a really quick speed. It was a Jowett car, being driven carefully\nand quietly by a typical family man, in a typical leism-ely manner.\nThe Father, Mother, and kiddie all enjoying the run, one assumes.\nIn the ordinary way I should have passed by, as I pass by hundreds\nof similar tourists and forgotten them\u2014miles back. But on this\noccasion I absolutely could not pass. It was not the car that\nprevented me. On the contrary it would have been easy to have\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Octobku 1930\ngot by, and I wanted to get by, but something, some exceedingly\nstrong something, insinuated into my subconscioixs brain that an\naccident was going to occur. It was definitely a force quite apart\nfrom shall I say earthly impressions. It was in no ways concerned\nwith the driving of the man in front. Actually he was driving very\nwell. It certainly wasn't nerves, it was a very real presentiment\nthat a crash was going to occur and a warning not to approach too\nnear. For five miles then I hesitated behind this slow-going old\ncar, blaming my foolishness, but very much aware all the time of a\nholding back. Soon, however, I was to be very grateful indeed for\nthis intimation for when we reached a point in the Watling St.,\nbetween Radlett and St Albans the looked for accident occurred.\nA lorry preceded the Jowett which was immediately in front of\nme. The three of us slowly making our ways to London. On the\nopposite side of the road, a saloon car had stopped. Suddenly the\ndoor of the stationary car opened, the huge lorry, obliterating the\nentire view of the road could not quite get by. Without warning he\nstopped abruptly. The poor little Jowett went on. Turned out,\nfound his road completely blocked in every direction, braked\nviolently, skidded and crashed first into the back of the lorry and\nthen onto a brick wall.\nAnd for five miles I had known very distinctly that it was going\nto happen. So very much so that during that time I had felt very\ninclined to go up and mention my presentiment to the driver of the\nlittle family car.\nAll that remains to say is that being immediately behind I must\nin the ordinary way have been smashed up too, but had kept just far\nenough back to be able to come to a standstill immediately beside\nthe wrecked car.\nI attended to the little child, who was badly cut, and rushed both\nhe and his Mother to the Orthopaedic Hospital at Stanmore where\nI left him in the hands of the surgeons.\nA local police officer reviewing all the details of the accident later,\nafter measurements, etc. had been confirmed was quite unable to\nunderstand at all how I had managed myself to avoid being injured,\nor at least concerned in the smash, and when I rather reticently\nexplained that I gathered something was going to happen, and this\nin spite of the care of the driver, he, knowing my usual speed one\nassumes, said \" It must have been a blooming strong presentment\nfor you to have waited behind.\" Which quite frankly, I feel you\nwill agree, was that.\nThis is the third time in my life that I have felt these strong\ncompelling forces or influences warning me of danger, and always\nI have been afterwards very deeply grateful that I have been\nfore-warned.\n\fOctober 1930 Correspondence 119\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nA Correction further Developed.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In the May number of the Journal you printed a letter from\nme in which I point out good reasons for concluding that a i\\Ir\nBalfour whose experience as a scryer is described by Mr Andrew\nLang in an introduction to Mr N. W. Thomas's book on Crystal-\ngazing, was not, as stated in the International Psychic Gazette for\nlast May, the late Lord Balfour. In its September number the\nsame Gazette publishes a letter from Mrs Spoer (Miss Goodrich Freer)\nexplaining how well a crystal vision by the same scryer appears to\nhave corresponded with a house she inhabited in the nineties of\nthe last centiiry, and how she had talked over this with the late Mr\nAndrew Lang. The Editor of the Gazette seems to think this letter\nestablishes at first hand something showing errors in my letter of\nMay. Why he thinks so I cannot imagine. The only passages I\nhave foimd in Mrs Spoer's letter showing disagreement with mine\n(which I should gather she cannot have read) are those in which she\nsays, \" I cannot question the fact that '\nMr Bailie '\nis intended for\nthe late Lord Balfour,\" and subsequently assumes this so-called fact\nas correct. This no doubt is a first hand statement of her opinion,\nbut on what that opinion is based I do not know. She does not\nappear ever to have met the scryer in question.\nAfter writing the above it occurred to me that the original\ndocuments with names concerning the case of the crystal vision of\nthe lady making tea were probably in the archives of the S.P.R.,\nfor the case was printed in our Journal: for July 1895 (vii. 124).\nAccordingly we looked them up and there, sure enough, were\nindependent accounts signed with the real names of the scryer, his\nsister and the lady seen, who also gave their real addresses. The\nnames were not for publication, but neither that of the scryer, nor\nof his sister nor of the lady seen was Balfour. The case of Mrs\nSpoer's house is not I think, recorded in our archives, but it was\nmentioned in a paper by Mr Lang published in our Proceedings,\nXV. 50 when the pseudonym of Lesley is used for the scryer. Mr\nLang describes Mr Lesley as \" known to the world as a man of\nbusiness, a golfer and a composer.\" I have ascertained from a lady\nwho knows him that this description fits the scryer in the tea-\nmaking case, so we may safely assume that Lesley and Balfour were\npseudonyms used by Mr Lang at different times for the same person\n{whom at another time, see his Book of Dreams and Ghosts, pp. 59-60,\nie called Baillie). Both the scryer and his sister are still living.\nAs I explained in my previous letter. Lord Balfour in talking to\nhis family or friends about psychical matters, frequently and\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1930\nemphatically expressed his regret that he personally had never had\nany psychical experiences.\nYours, etc.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nA Correction.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014It appears that I was mistaken\u2014through no fault of my\nown\u2014when saying in my Notes on Periodicals in the May Journal\n(p. 86) that the accusation brought forward again.st Mrs Bradley,\nd pwpos of the Genoa sittings with Valiantine, of having simulated\na certain \" phenomenon was withdrawn. Mr Bradley asserts this\n(p. 64 of the booklet Die Sitzungen mit Valiantine in Berlin) in\nconnection with a talk he had with Signor Rossi in London in June\n1929. But Herr R. Lambert, of Stuttgart, has communicated to\nme valuable evidence bearing on the same sittings, from which\nevidence it follows that as late as on the 8th of November 1929\nSignor Castellani reiterated his statements concerning Mrs Bradley\nin a letter to Signor Rossi (Signor Castellani being one of the sitters\nand Mrs Bradley's neighbour) ; a copy of which letter was forwarded\nby Signor Rossi (then in London) to Mr Bradley on the 12th of\nNovember 1929.\nThe above lines are intended to correct an involuntarily mistaken\nstatement.\nYours, etc.,\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\n.\nFire-walking in Perak.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In the last number of the Journal to reach me. I was\nsurprised to see some doubt apparently thrown on the practise of\n\" fire-walking in various countries.\nAs the \" fire-walking \" ceremony is of regular occurrence among\nTamil (Hindu) estate workers in this country [Perak, Malay Penin-\nsula], possibly an account of such a ceremony might be of interest.\nNature of Fire. A shallow pit about 25' x 6' x 3' is dug (always\nof the same approximate size). This is filled with wood which is\nlighted and burnt all over. When a residue of glowing charcoal,\nwithout flame, is left, the \" fire \" is ready for walking. Walkers\ntraverse the fixe along its long axis\u201425 feet.\nPalliatives. At the end of the pit opposite to that from which\nthe walkers start, a smaller, deeper pit is filled with water. The\nwalkers leap into this at the end of their traverse.\n\fOctober 1930 Fire- Walking in Perak 121\nThe average coolie has never worn shoes and has soles like boot\nleather. I am informed by an estate manager that coolies who work\nindoors show much more susceptibility to the pain engendered than,\nthose whose work is on the estate. I have examined the feet of\nsome dozens of walkers after the ceremony and never seen the\nslightest sign of damage by fire.\nPrelwiinaries. Those who are about to walk march round the\nfire, dance to the drum and cymbal and work themselves up into a\nstate of excitement.\nA priest I saw recently gave a preliminary address whilst standing\nwith bare feet on the upturned edge of a sacrificial knife. (A goat\nis usually sacrificed by decapitation at the beginning.) He balanced\nhimself by holding on to the heads of two men standing there,\nholding the knife upright, but put no weight upon them.\nAdditional Features. Many of the walkers have needles about a\nfoot long stuck through the tongue and into the arms. At least\none walker doing extra penance is usually seen with a symmetrical\narrangement of darts about three feet long stuck into the back,\nchest and arms. The majority of these are removed by assistants\nas he stands cooling his feet in the water after walking. I recently\nsaw some of the darts being removed afterwards but coidd detect\nno bleeding.\nMethod of walking. Some stroll across, some walk rapidly and\nsome run. The priest usually strolls. Some who have attended\nthe ceremony with the intention of walking cannot pluck up courage\nat the last minute. I have seen a man walk round the pit three\ntimes on specially constructed sandals filled with upturned nails,\nbefore starting to walk the fire.\nMany of the walkers \"throw fits'\" on arrival at the other end,\nfoaming at the mouth, stiffening the body and shrieking.\nAll walkers precipitate themselves before the idol in the neigh-\nbouring temple immediately after walking.\nPurpose of the ceremony. The main idea is to show man's in-\nvulnerability by the forces of nature if only he will display faith\nand concentrate his mind on not being hurt. There is also an\nelement of penance for past sins. An amusing point is the belief\nwhich Christian Tamils, some of them of Christian families for three\nor four generations, have in the same power of man over nature.\nI have never heard of a Christian walking the fire, but there is no\ndoubt that they display a great deal of pride in the fact that their\npagan brothers come unscathed through the ordeal.\nYours, etc.,\nG. R. M. Millar.\n\f122 Jo7trnal of Society for Psychical Research October 1930\n[The reference in the first paragraph is to a note in the Journal for\nMay last (xxvi. 83) by Count Perovsky, in justice to whom it must\nbe pointed out that he cast no doubts on the facts of fire-walking,\nas suggested by Mr Millar.\n\u2014\nEd.'\\\nA PSEUDO-BOOKTEST.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In Miss Jephson's \" book test,\" Journal, Jime 1930 (xxvi.\n98), she didn't give full instructions about finding the book, as she\nomitted to say whether it was the third shelf counting from the top\nor from the bottom of the book case. I have had a good many\nbook tests given through various sources and sometimes I am told\nto count from the top and sometimes from the bottom. It would\nbe interesting to hear whether the \" word bridge or something\nconnected with the word bridge \" occurs when the shelf is counted\nboth ways.\nYours, etc.,\nL. D. Dewar.\n[Miss Jephson writes : Following Lady Dewar's letter I have\nagain consulted Dr Kendrick, and it now appears that there was\noriginally a misunderstanding. The word \"bridge\" was found by\nDr Kendrick on the top shelf, and not on the third. My original\ncriticism therefore loses some point. Curiously enough, however,\nDr Kendrick has now looked up the appropriate place counting from\nthe bottom of the bookcase, and has there also found the word\n\" bridge \" (in a school edition of Cesar Birotteau). It seems, there-\nfore, that the evidential value of such a test is still further reduced.]\nREVIEWS.\nTheodore Besterman, Some Modern Mediums. 8vo, pp. xi. 189,\n24 portraits and diagrams.

Price 7s. 6d. net.\nThis book consisting as it does of critical studies of five mediums,\nof whom four are well-known, is unlikely to please everybody and\nit is, indeed, doubtful whether it will wholly please anybody. None\nthe less it is the kind of book of which more might well be published,\nfor it contains the product of much careful and impartial digestion\nof material which is scarcely accessible to any ordinary student.\nThe five \"Modern Mediums \" selected for study are Mrs Piper,\nFrau Silbert, \" Eva C,\" Mme Kahl-Toukholka and \" Margery.\"\nOf these essays the first is perhaps the least satisfactory. Mrs\nPiper, although happily she is still with us and may yet add valuable\nmaterial to her great output, is already a classic. To select a small\n\fOctober 1930 Reviews 123\nsample of evidential matter as Mr Besterman does and to discuss it,\nhowever legitimately, as of a kind incapable even in quantity of\nestablishing survival is, one feels, to run the risk of conveying to\nthe average reader a false, or at least a wholly inadequate idea of\nMrs Piper's importance.\nThe paper on Frau Silbert is in some respects the most important\nm the book. It is based on firsthand observation of this very well-\nknown medium and while written with scrupulous fairness will be\nconsidered by most reasonable people as an exposure just as damning\nas those of a more spectacular character. Personally, I consider\nthe shrewd study and reporting of \" indicia \"\u2014to use the author's\nown term\u2014 at least as proper and effective a way of drawing\nattention to fraudulent practices as the cruder methods of snatching\nand switching on lights at awkward moments. But just as we are\ntold that the latter are liable to do untold harm to the medium so,\nIt IS safe to prophecy, will Frau Silbert's supporters protest that Mr\nBesterman's procedure is\n^'\nunfair \" that \" all suspicious circum-\nstances should be reported at the time,'' etc., etc. But I fear that\nsuch protests will do little to rehabilitate Frau Silbert's claims to\nconsideration.\nMr Besterman's opinion of Marthe Beraud alias \" Eva C.\" is\nequally unfavourable, although in this case he writes on a basis of\nthe extensive literature of the subject and not from personal\nexperience. This literature is too complex even to summarise here,\nbut I think that few students, if any, will differ from Mr Besterman's\nadverse conclusion inasmuch as the quite fantastic phenomena rest\nso largely on the bona fides of persons who are either demonstrably\nbad observers and reporters or, by the very nature of the case, not\nnecessarily above suspicion. The fact that a certain important\nrelevant matter regarding the late Dr Geley's experiments with this\nmedium was found after his death by his successors at the Institut\nMetapsychique at Paris and that these authorities refuse permission\nto pubhsh this material, is in itself highly suspicious and should give\neven the most ardent apologist cause for thought.\nMr Besterman is at his most interesting in the fourth essay,\nwhen he describes his personal experiences with Mme Kahl-'\nToukholka of Paris, a lady who is not a spiritualistic \" medium \"\nbut gives professionally what may be described as \" consultative'\"\nsittings to her clients, in the course of which certain phenomena of\napparently supernormal origin takes place. Thus, she gives\nclairvoyant descriptions of clients' friends, etc. ; divines names\nthought of or written down ; answers questions mentally pro-\nponaded and the like ;\nand, in particular, sometimes succeeds in\nproducing on the skin of her forearm designs or letters in red corre-\nsponding to those thought of or WTitten by enquirers present.\n\f124 Jottrnal of Society for Psychical Research October 1930\nMr Besterman is on the whole favourably impressed by these\nphenomena, although he observes a most judicious restraint as\nregards both his descriptions and conclusions. Nor is he an\nobserver whose views are to be as lightly rejected as those of\nuninstructed members of the general public.\nNone the less the general impression gained is that of trickery and\nthis is not weakened by closer study. As Mr Besterman is the first\nto admit, the personal \" atmosphere is unsatisfactory ; the use\nof special cards on which questions are printed, the fact that\nM. Kahl's absence notably affects residts in an adverse sense, Mme\nKahl's frequent absences from the room, etc., etc., are all suggestive\nof traditional \" billet reading \" methods and kindred tricks. The\nsame applies to the clever and convincing but quite standardised\nways in which the medium \" mixes successes, partial successes\nand failures producing\u2014precisely as intended\u2014the reaction,\n\" Surely if she had known the name, she would have got it quite\nright instead of nearly right.\" The effects so produced are very\npersuasive but the degree of psychological insight required to\nforesee this is not high.\nAgain the test with a drawn diagram given in p. 113 is a stock\ntrick. It is true that as described by Mr Besterman it cannot be\ndone ; but Mr Besterman's description is exactly that which\nthe normal person ivould give (and does give) when the trick is\nperformed by any competent prestidigitator. Similar resemblances\nare to be noted throughout and although it would be too much to\nconclude that all the phenomena observed are tricks, we should\nbe chary in attributing them to any other cause pending much more\ndetailed evidence backed by the observations of a competent\nmagician.\nIn particular it is to be noted that a period of some five days\nelapsed between the first (unproductive) sitting and the second.\nWithout postulating any elaborate secret service organisation, it\nseems not unreasonable to suppose that an astute professional might\nobtain a certain amount of information about a prospective and\nimportant visitor during this period. The fact that he was married\nand the Christian name of his wife could, for instance, be obtained\nat the cost of a shilling and an hour's visit to Somerset House.\nThe last paper deals with a very limited portion of the mediumship\nof the celebrated \" Margery,\" namely the so-called \" cross-corre-\nspondences \" claimed to have been effected between her and other\nmediums.\nThey depend for their value entirely on the \" fraud proofness,\"\nnotably as regards times, of the conditions under which they took\nplace and Mr Besterman has no difficulty in showing that fraud\nmight easily have occurred had those concerned been so minded.\n\fOctober 1930 Hevieivs 125\nThe book, which includes complete bibliographies, a useful\nglossary and does not omit an index, is agreeably WTitten and\nshould certainly be read by all who wish to keep au courant with\nthe trend of up-to-date criticism.\nW. Whately Smith.\nHarry Price, Rudi Schneider : a Scientific Examination of his\nMediumship. 8vo, pp. xv. 239, 12 diagrams and ill. London :\nMethuen and Co., Ltd., 1930. Price 10s. 6d. net.\nThis book consists of a detailed account by Mr Price of the results\nobtained in the course of two visits of Rudi Schneider to Mr Price's\nlaboratory in the spring and autumn of 1929. The descriptions\nare clear and the illustrations well reproduced. Mr Price is con-\nvinced of the supernormal character of the phenomena observed,\nand advances strong arguments in support of his belief. A good\ndeal of his argimient is devoted to showing the superiority of the\nelectrical method of control first applied to the medium by Krall,\nand extended to the sitters by Mr Price, over what he calls the\n\" obsolete \" method of hand control on which we are accustomed\nto rely. The control of the sitters becomes of especial importance\nin the Schneider sittings because the unusually complete restrictions\nto which both the brothers readily submit makes the exclusion of a\nconfederate sitter particularly desirable, since there is thus a chance\nof a really conclusive test. It is therefore worth while to consider\nin some detail whether the electrical method ought really to super-\nsede the older one. It has so far as I can see two advantages. It is\na check on a sitter letting go of his neighbour's hand unconsciously\nthrough excitement or fatigue, and it informs the whole circle\nthat the sitter's metallic gloves (not their hands as Mr Price claims)\nare in proper contact. Apart from these two points, it seems to\ngive no greater security against fraud than the older method. If\ntwo adjacent sitters wish to free a hand, it is only necessary for one\nof them to pull the glove of! the hand which he is holding. As long\nas he grasps this glove the hand which ought to be in it will be free\nand no one will be the wiser, and I do not think there would be\nany change in the tell-tale light. One sitter alone can free his feet\nby connecting his metal floor plates by a piece of wire.\nThe electrical control has in addition certain disadvantages.\nIn the first place it is liable to go wrong and to cause an interruption\nof the sitting through a broken wire or some similar mishap. In the\nsecond place, the more apparatus and mechanical appliances are\nintroduced, the more sources of error there must be, and the more\nopportunities for misdirection by anyone who aims at deception.\nI have of course no reason to suppose that any deception took place\nin these sittings, but I do not feel that the electrical control excludes\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1930\nit any better than the older methods which Mr Price describes as\nobsolete.\nThe phenomena obtained were similar to those which Rudi\nSchneider has given elsewhere. They inchided the movement of\nobjects, the apparent materialisation of a hand and the usual cold\nbreezes. Mr Price's recording thermograph also enabled him to\nnote the same inexplicable fall of temperature that occurred in some\nof the Stella C. sittings.\nThe plan of the .seance-room in Plate 2 would have been increased\nin value if it had been drawn to scale throughout.\nV. J. W.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nRevue Metajjsychique, May-Jime 1930.\nDr Osty has a paper on \" La Vision de Soi,\" in which several cases\nare mentioned which, I may add, seem to have nothing to distin-\nguish them from purely subjective anthropomorphic hallucinations.\nM. de Vesme discusses at length \" Paranormal Diagnostic in\nHistory.\" Dr Sollier's work Les phenomenes d'autoscopie is specially\nreferred to. This term is applied here to the faculty alleged to be\npossessed by some somnambulists to \" see \" the internal organs of\ntheir own body, as to the reality of which Dr SoUier seems to have\nno doubt. M. de Vesme is, very sensibly, by no means convinced\nof the infallibility of the somnambulists when describing other\npeople's ailments. Some people, by no means utterly incredulous,\nwill be inclined to express themselves still more cautiously.\nDr Carl Bruck describes a \" case of spontaneous telepathy\nbetween Berlin and Paris,\" the supposed telepathic transmission\nbeing only a more or less strong impression. I wish such impressions\nwere as a rule given a wide berth as evidence, much as I am inclined\nto believe in phantasms of the dying, and possibly even of the dead.\nIn the Chronique we are informed of the death of M. de Sainville,\na painter intensely interested in \" metapsychics.\" We have then\nbriefly mentioned quite a batch of \" hauntings \" all over France.\nNone seems to have been investigated in proper fashion. Further\nreference is made to the apparatus invented under the auspices of\nM. Rutot of Brussels, which M. Maire is inclined to think merely a\n\" big soap bubble.\"\nThe number closes with another batch of cases of varying value,\nchiefly communicated by M. Richet and entitled \" Monitions of\nDeath.\"\nRevue Metapsychique, July-August 1930.\nDr Osty has a long paper on \" two strange artists \" : Mme\nMarguerite Burnat-Provins and Mme Juliette Hervy, the former\n\fOctober 1930 Notes on Periodicals 127\npainting, the latter writing, under .supposed spirit-influence. In\nboth cases the complete good faith of the artists must be assumed,\nwhich seems to me to detract somewhat from the value of their\nperformances, though in the case of Mme Juliette Hervy Dr Osty\nseems to be of opinion that conscious production of the same quality\nunder the same conditions is impossible.\nM. R. WarcoUier discusses \" Telepathy and Imagination \" and\nattempts to show how in experimental telepathy the impact is\nsometimes distorted by the percipient's fancy. He may be right\nand the fact, if real, is of interest : but I feel bound to protest\nemphatically in advance against the possible tendency of inter-\npreting in this connection as successes most undoubted failures.\nIn fact M. WarcoUier's paper does not seem to me to be altogether\nfree from such a tendency : thus in one case where the agent (M. W.)\nwishes to transfer a black point in a white background, one of the\npercipients draws a man fastened to a rope and being lowered into\nthe bottom of a well. In M. Warcollier's opinion the message has\nbeen \" disfigured,\" the percipient's conscious imagination working\ntoo much ; to me it is of course a downright failure.\nM. Andry Bourgeois writes on M. Charles Henry's work and its\nbearing on the problem of survival. M. Henry (born in 1859 and\nrecently deceased) was during 34 years director of the Sorbonne\nlaboratory on the Physiology of sensations.\" He applied mathe-\nmatical methods to the solution of the chief problems of physics and\nbiology and is apparently believed by some to have proved in this\nway the existence of a soul and its survival of bodily death. M.\nAndry Bourgeois himself admits however that whether M. Charles\nHenry was a precursor of genius or whether his theories do not\nconform to our experience, it is for the future to decide definitely\n(p. 346) ; for the present therefore these very abstruse speculations\ndo not by any means seem to me of cardinal importance for our\nresearches.\nBuUetin du Conseil de Recherches Metapsychiques de Belgique, April\n1930.\nThis number opens with a paper by M. Rutot, the President,\ndescribing an apparatus devised by a certain L. V. d. M. under the\ndirection of his deceased son (aged 15) and through which the latter\nis alleged to intimate directly, by ringing, when he is going to\ncommunicate through the ouija. The apparatus has been tested in\nsittings of the Conseil with success, but essential particulars are\nmeanwhile missing. We have no detailed description of the\napparatus nor are we told anything as to the precautions taken to\nprevent action on the part of some person present. The words\n\" progres capital \" applied to the new invention by M. Rutot appear\n\f]28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October io30\ntherefore premature. Another article by him refers to various\nalleged incidents where quasi-human hands and forms are asserted\nto have been produced with the help of electric currents of high\nfrequency, and suggests more experiments in that direction.\nA series of non- evidential \" messages alleged to have proceeded\nfrom the late Dr van Velsen of Brussels, is then given, and a\nmaterialisation sitting with Mr Guy L'Estrange as medium, at\nCarshalton, is described.\nBulletin du Conseil des Recherches Metapsychiques de Belgique, July\n1930.\nThis number opens with a \" descriptive monograph of the Henri\nVandermeulen apparatus (this being the Christian name and\nsurname of the 15 years old deceased boy mentioned above). In\nanother article M. Rutot mentions a more or less similar apparatus\ninvented some fourteen years ago in England by (or through) a Mr\nDavid Wilson. I abstain purposely from saying more on the subject\nnow, merely mentioning that I had the pleasure of making M. Louis\nVandermeulen's acquaintance, and that at the moment (14 July)\nthe ringing and the ouija-writing seem to be produced by other\n\" entities,\" which have almost completely elbowed \" Henri out,\nand of which M.

More than this\nI need not say at present.\nZeitschrift fur Parapsyclwlogie, June 1930.\nDr Wagenschein narrates a psychometric experiment which Frau\nLotte Plaat, who of late has acquired considerable reputation in\nthat domain.

With many of\nthese she conversed and in a few cases there seems to be some\nevidence that these experiences were not purely subjective. When\nreading the Princess's extremely striking account one is irresistibly\nreminded of Friederike Haufie, Kerner's subject. The genuineness\nof the diary is vouched for by a Roman Catholic priest, also anony-\nmous, but with whom the Editor of the Zeitschrift was able to\n\fOctober 1930 Notes on Periodicals 129\ncorrespond.

The dream (that a Professor Slaboch would have an arm\nbroken) was related by the percipient to her husband and noted\ndown by the latter some eight weeks before the fulfilment.

The two sets, which are in good condition\nand newly bound in the Society's green and red covers, are being\noffered at \u00a310 Os. Od. for the set of Proceedings, and \u00a37 Os. Od. for the\nset of the Journal, or \u00a316 Os. Od. for a complete set of the two\npublications. Owing to the scarcity of some of the Parts it is now\nvery difficult to make up complete sets, and any Member or Associate\nwho would like to take advantage of this offer is advised to make\nearly application to the Secretary.\nIt may be useftil to note, for ptirposes of comparison, that the\npublished price of a set of Proceedings is \u00a336 4s. 9d., and at the Mem-\nbers' half price \u00a318 2s. 5d. ;\nallowing for the reduction made to\nMembers buying a complete set the price is \u00a316 5s. 6d.

The\nresponse to these two appeals does not seem to us altogether worthy\nof the Society's position in the world of psychical research. Up to\ndate (28 October) the total number of copies ordered by Members\nof the Society resident in the United Kingdom and the United States\nis twenty-one (value \u00a37 lis. 6d.). This contrasts most unfavourably\nwith the subscription of 500 crowns, equivalent to over \u00a327, which\nhas been made towards the cost of publication by the Norwegian\nSociety for Psychical Research. If a Society in a small country like\nNorway takes siiJficient interest in the international congresses and\nin the publication of the Transactions to subscribe as much as \u00a327,\nsurely Members of so large and so old established a Society as our\nown might be rather more ready in ordering copies.\nIt is expected that the volume will be ready before Christmas and\nthe Hon.

Winterstein of Vienna, President of the\nAustrian S.P.R. and a Member of our Society, for bringing the follow-\ning case to our attention. Baron Winterstein writes as follows\n(13 June 1930) :\n\" A case of apparition witnessed soon after death and reported in\nthe enclosure, may be of some interest for your Society. I was\ninformed by the person who had received the letter of condolence.\nBaron Alfred Liebieg, Vienna III, Petterhofengasse 5, an old friend\nof our family who has lost his wife some weeks ago. She died in\nagony, after having been ill for a long time, on April 29th at 11.20\np.m. in Vienna (local time for England about 10.20 p.m.). The vision\noccurred therefore approximately an hour after the death. The\nwriter of the letter is Mrs Jessie Finniecome, Barskimmine, Paisley\nRoad, Renfrew, Scotland. The lady lived years ago in the house of\nthe Baron and remained on very friendly terms with the whole family,\nespecially with the deceased Baroness. IVIrs Finniecome wrote the\nletter immediately after she had received the printed announcement\nof the death, which contained merely the date ; the hour of death was\nnot specified therein. I should like to refer you for further details\nand for the confirmation of the facts to Mrs Finniecome herself,\nwho may tell you also if she has had similar experiences before. . .\n.\"\nThe following is Mrs Finniecome's account of the occurrence as\ngiven in her letter (dated 5 May 1930) to Baron Liebieg, who\nkindly forwarded the original to the Society for inspection\n:\n\"... Now I must tell you that a very strange thing happened to\nme on the night of April 29th. I already knew on that night that\nthe Baroness had died\u2014because she came here and said goodbye to\nme. It was like this : On the Tuesday evening I went to bed feeling\nvery tired about 9 p.m. and fell sound to sleep. About llj p.m. I\nawoke with some one pressing a kiss on my forehead, and on looking\nup, I saw the Baroness standing by the side of the bed, she looked as\nthough she desired to say something, or was waiting for me to\nspeak or answer, but I was so startled, not to say, afraid, I was\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1930\nspeecUess, so after gazing at one another for a minute or two, the\nBaroness turned and vanished. Her expression was so sad and\nenquiring I cannot forget it. AVhat I have just written you is not an\nhallucination but real fact. I related it to Mr Finniecome on the\nWednesday morning, and he said '\nyou were dreaming.' However\nnow the news has come of the Baroness's death, Mr Finniecome is\nconvinced that really I saw what I related to have seen. I only wish\nI knew what it was the Baroness wished to ask or tell me\u2014for I am\nsure she wanted to know something. Tell me what do you think of\nthis strange vision. I really saw the Baroness as clearly as I see the\npaper I am now writing on and I was wide awake. ...\"\nThe Hon. Treasurer, Mr Salter, wrote to Mrs Finniecome asking\nwhether Mr Finniecome would give his own account of the morning\nof 30 April, when Mrs Finniecome related her experience to him,\nand received in reply the following statement (dated 7 July 1930)\ndictated and signed by Mr Finniecome :\n\" I do not remember the exact words of the conversation which\ntook place at our breakfast table on the morning of Ap. 30th.\nBut as far as I can recollect it began somewhat as follows :\n\" My wife said :\n'\nI dare say you will laugh at me when I tell you\na very strange thing happened to me last night.'\n\" '\nWhy, how so, what was it ?\n'\n\" '\nWell, I awoke with someone stooping over me and kissing my\nforehead. It was such a cold kiss, and I was awfully frightened\u2014\nI\nam sure it was Baroness Liebieg, and she looked as though she was\ntrying to make me imderstand something she wanted to say\u2014I was\nso startled and afraid I half turned myhead, and when I looked again,\nshe was vanishing, and gave me such a sad look. You know, Jim,\nshe stood between the two beds, with her back to you.'\n\" '\nWhy did you not wake me ?\n'\n\" '\nBecause I did not think it would be of any use and might spoil\nyour night's rest.'\n\" '\nAh ! perhaps you were dreaming.'\n\" '\nNo, I was not, I saw her as distinctly as I see you now.'\n\" '\nWell, it's very strange, but if you recollect the same thing\nhappened to you when my mother died, but she spoke, and told you\nto take care of the weans, and as my mother was totally unknown\nto you and you had never seen her, you described her to me\nmost accurately, and 3 or 4 days later I heard of my mother's\nsudden death. She died on the same night and about the same time\nas she appeared to you. It is really very strange.'\n\"\nMrs Fimiiecome also forwarded the original printed aimouncement\nof the Baroness Liebieg's death. It is dated \" Wien, am 30 April\n1930,\" and, as stated by Baron Winterstein, does not give the hour\nof the death, but merely says \" am Abend des [during the evening\n\fKovEMBEii 1930 Apparition of a Friend at moment of Deutlt 135\nof] 29 April 1930.\" Questioned as to how she fixed the time of\nthe appearance Mrs Finniecome writes (7 July 1930) :\n\" I did not\nhear the hall clock chime the quarter, but soon after the appearance\nhad vanished it chimed the half hour\u2014and when I had recovered\nfrom my fright (for I was afraid) I got up and looked at the bedroom\nclock, which showed the hour to be eleven [clearly this means that\nthe hour hand stood between 11 and 12]\u2014therefore the vision was\nsomewhere between 11J-11t|. I fixed 11.20.\"\nOn the question of the hour it is to be noted that, whereas Vienna\nis normally an hour ahead of British time. Summer-time came into\noperation in Great Britain on 13 April 1930, and therefore on\n29 April British and Vienna times were the same, as we are informed\nthat there is no Summer-time in Austria. The time of Baroness\nLiebieg's death (11.20 p.m.) therefore corresponds exactly with the\ntime fixed by Mrs Finniecome for her vision.\nMrs Finniecome was also asked whether, in view of the fact that\nBaroness Liebieg had been ill for some time before her death (the\nannouncement says \" nach langerer Krankheit \"), she had, apart\nfrom the vision, any reason to expect a crisis in her friend's illness\nat that time, or any special cause to think about her then.\nMrs Finniecome replied (7 July 1930) :\n\" Yes, I knew that the\nBaroness was very ill, but from the last reports of her health, I had\nreason to believe and hope that she was gaining strength and better.\nNaturally I thought a great deal about her, as I was greatly attached\nto her, but on 29th Ap. I had not been thinking more than usual\nabout her.\"\nThe case is an unusually striking one, in view of the very close\ncorrespondence in time between the death of Baroness Liebieg and\nMrs Finniecome's vision, and of the distance between Renfrew and\nVienna.\nNOTES ON A SITTING WITH MRS BRITTAIN.\nBy Ernest S. Thomas.\nMiss Nea Walker (whom I have not met) kindly arranged for me an\nanonymous sitting with the medium Mrs Brittain, on 9 November\n1929.\nBefore going into trance the medium said that a little dog had\nfollowed me in. I could not place it. With three recent sitters\nknown to me she had also remarked upon an accompanying dog.\nTwenty names were given, of which two (mine and my mother's)\nwere asked for by me. Of these names fifteen were those of near\nrelatives well known to me. It should be stated, however, that my\nparents both came of very large families. Four of these names were\nwrongly assigned, while five were correctly associated. Two\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1930\nstatements regarding unknown names cannot, I find, be verified.\nOne of tlie correct names is doubtfully associated (viz. Dorothy, see\nbelow) and of no particular significance. A strikingly wrong state-\nment was made about my mother and one about myself. Three\npersons were described in detail whom I failed to recognise. Both\nmy parents were correctly taken to be dead. This was not necessarily\nprobable but a fairly safe guess. A few notes on incidents follow.\nStatements by the medium are in italics.\nMy mother's name was early stated to be Anne (or Hanna),\nwhich (the former) is her mother's name.\nAlice in the spirit-world loves you. This was my mother's name.\nIn the list of 1,500 names (odd) on the books of the Oxford Ladies'\nColleges since 1881, Alice occurs 41 times. But it was commoner\nwhen the medium was quite young. I find Alice was given non-\nrelevantly to one of the sitters referred to above.\nThe details, though scanty, given in describing my father, were\ngood, and included his love of children and, notably, his twinkling\nblue eyes (mine are brown). Father sends- his love to Dorothy and\nMabel. I asked, \" Who is Mabel ?\n\" His daughter, his second\ndaughter. I thought this was wrong, but see below. I forgot to ask\nabout Dorothy. Mabel occurs in the above list ten times and is not\nmarkedly Victorian.\nHe used to say \" Jeremiah, blow the fire.\" He habitually chanted\nthis old song to his two small boys in Ceylon, with appropriate play\nwith the bellows (\" puff puff puff \") when blowing up the fire. Miss\nWalker kindly submitted a list of Victorian sayings, including the\nabove, to Mrs Brittain (Tommy make room for your Uncle, Bob up\nserenely, How's your poor feet, Jeremiah blow the fire, puff, pufi:, puff,\nChampagne Charlie is my name. Go it yoa cripples, Young son of a\ngun, Whippersnapper, Come to my arms my bundle of charms).\nThe medium marked several she knew, but not Jeremiah. I had\nnot thought of it since I sang it occasionally to a small child two or\nthree years ago.\nI asked my mother's name. Wait, som.eone called Emily. This\nwas her second name : I expected Alice. Emily is perhaps distinctly\nVictorian, but it occurs only eight times in the above lists.\nSomeone called Constance daddy says. I had forgotten, when\nMabel was given, that there had been an elder sister, Constance,\nwho died yoimg, in England (seven years after I had seen her)\nforty-three years ago. Connie sends her love. She was so called\nalways. Constance occurs only seven times in the lists.\nHe is laughing about ... a debt to say good-bye to. This is a clear\nreference to a recent sale of land in the Colonies for the unfortunate\npurchase of which he was responsible.\nFinally, when the power was said to be going, I asked that my\n\fNovember 1930 Notes 071 a Sitting with Mrs Brittain 137\nfather should give my name. After Edward ? no : Teddy ? no (l\nsaying nothing) she said the name had five letters and spelt Ernie\ntentatively (that is, saying no after each letter), getting all the letters\ncorrectly except the penultimate, at first trial, to my yes and no.\nYet she did not guess the name she so nearly spelt. She seemed in\nreal distress at her failure and complained of the movements of the\nletters shown her.\nMy father died ten, my mother (whom I last saw in 1884) twenty-\nfive years ago. Both lives were notable for striking and imusual\nepisodes. Yet none of these were alluded to. I had especially hoped\nfor commiinications from my mother. Yet nothing tangible came.\nIn the circumstances I realise that there are good enough reasons\n(both expedient and natural) for the failure in both cases. Again,\nI was surprised that no message had been sent to my brother as well\nas my sister, neither of whom had been in my thoughts during the\nsitting. But as an objector on religious grounds to dealings with\nmediums, he would not have welcomed it.\nThe Jeremiah and the debt episodes, as well perhaps as the sudden\nreference to Constance, accord with a whimsical trait in my father's\ncharacter. All the evidential points given as from him, except the\ndebt incident, came together near the close of the sitting, as though\nthe medium had got on a trail or established contact. A strong\npoint is this : I have never since his death associated Constance with\nmy father, never thought of any reimion. If the medium got this\nand all the above correct information from my unconscious mind,\nshe showed distinct powers of selection.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Psychology of a Mistake.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014Gratified as I always am to have any error in my writings\npointed out, I naturally prefer to be myself the first to detect them.\nAlas ! it was not imtil within half a day of receiving offprints of\nmy Presidential Address {Proceedings, vol. xxxix) that it dawned\nupon me that, on page 283, the name Tyndall instead of Huxley\nshould have been given, as that of the man who refuted the experi-\nments of Bastian.\nNow that the erratum has been signalized, it may be worth while\nto mention that its discovery is a fairly good illustration of the sub-\nconscious activities and relations with the conscious which are in\nconstant operation with us all, but of which we ordinarily take less\nnote than of the air which surrounds us in a still room.\nThe fact is that while it was Tyndall who performed the experi-\nments correcting the defects in the experiments of Bastian, upon\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1 930\nwhich the latter had relied as a proof of abiogenesis, Huxley did\nlater deliver an address on \" Abiogenesis and Biogenesis \" in which\nhe mentioned Tyndall's experiments. It has been, probably, thirty\nyears since I read either Tyndall's report or IKixley's address. The\nconfusion of memories is therefore easy to understand.\nBut note ! When I wrote the sentence mentioning Huxley I felt\nso certain the experiments were his that I never thought of checking\nup on my impression. Moreover, I went over my own address\nrepeatedly, combing it for errors, etc., read it at the S.P.R. Meeting\nin London, and again repeatedly searched it in order that any dis-\ncovery of the need of correction should be in time for the printer.\nSeveral changes in diction were made, but all the conscious effort\napplied failed to detect the mistake in naming Huxley.\nThen, a few days ago, by accident I came upon the manuscript,\nmerely glanced at it, and as my eye fell upon the word \" Huxley,\"\ninstantly and spontaneously\u2014that is, without any conscious\nquestioning or consideration\u2014it was apparent to me that Tyndall\nwas the man. Accompanying this conviction there flashed upon my\nmental retina the picture of Professor George M. Duncan, sitting at\nhis desk in a classroom of Yale University, and then I remembered\nthat, when I was a member of his class, he gave a course of lectures\non the foundation of Tyndall's Fragments of Science and other\nwritings. I cannot now consciously remember that he discussed the\nBastian-Tyndall matter, but infer that this was the case. And then,\nby purposive searching among my conscious memory of the general\ncharacter of researches made by Tyndall and Huxley respectively,\nwhat had first emerged as a conviction with a pictorial accompani-\nment became rationally highly probable. Finally, fresh research\nestablished the fact that it was Tyndall who answered Bastian.\nThere is nothing remarkable about this instance, but it is\ninteresting considering the failure of so much and repeated volitional\nscrutiny, and the sudden illumination which followed a mere passing\nglance. Of course it was that very volitional scrutiny which set the\nwheels of subconscious activity in motion.\nI would be glad to receive any reports of similar emergences,\ncarefully and critically analysed, which readers may be so good as\nto send me.\nThe error on page 15 of the Address, \" Romford \" for Rumford,\nwas not made at my end of the line. I am reminded that years ago\na group of which I was a member determined to print a very small\npamphlet absolutely free from typographical errors, and when it\ncame out the word \" the \" occurring at the end of a line was found\nrepeated as the first word of the line following.\nYours, etc.,\nWalter Franklik Prince.\n\fNovember 1930 Rudi Schneider 139\nEVDI SCHNEIDER.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nSir,\u2014In his criticism of my book, Rudi Schneider (October\nJournal, p. 125), Dr WooUey omitted to state that all the points he\nraised were thrashed out in the work itself and discussed from every\nangle.\nIt is playing with words when Dr WooUey states that the \" metallic\ngloves, not the hands \" were in contact ; he might as well argue that\nwhen we shake hands, we \" shake gloves \" if we happen to be wearing\nhand coverings.\nDr Woolley's \" metallic gloves \" are in fact cotton or leather (the\nformer very difficult to get off, once they are on) with metallic\npalms which have to be in frrai contact in order to keep the indicator\ncontrol light burning. The slightest relaxation of grip puts the light\nout, so that it woiild be absolutely impossible (it has been tried\nexperimentally many times) for a sitter to remove his gloves without\nthe light failing.\nNo one who had properly studied the details of our electrical\nmethod of controlling a medium could possibly make the remark :\n\" One sitter alone can free his feet by comiecting his metal floor\nplates by a piece of wire,\" and I should be grateful to Dr WooUey if\nhe would show me how it can be done without the rest of the sitters\nbecoming aware of the fact.\nAs a matter of fact, the floor plates are not in the electrical circuit,\nas I plainly state in my report (p. 9). They are there merely for the\nsitters' convenience instead of their having to keep the feet hard\npressed against their neighbours'. What a sitter must do is to keep\nhis feet in contact with the feet on either side of him. \" Connecting\nhis metal floor plates by a piece of wire \" would make no difference\nto the circuit.\nBut supposing a sitter wished to tamper with the plates, he would\nfirst have to remove one glove (and that would mean two confeder-\nates ; and the gloves are linked together with insulated wire) in\norder to untie the securely taped-on metallic socks. Then he would\nneed both hands (with gloves removed : that means three confederates)\nin order to fasten \" a piece of v\/ire \" to the metal floor plates (which\nare nailed flat to the floor and cannot be moved) . And then he wotdd\nhave his trouble for nothing as the plates are not in the electrical\ncircuit, as I have already stated. And while our hypothetical three\nconfederates are doing their job of work (for which a tool would be\nneeded) the hand and foot control lights wotdd be out. In practice,\nthe slightest flicker of any of the six control lights is immediately\nchallenged;\nI will not further encroach upon your space by answering all of\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1930\nDr WooUey's criticisms. He has never seen our electrical control\nor its application to sitters and medium, and lie has never seen our\nseance room. I find it hard to convince myself that he has even read\nthe book properly.\nThe \" two visits of Rudi Schneider to Mr Price's laboratory \" (in\nreality, twenty-six seances held at the National Laboratory of\nPsychical Research, over a period of nine months, and attended by\none hundred scientists, doctors, magicians, etc., some of whom have\nfurnished independent reports which are printed in my book), were\nproductive of physical phenomena witnessed under conditions of\ncontrol never previously imposed upon any medium in any country.\nAnd the phenomena were produced with a constantly changing\ncircle and with twenty-one different controllers. I think Dr WooUey\nmight have mentioned these vital facts in his criticism of my book.\nAs regards the utility or otherwise of the electrical control, the proof\nof the pudding is in the eating and we have achieved a brilliant and\nconvincing success.\nThe plan of the seance room mentioned by Dr WooUey is drawn\napproximately to scale, and exact measurements and weights, and\ndimensions of articles used are given at least ttvice in the text.\nIn conclusion, I will remark that I have offered the conjurers on\nboth sides of the Atlantic substantial monetary inducements to\nproduce \" phenomena \" under our system of controlling a medium,\nbut none has had the temerity to try. Will Dr Woolley give the\nNational Laboratory of Psychical Research a practical demonstra-\ntion of how it can be done ?\nYours, etc.,\nHaery Price,\nHonorary Director,\nNational Laboratory of Psychical Research.\n[Dr Woolley writes : I cannot agree with Mr Price that it is\nplaying with words to emphasise the fact that his electrical control\nonly informs the sitters of the contact of the gloves and not of the\nhands. Assuming that two adjacent sitters wish to free a hand, the\ndifficulty of one pulling ofi the glove from the other's hand without\nbreaking contact depends only on the tightness of the glove, and the\nother would take care to select a loose one before the sitting. So long\nas the first continued to grasp the empty glove the light woiild\ncontinue to glow.\nWith regard to the foot control and the floor plates I have con-\nsulted page 9 to which Mr Price refers, and I find there \" [the\nsitter's] right foot rests on half of the small plate, his neighbour's\nfoot occupying the remainder of the plate, which thus serves as a\nbridge for the current.'' (The italics are mine.) In view of this, how\n\fNovember 1930 Rudi Schneider 141\ncan. it be said that the plates are not in the electrical current ? It\nseems obvious that if an electrical connection is made between the\nplate on which a sitter's right foot rests and that on which his left\nfoot rests that sitter could lift one or both feet (without removing\nthe metallic socks) and the lamp would still glow. Such an electrical\ncormection could be made by a wire weighted at each end so as to\nrest on and make contact with each plate. Whether one sitter\nwithout a confederate could free his feet in this way is more doubtful\nand depends on the alertness of his neighbours and the rigidity with\nwhich the circle is kept unbroken after the lights are lowered. I\nthink it might not be difficult for him to make an excuse for a\nmomentary freeing of his hand to adjust the wire, but what I had\nin mind when I wrote that \" one sitter alone can free his feet \" was\nthat, if he has once comiected the plates in the way I suggest, then\nhe needs no confederate afterwards. For freeing a hand a confederate\nis essential.\nIn reply to ]\\Ir Price's concluding question, I should much like to\nhave an opportunity of examining his control system in practice.\nOn reading his letter I visited his Laboratory for the purpose, but I\nfind that the apparatus is now dismantled.]\nREVIEWS.\nHereward Carrington, The Story of Psychic Science {Psychical\nResearch). 8vo, pp. 400, 26 ill. and portraits. London : Rider\nand Co. [1930]. Price 24s. net.\nMr Carrington describes his book as \"an attempt to summarize\nthe findings of modern psychical research,\" and there are few\npersons better qualified by length and variety of experience to\nundertake such a task. The book should prove a useful introduction\nto any student new to the subject, who will there find set out with\ngreat clearness the outlines of the different branches of psychical\nresearch, and a guide to those original sources of information which\nin the course of more advanced study he will have need to consult.\nThe final decision \" as to the pros and cons \" of the subject, Mr\nCarrington says in his Preface, can be left to the reader, \" after he\nhas read and digested the facts. ... As to the facts themselves, I\nconsider these imdoubted. They exist : they are genuine : they are\nsupernormal.\" This seems to us unduly to simplify a very difficult\nI problem. Even in a book which does not claim to be more than a\nsummary, the student must not be allowed to assume that all\ninvestigators are equally trustworthy, and all alleged facts equally\nwell established ; and from time to time ]\\Ir Carrington puts the\nstudent on his guard. The criticism of evidence which he gives lis\nis so sensible and good-tempered, that we could have wished he had\n\f142 Journal of Society for Pf^ychical Research Novejibeu 1930\ngiven us more of it. As a result of his self-denial in this respect,\nsome parts of his book seem rather out of focus.\nAfter a brief introductory section on the scope of psychical\nresearch, the proper attitude of the investigator, and the question of\nfraud, three chapters are devoted to a historical summary, in which\nwe are glad to note that the formation of the S.P.R. and the work\nof our founders are given due prominence. This part of the book\ncontains much useful material, well arranged, and the same may\nbe said of the succeeding chapter, entitled \" Psychology and\nPsychical Research.\"\nThe long section on physical phenomena which follows, is in our\nopinion less satisfactory. The difference between alleged fact and\nestablished fact, between trustworthy and untrustworthy recorders,\nis not sufficiently stressed. In one case Mr Carrington speaks of\n\" the complicated social, personal, ethical, physical and psychological\nfactors involved \" as a hindrance to forming a just estimate of the\nfacts : the same might, we think, truly be said about a good deal\nof the material in this section, which nevertheless contains much of\ninterest, especially where Mr Carrington deals with mediums whom\nhe has himself investigated.\nThe mental phenomena are well summarized : we only wish that\nmore space had been devoted to them. The arguments for and\nagainst survival are judiciously recapitulated. There is an excep-\ntionally full bibliography, in which asterisks (rather lavishly\ndistributed) mark the more important books.\nW. H.

Sao Paulo :\nMiguel Karl, 1929. Price 12 milreis.\nIt is fairly well known that the Brazilian medium Mirabelli is\n\" celebrated \" (to quote the titlepage) not only for his astounding\nfeats in the domain of the physical phemonena of psychical research,\nbut also for his alleged mediumistic writings in numerous languages\nand on many subjects, purporting to emanate from the spirits of\ndeceased persons, most of them eminent. In the present book we\nare given a considerable number of these writings and we are now\nable for the first time to estimate their value.\nWe may consider first the languages in which they are written.\nThe text of the book under review contains scripts written in English,\nHebrew, Greek, French, and German, in addition to Mirabelli's\nnative Portuguese and his father's native Italian. This is merely\nthe order in which the languages mentioned first appear in the book.\nThe amount of material in each language, however, varies consider-\n\fNovember 1930 Revietvs 143\nably. The mass of the script is in Portuguese ;\napart froni this only\nin French are there any long passages, totalling about thirty-five\npages. There is a total of about one and a half pages in German,\nincluding one fairly long script. The other languages occur in small\nfragments only, totalling a page and a half of English, two-thirds of\na page of Italian, a dozen lines of what may pass for Hebrew, and\nfive words of Greek. Except in fragmentary facsimiles of Oriental\nscripts, we are given no examples of any of the other numerous\nlanguages in which Mirabelli is stated to have written (pp. 9-10).\nIndeed, the book under review makes clear the basis of that claim.\nMirabelli evidently writes freely only in Portuguese and in stilted\nFrench. Sometimes, however, the supposed communicating spirit\nrounds off a message with a few words in his own or in some other\nlanguage. Thus, Cromwell, after three pages of Portuguese, adds a\ndozen lines in English, beginning :\n\" Till now I did write in Portu-\nguese, that's for me a foreign language, but presently I must show\nyou I have not yet forgotten my dear mother country and my loved\nenglish tongue, that I spook in my youth \"\n(p. 102). Newton signs\nhimself :\n\" Newton The man of the apple He who has ears ... he\nwho has eyes ... as you know from the holy books \"\n(p. 88). And\nLombroso concludes a message in French with a few lines in English,\nGerman, Italian and Portuguese, in which he challenges the \" Herren\nDoktors \" to explain the medium's command of languages, the\nEnglish lines being : \"I hope this proof will be more than to make\nyou believing, oh ! men ! you that always be in doubt. Jesus clear\nand help you ever and for ever. Good by the same [that is, Lom-\nbroso] \"\n(p. 159). The scraps in foreign languages are often quota-\ntions {e.g. \" It is not growing like a tree in bulk ; doth make Man\nbetter be !\n\" Newton, p. 86), and it is noticeable that the language of\nsuch quotations, as in the instance just given, is much more\naccurate than that of \" original \" material.\nIt is obvious enough that this kind of thing hardly justifies a\nclaim that the medium \" writes \" in many languages, and it is\nequally obvious that, linguistically, such scripts as these do not\ndemonstrate anything supernormal, even if we could rely on the\ntexts printed being uncorrected, which we cannot, since facsimiles\nof none of the scripts printed in this book are given. But this need\nnot be an insuperable difiiculty for the spirit-hypothesis if the\ncontent of the scripts prove to be significant. The Brazilian sup-\nporters of Mirabelli clearly consider his communications to be of\ngreat value. The justice of this view must necessarily remain a\nmatter of opinion. I can only give it as my considered judgment that\nthe scripts are very largely quite uncharacteristic, in an evidential\nsense, of their supposed authors, that they contain no evidence of\nsupernormal knowledge, and that the moral instruction which forms\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research November 1930\nthe bulk of them consists of the tritest and most stereotyped\nsentiments, inspired largely by Allan Kardec and by popular notions\nof Indian philosophy. There is certainly nothing in them beyond\nthe reach of a man of Mirabelli's linguistic associations and com-\nparatively good education.\n\u2022\nTheodore Besterman.\nPseudo-Prophecies and Pseudo-Sciences. 8vo, pp. 98.

In this \" report \" only\ntwo of the papers read at the Congress are mentioned, while more\nthan half of it deals with a paper that was not read.\nTijdschrift voor Patapsychologie, September 1930.\nThis number contains a valuable notice of the distinguished\nDutch psychologist, the late Professor G. Heymans, by Dr Brug-\nmans. Psychical research, it will be remembered, is indebted to\nthese two investigators for one of the most important series of\nexperiments in thought-transference. Mr Price contributes an\narticle (accompanied by a portrait of himself seated in his labora-\ntory), on the present state of psychical research in Great Britain.\nIt is Mr Price's opinion that the S.P.R. is now obsolescent, and that\npsychical research has been revolutionised by the foundation of his\nlaboratory.\nTh.

G.

At last it has come to pass\nthat a book entitled The History of Spiritualism ^ boldly affirms :\n1 By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1926) i. 146.\n\fDecember 1930 The Aetiology of a ''Psychical\" Legend 149\n\" We may fitly end this short review of the early days in America\nby an event where spirit intervention proved to be of importance in\nthe world's history. This was the instance of the inspired messages\nwhich determined the action of Abraham Lincoln at the supreme\nmoment of the Civil War. The facts are beyond dispute. . . .\n\"\nAnd it has come to pass that a magazine purporting to be devoted to\nresearch ^ declares :\n\" There is a remarkable story extant in regard\nto the influence which led Lincoln to conceive the idea of emancipa-\ntion and to act upon it by the issue of his famous proclamation. It\nseems authentic and if so, it deserves to be widely known.\" When a\nlegend has reached the point that it is sponsored by what to many\nreaders are authorities, when it then attracts editorial attention from\nthe Bo.ston Herald, and revives in Spiritualist ^ and other periodicals,\nit is time to confront it with an array of historical facts, and of\ninterest to trace it to its origins.\nThe learned writer of the magazine article says that \" the credit\nfor the preservation of this story is due to Mrs M. E. Williams,\" ^\nand after grateful acknowledgment that\n'\n' our thanks are due to this\nlady for her kind permission to reproduce the story,\" proceeds to\nreproduce it as embodied in a pamphlet by ]\\L:s Williams, and, she\ndeclares, told by Colonel S. P. Kase * of Philadelphia to her, and set\n^ Psychic Research (Xew York, March 1930), xxiv. 115.\n2 E.g., Light (London, 26 April 1930), 1. 199.\n^ Mrs Williams, the author of the pamphlet referred to {Abraham Lincoln\u2014\nFacts Indisputable, 4th ed.), was invited by prominent French Spiritualists, in\n1894, to give sittings for the materialization of spirits in Paris, and planned a\ntour over Europe, which was suddenly terminated by her exposure in that city,\nin the home of a Spiritualist, by Spiritualists, including M. Leymarie, of the\nRevue Spirite. She was \" grabbed \" and found in the pantaloons and other\ngarments appropriate to a male spirit, and the mask and drapery which stood\nfor another spirit, and other apparatus, were discovered. The whole matter\nwas published in a special supplement to Light (1894, xiv. 545-52 ;\ncp. xiv.\n566-9), and was extensively printed in American journals. I may instance the\nXew York Sun of 23 November 1894, which published cuts from photographs\nof the paraphemaUa. The lady has since had a variegated career. Within\nthe last decade a clergyman and his wife, acting under my instructions, twice\ncaught her impersonating a spirit.\n* Col. Kase was a very prominent Spiritualist of the more credulous type.\nI have an abundance of material showing that he was deceived by some of\nthe most notorious tricksters of his time. His reports of what took place in\nhis presence were so far from the facts that I would not trust his memory or\njudgment for anything he said on the subject of Lincoln and mediums, because\nI would expect that any interest which the President showed in the way of\ntrying out mediums would be exaggerated and warped out of semblance to the\nreality. The fact that Col. Kase was \" fully assured in his own mind \" that\nLincoln was influenced by messages through a medium to issue the Emancipa-\ntion Proclamation, weighs little in view of the cases of fakery of whose genuine-\nness he was also fully assured.\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1930\ndown at her request so that it should not be lost to posterity. This\nversion, in honour of Mrs Williams, who is thus credited with its\nsalvation from oblivion, we will call the W-version.\nAccording to the W-version, then, Col. Kase obeyed a voice which\ntold him, as he was walking on a street in Washington, to enter the\nhouse of a medium named Conkling, who at once engaged him to\ncarry a letter written by himself (Conkling) to the President.\nConkling, however, accompanied Kase, but remained in an adjoining\nroom while the latter, equally a stranger to Lincoln, presented the\nletter which stated that its writer had been sent \" by spiritual\ninfluences to confer with you regarding the interests of the nation.\"\nLincoln consented to see Conkling and did so the following Sunday.\nFour weeks later Kase was present one evening in a certain house,\ntogether with President and Mrs Lincoln and other persons, when a\nyoung girl advanced toward Lincoln with closed eyes and said :\n\" Sir, you were called to the position you occupy for a very great\npurpose. The world is universally in bondage. It must be\nphysically set free, so that it may mentally rise to its proper status.\nThere is a spiritual Congress supervising the affairs of this nation as\nwell as a congress at Washington. This republic will lead the van of\nrepublics throughout the world.\" This is as Col. Kase remembered\nit at this telling, and he added :\n\" This was a text on which she\nlectured the President for a full hour and a half, dwelling strongly\non the importance of the emancipation of the slaves ;\nsaying that\nthe war could not end unless slavery were abolished.\" He also\nthought he remembered hearing \" the child \" predict that the North\nwould undergo no military reverses after the issue of the proposed\nproclamation. Then \" the little girl \" woke, and a lady began to\nplay the piano. ^ Finally, according to Kase, Lincoln, a few weeks\nafterward, issued the proclamation, to take effect on 1 January 1863,\nand Kase was quite certain that he was caused to do so by the\nmessage through \" the child.\" ^\nBut it happens that the world does not owe such a debt of grati-\ntude to Mrs Williams, after all. Many years ago, at a time when\n^ At tliis point the magazine omits the only sentences of the Colonel which\nmake the piano interesting ; his statement that one side of it hopped four\ninches above the floor, in time to the music, and continued to do so with four\nmen roosting upon it.\n2 It may also be noted that according to Mrs Williams's pamphlet Mrs May-\nnard was for two years, 1863-186.5, \" engaged exclusively by President Lin-\ncoln, and made her home in the White House where she gave the President\nseances almost daily.\" This is a fearful perversion of the facts, as measured\nby the statements of Mrs Maynard herself, who claims to have given \" a number\nof seances with President Lincoln and his wife \" in February and March 1864,\nand mentions only seven other meetings with him, several of which were\ncasual only.\n\fDecember 1930 The Aetiology of a \" Psychical \" Legend 151\nthat lady's illustrious career was not far advanced, Col. Kase told\nthe story to Mrs Emma Hardinge Britten, who embalmed it in her\nNineteenth Century Miracles (1884, pp. 484-7) published in 1884.\nThis we will call the B-version. Moreover, as Mrs Britten informs\nus, the tale had been told by him still earlier, and printed in a\nSpiritualist paper called the Spiritual Scientist, and the B-version\nincludes extracts from that organ.\nThere are many discrepancies between the two versions. ^ Accord-\ning to B \" the President looked somewhat disappointed,\" and it is\nexplained that the name sent in, S. P. Kase, gave Lincoln the\nimpression that S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, had called.\nAccording to W, the President was \" apparently a little frightened,\"\nand it is explained that Kase much resembled George Washington\n(to meet whom, in 1862, one would naturally be a bit startled).\nIn each version Kase purports to give a copy of the letter ; the two\nare not verbally identical, although essentially so. The versions of\nthe trance address verbally differ more widely, although the trend of\nthought is similar. This is shown by the first sentences of B :\n\" You, sir, as President of the Republic, are called to the position\nyou occupy for a very important purpose. The world is not only\ngroaning under the weight of mental and spiritual bondage, but four\nmillions, made in God's image, are enduring physical slavery.\nTheir yokes must be broken, the fetters must be severed,\" etc.\nAnd by a sentence farther on :\n\" This civil war will never cease ;\nthe shout of victory will never ring through the North, will never\nreverberate along the valleys of the South ; the olive-branch of\npeace will never wave over your fields, and lakes, and mountains,\ntill you issue a proclamation of freedom\u2014a proclamation that shall\nset forever free the enslaved millions of your distracted country.\"\nThe effect of all this eloquence, says Col. Kase, \" was that President\nLincoln was convinced as to the course he should pursue ; the\ncommand coming from the all-seeing angel world was not to be\noverlooked, so like a faithful servant, when convinced of his duty,\nhe feared not to do it and to proclaim freedom by the Emancipation\nProclamation to four millions of slaves. That Proclamation was\nissued on September 22, 1862, to take effect the first day of January,\n1862.\"\nI have no objection to any proof the \" all-seeing angel world\n\"\nmay give as to the validity of its messages, but should lose something\n^ One queer item of Kase's story may be noted in passing. He reported\nthat he advised the President to write a letter to Conkling making an appoint-\nment with him, although all the while that gentleman was sitting in an\nadjoining room. To those who remember how accessible Lincoln was it is\nincomprehensible that, having become interested in Conkling, he did not call\nhim in then and there.\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1 930\nof my respect for Lincoln if he accepted a mere mediumistic harangue\nas proof. Still, if this is history, we must accept it. Fortunately\nthe good Colonel said something else, which enables us to estimate\nhis reliability as a historian.\nIn the version told to Mrs Williams, he added : \"I believe we had\ntwenty-six battles after this great event [the preliminary proclama-\ntion of 22 September], and all were successful on the Union side\nexcept possibly one or two unimportant skirmishes.\" This affirma-\ntion .\nseemingly applies to the remainder of the war, and is an\negregiously mistaken one. Of major defeats which the North after-\nward underwent there may be cited the battles of Fredericksburg,\nChancellorsville, Chickamauga, Cold Harbor, Petersburg. Grant\nfought battle after battle with Lee in the Wilderness campaign,\nwhich battles certainly were not victories. Among minor defeats\nmay be listed the battles of Drury's Bluff, Olustee, Sabine Crossroads,\nPleasant Hill, Pine Mountain, Kenesaw Mountain, New Market.\nIf the Colonel was capable of such contradiction of public records of\nhis own day, how could one rest content on his uncorroborated story\nof an unrecorded mediumistic speech which took place years before\nthe telling ?\nIn the B-version, we find the Colonel saying that it was, not\nthrough the rest of the war, but \" in the intermediate time \" between\nthe two proclamations that there occurred twenty-six battles, and\nnow he says that \" every one of them was a success upon the Union\nside.\" By the time of the W-version his formula had somehow got\ntwisted, but the earlier one was only a shade less false. For between\n22 September 1862 and 1 January 1863, came the terrible Union\ndefeat of Fredericksburg, the defeat of Sherman at Vicksburg, the\nfailure of Eosecrans at Stone River, the stalemate of even the iron-\nwilled Grant, and on the very day of the final proclamation the\nrebels broke the blockade of Galveston. Instead of being a period\nof victory it was one of special gloom for the North.\nConsidering that Kase was able to imagine and allege a military\nUtopia which never existed, that he apparently recorded not a line\nof the trance address and only vaguely attempted to fix its date as\n\" some three or four weeks \" before the preliminary proclamation,\nthat he told his story years after the proclamations and the war and\nLincoln's death had passed into history, and that the sentences\nattributed to the medium cannot be verbally correct or they would\nnot so markedly differ in the two versions, even if I knew no more,\nI should say that without impugning Col. Kase's honesty in the\nleast, I could only infer from his yarns that the medium probably\nsaid something about freeing the slaves, about the war and about\nthe country.\nBut I do know something more, as does every person familiar\n\fDecember 1930 The Aetiology of a \"Psychical\" Legend 153\nwith American history, and that is, that on 22 July 1862, Abraham\nLincoln read to his Cabinet the draft of a preliminary proclamation\nof emancipation, fully a month before, according to Kase, he listened\nto the trance-address from \" the all-seeing angel world \" which\n(still according to Kase) first convinced him that such a proclama-\ntion should be made. The only reason it was not actually issued\nthat month was because it was thought best to defer it until after a\nUnion victory. When Lee had been checked in the battle of\nAntietam, 16-17 September, it was determined that a fit time had\ncome. This explodes the legend thoroughly.\nBut there is more to learn. In the B-version we find that the\nmedium was Nettie Maynard (really, at that time, Nettie Colburn).\nAnd she, as it happens, thirty-nine years ago wrote a book entitled\nWas Abraham Lincoln a Spiritualist ? (Philadelphia 1891). Mrs\nNettie Colburn Maynard included in this book her version of what\nhappened on the same evening with Lincoln which Kase had in mind,\nand of the trance-address. She had every motive not to minimize\nthe facts.\nThe first particular which strikes our attention is that the medium,\nwhom Kase remembered as \"a little girl,\" (he calls her this thrice, and\nsays that she reminded him of the scriptural passage about \" babes\nand sucklings \") in 1862, was, according to her own testimony, \" a\nmere child \" in 1845, and that she began to engage in public lectiu^ing\nin 1856. That is, she was probably not less than 22 years old, and\nvery likely older, when she delivered the celebrated trance oration.^\nThe next fact which we discover from her testimony is that the\ntrance address, the first time she ever saw President Lincoln, was not\nsome time in August, as Kase remembered it (although even that\ndate was fatal to the claim that she inspired the preliminary pro-\nclamation), but sometime in December 1862. ^ But the preliminary\nproclamation had been issued more than two months before, and\nthis had declared that on 1 January 1863, all slaves in States then\n1 Mrs Maynard also told of the terpsichorean piano but stated that its\nsaltations occurred before her oration, not after it as according to Col. Kase.\n2 A little chronology will be useful, to show the slow evolution of the idea of\nemancipation in Lincoln's mind.\nLincoln from the beginning of the war favoured compensated emancipation.\nHe brought about a joint resolution of Congress to pay for the slaves of any\nstate not in rebeUion, and signed it 10 April 1862.\n16 April he signed an act aboHshing slavery in the District of Columbia.\n12 July 1862 he met a delegation from the border States and urged that these\naccept compensated emancipation.\n13 July he told Secretary Welles that after much thought he had about\ncome to the conclusion that it was a military necessity to proclaim freedom to\naU the slaves.\n17 July he approved an act freeing slaves under certain military conditions.\n21 July he read to the Cabinet a draft of a proclamation of emancipation to\n\f154 Journal oj Society for Psychical Research December 1930\ncontinuing rebellious would be legally free. The absurdity of\nclaiming that Nettie brought about the act already in esse, or the\none already in posse, needs no accentuation.\nBut Nettie herself does not make the claim, or anything like it.\nShe admits that she knew that the final Proclamation was at hand.\nThis is her entire account of the address, the parts she thought most\nimportant italicised as she italicised them. Beginning with the\nstatement that no one but Lincoln seemed to understand her\n'\n' until\nthat portion was reached that related to the forthcoming Emancipa-\ntion Proclamation,\" she goes on thus :\n\" He was charged with the\nutmost solemnity and force of manner not to abate the terms of its\nissue, and not to delay its enforcement as a law beyond the opening\nof the year ; and he was assured that it was to be the croivning event\nof his administration and his life, and that while he was being coun-\nselled by strong parties to defer the enforcement of it, hoping to\nsupplant it by other measures and to delay action, he must in no wise\nheed such counsel, hut stand firm to his convictions and fearlessly\nperform the work andfulfil the mission for which he had been raised up\nby an overruling Providence.\" ^\nbecome effective on 1 January 1863, but it was judged best to postpone it\nuntil after a Union victory.\n6 August he signed an act freeing all slaves employed in rebel military\nservice.\n1 3 September he made a long reply, which has been preserved, to a committee\nfrom Chicago religious bodies urging him to issue a proclamation of emancipa-\ntion. In it he gave no hint of his intentions.\n22 September he issued the preliminary proclamation, following the battle\nof Antietam, giving notice that on 1 January 1863, all persons held slaves in\nterritory then in rebelhon should be free.\n1 December he again urged his plan of gradual comj^ensated emancipation.\nThis producLag no results, on 1 January 1863 he issued the final Emancipation\nProclamation.\n^ Since Mrs Maynard turned from the temptation of endorsing Kase's claim\nthat she inspired Lincoln to emancipate the slaves and told so tame a story of\nwhat occurred, her honesty is beyond question. However, one is not compelled\nto accejit her inference that since Lincoln glanced at Webster's portrait on the\nwall he implied a conviction that the \" Defender of the Constitution \" had been\naddressing him, nor that her memory of the conversation which ensued was\nverbally exact. I do not believe that an intelUgent official asked the President\nif pressure had been brought to bear upon him to \" defer the enforcement of\nthe Proclamation.\" That word enforcement echoes the medium's naive\nassumption that the President could give the impending Proclamation immed-\niate effect in the actual liberation of the slaves in rebelhous States. Conse-\nquently it is unlikely that Lincoln replied : \"It is taking aU my nerve and\nstrength to withstand such [my itahcs] a pressure,\" though he may well have\nsaid that there was opposition to his plan. And did not the medium know\nthat ? His message of 1 December to Congress had been printed in the news-\npapers, and that had said that \" among the friends of the Union there is great\ndiversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African race\n\fDecember 1930 The Aetiology of a \"Psychical\" Legend 155\nHere is not a word about the world being universally in bondage,\nor about the impossibility of the war ending unless slavery should\nbe abolished, or about victories which would result, or any of the\nhifalutin contained in Kase's two versions. She first saw Lincoln\nmore than two months after the preliminary proclamation and within\na few weeks (nobody gives exact dates) of the final one, which was\nalready absolutely determined upon, and which nothing short of the\nsurrender of the States in rebellion or the death of Lincoln could\nprevent. All that the medium did, according to her own account,\nwas to exhort the President to do what he had announced he would\ndo, to tell him this would be a very important thing, which he knew\nalready, to entreat him to be true to his convictions, which was his\nlife-long habit, and to direct him not to delay the enforcement of the\nProclamation beyond the first of the year, whereas it was absurd to\nsuppose that he could enforce it before the downfall of the Rebellion.^\nKase says that the lecture was \" so grand and sublime \" that the\n\" little girl must have been imder deep control of the spirit of some\nancient philosopher.\" Mrs Maynard hints that this \" ancient\nphilosopher \" was Daniel Webster !\nI do not believe that Kase was a conscious liar, but that he was a\nvery badly mixed up old gentleman. To remember a young woman\nhardly less, and very likely more than 22 years old, one who began to\ndeliver public lectures six years before, as a \" little girl,\" a \" child,\"\nis alone sufficient to show that his memory was in a mussy condition.\nThe date he assigns to the trance-address is inconsistent with the\nclaim that it brought about the document already existent in\nwriting. His varying but equally untrue affirmations regarding\nvictories show how unreliable he was. And the statement of the\nmedium herself utterly refutes his story, except for the commonplace\nfacts that Nettie was there and harangued the President about his\nproclamations concerning which everyone then had knowledge.\nIncidentally a pretty story told by the medium Conkling to Mrs\nBritten must go into the ash-barrel too. Roused probably by the\ninterest taken in Kase's dreamy memories imparted to the Spiritual\namongst us. Some would perpetuate slavery ; some would aboHsh it suddenly\nand without compensation ; some would abolish it gradually and with com-\npensation,\" etc. The pubUc knowledge of these utterances deprives the\ntrance-oration of its last scrap of significance.\n^ Nineteenth Century Miracles was regarded as a Spiritualist masterpiece ; it\nwas in print seven years before Mrs Maynard printed her book, and it is\nimpossible that she was not famiUar with the Kase story. Her accoimt of\nwhat really happened must be regarded as a conscious and dehberate contra-\ndiction of the tale credited by the Spiritual Scientist and by Mrs Britten. She\ndid not expressly denounce that tale, probably out of respect for \" the female\nSt Paul of the movement \" (See Doyle's History of Spiritualism, i. 138), whose\nbook had given it wide circulation.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December 1930\nScientist, one of which, was that Conkling spent four Sundays with\nLincoln, this medium told Mrs Britten that his spirits \" spelled out,\nletter by letter, the preliminary draft of that famous document.\nThe result of these interviews was the President's proposition to his\nCabinet to issue such a proclamation.\" Alas ! Kase informs us\nthat these four Sundays immediately preceded the occasion when\nNettie first met the President, and she tells us that she first met him\nin December. But the prelimiary draft had been read to the\nCabinet in July, and, substantially unaltered, had been issued in\nSeptember !\nThe stages in the evolution of the legend, then, were somewhat\nas follows :\n1. Nettie Colburn, in December 1862, when all the country was on\ntiptoe awaiting the final Emancipation Proclamation, had the\nopportunity to display her mediumistic oratory before President\nLincoln. Stimulated by the stirring events happening and about\nto happen, she, in what piirported to be a trance state, made a very\nordinary address, telling him that the freeing of four millions of\nslaves would be the greatest act of his life, and exhorting him to\nstick to his announced purposes against all opposition\u2014as any\ncoimtry parson might have preached to him.\n2. During the years that followed. Colonel Kase, so credulous that\nhe was the delight of tricksters, and so befuddled that the last thxee\nmonths of 1862 appeared to him a period of uninterrupted Union\ntriumph, really remembering that Nettie had told the President\nsomething about a proclamation freeing the slaves, and that she had\nappeared to him to be very eloquent, gradually and unconsciously\nconcocted for her, in his mind, an unstable speech, and developed\nthe conviction that it first suggested to Lincoln the idea of issuing\na proclamation of emancipation, guileless of the fact that the date\nhe assigned to the interview by itself defeated the claim.\n3. After the incident had become thoroughly transformed in the\nlaboratory of the Colonel's mind, its importance impressed him to\nthe point of telling it in the Spiritual Scientist.\n4. The tale attracting wide attention among Spiritualists, the\nmedium Conkling became dissatisfied with the minor part assigned\nto him therein, and gave out the story that his controls dictated,\n\" letter by letter,\" the preliminary proclamation, although again\ndates refute the claim and, were it true, it would completely annul\nKase's allegation that the President was indebted to Nettie for the\nidea. Kase, although so familiarly associated with Conkling, was\nevidently ignorant of this feature.\n^\n^ The two stories, (1) that Nettie Colburn inspired the preliminary Proclama-\ntion, and, (2) that Conkling dictated it verbally rest, each upon the testimony\nof one person alone. But the cynical Muse who presides over the growth of\n\fDecember 1930 The Aetiology of a \" Psychical \" Legend 157\n5. \" The narrative in substance was given to the author,\" that is\nI\nto Mrs Britten, by Col. Kase himself, but as she passes on, for the\nmost part, the Spiritual Scientist version, she probably made no\nwritten record of the tale he told her, consequently we do not know\nwhat variations it contained.\n6. Mrs Nettie Colburn Maynard, the heroine of the Kase tale,\ndemolished it in a book of her own, but it already had too much\nimpetus to be thus stopped.\n7. Kase told the story with many verbal and a few factual varia-\ntions to Mrs Williams who, not being addicted to research, supposed\nthat she was the discoverer of it, and printed it anew.\n8. Ignoring the medium's own repudiation of the claim that she\ninfluenced President Lincoln to declare emancipation, and neglecting\na historical chronology not difficult of access, a professed history\ninsists that Nettie Colburn \" determined the action of Abraham\nLincoln at the supreme moment of the Civil War,\" and that \" the\nfacts are beyond dispute,\" ^ a professed researcher is impressed that\nthe story \" seems authentic,\" a newspaper which professes nothing\nbut a desire to impart news thinks the claim worth editorial attention,\nthe legend starts again on its world-wide travels, and the indignant\nghost of Mrs Maynard protests in vain.\nNATIONAL LABORATORY OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nAs is stated in the Minutes on p. 148 above, on the 30th of October\nMr Price addressed to some Members of Council a letter suggesting\nan amalgamation of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research\nwith the S.P.R. The Council carefully considered the question,\nand replied to Mr Price's letter on the 14th of November. But\nbefore he had received the Council's reply, Mr Price, on the 12th of\nNovember, circulated to all the members of the S.P.R. his original\nletter to Members of Council. Under the circumstances it seems\nuseful to place the two letters on permanent record.\nI. Mr Price's Letter to Members of Council.\nI Dear , 30th October 1930.\nI should like to bring to your notice that at the next Council\nMeeting of the S.P.R. a proposal will be made that something in the\nlegends has perpetuated the one which long ago was repudiated by its heroine,\nand allowed to lapse into \" innocuous desuetude \" the other, which has never\nbeen refuted until the present writing.\n^ Doyle bases his certainty, strange to say, not upon the Kase story, but that\nof Mrs Maynard, which does not in a single sentence, or by any uiference that\nSherlock Holmes himself could draw from it, support the notion that Lincoln\nwas influenced in the least by any medium on earth to emancipate the slaves.\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psycldcai Research December 1930\nnature of an amalgamation should take place between my Society,\nthe National Laboratory of Psychical Research, and the Society for\nPsychical Research.\nI intend in the near future to give up my present Rooms, and\nreasons of health compel me to look forward to a less active part\nthan hitherto in such matters. Nevertheless, I by no means intend\nto give up work entirely, and I am therefore desirous of incorporating\nmy organization with that of some other similar one. I am definitely\naverse to joining forces with a society frankly spiritualistic ; I am\nalso reluctant to let my Library and Laboratory fall into foreign\nhands. There remains the Society for Psychical Research, the only\norganization in England with aims similar to those of the National\nLaboratory, and I feel it incumbent upon me to offer them the use\nof my property.\nI therefore decided to make the S.P.R. the offer of :\nL My Library.\n2. The apparatus of my Laboratory.\n3. The benefit of sharing in the investigation of such mediums\nas I have obtained in the past and hope to continue to\nobtain in the future.\n4. The accruing of such members as care to transfer from my\nSociety to the S.P.R. in view of the proposed amalgama-\ntion.\nIn return I should, of course, expect to take a major part in all\ninvestigations brought about through my agency, and generally\nto co-operate with the S.P.R.\nI realize that it might be impossible to accommodate my Library\nuntil some little time in the future, and that other matters might\nneed careful thought and adjustment. But I am at the present\nmoment negotiating with one or two well-known mediums with a\nview to further investigation, so that items 3 and 4, referred to above,\nshould find immediate fulfilment.\nThe question of accommodating my Library and Laboratory\napparatus would, admittedly, need careful thought and adjustment\n\u2014possibly not until some future date. But the immediate terms of\nthe bargain, roughly, are that the S.P.R. gains financial help and\nshares in the investigation of such mediums as I have every hope of\nsecuring from time to time ; and that I gain a means of continuing\na life's interest with the aid and co-operation of a society, in England,\nwhose work and aims are similar to my own.\nYours sincerely,\nHarry Price, Honorary Director.\n\fDecember 1930 National Laboratory of Psycliical Research 159\nII. Reply by the Council.\nDear Mr Price, 14 November 1930.\nYour circular letter of October 30tli to the Members of\nCouncil has been most carefully considered by them, and we have\nbeen asked to exj)ress to you their appreciation of your offer and\nof your regard for the S.P.R. and its aims.\nThey have considered the matter under the four heads set out in\nyoiir letter, and their reply is as follows :\n(1) Owing to the fact that the part of the house not at present in\nour occupation is let on lease, the likelihood of om* being able, in the\nnear future, to house your library, which we are informed you wish\nto have kept intact, seems remote.\n(2) The same applies to the apparatus of your laboratory taken\nas a whole.\n(3) With regard to future possible investigation of mediums, the\nCoimcil would gladly arrange for you as a Member of the Society to\nhave the use of the seance-room for this purpose in accordance with\ntheir ofier as printed in the Journal for November 1928, and would\ntemporarily accommodate in the room any of your apparatus that\nyou need in any such investigation. You are doubtless aware that\nthe room has already been used in this manner with results which\nseem to have been satisfactory to all concerned.\n(4) As regards a possible accession of new members, it is unneces-\nsary to say we should gladly welcome an addition to our Membership\nfrom among those who are at present associated with your work, it\nbeing understood that they would be proposed and seconded in the\nusual way. We must however remind you that our financial\nposition has for some years past prevented us from electing Associates\nat \u00a31 Is., and that our Membership subscription is \u00a32 2s.\nYours sincerely,\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick,\nW. H. Salter.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nA Correction.\nTo the Editor of The Journal.\nDear Sir,\u2014By this post I am sending you a letter which I must\nrequest you to publish verbatim in the next issue of the Journal of\nthe S.P.R.\nThe letter of Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, which appears in the\nOctober issue of the Journal contains the imputation that Mrs\nI\nHon. Secretaries.\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Decembkr 1930\nBradley acted fraudulently at a seance. It is calculated to do\ndamage to her reputation. Had such, a letter been published in the\npublic Press, I should have taken immediate action.\nI must ask you to acknowledge receipt of this letter.\nYours faithfully,\nH. Dennis Bradley.\nSir, \u2014In the issue of the Journal of the S.P.R. for October 1930\non page 120 there appears a letter from Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo,\nunder the heading of \" A Correction.\" This letter is so worded that\nit contains the imputation that Mrs Bradley acted fraudulently at a\nsitting with Valiantine in Genoa, by having simulated a certain\n\" phenomenon.\" The letter also states that Herr R. Lambert, of\nStuttgart, has communicated valuable evidence bearing on the same\nsittings to Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nSuch statements are calculated to do grave damage to Mrs\nBradley, and I must request that this allegation be immediately\nwithdrawn.\nThe facts are as follows :\nOn the morning of Mrs Bradley's departure from Genoa to\nVenice, May 22nd, 1929, Signor Rossi, in the presence of the Marquis\nCenturioni, told Mrs Bradley that Signor Castellani had stated that\nduring the sitting held on the previous night he had caught hold of\nher hand or wrist. Mrs Bradley unequivocally denied that such a\nthing had happened and, trivial and meaningless as the assertion\nwas, she requested that Signor Castellani should be brought to her in\norder to ascertain exactly what was implied. Her request was\nevaded and the Marquis Centurioni said that Signor Rossi should\nnot have mentioned the matter.\nSince the insignificant incident was connected with other un-\nfounded and disproven allegations regarding Valiantine, Mrs Bradley\nwrote from Venice demanding an explanation. In a letter to her\ndated May 28th, 1929, Count Centurioni wrote \" Signor Castellani\nwill write to you direct.\"\nSignor Castellani did not write to Mrs Bradley ; nor has he ever\ndone so.\nOn her arrival in Venice Mrs Bradley informed Count Bon of the\n\" incident.\" Count Bon is a Viennese gentleman, with a consider-\nable reputation for his knowledge of psychical research. He wrote a\nvery sharp letter to Signor Castellani, and he (Signor Castellani)\nsuggested a telephone conversation, which Count Bon declined,\nsaying that Signor Castellani must state in writing the allegation\nwhich he had verbally made. Signor Castellani did not do so.\nWhen I saw Signor Rossi in London on June 18th, 1929, I referred\nto this matter. Signor Rossi at once said :\n\" It is nothing\u2014Signor\n\fDecember 1930 Correspondence 161\nCastellani has withdrawn the suggestion he made. We wish to say\nno more about it.\"\nComplete detailed reports of the Valiantine sittings in Italy were\npublished by me in \" Light,\" and appeared in the issues of September\n21st, September 28th, October 5th, and October 12th, 1929.\nIn psychical research I suppress nothing, as scientifically, I\nconsider to do so renders the records negative.\nInsignificant as it may appear I gave the full particulars of the\n\" incident \" regarding Mrs Bradley. It was only after this, in a\nbelated attempt to justify himself, that Signor Castellani wrote a\npersonal letter to Signor Kossi, on November 12th. It should be\nnoted that Signor Castellani did not write to Light, nor to me, nor to\n]\\Irs Bradley, as he obviously should have done.\nThis is the extent of the valuable evidence on which Count\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo implies that Mrs Bradley simulated a\ncertain \" phenomenon.\" It is such trivial and infantile assertions\nthat degrade the work of psychical research. Valiantine's medium-\nship does not depend upon the absurd basis of so-called psychic\n\" touches.\" It depends only upon mental evidence of personality\ngiven in the \" direct voice \" of the communicating entity.\nMrs Bradley's research work has been recorded in many volumes.\nTo imply that she, or anyone, would imagine that any evidential\nvalue whatever could be placed upon such an absurdity as a touch\nof the hand is ludicrous. What is of far greater moment is the\nveiled manner in which a triviality is seized upon by Count Perovsky-\nPetrovo-Solovovo, and published in the Journal of the S.P.K.\nwithout reference to details and facts, in a manner calculated to\nmislead the members of the Society.\nYours faithfully,\nI H. Dennis Bradley.\n[We would once more point out that anything printed in the\nJournal is not \" published,\" since the Journal is printed for private\ncirculation only, and that the responsibility for all comanunications\nprinted by the Society rests entirely with their authors. Count\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo wTites : With regard to Mr Bradley's\nletter I will content myself with observing : My only object in\nwriting to the October Journal was to correct, as I said, an involim-\ntarily mistaken statement\u2014or which seemed to me mistaken. Had\nit been the reverse, I should have acted in precisely the same way,\nmy only desire being to give a fair summary of the Continental\ncontroversy about the Valiantine sittings. There was on my part\nno \" imputation \" on Mrs Bradley ; such was not my intention, and\nI much regret that anything I have written should be taken by\nMr Bradley as being in any way an \" imputation.\"]\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research December iflso\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nEtudes, 20 May 1930.\nFather Lucieix Roure reviews the second volume of Brother Benoit\nPadey's work entitled Traite complet des secrets de la bagette et du\npendule des sourciers (Paris 1929), a book which he thinks \" strange\n\"\nin some respects, chiefly on account of some \" really marvellous\nprecisions.\" Thus Brother Padey asserts the existence of five kinds\nof electricity to which would correspond five electric zones. Else-\nwhere we read that in order to detect diseases the operation must\nhave 83 degrees of courage and 90 degrees of will. Brother Padey\nhaving himself operated on springs with a dose of courage amounting\nto 97 '5 ! Father Roure mentions other instances about as discon-\ncerting, not the least being the extreme simplicity with which the\nwriter he reviews claims to cure diseases (about 130 altogether)\nthrough the application of minerals, the excess or absence of which\nin the human body is, Brother Padey thinks, the cause of all\nailments.\nDie Umschau, 19 July 1930.\nCount von Klinckowstroem contributes an article on an alleged\nprophetic dream relating to the death of the percipient (a schoolboy\nof Ledci, Czechoslovakia) by drowning. The investigation under-\ntaken by our Corresponding Member conclusively shows that we\nhave here to deal chiefly with a newspaper stunt, though a certain\namount of coincidence remains, since the boy was in fact drowned\nsoon after having a dream to that efiect, as briefly described by him\nin writing at school. The details of the dreaming and of the actual\ndrowning do not agree.\nScherls Magazin, September 1930.\nThis number contains an utterly sceptical article on spirit-\nphotography by Count von Klinckowstroem. Of particular interest\nare his references to a paper by Jos. H. Kraus of New York in a\nspecial number of the review Science and Invention describing what\nseem to be entirely new methods in this domain, which methods\nafiord, alas, one more striking instance of misdirected human\ningenuity !
