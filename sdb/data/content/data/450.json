Barrett, Dr. A. T. Myers, and Messrs.\nF. W. H. Myers, Frank Podmore, H. Arthur Smith, J. Herbert Stack,\nand H. Wedgwood.\nProfessor Alexander, of Rio Janeiro, was elected a Corresponding\nMember of the Society.\nTwo new Members and flight new Associaies, whose names and\naddresses are given on the previol1s page, were elected.\nInformation was received with regret of the death of Mr. Alexander\nTod and Mr. R. H. Pilcher, two Members of the Soeiety.\nSome presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donol\"ll.\nA vote of thanks was also passed to Mrs. Mahlon Sands for a\ndonation of three guineas to the funds of the Society.\nVarious matters of routine business were attended to.\nThe previous in~ntion of holding a General Meeting in November\nwas confirmed (Friday, the 16th, was subsequently fixed upon as the\ndate), and it was agreed that the Council shall meet on the same\nday.\nAn interim Meeting of the Council was held on the 25th of October,\nat which London Members only were present, for the purpose of\nelecting four new Members and eight new Associates, whose names and\naddresses are included in the list on the previous page.\nA HAUNTED HOUSE.\n.BEING FURTHER NOTES ON CASE G 314 (JotlntaZ, April, 1888).\nt\nReaders of the Journal will remember that an account was given\nin the April number of various apparitions and other occurrences\nwhich led the inhabitants of a certain house to regard it I\\S haunted.\nThe house in question was taken for the months of August and\nSeptember by a member of the Society, in the hope that residence\nthere for some weeks might lead to some light being thrown on the\nsubject. He stayed there himself for the greater part of that time,\nand had friends at different times to stay with him.. Nothing, how-\never, tending either to confirm or to destroy the more important part\nof the previous evidence occurred. Still, a few points of interest were\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1888.] Journal of Society for P8ychical Resea1'ch. 323\nnoted, and these, together with some additional facts learnt from the\nwitnesses previously cited, form the subject of the present paper.\nThe following brief account of the apparitions seen was given by\nthe ladies of the house, Mrs. and Miss S., to Mr. Myers in May last,\nand will recall to the reader the previous narrative :-\n\" There are certainly four separate ' ghosts,' if not more.\n1. The maid-servant, seen oftenest. DreBS light mauve, quite plain in\neut; Face pale, not often well seen; full face when seen by Mrs. S.\nshowed some cast or other defect in left eye. Expression ordinary. Hair\nsometimes down her back, sometimes done up. No cap ; parting of hair\nbroad and white.\n2. The lady, about 35, dreBSed in silk or other soft !Jlaterial ; red shawl\nor opera cloak,apparently thrown over one shoulder and twisted round neck.\nFace rather pleasing. Has been very well seen, especially by Mrs. S.\n(JO'I.IImaZ for April, p. 249), when a large nightlight was burning quite near\nfigure.\n3. The man, seen frequently leaning half out of attic window, window\nbeing open, and observer in garden. Expression not disagreeable; dark face\nand whiskers, coat high round neck. Often seen in garden, especially by\nWinnie Thome, aged 12, sister of Emilie, who used to see him in the garden\nnight after night, to her great alarm, and run downstairs in nightdress to\ntell Emilie. She (Winnie) thought someone had c~me to take the fruit..\nOddly enough, Emilie never could see him at these times, though this (with\na similar instance with Mrs. S. and Winnie) is the ouly case in which one\nof the ghosts was seen by one person, but invisible to others looking that\nway. Once MiBS S. I18W him in garden also, when Wiunie had given the\nalarm, and a neighbour was summoned and garden searched, but no one was\nthere. It would not be difficult for trespassers to get into garden; but the\nform seen by Winnie Thome in garden was plainly not a real man, or\nEmilie would have seen him too. Nor was there shadow or effect of light\nto explain it. If the man in white dress seen by Miss Humble (p. 249) W&8\nthe same ghost, the expression as well &8 dress must have changed; and so\nalso if the evil face seen by Mrs. Serpell was this same man.\nIt is noteworthy that part of the house was once used &8 a racing stable;\nand there may have been low characters about.\nFigures have twice appeared on January 22nd, but we cannot connect\nthat date wi;h any known event.\n4. A child-ghost must be added to the list, though it has not been seen.\nMrs. S. heard the gleeful clap of hands and laugh of a child, say of four years\nold, so clearly just behind her that she turned sharply round, thinking for\nthe moment that one of her Sunday-school class must be in the room; but\nthere was no one. The pattering sound as of a child's bare feet was ala.\nmarked.\"\nOne or more of these various figures have been seen by eight\npersons, namruy, Mrs. and Miss S., their servant Emilie Thorne (who\nremained in the house through August and September, and appeared to\nthose of us who made her acqua.intance to be a sensible and trustworthy\nDigitized by~6ogIe\n\f3241 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1888.\nperson); Mrs. Serpell, a former servant of Mrs. S.'s; Mrs. Trays and\nWinnie Thorne, sisters of Emilie; Miss Blencowe and Miss Humble,\nfriends of Mrs. and Miss S. All the apparitions have occurred within a.\nperiod of three years.\nThe following rough plans, which we owe to Colonel Taylor, will\nma.ke the various accounts a little clearer :-\nFIBST FLOOR.\nBedroom\nI--_!-r-,~_..,!.I .La 1----,-----,.-1, 1-1 1---...,\nL.......j i'IF ' Ba~h \"IIIIDo'll'D\n==I=I-~I --\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7cuitaiil\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 Room 1- ~\n- D~:g f,; j Blue Green [] Pink Bedroom\nL ~ - Room Room\nOr&tory I I\nII---l:\"\"'-_-!..__-l--II J.-.J-I 1-1-\"--II\nGBOtJKD FLOOR.\n'I-\nPlmtry\nI Curtain\n- I I 'I. .J' 1-1 I -\nThe house, which is marked A on the genera.l plan, stands alone in\nits own garden. It was formerly a farmhouse, and when Mrs. S. first\n7ed, ~O qk\n\fNov.,ll!l!8.] Jowrnal Of Society f01' Psychical Resea1'ch. 325\ntook possession of it in 1884 did not include the part beyond the Green\nRoom. This part was then a cottage, but was thrown into the house\nin 1885, when other alterations were also made. These alterations,\napparently, made no difference to the \"ghost.\" Before they were\nmade the entrance was opposite the foot of the staircase, and the\npresent hall was the kitchen, the large chimney of which now forms a\nuseless block up the middle of the house. Mrs. and Miss S. think that\n.. disturbances seem usually near this chimney, or in the rooms above\nthe cellar, which is a very large one, paved with stone,\" under the\ndining room. The attic, mentioned above, is over the drawing-room and\nlooks towards the main street of the village. The attic window is very\ndearly seen from the garden. The rooms are rather small and low,\nand the staircase, so often mentioned, is a short, steep flight. The\nfigures have thus been seen very close.\nThe house appears to have had no previous reputation of being\nhaunted, and the sound of footsteps in an empty room, about six\nmonths after Mrs. and Miss S. came into the house, was the first thing\nthat struck them as peculiar. This was in January, 1885. The appari-\ntions began later. It is difficult to make out the chronology, as the\ndates have not in all cases been recorded, but I think that the figure\nwith red jacket and candle, which M.iss S. took for her mother, was\nprobably the first thing seen, and either Mrs. Serpell's evil-looking face,\n(lr the appearance of the maid-sen-ant's figure at the top of the stairs\n(point marked F in first-floor plan) to Miss S., the second. By far the\nmost interesting apparition was the next, when Miss Blencowe, not\nJw,ving heard anything about the supposed ghost, saw a similar figure, as\n.(If a maid\u00b7servant, in the same place, on October 1st, 1886. Miss.\nBlencowe very kindly described her experience to Mr. Myers in May,\nand subsequently to Mr. Sidgwick and myself in September. She\nallowed us to question her as much as we liked, and gave her evidence\nwell. She is thoroughly convinced that at the time of this experience\nshe knew nothing about the haunting. Miss S., however (see p. 245),\nthinks that she had said something about \"the ghost\" just before\nMiss Blencowe saw the figure, though without any particulars what-\never. This seems to have been the only one of the apparitions which\nwas similar to what had previously been seen, and was perceived by a\nperson who had heard no account of it ;-except, possibly, the figure\nto be presently mentioned, seen by Miss E. S.; but of this we have no\ndetails.\nWhen Miss Blencowe, in the following February, again saw the\nfigure at the same spot, but from\u00b7 the opposite side, it was believed\nthat a pet dog saw it, too. Mrs. and Miss S. say :-\n\" Our two existing dogs, and a dog now dead (all that we have had in\nDigitized by Go\n\f..\n326 JouTnal of Society lor Psychical Research. [Nov., 1888.\nthe house). have fully shared, as it would seem, in the sight of the ghosts.\nWe do not keep a cat now. One of the dogs will not cross the Green\nRoom at dusk; whines at the open door, and has to be carried through.\nRepeatedly the dogs have stared and shivered when we could see nothing.\nIn the case described (p. 245, February 19th, 1887), when servant's ghost\nappeared during a party,the dog's shriek attracted everyone's attention. All\nlooked at the dog and probably thus missed seeing the ghost, whom Miss\nBlencowe alone saw-she being then clvse to the open door outside which\nthe ghost appeared...\nIt seems ':loubtful, however, whether the evidence is sufficient to\nsupport this explanation of the dog's behaviour. We learn from\nEmilie Thorne that he suffered from fits after this, if not before, and\nMrs. S. treated him for a fit on this occasion; it does not seem\nnecessary to suppose a supernormal origin for this fit.\nIt also seems doubtful whether the other persons presen:t failed\nto see the appearance on this occasion, because they did not\nlook in the right direction, or because it existed only for Miss\nBlencowe. We understood from her that she believed the latter, and\nthought that in following the dog Mrs. S. and her friend must have\npassed over the spot apparently occupied by the apparition. And\ncertainly from the description of its position I should have judged this\nto be the case.\nThe following is an account of Miss Blencowe's experiences, written\nby Mr. Myers after his interview with her, and which entirely agrees\nwith my recollection of what she said, except that I should have said\nnear a gas lamp instead of \"directly under\" :-\n\" Miss Blencowe, when she saw the girl (October 1st, 1886, and February\n18th, 1887), observed nothing wrong with her eyes [as Mrs. S. did when'\nshe saw a similar figure in December, 1887]. Noticed very white parting.\nbut does not think hair was thin; it came down low on forehead. Expres-\nsion was simply that of a servant waiting for orders. On each occasion\nthe girl stood within a few feet of her. The peculiar cold numbneBB which\nMiss B. felt was not due to fear; because (1) on the first occasion she simply\nsupposed the girl to be another servant whom she had not\" seen, not being\nthen intimate with the S.'s; and (2) on the second occasion the numbness\ndistinctly preceded the sight of the figure; in fact, it was the odd feeling of\nnumbness which made Miss B. look round. She' went down' to Mrs. S.\n(p. 2(6) because Mrs. S. had followed the dog downstaits and was pouring\nwater on him, supposing him to have had a fit. The figure on each occasion\ndisappeared as though into a comer, the head being last seen. On each\noccasion itstood directly under a gas\u00b7lamp, in the same place.\"\nThe frequency of the apparitions seems to have culminated in\nDecember, 1887,in which month Emilie Thorne twice, and Mrs. S.\nonce, saw a figure resembling the \"servant-ghost,\" and in which\nmonth also Mrs. S. saw the figure in the red shawl.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1888.] JO'Urru:U of Society for Psychical Reseq,rch. 327\nThe latest appearance recorded was a very singular form of halluci-\nnation. It occurred on June 13th, 1888, and was described as follows\nby Miss S. a few days afterwards :-\n\" 1 was coming up stairs about 10 o'clock at night. There was no gas\nlighted either up or down stairs, but the window blind in the passage was\nnot down. 1 had no light in my hand but was carrying little Stumpy. He\ntrembled when 1 picked him up and continued to tremble. When I was\nabout four steps from the top 1 saw a shadowy substance. 1 can scarcely\ndescribe it. It was about four feet high, in shape like a large toadstool,\nthe lower part was dark and the top was quite white. 1 walked on through\nit and went into my bedroom. After a' few minutes 1 came out again and\nwent slowly up and down the staire two or three times (of course without a\ncandle), to see if it were possible it was a shadow, or reflection of any kind,\nbut there was nothing to be seen.-F.S.\"\nThe following additional information about sounds and other\nphenomena was supplied to Mr. Myers by Mrs. and Miss S., who signed\nthe account written down by him from notes cf their conversation.\nTo the witnesses cited in JO'IIIr'\/wJ. three more may be added, viz. :-\n1. Miss E. S. (a cousin), who complained much of the banging of doors\nin Pink Room, between Grey and Pink Room a.ll night, as she slept\nin Grey [1 Green] Room. Begged that doors might be more carefully\nshut. Mrs. S. shut them carefully (had done so previous night also), but Miss\nE. S. stillheard them bang. These doors (I tried them and found them to shut\nwith ordinary firmness.-F. W. H. M.)do actua.lly open and close again, mOTe-\nment of handle being plainly observable. Miss E. S. was also frightened by\nnoisesonce when Emilie Thorne was at church, with the rest of the household;\nremarked to Miss S. that she had heard noises,but then saw someone whom she\nsupposed to be Emilie come back from church. Emilie was in church, so the\nfigure seen was probaBly the servant-ghost. Nothing was said to Miss E. S.\nas she is to come again at Christmas and would have been alarmed.\n2. Miss E. Maud Grepe [seen byF. W. H. M.] writes:\n\"I heard my name [Maud] called twice distinctly. and 1 answored\nComing! and on going into the room where the voice came from I found no\none had called. The voice BOunded like that of Miss S.\n.. (Signed) E. MAUD GRBPB.\"\n3. The German cook, mentioned p. 248, repeatedly heard herself called.\nShe could speak little English; and fancied that some one was playing\ntricks on her.\nThe hypothesis of tricks is practically out of the question. The phe-\nnomena have occurred under all conditions: e.g. (a) When we first came,\nwith servant brought from Plymouth, before Emilie came to us; (b) when\nEmilie was out; (c) when no one at a.ll was in the house (tace seen from\ngarden); (d) when Miss S. was alone in the house, &c.\nThe piano-playing has hardly been sufficiently noticed in JO'I.IIf\"n(J},.\nMiss Humble heard it play chants (p. 249). Miss Auchmuty heard chants, and\nEmilie\"Thome has heard it repeatedly when the drawing-room was empty-\nDigitized by Google\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nev., 1888.\nand once at lea.st when the piano W8.8 shut doom. No barrel organa come\nnear the house, and church is too far for organ to be taken for piano. The\nrooms are small, and the sound unmistakable.*\nWith this may perhaps be ranked the bell-ringing; but on some Occa.siODB\nat least when the bell is heard the bell actually moves. Once Mrs. and Mila\nS. heard two orthree bells sounding together, and Emilie saw them shakitl(.\nFor this phenomenon a plausible natural explanation might be suggested,\nas there are mice in the house.\nMovements of objects certainly occur.\n(a) Besides the case of re-lighted gas (p. 247) there was a remarkable CBBe\nof re-made and re-lighted fire. We had had a party in the drawing-room\n(where a fire is seldom lighted), and the fire had burnt itself out-nothing\nremaining in grate when we went to bed, about 10, except a mere handful of\nashes, with slight glow. At eight next morning Emilie told me that there\nwas a bright fire in drawing-room. I went and looked ; a large log W&8 in\nthe grate and burning brightly ; I think coala also. There had been wood\nin the room.\n(b) On one occa.sion, on going into the drawing-room in the mcrning.\nMiss S., who went in first, found a chair standing upon the sofa. Emilie\nhad not been into the room.\n(c) The alarum of Mi88 S.'s alarum clock has five or six times gone off at\n4.30 a.m., not having been set to that hour. This may be due tD BOrne\ndefect in the clock (though we can find none); but it is noteworthy thatabout\n4.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. are th.e times when most disturb8.nce occurs.\n(d) The removal and replacement of small articles continues.\nThe book mentioned (p.1252), as having been found after its unexplained\n1088, has now been again removed.\nLast Christmas Emilie brought up three florins (change on a bill) :0 Mrs.\nS.'s room, and placed them in a china cup on the dreBBing-table. An hour\nor so afterwards she re-entered the room, where Mrs. S. wa.s still in bed, and\nMrs. S. asked her for the coins. They were gone. A florin was taken from\nthe Pink Room a few weeks since, no one having been in the room except the\nVicar. These coins are always replaced aooner or later. Only florins are\ntaken. Aa this might sound like a servant's practical joke, it is well to say\nemphatically thbt Emilie Thome is no mere temporary servant, but a young\nwoman of high character and perfect trustworthine88, whom we have known\nfrom her childhood,and who came to us from the South of England expreBSly\nto serve us. The manifestations are in no way speciallY'connected with her\npresence, and she derives nothing but annoyance from thew. Neither ahe\nnor any of us arc timid; and we have no idea of leaving the house to the\nghosts.\n(Signed) F.S. M.S.\nMr. Myers himself writes as follows :-\nMay 21st, 1888. I have to-day seen .&fiBS Blencowe and Mrs. and Miu\nAuchmuty, and have learnt a few fresh particulars, a.s follows:-\nMiBS Auchmuty again stayed in the house in April, 1888. Early in the\nmorning of April 27th, 1888, she heard footsteps passing her room and some\n* See remarks on this further on.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov.,I888.] Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 329\none bruslung against handle of door outside. On inquiry the same morning\nshe found that no one had been up at that hour.\nMrs. Auchmuty, on April 18th, 1888, was sitting in the drawing-\nroom with a friend, when bot.h of them heard some one walking with\nheavy boots on in the attic above. They took for granted that some one\nhad been there looking for some objeot. No one had been there.\nMiss B. corroborates the 1088 of the ring (p. 251). It was simply placed\non the dressing-table, full in view, and left undist11l\"bed. A few minutes\nlater it was gone.\nOn Wednesday, April 25th, 1888. Miss Blencowe was awoke by feeling\nher bed shaken and pulled along the tloor for several inches. It was then\nquickly shoved back. The room was light, but no one could be seen.\nMrs. S. (seen by me to-day) was kept awake when trying to sleep\nyesterday afternoon, May 20th. by persistent pacing up and down in passage\noulsside her room. No one in the house was stirring.\nMay 22. I have to-day seen Mrs. and Mias Humble, at 12.Clarence-aquare,\nCheltenham. Mrs. Humble confirms the statement (p. 249) that. she heard\nfootsteps in drawing-room when stair was barred by boxes and no one in\nthat room.\nMiss Humble states that the female figure which she saw had no red in\nits costume ; seemed in deshabille. It was seen near the place (in the Pink\nbedroom) where Mrs. S. saw the woman's figure. The man whom Miss\nHumble saw had a pallid face, dark eyes, no beard or moustache. [It\nseems doubtful whether this was the same male figure as that seen by\nEmilie Thorne, &c.] r!'he piano was Mutwhen Mias Humble walked into the\nroom and found no one there, though piano had been playing.\nF. W.H.M.\nIt was, of course, important to ascertain whether the witnesaea in this\ncase were at all subject to hallucinations of the senses. Mr. Gurney made\ninquiries on this point but the answers did not all reach him till after the\nissue of the April number. He put them together as follows ;-\nMias Humble (writing on April 8th) says that she has on one\nother occasion seen a figure which appeared suddenly in a spot out of\ndoors, which she believed she had ascertained to be vacant the instant\nbefore; and this figure corresponded in aspect with an appearance which\nothers professed to have encountered at or near the same spot. It cannot\nbe regarded as certain that this was a subjective hallucination; as, on the\nsupposition that it had no reality of what we may call a \" psychical\" kind,\nwe still cannot be sure that it was not a real living person.\nMiss Blencowe writes on April 15th, 1888 ;-\" I have never before the\ntime stated in my written account, encountered any similar phenomenon,\nlights or sounds, in any other locality than at Mrs. S.'s house; in fact, until\nthe iirst appearance of the girl in lavender, I never believed in ghosts, nor\ndid I at the time know the house was haunted.\"\nMrs. Serpell writes on April 4th, that several years ago she twice saw\nthe figure of a man at the end of a passage, without being able to account\nfor the appearance; but she adds. \"I did not think much of it at the timt7,\nas I thought some one had been playing me a trick. I have never seen or\nDigitized by Google\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1888.\nheard anything else of the kind [i.e., of the same kind as the experiences in\nthe present case] anywhere.\"\nMiss S., who put the necessary question about hallucinations to others of\nthe witnesaeB, writes, on March 28th :-\" Emilie [Thorne] has never in her\nlife heard or seen anything supernatural.* Miss Helen Auchmuty has never\nseen anything supernatural. Mary Trays never had seen or heard anything\nsupernatuml, and made fun of Emilie till she lived in our house.\"\nMiss S. herself has had one hallucination of vision unconnected with the\npresellt case, representing a figure with a light. E.G.\nTo this Mr. Myers adds that he learnt from Mrs. S. that she had\nhad no previous hallucinations.\nOur own observations during a week spent in the house early in\nSeptember perhaps suggest explanations of some of the mysterious\nnoises.\nIn the first place I should describe the house as both a noisy and a\nricketty one, by which I mean that sounds and movements are easily\ntransmitted from one part to another. For instance, a servant walking\nabout in the attic is not only very audible indeed in the drawing-room\nbelow, but shakes the room considerably, making the door and windows\nrattle. Moreover, the presence of a parrot and other birds in the\nhouse should be taken account of in trying to explain noises.\nSecondly, we \u00b7think that the sound of a piano heard when no one\nwas playing in the drawing-room may very probably have come from\na piano in a neighbouring house. We heard such a piano, seemingly\nin the house marked B on the general plan, very distinctly indeed as\nwe sat in the drawing-room, one morning, with the window open. It\nwas equally distinct outside the'room. When the music was loud we\ncould even hear it quite well with our window shut. We were at\nhome the greater part of every morning during our stay, but this was\nthe only time we heard the piano, so that we may suppose that it is\nnot often played under similar conditions.\nThirdly, my friend Miss F., who stayed there with me and occupied,\nduring part of the time, the Green Room, was lying awake one night\nwhen she felt her bed jarred and heard something like a blow on it.\nImmediately afterwards she heard a metallic sound, proceeding, she\nthought, from the iron curtain rod, which divided off the end of the\nroom to serve as a passage (see plan). This sound was louder than\nthat made by tapping the rod with a door key and we could not\nimitate it by shaking the curtain rings. Miss F. imitated it at break-\n*This word was, of course, not used by me in the question which I put; but\nthe answer certainly is meant to convey the fact that the witnesses had not else-\nwhere, or on other occasions, seen things which it seemed impossible to account for in\nany ordi!lary way.-KG.\n\fNov\u2022\u2022 1888.J Journal of Society for Psychical Research. 331\nfast by striking two spoons together. Miss S. seems to have had\nsimilar experiences while sleeping in this room, though more intense.\n(See Jowrnal for April, pp. 243, 249.) In Miss F.'s case they occurred\nas our host came up to bed, as she knew by hearing him come upstairs\nand open and shut his door; and she heard the same sound, but fainter,\non another occasion, at the moment that my husband descended the\nstairs.\nWe found considerable difficulty in reproducing the sound; but did\nultimately succeed, by treading about over the upper steps of the\nstairs and the passage at the top, in making a faint sound of the same\nkind occur in the Green Room.\nMiss F. also had another experience, similar to one described in the\nJO'IJII\"IW,l (p. 242); and it should be mentioned, by the way, that though\nMiss F. ha.d read the April number of the Journal, she had no\nconscious recollection of the nature of the experiences described. She\nwas in the bath-room on the evening of her arrival, and, at the moment\nwhen I came up the back stairs and entered the Pink Room, thought\nshe heard footsteps coming along the oilcloth that extends from door\nto door of the Green Room. She thought it was the maid and opened\nthe door to see, but no one was there. She imitated the step for us.\nIt was short and quick (like a child's) and sounded, she said, like that\nof a person with bare feet or slipshod. We did not succeed in re-\nproducing this sound of pattering feet; but I think that this may have\nbeen because it is very difficult to reproduce the conditions for what,\nif connected with my coming upstairs at all, was probably a mis-\ninterpretation of some real sound. When Miss F. expected me to\ncome up the back stairs she was naturally not in the same menta.l\nattitude in judging of the sounds I made as when she had to infer the\nfacts entirely from the sounds. We found our experiments on sounds\ndifficult too, because they were constantly spoilt by noises in the house\nand outside.\nThis completes the evidence at present obtained on the subject.\nIf we try to review it as a whole we must admit, I think, that it is\ndifficult to draw from it any very definite conclusion. The evidence\nabout sounds, and about movements of objects may, perhaps, be left out\nof consideration for the present; the first because there seems, as I\nhave said elsewhere (Proceedings, Vol. III., p. 79), to be no sufficient\nreason for regarding unintelligent sounds as other than ordinary\nphysical ones merely because they have not been explained; and the\nsecond because the phenomena as described scarcely seem sufficiently\nbeyond the range of possible mal-observation and forgetfulness to\nwarrant us in attaching great importance to them. It is difficult to\nmake evidence of this kind convincing to those not actually concerned\nDigitized by Google\n\f:332 JOU1\"fUtl of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1888.\nin the occurrence, and, in fact, to be convincing it would almost need\nto be experimental. It would almost be necessary that the position of\nan object should be specially noted with a view to observing its sub-\nsequent disappearance. Some attempt has, I understand, been made to\nobtain evidence of this kind, but the objects have not so far dis-\nappeared.\nTurning to the sights ;-after seeing the place I should be inclined\nto suggest that the figure seen by Mrs. Trays in the garden was a real\nwoman waiting fer some one; and it seems possible that some of the\nother figures, namely the man seen in the garden by the little girl, and,\nperhaps, the man at the attic window, were illusions, that is, mis-\ninterpretations of real things seen. Further, I am inclined to think\nthat the apparition to Miss S. of her mother, and possibly some other\ncases may have been dreams. But after making all allowance for such\nexplanations there remains a considerable number of cases of genuine\nhallucinations of the senses, occurring with a frequency which is\ncertainly very remarkable when we consider that the percipients were\nnot seeing hallucinations elsewhere. And if we assume that the\nmajority of them may have been produced by self-suggestion, resulting\nfrom the idea that the house was haunted-an hypothesis which their\nvariety somewhat supports, I think- there still remains the central\npoint of the whole story, namely, Miss Blencowe's seeing what was\napparently the same figure as that previously seen by Miss S. and in\nthe same place, though knowing nothing of it. If this were the only\ninstance of such an occurrence we might attribute it to chance; but it\nis, as readers of the Proceedings and Journal know, by no means an\nisolated case. As to the cause of the phenomenon, we know nothing.\nWas it thought-transference-mental suggestion-from Miss S. that\ncaused Miss Blencowe to see what she did 7* Or was there some\nother mind, independent of both of them, or some physical cause, which\nproduced it 1 We cannot tell. We can only say that there is no\nknown person living or dead with whom to connect the figure.\nThe Society will of course wa.tch any further developments of the\ncase with interest. But it is to be feared that it will be difficult to\nobtain any future evidence from persons who have not heard of the\nhaunting, since the report of it seems now well known, at least in the\nimmediate neighbourhood; and when we were there it was a favourite\namusement with the village boys to serenade the \"ghost\" as the shades\nof evening fell.\nELEANOR MILDRED SIDGWICK.\n* It would seem probable from Miss So's account (p. 245) that she was thinking\nof the figure at the time.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1888.)

He has\nmesmerised, he tells us, at least 500 persons, mainly with a view to\u00b7\nalleviating suffering, and some of his patients have developed consider-\nable powers of a psychical kind, as the following cases will show.\nRothesay Villa,\nM. 6 College Park, South Australia.\nJuly 4th, 1886.\nStriking case of clairvoyance, which occurred May 28th, 1886, in the-\npresence of the Hon. Dr. Campbell, M.L.C., Hon. David Murray, M.L.C.\u2022\nand Chief Secretary of South Australia, Mr. Lyall, and Mr. Fleming.\nsolicitor :-\nThe circumstances are briefly as follows, viz. : Dr. Campbell being present\nat Qne of my usual clairvoyant evenings, handed me a gold aleeve-link, at:.\nthe same time telling me that he had lost the fellow one to it, but had no\nidea as to what had become of it ; he asked me to give the remaining one to\none of my clairvoyantes and see if they could find the missing one. I should\nstate that neither of the clairvoyantes had ever seen either of the rooms they\nreferred to, nor did they know the names of the children, or anything in\nconnection with this case, so that it is either a case of genuine clairvoyance,\nor else a most remarkable case of thought-reading.\nI first handed the sleeve-link to the young~r of the two sisters [Misses.\nEliza and Martha Dixon], who is not so lucid as her sister (I was giving\nthe elder one a reet as she had been hard at work, clairvoyantly, for the\npast hour).\nMiss Martha began by first accurately describing Dr. Campbell's features,\nthen spoke of a little fair-haired boy who had a stud, or sleeve-link, in his\nhand, also of a lady calling him\"Neil\"; then said that this little boy had taken\nthe link into a place like a nursery where there were some toys, especially\na large toy elephant, and that he had dropped the link into this elephant\nthrough a hole which had been torn or knocked in the breast; also that he\nhad taken it out again, and gave two or three other interesting particulars,\nbut as we were engaged in clairvoyantly investigating a most important\nmatter, we were reluctantly compelled to postpone further investigation until\ntwo or three evenings afterwards.\nOn the next occasion (in the interval, however, the missing sleeve-link\nhad been found, but left untouched), I again placed the link in her hand and\nthe previous particulars were at once reproduced ; but as she seemed to be\ngetting on very slowly, it occurred to Dr. Campbell to suggest placing his\nhand on that of the clairvoyante, so I placed him en rapport and allowed him\nto do so, he simply touching the back of her hand with the points of his\nDigitized by Go\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

As she still Beemed to have great difficulty (she is always\ninuch slower than her sister) in proceeding, it suddenly occurred to me that\nit would be an interesting experiment to place Miss Eliza Dixon en rapport\nwith Miss Martha, so 1 simply joined their disengaged hands, and Miss\nEliza immediately commenced as follows, viz. :-\n\"I'm in a house, upstairs, 1 was in a bathroom, then 1 went into another\nroom nearly opposite, there is a large mirror just inside the door on the left\nband, there is a double-sized dressing-table with drawers down each side of\nit, the aleeve-link is in the comer of the drawer nearest the door. When\nthey found it they left it there. 1 know why they left it there, it was be-\n-cause they wanted to see if we would find it. 1 can see a nice easy chair\nthere, it is an old one, 1 would like it when 1 am put to sleep, because it is\nnice and low. The bed has curtains, they are a sort of brownish net and\nhave a fringe of darker brown. The wall paper is of a light blue colour.\nThere is a cane lounge there and a pretty Japanese screen behind it, the\nscreen folds up. There is a portrait of an old gentleman over the mantel-\npiece, he is dead, 1 knew him when he was alive, his name is the same as the\ngentleman who acts as Governor when the GO\\'ernor is absent from the\n-colony,* J will tell you his name directly-it is the Rev. Mr. Way. It was a\nlittle boy who put the sleeve-link in that drawer, he is very fair, his hair is\nalmost white, he if! a pretty little boy, he has blue eyes and about three\nyears old.\n\"The link had been leit on that table, the little boy was in the nursery\nand he went into the bedroom after the gentleman had left. 1 can see who\nthe gentleman is, it is Dr. Campbell. Doesn't that little boy look a young\nTurk, the link is quite a handful for his little hand, he is running about with it\nvery pleased; but he doesn't scem to know what to do with it. [A. Dr.\nCampbell was not present from this point.] Now I can hear someone\n-calling up the stairs, a lady is calling two names, Colin is one and\nNeil is the other, the other boy is about five years old and is darker than\nthe other. The eldest, Colin, is going downstairs now, he is gone into what\nlooks like a. dining-room, the lady says 'Where is Neil 7' 'Upstairs, rna.' 'Go\n.and tell him to come down at once.' The little fair-haired boy had put the\nlink down; but when he heard his brother coming up, he picked it up again.\nColin says-' Neil, you are to come down at once.' 'I won't,' says Neil.\n, You're a goose,' replies Colin, and he turned and went down witho1it Neil.\nWhat a young monkey I now he has gone into the nursery and put the link\ninto a large toy elephant, he put it through a hole in front which is broken.\nHe has gone downstairs now, 1 suppose he thinks it is safe there.\n\"Nowthat gentleman has come into the roomagain and he wants that link ;\nhe is looking all about for it, he thinks it might be knocked down: the lady\nis there now too, and they are both looking for it. The lady says-'Are you\nsure you put it there 7' The gentleman S&ys, ' Yes.'\n\"Now it seems like next day, the servant is turning the carpet up and\nlooking all about for it; but can't find it.\n\"The gentleman is asking that young Turk if he has seen it, he knows\n* Chief Justice Way is thll,gentleman who acts as Deputy for his Excellency when\n:absent from the colony.-A.

The little boy says, \u2022No.' He seems to\nthink it is fine fun to serve his father like that.\n.. Now it seems to be another day and the little boy is in the nurseryagain.\nhe has taken the link out of the elephant, now he has dropped it into that\ndrawer, that is all I have to tell you about it, I told you the rest before.\"\nJuly 15th, 1886.\nSince writing the above 21 pages I have handed them to Dr Campbell for\nperusal so that he might check the account and ratify it or otherwise, and after\ngoing carefully through it he has returned it to me, acConipanied bya complete\nratification in writing, which I herewith enclose.\nA.

The conversation reported as passing between the children is\n~orrect. The description of the room is accurate in every point. The\nportrait is that of the late Rev. James Way. The description of the children\nand their names are true. 'rhe fact that the link was discovered in the drawer,\nin the interval between one sittmg and the final one, and that the link was\nleft there, pending the discovery of it by the clairvoyante, is also correct, as\nthis was my suggestion to Mrs. Campbell when she showed it to me in the\ncomer of tho drawer. In fact, every circmmstance reported is absolutely\n-correct. I know, further, that neither ot the clairvoyantes have over been\ninside of my door. My children are utterly unknown to them, either in\nappearance or by name. I may say also that they had no knowledge of my\nintention to place the link in their posse8Bion, or even of my presence at the\nseance, as they were both on each occasion in the mesmeric sleep when I\narrived.-ALLAN CAMPBELL.\nIn a later letter, written December 16th, 1887, Dr. Campbell\nwrites :-\n\"DEAR MR. DOBBIE,-Your London correspondent asks if I had any\nknowledge ofthe conversation that the clairvoyante stated had passed between\nthe children. I had no knowledge whatever of this conversation, nor the\ncircumstances attending it, until she repeated it. It was subsequently con-\nfirmed to me in part by Mrs. Campbell, such part as she herself is reported\nto have taken in the tableau.\n\" With respect to the large toy elephant. I oertainly knew of its existence,\nbut was not thinking of,it at the time the olairvoyante was speaking. I did\nnot know even by suspicion that the elephant was so mutilated as to have a\nlarge opening in its chest, and on coming home had to examine the toy to\nsee whether the statement was correct. I need hardly say that it was\nabsolutely correct.-I am, yours sincerely,\n\"ALLAN CAMPBELL.\"\nIn answer to inquiries as to whether Mr. Dobbie could send us a\n~opy of notes taken at the time of this experiment, he wrote on October\n17th, 1886 :-\nDigitized by Google\n\f336 JO'Il\/I'nal oj Society JOT Psychical Resea'l'ch. [Nov., 1888_\n\" Although since April, 1882, I have carefully taken notes of nearly all\nmy clairvoyant experiments (pencilling the words down the moment they\nare uttered), in the trinket [sleeve-link] case I considered that it would be\n80 very improbable that my clairvoyante would be able to do anything with\n80 little clue, that I did not think it worth while writin\" a single note, in\nfact, I should not have wasted time over the experiment but for fear of being\nthought disobliging. However, the result of that experiment has made me\nmore careful to record almost everything I attempt in that way.\"\nMr. Dobbie tells us that \"neither he nor his clairvoyantes had any\nopportunity, directly or indirectly, of knowing any of the particulars\nbrought out by the clairvoyante.\" He afterwards saw the room described,\nand says\" the description is simply perfect in every particular.\"\nM. 7.\nThe next case is of \" somewhat different type. Mr. Dobbie, writing\non October 17th, 1886, says of it:-\n\u2022\u2022 A few weeks ago a case occurred which I think I ought to send you, as\nit was tried as a test case. I am copying the notes, which I carefully took at\nthe time the words were uttered, and shall send them to several of the com-\npany who were present, and ask them to ratify them if they are correct. I\nwill then enclose it in this letter.\"\nHe calls it \"an apparently gElnuine case of Psychometry, or could\nit be Thought-transference 7\"\nThis evening (September 27th, 1886) Mr. A. Adamson, J.P., of College\nPark, handed to me what I thought was a very small chip of marble of dull\nwhite colour, and requested me to place it in the hand of Mr. Williams, my\nclairvoyant (who had already been asleep for some time) ; at the same time\nhe placed a sealed envelope on the table, which he informed t.he company\n(consisting of about 25 ladies and gentlemen) contained 8. brief account as to\nthe history of the specimen, and that no person in the room had the remotest\nidea as to the nature of the specimen ; but that the envelope could b9 opened\nafter the clairvoyant bad finished all he had to say about it. Mr. Adamson\nadded that he wished this mode of procedure carried out as he desired to test\nthe powers of the clairvoyant.\nOn placing the specimen (which was not larger than a grain of wheat) in\nthe hand of the clairvoyant, he proceeded to make a few remarks of 8.\ngeological nature, which had indirect reference to the snbject, and then pro-\nceeded as follows :-\n.. Now, I've gone back to where and when it was in the ground. Tbis ia\na very nice country, a foreign place; it is like a town; there seems to be 8.\nlot of things about this place; there seems to be people of different countries\ncome here, all foreigners. There is a very large circle or area enclosed here,\ncomposed of lh'UJ kind of stone, but oot aU 80 pure. The area has been dug\nout first. There are pillars about it; this has been a big place, a kind of\nshow place, foreign; there are lots of ruins, a lot has been carried away_\nThere are 8. lot of places like caves here where they put animals and anybody\ninto. I wouldn't care to be one of them.

They didn't go in there because they\nliked it, it was for the amusement of others. Some of these people in these\ncage places look nearly mad with terror, others of them don't Beem to care\nmuch. ThAy are just waiting to be ordered out when the people come.\nThe people are up all round here\" (here the clairvoyant waved his hand in a\ncircle above him, giving us the impression of extensive galleries where the\nonlookers sat). \"The people in the cage places are hungry and thirsty. There\nis going to be a big show here now. There are other cages or cave-like\nplaces on the opposite side of the'area with wild animals in them. Can't\nyou hear them roaring 1 They are being lashed up to make them wild, but\nthey are wild enough without that. They do that to make more fun for the\npeople. I would like to put those people there. I wonder how they would\nfeel if they changed places with those in the caves. The poor people in the\ncaves know now that it is nearly allover with them. The people are sitting\nhigh up all round. Now the doors of the cages are opened and the poor\npeople are ordered out, and a great big fellow is following the poor stdrved-\nlooking creatures, and lashing them towards the cages of the animals until\nthey are in front of them. Now the animals are quiet and are backing to\nthe backs of their dens. The men are going to try and fight the animals, but\nthe poor women are very much cut up about it. Now that big fellow has\ngone .out ; why doesn't the coward take his chance with the rest 7 There\nare four men and four women ; the men are telling the women to keep\nbehind them. They can't get back to their cages because the doors are shut,\nbut theyar e backing away from the animals' cages.\n\" 0 ! now the people at the top have pulled up the doors of the animals'\ncages ; the people seem to like this, and can see the eyes of the animals in\nthe dark cages. They don't feed the animals much. Oh, what a nasty\nhowl. They put their mouths near the ground and give a kind of blood\ncurdler. Don't those men look brave, but the poor women are nearly dead\nwith fright. Now the foul' lions, they look just like greatcats with their tails\nmoving about. Now they are crouching down getting ready to spring; the\nfour men are standing side by side, and the four women behind. The men\nhave no weapons and little clothes, simply a loose kind of blouse. They are\nfine-looking men; they appear to be getting ready to spring also, but it's no\nuse ; one of them sprang at the same instant as the lion, and nearly knocked\nhis hand through the lion's throat, but the lion struck him a blow on the\nforehead with his paw and killed him. Now the lions have killed them all\nand are playing with the bodies.\"\nAs it was long past our usual time for closing our experiments we were\nreluctantly compelled to postpone further investij[ations on that occasion. Mr.\nAdamson now informed the company that the specimen in the hand of the\nelairvoyant was a small portion of a mass of conglomerated or petrified bones,\nsaid to be the bones of the Christian martyrs who were slaughtered by wild\nbeasts, &c., at the Coliseum at Rome. He with his daughter visited\nthe celebrated Church of San Paolo Fuori Le Mura in Rome, during his\ntrip to the Continent several years ago, andan old priest being in charge of the\nplace showed them round, and amongst many other very ancient and interest-\n~ D\nDigitized by Google\n\f338 Journal of Society fOT Psychical Researoh.

Mr.\nAdamson bribed the priest to break offa small portion, which he brought a.way\nwith him, and the specimen in the hand of the clairvoyant was a small chip\nfrom it, so that the aCC'lunt given by the clairvoyant was wonderfully\ncorrect.\nThe following is a verbatim copy of the contents of the sealed envelope\nwhich Mr. Adamson placed on the table at the same instant as the clair-\nvoyant began his description. .\n\"Saint Paolo Fuori Le Mura, founded by Theodosius and Valen-\ntinian the 2nd, 388.

(None of them hesitated in the least after they had\nread it, and I do not allow them to sign until they have read it.) You will\nnotice that Mr. Adamson has made a reference to the note re the catacombs.\nHe is quite right, the question referred to should not have been put, and\neven if the reply had been specially correct it would not have had the\nsame amount of scientific value that the other part has, because all the rest\nwa! perfectly voluntary. I have always found it safer not to break the\nthread of their account by interjecting questions; it is best to ask the ques-\ntions after they have finished, and they readily clear up what had\npreviously appeared foggy. I ought to rcmind you of what I told you in my\nformer letter, that Mr. Adamson is a J.P., and is held in high repute in\nAdelaide on account of his remarkable sagacity. He was a thorough sceptic\non the subject of clairvoyance until he saw my experimenta, and as I allow\nhim free access to all my seancea, he has a good opportunity of forming an\nopinion.\"\nThis second case seems to be more easily explained by Thought..\ntransference than the first. For, if we suppose the clairvoyant to have\ngot from Mr. Adamson's mind the ideas of Rome and Christian martyrs,\nthere may have been material in his own mind for the development of\nthese ideas into the scene in the Coliseum.\nMr. Dobbie does not have uniform success with his clairvoyants.\n\"The part which puzzles me most,\" he remarks, \"is the fact that very\noften they are entirely wrong, even when I am fully aware of the\nnature or history of the specimen I place in their hands, also when the\nvisitors know. If it is Thought-transference, why should they often\ngo wrong when either I or others present know the nature of the\nspecimen 1\"\nIn answer to this we would suggest that nothing we yet know of\nThought-transference would lead us to expect constant success with\neven the best subjects.\nM. 666.\nIt will be interesting to compare with the foregoing a somewhat\nsimilar case where, however, there was no hypnotiser.

My wife is English, and\nat the time of my visit to America we had two children-a girl and a boy-\nand had loat one, a little girl who had died at the age of two months.\nIn the autumnof 1879, I visited the United Statea. Our object in going out\nto America was to inapect BOme iron and coal mines in the State of Tenneasee,\nDigitized b~gIe\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1888.\nbut before going South we did some \" sight-seeing,\" and on our way to the\nFalls of Niagam we stopped for a few days in Boston. 1 had heard and\nread a little about Spiritists and manifestations, but never seen anything of\nthe kind, and as Boston is a sort of hotbed for mediums and .. humbug\" of\nevery kind, 1 took tl.e opportunity, while there, to see some of the mediums,\none of whom was a Mrs. White, who called herself a trance medium. This\nMrs. White was a young woman of prepossessing appearance and ladylike\nmanners. She lived in a nice part of Boston (I cannot recollect the address),\nhad a fine house, and was evidently one of the fashionable mediums, and much\nsought a.fter, and 1 had some difficulty in getting an interview with her. J\ncame to her as a perfect stranger, did not give her my name, nor any clue as\nto where 1 came from, and what took place was as follows :-\nWe sat down opposite each other, with a small table between us, and she\ntook hold of b'Jth my hands. After a few minutes she went into a trance (or\nwhat she pretended to be a trance), and began a rambling speech about spirit-\nland and the future state; and after a somewhat long discourse, which\nappeared to me very nonsensical, she told me\u00b7 that 1 might ask her any ques-\ntions 1 liked, and she would try to answer them. This was just what I\nwanted, and 1 was ready with my questions to test her.\nFirst then, 1 asked: ,. Tell me if 1am married or single.\" \u2022\u2022 Married,\" was\nthe answer.\n\u2022\u2022 Well then,\" I said, \u2022\u2022tell me the name of my wife, and describeher to me.\"\nWithout much hesitation she gave me both my wife's names-Ada Maria-\nand a most minute and wonderfully correct description of her appearance.\nage, manners, temperament, &c. She then told me the names of my\nchildren, and gave me a minute description of what they were like-all per-\nfectly correct. \"Elsie, the eldest. one, she said, is a fair girl, rather like\nher father, and the little boy, Carl, has large brown eyes like his mother,\nHe is a clever little boy, but not very strong, and you must be careful with\nhim. You also call hir& Carley --at least his mother does-and little Hilma\n,that went into spirit land, she was a fine baby \"-and so on.\nEverything she said about the children was wonderfully correct, but what\nastonished me most was this. .After talking some time about my children\nshe suddenly said, \" Who i8 Maud! It seems to me as if there was another\nlittle girl called Maud-and yet-no! 1 am not certain aboutit.\" She then\nput my hand to her forehead and kept repeating, \"Maud,\" \u2022\u2022 Maud.\" Then\nshe said, \u2022\u2022 Was there another little girl that died, or what is it 1 1 cannot\nmake it out.\"\nNow the fact was this-my wife expected to be confined in December\n(this was in October), and we had agreed between ourselves that if it should be\na girl we would call her Maud. This of course was a subject that had never\nbeen mentioned except between my wife and myself.\nAs it happened, little Maud was born on the 25th of December, and isnoW'\neight-and-a\u00b7half years old.\nBefore leaving my hotel that morning 1 got a letter from my wife, and\nafter reading it I put it in my pocket. I asked Mrs. White, \u2022\u2022 Can you tell me\nwhen I shall have a letter from my wife 1\" The answer came straight: \"You\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1888.] JOW1\"Y\/,al of Society for Psychical Research. 341\nreceived one before going out this morning, and you have it now in your\npocket.\" \" Well then,\" I said, \"can you tell me what is in it 1\" But that\nshe declined to do.\nIn order to test her further, I asked her to tell me what my friends were\ndoing at home, at that moment. She said she could see them, and hear them\ntalking, and she then gave me a very correct description of my friends here\nin , mentioning their names and what they were like, and various\nlittle family matters.\nShe said, Fanny (my sister-in-law) was just at that moment playing on\nthe piano in the drawing-room, and that her mother (whom she described\nvery correctly) came in to tell her something, &c., &c. This I was not able\nto test, as when my letter arrived some 10 days afterwards my friends did\nnot recollect what they had been doing at that particular hour. She also\nmentioned several of my friends in Sweden by name, and gave me a correct\ndescription of them, said she could hear them talk in some foreign\nlanguage, which she did not understand, &C.\nI must, however, say that although, on the whole, she was very correct in\nher statements, and especially astonished me with the description she gave\nof my wife and children, she made several mistakes or what I should call\n\" bad guesses.\" For example, she insisted upon it that I had an uncle called\nJohn, which I have not, (it is, however, the name of my wife's uncle). She\nsaid my father would very soon pass into the spirit land. He is still alive\nand well, although it is nearly nine years ago. She told me I was going out\nWeston very important business, whereas I was going South. She intro-\nduced me to several cousins, and aunts, and friends, and relations whom I\nknew nothing about, and who are not in existence.\nThe above is the substance of my interview with Mrs. White. The whole\nthing is fresh in my memory, although it happened SODle years ago, and I\nhave before me a letter which I wrote to my wife the same day, and in which\nI gave her a full account of this wonderful woman. I should be very glad to\nhave your opinion on the subject. My own impression is that it was a very\nremarkable case of thought-reading.\nIn answer to inquiries our informant writes :-\n.Augwt 21st, 1888.\n'fhat Mrs. White should have, by any possible means, possessed herself of\nthe letter, read it and restored it to its place is quite out of question. 1st. I\ncarried the letter in the inside breast pocket of my coat, in a letter case with\nan elastic band round it. 2nd. The interview took place at noon, in full\ndaylight, and she was under my close observation the whole time. She\nnever left the room. 3rd. Before we sat down, we stood conversing for\ntwo or three minutes, and she was not close enough to me even to touch my\npocket, and when we sat down opposite each other with a small table between\nus (about two feet square), I held both her hands the whole time. 4th. If\nshe had seen the letter and read it carefully through, it would not have given\nher the information she Be&med to possess-not even my wife's name, as she\ndid not sign her name.\nDigitized by Google\n\f342 JO'U\/l\"nal of Society fO'1' Psychical Research. [lfov.,I888.\nM. 667.\nThe following case, given to us by General Barlow, well-known in\nthe American Civii War, has a considerable analogy with the previous\nones, but a new element is introduced in that the communication comes\nprofessedly from a departed spirit.\nIn the year 1884 I went to a medium in Roxbury, Boston, called Mrs.\nPhilbrick.She said many thingswhich I thought rubbish.I mentally summoned\na lady once known to me, not mentioning her name, as I believe, and asked\nher, \"Do you remember meeting anybody in a. church \"1 not mentioning the\nchurch. She answered, \"Yes.\" \"Do you remember anything that\nhappened 1\" \" Yes.\" \"What\" 1 \"Ella knows.\"\nWhat had happened was that this lady's skirt had come down in the\nchurch porch, and my Bister-in-law Ella was there and saw the accident_ I\nwas not there, and the incident in the porch of a country church could hardly\nhave been known to anyone else.\nThe woman had no notion who I was. It was mv first visit.\nThe church was a little village church, far from Boston.\nBrown's Hotel, Dover-street,\nJmy 25th, 1888.\nFRANCIS C. BARLOW, Major-General.\nThe following case of an unrecognised appearance has considerable\nclaim to be regarded as telepathic:-\nL. 8I8-Ad pn\nFrom Mrs. Hunter, 6, Victoria-creacent, St. Heliers, Jersey.\nJ'IIly 31st, 1888_\nA dear friend here, devoted to society and a leader in it, was taken\nsuddenly ill_ On January 10th, 1885, I had a good report of her, that sbe\nwas much better. A young man, nearly related to us, was lying 11e7\"!I danger-\nously ill in London at the same time. Well, that evening a white shadowy\nfigure passed me, almost touching me, as if to embrace me. \"That isn't\nFreddy!\" I said. .. Who can it be1\" My poor friend had died a few\nhours before.\nMrs. Hewett, Mrs. Hunter's daughter, confirms this account in\nthe following words :-\nJersey,\n.August 8th, 1888.\nI remember distinctly my mother coming out of her room on the even-\ning of January 10th, 1885, and saying, .. Someone has been in my room\nand it is not Freddy;\" Freddy being my stepSOD, then lying dangeroUBly\nill in London. I understoed her to mean someone not of this world, aa\nshe was in the haDit of seeing appearances, &c. Next day we learned\nthat a dear friend of hers and mine had died about two hours before\nmy mother said this.\nWe have received the decedent's name and have vp,rified thedate\nof death in a Jersey paper.\nDigitized by Google\n\fNov., 1888.] Jo'U'f\"rUil of Society f01' P8ychical Resea'l'ch. 343\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nThe following additions halle been made since the Za8t list:-\n*ALIENIsr and Neurologist (17 Nos.) ..................Bt. l.ouis, U.B..A. 1884-8\n*BAIN (Professor Alexander, LL.D.)Mental and Moral Science\n(2nd edition) .........................................................
