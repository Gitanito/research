He is the author, co-author&nbsp;and editor of many books and articles&nbsp;on parapsychology and other topics, including Debating Psychic Experience (2010), Varieties of Anomalous Experience (2014),&nbsp;and the multi-volume&nbsp;Advances in Parapsychological Research (1977-2013).

He has stated that all his interests date back to his childhood in some way.1 For instance, he became fascinat-ed by the Native American arrowheads that were unearthed while he was helping his father plough the fields; learning about the tribe that had lived there led him to study shamanism. He recorded his dreams from an early age, later becoming motivated to study dreams after reading about them in the popular press.&nbsp; He also developed an interest in hypnosis, after reading about it in popular articles.\n\nKrippner experienced a spontaneous psychic incident when he was fourteen. He had thought of asking his wealthy Uncle Max to buy him an encyclopedia, knowing his parents would not be able to afford it in the wake of a bad harvest. \u2018And then I thought \u201cNo, Uncle Max can\u2019t do it because he\u2019s dead.\u201d And as soon as I thought, \u201cHe\u2019s dead\u201d, the phone rang downstairs.\u20192 The call was from Max\u2019s daughter, bringing the news that he had died unexpectedly of a heart attack, despite being in his forties and apparently healthy.\n\nKrippner learned about parapsychology while taking a philosophy course at the University of Wisconsin. He organized a speaking engagement featuring JB Rhine, director of the parapsychology laboratory at Duke University, beginning a long friendship. He also began his own field investigations, debunking a poltergeist claim and a horse credited with an ability to tell fortunes, which he found was being directed by its owner using a coding system.\n\nAt Kent State University Krippner was in charge of a training and research program&nbsp;in children\u2019s speech, reading and learning issues. He gained his MS in 1957&nbsp;and PhD&nbsp;in 1961 at Northwestern University. He spent a summer in Hawaii working as a teaching assistant for parapsychologist Gardner Murphy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Krippner began attending the annual convention of the (American) Parapsychological Association. At the 1963 gathering he was introduced to parapsychologist Montague Ullman, who invited him to head the dream laboratory at Maimonides Medical Center in New York. Krippner worked there for ten&nbsp;years, experimenting with psi phenomena during dream states.\n\nHe later took a teaching position at Saybrook University in San Francisco (then named the Humanistic Psychology Institute), and has remained there ever since, dividing his time between teaching and research.  Contributions\n\nIn an appreciation of Krippner\u2019s work in parapsychology, Millay and Engelman write: \u2018His numerous publications on the multidimensional nature of consciousness are recognized as fundamental to the understanding that the mind is intrinsically entangled in the consciousness of life \u2013 the whole biosphere and the cosmos\u2019.3\n\nKrippner worked to bring psi into the mainstream of scientific research on the basis of this holistic view. He met Timothy Leary and took part in a psilocybin experiment, gaining the insight that psi activity is related to altered states of consciousness, and went on to demonstrate that psi could&nbsp;occur in altered states.\n\nThe Maimonides research expanded psi research by including the concept of consciousness in a deeper way. Krippner and his colleagues developed new techniques, such as waking subjects while they were dreaming in order to enable them to give immediate reports. They showed that telepathy, remote viewing and precognition in dreams can be demonstrated in the lab by means of a replicable method. The research also revealed that the occurrence of ESP is affected by the subject\u2019s personality and conscious and subconscious attitudes.\n\nKrippner was concerned to show that psi and shamanism are not pathological, arguing that paranormal experiences are more likely to occur within cultures that accept them than those that are not. He studied the effects of external influences on psi experiences, and collaborated with Michael Persinger, comparing many years of dream telepathy data with sunspot activity records of the same period in order to show that telepathy tends to be less accurate during times of high geomagnetic activity.\n\nKrippner was instrumental in bringing together parapsychologists worldwide and arranging means for them to share books and papers.&nbsp;As professor of&nbsp; Psychology at Saybrook, Krippner has guided students from America and elsewhere through doctoral programs that include parapsychological studies, helping establish and spread parapsychology globally.  Criticism&nbsp;and Comment\n\nWith regard to Krippner\u2019s dream telepathy experiments, psi skeptics complain of experimental flaws and lack of replication.\n\nBritish psychologist CEM Hansel alleged that the experimenter was with the agent or \u2018sender\u2019 (the person attempting to telepathically transmit a particular image to the sleeping subject, or \u2018receiver\u2019), while the agent was opening the envelope that contained the target image. If true, this would have been a potentially serious design flaw, since the experimenter was in communication with the subject and might have indavertently provided clues about the target. However, it is incorrect: the protocol required that the subject be asleep before a target was randomly selected and given in a sealed envelope to the agent, who, before opening it, was locked in a sound-attenuated room, sometimes in a different building.4&nbsp;Therefore, only the agent knew the identity of the target until the subject\u2019s judging was completed.\n\nA more general charge is that parapsychology experiments are not replicated. Psychologist James Alcock&nbsp;has claimed that the Maimonides dream telepathy experiments failed to provide evidence for telepathy and that in parapsychology \u2018lack of replication is rampant\u2019.5\n\nIn fact, some replications have been positive. In 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe carried out a&nbsp;meta-analysis&nbsp;on both the Maimonides experiments and the 27 studies of dream ESP that had been published since the Maimonides experiments ended. They concluded, \u2018When the study effect sizes are combined for the Maimonides and updated post-Maimonides studies, we can see that performance was better than chance with medium and small effect sizes, respectively.\u20196&nbsp;An updated meta-analysis&nbsp;by Storm et al, which included all studies carried out to&nbsp;2016 and was published in the International Journal of Dream Research, reaffirmed that the effect is real, and that \u2018dream content can be used to identify target materials correctly and more often than would be expected by chance\u2019.7\n\nSceptics James Alcock, Ray Hyman and Richard Wiseman were among the contributors in Debating Psychic Experience: Human Potential or Human Illusion?&nbsp;(2010)&nbsp;co-edited by Krippner.\n\nA 2012 article in the&nbsp;San Francisco Weekly stated:  \n\nProminent skeptic Ray Hyman praises Krippner\u2019s dream lab studies as \u2018interesting work\u2019 and admits \u2018there\u2019s no smoking gun to say they don\u2019t have something.\u2019 But he adds, \u2018no one has ever duplicated the striking success of the Maimonides Dream Lab.\u20198\n\nIn the same article another sceptic, James Randi, commented:  \n\nThere are so few things in this field you can depend on, and there are so many people who are prejudiced and biased, but I can depend on Stan. And I don't think he\u2019s&nbsp;biased at all.9   Awards\n\nIn 2013, Krippner received the American Psychological Association Division 32 [APA] Award for Distinguished Lifetime Contributions to Humanistic Psychology. Other awards from the APA include the Award for Distinguished Contributions to the International Advancement of Psychology (2002), the Division 30 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Professional Hypnosis (2002), Senior Contributor Award (Division 17, Counseling Psychology) (2000), and the Division 32 Charlotte and Karl Buhler Award (Division 32, Humanistic Psychology) (1992). Krippner also received the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis Human Treasure Award (2013), the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD) Lifetime Achievement Award (2006), the Parapsychological Association\u2019s Outstanding Career Award (1998), the Dr JB Rhine Award for Life-Time Achievement in Parapsychology (2002), the Pathfinder Award from the [Association for Humanistic Psychology] (1998), and the&nbsp;University of Georgia&nbsp;Bicentennial Award (1985).
