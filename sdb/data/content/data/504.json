This prospectus has not been subjected to\nmuch instructive public criticism. It has been received, either with\nentire cordiality, or with guarded neutrality, or with uninstructive\ncontempt. Still, several private criticisms on that prospectus and\nquestions suggested by it have come to my notice j and it seems to me\nthat I might perhaps employ the few minutes of your time that I wish\nto take up in no better way than in replying to these criticisms and\nobjections.\nThe first question I have heard is, Why form a Society for\nPsychical Research at all at this time, including in its scope :not merely\nthe phenomena of thought-reading (to which your attention will be\ndirected chiefly this afternoon), but also those of clairvoyance and\nmesmerism, and the mass of obscure phenomena commonly known as\nSpiritualistic 1 Well, in answering this, the first question, I shall be\nable to say something on which I hope we shall all agree j meaning by\n\"we,\" not merely we who are in this room, but we and the scientific\nworld outside j and as, unfortunately, I have but few observations to\u00b7\nmake on which so much agreement can be hoped for, it may be as well\nDigitized by Google\n\fPirie Gene}fal,1tfeeting. [July 17.\nto bring this into prominence, namely, that we are all agreed that the\npresent state of things is a scandal to the enlightened age in which\nwe live. That the dispute as to the reality of these marvellous\nphenomena,-of which it; is quite impossible to exaggerate the scientific\nimportance, if only a tenthpart of what 'has 'been alleged by generally\ncredible witnesses could be shewn to be true,-I say it is a scandal that\nthe dispute as to the reality of these phenomena should still be going\non, thit.t sO mari.yoompeteiJ.t witnesses should have declared their belief\nin them, that so many others shoUld be profoundly mterested 'in'having\nthe question determined, and yet that the educated world, as a body,\nshould still be simply in the attitude of incredulity.\nNow the primary aim of our Society, the thing which we all unite\n,to promote, whether as believers or non-belieTers, is to make a sustained\nand systematic attempt to remOTe this scandal in one way or another.\nSome of those whom I address feel, no doubt, that this attempt can only\nlead to the proof of most of the alleged phenomena; some, again, think it\nprobable that most, ifnot all, will be disproved; but regarded as a Society,\nwe are quite unpledged, and as individuals, we are all agreed that any\nparticular investigation that we may make should be carried on with a\nsiI!.gle:.minded desire to ascertain the facts, and without any foregone\nconclusion as to their nature.\nBut, then here comes the second question, which I have had put\nby many who are by no means unfriendly to our efforts,-that is,\nWhy should this attempt succeed more than so many others that\nhave been made during the last thirty years 1 To this question\nthere are several answers. The first is, that the work has to go\non. The matter is far too important to be left where it now is, and,\nindeed, considering the importance of the questions still in dispute,\nwhich we hope to try to solve, as compared with otherscientific problems\non which years of patient and unbroken investigation have l?een\nemployed, we may say that no proportionate amount of labour hilS yet\nbeen devoted to our problems; so that even if we were to grant that\nprevious efforts had completely failed, that would still be no adequate\nreason for not renewing them. But, again, I should say that previous\nefforts have not failed; it is only true that they have not completely\nsucceeded. Important evidence has been accumulated, important\nexperience has been gained, and important effects have been produced\nupon the public mind. \"\nI say that important evidence has been accumulated; and here\nI should like to answer a criticism that I have privately heard\nwhich tends' to place the work of our Society in a rather invidious\naspect. It is supposed that we throw aside en bloc the result'!\nof previous inquiries, as untrustworthy, and arrogate to ourselves a.\nsuperior knowledge of scientific method or intrinsically greater trust-\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] . President'8 Acit1resa. 9\nworthiness-that we hope to be believed, whatever conclusions we may\ncome to, by the scientific world, though previous inquirers have\nbeen uniformly distrusted. Certainly I am conscious of making rio\nassumption of this kind. r do not presume to suppose that I could\nproduce evidence better in quality than much that has been laid before\nthe world by writers of indubitable scientific repute-men like Mr.\nCrookes, Mr. Wallace, and the late Professor de Morgan. But it is\nclear that from what I have defined as the aim of the Society, however\ngood some of its evidence may be in quality, we require a great deal more\nof it. I do not mean to dispute,-it is not now the time to dispute,-\nwith any individual who holds that reasonable persons, who have looked\ncarefully into the evidence that has been so far obtained, ought to be\nconvinced by that evidence; but the educated world, including many\nwho have gi.ven much time and thought to this subject, are not yet\nconvinced, and therefore we want more evidence.\nIf anyone asks me what I mean by, or how I define, \u00b7sufficient\n. scientific proof of thought-reading, clairvoyance, or the phenomena called\nSpiritualistic, I should ask to be allowed to evade the difficulties of\ndetermining in the abstract what constitutes adequate evidence. What\nI mean by sujficient evidence is evidence that will convince the scientific.\nworld, and for that we obviously require a good deal more than\nwe have so far obtained. I do not mean that some effect in this\ndirection has not been produced: if that were so we could not hope to\ndo much. I think that something has been done; that the advocates\nof obstinate incredulity-I mean the incredulity that waives the whole\naffair aside as undeserving of\u00b7 any attention from rational beings-feel\ntheir case to be not JJrimd facie so strong now as it was.\nThirty years ago it was thought that want of scientific culture was\nan adequate explanation of the vulgar belief in mesmerism and table-\nturning. Then, as one man of scientific repute after another came\nforward with the results of individual investigation, there was a quite\nludicrous ingenuity exercised in finding reasons for discrediting his\nscientific culture. He was said to be an amateur, not a professional; or\na specialist without adequate generality of view and training; or a mere\ndiscoverer not acquainted with the strict methods of experimental\nresearch; or he was not a Fellow of the Royal Society, or if he was it was\nby an unfortunate accident. Or again, national distrust came in; it wa.<i\nchiefly in America that these things went on; or as I was told myself,\nin Germany, some years ago, it was only in England, or America, or\nFranee, or Italy, or Russia, or some half-educated country, but not in\nthe land of Geist. Well, these things are changed now, and though I do\nnot think this kind of argument has quite gone out of use yet it has on\nthe whole been found .more difficult to work; and our obstinately\nincredulous friendBt I think, are now generally content to regard the\nigitized byGoogl\n\f10 First General Xeetif'lg. [July 17,.\ninterest that men of undispu'te!i lCientific culture take in' these,\nphenomena as an' unexplained mystery, like the phenomena them-,\nselves. '\nThen aga.in,'to tum to a dift'erent class of objectors, I think, though\nI do not wish to overrate the change, that the attituqe of the clergy has.\nsensibly altered. A generation ago the investigator of. the phenomena\nof Spiritualism was in danger of being assailed by a formidable alliance-\n,of scientific orthodoxy and religious orthodoxy ; but I think that this.\nalliance is now harder to bring about. Several of the more enlightened\nclergy and laity who attend to the state of religious evidences have-\ncome to feel' that the general principles on which incredulous science-\nexplains off-hand the evidence for these modem marvels are at least,\nequally cogent a\",crainstthe reCords of ancient miracles, ,that the two-\nbodies of evidence must primd facie stand or fall together, or at least.,\nmust be dealt with by the same methods.\nThen, again, a generation ago we were directedto go tQ the conjurers,\n'and told that we should Be\/) that the whole thing was conjuring. I quite\nthink that this direction was to a great extent just and important: it is.\nhighly desirable that the investigation of these matters should be carried\non by men who have tried to acquaint themselves with the performanC$\nof conjurers. But we can no longer be told oft:.hand that all the marvels\nrecorded by Mr. Crookes,Professor Zollner, and others, are easy conjuring:\ntricks, because we have the incontrovertible testimony of conjurers to the-\ncontrary. They may' be conjuring tricks, but they are at any rate tricks.\nthat conjurers cannot find out.\nFor these various reasons I think we may say that on the whole-\nmatters arc now more favourable for a.n impartial reception of the\nresults of our investigation, so far as we can succeed in obtaining\nany positive results, than they were twenty years ago. In saying\nthis I do not in the least wish to ignore or make light of the\nevidence that has been accumulated in recent years to shew that\nat least a great part of the extraordinary phenomena referred to\nSpiritual agency by Spiritualists in England and America arc really due\nto trickery and fraud of some kind. I had this in view when I said\njust now that important experience had been gained by preceding\ninvestigations. This is certainly part of the experience, and I\nbelieve that no Spiritualist denies its importance. It would, however,\nbe a mistake to suppose that investigators, or even believers in\nmesmerism or Spiritualistic phenomena, had not their eyes open\ntwenty years ago to the part played in these phenomena by\nfraud.\nMy interest in this subject dates back for nearly twenty years, and\nI quite remember that when I began to look into the matter, nearly\nevery educated Spiritualist that I came across, however firmly\nDigitized by Google\n\f\u00b7Prl8idenfs Address. 111.\nCOJlvinced, warned me against fraud, and emphasised his warning by\"\nimpressive anecdotes. It is merely a question of degree, and I think\nit would be generally admitted that recent experiences have changed\nthe view of many Spiritualists with regard to the degree. I think\nthat even educa.ted and scientific Spiritualists were not quite-.\nprepared for the amount of fraud which has recently come to light,\nnor for' the obstinacy with which the mediums against whom fraud\nhas been proved bve been afterwards defended, and have in fact\nbeen able to go on with what I may, without offence, call their trade,_\nafter exposure no less than before.\nAnd this leads me to the point which is chiefly characteristic of the-\nmethod of investigation which our Society will, I hope, in the main use.\nThough it would be a mistake to lay down a hard and fast rule' that we\u00b7\nmay not avail ourselves of the services of paid performers orpaid mediums,\nstill we shall, as much as possible, direct our investigation to phenomena..\nwhere no ordinary motives to fraud,-a.t any rate I may say no.\npecuniary motives,-(lILD come in. There has, of course, olways been\na mass of evidence of this kind. In fact, I think everyone who has\nbecome convinced of the reo.1ity of the phenomena, or has become\u00b7\nstrongly and persistently convinced that there is a primd facie-\ncase for investigation, has had his attention first attracted by\nnarratives of what has gone on in private families or private circles..\nwhere none but relatives or intimate friends have been concerned.\nNow, the great gain that I hope may accrue from the formation of-\nthis Society is that the occurrence of phenomena-primd facie\ninexplical?le by any ordinary natural laws-may be more rapidly\nand more extensively communicated to us who desire to give our\ntime to the investigation, so that in the first instance we may\nca.refully sift the eTidence, and guard against the danger of illusion\nor deception which even here may, of course, come in; and then,\nwhen the evidence has been sifted by accumulation of personol\nexperiments, make it more available for the purpose of producing-\ngeneral conviction.\nAs I said before, I do not mean to claim for myself or my colles.\",\"lles. -\neither any special aptitude for investigation, or any special claim to the-\ncredence of mankind, as compared with the members of private house-\nholds or circles of friends where the phenomena may in the first instance\u00b7\noccur. But in a matter so strange to ordinary experience I think we\u00b7\nmay say that it is only gradually that a man learns the complicated\nprecautions that have to be taken in order to exclude all conceivable\npossibility of illusion or deception. Certainly my own experience is\nthat I only learnt what had to be done in this way, and had to be.\nguarded against, in a graduol way, by repeated experiments.\nAI. regards the question of cridibility, the important point.\nDigitized by Google\n\f11.'2 Fi\"8t General Meeting. . [July 17~\n'to bear in mind is that every a.dditional witness who, as Do\nMorgan said, has a fair stock of credit to draw upon, is an iniporta.nt.\ngain. Though his credit alone- is not likely to suffice for the\ndemand that is made on it, hi!! dra.ft will help. For. we must not\nexpect any decisive effect in the direction at which we prima.rily aim,\n-on the common sense of mankind, from any single piece of evidence,\nhowever complete it has been made. Scientific incredulity has been so\nlong in growing, and has so many and so strong roots, that we shall\n\u00b7only kill it, if we are able to kill it at all as regards any of those\nquestions, by burying it alive under a heap of facts. We must keep\n\" pegging away,\" as Lincom said; we must accumulate fact upon fact,\n\u00b7and add experiment upon experiment, and, I should say, not wrangle\n-too much with incredulous outsiders about the conclusiveness of any\none, but trust to the mass of evidence for conviction. The highest\n\u00b7degree of demonstrative force that we can obtain out of any single\nrecord of investigation is, of course, limited by the trustworthiness of\nthe investigator. We have done all that w~ can when the critic has\nnothing left to allege except that the investigator is in the trick. But\nwhen he has nothing else left to allege he will allege that.\nWe shall, I hope, make a point of bringing no evidence before the\npublic untilwe have got it to this pitch of cogency. I think it is desirable\n'on various grounds, but one ground is, I think, this: It is due to the\nprivate families or private circles of friends whom wehope to persuade to\n.allow us to take part in their experiments, not to leave the subject or the\nmedium of the phenomena.--when we have convinced ourselves, by our\n'own methods, of the genuineness of the phenomena--to bear alone the\ninjurious suggestions' of any incredulous materialist who ma.y find it\nneedful to attack our experiments. We must drive the objector into\n-the position of 'being forced either to admit the phenomena. as\ninexplicable, at least by him, or to accuse the investigators either of\nilying or cheating or of a blindness or forgetfulness incompatible with\n:.any intellectual condition except absolute idiocy.\n, h,m glad to say that this result, in my opinion, has been satisfactorily\n:attained in the investigation of thought-reading. ~fessor Barrett\nwill now bring before you a report which I hope will be only the\nfirst of a long series of similar reports which may have reached\n.the same poiut of conclusiveness.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] Report of Oommitfu on Tholtf\/M-Reading. 13\nFIRST REPORT ON T~OUGHT-READING.\nBy W.

MyERS, M.A., Late-\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n[Read to tlte Society, July 17, 1882.]\nFor several years past the members of this Committee have been.\ngathering evidence on the obscure but important question of what may\nbe termed 8UperSmIJUOU8 peruption. Stray facts met with from time to\ntime in the course of our own\u00b7observations, or related to us by com-\npetent witnesses, led us to doubt the sufficiency of the popular\nphysiological explanations to account for all cases, and encouraged us to,\npersevere in an inquiry which may be stated in the form of the\nfollowing proposition :-\nIs there or is there not any existing or attainable evidence that can\nstand fair physiological criticism, to support a belief that a vivid\nimpression or a distinct idea in one mind can be communicated to.\nanother mind without the intervening help of the recognised organs of\nsensation' And if such evidence be found, is the impressioD, derived:\nfrom a rare or partially developed and hitherto unrecognised sensory\norgan, or has the mental percept been evoked directly without any\nantecedent sense-percept' The nature and the laws of this direct action\nof mind on mind would of course form a subject of prolonged subsequent.\ndiscussion and inquiry whenever the evidence in its favour had\naccumulated sufficiently. The object of the present report is to place 011\nrecord the first instalment of the evidence which we have up to this.\ntime collected in reference to this subject.\nThe presentstate of scientific opinion throughout the world is not only\u00b7\nhostile to any belief in the possibility of transmitting a single mental.\nconcept, except through the ordinary channels of sensation, but, generally\nspeaking, it is hostile even to any inquiry upon the matter. Every\nleading physiologist and psychologist down to the present time has.\nrelegated what, for want of a better term, has been called \"Thought-\nreading \" to the limbo of exploded fallacies.*Dr. W.

J. Romanes, and published in Nature for June\n23rd, 1881. The report indicates that one member of the committee,\n\u00b7Professor Ray Lankester, absolutely refused to countenance the idea of\nthought-reading, and objected to the other members-Professor Croon)\nRobertson, lIr. F. Galton, and Mr. Romanes-giving even a fair trial to\n\" so puerile a hypothesis.\" The trial was, however, made, and the result is\n\u00b7thus stated: \"From these experiments it is needless to say we did\u00b7 not\n-anticipate any results, but, with the exception of Professor lAmkester\u2022\n.we thought it worth wbile to make them, not only because Mr. Bishop\n:seemed to desire it, but also to satisfy the general public that we had\ngiven the hypothesis of 'thought-reading' as well as that of 'muscle\nreading' a fair trial.\"\nMr. Stuart Cumberland has obtained considerable notoriety by\n.-experiments somewhat similar to those of }Ir. Bishop, but his perfor-\nmances have no sort of relationship to our experiments, as he expressly\ndisclaims thought-reading and denies the possibility of obtaining any\nresults without contact. Mr. Bishop, on the other hand, professes to\n-()btain results without contact, but the experiments for which he makes\nthis claim are never obtained without the very closest proximity, nor\nwithout accompaniments of needless flurry and excited pantomime\n. which are eminently calculated to distract and mislead tho attention.t\n* \"Mesmerism, Spiritualism,\" .\\':c., by Dr. W.

Stuart Cumberland's,perfonnanQes are in some\nftBpects identical with those exhibited, some years past, by a Mr. Corey\n.and others, in America.. In a paper read before a scientific body in\nDetroit, and published in the Detroit Review of Medicine for August,\n1875, Dr. T. A. M;cGra.w describes as follows the method followed by\nMr. Corey in his experiments: \"Bringing himself,\" sayli Dr. McGra.w,\u00b7\n.\" into direct physical 'lOntact with some person, Mr. Corey was enabled\n1;0 discover objects which that person had secreted, and to select from a\nmultitude of objects the one upon which the willer was intent. All his\nJlCrformances were but variations upon these two strings. A hidden\n~Bject was found, or a person, letter, or figure was picked out from a\ne\"Owd of others. He usually brought himself into contact with his\n~ubject by grasping the subject's hand, and applying it to his oW\u00bb.\n-forehead, but sometimes placed his own hand also on the brow of\nhis companion.\" The w:ri,ter proceeds to shew that Mr. Corey's tests\n(like most ofthose of Mr. Bishop and ~Ir. Cumberland) are only ideas\nwhich can be expressed by the simplest kind of m:ticm. \"He cannot.\ndetect any kind of an idea in such a way as to express it first by speech.\nThus he cannot tell directly the date of a coin, nor can he discover it in\n:any other manner than by choosing out the figures which represent it\nfrom among others on a, table.\" It is obvious, as the writer goes on to\nsay, that most of the actions \"could be explained by the perception\nby a trained operator of involuntary and unconscious muscular\nmovements.\"\n\"I myself,\" he continues, \"experienced this tendency to involuntary\naction, when trying to carry out fairly one of Mr. Corey's tests. The\n, object of the search in this case was the date of an old coin, and the\noperator was trying to discover it by choosing from among the figures\non the table those of the proper date. While keeping my attention\nfixed on a certain figure, I became a.ll at once aware that I was actually\ntrying to force the hand of my associate towards it, so powerfully did\nthe thought impel to the correspondent action.\"*\nNotwithstanding this, Dr. McGraw does not believe the explanation\nhe has just given covers all the phenomena he witnessed, for he adds:\n\"It seemed to me that there were features in these exhibitions which\neould not be satisfactorily explained on the hypothesis of involuntary\nmuscular action, for \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 . we are required to believe a man\noould unwillingly, and in spite of himself, give infonnation by uncon-\nscious and involuntary signs that he could not give under the same\ncircumstances by voluntary and conscious action. . . . .

Whenever the hands are in contact or even communicate by a\ntense cord with the subject of the experiment, it is almost impossible to\n.exclude giving faint indications to the guesser, which with a sensItive\nsubject are interpreted into a sense of rightness or wrongness that\nultimately may lead them to the hidden object,. \"the communication,\"\nas .Dr. Carpenter remarks, \"being made by unconscious muscular\naction on the part of one person and automatically interpreted by the\nother.\" The most familiar illustration of this is to be found in the\n1J.villing game, which may be described in Dr. Carpenter's words, as\nfollows: \"Several persons being assembled, one of them leaves ,the\nroom, and during his absence some object is hidden. On the absentee's\nre-entrance, two persons who know the hiding-place stand, one on either\nside of him, and establish some personal contact with him, one method\nbeing to place one finger on the shoulder, while another is for each to\nplace a hand on his body. He walks about the room between the two\n'willers,' and ge~era1ly succeeds before long in finding the hidden object,\nbeing led towards it,.as careful observation and experiment have fully\nproved, by the involuntary muscular action of his unconscious guides,\none or the other of them pressing more'heavily when. the object is on\nhis side, and the finder as involuntarily turning towards that side.\" ..\nThis well-known explanation doubtless accounts for very much that\nis witnessed in family circles, and which goes under the name of\nthought-reading. At the same time there is a difficulty in applying it\nto those cases wherein the subject has frequently failed to accomplish a\nsimple task, and yet has accurately done a much more complicated one\noften with singular promptness and decision. Some striking cases of\nthis kind will be found detailed in the Appendix to this report, but,\nthough surprising, they are not in themselves of sufficient value to\nwarrant an explanation by any new hypothesis. We therefore pass on\nto the second group of cases :-\nII.

We might abundantly illustrate\nthis type of cases from the mass of correspondence we have received\nand from what we have ourselves witnessed. Some cases are referred\nto in the Appendix. Even blindfolding the subject merely removes one\nrisk of error. The doubtful interpretation of the best results obtained in\nthis group has compelled us to attach comparatively little importance to\nthem, and accordingly we pass on to the next group :-\nIII. Wlte1'e some number, word, or card Itas been guessed apparently\n'Witltout any ojtILe O'l\"dina'MJ means of commttnicatio;~ between tI,e willer\nand {fltesser.\nThough the errors arising from muscle-reading or involuntary\nguidance are here avoided, there arc other sources of conscious or\n\"Unconscious illusion to be gua.rc:led against. Collusion is one of the most\n'Obvious, and anyone who has witnessed wllat can be clone by a code of\n'Signals such as is employed by Mr. BisllOP,IF or l\\Ir. Heller, br Mr.\nHeriot with \"Louie,\" will naturally distrust all observations where two\nparticular persons are necessary for the results obtained. Imperceptible\ninformation may be given by one who knows the word selected, by means\n'Of the Morse code used in electric telegraphy, the long and short signs\n'being readily communicated by sight, SOllna, or touc11, as may be found\nTCquisite. And where collusion is out of the question an obvious\ndanger lies in low whispering, or even soundll'ss movement of the lips;\nwhilst the faintest accent of approval or disapproval in question or\ncomment may give a hint as to whether the effort is tending in the\nright direction, and thus guide to the mark by successive approximations.\nAny exhibition of the kind before a promiscuous company is nearly sure\nto be vitiated by one or other of these sources of error. It is obvious,\nin fact, that precision can only be attained by repeated experimentation\nin a limited circle of persons known to each other, and amenable to\nscientific control.\n. In the correspondence we have received there were two cases which\n'lIecmed, upon illquiry, to be free from any JJrimdj(fcie objections, and\n1.I.pparently illdicative of true thought-reading. One of these cases is\n1dven in the Appelldix, p. 55, but as we cannot from personal observation\ntestify to the conditions under which the trials were made, we simply\nleave it aside. The other case was that of a family in Derbyshire, with\nwhom we have had the opportullity of frequent and prolonged trials.t\n* For Mr. Bishop also shews how anything can be intimated to a con-\nfederate by a code of questions and sounds.\nt A preliminary note on this case was sent to Natul'o, and published in that\njournal for July 7th, 1881.\ne 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f20 1.leP01't of OOI!zmittee on TlwugM.Beading. [July 17,.\nOur informimt was Mr. Oreery, a clergyman of unblemished'\ncharacter, and whose iIitegrity indeed has, it so happens, been excep-\ntionally tested. He has a family of five girls, ranging no,,-\nbetween the ages of ten and seventeen, all thoroughly healthy, os\nfree as possible from morbid or hysterical symptoms, and hi manner-\nperfectly simple and chilcllike. The father stated that anyone of theso\nchildren (except the youngest), as well as a young servant-girl who had\nlived' with the family for two years, was frequently able to designate\n,correctly, without contact or sign, a card or other object fixed on in the\nchild's absence. During the year which has elapsed since we first heard\nof this family, seven visits, mostly of several days' duration, have been\npaid to the town where they live, by ourselves and several scientifie\nfriends, and on these occasions daily experiments have been made.\nThe inquiry has taken place partly in Mr. Creery's house, and ---\npartly in lodgings or in a private room of an hotel, occupied by some of\nour number. Having selected at random one child, whom we desired\nto leave the room and wait at some distance, we would choose a card\nfrom a pack, or write on paper a number or a name which occurred to.\nus at the moment. Generally, but not always, this was shewn to the\nmembers of the family present in the room; but no one member was \u2022\nalways present, and we were sometimes entirely alone. We then\n~ecalled the child, one of us always assuring himself that, when the\ndoor was suddenly opened, she was at a considerable distance,(in their own\nhouse at the further end of a passage), though this was usually a super-\nfluity of caution, as our habit was to avoid all utterance of what was\nchosen. Before leaving the room the child had been informed of the\ngeneral nature of the test we intended to select, as \"this will be a, card.\" \"\nor \"this will be a name.\" On re-entering she stood-sometimes turned ' ~...\nby us with her face to the wall, oftener with her eyes directed towards ,'.\nthe ground, and usually close to us and remote from her family-for a. :\nperiod of silence varying from a few seconds to a minute, till she called \u2022.\nout to us some number, card, or whatever it might be. If this WII.P\nincorrect, we usually allowed a second trial, and occasionally a third. '\nTo give an example: The following results were obtained on\nthe evening of April 12th, in the presence of two of our number and\nthe family. The first attempt of one of the children was to state\n(without searching) the hiding-place of some small object, the place\nh!l.ving been chosen by ourselves, with the full range of the house.\nand then communicated to the other members.of the family. This\nwas effected in one case only out of four. The next attempt was\nto give the name of some familiar object agreed on in the child's\nahsence, as \"sponge,\" '\" pepper-castor,\" &c. This was successful on a.\nfirst trial in six cases out of fourteen. We then chose a cart! from\na full pack in the child's absence, and called upon her to name it\nDigitized by Google\n\f~882.] Repol\u00b7t of Oommittee on Tllotegllt-Readillg. 21\n'On her return. This was successful at once in six cases out of\nthirteen. We then tried holding small objects in the hand, as 0.\n\"latch-key,\" a \"half-sovereign,\" a \"green ball \"-which were at once\nrightly named in five cases out of six. A 11o.rder trial wo.s now\nintroduced. The maid-servant having left the room, one of us\n'WrOte down the name \"Michael Davitt,\" shewed it round, and then\nput the paper in his pocket. The door was now opened and the girl\nrecalled from the end of the passage. She stood close to the door\n'IIomid absolute silence, and with her eyes on the ground-all of Ufl\nmeanwhile fixing our attention on the appointed name-and gave\n.after a few seconds the name \"Michael;\" and then almost immediately\n\"Davitt.\" To avoid any association of ideas, we then chose\nimaginary names, made up by ourselves at the moment, as\" Samuel\nMorris,\" \"John Thomas Parker,\" \"Phrebe Wilson.\" The names were\n.given correctly in toto at the first trial in five cases out of ten.\n'Three cases were complete failures, and in two the names given\nbQre a strong resemblance to those selected by us, \"Jacob Williams\"\n\"being given as \"Jacob Wild,\" and \"Emily Walker\" as \"'Enry Walker.\"\nIt was now getting late, and both we and the younger children\n\u2022 \"Were very tired; and four attempts to guess the name of a town in\nEngland were all failures, though one of us had previously obtained\nnmarkable success with this very experiment.\nThe results obtained when the family were present gain enormously\n\"in value if similar results can be shewn when none but strangers to the\n!runily know the word or card selected, 01' when the child who is the\n\\ 'subject of the experiment is completely isolated from those who know\n-the thing chosen. We will therefore describe two sedes of experiments\n..~ of this character, which appear to us to be absolutely unexceptionable\n.and conclusive, so far as they go.\n\"Easter, 1881. Present: Mr. and Mrs. Creery and family, and\nW. F. Barrett, the narrator. One of the children was sent into an\n.adjoining room, the door of which I saw was closed. On returning to\nthe sitting-room and closing its door also, I thought of some object in the\n'house, fixed upon at random; writing the name down, I shewed it\nto the family present, the stdctest silence being preserved throughout.\nWe then all silently thought of the name of the thing selected. In a'\nfew seconds the door of the adjoining room wo.s heard to open,\n\u00b7and 'after a very short interval the child would enter the\n:sitting-room, generally speaking with the object selected. Noone\nwas allowed to leave the sitting-room after the object had been fixed\nupon; no communication with the child was conceivable o.s her place\nwas often changed. Further, the only instructions given to tile child\nwere to fetch some object in the house that I woulcl fix upon, and,\ntogether with the family, silently keep in mind to the exclusion, as far\nDigitized by Google\n\fReport of Oommlttee on TlloufJkt\u00b7Reading.\u00b7 [July 17,.\nas possible, of all other ideas. In this way I wrote down, among othel'\"\nthings, a ltair-brualt; it was brought: an orange; it was brought: a\nwine glass; it W9.':I brought: an apple; it was brought: a toasting-fork ,-\nfailed on the first attempt, a pair of tongs being brought, but on\na second trial it was brought. With another child (among other trials\nnot here mentioned) a cnp was written down by me; it was brought ::\na saucer; this was a failure, a plate being brought; no second trial\nallowed. The child being told it was a saucer, replied, 'That came\ninto my head, but I hesitated as I thought it unlikely you would name\nsaucer after cup as being too easy.' \"\nThis last trial, some would think, shews pure guesswork, and'\ninvalidates the other results; but we prefer to let it stand, as, taken in\n,conjunction with our experience obtained in other ways, it indicates-.\none source of failure, namely, that in delicate experiments of the kind'\nhere recorded (assuming them to be cases of thought transmission) the-\nslightest effort of reason, or of will, on the part of the subject is\nsufficient to vitiate the suecess of the experiment. No doubt the chief\"\nsource of failure is to be found in the difficulty of suppressing the more\nvivid impressions made on the mind by the ordinary channels of\"\nsensat.ion. We may compare this to the action of a die in stam,.ping ;\nlight pressure of the die will yield 0. delicate and faithful impl1lSsion, or\na blurred and imperfect one, or none at all, according to the nature of\n.the material that is stamped, or the prior existence of any deeply cut\nimpression.\nThe second series of experiments, which we venture to think are\nunexceptionable, were made by Mr. Myers and Mr. Gurney, together-\nwith two ladies who were entire strangers to the family. None of the\nfamily knew what we had selected, the type of thing being told only to\u00b7\nthe child chosen to guess. The experimenters took every precaution\nin order that no indication, however slight, should reach the child. She\u00b7\nwas recalled by one of the experimenters and stood near the door with\ndowncast eyes. IIi this way the following results were obtained.

Special precautions were\ntaken to avoid such errors of experiment as are described by Dr. Beard,\nand the results shew that in the case of cards, out of fottrteen successive\ntrials nine were guessed rightly the first time, and only three trials can be\nsaid to have been complete failures. On none of these occasions was it\neven remotely possible for the child to obtain by any ordinary means a\nknowledge of the card selected. Our own facial expression was the\nonly index open to her; and even if we had not purposely looked as\nneutral as possible, it is difficult to imagine how we could have\nunconsciously carried, say, the two of diamonds written on OUI\u00b7\nforeheads.\nNow, if\u00b7 we apply to these two sets of experiments the souret'.s of\nerror enumerated by Dr. Beard, the conclusion, we venture to think, is\ninevitable that we lui.ve here very strong evidence in favour of a class\nof phenomena entirely new to science.

Collnsion by a third party is avoided by the fact that none were\na!lowed to enter or leave the room after we had selected the thing to be\nguessed, and in the second series of experiments by the exclusion of\nall members of the family, either from the room, or from participation\nin the requisite knowledge\"'; whilst chance and coincidence we havo\nalready dealt with. In many trials, such as the guessing ~f fictitious\nnames, made up by us on the spur of the moment, the chances against\nsuccess were, of course, incalculable; yet, as will be seen by the\nfollowing record taken from our last day's experimenting, these names\nwere guessed with as much ease as cards, where the chances against\nsuccess were far less.\nIn the following experiments the thing selected was known to the\nfamily, who, however, never left their places after we had written down\n. the word and silently handed it round, or drawn a card, exposed it, and\nthen replaced it in absolute silence.

In the case of letters of the alphabet, of cards, and of numbers\nof two figures, the chances against success on a first trial would\nnaturally be 25 to 1, 51 to 1, and 89 to 1, respectively; in the case\nof surnames they would of course be indefinitely greater. Oards wer&\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] Beport of Oommittee on Tllought-Beading.\nfar most frequently employed, and the odds in their case may be\ntaken as a fair medium sample; according to which, out of the whole\nseries of ,382 trials, the average number of successes at the first attempt:\nby an ordinary guesser would be 71. Of our trials 127 were successes\non the first attempt, 56 on the second, 19 on the third, making 202 in.\nall. On most of the occasions of failure, 180 in number, second trials\nwere made; but in some cases the guesser professed inability, and\ndeclined to make more than one, and in others we' allowed three; no-\ntrial beyond the third was ever allowed. During the last day or two\nof trial, after it had occurred to us to notice the point, we found that\nof the failures to guess a card at the first trial, those wrong both in\nsuit and number were a small minority.\nOur most striking piece of success, when the thing solected was.\ndivulged to none of the family, was five cards running named correctly-\non a first trial ; the odds against this happening once in our sories were,\nconsiderably over a nillion to 1. We had altogether a good many-\n~milar batches, the two longest runs being 8 consecutive successes,\nonce with cards and once with names; where the adverse odds in the-\nformer case were over 142 millions to 1, and in the latter something\nincalculably greater. If we add to these results others obtained on:..\nprevious visits, it seems not too much to say that the hypothesis of:\nmere coincidence is pmctically excluded.\nWe are aware that the exceptional nature of this inquiry goes far t~.\ninvalidate arguments founded on character and demeanour; and on.\ntbis head, therefore, will only state our conviction that any candid critic,\npresent during the whole course of the experiments, would have carried\naway a far more vivid impression of their genuineneSl! than the bare\u00b7\nprinted record can possibly convey. Of more real importance is the\nhypothesis of exalted sensibility of the ordinary sense organs. We-\ncould discover no indication of this in any of its known forms; but bY.\nway ot prellaution, as has been already stated, we commonly avoided\neven whispering any word, number, or name that we had selected; and\nthe position of the excluded child, when the door was opened, would in\nevery case have satisfied the most exacting critic. The explanation\nwhich might be Bought in unconscious indications given by the sitters,\nand especially in thc movement of the lips, has been already adverted to.\nComing as we did to this investigation with considerable previous..\nexperience of the same kind, we were throughout strictly on our guard\nagainst giving such indications ourselves; the possibility of their-\nbeing given by the family was of course excluded where the family\u00b7\nwere ignorant of the selected word or thing; and on th~ remaining\noccasions our perpetual vigilant watch never detected a trace of any-\nthing of the kind. The absolute docility of the children-both tho-\nsuesser and the others-in taking any position in the room that we-\nDigitized by Google\n\f'28 Report of Oommit~ee on Tkought-Reading. [July 17,\nindicated, was naturally an assistance to our precautions. It may be\nfurther mentioned that, on a previous visit made by one of us, the\n'child called the required name through the shut door or from an\nadjoining room, having thus been completely isolated from the very\n.beginning to the very end of the experiment.\nIt must be remembered that our great pre-occupation throughout\n'Was to guard a.ga.i.nst delusion. Had' the phenomena been sufficiently\n~stablished to allow of a systematic search for their underlying laws,\nwe might have preferred a more unvarying method of experimentation;\nbut in this preliminary stage it seemed desirable to meet pri'flU1,facie\npossibilities of ~eception by frequent and unexpected changes of the\nvarious conditions. At the same time we endeavoured to gather such\nindications as we could of the way in which the impression flashed on\nthe mind of the child.\nThe first question concerns the respective parts in the phenomena\nplayed by mental e1Je and mental ear. Among the experiments which\nwe have counted asfailwres were very many where the number or card\nselected was guessed, as it were, piecemeal For instance, the number\n35 was selected, and the guesses were 45 and 43. So 57 was attempted\nas 47 and 45. So with cards: the seven of diamonds being chosen the\nguesses were six of diamonds and seven of hearts; the three of spades\nbeing chosen, the guesses were queen of spades and three of diamonds.\nThese cases seem somewhat in favour of mental eye, the similarity\nin BOund between three and thirty in 43 and 35, or between five and\n, fifty in 45 and 57, not being extremely strong; while the pict'l1\/l'e of the\n3 or the 5 is identical in either pair. A strongerargument on the same\nside is the frequent guessing of king for knave, and vice versd. On\n\u00b7the other hand, names of approximate sound (also reckoned as failures)\n'Were often given instead of the true ones; as \" Chester\" for Leicester.\n.\" Biggis\" for Billings. Frogmore was guessed first as \"Freemore\";\n;Snelgrove was given as \"Singrore,\" the last part of the name was soon\n.given as \"Grover,\" and the attempt was then abandoned; the child\nremarking afterwards that she thought of \" Snail\" as the first syllable,\nbut it had seemed to her too ridiculous. One of us has, moreover,\n:.successfully obtained from the maid-servant a German word of which\n.she could havo formed nO visual image.

The importance of \"a childly\nway with children,\" and the slightness of ,the differences of Dianner-\nwhich will either paralyse them into stupidity or evoke unexpected.\nintelligence and power, are commonplaces to anyone whose duties have-\nlain among them; and attention to such points may be as prime a factor-\nof success in these delicate experiments as any other.\nThe delicacy of the conditions was illustrated in our own inquiry'\npartly by the -inexplicable fluctuations of success and failure affecting;\nthe whole household, partly by the wide difference observed in the\ncapacities of particular members of it from day to day. The common\nnotion that simplicity, and even comparative -blankness of mind, are\nimportant conditions, seems somewhat doubtfully borne out by our-\nexperience; but of the favourable effect of freedom from constraint, and-\nof a spice of pleasurable excitement, we can speak with entire assurance..\nThe particular iIi-success of a sitting which we held one close afternoon\nwas attributed by the children themselves-and it seemed to us correctly-\n-to inertness after their early dinner.\nWe could find no resemblances between these phenomena and those-\nknown as mesmeric; inasmuch as a perfectly normal state on the part of\nthe subject seemed our first pre-requisite.

It is CUriOUB in the case of Lady G. and her sister, that\nboth impreBBions were made in the night, when the atteniion was not\ndiverted by Burrounding Bights or Bounds.\nThis may have had Bome connection with the following incident which\nhappened to myself lately. There iB a house about half-a-mile from my own~\ninhabited by Bome ladieB, friends of our family. They have a large alarm\nbell outside their house. One night I awoke Buddenly and said to my wife,\n\" I am Bure I hear Mrs. F.'B alarm bell ringing.\" After listening for Bome-\ntime we heard nothing, and I went to sleep again. The next day Mrs. F.\ncalled upon my wife, and said to her, \"We were wishing for your hUBband\nlast night, for we were alarmed by thieveB. We were all up, and I was\nabout to pull the alarm bell, hoping he would hear it, saying to mydaughters,\nI am Bure it will soon bring your hUBband, but we did not ring it.\" My wife-\nasked what time it was; Mrs. F. said it was about half-past one.

This subject we propose to deal with later, as it is beyond\nthe scope of the present report.\nIt is obvious that any conclusions worth recording must rest upon a.\nlarge induction of cases that cannot be obtained at will. We are.\ntherefore, in a large measure dependent upon the testimony of\ncorrespondents, and would invite further information, which may be\nsent to any of us,* or to the secretary of the Society for\ntr&llSIDission to us. .\nWe cannot pretend that this inquiry is as yet more than in its\ninfancy, and we would deprecate the premature formation of theories\non the subject. The phenomena here described are so unlike any\nwhich have been brought within the sphere of recognised science. as\nto subject the mind to two opposite dangers. Wild hypotheses as\nto how they happen are confronted. with equally wild assertions that\nthey cannot happen at all. Of the two, the assumption of d priori\nimpossibility is, perhaps,' in the present state of our knowledge of\nNature, the most to be deprecated; though it cannot be considered in\nany way surprising.\nAt the same time it may serve to disarm purely d priori criticism\nif we point out that the word \"thought-reading\" is merely used as a.\npopular and provisional description, and is in no way intended to .\nexclude an explanation resting on a physical basis. It is quite open to\nsurmise some sort of analogy' to the familiar phenomena of the\ntransmission and reception of vibratory energy.

As one who has been engaged more in physical\n.science than in anything else, I may perhaps be allowed to give an\nillustration from physical science that has reference to the best method\n'Of obtaining evidence of infrequent phenomena:\nIt so happens that there is in science a phenomenon that has been\nfrequentiy observed by trustworthy observers, but that until very recently\nhas hardly been accepted at all as anything that could possibly have\noccurred. I allude to the ease of globular lightning. It was said in\n'Objection to all the evidence with reference to globular lightning, that\nis to say, a thunder-bolt travelling at a slow rate, and afterwards\nexploding and giving rise to lightnings of the ordinary kind, that\nwhat occurs is an electric discharge, and that all electric discharges\nmust necessarily take place in a moment of time inapprecial)ly\n~l Of late years, however, some physicists have suggested\nthat this globular lightning, instead of being an ordinary electric\ndischarge, is really a sort of travelling Leyden jar, and I believe\n'One foreign observer has shewn in some experiments that something\nanalogous to that on a small scale may be artificially produced.\nI think I am entitled to say that a change of tone has consequently\ntaken place amongst physicists with regard to the evidence for globular\nlightning. The evidence of course remains as before. A little additional\nevidence accumulates now and then, but the great bulk remains as it\nwas. The fact that we are able to explain this phenomenon without over-\nthrowing entirely our received Views on electricity, has certainly enabled\npeople to accept evidence:that they would not have accepted before.\nThus we see that the reason why this evidence was not accepted before\nwas because the hypothesis with regard to electric discharges was\ninsufficient. We imagined that there could not be anything but an\nordinary electric discharge: we did not imagine the possibility of what\nmay be called a travelling Leyden jar. .\nNow there is no question, I think, thatthe ordi~ary way in which we\nhave communications from one human being to another, is by means of\n~\nDigitized by Google\n\f36, Prof. Balfour Stewllrt. [July 17~\nwhat may be called the five senses. Noon&, of course, disputes that; but\nI do not know that this fact, any more than any other scientific fact, or\nany scientific law, should be taken as absolutely final and complete.\nScientific experience has always shewn thatwego from one generalisation\nto another. First of all we bind together a number of facts by what may be\ncalled a working hypothesis, which we may call a generalisation of the first\norder. Afterwards we find that there are sli~ht departures from this\nworking hypothesis, and then we ~re led to reHect on these departures,\nand are ultimately led to a higher law. Now if we were to treat this first\ngeneralisation or working hypothesis as something absolutely final, we\nshould be able to gain no more information upon the subject. Surely it\nwould not be the right way for anyonewho has come to a first generalisa-\ntion to set his face against all extensiollS of it, neither making extensions.\nhimself nol' trusting to the evidence of any others who may profess to\nhave done so.\nBut this is exactly the position taken up by certain physiologists\nwith regard to the possibility of thought-reading. It has been\nrecognised throughout the world,-and all of us who are here.\nrecognise it as completely as any,-that the five senses are the ordinary\nand established means by which communicatiollS are made; but\nthat physiologists should regard this as an absolutely final and complete\nstatement is decidedly against all scientific analogy, and that they should\ndecline, as some have done, to see experiments themselves or refuse credit\nto those who have done so, is to pursue a very objectionable method. I\nquite think that the mode in which our Chairman has put it is the best\npossible mode. We have, as he said, to bring evidence in such a way\nbefore the public that they must either believe the phenomena or be-\ncompelled to say, \"'Ve do not trust those who brought them forward ; ,~\nand I think that in this respect the report that has been read by\nProfessor Barrett, and the observations made by him and Mr. l\\lyers.\nand Mr. Gurney, have certainly succeeded wonderfully well The only\npossible way of disputing the evidence is by hinting at the untrust-\nworthiness of those gentlemen who have given it, and cOllSequently I\nthink their efforts must be regarded as successful\nProfessor Barrett, Mr. Gurney, and Mr. Myers have, as I\nhave said, put things in such a way that if they are to be-\ndenied you must dispute the trustworthiness of those gentlemen..\nProfessQr Hopkinson and myself have not perhaps obtained equally\nconclusive results; we had not the same time to devote to the inquiry.\nWe, however, obtained results which neither of us was able to account\nfor by any received hypothesis.\nOur experiments were made in the same house and with the\nsame host, and they are valuable, I think, at any rate, in confirming\nthe conclusiollS arrived at by those gentlemen from their experiments.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] Note on Tkougld-Reading. 3'7\nIf they are to be disputed on account of untrustworthiness, it is\nclear that the charge of untrustworthiness must be extended so as\neither to embraee Professor Hopkinson and myself, or the gentleman\nwho was kind enough to give us the opportunity of seeing the e~peri\u00ad\nments performed-perhaps to include us all-but I eo not think: that\n.any of us will mind that very much.\nI should like to say a word with regard to the last series of phenomena\n-or the extension of thought-reading at a distance, which Professor\n\"Barrett brought before the meeting; I have devoted a great deal of\nattention to reading evidence on this particular point, and I certainly\nthink that if we can rely upon evidence at all we have hero a very strong\n\"body of evidence for some kind of action at-a distance, particularly for\nthe appearance of one individual to another at a distant\u00b7 place at the\ntime of death. The reason for my bringing up this case is that while\nthere is very strong evidence for something of the kind, I have been\nmuch surprised that it has not been put upon such a footing as would\ncertainly commend itself to all men of science fro~ without. Of course,\n\"jt is a matter of delicacy for an individual who has received a\ncommunication of this kind to make it public, but it would be a great\n\"boon and an addition to our knowledge if he would do so either by an\nordiriary letter to a newspaper or by giving the communication in some\nkind of cypher. In such a case if, before the intelligence of the death\ncan have arrived, a communication of this kind is published, either\n.openly or in cypher, there will be' unimpeachable evidence of a\ncharacter to satisfy any candid inquirer, that something peculiar has\ntaken place. In science, as in law, the evidence ought always to be the\n-very best that can be brought into co.rt.\nWe must bear in mind that coincidence will not certainly\n'explain a thing of that kind. Suppose, for instance, that an appearance\npresented itself to an individual at a distance, and that death happened\nwithin ten minutes of this appearanoo. First of all, such an appearance\n'is uncommon; then the probability of any person'dying in a particular\nten minutes is very small; and when the two things happen together you\n\"have to multiply the one probability by the other, and you will find\nthat the probability of the united event is something which is\ninappreciably small, and consequently, if a thing of that kind happens,\nit cannot be accounted for by any such hypothesis as coincidence.\nThe few experiments which I took part in performing were performed\n:nt Buxton, at the house of a clergyman, who, I am glad to see, is present\nwith us to-day. We paid two visits to his house In the first\ninstance, the thought-reader was outside a door. The object or thing\nthought of was written on paper and silently handed round to the\ncompany in the room. The thought-reader was then called in, and in\n'the course, perhaps, of a minute, the answer was given. Definitl'\nDigitized by Google\n\f38 Prof. Balfour Stewart.

Then numbers weJ;'&\nthought of, and the answers were genero.1ly right; but, of course, there\nwere some cases of error. Then names of towns were thought of, and a..\ngood many of these were right. Then fancy names were thought of.\nWhen my colleague, Professor Hopkinson, had gone away, I was asked:\nto think of certain fancy names, and mark them down and hand them\nround to the company.

The percentage of\"\nsuccess was about as large as in the first instance. In one case, whilo-\nthe thought-reader 9'em.ained behind the door, a card was chosen.

CREERY, B.A.\n[Read to the Society, July 17, 1882.]\nIn the month of October, 1880, my a~tion was called to the-\nphenomena of the \"willing game,\" but being unable to determine how\nmuch of the results was due to simple willing, and how much to\n- involuntary pushing, I resolved to thoroughly investigate the whole\u00b7\nquestion of the action of mind on mind. For this purpose I employed.\nfour of my children between the ages of ten and sixteen, all being in\nperfectly robust health, and a' maid-servant, about twenty years of age.\nEach went out of the room in turn, while I and the others fixed on.\nlOme object which the absent one was to name on returning to the\nroom. After a few trials the successes preponderated so much\nover the failures that we were all convinced there was something-\nvery wonderful coming under our notice. Night after night,\nfor several months, we spent an hour or two each evening\nin varying the conditions of the experiments, and choosing new\nsubjects for thought-transference. We began by selecting the simplest.\nobjects in the room; then chose names of towns, names of people, dates,\ncards out of a pack, lines from different poems, &0., in fact any things or-\nseries of ideas that those present could keep steadily before their minds ;;\nand whenthe children were in good humour, and excited bythe wonderful\nnature of their successful guessing, they very seldom made a mistake. I\n\"ve seen seventeen cards, chosen by myself, named right in succession\"\nwithout any mistake. We soon found that a great deal depended on\nthe steadiness with which the ideas were kept before the minds of \"the\u00b7\nthinkers,\" and upon the energy with which they willed the ideas to\npass. Our worst experiments before strangers have invariably been.\nwhen the company was dull and undemonstrative; and we are all con-\nvinced that when mistakl,lS are made the fault rests, for the most part,\nwith the thinkers, rather than with the thought-readers.\nI may 811.y that this faculty is not by any means confined to memoers.\nof one family; it is much more general than we imagine. To verify\nthis conclusion I invited two of a neighbour'S children to join us in our\u00b7\neXperiments. On the first evening they were rather diffident, and did'\nnot succeed; on the second they improved, and on the third evening,\nthey Were still better. Circumstances prevented them being able to.\nDigitized by Google\n\f44 . ,Rev. A. M. Creery. [July 17,\ncontinue their visits to us, but I saw enough to make me feel perfectly\nsure that had they persevered they would have been quite equal to our\nown circle in the faculty of\" thought-reading.\nThose who may be desirous of ascertaining the truth of the matter,\ncan do so in their own families; and since it in no way interferes with\nthe health of those engaged, it will be found a very interesting way of\npassing an hour on a winter's evening.\nThe distance between the thinkers and the thought-reader is of\nconsiderable consequence. As a rule the best results take pl8.(,'e when\nthis distance is not more than\u00b7a yard or two; but under very favourable\nmental conditions we have often had four and five cards named right\nin succession, while the thought-reader was placed in a room on the\n:landing above that in which the thinkers were assembled.\nOn questioning the children as to the mode by which they form their -\n.judgment of the ideas that come before their minds, I find them all\nagreed in this: two or three ideas of objects of the class with which we\n\u00b7are experimenting come before their minds, and after a few moments'\n-reflection they select that which stands out with the greatest vividness.\nAt present we are not in a position to theorise very far on this subject,\n'still we cannot help asking ourselves this question: How are the motions\nof the brains of the thinkers communicated to the brain of the thought-\nreader ~ Is there any such thing as direct action between mind and\nmind 7 or are \"brain-waves\" set up in some intervening medium, either\n'in the luminiferous ether, or in a nerve atmosphere developed at the\ntime in the cerebra of the thinkers, by which the corresponding idea is\ncalled up in the mind of the thought-reader 1 These are questions\nwhich, at present, we cannot definitely answer; but I am under tho\nimpression that the medium of communication is something more subtle\nthan the vehicle that conveys heat and light.\nWhen we began to investigate these curious phenomena we had ne\nidea that the result of our little amusement would ever come before the\npublic. But having been asked to deliver a lecture on some popular\nsubject before a small philosophical society in Derby, I volunteered to\n..give an account of the experiments in \"Thought-readin~\" with which\n! was then engaged. A short report, which appeared in the local\n\"papers, I forwarded to Professor Barrett, who I knew was interested in\nsuch matters. He at once took it up, and paid us his first visit at\nEaster, 1881, the results of which he afterwards published in Nature;\n;and should conclusions of any psychological value be ever deduced\nfrom the experiments that I commenced it will be mainly to him that\n'Science will be indebted.\nP.S.-The last evening Professor Stewart was with us I asked a\nmedical man in Buxton (Mr. Turner) to join us in our experim!3nts.\nProfeGsor Stewart was obliged to leave early, but Mr. Turner, in my\nigitized byGoogl\n\f1882.J Note on ,TllOu{JId~Re((dinfJ.\nabsence with Professor Stewart, continued the experiments, a record of\nwhich he has sent me, and is here subjoined.\n\"With a friend who appends his signature to these notes, which are\ncopied from those taken on the moment, I visited the Rev.

BARRETT F.R.S.E., KR.LA., &c., Professor of Physics in\ntJIe Boya1 College of.Science for Ireland.\nIt has been urged by those whose opinion is entitled to the highest\n-respect, that this inquiry, ifundertaken at all, shouldhave beenleft in the\nhands of physiologists, or physicians, who, having a wider knowledge of\n.the numerous forms which hysteria assumes, would be more keenly alive\nto certain sources of error, such as deceit, which might escape an ordinary\nobserver. This is quite possible; though I venture to think that the\nexperience gained by several years' persistent, though unpublislled\niuvestigation of obscure mental phenomena occurring in all sorts and,\n-conditions of people, is not without its value. Only by wide and\nsearching inquiry of this kind can any conception be formed of the\npitfalls which beset the inquirer, arising mainly either from unconscious,\ninvoluIitary actions, or from the extraordinary capacity there is in\nhuman nature for deception; often seemingly innocent, at other times\nresorted to for the sake of gaining notoriety. I confess I do not know\nho,v our vigilance would be increased, or our results become\n.more trustworthy, by ability to diagnose any particular case, when\n~xperience has taught us to exercise habitual caution in all cases. The\ninquiry must ultimately resolve itself into a. question of evidence,\nand demands the exercise of the faculty of careful observation, which' a\nphysicist is as likely to possess as a physiologist.\nM:y own connection with the subject arose in this way. Some\n. fifteen years ago, whilst staying with a friend in the country, I saw\neertain mesmeric experiments ma\"e on the children of one of my\nfriend's tenants, which interested me grpatly, ill spite of my strong\nscepticism. Among other things, I noticed what appeared to be a\ntransmission of impressions from the mind of the mesmeriser to that of\nthe subject, without, so far as I could detect, allY intervening sense of\nperception. For example, the mesmerised subject being in 011e room\nand my friend in an adjoining one, and completely out of sight of the\naubject(even supposingthe sleep were feigned), I-placingmyself between\nthe two rooms-noticed that, every time a substance was silently tasted\nby my friend, a corresponding motion of tIle lips, expressive of enjoy-\nment or distaste, occurred in the mesmerised subject. In repeating these\nand other experiments on the same subject, I obtained what appeared\nDigitized by Google\n\f48 Prof. W. F. Barrett. [July 17,.\nto me indubitable evidence of a r~production in the subject's mind of\nany vivid sensation or idea that occurred in my own mind. I WQ.<;\n80 much impressed with these experiments, and others made at my\nown house subsequently, that I ventured. to bring the ;natter before\nthe British Association, at the meeting in Glasgow in 1876, in the\nhope that a committee of inquiry would be appointed. The\ndiscussion on this paper drifted, however, into other. cha.nnels~\nand in a letter published in the Times in September, 1876, I\nwrote as follows:- \u2022\n\"I am inclined to believe that other mental .phenome~su~,_ for\nexample, as the influence of one mind upon another 8.<.TOBB space, without\nthe intervention of the senses-demand a prior investigation. That\ncases of such mental action at a distance do really exist I, in common\nwith others, have some reason to believe : bdt before they can be generally -\naccepted, the evidence must accumulate and be thoroughly sifted. I hope\nthat some one more competent, and having more leisure than myself, will\nultimately take up this question; meanwhile, I shall be glad to receive\ncommunications from anyol1e who can furnish me with trustworthy evidence\non two points-of cases of the direct action of one mind upon another giving\nrise to an apparent transfusion of thought or feeling, occurring either in\nabnormal conditions produced by illneBS or 'mesmeric trance' ; 'or of cases\nwhere, under normal conditions, perception may seem to occur independent\nof the ordinary channels of sensation. I must beg those who kindly send\nme such cases to take great care lest sources of error be produced from\nunconscious muscular signs on the part of the observer, or from the keen\n\u2022 muscular sense' and the general exaltation of the other senses, which, in\nany morbid. condition,. are likely to exist on the part of the subject.\nWhether careful inquiry will prove that every case can be referred to already\nknown physiological laws or not, remains to be seen ; but many friends, to\nwhose opinion I attach much weight, agree with me in thinking that such an\ninquiry should be made.\"\nAs this letter was copied into other journals, and was followed by a.\nsimilar request made by me in the columns of the Atll\u00a3nteU11l and else-\nwhere, I received a very large number of replies. The examination,.\nsifting, and personal investigation of the best cases, has been a work of'\nconsiderable labour, and has occupied a good deal of my time for the.\nlast five years. .\nMany of the cases were readily explicable on the theory of muscle-\nreading, others were of more interest and led to correspondence and\npersonal interviews, in which I was joine d by Mr. F. W. H. Myers and\nafterwards by Mr. Edmund Gurney, both of whom had been pursuing.\nin connection with our President, kindred inquiries for some time\npast. The later results of our investigation are contained in the\nforegoing report, but it may be useful to put on record some of our\nearlier experiences as affording typical illustrations of the debo.tcaLIc.\nDigitized by GobgIe\n\f1882.] ~ppendw to Report on Tltotigkt-ReadiIlU.\nborder land between the discernment of muscular impressions and\nthe supersensuous perception of an unexpressed wish.\nThe first case is a sample of the ordinary willing game that came\nunder my notice in Easter, 1877.\nE:cpe. I.-The subject in this case was a young medical man, and the\nfriends present were mostly medical men, sceptical of the\noperation of any agency beyond involuntary muscular\naction. The experiments were made in the house of a'\ndistinguished surgeon, Mr. Lawson Tait. A paperknife was\nplaced by myself on the top of a folding screenduring the\nsubject's absence from the room; on recallinghim two friends\nclasped hands round the subject's waist; he then closed his\neyes, walked irresolutely to the spot, and took off the paper~\nknife, placing it on the table. Here involuntary guidance\nto the spot may be assumed, but it is difficult to understand\nwhat should have made him lift up his hands suddenly and\nfeel for an object out of sight. No indication of what was\nto be founl1 was given beforehand. '\nExpe. 2.-The same subject again left the room, one of the number\nascertaining that he was quite beyond eye or ear shot. This\ntime we willed that he should move the fire-screen and\ndouble it back. On re-entering, my host, the surgeon.\nclasped him as before, and aftera few moments of indecision,\nhe went towards the spot and did as we had wished.\nExpe. ~.-This time we fixed that the subject should turn out' the gas.\nof & particular bracket, one of several round the room.,\nLoosely held round the waist, the subject in a few minutes\nwent to the spot, lifted up his hands and turned off the\ngas.\nThese three experiments are of interest, inasmuch as in each one the\nhands had to be lifted up, muscles being used distant from the part in\ncontact with the willers. Similar results were obtained in July, 1877,\nwith Miss R. as the subject; one example will suffice.\nErqJt. 4.-During the absence of the subject, it was agreed that a mark\nshould be made with & pencil round a sixpence, which\nhappened to be lying near a sheet of paper on the table\nbefore the subject left the room. In this case the hands of\nthe willers were placed round Miss R.'s neck, and the action\nfixed upon silently willed. In a few moments Miss R.\nwalked to the table, took up a pencU, and deliberately'\nmade a mark rouM the sixpenoe.\nB\nDigitized by Google\n\fProf. W. F. Dnrrett. July 17;\nA long series of experiments extending over several days in May,\n1879, were made by me with another subject. In this case, the sister\nof the lady seemed to have the most power over her. Among\nnumerous trials that were made, the following may be quoted.\nE(\u00b7pt. 5.-In her absence, the subject was willed to take up a little\nagate jewel box, standing with some twenty other small\nobjects on a shelf, put it inside a certain covered jar in\nanother part of th.e room, reopen the jar, remove the\nornament and hand it to one.of the friends present. This\nwas done swiftly and correctly to the smallest detail\nit.cpt. 6.-Selected notes on the piano were four times in succession\ncorrectly struck. Here, and in Expt. 5, the hands gently\ntouched the head. In some of the next experiments the\nhands did not o.ctually tonch.\nExpt. 7.-r:.jrtain books in a book-case (containing some 100 volumes)\nwere chosen by me iD. the absence of the subject. In six\nconsecutive trials the right book was taken down.\nOut of a toto.l of 130 trials with this subject, of which the foregoing\nare fair samples, about 100 were correctly performed. Instead of giving\nihe details ofall these experiments I ma.y be permitted to summarise\nthem by saying that while . ~ nftfJf the muscular sense might\nhave been a sufficient e n\\. on, there ~~fiJ y others very carefully\ntested, which could no Qsily beso\"'eX}llainett' d which pointed in\nthe direction ofsome n~NI&J.fJ.8ilampl as mind-roading, as\ntheir only satisfo.ctol ex lana.1J.2I\\, _....In ~t, e intervent.ion of II.\n8econ~ person, who 1 ~~IY' ~ ;b what hu.d to be done,\nbetween the willer and til i6~ Ythk- s of each resting on the\nshoulders of the one in front, eli no serionsly interfere with the results\nobtained.

Two cases, however, one in London and\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] . Appendix to Repol-t on Thought-Reading. 51\none on .the south coast, seemed deserving of more careful inquiry. In\nthese, as in aJl the other cases recorded, the subjects freely placed\nthemselves in our hands, a kindness we desire gratefully to acknowledge,\nregretting the unrequited trouble we have given them.\nThe case in LOndon, that of Miss C., has been investigated by\neach of the members of the Committee on Thought-reading. Here is the\nrecord of four typical experiments made by Mr. Myers, on November\n\u00b73Oth and December\u00b7 7th, 1877.\n\"The mother of the young lady placed three of her fingers, not\nincluding the thumb, on the back of Miss C.'s head, the fuigers\nt'esting apparently quite lightly.\nZxpt. 1.-1 drew on a piece of paper a rough sketch of a house and\nshewed the sketch to Mrs. C. Miss C.'s head was averted\nthe whole time; no look was interchanged between her and\nMrs. C., no other part of their persons was in contact. No\none but Mrs. C. saw the drawing. I watched Mrs. C.'s\nfingers closely in full gaslight; they seemed to rest lightly\non Miss C.'s head; no signals perceptible. The drawing\nwas rudely reproduced, as though by a person drawing in\nthe' dark; one of the windows being drawn outside. the\noutline of the house.\nZ:ept. 2.-1 wrote a sentence and shewed it to Mrs. 0., taking care that\nMiss C. should not see it.

I Inay here observe that our President\nand Mrs. Sidgwick, who made somewhat similar experiments with two\u00b7\nother ladies, arrived at the conclusion that all the results witnessed by\nthem personally were capable of explanation by the hypothesis of'\nunconscious perception of unconscious muscular indications.

Mrs. H. said Birmingham.\nIn these two failures it will be noticed there is a slight\nresemblance in the words wrongly named.\"\nExperiments of this kind, however, even if not merely fortuitous in\ntheir results, have little scientific value unless one knows all the con-\nditions under which they are performed; their intprest consists in the\nindication they afford of a widening of the area of experiment, which\nis an important step.\nIt was after seeing the cc willing game j, in a friend's house\nthat the Rev. A. M. Creery, of Buxton, was led to try his own\nchildren for an evening's amusement. At first entirely sceptical of\nobtaining any results without contact, he was astonished at the success\nhe soon obtained under these conditions, whereupon, in January,\n1881, he wrote to me, having read in the papers my letter requesting\ninformation on this subject. It will be needless, in view of our own\nobservations, to\u00b7 detail all the early experiments Mr. Creery tried at\nmy request. One or two experiments, however, are of interest, as they\nare of a somewhat different nature.\nMARCH 21ST, 1881.-Present: Mr. and Mrs. Creery and family, and\ntwo friends, Mr. and Mrs. F.; who add their testimony to the accuracy\nof the report.\nFifteen experiments were made in the naming of objects or of\nEnglish towns selected in the child's absence; there were only three\ncomplete failures. Short sentences were now fixed upon, namely:\n\"What time is it1\" \"Will you have some supper'\" \"Will you go to\nbed 1\" \"Were you at the sale to-day1\" In each case the sentence was\ncorrectly named by tl:J.e subject on her return to the room; every care\nbeing taken that no information could be derived through the ordinary\nchannels of sensation. In these experiments the time that elapsed\nfrom the moment the subject entered the room to the utterance of the\nword selected, was found to vary from a few seconds to two minutes; in\none case four mirlutes elapsed. In another series of experiments\nMr. Creery tried placing the subject at various distances from the\n\" willers,\" and obtained successful results in the naming of cards even\nwhen the subject was placed in a bedroom upstairs whilst the willers\nremained in a room downstairs which was not under the bedroom.\nSo far as the children's testimony, and our own and \u00b7their parent!>'\nigitized byGoogl\n\f1882.] .A.ppendia:.10 Report on Thought-Beadino.\nobservation went,no injurious effect to the health has aceompan~ed these\nilxperiments; the children immediately afterwards engage in play with\nthe same zest as if they had not been interruP1ied by our trials. But it i~\nright to state that several correspondents have mentioned that trials\nwith the willing game produce dizziness and sometimes hysteria and'\nincipient trance in the subject of experiment.* .This is confirmed\nby a letter from the Rev. G. Henslow. published in Nature for June 23rd,\n1881; and by a recent letter in Knowledge, the editor of which has\ndevoted several articles to the exposition of our experiments on\nthought-reading, and has stated his own belief in the direct action\nof mind upon mind.\nInteresting and able articles on thought-reading have also. recently\nappeared in the Spectator, together with several letters on the subject.\n\u2022 The following letter from a correspondent, whose Dame and address I am\nnot at liberty to pubUsh, bears upon this point :_u Theone to be' willed' would\ngo to the other end of the house, if desired, whilst we agreed upon the thing to\nbe done, and before re-entering the room, the child was always effectually blind\u00b7\nfoldecL Then amidst total silence two of us would place our fingers lightly on\nthe child's waist, when after a moment's pausl!, he or she would suddenly dart off\ntowards the abject of the 'willin~,' paBBing roUDd the 'Various articles of furniture,\nas ifseeing them, without ever disturbing them, and often so rapidly that we oould\nnot keep up with him, and therefore detaching himself from our touch, We\nused to will the children to do the most unlikely things, such as to take a shoe off\none person's foot, and put it on another's head; or to find sometbing hidden up,\nand then present it on their knees to one of the company, &:0., &:c. In fact they\nwere such adepts at 'the game,' that the more outlandish the 'willing' was,\nthe more they liked it, and they were rarely, if ever, unsuccessful; the feat;.\nwas usually performetl very quickly, and when unbandaJred they were amazed at.\nwhat they had done and would langh heartily over it. The children stated that\nthey had no idea. of what they were doing, butfelt, as it were, a blind force com\u00b7\npelling them to certain aimless actions. Now I come b what seems to me a\nmost important feature in 'the game,' and which is the true cause of my\ntroubling you with this letu.r, viz., that it always ti1'etl the children very much,\neven to making the girls sometimes hysterical. Indeed we found it so exhaUst-\ning to them (sometimes also giving them. a queer and ~ga1'& look afterwards), that\nwe at last forbade it altogether, except on very rare occasions, to shew the\ncurious phenomena. to some special friends. I think, therefore, the fact of this\nexhaustion in strong, healthy children, from about twelve to sixteenyears of age,\naftera performance that never lasted more than two or threeminutes o.tm08t, and\nwasnever alJowed to be attempted by the same ohild more than twioe in the same\nevening, goes far toprovethatthe abnormal powers displayed bythem werenot the\neffectof mere mnscular action, either voluntary or involuntary, upon the children,\nandalsothat those abnormalpowerswere genuine. I shouldadd that the mostrigid\nsilence was enjoined by the children, and adhered to, and that they were alwaya\npartioula.r to be tlw1'tmghly blindfolded-as tbe exercise in any degree of their\nnormal senses of ,hearing and sight, seemed to interfere with the abnormal\nsenses induoed by being \u2022willed.'''

My youngest. child-a sensitive, quick-witted, little\nmaiden of two years and six weeks old-was one of the circle. Dinner\nhad just commenced, when I suddenly recollected an incident in. my\nmorning's experience which I had intended to tell her, and I looked at\nthe child with the full intention of saying, 'Mother saw lVbig, black\ndog in a shop, with curly hair,' catching her eyes iIi'mine, as I pa~\n,an instant before ~iDg.

'What colour was it, Evelyn\" said one of her\nelder brothers; 'was it black l' She said, ,Yes.'\n\"Now, it was simply impossible that she could have received any\nhint of the incident verbally. I had had no friend with me when I had\nseen the dog. All the children had been at home, in our house in the\ncountry, four miles from the town; I had returned, as I said, just in\ntime for the children's dinner, and I had not even remembered..thp. cir~\ncumstance until the moment when I fixed my eyes upon my little\ndaughter's.

These cases fall\nunder tae fourth group of phenomena mentioned in this report, and'\ntwo typical illustrations are given on pages 30 and 31. I am.\nindebted to Mrs. G. Bidder for the followmg additional evidence under- '\nthis head :-\" A conneetion of mine was staying with, a friend whose-\nhusband was engaged in making a line of railway in Spain. My friend\nwas roused one night by her hostess, who was in a terrible fright, and said\nshe was certain her husband was killed in a railway accident. She had\nbeen wakened with a start, and then had either seen the occurrence or-\nbeen told in some way, but how, she could not remember. My friend\nreminded her that the railway he was en~aed on did not open till the\nnext day, so that the accident was: unlikely. It turned out, however,.\nthat her husband had been doubtful of the safety of one part of the-\nline, and had insisted on running an engine over it in the night.\nto try it for the next day's opening, and he had been killed.\"\nIn the nlemoir of the 'late Bishop Wilberforce, a similar tra.ns-\nmission of an impression is recorded in the following words:-\n\"The Bishop was in his .library at Cuddesdon, with three or four-\nof his clergy writing with him at the same table. The Bishop.\nsuddenly raised his hand to his head, and exelaimed: 'I om certain\nthat sOmething has happened to one of my SODS.' It afterwards.\ntranSpired that just at that time his eldest son, who was at sea, had had\nhis foot badly crushed by an accident on board his ship.\" The Bishop.\nhimselfrecords this circumstance in a letter written atthe time, and dated\nMarch 4th, 1847. \"It is curious,\" the Bishop writes, \"that at the\u00b7\ntime of his accident, I was so possessed with the depressing conscious-\nness of some evil having befallen my son Herbert, that at last on the\nthird day after, the 13th, I wrote down that I was quite unable to,\nshake off the impression that something had happened to him, and\nnoted this down for remembrance.\"\nDr. Wilton, of Sutton, Surrey, is my authority for the following;\ncJ.Se :-\n\"A patient of niine, Mr. J.

She struck a match,\n,and was very astonished at not seeing her husband in the room. While\n:she was thinking over this singularly vivid delusion, her step-daughter,\nwho occupied an adjoining room, knocked .t the door, and on being\n:admitted, said, 'Oh! mother, I have had a. horrible dream about father,\n'8.Ild cannot sleep; I am afraid something has happened to him., In\nthe morning they both told their stories to their maid, and subsequently\n'to a gentleman who called while they were at breakfast.

Hitherto, as these facts\narose, the general explanation has been coincidence. It has been said,\n\"How many thousands of accidents occur, and no knowledge of them\n'has been conveyed to others, except through the ordinary means; but\nwhen, by a fortuitous circumstance or a natural foreboding, some friend\nf!IDcies an accident has occurred, and it turns out more or less 8.$\nim&e..med, then such coincidences are talked about as if they were\nrepresentative, or indiC!lotive of a law, whereas they are really nothing\nmore than chance shots.\" This would be a legitimate argument if the\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] '.Appmdi.7: to Report'on Tltollght-Read';J1g. 61\ncases were excessively rare, and so far as our knowledge ot the facts,\nextends at present, we are not in a position to do more than assert that-,\nenough well-authenticated cases are on record to render explanation by\ncoincidence difficult to entertain with any degree of confidence. When to\nthisis addedthe facts detailed in our report-fromwhichI venture tothink\nthe only fair conclusion is that some mode of supersensuous perception\nnot improbably exists-then it seems to me unphilosophical to reject, as\nunworthy of serious examination, all stories such as those just narrated.\nOn the other hand-reiterating what has been emphatically stated\nalready-wide generalisations are altogether premature. Our object\nhere, as elsewhere, is simply to collect, collate, and weigh the facts.\nusing, if need be, as a working hypothesis, the conclusions drawn from\nour Buxton experiments.\nNor must we forget that other workers have been in this or an\nadjoining field. A list of well-known names might easily be compiled\nwho have testified from critical observation that during the mesmeric\nsleep the mind of the mesmeriser can influence that of the subject,\nindependently of the ordinary chaunels of sensation.\nThe late Dr. Bush, a distinguished scholar, and Professor in the\nUniversity of New York, writes :-\" I know that the conceptions\nof my own mind have been reproduced in another mind without\nany outward signs, and I know that I have not been deceived\nas to the facts averred.\"\nDr. Mayo, F.R.S., who was Professor of Physiology and Anatomy in\nKing's College, London, and the author of an important treatise on\n\"The Nervous System and its Frmctions,\" gives similar testimony. In\ncounection with this subject, he remarks :-\" A number. of incidents\nare frequently turning up, for the most part on trivial occasions, which\nwe put aside for fear of being thought superstitious, because as yet\na natural solution is not at hand for them. Sympathy in general, the\nspread of panic fears, the simultaneous occurrence of the same thoughts\nto two persons, the intuitive knowledge of mankind possessed by some.\nthe magnetic fascination of others, may eventually be found to have to\ndo with a special and unsuspected cause.\"\nThe principle underlying these occurrences Dr. Mayo believes to be\nthe same that is found in a more striking form in mesmeric phenomena.\nOf the singular relationship that exists between the minds of the\nmesmeriser and his subject, producing an apparent community of\nthought and sensation, Dr. Mayo gives experimental evidence precisely\nsimilar to what has come under my own observation, and in conclusion\nhe states :-\" I hold that the mind of a living person in its mostnormal\nstate, is always, to a certain extent, acting exoneurally, or beyond the\nlimits of the bodily person.\" He remarks that :-\"It will be said the'\ncases, in which I suppose this power manifested. are of too trivial a.\nigitized byGoogl\n\fProf. W. F. Barrett. [July 17.,.\nnature to justify so novel a hypothesis. My answer is, the cases are\nfew and trivial only because the subject has not been attended to. For\nhow many centuries were the laws of electricity pre-indicated by the\n'single fact that a piece of amber, when rubbed, would attract light\nbodies. Again, the school of physiological materialists will; of course,\nbe opposed to it. They hold that the mind is but a function or product\n-of the brain.\"*\nAs we have stated in the Report, wehavebeen anxious to accumulate\n;and sift experimental evidence as to the facts before us, rather than to\n'indulge in theories as to the cause of the phenomena. We may, how-\n-ever, conceive of nervous energy acting by induction across space as\nwell as by conduction along the nerve fibres. In' fact, the numerous\n-analogies between electricity and nervous stimuli would lead to some\nsuch inference as the above. Or the brain might be regarded as the seat\n-of radiant energy like a glowing or a sounding body. In this case, the\n;reception of the energy would depend upon a possibility of synchronous\n\"vibration in the absorbing body; which, moreover, may be constituted\nlike a sensitive flame, in a state of unstable equilibrium, so that a.\n-distant mental disturbance inight suddenly and profoundly agitate\n,particular minds, whilst others might remain quiescent. _ Further, we\nmay conceive that, just as a vibrating tuning fork or string spends its\n-energy most swiftly when it is exciting another similar fork or string\nin unison with itself, so the activity of the brain may be more speedily\n-exhausted by the presence of other brains capable of sympathetic\nvibration with itself. -\nBut speculations such as these are merely of use in suggesting lines\n'Of experiment. For my own part, I have little doubt that a wider and\nmore exact knowledge of psychological phenomena\u00b7 will shew the\n\"insufficiency of any physical analogy or materialistic explanation, and\nthus should tend to accelerate the passage of the existing wave of\nmaterialism, the crestof which, there seems reason to believe, has already\n.gone over us.\nPOSTSCRIPl'.\nThe following extract from a letter in the Sussex Daily News is of\nBome interest in connection with the mode of experiment pursued by\nMr. Bishop. The subject of Thought-reading having been discussed,\n.. It was proposed that we should attempt the experiment. Accordingly\nI was blindfolded and left the room. Whilst I was absent a reel of\nblack cotton was secreted in a flower-pot near the window. On pressing\nthe haud of the gentleman who had secreted it against my forehead, and\nrequesting him to think of the object he had hidden, I saw plainly with\nmy blindfolded eyes, as though in a dream, the figure of a reel of black\n\u2022 \"Truths oontained in Popular Superstitions,\" p. 68 et &eq.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1882.] AppendifD to Report on Tkought-Reading. 63\ncotton floating before me. I then told him to think of where he had\nhidden it, and I saw and led him to a bure8.u at. the opposite end of the\nroom to the window. This he said was wrong, but on inquiry I found\nthat he had originally intended to have placed it there, but had altered\nhis mind. We then tried the question of localising a pain. Being\nblindfolded, and holding my friend's left hand against my forehead, I\ntold him to imagine a pain. Almost immediately I felt a peculiar,\nindescribable sensation on the right side of my face, and told him that\nhe was thinking of II pain there. He was, in fact, imagining a violent\nattack of neuralgia in the right upper jaw. Other experiments were\ntried and have been tried since, some successful, some unsuccessful, but\nI have seen quite enough to convince. me that there is truth in it. I\ndon't pretend to offer a reason, but I would say to those who disbelieve\nit, 'Try for' .>urselves.' All do not possess the power.
