[Jan., 1897.\nThe Minutes of the last Meeting were read and signed as correct.\nIn recognition of his services to the Society, Dr. Wm. Romaine\nNewbold, of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, U.S.A.,\nwas elected an Honorary Associate for the ensuing year.\nIn recognition also of the valuable work she had done for the\nSociety, Miss Porter was elected an Honorary Associate for the\nensuing year.\nSix new Associates were elected, and the election of four new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded. Their names and\naddresses are given above.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of Mrs. Mahlon Sands,\nfor many years a member of the Society.\nAt her request the name of Mrs. Janet E. Ruutz Rees, of the\nAmerican Branch, was transferred from the list of Honorary to that\nof Ordinary Associates.\nThe Rev. John W. Quinby, of East Bridgwater, Mass., U.S.A., has\nsignified his wish to become a Life Member of the Society, and has\nqualified accordingly.\nAt the request of Mr. John George Smith, his name is transferred\nfrom the list of Associates to that of Members, from the commencement\nof the ensuing year.\nThe resignation of twelve Associates, who from various causes\ndesired to terminate their connection with the Society at the end of\nthe year, was accepted. It was agreed to strike off the list the names\nof sixteen Associates, who had either removed, or been lost sight of,\nor who had become only nominal members.\nArrangements were made for the Annual Meeting of Members, to\nbe held at the Westminster Town Hall, on Friday, January 29th, at\n3 p.m. The names of the retiring Members of Council were read\nover, and the Assistant Secretary was directed to send out all\nnecessary notices.\nIt was agreed that, subsequently to the Meeting on January 29th,\nGeneral Meetings should be held on March 12th, at 8.30 p.m., on\nApril 23rd, at 4 p.m., and on May 28th, at 8.30 p.m.\nOn the proposition of Dr. A. Wallace, seconded by Mr. H. Arthur\nSmith, it was resolved that a sum of \u00a3100 per annum be paid to the\nEditor of the Society's publications, from the 1st of January, 1897,\npayable quarterly.\nVarious other matters having been disposed of, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council should be on Friday, January 29th,\nat the Westminster Town Hall, at the close of the Annual Business\nMeeting of Members on that day.\n\fJan., 1897.] General Meeting.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 83rd General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, December 4th, at 4 p.m.; the President,\nMb. W. Crookes, in the chair.\n\"MissX.\" read a paper on \"Some Recent Experiences apparently\nSupernormal.\" She opened her address by explaining the delay which\nhad occurred in presenting this case to the public. By Lady Burton's\nspecial directions, a part of it had been published in Borderland\nimmediately after her death, but as her relatives objected to the\nfurther publicity of its presentation to the Society for Psychical\nResearch she had, as a matter of courtesy, acceded to their wishes,\nand had delayed the matter for eight months. The critical and\nsystematic methods of the S.P.R. were not wholly congenial to Lady\nBurton, and the accounts of the phenomena which had been prepared\nat her dictation had not been originally intended for the Proceedings,\nthough, at the special request of \" Miss X.\" and Mr. M. D., she had\nconsented to their adaptation for this purpose.\nBy their \"adaptation \" \"Miss X.\" meant their restoration to their\noriginal form, the ipsinsima verba of the original messages, which\nhappily remained in \" Miss X.'s \" possession. While the MSS. had been\nin Lady Burton's care, she had dictated a careful transcription of such\nparts of their contents as she considered suitable for publication, omit\nting a great deal of matter of a wholly personal and private character\nwhich would of course remain unpublished. She had also supplied\nmany words and phrases which rendered the messages more coherent,\nand which she alleges, in various letters, were dictated to her by the\nspirit of her deceased husband. However, such interpolations \"Miss\nX.\" considered, were, from the point of view of evidence, undesirable,\nand she had therefore very carefully restored the original reading,\nthough it was undoubtedly often disconnected and difficult to\nfollow.\n\"Miss X.\" was anxious to state as emphatically as possible that in\npresenting Lady Burton's evidence she in no sense committed herself\nto Lady Burton's point of view, which was obviously that of a con\nvinced Spiritualist. \"Miss X.\" considered that the phenomena she was\nabout to describe were, to a considerable extent, perfectly explicable\non normal lines, given the hypotheses of thought-transference and sub\nconscious memory and observation. Accidental coincidence, possibly,\nmight explain certain details, and in regard to the small residuum she\nherself was perfectly willing to remain agnostic. Only very stupid\npeople talk in these days about the \" impossible,\" and she did not feel\n\f4 Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. TJan., 1897.\nthe hypothesis of spirit return by any means impossible, having a very\nstrong faith in what our fathers would call \"special Providences\" and\nin the Life of the world to come. In this particular instance she\nconsidered it, however, unnecessary. We had waited long for such\nalternative explanations as we now possessed, and as but a few years\nago such a story as she had now to tell would have been inevitably\nclassed as \"spiritualistic\" in every detail, she felt encouraged to\nbelieve that the time was not far hence when we should be able more\nexactly to classify even those incidents which perplexed us now, and\nperhaps to demonstrate and command their production. In what\ndirection such classification might lie, was, she felt, unimportant\nexcept to those who had a theory at stake ;\u2014-having no such theory,\nspiritual or material, she herself was content to wait, and meanwhile\nto say boldly \" I don't know.\"\nFor the sake of brevity, she would, throughout her paper, preserve\nthe form of personal statement which the messages had originally\nassumed. They purported to proceed from Sir Richard Burton\nhimself, and for the sake of convenience she would use such phrases\nas \" Sir Richard said \" and the like, but she begged her audience to\nbear in mind that she did so for convenience only, and without in any\ndegree committing herself to any theory as to their origin and source,\n\u2014without, for one moment, admitting any necessity to suppose that\nthe late Sir Richard Burton was in the very least concerned in the\nmatter. Her audience were well aware that sub conscious information\nwas very frequently externalised in picturesque or dramatic forms, as,\nfor example, in pictures in the crystal, in which an active visualiser\ncould often perceive not mere pictures only, but scenes full of action ;\nor occasionally writing, which though proceeding from the mind of the\nSeer would be, as it were, put into the mouth of some second person\nor even in the form of dialogues and conversations.\n\"Miss X.\" pointed out that the time at her disposal would not\nadmit of any discussion of the details of the experiences. She believed\nthat her own part in the story was, using the word in its broad, not its\nspiritualistic sense, that of a Medium, that is to say, that the informa\ntion, coming probably from various sources, was by her formulated\nand externalised only, that she originated nothing and even that\nnothing was self-suggested. The subject, as a whole, was one in which\nher own consciousness seemed unlikely to concern itself. Sir Richard\nBurton she had never seen in her life, she had never read one of his\nbooks, and had no desire for his acquaintance, living or dead. She\nwas fortunate enough to be interested in a very great variety of\nsubjects, but was always bored by geography in general and African\n\fJan., 1897.] General Meeting.\ntravel in particular. Her acquaintance with Lady Burton was of the\nvery slightest,\u2014she had found her a charming and attractive woman,\nbut they had little of common interest, especially in their point of\nview as to psychic phenomena.\nMoreover, the special form in which the greater part of these\nmessages had been externalised had been one not especially congenial\nto \" Miss X.\" She had seen so much folly perpetrated in the name of\nautomatic writing that she had always felt that planchettes and Ouija\nBoards lent themselves specially to self-deception ; that such a very\nlittle automatism went such a very long way that the productions of\nautomatic writers were often at best much on a level, as regards the\nrelation of the parts of one's consciousness, with the nonsense dreams\nsuggested and aided by some subjective perception.\nFurther, in the first sitting, in her opinion the most interesting,\nin so far as it was the most spontaneous, two of the three persons\npresent were personal friends of the Burtons and had special cause for\ninterest in African affairs. In the second day's sitting in which a\nfourth person, Major Anstruther Thomson, had been added to the\nparty, the results, undoubtedly interesting as thought-transference,\nwere all within the knowledge of some one present, and the later\nsittings with Lady Burton herself were evidentially of much less value,\nas her presence may have suggested the answers to questions she\nherself asked, and they lacked the spontaneity to which \"MissX.\"\nattached so much consequence. Speaking for herself, she had little\nconfidence in induced phenomena including stances and experiments\nof any kind.\n\" Miss X.\" proceeded to relate in outline the experiences under\nconsideration. An idle experiment with a Ouija Board led to a long\nseries of messages partly by means of the board with the assistance of\nher friend Mr. M. D., and partly by means of \" automatic \" writing\nby herself, always with the precaution of keeping the paper at arm's\nlength, and beyond her range of vision.\nThese \" messages \" (using the word in the sense familiar to the\nS.P.R.) purported to come from Sir Richard Burton, their object\nbeing to direct his widow how to make the best of the eight months\nof life, which, he averred, were all that remained to her, so as to carry\non as far as possible some work she had in hand, and which concerned\nthe fame and reputation of her husband.\nIn consequence of the expressed scepticism of \" Miss X.\" and\napparently to induce her continued interest, \" Sir Richard \" submitted\nto a series of test questions, giving names of persons and places, with\nsome personal descriptions, and sketches of character, of former\n\/\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1897.\nfriends entirely unknown to her. Moreover, \" he \" volunteered as\ntest information, the account of the loss of a brooch, which was\ncorrectly described, together with some detailed statements as to its\nhistory.\nAfter some consultation it was decided that, as most of the\nstatements could be verified only by some one having intimate know\nledge of Lady Burton's affairs, she herself should be consulted in\nthe matter, withholding only that part of the message which foretold\nher own death. By an unfortunate accident, however, the prediction\ntranspired, a fact evidentially to be regretted, as it is impossible to\nexclude the possibility of self-suggestion in its accurate fulfilment.\nLady Burton expressed the most vivid interest in the phenomena,\ntestified in detail to the accuracy of all the statements, was convinced\nof the personal identity of Sir Richard Burton as alleged in the\nmessages, and earnestly begged \" Miss X.\" and Mr. M. D. to pay her a\nvisit at Mortlake, suggesting that sittings should be held in Sir\nRichard Burton's mausoleum where, she alleged, she constantly\nconversed with him and where, she believed, it would be possible to\nreceive answers to various questions which the messages had\nsuggested.\n\"Miss X.\" and Mr. M. D., without at all committing themselves to\nthe views of their hostess, were nevertheless willing to carry out this\nexperiment, and the results were very curious and interesting, though\nsusceptible in great degree of explanation by \" suggestion \" in addition\nto thought-transference.\nTo Lady Burton's strongly expressed regret, Mr. M. D. and \" Miss\nX.\" left the neighbourhood almost immediately, the one for Yorkshire,\nthe other for Scotland, but later in the autumn another sitting was\nheld for the express purpose of proposing a series of questions which\nshe had prepared,\u2014again with very interesting results, which will be\ngiven in detail in \" MissX.'s\" forthcoming account in the Proceedings.\nLady Burton testified that, in her opinion, in addition to various\ngeneral statements which she considered highly characteristic of her\nlate husband, there were made, in the first three sittings, twenty-four\nassertions as to matters absolutely unknown to \"Miss X.,\" and almost\nall unknown to Mr. M. D. Major Anstruther Thomson testifies to the\naccuracy of the answers to all his test questions. On each occasion\ncareful notes were taken and afterwards transcribed and signed as\ncorrect by all present. The original notes were largely annotated\nby Lady Burton, and as has been already stated, a special copy com\npiled from these was prepared by her for publication. There are\nalso over a score of letters from her, critical and corroborative.\n\fJan., 1897.] Cure of Warts by Suggestion. 7\nIt is worth especial mention, in view of the theory that self-\nsuggestion may have aided in bringing about the exact fulfilment of\nthe prophecy of Lady Burton's death, that \"Miss X.\" received a letter\nfrom her just before her return to London, expressing the hope of\nfrequent intercourse, and that Mr. M. D. had an appointment with\nher for the very day on which she passed away.\n\" Miss X.\" concluded by saying, \" I have called these experiences\n' super-normal.' In the super-natural I have no belief. It seems\nto me that it is in the nature of a thing we may look for its\nlimitations. But things act often in some fashion that is unfamiliar\nto us, in consequence perhaps of the exertion of undeveloped powers\nor of new combinations of powers already known to us\u2014hence the\npossibilities of the supernormal lie in wait for us on every side. The\nmanner and the reason of such exertion we shall know when the right\ntime comes. Knowledge is the reward of labour, and our waiting\ntask is that of careful observation, careful record, and I think above\nall, suspended judgment and an open mind.\"\nThe Chairman remarked at the close of \" Miss X.'s \" address that\nhe had never heard a clearer or more scientifically thought out paper\non such a subject. He had himself been well acquainted with Sir\nRichard and Lady Burton, and the communications seemed to him in\nsome respects\u2014though not in all\u2014characteristic.\nA CASE OF THE CURE OF WARTS\nBY SUGGESTION.\nThe following case of the cure of warts by \"charming\" has recently\nreached us.\nMr. Claude P. Coghill, of Frankville, Athboy, Co. Meath,\nwrites :\u2014\nNovember 23rd, 1896.\nIn reply to your letter of the 7th inst. , requesting a full statement as to\nthe cure effected on the warts of my youngest daughter, I have pleasure in\ngiving the following statement :\u2014\nMy little girl was five years old in October last. The warts first appeared\nbefore she was a year old, and have been steadily increasing on hands and\nface. For over two years I have been trying various remedies, such as all\nthe usual wart cures advertised and obtainable at chemists', as well as those\nrecommended by friends, but without the slightest effect. In fact I became\nso uneasy, seeing them increase both in number and size, that I decided to\nask our doctor's advice. He advised nitric acid to be applied, but in the\n\/\"\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1897.\ncourse of conversation mentioned that a peasant in the locality had the\nreputation of being able to ' ' charm \" warts ; on making enquiries I found\nhe had completely cured several authentic cases, so decided to give him a\ntrial before using any more external applications.\nFive visits extending over a month were sufficient to effect a perfect cure.\nThe method was simplicity itself ; there was no preparation beforehand, he\nnever knew what day or hour my little girl would visit him ; the first day he\nwas cleaning out a stable when we arrived, and came up to the carriage to\nspeak to us without knowing the object of our visit. He took the child's hand\nin one of his while with the other he stroked her hand about six or seven\ntimes. During this process he was evidently repeating some incantation to\nhimself, but did not mind interruptions ; I noticed that he took no particular\ncare to touch the warts themselves. The treatment each time only lasted a\nminute or two. I did not look at the warts for about a week, and when I did\nwas surprised to find that some had almost disappeared, while others showed\nsigns of sinking. After that I observed the day after a visit a wart or two\nwould have disappeared, but that between this and the next visit no very\ngreat change would take place. There were fully thirteen warts in all, and\nprevious to my bringing her to this peasant I had for about six weeks given\nup any treatment. Now her hands are quite smooth, and not the smallest\ntrace left of where the warts were.\nIn reply to my questions, the man said he never had a failure, although\nlarge numbers come to him, many having warts as large as the top of his\nfinger. He is also able to cure animals in like manner. A gentleman of my\nacquaintance recently had a horse which was quite unsaleable from the size\nand quantity of warts over his body, which a veterinary surgeon who saw\nthe horse said could only be cured by cutting. My friend was induced to\nallow this peasant to try his \"charm,\" and after one visit to the stable\nthe warts began to shrivel and had all disappeared in ten days. The\npeasant's name and address is John Kane, Ballyboy, Athboy, Co. Meath,\nIreland.\nI shall be only too happy to answer any other questions. I may add\nthat we were all extremely sceptical as to the result, and were very much\nsurprised at the cure, which was as unaccountable as it was genuine. \u2014Yours\nfaithfully,\nClaude P. Coghill.\nP.S. \u2014I enclose doctor's certificate that there are now no warts on my\ndaughter's hands. I also enclose a statement from Miss De Winter who\nsome time ago had her warts cured by the same man.\nThe Doctor's certificate is as follows :\u2014\n\"Athboy, Co. Meaoh, November 23rd, 1896.\n\" I certify that the hands of Miss Ethel Maud Coghill are now\nperfectly free from warts.\n\" J. W. Grene, L.R.C.S.I., L.L.M.R.C.P.I.\"\n\fJan., 1897.] Cure of Warts by Suggestion. 9\nMr. Coghill adds :\u2014\n\" I am not very clear whether our local doctor examined the\nwarts or not, but it was owing to his advice that I brought my child\nto the man.\"\nThe other case referred to is described as follows by Miss De\nWinter :\u2014\nRathmore, Athboy, Co. Meath, November 19th, 1896.\nWhen I was eleven or twelve years old, I was greatly troubled with warts\non my left hand, and hearing from several of a man named John Kane,\nwho could cure them, I went to him, and after two or three turns the warts\nall disappeared, and I've never been troubled with any since. He merely\nrubbed his hand over them a few times and the warts seemed to wither away\nby magic.\nM. De Winter.\nI know the above to be a correct statement, as I have seen my niece's\nhands before and after.\nW. R. Wilkinson.\nMr. Coghill is continuing his investigation of these cures and has\nkindly promised to let us know the result.\nIt may be observed that the cases here recorded are not without\nparallel in the annals of suggestive therapeutics. Thus, in the paper\non \" Mind Cure, Faith Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes,\" by Dr. A.\nT. Myers and Mr. P. W. H. Myers (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX.,\np. 196), a case is quoted from the Revue Scientifique of February 4th,\n1893, of the cure of warts in a boy of thirteen by Dr. Gibert. Dr.\nGibert, wishing to test the efficacy of suggestion in the waking state\nto influence some pathological processes, impressed on the boy the\nnecessity of getting rid of the warts and emphasised his remarks by\nwashing the hands with water containing a little blue colouring\nmatter. A week later only two or three warts remained, and the\nsuggestion was then repeated in an impressive manner and the hands\nwashed with yellow-tinted water without any drug in it. After a few\ndays the last traces of the warts were gone.\nAgain, at the International Congress of Psychology held at Munich\nlast August, Dr. Bonjour, of Lausanne, reported that up to that time\nhe had cured warts in ten persons by suggestion in the waking state,\nhaving been himself cured of a large wart by his grandmother by the\nsame means. He said that he had known two other women who were\nable to do the same.\nIn a paper by the late Professor Delbceuf in the Revue de VHyp-\nnotisme for February, 1896 (p. 227), a case is described of a man\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1897.\nwho had had for several years a large wart at the root of his thumb\nand had tried innumerable remedies for it, all in vain, the wart mean\nwhile only increasing in size. Finally, he heard of an old woman who\nwas reputed to be able to \" charm \" warts away. Although completely\nincredulous, he applied to her ; she went through various incantations,\nand asked for money to make a novena at some church. He returned\nonce more, still completely incredulous as to the result, and on the\nninth day the wart disappeared.\nCASES.\nL. 1085. Ae P\" Impression.\nThe following account was sent to Professor Barrett in August,\n1895, by Mrs. Lincoln, of 91, South Circular-road, Dublin.\nOn the night of October 15th, 1884, I was preparing for bed at 10.30,\nand suddenly a great fear overcame me, a sense of horror and fright about\nthe steamship the \"Nevada,\" which was homeward bound from New York,\nand in which my elder niece Emily was a passenger.\nI was so vividly impressed with some calamity to the vessel that I\nearnestly prayed for the safety of the \" Nevada \" and all on board. I was\nin a miserable frame of mind, and wrote a few lines then and there. This\nwas on a Wednesday night. On the following Friday, the 17th, the telegraph\nboys were calling out, \" Arrival of the Nevada at Queenstown ; on tire for\nthree days previously ; all safe.\" We got the paper, and I need scarcely say\nwe were thankful for the good news of arrival in port. My niece and another\nlady had smelt fire on the 15th and mentioned it to the steward, who (though\nhe knew it), to prevent panic said, \" Oh, ladies are always fancying all sorts\nof things ;\" but it was soon made known, and as the cargo was partly sides of\nbacon, men had to go down into the hold and take up all the burning things\nand throw them overboard, whilst water was poured down the hold. These\nproceedings kept the fire under, but the steam from the water and the\nsmoke was terrible ; the ladies' clothes were saturated with the steam ;\nthe cabin floors were hot, so much so that when the la lies to refresh\nthemselves changed their damp clothes, as they fell on the floor of the cabin\nthey dried almost immediately. My niece helped the people with hot\ncoffee, etc., and no one lay down during the time from the discovery of\nthe fire. One woman, a steerage passenger, went mad and jumped over\nboard. The poor sailors who went into the hold were much burned ; two\nlost their sight and are now in the Seamen's Home (or hospital) in Liver\npool. The Captain visited my niece afterwards in Egremont, and\ncomplimented her, as did the doctor, on her coolness and firmness,\nupholding the frightened women in the cabin. She was very poorly after\nthis terrible experience.\n\fJan., 1897.] Cases. 11\nThe Captain's name I subjoin. My niece visited him about a week ago. I\nthink he will gladly bear testimony to these facts about the tire on the\n\" Nevada.\" I also give my niece's address. I wrote to her for the accurate\ndate, which I was not quite sure about, and I found it corresponded with\nwhat I had written, the 15th October, 1884.\nMiss Emily Williams, c\/o Henry Pooley, Esq., Fairhome, Liscard,\nCheshire.\nCaptain Bremner, the Training Ship \"Indefatigable,\" the Mersey,\nLiverpool.\nMrs. Lincoln's daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lionel Lincoln, writes as\nfollows in August, 1895 :\u2014\n91, S. Circular-road, Dublin.\nMrs. Lincoln told me about her premonition of the \"Nevada's \" peril the\nday after it occurred and the day before the fire was announced in Dublin.\nEliza Lincoln.\nIn reply to our inquiries Miss Emily Williams writes :\u2014\nFairhome, Liscard, Cheshire, October 24th [1895].\nThe fire on board the \"Nevada\" was discovered Wednesday, October\n15th, and was still burning when we reached Liverpool, Saturday, October\n18th, 1884. I am sorry my time is so fully occupied that I cannot write a\ndetailed account.\nEmily Williams.\nWe wrote to Captain Bremner asking for information about the\nfire on board the \" Nevada,\" and he replied :\u2014\nLiverpool Training Ship \"Indefatigable,\"\nNew Ferry, Birkenhead, October 25th, 1895.\nThe date of the discovery of the fire on board the \"Nevada \" was October\n15th, 1884, and it was not extinguished until the 18th in Liverpool.\nThe fire was discovered at noon and was partially extinguished the same\nnight, but the next day it broke out again. We were unable to master\nit on the second occasion, so I battened down all hatches and injected\nsteam into the hold, which subdued it and enabled us to finish the\nvoyage. ... I always give [Miss Williams] credit for an amount of\ncourage not often found in ladies, and she certainly proved herself worthy\nof it on that occasion.\nIf there is any more information you require I will [be] happy to give\nit to you.\nA. Wellesley Bbemner.\nMrs. Lincoln writes to us later :\u2014\n91, South Circular-road, Dublin, October 30th, 1895.\nI enclose the lines I wrote on the night when I experienced the very\nawful sensation of which you are aware. This was three days before the\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1897.\nvessel arrived on fire in Queenstown. I have had the habit of keeping\npaper and pencil on a table by my bed, and these verses came so rapidly\ninto my mind that there was little delay or trouble in jotting them down.\nLet me direct your attention to the two allusions to fire\u2014\" The fiery cross,\"\nand \" Lurid fore-gleams.\"\nEmily Lincoln.\nEnclosed was a copy of the verses, which express merely a fore\nboding of trouble, of an entirely undefined kind, coming upon the\nwriter. The two lines in which fire is referred to are: \u2014\"The fiery\ncross of sorrow\" and \"These lurid fore-gleams of coining disaster,\" and\nin these the conception of fire seems hardly more than metaphorical.\nThe semi-automatic motor impulse, however, bears witness to the\nimpressive nature of the experience.\nMrs. Lincoln informed us that the verses were written between\n10 o'clock, p.m. and 1 o'clock, a.m. of the night, October 15th-16th,\n1884, and that the original copy was dated October 16th.\nL. 1086. Clairvoyant Visions.\nThe next case came to us through the American Branch.\nMrs. Cora A. Morse sent the following account of her clairvoyant\nexperiences to Dr. Hodgson :\u2014\n2402, 4th Avenue, S., Minneapolis, Minn., August 9th, 1891.\nWhile making my home in the family of Mr. [Roff], then of Council\nBluffs, la., in 1881, my psychometric powers were under daily test.\nFollowing are two instances or more.\nMr. R. was in the habit of bringing in the mail from the P. O. and\nholding the letters on my forehead before reading himself or allowing\nanother to read them, and without my knowledge of even the addresses on\nenvelopes.\nOn one occasion while he was holding an unopened letter to my forehead,\nI said, ' ' This tells of sickness and is from some one in Watseka. Yes, I\nsee now, your daughter, Mrs. A, is very ill,\" telling also the particulars of\nher disease and adding \" You will get a telegram to-morrow which will call\nyou to her bedside, but she will not die. We must go to work and get\nready for a hasty departure. \" The letter was opened and found to contain\njust the news I said it did. The day following brought the telegram and\nthat evening bore the anxious parents to their sick daughter and she\nrecovered, just as I was impressed. Herself or either of her parents will\nbear testimony that this is true in every particular.\nOn another occasion while Mr. R. was holding a letter to my forehead, I\nburst into tears and excitedly cried, \" That's mine, give it to me. Some one\nis dead, for I see the words, ' Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the\ndoor.'\" He handed me the letter. I tore it open and the words I have\n\fJan., 1897.] Cases. 13\nquoted formed the heading of the letter, which was from my mother, telling\nme of the death of my brother's child.\nThere were present in the room at that time Mr. R. and wife, and the\nwife of Mr. R.'s son ; any or all of whom will substantiate this.\nOn the evening of May 21st, 1881, I was seated by a window at A. B.\nRolfs in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Saw two large balls of light pass the window\nfollowed by a long crimson scarf that [it] seemed would never pass, its length\nwas so great. I rose from my seat and went to the dining-room where some of\nthe family were at tea ; told them what I saw, and stated my convictions that\nit was some national calamity. The balls meant death and the long scarf\nblood that would enwrap the whole nation. I then saw a stout, dark young\nman who handed me a paper. I then said, \" We will hear of this by such a\nyoung man as I describe.\" Time passed and the vision had gone from\nmemory, when one day in July, same year, we all sat sewing and a man\npassed the window. I recognised the young man I had seen in my May\nvision ; sprang to meet him and he handed me a bulletin announcing\nGarfield's assassination, or rather the shooting that cost his life\u2014the first\nintimation we had had of such a thing.*\nMrs. R. afterwards said she thought I recognised a friend when I sprang\nto my feet. But no, it was the stranger I saw in my vision.\nAgain, I saw one evening a heavy lumber waggon on a road near my\nfather's home in Missouri. I saw next a child and a white apron. Didn't\nrecognise the child, her back was to me. I then saw my father and mother ;\nsaw that my mother's arm was run over by the waggon, was bruised, but\nnot broken. Saw father trying to get the team out of a ditch ; had pain in\nmy arm and saw that it was mother's right arm. Told the R.'s all this, and\nin a few days got word from home that my parents and my child (which I\ndidn't recognise) had gone from home for cherries. The teams crowded each\nother into a ditch. Mother was thrown out and the back wheels of the\nwaggon ran over her arm, bruising it, but not breaking it. This was the\ncontents of the letter. Did not know till a year after that what the child and\nthe white apron meant in particular, when, on visiting my parents, mother\ntold me (as a joke upon my little girl's sympathy) that when she fell from\nthe waggon, her white apron was torn from her waist and the lace ripped from\nit. My little one, then about seven years old, hastened to her side with the\nmutilated apron and said, \" Grandma, can't I have this for my doll ? \" And\nbadly hurt as mother was, she said she lay there and laughed to think that\nwas the child's first thought in such an hour of danger.\nIn the fall of 1880, while Dr. E. W. Stevens, of the Watseka Wonder, was\nat my home in Harrisonville, Mo., A. B. Roff and wife stopped en route from\nWatseka to Emporia, Kansas, for a few days' visit with the Doctor and my\nfamily. One evening during their stay, the Doctor, who was testing my powers\nin many ways, laid his hand on my head and said, \" I'd like to send you to\nmy house in Wisconsin and have you tell me what the folks are doing and all\nyou see.\" Very shortly I began to see his house and surroundings (I was\n* President Garfield was shot on July 2nd, and died on September 20th 1881.\u2014Ed.\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1897.\nperfectly conscious), then I entered the sitting-room, described the belong\nings, all of which the Doctor said was correct. I then described the occupants\nof the room ; four of whom he said were his wife, son, and two daughters ;\nsaw the wife mending hose, and the rest romping and having a gay time.\nSaw two more ladies I described, but he could not recognise them. Saw a\nlarge space on the wall that looked black, on which were many pictures of\nold and young, male and female ; this he recognised as his cabinet of cured\npatients. Its background was black velvet, and was fitted to the wall ;\ndidn't stand on legs, and so looked like the solid wall. I then saw the son,\none daughter, and one of the strange ladies take a lamp and go down in the\ncellar and bring up a pan of milk which they poured into bowls, and all sat\ndown to bread and milk, except the mother, who worked industriously at the\nmending, smiling all the while at the jests that seemed to be going the\nrounds. Just then I screamed, for all screamed ; the lamp had exploded\nwith a terrific sound, and all was darkness. I then came away from all\nconnection with that and could get no more. The Doctor was somewhat\ninterested and excited ; sat down and wrote at once to know if anything out\nof the usual run had happened at home that night ; if the family was alone\nor not ; \"Please write the particulars of the evening, etc.\" Read what he\nhad written to us and gave to Mr. R. to post. A few days later they all\nwent to Emporia. On arriving there the Doctor found a letter from his wife.\nHe handed the same to Mr. R. to read ; it said, \"Two neighbour girls were\nthere on the evening named, (naming them), and that while eating, etc., the\nlamp exploded and caused quite an excitement, but hurt no one,\" and asked\nthe Doctor ' ' what his impressions had been of the evening that he wrote to\nenquire, etc.\"\nThis is the plain unvarnished facts, as nearly as I am capable of giving\nthem, and is but one of many experiments tried by various persons with\nequally good results.\nMrs. Morse adds :\u2014\nThe day we got the bulletin referred to in vision first, was the day\nGarfield was assassinated. Was it July 2nd ? Am not sure of the date.\nMy parents' home was near K. C, Mo., about fifty miles south, at time\nI saw the vision at C. B.\nMr. Roff sends the following corroborative statement to\nDr. Hodgson :\u2014\nWatseka, August 31st, 1891.\nOn my return after a brief absence, I found the enclosed papers awaiting\nme. Mrs. M. forwarded them to me (enclosed in an envelope addressed\nto you) for my inspection, and such corroboration as I might be able\nto give.\nThe description of Mrs. M.'s journey (if I may so call it) to Dr. Stevens'\nhome in Wisconsin, and what she saw there in her clairvoyant visit is correct,\nevery word of it as given by her, yet she has not stated all. I remember\nvery distinctly that she described a tree or trees near the approach to the\n\fJan., 1897.] Cases. 15\nhouse and the gate, but I do not remember the description of them, but\nDr. S. recognised them by the description.\nI posted the letter after reading it carefully myself and sealing it. The\nDoctor had written his wife in the letter to direct her reply to care of A. B.\nRoff, Emporia, Kansas, and to reply immediately, as he would be there only\na few days. Dr. Stevens went with us (Mrs. R. and me) to Emporia the next\nday after the sitting described by Mrs. M., and the second day after our\narrival at the post-office I received the letter from Mrs. Stevens and handed\nit to the Doctor to open, but he said, \"No, you open it and read it.\" I did\nso, and everything was corroborated by her that was described in the enclosed\npaper.\nThe description of vision at our house in Council Bluffs, I now call to\nmind as the same substantially as given to us by Mrs. M. at the time.\nMis. Roff is now at Council Bluffs ; she could corroborate this statement\nmore fully perhaps than I can.\nWe also (Mrs. R. and myself) can vouch for the description of the accident\nto the mother, and its corroboration by letter from Harrisonville, Mo., which\nwas read to us and the vision described at the time it occurred.\nA. B. Roff.\nMr. Roff also sent to Dr. Hodgson the following letter from\nMrs. Stevens to himself :\u2014\nRock Prairie, Rock Co., Wis., April 20th, 1892.\nMr. Roff, \u2014Dear Sir, \u2014A letter from cousin V.

Crookes, F.R.S., in the chair.\nThe Notice convening the Meeting was read.\nThe President said that this was the first Annual General Meeting\nof Members held since the incorporation of the Society in the autumn\nof 1895. Four members of the Council retired by rotation at the end\nof 1896, but were all willing to stand for re-election, and had allowed\nthemselves to be nominated. Two other members had also been nomi\nnated. Notice of these nominations had been sent round to Members\nin accordance with the Articles of Association. These six nominations\nbeing sufficient to fill up the vacancies in the elected Members of the\nCouncil, and no other nominations having been made, the President\nsaid that he had only to declare that the following six Members were\nduly elected Members of the Council :\u2014The Right Hon. G. W.\nBalfour, M.P., Professor W. F. Barrett, The Earl of Crawford and\nBalcarres, K.T., F.R.S., Dr. Walter Leaf, Professor A. Macalister,\nM.D., F.R.S., and Mr. H. Arthur Smith.\nIn reference to the present position of the Society, the President\nsaid that the total number of names of all classes on the list\nof the Society on January 1st, 1896, was 922. The elections during\nlast year, 52, were exactly balanced by the resignations and deaths of\nMembers, 41 and 11 respectively. But, in addition to this, 16 names\nhad been struck off the list, of persons who had been lost sight of, or\nwho had become merely nominal members, thus reducing the number\nof the Society to 906.\nOn the other hand, the President called attention to the fact that the\namount of annual subscriptions paid during the year had increased by\none guinea ; but, owing to the continued diminution in the number of\n\"Members\" as compared with \"Associates,\" the actual number of\npaying subscribers is larger by several than in any previous year. It\n\fFeb., 1897.] Meeting of the Council. 19\ncould not therefore be said that the Society had made much progress\nduring the year. It had just a little more than held its own. The\nAmerican Branch during last year had diminished in numbers from\n441 to 420.\nThe President went on to say that he had before him an audited\nstatement of the Income and Expenditure of the Society during 1896,\nwhich would as usual be printed in the Journal. This was accompanied\nby an estimate of Assets and Liabilities at the end of 1896, and a\nletter from the Auditor expressing his satisfaction at the way in which\nthe accounts had been kept. The estimate of assets and liabilities was\nsatisfactory, as showing that the position of the Society had improved\nduring 1896 to the extent of between \u00a3300 and \u00a3400. This had arisen\nmainly from the receipt of a legacy of \u00a3 1 00 from one of its members,\nwhich had been invested, from the receipt of remittances from the\nAmerican Branch, and from some diminution in the expenditure on\nprinting. The President moved the adoption of the statement of\naccounts, which on being seconded and put to the meeting, was carried\nunanimously.\nThe President having invited remarks from members present, to\nwhich there was no response, declared the meeting closed.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe Council met at the close of the Annual General Meeting above\nreported. The President, Mr. W. Crookes, F.R.S., occupied the chair.\nThere were also present, Colonel J. Hartley, Professor O. J. Lodge,\nProfessor H. Sidgwick, Dr. G. F. Rogers, Dr. A. Wallace, and Messrs.\nF. W. H. Myers, Sydney C. Scott, and H. Arthur Smith.\nReport was made that the Annual General Meeting had been held,\nand that Members of Council had been elected as stated above.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nMr. William Crookes, F.R.S., was re-elected President of the\nSociety for the ensuing year.\nMr. H. Arthur Smith was elected as Hon. Treasurer, and Mr.\nF. W. H. Myers as Hon. Secretary, and Mr. Arthur Miall as Auditor\nfor the ensuing year.\nThe following were co-opted as Members of Council for the ensuing\nyear :\u2014Mr. Thos. Barkworth, Dr. A. W. Barrett, Dr. J.

Aksakof, which was\nsupported by Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Dr. G. C. Wittig, of Leipzig, was\nelected a Corresponding Member of the Society for the ensuing year.\nFour new Members and five new Associates, whose names and\naddresses are given above, were elected. The election of ten new\nAssociates of the American Branch was also recorded.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of Mrs. E. A. Lucas,\na Member of the Society, and of the Rev. Canon H. R. Smith, Mr. R.\nMorris Smith, and Mr. H. Venman, Associates of the Society.\nThe resignation of twenty-six Members and Associates, who for\nvarious reasons desired to terminate their connection with the Society\nat the end of 1896, was accepted.\nThe names of Miss Dallas, Mr. T. E. Mills, and the Rev. John\nRobbins were, at their request, transferred from the list of Members\nto that of Associates.\nThe audited statement of accounts was referred to the House and\nFinance Committee, who were requested to prepare an estimate of\nincome and expenditure for the current year, and present it, with their\nreport, to the next meeting of the Council.\nSeveral other matters having been attended to, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council be at the Rooms of the Society on\nFriday, the 12th of March, at 4.30 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 84th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, January 29th, at 4 p.m. ; the President,\nMr. W. Crookes, in the chair.\n\fFeb, 18\u00ab7.] General Meeting. 21\n\" Miss X \" read the following paper, entitled, \" A Passing Note on\na Haunted House.\"\nIt has been thought that the Society would be interested to hear\na brief statement with regard to an enquiry made some months ago\ninto the alleged hauntings of Clandon House, near Guildford, in\nSurrey ; although, for reasons that I shall explain, the enquiry has\nnot led to results at present admitting of publication in our\nProceedings.\nThe story of these hauntings is probably still fresh in the minds\nof most, in the form in which it was discussed in the newspapers about\na year ago. It is by no means a new one. The traditions of haunting\nhave been well known in the neighbourhood for many years past, and\nthe evidence seemed, on the whole, sufficient to warrant some examina\ntion by the S.P.R.. At the suggestion of the Marquis of Bute, a Vice-\nPresident of this Society, who happened to have a personal interest in\nthe locality, I was invited to collect and examine all the evidence\nobtainable, with the assistance of the late distinguished Q.C., Mr.\nBidder, also a personal friend of Lord Bute's. The evidence was not\nfar to seek. I had recently been staying in some country houses in\nthe neighbourhood of Clandon, and Mr. Bidder was a resident in the\nsame county. It was abundant and varied in kind. We ascertained\nthat the witnesses amounted to nearly a score. They were diverse as\nto age and class\u2014adults and children, educated persons and servants.\nThere had been no panic, no passing excitement, the evidence\nextended over a lengthened period, and was in many cases especially\ndefinite and clear. With Mr. Bidder's able assistance I examined some\nof the witnesses in person, and we are in possession of certain signed\nstatements, in addition to other narratives awaiting further examination\nand endorsement, and we had hoped to have a case of special interest\nin this particular direction to present to the Society.\nThe first check was caused by the death owing to an accident, a year\nago, of Mr. Bidder. His notes of the case, however, are happily in\nour possession. In the next place, the family who had recently rented\nClandon as Lord Onslow's tenants, upon whom we were in part\ndependent for help, refused entirely to give any assistance in the\nmatter. They are in no way opposed to the methods of this Society,\nand have no personal reason for concealment of any kind ; their refusal\nis entirely from motives of courtesy to Lord Onslow.\nIt was natural to appeal to the owner himself. The story, in an\nabsurdly exaggerated form, has appeared in a great number of news\npapers, English and foreign, the full name and address of Lord Onslow\nas owner of Clandon having been published again and again. It\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1897.\nseemed to us, therefore, that the interests of Lord Onslow\u2014as owner\nof a property which he desired to let\u2014had nothing to lose by further\ninvestigation ; and that\u2014in view of the ridiculous stories which were\nalready afloat\u2014those interests might be promoted by the application\nto the case of our customary methods of systematic enquiry, precision\nas to evidence, and moderation in the deduction of conclusions.\nAccordingly Lord Bute undertook to communicate with him in an\nindirect manner.\nThe answer was disappointing and rather surprising. Lord Onslow\nhad no belief in hauntings and was anxious for the sake of his property\nto avoid publicity. His method of securing privacy was to send to the\nnewspapers his reply to Lord Bute's letter ; and his indifference to the\nstories was manifested by the announcement that he and the adult\nmembers of his family slept with revolvers under their pillows.\nThe following is Lord Bute's own statement of the result of his\nattempt.\nCardiff Castle, Cardiff, August 9th, 1896.\nDear \"Miss X.\"\u2014I did not keep a copy of my letter to Lady Burghclere\nbecause it had not occurred to me that Lord Onslow would write to the\nnewspapers upon the subject, and still less that, in doing so, he would take\ncare to suppress my letter while publishing his own reply. I have, however,\na recollection of my letter quite sufficient to enable me to tell you what were\nits contents.\nI have not the honour of being known to Lord Onslow personally, and\nconsequently I did not like to take the liberty of writing to him directly.\nOn the advice of Mr. Myers, I wrote to Lady Burghclere, a member of the\nS.P.R. with whom I have the honour of being acquainted. Lord Burghclere\nis, as I understand, Lord Onslow's brother-in-law.\nI told Lady Burghclere that Colonel Fredcroft had sent me a newspaper\ncutting containing a very long account of the phenomena at Clandon,\nwritten by a special reporter who had been sent to the place on behalf of the\nnewspaper in question. I said that I had communicated this paper to Mr.\nMyers as Secretary S.P.R., and that you (whom I described), and our late\nlamented friend, the eminent Q.C., Mr. Bidder, had consequently gone to\nClandon, where you had interrogated a number of the eye-witnesses, and\nwhere you yourself had been so fortunate as to witness one of the most\nstriking of the phenomena.\nI then asked Lady Burghclere kindly to submit two requests for Lord\nOnslow's favourable consideration. The first of these was on behalf of Mr.\nMyers\u2014who has the honour of being well-known to Lady Burghclere,\u2014and\nwas that Lord Onslow would sanction the publication of the real names by\nthe S.P.R. when giving a notice of the facts. I said that I thought that\nLord Onslow could have little objection to this, as the statements had\nalready been published with the real names, not only in the English Press,\nbut also in French and Italian journals which I had seen, but that if Lord\n\fFeb., 1897.] General Meeting. 23\nOnslow for any reason did not desire their further publication, I could\nguarantee that the S.P.R. would keep them entirely concealed, and either\nmake use of initials or of names avowedly false, as it often does in such\ncases.\nThe second request, namely, that Lord Onslow would permit further\ninvestigation and sifting of evidence upon the spot, I said that I regarded as\nthe more important of the two. I said that no one would be sent to\nClandon to whom Lord Onslow could in any way object, or indeed whom he\nhad not approved, and that everything would be done in whatever way he\nmight consider as most convenient to himself. I said that the S.P.R. would\nprobably desire to send down one or more sensitives such as yourself,\nbut that it was also very desirable to make experiments with scientific\ninstruments, and that the frequent recurrence of the phenomena at Clandon\nseemed to make it a case where such experiments could be arranged for\nwith good results.\nI think, but am not quite sure, that I mentioned certain leading members\nof the S.P.R. \u2014Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Arthur Balfour, his brother Mr. Gerald\nBalfour, our late eminent friend Mr. Bidder, Mr Crookes (the President of\nthe British Electrical Association, etc., etc.), and Professor Lodge\u2014whose\nnames would inspire Lord Onslow with more confidence than I could hope\nhe would attach to my own.\nOn April 15th I underwent a surgical operation, from the consequences\nof which I was laid up for weeks. On the day after the operation, as I lay\nin bed, a letter was brought me, from the gilded initial and coronet on\nwhich I found that Lord Onslow had been so good as to write to me\ndirectly, which I had been too diffident to do to him. As in my then con\ndition I was unable to answer him myself, I directed the letter to be\nforwarded unopened to Mr. Myers, but I had immediately the advantage of\nreading its contents in the Ediiibro Evening Despatch, the London Globe and\nDaily Graphic, and the Glasgow Herald. \u2014 Sincerely yours,\n(Signed) Bute.\nIt has seemed desirable to make this letter known to the Society ;\nbecause Lord Onslow's letter to Lord Bute\u2014 if read (as it naturally has\nbeen) by persons unacquainted with the previous circumstances, or with\nthe terms of Lord Bute's request \u2014was calculated to suggest that Lord\nBute had shown some hastiness of belief in the matter in question.\nThis supposition would be erroneous, since Lord Bute's sole desire has\nbeen that phenomena which, however caused, have become a matter of\nmuch notoriety, should be enquired into in a manner as searching as\npossible.\nThere is just one witness who may be summoned before the Society\nwithout the sanction either of Lord Onslow or of his tenants, that\nwitness being myself.\nI had an opportunity some little time ago of paying a visit to\nClandon Park. I do not quote the date, because I do not, under\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Reseurch. [Feb., 1897.\nthe present circumstances, consider it necessary to identify which,\nof several tenants of Clandon, was my host on the occasion in\nquestion.\nAt the time of my visit I knew that the house had the reputation\nof being haunted ; I knew absolutely nothing of any details, a point\nI can prove when the right time comes, so far as one can ever prove\na negative.\nMoreover I should like to say, with emphasis, that I do not think\nI am suggestible in such matters. Many members of this Society\nand others have been good enough to invite me to explore houses\nalleged to be haunted, often, to their disappointment, with a wholly\nnegative result. In short, I do not necessarily see a phantasm\nbecause one is talked of ; that, indeed, is apt, when one is accustomed\nto careful criticism of one's own phenomena, to produce a self-sugges\ntion to the contrary.\nI arrived at the house in the dusk of an autumn day. I had been\ndisposed to discount largely from its eerie reputation for the fact that\nthe late owner had shut it up for nearly forty years, but there is\nnothing of the typically haunted-house character in its appearance.\nIt is light and airy, and except for a handsome marble hall, essentially\ncommonplace. It suggests draughts, and rats, and dry-rot, but not\nghosts.\nWe had tea cheerfully in the hall. The subject of the hauntings\nwas mentioned, but I begged, for evidential reasons, that it might be\ndropped at once. Should any phenomena present themselves, I did\nnot wish to have to discount more than was necessary for expectation.\nI was permitted to sit alone, in the dark, in four rooms alleged to be\nhaunted, but entirely without result. When I went up to dress for\ndinner, my hostess left me at the door of my room, with a promise to\nsend the maid. I followed her out a minute later to ask her to send\nan additional message as to something I wanted. Nothing else was\nfor the moment in my consciousness. I ran in the direction from\nwhich we had come, but my hostess had disappeared and I turned back\ntowards my room. As I turned I saw a lady coming towards me,\nperhaps 20 feet away. I stood for a moment waiting for her to get\nnearer before deciaing\u2014I am slow-sighted\u2014whether this really were\nmy hostess. No, it was evidently some one who had come to dine ; I\nhad heard that guests were expected. She was cloaked and hooded,\nher dress of yellowish white satin gleamed where her cloak parted\u2014\nshe had jewels on the low bodice. The costume was quaint, the hood\nof the kind known to our great-grandmothers as a \"riding-hood.\" I\nhappen to possess one of the kind, about 120 years old, and the outline\n\fFeb., 1897.] General Meeting. 25\nis quite familiar to me. She should be interesting and original, I\nreflected, and moved forward. Just as we met,\u2014when I could have\ntouched her,\u2014she vanished. I discovered later that my description\nof her corresponds with that of other seers who have met the same\nfigure before and since.\nI give my experience for what it is worth. I do not offer any\nopinion as to whether what I saw was the effect of thought-transference\nfrom others,\u2014whether it was in truth some phantasm out of the past,\nor whether it was merely a subjective hallucination, strangely coin\ncident with that of other persons unknown to me, as to place and\ndetail. The conditions under which I received the impression tend to\nsupport the consciousness I had at the time of not being in a nervous\nor excited state ; nor had I a preconceived idea,\u2014or information of\nany kind\u2014as to what I was expected to see.\nThe President then, after announcing his own re-election for the\ncoming year, delivered the following address.\nHe began by saying that it was no formal or easy matter to give\nan address upon a science which, though still in a purely nascent stage,\nseemed to him at least as important as any other science whatever\u2014\nthe embryo of something which in time may dominate the whole world\nof thought. He remarked that his own deep and sustained interest in\npsychical problems was connected with a quality that had been helpful\nto him in physical discoveries\u2014his \" vital knowledge \" of his own\nignorance. He would try to utilise this open and accessible temper of\nmind by clearing away certain presuppositions, on one side or on the\nother, which seemed to depend upon a hasty assumption that we know\nmore about the universe than as yet we really can know.\nFirst, addressing himself to those who believed with him in the\nsurvival of man's individuality after death, he would point out a\ncurious, inveterate and widespread illusion,\u2014viz., that our earthly\nbodies are a kind of norm of humanity, so that ethereal bodies, if such\nthere be, must correspond to them in shape and size. Now the human\nbody represents, indeed, the most perfect thinking and acting machine\nyet evolved on this earth ; but its form and structure are entirely con\nditioned by the actual strength of the force of terrestrial gravitation.\nTo illustrate this he described in vivid detail the remarkable altera\ntions that would be necessary in the bodily structure and form of\nhuman beings if the force of gravitation were doubled ; and the\nchanges of an inverse nature that must attend a material decrease in\nthe earth's attraction. These considerations showed the inconsistency\nof the popular conception of spiritual beings as utterly independent of\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Fbb , 1897.\ngravitation, and yet retaining shapes and proportions conditioned by\nthe exact gravitating force exerted by the earth. His own view of\nthe constitution of spiritual beings resembled Faraday's surmise as to\nthe ultimate nature of material atoms ; he conceived them as centres\nof will, energy, and power, in some way mutually penetrable, and\neach retaining its own individuality, persistence of self, and memory.\nMateriality and form, he was constrained to believe, are merely\ntemporary conditions of our present existence.\nTurning to those who deny the possibility of the existence of an\nunseen world at all, he pointed out that we are demonstrably standing\non the brink of, at any rate, one unseen world\u2014the world of the\ninfinitely little, of forces whose action lies mainly outside the limit of\nhuman perception. Imagining a homunculus of almost infinitesimal\nsize, he showed how, for such a being, the molecular foices\nof surface tension, capillarity, and cohesion would become so con\nspicuous and dominant as to render it difficult for him to believe in\nuniversal gravitation. Such a being's experience would lead him to\nconclude that liquids at rest assumed curvilinear forms ; that they\ncould not be poured from one vessel to another, and unlike solids,\nresisted the force of gravitation ; and that such bodies as he could\nmanipulate generally refused to sink in liquids. Then, similarly\nimagining how Nature would present itself to a human being of\nenormous size, he showed how this colossus could scarcely move without\n\" making everything too hot to hold \" ; and therefore would naturally\nascribe to granite rocks such properties as we attribute to phosphorus.\n\" Is it not possible,\" he asked, \" that our boasted knowledge of the\nphysical world may be similarly conditioned by accidental environ\nment? \" so that by the mere virtue of our size and weight we fall into\nmisinterpretations of phenomena from which we should escape were\nwe larger or smaller, or the globe we inhabit heavier or lighter. As a\nfurther illustration of the same topic, he quoted from Professor James\n\u2014our late President \u2014a description of the effect that great differences\nin the amount of duration intuitively felt by living creatures, and in\nthe fineness of the events that may fill it, would have in changing\nthe aspect of Nature.\nHe then went on to apply this general conception, of the impossibi\nlity of predicting what agencies undivined may habitually be at w. irk\naround us, to the case of Telepathy ; \u2014the accumulated evidence for\nwhich is shirked and evaded by scientific men generally, as though\nthere were some great a priori improbability which absolved the\nworld of science from considering it. He could not admit any such\na priori improbability as would justify the refusal to examine our\n\fFeb., 1897.] General Meeting. 27\nevidence. Our alleged facts might be true in all kinds of ways without\ncontradicting any truth already known. He would suggest one line\nof explanation.\nThe vibrations of air and ether of whose existence we have good\nevidence vary in frequency up to nearly two thousand trillions per\nsecond. If we begin with the pendulum beating seconds in air,\nand keep on doubling, we get a series of steps. At the fifth step from\nunity\u201432 vibrations per second\u2014we reach the region where sound\nbegins. The next ten steps bring us to the point where, for the average\nhuman ear, sound ends, though to some animals a higher rate of\nvibration is evidently audible. From the 16 th to the 30th step, the\nvibrations\u2014now in ether\u2014-rise rapidly, and appear to our means of\nobservation as electrical rays. Then comes a region of 15 steps, in\nwhich the functions of the vibrations in relation to our organisms are\nunknown. Then from the 45th to between the 50th and 51st steps\n\u2014i.e., from 35,184372,088832 to 1875,000000,000000 vibrations per\nsecond\u2014we have heat and light. Going further, we find ourselves\nin a region of vibrations of which our existing senses and means of\nresearch give us as yet no positive knowledge ; but it is not unlikely\nthat the Rontgen rays will be found to lie between the 58th and 61st\nsteps ; and vibrations of even higher frequency may well be supposed\nto exist, with important functions.\nIt seemed to him that in the rays of very high frequency, we\nmight have a possible mode of transmitting intelligence. It did not\nrequire much stretch of scientific imagination to conceive rays of so\nhigh a rate of frequency as to pass, unrefracted and unreflected,\nthrough the densest obstacle ; and we might conceive the brain to\ncontain a centre using these rays as the vocal cords use sound vibra\ntions, and sending them out with the velocity of light, to impinge on\nthe receiving ganglion of another brain. He admitted it to be difficult\nto explain why such vibrations should impress one brain only ; but\nsuggested that intense thought concentrated towards a sensitive with\nwhom the thinker is in close sympathy might conceivably induce a\ntelepathic chain along which \" brain waves\" might go straight to their\ngoal, even without loss of energy due to distance.\nThis speculation, he repeated, was strictly provisional : but the\ntime might come when it would be possible to submit- it to experi\nmental tests.\nHe would add one further reflection, dealing with the law of the\nconservation of energy. It is a pre-eminent canon of scientific belief\nthat no work can be effected without using up a corresponding value\nin energy of another kind. But, as he showed, the most momentous\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1897.\neffects may be produced by differences in the determination of\ndirection of motion which do not correspond to any difference in the\nexpenditure of energy ; and thus the play of the \" mystic forces \" of\nintelligence and free will is, to an important extent, outside the law of\nconservation of energy as understood by physicists. Thus an omni\npotent being might rule the course of this world by the expenditure of\ninfinitesimal diverting force upon ultra-microscopic modifications of the\nhuman germ, in such a way that none of us should discover the hidden\nsprings of action.\nIn conclusion, he could see no good reason why any man of scientific\nmind should shut his eyes to our work, or deliberately stand aloof from\nit. In every form of research there must be a beginning : we own to\nmuch that is tentative, much that may turn out to be erroneous. But\nit is thus, and thus only, that each science in turn takes its stand.\nEXTENSIONS OF SUBLIMINAL FACULTY DURING SLEEP.\nIn Dr. Bramwell's paper on \" Personally observed Hypnotic\nPhenomena \" in Part XXXI. of the Proceedings, many instances are\ngiven of the extension of ordinary faculties during hypnosis. In\nconnection with these, it may be of interest to quote two cases of a\nmore familiar type, in which some ordinary faculties appear to have\nbeen heightened,\u2014though to a much less remarkable degree,\u2014in the\nstate of natural sleep.\nThe first of these may be compared with Dr. Bramwell's cases of the\nappreciation of time by somnambules. In the latter the appreciation\nof time was accompanied by a motor impulse, originating in the\nsuggestion of the hypnotiser. The subject was impelled to make a\ncross with a pencil on a piece of paper and write down what time\nshe believed it to be. In the case now quoted (which was obtained\nby Mr. Barkworth), the idea of the time is\u2014as usual in dreams \u2014\nassociated with a definite sensory impression, obviously the result of\nself-suggestion, and the time is estimated . probably with greater\nexactitude than it would have been if the percipient had been awake.\nShe writes :\u2014\nOctober, 1893.\nI am in the habit of lying down after midday dinner on Sunday till 10\nminutes to 3, when I have to start for the Sunday school. At this time I\nvery often go to sleep and have found that I can always trust to waking\nexactly at the same time. One day, being very tired, I fell into a heavier\nsleep than usual, and might easily have overslept the right moment. But,\nwhile still asleep, I saw the large white face of a clock with the hands\n\fFeb., 1897.] Subliminal Faculty during Sleep. 29\npointing to 10 minutes to 3. I woke myself with an effort, and found the\nhands of my watch exactly at that hour. The face of the clock I saw in my\nsleep was not like any in the house ; there was a small American clock in\nmy room with a white face.\nMary L. Palmer.\nThe second case relates to the revival in sleep of memory of a\ntune that the dreamer had vainly tried to recall when he was awake.\nThe spontaneous revival of memory of tunes which it is impossible\nto recollect by an effort of will is of course a very common experience.\nThis case is unusual in that the recollection of a tune heard only once\nwas revived during sleep with so much intensity that it was never\nforgotten again. Dr. Bramwell gives instances of the improvement of\nmemory through hypnosis in his paper (pp. 193-195) and many instances\nof the spontaneous recovery of memory in dreams are given by Mr.\nMyers in his paper on \" The Subliminal Consciousness, Chapter IV.\nHypermnesic Dreams :\" in the Proceedings, Vol. VIII. p. 362. The\ncase was sent to us by Mr. G. M. Smith, of the Custom House, Amble,\nNorthumberland, an Associate of the Society, in August 1896. He\nwrites :\u2014\nI was in Sydney, N.S.W., from November, 1879, to February, 1880. I\nwent to a Presbyterian Church one forenoon in January, 1880, at Balmain.\nI was greatly struck with a tune to which one of the hymns was sung during\nthe service. Its name was given out as \" Lydia New \" or \"New Lydia.\" I\nhad never heard the tune before, but was under the impression that I had\nseen it in an old collection of hymn tunes which was at my home in Aberdeen.\nThe tune seemed to me particularly good and appropriate to the words to\nwhich it was sung, and I tried to learn it while they were singing it. I got\nwhat seemed to me to be a fair idea of it and endeavoured to fix it in my\nmemory and for some time managed to do so ; but it gradually faded out until\nI could recall nothing at all of it. But I still remembered its name, and\nmeant to look it up when I got home to Aberdeen. We left Sydney for\nLondon in February, 1880, by which time I had completely forgotten all\nabout how the tune went, except that it was a CM. or 8.6.8 6. time tune.\nOn the passage home I often used to try to recall it, as it still haunted me,\nbut I could not do so, try as I might. One night while on the passage home\n(the passage lasted 116 days from February 3rd, but I cannot even approxi\nmately give the date of the night I refer to) I dreamt that I was at the same\nchurch in Balmain, that the same hymn was sung to the same tune and that\nI resolved that this time I should not forget it, for by the time it was finished\nI remembered it correctly. Just as it finished, I awoke with the tune\nringing in my ears and I knew it correctly. So astonished was I that\nI lay awake humming over the tune and did not go to sleep again.\nI think I got up and jotted it down on something in Sol-fa ; but my\n(Continued on p. 32.)\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

PAGE\nAn Exposure 33\nThe Use of Hypnotism in Education 37\nThe Cure of Warts by Suggestion 40\n41\nAN EXPOSURE.\nAt the present stage of our Society's investigations, the exposure of\nfraudulent so-called \" spiritualistic \" manifestations seems still to be\noccasionally a necessary part of our work, and we therefore think it\nworth while to print the following case.\nIn Light of January 2nd, 1897, a communication appeared, under\nthe title, Remarkable Experience of a Durham Miner ; A Talking\nClock, the main part of which is here reprinted.\n... In the possession of this Durham miner is a disused French clock,\nof the old-fashioned shape, a wood frame encasing very ordinary arrangement\nof wheels, and a door of glass in the style of many years ago. Perhaps when\nthe clock was new it would be priced at from 6s. to 7s. 6d. , and it was a\nwedding present to the miner's wife. For several years past the clock has\nbeen useless as a timekeeper. It is utterly out of order now\u2014without\npendulum or suspending wire. It has otherwise been injured, and is kept\nmerely as an ornament on the chimney-piece of the miner's downstairs\nroom, solely out of regard for the associations of the donor's name with the\noccasion of the gift. The miner's wife has been very hard of belief in\nSpiritualism, almost as she is, unfortunately, of hearing. She suffers very\nmuch on account of her inability to hear ordinary conversation, and this fact\nhas a close connection with the performances of the old clock. I am\ninformed that it is six months since the wife of this miner had her attention\ndrawn to the old timepiece. As she stood over the fire attending to the\ncooking or other household duties, she imagined she heard the clock ticking\naway, and, watching the fingers on the face, she saw that the long finger\nundoubtedly moved. She knew quite well that the clock had not been\nwound up, that the pendulum was off, and that the clock as a clock would\nnot go. She asked it questions, and, listening attentively, she received\nanswers, according to the common code of one for \" No,\" two for ' ' Doubtful, \"\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1897.\nand three for \"Yes.\" This proved to her sceptical mind that there was\nmore in the subject of Spiritualism than either her husband or any other\nindividual had been able to advance to her satisfaction.\nBeing a woman of shrewd common-sense, she put the clock to a test.\nShe put some very practical questions to it, and received answers which, on\nher husband's return to his home from his work, proved correct in every\ndetail.\nIn course of time the clock has been educated to communicate with the\nhusband in a very peculiar way. His duties require him to be down the\nmine an hour or more in advance of the miners who have to labour in that\nportion of the mine under his supervision ; and it has become quite a custom\nwith him to pay strict attention to the clock when he is preparing, in the\nvery small hours of the morning, to descend the mine for his usual round of\ninspection. If the clock has anything of importance to announce, the\nnumber of ticks is given as arranged for in the miner's code. He will then\nsay, \" Do you want to tell me something?\" Three ticks, \"Yes.\" \"Will\nall be right to-day ? \" According to the answer the conversation proceeds.\n. . . [Here follow two instances of cases in which it is asserted\u2014\nobviously on the sole authority of the miner himself\u2014that information given\nby the clock led to the prevention of accidents in the mine.]\nThe clock, by ticks, spells out the name of the person controlling it. The\nticks are produced by the flat steel spring on which the pendulum wire was\nformerly suspended. The works of the clock are put in motion by the\noperation of this spring and the motion given to the escapement wheel.\nThe movement can be seen going on even when the ticks are not loud enough\nto be heard clearly. The clock communicates wherever placed in the miner's\nhouse ; talks with the baby\u2014a child about two years old ; answers any one\nin the house ; and approves of conversation going on in the ordinary way at\ntable, even if not specially addressed to it.\nThe name of the person who most often controls is that of a former\nworking mate of the owner of the clock. He is doing all the good he can by\nthe exercise of what foresight he is gifted with \" beyond the veil,\" and his\nfriend in the flesh says he has never found him at fault yet ! There is no\nvarnish upon this narrative, no veneer, no polish ; it is a plain story and\ntrue. To-day I have been fortunate enough to pay a visit to the cottage of\nthis miner, handled the clock, conversed with it, and [saw] how it communi\ncates intelligence ; and I challenge any scientist to disparage my story or\nexplain it away.\nThe miner, his wife, and their baby girl are all mediums ; and the clock\nis a medium, for it goes on whoever is standing by. When friends have\nbeen sitting at table, the clock has been ticking and the spirit friends have\nbeen walking about the bedroom floor overhead\u2014heard by all present.\nI supply to you, Mr. Editor, the name of the owner of the clock for your\nown satisfaction, and I assure you I am perfectly certain no contrivance is\npossible by which this clock can be made to work as it does, except the true\ncontrivance I claim for it. . . .\n(Signed) J. L.\n\fMar., 1897.] An Exposure. 35\nThe case was investigated by Mr. E. T. Nisbet, an Honorary\nAssociate of the S.P.R., who has done much useful work of various\nkinds for us.\nHe reports as follows :\u2014\n17, Latimer-street, Tynemouth, February 1st, 1897.\nI have carefully investigated the above, and to my mind the story as put\nforth by Mr. L. in Light is utterly worthless.\nOn Saturday last (January 30th), I took the clock to Mr. Kuss, the\nclockmaker in Collingwood-street, Newcastle, and got one of his practical\nmen to examine it in my presence. He found, \u2014what I expected,\u2014that the\nspring was more than half wound ; the works are complete and in good order,\nwith the exception of one small pin which is slightly displaced, and this\ndisplacement retards the working of the clock to some extent ; the whole of\nthe works are exceedingly dirty, and it is only when the oil in the works is\nsubjected to heat (as it is on the narrow mantelpiece over the miner's huge\nfire), or when the clock is tilted, that the small rod moves at all. If cleaned,\nof course, the small rod would tick rapidly and soon run the spring down,\nbeing without a pendulum. It is all nonsense to say that the clock is never\nwound ; the clockmaker smiled when I told him the pretensions put forward\nfor the clock. He says the clock is all right and would go quite well if it\nwas only cleaned and fitted with a pendulum.\nIt is an excellent instrument for the devices of the professional medium.\nYesterday while it was in my possession, I got it to answer all kinds of\nquestions just as I liked for my wife and children. All I required to do was\nto get it near enough the fire to set it on its erratic course. When I wanted\n\" No,\" I took the first tick as \"No,\" then asked another question, and if I\nwanted \" Yes,\" I simply waited till I got three ticks for \" Yes,\" and so on.\nWhen I wanted it to stop, I put it in a cooler part of the room. If, when\nnear the fire, it went on ticking too quickly, I explained that the spirit was\nangry or merry, just as Mr. L. and the rest of them do.\nBut I had better tell you the story from the first. I got the enclosed\nletter from Mr. L. and met him at the Liberal Club last Tuesday (January\n26th). At first he was very reticent and would not tell where the clock was,\nnor who was the owner. I could see the clock if I liked to come to his\nhouse and sit at a seance ; he would have the clock brought by the owner,who\nwas a medium. I declined to investigate the clock under any such conditions.\nThe owner of the clock had been threatened with prosecution for something\nin connection with his spiritualism, and had been protected by Mr. L. and a\nfriend. It had been agreed that people could only approach the medium\nthrough Mr. L. or his friend, etc., etc., etc.\nThen I offered to go to the miner's house with Mr. L. After a good deal\nof talk he agreed to take me that night to the Felling (about three miles from\nNewcastle). We went there about 6.30 to Mr. G.'s [assumed initial] but found\non arrival that G. had left about 5 to go to Mr. L.'s house. We found Mrs.\nG. and her three children in the sitting room. The mother was preparing the\nchildren for bed. I was shown the clock, an ordinary miner's alarum clock.\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1897.\nAfter explanations the clock was set on the table with a large swinging oil\nlamp just above it, the glass door was opened and alighted candle set near it,\nso that I might see any movement. The little girl of two years was put on\na chair to talk to the clock. She kept calling \"Beattie,\" \"Beattie.\"\nMrs. G., who was washing the two boys, also kept speaking to it now and\nthen. Mr. L. and the two boys also tried. After various examinations and\ntiltings we got various small erratic movements, but no satisfactory answer.\nThen we put it on the mantelpiece ; there the movement was more\nsatisfactory, and Mr. L. was quite pleased with the answers he professed to\nget. I need not weary you with all the absurd queries, etc.; suffice it to say\nthat after various experiments with it on the table and on the mantelpiece,\nit began to dawn upon me that the clock was affected by heat, for when the\nlamp was put near the ceiling and the candle removed, the clock was almost\nsilent on the table unless we tilted it.\nHaving observed this and the amusing way in which L. took his answers\njust as he wanted them, being content with one tick when he wanted \"No,\"\nand waiting for three when he wanted \"Yes,\" and giving all sorts of absurd\nexplanations when the ticking continued when no [questions] were asked, I\nundertook to get whatever answers I wanted from the clock myself.\nI should first tell you that Mrs. G. had twice asked if a friend of hers\nhad been able to go to the Newcastle Infirmary that day ; the first time it\nanswered \"No,\" the second time \"Doubtful.\"\nI put it on the mantelpiece and asked the following questions, much to\nL. 's disgust, though he turned it off with a laugh :\u2014\n\" Is Mr. L.'s opinion of this clock the right one ? \" Answer : \"No.\"\n\"Is my opinion of this clock the right one ? \" Answer : \"Yes.\"\n\" Has Mrs. G.'s friend gone to the Infirmary to-day\" ? Answer: \"Yes.\"\nOn getting this last answer, I turned to Mrs. G. and shouted (as she is\nvery deaf), \" Your friend has gone to the Infirmary ! \" This had evidently\nmade an impression on [her], for on Saturday she told me with elation, \" the\nclock was quite right, my friend did go to the Infirmary on Tuesday.\" I\nreminded her that the clock gave three answers, all different. But of course\nthat had no effect upon her.\nThis will give you a little idea of the kind of thing that is going on. I\nhave not seen the husband yet ; but I strongly suspect he is a humbug, and\nwinds the clock unknown to any one. The poor wife, I think, is innocent,\nthough very ignorant. She confided to me on Saturday that she is no\nSpiritualist, though much impressed by a \"slap on the face\" she once got at\na seance ! She complains of her husband being always away at week-ends\ngiving stances.\nI called on Saturday to ask G. for the loan of the clock till Monday.\nHe was at for a seance. I am sorry I did not see him, for I would\nhave preferred to get his permission to have the clock. His wife readily\noffered to lend me the clock, which convinces me she does not know her\nhusband's little ways. (She said the key was lost and the clock was never\nwound up.) I to6k care that the clockmaker left the clock exactly as he\nfound it before examination. He put the displaced pin in position, just to\n\fMab., 1897.] The Use of Hypnotism in Education. 37\nlet me see that the clock would go better so, but I made him put it back\nexactly as he found it. (He put one drop of oil at the top of the rod. ) No\ndoubt G. knows the value of that slight displacement, as it retards the\nworking of the clock. I found that while in my possession it went 55\nminutes in 24 hours. On Saturday night and on Sunday night when this\nroom got heated with gas, the clock moved a little, even on my monocleid\naway from the fire.\nI sent the clock back to-night by my son. Unfortunately no one was in\nMr. G's. house ; a woman next door said Mrs. G. said the clock had to be\nleft there if it came.\nThe main point is the clock would act exactly as it does now if no\nmedium was near the place, and the medium in this case is 'cute enough to\nutilise it for his own purposes. The evidence of the poor wife is quite\nvalueless ; she is very deaf and has great difficulty in hearing the ticks ;\nindeed she does not hear them, I believe, she only sees the movement.\nEd. T. Nisbet.\nOn coming to these conclusions, Mr. Nisbet wrote to Mr. L. asking\nfor an interview with Mr. G. at a seance or otherwise, as they thought\nbest, with their own conditions, so that he might see what results\nwere obtained by G. himself. He intended to take the clockmaker\nwith him and, if necessary, get him to explain the mechanism and\ncondition of the clock to Mr. L. A few days later, however, he wrote\nto us as follows :\u2014\nFebruary 17th, 1897.\nI saw Mr. L. yesterday and find that nothing more can be done about the\nclock, as he is now quite disillusioned about G. and has threatened to drum\nhim out of the spiritualistic movement, if he does not retire voluntarily. I\nhad not time to get full particulars ; but it is the old story :\u2014G. discovered\nby a doctor immediately prior to a seance with a suspicious cord concealed\nround his body ; lies ; and absurd attempts at vindication. Clock been\nexamined by another clockmaker ; same result as mine ; apparent violent\nrevulsion of L. . . .\nEd. T. Nisbet.\nTHE USE OF HYPNOTISM IN EDUCATION.\nTwo recent numbers (January 1st, and February 1st, 1897) of\nthe American medical journal, Pediatrics, contain a discussion on\nthe use of hypnotism in education, the main points of which we\nrecapitulate here. The discussion originated in an article on the\nsubject by Dr. R. Osgood Mason in the North American Review.\nThis was attacked by Dr. Lightner Witmer, of the University of\nPennsylvania, and Dr. Mason replies to the attack.\nIt does not appear from Dr. Lightner Witmer's paper that he\nhimself has had any practical experience of hypnotism, either as an\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [Mar , 1897.\noperator or even as a witness of the operations of others. It is\nperhaps in consequence of this that he generalises on the subject with\na much greater freedom and confidence than we usually meet with in the\nwritings of expert practical hypnotists. He maintains that hypnotism\nin the treatment of disorders \" has been shown in a few cases to be\neffective ; but the vast majority of cases demonstrate it to be either use\nless orworse. In consequence, many physicians who have tried hypnotism\nin practice deny to it all therapeutic efficacy. In medicine, the life of\na panacea is generally short . . . inasmuch as its worthlessness\ncan so soon be demonstrated. Unfortunately, this is not the case in\neducation, where the connection between cause and effect is difficult to\ndemonstrate.\" The writer thinks therefore that Dr. Mason's article,\nin speaking with \" such unbounding (sic) confidence \" of the uses of\nhypnotism, is likely to mislead the public. He remarks that \" Mind\ncures, and faith cures, and hypnotic cures have a hold upon the layman,\nbecause he has neither the knowledge nor the insight to determine the\nwell marked line of distinction between those cases in which the mind\nmay act in a remedial way, and those in which its influence produces no\nbeneficial change whatever.\" \"We may observe, however, that while it\nis no doubt possible that there may be a well-marked line of distinction\nbetween the two classes of cases here assumed to exist, a physiologist\nwould probably be the last person to claim that he was acquainted\nwith its position.\nDr. Lightner Witmer admits that hypnotism may now and then in\na limited class of cases be useful, but thinks that its usefulness has\nbeen greatly exaggerated and fears that in Dr. Mason's article many\nreaders may \" accept for fact what is only the author's individual\nopinion.\" In support of his own views, however, he does not quote a\nsingle authority and only brings forward one case,\u2014and that one in\nwhich he merely believes that certain results will follow on a certain\ntreatment. The case was that of a lady under treatment for stutter\ning ; which was prevented on one occasion by hypnotic suggestion.\nDr. Lightner Witmer found also that suggestion in the waking state\nwas not without effect on her; and he is apparently not aware that this\nis a frequent practice with many hypnotic operators, some even main\ntaining that suggestion in the waking state is identical with that in\nhypnotism. Believing, however, that the effect of the hypnotic\nsuggestion would soon wear off, he persuaded his patient to take\nlessons in articulation instead. The result of these lessons is not\nreported, the writer merely recording his belief that they would effect\na permanent cure.\nHe ends by repeating the now almost obsolete fallacy as to the\n\fMar., 1897.] The Use of Hypnotism, in Education. 39\nclose connection of hypnotism with hysteria and its tendency to develop\nhysterical symptoms. He asserts\u2014without offering a shadow of proof\nfor the statement\u2014that if such disorders as insomnia are treated by\nhypnotism, the amount of treatment has to be constantly increased,\nand when it is stopped, the patient is worse than before. Finally,\nthough he admits that hypnotism, if judiciously employed, may help to\ndevelop \" psychic control,\" he lays great stress on the danger that the\nsubject may become entirely dependent on the hypnotiser.\nIn reply, Dr. Osgood Mason denies that hypnotism has ever been\nclaimed to be a panacea, or sure cure for any disease, by any one\ncompetent to speak of it, but says that those physicians who have\nmade the most extensive use of it find it an efficient help in very many,\nif not in the majority, of the cases to which they apply it. Like any\nother therapeutic agency\u2014-e.g., drugs or surgical instruments\u2014it\nrequires skilful application and may do harm if used ignorantly. But,\n\" if evil is done by hypnotism, it is the fault of the operator, and not\nof the agent.\"\nIn contrast to Dr. Lightner Witmer's vague and general allega\ntions, Dr. Mason refers first to the report of Dr. Berillon (the editor\nof the Revue de VHypnotisms) on the successful treatment of more\nthan 250 children for such disorders as nervous insomnia, night terrors,\nsomnambulism, kleptomania, stammering, etc. (See Dr. Berillon's paper\nin the Report of the International Congress of Experimental Psychology,\nLondon, 1892, p. 166. It apppears that several of the physicians who\ntook part in the discussion on Dr. Berillon's paper were familiar with\nthe effects described, or similar ones, in their own practice.) He states\nthat he has himself verified the good effect of hypnotic suggestion in\nalmost every class of cases mentioned by Dr. Benllon and proceeds\nto quote several instances. One was that of a school girl of 15,\nwhose inveterate inattention, forgetfulness and incapacity for learn\ning her lessons, led her teachers to report to her mother that it was\nimpossible for her to pass a certain examination. She was brought to\nDr. Mason a few weeks before it, and had six treatments. Her\nlessons at once began to improve and she passed the examination\nsatisfactorily, and a subsequent one a few weeks later without any\nrenewal of the treatment. Another was a case of a striking improve\nment in spelling, and to a certain extent grammar, in the letters of \" a\ngenerally intelligent but uneducated woman.\" The same woman had\nbeen accustomed to walk all her life in her sleep\u2014often into dangerous\nsituations. This was entirely cured by a single suggestion and has\nnot occurred again for nearly two years. In a third case, a little boy\nof 7 was treated for extreme timidity and cowardice, with markedly\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mab., 1897.\nbeneficial results. Another was that of a little girl who had dreamt\nevery night for months of a hideous black man and used to wake\nscreaming with terror. After a single treatment, the dream ceased\nand has not occurred again for a year. Another case was one of\ndepression and suicidal mania in a young man of 1 9 ; this also was\ncured by a single treatment, nearly a year before the date of the paper,\nand has not recurred since.\nDr. Mason emphatically denies that the patient's will was in any\nway weakened in these cases, or that he became dependent on the\noperator. He maintains, on the contrary, that the whole tendency of\nthe treatment was to increase his power of self control. The same view,\nthough not universally held by hypnotic experts, was strongly insisted\non, as our readers will remember, in Dr. Bramwell's recent papers in\nPart XXXI of the Proceedings. Dr. Mason further denies,\u2014and this\nof course, the great majority of physicians who have had experience of\nhypnotism also deny,\u2014that there is anything morbid in the suscepti\nbility to hypnotic influence, or that it is most efficacious in dealing\nwith hysterical subjects.\nDr. Mason is about to bring out a book on \" Telepathy and the\nSubliminal Self ; a work treating of hypnotism, automatism, trance\nand phantasms \" (published by Henry Holt and Co., New York), in\nwhich we hope that these and other results of his hypnotic studies will\nappear in full.\nTHE CURE OF WARTS BY SUGGESTION.\nSoon after we received the interesting case contributed to the\nJournal of last January by Mr. C. P. Coghill (see p. 7), the following\nsimilar instance was reported to us. Though this case is much more\nremote than that described by Mr. Coghill, there seems no reason to\ndoubt that the main outlines of the incident are correctly remembered.\nConservative Club, St. James's Street, S.W.,\nDecember 23rd, 1896.\nMy personal experience of the so-called \"wart charming\" is as\nfollows. When a boy of about 9 years of age, my family were living at\nFulham, and my father occasionally availed himself of the services of a local\nchiropodist, who also, I believe, was a clockmaker and attended to the clocks\nin the house. My left hand at that time was much disfigured by a crop of\nsmall warts, which had refused to yield to any of the usual remedies.\nDuring one of his visits, this was noticed by the chiropodist,\u2014whose name\nI forget, (the incident is nearly 32 years ago),\u2014and he without any hesitation\nand in a very unpretentious manner offered to remove them ; and I\n\fMar., 1897.] Cases. 41\nremember my parents, and a nurse, seemed to take it quite as a matter of\ncourse that he was about to \"charm \" them (the warts), away.\nMy recollection of the exact procedure is vague ; but, so far as my memory\nserves, he touched the warts lightly with his finger, counted them roughly,\ntied a piece of red wool or thread round my wrist, which I think I had to\nsleep with and burn next morning. I am certain no medicinal application\nof any kind was made, or knife or scraper used. He told me not to think\nabout them, but that on his next visit, in a week or 10 days' time, they would\nhave disappeared.\nAnd it undoubtedly so happened,\u2014whether \"post hoc,\" or \"propter hoc,\"\nI express no opinion.\nBut I can certainly testify to the very general belief in wart charming,\nsome 25 to 30 years ago, as being accepted as a very everyday occurrence,\nand quite in the natural order of things, though perhaps savouring a little of\nwhite magic.\nArthur Palliser, Junr.\nWe have received further communications from Mr. Coghill about\nthe operations of the man referred to in his report, which we are\nhoping to print when more evidence is obtained.\nGASES.\nL. 1087. A(1 Pa Apparition.\nWe are indebted to the kindness of Mrs. Benecke for the following\naccount. Her son, Mr. E. F. M. Benecke, was an Exhibitioner of\nBalliol College, Oxford, and, as his posthumous work on \" The Position\nof Women in Greek Poetry \" shows, a classical scholar of the highest\npromise. He was a good Alpine climber, and was collaborating in a\nguide to the Swiss Alps at the time of his death. On the day on which\nit occurred, he was seen in Mrs. Benecke's garden by the daughter of\nher laundress.\nThe percipient writes to Mrs. Benecke :\u2014\n80, Mayes-road, Wood Green, February 1st, 1897.\nMadam, \u2014 Mother has this morning brought your letter to Emma over to\nme, as I could better write what happened on July 16th, 1895, as it was me\nthat saw Mr. Edward with another gentleman in the garden (as I thought).\nI remember it all so well that I have been able to write it just as it\nhappened.\u2014Yours respectfully,\nE. Nichols.\n[P.S.]\u2014I have signed the other paper with my name as it was then.\nOn Tuesday, July 16th, 1895, between the hours of 1 and 2 o'clock, I was\ndoing some work in our bedroom and, looking out of the window, saw (as I\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mab., 1897.\nthought) Mr. Edward Benecke with another young gentleman walking in the\ngarden, and I went at once to mother and told her Mr. Edward had come\nhome, and she said something must have prevented him from starting, as we\nknew he was going to Switzerland for his holiday, for I was positive it was\nhim I saw. When nurse came in on the Thursday, mother asked her if Mr.\nEdward had come home, and she said \"No\" and then we only said \"I\nthought I saw him,\" and we thought no more about it until the sad news\nreached us.\nEllen Carter.\nIn answer to some questions from Mrs. Benecke, Mrs. Nichols\nwrites further :\u2014\n80, Mayes-road, Wood Green, February 4th, 1897.\nMadam, \u2014I am glad to be able to answer the questions you have asked\nme. I did see another young man with Mr. Edward (as I thought it was)\nand the look was not momentary, for I was so surprised to see him that I\nwatched him until he turned round the path ; he was coming, as he\nsometimes did after luncheon, from the stable yard, along the path and\nturned towards the house. He was smiling and talking to his friend, and I\nparticularly noticed his hair, which was wavy as it always was ; he had\nnothing on his head. It was all that that made me feel so sure it was him,\nand I felt that I could not have been mistaken, knowing him so well. I\ncannot tell you anything [about] what the other young gentleman was like,\nas he was walking the other side ; also I hardly noticed him at all, being so\nsurprised to see Mr. Edward. Mother was doubtful when I told her about\nit and said I must be mistaken ; but I said I was sure I was not, and I was\npositive I had seen him, and I felt sure he had come home until nurse came\nin and said he had not been home, and then I thought how strange it was,\nand even then I could not think I was so mistaken, and often have I thought\nabout it and feel even now that it was him I saw. Mother did say perhaps\nsome accident had happened to his friend that he was to travel with and so\nwas prevented from going ; that was the only remark that was made about\nan accident.\nIf there is any other question I can answer, I shall be only too glad to do\nit for you.\nE. Nichols.\nMrs. Benecke gives the following particulars : \u2014\nTeddy was in the habit of walking regularly in the garden, from 10\nminutes past 12 till 1 o'clock, and again directly after luncheon, varying,\naccording to the time this meal took us, from 1.30 or 1.45 till 2.30. He was\nso regular that I could tell the time by his footfall on the stairs. He never,\nexcept in the very coldest weather\u2014to please me\u2014wore a hat or cap in the\ngarden. The laundress often watched him walking up and down the garden\npaths, noticing the wind playing with his wavy hair. She even, at times,\nwould get up on a stool to watch him, especially when Margaret was with\nhim. She says they looked so bright and happy together. She has left us\nowing to her health, and her daughter married quite lately.\n\fMab., 1897.] Cases. 43\nTeddy was devoted to his \"dear mountains,\" they were a \"second home\"\nto him ; but all his letters prove that his thoughts were very much with us\non the climbs. He wrote to me in 1892 that when bivouacking out even\nin his Bietschhorn, \" it felt strange to be so far away, so high up, and as I\nwrapped myself in my rug, I thought of you all, sitting round the lamp, etc.\"\nIn 1895 he wrote, after his successful crossing the Wetterliicke, (a climb\nhe was quite delighted with) \"at 8.30,\u2014just as you were coming down to\nbreakfast, I was thinking\u2014we were through.\" The last climb he wrote\nabout to both Margaret and myself he said: \"The last half-hour was not\npleasant ; it was the only time during the climb that I was not sorry you\n(Margaret) were not with us.\" With a heart so full of thought and love of\nus at home, even when intensely interested and occupied in his dearest\npursuit, it seems natural that when called to leave us once more, he should\nhave turned towards us and sent his loving thoughts home. That they took\nhis shape and were seen once more on his familiar path seems very wonderful\nand of course inexplicable, but to me seems a fact. I believe that he was\ntaken when his form appeared here. It makes it somewhat more difficult to\nconjecture where it happened, as he intended to be back by 4 and this time\n\u2014between 1 and 2\u2014gives therefore only 3 hours from Ivied .\nI wrote to our former laundress with respect to her having seen Teddy on\nJuly 16th, 1895. Our old nurse told me that it was the younger daughter,\nEmma, who had seen him. I could not, at the time Mrs. Carter left our\nservice, November, 1895, trust myself to speak to her about it ; therefore I\nwas rather uncertain as to what really had been said, and when I received\nthe first letter, I wrote for a few more particulars.\nIt was through this letter that I heard, for the first time, that Ellen\nCarter saw two forms, which seems all the more remarkable to me. I therefore\nwondered if she could remember the face of the friend. I had understood\nshe had seen him \"about one o'clock \" and had thought it was in his morning\nwalk, but Ellen is positive that it was later. His coming out of the stable\nyard is quite likely ; he often fetched the dog. I asked her if it was a\n\"momentary passing view\" she had, as in the first letter she writes almost\nas if she had merely looked out and then gone to her mother.\nWhen I heard this talked about, I remembered the word \" accident \" and\nasked her if it was mentioned. Her answer in [the second] letter refers\nto this question.\nIn answer to our further enquiries, Mrs. Benecke wrote :\u2014\nNorfolk Lodge, Barnet, February, 15th, 1897.\nI will do my best to answer your questions and to do it clearly and\nsystematically.\nEllen Carter lived with her mother and sister in a cottage in our garden.\nI have tried to give you an idea of the cottage by the enclosed sketch. I took\nthis sketch from our dining-room window, past which the broad path leads,\nwhich I called A. Along this path my son went daily and often have I\nwatched his light swinging steps till he had gone through the little gate I\ncalled B. This leads into our kitchen garden. I had understood that when\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1897.\nEllen saw him on July 16th, 1895, he was coming back from his first walk\nthrough the gate B and had turned towards our house down the path A. You\nwill easily understand that during the first months, I could not ask questions\nabout the events of that day,\u2014nor, in fact, can I now. But I was told of Ellen\nhaving seen my son almost directly after my return, and Mr. Benecke heard\nof it at once. I will return to this directly. Ellen was in her mother's\nhouse tidying their bedroom (which has the window I have marked I), when,\nlooking up, she saw my son. She tells about that herself and that he \" was\ncoming out of the stable yard. \" That would not be quite his usual direction,\nbecause he mostly jumped out of the window after luncheon, but still it did\nhappen that he would fetch the dog, or put him away, in the yard. The door\nleading into the yard is behind bushes and he would, according to Ellen's\naccount, have come from there and out where the path D comes out towards\nour house. You will, I hope, understand from this about the distance from\nthe cottage to the path, and that it would be quite easy for Ellen, who seems\nto have quite good sight, to have seen him distinctly and for a minute at\nleast.\nMrs. Carter cannot write, so it would only be what Ellen wrote for her\nwhich we should get by asking for her version. Our old nurse, who can\nwrite, is very confused about what and when she first heard of it, and there\nfore she can write down nothing. I have asked her several times about it all,\nbut she varies each time in her statements, except that she remembers Mrs.\nCarter asking her if \" Mr. Teddy had come home,\" and then her saying \"Oh,\nI told Nellie she was mistaken, when she thought she saw him.\" She could\nnot have spoken like that if the conversation had taken place after we heard\nthe terrible news. Mr. Benecke remembers that the gardeners told him,\nafter the news, that Ellen had said she had seen Mr. Teddy, and the general\nimpression has certainly been that she had said so, and therefore had believed\nit, that she had seen him in the garden, on that day. [She is convinced] that\nit was \"Mr. Teddy, no one else\" she saw, for she said that she knew his pretty\nwavy hair too well to make a mistake, and she quite sulked when it was\nproved to her that she was mistaken.\nWe heard the terrible news on Saturday morning, July 20th, and I started\nfive minutes later to catch the train and go over to Switzerland. Of course\nthe servants heard of it at once, and Nellie then is said to have been very much\nstartled when she heard it. There has never been any doubt in our minds\nhere that she had all along said she had seen him on the Tuesday.\nThere have been printed notices of my dear boy's loss in many papers.\nWe have no means of fixing the hour of it. All we know of his plans for\nJuly 16th was that he started with Mr. Cohen at 3 a.m. from Ried, and was\nseen at 3.30 a.m. at Blatten, and that he had arranged with the guides of\nRied to meet him there at 4 p.m. o'clock on the Tuesday, 16th, to settle\ndetails for a tour on the 17th. My son was very accurate and always\nplanned his tours exactly before starting. The guides told me that he knew\nevery inch of ground in the neighbourhood. He was working for Mr.\nCoolidge and there was but one ridge of rock not yet explored in the district\nassigned to him. I feel certain that the two friends started for that ridge\n\fMar., 1897.] 45\nCases.\n\"Feenkiindl\" and that there they are now resting.

The account here reproduced\nwas privately printed in 1878, having been written\u2014though this does\nnot appear in the narrative\u2014by Mrs. W., wife of the Rev. Dr. W.\nreferred to. We are requested not to give the names of the witnesses.\nIn July, 1860, I went to reside for a short time at Trinity, near Edin\nburgh, accompanied by my little daughter A. and a servant. On Sunday,\n15th of that month, the Rev. Dr. W., of Edinburgh, late in the afternoon,\nwalked down to see me, and, on his way, heard that a terrible railway accident\nhad just occurred on the line between Edinburgh and Granton ; that an engine\nand tender, with five men, had run off the rail, and that three of them had\nbeen killed on the spot. On arriving at Trinity he told me what had\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1897.\nhappened, and asked if I had heard any particulars. I replied that I had\nnot heard of the accident at all, not having seen any one that afternoon.\nAfter a little further conversation on the subject, I said, \"I have had a\nstrange nervous feeling this afternoon about A. for which I am unable\nto account ; I wonder if it could have had any relation to this accident.\"\nHe asked what I meant, and I replied as follows :\u2014 \"Between three and\nfour o'clock I told A. to go out and take a short walk, and as she was\nquite alone I advised her to go into the railway garden (a name she gave to\na narrow strip of ground between the sea-wall and the railway embankment,\nwhich was closed by a gate at either end). A few minutes after her\ndeparture I distinctly heard a voice, as it were, within me say, ' send for her\nback, or something dreadful will happen to her.' I thought it was a strange\nsuggestion. I reasoned with myself, what could happen to her on so lovely\na day, with hardly a ripple on the sea, all the world gone to church, and in\nso quiet a walk, where she would probably meet no one but a nursemaid and\nsome children\u2014so I refused to send for her. But a little afterwards the\nsame thing occurred again ; the same words were repeated in the same\nmanner as before, but, as appeared to me, with greater emphasis. Again I\nresisted the thought that she could be exposed to any danger, and taxed my\nimagination to divine what could happen. The only thing that suggested\nitself was the possibility of her encountering a mad dog ; but this was so\nvery unlikely that I dismissed it entirely from my mind, and I persuaded\nmyself that it would be absurd to bring her back on account of such a fancy,\nand, though beginning to feel uneasy, I still resolved to do nothing, and\nendeavoured to throw off the oppressive feeling by occupying my mind with\nother things. For a time I succeeded. But soon the voice renewed the\nwarning, in nearly the same words as before, ' Send for her back, or some\nthing terrible will happen to her.' At the same moment I was seized with\na violent trembling, and a feeling of great terror took possession of me. I\nrose hastily, rang the bell, and ordered the servant to go immediately and\nbring Miss A. home, repeating at the same time the words of the warning,\n' or something dreadful will happen to her.' The servant, in order to\nquiet my agitation, said, ' Nothing can possibly happen to her, ma'am, she\ncan be in no danger. The weather is very fine ; everything is so quiet ;\neverybody is at church. I never saw you nervous before, and yet Miss\nA. has been often out alone, and you were never anxious about her.'\n' Quite true,' I replied, ' but go directly ; there is no time to be lost ; go at\nonce.' On leaving the room she told Miss O., the landlady, what had\noccurred, and the reason of her going out, which she thought very un\nnecessary.\n' ' During her absence the terror which so unaccountably possessed me\nseemed to increase, and I feared that I should never see my child again\nalive. In about a quarter of an hour the servant returned with her safe and\nwell. Disappointed at having her walk so suddenly interrupted, A. asked\nif she must remain in the house the whole afternoon. I told her there\nwas no occasion for this, but she must give me her promise that she would\nnot go to the place she intended when I sent for her ; she might go\n\fMab., 1897.] Cases. 47\nanywhere else ; she might go to her uncle, Major S , and remain with his\ngrandchildren in his garden. She will be safe, I thought, between the four\nstone walls ; for though she had returned safe, I dixtinctly felt that there was\nstill danger in the place from which I had recalled her, whatever that danger\nmight be, and my object was to prevent her returning there. No sooner\nhad she quitted the house than all anxiety on her account passed away. I\nthought no more about it, nor reflected on what might have been a foolish\npanic ; it vanished from my mind like a dream, and if you had not\nmentioned this terrible accident, I dare say I should never have told you\nabout it or thought about it myself any more.\"\nShortly after A. came into the room, and Dr. W. asked her where\nshe was going when the servant overtook her and brought her back.\nShe said she was going through the railway garden to sit on the great stones\nby the seaside, to hear the trains pass by. ' ' I was two hours there with my\nbrother last Sunday, and we heard the trains go up and down ; they made\nsuch a noise as they passed over the arch ! \" Now it was on that very spot\nthe engine and tender fell when they ran off the line, breaking through the\nprotecting wall, and crashing down on those very stones where she was\naccustomed to sit, and killing three men out of the five that were on them.*\nShortly afterwards A. accompanied by her brother (aged thirteen), visited\nthe scene of the accident, and, making their way through a little crowd\ngathered round it, they saw the shattered engine lying on the spot to which\nshe had been going, and where she had spent some time with him the\nSunday before.\nAfterwards, on reviewing all the circumstances, I thought I could\nperceive very distinctly the reason why I had been compelled to act with\nsuch urgent haste, which did not appear on first thoughts to have been\nnecessary, as the accident did not occur for some time later ; for if even a\nlittle delay had taken place, the child would have passed out of the walk and\nwould have gained her favourite seat by the sea, where she would have been\ncompletely hidden from any one looking for her in the walk itself, and the\nservant would have returned without her. Again, if I had not so strictly\nprohibited her from returning to the same place, she certainly would have\ndone so (as she herself acknowledged), for it possessed much greater\nattractions for her than any other, and she consequently would have been on\nthe stones when the train passed from Granton.\nThe landlady with whom the writer was staying at the time\ncorroborates her account as follows :\u2014\nMarch 26th, 1878.\nMadam, \u2014In answer to your inquiries, I beg to say I remember your\nbeing with me twico when I lived at Trinity\u2014once was in July, 1860. I\n* A few days after the above incident, I wrote a little account of it to a lady, and\nbefore sending this to the press, I forwarded it to her to know if it corresponded to\nmy first statement. In reply, she said that the only difference there was between\nthe two accounts was that in the former I did not mention where A. went after\nshe returned from the railway garden.\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

When I heard about the accident that happened on the\nrailway, I had told Miss she had had a providential escape, for she\ncertainly would have been killed if she had been sitting on the big stones\nshe had intended to ; and I advised her not to go near the railway again. \u2014\nYours respectfully,\n(Signed in full) B.

I was about ten years old at\nthe time, but remember it all as if it only happened yesterday.\nThe person whom my father called on, and who confirmed from her own\nmemory the truth of the story, was the landlady of our Trinity lodgings.\nI do not know if she is alive now or not, probably not. My brother G.,\nwhom I think you know, went with me to see why the people were\nall running towards Granton, and we both saw the engine and tender lying\nby the sea. Our names were altered in the pamphlet, as my father\ndid not wish it made public that the incident had happened in his own\nfamily, though a good many friends and relations knew about it.

These states\nare most interesting and important subjects for psychical investigation.\nThat loss of nerve equilibrium combined with the various and peculiar\nphenomena found in hysterical subjects is well known to most people\nand especially to physicians ; the rarer manifestation of Genius is\nequally interesting and even more deserving of scientific investigation\nand elucidation. In the absence of our President I have been\nunexpectedly asked to occupy the chair. Mr. Myers has not given\nme any hint as to how he proposes to deal with these subjects, and\ntherefore I cannot say anything in anticipation of his paper, but from\n\fApis., 1K97.] General Meeting. 51\nhis extensive and precise knowledge of psychology, I am certain that\nhis inquiry into the nature of these states will be characterised by\nhis usual lucidity and ability.\"\nMr. F. W. H. Myers delivered an address on \" Hysteria and\nGenius,\" of which the following is a brief summary. [It is intended\nthat the address shall be concluded on April 23rd, at 4 p.m.]\nMy apology for addressing you, although a layman, on the subject\nof hysteria lies not only in the fact that of late years it is from the\npsychological side that the cure of hysteria has been by far the most\nsuccessfully approached, but also in my own obligation to certain\nrecent researches which have corroborated and completed in a welcome\nmanner that general theory of the relations between supraliminal and\nsubliminal strata of consciousness which already seemed to me to hold\ngood in almost all those abnormal or supernormal states which enable\nus in some degree to analyse the elements of man's personality.\nLet us consider what kind of material the student of human\npersonality must desire to have before him, if he would predict the\nnext few steps of man's evolution from the many steps which man has\ntraversed in the past. He would desire to trace out the mental\ndevelopment of race and individual,\u2014from the amoeba and from the\nembryo. To help in understanding this, he would desire also to trace\nall dissolutive processes to which man is subject ;\u2014down to mania,\ndementia, death. For he will justly argue that if we can trace a road\nby which man has gone down hill, we may be tracing a road by which\nman can also climb up. Processes of disintegration are lessons in\nintegration.\nA small fraction only of all this desirable knowledge has yet been\nacquired by science. Only of a still much smaller fraction can I make\nuse for my own ' special lines of forward-looking observation and\nhypothesis. To what is known of human phylogeny and ontogeny I\ncan, of course, only refer in a general way. Nor, on the other hand,\ncan I penetrate to the lowest depths of human retrogression. The\npsychology of insanity is as yet in a very early stage. Its difficulties\nare greatly enhanced by the wide-spreading and miscellaneous\ncharacter of the disturbances which actual lesions of the brain may\nset up. In some insanities recent observation has plausibly suggested\nthat \" a pathological process has loosened the firmly connected system\nof associations, so that a large number of those originally there have\nbecome impossible, and a disintegration of the personality results.\"\nBut, as a rule, these morbid processes in insanity have gone too far\nfor our present power of analysis. Somewhat similarly, from the\nphenomena of epilepsy, Hughlings Jackson has deduced the notion of\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1897.\nbrain-centres representing three levels of evolution, the highest of\nwhich is exhausted by the epileptic discharge, leaving lower centres,\nwhich are generally subject to the inhibition of the highest centres,\nto function in profitless disorder. But here also we can hardly\nparticularise this broad conception, which concerns rather the general\ngovernment of the body's motion than the interrelation of definite\nsensations and ideas. When, on the other hand, we rise from these\nlower deeps to the comparatively shallow disturbances of the psychical\nocean to which the vague and meaningless title of hysteria is commonly\ngiven, we begin to be able to trace in some detail the upward and\ndownward currents ;\u2014those emergences of subliminal, submergences of\nsupraliminal faculty, which thereafter continue, as I hold, to be\ntraceable throughout the whole range of abnormal and supernormal\nmodifications of personality.\nNow at first sight it is by no means easy to give any rational\ninterpretation whatever to certain hysterical symptoms ;\u2014still less to\nintroduce them into any continued series of psychological phenomena.\nThe witch's anaesthetic spot, for instance, seems at first a mere oddity.\nThe hysteric's retrenchment of the visual field seems a definite optical\ndisease. Neither of these anomalies has any clear connection with\nfixed ideas, or with interchangeable strata of personality. Yet Dr.\nPierre Janet and M. Binet, in France, and Drs. Breuer and Freud, in\nVienna (with others whom I need not mention here), have shown by\npatient and penetrating observation, that there is veritably such a\nconnection; and that hysterical lesions maybe all of them \u2014in their\ninception at any rate\u2014essentially intellectual lesions, depending, that\nis to say, upon those delicate cortical changes which correspond to\nideas, rather than on any grosser cerebral injury.\nIn the first place Dr. Janet has worked out his view of the misere\npsychologique of the hysteric. The maintenance of a normal personality\nrequires something of concentrative force, \u2014some form of nervous\nenergy expended in maintaining the unity of mental action. In mania\nthis concentrated energy is almost wholly in default. We see ideational\ncentres functioning wildly, unguided and uninhibited, much as we see\nmotor centres functioning wildly in epilepsy ;\u2014centres which even in\nmania were still largely under control. In various forms of \"paranoia\"\nor \" delusional insanity,\" again, there is a loosening of associative and\nconcentrative bonds. The mental energy strays along random tracks,\nfrom which perhaps it can only be recalled by a central effort of\nattention for a few minutes at a time.\nBetween states of this kind and ordinary sanity there are many\ngradations. In no man, indeed, is the central power sufficient to keep\n\fApr., 1897.] General Meeting. 53\nthe course of thought steady as respiration or circulation is kept steady.\nWith most men, for instance, hunger and fatigue temporarily impair\nmemory. Now the typical hysteric,\u2014the hysteric of the Salpetriere,\u2014\nis permanently in a state of insufficient central control. She gradually\nlets slip from her grasp one element after another of faculty really\nnecessary for the proper conduct of life. Observe then that from the\nfirst this selection is in some sense an intellectual selection. It is not\nthe case with the hysteric, as it often is, for instance, with the aphasic,\nthat definite disease invades definite cerebral areas. Rather, the\nhysteric can keep what she most wishes to keep ; she lets go what she\nthinks and cares less about. This kind of selection is seen in an\nextreme form when, for instance, the hysteric can recognise by touch\nnothing but her own rings, combs, and fringe of hair. Observe,\nmoreover, that the sense of pain is one of the forms of faculty most\noften dropped. This is in the first place a valuable indication of the\ncomparative facility with which that sense is dissociable from physical\ninjury ;\u2014a facility of which hypnotism of course avails itself. Again,\nthis analgesia is probably all the commoner because the hysteric makes\nno conscious effort to retain the sense of pain. She is willing to let\nthat go ;\u2014as we should all desire to do if no serious risk were involved\nin the loss of that warning of incipient injury. And in the analgesia\nof the hysteric in fact (this is an ingenious observation of Dr.\nJanet's), very little risk is involved. Patients suffering from analgesia\ncaused by actual nervous decay (as in syringo-myelitis) frequently\nburn or otherwise injure themselves. Hysterics hardly ever do so.\nThe truth is that with the hysteric the sensibility to pain is not\nabsolutely abolished. Something at least persists subliminally which\nis not indeed recognisable as pain, but which continues to supply that\nspecial warning which (as the case of the syringo-myelitic patient\nshows us) mere general subconscious attention is not able to supply.\nThat this is so in fact,\u2014that there does persist a subliminal percep\ntion of even small stimuli,\u2014is shown in a quite different way by\nthe elegant experiments of Binet and others, where the analgesic\nhysteric having been, say, pricked seven times with a pin out of her\nsight is then told to think of a number,\u2014and thinks of seven ; or\nto draw a group of lines, and draws seven lines ;\u2014or spontaneously\nhas a hallucination of seven black points. That which would have\nbeen perceived by a healthy supraliminal personality as pain, is\nnow ignored by that personality, is perceived by the subliminal\npersonality in some manner not clearly definable, and is com\nmunicated again to the supraliminal personality in a transmuted or\nsymbolical form.\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Am., 1897.\nHere we are at the starting point both of fixed ideas and of the\ninspirations of genius. Genius, as I shall maintain later on, consists\nlargely in subliminal uprushes which express symbolically the result of\nobservation and inference of which the supraliminal self is not aware.\nRaphael, giving a tinge of unearthly beauty to the Madonna's eyes, is\nutilising the same subliminal and symbolical transmutation of experience\nwhich led the hysteric to draw seven points for the seven pin-pricks.\nBut while that unnoted experience of Raphael's might be called\nimpalpable\u2014was something too delicate for deliberate formulation\u2014\nthe hysteric's unnoted experience was not impalpable, but merely\nmorbidly unfelt. The difference is an important one. Plainly indeed\nit is not likely that we should learn much of value from a mere indirect\nreproduction of impressions which we ought to have received direct.\nWhen an element properly supraliminal is submerged, it is apt to\nbecome also isolated ; it turns into a positive or a negative idde fixe.\nThis last phrase needs some explanation. The name of \"fixed idea \"is\ncommonly given to an idea which is not only unmodifiable but intru\nsive ; which forces itself on supraliminal attention, although it is not\namenable to supraliminal control. I think, however, that the term\nmay instructively be extended to negative cases ;\u2014to idees fixes of\ndefect ;\u2014to hysterical disabilities of every kind. If the disability is,\nsay, mutism or \" astasie-abasie,\"\u2014inability to speak, or to stand and\nwalk,\u2014one sees at once that here an idea is at work. The inability to\nwalk does not depend on a lesion of nerves innervating special muscles ;\nfor those very muscles can be used perfectly well in other ways. It\ndepends upon the loss of an acquired synergy, a complex muscular\nprocess, which the mind comprises under a single conception, \" the act\nof walking,\" and which has now dropped, as a whole, out of supraliminal\nreach. That is plainly a negative idee fixe. But the same explanation\nmust, I think, be extended to hysterical losses of function of a kind\nmuch less clearly suggestive of what we should call an idea. Thus the\nplaques or zones of anaesthesia,\u2014the \" witch-marks \" of our ancestors\n\u2014are generally distributed on the persons of hysterics in what seems a\nrandom fashion. Unless where there is hemianesthesia, the arrangement\nof these patches seldom even seems to take account of true anatomical\nareas. As depicted by Charcot, Pitres, etc., the shading which indi\ncates anaesthetic tracts looks as if it had been put on fantastically by\na child in the nursery. My own impression is that this is in truth\nabout the nearest parallel. The \" anaesthetic bracelets \" and \" anaes\nthetic boots,\" patches of anaesthesia corresponding to the areas which a\nbracelet or a boot would cover, suggest to me irresistibly the fantastic\ndreamlike play of the subliminal self. Just so wayward and incoherent\n\fApr., 1897.] General Meeting. 55\nbeneath a childish attempt at coherency shall we often find the motor\nmessages of the subliminal self ;\u2014that automatic script which in nine\ncases out of ten is but nonsense, more or less plausible. Manifestations\nlike these are for the subliminal self, in my view, much what the\n\" middle-level \" incoherent movements of an epileptic fit are for the\nsupraliminal. I call, in short, an \"anaesthetic bracelet\" a negative\nidie fixe, and I consider that when the supraliminal centralisation\nbecame too weak to retain within control the sensitivity of the whole\nsurface of the body, some freakish dream of a lower stratum selected\njust this bracelet area as having a kind of intellectual unity, and drew\ndown its sensitivity into a subliminal and unreachable realm.\nWe have here, I should go on to say, the first hint of definite\nstigmata. Tumefied cruciform or other symmetrical marks are by no\nmeans always connected with profound meditation on Christian sym\nbols. In a recent case in America they occurred spontaneously in a\nwoman whom it was impossible to present as a type of meditation or\nof sanctity. In other cases they have followed hypnotic suggestion ;\nthus showing that the vis vesicalrix Naturae, if I may so term it,\u2014the\nsubliminal power of modifying secretion,\u2014-can respond to so merely\ngeometrical a notion as that of cruciformity.\nAll hysterical symptoms then, I say boldly, are equivalent to idies\nfixes; and a hysterical access is the explosion of an idee fixe. We speak\nof an epileptic fit as an explosive discharge of a certain tract of the\nbrain, \u2014largely motor, but showing in its \"intellectual aura\" certain\nrecurrent elements of thought or imagery inevitably involved in the\nexcessive excitation of that particular tract. Similarly, 1 should define\na \" fit of hysterics \" as an explosive discharge, on a smaller scale, of a\ntract of the brain delimited by its association with a particular set of\nconceptions which have become morbidly sensitive, and morbidly\nisolated from that general interchange and association of our ideas\namong themselves, which we may call our psychical circulation.\nNotions like these, suggested to me largely by Dr. Janet's experi\nments, find (as seems to me) a strange confirmation in the more recent\nStudien iiber Hystirie of Drs. Breuer and Freud. These physicians have\nhad to deal, most of all in Dr. Breuer's case of Anna O , with\nhysterics of much higher intellectual calibre than the patients of the\nSalpetriere.\nFraiilein O , as will be seen when her case is read in detail,\nbecame in hypnosis particularly acute in tracing her own subliminal\noperations. Suffering, as she did, from a number of distressing and even\ndangerous symptoms, she co-operated with eagerness and intelligence\nin her own cure. She was at last able to trace each one of her bizarre\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1897.\nbodily symptoms to some definite mental shock, received during a\nperiod of excessive strain, while she was nursing her father in his last\nillness. The results were like permanent nightmares founded on very\ntrifling facts,\u2014horrible exaggerations of moments of distress or fear.\nBut it was noticeable that this conversion or transformation of\npsychical shock into corporeal injury or disability occurred in the\nrealm both of the vaguer organic sensations (such as nausea or spasms),\nand also of definite sensory disturbances (macropsy, etc.), and most\nremarkably of all in the form of disturbances of speech.\nI repeat, then, that the collection of cases published by these\nphysicians under the title Studien uber Hysterie, seems to me to make\nit probable that all hysterical symptoms, without exception, have\ntheir origin in some localised and functional affection of the brain,\nof a type which the metaphors that I have been using set before us,\nperhaps, as plainly as is at present possible. This view again is\nstrengthened by the frequent occurrence in hysteria of acquisitions\n(and not only losses) of faculty. It is not unusual to find great\nhyperesthesia in certain special directions (tactile, auditory, perception\nof light, &c.), combined with hysterical loss of sensation of other kinds.\nBinet, for instance, has described certain cases in which the impress of\na coin upon the skin was perceived by an hysteric with many times\nthe distinctness with which it was perceivable by normal persons.\nSuch occasional quickenings of faculty were, in my view, pretty\ncertain to accompany the instability of psychical threshold which\nis the distinguishing characteristic of hysteria. These also are a\nkind of capricious idies fixes ; only the caprice in such cases raises\nwhat was submerged, instead of submerging what was previously\nemergent. This view, of course, assumes that the high sensibility, the\npotential hyperesthesia, exists already in latency in the subliminal\nself ; \u2014ready, as it were, to be tossed to the surface by a psychical\nstorm.\nThis, in fact, I hold ; and here is the point where hysteria comes\ninto relation with higher psychical conditions,\u2014genius among them.\nSuppose that in a case of instability of the psychical threshold ;\u2014ready\npermeability, if you will, of the psychical diaphragm separating the\nsupraliminal from the subliminal self,\u2014the elements of emergence tend\nto increase and the elements of submergence to diminish. Suppose\nthat it comes to be the case that the permeability depends upon the\nforce of the uprushes from below the diaphragm rather than on the\ntendency to sink downwards from above it. We shall then reach the\npoint where the vague name of hysteria must give place to the vague\nname of genius. The uprushes from the subliminal self will now be the\n\fApr., 1897.] General Meeting. 57\nimportant feature ; the downdraught from the supraliminal will be\ntrivial in comparison. Newton might forget whether he had eaten his\ndinner or not ; but the loss of alert attention to bodily needs was more\nthan compensated for by the presentation to him by \"intuition,\"\n\"geometrical instinct,\" or whatever we call it, of conceptions which\nmere deliberate voluntary work might corroborate but could not\nhave suggested.\nIn Newton's case the uprush came in waking hours, and its content\nwas wholly congruous with his voluntary lines of thought ; so much so\nthat the distinction between inspiration and labour may by some\npersons here be thought fanciful. But pass now to another manifes\ntation of genius. Consider the dreams which supplied Robert Louis\nStevenson with plots for some of his stories. Here, too, the content of\nthe uprush was congruous with the train of voluntary thought ;\ncongruous, but not so completely congruous as in Newton's case, since\nthe dream-stories had often a fantastic character which unfitted them\nfor publication. Stevenson is here midway between Newton and the\nsomnambulist, between the mathematician who finds solutions in a\ntrance of thought, and the mathematician who finds the solution\nwritten out by his bedside when he wakes in the morning. Somnam\nbulism or sleep-waking, again, is a title which includes various states\nwith many analogies. A subliminal uprush during sleep may, as in\nStevenson's case, seem merely a nocturnal prolongation of the diurnal\noperation of genius. That is to say it may subserve, with more or less\nrationality, the work of waking day ; whether it be the work of the\nromancer composing tales or the work of the servant girl washing\ndishes. But often also sleep-waking achievements run on lines of\ntheir own, not helping the work of waking day, nor showing any great\ncommunity of memory with waking hours. Sleep-waking is then a\nbranch of what I have called sensory and motor automatism ; that is to\nsay, subliminal uprushes which do not commingle with the stream of\nsupraliminal life (like fresh water springs under the sea) but throw up\ntheir products separately and distinguishably among waking ideas and\nemotions (like lava from a volcano). Such a definition as this, as will\nat once be seen, includes many distinctly hysterical phenomena. All\nthese classes are in fact interwoven, each title denoting only the\nprevalent quality of the subliminal uprush in each given case. Where\nthe uprush is morbid and the downdraught disabling, we call the con\ndition hysteria. Where the uprush is helpful and the downdraught\ninsignificant we call the condition genius. Where the uprush is\nnocturnal, the downdraught here being represented by the abeyance of\nsupraliminal faculty in sleep, we call the condition somnambulism.\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1897.\nWhere the uprush is not morbid, but yet not confluent nor congruous\nwith supraliminal operations, we call the condition automatism.\nFinally, we arrive at another division not based on precisely the\nsame logical lines. The various conditions which I have been\ndescribing are spontaneous conditions,\u2014for good or evil. But it has\nbeen discovered that many of them are imitable or reproducible by\nempirical artifice. Using a word equally vague with the words\nhysteria, genius, somnambulism, or automatism, we class these artifices\nand their results together and call them hypnotism. In hypnotism\nwe have come round to an operation almost exactly the reverse of\nhysteria, although depending upon the same psychical mechanism.\nIn hysteria useful elements of personality spontaneously sank into\nsubmergence, and noxious elements spontaneously emerged from\nlatency. In hypnotism we artificially submerge noxious elements and\nwe elicit from latency elements which subserve our ends. Each\ncondition in turn illustrates the same psychical structure ; nor, I\nthink, can any one of them be understood without careful study of\nthe rest.\nDr. Wallace, in inviting questions or discussion, thanked Mr.\nMyers for his most interesting paper. Any one acquainted with the\nordinary medical text-book literature as to the nature of hysteria\nknows that there exists a great difficulty in explaining the varied\nnervous phenomena, but the psychological generalisation made by Mr.\nMyers forms a basis for grouping these and explaining their treatment\nby hypnotic suggestion. He regretted that the audience did not\ncontain more members of the medical profession.\nDr. Bramwell, in reference to the supposed connection between\ndegeneration and genius, said two points raised by Mr. Myers appeared\nto be specially worthy of notice.\nFirst, the failings of the man of genius were certain to attract\nattention, while those of more obscure individuals were apt to escape\nnotice. From personal experience, Dr. Bramwell was inclined to think\nthat stimulants were more frequently taken in excess amongst the stolid\nand unimaginative than amongst the highly nervous. The two classes,\nmoreover, took them for different reasons. The first usually to procure\nexcitement, the second for the purpose of dulling mental pain.\nSecondly, it was natural that a being with a highly developed\nnervous system should be more prone to mental disturbances than the\nstupid and lymphatic, but that in itself did not prove degeneracy.\nFurther, the genius had more demands made upon his strength than\nother men, and like the race-horse, would run till he dropped. The\nlower animal, however, the nervous example of his class, was kept for\n\fApr., 1897.] Br. Bramwell on Hypnotism. 59\nracing purposes alone, and was not compelled to drag the plough at\nother times. The man of genius, on the other hand, in addition to\ndoing the work most suited to him, had frequently also to painfully\nand laboriously earn the daily bread. The same amount of care\nwas rarely bestowed on men and women as upon valuable lower\nanimals.\nDR. BRAMWELL ON HYPNOTISM.\nThe most important contribution to the current number of Brain\n(Part IV., 1896) is an article on \"The Evolution of Hypnotic Theory\"\nby Dr. J. Milne Bramwell. The greater part of this article is\nreprinted from Dr. Bramwell's papers on Hypnotism which have\nrecently appeared in our Proceedings ; but the question of the use of\nhypnotism in therapeutic practice is treated somewhat more fully and\nthe attacks that have been made on it from time to time are examined\nin detail, from the point of view of the physiologists and medical men\nto whom the periodical is addressed. \"We give here an account of\nsome of the new matter in. the paper. Dr. Bramwell writes :\u2014\nAccording to Professor Benedikt, of Vienna, the majority of the\nresults attributed to hypnotic suggestion are fallacious, the patient simply\ndeceiving the physician. As to the alleged cures of alcoholism, he asks,\nwhere are these cases? There can be no possible doubt, he says, that\nthe medical men who reported them are to-day aware of their error. Why\nare they silent ? The true explanation of the supposed cures is simply to\nbe found in the fact that the patients want to be left alone, and therefore\nsay they are cured. Amongst so-called successful cases at least 90 per cent,\nmust be eliminated for this reason.\nThis opinion is entirely opposed to facts. Those who formerly reported\ncases of hypnotic cure continue to do so, while many others have joined\ntheir ranks. The following, amongst others, may be quoted as having\nrecently testified to the therapeutic value of hypnotic treatment : van Eeden,\nvan Renterghem, Forel, Freud, Gerster, Grossmann, de Jong, Scholz, von\nSchrenck-Notzing, Tatzel, Wetterstrand, Brunnberg, Hecker, Kraffib-Ebing,\nRingier, Bergmann, Brugelmann, Pulda, Herzberg, Hirt, Schmidt, Vogt,\nSchmeltz, Lemoine, Joire, Voisin, de Mdzeray, BeVillon, Bernheim,\nLidbeault, Dumontpallier, Gorodichze, Bonjour, Desplats, Bourdon,\nTissit, &c.\nBenedikt would like to know what has become of the dipsomaniacs\nsaid to have been cured by hypnotism. As regards my own cases, I can\ngive a very satisfactory reply. Some are actively engaged in business, or in\nsuccessfully conducting medical practice ; one has since been elected a\nMember of Parliament, while others are happy wives and mothers. In\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Afb., isU7.\nmost of them the disease had been of long duration, varying from about\nfive to fifteen years ; and in some presented all its worst symptoms ; for\nexample, the patient who is now a Member of Parliament had formerly\nseveral attacks of delirium tremens and epilepsy. The duration of the cure\nhas lasted from two to over six years.\nBenedikt's suggestion that dipsomaniacs pretend to be cured in order to\nbe left alone is amusing. Drunkards sometimes secretly obtain drink in\ningenious ways, but I never heard of one being able successfully to pretend\nthat he was sober when dead drunk, or in good health when suffering from\ndelirium tremens.\nIn the \" Zeitschrift fiir Hypnotismus, \" part 1, 1896, Wetterstrand\nreported 38 cases of morphinism treated by hypnotic suggestion. Of these\n28 were cured, 3 relapsed, and in 7 no result was obtained. In each\ninstance, the morphia had been injected subcutaneously. Many of the\ncases were exceedingly grave and of long standing, and some were com\nplicated with the cocaine and alcohol habit. With several the abstinenoe\ntreatment had been tried without success\u2014sometimes more than once.\nOne of the successful cases\u2014a medical man\u2014had taken morphia for\neighteen years, and during the last four years cocaine also. Another\nmedical man, Dr. Landgren, recorded his own case in the same journal.\nOver five years have elapsed since he was successfully treated by\nWetterstrand. Other methods, including residence in a retreat, &c, had\nfailed.\nI do not for a moment pretend that by hypnotism one can cure every\nthing and everybody, and agree with Braid in thinking that he who talks of\na universal remedy is either a knave or a fool. On the other hand, I have\nseen many cases of functional nervous disorder cured or relieved by\nhypnotism, which had previously resisted long, careful and varied medical\ntreatment. For example, I recently reported eight cases of \" Imperative\nIdeas,\" in which hypnotic suggestion had been successfully employed, the\nfirst dating from 1889, the last from 1894. Of these one afterwards died of\ninfluenza, but the others remain well. In some instances the original\nmental trouble had been a grave one, and the patients had suffered from\ndelusions and hallucinations.\nIn support of his own conviction that the subject's will is\nnot under the control of the operator, Dr. Bramwell quotes the\nobservations and opinions of Professor Beaunis, Dr. Crocq, Richer,\nGilles de la Tourette, Brouardel, Pitres, and Dr. de Jong, on the power\npossessed by the subject of resistance to suggestion. Delbceuf also\nfound that one of his subjects, an excellent somnambule, despite his\nreiterated and emphatic commands, absolutely refused when hypnotised\nto fire a revolver\u2014which she had been accustomed to use, but which\nin this case was, of course, unloaded\u2014at two supposed robbers. Dr.\nCharpignon again is of opinion that it is much easier to restore moral\nrectitude, by means of hypnotic suggestion, to a somnambule who\n\fApr., 1897.] Dr. Bramwell on Hypnotism. 61\nhas lost it, than to pervert, by the same means, a person of high\nmoral character.\nWith regard to hypnotic control over intimate organic processes,\nthe views of Delboeuf are given. He thinks that suggestion is not only\ncapable of inhibiting sensations of pain intimately associated with\norganic injury, and of modifying or arresting various morbid nervous\nconditions which arise more or less directly from it; but that it can also\ninfluence the organic changes which, under ordinary circumstances,\nwould have resulted from the injury. Thus, when pain is removed or\nrelieved, this really means the disappearance or decrease of one of the\nfactors in an organic malady. Delboeuf reported numerous cases of\naccidents in which, the pain resulting from the wound having been\nremoved by suggestion, the healing process took place with unusual\nrapidity. Further to test the influence of suggestion in this direction,\nhe tried an experiment on the subject already referred to, having\npreviously obtained her consent to it. \"With a red-hot iron, 8 m.m.\nin diameter, he produced two small burns resembling one another as\nclosely as possible, one on each of her arms,\u2014at the same time\nsuggesting that she should feel pain in the left arm alone. The\nsuggestion taking effect, he found next morning that the right arm\npresented a definite eschar, the exact size of the iron, and without\ninflammation or redness ; on the left was a wound of about 3 c.m. in\ndiameter with inflamed blisters. Next day the left arm was much\nworse, and she complained of acute pain. This was removed by\nsuggestion, and the wound then rapidly healed.\nDelboeuf's conception of the method of action in these cases is very\nsimilar to that of Mr. Myers. The action of the organs concerned can\nnot, as we know, be modified directly by the will, though it is probable\nthat in the lower animals both consciousness and will are involved in\nthem. With the progress of development, however, we may suppose\nthat the attention of the animal becomes directed more or less\nexclusively (1) to the organs which place it in direct relationship to the\nexternal world and warn it of events of importance to its existence or\nwell-being, and (2) to the means of attack or defence which it learns to\nuse from day to day with greater certainty and vigour. At the same\ntime, the cares of the interior are got rid of more and more completely,\nand are confided to a servant who has been trained to look after them,\nand whose zeal can be depended upon. In a highly developed animal,\nsuch as man, the mechanical regularity with which internal organs\nact renders conscious attention regarding them unnecessary. Some\ntimes, however, the machine goes wrong, while the power which used\nvoluntarily to regulate it has dropped out of the normal consciousness.\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Ape., 1897.\nTo find a substitute for it, we must turn to hypnotism, whereby the long\nlost control over the internal mechanism of the body is regained.\nOn the relation of suggestion in the normal condition to hypnotic\nsuggestion, Dr. Bramwell quotes Mr. Ernest Hart's comparison of\nalleged cures by hypnotism with the Lourdes cures ; Mr. Hart says,\n\" So far as I can see, the balance is in favour of the faith-curer of the\nchapel and the grotto. The results at least are proportionately as\nnumerous, and they are more rapid.\" Dr. Bramwell asks on what\nstatistics this statement is founded, remarking that while hypnotic\ncases are recorded in the same manner as ordinary medical ones, many\nof the alleged cures at Lourdes are rendered valueless as evidence by\nthe fact that no medical examination of the patient had been made\nimmediately before and after the reputed miracle, nor is there any list\nof the number treated. He lays stress on the points of contrast\nbetween suggestions associated with emotional states and suggestion in\nhypnosis, and shows that since the potent results of the former often\ndepend on a combination of faith and ignorance,\u2014e.g., on a superstitious\nbelief in charms or in quack remedies of various kinds,\u2014advancing\nknowledge is ever likely to rob them of their powers. On the other\nhand, hypnotic suggestion does not run a similar risk, being founded\non science and not on superstition.\nSome further space is devoted to a critical examination of Mr.\nHart's views, and Dr. Bramwell observes that the various mesmeric\nfallacies combatted in the British Medical Journal have often been\nrefuted, and have long ceased to claim the attention of scientific men,\nwhile this periodical omits to give any account of the physiological,\npsychological and therapeutical observations on hypnotism which\nhave been so largely recorded by many distinguished Continental\nscientists.\nTowards the end of his paper, Dr. Bramwell enters on an eloquent\nand weighty defence of the work of our Society. \"An attempt has\nbeen made,\" he says, \" to discredit hypnotism on account of its connec\ntion with the Society for Psychical Research. Mr. Hart, for example,\nclasses together ' spiritists, the stage hypnotist, the living magnets, the\nMahatmas, the belated Psychical Researchers, and the ghost-seers.\nBut they are only the stunted remnants, the vestigial and atrophied\ntraces indicating the latter stages of ages of development, in which we\nhave outgrown the period when such follies and fallacies were the\nalmost universal heritage of mankind.' If the members of the Society\nwould only employ the ' control tests ' which he had invented, it would\nbe doubtful whether they would find material sufficiently diverting to\nenable the Society to exist.\"\n\fApb., 1897.] Dr. Bramwell on Hypnotism. 63\n\" The Society for Psychical Research,\" says Dr. Bramwell, \" was\nestablished for the purpose of investigating those obscure phenomena\nwhich alone, amongst all other natural phenomena, had remained\nuninvestigated by modern science.\" Membership of the Society does\nnot imply the acceptance of any particular explanation of the\nphenomena investigated, and as a matter of fact, one of the most\nimportant branches of its work has been the exposure of the frauds\nof professional mediums. As examples of this, he cites :\u2014\n(1) An investigation by William Crookes, Victor Horsley, and the late\nDr. A. T. Myers of an alleged supernatural phenomenon, to which\nspiritualists attached great importance and the investigators none at all.\n[See Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 460.] (2) The complete destruction\nby Dr. Hodgson of the Theosophical claim to miraculous powers and to\nthe existence of Mahatmas. (3) A series of experiments contrived to\nillustrate the \"Possibilities of Malobservation and Lapse of Memory.\"\nThese practically refuted the assertion that certain phenomena must be\ndue to spirits, because they could not have been produced by mortals.\nMr. S. J. Davey, a member of the Society, since deceased, gave several\nyears to the assiduous practice of certain tricks of sleight-of-hand ; these\nhe so successfully supplemented by ingenious psychological artifices as\nto render thein inexplicable. It would be difficult to find any piece of\nlaboratory work on attention comparable in subtlety and skill with Mr.\nDavey's demonstrations ; while, if we wish to protect ourselves and our\nfellow-creatures against fraud and imposture, this kind of reply is more\neffective (although more difficult to obtain) than any vague vituperation\ncan be.\nWhen we recognise that the Society has raised \"control experiments\"\nto the level of a fine art, the futility of Mr. Hart's suggestion as to his\ncontrol tests is obvious.\nThe explanation of my connection with the Society is a simple and\nnatural one. Shortly after I commenced hypnotic work, the late Dr. A. T.\nMyers drew my attention to the fact that certain members of the Society\nwere engaged in similar researches ; and I found in articles\u2014such as \" The\nProblems of Hypnotism\" and \"The Subliminal Consciousness,\" by the\nlate Edmund Gurney and F. W. H. Myers\u2014the only attempt, with which I\nwas acquainted, as far as this country was concerned, to find a scientific\nexplanation of the phenomena of hypnotism.\nPersonally I neither believe in, nor have investigated, spiritists, ghosts,\nor Mahatmas ; but the latter fact renders my opinions regarding them\nvalueless. Mr. Hart's criticisms raise a further question : Do scientific\nmen necessarily identify themselves with, or believe in, all they investigate ?\nThis assumption is surely unjustifiable ; and to confuse Psychical Researchers\nwith Mahatmas\u2014the judge on the bench, so to say, with the convicted\ncriminal in the dock\u2014shows want of discrimination.\nAnother question remains : Should the scientific examination of obscure\nand possibly fraudulent phenomena be condemned ? According to Mr.\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1897.\nHart: \"With so many serious problems awaiting solution, it is not only\ndeplorable, but in the highest degree discreditable, that minds made for\nbetter things should waste their powers in dabbling with what is simply a\ndespicable and degrading imposture.\" Now, not only do we owe Braid's\ndiscovery of the subjective origin of hypnotic phenomena to the investigation\nof mesmerism, which he had previously regarded as imposture or self-\ndeception, but science in general has been evolved from the errors and\nsuperstitions which preceded its birth. Further, as Dr. Wilks tells us :\n\" Medicine began as a superstition, covered and surmounted by fancies and\ncrude theories. By getting rid of these advance has been made, but the fact\nis not yet sufficiently realised that many of the old fancies still remain in the\nprofession.\"\nWould it be advisable to place the psychologist, like the physiologist,\nunder Government control ? Should investigators be compelled to restrict\nthemselves to certain approved subjects, and be refused permission to walk\nin any of the by-paths of science, lest they should be accosted by some\nunrecognised question which solicited investigation ? Surely freedom to\ninvestigate what one likes, when one likes, and where one likes, is not an\nunworthy ideal, though possibly it may be difficult of attainment.\nNOTE ON \"AN EXPOSURE.\"\nIn an article in the last number of the Journal, headed \" An Exposure,\"\nwe gave an account of an investigation by Mr. E. T. Nisbet of a supposed\ncase of spiritualistic communications through the ticking of a clock, the\nprincipal medium in the case being a miner, whom we called G. Mr. Nisbet's\nstatement that Mr. L. (through whose introduction he obtained the loan of\nthe clock for investigation) \" is now quite disillusioned about G.\" might\nlead to the impression that Mr. L. has given up the whole story. This is not\nthe case. Mr. L. appears to be quite disillusioned about the miner ; but\nhe still clings to the story, relying on the evidence of the miner's wife. As\nto the miner, he says :\u2014\" He has been often charged with fraud and con\ndemned as untruthful ; I have myself proved him unreliable, and have the\nmost positive assurance needful that when he has given some seances for\nmaterialisation, he has provided himself with white raiment to simulate\nspirit drapeiy. I [possess] a piece off that which he assumed at one seance,\nwhere he was grabbed ; and with a piece of this fabric there was also cut\naway a piece of his body underclothing.\"\nWe need hardly add that if we had known these facts, we should not\nhave thought it worth while to trouble Mr. Nisbet to undertake the\ninvestigation.\n\fNo. CXXXIX.\u2014Vol. VIII.

There were also present, Professor\nW. F. Barrett, Professor H. Sidgwick, Dr. Abraham Wallace, Mr.\nF. W. H. Myers, and Mr. Sydney C. Scott.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nThree new Members and six new Associates, whose names and\naddresses are given above, were elected. The election of seven new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded.\nIt was resolved that the General Meeting on May 28th should be\nheld in the afternoon instead of in the evening as previously arranged,\nthe chair to be taken at 4 p.m.\nSeveral other matters having been disposed of, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council should be at the Westminster Town\nHall, at 3 p.m., on Friday, May 28th, previous to the General\nMeeting at 4 p.m. on that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 86th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall, on Friday, April 23rd, at 4 p.m. ; the President,\nMr. W. Crookes, in the chair.\nProfessor Sidgwick read a paper entitled \" A Contribution to the\nStudy of Hysteria and Hypnosis,\" by Dr. Morton Prince, Instructor\nin Nervous Diseases at the Harvard Medical School, U.S.A. The\nwriter remarked that one of the greatest obstacles to finding a satis\nfactory explanation of hysterical and hypnotic phenomena has been the\ntacit assumption that the psychical and physical conditions involved in\neach case are always the same, whereas the phenomena are actually so\ncomplex and various that no universal law governing all of them can\nas yet be laid down. Hysteria may depend, for example, in part on\nthe contraction of the field of consciousness, or on conscious or sub\nconscious fixed ideas, in part on the lack of cerebral inhibition, in part\non self suggestion or external suggestion, etc. Consequently the\nphysiological processes and cerebral areas involved are probably\ndifferent in different cases, and the theory here advanced, which\nsupposes a localised \" going to sleep \" of some of the highest brain\ncentres, is not intended to cover all forms of hysteria or hypnosis,\nthough it applies to what is probably the most frequent kind of case,\nviz., the automatic condition to which the hypnotised subject is\ngenerally reduced.\n\fMay, isu7 ] General Meeting. 67\nThe observations on which the theory was founded were made\nseveral years ago, before the publication of the work of various French\npsychologists\u2014 especially of Janet\u2014which has recently thrown so much\nlight on the subject of hysteria. The writer's experiments, made thus\nindependently, confirm in a striking manner many of Janet's results.\nThe experiments described referred to cases of hysterical anaesthesia\nand paralysis, and they showed that the brain of the hysterics reacted\nto external impressions, notwithstanding the apparent anaesthesia ; in\nother words, that a hysteric who has lost the perception of sensation,\nreally does feel or see or hear, though he is not conscious of doing so.\nThe first case, Mrs. B., was one of traumatic hysteria and neuritis.\nIn consequence of an accident, in which her left shoulder was injured,\nthe patient developed a number of mental symptoms, and for two years\nsuffered from severe pain in her left shoulder and arm, which she was\npractically unable to use. Examination showed that the inability was\nmerely hysterical. There was also slight anaesthesia over the inner side\nof the arm and hand, which, after 18 months, suddenly became so pro\nfound that the patient could not feel the most severe pinches and\npricks on a certain part of her hand. Under these circumstances,\nwithout giving her any hint of the experiments he intended to try, Dr\nMorton placed a screen between her face and her hand, and pricked\nand pinched the latter several times. She was quite unconscious that\nanything was being done to her hand, but on being hypnotised and\nquestioned, gave an accurate account of what had been done. The\nexperiment was repeated several times, always with the same result.\nIt was also found that during the hypnotic trance, sensation com\npletely returned in the previously anaesthetic hand. Later, the normal\nsensation was restored by means of hypnotic suggestion.\nThe second case\u2014that of Mrs. R. \u2014was of hemi-anaesthesia,\u2014\nsensation being impaired all over the right half of the body, especially\nin the arm, and entirely absent in the hand. She could finger and\nhandle objects, but not feel them. A bracelet-like line limited the\nabsolute anaesthesia of the hand at the wrist joint. Right hemianopsia\nwas also present with other optic troubles, and hearing, smell and taste\nwere diminished on the right side. There was no paralysis. When this\npatient was hypnotised, sensation was at once completely restored, and\nshe was able to tell at once what objects were placed in her hand. All\nher senses were restored to a normal condition, except that of sight ;\nshe was still unable to see out of the right half of each eye. When\nawakened, the previous condition at once returned.\nExperiments similar to those performed on Mrs. B. were carried\nout with Mrs. R. Various stimuli having been applied without her\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1897.\nknowledge to the anaesthetic hand, she was able, on being hypnotised,\nto tell accurately what had been done to it. This showed that in her\ncase also sensation was really present in her ordinary condition, though\nshe was not conscious of it at the time, the anaesthesia being merely\nfunctional. Thus it is seen that in hysterical anaesthesia of this sort,\nthe sensory cortical centres receive and record external impressions in\na perfectly healthy way. Another proof of this was that Mrs. R. could\nfinger and turn over in her hand any object placed in it, though\nunconscious of the nature of the object. Unless the hand felt the\nobject, it would be impossible to use the hand thus.\nThe writer explains his observations on the basis of Hughlings\nJackson's theory that three different levels of evolution are represented\nin the central nervous system, the most automatic and least complex\nnervous arrangements being found at the lowest level, which is also the\nmost organised, \u2014comparatively simple combinations of movements\nbeing developed at an early period and persisting with relatively little\nmodification. The middle stratum represents a greater degree of com\nplication, and is automatic in a less degree than the lowest. The\nmiddle centres are less organised, as development is continually taking\nplace in them, allowing new combinations of movements ; e.g. the move\nments involved in writing, sewing, type-writing and other manual occu\npations after they have become habitual. The highest level includes\u2014\nroughly speaking\u2014the frontal lobes of the brain, is concerned with the\nmost complex co-ordination of sensations and movements, and probably\nsupplies the greater part of the physical basis of consciousness.\nHence the conscious movements originate in the highest level and the\ngreater part of the unconscious movements in the middle level. In\nthe latter the sensations are associated together among themselves to a\ncertain extent and chains of memory are formed. When sensations\nare transmitted to the highest level they enter into normal conscious\nness,\u2014the dominant consciousness, for the time being, of the individual.\nThe activity of this level thus constitutes the personality of the\nindividual. But when the activity of the frontal lobes (highest level) is\nsuppressed, the consciousness of the middle level becomes dominant and\nstands out as a personality of a more or less automatic character. The\ntwo levels may also act more or less independently and simultaneously;\nbut the interdependence of one level upon the other is essential for\nmentation that shall completely subserve the intellectual wants of the\nindividual, and the highest level requires and is entirely dependent\nupon the second level for all intercourse with the outer world.\nIn attempting to explain on this theory the phenomena of\nhysterical anaesthesia in the two cases reported by him, the writer\n\"\n\fMay, 1897.] _ General Meeting. 69\nconceives that the anaesthesia of hysteria is the inhibition or \" going\nto sleep \" of certain limited areas or centres of the highest level\n(frontal lobes), while hypnosis is the more or less complete inhibition or\ngoing to sleep of the frontal lobes as a whole. In hysteria there is a\nlocal suppression of function ;\u2014in complete hypnosis a total suppression\nof function of the highest level.\nIn the experiments described, the stimuli applied to the anaesthetic\nhand produced sensory impressions which remained in the middle\nlevel of the brain, not being able to reach the frontal lobes and affect\nthe normal consciousness. When the patient was hypnotised, and the\nactivity of the frontal lobes thus suppressed, as a whole, the conscious\nness of the middle level became predominant, constituting a \" second\npersonality,\" which could remember the impressions received by the\nsame consciousness when it was not predominant. The hypnotised\nsubject is devoid of spontaneity and her acts are more or less\nautomatic, which is characteristic of the middle level.\nThis explanation also covers the case of automatic writing per\nformed unconsciously in the waking state (and during the performance\nof which the writing hand in some cases becomes anaesthetic), which\nthe subject can describe in detail on being hypnotised.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers concluded his address on \" Hysteria and\nGenius.\" The following is a brief summary of what was said :\u2014\nFrom one point of view genius resembles hysteria, inasmuch as both\nconditions imply a readier than ordinary permeability of what may be\ncalled the psychical diaphragm which separates the supraliminal from\nthe subliminal self. But whereas in hysteria the main result of this\npermeability is that fragments of faculty, needed for ordinary life,\nsink down beyond voluntary control, in the case of genius, on the\nother hand, the main result is that uprushes of subliminal faculty\nco-operate with voluntary effort, and enrich the output of the supra\nliminal self. Genius, therefore, represents an increased command over\nthe whole psychical being ; an advance in integration, which means an\nadvance in the main line of development which our race is pursuing.\nAnd since the most reasonable way of using the word norm in refer\nence to a race in process of change will be to call the most advanced\npoint yet reached by any individual along a well-determined curve of\nracial change the norm of that race, the man of genius may claim to\nbe the normal man in a sense truer than any in which the merely\naverage man can be so.\nThe subliminal uprushes in which genius is thus defined as con\nsisting may take place along the whole extent of the spectrum of\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, is'jt.\nconscious faculty. Mention has been made in an earlier paper of such\nuprushes or self-inspirations in connection with the most definite form\nof faculty\u2014namely, the mathematical. The answers to problems which\nthe calculating boy discerns ready-made on his mental black-board,\nafford us the directest proof that an intellectual process has been sub-\nliminally performed in support of the efforts of the supraliminal self.\nSuch definite statements, however, represent a very small portion of\nthis aid from beneath the surface ; and the symbolism in which such\nmessages come to us is generally of a vaguer kind.\nThere is no reason to assume that all our submerged mental opera\ntions are verbalised ;\u2014expressed in articulate speech. Our own habitual\nfeeling that certain thoughts and emotions transcend the scope of\nspeech may perhaps represent some real subliminal preference for other\nforms of symbolism. Messages from our submerged strata often take\nthe form of pictures, and even the meaningless arabesques sometimes\ncalled, with little reason, \" spirit-pictures,\" may be a kind of stam\nmering attempt at a symbolism more congenial than speech. Conversely,\nthe awkward and roundabout oddity of much automatic script may\nindicate that words are not the habitual vehicle for that section of\nour thought.\nAt any rate, it is in the symbolism of Art\u2014mainly non-verbal \u2014\nthat the promptings of genius show themselves oftenest ; and one\ngreat art, that of music, in its primitive potency and its indefinite\nmeaning, seems like a symbolism of which we have lost the key. Still\nmore marked is subliminal inspiration in the case of the emotions.\nNo psychological question can bear more momentously on human life\nthan the question whether the subliminal element in the passion of\nlove is purely organic\u2014in which case love can be analysed into a\nmixture of illusion and desire\u2014or whether, on the other hand, the\ntruth lies with Plato, for whom the underlying force of love lies in\nman's passion for immortality, and his recognition through the\nmedium of physical or moral beauty of his cosmic destiny in an\nideal world.\nProfessor Marcus Hartog expressed his sense of obligation to\nMr. Myers for the fertile conception of the subliminal consciousness\nand the part it played in genius. He pointed out that its share is\neven greater in deftness, or what may be called physical genius ; and\nas an example, dwelt especially on the technique of direct or\nimpressionist painting, where each touch is totally different to the\nsense when laid on from the effect it will produce when it takes its\nplace in the completed picture ; and on the impossibility of success\nbeing achieved by the direct intention at every moment of the\n\fMay, 1897.] Experiments in Crystal Vision. 71\nsupraliminal consciousness. A great step in advance will be taken\nwhen educationists realise that to the subliminal consciousness belongs\nthe faculty of adjustment and allowance.\nEXPERIMENTS IN CRYSTAL VISION.\nThe experiments here reported, in which some clairvoyant faculty\nseems to have been shown, were made by Miss N. Gernet, a Russian\nlady and Associate of the Society. She describes them in letters\nto Mrs. Sidgwick, as follows :\u2014\nSt. Petersburg, Basseynaya, 33, Lodg. 4,\nOctober 13th\/25th, 1896.\nFriday last, the 4th\/16th of October, we had our first sitting this year ;\u2014\nwe, that is, Miss Marie Klado, an elderly lady, author of good stories for\nchildren, and a still better medium ; Miss S. T., an English girl (born\nhere), my friend,\u2014she is rather gifted psychically and wants to improve still\nmore, but does not quite believe in spiritual powers ; myself.\nAt 8 in the evening we began. Miss Klado and Miss T. sat down near\nme, but not touching me. They were on a sofa in a corner of my study, and\nI was seated on a chair (or rather a low oriental seat) in front of them at a\nsmall table of black wood, uncovered, with a glass of water before me and two\nhigh candles lighted, giving the necessary brilliant spot to gaze at in the\nglass. Miss Klado never hypnotised me or even tried to, and I remain in\nmy clairvoyant experience always perfectly awake and in my natural state,\nneither tired nor troubled anyhow. But her presence always helps me to see\nquicker and better, and I feel my own power \"electrisd\" through hers\nwithout any contact with her.\nThat evening her only rdle was then that of a \"sympathetic current.\"\nShe sat and concentrated her thoughts as far as possible on the same subject\nas me.\nMiss T. was nearer to me and, looking at me and at the glass, tried to\nsuggest to me to see what she wanted,\u2014that is, a certain person I never had\nseen or even heard of (she only told me it was a lady, but not who, and even\nhad she done so, the name was unknown to me), whose surroundings and\neven the town or country she lived in were a mystery to me, as well as to\nMiss Klado. I had no clue whatever to what I could possibly see about this\nlady.\nNow Miss T. did not know herself much about the lady ; she has never\nbeen to her house and has heard little about her way of living, so that she\ncould suggest to me the image of the person, but not of her pastime, dress,\nor rooms.\nWe looked what time it was (a little over eight), and proceeded to pry in\nthe unknown lady's doings. As before, I always need some time to see\nanything when I have not practised for some months. After ten or twelve\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1897.\nminutes gradually the usual very small picture was formed in the brilliant\ncircle thrown by the lights in the glass (standing on a smooth white paper\nlaid on the table). I seldom see any colour but black, white, and spots of\nlight when there is a lamp, candles, or something of the sort (faces, when\nthey are larger, \u2014only the head seen, for instance \u2014sometimes have their\nnatural flesh colouring).\nFirst I saw a slender woman with very fair hair and in a costume which\npuzzled me as well as her doings. I described d mesure all that went on in\nthe glass, Miss T. saying nothing as yet. The figure began to move and I\ncould then make out that she was dressing ; she walked down the room,\nlifted her arms, took something from a board, then stayed in front of what\nwas probably a mirror (I saw only the dark side), and dressed her hair on\nthe forehead. Then she washed her hands, and the moving to and from me\nof her arms and of the essuie-main she held was perfectly distinct. She had\na tea-gown of light colour with long (Greek) sleeves.\nThe scene changed all at once. I saw her in another room, better lighted,\nand a gentleman stood beside her, to whom she seemed to talk in an animated\nway. The gentleman was inclined to be stout, with a light beard and the\nhair a shade darker. When I came to this, Miss T. burst out laughing\nand said, \" Now I believe in it.\"\nThe description of the lady fitted to an astonishing degree, and in the\ngentleman Miss T. recognised one of her relatives, who was reported to be\na devoted admirer of the lady. I broke off looking, the thought striking\nme for the first time that in such a way we may really intrude on our\nneighbour's private life and liberty. The lady living here, the next day my\nfriend, meeting another of her own relatives, enquired whether any one of\nthem had been at this lady's house. Then she came to me triumphant ; the\ncousin I had seen had been there. The lady received him in a light gown\nwith long sleeves.\nNow her and his outward appearance could have been suggested to me by\nMiss T., as she knew both of them. But the visit at this very hour and the\ndress of the lady, this none of us knew or could know.\nSo I think my experience was a success. Both [those present] and the\nfamily of Miss T. were witnesses to the facts being true and accurate, and\ntold before asserting their reality. -\u00bbj- p\nMiss Gernet writes later :\u2014\nNovember 25th\/December 5th, 1896.\nI send you Miss Klado's testimony with the account of our former sitting\n(the only one which we remember well, as it was written down by her at the\nvery moment). Miss Klado reads English pretty well, but did not attempt\nto write it herself ; she gives her answer in French. As for Miss T. , I hope\nshe will answer soon and then I shall send you her letter directly.\nMiss Klado writes :\u2014\nSt. Petersburg, November Uth\/2dth, 1896.\nJe confirme que tout ce que MIle Gernet vous a racontt par rapport a\nsa vision de l'amie de Mlle T., s'est trouvd verifid le lendemain de notre\n\fMay, 18D7.] Experiments in Crystal Vision. 73\nseance, et que MIle Gemet n'avait aucune connaissance de la personne et des\ncirconstances qu'elle voyait.

Marie Klado.\nThe account of the other sitting mentioned is as follows :\u2014\nSt. Petersburg, Basseynaya, 33.\nNovember Uth\/26th, 1896.\nLast winter we tried our first sitting for clairvoyance with Miss Klado\nin her rooms. She wanted me to look for one of her acquaintances' doings,\n(a gentleman who was perfectly unknown to me). The date and the exact\ntime we do not remember ; it was in the earliest evening hours of a winter\nday near to Christmas.\nFirst I saw a sort of library, (for the walls were covered with book\nshelves filled with volumes). The gentleman himself I did not see, but an\nold one, with grizzled hair and disagreeable expression. This person was told\nus afterwards to have been the host of the gentleman whom we looked for,\nthe master of the house where he spent his evening. They really began by\nsitting and talking in the study of the host, where there were many books\non long shelves on the walls. Then the scene changed, and then I saw a\nsort of drawing-room with a lamp hanging over a nicely arranged tea-table,\na very pretty lady busy with offering dishes to the other persons, whom\nI saw dimly, and the dark head of the young gentleman (Prince D , now\ndead) near her, at the table, which was true too. The prince was asked\nto stay to tea (which in Russia holds the place of European supper-time),\nand the hostess, a pretty lady, was seated near him, and poured out\nthe tea.\nThe next day the prince was asked by Miss Klado about his spending\nthis evening, and my vision was found to be exact in most particulars.\nUnfortunately he is now dead, called away at an early age. We do not\ngive the full name, because of the mother, who disapproves of publicity, and\nwould most certainly not like it. ^- qernet\nMary Klado.\nMiss S. T., who prefers that her name should not be given, sent\nMiss Gernet the following account, which was forwarded to us, of\nher recollections of the sitting first described.\nSome time ago, a friend of mine, Miss Gernet, asked me to try water-\ngazing, and as I always felt a great interest in such subjects, I very willingly\ncomplied with her request.\nA few days later we met, and for my part I cannot deny that our\nexperiment was a complete success, as will be seen from the following\naccount.\nThe person chosen by me, and of whom I was to think on that occasion,\nwas unknown to my friend, nor was I ever in her house myself.\nAfter gazing for some time into the water, my friend said that she saw a\nroom, and described it to me and how it was furnished. Then further on she\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1897.\nsaid that a human figure appeared, that of a slight fair-haired woman, dressed\nin a morning gown with wide sleeves, and which seemed to be either white\nor a pale blue ; then my friend told me that she saw the door open and a\ngentleman enter the room ; and on my friend describing his person, I recog\nnised him at once.\nThe very next day I hastened to that lady's house, and questioned her as\nto where she was on the preceding evening, and how she was dressed. She\ntold me that, feeling rather unwell, she remained the whole evening at home in\nher dressing room, and that she wore a pale blue dressing-gown that had\nwide sleeves ! On examining her dressing room, I was astonished beyond\nwords to find how very accurate the vision was, every detail of it.\nSome days after, I proposed to my cousin that we should try together ; but\non this occasion I looked and he thought. At first I only saw a mist and\nthen a female head appeared with something like a crown on her head ;\nthen on looking closer, I recognised it as the head dress worn by ladies\nat Court.\nMy friend whom I saw, and whom my cousin also knew very well, is a\nyoung actress, who, he further acquainted me, was performing that very\nsame night in a piece where she was to act a Russian Princess, dressed in the\nnational costume and wearing that peculiar head-dress seen by me.\nMiss Gernet writes, when sending the above account :\u2014\n[December, 1896.]\nYou will notice two differences with my version. (1) Miss T. says I told\nthe lady was dressed in white or light blue. I said in reality only \" light,\"\nas I do not see colours generally, and the whole dress seemed indeed\nwhitish.\n(2) The lady [is] reported to have stayed in her \" dressing \" room. Now\nthere are no dressing-rooms (in the English sense of the word) as a rule in\nRussian houses, but boudoirs. When I saw her dressing, the room seemed\nhalf-lighted, rather dark ; afterwards it was lighted well and the walls looked\nbrighter, so I took it to be another room.\nYou may notice too that between my and Miss Klado's account and this\none nearly a month elapsed, so that details are now, of course, less distinctly\nremembered. You are quite right that one should write it down im\nmediately. ... N> Gernet.\nCASES.\nG.

There were 10 or 12 other officers present, and amongst them\nMr. John Atkinson (now of Erchfont Manor, near Devizes, Wilts.), the\nSurgeon-Major of the regiment, who sat on my right, but at the end of the\ntable furthest from me and next to Mr. Russell. [Captain Norton was\nsitting at the end of the table and directly facing the window.] At about\n8.45 p.m. Atkinson suddenly glared at the window to his right, thereby\nattracting the notice of Russell, who, seizing his arm, said, \" Good gracious,\nDoctor, what's the matter with you ? \" This caused me to look in the\ndirection in which I saw Atkinson looking, viz., at the window opposite,\nand I there saw (for the curtains were looped up, although the room was\nlighted by a powerful central gas light in the roof and by candles on the\ntable) a young woman, in what appeared a soiled or somewhat worn bridal\ndress, walk or glide slowly past the window from east to west. She was\nabout at the centre of the window when I observed her, and outside the\nwindow. No person could have actually been in the position where she\nappeared, as the window in question is about 30 feet above the ground.\nThe nearest buildings to the window referred to are the Infantry Barracks\nopposite, about 300 yards distant. Behind where I sat is a conservatory,\nwhich was examined by me, as well as the front window, immediately after\nthe occurrence. There was no person in the conservatory. [It was unused\nin the winter.] The nearest buildings to it are the officers' stables, over\nwhich are the staff sergeants' quarters, about 50 yards distant.\nThe occurrence made little if any impression upon me, though it impressed\nothers who were in the room. All present had been drinking very little\nwine ; and the dinner had been very quiet.\nIt has just occurred to me that I may be wrong as to the time of year,\nand that the occurrence may nave taken place about 15th October or about\n15th March. Cbcil Norton.\nMr. Atkinson wrote :\u2014\nErchfont Manor, Devizes, August 31si, 1885.\nThe appearance of a woman which I saw pass the mess-room window at\nAldershot seemed to be outside, and it passed from east to west. The mess-\nroom is on the first floor, so the woman would have been walking in the air.\nThere has been a very nice story made out of it\u2014like most other ghost-\nstories, founded on an optical illusion.\nMr. Gurney added :\u2014\nCaptain Norton's viva voce account made it tolerably clear, in my opinion,\nthat the case was one of hallucination, not illusion. He further mentions\nthat both Mr. Atkinson and he were ' ' satisfied that the face and form of the\nwoman seen were familiar,\" though they could not at the moment identify\nthe person. Captain Norton afterwards felt sure that the likeness was to\na photograph which he was in the habit of seeing in the room of the\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Oddly enough, this man was at the time, unknown to his\nfriends, actually dying, or within a day or two of death, in the same building.\nBut Mr. Atkinson recalls nothing about the photograph ; and the\ncoincidence is not one to which we can attach weight.\nWe have now obtained from two of the officers who were present\nat the time their recollections of the incident. One of them, Lieut.\nBeaumont, in answer to a written request for his recollection of the\nalleged apparition in the 5th Lancers' mess-room at Aldershot,\nwrites :\u2014\nHillside, Burgess Hill, Sussex, March 10th, 1897.\nI well remember the incident you refer to, and shall be pleased to tell\nyou the circumstances as I recollect them.\nIt must have been in 1876, and in October, I fancy. It so happened\nthat on the night in question that there were very few officers present at the\nmess dinner\u2014so far as I can recollect only Norton, E. the veterinary\nsurgeon, Dr. Atkinson and myself, who, being orderly officer, sat at the\nend of the table. It was, I think, towards the close of the dinner, the\nservants having retired and we were smoking and chatting, when I was\nmuch struck with the expression on the faces of my brother officers,\nwho appeared to be gazing in amazement at something behind me. At\nfirst, I thought it was some joke, but they each of them seriously described\nwhat they had seen, viz., a figure of a woman in white, who passed silently\nthrough the room, coming, as it were, from the ante-room and going behind\nme through the door opposite. It was impossible to doubt, from their faces\nat the time, that there was something extraordinary happening. I afterwards\nasked them seriously about it, and Surgeon-Major Atkinson, who was a long\nway the senior, and a hard-headed man, assured me that he had certainly\nseen the apparition, and he seemed much impressed. The others were equally\nconfident, and assured me there was no chaff about it. It was frequently\nalluded to afterwards in a joking way, but I believe that all those present\nthought it \" uncanny.\"\nI must tell you that none of us had imbibed more than a glass or two of\nclaret, and it was a most exceptionally quiet evening at mess.\nI think E. died not long after.\nI did hear that the incident had been related in some story in a magazine,\nbut I never saw it, and I cannot say that I have ever allowed myself to\nattach any great importance to it. Montmorency Beaumont.\nThis letter having been shown to Captain Norton, lie wrote that\nLieutenant Beaumont was mistaken in supposing that Mr. E. was\npresent on the occasion. He also sent us a sketch (reproduced below)\nof the position of the officers, which agrees with his own earlier\naccount, but not with the present recollections of Lieutenant Beaumont.\nThe discrepancy, however, is of comparatively slight importance.\n\fMay, 1897.] 77\nCases.\nIn answer to a further letter asking whether he felt sure about\nthe persons at mess and particularly as to the presence of Veterinary\nSurgeon E. at mess that night, Lieut. Beaumont writes :\u2014\nMarch lift, 1897.\nAfter such a lapse of time, I may be in error as to the presence of E.\non that evening when the apparition was seen. 1 should, however, have\nsaid that he was present. I can be quite sure as to Atkinson and\nNorton. It occurred to me when writing to you that my great friend, Fred\nRussell, was also present, but of this I did not feel sure and said nothing to\nyou.\nI give you here, as far as I can trust my memory, what I believe was\nthe real position of the officers. [Sketch enclosed.] You will observe that\nI place the window behind me. Now I feel confident that I was sitting\nat the end of the table, and almost equally confident that Russell was at\nthe other end\u2014therefore, either he or I was the orderly officer of the day.\nI certainly may have misunderstood what exactly happened as to the\nmovement of the apparition ; it may have been by the window or outside \u2014\nbut, in any case, to have been behind me, I must have been sitting as I\ndescribe.\nMontmorency Beaumont.\n,V>r3-\nx\ntkinaon.\nEntrance \u2014\ndoor.\nBeau\nRussell.\nWindows.\nT\nmont.\n\"Service\n_ door.\n\u2014).

[May, w.n.\nThe second officer whose testimony has been obtained, Lieutenant\nColonel Williams, writes : \u2014\nRockfields, Hereford, March 8th, 1897.\nI am afraid I can give you very little information on the subject ;\nit is so many years since the affair took place that I have nearly for\ngotten all about it. All that I remember is that one night when we were\na very small party at mess, some time during the dinner, I think just before\nbeginning dessert, I noticed Dr. Atkinson looking in rather a peculiar way\nat the window at the top of the room, and I think my brother-in-law\n[Captain Norton] said to him or he said to Captain Norton \"did you see it t \"\nThere was some little joking about it at the time, and on asking my brother-\nin-law after dinner what he really had seen, he told me that he had seen a\nlady in a white dress and dark hair cross the window on the outside.\nHugh P. Williams.\nMrs. Atkinson, the widow of Surgeon-Major Atkinson, in answer\nto a letter asking if her late husband had ever spoken to her on the\nsubject of the apparition at the mess table of the 5th Lancers at\nAldershot, writes : \u2014-\nErchfont Manor, Devizes, March 11th, [1897].\nIt is quite true that my husband saw the appearance at Aldershot in\n1877; he often told me about it. They were in the North Cavalry barracks\n[Captain Norton states that there were no North Cavalry barracks at\nAldershot, but that it was in the West Cavalry Barracks] at Aldershot, and\nwere at mess in the mess-room, which is on the first floor, a great distance\nfrom the ground. There is no balcony outside or even a ledge (I believe).\nMy husband and Captain Norton were the only two sitting facing the window,\nwhen they saw the figure of a woman go slowly by. They were much\nastonished and told the others, and there was much excitement about it.\nShortly after the Veterinary Surgeon died, and on going through his papers\neither my husband or Captain Norton found the photograph of the woman\nthey had seen from the mess-room window. I think they both recognised\nit. It was not known that the Veterinary Surgeon was married. The\nappearance was never in any way explained. M A Atkinson.\nA tablet in All Saints' Church, Aldershot, gives the date of death\nof Mr. E., veterinary surgeon, 5th Lancers, as January 3rd, 1876.\nThis shows that the date when the apparition was seen was probably\nabout Christmas time, 1875, as both Lieutenant Beaumont and Mrs.\nAtkinson confirm Captain Norton's impression that the incident\noccurred shortly before Mr. E. died.\nL. 1088. Thought-transference.\nThe following instances of apparent thought-transference occurring\nspontaneously were sent to us by the Hon. Kathleen Ward, an\nAssociate of the Society. We may point out that the occurrence of\n\fMay, 1897.] Cases. 79\nseveral such instances in the experience of the same person obviously\nlessens the probability that the coincidences were due merely to chance.\nMiss Ward writes :\u2014\n84, Sloane Street, S.W., April 22nd, 1897.\n(I)-\nTwo years ago, on awaking one morning at 8 o'clock, I saw a distinct\nappearance of my sister Emily, seated at the foot of my bed in her night\ngown. She was rocking herself backwards and forwards as if in pain.\nPutting out my hand to touch her, the phantasm vanished. Going into my\nsister's room half an hour later, I related to her my experience, and she\n(being still in much pain) informed me that at 8 o'clock she had actually been\nin the position above described, on her own bed. and had meditated coming\ninto my room, but had not liked to disturb me ; (she had been perfectly well\nthe night before). My sister's room is at some distance from mine, being\ndivided therefrom by a corridor and cross-door. Kathleen Ward\nEmily G.

On her return in the evening she mentioned\nhaving seen our new member there (Dr. Rentoul, Member for East Down).\n\" What kind of man is he?\" I asked. \"Well,\" she said, \"he's exactly\nlike some one I've seen somewhere lately, but who it is I cannot remember, it\nhas been puzzling me all the way home.\" That night I had rather a vivid\ndream, in which I appeared to be driving the said Dr. Rentoul in my little\npony cart through Downpatrick. Dr. R. was dressed as a jester, with cap and\nbells complete. In my dream this seemed to me perfectly natural. Next\nmorning I at once repaired to my sister's room, and related to her the dream.\nShe exclaimed directly, \" That's who he's like\u2014Rigoletto, the jester\u2014whom\nI saw lately at the opera ! \" I should add that I have never seen either\n\" Rigoletto \" or Dr. Rentoul !\nKathlben Ward.\nI testify to the accuracy of the above statement.\nEmily G.

In this account, Miss Ward says :\u2014\nFor my part, I had never seen the opera, nor had my sister ever\ncommented on the appearance of any of the actors therein.\nan).\nOn the 12th of February, this year, my sister and I were driving together.\nIn the course of conversation, I mentioned an absurd dream I had had the\npreceding night, in which I appeared to have been in possession of a bicycle\nmade of pure gold, studded with rubies and diamonds. \" That is most\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

In conversation they got upon psychical subjects, and my sister\nrelated some of the experiences given above. After lunch Mrs. Maude\nsuggested a game of \"Patience,\" the particular one fixed upon being known\nto us as \" Demon Thirteen. \" In wishing my sister good-bye, Mrs. Maude\nsaid, \"Now ask your sister what we did directly after lunch, and see whether\nshe can tell us.\" Later on my sister met me at another house. She at once\nasked me Mrs. Maude's question. In a moment the vision of these two\nbending over the cards, came before me, and I said, \" Playing Patience.\"\n\" And which game ? \" pursued my sister. (We know and play at least twenty\nvarieties). \"Demon Thirteen,\" was my answer. I should add, that my\nsister had never happened before to play \"Patience\" at that particular\nhour.

We know that the senses\nare lulled, not sealed, in sleep, and that real noises often modify our\ndreams, sometimes awakening us. But these noises were purely imaginary \u2014\nmy dreams were in the dead of night when the house and vicinity were as\nsilent as the tomb. I always awake before being called by my maid at 7.30,\nand know her footsteps well, of course. In dream No. 1, I heard her steps\nplainly, and dreaming it was morning and the usual hour for rising, I awoke\nwith a start. In dream No. 2, I heard the front door bell ring and instantly\nconnected it with the expected visit of a cab proprietor who lives near, in\nthis case also awakening at once. He has not yet come as I expected. I am\nsure the sounds were non-existent, and imaginary, but, if so, how could I\nhave been roused from sound sleep by them ? Were they auditory hallucina\ntions of the Soul or Ego ? p 3 Doveton.\nEastcliffe, Babbacombe.\n[Actual physical effects of many differents kinds are produced by dreams,\nand the particular one described seems to be not uncommon in the\nexperience of many persons.\u2014Ed.]\n\fNo. CXL.-Vol. VIII.

The election of two new\nAssociates of the American Branch was recorded.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of Dr. Charles Alex\nander Lockhart Robertson, who was an original member of the Society\nand of the Council.

W. H. Myers gave an address on \" The Moral and Intel\nlectual Limits of Suggestion,\" of part of which the following is an\nabstract :\u2014\nThe successes of hypnotic suggestion and of self-suggestion are\nbeing daily pushed further, and it becomes increasingly important to\nform some conception of their possible range or necessary limit. Much\nthat hypnotists had hardly ventured to anticipate has been recently\nattained ; while on the other hand it seems desirable that anticipation\nshould be pushed as far as reason allows, \u2014being itself an important\nfactor in the production of the desired effect. I wish, then, to deal\nwith the highest or most advanced results of suggestion. Adopting Dr.\nHughlings-Jackson's scheme of centres at three levels of evolution, I\nnnay endeavour to select and review the effects produced upon highest-\nlevel centres, those which we imagine as governing moral and intel\nlectual manifestations. There is, of course, no definite line to be\n.drawn between these results and results merely somatic or physiological.\nThe changes of all kinds occur in interconnection, and are set in action\n3by the same forms of suggestion. We may, however, roughly say that\nthe effects which we attempt to compass by education will correspond to\n\u2022changes of highest-level centres, and may be regarded as defining the\nrange of morality and intellect.\nOur educative efforts are partly inhibitive and partly dynamogenic ;\nthat is to say, we endeavour to check some impulses, and to stimulate\nand strengthen others. All inhibitive education seems capable of being\nassisted by suggestion. Thus, our first effort Is to teach the child\nto control tricks and tics ;\u2014sucking thumb, biting nails, stammering,\n.echolalia, etc. Similarly in need of restraint are manifestations of\nill-temper, violence, etc., with other impulsive tendencies which arise at\na later stage of development. Then in adult life we find the craving\n\"for stimulants and narcotics ; \u2014tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, morphia. In\n.each of these classes of cases hypnotic suggestion has often succeeded\nwhen all other means have failed.\nIn the intellectual field also strong inhibition is needed throughout\nlife, and has often been greatly helped by suggestion. There is no\nevidence that suggestion can much expand the range of native intelli\ngence, so as to make a Newton of an ordinary man. But it can concen\ntrate attention, either below or above the conscious threshold ;\u2014below,\nas in Dr. Brainwell's cases of post-hypnotic computation of the date\nwhen a suggestion falls due ; above, as in Liebeault's now classical\nischoolboy, and similar cases. The occasional solution of baffling\nmathematical problems in sleep is encouraging in this direction ; since\n.what spontaneous somnambulism can do it is likely that hypnotic\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1897.\nsuggestion can do also. More experiments in this direction are much\nto be desired.\nPassing on to definitely moral education, we endeavour to foster\nboth the self-regarding and the altruistic virtues. Self-regarding\nvirtue consists largely in the forms of self-control already mentioned ;\nbut also in the more active qualities of courage, confidence, prompti\ntude. These qualities hypnotic suggestion has often directly stimulated,\nwhile it has still oftener fostered them by checking the \"phobies\" or\nspecific morbid fears which form a paralysing ingredient in many\nminds. The altruistic virtues, again, rest largely on the same basis\nof self-control as the self-regarding. When we hear, for instance,\nof a patient raised by hypnotic suggestion from \" moral insanity \" to\nmuch-valued helpfulness as a hospital nurse, we need not assume that\nshe has attained any high pitch of self-devotion. There is a kind of\nethical \" position of stability \" in the civilised world which implies\nadequate good sense and good will to others, but no heroic virtue.\nUp to this point, as it seems, even very rough and low natures can\nsometimes be carried. It is not likely, on the other hand, that the\nhypnotising physician will often be called upon to give to the hard\nsuccessful worldling a \" heart of flesh,\" or to add a new grace to the\ncharacter of the saint. Yet in these directions, also\u2014throughout all\nthe range of human character\u2014sudden and permanent changes for the\nbetter do frequently occur. Conversions\u2014which may, of course, be\nconversions to any religion or to any philosophy\u2014afford a series\nstrikingly parallel to our series of cures by suggestion. When sudden,\u2014\nas at revival meetings and the like,\u2014they are often accompanied with\na profound trancelike sleep. These sudden conversions, I may add,\nare often quite as permanent and profound as those which follow upon\nlong-continued brooding or suasion.\nBut if it be true that conversion and suggestion are sometimes\nalmost equivalent expressions for a change which seems profounder\nthan the changes which mere reasoning inspires, this is not to say that\nthe origin of either lies in some mere physiological trick or fortunate\nself-delusion. I believe that there is here a true dynamogeny, implying\nwhat must in some sense be an intensification of vitality. This\u2014as I\nconjecture\u2014comes in the last resort from a world of life,\u2014a metetherial\nenvironment,\u2014some condition of things more fundamental and primary\nthan the interstellar ether itself. In this energy, however defined or\npersonalised, we live and move and have our being. Hence comes the\nvitalising or informing principle, which is nearer to its source, and can\ndeal with the body more freely in its subliminal than in its supra\nliminal relations, \u2014can modify it more effectively in trance-states than\n\fJune, 1897.] General Meeting. 85\nin waking hours. The occasional coincidence in trance of telaesthesia\nwith somatic plasticity might be thus explained. The body (we might\nsay) can then be more easily modified, and also the soul or informing\nprinciple can be more nearly detached. If, however, hypotheses like\nthese are to have any value, they should be to some extent capable of\ncorroboration by actual experiment. Self-suggestion, in fact, ought to\nbe possible to an extent hitherto only realised by certain isolated\nhistorical groups,\u2014Buddhist, Stoic, or Christian. This is the direc\ntion in which effort should now be made ; and if success is anywhere\nthought to have been attained, that success should be tested and\nrecorded with the care and candour which such results, in such an age\nas our own, at once deserve and require.\nDr. C. Lloyd Tuckey related some of his experiences as practical\nillustrations of the points raised by Mr. Myers. He had seen hypno\ntism cure cases of kleptomania and other morbid conditions dependent\non degeneration, which were not amenable to ordinary medical treat\nment. He especially instanced the case of a girl of thirteen, who\nused to cut up her own and her mother's new clothes from morbid love\nof mischief. Argument, entreaty, and punishment had been tried in\nvain for eight years, but the child was speedily cured by suggestion.\nReferring to the cure of alcoholism and other excesses by hypnotism,\nDr. Tuckey found that the patient's co-operation was essential to\nsuccess, and in support of this he quoted the case of an artist who was\naddicted to drink and to excessive cigarette smoking. He was very\nanxious to be cured of the former, but had mental reservations in regard\nto the smoking. He was cured without difficulty of all inclination for\nalcohol, but it took a long time and much argument to induce him to\nforego tobacco.\nOne patient, a very alcoholised woman, who remained cured after\ntreatment for two years and then relapsed, on several occasions dreamt\nthat she was drinking and woke up with the parched tongue, nausea\nand malaise, characteristic after-symptoms of excess, thus demon\nstrating the similarity of effects produced by material and psychical\ncauses.\nIn regard to stimulating the intellect and developing mental con\ncentration, Dr. Tuckey had seen this result attained in some cases,\nand he referred to the well known cases reported by Mr. Hugh\nWingfield, who, when at Cambridge, had by hypnotic suggestion made\na clever but idle undergraduate settle down to work and pass a\nbrilliant examination. Therefore, though Mr. Myers was no doubt\nright in supposing that one could not by means of suggestion make a\nSir Isaac Newton out of an ordinary intellect, yet one could develop\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1897-\ntalents which were latent and foster good qualities which were over\nborne by evil tendencies, so that there was probably a great future for\nthe judicious use of hypnotism as an educational agent when the time\nwhich Mr. Myers foresaw arrived.\nDr. J. Milne Bramwell said that Mr. Myers had invited those\nwho practised hypnotism to give some account of their experiences :\nbut, as the audience was not a medical one, he preferred to refer to the\nobservations he had made at home and abroad, rather than to relate\nthe details of personal cases.\nDr. Bramwell could confirm Mr. Myers' statements in reference\nto the value of suggestion in disease. The cure of the drug and\nalcohol habit especially illustrated this, many cases of long-standing;\ndipsomania having remained well for years after hypnotic treatment.\nIn various forms of obsession also it was strikingly useful ; fears and\nmorbid ideas, which had rendered the patient's life a burden, frequently\ndisappeared.\nIn his earlier paper Mr. Myers had suggested that the inspirations-\nof genius were frequently an uprush from the subliminal consciousness,\nand of this Dr. Bramwell knew an interesting example. This was\ndiscovered accidentally during an attempt to learn something of the\nhypnotic state by questioning a subject during hypnosis. She\ndescribed her mental condition, when suggestions were not made to-\nher, as one of tranquillity, and asserted that she rarely spontaneously\nthought of anything. On one occasion, however, in hypnosis she\ndesigned a dress, a problem which she had vainly attempted to solve\nin the waking state. On awaking she remembered nothing of this,\nbut about an hour later the design suddenly flashed into her mind,\nand she carried it out successfully. She was entirely ignorant of the\norigin of her inspiration in the waking state ; but now, when again\nhypnotised, was able to recall that this had arisen in a former\nhypnosis. If one were able to hypnotise a man of genius, question\ning during hypnosis might possibly throw some light upon the\nsubliminal origin of his inspirations.\nDr. Bramwell was glad that Mr. Myers had referred to the diffi\nculty sometimes encountered in the induction of hypnosis. Many\npeople believed that it was an operation which could be performed with\ncertainty at the first attempt, and expected that their intellectual,\nmoral and physical nature could be completely changed in a few\nminutes. The production of hypnosis, as the result of post-hypnotic\nsuggestion, had also been misunderstood.

He studied medicine first at Edinburgh and St. Andrews ;\nand then, after five years spent in the Army Medical Service, he\nentered on a fresh course of medical study at Cambridge, where he\ntook the degree of M.D. After this he commenced practice in\nLondon, devoting\u2014with characteristic energy\u2014the time that he could\nspare from his profession to the work of the Medico-psychological\nAssociation ; of which he was for some years Honorary Secretary,\nafterwards becoming joint Editor with Dr. Maudsley of its journal\u2014\nthe Journal of Mental Science. After filling most successfully the\npost of Medical Superintendent of the Haywards Heath Lunatic\nAsylum, he was appointed, in 1870, Chancery Visitor in Lunacy;\nwhich appointment he only resigned in January of last year, at the\nage of 70. He was a man of very active mind, who wrote much on\nsubjects connected with the treatment of the insane, and showed an\never-fresh interest in new ideas and facts, and improvements of\nmethod.

ALFREDO BAROELLOS,\nOF RIO DE JANEIRO.\nCommunicated to the Society for Psychical Eesearch by their Corresponding\nMember in Brazil,\nProfessor A. Alexander.\nIntroduction.\nThe Journal for July, 1893, contains a case of thought-transference\nobtained through table-tilting (M. 56), to which one of the principal\nwitnesses is Dr. Alfredo Barcellos, of Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro. He\nis therein described as a student of hypnotism ; but it must now be\nadded that in the treatment of patients he has applied hypnotic pro\ncesses with much therapeutic success, and that in so doing he has met\nfrom time to time with spontaneous phenomena of considerable\ninterest to psychical students. After some delay, I have succeeded in\nobtaining the evidence for these supernormal occurrences, which is\nhere presented. My informants in the following cases are all reliable,\nand with regard to Dr. Barcellos himself, I can specially recommend\nhim to confidence as an intelligent and trustworthy narrator of the\nfacts of his experience. As, however, his object has always been the\ncure of disease, and not experimentation, he has in general omitted to\ntake written notes of his observations. It is, therefore, important to\npremise that his memory is decidedly a faithful one ; that it was much\nimpressed by the occurrences witnessed, and that, in his references to\nfacts observed by both of us, I have noticed no tendency on his part\nto exaggeration. This much to be regretted omission renders all the\nmore necessary the corroborative statements made by other persons\nwho were directly or indirectly concerned as witnesses in the cases\ngiven.\nIn 1888, the doctor, having contracted symptoms of beriberi, placed\nhimself for treatment in the hands of a colleague, and was himself\nhypnotised. He was very susceptible to influence, so that the curative\nsuggestions of the operator produced the desired results. He describes\n\fJune, i8ir.l Supernormal Phenomena. 89\nthe state into which he fell as similar to that of the drowsiness that\nprecedes natural sleep. He felt himself controlled. Vague ideas and\nunfocussed desires floated in the field of consciousness (poly-ideism) ;\nbut there was almost no power of fixation, nor could his desires attain\nto the force of volitions and pass into motor effects. Thus he ex\nperienced an inability to speak, and much wished that the hypnotiser\n-would order him to do so. By a command of the latter his attention\ncould be at once concentrated on any given point ; yet he noticed that\nin regard to the suggestions made he retained a power of discrimination\nand choice, and could signify by nodding his consent to those that\nseemed the best adapted to his needs. This sign of approval he has\nsince frequently observed in his own patients. On the other hand, he\nconcludes from his personal experience, both as subject and operator,\nthat a suggestion will not take effect if it be really opposed to the will\nof the patient, whose frown, accompanied perhaps with a lateral move\nment of the head, will indicate repugnance or decided rejection. The\ninsight thus gained into the real nature of the hypnotic psychosis\nleads him to deny the existence of a truly mono-ideic state, and makes\nhim insist on the importance of enabling the patient to speak and\nreply freely to questions during hypnosis. In these conclusions,\nindependently arrived at, he is in complete accordance with Dr.\nBramwell.\nIt is now recognised that the mental attitude of the hypnotiser,\nand his consequent method of training his subjects, determine largely\nthe form of hypnosis induced. Were the matter any longer a debat\nable one, some proof of such personal influence might be gathered even\nfrom hypnotic practice in Rio de Janeiro. One of our doctors (now\ndeceased) was accustomed to obtain in his patients little more than the\nlethargic sleep with, perhaps, slight cataleptic phenomena ; Drs. Erico\nCoelho and Fajardo, of this city, train their subjects in suggestive\ncatalepsy ; another practitioner has reproduced in those hypnotised by\nhim the three stages observed in the Salpetriere, while Dr. Barcellos'\npatients are mainly characterised by a tendency to pass into the alert\nor somnambulic state.*\nIt does not seem, however, to be so readily admitted that the\ndevelopment of supernormal faculties during hypnosis in certain\nexceptional cases may be favoured, or hindered, by belief or disbelief\nin the possibility of their occurrence. Yet in view of the close mental\nrapport which is presumably established between the operator and a\n* In a footnote to his paper on \" Hypnotism and Telepathy \" (Part XII of\nProceeding\/, p. 242), Mr. Gurney speaks of the \" readiness with which what may be\ncalled hypnotic fashions are established.\"\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jcne, wwr\nsensitive subject, it may be surmised that some subtle influence (which\nfrom a physical analogy might be called catalytic) is really exercised\nby the former, whose mental bias furnishes, or withholds, the\nnecessary conditions. The fact that Dr. Bernheim hypnotised over\n10,000 patients without meeting with a single occurrence contrary to'\nthe conceptions of orthodox science, stands in marked contrast with\nthe experience of such competent observers as Professor Charles\nRichet, Drs. Ochorowicz, Gibert, and others.* In a much more\nlimited sphere, and in a more perfunctory manner, several of our Rio\nhypnotists have satisfied themselves of the reality of certain clair\nvoyant and telepathic extensions of the hypnotic trance. It is true\nthat Brazilian subjects are, in general, highly suggestible and sometimes-\nhighly sensitive in other ways ; but this alone would not, perhaps, be\nsufficient to evoke the rarer hypnotic phenomena, did there not exist\nin the Brazilian operator a latent desire to witness them.\nIn Dr. Barcellos' case, there was certainly no parti prii that might\nact as an obstacle ; therefore it may be supposed that, while attending\nstrictly to the necessities of a curative treatment, he left ajar the\ndoor by which such marvels find an entrance. The possibility\nof telephenomena had been already proved to him by a case of\nclairvoyance that had fallen under his notice before his attention was\ndrawn to hypnotism.! Thus it happens that he has had in his\nclientele two patients whose lucidity was developed to a remarkable\ndegree, namely, (1) the subject E., a young lady of 17, who, when the\ndoctor was first called to attend her, was suffering from the most\nacute form of hysteria {grand hysterie), and (2) Donna G. de M.\nThe supernormal powers of E. were not in general so well observed\nduring the period of her treatment in 1891-3 as to render possible any\n* In summing up the results of his hypnotic experience, Dr. Bernheim asks, \" Du\nmerveilleux, tel que la lucidity, la provision de l'avenir, la vision inteVieure, )a vision\na distance ou a travers des corps opaques, l'instinct des remedes, est-il besoin de dire\nque je n'en ai pas vu ? \"\n+ This occurred in 1883, at Cantagallo, in the (then) Province of Rio. The doctor\nwas attending a black patient, the slave of a certain Donna Marianna Py. One\nmorning the sick man, while labouring under the delirium of typhoid fever, declared\nthat Donna Marianna's son, Augusto, was rolling down a hill in a bullock cart. At\n12 o'clock Senhor Augusto Py arrived at his mother's house (he lived at half-a-league's-\ndistance), and on enquiry, it was found that the accident had really happened to him.\nnot only in the manner described by the deliiious man, but also at the very hour of\nthe apparent vision. Dr. Barcellos was not actually present on the occasion, but he-\nwas told of the circumstance on the same day by persons of the family.\n\fJune, 1897.J Supernormal Phenomena. 91\nbut a cursory mention of the alleged instances of their manifestation.\nE., however, has lately been hypnotised at a distance with apparent\nsuccess. One night in June, 1896, her father, General Carlos de\nAranjo, called on Dr. Barcellos. In consequence of the shock\noccasioned by a death in the family, the girl was again suffering from\nviolent hysterical attacks. He had come to town to make arrange\nments for the funeral and to request the doctor to visit her. These\nwere the circumstances that led to the experiment, which was made\nwith the idea of affording immediate relief to the sufferer. An\naccount of this was dictated to me by Dr. Barcellos on the following\nevening.\nJune 23rd, 1896.\nOn Monday, the 22nd of June, 1896, at nearly 10 o'clock p.m., there\nappeared at my house General Carlos de Aranjo, the Director of the Asylo\ndos Invalidos da Patria on the island of Bom Jesus. He told me that his\nlittle grandson had died on that day, and that his daughter E., who was some\ntime ago under my hypnotic treatment, was suffering from formidable\nhysterical attacks. He expressed a desire that I should go thither and calm\nher by the usual hypnotic processes. As it was late, and as I felt myself\nmuch fatigued, I told him that it was impossible to undertake the journey at\nthat hour, but that I would go the next day in the early morning. I would,\nhowever, compensate for my absence by transmitting to her, from where I\nwas in Botafogo, a [mental] order to sleep and to recover during sleep her\ncalmness and tranquillity. Moreover, I gave him a letter containing the\nsame suggestions, in my own handwriting, and this was to be handed to her\nfor perusal in case she were in a condition to read it. If, however, she were\nstill hysterical and unable to read, he was to make use of the letter by\napplying it to her forehead and making passes with it ;\u2014all this to provide\nagainst the possible failure of the attempt at hypnotisation at a distance\nwhich I was about to make. Taking out my watch, I showed General Carlos\nde Aranjo that it was ten minutes past ten, and [I requested him] to make\ncareful enquiry on arriving at the island whether the time at which E. had\nthere fallen into a calm and deep sleep coincided, or not, with the hour then\nnoted for the commencement of my experiment. As the General was taking\nleave, I gave him every hope of a successful result, for I recollected that on\nanother occasion there had been some proof of telepathic communication\nbetween my patient and me, the [intervening] distance being the same.\nThe General having withdrawn after this verification of the time, I\nentered the drawing-room, which was dark and unoccupied, and shut myself\nin, having first informed my mother-in-law, Donna Joanna Azambuja, of my\nintention, and requested her to prevent any noise or movement that might\ndisturb the attempt which I was about to make. I sat down on a chair with\nmy forehead clasped between my hands ; I concentrated my thoughts\nintensely, imagining myself sotting out for the Island of Bom Jesus, and\ngetting at that moment into the street-car. . After I had passed in mental\nreview the places [to be met with] on the journey, I pictured my arrival in\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 18\u00ab7.\nthe presence of my patient, and having evoked a vivid image of her in my\nmemory, I made suggestions for about the space of a quarter of a hour to the\naffect that she should sleep and become calm and tranquil. My fixation was\nso intense that I finally experienced a sensation of exhaustion in the arms\n(esvaecimento nos braqos). I arrived at the conviction that the suggestion had\nbeen successful.\nOn the morning of the following day I went to the island and had much\nsatisfaction in verifying that about twenty minutes past ten E. had fallen\ninto the hypnotic sleep, and had recovered the tranquillity of which she stood\nin need.\n[Signed] Dr. Alfredo Barcellos.\nAccording to other notes taken at the period, Dr. Barcellos, on\nreturning that day from the island, went to a house of business in the\nSaude,* and while waiting alons in a room, again endeavoured to\ninfluence his patient by sending her a telepathic command to sleep.\nHe fixed his attention on this object at 1.55 p.m. \u2014was interrupted\nfor a moment, and then willed the message strongly about 2 o'clock.\nThey afterwards informed him that at that hour E. looked more\nthan once at the clock, and began to console her bereaved sister in\naccordance with a verbal suggestion given by Dr. Barcellos when he\nwas at the island. A certain oddness was noticeable in her behaviour ;\nbut as hypnosis was not induced, this second experiment must be\nconsidered a failure.\nAn allusion is made in Dr. Barcellos' account to a former instance\nof telepathic communication between him and his patient. During\nthe first period of General Aranjo's residence on the island of Bom\nJesus his daughter had frequent accesses of spontaneous somnambulism.\nThe doctor was sent for. The journey from Botafogo to the island\nbeing a long and inconvenient one, he proposed to E. that she should\nin future lapse of her own accord into the hypnotic sleep, and should\nthen recall all the suggestions he had made to her. When asked how\nmany times it would be necessary that she should fall into this self-\ninduced hypnosis, she replied that three times would be sufficient. Dr.\nBarcellos, therefore, directed her to retire to her room at 1 p.m. on\nthe three following days, promising on his part to concentrate his will\npower on the proposed object at the same hour at Botafogo. On the\nfirst two days, at the appointed time, he fixed his thoughts strongly on\nE. ; on the third occasion, however, he forgot to do so, and was on his\nway to the city in a street-car, when he casually glanced at the clock in\nthe Largo do Machado. It was 25 minutes past one ; he remembered\nhis agreement, and then and there made the promised volitional effort.\n*A business part of the town on the water's edge.\n\fJune, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 93\nMeanwhile E., in obedience to the command of her hypnotiser, went to\nher room on the first and second day, and was self-hypnotised without\ndelay or difficulty ; but on the third, instead of yielding at once to\nhypnotic influence, she remained in a state of agitation for about\ntwenty minutes, after which she again fell into her self-induced\nsleep.\nNo attempt was made to compare the clock in the Largo do-\nMachado with the time at General Aranjo's house. The coincidence\nis, nevertheless, sufficiently well verified to warrant the conjecture that\nE. in her then sensitive condition did, in some obscure way, depend\ndirectly on the volitional support afforded to her by the distant\noperator.\nIt is interesting to note that on two or three occasions, when Dr.\nBarcellos was present, and not making any special mental effort to\ninfluence her, E. failed to apprehend the meaning of his verbal\ndirections. Two such orders were thus misunderstood by her, with\ncurious results. One day, as a momentary repression of some undue-\nvivacity on her pare, he told her \" not to think.\" This was accepted\nby her as a post-hypnotic suggestion, so that between that sitting and\nthe next she moved about like an automaton, answering no questions,\nand giving no sign of intelligence. On being re-hypnotised and\ninterrogated as to the cause of her condition, she reminded the doctor\nof his supposed command, and accused him of cruelty, asking him\nwhether he thought it possible that a human being could live without\nthinking. On another occasion she was told to follow one of the\ndoctor's acquaintance clairvoyantly. This also was received by her as\na standing order, and for four days her mental vision seems to have\nbeen constantly directed to this individual. No enquiry was ever\nmade to discover whether her description of his actions corresponded\nto fact.\nIn concluding this presentation of Dr. Barcellos' statements relative\nto this subject, I must give his assurance that the persons of her\nfamily could readily distinguish between her hypnotic and her normal\nsleep, and could always tell whether she was in a sleep-waking\ncondition or not.\nIn the afternoon of February 27th, 1897, I had an interview with\nGeneral Carlos de Aranjo at the island of Bom Jesus, and found him\nvery willing to furnish me with any information respecting the case\nthat it was in his power to give. Although he asserts that his\nmemory of the strange facts observed during the anxious period of his\ndaughter's illness is by no means perfect, yet his evidence, so far as it\ngoe3, confirms that of Dr. Barcellos. Indeed, the further particulars\n\f94 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1807.\ngiven by him and by E.'s fiance render the fact of hypnotisation at a\ndistance more probable than it would be if it stood alone.\nWith regard to the latter occurrence, the General affirms that he\ndid not tell his daughter of his intention of calling on Dr. Barcellos on\nthe evening in question. It is quite true that E. fell asleep at the\ntime of the doctor's attempt to influence her telepathioally. It is also\ntrue that this sleep was not a natural one, which could hardly have\nsupervened in her then state of acute hysteria. On his arrival at the\nisland, he followed the instructions given him by the doctor ; that is,\nhis daughter having passed spontaneously into a trance, he made\npasses with the letter which he had received at Botafogo. The result\nwas not satisfactory, inasmuch as the patient declared that, when\ninfluenced in that manner, she found the effort to wake both painful\nand exhausting. She begged, indeed, that such a process might never\nAgain be employed.\nQuestioned as to the second attempt at telepathic hypnotisation on\nthe 23rd of June, 1896, General Aranjo also states that the hypnotic\nsleep was not induced. .\nAt the period preceding the removal of the family to the island of\nBom Jesus, and while they yet resided in the Rua da Passagem, E.,\nwho was then under regular treatment, seemed to be aware of Dr.\nBarcellos' approach whenever he went by the house. She would rise\nfrom her place and run to the window, where he was invariably found\nto be passing, either on foot or in a street car. In this, according to\nmy informant, she was never once deceived.\nA far better proof that some telepathic communication then existed\nbetween the mind of E. and that of Dr. Barcellos is furnished by an\nincident that occurred shortly before August 22nd, 1893, the date on\nwhich I made a brief note of his account of it. The doctor had tried\nto influence hypnotically a lady patient at a private asylum for the\ninsane (Casa de Saude do Dr. Eiran). His thoughts, it must be\nremarked, had been indirectly occupied with E., for the success in her\ncase had induced him to make the experiment. It had, however,\nbeen found necessary to administer chloroform, and in endeavouring to\nrouse the patient from the effects of this anesthetic he had patted her\ncheek. This had taken place, more or less, at five o'clock in the after\nnoon. About 9 p.m. on the same day E., who by normal means could\nhave had no knowledge of Dr. Barcellos' proceeding, awoke from sleep,\nand saw some hallucinatory form standing by her and patting her\ncheek.\nThe doctor no longer recalls the circumstances of the case ; but\nagainst his lapse of memory I must set my written note, and to this\n\f.Junb, 1897.] Supplementary Report of Discussion. 95\nI can now add General Aranjo's assurance that the incident occurred\nas it is here related.\nBesides the special rapport thus established with her hypnotiser,\nthis subject, it would seem, gave occasional indications that her super\nnormal faculties could extend in other directions. General Aranjo\nrelated to me on the same occasion of my visit that a certain Senhor V.,\nknown to him and his family, had moved away to Bahia. Little,\nif any, correspondence had been kept up with him, and he had long\nbeen absent from Rio, when E. one day exclaimed that he had killed a\nman, but that he was not to blame, as it was a question of family\nhonour. News was afterwards received that Senhor V. had indeed\n-committed homicide under the very provocation indicated by the\nclairvoyante.\nThese facts, witnessed in a member of his own household, made a\nprofound impression on my informant, who was not before disposed to\nbelieve in the possibility of their occurrence.\n(To be continued.)\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF DISCUSSION.\n[The following report of some remarks made at the General\nMeeting on April 23rd, was received too late for insertion in the\nMay Journal. \u2014 Ed.]\nAt the close of Mr. Myers' lecture, Mr. W.

He quoted one instance\nwhich seemed to him in some measure allied to what are familiar to psychic\nresearchers as \" automatic drawings.\" A lady, whose faculty for originating\nplots for novels and dramas was somewhat remarkable, was in the habit\nof developing her ideas by an unconscious process of marginal scroll-work,\nwhich often took very fantastic shapes. Sitting with pen in hand, the lady\nwould proceed to sketch out her subject. This would soon give way to\ndesultory .markings and crude forms, which apparently had no relation to\nthe subject matter of her thought. Every such piece of scribbling would be\nfollowed by a few pages of writing. At the end of the work the pages would\npresent the appearance of an ordinary manuscript with the addition of a\nmarginal scroll here and there, and sometimes a whole page of grotesque\nscribbling. On one occasion which the speaker called to mind, the lady\nhad proceeded with a few lines of writing and had suddenly broken off\ninto a sketch something like the following illustration. [Sketch enclosed.]\nWhen the work was finished it was found that the preliminary sketch\nwas a prognostic, in some sense, of the arrangement of the subject matter,\nthough, as in all such plot-weaving, the lady had no idea how the story\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [June, 1897.\nwould develop in her mind. It is more or less inspirational work from\nbeginning to end. The story or plot, then, was embraced in three parts-\ncorresponding to the main divisions of the upright and preliminary stroke of\nthe sketch. The heroine sets out with a very definite purpose in view.\nShe has a mission, an evangel, an object of high aspiration. (Here we note\nthe aspiring and firm character of blades that spring upward from the-\nground. They reach a stage where they give place to a meandering and\nembalanced piece of scroll-work.) At this point in the story, the heroine\nfalls almost imperceptibly under the spoil of a purely human and instinctual\npassion. Her high resolves begin to curl up, and indulgent self-introspection\nfollows. Another stage of the plot finds the heroine making a fresh effort,\nbut face to face with nature, she suddenly gives way, and a total collapse is\nwitnessed. (Here we see the sketch represents the spears or blades as-\nstarting up a second time, but as suddenly flexed and broken down.) The\nconsummation of the ideal is reached in the third stage of the work, where\nin the very weakness of her humanity she realises that far-off ideal to\nwhich she had gone out in hope and strength of purpose. She is married ;\nand in the common uses of daily life she finds that happiness and rest of\nsoul which she had dreamed of as so far from earth, so foreign to herself and\nfellow-creatures, and so worthy of a living sacrifice. (Here we see the\nscroll-work taking a fantastic shape like two swans, and between them a\nstar.) The idea, although simple, and in a measure fanciful, gathers an\ninterest from the fact of the predictive character of the automatic sketch.\nIt may, or may not, be worthy of the designation of \"a non-verbalised\nexpression of the subliminal consciousness,\" but it is brought forward\nas possibly related to that order of phenomena.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Curb op Warts by Suggestion.\n[The following communication has been received from the Rev,\nA.

I was strictly enjoined to say nothing about the opera\ntion to any one, and most necessary did it seem that I should tell no one\nwhere the beef was buried. I followed the directions, and within a fortnight\nor so the wart disappeared, and I have never had a return of such a visitant.\nI know the exact spot where the beef was buried, and could point it out\nif necessary.

ALFREDO BARCELLOS,\nOP RIO DE JANEIRO.\nCommunicated by Professor A. Alexander.\n[Continued from the June Journal, p. 95.]\nCorroborative evidence of the foregoing statements and further\nparticulars respecting E.'s case have been furnished by her fiance,\nSenhor Antonio Pedro Pimentel, who is a medical student and interne\nof the Misericordia Hospital. I visited him on March 6th, 1897. In\nreply to questions, he said that he was staying at the Island on\nJune 22nd, 1896. when E., who had till then been violently agitated,\nfell into the hypnotic sleep. This was before her father's return from\nBotafogo. She slept for an hour and recovered her calmness. With\nregard to the passes afterwards made with the letter, he confirmed\nGeneral Aranjo's description of their effect, adding that, when the letter\nwas handed to her, she thrust it aside on the pillow. On the following\nday, at about 2 p.m., as the second attempt at telepathic hypnotisa-\ntion was being made, he observed that E. did, in fact, look at the\nclock and begin to console her bereaved sister ; but there were no\nother indications that the experiment was a successful one. He was\nalso present at General Aranjo's house in the Rua da Passagem\nwhen E. awoke and saw the hallucinatory figure standing by her and\npatting her cheek. He appeared to have a distinct remembrance of\nall the circumstances of this case, and assured me that my note of the\noccurrence was in every point correct. Questioned as to the self-\ninduced sleep into which E. fell on three successive days, he declared\nthat he was not aware of the alleged deferment of the sleep on the\nthird occasion. He knew only that E. went upstairs at the usual\nhour. Having shortly afterwards made enquiries of persons of the\nfamily, he wrote to me at once saying that at one o'clock in the after\nnoon of the third day the patient went up to her room, but fell asleep\nonly at twenty minutes past one. She was heard to repeat to herself\nthat she ought not to resist the suggestions of Dr. Barcellos. In the\nsame letter he mentions another case of auto-hypnotisation observed\nin E., and this does not seem to have been led up to by any previous\nsuggestion of her hypnotiser. He recollects that the patient, while she\nwas yet residing in the Rua da Passagem, would rise and run to the\nwindow on occasions when Dr. Barcellos was passing in the street.\nThe more satisfactory instance of clairvoyant perception furnished\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, isur.\nby the Bahia incident is also fresh in his memory. E. exclaimed,\n\" Poor fellow ! he has killed a man\u2014but he is not to blame.\nIt was in self-defence.\" A telegram from the North bearing reference\nto the homicide was published in the next day's papers, and later on the\nfamily received a private letter containing details of the affair. In the\ndefence of a relative V. had killed some individual who had penetrated\ninto his house late at night. The unfortunate occurrence was abso\nlutely unknown to all of them when the exclamation was made.\nTo this confirmation of the evidence of the other witnesses Senhor\nPimentel adds that in October, 1893, he himself unconsciously trans\nmitted to E. a telepathic message. He was out fishing one afternoon\noff the Icarahy shore on the Nictheroy side of the Bay, when, the boat\nbeing upset, he very nearly lost his life in the water. About the time*\nof this accident E., who was then at home in the Rua da Passagem,\nwas heard to cry out, \" He is drowning ! \" It was only on his return\nto Botafogo that the family were informed of the danger he had\nincurred.\nTo the above facts respecting this subject communicated by Senhor\nPimentel I must add in conclusion that Dr. Barcellos was in regular\nattendance on her for about two years, at the end of which time a cure\nwas supposed to be effected. But with E.'s recovery has coincided an\namnesia that embraces the greater part of the period of her illness.\nAccording to General Aranjo, she can recall only the later hypnotic\nsittings, and she has little, if any, memory of the various incidents\nthat occurred in the Rua da Passagem. It would seem, therefore,\nthat hypnotism has restored her to bodily health and the life of rela\ntion by causing the more or less complete submergence of a morbid\nphase of her personality.\nII.\nThe observations made during the hypnotic treatment of the\nsubject G. extend over the years 1895-6, and are, therefore, of more\nrecent date than the occurrences above narrated. They are, in general,\nbetter attested ; the statements made by Dr. Barcellos being fairly\nwell supported by collateral testimony. His deposition, which is now\nto follow, was dictated to me in Portuguese in the last fortnight of\nNovember, 1896. It must be remarked that he is fond of citing the\nvery expressions supposed to have been employed by his patient, a\ntendency that might excite suspicion in a case in which the memory is.\nso exclusively relied on. There is reason to believe, however, that in\nsome instances the words given were actually those spoken by her,\nwhile in others the substance of her utterances is at least presented in\n\fJuly, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 101\na characteristic dress. Having called attention to this point with the\nfull concurrence of the doctor himself, I proceed to the translation of\nhis narrative.*\nCapital Federal dos Estados Unidos do Brazil, Rua da Passagem, No. 28.\nDecember 29<\/i, 1896.\nDonna G., married to a Senhor M., and resident in Botafogo, Rio de-\nJaneiro, having undergone an operation that obliged her to remain two hours\nunder chloroform, manifested subsequent symptoms of neurastheny and\nhysteria, and having passed through an acute crisis, afterwards fell into\na state of nosomania, showing inaptitude for all kinds of work and indiffer\nence towards all the persons and things of her surroundings. [ThusJ she\nwould pass the day seated in a rocking chair, whither her food was brought\nto her, for she could not muster up sufficient energy to go to the table and\ntake her repasts with the other members of the family. Varying hysterical\nphenomena were present ; violent palpitations, [accesses of] suffocation or\ngiddiness, claviis hystericus, childish terrors occasioned by futile causes, fre\nquent attacks of partial neuralgia, general debility, etc.\nAlthough she had recovered by medical aid from the lesion from which\nshe had suffered, yet these various ailments persisted with a tendency to\nincrease ; and as the medication employed (tonics, douches, sea-baths,\nelectricity, sedatives, etc.) had been inefficacious, recourse was had to\nhypnotism, and I was called by Senhor M. to take charge of the treatment of\nhis wife.\nDuring the eight [first] sittings it was impossible to hypnotise her,\nalthough there were evident indications that she was really a person who\nwas very susceptible to hypnotic influence. It was only on the occasion of\nthe ninth sitting that she fell into a state of suggestive catalepsy followed\nby well-characterised and loquacious somnambulism ; the post-hypnotic\nsuggestions made in the cataleptic stige were perfectly well carried out, so\nthat a marked improvement in h\u00ab\u00bblth rapidly ensued.\nOne day, as an experiment, I suggested to her that on the day following,\nwhen her husband, Senhor M. , returned from his work, she should have,\nas soon as she saw him, a violent fit of yawning, and should fall into a\nhypnotic slumber of twenty minutes' duration. All this happened, but the\nstate into which she passed was one of somnambulic loquacity. While it\nlasted she declared that she saw me close to her, and even went so far as to\naddress me directly. This experiment did much harm to the patient, who\nafterwards requested me in her trance never again to induce the sleep with\nout being really at her side.\nThe somnambulism of this patient became more and more autonomous\nin a way that rendered her sometimes entirely independent of the will of\nher hypnotiser ; and so far did she go that in this condition she endeavoured\nto direct her own treatment and prescribed for herself remedies, baths, etc.,\n* The originals of this and of the statements of the other witnesses which follow\nwere sent to us by Professor Alexander, with his translations of them.\u2014Ed.\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1897.\nwhich did not always produce a good effect. [The continuance of] this state\nby my toleration\u2014for I wished to verify the phenomena related by Teste and\nother old magnetisers, who vaunted the efficacy of the remedies which\nsomnambules prescribed for themselves\u2014resulted in a loss of precious time ;\nand G., given over to her own control, began to obey the suggestions made\nby me in a very imperfect manner.\nIf it is true that this toleration [of mine] was followed by effects so little\nconducive to a cure, it is not less true that, in the observation of this special\nstate of autonomous trance, I had occasion to witness very marvellous mani\nfestations of clairvoyance.*\nTelepathic Clairvoyance.\nThe first case of the kind happened on March 19th, 1895. I had just\npaid a visit to Donna X. , a patient who was convalescing from a pleurisy on\nthe left side. She lived in the Travessa Pepe, about a kilometre's distance\nfrom the house in which the somnambule resided. I recommended to X. a\ntonic regimen and a change of air. As slight symptoms of marsh fever had\nappeared at intervals, I prescribed for her on March 15th an expectorant, \u2014\narseniate of soda and quinine wine\u2014and on the evening of the 19th I again\nprescribed a mild expectorative potion and bisulphate of quinine, as may be\nverified in the subjoined recipes, t I withdrew, leaving X. engaged in con\nversation with her children. Her condition [of health] seemed to be most\nfavourable ; there was no more feverishness than [might be indicated by a\ntemperature of] 38\"2, and I was convinced that, with the change to Tijuca.\nthe mild tonics I had prescribed and a nutritive diet, my patient, in spite of\nher state of profound anaemia, would in a short time recover her health.\nIt was eight o'clock in the evening when I left X.'s house and set out to\nhypnotise the above-mentioned somnambule. After the latter had been\nthrown into the sleep and had received during her transitory cataleptic stage\nvarious suggestions relative to her health, she passed spontaneously into the\nalert state. Having discoursed in this phase on various topics she suddenly\nbecame grave\u2014frowned as if engaged in some effort of thought (comv\nfiensativa e preoccupada), and with that vivid presentation that characterises\nsomnambules, uttered, in substance, the following words, which made a pro\nfound impression on my memory : \" Dr. Barcellos, that patient of yours is\ndying. Poor thing !\u2014See the children weeping round her. Look\u2014there\ngoes a messenger in all haste to your house to call you. This is what she\nsaid : \" (Here G. tried to imitate the faint tones of a person in articulu\nmortis)\u2014-\" ' Help me, Dr. Barcellos, I am dying ! ' \" (Returning to her\nnatural voice) \"Poor thing!\u2014A stout woman, too\u2014and to say that stout\nness is a sign of health. It is useless, doctor\u2014she is dead ! \" As at that\ntime the person I had just visited was [G. excepted] my only female patient,\nI supposed, on hearing these words, that the reference must be to her, and I\n* The narrator should have employed here the more general term \" lucidity.\"\nT The original prescriptions, sent to us by Professor Alexander, serve to fix the\ndates of the incidents here related.\u2014Ed.\n\fJuly, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 103\ntherefore said to G., \" Examine the dying woman. See what she is dying\nof ; \" to which the somnambule, after [another] effort of thought, replied,\n\"She has an obstruction in her chest on the left side ; but it is not that\nthat is killing her, doctor. What is killing her is her state of profound\nanaemia.* It may be said that this woman's blood has been changed to\nwater in her veins. She is dead ! \"\nI was much struck by the singularity of this spontaneous communication,\nfor in the details known to me it was exactly applicable to the patient I had\n[just] left, and the latter was not even known to the somnambule, who\nmoved in a social sphere completely different from that of X. I awoke G.\nand went out reflecting on the lucky hits she had made. I believed, how\never, that, as I had left my patient X. in the condition above referred to,\nthe story of her death was [merely the result of] imagination. On passing\nby the chemist's at No. 2, Rua de General Polydoro, in returning home\nwards, I was told by the apothecary Senhor Henrique de Figueiredo that the\npeople at the Travessa Pepe had sent for me in all haste. He thought that\nmy patient X. had had a fit, for as I was not to be found, they had called\nDr. Sequeira Dias, who had gone thither and had not yet returned. When\nI heard this from the apothecary, I exclaimed, \"Then she is dead ! for that\nother patient of mine in somnambulism told me that she was dying.\" I\nhurried to the Travessa Pepe, and on arriving there I found that the un\nfortunate X. was in reality\u2014dead !\nI informed Dr. Sequeira Dias and the bystanders of the marvellous vision\nexperienced by the somnambule, and they then told me that, after I had left\nat eight o'clock, X. had still remained in the room engaged for some time in\nconversation, although a feeling of profound dejection had come over her.\nShe was subsequently called to take a bath in the bed-chamber, and\nbade good-night to all. After she had shut herself in the room, the noise of a\nfalling body (am baque) was heard ; the door was opened, and they discovered\nher stretched on the ground in a dying condition. She expired a few\nminutes afterwards.\nDr. Sequeira Dias and I diagnosed a cardiac syncope [as the cause of the\nobit], this being, by the way, a frequent accident in persons suffering from\npleurisy on the left side.\nThe next morning early I met with Senhor M., G.'s husband, who had\nbeen present as usual at the sitting of the preceding evening. I informed\nhim of the event, telling him that unfortunately everything had happened\nin accordance with his wife's announcement.\nTwo days after this occurrence I returned to hypnotise my somnambule,\nand when she had again fallen into her t'ance, I addressed her more or less\nin the following terms : \"Do you know that all you told me at the last\nsitting was realised point for point ? My patient, who was, indeed, unknown\nto you, died. I have been trying to make out some explanation of the means\nthat enabled you to witness the scene. [I think] it is a question of thought-\n* Medical terms, such as \"anaemia,\" are much more familiar to educated\nBrazilians than they are to the ordinary run of English people.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1897.\ntransference. Naturally my patient at the moment of death strongly directed\nher thoughts to me, calling me to her aid. As I am not a sensitive, the\nvibrations from her brain could have no effect on mine ; nevertheless, my\nbrain being en rapport with yours, the thought of the dying woman was\nreflected to you and gave rise to the veridical hallucination which you\nexperienced. Was it not thus that the phenomenon took place 1\" I was\nexpecting to receive a confirmation of my ideas, when the somnambule burst\nout into a loud laugh and answered, \" Nonsense, doctor. You neither know\nnor understand anything about it. I saw and I heard \" (G. accompanied\nthese words with appropriate gesture, placing her finger on her eyes and her\near) ' ' all that passed in the other house ; and I was made to see and hear by\none who stands behind you.\" As I turned about instinctively, G. continued,\n\"Don't you see [the form], doctor? Only see\u2014it is looking at you. It\nholds a bouquet of flowers in its hand. It ii your guardian angel.\" Having\nsaid this, the somnambule began to expatiate on other subjects bearing on\nher malady.\nDown to the present day G. in her normal state ignores these and other\ncommunications made in somnambulism.\nPremonitions.\nCase I.\nG. having been much prostrated on the day following that of her vision\nof the occurrence in the Travessa Pepe, I agreed with her husband to inter\nrupt her in all such manifestations.\nOne day, when she was again in a state of trance, she exclaimed, ' ' A\ngirl ! \" (thoughtfully) \" a young girl !\" (Here she raised her hand to\nindicate the girl's height) \" with loose hair.\" (Becoming very thoughtful\nand frowning) \"She is dead!\" I at once ordered her to withdraw her\nattention from this vision, telling her that she had nothing to do with what\nwas happening outside.\nHaving returnedhome, I was called some I wo hours afterwards to see Ottilia,\nthe daug' ter of Colonel M. de C. She was a girl of fourteen years and always\nwore loose hair, thus presenting the characteristic pointed out by G. Her\nheight also, which was appropriate to her age, roughly corresponded with the\nidea given by the gesture of the somnambule. This girl suffered from con\ngenital cyanosis, there being in her case a permanence of the foramen ovale,\nand now and again she passed through nervous crises, which were so\nhabitual that [when they occurred] the doctor was no longer sent for. This\ntime, however, the crisis was so strong that they had recourse to me as the\nnearest practitioner. On the following day she was seen by her own medical\nattendant, Dr. Sa Ferreira ; but in spite of our professional care, Ottilia suc\ncumbed to her malady on April 22nd, 1895, about eight days after the\npremonition of the somnambule.\nThis coincidence of an immediate call to see a girl presenting some of the\ncharacteristics indicated by the somnambule (loose hair, height, age) may\nindeed lead one to suppose that the event was supernormally foreseen ; and\nit is to be regretted that the exigencies of the treatment obliged me to\ninterrupt G. in the midst of her communication.\n\fJuly, 18D7.] Supernormal Phenomena. 105\nOttilia was not known to G. I myself knew her only by sight, and that\nbecause she lived at a short distance from my house on the opposite side of\nthe way.\nCase II.\nAs I had passed several days without going to hypnotise my patient,\nSenhor M. sent a messenger to know whether I was unwell. I replied that\nI was well, but that my son Luiz had been laid up with serious illness. I\npromised, nevertheless, that I would, if possible, go and hypnotise G. on the\nday following. I went out in fact early next morning in search of a doctor\nto substitute me at my son's bedside during my absence ; then, at eight\no'clock, Senhor M. appeared, and in conversation with my wife, told her\nthat G. had passed the night well. [This being so] he had not come\nto call me. He wished, however, to obtain news of Luiz. Thereupon he\nenquired whether it was not a fever that the boy had and whether there had\nnot been during the night grave symptoms of pernicious fever. My wife\nconfirmed this and added that in the early morning the boy had been very\ndelirious, that his temperature had risen to nearly 41 deg., and that he had\npresented phenomena of insensibility on one side of the body. Senhor M.\nseemed anxious to know whether an energetic treatment had been adopted\nto counteract these symptoms, and when he was informed that the disease\nhad [indeed] been combated with energy by the application of hypodermic\ninjections of quinine and that the fever was already much abated and the\nboy was sleeping, he exclaimed with satisfaction, \"Then he is saved ! \"\nThe lady's curiosity being excited, she asked in her turn how Senhor M.\nwas aware of these [circumstances]. He replied that when the messenger\nof the preceding evening had returned with the news that the boy was ill,\nG. remained for some time in a thoughtful mood, and then spoke in this wise:\n\"Yes, it is Dr. Barcellos' son that is ill. He is very ill. I see him. This\nnight he is going to have very grave symptoms of the fever he suffers from.\nIf they are not counteracted with all energy, he will die.\" Senhor M. then\ndeclared that he had desired to inform us of what his wife had said ; but\nowing to the lateness of the hour and the possibility that the vision was\nmere imagination on her part, he had not ventured to send us the warning.\nImpressed, however, [by the occurrence], he had come early to enquire after\nthe boy, and to learn whether G.'s predictions had been realised [or not].\nMy son Luiz was ill in the last fortnight of April, 1895.\nCase III.\nAt the period of this boy's convalescence the somnambule warned me in\ntime of a serious illness that threatened my wife, Donna Luiza Barcellos,\nand [thus] gave a still more convincing proof of the facility with which she\nestablished a telepathic relation with other patients of mine and persons of\nmy intimacy. G. was acquainted with Donna Luiza, as well as with other\nmembers of my family ; but on the occasion of the incident which I am\nabout to relate she had not met with her for some time.\nIt was before awaking from the hypnotic sleep, and while she was yet\nin a state of somnambulism, that G. addressed me in the following manner :\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jcly, 1897.\n' ' Doctor, come here on Friday\u2014no, not Friday\u2014Saturday. But mind you\ncome without fail; if not, you will repent it.\" On Saturday I went to\nhypnotise her as usual about nine o'clock in the evening, G.'s husband being\npresent according to his custom. In her trance state she said to me : \"Doc\ntor, your wife Donna Luiza is going to fall seriously ill.\" Then beginning\nto act as if she herself were feeling the future sufferings of Donna Luiza,\nshe continued, \"Oh, what a pain in the eyes! Good God\u2014my eyes!\"\n(This always with appropriate gesture.) \"Profuse\u2014abundant perspiration '.\nDoctors\u2014many doctors ! \" (Imitating persons writing prescriptions)\n\" Quick\u2014take it to the chemist's ! \" Then changing her tone to one of\nadvice, she said, \"Doctor, do not wish for many physicians, for they con\nfuse everything. What your wife is going to have is a fever, which may kill\nher in four or six hours And it is not only she who will fall sick. Your\nlittle children, too, will become ill. But what is the cause of this ? Is it in\nthe house they live in\u2014 drains out of order 1 \" And lapsing into thoughtful-\nness, she added, as she gesticulated with her arms, \"No,\u2014 all around there it\nis the same.\" It was, indeed, true that in the immediate vicinity of the house\nwhere we lived there were at that time several cases of rebellious fever. As\nthe previous prediction of the somnambule had been realised, T was rendered\nvery uneasy (imprcssionado) by this announcement, and I implored her to\ntell me whether there were any means of preventing such a catastrophe ;\nto which G., after long concentration, replied, \" Yes. Take your wife\noutside [the city] as quickly as possible. Climate of the mountains\u2014air of\nthe woods ! Even so, she will have what I said, but it will not be a matter\nfor anxiety. \" With but little disposition to withdraw from the city, I said\nthat I already knew what I had to do, \u2014 that if my wife were laid up with\nsickness, I would not call a doctor, but would take her immediately to Tijuca.\nOn this G., becoming angry, said emphatically, \" What, doctor, do you\nwant to play with this ? In short, I have told you what I had to tell you, \u2014\ndo what you have to do. And good-bye,\u2014I am going.\" On terminating\nthese words G. fell into a state of complete lethargy and was awaked.\nOn returning home 1 related what had happened to my mother-in-law,\nDonna Joanna Azambuja, and to my elder daughters, Henriqueta and\nEulalia, begging them to keep the matter quite secret in order that Donna\nLuiza might not be alarmed. I then urged the latter to go early on the\nfollowing day to Tijuca in company with her son Luiz, who had not yet\nrecovered from the effects of his fever. Donna Luiza, however, demurred\nto going on Sunday, alleging that some guests were coming in the evening\nto a small musical party, and that she must be present to receive them. She\npromised, however, to go without fail early on Monday morning. Donna\nLuiza's state of health seemed so perfect and her spirits were so good that I\nconsented to her proposal.\nShe passed the Sunday admirably well. In the evening we had music\nand dancing, which lasted till two o'clock in the morning. The guests then\nwithdrew, and the family, before retiring, met together in the dining-room to\ntake a cup of tea. It was on this occasion that Donna Luiza exclaimed,\n\"Oh, what a headache ! \" and as she stretched herself, she added, \"I feel\n\fJuly, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 107\npains all over my body. \" I looked at her and noticed with anxiety how\nswollen her face appeared\u2014her eyes bloodshot, her frontal veins prominent,\nas well as the temporal arteries. I made her retire to bed and take a cup of\nhot tea. Meanwhile I waited anxiously for daybreak. The patient passed\nthe rest of the early hours in alternate [states of] agitation and stupor.\nWhen Monday dawned it was wet and chilly. There was a wind from\nthe south-west and a drizzling rain. In spite of the bad weather, T woke\nmy wife and invited her to make herself ready to accompany her son Luiz to\nTijuca, according to her promise. To this she replied in a drawling voice\nthat she could not,\u2014 that she was very ill. In view of the bad weather and\nthe state of the patient, other persons of my family looked upon this journey\nas an [act of] imprudence ; but I turned a deaf ear to their protests, and in\norder to oblige Donna Luiza to go, I appealed to her maternal affection,\ntelling her that her son would go only in her company, and that unless this\njourney to Tijuca were undertaken, the boy might have a relapse and die.\nShe then asked for her clothes in order to dress, but fell asleep once more\nwhen we had left her [alone]. She did not wake even when I again entered\nthe room after waiting for her till I was tired. I spoke to her, shaking her\nforcibly to rouse her from the torpor into which she had sunk, and I left my\nmother-in-law and daughters at her side to help her to dress. In this man\nner I succeeded in transporting her to Tijuca.\nAnd now [it must be observed] that during the two fast days of her stay\nthere Donna Luiza, in spite of the intense cold caused by the rains from the\nsouth-west, was constantly bathed in profuse perspiration, although she\nwore nothing over her dress but a light cape ; while the pain felt in her eyes\n(photophobia) during these two days was so great that it was with much\ndifficulty that she could keep them slightly open.\nAs to the children of my family, they did, in fact, have slight attacks of\nfever. The predictions of the somnambule were therefore realised in all\ntheir details.\nCase IV.\nAs G.'s state [of health], although it is much improved, has not permitted\na suspension of the hypno-therapeutic treatment, the sittings have continued\nthroughout the current year of 1896.\nOn August 15th of this year, there died at the age of fourteen a niece of\nmine, named Carmen. She was the daughter of a widow, Donna Maria.\nLuiza de Villas-boas Barcellos, a public school teacher who lives at Meyer,\nthis place being in rectilinuar distance about eleven kilometers away from\nthe quarter where the somnambule resides. Carmen fell seriously ill about\nthe middle of the year\u2014haemoptysis, hectic fever, etc. \u2014and for this reason\nshe was taken in the beginning of her illness to Nova Friburgo, whence she\nreturned in a much worse condition. On the eve of the day for hypnotising\nG. I went to see my niece and found her very ill ; it seemed that she had\nbut few days to live. Her medical attendant was Dr. Luiz Santos, who on\nthe occasion was employing very energetic medication (sodium salicylic in a.\ntonic potion, hypodermic injections of arsenic).\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1897.\nG., who in her normal state knew absolutely nothing of this [case of]\nHickness, and who was not so much as personally acquainted with the\npatient, spoke as follows, while in her sleep-waking condition : \"Doctor,\nthat young girl is ill \u2014seriously ill\u2014but she will recover. There are too\nmany remedies\u2014she can't support them. But she will recover. What\nvitality the girl has ! They ought to give her arsenic only, in small doses,\ngenerous wines and nourishing food. At the place where she is the air is\nvery good. She will recover, doctor ! \"\nThe sanitary conditions of the house occupied by Donna Maria Barcellos\nare in truth excellent ; the situation is an open one, and the residence stands\non a small elevation, where the air is constantly renewed. \u2014a fact that G. in\nher normal state would ignore.\nAs the previous predictions had been fulfilled, I informed my sister-in-\nlaw of this spontaneous declaration of the somnambule. Carmen, whose\nhealth declined more and more, was, nevertheless, submitted to the same\ntreatment as before, to which was added [the application of] injections of\nserum Marayliano.\nSome time after, my daughter Henriqueta being present, G. in her alert\nstate returned to this subject. '\"Doctor,\" said she, \"the girl continues\n[to be] very ill. She cannot bear so many remedies. But what vitality\nthe girl has ! She will recover, however.\" I noticed that G. in asserting\nthat Carmen would be cured, no longer spoke with the same emphasis and\nconviction observable on the first occasion. Indeed, her manner was rather\nindicative of doubt. Asked by me what medicine was most suitable for the girl,\nshe concentrated [her thoughts] for a short time and then said, as she\nfrowningly pointed to the right side, \" Do you see, doctor ? Do you see ? He\ndoes not want me to speak. He does not want me to say what she ought\nto take.\" It did not occur to me to ask on the occasion who this\npersonage was that was thus visualised by her.\nCarmen grew worse and worse. Some days after the last sitting, my\ndaughter Henriqueta being again present, the somnambule with her wonted\nfrown and with alternate contractions of the masseters exclaimed, \"They\nare all in black. They are sad. What is it? Where is it?\" (Becoming\npensive) \"Ah, it is the girl. She will die, doctor.\" (Speaking with much\nnervous agitation) \"But the fault is not mine. They would not let me\nsay what she ought to take. I am not to blame\u2014and even in the beginning\nthey did not do what I said. Poor thing ! But what vitality the girl has ! \"\nIt was a fact that Carmen's disease had made increasingly rapid progress ;\nher state was a desperate one, and what surprised everybody was the vital\nresistance shown by the girl, for she lived on in a dying condition for more\nthan fifteen days. The malady was a fatal one, the prognosis certain ; but\nthe only source of information apparently accessible to the somnambule was\nthat furnished by her faculty of reading the thoughts that occupied my mind\nand of seeing from afar events in which I was personally interested.\nSubsequently to this occurrence G. has manifested lucid phenomena,\nbut not to the same degree as in the preceding cases. Thus it was that she\n\fJuly, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 109\nforesaw the recovery of a paraplegic patient, whose paralysis, after having\nresisted all kinds of medication for [the space of] nine months, did in fact\nyield to hypno-therapeutic treatment, according to the prediction of the\nsomnambule. In this instance also G. in her state of trance alluded to the\npatient without reference to the latter on my part, or any question whatever\nbearing on the subject.\nIn the month of November [of the current year] G. declared that she\nwould be restored to health on December 10th and that she would then\n1'ise, not only all her lucidity, but even her predisposition to somnambulism.\nIn compensation I was to meet in my medical practice with other somnam-\nbules, etc. This declaration was very agreeable to her husband, Senhor M. ,\nand to myself, inasmuch as we both desired to see her radically cured. On\nNovember 19th, however, I was again called to her by a letter in which she\nbegged and entreated that I would not abandon her. In her alert state she\ntold me that the prediction of her definite cure had not been realised,\nbecause she had made it under the influence of my verbal suggestions ;\u2014 that\nthere was still debility of the brain and irritation of the pneumo-gastric\nnerve. These hypnotic sittings, therefore, are yet continued, but at weekly\nintervals, it being my intention to take timely written notes of all facts that\nmay be of importance to psychical studies.\n[Signed] Dr. Alfrej>o Barcellos.\nDr. Barcellos states, in reply to further questions, that G was a\nsufferer from the melancholy, and not the acute form of hysteria.\nBesides the state of apathy in which he first found her, she showed\ntotal incapacity for intellectual effort ; she had no power of fixing her\nattention ; in reading the papers she would, on arriving at the end\nof sentences, forget how they began ; in the presence of visitors her\nideas became confused, and she found it difficult to sustain a conversa\ntion. No attempt was made to discover whether any regions of\nanaesthesia or analgesia existed in this patient, or whether there were\nany marked lacunas in her memory of the past. With regard to her\nalleged lucidity in the trance state, my informant is positive that in\nher case no \" fishing \" for clues was used, nor was there any leading\nup to the subject of her visions and predictions by approximate guesses,\nafter the manner of professional clairvoyants. It is, indeed, evident\nfrom his narrative that the scenes present to her inner perception were\npreceded by nothing more than a few moments' concentration, and\nwere described at once with an unhesitating belief in their actuality.\nAsked whether G. had ever made wrong predictions, Dr. Barcellos\nreplied that, with the exception of her failure to foresee Carmen's\ndeath, he was not aware that any announcement made by her in her\nlucid state had proved, on enquiry, to be false. In the course of\nthe sittings she had had other visions, which were not of a kind to\nadmit of verification.\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Ill\nwhen in a state of somnambulism, I declare that [the narrative] is in general in\naccordance with my memory of those facts. I was present, without a single\nexception, at the hypnotic sittings, my only desire being that G. should\nrecover from her very precarious state of health. Nevertheless, I could not\nhelp being surprised at such manifestations of supernormal faculties.\nIn the case of this patient, hypno-therapy at once produced a good result,\nwhich was not obtainable by other [modes of] treatment. I recollect the\nfailure of the experiment made by Dr. Barcellos when he trusted in the\nremedies indicated by G . in her state of autonomous trance ; and also the\nunsuccessful issue of another experiment of mine, when, yielding to the\nsolicitation of a Kardecist friend, I allowed him to send spiritist medicines\nfor the use of the patient. In touching on this point, I must declare that\nneither my wife nor I was in sympathy with the belief of this friend. She\nlooked upon spiritism even with aversion, and rejected the remedies as soon\nas she knew whence they had come. G. is a Catholic, but by no means\nprone to bigotry (beata). As for me, I had always felt the greatest indiffer\nence with regard to such subjects.\nI will now refer to the principal points in Dr. Barcellos' narrative, in\norder to corroborate them.\nIt is true that G. , in obedience to a verbal suggestion [which was] made\nafter many others on the preceding day, once fell asleep as soon as she saw\nme come into the house, and [then] began to address her medical attendant\nas if he were [really] present. The remarkable sitting in which G. announced\nthe death at a distance of the patient X., took place, more or less in the\nmanner described by Dr. Barcellos. After this lapse of time, I cannot be\nsure of all the words uttered by G. in somnambulism ; the language\nattributed to her, however, seems to me to be characteristic in its vivacity,\nand to render faithfully the substance of the communication. I remember\nmore especially the description given by G. of the physical condition of the\nperson who was dying, and in this principally I can guarantee the fidelity\nof the narrative. At the next sitting another incident occurred tending to\nprove G.'s clairvoyant faculty, and of this Dr. Barcellos makes no mention.\nShe affirmed that, at the house where the patient had died, the man had an\naccess of suffocation (estava cumfalta de ar), and was fanning himself. It is\na fact that Dr. Barcellos was afterwards called to see him on that [very] day,\nand found, as he himself asserts, that [Senhor L., the person referred to,]\nhad symptoms of tachycardia. I had long known these people, but I am\nquite sure that G. had absolutely no knowledge of them ; nor did her doctor\ninform her that he was in attendance on the patient X.\nPassing [now] to other points in the narrative, I can also certify that G.\nwas not acquainted with the girl Ottilia ; nevertheless, everything happened\nin accordance with [Dr. Barcellos'] account. There was the same absence of\npersonal relations in the case of Carmen, whose death she finally foreboded\nafter wrongly supposing that the [girl] might be saved.\nI attach much importance to the incident that occurred when the boy\nLuiz was ill. For some days Dr. Barcellos had not come to hypnotise my\nwife. I therefore sent a mulatto boy to enquire whether he was unwell, and\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1897.\nthe messenger returned with the answer that it was the [doctor's] son who\nwas sick in bed. We received no more information [than this] on the subject ;\nnotwithstanding which, G. spoke of the danger that threatened the boy\nduring the ensuing night, saying that he would have symptoms of pernicious\nfever, and that he would be lost if the fever were not counteracted in time.\nAs the hour was late, and as I was doubtful whether this were not a mere\nfancy on the part of G., I could not make up my mind to warn Dr.\nBarcellos immediately. As is proved, however, by his declaration, my\nwife's prognosis was realised, and on the following morning, in conversation\nwith Donna Luiza, I obtained news of the boy's health. The references to\nG.'s. declaration, and to my conversation with Donna Luiza, are in\nsubstance correct.\nMy memory likewise allows me to confirm in a general manner the\nexactness of the details relative both to the sitting in which my friend Dr.\nBarcellos was warned of the approaching illness of his wife, and to those in\nwhich the somnambule accompanied at a distance the sickness of the girl\nCarmen.\nOther slight indications of the possession of supernormal faculties were\ngiven by G. in the course of the sittings. In her normal state she shows a\nretiring disposition, very different from the assurance [manifested] in her\ntrance. She has but few acquaintances, and she lives almost exclusively for\nher family and her domestic occupations. To judge from appearances, her\nwaking memory is\u2014at least in the majority of the [above] incidents \u2014\nunaware of what has occurred. A fortiori she ignores that her case is now a\nsubject of study for the psychical world.\n[Signed] F. J. db M*\nThe second proof of clairvoyance furnished by G. on the day\nfollowing the death of X. had escaped Dr. Barcellos' memory ; but\nhaving heard Senhor M.'s account, he now recalls and confirms the\ncircumstances as they are above narrated.\nSenhor M. believes that his wife was in her normal state when she\nwarned him of the crisis through which the boy Luiz was about to pass.\nHer first words on this occasion were, \" Why, I was already aware that\nhe was ill,\u2014and very ill.\" On the other hand, Dr. Barcellos thinks it\nlikely that the premonition was given during a momentary, though\nperhaps imperceptible, lapse into the trance. No reference is made in\nG.'s presence to these manifestations ; the supposition is that she has\nno remembrance of them, and this supposition is rather borne out by\nthe fact that she has made allusions to the more trivial events of some\nof the latter sittings.\nIt is in general very difficult to prove that the information shown\nby clairvoyants has not come to them through some normal channel.\n* The original deposition in Portuguese contains the full name and address of\nthis witness.\n\fJuly, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 113\nSenhor M., however, is quite sure that his wife could have no know\nledge of her own in regard to the situation of the house where Carmen\nlived. In her girlhood, long before Donna Maria Barcellos moved to\nMeyer, she had once passed through the place, but had never been\nthere since. G. in her waking state never enquired after the health of\nher doctor's niece, as she certainly would have done were she normally\naware of the girl's illness.\nI must now present further evidence bearing on G.'s version of the\ndeath in the Travessa Pepe. It will be recollected that, on the\noccasion of the syncope, a certain Dr. Sequeira Dias was, in the absence\nof the regular medical attendant, called in to see Donna X. His\ntestimony is contained in the following deposition :\u2014\nRua da Passagem, No. 13, Botafogo, Capital Federal,\nDecember 30th, 1896.\nOne night in March, 1895, at 10 o'clock, a Senhor L. came to call me in\nall haste to visit in the Travessa Pepe (District of Botafogo) the patient X.,\nwho is referred to in the narrative of Dr. Barcellos. He supposed that it\nwas merely some kind of fit,\u2014was quite sure [in fact] that it was an attack of\na hysterical nature. I had only time to seize my hat and follow him, and on\narriving I found X. still stretched on the ground and [in a] dying\n[condition]. We transported her at once to a canvas bed in the drawing-\nroom, where the unfortunate lady breathed her last.\nI can bear witness to the exactness of other particulars which, according\nto Dr. Barcellos, were mentioned by the somnambule : thus, X. was stout\nin person, although this embonpoint was characterised by flaccidity. There\nwere, indeed, by her side an elder daughter and two boys, who wept for the\nloss of their mother.\nThe patient suffered from anaemia consequent on a miscarriage ; hut she\nhad apparently recovered from the pleurisy on the left side, as I verified on\nthe occasion that the treatment of her medical attendant, Dr. Barcellos,\nconsisted in tonics.\nHaving thus arrived too late to render any assistance, I withdrew, and\non my way home I met Dr. Barcellos in front of his house. Before I could\ngive him the news of the unexpected decease of X., he told me that he knew\nshe had died, for he had been informed of the death by another patient of\nhis, [who was] in a state of somnambulism. We returned together to the\nTravessa Pepe in order to agree upon the diagnosis. We both concluded\nthat the cause of the decease was a cardiac syncope, which was in my\nopinion a direct consequence of the profound ansemia of the patient, whereas\nthe pleurisy from which she had suffered had merely predisposed her [to such\nan accident].\n[Signed] Dr. Carlos Calvet db Sequeira Dias.\nThe chemist of the Rua General Polydoro and his assistant also\ntestify that, before any confirmation of the death announced by the\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1897.\nsomnambule had been received, Dr. Barcellos told them that it had\nactually occurred and referred to the strange manner in which he had\nobtained his information. Senhor Henrique de Figueiredo says :\u2014\nRio de Janeiro, January 1st, 1897.\nOn the evening of the 19th of March, 1895, Senhor L. came to my shop\ntogether with Dr. Barcellos and carried away medicine (as shown on the\nprescription of that date) for the patient X., while Dr. Barcellos set out for\nthe house of Senhor M.\nAbout 10 o'clock on the same evening Senhor L. returned in search of\nthat doctor, and came into the shop with signs of agitation, saying that X.\nhad a fit\u2014that he thought she was dying\u2014that he did not know what it was.\nNot finding Dr. Barcellos, he proceeded to call Dr. Sequeira Dias.\nIt might have been, perhaps, half-an -hour later when Dr. Barcellos\nappeared again, having at that moment returned from Senhor M.'s house,\nand I at once told him that they had come from the Travessa Pepe to call\nhim in all haste. On hearing why he had been sent for, he exclaimed in the\ntone of one who surmises strongly something that yet needs confirmation,\n\" Then she is dead !\"\nI do not quite recollect whether it was before setting out for the\nTravessa Pepe, or afterwards, that he gave me a rapid account of the vision\nof the somnambule ; but I know that I sent a shop boy thither to discover\nwhether the obit had taken place or not.\nX. had an elder daughter, two small children and a son, who was old\nenough for military service on the occasion of the revolt.\n[Signed] Henrique de Figueiredo Correa.\nThe assistant's statement clears up a point which Senhor Henrique\nde Figueiredo leaves in doubt :\u2014\nRio de Janeiro, January 24Wi, 1897.\nAll that is affirmed by Senhor Henrique de Figueiredo Correa is true.\nIt is, moreover, certain that, as soon as Dr. Barcellos heard that they had\nsent for him from the Travessa Pepe, he not only exclaimed that the patient\nhad died, but also told us with some detail about the sitting held with the\nsomnambule. This was before he had verified whether the death had taken\nplace or not.\nI was the first to tell him that Senhor L. had come in all haste to call him.\n[Signed] Henrique Sauerbronn de Souza.\nOn different occasions I had heard the members of Dr. Barcellos'\nfamily allude to the facts certified by the foregoing witnesses, and that\nin such a manner as to corroborate them. A more formal enquiry\nwas, however, necessary, and on January 19th, 1897, I questioned\nthem, notebook in hand.\nDonna Luiza Barcellos confirms her husband's account of the circum\nstances of their son's illness. She supposes, however, that Senhor\n\fJuly, 1897.] Supernormal Phenomena. 115\nM. called to enquire after the patient about seven o'clock in the morn\ning. He began the conversation by saying \" I am already aware that\nthe boy has passed a very bad night,\" and then he proceeded to tell her\nhow his wife had predicted that the lad would have symptoms of per\nnicious fever and how she had added that he would die, were these\nsymptoms not counteracted in time.\nWith regard to her own sickness in 1895, she perfectly recollects\nthe sufferings through which she passed on the night of the musical\nparty, as well as her profuse perspiration and pain in the eyes after her\nremoval to Tijuca.\nIn further support of Dr. Barcellos' allegations respecting the\nlatter case, Donna Joanna Azambuja and the girls Henriqueta and\nEulalia affirm that they were told of G.'s premonition immediately\nafter it had been received, and before Donna Luiza had any symptoms\nof fever.\nTo this I must now add some evidence of my own. On the Sun\nday following this sitting, I met Dr. Barcellos in one of the Tijuca\nstreet-cars, and he at once related to me, with some vivacity, the par\nticulars of the prediction made by the somnambule. My memory does\nnot permit me to state whether his narrative, written at a much later\ndate, tallies in all points with the account then given by him, but I can\naffirm that, in the substance of the premonition, no alteration appears\nto have been made. I further recollect that I strongly advised him to\ntake his wife outside the city without delay.\nDonna Henriqueta guarantees the fidelity of the references made\nto the two sittings at which she was present. Having heard that part\nof the narrative that concerns her, and being questioned as to the\nactual words employed by G. when speaking of Carmen, she exclaimed,\n\" That is just what she said.\" As her memory is decidedly a good one,\nher corroboration is of value.\nNeither she nor the other ladies interrogated feel any permanent\ninterest in psychical phenomena.\nI subjoin to the above depositions two numbers of the Diario\nOfficial, giving the dates of the burial of Donna X. and Ottilia\nM. de O* The former, whose name I am not at liberty to publish, is\nshown to have been buried on March 20th, 1 895 ; the latter is men\ntioned in the obituary notice for April 23rd of the same year. This,\nagain, is the date of interment, which in this hot climate is rarely\ndelayed more than twenty-four hours after death,\n* These have been sent to us by Professor Alexander, and give the dates\nnamed.\u2014Ed.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1897.\nIn concluding the review of the phenomena observed in the case\nof this sornnambule, it must be recorded that an attempt to transmit\nto her telepathically a mental order resulted in complete failure. The\nexperiment was made on May 9th, 1895, it being afterwards verified\nthat G. was suffering at the time from a bad headache.\nTaking into consideration the whole of the evidence now presented,\nthere seems to be a strong presumption that in the three first premoni\ntory cases, G. really obtained some glimpse of the immediate future ;\nbut in her declarations concerning Carmen it is likely that her know\nledge was gathered directly from the mind of the operator. Thus, Dr.\nBarcellos has great faith in the employment of arsenic in the treatment\nof phthisis ; the sornnambule recommended arsenic as a sufficient\ntherapeutic agent. He was convinced against his desire that there was\nabsolutely no hope of saving Carmen ; the sornnambule first echoed his\ndesire and then his conviction. Nevertheless, for convenience' sake the\nnarrator, who recognises that in this instance mind-reading was\nprobably operative, has roughly classified the case according to its\npurport.\nThe facility with which somnambules evoke hallucinatory figures\nand hold converse with imaginary personages is well-known. Pre\nconceived ideas or the involuntary suggestions of the operator and others\nwill, in all probability, account for G.'s guardian angel and the invisible\nbeing who would not allow her to indicate the remedy for an incurable\ndisease. Dr. Barcellos is inclined to believe that, in a late instance,\none of these visions was suggested by a question put to her at a previous\nsitting.\nThere are reasons why Senhor L.'s corroboration of the case of\ntelepathic clairvoyance has not been obtained, and these have been\nexplained privately to Mr. Myers. I think it will be conceded that\nthe proofs adduced of the reality of this occurrence are sufficiently\nstrong as they stand.\nBALLECHIN HOUSE.\nIt has been brought to the notice of the Council that, in spite of a\ndisclaimer by the Honorary Secretary in the Times, (June 22nd), there\nis still an impression in certain quarters that the Society is responsible\nfor the hiring of Ballechin House, with a view to the investigation of\nphenomena alleged to occur there. The Council therefore desire to\nmake it known to all readers of the Journal that this impression is\naltogether erroneous.

PAOE\nObituary :-\u2014Richard Holt Hutton.\nEDITORIAL.\nThe change in the Editorship of the Journal affords a favourable\nopportunity for calling the attention of our members once more to\nsome of the ways in which they might render more efficient service\nto our investigation than they have hitherto done. The greater\npart of what the Society has already accomplished would have\nbeen impossible without the co-operation of a large number of\nindividuals in giving information and helping to furnish corroborative\ntestimony. Some of these have been Members of the Society anxious\nto further its aims in general, many others have been originally\nstrangers to its work, but ready to help through their own interest in\nthe subject. We recognise fully that there must always be many of\nour members who, for one reason or another, cannot participate in our\nactive work, and we are grateful for their continued financial support\nand should be glad to have their number largely increased by the\naddition of new members. We hope, however, that more of our\nmembers may be induced to offer some personal assistance either by\nmaking fresh experiments in thought-transference, automatic writing,\ncrystal-vision, etc., or by collecting testimony to what we have called\nspontaneous experiences. I incline to think that, with the expenditure\nof comparatively little effort on the part of each member, the material\nfor our examination, and possibly the evidence for supernormal\nphenomena, would be increased enormously.\nMany persons are under the misapprehension that we have already\ncollected as much material as we need on the line, for example, of\ntelepathy between the living ; but we have obviously not done so until\nwe have reached the stage where no reasonable person doubts the\nexistence of telepathy. The further collection of experimental evidence\nfor telepathy is of urgent importance, first for the sake of obtaining the\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1897.\ncompletest possible proof of the existence of that faculty, and also because\nit is only by dint of careful and varied experiment that the laws which\ngovern its manifestations are likely to be in some degree discerned. I\nmay add that the experiments which are of most value are those with\nagent and percipient at a distance from one another, of which so far\nwe have only a small number of cases. New and carefully recorded\nexperiments are therefore constantly needed ; and where spontaneous\nexperiences occur they should be recorded immediately, and especially\nif possible before verification, and all the corroborative testimony\nobtainable should be added. Although we have been dwelling upon\nthese points since the beginning of our investigation, I fear that our\nmembers as a body are still by no means alive to their importance.\nWe most earnestly desire fresh documentary cases. Not infrequently\nhave members and other persons interested in our work given me oral\naccounts of experiences of which contemporary records might have\nbeen made, and to my demand for the written testimony and my\nremonstrance on finding that it did not exist, the reply has been that\nthey supposed that we had abundance of such matter. We have not.\nWe need vastly more. And we make again a special appeal to our\nmembers to help us by being on the alert to record their own psychical\nexperiences immediately and also to secure the immediate record of all\nthat come under their notice, and to send such documents as soon as\npossible to the Secretary. It is a good plan to post accounts of such\nphenomena at once (to some friend of the writer's or to some officer of\nour Society) on letter-cards, so that the official stamp of the date of\nposting may be imprinted upon the letter itself.\nIt is for matter of this sort that we primarily ask, rather than for\nspeculative opinions, or for accounts of old incidents, not based on\ncontemporary notes. In the initial stages of our work, such laxer\nevidence was sometimes of use, since a mass of material was needed on\nwhich to base preliminary classifications. At the stage, however, that\nwe have now reached, the quality of the material is of even more\nimportance than its quantity. I would further remind members that\nthe Journal is open for comment and criticism upon articles which\nhave appeared in our Journal or Proceedings or elsewhere ; \u2014 such\ncriticism being of course the more valuable when it is itself supported\nby new and enlightening facts.\nOur members are aware that the printing of cases in the Journal\ndoes not necessarily imply that they are to be regarded as affording\nany proof of supernormal phenomena, but they will, we hope, assist the\nstudent in forming some judgment of our material, and lead to the\ncareful recording of fresh experiences. The cases that I propose to\n\fOct., 1807.] Editorial. 119\nprint in the next few issues of the Journal will be chiefly American,\nand I shall endeavour to choose such as may be instructive to those of\nour members who \"are willing to begin the work of collecting. I have\nbrought from America a batch of nearly 500 type-copied cases which\nhave been selected from a mass of material on file at the oflice of the\nAmerican Branch by Miss Edmunds, now Acting Secretary of the\nBranch, and according to the lists prepared for me by Miss Edmunds,\nthere are at least 279 of these which are lacking in one or more details\nof important corroborative testimony. This lack is usually owing to\nthe failure of witnesses to reply to our repeated enquiries, and although\nsometimes this failure results from a deliberate intention of refusal,\nin very many cases the testimony would have been forthcoming had the\nwitnesses been asked by those collecting the cases while the cases were\nfresh, or could they have been personally interviewed by our collector.\nSuch deficient cases can scarcely help us far to any reliable conclusion\nas regards the question of supernormal phenomena ; but unfortunately\nwe cannot yet tell, when we begin to investigate any particular case,\nwhether or not we shall succeed in getting the essential testimony.\nIn the United States, in consequence of the larger number, as I think,\nof cases to be dealt with, and the smaller number of active workers,\nwe have probably not been able to give nearly so much time to each\nindividual case as in England ; and the. greater distances in the States\nrender personal interviewing impossible in many instances unless the\nAmerican Branch were much more amply endowed with funds for\ntravelling expenses and had more workers in different parts of the\nStates who could give some time to the investigation.\nBut in the large mass of material collected in America, besides\nthat which primd facie points to the occurrence of supernormal\nphenomena, we have numerous files of cases, mostly in their original\nmanuscript form, which appear to me to be of no inconsiderable value\nin the general study of our subject, owing to their apparent affiliations\nto supernormal tendencies. Such cases are worthy of the full attention\nof the student of the special experiences which we designate as\nveridical, and frequently suggest the scattering shots that hit only the\nedge of the target or miss it altogether. This branch of our subject, I\nventure to think, although constantly before us as collectors in sifting\nthe matter sent to us, has hardly received sufficient attention in our\nJournal or Proceedings, and it seems to me fitting that some of this\n\" rejected \" matter should eventually find a place in the Journal, with\nappropriate comments.\nFor pecuniary reasons, it is at present undesirable to increase the\nsize of the Journal, but I am anxious that it should be, if possible,\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

A\" P\u00ab [A.B. 152.]\nThe first account of this case is taken from a letter by Mr. W. R.\nJewell, which appeared in The Philosophical Journal for October\n19th, 1895.\n. Dr. T. N. Bout is yet practising medicine in Lodi, 111., the\nleading doctor in that region, and one of the best and most reliable of men.\nIn December, 1874, the wife of Dr. T. N. Boue, of Lodi, 111., started\nto Jacksonville, Fla., for her health ; she was suffering from pulmonary\ntrouble, and Dr. Bout was much concerned about her, as she made the\ntrip alone.\nThe second evening after she started he lay down to rest a little, and\nbehold he saw his wife get off the train ; saw an old man meet her on a\nrickety platform, with a lantern, conduct her along a dark street to a little\nhotel, light a candle, lead the way up a narrow stairs, set the candle on a\nlittle table, and leave the room ; saw his wife follow into the room, sit\ndown upon a stool chair, look about the little room of dingy walls and\nnaked floor, with a heavy cheerless, homesick expression, and there the\nvision vanished.\nThe doctor at once told the writer about it, and we said, \"You\nwere asleep, and dreamed in your anxiety.\" He said, \"No, I was\nnot asleep, but as wide awake as ever in my life, and I just know that I\nsaw Effle as plain as ever in my life. She looked so tired and pitiful.\"\nThe doctor decided that he would not write her about the vision, but\nwait until she returned home, and see if she had stopped at such a time\nand place. When Mrs. Bout returned the next April, he asked her how\nshe happened to stop at such a place, as she had a sleeper. She at once\nasked him how he knew about it. He said, \" Never mind now, were you\ntired ?\" \"O very, very tired ; and when I got into the old hotel, and that\nlittle bare room, I was sick to the heart.\" In a word, all had happened just\nas the doctor saw in the vision to the smallest details. What makes this\nso very strange is that Dr. Bout never had a vision before or since, unless\nvery recently. He is an educated, matter-of-fact man ; he and I have often\ntalked of the vision since.\n\fOct., 1897.] Cases. 121\nMrs. Bou6 was a remarkably bright lady, excellently educated, true as\nthe needle to the pole. She died the next autumn (1875) of consumption,\nand often marvelled how it was possible for her husband to get just that\none brief but clear view of her over a distance of some hundreds of\nW. R.

Jewell had published some experience of mine in The Philosophical\nJournal of October 19th, is just to hand. I have not seen the publication,\nbut suppose the statements made by him are correct, as I had related the\n[incident] to him in person. If you will kindly send me a copy of the\njournal containing Jewell's statements, I will verify the accuracy of them\nunder my own signature. Courteously yours, T \"W T5 if\nI sent Dr. Bou6 a copy of Mr. Jewell's account, and he wrote\nagain as follows : \u2014\nLoda, 111., January 8th, 1896.\nMr. Jewell's account of my vision, published in the P. J., is practically\ncorrect. Instead of her walking to the hotel, she rode in an old rickety\nbus drawn by a pair of mules. The rest of his statement is absolutely\ncorrect.

Dr. G. is also a friend\nof mine.\nThere is a part of the story Miss Z. does not mention, which makes it\nyet more striking. It is that Mr. M., the husband of the woman who died,\nadmired Miss Z. extravagantly, and his wife probably knew of it. I should\nsay that in her last moments the woman reflected that if she died her\nhusband would try to marry Miss Z. It was probably with thoughts of\nhatred and jealousy in her mind that she breathed her last.\n[Mrs. C, Associate A. B.S.P.R.]\nFebruary tth, 1896.\nI dreamed that a woman came to my bedside, and I thought she was\ngoing to kill me. In my terror I arose and pushed her away with all my\nstrength, although the woman seemed too weak to resist. While always\ndreading to hurt anyone either mentally or physically, my terror seemed to\ncompletely change me, and I pushed her through the next room, through a\nclosed and locked door to the head of the stairs, down which I intended to\nthrow her. When we reached the stairs she vanished and I fled back to my\nroom through the closed door. I looked at the clock in my dream and saw\nit was twenty minutes past two. At that moment I awoke and feeling\nuncanny over the dream, pulled a cord I had attached to the gas and turned\nup the light. To my surprise the clock showed just twenty minutes past two.\nThat morning on my way to business I met our physician, Dr. G. , to\nwhom I told the dream and the incident about the time.\nMiss S. and Mr. M. w<?re friends whom I met each morning in the train.\nMr. M. was not in the train that morning, and the following morning Miss S.\ntold me that she had heard that Mr. M. 's wife had died the night before the\nlasi (The night of my dream. ) I asked at what time, and Miss S. said ' ' about\ntwenty minutes after two.\" I had never seen Mrs. M., but Miss S. had\nmet her, and when 1 asked Miss S. to describe Mrs. M., she quite accurately\ndescribed the woman I had seen in my dream. TMis 7 1\nN. Y., February 4th, 1896.\nI well remember meeting Miss Z. the morning after her dream, which\nshe narrated to me, before there was any possibility of her having knowledge\nof the death of Mrs. M., whom she did not know and had never seen.\nIndeed her illness was unknown to Miss Z. [PPr Mill\nNew York, March Uth, 1896.\nDear Dr. Hodgson, \u2014You remember the dream in which my friend,\nMiss Z., saw a dying woman enter her room in an exceedingly hostile\n\fOct, 18H7.] Cases. 123\nmanner at the very moment when, by the clock, the woman died. You will\nalso remember that you asked me the date of the dream. Fortunately I can\ngive the exact date, since Miss Z. recorded the curious dream in her journal,\nwhere it stands to this day. The date was the early hours, soon after\nmidnight, of November 10, 1890.\nYou asked me what additional evidence I could give as to Mr. M.'s\nadmiration for Miss Z. There fortunately too the evidence is clear. . . .\nBefore I was acquainted with Miss Z. I used to see her month after month\ngoing down to business in the elevated train with myself, in the morning.\nShe was a very attractive looking girl, with a refined sweet face. That drew\nme to her at first. Then I used to see the man, many years older than\nherself, hovering around her, keeping a seat for her when the train was\ncrowded, and fairly straining himself to do the agreeable to her. It was so\nplain as not to be mistaken. She on the other hand was polite, indifferent,\nand looked, on the surface of things, as if she wished him anywhere else.\nThe performance regularly repeated went on under my eyes so plainly that\nI speedily \" caught on,\" as we Yankees say, to the situation. .\n[Mrs. C]\nNew York, March 28th, 1896.\nDear Dr. Hodgson, \u2014. . . I have seen in Miss Z.'s journal the record\nof the death of Mrs. M. I was, however, mistaken if I told you the vision was\nrecorded there. The morning of the vision Miss Z. told Dr. G. of it. You\nhave Dr. G. 's testimony to this effect. When shortly afterwards she heard\nof the death of Mrs. M. at the very moment when her dream occurred, she\nthought the coincidence so remarkable she recorded the date of the woman's\ndeath in her journal. The dream or vision, therefore, she gave you from\nmemory, the record of the death from her journal. The death happened to\nbe recorded only because she learned it took place at the moment of her\ndream. At the time she told Dr. G. of the dream she had not heard of\nMrs. M.'s death. . . .

Perhaps I have told you before\nthat I have had a great many such or hallucinations, but I am reminded of\none which happened last summer. I was a lecturer at Greenacre, Me.,\nwhere Miss Farmer, daughter of the late electrician, Moses G., had a\nsummer hotel and many of the prominent occult folks of the country\ngathered. I stopped for the night at the house of Miss Farmer\u2014the old\nhomestead. During the night I dreamed that Mr. Farmer was in the room\nand talked with me, though I couldn't see him. I said to him, \"How shall\nI know it is you, and not some one else ? \" He replied, \" I'll show you my\nhand \" ; so his left hand was extended to me, and I took hold of it. It was\nvery cold and made me so shudder that I was at once awakened. I found\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1K97.\nmyself uneasy and turned over in bed, to ease my uncomfortableness.\nDirectly I slept again and dreamed over the same occurrence ; when\nfarmer showed his hand, I asked him how I should know it to be his hand.\nHe replied, \" I'll move my fingers so,\" and he straightened out his first and\nthird fingers, while the second and fourth were bent in a very uncommon\nway. I can't move my fingers in such positions without the aid of the other\nhand. After that the \" seance \" ended, and I forgot all about it, till next\nmorning at breakfast with Miss P., I chanced to recall it and told her I had\ndreamed of her father and I related the above to her ; when I came to the\nfinger business she dropped her fork, and with much earnestness said,\n\"That was one of his tricks. He could get the fingers of his left hand into\nuncommon positions, and for the amusement of visitors and intimate\nacquaintances would do it.\" 1 never knew he had any such trick, so I was\nsurprised. I recorded the above facts the same day. Those whom I told\nand especially Miss F., who were Spiritualists, seemed sure I had had a\nvisit from Mr. Farmer. ... A E DoLBEAE\nTufts College, Mass., April 18th, 1895.\nDr. R. Hodgson,\u2014 Dear Sir,\u2014I had met Mr. Farmer two or three\ntimes. Was not intimately acquainted, and have no recollection of ever\nseeing him do any kind of a trick or indeed that he could do any. Each\ntime when I did meet him it was on electrical business, and I knew nothing\nabout him socially. It does not seem probable to me that I ever saw him\ntwist his fingers in any way. ... A E DoLBEAR.\nMiss Farmer writes as follows to Professor James in corroboration\nof Professor Dolbear's statement :\u2014\nEliot, Maine, June 15th, 1896.\n. My father had great regard for his friend [Prof. Dolbear], and\nrespect for his valuable contributions to science. After reading his book.\nMatter, Ether and Motion, he said, ''I would like to talk with Dolbear and\ntell him some of the experiences that have come to us since mother went, and\n.see what he would say to them.\" . . . Callers coming in, the subject\nwas dropped.\nIn 1894 Prof. Dolbear kindly consented to become one of the speakers at\nGreenacre. The inn being full, I took him to Bittersweet, and he occupied\nthe library chamber. In course of conversation the next morning, he said,\n\" I had a strange dream last night\u2014 I dreamed of your father.\" That did\nnot seem strange, as he had looked at his life-size portrait before retiring. I\nasked about the dream and he said he dreamed he heard his voice and was\ntold it was my father. He asked how he should know it was he. The reply\nwas, \"I will show you my left hand and arm,\" and he did so twice. The\nProfessor still questioned \" How shall I know it is your hand and arm rather\nthan someone else's?\" The reply was, \"I will show you a trick with my\nfingers,\" and then the Professor described and tried to imitate it, but could\nnot. I was dumb with astonishment and then said, \" Why, Professor, that\nwas a favourite trick of my father's. When tricks were performed, he\n\fOct., 189;.]i Cases. 125\nwould say, 'Who can do this,' and then, without using the right, would\nbend the joints and twist the fingers of the left hand in a way that I never\nsaw imitated. \" That to me was a positive proof of my father's identity ; it\nwas like him\u2014he liked a joke. He longed to be able to share with his\nfriends the conviction of truth which had come to him. He knew that with\nProf. Dolbear no proof would be convincing unless of the most unique\ncharacter. The Professor said he was wakened and lay for a time thinking\nof it ; then fell asleep and dreamed the same thing again. He was much\npleased with my corroboration of the circumstance and said he would\nwillingly travel sixty miles for an experience like that. In 1895 he came to\nGreenacre a second time and at dinner with Rev. E. P. Powell, of Clinton,\nNew York, in speaking of my father, used these words, \" I talked with him\nlast summer.\" Knowing that my father had passed out in 1893, Mr.\nPowell was mystified, and I said, \"Professor, Mr. Powell does not under\nstand how that can be, you should explain yourself. \" He then related his\ndream. I listened carefully and noted that the story was just as he had\ngiven it the year before.\nI omitted one circumstance of 1894. Coming from the tent after the\nlecture, I met Dr. J. L. M. Willis, my father's physician, and a very\nintelligent man. I presented him to Prof. Dolbear and then said, \"Do\nyou remember, Doctor, of any especial trick that my father could do with\nhis hands?\" He answered, \"No, I do not know of any except this.\" He\nthen put up his left hand and trying to cross his fingers said, \" I can't do it\n\u2014I never saw anybody else who could.\" . . .\nSarah J.

B. 168.]\nThe following account appeared in The Metaphysical Magazine for\nJuly, 1896, under the title \"A Remarkable Occurrence,\" by Mr. H.\nClay Neville, who wrote to us from the office of a local paper called\nthe Christian Co. Republican, and has given us some assistance in\ncollecting evidence about the case.\nThe following story, strange as it may appear, is true in every detail, and\nthe facts could easily be proved in any court of law.\nIn October, 1890, T. B. Garrison, now of Ozark, Mo., was a miller at\nFordland, on the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Southern Railroad. He was\nthen thirty years old and married. About ten o'clock one evening, while\nattending a religious meeting, the miller was seized with an irresistible\nimpulse to see his mother. Though left in charge of their infant child,\nwhile his wife, one of the converts, went to the altar, Mr. Garrison made no\ndelay. Giving the child to a friend who stood near, he hurriedly left the\nchurch.\nStopping at his home to explain his departure, Mr. Garrison was strongly\nurged by his mother-in-law to abandon his unreasonable determination.\nBut he was deaf to all opposition.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1897.\nThe widowed mother lived with Mr. Garrison's sister in a log cabin\nnear Ozark, about eighteen miles west of Fordland. Before Mr. Garrison\nreached the station, the train which would have taken him eight miles of\nhis journey had steamed away in the darkness. No thought of turning\nback, however, entered the man's mind. He started at once to walk the\nentire distance, following the railroad to Rogerville (ten miles east of his\nmother's home), and then a wagon road leading down the slope to Ozark.\nAs he travelled this lonely path his thoughts were constantly with his\nmother\u2014not with any apprehension of sickness or danger, but he felt\nstrongly drawn toward her.\nAbout three o'clock in the morning Mr. Garrison reached her cabin.\nThe door was fastened, as usual, with latch and string. Passing his knife-\nblade through the string-hole, he lifted the latch, thus effecting an entrance\nwithout waking his sister. He called his mother, and receiving no answer\nbecame alarmed. The second call aroused his sister. A candle was then\nlighted, and an examination disclosed the startling fact that the mother had\nbeen dead for some time !\nMrs. Garrison had retired about ten o'clock the night previous, feeling\nas well as usual, though not in robust health. During the day she had\nattended the funeral of a neighbour ; but otherwise nothing out of the\nordinary routine had occurred. The cabin consisted of one room only, but\nmother and daughter slept in separate beds. The younger woman heard no\nstruggle in the night, and, had it not been for her brother's strange visit,\nwould probably have slept till day.\nThe above facts have been much discussed, and a few days after Mrs.\nGarrison's death the St. Louis Globe-Democrat published a full account of\nthe affair.\nH. Clay Neville.\nMr. Garrison writes :\u2014\nGardner and Garrison, Dealers in Fancy and Family Groceries.\nOzark, Mo., July 29th, 1896.\nMr. Richard Hodgson, \u2014Dear Sir, \u2014Answering your letter of July\n15th in regard to my experience connected with the death of my mother, I\nwill make the following statement. My mother, Nancy J. Garrison, died ,\non Friday night, October 4th, 1888, at her home three miles north-east of\nOzark, Christian County, Missouri. She was 58 years old. I was then\nliving at Fordland, in Webster County, Missouri, about 18 miles north-east\nof my mother's home. I had not seen my mother for two months at the\ntime of her death, but had heard from [her] by letter from week to week.\nOn the night of my mother's death there was a meeting in Fordland, and\nmyself and wife attended the preaching. We had then one child, a baby a\nyear old. The meeting had been going on a week or more. About ten\no'clock, just before the meeting closed, while the congregation was singing,\nI felt the first desire to see my mother. The thought of my mother was\nsuggested by the sight of some of the penitents at the altar, who were very\nwarm and sweating. My mother was subject to smothering spells, and\n\fOct., 18U7.] Cases. 127\nwhile suffering from these attacks she would perspire freely and we had\nto fan her. In the faces of the mourners I seemed to see my mother's\nsuffering. And then the impulse to go to her became so strong that I gave\nthe baby to a neighbour-woman and left the church without telling my wife.\nShe was in another part of the house.\nThe train going west which would have taken me [to] Rogersville, seven\nmiles of the distance to my mother's place, was due at 10.30 p.m., but before\nI got home and changed my clothes and returned to the depot, the cars had\nleft the station. I still felt that I must see my mother and started down to\nrailroad track alone, and walked to Rogersville. Here I left the railroad\nand walked down the wagon way leading from Marshfield to Ozark, Mo.\nIt was about 3 o'clock a.m. when I reached my mother's house. I knocked\nat the door two or three times and got no response. Then I kicked the\ndoor, but still made no one hear me. At last I opened the door with my\nknife and walked in and lighted a lamp. Then my sister, Mrs. Billie Gilley,\nthe only person who had been living with my mother, awoke and I asked her\nwhere mother was. She replied that she was in bed, and I said \" She is\ndead,\" for by that time I felt that she could not be alive. She had never\nfailed to wake before when I had entered the room at night.\nI went to my mother's bed and put my hand on her forehead. It was\ncold. She had been dead about three hours the neighbours thought from\nthe condition of her body. She had gone to bed about ten o'clock at night,\nfeeling better than usual.

My mother (Mrs. Butcher) was at the house. When\nhe started he left word with her telling me he had gone to see his mother,\nbut I could hardly believe it, it being such a strange time to start such a\ndistance.

A\u00ab Ps [A.B. 169.]\nThe first account which follows is taken from an article on\n\"Dreams,\" by Miss Giddings, which appeared in The Metaphysical\nMagazine for September, 1895.\nSome few years ago I was the guest in the home of an intimate friend,\nwhose unmarried sister, also an associate of my own, was away at the\ntime. My hostess, whom I will call Mrs. J., was taken suddenly and\nseriously ill. The family doctor was summoned, but as he was away, a\nstrange physician was called, and he was in attendance upon Mrs. J. when\n\fOct., 1897.] Cases. 129\nat midnight her own doctor arrived. Early on the following morning I\nreceived a telegram from the absent sister, saying : \"Is anything wrong at\nhome? Answer immediately.\" I replied, and before the day was over, a\nletter addressed to me, and mailed when the telegram was sent, came from\nthe absent sister, saying :\u2014\n\"I have had a peculiar and impressive dream of home. I saw A.\nlying on the bed as if very ill ; while in the dressing-room, as if in con\nsultation, were two doctors \u2014Dr. L. (the family physician), and a stranger,\na tall, dark man, whom Dr. L. addressed as Dr. Rice. So impressed am I\nthat something is wrong that I write to you in order to know as soon as\npossible the meaning of this strange vision.\"\nHer dream was as vivid a portrayal of what was actually occurring at\nher home during the night, as I, personally present, could have given.\nShe was almost correct as to the name of the strange doctor, whom she\nheard addressed as Dr. Rice, but whose name was Reed. It will he offered\nin explanation that she was anxious about home, and naturally dreamed of\nher sister. But this explanation will not suffice, for she was a girl much\naway from home. The married sister was never ill, and no member of the\nfamily had ever seen or heard of the strange physician. That the sick\nsister was thinking of the absent one I know. She was a woman of deter\nmined will and of unusual magnetic power, as her success as a public\nspeaker attests. May she not, through her desires, have unconsciously\nthrown upon the mind of the absent one certain photographic revelations\nof what was actually occurring 1\nMiss Giddings writes :\u2014,\n37, Walnut street, Somerville, Mass. , January 8th, 1896 .\nDr. Richard Hodgson, \u2014Dear Sir, \u2014. . . The dream related\noccurred to my friend Mabel Jenness, at a time when her sister, Annie\nJenness Miller, the well-known lecturer on \"Dress,\" was ill at her New\nYork residence. The facts are as I have related them.\nI was at that time editing Mrs. Miller's magazine, and the letter to which\nreference is made came to me. I did not keep it, but Mabel Jenness, now\nMrs. Win.

I will endeavour to give you as nearly as possible the\nfacts concerning the \"vision\" of which Miss Giddings has told you. I was\nin the West on a lecture tour, and the last night of my stay in Detroit,\nMich. , I had a dream in which I saw my sister, Mrs. Miller, lying ill.\nThere were several people about her, and all was excitement. There were\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1897.\ntwo physicians in consultation ; one I recognised as Dr. Louis Sayer, of\nNew York, (now deceased), the other I did not recognise, but his name\ncame to me as Rice. In appearance this man was above medium height,\nvery slender, and had dark side-beard.\nThe exact date of this experience I cannot give, but I should say it was\nabout the middle of December, 1889. The dream greatly impressed and\nannoyed me. I tried to put it from me, but it persistently recurred to my\nthought\u2014a haunting fear. I could not make it seem a dream, and after several\nhours I sent the telegram to which Miss Giddings referred. The message was\nsent from Ypsilanti, Mich., at about noontime, on a Monday (I remember well\nthe day of the week) ; the answer to it was received at about 9.30 o'clock in\nthe evening of the same day. That which to me was a dream actually\noccurred in detail while I was dreaming ; and the physician who was in\nreality in attendance with Dr. Sayer was the embodiment of the one in my\n*' vision,\" but his name was Ried, instead of Rice as I dreamed.\nI have had other and similar experiences, but none so authentic. The\nothers I cannot prove to have happened.\nMabel Jenness Venter\nMrs. Miller writes :\u2014\nSt. Denis Hotel, N.Y., February 1st, 1896.\nMr. Richard Hodgson, \u2014Dear Sir, \u2014. . . The dream experience\nrelated by Miss Giddings occurred just as related in her article. The date\nof the illness was December, '89. She was my guest at the time, and con-,\nsequently knew the details.\nWhen my sister's telegram arrived, Dr. Louis Sayer (he died\nimmediately afterward) was sitting upon the side of my bed, and I\nremember that he was profoundly impressed by the enquiry, knowing it\nthe result of a psychological impression received from a dream. . . .\nA. Jenness Miller.\nL. 1093. A* P\u00ab\nThe following account was sent to us by Mrs. Knight, of\nHeathlands, Malvern Wells. It was written immediately after the\nincidents described, as explained below.\nI was staying at Udny Castle, in Aberdeenshire, on a visit, and was going\non for another visit to Lytham, in Lancashire, on the 18th of September, 1895.\nT had wished Mr. and Mrs. Udny and the friends in the house good-bye\nwhen I went to bed, knowing I should have to make a very early start in the\nmorning So I had the curtains drawn and the shutters shut to make the\nroom dark and to get a good night's sleep.\nBut I woke up with the feeling of being gently wakened ; I was\nswayed, or rather rocked backwards and forwards, till I felt the bed to see if\nthat were moving, and then I was gently and quietly raised up. The air\nfluttered over my head, a shimmering light came, and I felt some one was\ndetained, lingering and hovering over me. To myself, 1 said : \"Some one\nis dying ; some one I know is leaving this world and blessing me \" ; and\n\fOct., 1897.] Cases. 131\nthen the hovering and the fluttering were greater. Then, aloud, as if some\none were willing me (for I never speak aloud to myself) I said : \" If dear\nMed were here she would tell me at once who it is.\" As if in answer came\na rap by the head of my bed, a rap I have never heard before, and was\ncertainly not made by human hands. I jumped out of bed, and said, \"Who\nam I to see 1 \" I lit my candle, and looked at my watch, and it was seven\nminutes past three. I put the candle out, and was getting into bed, when I\nthought, \" How can I rest while a soul I know is passing from this world ? \"\nand I knelt down and said a prayer for the soul. I never thought it was my\ndear nurse, Mrs. Medley, whom I always called \" Med,\" but I thought of a\nfriend I knew in Warwickshire.\nAfter I got into bed and put the candle out, there was a light I cannot\ndescribe all round my bed. It was a silvery radiance, and as it passed away\nflashes of gold and gold stars fell. About five I went to sleep for half-\nan-hour, but woke up with my hand on my neck trying to take off a flat\nblack insect. . . . One seemed on my forehead, one on my neck, and I\nsaid again aloud : \"This is dear Med's Death Dream ; how interested she\nwill be to hear it. Who could have died this morning ? \" Mrs. Medley had\nalways told me that dreaming of insects on the head and neck was a certain\nsign of death, and I never liked her saying this, but never believed it.\nI was travelling from 6.30 that morning, and arrived at Lytham about\n8 p.m., when I was met at the station by my friend, with a telegram in her\nhand, saying, \"My dear, I have very sad news for you.\" And I answered,\n\"Then it was dear Med.\" And she said, \"Oh, I am so glad you were\nprepared. We feared from the telegram it would be such an awful shock to\nyou.\" I answered, \"I was not prepared, only I know it all now.\"\nI took the first train in the next morning to Malvern Wells, where we\nwere living, and at that station was met and told my dear nurse had died at\nthree. I said, \"No, it was later.\" On arriving at the house my sister said\nshe had looked at the watch, and the hands were between five and ten\n.minutes past three. It was seven minutes past three when I looked at my\nwatch on that morning.\nThe day before she had been very well, and my sisters had taken her for\na drive round Upton-on-Severn, but she was constantly talking of me, and\nsaying, \" I am not happy about Etta. She is not well ; I want to see her.\"\nI had not said in any letters that I was not well, but I had not been\nvery well.\nShe was the dearest and- truest friend I have ever had, or ever can have.\nShe was my sisters' and my nurse, and had been in my father's service before\nI was born. . . . Henrietta Knight.\nIn a letter to Mr. Myers, enclosing the account, Mrs. Knight\nwrites : \u2014\nHeathlands, Malvern Wells, April 20M, [1897.]\n. . . I was so afraid of imagining or forgetting, that the day I arrived\nhome I wrote the bare facts, which I have copied for you. I have simply\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1897.\ncopied what I wrote down. I could not express the wonderful light, or the\nabsence of fear ; and I am naturally a nervous person. The whole of the\nday before she died she was talking of me, and her sister said if she were\npermitted to see any one, she knew she would ask to see me. At 5 o'clock\nshe was taken giddy and sick, but my sisters never thought death was near.\nAt 5 o'clock I had a most curious sensation, and could not work or read.\nThe Castle was full of people, and they laughed at me for not joining them\nas usual, and going out in the gardens ; and I could not say why, but I\ncould not have gone, and I could not describe my feeling. Only that\nmorning I had had a letter saying how well she was, so I was not thinking\nof her. The love between her and me was greater than the love of many a\nmother and child. . . .\nHenrietta Knight.\nOBITUARY.\nRICHARD HOLT HUTTON.\nBy the death of Mr. R. H. Hutton, Editor of the Spectator, etc.,\nour Society loses one of its original Vice-Presidents, and several of our\nmembers lose an honoured friend. Mr. Hutton's interest in some\npart at least of our field of enquiry was of old standing, and went\ndeep. It rested on the religious rather than on the scientific instinct.\nThe Christian religion was to him a dominant reality ; and he felt that\nsince a spiritual world had thus been revealed, it was reasonable, it\nwas consonant with what he deemed the design of the Creator, that\nfresh manifestations thereof should be from time to time vouchsafed ;\nthat to them who knock it should be opened ; that they who seek\nshould find. With this underlying thought, and with a mind at once\nmeditative and eager, he followed with a friendly, though not an\nanxious, interest the main steps of our work ; \u2014his own convictions\nmeanwhile independent of any results which we might or might not\nattain. A talk with him was a valued privilege ; whether agreement\nwere more or less complete, there was no man whose cordiality was\nmore whole-hearted,\u2014no man who gave a stronger impression of a life\npassed in serious thought, a spirit long trained to duty.\nOne more has gone from us of that small band of men \u2014not easily\nto be replaced\u2014who gathered round our work in its first beginnings,\nand gave the sense of a reserve of forces ; \u2014of friends behind us whose\napproval was for us no slight satisfaction, no trifling gain.\nF.W.

Morse, daughter of the late Wm. J. McKinney, of this\ncity, born in Dayton, fifty-three years ago, was buried in Woodland\nyesterday. She died at Delaware Watergap, Pa., last Friday.\nDeceased graduated from Cooper Seminary, this city, under Dr. Victor\nL. Conrad, and a few years later married and moved East. She had been\nquite sick for some time, but her family and friends did not realise her\ndanger until a few hours before she passed away. She was conscious up to\nthe last, and died with a sweet smile upon her face for brothers and sisters\nwho were around her bedside.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1897.\nThe next letter contains further information concerning the\ndream of Mr. Morse :\u2014\n46, E. 21st St., New York, September 1st, 1897.\nDear Dr. Hodgson, \u2014I have had a conversation with Mr. Morse about\nhis dream regarding the death of his wife. The dream appears to have been\nsymbolical. He dreamed he was dressed in mourning and taking a long\njourney on the cars. He felt when he awoke that it related to his wife,\nand that she was already dead. About a month previously he had another\ndream in which he saw his wife come to his bedside with a clock in her\nhands.

His brother-in-law is Mr. \u2014 McKinney.\nIt seems that another brother-in-law and sister-in-law were with Mrs. Morse\nwhen she died, as the enclosed letter from Dr. Hurd shows. This letter\nalso shows that a telegram was sent to Mr. McKinney in New York, and\nthis agrees with what Mr. Morse states, but the question of telegrams seems\nrather mixed, and I have not had time to unravel it.\nI enclose Dr. Hurd's letter. I wrote to Mr. McKinney of Dayton, a\nthird brother-in-law, regarding his seeing a phantom of his sister about the\nsame time, but have had no reply. ...

On her arrival\nfrom Philadelphia, she was very much exhausted ; had persisted in riding,\nsitting up and walking ; would not allow herself to be helped as she should\nhave been. She went to her bed and scarcely sat up any after ; gradually\ngrew weaker, pulse became rapid, temperature developed. The last 24\nhours her pulse ran from 120 to 135 and 140 ; slept a good deal ; did not\nwish any food. Her fingers and nails, as well as her toes, seemed to have\nno arterial blood, \u2014 dark blood settled under the nails. This I noticed the\nnext morning after she arrived. She came on Wednesday, arriving a little\nafter one o'clock, with Mr. McKinney and her sister. She steadily failed.\nOn Friday morning, noting no improvement in the temperature or general\nstrength, and the heart-beat being from 135 to 140, I told her sister that it\nseemed impossible for her to hold out very long unless there was a marked\n\fNov., 1897.] Cases. 139\nimprovement within a few hours, and I told her I thought Mrs. Morse could\nnot live more than 24 hours.

Mr. McKinney told me\non his arrival at 4-04 that he tried to find Mr. Morse, but after trying in\nseveral directions he failed. He telegraphed to him after getting to Water\nGap. They had no word from him before their departure. She passed\naway at 9.15 in the evening, peacefully, and without a struggle, though\nhalf-an-hour before suffered considerably with pain about the heart. The\nbody was taken from the house to the undertaker's before twelve o'clock,\nand the friends left for New York with the body the next morning, leaving\nhere about nine o'clock and taking the 12 \"01 train from Stroudsburg.\nMr. McKinney telegraphed again to Mr. Morse Saturday morning about\n7.30 to his home and business addresses. . . .\nF.

See also the article by Dr.\nMason in the Journal S.P.R. for December, 1894. Dr. Mason wrote\non January 9th, 1896, concerning Miss Luke : \"I have two or three\nrecent dreams or night visions and their fulfilment of which she told\nme only a few days since ; and which can be dated and substantiated.\"\nThe statement was finally sent apparently in September, 1896.\nMiss Mary Luke, 202, Hudson-street, New York City, the percipient in\nthe following cases of veridical dreams, has been very well known to me for\nmore than fifteen years, I having been the attending physician in the\nfamily during that time. Her own health, however, has been almost\nperfect ; she is free from all hysterical or nervous symptoms ; in fact, I\nhave hardly had occasion to prescribe for her during this whole period.\nShe is a busy, energetic, self-reliant, but very kind-hearted woman, now\nnearly 40 years of age, though looking at least ten years younger. She is\nunmarried.\nShe has from childhood been an inveterate somnambulist, walking almost\nevery night, until two years ago when I hypnotised her and suggested that\nshe should not again leave her bed in her sleep. The effect was prompt\nand decided. She has never since that time walked nor even left her bed\nwhile asleep.\nShe is exceedingly impressionable, and seldom fails to receive definite\nand true ideas and impressions regarding people who come into her presence\nor with whom she sits\u2014a faculty which she often exercises, but never for\nany remuneration. On one occasiou a few years ago she varied from this\nrule, for charity. Being on a visit in a distant country village where she\nwas quite unknown, during a church fair she was asked to occupy the gipsy\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The first day she\nhad the usual share of patronage, but on the second day\u2014the accuracy of\nher delineations having become the talk of the town\u2014there was a constant\nstream of visitors to her tent, and more than 300 dollars were realised for\nthe charity.\nShe has had a large number of veridical dreams, but she was so ridiculed\nby her family on account of them that she seldom told them, especially\nnot before their fulfilment, so they are not available for the Society for\nPsychical Research.\nWithin the past two years, however,\" since I have known something of\nher psychic experiences, the two dreams here related have occurred, and\nfortunately they were related before the events were known. The first I\nhave named :\u2014\nL. 1095. Ae P<* I.\u2014The Robbery.\nand I will give it substantially in her own language, as I took it down while\nshe related it. I will premise that she occupies a three-storey and basement\nhouse. Her sister, Mrs. S., with her family, occupies the third floor ; she\nrents the second floor to lodgers, and uses the first floor and basement for\nher own business. The second floor front, over her parlour, was occupied\nby a man and his wife, named L. , who had been with her six months ; they\nseemed very pleasant people, and she had no occasion to mistrust their\nhonesty. The back room on the same floor was occupied by Mr. B., who\nhad been her tenant for six years.\nShe goes on to say : \u2014\nOn Wednesday, August 28th, 1895, I had been absent all day ; I came in\nlate in the evening and went directly to bed. I noticed nothing out of the\nway excepting that I missed a small and rather pretty alarm clock from the\nparlour mantel ; I supposed, however, that my lodger Mr. B. had taken it,\nas he sometimes did if he wished to be aroused at a particular hour, and I\nthought no more about it.\nThat night I dreamed or rather seemed to see Mr. and Mrs. L.'s room in\ngreat disorder ; Mr. and Mrs. L. were gone and everything belonging to\nthem, and also everything of mine which was valuable was gone, and the\nhouse was robbed of valuables generally. The scene of the room was very\nvivid and exact.\nIn the morning I went directly up to my sister's apartment and asked\nher, \"When have you seen Mrs. L. 1\" She replied, \"She was up here\nwith me at three o'clock yesterday afternoon ; she brought up some refresh\nments and was particularly agreeable.\" I said at once, \"I dreamed last\nnight that she had gone and had robbed the house of its valuables, and had\nleft the room in great disorder. \" My sister had not seen either of them nor\nheard any sound in their room after three o'clock. My sister, who had\nalways been inclined to laugh at my dreams, exclaimed, \" Your dreams are\nso queer, M., I cannot help feeling anxious.\" I went down to my own apart\nment on the first floor and listened for sounds of people moving overhead,\n\fNov., 1897.] Cases. 141\nbut all was silent. I then went up to their room and rapped repeatedly, but\ngot no reply. I then used my duplicate key and opened the door. The\nroom was unoccupied and in great disorder ; all their own property\ntogether with everything of value belonging to me had disappeared, and the\nroom presented the exact appearance in every respect that I had seen in my\ndream.\nAn examination of the house directly afterwards showed that they had\ntaken all my jewellery and trinkets and the little clock which I had missed\nthe evening before. They had also taken a suit of new clothes and an\numbrella from the room of their neighbour B. on the same floor.\nMiss Luke adds :\u2014\nThis is a perfectly correct account of my dream and its fulfilment.\nMary Luke.\nMrs. Stallings' Statement.\n202, Hudson Street, New York, September 7th, 1896.\nMy sister Mary, known in Dr. Mason's statement as M.L., came upstairs\non Thursday morning, August 29th, 1895, and said to me, \" When have you\nseen Mrs. L. ?\" I said, \"Not since three o'clock yesterday. She was\nup here then, brought some refreshments and was very agreeable.\" Mary\nthen said, \" I dreamed last night that she had gone and had stripped the\nhouse of everything valuable. I saw the room empty and in disorder \u2014\neverything valuable was taken away, both hers and mine. I have not heard\na sound from them overhead this morning.\" I said, \"Your dreams are so\nqueer, Mary, I can't help feeling anxious.\" She went downstairs and soon\nafter went into the room and found it empty ; everything valuable was\ntaken. Afterwards it was found that she had taken my sister's jewellery and\ntrinkets and also a suit of clothes and an umbrella from a lodger on the\nsame floor.

Regarding tracing the robbery, Miss\nLuke went to the office of the detective force, where she was treated so\nindifferently because there was \" nothing in it \" for them, that she surprised\nthem by giving them a piece of her mind and walked out.

A\" Ps II.\u2014The Two Weddings.\nI relate it very much in her own language :\u2014\nOn Wednesday, November 27th, 1895, the day before Thanksgiving, I\nwent out to Coscoh, in Connecticut, about 30 miles from New York, to spend\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nor., 1897.\nThanksgiving with a friend. On Thanksgiving day I returned to Brooklyn\n(still seven or eight miles from home) to spend the night with my friend\nMrs. La Forge.\nDuring the night I dreamed that I was in the church of St. John in\nVanck Street sitting in a pew the situation of which I very well remember.\nIt is a pleasure to me to attend Church weddings for the sake of the music\nand pleasant surroundings. After waiting a little the organ commenced\nplaying and presently the wedding procession came up the aisle. I enjoyed\nthe music, flowers, and pretty dresses. The ceremony was performed and\nthe bridal party and company gradually left the church.\nAfter a little time I also got up and left the church. Just as I was\nleaving I met a friend who said tome, \"There is to be another wedding\nlater ; wait and see that too.\" Accordingly I went back and took my seat\nagain. Considerable time seemed to have passed when again the church was\nilluminated\u2014the music commenced, another wedding party arrived and\nwalked up the aisle and again the impressive ceremony was performed.\nWith one of these weddings\u2014 and I cannot tell which\u2014there was connected\nthe idea of some social affair\u2014a reception\u2014and it seemed to me a little queer\nand I associated it with the idea of a communion service carried on in a jolly\nsort of way.\nI had always been accustomed to associate dreaming of a wedding with\nmisfortune and death in the family, and when I awoke, this dream of two\nweddings gave me great uneasiness, and I associated it with sickness and\ndeath in my sister's family, although I had left them all well on Wednesday.\nI at once told my dream to my hostess and also told her of my apprehension ;\nand I took a much earlier train back to the city than 1 had planned to do. I\nhurried home in a state of great anxiety\u2014every little delay causing me great\nimpatience ; but finding no crape on the door I took heart, went in and\ncalled up stairs to my sister H., \"Are you all right here?\" She replied,\n\"Yes, certainly. Why are you so excited?\" I then went up to her\napartment and commenced relating my dream. My sister's amazement\nbecame more and more manifest as I went on, and at the close she exclaimed,\n' ' What a strange thing ! There were two weddings at St. John's Church on\nWednesday afternoon and I attended them both. They were very pretty\nweddings with music and flowers, and after the last one the wedding party\nwent to the parlour of the Infirmary (close by the church) and held a\nreception.\"\nMiss Luke confirms as follows :\u2014\nThis is a true statement of my dream and the actual circumstances\nconnected with it.\nMary Luke.\nDr. Mason adds :\u2014\nHere the dream occurred on the night of the day following the actual\nevents, but it is certain that no intelligence of the events in any way reached\nthe dreamer.\nR.

Accordingly I went to the church again in the evening. The church\nwas brilliantly lighted\u2014there was music and flowers. After the ceremony\nthere was a reception by the bride and groom in the parlors of the Infirmary\nclose by the church.

A\"Ps\nIII. \u2014The Albuquerque Dream.\nNine years ago M. L. had a friend in New Mexico whom I will call G. ,\nfrom whom she had not heard for months, and of whose surroundings she\nknew absolutely nothing.\nOne night she dreamed or, as she expresses it, saw this friend in\nAlbuquerque. She was, as it seemed to her, present in the room where he\nwas, and saw everything in it with the same degree of distinctness as if she\nwere actually present. She noticed the matting on the floor, the willow-\nware furniture, the bed, rocking chair, foot stool and other articles. He\nwas talking with a companion, a person of very striking appearance, whom\nshe also minutely observed as regarded personal appearance, dress and\nposition in the room. He was saying to this companion that he was about\nto start for New York for the purpose of interesting capitalists in a system\nof irrigation which he had proposed. HLs companion was laughing\nsarcastically and ridiculing the whole scheme. He persisted, and the\nconversation was animated\u2014 almost bitter.\nThree weeks later, early one morning, she dreamed that this man was in\nNew York. She saw him coming up the street leading to her house and\nsaw her father go forward to meet him. At breakfast she told her father\nher dream, and they also talked freely about her dream or vision of three\nweeks before.\nAfter breakfast her father sat upon the front stoop reading the morning\npaper and M. L. went about some work. Suddenly she heard her father call\nout in a startled sort of way : \u2014\" Mary, sure enough here comes G.! \" She\nstepped to the window and there was G. coming up the street and her\nfather going forward to meet him, exactly as she had seen him in her dream.\nHe had just arrived from the West, and had come for the very purpose\nindicated by his conversation in M. L.'s vision. After some general\nconversation M. L. said to him :\u2014\" By the way, who was that remarkable\nperson you were talking with about this journey three weeks ago V\nmentioning the night of her dream. With evident surprise he said :\u2014\n\" What do you mean ? \"\nShe then related the whole dream just as she had experienced it, even to\nthe minutest details. His astonishment was profound. He declared that\nthe details which she gave could never have been so exactly described except\nby some one actually present, and with some annoyance he accused her of\nplaying the spy.\nThe above account was taken down from Miss Luke's recital, suppress\ning some particulars, . . . which she, M. L., did not care to have\npublished. I thought the fact of the dreams having been told to the\nfather was a point. Unfortunately the father is dead.\nR.

I had read it over to\nher carefully after it was written out, and she pronounced it correct.\nMiss Luke has neither seen nor heard of G. since he left N.Y. after she\nrelated her dream to him.

The train fell 60 feet\ndown an embankment, resulting in wrecked carriages, shaken and injured\npassengers, and in the instantaneous death of the engine driver.\nOn the previous Friday night my wife had a dream which she related to\nme the following day. She dreamed that she and I were in a railway\naccident. She thought there was a crash and then the carriages fell over.\nShe then looked about for means of escape and saw the window overhead\nand endeavoured to get out by it. She did not remember the actual getting\nout, but found herself outside and saw several injured persons and one or\nmore dead. I thought no more about the dream until the following\nWednesday, when I was falling down the embankment. The first thing I\nsaid to myself as I felt the shock of the carriage turning over on its side\nwas\u2014\" Here is the dream !\" and it was further impressed on me as I looked\nabout to see how I could extricate myself and saw the window overhead,\njust as my wife had described. I got out by the window, and the first thing\nI saw was the dead body of the engine driver.\nMy wife was to have accompanied me, but was prevented at the last\nmoment, and, strange to say, the dream did not cross the mind of either\nof us. -I am, dear Sir, faithfully yours, Richard gTApMy-\n[The accident is described in The Westminster Gazette of September 1st,\n1897, and fuller details are given in its issue of September 2nd, from which\nI extract the account which follows.

The engine lay on its side vomiting sparks and smoke, and\nnear it was the body of James McKinley, the driver, residing at 44,\nCommercial Road, Eastbourne, who is said to have jumped from the engine\nwhen he saw what had happened.

Dr. A. Wallace was\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 189 .\nvoted to the chair. There were also present :\u2014Dr. R. Hodgson, and\nMessrs. F. W. H. Myers, F. Podmore, and H. Arthur Smith\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nTwo new Members and five new Associates were elected ; and\nthe election of seven new Associates of the American Branch was\nrecorded.\nA present to the Library was on the table, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donor.\nIt was resolved that, subsequently to the 28th of January already\narranged, General Meetings be held on the following dates in 1898 :\u2014\nMarch 11th, 8.30 p.m.; April 22nd, 4 p.m.; May 20th, 8.30p.m.;\nand June 24th, 4 p.m.\nSeveral other matters having been disposed of, it was agreed that\nthe next meeting of the Council be held on Friday, December 10th,\nat the Westminster Town Hall, at 3 p.m., previous to the General\nMeeting at 4 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 88th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, November 5th, at 8.30 p.m. ; Dk. A.\nWallace in the chair.\nDr. Richard Hodgson gave an address on the \" Later Investiga\ntions of Trance Phenomena manifested through Mrs. Piper.\" He began\nby giving a brief outline-history of the earlier trances of Mrs. Piper,\n1884-1891, referring to the articles in Proceedings S.P.R., Parts XVII.\nand XXI. This might be regarded as the first of three stages, and\nduring this first stage the chief \"control\" was the personality known as\nPhinuit. The second stage represented roughly the years 1892-1895,\nduring which had occurred the development of automatic writing in\nconnection with Mrs. Piper's trance, and strong evidence pointing to\nidentity had been obtained from what purported to be the \" spirit \" of\na young man, whom the lecturer called by the name of George Pelham.\nMost of this came through the automatic writing, by means of which,\nalso, many other \" communications \" were given from the friends and\nrelatives of various sitters, though Phinuit still was habitually present\nand used the voice more or less. Illustrations were given of some of\nthese communications, including some incidents in connection with\nstatements made later by the \"spirit\" of Kate Field. The third stage\nrepresented the period 1896-7. During this period Mrs. Piper's trance\npassed under the guidance of what purported to be the persons claimed\nby the late Rev. W. Stainton Moses as his \"spirit-guides,\" and\n\fDec., 1897.] Correspondence. 151\nPhinuit ceased to manifest. The consideration of this last stage, and\nof the significance of the whole series of manifestations, Dr. Hodgson\nreserved for a later address, to be given on December 10th. He\nstated, however, his opinion that although there were many difficulties\nto be explained, and much confusion and obscurity in many of the\ncommunications, they did emanate from the \" spirits \" that claimed\nto be communicating. Photographs were shown of Mrs. Piper, taken\nbefore and during and after trance.\nMr. H. L. Bevan put an inquiry concerning the belief beforehand\nof the sitters who had had experiences with Mrs. Piper, and pointed\nout that the lecturer had not made any reference to this consideration.\nThe lecturer said that this was different in different cases, and\ninstanced the \"Howards,\" friends of \"George Pelham,\" who would\nhave scoffed at matters psychical prior to their experiences with\nMrs. Piper.\nMr. Myers emphasised this point, referring to his personal know\nledge of the Howards, and to the complete reversal that Mr. Howard\nhad undergone from an absolutely disbelieving attitude to one of\nacceptance of the phenomena in question.\nProfessor Norris said that he agreed with the lecturer in his\nconclusions that we were, in these phenomena, dealing with ultra-\nsensuous agencies. He had been a student of these matters from\nthe year 1852, and in June, 1865, became himself the subject of these\n\" automatisms.\" His own experiences did not lead to the sanguine\nview that we were on the point of settling the vexed question of\npersonal or individual identity ;\u2014on the other hand the feasibility\nof demonstrating the human character of these \" influences \" on a\npsycho-physiological basis appeared to be highly probable.\nSeveral other questions were asked and answered, and the meeting\nthen adjourned.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents. ]\nThe Divining Rod and Unconscious Muscular Action.\nUnconscious muscular action is now generally accepted as the explanation\nof certain phenomena which had by many been previously attributed to the\ndirect action of some \"occult\" force. But is not a more exact definition\nrequired of what is meant by unconscious muscular action, and a clearer idea\ndesirable of the limits within which it may reasonably be supposed to act ?\nProfessor W. F. Barrett has made an important addition to the literature\nof the Society for Psychical Research in his work \"On the so-called\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1897.\nDivining Rod \" (Proceedings, Part XXXII). In dealing with the causes of\nthe phenomena, \u2014the reality of which he considers established, \u2014Professor\nBarrett says :\u2014\" Few will dispute the proposition that the motion of the\nforked twig is due to unconscious muscular action \" (p. 243) ; and again he\nsays :\u2014 \" Assuming the actual motion of the rod to be caused by involuntary\nmuscular action . . \" (p. 254). From these two sentences, we are led to\nthe conclusion that Professor Barrett looks upon \"unconscious\", as\ndistinguished from conscious muscular action, as an adequate explanation\nof the movements of the divining rod. The question may, however, fairly be\nasked\u2014does this explanation cover all the evidence adduced by Professor\nBarrett himself ?\nNine of the cases brought forward in Part XXXII. of the Proceedings\nseem entitled to form a group by themselves. Some other similar cases are\nincluded among those enumerated on page 243 ; but these are sufficient for\nthe present purpose. These nine cases are :\u2014\nI.\u2014 \" Even the President of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall,\nMr. J. D. Enys, F.G.S., is not a scoffer ; on the contrary he himself is an\namateur dowser, and in a recent letter, writing from Penryn, Cornwall, Mr.\nEnys states :\u2014' I have tried it [dowsing for water] often. . . . On one\noccasion I cut a small slight rod and held it till I came to the place [where\nunderground water existed], when it always acted by turning. On this\noccasion I was able to hold the rod, but it broke short off in front of my\nhands, and did so a second time in the same place ' \" (p. 7).\nII.\u2014From a case sent by Miss Grantham, daughter of Judge Grantham :\n\u2014 \"At two spots the point of the twig turned right up, exactly reversing its\nprevious position ; in fact so strong was its impulse to point upwards, that\nwe found that unless Mr. B. [the Rev. J. Blunt] relaxed his hold the twig\nbroke off near his fingers \" (p. 26).\nIII. \u2014Mr. Percy A. Clive writes in reference to some experiments made\non his estate at Whitfield :\u2014 \" When Mullins held my wrists, and I held the\ntwig over running water, it twisted round in my hands with such force that\nwhen I held it tight it broke \" (p. 35).\nIV.\u2014The Rev. Martin R. Knapp, M.A., Vicar of Holy Trinity,\nDalston, writes:\u2014\"My builder, who came from Bath, was very sceptical\nabout the whole thing. Three or four of us who were on the spot tried to\nsee if the twigs would ' play up ' with us. We were unsuccessful till this\nman tried his hand, scoffing the while. But directly that he came to the\nspots the dowser had found, the twig showed vigorous signs of animation.\nWhen his hand was being twisted in his efforts to keep the twig steady, I\ncried to him to hold fast, with the result that the twig twisted itself into\ntwo pieces \" (pp. 37-38).\nV. \u2014\" Lady Milbanke says [in a letter to Dr. C. Hutton, F.R.S.] a large\nparty attended to watch the gyrations of the rod, which in spite of the man's\nhands being stationary, twisted round so energetically when he stood over a\nspring that the rod was broken.\" This man was a peasant in Provence\n(p. 41).\n\fDec., 1897.] Correspondence. 153\nVI. \u2014Dr. Hutton, F.R.S., the distinguished mathematician, thus\ndescribes the movements of the rod in Lady Milbanke's own hands : \u2014 \" The\nrods turned slowly and regularly in the manner above described, till the\ntwigs twisted themselves off below the fingers, which were considerably\nindented by so forcibly holding the rod between them \" (p. 42).\nVII.\u2014\"The following is from Mr. F. Bastable, 14, Foskett-road,\nFulham :\u2014 . . . . ' We procured two pairs of smith's tongs to see if the\ntwigs did actually twist, and held them in a tight grip, with one pair securing\nthe tips, and the other the fork, but the contortions still went on between\nthe points held ' \" (pp. 86-87).\nVIII. \u2014The following is quoted from a letter written by Mr. J. Budd, of\nTivoli, Tramore, Waterford. He is described as an amateur geologist :\u2014\n\" He [Mullins] held the twigs near their ends between his second and third\nfingers, as if you were going to- write, the point of the fork pointing\ndownwards. At No. 1., [referring to a plan] the point lifted itself up until\nit turned over backward and twisted itself until it broke ! . . . . He\nused another and another twig. The clerks then held them with him, and\nheld his hands, always the same effect. I saw to-day two of the broken\ntwisted twigs \" (p. 110).\nIX.\u2014Mr. W. Stone, of Bolingbroke Hall, Spilsby, Lincolnshire, a\nprofessional \"dowser,\" writes in reference to a spring of water which he\ndiscovered for the Rev. Mr. Morgan in the Isle of Wight :\u2014 \" The moment\nI put my foot over the water, the rod turned in spite of me, broke itself, and\nleft the two ends between my fingers and thumb \" (p. 133).\nBefore saying anything further on these nine cases, it may be useful to\nrefer to another class of phenomena. One of the most frequent and familiar\nexemplifications of unconscious or involuntary muscular action is in \"table-\ntipping\" or \"table-moving\" as ordinarily practised, when the hands of the\nsitters rest on the surface of the table. The majority of the results thus\nobtained are probably due to unconscious muscular action, and to nothing\nelse. But it sometimes happens that similar movements of the table occur\nwhen the table is entirely untouched by the sitters. For instance, the\nhistoric case in the Report of the Committee of the Dialectical Society, the\nevidence as to which has never been impugned. The conclusion of that\nCommittee is thus expressed : \u2014\" Your Committee express their unanimous\nopinion that the one important physical fact thus proved to exist, that\nmotion may be produced in solid material bodies without material contact by\nsome hitherto unrecognised force operating within an undefined distance\nfrom the human organism, and beyond the range of muscular action, should\nbe subjected to further scientific examination with a view to ascertain\nits true nature, source and power.\" (Report of the Committee of the\nDialectical Society, original edition, p. 13. )\nI do not overlook the interesting remarks which Professor Barrett makes,\nfollowing the two sentences above quoted from pp. 243 and 254. But they\ndo not seem to me to meet the case. Professor Barrett speaks of \"the\nextraordinary and involuntary spasm of muscular power, which often occurs\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1897.\nin cases of hysteria, or in moments of great excitement, and which cannot\nbe repeated at will in the ordinary state \" (p. 244). This is scarcely a\nparallel case. In such instances the phenomenon is, so to speak, a mere\nmultiplication of ordinary or normal action. A man who ordinarily exerts\nmuscular force sufficient, say, to lift one cwt., suddenly exercises sufficient\nforce to lift, say, three or four cwt. The precise question is this : \u2014Have we\nany grounds which justify us in attributing to unconscious muscular action,\nphysical effects which it is beyond the power of conscious muscular action to\nproduce ? In the nine cases quoted above, could conscious or voluntary\nmuscular action produce the results obtained ? Will any amount of\nvoluntary muscular exertion produce the least effect in twisting or breaking\na twig beyond the point at which it is held, any more than it will move a\ntable at the distance even of a foot ? Professor Barrett recognises the diffi\nculty by saying :\u2014 \"Certainly no voluntary effort, without long and laborious\npractice at legerdemain, could produce an effect corresponding in kind or\ndegree to that which virtually takes place in the cases cited \" (p. 244). It\nwould be very interesting if, in cases where violent movements of the twig\noccur with contact of the hands, some series of experiments were made to\nascertain whether any movement of the twig could be obtained without such\ncontact. If any movement was thus obtained the parallel between the rod\nand the table would be complete. The nearest approach to this is in case\nVII. quoted above, where the tips of the twig were tightly gripped by one\npair of smith's tongs, and the fork of the twig by another pair, \u2014\" but the\ncontortions still went on between the points held.\"\nIn the very first report of the Committee on Thought-reading, of which\nProfessor Barrett was one of the joint authors, there is a very interesting\nreference to conscious and unconscious muscular action. (See Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. I., p. 15.) In a paper read before a scientific body in Detroit,\nDr. T. A. McGraw describes the method followed in certain thought-reading\nexperiments. After expressing his belief that most of the actions \"could\nbe explained by the perception, by a trained operator, of involuntary and\nunconscious mucular movements,\" he goes on to say that he does not believe\nthat explanation covers all the phenomena he witnessed. He adds : \u2014 \"For\nwe are required [on that hypothesis] to believe a man could unwillingly, and\nin spite of himself, give information by unconscious and involuntary signs\nthat he could not give under the same circumstances by voluntary and\nconscious action.\" This puts the exact point most clearly. In asking us to\naccept the unconscious muscular action hypothesis as an explanation of the\ngroup of nine cases quoted above, Professor Barrett requires us to believe\nthat a man can unwillingly, and in spite of himself, move a rod or a twig,\nsufficient force being manifested to violently twist and break it, under\ncircumstances in which he would be unable to effect any movement by\nvoluntary and conscious action.\nThese nine cases appear to warrant the conclusion that, as in the case of\ntable-moving, some cause other than muscular action must be looked for\nbefore the whole ground is covered. The spiritualist may call the \"dowser \"\na \" medium.\" But that does not carry us any further. It is rather singular\n\fDec., 1897.] Correspondence. 155\nthat whereas several phases of what the spiritualist calls \" mediumship \" and\nof what the S.P.R. calls \"automatism\" are frequently manifested by the\nsame person, the power of using the \"divining rod\" is, so far as I have\nheard, not so associated. Many persons automatically write, draw and\npaint ; but I have not heard of any \"dowser\" also gifted in this way ; nor\nhave I heard of any \" medium \", in the spiritualist sense, being also a\n\"dowser.\" So far as this goes, it would not seem to encourage the idea\nthat \"dowsing\" belongs to the same class of phenomena as the forms of\nautomatism above-named. Professor Barrett says: \u2014 \"The rod must be\nregarded simply as the indicator of some action taking place upon or within\nthe living mechanism of the individual who holds the rod ; \" and in order to\nmake it quite clear what he means by this, he adds : \u2014 \" just as ' planchette '\nor a tilting table is used to indicate muscular impressions made by or through\nthe so-called ' medium ', . . . the movement of the rod being due to\ninvoluntary reflex action \" (p. 8).\nThe group of cases quoted above presents a strong prima facie case in\nsupport of the view that some of the movements of the \" divining rod \" may\nbe attributable to a cause of quite another kind than muscular action. It\nis also important to bear another consideration in mind. Seeing that\nmovements of tables and of other material objects do occur, \u2014such as those\nwithout contact, \u2014for which a cause wholly different to muscular action\nmust be sought, it is probable that some of the results when contact exists\nare due to the cause which produces the results when there is no contact.\nSimilarly as regards the \"divining rod.\" If we are compelled to infer a\ncause wholly different to muscular action for some of the results, it is\nprobable that muscular action is not the true cause in some of the cases\nwhere, if they stood alone, it would present an adequate solution.\nThe assumption made by Professor Barrett that the movements of the\nrod are always due to unconscious muscular action is therefore not only open\nto question, but is one that the evidence he himself has brought forward\ndoes not appear to justify. It is true that Professor Barrett says he leaves\nthis and other problems to the trained physiologist to solve ; is it well then\nto adopt a positive view before such a solution has been offered ?\nEdward T. Bennett.\nThe question raised by Mr. Bennett is one well worthy of discussion,\nbut I doubt whether it can be profitably discussed without more knowledge\n\u2014based on the opinion of experts\u2014than we at present possess.* I quite\nagree with Mr. Bennett that at first sight it seems incredible that in\nvoluntary muscular action could accomplish feats which are beyond the reach\nof consciously directed voluntary action, and the passage quoted by him\nfrom our first report on thought-reading shows that I myself was at one\ntime as strongly of that opinion as Mr. Bennett himself. But we have\nlearnt a good deal in the fifteen years that have passed since that report\n* I do not know why Mr. Bennett selects only nine cases of the breaking of the\nrod ; several others are quoted in my paper, as will be seen from the list given on p. 244.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec, 1897.\nwas written. One of the earliest lessons taught by our experimental\nresearches in so-called thought-reading was the fallacy of this preconceived\nopinion. None of us now doubt that involuntary muscular guidance on\nthe part of the agent, and unconscious muscle-reading on the part of\nthe percipient, are, for the purpose in view, inimitable by, and more effective\nthan, any voluntary conscious act on the part of one or the other. Moreover,\nwe have been led to recognise more clearly the wide realm and im\nportance of the sub-conscious life. One of the most interesting facts\nrevealed in the investigation of the dowser's art is that it affords (as stated\non p. 255 of my paper) a striking instance of information obtained through\nautomatic means often transcending that derived from conscious observation\nand inference.\nAs regards the motion of the divining rod, the widespread belief of a\nsceptical public is, of course, that the dowser intentionally twists the forked\ntwig when he fancies he has reached the object of his quest. The evidence\nI have adduced shows this belief is untenable. The only other alternative\nknown to science is that the motion of the twig must be due to some\ninvoluntary muscular action on the dowser's part. It is true Melancthon\nand the rest of the learned world of the sixteenth century thought that the\nmotion originated in the twig itself, and was a necessary consequence of the\n\"law of sympathy,\"* but the learned Jesuit Father Kircher (one of the\nfounders of experimental science) about the year 1650 showed that the twig\nitself was inert, and that in some way the motion was communicated from\nthe dowser himself. It is true Malebranche and Lebrun, 50 years after this,\nurged with resistless logic that the explanation of the divining rod was to be\nfound in the sport of good-natured or mischievous devils, \"the badinage of\ndemons \" ; whether these philosophers thought the demons got hold of the\nend of the stick and twisted it, or gave supernormal strength and skill to\nthe dowser, I do not know.t This spirit theory, apparently, is the view of\nsome people at the present day. It may be true enough, if these creatures\nswarm in the neighbourhood of mediums and dowsers, only it needs a good\ndeal of evidence, and I am afraid it will be some time before science will\naccept any evidence of that kind. Hence, as I have said, the only alter\nnative before us is that some involuntary muscular action on the dowser's\npart causes the twig to turn and sometimes break.\nThere is undoubtedly considerable difficulty in understanding how this\nexplanation covers all the facts, if such cases as Mr. Bennett has quoted are\ncorrectly described. The breaking of the forked twig can only be accom\nplished by a rigid grasp of one of the forks, and a rotation of the twig by the\nhand holding the other fork. This is probably what occurs\u2014the skill and\n* Every age has its fashionable fetish, this \"law\" was a notable idol of the\nlearned world in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nt Malebranche refers Lebrun to both St. Augustine and Porphyry in support of\nhis view that the devils cannot be always at work tempting mankind, but must have\nmoments of relaxation like human beings ! Hence come their little jokes in table\nrapping, Porphyry thinks.\n\fDec, 1897.] Correspondence. 157\nstrength required to do this, without much visible motion of the hand, being\nas much beyond the conscious effort of the dowser as the feats of a\nsomnambulist or hypnotised person are beyond the power of the same\nperson in his normal state ; and the physiological explanation is probably\nmuch the same in the two cases, namely, an automatic concentration and\ndischarge of most of the available nervous energy of the individual into one\nnarrow channel. I had intended, \u2014as will be seen from the foot-note to\npage 138 in my paper\u2014discussing this question of unconscious muscular\naction in its relation to the motion of the divining rod in the part of our\nProceedings which has recently been published. The paper had, however,\ngrown to such portentous length that I held over this question, and hope to\nreturn to it in the second part of my paper.\nMeanwhile, as I have received communications much to the same\npurport as Mr. Bennett's letter from several well known scientific men,\nwho happen to be interested in this subject, I will here quote an extract\nfrom the report of a small committee who, in 1894, critically examined a\ndowser at work. The committee of investigation consisted of the pathologist\nand the assistant physician of one of the British hospitals, Mr. Mole,\nF.R.C.S., and Dr. F. H. Edgeworth, \u2014the latter having made neurology\na special study\u2014and the Rev. R. A. Chudleigh, of West Parley Rectory,\nWimborne, Dorset. Mr. Chudleigh, who acted as reporter, though not an\nM.D., has made a life-long study of both physiology and pathology. The\ncommittee were therefore well qualified. They were fortunate in securing\nthe co-operation of a skilful amateur dowser, who placed himself as well as\nhis estate (on the border of the Mendips) entirely at their service. In the\ncourse of a lengthy report, Mr. Chudleigh says : \"If there be one thing\nwhich is perfectly clear it is that the movement of the wand is due to an\nunconscious muscular contraction, just like other muscular contractions,\nexcept that it is unconscious.\" Albeit, he goes on to say, \" The violent\ntremor which convulsed the overstrained arm is itself enough to suggest\nwitchcraft to an ordinary spectator, and yet I am sure that it is nothing\nmore than what is known as muscle-clonus. \" Anatomical reasons are then\ngiven to account for the sudden violent motion of the rod, and the report\ncontinues : \" A precisely analogous phenomenon is seen in those cases where\na spinal wound or a spinal poison throws the whole body into universal\nspasm ; but the flexors master the extensors and the back muscles over\npower the front ones, the result being the frightful and well known pose\ncalled opisthotonus.\" The writer then points out that the sudden spontaneous\ntension of the muscles of the arms which occur when the dowser believes\nhimself to be over a spring is probably due to auto-suggestion; \"this\nauto-suggestion makes a diviner positively tetanic when he knows or thinks\nthat water is present.\"* The symptoms described in the foregoing were\nmore strikingly exhibited by the late Mr. W. Scott Lawrence than by most\nother dowsers ; the dowser, whom this small committee investigated, was a\njournalist who does not wish his name published. Notwithstanding this\n* See Farm and Home, May 1894, p. 132.\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Hodgson, London.\nSir, \u2014 Some time last year I wrote to Mr. Myers about inward vision.\nAs I have since gone on studying that interesting subject, the time has\nperhaps come that something about it should be printed in the Journal, in\norder to elicit other communications of the same kind.\nThis is what I have observed, that when I am in bed, at night, before\ngoing to sleep, I constantly see, my eyes being closed, figures of things and\nfaces, more or less distinctly, as if lighted slightly, on the dark inner surface\n(as it seems) of my eyelids, \u2014and more probably on my retina.\nThat inward vision is independent of my will, can neither be conjured up\nnor be cancelled at will.\nIt does not happen during the day, unless in a dark room and after my\neyes have been closed for at least a quarter of an hour.\nWhen in bed at night, it is not immediately that it takes place, but\nusually after a few minutes of rest.\nIf I am in good health, the temperature of my blood being normal, the\nobjects of that vision do not force themselves on my attention, but the\nmoment I think of the subject I begin to see them floating in the dark.\nIf on the other hand, having, say, caught a cold, I am feverish, I cannot\nbut see the kaleidoscopic views ; they intrude on my attention, being more\nlighted, more vivid and consequently more distinct.\nAs to the nature of the things seen, they are sometimes geometrical\nlines, oftener bits of landscape, or furniture of a house, a piano, an arm\nchair, etc., and oftenest faces of living beings, animals or more generally\nhuman faces.\nSometimes I can distinguish the whole body of the man or woman, but\ngenerally I see distinctly only the face, which may be old or young,\nhandsome or ugly, or plain, the remainder of the figure being in a half\nlight, as in one of Rembrandt's pictures. The vision of one object lasts never\nmore than a few seconds, from five to twenty, and is insensibly replaced by\nanother. And this goes on as long as I am conscious of my own self, before\ngoing to sleep, sometimes a quarter of an hour, sometimes less.\nAnd that is not all. The faces I see in that way being always faces of\npeople unknown to me, I often try to see if I am acquainted with the parties,\nand it sometimes happens that I make a guess. \"Is not this Mr. X.?\"\nfor instance ; but immediately I see in my mind the face of Mr. X., as I\n\fDeo., 1897.] Correspondence. 159\nknow it to be, and I am enabled, by comparing the two images, to see the\ndifference between them.\nI can visualize easily and conjure up before my mind the face known to\nme ; but my inward vision is something quite different. Hundreds of times\nhave I willed to see a face known to me while looking at an unknown face in\nthe dark camera of my closed eye ; and I have always succeeded in seeing\nboth at the same time, one in my eye, the conjured up one in my head, at\nthe cerebral seat (I suppose) of the visual power.\nWhat am I to conclude from these observations ?\nI think I am justified in saying that my retina is the seat of moleculary\nmotions at all times, motions producing images, which I can see only when\nthe impressions from outside have died out, something like the dreams of the\nretina, and secondly that when with my eyes closed I conjure up the image\nof a thing or being, that image being located somewhere in my memory-\ncentres, my mind wakens up that image, and I perceive it in my brain.\nI suppose also that the power of seeing images in a crystal is nothing\nelse than the power of projecting into the crystal the images spontaneously\ncreated by the retina (a power, by the bye, which I do not possess).\nI would also ask if, when one sees in a dream visions of things or of\npeople, it does not originate in that continual moleculary motion of the\nretina cells, perceived and interpreted by a half awake brain.\nDo you not think, Sir, that there is here a field for interesting\ninvestigations and studies ?\u2014I am yours truly, \u2022 Glardon\n[The experiences described by Mr. Glardon belong apparently to the type\nknown as hypnagogic illusions. See Gurney's account of these in Phantasms\nof the Living, Vol. I., pp. 390, 473 ; also Principles of Psychology, by\nProfessor James, Vol. II., p. 124 ; and other works cited by these authors.\nIt would be interesting to know how far those of our members who have\nsimilar experiences are also successful in \"crystal-gazing.\" The question\nas to how far the apparent spatial location of the visual images\u2014(1) caused\nby changes in the retinal field, (2) reproduced for examination by a definite\nact of recollection, (3) spontaneously arising in ordinary memory, \u2014varies\nfor different persons is also an interesting one. We invite careful observations\nfrom our members.\u2014Ed.]\nCriticism of Variods Cases Reported in the Journal of the Society\nfor Psychical Research.\nIt seems to me desirable that, along with the cases which appear in the\nJournal of the Society for Psychical Research, some comments should be\npublished expressing the views of the members or associates individually\nupon the degree of value of the evidence and upon the degree of relation\nbetween the different events recorded. The expression of different views\nwould thus provide a school of training in scientific methods of investigation.\nThe improvement in the power of differentiation, for instance, between a\ncoincidence and the relation of cause and effect of two events would be of\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Due, 1897.\ngreat assistance in forming a more accurate conception of the value of\ndifferent cases. There are so many incidents which occur in this world that\nmany of them must necessarily coincide. No one would think, for instance,\nthat if a Chinese princess in Pekin were to report that she saw a wedding\nin her dream and a wedding should occur at St. George's Church at the\nsame moment she dreamt it (as it might then be day-time in London), there\nshould be any relation between the two events or that the Chinese princess\nwas in any way endowed with clairvoyant powers, and, unless a closer\nrelationship can be established between two events than may possibly occur\nbetween the thoughts and dreams of a Chinese princess and the events\nwhich occur at St. George's Church, it strikes me that we are not justified in\nconsidering such events except in the light of coincidence, more particularly\nso if we can trace reasonable causes not related to each other to account for\nthe respective events. So our endeavours should be directed to account for\nunusual occurrences by natural causes before attributing them to abnormal\ncauses. Take for instance case L. 1096. An P8, The Two Weddings,\nreported in the November number of Journal. There is no definite object\nor purpose carried out by the information conveyed to Miss Luke in her\ndream, there is apparently no relation between her and the married parties,\ni.e., no apparent anxiety on the part of the married parties to convey to her\nthe information, none on her part to receive it, as there is no statement in\nthe report that she knew anything of the parties. The dream occurred more\nthan 24 hours after the event, showing it could not be an actual percep\ntion ; and, if the dream had occurred a year instead of a day after, no\nimportance would have been attached to it by anybody. The corroboration\nafforded by the reception given after the wedding is very slight indeed, as it\noccurred to the mind of the dreamer as a communion service, which is very\ndifferent from the actual reception that took place, and, moreover, she\ncannot tell in respect of which wedding the communion service took place.\nAgain, the meaning of the dream, had it been a telepathic communication,\nwas not conveyed to the dreamer, as she took it for a sign of death in the\nfamily, so that her early return home was prompted by a mistaken notion\nand was of no avail to effect any purpose. Apparently the only details that\ncoincide would be that two weddings took place, both in St. John's Church,\naccompanied with music and flowers. Now, taking the facts by themselves,\nthat there were two weddings on the eve of Thanksgiving Day in St. John's\nChurch with music and flowers is nothing extraordinary,\u2014in fact, something\nvery natural. On the other hand, we are told that Miss Luke from child\nhood had been an inveterate somnambulist, walking almost every night, of\nwhich she had, however, been cured. This informs us, at least, that she\ndreams almost every night. She also informs us that it is a pleasure to her\nto attend church weddings for the sake of music and pleasant surroundings,\nand the report implies that she is a familiar visitor of St. John's Church.\nIs there anything extraordinary in her dreaming of weddings, music and\nflowers occurring at that church 1 To my idea, there is no more relation\nbetween the two events than between the dream of the Chinese princess\nreferred to and a wedding taking place in St. George's Church, London.\n\fDec., 1897.] Case. 161\nBut, one may say, how can we account for the actual occurrence of two\nweddings, admittmg this to be usual, together with dreaming that two\nweddings took place, which cannot be considered very usual ? I should say\nthat this is the only real correspondence that exists between the two, and\nwhich struck the relatives of Miss Luke most. Had she dreamt of only one\nwedding, the remainder of the dream would not have been considered in\nany way extraordinary, but, considering the frequency of her dreaming, this\nmay easily be accounted a coincidence. If two blind men were in the habit\nof throwing stones in the street, the one who would throw the greater\nnumber would be more likely to hit some one than the other, but he could\nnot be accounted a good marksman for that reason, nor should his hitting\nany one be considered an extraordinary occurrence.\nP.

Goodale.\n[Associate A.B.S.P.R.].\nMr. Goodale enclosed the following account :\u2014\n[February, 1896].\nMy Dream.\nIt was a night in August, 1879, in Catskill, N.Y., that I dreamed, at the\nringing of the factory bell of a winter's morning at 6.30 o'clock the door\nbell was rung. Mr. C. E. G. (in whose home Mr. J. and I were then living)\nwas in New York, and Mr. J. answered the bell. He returned to the room\nwith the word that my mother-in-law Mrs. S. J. (a widow), who was living\nalone with her servant, was lying in a fit at her home. We were both\nhurriedly dressing, when at the tolling of the factory bell five minutes later,\nthe door bell was again rung, and word was brought that she was dead.\nMr. J. hastened to the house, I following as quickly as possible. In my\ndream it was a dark winter's morning, the air was full of sleet and cold, and\nas I passed through the streets, lights were twinkling in the houses, and\nbreakfast fires were being started. The house stood upon a corner, and as I\napproached it, it was a blaze of light. The two doctors who had been called\nwere there, and two or three near neighbours. When I entered the house, I\nwas requested by Mr. J. not to look upon the face of the dead. She was\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Her face was black as any\nnegro, and she had the appearance of sudden death.\nUpon waking from this dream I told it, and later in the morning, as it\nwas still vividly before me, I related it to Mrs. G. The dream faded, and I\nthought no more of it, until the morning of its fulfilment, December 31st,\n1879, when I saw it completely developed, and the whole scene took place\nin reality, as I have related it, even to the twice ringing of the door bell,\nfirst at the ringing of the factory bell, and five minutes later, at its tolling.\nThe face of the dead even was as startling in reality as in my dream. Upon\nentering the house, I was requested not to go to her as in my dream, but, in\nthe absence of Mr. J. , the arrival of the Coroner demanded my entering the\nroom a little later. The appearance of the streets and of the brightly\nlighted house itself was as I dreamed it.\n[Mrs. J.].\nIn reply to enquiries, Mrs. J. writes : \u2014\nCatskill, N.Y., March 5th, 1896.\nMr. Richard Hodgson,\u2014My Dear Sir, \u2014. . . In reply to your\nquestion, \"Was it to Mr. J. you told your dream upon waking?\" and\n\" Will he send some statement upon the matter?\" It was to him I first\ntold my dream, but since then, he has passed out of my life. Mrs. G.,\nhowever, is willing to state the fact of my having told her the dream the\nmorning after its occurrence, and remembers having come into my room\nimmediately upon Mr. J.'s hasty departure, the morning of its fulfilment,\nand asking me if I remembered my dream.\nI would like to say to you that I wrote off very hastily this account of\nthe dream, and sent to Mr. Goodale, who has often asked me for it. . . .\nI gave the facts. Indeed, perhaps I ought to have added that the face was\nreally black as in my dream, by reason of inhaling the hot air from the\nregister, upon which she had fallen while preparing for the night's rest. It\nwas in this condition she was found by her maid at the hour I have named\nin the morning, having lain, face downward, upon this register all the night.\nShe was known by her physician to have a disease of the heart.\n[Mrs. J.j\nThe following statement was sent to me by Mrs. J. :\u2014\nMarch 6th, 1896.\nMr. Richard Hodgson, \u2014My Dear Sir, \u2014I remember Mrs. J. having\ntold me this dream the morning after its occurrence.

I also remember having gone into her room\nafter Mr. J. 's hasty departure, while she was still dressing, and having\nasked her if she remembered her dream.

By Goldwin Smith, D.C.L., etc. \u2014\nMacmillan, 1897.\nIn this small volume Dr. Goldwin Smith has collected five essays which\nfully maintain,\u2014rwhich, perhaps, should even enhance,\u2014their author's\nreputation as a concise and polished writer. It contains some excellent\nspecimens of the trenchancy of his controversial style. One would be\nsorry after reading this book to have to maintain any longer certain\ndoctrines which it incidentally controverts ; say for instance the doctrine of\nthe hypostatic union of the Pope and the Holy Ghost. Nay, even some\nphilosophers who regard themselves as serenely grounded in reason might\nfind this work a bitter pill. One could not have recommended it, for\ninstance, as agreeable reading either to the late Professor Drummond or to\nthe living Mr. Kidd. My own concern, however, is not so much to shield\nmy special creeds from any attack, as to point out\u2014with mingled feelings\u2014\nthat those creeds have not as yet risen high enough above the ground to\ncome within the sweep of the author's exterminating sword. An essay\nentitled \"Is there Another Life?\" after an allusion to Cock Lane, (Boswell's,\nnot Mr. Lang's), proceeds as follows : \u2014\n\"It cannot be necessary to discuss such fictions. The only case, so far\nas we are aware, in which there is anything like first-hand evidence, is that\nof the warning apparition to Lord Lyttelton, which may be explained as the\nmasked suicide of a voluptuary sated with life. Nor can spiritualistic\napparitions call for notice here. They have been enough exposed.\"\nIn an essay on \"Morality and Theism,\" also, the following passage\noccurs :\u2014\n\" Of Spiritualism little need be said. . . . It can hardly be admitted\neven to have a good title to its name, since the dead are made to ' materialise,'\nand to use material instruments of communication.\"\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Deo, 1897.\nNow, in the first place I would remark that this last argument, which I have\noften seen before, seems to depend wholly on a mere confusion of thought.\nAssuming for argument's sake that \" materialisations \" may be genuine\nphenomena, \u2014that \" spirit hands \" may write on slates and the like ;\u2014what\nis there here to interfere with the doctrine that a world of spirits exists 1\nNo one either pretends or desires to prove that the world of spirit is without\naction on the world of matter. If spirits exist, and can communicate with\nus, they must use or affect certain material objects\u2014namely, our own brains\nand organisms\u2014and if they can make temporary organisms of their own to\nhelp them, so much the better. It will only be a still more striking\nillustration of the stoic's faith : \" A little soul for a little upholds this\ncorpse, which is man.\"\nBut of course it is the dictum as to Lord Lyttelton's apparition with\nwhich I am directly concerned. Observe that we are not here dealing with\na hostile criticism on the work of the S.P.R., but with a plain expression\nof absolute\u2014I say absolute, I do not say inexcusable\u2014ignorance thereof.\nNo controversialist, \u2014 least of all so straight a hitter as Dr. Goldwin\nSmith, \u2014would have selected the old Lord Lyttelton as the champion to be\ndemolished, if he had been aware that a group of human beings exists who\ncare but little for that bold bad man, but who claim to have published, say,\na thousand cases which at any rate rise above an evidential level below\nwhich Lord Lyttelton distinctly falls.\nThere is of course, at first sight, something depressing in the light thus\nincidentally thrown upon the position which psychical studies occupy in\nmany minds which one cannot disregard. While Spiritualism is vaguely\nheard of and uninquiringly despised, our own work is as yet, not ignored\nonly, but absolutely unknown. Yet I confess that in myself this striking\nillustration of the obscurity in which our labours still lie produces an\nimpression far more of hope than of disappointment. That thought is to me\nwhat the thought of continents of fossils yet undisturbed is to the\npalaeontologist in search of proofs of evolution. \"From how small a\nfragment of earth's backward-stretching history,\" he exclaims, \"have these\nnumerous and striking, if as yet incomplete, illustrations of our theory been\ndrawn ! What evidence may there not lie hidden in all these mighty\nregions still unexplored ! \" Yes ; and from how small a fragment ot forward-\nlooking history, (I am disposed to echo)\u2014from how narrow a field, how\nscanty a harvesting of those wide-scattered indications which point to man's\nevolution now in progress, and destined through many an age to run, have\nwe on our part collected already all our volumes of evidence ! Evidence it\nis, which, however you may rate it, at least a thousand times outweighs\u2014\nbut what compliment can we pay ourselves without fear of being thought\nextravagant ?\u2014well, at any rate, a thousand times outweighs any hopes of\nimmortality which mankind at large may have based upon the story of the\nbad Lord Lyttelton.\nThe moral of all this is plain enough. Our thanks to those of our\nmembers who discern it and act upon it ! May they multiply exceedingly\nand live long in the land ! F W H M\n\fNo. CXLV.\u2014Vol. VIII.

Names and\naddresses are given above.\nThe Council recorded with regret the decease of Mr. John\nWhitehead, of Guernsey, who had been an Associate of the Society for\nsome years.\nThe resignation of one Member and ten Associates who, from\nvarious causes, desired to withdraw from the Society at the end of the\nyear, was accepted. It was agreed to strike off the list the names of\nfour Members and thirteen Associates who had either removed or been\nlost sight of, or who had become only nominal Members.\nThe names of the Members of the Council who retire by rotation\nat the end of the year were read over.

Sidgwick in the chair.\nDr. Richard Hodgson gave an address on the \" Latest Investiga\ntions of Trance Phenomena manifested through Mrs. Piper,\" the\npaper being a continuation of that read at the previous meeting\nof November 5th. A very brief account is here appended, as Dr.\nHodgson's Report will be published in the next Part of the\nProceedings. Giving further illustrations of the alleged \"communi\ncations \" from \"deceased\" persons, he described the change which the\n\fJan., 1898.] General Meeting. 167\ntrance had undergone during the past year. The effort to obtain\nproof of identity from what purported to be the late Rev. W. Stainton\nMoses resulted in various \" communications \" from a group of persons\nwho claimed to be those known to the living Mr. Moses as Imperator,\nDoctor, Rector, &c. ; and, finally, in the latter part of January, 1897,\nImperator assumed the supervisory control of Mrs. Piper's trance,\nsince which time the Phinuit personality had not manifested. Co\nincident with this change, the convulsive movements which used\nto characterise Mrs. Piper's going into and coming out of trance com\npletely disappeared, and there seemed to be a marked improvement in\nevery way. Considering whether the whole series of manifestations in\nquestion could be accounted for without going beyond the action\nof living persons, the lecturer pointed out that we must take into\naccount that several other \" communicators \" (besides Phinuit) who\nused the voice, showed strongly marked characteristics, intellectual\nand emotional, in addition to the reproduction of specific memories, of\nthe nersons they claimed to be ; that this was the case also with some\nof the communicators who used the hand to write messages ; that these\nvarious intelligences, when thus communicating directly, as it were, and\nnot through Phinuit, showed sincerity and earnestness, and claimed to\nbe the discarnate friends or relatives of the sitters ; and that the\nconceptions of such discarnate persons so manifested seemed best\nexplainable on the hypothesis that the communications did actually\nemanate from such persons rather than from the minds of incarnate\npersons, and especially as, on the latter hypothesis, it must be supposed\nthat information was telepathically drawn from distant living persons\nwho had never been at sittings with Mrs. Piper. Referring to\nthe obscurities and mistakes and failures of many sittings, the lecturer\nurged that these seemed to show some systematic order when con\nnected with the supposed still existing personalities of the dead, but\nwere not so explicable when viewed in relation to living persons only.\nHe said that it might require a very rare faculty in a \"spirit\" to\ncommunicate clearly, and that it was not unreasonable to suppose that\nif human beings survived death, their discarnate personalities, owing\nto various causes,\u2014such as the wrench of death itself, or their change\nto an existence spent under, perhaps, very different and new condi\ntions, \u2014might find much difficulty at first in communicating clearly ; it\nmight be like awakening from a deep sleep. Further confusion might\narise from the fact that they were, ex hypothesi, using not their own\noriginal fleshly bodies to communicate, but the body of a stranger ;\nwe might expect such disturbances as aphasia and agraphia ; there\nwould be difficulty as regards inhibition ; the conditions would be\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1898.\nvery burdensome, but successive trials would show an improvement.\nSuch considerations throw much light on the obscurities in Mrs.\nPiper's trance. The analogy used by Socrates at the beginning of\nthe seventh book of Plato's republic suggested the bewilderment of\nthe \" returning soul,\"\u2014which, after leaving the dark cave with its\nshadows, and becoming, after a period of bewilderment in the world\nof light above, familiar with its new conditions, is again bewildered\nin the opposite way on return to the den of darkness. The lecturer\nalso quoted cases which seemed to indicate that young children were\nparticularly clear in \" communicating.\" As to the statements made\nin the trance concerning the conditions of the alleged \" other life,\"\nthese conditions seemed to be so different from ours that only analogies\ncould be used, and in any case the matter seemed for the most part\nirrelevant to our present evidential inquiry. But some of the state\nments might be worth considering, such as that they have etherial\nbodies, and this might be capable, eventually, of proof or disproof by\nliving persons. He said, in conclusion, that although a wide margin\nmust be allowed for the building up of fictitious personalities in\nconnection with trance states, and although it might be a long time\nbefore it could be established as exclusively true, yet he had no\npractical doubt whatever that these communications come mainly from\nthe \" returning dead \" ; and the significance of the case, he thought,\nwould be much heightened when taken in connection with other lines\nof our research, such as Mr. Myers had developed in his articles on\nPhantasms of the Dead and the Subliminal Consciousness.\nMr. H. L. Bevan put some questions with the view, apparently, of\neliciting what appeared to him to be weak points in the investigation.\nHe drew attention to what he regarded as a suspicious circumstance,\n\u2014namely, that Mrs. Piper received payment for her seances, \u2014and\nreminded the lecturer that people frequently lied for money. He also\nthought it a weak point that no professional detectives had been called\nin as sitters, and that such alienists as had had sittings did not believe\nthat the phenomena came from \" spirits.\" He was proceeding with\nfurther questions along the lines of the precautions that should be\ntaken to prevent imposture.\nDr. Wallace objected that the time of the meeting ought not be\ntaken up by the consideration of matters which had been dealt with in\npreviously published reports, and which were familiar to the audience.\nThe Chairman eventually ruled that sufficient time had been given\nto Mr. Bevan for questions of such elementary character.\nMr. Page Hopps stated that he was a minister of the Gospel, and\nwas paid for his work, that perhaps Mr. Bevan was a lawyer and was\n\fJan., 1898.] General Meeting. 169\npaid for his work, and he remonstrated against the casting of aspersions\nupon Mrs. Piper because of the fact that she received payment for the\nuse of her time and energy. He urged that the utmost care should be\ntaken to discover trustworthy mediums, who should be isolated from\nunfriendly influences, and paid as we should pay a lawyer or pay a\nminister.\nMr. Lane Fox stated that Dr. Hodgson was well-known as a\ncareful investigator, and that his skill and knowledge of devices used\nin various forms of imposture had been shown in several recorded\ncases into which he had made enquiry ; and he thought that as regards\nthis point the investigation might be considered thorough. But the\ninterpretation of the facts was another matter. He said that to speak\nof souls coming back might lead to confusion of thought, and he\ndisagreed with any view that Dr. Hodgson might seem to have\nexpressed that the alleged communicating intelligences were in any\nsense like wandering bodies. They were more probably analogous to\nsuch as communicate with us in our dreams, and did not represent the\nwhole personality of the individual. There might be some direct\nrelation between them and us, but, if so, it was of some transcen\ndental kind.\nMr. Gagen put some questions, and urged that it was difficult to\n.suppose that if the soul was pure idea, it could come back to sense,\nand communicate in the way suggested. The phenomena seemed\nbetter explicable on the hypothesis that the medium was under some\nhypnotic influence, and was in that state sensitive to the impressions\nreceived from the persons present at the sittings.\nMr. Myers pointed out that such a hypothesis was not adequate to\naccount for many of the occurrences. He referred to the information\nwhich Professor Lodge had obtained through Mrs. Piper's trance\nconcerning his Uncle Jerry, most of which was unknown to the sitters,\nand could with difficulty be verified from other sources. As to\nwhether the soul could return or not, it was a question of evidence.\nIf it did return and communicate with us, such communication must\nbe in terms which we could comprehend, and we knew of no a priori\nreason why it should not, if so returning, be able to use its earthly\nmemory, or affect some earthly body, perhaps in much the same way as\nour own souls might be supposed to do now while we are still incarnate.\nA few other questions were asked, and Dr. Wallace suggested\nthat an opportunity might be given for further discussion at an\nadjourned meeting.\nThe Chairman remarked that it would be well to wait till the\nReport of the Investigations appeared in the Proceedings before any\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1898.\narrangement was made for another meeting for further discussion, and\nthat after this Report was in the hands of the members, such an\narrangement would be made.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents. ]\n\"Faces in the Dark.\"\nLondon, December 5th, 1897.\nDear Sir,\u2014The experiences of Mr. Glardon with the \"Faces in the\nDark \" interest me all the more for being a subject quite familiar to me,\nalthough appearing to me under somewhat different circumstances.\nI have that experience every time I close my eyes, be it at day or at\nnight, in the dark or in the light, except if the light was so close to the eyes\nand so bright that only the glare and colors would be felt and seen. The\nimages are of very different kinds ; faces, landscapes, rooms, sometimes\ngeometrical figures \u2014animals very often. Now, I must state that I am very\nbad at visualizing and generally producing images at will. In two cases only\nI saw faces known to me as pictures of far-away friends, and even this did\nnot happen at will. I have the faculty of crystal-gazing (some experiences\nhaving been recorded in the Journal this year) [May, 1897] and I can see,\ntoo, with my eyes shut, but, curiously enough, only things and persons\nunknown to me or in surroundings of which I know nothing and which in\nalmost every case turn out to be correct. So that I am quite sure that these\nfaces and images are not the result of any impressions from outside,\nconscious or unconscious, for the images seen with eyes shut as well as for\nthose in the crystal (I use simply water).\nFaces and curious figures I can see too with my eyes open, sometimes on\na white or light surface (for instance, I saw one evening a very pretty head\nof a girl with curly hair on the pale grey sleeve of my gown), sometimes in\ntwilight. But these last are too easily effects of illusion, so I do not pay any\nattention to such visions. What is the most interesting to me in such\nimages, of the clearness and reality of which I can assure myself by closer\nobservation and which last a certain time \u2014 that is the rather comical fact\nthat sometimes these faces seem very much alive and make \" faces \" at me.\nThey often look very ugly then, and, when animal, more like the monsters\nof fairy-tales, although not of the conventional type of dragons and such. If\nthe weakness of my sight had not prevented my further studying painting,\nit would have been very useful perhaps of fixing a series of these strange\nimages for real investigation, accessible to everyone. Generally I can\ndismiss these images, or change to a new series, with a slight effort of will.\nBut memory or recollection\u2014in ordinary sense\u2014 have nothing to do with\nmy case. \u2014Yours truly,\nN. de Gernet, M.S.P.R.\n\fJan., 1898.] Correspondence. 171\nDecember 6th, 1897.\nSir,\u2014As you invite discussion on this subject, I will give an account of\na vision that I had in the autumn of 1894, although my experience was not\nthe same as the \" inward vision \" described by Mr. Glardon, my eyes being\nopen at the time.\nI had gone to bed after a long journey, but was too tired to sleep, when\nsuddenly the portion of the room opposite my bed seemed to be flooded with\nlight. This light gradually assumed the form of a circle about two or three\nyards in diameter, and then I saw distinctly a coloured landscape with a\ncottage and some trees. I was wide awake at the time and very much\nsurprised and interested. I had often heard of hypnagogic illusions, and had\nread of an instance in the Daily Graphic not long before, but I imagined\nthat they were only seen by persons who were habitually subject to\nhallucination. I had heard that these visions were generally a reproduction\nof something previously seen, but I could not remember having seen any\nlandscape exactly like this one, although it is quite possible that I might\nhave done so and forgotten it. When the vision gradually faded away, I\ntried to produce another by an effort of will, and succeeded, but the result\nwas very feeble compared to the first.\n1 have never been able to see anything in a crystal, although I have often\ntried to do so. tt t> \/ a . i. \\\nH. K. (Associate).\nCriticism of Cases.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, \u2014Will you allow meto make a few remarks on the questions raised\nin Dr. Hebert's letter to the last number of the Journal ? It seems to me an\nexcellent proposal that members of the S.P.R. should seriously study and\nsift the cases printed in the Journal, with a view to judging what value\nshould be attached to them, and not assume\u2014in spite of all Editorial\ncautions to the contrary\u2014that every incident recorded is to be regarded as\nevidence of something supernormal. As to the particular case referred to,\nMiss Luke's dream of the two weddings, I think with Dr. Hebert that there\nis very little evidence of anything beyond chance in the coincidence, though\nI think that her other experiences, in which the evidence seems somewhat\nbetter, should be allowed to weigh a little in estimating this one.\nThe view that coincidences of this kind are in general due to chance is\nnot, of course, a novel one. For instance, St. Augustine relates in his\n\" Confessions \" that when as a young man he became interested in the study\nof Astrology, a certain wise old man among his friends advised him to give it\nup, since he himself had studied it in his youth and found it utterly false.\n\"Of whom when I had demanded, how then could many true things be\nforetold by it, he answered me ' that the force of chance, diffused through\nout the whole order of things, brought this about.' \"\nDr. Hebert naturally does not put forward the explanation as a new one ;\nbut he does not seem quite to realise that almost all the work of the S.P.R.,\nfrom its foundation in 1882 to the present day, has been directed t wards\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 18M8.\ntesting its adequacy in the ease of the psychical phenomena dealt with.\nHe remarks that \" improvement in the power of differentiation between a\ncoincidence and the relation of cause and effect of two events would be of\ngreat assistance in forming a more accurate conception of the value of\ndifferent cases. There are so many incidents which occur in this world that\nmany of them must necessarily coincide.\" 1 have not a word to say in\ncontravention of this latter statement, and I agree fully that the power of\ndifferentiation between a coincidence and the relation of cause and effect of\ntwo events is highly desirable. But I do not quite understand how Dr.\nHebert proposes to cultivate it. What exactly\u2014apart from metaphysics\u2014\ndo we mean by the relation of cause and effect 1 Do we mean anything\nmore than that two events have occurred so often together that mankind\nhave agreed to consider that they are causally connected ? The two events\nmay be of an absolutely diverse kind, such as, a man walking across the\nstreet, and my consciousness of seeing him do it. The only ground I have\nfor assuming that my perception is caused by his action is that the two\nevents have so often occurred together. Suppose, however, that I constantly\nhad this impression, and that there was sometimes a real man in the street\nat the time, and sometimes not. How could we tell whether -on the\noccasions when the man was there\u2014there was, or was not, any connection\nbetween his presence and my impression ? A single coincidence would\ncertainly not be enough to prove it, nor would a single absence of coinci\ndence be enough to disprove it.\nThe main problem before the S.P.It. is, as Dr. Hebert implies, precisely\nof this nature. But he does not offer any criticism of the way in which it\nhas attempted to deal with it. The most careful study of individual cases,\nthough of course indispensable at a preliminary\u2014or indeed at any\u2014stage of\nthe enquiry, does not carry us very far. No one case can stand alone, on its\nown merits ; it can hardly even fall alone. The most striking and well\nauthenticated coincidence might be\u2014and if unique, probably would be\u2014\nmerely due to chance ; while coincidences of a very unimpressive kind, if\nsufficiently numerous in proportion to similar cases where there was no\ncoincidence, might afford very good evidence. The difficulty is that the\ncoincidences dealt with in psychical research are nol so numerous that\n\" mankind have agreed to think them not fortuitous.\" We have indeed\npublished some thousands of cases of apparitions or dreams coinciding with\nsome external event unknown to the percipient ; but every one knows that\nthousands of other cases occur in which no such coincidence can be shown\nand which we must regard as purely subjective.\nThe question then is not one which can be decided by an appeal to\ncommon sense, or a study of individual cases. It is one where we are\nobliged, in order to form a judgment of what chance can or cannot effect, to\nresort to the help of what St. Augustine, in the passage referred to above,\ncalls \"those impostors whom they style Mathematicians.\" For, as Professor\nKarl Pearson points out in his essay on \" The Chances of Death,\" the\nancient conception \" of chance as that which obeys no rule and defies all\nmeasure and prediction,\" has now been replaced by one totally different.\n\fJan., 1898.] Correspondence. 173\n* ' Where we cannot predict, where we do not find order and regularity, there\nwe should now assert that something else than chance is at work. What we\nare to understand by a chance distribution is one in accordance with law and\none the nature of which can for all practical purposes be closely predicted.\"\nAgain, he says, (in \" The Scientific Aspect of Monte Carlo roulette\") \" what\nthe natural philosopher understands by chance is not his ignorance of how\nany individual event, e.g., the spin of a teetotum, may result, but it is his\nknowledge of the percentages and failures which are sure to occur in a con\nsiderable number of trials. ... A knowledge of the average results of many\n\u00abvents is used to replace ignorance of the result of any individual event.\"\nMr. Gurney some years ago devised an application of the theory of proba\nbilities to one clearly defined class of cases, \u2014that of an apparition seen at\nthe time of death of the person whom it is recognised by the percipient as\nrepresenting. (See Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II., Chap. XIII.) It is\nobvious that since both events\u2014the seeing of an apparition and the death of\nan acquaintance\u2014are comparatively rare, an accidental coincidence between\nthem would be very rare indeed. It is equally true, though not quite so\nobvious, that in order to obtain any trustworthy data for the calculation\nwhether more such coincidences occur than chance might produce, a very\nlarge mass of material would have to be laid under contribution. Mr.\nGurney was not satisfied that the material he had collected was extensive\nenough, and some time after his death, a Committee of five members was\nappointed to make a new and more extensive collection, from which it was\nhoped to calculate the frequency of hallucinations of the senses among\npersons in a normal waking condition, and the proportion of coincidental\n-cases among hallucinations of the special type defined above. The collection\nof material was carried on for a little over three years, and after a study\nof it extending over two or three years more, the Committee published\ntheir Report in the Proceedings of the S.P.B., Part XXVI., (Vol. X.) That\nReport has, I am afraid, already taken rank as\n\"A book which there are few to praise,\nAnd none at all to read.\"\nBut I still think that it is worth while for any one interested in psychical\nresearch to consider whether the principles of method and reasoning adopted\nin it are or are not sound. Al1ce j0HNS0N-\n[See Dr. Hebert's criticism in the Journal for December. \u2014Ed.]\nLet us now pass on to another dream of Miss Luke, The Pobbery.\nL. 1095. Ae Ps ; but, before discussing the case, I will make a few\nremarks on the origin and modns operandi of dreams. A dream may\noriginate or, having commenced, may be kept up or varied by impressions\nreceived previously in the waking state, or during sleep before a dream or\nduring the dream. Thus we often dream of people whom we have quarrelled\nwith or taken a liking to, because the thought of the event is likely to recur\nto us many times, and the toll of a bell, the call of a voice or the occurrence\nof a noise, or any other impression, may change the course of a dream\nalready commenced. I will give some instances.\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1898.\n(1) Many years ago, when in medical practice in America, I attended a.\nyoung man who had injured himself in a dream. He was sleeping with five\nor six companions in a shanty erected within a few feet of the railway track.\nThey were all brickmakers, and the patient had been at work several\nprevious nights attending to the fire of a brick kiln. Suddenly in the night\nhe jumped out of his bed, screaming at the top of his voice, \" Run away, or\nyou will all be killed ! \" and in trying to escape he injured both his legs and\nfractured one of his ribs, falling over a stool. He afterwards explained that\nhe was dreaming he was still attending to the firing of the kiln, and that\nsuddenly he heard a crash and saw the top of the kiln of bricks falling over\nhim and his companions, so he cried out to them to run away. He could\nremember nothing else, and from his own knowledge it would have been\nimpossible to learn the whole cause of his dream ; but a companion of his\nsaid he was awake, and that a train was passing at the time when his friend\njumped out of bed. The shanty shook every time a train passed. In this\ninstance, therefore, the origin of the dream was in a previous impression,\nand the noise produced by the train was interpreted in the dreamer's mind\nas the crash of the falling brick kiln.\n(2) Again, a highly respectable young lady, patient of mine, and fond of\nchildren, often dreams during menstruation that she is confined of a child.\nHere the discomfort experienced by the young lady at that time produces an\nimpression which strikes her in her dream as what she imagines to be the\npain of parturition. The discomfort may be said to produce an impression\nbefore and during the dream.\n(3) Since my first criticism was written for the Journal, a young lady\nconsulted me one day, November 12th, for ear-ache, and informed me that\non the previous night she dreamt that she had the ear-ache, and that when\nshe woke up she had it in reality. She seemed to think there was something\nprophetic in that dream, as she said she was quite well when she went to\nbed, but the most plausible explanation is that she took cold during her\nsleep, and the consequent pain was the cause of the impression which\nresulted in her dream.\n(4) For some time past I have had a patient who consulted me\nregularly every week on the same day, but who, for some reason or other,\ndid not call last week. On the following night I dreamt that she called as\nusual, and the next day I tried to remember whether I had thought of\nthe patient during the day which preceded the dream, but could not\nrecollect any thought I had relating to her. Here it is probable that what\nhas been termed \"unconscious cerebration,\" but better expressed by the\nterm \" unremembered cerebration,\" had taken place before the dream.\nThe patient did not call at all that week, so it was not a telepathic\ncommunication.\n(5) Now we will trace the progress of a dream, such as might follow an\nimpression received during sleep. A man goes to bed covering himself with\nan excess of bed clothes ; when on the point of going to sleep, he feels too\nwarm and protrudes his feet from under the bed clothes. Feeling temporarily\nmore comfortable, he goes to sleep. After a time, his feet become cold ; the\n\fJan., j,s<)8] Correspondence. 175\nsame process of reasoning follows that impression as if he were awake. It\nis probable that the reaction produced by any impression made upon us is a\nmore or less unconscious effort to account for the cause or causes of that\nimpression so as to act accordingly, which effort is directed towards\nascertaining all the factors obtainable by the means at our command which\nconcur to produce that impression, and, from the result of that effort, our\nopinion is formed. In the waking state our senses are immediately brought\ninto requisition to verify the nature of such impression and rectify any error\nof judgment as much as possible. For instance, if you cross the middle over\nthe index finger and move them over a marble placed between these two\nfingers you will receive an impression as if you were touching two marbles.\nBy the sense of sight you can rectify the error of number and verify the\npresence of the marble producing the impression. Were it not for your\nsense of sight or some other means of rectifying your error, you would\nremain under the impression that you were touching two objects, even in\nthe waking state ; but, in sleep, you cannot avail yourself of the corrective\ninfluence of your sense of sight ; what we appear to see in dreams is the\nresult of memory, our sense of hearing is all but suspended, our sensation is\nobtused, we are shut off from our actual surroundings, we do not usually\nknow of our actual condition of sleep, so that an error of judgment being\nfirst made, another is added and so on without any means of rectification\nuntil the result is some fantastic dream such as we remember afterwards.\nNow let us return to our dreamer with cold feet. Shut off from the means of\nrectifying any error by his senses, the reactive effort to account for his\nimpression may result in an idea that he is walking barefooted on the cold or\nwet pavement, or on snow, which erroneous idea he has no means of\ncorrecting, with the result that it persists, if the feet continue to be cold, and\npossibly develops into the idea that he has undertaken a long journey over\nthe snow and ice to the North Pole ; further, that he meets Professor Andree\nand has a long chat with him, the gist of which would be more or less in\naccord with the views of the dreamer on that point ; or if the dreamer had a\npreconceived idea that Professor Andree had lost his life, he might find him\ndead in his dream. Some part of the dream may turn out to be true, and\nwhy not ? Take one hundred people who know nothing of a North Pole\nexpedition and ask them their views on the result of Andree's expedition and\nit would be very surprising if many of them did not say something of it which\nturned out to be true. If one opines that he will perish in his attempt to\ndiscover the North Pole, another believes that he will return safe, one of\nthem must lie right in his opinion ; but it does not follow that either should\nbe a clairvoyant. Thus we may see that the semi-conscious cerebration\nwhich follows an impression in a dream is subjected to the same principles\nas cerebration in the waking state ; but, considering the exclusion of the\nfaculties and senses at rest in sleep, the incoherent train of thought in\ndreams is as different from reasoning in the waking state as the result of an\nattempt to walk on one leg, the other being tied to the body, would be from\nordinary walking, or the gyrations of a bird with one wing bound from the\ngraceful flight of one let free.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jan., 1898.\nWith these preliminary remarks we will now proceed to analyse the\ndream of Miss Luke entitled \" The Robbery. \" The first impression which\ngave rise to Miss Luke's dream is most probably her missing the alarm clock.\nWe have her word that she supposed her lodger, Mr. B. , had taken it so he\ncould get up at a particular hour, and that she thought no more about it,\nand I believe this, in her knowledge, to be the truth, but cerebration does\nnot stop with our power of remembering it, as may be observed in dreams\nNo. 3 and No. 4. She went to bed directly, probably fell asleep in a short\ntime, and the impression of the missing clock may have developed into a\ndream of the robbery with all its details in precisely the same manner as the\nimpression of the cold feet in example No. 5 developed into a journey to the\nNorth Pole, together with the meeting with Professor Andree. Something\nelse, however, may have concurred to fix her attention on Mr. and Mrs. L.\nShe had not known them so long as Mr. B., whom she would probably have\nconsidered most trustworthy ; therefore her suspicions would be aroused\nagainst the former before the latter. This would sufficiently account for the\nwhole of the dream. Again, we are not told where Miss Luke slept, but\nher sister, Mrs. Stallings, reports that Miss Luke told her ' ' I have not\nheard a sound from them this morning \" ; we are not told, either, if the\nrobbery occurred in the afternoon or in the night ; perhaps it is not known,\nexcept by the thieves themselves, but it may have been in the night, and, if\nso, and Miss Luke slept in a part of the house where she could hear their\nmovements, it is not improbable that she may have been impressed with\nthat noise and, coupling it with the impression of the missing clock,\ninterpreted it in her dream into a robbery and disordered room such as the\nyoung brickmaker in quoted dream No. 1, coupling the noise and shaking of\nthe shanty, produced by the passing train, with the impression of his\nattending to the firing of the kiln, interpreted this in his dream as the falling\nof the brick kiln over him and his comrades. Thus the dream might find an\nexplanation from palpable causes, and further information on the doubtful\npoints might elucidate the case further.\nAs to the Albuquerque dream, I must confess that I cannot offer any\nexplanation. The suppressed particulars might have supplied some clue to an\nexplanation, and so might have been the case with any statement made by\nthe father, but unfortunately both these are absent ; but it does not follow\nthat the dream should be considered an example of clairvoyance or tele\npathy. It would have been interesting to know how many times Miss Luke\nhad dreamt about her friend G. during his absence, and the proportion of\nher dreams about him which were verified to those which were not, so as to\ncompare the result with a number of guesses she might have made con\ncerning him in her waking state. Moreover, there is a great deal of\ndifference of accuracy in writing down a dream before its fulfilment and\nputting it down in writing at the time the fulfilment is recorded, though it\nmay have been told before its fulfilment to some witness, as in the latter\ncase there is probably always an element of unconscious adaptation of\ndiscrepancies which is entirely absent in the former. In other words, in the\nlatter case you are told that the dream was the same as the recorded event,\n\fJan., 18!>8] Correspondence. 177\nin the other you can verify it yourself. From my own point of view there\nis a considerable effort in the report of Miss Luke's dream of the two\nweddings to adapt the idea of a communion service in her dream to that of\na social reception in the actual occurrence. She says, \" With one of these\nweddings, and I cannot tell which, there was connected the idea of some\nsocial affair \u2014 a reception\u2014and it seemed to me a little queer, and I associated\nit with the idea of a communion service carried on in a jolly sort of way.\"\nThe explanation sounds to me like this : I dreamt there was a communion\nservice, but I should have dreamt that it was a social reception, and perhaps\nI did, I am not sure. p z HeberT; M d a g p r\nNervi, near Genova, Italy, December 10th, 1897.\nSir, \u2014I am of one mind with Dr. Hebert about the desirability of inviting\ncomments and opening a general discussion in the Journal, not only on the\ncases reported, but on any kind of subject that may happen to come into\nconsideration. I found not only Dr. Hebert's commentary, but Mr. Bennett's\ncontroversy with Professor Barrett most interesting and profitable.\nSome years ago Professor Sidgwick printed in the Journal two series of\ndiagrams which I had sent by thought-transference to a correspondent at a\ndistance of many hundred miles. The experiment was a bold one, and had\nsucceeded so wonderfully that I expected comments about it, and an analysis\nof the diagrams, which have never come. Never could chance have given\nsuch a result as was obtained in both series, particularly in the second one ;\nand to my mind, at least, the experiment was conclusive.\nWell, it attracted no attention, and I have given up sending other\ncommunications of the same kind to the Journal.\nReverting to the open question of the art of dowsing, I am also of\nopinion that the movements of the twig may be produced by some hitherto\nunrecognised force in the human organism operating beyond the range of\nmuscular action in a way analogous to the working of the Rontgen rays or\nthe Marconi telegraph.\nWould it not be possible to replace in the hands of the dowser the\ntraditional twig by an instrument made in such a way that a hand or needle\nbe put into motion by that force, if it exist, without any possibility of a muscu\nlar action interfering ? Writing, as I am doing now, in a language foreign to\nmy Swiss pen, T still hope to have made my meaning intelligible. Something\nlike a clock or a manometer with a steel hand, by the means of which the\nworkings of the unknown force could not only be revealed, but measured ?\nIt seems to me that in this, and in similar subjects, a purely scientific\nexperimentation ought to be instituted. For instance, such an instrument\nas I contemplate could be placed in the hands of a willing medium, able to\nproduce motions in solid material bodies without material contact. If there\nwas in his exalted nervous system a force developed capable of producing\nmotion at a distance, that force would reveal itself on the dial.\nAnother similar case is that of levitation, which may be produced, I\nexpect, by the action of an unknown vibration of the nervous system\ncounteracting the force of gravitation. Why not ''.\ns\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [3an., 1898.\nWell, by obtaining from a medium that he should consent to be entranced\nsitting on one of those weighing machines that one finds in all the railway\nstations (at least on the Continent), even the faintest diminution of weight\nin his body could be perceived and accurately measured. And so on. Of\ncourse, if Dr. Heberts suggestion were to be acted upon, and members of\nthe S.P.R. invited to freely state their views and discuss the cases printed\nin the Proceedings or the Journal, the Journal would have to be enlarged.\nBut I expect no one would complain, except perhaps the Treasurer, and\nhis laments could be disregarded ( !).

He has,\nperhaps, not noticed the account in the Journal for December, 1896 i His\nfirst groups of experiments, with plates, were reproduced in the Journal for\nJune, 1893. \"Some time after this account appeared, Mr. Glardon sent us\ntwo more sets of experiments of the same kind, with the information that he\nwas still continuing the experiments. As no further report of these has yet\nreached us, we give here an account of all hitherto received.\" This passage is\nquoted from the Journal for December, 1896, and is followed by the account, in\nthe course of which it is said : ' ' We think that the degree of resemblance on the\nwhole is decidedly beyond what could reasonably be attributed to chance .\" And\nin the last paragraph the hope was expressed \"that the publication of these\nexperiments may encourage other members of the Society to make similar\nattempts, and record them with equal care and precision. \" It would appear\nthat Mr. Glardon was waiting for the printing of the accounts which he had\nsent, and that the Editor was waiting for Mr. Glardon to communicate the\nresults of his further experiments ; that finally the Editor, in despair\nof receiving any further accounts, \u2014(how well we know such disappointed\nhopes !)\u2014printed what he had in hand ; but that Mr. Glardon had before\nthen become tired of looking in the Journal for his accounts which did not\nappear, and is still unaware that they have appeared.

For such an explanation, if\nsound, would necessarily involve : (1) The similarity in character of both\ngroups of facts. Now this is far from true. In Mr. Davey's experiments\nwe have a complicated succession of incidents. In some \"Poltergeist\"\ncases, as well as in Home's phenomena, it is just the reverse. The\nmanifestations are of a very simple kind, and consequently much more\nlikely to be remembered and described correctly (see, e.y., some of the\nmovements of objects in the Worksop case and in the Dialectical Society's\nexperiments. It is infinitely easier to make oneself sure of the fact that no\none was touching a table when it moved, than that one has never lost one\nor two or three slates from view in the'course of several minutes). (2) The\nsecond point is still more important. In Mr. Davey's case wo have unques\ntionable evidence that he was a conjurer of exceptionable ability. Many\nyears will perhaps pass before the world sees another one like him. That it\nwas so is proved by his having baffled several conjurers ; and there can be\nno doubt that most other people would have failed altogether under the\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1898.\nsame conditions that did not prevent him from deceiving his sitters. Now\nI ask, what kind of proof have we got that Eliza R. (in the Worksop case)\nor Emma D., (in the Wem case) or the Durweston girls or the members of\nthe Dialectical Society, or, indeed, Home himself, were conjurers as good as\nDavey 1 None whatever. In fact the contrary may be considered as certain,\nso far, at least, as the Durweston girls or Emma D. or Eliza R. are con\ncerned. I therefore submit that it is unscientific to attribute to all these\npeople exceptional faculties for which we have evidence in Davey's case only.\nSpeaking for myself, for instance, I can say that if \"manifestations\" of a\nmuch less striking character than Davey's ever took place in my presence,\nit would have been absurd to put them down to conjuring on my part, a\nthing of which I am quite incapable. Now I see very little reason for\nthinking Eliza R., for instance, more adroit than myself ; and at any rate\nnone at all for putting her on a par with Davey, with his years of training\nand practice.\nThen after reading Mr. Podmore's account of slate-writing seances, an\nuninitiated reader would naturally draw the conclusion that in each and\nevery case the writing is done out of sight. But this is incorrect. For we\nhave at least one well authenticated case in which the pencil was seen to\nwrite. I refer to Dr. Elliott Coues and Mr. Emmette Coleman's experi\nments with the medium Mrs. Francis (of San Francisco), in 1891 (and\ndescribed, I think, in the Beligio-Philosophical Journal, of February 2nd,\n1892). These gentlemen repeatedly saw the pencil in motion. In some\ncases the slate had been partly withdrawn from under the table after the\nsound of writing had begun ; in other cases no table was used at all, only a\nhandkerchief being thrown over the slate to protect it from the sun-rays ;\nand finally Mrs. Francis held a slate in her hand in full view, and a whole\nsentence was written under the eyes of the observers. Now, taking into\naccount Mr. Emmette Coleman's notoriety as an exposer of fraudulent\nmediums and their methods, we may well ask Mr. Podmore what has he\nto say to that ? And may not the omission of such a fact from his review\nof the evidence leave an altogether erroneous impression in the mind of the\nreader? And does not its reality \"knock on the head\" all the elaborate\ntheories put forward to explain \" slate-writing \" ?\nWith regard to Homo's phenomena, though Mr. Podmore does not\npretend to \" expose \" them, he nevertheless puts forward a theory for which\nagain we have no scientific evidence whatever ; at any rate much less than\nfor the \"Physical Phenomena\" themselves, viz.: that hallucinations may\nbe simultaneously suggested to several sane and intelligent observers. Every\ntime an experiment was devised to prove the objectivity (not necessarily\nthe genuineness) of a mediumistic phenomenon, it has invariably succeeded ;\nI mean it has proved that objectivity\u2014which we are therefore entitled to\nassume in other similar cases donee probetur contrariurn.. This is simple logic.\nI should also like to know why Mr. Podmore does not consider Dr.\nDariex's case of the spontaneous overturning of chairs (Proceedings of the\nS.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 194) as even prima facie evidence for the operation of\nan unknown force (since he does not mention it at all). It seems to me, on\n\fFeb., 1898.] Correspondence. 183\nthe contrary, that there are few more conclusive \" telekinetic \" facts on\nrecord. It is also a pity that, though he mentions Sir W. Crookes's test\nexperiment with Mrs. A. E. Fay, he does not attempt an explanation.\u2014I\nam, dear Sir, yours very truly, Michael Petrovo-Solovovo.\nThe Value of Complex Coincidences.\nLambourne Rectory, Romford, Essex.\nSib,\u2014Miss Alice Johnson's letter in the current number of the Journal\nhas revived thoughts as to the value of coincidences, which, although they\nhelp to explain convictions apparently based on insufficient data, seem to\nme not to have received so much attention as they deserve. Mr. Gurney\nhas touched upon them incidentally in Chap. xiii. of Phantasms of the\nLiving, but even he, if I am not mistaken, has not clearly recognised their\nimportance. The point I wish to make is this : A coincidence may be\nsimple or complex. In the cases examined by the Society many involve\ncomplex coincidences, and these lose in evidential value if they are treated\nalong with others which are simple. To make my meaning plain let me\nsuppose a few cases.\nSuppose then that A thinks of B's death at a certain time, and that,\nabout that time, B dies. Here the coincidence may be casual or it may\nindicate some connection\u2014direct or indirect\u2014between A's mind and B's.\nMere coincidence may be a sufficient explanation, though it may be\ndoubtful, on the theory of chance, as to whether it is or no.\nBut suppose B falls overboard and is drowned, and A has a vivid impres\nsion of the scene, or of the fact that B has died by drowning. Here, there\nis not merely (1) the coincidence between B's death and A's impression ;\nthere is (2) the further coincidence between the manner of B's death and\nthe character of A's impression ; and (3) there is the coincidence that these\ntwo coincidences themselves coincide. Here the cumulating coincidences\nmake it far more improbable that chance alone can have occasioned them ;\nunless A knows that B is a sailor or on a voyage, in which case the thought\nof his death might suffice to suggest the circumstances, and the coincidence\nwould be a simple one in spite of its complexity of form.\nSuppose lastly that A knows nothing of B's circumstances, and that\nabout the time of his death\u2014or of some notable incident in his experience\n\u2014he has a vivid impression of B's condition, with what has happened to\nhim, and the associated circumstances. Here there are any number of coin\ncidences\u2014the coincidence is cumulative and complex\u2014and chance, provided\nour data are correct, is no longer credible when it offers to explain them.\nNow we have apparently well authenticated cases of this last kind, and,\nit seems to me, if the evidence is to be credited, that they make so strongly\nin one direction that no application of the theory of chance drawn from\nsimple coincidences has any bearing on them. But if they are independent\nof chance, then, possibly, the simpler cases are so also. We have evidence\nfor supernormal transmission of impressions which, if once granted, may\nexplain all cases.\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1898.\nMy personal opinions are of no importance, but study of the evidence\nwhich has been gathered by the Society has led me to the conclusion that\nlittle is to be hoped for from further application of the Theory of Chances.\nIf the cumulatively complex coincidence is possible, chance cannot account\nfor it, and we must assume some law which will equally well explain other\ncases. The question which seems of most importance is as to the true\nvalue of the evidence ; and this becomes the more complicated the more\nimpartially and carefully it is considered. We cannot photograph the\noriginal impression, and we cannot be sure that the description given by the\nmost honest witnesses is not misleading. An imaginative element will\ncreep in, however much we may try to guard against it, and we do not know\nwhat really happened though we know what an honest witness says, and\nthinks, has happened. The impression, upon which all depends, is\nreceived, often enough, days before it is confirmed. Notes are made of it\n\" at the time,\" letters are sometimes written to describe it ; yet, when asked\nfor, neither notes or letters are forthcoming ; or, if they chance to have\nbeen preserved, they are expressed so vaguely as to be practically worth\nless. The mere fact that they cannot be produced shows that their\nimportance was not realised at the time, and yet surely it would have been\nhad the impressions \".described been as varied and as vivid as imagination\nrepresents them ! I am sufficiently credulous to think it probable that\ncrucial cases\u2014where the cumulative complexity of the coincidence would\ndefy chance\u2014have occurred ; but it seems to me we shall gain more by\ndocumentary evidence for their reality, before it has been possible to con\nfirm them, than by any amount of calculations founded on theories of chance\nor probability. Prove one such case and it carries the probability of a\nhundred others, but so long as we have only post confirmation evidence the\nmanifold infirmities of human testimony confound us. \u2014Yours truly,\nC. A. Goodhart.\nThe \"Spirit Hypothesis\" and Mrs. Piper.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nTravellers' Club, Pall Mall, S.W., January 7th, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014Had time allowed I should have liked to have explained\nmore fully at the last General Meeting why I could not agree to the so-called\n\"Spiritualistic explanation\" of the phenomena exhibited through Mrs.\nPiper ; and I should be glad if you could find space in the Journal for a few\nremarks on the subject.\nIn the first place, then, I object to such phrases as \" Spirit Identity,\"\n\" Discarnate Souls,\" and the like, as misleading or, at any rate, valueless,\nnot so much because they convey definite ideas that are false as because\nthey convey very little meaning at all ; and their use in questions of\npsychic research may tend to keep alive crudely materialistic notions\nconcerning our spiritual existence. There aro, I believe, a large number\nof individuals who, having come across certain physical and biological\nphenomena, which happen for the moment to be discredited by the world in\n\fFeb., 1808.] Correspondence. 185\ngeneral, have chosen to style themselves \"Spiritualists\" and have evolved\namong themselves a theory of \"the other life\" which every true believer\nmust accept. This \"theory\" seems to be that our bodies are animated by\nan independent and detachable concrete entity, a sort of lump of spirit in\nhuman form, which flies out of the body at death, or sometimes even during\nlife, carrying with it the true personality, the real self in a permanent\ncondition. These souls, or spirits, are capable of moving about in space, of\ngoing to Heaven or elsewhere, and of returning occasionally to this earthly\nlife to perform all sorts of marvellous feats, which never can be properly\nexplained or understood without a frank acknowledgment of their existence\nas the true cause.\nIt seems, moreover, to be the fashion among Spiritualists to insist that\nanyone who does not believe in these lumps of spirit must necessarily be a\n\" materialist,\" one who denies that there can be any vehicle of life, or energy\nother than the tangible matter with which he is familiar.\nI say that the phrase \" Spirit Identity \" is either absurd or else it is vague\nor misleading.\nLet me illustrate my meaning by reference to a well-known natural\nphenomenon. Let us picture to ourselves the course of a tornado, such as\nnot infrequently visit certain parts of the globe. A'tornado is a powerful\nwhirlwind, about a hundred yards or so in diameter, with a progressive\nmotion extending over several miles. Now, considered from a narrow and\nsuperficial point of view, the tornado may seem to some to have an isolated\nindividual existence, independent of its effects and surroundings, though, of\ncourse, thoughtful people know that this cannot be the case. We know that\nthe various particles of matter which are set in violent motion by its energy\nare continually changing ; yet we should say, and say correctly, that it was\nthe same tornado that visited various points throughout its course ; and that\nit was the same identical tornado that did a variety of different kinds of\ndamage. What, then, is it that is the same, seeing that the actual matter set\nin motion varies from moment to moment ? The phenomenon shows con\ntinuity and duration, that's all. When the tornado has passed, the self-same\nenergy, upon which its force depended, is, our scientific knowledge convinces\nus, still existing, in some state or other ; the natural laws under which it\nacted continue to prevail, and the various effects of the storm remain ; but\nwe do not find it necessary to postulate, as perhaps some savages would, that\nsome permanent spirit entity of malignant purpose was the real storm and\nsurvives it. Thus, in the case of Mrs. Piper's \" Intelligences,\" there is most\nprobably some definite though transcendental connection between some of\nthe phenomena exhibited and the past or even future life of the individual\npersons concerned; and, indeed, many of the \"communications\" may, in\nthemselves, be of the greatest interest and value ; but it seems to me that\nthe elucidation of the mystery involved is not in the slightest degree advanced\nby the help of the \"spirit hypothesis.\"\nI would go even further and say that, even apart from any endeavour to\nexplain a future life in another world, this conception of a permanent spirit\nentity underlying our individual existence is worse than useless ; it is a\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The gist of her criticism appears to be that my\ndisquisition was irrelevant to the subject for the following reasons : 1st,\nbecause the Editor cautions his readers against assuming that every incident\nrecorded is to be regarded as evidence of something supernormal : 2nd,\nbecause my explanation is not new ; 3rd, because almost all the work of the\nS.P.H., from its foundation to the present day, has been directed towards\ntesting the adequacy of the principle of my unoriginal explanation in the\ncase of psychical phenomena ; 4th, because she does not quite understand\nhow I propose to cultivate the power of differentiation between a coincidence\nand the relation of cause and effect of two events ; 6th, because I do not\noffer any criticism of the way in which the Society has attempted to deal\nwith the question ; and, 6th, because the question is not one which can be\ndecided by an appeal to common sense and a study of individual cases.\n1st. Surely the warning could not be intended for me, as no one who has\nread my article could come to the conclusion that I assume the report I\ncriticise to be evidence of anything supernormal. But does Miss Johnson\nmean that I should not criticise it as such ? Then in that case it should\nalso be noted that the Editor elsewhere tells us that ' ' any well attested\ninformation bearing on the various subjects which are being investigated by\nthe Society (viz. : supernormal occurrences) will be gratefully received, \" etc. ;\nbut nowhere invites the report of anything which is not supernormal\u2014if I\nmay except hypnotism or mesmerism. This, from my point of view, justifies\nme in inferring that the cases published in the Journal are offered to the\nreaders as, in the opinion of the reporters of them, supernormal occurrences.\nThe idea of reporting cases as being supernormal occurrences in the Journal\nand asking the readers not to criticise them as such would show that this is\ntheir weak point. It reminds me of the pugilist Peter Jackson when he\nwas at the Aquarium. At the time that I have in my mind he had a sore\nnose, and he was hesitating in boxing as usual, but, being pressed, he said\nto his opponent, \"I am willing to box with you if you will not hit me\non the nose.\" The opponent tacitly agreed, but it was too much for him, as\nthe first thing he did was to punch the black pugilist on the nose, because\nhe saw it was his weak point. However, I will say this much : What the\nEditor does, I think, is to disclaim any responsibility for opinions expressed\nor implied by reporters or correspondents, and he publishes such cases for\nconsideration and criticism by the members, and that is why I criticise them.\n2nd. Truly, I did not offer my explanation as an original one, but\nconsidering the fitness of its application to the dream of the \"Two\n'\"X\n\fFeb., 1898.] Correspondence. 187\nWeddings,\" I thought it would bear repeating for the purpose, as I also\ngave my reasons for its application to it. I have no special predilection for\nnew ideas when old ones answer better, and I fail to see that an explanation\nloses any of its value by simply saying that it is not new. When a man\ntells me or implies to me that the earth is flat, I generally reply by\nexpounding the principle of Copernicus, and so long as some men will hold\nthe view that the earth is flat, so long will the Copernican doctrine bear\nrepeating, notwithstanding that it has already been repeated thousands\nupon thousands of times since it was originated.\n3rd. This argument implies that if I realised that so much of the work\nof the S.P.R. had been directed towards testing the adequacy of my un\noriginal explanation, I should not have brought it forward ; but I contend\nthat, not only would it be necessary to show that the work of the S.P.R.\nhad been so directed, but also that the Society had evolved some principle\nto prove or imply the inadequacy of my explanation. Miss Johnson does\nnot mention anything of the kind, and, therefore, 1 find no reason for her\nassumption that I do not realise the importance of a work, which she does\nnot say proves anything in favour of such assumption. It could only be in\ncase the Society had settled the point that such an argument could be urged\nagainst me, but Miss Johnson does not say it has, and my explanation still\nstands as good as before.\n4th. I think I have expressed very plainly in my article how I propose to\ncultivate the power of differentiation between a coincidence and a causal\nrelation of two events. Just before the quotation from my article by Miss\nJohnson, I said, \"the expression of different views would thus provide a\nschool of training in scientific methods of investigation \" after suggesting\nthat comments should be published expressing the views of the members\nindividually upon the degree of value of the evidence, and upon the degree\nof relation between the different events recorded. Does Miss Johnson deny\nor doubt that such exchange of views would cultivate and improve the faculty\nof observation among the members 1 For instance, Miss Johnson thinks\nwith me that there is very little evidence of anything beyond chance in the\ncoincidence of two events in Miss Luke's dream of the \" Two Weddings \" ;\nbut she thinks also that Miss Luke's other experiences, in which she says the\nevidence appears somewhat better, should be allowed to weigh a little in\nestimating this one. Upon this point I think differently ; I do not admit\nthat a case which might be true should be allowed to weigh anything in\nfavour of one that is false in estimating different cases, as statistics or the\ntheory of probability cannot apply in deciding upon individual cases. Nor\ndo I think even that the evidence of the \"Robbery\" is any better than\nthat of the \"Two Weddings,\" as can be seen by my explanation of it in the\nJanuary number of the Journal to account for it by known laws. It rests\nwith Miss Johnson to give her own version of it by accounting for it by laws\ngoverning supernormal occurrences which can be traced or recognised, and\nher explanation, if satisfactory, might lead me to adopt her views, or to\nimprove mine. This is the way that I proposed to cultivate our powers of\ndiscrimination ; more by discussing cases than by criticising methods or\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1898.\ntheories. If, for instance, we can explain some cases on natural grounds by\naccounting for their occurrence from known laws, we exclude them from the\nnecessity of a survey into a spiritual world to find their causes. If then, we\nproceed from individual cases to classes of cases and eliminate these in a\nsimilar manner, we again narrow the field of our investigation. If, for\nexample, we explain every phase of dreams by normal causes, we naturally\ncome to the conclusion that they are subjected to the same laws as our\nactions in the waking state ; then we shall not deem it more surprising if we\ndream of anything which subsequently occurs than when, in the waking\nstate, we anticipate something which does occur, and we may come to the\nconclusion that forebodings of all kinds are due to previous impressions.\nAgain, if we look beyond the mere fact of coincidence, and study all the\ncircumstances we can, surrounding apparently supernormal occurrences, we\nwill often find a clue to an explanation. Imagine, as an illustration of my\nmeaning, a husband going to war, leaving his family in tears. His wife\nexpresses her fear that he may never return to her alive, which is a very\nlegitimate fear under the circumstances. He encourages her, saying that\nGod will surely protect him for her sake and their children's ; this lights up\na hope in her heart which makes her feel confident that he will return safe to\nher. She may call this a presentiment, a foreboding, or anything you like,\nbut it is a very usual apprehension of danger coming or hope of escaping\nit, but the two sides present themselves alike before her mind. After his\ndeparture she thinks of him continually, she dreams many times that she\nhas seen him well, that he is wounded, that he is dead. In her waking state\nand in her dreams he is continually the object of her thoughts. What\nwonder that once it might happen at nearly the same time as the real thing\noccurs. The whole panorama of what might possibly occur goes through her\nmind so many times that it seems probable enough that whilst he is being\nshot she may think or dream of it. Then if he returns she can say she knew\nhe would return ; if he does not, she can say she had a presentiment of it\nwhen he left her and said so, and can probably call witnesses to corroborate\nher statement and in both cases she would be right ; but the fact that she\nviewed both sides with uncertainty precludes the idea of any supernormal\nagency at work. Again, it is not unreasonable that if her husband is killed\nshe may lay more stress upon the presentiment of fear she had at the time\nof his departure than upon the gleam of hope she also had, but which she\npractically forgets under the circumstances of the influence of her grief, and\nso would she forget her presentiment of fear under the influence of the\ndelight which his safe return would produce in her, and, in that state of\nconviction, it would be almost superhuman on her part not to stretch a\npoint and go a little beyond accuracy in her attempt to convince a sceptical\nlistener that not only were her facts correctly observed but also her\ntheory accurate, which theory it is very difficult, not to say impossible,\nfor her to consider apart from such observed facts. The coincidence of\ndifferent unrelated events is also worthy of consideration. It is difficult to\ngrasp the idea of the tumultuousness of various incidents which occur in\nthis busy world, and a simplified analogy may perhaps convey a more\n\fFeb., 1898.] Correspondence. 189\nprecise notion of it than an observation of the world itself. Let me, there\nfore, introduce my readers into a clockmaker's establishment, containing\nseveral hundred clocks keeping time, as a miniature representation of the\nworld at work producing incidents. These would be represented by the\nticks of the clocks, and so we could alter our statement quoted by Miss\nJohnson \" There are so many incidents which occur in this world that many\nof them must necessarily coincide \" into the more simple one of \" There are\nso many ticks which occur in this establishment that many of them must\nnecessarily synchronise.\" In fact, if we give a moment's attention to the\nbehaviour of the clocks, we will find that the ticks of two clocks which do\nnot synchronise continually get nearer and nearer in time until they do\nsynchronise and then depart more from that synchronism until they again\nbegin to get nearer and nearer in time and so on ; a further observation may\ndisclose the fact that one of the clocks sometimes strikes the hours exactly\n-at the time that another non-striking clock marks it exactly ; or sometimes\nthat two synchronous ticks are emitted from two clocks painted red or having\na similar case. Now the question which so often crops up, viz. : Why did\ntwo such events occur simultaneously ? Why did Miss Luke, for instance,\ndream of being robbed on the night that she was robbed ? may well find a coun\nterpart here. Why did these particular clocks tick together at that particular\ntime ? Why did a clock strike the hour at the time a non-striking clock was\nmarking it ? Why did two clocks which were painted red tick together\n-and not two painted differently ? And although the querist may admit that\nthere is no causal relation between the non-synchronous ticks of two clocks,\nhe may not so easily come to the same conclusion with regard to the ticks\nwhich do synchronise and more especially with regard to the clocks that\nare painted alike. But, looking at the result from a broad point of view, we\nfind an adequate cause in each clock for all the ticks that it emits,\nsynchronous and non-synchronous alike, without linking them with any\nmysterious cause ; and, if we do not find an adequate cause, we cannot\naccept an evidence of mere coincidence as a proof of causal relation without\nunderstanding in some degree, as far as our mind is capable of appreciating\nit, the mode of action of that cause or the principle upon which it works, and\nwe must acknowledge our ignorance in the matter instead of resting satisfied\nwith an inadequate interpretation. It is very little indeed that we do under\nstand of the action of causes ; but, so far as we do, we must expect and\nrequire it before accepting any theory as fact. The possibility of any thing\nwhich I admit almost any where does not prove in any way its actuali ty.\nMiss Johnson then asks \"What exactly\u2014apart from metaphysics\u2014do\nwe mean by the relation of cause and effect ? Do we mean anything more\nthan that two events have occurred so often together that mankind have\nagreed to consider that they are causally connected ? The two events may\nbe of an absolutely diverse kind, such as a man walking across the street,\nand my consciousness of seeing him do it. The only ground I have for\nassuming that my perception is caused by his action, is that the two events\nhave so often occurred together.\" I do not think it would be at all desirable\nto enter into an elaborate philosophical discussion about the nature of the\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1898.\nconnection of cause and effect as conceived by the human mind, which\nwould not be relevant to our subject nor probably interesting to the general\nreaders of this Journal. The main point at issue is this : The position\nassumed by Miss Johnson, which is, in substance, the doctrine of causality\nadvocated by Dr. Brown or a modification of it, is as follows : We observe\nthe occurrence of two events together repeatedly and, in the course of time\nand in proportion to the frequency of such occurrence, we agree to consider-\nthat they are causally connected. The only ground we have to come to such\nagreement is that of frequency of occurrence. This theory considers the\ntwo events as isolated facts, and does not admit the necessity of the effect\nfollowing the cause, nor our being able to understand, in any degree, how\nthe cause acts to bring about the effect. It means, in the first instance, that,\nif a spark emitted from a white hot poker into a heap of gunpowder causes\nit to explode, another heap of the same kind, in the same condition, may or\nmay not be exploded by thrusting the poker into it emitting a thousand\nsimilar sparks, and, in the second, that a man who goes to Maskelyne and\nCooke and sees one of their tricks performed, but cannot understand how-\nit is done, knows as much about it as the man who does the trick. But,\nmoreover, we have many instances in the world in which frequency is not\ntaken as a guide to convince us of the relation of cause and effect, and the\nfollowing are very conclusive to me. In 1846, Leverrier wrote to Dr. Galle,\nastronomer to the Royal Observatory at Berlin, informing him of the\nconclusion he had arrived at by calculations, and requesting him to direct his\ntelescope to a certain point which he indicated in the heavens, where he\nexpected an unknown planet to be visible. The Doctor did so and, on that\nsame night, found the planet as indicated by Leverrier. This was how the\nplanet Neptune was discovered. Now, the element of frequency could have\nhad nothing to do with the idea of cause and effect in this instance, as the\nplanet was never observed by Leverrier before he drew his inferences from\nthe disturbances which he had observed in the planet Uranus. The answer\nwhich would be given by the advocates of the doctrine referred to would\nprobably be that the observation of other events under similar conditions\nhad led to the inference ; but this could not apply to this particular instance\nwhere one of the events had never been observed, and it can only be through\nthe knowledge of the mode of action of a cause that such inference can be\ndrawn. One more example where the frequency principle although present\ndoes not lead to any inference. Cocks crow before sunrise, and continue to-\ndo so until the luminary is above the horizon and, needless to say, these two-\nevents have happened innumerable times together, and yet I have never\nheard anyone suggest that cock crowing contributed anything in causing the*\nsun to rise above the horizon. All that we learn, apart from history taken\nin its broadest sense, is the result of a more or less accurate interpretation\nof the relation of cause and effect, all mental progress is to be attributed\nto the same cause. The training of the mechanic, for instance, and his\nsuperiority or inferiority are due to his more or less correct interpretation of\nthe relation of cause and effect which he realises and carries out in the\nmanipulation of his tools so as to bring about certain results to attain his\n\fFeb., 1898.] Correspondence. 191\nobject ; but, of course, this interpretation, like any other knowledge, is only\nrelative and partial. Miss Johnson further says : \" Suppose, however, that\nI constantly had this impression and that there was sometimes a real man in\nthe street at the time, and sometimes not. How could we tell whether\u2014on\nthe occasion when the man was there\u2014there was, or was not, any connection\nbetween his presence and my impression ? \" As I hold the view that no\nspecial effect can be produced without a special cause, and no cause can act\nwithout producing an effect, it follows that I consider that what is produced\nby the presence of the man walking across the street cannot identically be\nproduced in his absence, and the impression which could be produced in his\nabsence could be distinguished from that produced by his presence by an\nadequate interpretation of the relation of cause and effect in the case. Miss\nJohnson seems to pin her faith to statistics and the chances of probability to\neffect such distinction. I do not. Statistics can only be useful when a large\nnumber of cases under a supposed influence can be compared with a similar\nnumber removed from that influence, but the oases of supernormal occur\nrences as admitted by Miss Johnson are comparatively so few that statistics\ncan be of no avail. Moreover, statistics cannot test the degree of value of\nthe evidence, which is the main thing in these cases. It follows, therefore,\nthat I do not imply, as stated by Miss Johnson in her article, that the main\nproblem before the S. P.R. is of the nature she describes: The object of the\nSociety being the investigation of cases, its problem is to collect the evidence\nwhich will link these supernormal occurrences with their causes by a\nnecessary sequence, in such a way as to be able to distinguish the conditions\nunder which such causes will act to produce such effects. Miss Johnson,\naccording to the doctrine of causality which she advocates, regards the two\nevents as isolated facts, not linked by a necessary sequence, and, therefore,\nexcludes the subject of their relation from consideration. Hence the\ndifference of our views.\n5th. Miss Johnson says that I do not offer any criticism of the way in\nwhich the Society has attempted to deal with the problem in question. I\ncannot see how any censure can be passed upon what I have not said. I\nnever proposed such a thing. I only suggested the criticism of cases. A\nvariety of methods is most desirable under the circumstances.\n6th. The question can only be decided by proof, and to know whether it\nis proved or not, we must use our common sense. In investigating, we may\ndisregard the guidance of common sense if, by that, we mean the employ\nment of the empirical method of investigation, but we can ill afford to part\nwith such a valuable friend in any kind of action. Moreover, I am decidedly\nof opinion that the study of individual cases is the means of determining\nthe degree of relation which may exist between their occurrence and their\nsupposed causes, and it was this opinion which suggested to me the idea of\ncriticising the various cases in the Journal.\nIn my last article I suggested a substitute for the expression \"uncon\nscious cerebration,\" but I think it was not a good selection 1 made. The\nobjection, I find, to the expression is that cerebration, being the response to\nor result of some impulse, internal or external, some degree of consciousness\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Feb., 1898.\n.of that impulse must take place to excite cerebration, but such cerebration\nmay not be memorised, so that we cannot remember it. By substituting\n\" unremembered cerebration \" it would imply simply that the cerebration is\nnot at the time of speaking remembered, but, under such circumstances, it\nmay have been memorised and remembered subsequently many times, though\nforgotten at the time of speaking. The expression which I wish to sub\nstitute is \" unmemorised cerebration,\" that is cerebration which has never\nbeen in the memory. p z HeberTi M d\nRECENT CASES.\nL. 1099.

From Mr. Frederick Lane.\nAdelphi Theatre, December 20th, 1897.\nIn the early morning of the l(5th December, 1897, I dreamt that I saw the\nlate Mr. Terriss lying in a state of delirium or unconsciousness on the stairs\nleading to the dressing rooms in the Adelphi Theatre. He was surrounded\nby people engaged at the theatre, amongst whom were Miss Millward and\none of the footmen who attend the curtain, both of whom I actually saw a\nfew hours later at the death scene. His chest was bare and clothes torn\naside. Everybody who was around him was trying to do something for his\ngood. This dream was in the shape of a picture. I saw it like a tableau on\nwhich the curtain would rise and fall. I immediately after dreamt that wo\ndid not open at the Adelphi Theatre that evening. I was in my dressing\nroom in the dream, but this latter part was somewhat incoherent. The next\nmorning on going down to the theatre for rehearsal the first member of the\nCompany I met was Miss Olive Haygate, to whom I mentioned this dream.\nOn arriving at the theatre I also mentioned it to several other members of\nthe Company including Messrs. Creagh Henry, Buxton, Carter Bligh, etc.\nThis dream, though it made such an impression upon me as to cause me to\nrelate it to my fellow artists, did not give me the idea of any coming\ndisaster. I may state that I have dreamt formerly of deaths of relatives, and\nother matters which have impressed me, but the dreams have never impressed\nme sufficiently to make me repeat them the following morning and have\nnever been verified.

Of the six retiring Members of Council at the end of 1897, one,\nDr. C. Lockhart Robertson, had been removed by death. The other\nfive retiring members were all willing to stand for re-election, and had\nallowed themselves to be nominated. One other member had also been\nnominated. Notice of these nominations had been sent round to\nmembers in accordance with the Articles of Association. These six\nnominations being sufficient to fill up the vacancies in the elected\nMembers of the Council, and no other nominations having been made,\nthe President said that he had only to declare that the following six\nMembers were duly elected Members of the Council :\u2014Mr. F. W. H.\nMyers, Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S., Mr. Sydney C. Scott, Mr. H. Babington\nSmith, C.S.I., Mr. R. Pearsall Smith, and Dr. J. Venn, F.R.S.\nIn reference to the present position of the Society, the President\nsaid that the total number of names of all classes on the list of the\nSociety on January 1st, 1897, was 906. The elections during the year\n1897 had been 73. Against these were to be set 37 resignations,\n14 removals by death, and 17 names struck off the list, of persons who\nhad been lost sight of, or who had become merely nominal members,\nthus showing the number of the Society at the commencement of the\npresent year to be 911. The American Branch had diminished in\nnumbers during last year from 420 to 414.\nThe President went on to say that he had before him an audited\nstatement of the Income and Expenditure during 1897, which would,\n\fMar., 1898.] Meeting of the Council. 199\nas usual, be printed iu the Journal. He also had before him a state\nment of Assets and Liabilities at the end of 1897. This showed a\nconsiderably smaller indebtedness than usual at the end of the year ;\nthe printing account for all the publications during 1897 having been\nfully paid. It also showed an improvement in the position of the\nSociety during the year of a little over \u00a3100.

W. H. Myers. Mr. Lang began by pointing out that the\npractice of crystal-gazing in one form or another was very wide-spread.\nHe had found instances of it among the Maoris, the Red Indians,\nAustralians, etc., and the result of his anthropological survey, taken in\nconnection with the cases adduced by \" Miss X.\" (Proceedings, Vol. V.),\nmade it seem probable that so widely diffused and ancient a usage was\nbased on actual experience of hallucinations thus evoked. Mr. Lang\nreferred to several cases of \" scrying \" among his friends, especially that\nof a young lady whom he called \"Miss Angus,\" who developed a\npower of \"seeing\" in a glass ball persons and places unknown to her,\nbut familiar to strangers among whom she was living. Such objections\nas that the visions might have been \" guessed,\" or that the histories of\nthe persons for whom she looked in the crystal might have been\nstudied beforehand, or that the descriptions were merely chance\ncoincidence, etc., were considered, and the author then quoted various\nvisions of Miss Angus in detail, with the corroborative accounts of\nthe persons concerned. They seemed to him to be good examples of\n\"thought-transference.\" He inclined to think that crystal visions\nwere more analogous to illusions hypnagogigues than to anything else\nin common experience, but the crystal-gazers were always in their\nnormal condition when scrying.\nThe President said that it would be interesting to know precisely\nwhere the images seen in \"crystals\" appeared, and of what size they\nwere. How could all the details described in the visions referred to,\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1898.\nbe seen in a small crystal ball 1 Possibly the images were projected,\nas it were, in the space in front of the ball. Another question\nconcerned the nature of the image, and a similar question applied to\n\"ghosts;\"\u2014was it a real thing in front of one in space, or was it\nthe result of a nerve change acting downwards on the retina, and\nthus perhaps producing a retinal image 1 Was it, in brief, caused by\nan outside object, or was it a brain image ? It would hardly appear\nsolid, he thought, if a brain image only. He referred to methods of\ntesting the image for externality, such as the production of two images\nby pressure on one of the eyeballs, or by looking at it through a\ndoubly refracting prism, the rotation of the images by turning the\nprism, etc.\nMiss Goodrich Freer said that in her experience the \" crystal\npictures \" appeared to be projected outside of the crystal. One great\ndifficulty experienced by persons experimenting in crystal-gazing was\nin focussing the eyes correctly. They should be directed to a point\nabout half an inch below the surface of the crystal, to avoid disturb\nances caused by reflections, from the surface of the crystal, of the\nsurrounding objects. The size of the ball used was not material. She\nused one the diameter of which was little more than a shilling. The\nimages were not actually existent in the crystal, but the crystal acted\nas suggestion and stimulus on images projected from one's own brain.\nShe had tried all kinds of experiments on the lines suggested by the\nPresident, with Iceland spar, optical instruments, etc., but the pictures\nbehaved as if real objects. Nevertheless, she could not but regard\nthem as subjective. Miss Goodrich Freer added that in the case of\nthe subject of whom Mr. Lang wrote, and whom she knew well and\nhad experimented with, it was interesting to know that she was not\nonly an accomplished crystal-gazer, but also what, for want of a better\nname, we call a \" Seer.\"\nAnother paper by Mr. Andrew Lang on \"Oppositions of Science\"\nwas then read by Mr. F. W. H. Myers. In this paper the author\nconsidered various criticisms brought by Herr Edmund Parish in his\nwork Hallucinations and Illusions, against the views expressed by the\nauthors of the Report on the Census of Hallucinations (Proceedings,\nVol. X.). He dealt in some detail with the views of Herr Parish,\npointing out various inaccuracies in his statements, and concluding\nthat Herr Parish's arguments were invalid.\nOnly a brief account of\" Mr. Lang's papers is given here, as it\nis hoped that they will appear in full in Part XXXIV. of our\nProceedings.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\fMar., 1898.] Correspondence. 203\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nThe Validity of the ' Spirit ' Hypothesis.\nOxford.\nThe spiritualist is, as it were, the herring of the intellectual world. He\nis fair game \/and nutritious prey for all the leviathans of the deep\u2014\ntheological scientific, and philosophic ; all are leagued against him and\nravenous to devour him ; his sole safety lies in obscurity or flight. I am\nconscious, therefore, of acting in a perfectly quixotic fashion in saying a\nword in defence of the logical status of the ' spirit ' hypothesis ; the more\nso as I am not a spiritualist myself, and my philosophic opinions are quite\nindependent of the proof or disproof of ' spirit ' communications. But the\ninterests of clear thinking and fair play seem to render it desirable that\nsome reply should be made to Mr. Lane-Fox's self-confident attack upon\nthe philosophic value of the ' spirit ' hypothesis in the February number\nof the Journal. Mr. Lane-Fox seems to take high philosophic and\neven ethical ground in his objections to the obnoxious theory of personal\npersistence, but I believe it can be shown that his argument proves little\nbut his own metaphysical prejudice against personality. For, of course,\nto anyone who can not or will not accept the existence and significance of\npersonality, no evidence can be sufficient to prove its persistence, and there\nis no inanity of vagueness, no extravagance of pantheistic assumption,\nwhich he will not prefer to the simple admission that the mysterious fact we\ncall personality may pervade other modes of existence than ours and persist\nthrough the change we call death.\nI do not know what Mr. Lane-Fox's particular brand of pantheism is,\nbut I am strongly convinced that no pantheism ever yet explained anything\nin particular, or failed to dissolve into vacuity the moment it was really\nbrought into contact with a fact. Hence the attempt to substitute pan\ntheistic notions for personality is necessarily futile.\nAnd it is also tolerably obvious that Mr. Lane-Fox's comparison of a\nhuman spirit to a tornado is worthless. A tornado is not, so far as we know,\nself-conscious, and it is the impenetrable exclusiveuess of self-consciousness\nwhich forces us to infer the existence of the self-conscious spirits of our\nfellow-men. Moreover, to explain personal identity by tornadoes involves\nthe vicious method of explaining the higher by the lower, and ignores the\nfact (well known to philosophers) that all our explanations of natural\nphenomena ultimately consist only in projecting into them more or less\nimperfect analogies with human nature.\nAgain, Mr. Lane-Fox appears to lay much stress on the dependence of\nthe ' spirit ' hypothesis on the old conception of substance as an unknow\nable substrate of phenomena. That theory is doubtless wrong (for it defeats\nits own purpose), but so long a3 the language of ordinary life is used, and\nno attempt is made at a precision (which is perhaps possible only for a\ntrained philosopher), no objection can fairly be made. And in any case so\nlong as the scientific theory of matter embodies the same conception, the\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1898.\nspiritualists sin in good company. Still I should be the last to complain of\na precise use of terms, and what I really take exception to in Mr. Lane-Fox's\nobjection to \"the permanent spiritual entity underlying our individual\nexistence,\" is that he should calmly suppose that the spiritualist hypothesis\nnecessarily depends on an obsolete theory of substance. Let him adopt\nLotze's or James's theory of substance and personal identity and take it that\nthe self (or ego or ' spirit ') is nothing beyond the self-consciousness\nand continuity of the psychic processes, and he will find that the ' spirit '\nhypothesis works even better than before.\nIn his final innuendo also, in which he seeks to create a prejudice by\nrepresenting individual existence as \" a baneful influence,\" there is little\ncause for alarm. It is doubtless true that personality is a power for evil as\nwell as for good ; but, then, what is the alternative to it 1 If you take away\npersonality, you take away evil and good altogether, and deprive the world\nof every element of value. A ' thing ' or a ' tornado ' cannot be evil,\nbecause it cannot be good nor feel anything to be good.\nI come next to the vulgar charge of \" crude materialism \" brought against\nthe ' spirit ' hypothesis. That is doubtless true as against many spiritualists\nas it is against many scientists. We cannot, alas, expect ordinary men to\nmove with the safety that is born of familiarity amid the subtleties of\nmetaphysics. But to accuse the ' spirit ' hypothesis (as to accuse science as\nsuch) of crude materialism is a very different matter. In fact it would be far\ntruer to retort the charge of crude materialism upon many of the critics of\nspiritualism, and it has often been a marvel to me as I read their\nastoundingly short-sighted arguments that they should never have availed\nthemselves even of the slight tincture of idealism which would have removed\nthe obstruction of their imagination and enabled them to appreciate the\nsuggestiveness in the theories of the spiritualists.\nFor surely, once we are awakened to the possibilities of idealism, by far\nthe greater part of the spiritualist imagery about the future life becomes\nperfectly intelligible. The world here and now can no longer be regarded as\na place or thing which has an absolute [existence incompatible with that of\nother worlds. The phenomenal world must be conceived as a state of\nconsciousness, and the succession of conscious states may take us into a\nsuccession of worlds. Have these critics of spiritualism never reflected that\nevery night, if they dream, they are transported into another world ? And\nif A's action affects B's dream, is this not at the time for B an ultra-mundane\ninfluence 1 Perhaps I may stimulate reflection on these topics by adding a\nfew paradoxes on the subject of ' death.'\nNo man has ever yet perished without annihilating also the world in\nwhich he lived.\nNo man has ever yet seen another die ; but if he had, he would have\nwitnessed his own annihilation.\nXiavrav \\pT\\parav peTpov avdptatros, tuiv pcv ov Tav ins ?<rrt, twv o'ovk ov t<ov\nas OVK i'(TTlU-\nThe world is the greatest of all conventions ; yet all are unconventional\nenough to leave it.\n\fMar., 1898.] Correspondence. 205\nTo die is to cut off our communications with our friends ; but do they cut\nus or we them, or both, or neither 1\nIf Mr. Lane-Fox has any trouble with these, he should read Alice Through\nthe Looking Glass and ponder on the Red King's game !\nPhilosophically, then, the spiritualist hypothesis is quite thinkable and\nco nsistent with what we know of the nature and procedure of this world,\ni.e., it cannot be rejected a priori. On the question whether the evidence\ni s sufficient to prove it de facto, I do not presume to offer an opinion ; but I\ncan see no reason why it should not prove identity by the same methods as\nwe now use in our terrestrial affairs. If A gives me information I have\nreason to believe B alone knew, I infer that he got it from B ; and if A\ngives me an elaborate description of B, which turns out to be right, it is\nmore probable that he has seen B than that he compiled his account with\nt he help of the Devil or the Absolute. And the fact that A happens to be a\n' medium ' and B to be ' dead ' does not, as far as I can see, alter the canons\nof criticism applicable to the case. The fact therefore that all these super-\nnormal phenomena (supposing their occurrence to be proved) tend so\nstrongly towards a personal form, that they are interested in persons and\ngive information about persons, prima facie tells in favour of the simplest\nview, viz., that they are due to what they claim to be due to\u2014persons in\nthe same sense in which I infer Mr. Lane-Fox to be a person. Of course\nour first assumption may be quite wrong ; the matter may be very different\nand far more complicated. But as a working hypothesis\u2014supposing the facts\nto be as reported\u2014there seems to be ample ground for speaking of ' spirits.'\nAnd this seems to be the more appropriate if we gratefully recognize the\nvagueness of the term ' spirits. ' Mr. Lane-Fox complains of it because it\n\" conveys very little meaning at all \" (though I am at a loss to reconcile this\nstatement with the amount of mistaken meaning he subsequently discovers\nto be connoted by the term), but in reality this would seem to be an\nadvantage. For nothing can be more fatal in beginning the exploration of a\nnovel study than to contract the range of one's vision by the adoption of too\n-definite and rigid a terminology. Until, then, a better phrase has been\nsuggested, I should like to see the term ' spirit ' used in as purely\ndescriptive a sense as possible, and without prejudice to anything that might\nbe discovered about it. It seems to me to beg far fewer questions and to\n-describe far more of the apparent facts than any alternative I have ever\nheard of, whether 'angels,' 'demons,' 'brain waves,' ' odic forces,'\n' Mahatmas,' etc. And even if for scientific or metaphysical reasons we\nshould become unwilling to admit it into a theory of ultimate existence, it\nwould probably continue to be a useful term for classificatory purposes, just\nas in biology the discovery of evolution has not superseded the discrimi\nnation of species as a methodological convenience.\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nThe \"Spirit Hypothesis\" and Mrs. Piper.\nSir, \u2014As a Spiritualist perhaps I may be permitted to correct Mr. Lane-\nFox's definition of the same as a person who has \" evolved for himself a\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mae., 1898.\ntheory of the other life which every true believer must accept.\" Mr. Lane-\nFox has, of course, not wilfully misrepresented us ! He has spoken accord\ning to his knowledge and betrayed its limitations. As a Buddhist, Mr.\nLane-Fox probably has a belief in some sort of existence for the individual\nafter the dissolution of the physical body, and as he quarrels with our\nconception of a \"spiritual body,\" we must conclude him to be in possession\nof information which will upset that theory. I do not say \" our \" theory,\nbecause Spiritualists have not evolved one of their own, but have simply\naccepted pro tern, certain statements made by the communicating intelli\ngences. Directly Mr. Lane-Fox can suggest to U3 a better working\nhypothesis (one that fits our facts), we shall be delighte d to give it a fair\ntrial, being anxious for truth at all costs. A \" lump of spirit \" is a curious\ncontradiction in terms, and one not in vogue among Spiritualists, who have\nadopted their title as expressing a belief in the spiritual nature of man,\nand the possibility of communicating with him after his emancipation from\nthe flesh. Perhaps Mr. Lane-Fox will kindly bear this in mind the next\ntime he seeks to describe us, as he cannot again be excused on the ground of\nignorance. The tornado illustration scarcely serves as a digestive, and it is\nat least likely that the account Mrs. Piper's intelligences have given of\nthemselves is as accurate as the purely speculative opinions of a gentleman\nwho has too strong a bias towards one particular set of ideas to be able to\nappreciate spiritualistic phenomena at their true value. Mr. Lane-Fox's\nconcluding observation that the \"conception of a permanent spirit entity\nunderlying our individual existence is worse than useless ; is a pernicious\ndelusion, having a baneful influence in this world, and responsible for much\nof the egotism, greed, and malignity with which our present lives are\nafflicted,\" will surely astonish most people, while it assures Spiritualists\nthat they might very easily \" go further and fare worse ! \"\nE. Browne.\nCause op Confusion in Some \"Spirit Communications.\"\nDeab Sir, \u2014On the assumption that the spiritistic hypothesis is the true\none by which to explain the origin of the trance utterances of Mrs. Piper\nand automatic communications, the following suggestion may be worth con\nsidering as a possible explanation of the confusion which characterises those\nmessages which purport to come from an individual whose death has been\npreceded by long illness or the weakness of old age .\nIn spiritualist writings, such as Mrs. De Morgan's book \"From Matter\nto Spirit,\" and Sarah Underwood's \"Automatic Writings,\" it is stated that\nwhen the spirit leaves the earthly body it takes with it a fine substance,\nwhich is akin to the physical body and through which the spirit can still act\nupon matter and communicate with those in the flesh ; it is also stated that\nthis fine substance is deciduous and in a more advanced stage of the spirit's\nprogress is altogether put off.\nIn an extract from the work of a German spiritualist, H. Werner, and in\none from \"The Seeress of Prevorst \" this substance is called \" nerve spirit \"\n(see \"From Matter to Spirit,\" pp. 132-137). In Sarah Underwood's\n\fMar., 1898.] Correspondence. 207\n\" Automatic Writings \" another word is used ; in reply to a question relating\nto the conditions necessary for communicating, the answer is: \"Sensory\nducts are born with mortals which are here useless, and at rebirth these\nmust be eliminated \" ; and on another occasion she was told that \"all sense\nperception will slowly die out \" of the spirit life.\nIf this is a correct presentment of the facts then we have a clue to the\nconfusion which is felt in communicating by those whose physical body had\nundergone long weakness or disease. For in all reasonable probability the\nsubstance so closely allied to it would be debilitated also, and thus whilst the\nspirit itself is intact the medium by which it operates to earth is probably\nrendered inefficient. I hope that those who have had experience in these\ncommunications will give their opinions on the tentative explanation, either\nto corroborate it or to show its invalidity.\u2014I am, yours faithfully,\nHelen Dallas.\nComplex Coincidences and Chance Coincidence.\nSir,\u2014Mr. Goodhart in his letter to the February Journal has raised an\ninteresting question as to how far a \" complex coincidence \" is more valuable\nevidentially than a simple one ; if, e.q., A. at the time of B.'s death has a\nwaking vision of B. and of some unusual circumstances connected with the\ndeath that have actually occurred ; is it less easy, as Mr. Goodhart main\ntains, to put the coincidence down to chance than if A. merely saw an\napparition of B. ? If we were sure that the report of the incident was\ncorrect, we should, of course, all answer with Mr. Goodhart in the\naffirmative. But I think there are generally two weak points in evidence of\nthis kind. One is that well-authenticated \"complex coincidences\" seem\nto be rare compared with simple ones, \u2014judging at least, from the evidence\nreceived by the S.P.R., \u2014and their rarity tends, since no one case can be\nsaid to rest on absolutely irreproachable evidence, to depreciate somewhat\nthe value of the whole class. The second difficulty to my mind is that the\nadditional circumstances of the vision are much more likely to be inaccurately\nreported than the vision itself.\nOne more point. The complex coincidence is apt to involve a \"vision \"\nrather than a \"hallucination,\"\u2014that is, an imaginary scene which displaces\nin the percipient's consciousness his real surroundings, rather than a\nhallucinatory impression, e.g., of a human figure, which mixes with and\nforms part of his perception of his surroundings. Such visions may be\nhardly distinguishable from dreams, and the weakness of dreams as evidence\nof anything supernormal is generally admitted. Veridical dreams, as\nreported, often afford instances of complex coincidences, but they are apt to\ncontain also what are sometimes called symbolic, but what I should prefer\nto call incorrect details, which detract from the value of the correct ones.\nAnd we must further allow for the tendency to remember the correct rather\nthan the incorrect details.\nThese considerations of course emphasise still further the need insisted\non by Mr. Goodhart of improving our evidence, and especially of recording\nall experiences fully before confirmation. I am inclined to think with him\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Mar., 1898.\nthat at the present stage we cannot go further than we have done in\napplying the theory of probability to cases. Any calculation of chances\ndepends, of course, on the assumption that the incidents treated of are\ncorrectly reported, which is a question of evidence. To investigate the\nevidence is the first and most important step in the enquiry, and has always\nbeen treated as such by the investigators who have attempted to test the\nhypothesis of chance coincidence. But I may point out that, after rejecting\nall cases that seemed insufficiently evidenced, their calculations only assume\nthe accuracy of a certain proportion of the remaining reports, so that, as\nremarked in the Report on the Census of Hallucinations, p. 248, \"the\nevidence must break down in a wholesale way in order to destroy our\nargument.\" Though, however, I agree that we cannot go further in using\nthis method at present, I think we should not ignore all that has been done\nby the use of it in the past.\nOf the points in debate between Dr. Hebert and myself, I am afraid\nthat readers of the Journal must be already weary. I will not therefore\nspend time in repudiating a number of views on various subjects svhich\nDr. Hebert\u2014no doubt through obscurities of expression in my former letter\n\u2014erroneously attributes to me. But in some matters 1 should like to make\nmy own position clearer. Taking them in the order used by Dr. Hebert :\u2014\n(1). My remark that cases appearing in the Journal were not necessarily to\nbe regarded as evidence of anything supernormal was, as he surmises, not\nintended as a warning for him, but, on the contrary, as an endorsement of\nhis views.\n(2) and (3). I did not object to his theory that cases suggestive of\ntelepathy could be explained by chance coincidence because the theory was\nnot new. No doubt, if old explanations fit the facts, it is unnecessary to seek\nfor new ones. My contention is that the S.P.R. has published a great mass\nof evidence and reasoning which tend to show that in this particular case\nthe old explanation does not hold. I supposed that Dr. Hebert must be\nfamiliar with this evidence, and therefore I did not think it necessary to do\nmore than refer to the works in which it is to be found. But as his last\nletter leads me to think that my supposition must have been mistaken, I\nmay quote a part of the last paragraph of the Report on the Census of\nHallucinations (see Proceedings of the S.P.R., Vol. X., p. 394.) \"The\nmost important part of our work lies in the corroboration, on a much wider\nbasis, of the conclusion already drawn by Mr. Gurney from his Census in\n1885. Between deaths and apparitions of the dying person a connection exists\nuhich is not due to chance alone. This we hold as a proved fact.\" Here, of\ncourse, is represented merely the personal opinion . of those who were\nresponsible for the drawing up of the Report ; and it is naturally impossible\nto give within the compass of a letter to the Journal the evidence and\nreasoning which occupy some 400 pages of the Proceedings. But, since the\nbook is accessible to all the world, I cannot help feeling that it would be\nmore profitable to point out whatever flaws exist in its method of reasoning\nthan to raise again ab initio the question which the writers after several years\nof research have answered.\n\fMar., 1898.] Correspondence. 20&\n(4) With Dr. Hebert's general principle of explaining occurrences by\nknown laws before having recourse to hypothetical ones, we should all, of\ncourse, again agree. But he does not suggest any \" natural grounds \" which\nhave escaped the notice of those who advocate the theory of telepathy. The\nquestion, for instance, whether anxiety could have caused the apparently\nveridical hallucinatory impressions which the writers brought forward as\nevidence of telepathy, was very fully dealt with in the Report on the Census\nof Hallucinations, as it had previously been in Phantasms of the Living, and\nwas answered in both cases in the negative .\nTurning to the more difficult question of what we mean by \" cause and\neffect,\" it does not seem to me that Dr. Hebert has demonstrated the\ninaccuracy of the common definition which I used, that by cause and effect\nwe mean that two events have occurred so often together that we are led to\nbelieve them to be causally connected. I should indeed claim as good\ninstances of this definition the two cases which he gives to show its\ninadequacy. The second of these he states as follows: \u2014 \"One more\nexample where the frequency principle although present does not lead to\nany inference. Cocks crow before sunrise, and . . . these two events\nhave happened innumerable times together, and yet I have never heard any\none suggest that cock crowing contributed anything in causing the sun to\nrise.\" Nor have I, but I should not be at all surprised to hear some one\nsuggest that the sunrise contributed something towards causing cocks to\ncrow.\nDr. Hebert's first case is the discovery by Leverrier (and Adams) of the\nplanet Neptune, in which, he says, \"the element of frequency could have\nhad nothing to do with the idea of cause and effect,\" since Neptune had\nnever been observed before its existence was conjectured, and in such cases,\n\"it can only be through the knowledge of the mode of action of a cause\nthat such inference can be drawn.\"\nNow, it seems to me probable that Dr. Hebert and I really agree in the\nmain in our conceptions of what we mean by cause and effect and that our\napparent discrepancy comes from our each representing a different aspect of\nthe same idea. Dr. Hebert is, I think, considering a general principle,\nwhile I was speaking of a way of regarding particular cases. Most people,\nI suppose, hold the general principle of causation,\u2014that is, they hold that\nno event is isolated, but depends on something preceding it and leads on to\nsomething following. But when we come to consider in any particular case\nwhat constitutes the proof that one event is the cause of another, we\ndepend, it seems to me, exclusively on the frequency with which the events\nhave been observed to coincide with one another\u2014that is, on experience.\nHaving observed a number of coincidences and holding the general principle\nof causation, we make the hypothesis that one event is the cause of\nthe other ; and the hypothesis having been tested by varying the con\nditions under which the so-called \"effects\" may be observed, \u2014that is,\nby trying what variety of precedent events coincide with the \"effects,\"\u2014\n(Continued on p. 212.)\n\f210 1898.\nJourna [Mar.,\n\u00a3 of Society f ychical Research.\nor Ps\ntPWOOO OiOOOOONOCOMH N CD\nr\u2014\n'UrH i-(\nCOOCiHlO <DOOSOOI>lO<Dtfi\u00ab0 o\ni-t M i-t HHH rH\nC5\n\u25a0 XO1O00 i-l\n00\nCtlCN\u00a9\ntH\n-H rH\nt-rH tP lO^H i-t CON tf CO\nO tH \"\nrH\nCO\nfe3\n\u2022d\neD\u00a9-*\u00a9\u00ab0\u00abD \u00a9\n:t~=3 :+i : : . --S. . - .\n5i\nt-\u00a9 t-W*J\"* \u00a9\n)t.,\n189\n&c.\n(1897)\ngham-s ranch\na\nP\nw rH rH i-t iH rH\n22\n2 2\n2\nQl rH <Nr-\nW\no O T\"\"' 5V2.S P3 \u00ab\n^ : M .\nmm : mos.\nto\nS ascription\nhaelm2,\n'.\n,\n19,\nBuck\nionery\nAmerica,\nq\nco\no\nMM '\n2usr xetary\n.'\"Sri\n-to\nCO\nR8*\u201e\n\u00a9J3 :\n\u00bb :\nxe^i 81\n\u201e\nPrintings-\nProceedings,\nPart\nX\nJournal,\nNos.\n)32\u20141\nTitle\nPage,\nIndex\n(l'r \u201e\n\u201e\n(Jouru\nGeneral\n\u201e\nCov2s\nand\nBinding\n\u201e\nEarly\nNos.\nof\nJournal\n,,\nGeneral\nMeetings\n,,\nAdvertising\n,,\nSalary\nto\nSecstary\n(1and\nCommission\non\n\u00a3 \u201e\nRent\n(2\nmonths\nto\nM \u201e\nHousekeeper\n(2\nmont ,,\nReading\nRoom\nand\nSt \u201e\nSecond\nSight\nInquiry ,,\nStorage\nof\nProceeding;\n,,\nPostage\n(Secstary's)\n\u201e\n\u201e\n(Publications ,,\nRepairs\nand\nFurnishii\n,,\nGeneral\nExpenses\n,,\nBalance\nin\nhands\nof\n1\nII\n\u00bb\u00bb\nII\n\u00b0\no 1\n31.\u2014\nBy\nLit2ary\nWork\n,,\nEditorial\nWork\n\u201e\nLibrary\nCommittee\n\u201e\nHypnotic\n,,\nG2...\nm\nw 1\nw\no\nFN\no\n1\u20141 o\nw\no e^\n^S\nPi\nft?\n.* oo\u00a9 \u00a9, ^\u00bb CO\nT3 tH\no\n03\n1\n03\niO *oo t^oo\ntH\no\no\n\u00ab o\nrHCNlo\n00 \"O\ntr\nCOOS\nrH\ni-t\nCO\no o \u00a9 He \u00a9 m\nH o\ni-ir^t rH\nm \u00ab oo to C5CC \u00a9 CO\ni\u2014i ^\n^\n03 J\nrH rH\n.*o rH OT\ntPt^ 00 CM 4*\no C+J OrH oo 2\nm (1896)\n26\n5\n2 Paul,\nTsnch,\n&\nCo.\n(July\n1896,\n,\n1897)'(1897)\nAmerican\nBranch s\nto\nMembers\nof\nan\nBranch\n(July\n1,\nJuno\n32,\n1897)...\nAm2ica\n(July\n1,\n.\nJune\n32,\n1897)\n...\nestment\nand\nDepc\n(1897)\n264\n2\n2 (1898)\n8\n8\n2 (1897)\n439\n19\n2 (1898)\n33\n12\n2\nb (1896)\n8\n8\n2\nm\nW\nEm\n.si\n\u00a9\n\u00a3\ns.\nd.\nEH\n1\nr-\u00ab\nO\n$\n.P-sCQ\nW-l\nO\nca ee .\nh Si\na\n3\nJ3\n1\na :\no\nlications\n:\n\u2014\nto\nJune Secstarj\nSec.\nof.\nSupplieAmeric; 1896,\nto ,\nSales\nin 1896,\nto sst\non\nInv\n.s CO u\na 9\n0> \"5 er\nKeganTriibner\no-S - -\n38 \" '\n<fi\n1.\nM\n5 * *\nC3\n1 3.2\n^ o .\"a o a a\nkq\no\nEh 02 \u25baHrHrU *\nSI\n| \u00bb n o n \u00ab. .t \u00ab \u201e . * * * \u00a3 r\nrH\n\u25a0\n1\n\"\no s \\\np rH\nCO\nr2 . t-^ d\n\u25ban wen \u00ab\nPfcS P\n\fI\nhave\nexamined\nthe\nBooks\nof\nAccount\nof\nthe\nSociety,\nand\nhaving\ncompasd\nthem\nwith\nthe\nabove\nStatement,\ncertify\nthem\nto be\nin\naccordance\nheswith.\nThe\nTsasusr's\ncertificate\n2\nto\nthe\ncheques\nin\nhis\nhands\nand\nuncollected,\ntogether\nwith\nthe\nBalance\nat\nthe\nBank,\nas\nshown\nby\nthe\npass-book,\nagrees\nwith\nthe\nabove\nStatement.\nI\nhave\nseen\nvouchers\nfor\npayments\nand\nthe\nCertificate\nof\nthe\nEast\nIndian\nRailway\nIrredeemable\nStock,\nrepresenting\nthe\nInvested\nFunds\nof\nthe\nSociety.\nARTHUR\nMIALL,\nF.C.A.,\nAuditor.\n23,\nSt.\nSwithin's\nLane,\nE.C.\nJamiary\n28th,\n1898.\nEDMUND\nGURNEY\nLIBRARY\nFUND.\nAccount\nfor\n1897.\nRECEIVED.\nBalance\nfrom\n1896\nInterest\non\nConsols\nInterest\non\nMid.\nUruguay\nRailway\nInterest\non\nBuenos\nAires\nWater\nand\nDrainage\nd. 2 4 8\n2\n2 2\ns. 3 18\n2 18\n\u00a3 15 2 4 5\ns\nPAID.\n\u00a3\ns.\nd.\nPurchase\nof\n\u00a323\nlis.\n2d.\nin\nTwo-and-a-Half\nPer\nCent\nConsols\ns\n2\n2\nBalance\ncarried\nforward\n2\n18\n2\ns\n18\n2\nFebruary\n3rd,\n1898.\nAudited\nand\nfound\ncorrect,\nand\nfour\nsecurities\nproduced\nthis\nday,\nH.\nArthur\nSmith.\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, [mab., 1898.\n(Continued from p. 209.)\nbecomes formulated as a law. We suppose that the law holds in all similar\noases, because we assume the uniformity of nature, \u2014an assumption which\ncannot possibly be derived from anything but experience. We then deduce\nparticular inferences from the law, as was done in the discovery of Neptune ;\nand the inferences thus depend\u2014not immediately, but ultimately\u2014on\nexperience, or the observation of coincidences.\nFurther, in any particular case, the coincidences, if not directly observed,\nare known or assumed. Neptune had existed long before it was observed,\nand the whole of its existence had probably coincided with the perturbations\nof Uranus ;\u2014this, at least, was certainly assumed when its influence on\nUranus was inferred.\nDr. Hebert speaks of the necessity of understanding the mode of action\nof a cause. To me it seems that all we can do towards understanding it\nis to find that more than two events are in experience constantly linked\ntogether. The greater the number of events, the greater is the sense of\nintellectual satisfaction that we associate with the knowledge of their\nlinkage, and with the practical advantage that when we see the first, we are\nable to predict\u2014again assuming the uniformity of nature\u2014that the rest will\nfollow. What Dr. Hebert says of the benefit of being able to draw such\ninferences is, of course, very true. Only it appears to me that they rest for\ntheir validity ultimately on experience and observation, rather than on ' ' the\nknowledge of the mode of action of a cause.\"\nFinally, Dr. Hebert objects to my saying that the question whether\nchance coincidence will account for incidents suggestive of telepathy is not\none that can be decided by an appeal to common sense ; he says we can ill\nafford to dispense with common sense. It never occurred to me that my\nwords could be taken to mean that I recommended dispensing with it, nor\ndo I think that they admit of that interpretation. If the statement were\nmade that the area of a circle could not be determined by common sense, it\nwould be understood to mean that common sense alone, without a knowledge\nof the appropriate mathematical method, would be inadequate to the task, \u2014\nnot that common sense should be thrown to the winds in carrying it out.\nNot only would common sense be indispensable in applying the mathematical\nmethod, but it would no doubt lead any one who wished to determine the\narea of a circle to use a recognised and tested method of doing so\u2014unless\nhe had previously discovered that the method was fallacious\u2014instead of\nignoring the results already obtained and trying to solve the problem over\nagain from the beginning.\nSimilarly it seems to me that the most reasonable way of testing whether\nso-called telepathy can be attributed to chance coincidence is to apply the\ntheory of probability to a large number of cases,\u2014not of the type that\nDr. Hebert has beeu criticising, but of types that cannot be accounted for\non any of the \"natural grounds\" he has described. Of such types,\nnumerous examples are, in my view, to be found in the publications of the\nS.P.R. \u2014I am. Sir, yours faithfully,\nAlice Johnson.\n\fNo. CXLVIII.\u2014Vol. VIII.

[Apr., 1898.\nThe Council recorded with regret the death of Miss Frances E.\nWillard, the well-known Temperance Reformer, who was an Associate\nof the Society.\nIn accordance with their request the names of Mr. Donald\nMurray and Dr. W. Wynn Westcott were transferred from the list\nof Associates to that of Members ; and the name of Mr. J. T. Dodge,\nof the American Branch, was transferred from the list of Members to\nthat of Associates.\nSeveral presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was accorded to the donors.\nThe House and Finance Committee presented a Report to which\nwas appended an estimate of Receipts and Expenditure for the current\nyear. The Report was adopted.\nThe confirmation of the existing lists of Corresponding Members\nand of Honorary Associates was agreed to, with the addition of the\nname of Professor F. W. Haslam, of Canterbury College, Christchurch,\nNew Zealand, as an Honorary Associate.\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Council should be on\nFriday, April 22nd, at the Westminster Town Hall, at 3 p.m., previous\nto the General Meeting at 4 o'clock on that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 91st General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, March 11th, at 8.30 p.m.; Professor\nHenry Sidgwick in the chair.\nMr. Frank Podmore opened the discussion on \" The Trance\nPhenomena manifested through Mrs. Piper.\"\nMr. Podmore prefaced his remarks by stating that he did not\npropose to follow Dr. Hodgson in his speculations as to the ultimate\nsignificance of Mrs. Piper's trance-utterances. No reflection, however,\nwas intended on the legitimacy of those speculations. There was,\nhowever, a prior question to be asked ; a question which Dr. Hodgson\nhad, indeed, answered to his own satisfaction,\u2014whether, namely,\nthe results indicated supernormal faculty of any kind, or whether they\nmight be attributed entirely to fraud. In considering this question,\nit was important to remember that Mrs. Piper was not an isolated\nphenomenon ; but a member of a large class\u2014clairvoyant mediums\u2014\nwhich had been under observation for more than a century. The\n\fApr., 1898.] General Meeting. 215\nchief reasons why Mrs. Piper's revelations were thought more worthy\nof consideration than those of any of her predecessors were : the\ngeneral high level of success ; the fulness of the record ; and the\nwatchful supervision exercised over her for some years past.\nThe abundance of the material and the fulness of the record\njustified us practically in leaving altogether out of account two sources\nof error which detracted from the value of all previous accounts of\nthe kind. It was tolerably clear that Mrs. Piper's success could not, to\nany serious extent, be attributed to misrepresentation and exaggeration\nas to what was actually said at the sitting ; nor to information\nextracted by \" fishing \" from the sitters themselves. Such \" fishing,\"\nindeed, as Dr. Leaf amongst others had pointed out, might reasonably\nhave been suspected to operate in the sittings given in this country\nnine years ago ; but it was clearly inadequate now to account for even\na small proportion of the success attained. Our choice, therefore, was\nclearly defined between deliberate and systematic fraud on the one\nhand, and supernormal faculty on the other.\nAs regards fraud, it was pointed out at previous meetings that\nMrs. Piper had been paid in recent years lOdols. a sitting; her total\nreceipts from this source probably averaged during the last five years\nnot more than \u00a3200 a year. The mere fact that Mrs. Piper was paid\nin no way affected the precautions taken. Those precautions were not\nincreased because she was paid ; nor would they have been relaxed if\nshe had given her services for nothing. The position of the Society\nin such investigations had always been that, while no dishonesty was\nnecessarily imputed to the medium, every possible precaution should\nbe taken on the assumption of dishonesty. But the fact that Mrs.\nPiper received payment at the rate of about \u00a3200 was of some impor\ntance, because fraud of the kind here supposed,\u2014the employment of\nprivate inquiry agents, \u2014would have necessarily involved considerable\nexpenditure.\nBefore considering in detail the possibilities of this kind of fraud,\nthere were three preliminary arguments against dishonesty to be\nstated : (1) that Mrs. Piper produced on nearly all those who came in\ncontact with her, \u2014 even those who were predisposed to believe her an\nimpostor, \u2014the impression of transparent honesty; (2) by an almost\nuniversal consensus of opinion her trance was a genuine one, and the\nassociation of preconcerted fraud of the kind with a genuine trance-\ncondition had never yet, the speaker thought, been demonstrated ;\n(3) in all the years during which she had been under the close observa\ntion of Professor W. James, Dr. Hodgson, Dr. Leaf, Professor Lodge,\nMr. Myers, and other competent persons\u2014though she had been\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1898.\nshadowed by detectives, her boxes searched, her going out and coming\nin closely watched \u2014 during all these ten or twelve years not the\nslightest circumstance had come to light reflecting in any way on her\nhonesty, there had not been so much as the rumour of an exposure.\nHow much weight should be attached to these three considerations,\nMr. Podmore was unable to say, but they clearly had some bearing\nupon the question.\nMr. Podmore then read the records of a small group of sittings, \u2014\nthose given to six Professors at Harvard,\u2014reported on pp. 524-6,\n528-9, and 534-5 of Appendix III. The group was by far below the\naverage as regards success ; it was selected as being a group composed\nof well-known men, whose names would carry weight, and who were\nnot predisposed in the medium's favour.\nThe hypothesis that the information given at the sittings had been\nworked up beforehand by means of private and systematic inquiries\nwas then considered in detail. The initial difficulty in such hypothesis\nwas that it was the rule to introduce sitters by assumed names. We\nhad to suppose first, then, that Mrs. Piper was able to ascertain\nbeforehand who were coming, and the exact date of their sittings.\nThe arrangement of sittings (except for those conducted by Professor\nJames and Dr. Thaw, where the same precautions were observed) were\nmade by letter or verbally by Dr. Hodgson. The correspondence and\ndiary of engagements were kept in a locked desk at Dr. Hodgson's\noffice. No doubt if Dr. Hodgson's assistant or shorthand-writers (of\nwhom three were employed at different times during the period in\nquestion) had been bribed, the information could have been obtained.\nBut it would not have helped much ; the notice was sometimes only a\nfew days ; the sittings were sometimes changed ; and in at least one\ncase (p. 527) the sitting was fixed at two or three days' notice only.\nMoreover, the sitters came from all parts of the United States, and in\none or two instances from abroad.\nThat Mrs. Piper should have worked up the dossiers of all the\nsitters some time before was practically impossible. No doubt it was\npermissible to assume a freemasonry amongst professional mediums,\nand that any information obtained by one of the fraternity would be at\nthe disposal of all. But a considerable proportion of Mrs. Piper's\nsitters were not even numbered amongst the 500 odd Members and\nAssociates of the A.B.S.P.R. ; and very few had ever been to a\nprofessional medium before. It seemed clear, then, that in most cases\nMrs. Piper's own agents must have obtained the information, and must\nhave obtained it in the short interval between the first letter to Dr.\nHodgson and the date of the sitting.\n\fAph., 1898.] General Meeting. 217\nSuppose then, the speaker said, that Mrs. Piper's agent, armed\nwith the name and address, had gone on the quest of information\nabout an intending sitter. He would find no difficulty in ascertaining\nsuch bare external facts as the locality of the house, nature of business,\nsocial standing, etc. In the role of a book-canvasser, say, he could have\nobtained entrance to the house, would thus be competent to furnish\naccurate descriptions of the living rooms and the servants' quarters ; by\nchatting with a sympathetic nursemaid he could have learnt more per\nsonal details\u2014names, ages, appearances, dispositions, etc., of children,\nnear relatives, or intimate friends of the house ; and recent accidents,\nillness, or death amongst them. By the more hazardous process of\nbribing servants to read letters and open desks, etc., he could in some\ncases, no doubt, have obtained more intimate details of family\ntroubles, distant friends, relatives dead years ago. But it is clear that\nthe further he pushed his inquiries by such methods\u2014even did time\npermit\u2014the greater the risk (on the average of cases, the certainty)\nof detection ; moreover such proceedings would have been costly, and\nthe results very uncertain.\nTurning to the other side of the question, the speaker pointed out\nthat the information given at the sittings in no way corresponded to\nthe supposition here made. The mere external details of house, living\nrooms, etc., were hardly ever given at a sitting. Mrs. Piper's trance\ninformation was almost exclusively concerned with personal matters ;\nand largely with the personal affairs of the dead ; there was much\nintimate matter about the living friends, or the recently dead ; much\nalso about long past family histories, far distant friends, and those\ndead long ago. By a fortunate chance the hypothetical inquiry\nagent might have gained information in a few cases on such matters,\nbut it seemed incredible that he should have been able to do\nso again and again with such conspicuous success. Nor did the\ncharacter of the failures suggest the reading out of dossiers of this\nkind. There were, indeed, plenty of irrelevancies and incoherences,\nbut not such as to suggest mistakes of identity or misapplication of\ndossiers.\nIn conclusion, the speaker suggested that at the present stage\nof the investigation the charge of credulity rested with those\nwho, without consideration and without inquiry, could lightly attri\nbute the whole results to imposture. For himself he found it\nalmost as easy to believe that Dr. Hodgson had himself engineered\nthe whole fraud.\nDr. Wyld, after referring to Mr. Podmore as a typical sceptic, said\nthat mere telepathy was a poor result to show for fifteen years' work.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apb., 1898.\nIt was a small outcome of so much expenditure of labour and money\nby the Society, if the best conclusion they could come to was that\nMrs. Piper was not a fraud. The Society should be called Psychical\nDetectives, not Researchers. The assumption by sitters that a medium\nwas fraudulent often made him so. Dr Wyld made some further\nremarks about the \"finer vibrations\" possibly involved in clair\nvoyance, etc., and proceeded to predict that the prominent members\nof the Society would eventually be forced to believe in \"slate-writing,\"\nin \" materialisation,\" and finally in \" Husk's ring.\"\nThe Chairman said that he had been reluctant to interrupt the\nflow of Dr. Wyld's reminiscences and predictions ; but he would ven\nture to express the hope that subsequent speakers would keep some\nwhat nearer the subject under discussion. With regard to this, he\npointed out that Dr. Hodgson had directed his argument in the\nProceedings particularly to the question whether the phenomena\nmanifested through Mrs. Piper's trance indicated extra-human intelli\ngence. Mr. Podmore had laid before them the possibilities that could\nbe supposed on the hypothesis of fraud, and this had also been some\nwhat fully dealt with in previous reports ; he would suggest therefore\nthat this aspect of the case had, perhaps, been considered sufficiently,\nand that attention might be now turned to the question, on the\nsupposition that the phenomena were of some supernormal character,\nwhether they were explicable by telepathy from the living, or had any\nso-called \" spiritistic \" origin.\nAnother speaker remarked that in his experience with fraud on\nthe part of the subliminal consciousness, it always seemed to be easily\ndiscoverable. Where the subliminal consciousness reproduced informa\ntion which it had attained by normal ways from the persons present\nfor example, these ways seemed to be always very obvious, and the\ndeception was very easily seen through.\nMr. Lanb Fox said that it must be remembered that Mrs. Piper,\nlike everybody else, had normal means of getting information, and\nthat the knowledge obtained normally may often be mixed up with\nknowledge supernormally obtained. We could not, indeed, make a\nhard and fast line between normal and supernormal. Similarly, when\nwe came to deal with the phenomena that seemed unquestionably to\nbe supernormal, we could not say, for instance, that they were due\nonly to Telepathy, or only to Clairvoyance, or only to Spirits. Such\nphrases might be only expressive of different aspects. The term\n\" spirits \" he thought was rather incongruous, and, as generally\nemployed, seemed to involve something that could move about from one\npart of space to another, and that was at the same time permanent.\n\fApb., 1898.] General Meeting. 219\nMany of those who spoke of \" spirits \" seemed to believe that the\nindividual consciousness was a separate entity, apart from and indepen\ndent of the experiences with which the consciousness is associated,\nwhich indicated a sad confusion of thought.\nMr. Neate said that the important question was whether the\nphenomena could be accounted for by telepathy from the living. He\nhad not yet had time to read the Report, and he inquired whether\nthere was any specific information given that was clearly beyond the\nknowledge of the sitters.\nAnother speaker suggested that it would be interesting to know\nwhat views were held on the subject by the Members of the Council\nof the Society.\nMb. Myers said that he, as one Member of the Council, regarded\nthe hypothesis of fraud as absolutely inadequate. He spoke of Mrs.\nPiper's sittings in England and the care taken about the introduction\nof sitters as strangers, and said that he had been allowed to read all\nMrs. Piper's letters, that her whole day was under observation, and\nthat he was perfectly satisfied that she made no attempt to obtain\nknowledge of sitters by any normal means. Further, even if she had\nthe services of confederates, and bribed servants, etc., to give her\ninformation, only a small portion of her phenomena could be accounted\nfor in this way. Some of the sitters, for instance, were casual visitors\nto Cambridge, or persons not known to his own servants, and brought\nstraight into Mrs. Piper's presence. No previous inquiries could have\nobtained the information which was given. As to the theory to be\napplied, he said that there was one special line of argument which\nhad been suggested in Dr. Hodgson's report that called for special\nconsideration, and it seemed to him to be a strong one. This argu\nment was that the distribution of successes and failures at the sittings\nwas concordant with the view that the communications emanated from\nthe \" spirits of the dead,\" rather than with the view that they were\ndue to the minds of the living.\nProfessor Sidgwick said that he rose in response to the wish that\nhad been expressed to learn the opinions of Members of the Council ;\nalthough, as he had not yet been able to give much time to the\nstudy of Part XXXIII., he wished his conclusions to be regarded as\nprovisional. Dr. Hodgson's able and careful report marked, he\nthought, a crisis in the history of our investigations. The general\ncourse of those investigations had tended to produce in his own mind,\nand he believed in Dr. Hodgson's also, two main conclusions:\u2014(1) a\npositive conclusion in favour of telepathy ; (2) a negative conclusion\nas regards the \" physical phenomena \" attributed to \" spirits,\"\u2014at any\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apr., 1898.\nrate the \" physical phenomena \" of professional mediums, who one\nafter another had been detected in fraud. He thought, however, that\nit would be unfair to extend this negative conclusion to the \" intellec\ntual \" phenomena exhibited by Mrs. Piper. The important question\nconcerning these, in his view, was as to the nature and source of the\nsupernormal knowledge which in some cases the medium undoubtedly\nseemed to possess. Previous reports on Mrs. Piper's phenomena had\nled him to think that they were for the most part easily explicable by\nthought-transference ; but Dr. Hodgson had now expressed himself as\nfavouring the hypothesis of \" spirits.\" He (Professor Sidgwick) was\nwilling to admit that,\u2014granting the phenomena in question to be\nsupernormal,\u2014some of the evidence produced was of a kind which, if\nmuch increased in quantity,\u2014so as to be capable (as Dr. Hodgson had\nsuggested) of statistical treatment,\u2014and obtained under adequately\nvaried conditions, would certainly point to the adoption of some form\nof \" spiritism\" as a working hypothesis. But in the present condition\nof the evidence, he could not say more than that a prima facie case\nhad been established for further investigation, keeping this hypothesis\nin view. It was not merely that the evidence from Mrs. Piper alone\nformed too narrow a basis for so large an assumption, and that we\nmust have other similar cases,\u2014but that there were certain deficiencies\nwhich Dr. Hodgson seemed to him to have overlooked or treated too\nlightly. It must be remembered that our previous experiences of Mrs.\nPiper, while they had given no ground for regarding her as fraudulent\nin her normal state, had led us to take an unfavourable view of the\nmoral tone of her secondary personality. As Dr. Leaf had said in\nhis report in 1890, we found \"Phinuit\" continually attempting to\ndeceive, \" fishing \" to extract information from the sitters, ready with\nambiguities or subterfuges to conceal his ignorance. And the present\nReport did not seem to show any material change in Phinuit's morale.\nHe found the same preference of Christian names for surnames, the\nsame generosity in giving the sitter a choice of various names, the\nsame readiness to accept suggestions, and to modify his statements\naccordingly. And he thought that the new \" communicator,\" G. P.,\nshowed somewhat of the same characteristics ; he resembled Phinuit in\ndesiring to appear to know more than he does know ; for instance, in\nhis discourses on philosophy, it was sometimes apparent that he had\nnot even an elementary grasp of the subject he was professing to\ndiscuss intelligently. Professor Sidgwick referred to two or three\npassages from the accounts of sittings in illustration.\nDr. Hodgson said that there was not much demanding a special\nreply from him. He reminded the members that many of the\n\fApr., 1808.] General Meeting. 221\n.sittings were not arranged for by himself at all, and that in the case\nof sittings arranged for in New York, Mr. Podmore's supposition of\nconfederacy would have to be extended far beyond his own assistants\nin Boston, if knowledge of the names of sitters was to be obtained.\nAnd even after the supposition of confederacy had been pushed to the\nfurthest possible limits, including confederates in other parts of the\nworld, there was a large amount of private information, including\nanswers to specific test questions, etc., given at the sittings, which\ncould not, he thought, be accounted for by any process of working up\nknowledge beforehand by normal means. Mr. Podmore's view was,\nperhaps, different from what many of the members had expected,\nsince it was clear that Mr. Podmore was quite satisfied that the\nhypothesis of fraud was inadequate, and his speech would remind\nthem of the prophet of old who \" came to curse but remained to\nbless.\" Dr. Hodgson agreed with what Professor Sidgwick had said\n-on several points, especially concerning the frauds of professional\nmediums for \" physical phenomena.\" Concerning Phinuit's weak\nnesses, various \" communicators \" through Mrs. Piper's trance had\nthemselves referred to these, and the contrast between them and\nPhinuit he thought furnished an additional argument in favour of\ntheir independent existence. Concerning the statements by G. P., he\npointed out that the conditions of communication must be kept before\nthe mind, and that if Professor Sidgwick were compelled to discourse\nphilosophy through Mrs. Piper's organism, the result would be a very\ndifferent thing from his lectures at Cambridge. Concerning Mr. Lane\nFox's remarks about \" spirits,\" he said that there were two aspects of\nthe case which must be discriminated. We might regard a \" spirit \"\nas manifesting in one portion of the space of the physical world, and\nagain as manifesting elsewhere in that world, without supposing that\nthe \" spirit \" as such had a spatial existence or passed through space\nfrom one spot to another. On the other hand, it might be supposed\nthat the \"spirit\" had some such relation to an etherial body as the\nordinary human consciousness had to its fleshly organism ; and that\netherial body might be conceived as passing through space in the same\nsense that the fleshly organism passed through space. The first view\ndid not necessarily involve the second, but both views might be\nmaintained. Dr. Hodgson, in answer to the question put by Mr.\nNeate, referred to some instances quoted in his Report, and gave\nadditional illustrations to show that information was frequently\ngiven at the sittings which went beyond the knowledge possessed\nby the sitters.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I have requested\nMiss Angus to be so good as to make experiments with Iceland spar, and\nwill report results. A friend, well-known in letters, informs me that in his\ncase crystal pictures are the only objects of vision not affected by his\nspectacles, and he also draws my attention to a recent newspaper statement\nthat the pictures presented by mirage in the desert are made more dis\ntinct through a field-glass. My friend sees crystal pictures more vividly\nthan actual objects of vision. His experiments, as far as I am aware,\npresent no hint of telepathy. Observing, in his first attempt, the face\nof a friend in Australia, he turned the glass, when the face appeared in\nprofile.\nOn one occasion, when crystal-gazing in an historic scene, Miss Angus\ntold me that the figures seemed to be small and far away, deep in the glass.\nIn the case of the view of an accident on a race-course (in my paper), I\nunderstood from her that she seemed to be in the scene, and, on that\noccasion only, felt \"excited,\" owing to anxiety about the rider who\nwas hurt.\nSince my paper was written, a comparatively large number of people of\nboth sexes tried the glass ball with success. (1) Two ladies and one\ngentleman (whose telepathic scry has been recorded in the Journal) were\nparticularly interesting. All three saw pictures, and all three were sceptical,\nmaintaining that the pictures were constructed out of reflections and points de\nrepere. We tried this experiment, which I suggested on the spot, after we\nmet. The gentleman, Mr. R., scried in one corner of the room, one of the\nladies, Miss R. A., in the other ; they were facing each other, with their\nbacks to different walls. The gentleman then left the room with me, and\ntold me that he had seen a picture of an old lady in furs. We returned, and\nasked the lady what she had seen. She had seen an old lady writing letters.\nThe reflections in the glasses cannot have been the same in both cases, and\nno old lady was in the room. My friends remained sceptical, and held to\nthe theory of reflections. Perhaps I should add that I had been sceptical\nabout the \"ghostly\" experiences of the two young ladies; one of which\nhas appeared in the Society's Proceedings. Again, (2) I asked a friend, well-\nknown for the singular and valuable accuracy of his historical researches, to\n\fApr., 1808.] Correspondence. 223\nlook in the ball. In about five minutes he saw three faces, one of a girl in\na straw hat (full face), another face in profile, the third was of a smooth-\nshaven man, \u2014my friend wearing a beard. He tried to account for all three\nby reflections. I saw the reflections, but, of course, none of the faces. On\nmaking experiments later, my friend was unsuccessful, but he was, through\nout, consciously studying the reflections in the glass. He was wholly\nunacquainted with the topic of crystal-gazing. (3) Several people, not\nknown to myself, saw a great number of pictures in a glass lent to them by\na friend. Indeed, they were delighted with the vividness and variety of the\nscenes and moving figures, sometimes recognised, sometimes not. A map\nof America, scenes in Algeria, ships, relations at a distance, and so forth,\nwere presented. Nobody was successful in seeing pictures attributable to\nthought-transference, as the sceptical scryer mentioned in the first case (1)\nhas certainly done, much to his chagrin, his mind being adverse to the\n\"mystical.\"\nIt appears to me that some, at least, of these fancy pictures are seen just\nas pictures in the fire are seen. I can see no pictures in the fire, nor in the\nglass ball. The vividness and movement of the glass pictures, as when a\nlady is seen twirling her parasol on her shoulders (a familiar action with her,\nthough she was wholly unknown to the scryer) scarcely seem consistent with\nthe theory of points de repere. The same difficulty arises in the case of\nMiss Angus's now long series of pictures of scenes and persons necessarily\nunknown to her, but confirmed by letters from Egypt and India, written\nbefore the \" scries,\" and received after them. An account of some of these\nwill be added to my paper read to the Society.\nQuite apart from questions of telepathy, or clairvoyance, crystal-gazing\nseems to deserve the attention of psychologists, as illustrating the varieties\nof sub-conscious imagination.\nAmong the many persons among whom I have now found the faculty,\nthe general health, as an almost universal rule, was excellent. The men and\nwomen seemed robust and wholesome, and were of all sorts of ranks, ages,\nand occupations. In no single case have I seen or heard of any sign of\n\"dissociation,\" drowsiness, or incipient trance. Miss Angus's best experi\nments were conducted among friends who were, as one of them said,\n\" frivoling,\" and chaffing the experimenter. The arrival of a letter next day\nfrom an Indian native State, confirming the accuracy of Miss Angus's\nobservations, and of another from a distant place in this country, rather\naltered their attitude.\nA. Lang.\nSt. Andrews, March 8th.\n[Mr. Lang sends the following statement by Miss Angus. \u2014Ed.]\nIt is difficult to state exactly how pictures appear to me, when I look in\na crystal. After focussing my eye for some time on a particular spot of light\nin the ball, my mind becomes aware that it may expect to see a vision ; but,\nas far as I can judge, the moment the vision comes, the ball seems to\ndisappear, so it is difficult for me to say if my pictures are actually seen in\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1898.\nthe crystal, or only projected outside in the space between the eye and the\nball. It is only when I suddenly remember that it is a picture and try to\nexamine the detail more closely, so as to describe it to the anxious on\nlooker, that the ball, with all its tantalising reflections, at once comes back\nand the picture vanishes, very often refusing to return.\nMy pictures are not in any way stationary, in fact they are mere\nlightning glimpses, and to me the most wonderful fact is, that in such a\nmomentary flash, a whole scene, often with minute detail, can leave such a\nvivid impression in my mind.\nSometimes, after I have put the crystal down, I seem to remember\nanother point in the picture, that I had not at the moment taken any notice\nof, but were I to state these details an hour or two afterwards, I fear I\nwould spoil my own case and be accused of more imagination than I have\nbeen gifted with !\nWhile I am describing the vision, it may not still be there, although I\nkeep my eye focussed ; but I find that another picture, which sometimes I\ncan at once recognise as bearing a relation to the first, flashes across the\nball, even although the first may not return.\nThe pictures are to me, for the moment, \" real scenes,\" the figures \"real\npeople,\" and that they appear small to me is only because they seem a long\nway off. I would certainly describe them as being represented life size.\nThe \"Spirit\" Hypothesis.\nTo the Editor of the Journal or the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir,\u2014The letter from Mr. St. George Lane Fox in the Journal for\nFebruary is both interesting and suggestive. Especially the parable of the\ntornado. It seems to me, however, that the same simile may, with great\nappropriateness, be carried further than has been done by Mr. Lane Fox,\nand that it may furnish a common ground for the \"spiritualist\" and\nhimself. Let us suppose the tornado originating, we know not how, in an\nelevated mountain region. It goes sweeping down towards the plains, then\ncrosses a sandy desert, then enters a region of forests and streams, where\nwe lose sight of it. It is the same tornado all the time. But, during its\npassage across the desert, it fills the air with clouds of sand, \u2014it becomes\nvisible as a sand storm. Arrived at the edge of the desert, it again drops\nthe \" muddy vesture of decay,\" and goes careering along over the hills and\nvales, woods and streams, of a beautiful and fertile land. It is the same\ntornado all the time.\nSo with the human tornado, \u2014that combination of force, power, intelli\ngence and life, which we call a man. It is not now the question where it\nconies from, or whether it comes at all, \" trailing clouds of glory.\" But the\nquestion is, what becomes of the human tornado, when it reaches the edge\nof the sandy desert\u2014the end of its earthly journey. The special interest of\ninvestigations such as those that have been made with Mrs. Piper consists\n\fApe., 1898.] Correspondence. 225\nin the aid they give towards a solution of the question, \u2014What becomes of\nthe human tornado at this point of its career '( Does it come to an end ? Or\ncan we trace its progress further into regions yet untrod ? Much of the\nrecent evidence tends to prove that it still exists, that it is the same tornado\nthat manifested itself here.\nMay we not therefore leave the question as to whether \" our bodies are\nanimated by an independent and detachable concrete entity, a sort of lump\nof spirit in human form, which flies out of the body at death,\" as a subsidiary\nmatter altogether. Whatever may be the real nature of our personality, the\nevidence is very strong that it survives the change we call death. Call us\ntornadoes, if you will, combinations of force and intelligence, starting we\nknow not how\u2014coming we know not whence ; but our mission as tornadoes,\nour independent existence, does not appear to be finished when we reach\nthe boundray of the earthly desert, and emerge from the blinding sand into\nthe clear sunshine beyond. \u2014Yours truly,\nEdward T. Bennett.\nMarch 15th, 1898.\nDear Sir, \u2014The letter of Mr. Schiller in the March Journal shows that\nhe has misunderstood my meaning ; I do not, as he supposes, deny the\npersistence of individuality after death. The object of my letter was an\nendeavour to clear away certain delusions in regard to individuality, which I\nbelieve to be widely prevalent, more especially among those who call them\nselves \" Spiritualists.\" I tried to show that the conception of individuality\nas a concrete \"spirit\" entity, permanent, isolated, and detachable, was a\nmistaken conception altogether, and that, as it had no existence at all, it\nwas nonsense to talk of it surviving the body ; from which it would\nnaturally follow that the contention as to whether or not it explained\nMrs. Piper's trance phenomena was quite futile.\nIndividuality, as I understand it, implies a connected sequence of\nexperiences, phenomenal or psychic, which experiences are interdependent\nand correlated, although extending over wide ranges of spirituality.\nThe mistake, I take it, is to assume that anything that can properly be\ncalled identity subsists as a moveable entity between one stage of individual\nexistence and another.\nI maintain that the idea of an unchangeable \"spirit\" occupying a definite\nposition in space is an incongruity resting on the old fallacy that a cause is\nidentical with its effect. Cause and effect is an expression of the law of\nphenomenal existence, including, of course, all mental states ; there need\nbe no resemblance between them, much less should they be regarded as\nidentical.\nIn conclusion, let me say that if certain people calling themselves\n\" Spiritualists \" deny that they believe in any such incongruity as I have\nindicated, I can only reply that it is a pity they should adopt the same\ndesignation as those whose phraseology suggests a belief in it. \u2014Yours\nfaithfully,\nSt. George Lane Fox.\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I was\naccompanied by Miss McKee, a Poor Law Guardian of South Marylebone.\nAs it was my first visit of inspection here, I first called on the Secretary\nof the Committee, Canon Wheeler, and asked him if he would like to see\nme inspect the children. He accepted my offer, and together we went to\nthe school, where some of the children were, it being in school hours.\nThere was no place there where we could see them conveniently, so Canon\nWheeler unlocked an empty cottage close by and took us in there, with the\nchildren. I found one boy, aged about nine, whom I will call X. Y., with\nhis hands literally covered with warts, and there were some even on his\narms and legs. They were so numerous, large, and prominent, that he\ncould not avoid knocking and making them bleed till they were actually\npainful. It was the worst case of warts I ever saw.\n\fApr., 1898.] Case. 227\nI was told that he was thus afflicted with them when first boarded out\nhere on 11th June, 1897, and that they had remained in the same condition\never since, i.e., a little over three months.\nI determined to try the experiment of a charm, and looked round for\nsome means of effecting it. There was nothing whatever in this empty\ncottage but one loose brick. So I went out, procured a leaf, and in the most\nimpressive manner I could, put it under the brick in the empty fireplace,\nshowing the boy what I did, and telling him that in three months' time he\nmust ask Canon Wheeler to take him back to the cottage to look if the leaf\nwas still under the brick, and he would find that his warts were gone.\nI have now received the following letter from Canon Wheeler :\u2014\nThe Rectory, Haselbury Bryan, Sturminster Newton, Dorset.\nDecember 30th, 1897.\nDear Miss Mason, \u2014I cannot help writing to tell you the result of your\ncharm for exorcising his warts from poor little X.

She used it in the forenoon of that day for coming into the house, and\nmissed it before she had occasion to go out again.

I looked myself for the key in every likely place,\nand in its absence thought my housekeeper's conclusion was probably the\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Apr., 1898.\nright one. Last night I read the account in Vol. XI. Proceedings S.P.R., of\nthe lady who lost a book which was afterwards found on \" the blue room\nbed.\" I said to myself \" I wish I could find that key. \" \"Where is it?\" I\nasked my subliminal self, and the good Anthony, the patron saint of the Lost\nProperty Office\u2014put these words into my head : \"It's in the kitchen table\ndrawer.\" At breakfast this morning my housekeeper said she had not slept\nall night from worrying about that latch key. I remarked that I had dreamt\nit was in the kitchen table drawer. \"Oh no, sir,\" she replied. \" I've looked\nthere and everywhere.\" I then went into the kitchen with her and opened\nthe table drawer\u2014and there found the key. My housekeeper was certainly\nas astonished as myself, and admitted that she hadn't looked in that\nparticular drawer for it as she had never put it there before. She supposes\nthat in the present instance the drawer must have been a little open when\nshe put her parcels on the table, and that the key at the same moment fell\nfrom her hand into it. \u2014Yours faithfully, T> FT W s v\nWe wrote to Mr. Wilson for additional information ; he replies as\nfollows :\u2014\n8, Jasper Road, S.E., January 23ni, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your inquiries about the lost latch key incident :\n1. I have never put the key in the kitchen table drawer.\n2. The key is practically for the use of the housekeeper. There is but\none latch key, and she keeps it. She is alone in the house all day, and\nrequires it to let herself in when she goes shopping. She goes to her home\nat night and takes the key with her. Very rarely I ask her to leave the key\nwith me when she is leaving. On Saturday last she missed the key when she\nwas on the point of going home at night. She at once told me of it. I said\n\" When did you have it last ?\" and she replied \" To let myself in at about\nmidday, and haven't been out since, and no one has been into the house.\" I\nsaid \" It must be in the house, have a good look for it to-morrow.\" The\nnext day she looked for it \"everywhere,\"\u2014excepting of course the right\nplace. She says she never puts it in any drawer. She usually puts it in her\npocket ; occasionally she puts it on the kitchen table or dresser whilst she is\ndisposing of her parcels. When she told me on Sunday that she couldn't\nfind the key, I went into the kitchen to look for it. I cast my eyes over the\ntwo dressers, on the hooks on them, and on nails in the walls, and on\nthe mats ; but I did not look into any drawer: It is very probable that the\nhousekeeper had rested the key on the table, intending to place it at once in\nher pocket. Forgetting it, she may have have later on swept it into the open\ndrawer. I had little doubt on Sunday night that the key had been left in\nthe door at midday on Saturday, and had been carried off by some tramp or\nmischievous boy, and so thought my housekeeper. \u2014Yours faithfully,\nD.

The next meeting will be on Friday,\nMay 20th, at 4.30 p.m., at the Rooms of the Society, 19, Buckingham\nStreet, W.C.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 92nd General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, April 22nd, at 4 p.m.; Colonel\nJ. Hartley in the chair.\nA paper by Miss Alice Johnson on \" Coincidences \" was read by\nDr. Hodgson.\nMiss Johnson discussed coincidences of kinds which would nob\nhave been expected beforehand, and which sometimes suggested a\nrelation of cause and effect between the two coinciding events ; this\nsuggestion, however, being often fallacious. In psychical research,\nthe question whether the coincidences which formed the main material\nfor study could be attributed to chance was a fundamental one. The\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1898.\nquestion had been extensively discussed, and definite reasons\u2014statis\ntical and other\u2014had been given for answering it in the negative as\nfar as some classes of the coincidences dealt with were concerned ; but\nin regard to the whole investigation, it still remained open.\nA number of odd coincidences had been put together by the\nauthor for comparison with those met with in psychical research, and\nshe attempted to consider whether they were due to some known cause\nwhich was not immediately obvious, and, if not, whether there was any\nreason to suppose that they were not the result of chance. In deciding\non this question, the degree of improbability of their occurrence was\nan important factor ; but in most cases only a very rough estimate of\nthe probability could be formed, and on general grounds alone. Cases\nhad been chosen for treatment chiefly on the ground of the apparent\nimprobability of their occurrence,\u2014the common-sense impression of\ntheir oddness. The improbability in at least one case where a\nnumerical estimate was possible was greatly in excess of the improba\nbility of any one of the coincidences met with in psychical research,\u2014\nso far as these could be estimated numerically. But the proof that\nthese psychical coincidences were beyond chance did not depend on\nthe degree of improbability of any one coincidence, but on the accumu\nlation of many coincidences of certain well-defined types ; and in\ndeciding whether other odd coincidences were accidental, we had to\nconsider whether they too fell into natural classes too numerous to be\naccounted for by chance.\nThe question was complicated by an inevitable uncertainty as to\nwhich coincidences were due to chance and which were not. All that\nthe theory of probability could prove was that out of a certain\nnumber of events, the most likely number of coincidences was so-and-\nso. If the actual number was largely in excess of this, it was\nprobable that something beyond chance had operated in the whole\ngroup of events taken together. But this proved nothing about any\nindividual coincidence. The very same reasoning that had led to the\nconclusion that the whole group of coincidences taken together was not\ndue to chance, involved the assumption that some of the coincidences\n\u2022were due to chance, and afforded no criterion by which these coinci\ndences could be distinguished from the others. In course of time,\nenough might be learnt about all the processes concerned to enable us\nto distinguish between casual coincidences and those which arose from\na known cause, and reasoned speculation based on psychical research\nhad, in fact, reached such a stage that we might often be more or less\nconvinced on rational grounds that a given coincidence belonged to\none or the other class. But in the present state of obscurity as to\n\fMay, 1898.] Correspondence. 231\nthe mode of action of psychical causes, the statistical argument was\nthe strongest one that could be brought to bear in proof of their\nreality.\nMr. Hayes said that the suggestive comments of the author of the\npaper concerning the action of the subliminal consciousness in one of\nthe cases quoted, reminded him of an incident which had occurred to\na friend, who sent him an account of it on the following day. This\nfriend had been playing whist the previous night, and was disturbed\nin the game by a child crying upstairs. The cards had just been\ndealt and the dealer was laying down the trump card. The friend\nthrust his cards in his pocket and went upstairs, and as he returned,\nit occurred to him that his subliminal consciousness might do good\nservice if it could arrange his cards for him, so that he might not keep\nthe other players waiting, especially as they had but little time left to\nfinish the game. When he took the cards out of his pocket he found\nthem arranged precisely as it was his custom to arrange his \" hand.\"\nMr. Hayes apparently suggested that his friend's subliminal conscious\nness may actually have been concerned in the arranging of the cards.\nMr. Podmore inquired whether it was not more reasonable to\nsuppose that in the incident mentioned by Mr. Hayes, the person\nconcerned had actually arranged his cards himself in the ordinary\nway, and forgotten that he had done so.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nCORRE SPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nMb. Lane Fox versus Spirit Identity.\nI am afraid Mr. Lane Fox's letter in the April Journal seems to me more\nunintelligible than his first. It does indeed appear from it that his objection\nto the ' spirit ' hypothesis is of an a priori metaphysical character, but beyond\nthat darkness and chaos reign. He studiously evades the main point a3 to\nwhether ' spirit ' phenomena j ustify us in attributing them to persons in tile\nsame sense as tve recognise the personality of our fellow men. Instead, he\ntalks about a ' persisting individuality after death, ' but admits no identity.\nIndividuality \"implies a connected sequence of experiences\" (aware of itself\nas such or not ?) ' ' phenomenal or psychic \" (are these exclusives ?), ' ' which are\ninterdependent and correlated,\" but not \"anything that can properly be\ncalled identity . . . between one stage of individual existence and\nanother.\" That is, state A causes another B, but there is no identity\nbetween A and B. Thus the ' persisting individuality ' is the fact that the\nworld goes on, but the father is not the son. Truly a profound and\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1898.\ninspiring dogma, the philosophic import of which I refrain from discussing.\nI will permit myself only one question, which it irresistibly suggest*,\nand that is\u2014 Has Mr. Lane Fox any personal identity? If he has, what does\nit consist in ? If he has not (and I suppose he ought not to have on his own\nth'eory) how does he hold himself together and prevent his successive states\nof consciousness ('stages of individual existence ') from getting lost, strayed,\nor stolen ? Perchance he keeps a big diary and traces in it the individuality\nof ' Mr. Lane Fox from day to day ;' but even so he must thank his Karma\nor his Mahatma every morning that he is still the man he was, and has not\nchanged into another person of the same name over night. But I must not\ntransgress the line which separates the sublime from the ridiculous, and must\nleave Mr. Lane Fox himself (if he has a self) to grapple with the practical\ndifficulty in which his theory involves him.\nF.

Schiller.\nMr. Schiller has clearly pointed out the fundamental confusions involved\nin the statements of Mr. Lane Fox, and I add a few words for the purpose\nof showing that the particular \"delusions in regard to individuality \" which\nMr. Lane Fox says that \" the object of his letter was an endeavour to clear\naway,\" appear to have been those in Mr. Lane Fox's own mind. He does\nnot, however, in this case, seem to have succeeded in his object. These\ndelusions were otherwise described by Mr. Lane Fox in his first letter\n(Journal for February, p. 184), as \"crudely materialistic notions concerning\nour spiritual existence,\" and he showed special umbrage at the terms\n\"spirit\" and \"spiritualist.\"\nAs regards the \" crudely materialistic notions,\" Mr. Lane Fox expressly\ncompared our \"individual existence\" with a tornado. The absurdity of\nthis crudely materialistic comparison was pointed out by Mr. Schiller in his\nletter in the Journal for March.\nAs regards the use of such words as \"spirit\" and \"spiritualist,\"\nMr. Lane Fox uses similar terms, since he speaks, in his letter in the\nJournal for February, of \"our spiritual existence,\" and in the Journal for\nApril his extraordinary description of \" individuality \" is as follows :\u2014\n\"Individuality, as I understand it, implies a connected sequence of ex\nperiences, phenomenal or psychic, which experiences are interdependent and\ncorrelated, although extending over wide ranges of spirituality.\"*\nIn Mr. Lane Fox's statements, then, we find a combination of \"crudely\nmaterialistic notions\" with the use of the terms \"spiritual\" and\n\"spirituality.\" This is the combination apparently which Mr. Lane Fox\nparticularly abhors. That he should suffer from these \"pernicious delu\nsions \" is perhaps not remarkable, but why his onslaught upon them ?\nProbably his lack of personal identity may explain this violent attack by\nMr. Lane Fox upon himself. I wonder which side he is on now, and whether\neither or neither is victorious.\nR. Hodgson.\n* How does this apply to sticks and stones ?\n\fMay, 1898.] Curious Knockings. 233\nExperiments in Thought-Transference.\nTo the Editor of the Journal op the Society for Psychical Research.\n3, Hare Court, Inner Temple, April 5th, 1898.\nSir, \u2014May I be permitted to suggest that, if the results of experiments\nin thought-transference are worth publishing at all, it is always worth\nwhile to publish the figures for the probable errors as well as for the most\nprobable number of successes. If these figures are not published, the\nreader has the trouble of working out the sums for himself.\nI should also like to suggest that the experiments should be conducted\nwith packs of cards consisting of two suits and only two numbers in each\nsuit. Many such packs can be constructed out of, say, one dozen packs of\nsimilar pattern. The advantage of using packs for which the chance of\nguessing correctly either the suit or the number is one half is that the\njirobability curves are then normal and not skew, and consequently the\ndeductions to be drawn from the results obtained are free from certain\ndifficulties of calculation.\nI think that it might be useful to collect together the results of all the\nsimilar experiments that have been recorded, and to see whether any infer\nences can be drawn from the total results.\nAnd lastly it might be worth while to investigate whether there is any\ncorrelation between success in guessing suits and success in guessing\nnumbers. My impression is that there appeared to be some such correlation\nin some results that I once looked at.\nI presume that in all the experiments the cards are replaced in the pack\nafter they have been guessed ; I have heard of experiments where this has\nnot been done, and the difficulty of calculating the probabilities is thereby\ngreatly increased. \u2014 Yours faithfully,\nCharles Percy Sanger.\nCURIOUS KNOCKINGS.\nThe following case of \" knockings \" has been reported by one of our\nAssociates, the Rev. E. R. Gardiner, M.A., Vicar of Long Wittenham,\nAbingdon. The obvious suggestion is of course that the knocks were\nmade by \" practical jokers,\" but apparently the witnesses are not\nsatisfied with any such explanation. Mr. Gardiner writes :\u2014\nLong Wittenham, Abingdon, January 13th, 1898.\nDear Sir, \u2014Enclosed is a cutting from the Abingdon Herald of January\n8th, of a letter I wrote to that paper.

Perhaps the matter might\ninterest some readers of the S.P.R.

I venture to ask whether you can suggest any explanation of\nthe phenomena. \u2014Yours faithfully,\nEdw. R. Gardiner,\nAssociate S.P.R.\nThe cutting referred to by Mr. Gardiner is as follows :\u2014\nA GHOST AT LONG WITTENHAM.\nThe following has been sent for publication :\u2014\nSir, \u2014Some rather curious occurrences, which may possibly interest some\nof your readers, took place in this parish on New Year's Eve. Let me give\nmy own experience in detail : After taking the usual midnight service in\nchurch I came in at quarter-past twelve. About five minutes afterwards, as\nI was sitting quietly smoking, with no one in the room but my dog, I was\nstartled by hearing some half-a-dozen distinct raps on the window pane.\nThe dog, who is always most sensitive to the presence of strangers, took no\nnotice. Of course, I ought at once to have gone out, but did not do so for\nreasons which need not be mentioned. Five minutes afterwards I went into\nanother room, and in a minute or two heard most distinct knocking on the\nwall close to the window. I looked out but saw nothing, though it was a\nfairly clear moonlight night. I immediately made a note of the occurrence\non paper and then went to bed. Nothing more happened, but next morning\nI was asked by a parishioner whether I had been disturbed in any way on\nthe previous night. I then detailed my experience, and on making further\nenquiries in the parish found that a a great many houses the same or similar\noccurrences had taken place. In many cases the poundings on the doors\nand walls were very loud and the inmates of the houses were woke up, and\nmany of them were for some time in a state of considerable alarm. Every\none appeared to agree about the time ; and not only was this village\ndisturbed, but at Appleford, an adjoining parish, the same thing took place\nat precisely the same hour. Our village policeman was patrolling the parish\nbetween 12 and 1, and informs me that if any practical joker was abroad\nat that time he must have been seen or heard. I have been a member\nof the Society for Psychical Research for some years and have had a\nlittle experience in their mysterious affairs, and though in nine cases\nout of ten they are easily explained, the tenth very often remains an\ninsoluble mystery. I should be glad if any of your readers could throw\nany light on the matter, and I would only request that such sugestions as\nrats, owls, kicking horses, branches of trees, etc., should not be made, as\nthat is only a polite way of calling a fellow creature an idiot. Those who\ndid not hear the sounds suggest that they were fog signals at Didcot ; those\nwho did, including myself, consider the suggestion quite absurd, and the\nexplanation totally inadequate. Fog signals have never, that I know of,\nproduced taps on a window pane ; why should they do so on the eve of the\nyear 1898 ?\u2014I am, Sir, yours faithfully,\nEdw. R. Gardiner,\nVicar of Long Wittenham.\n\fMay, 1898.] Carious Knockings. 235\nIn reply to inquiries, Mr. Gardiner writes :\u2014\nFebruary 12th, 1898.\nDear Sib, \u2014 ... I am fully convinced that the thing could not\nhave been caused by \" practical jokers,\" as it occurred at the same time at\nseveral villages some miles apart ; that it was a moonlight night, and that no\nfootsteps were heard by anyone, nor was anyone seen. I have interviewed a\ngreat many from whom I have not taken the trouble to procure signed state\nments, as the stories are all in substantial agreement. It occurred at several\noutlying cottages some distances from any road. . . .\nMr. Townsend, who signs one statement, has worked on the G.W.\nRailway for 30 years, and has had a good deal to do with fog signals, and\nscouts the idea of the noises having anything to do with them, as indeed\ndoes everyone who heard the sounds. I could get more signed statements if\nyou think it advisable, but they would be mere repetitions of the same\nthing. I vouch for the reliability of all the witnesses whose statements T\nenclose.\nEverybody agrees that, whatever the cause may be, practical joking is\nentirely out of the question.

At the end of this section farthest from the door was a window, the\nwhole of which she would be able to see and a portion of the wall, between\nthis window and another, occupied by a low bookcase about 4 ft. high\nresting on the floor ; in front of this bookcase she saw me standing.\nPresuming I was ready for breakfast she began to make the tea. She told\nmy brother that I had come in, but he ascertained that I was not there.\nAt the time of the occurrence I was asleep in a house about 60 yards\nfrom the spot in question. The distance between the spot where Mary\nHollard was standing and the bookcase above mentioned is about 10 paces.\nThe girl is a servant in the employ of my brother, a doctor at the above\naddress ; she is quite intelligent, of average eyesight, not myopic, and not\nhysterical.\nOn January 1st, 1898, at 10.15 p.m., the same girl was dusting an oak\nchest in the hall. Turning her head to the left she saw me at the low gate in\nfront of the main house door. She noticed me stop to open the gate, and she\nalso noticed that I was without my hat. I appeared to come through or\npartly through the gate, hesitate and turn back, as if I had forgotten some\nthing. She, never doubting that I was about to come in, went to the kitchen\nto prepare my breakfast. At the time of this occurrence I was again asleep\nat the same place as in the last case.\nLater on I came in, walking from the house where I had slept, without my\nhat. When I came to the gate I noticed that, owing to a man working at a\nplot of ground just inside, a piece of wire fencing lay across and blocked the\ngate, so I passed by and came in by a door through the stable opening into\nthe garden. I cannot recollect whether I stooped to open the gate or no,\nbut I do remember that I did not notice the obstruction until I was close to\nthe gate, and that my intention was to come in by this, the usual, way, and\nI might have had my hand on the gate before I saw that I could not ; in\nfact, as I am writing, the remembrance comes to me that I did think of\nstepping over both gate and fence.\nExactly the same thing occurred to me the morning before, December\n31st. I was then without a hat, and the gate was similarly obstructed, and I\ncame in by the stable door.\nThe distance between the oak chest where the girl was standing, and\nfrom which she would be able to see about half the gate in question, was\nsix paces.\nOn this occasion, so convinced was she that I was about to come in to\nbreakfast, that, finding I did not come, she related the whole occurrence to\nthe cook, her fellow servant, and also to my brother.\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [May, 1898.\nWhen later I actually did come in she made her witness of the last in\norder that she might be convinced of the reality of my presence. I may\nmention that I have both beard and whiskers, being in this respect different\nfrom both my brother and others who might possibly have been about, so\nthat it would be difficult to make an error in recognition.\nThe girl has had no other occurrence of like nature before.\nStatement of the Percipient.\nJanuary 1st, 1898.\nI testify that the above statement is a true description of what I saw and\ndid on the mornings of December 31st, 1897, and January 1st, 1898.\n(Signed) Mary Hollard.\nStatement of the Cook.\nJanuary 1st, 1898.\nI beg to certify that the above statement which has been read to me is\ntrue as far as it relates to me.\n(Signed) Ellen Harvey.\nIn reply to inquiries, Mr. Hildyard writes :\u2014\nJanuary 6th, 1898.\nDear Dr. Hodoson, \u2014I am in receipt of your note of the 4th inst. Owing\nto several cases of illness cropping up, my brother was prevented from coming\nto town as he intended, and from the same cause he has his hands very full\nof work, but I will endeavour to get the statement you desire.\nI have questioned Mary Hollard to ascertain if she has experienced any\nthing of unusual character before, and I find that she has had no experience\nof similar character. She had one experience two years ago which may, or\nmay not, have had an objective basis. At about 10 p.m. in the month of\nFebruary or March she was walking on a country road towards the village of\nKingsdon where she lives. She was within 30 yards of her home and had\njust parted from her brother-in-law, who had accompanied her so far. He had\nturned back and must have been 20 yards away when a dark shape resembling\na dog, only much larger (about the size of a colt), passed her, coming from\nthe direction towards which she was going. The shape passed silently, and\nthe road being without lamps she could only see it imperfectly. She was very\nfrightened and ran home screaming. Her father heard her and came to meet\nher ; her brother-in-law neither heard or saw anything and did not, so she\ntells me, hear her screaming.\nI give this story for what it worth, but I do not attach any importance to\nit and I think it is very probable that the shape was actually some animal\nwhich passed her and turned down a side road that was close by.\nRegarding your second question as to whether my simulacrum has been\nseen before, I remember that on more than one occasion I have been told by\nmy friends that they have seen me in places where I was not, but the\naccounts not being circumstantial I have attached no importance to what I\nput down as mistaken recognition.

Some time between ten and half-past, I was passing the door\nof the pantry and saw Mary Hollard taking the teapot from the dining-room,\nin order to make fresh tea. She spoke to me, saying, \" Mr. Fred is here\nthis morning, sir ; I have just seen him.\" I said, \"I don't believe it,\" as I\nthought I should have heard him coming in, and, subsequently, having\nwaited some time, walked into the kitchen, laughing, and said to the cook,\n\"Here, this girl Mary must be daft !

The board fell back over the hole again, and I went\ndown about 8 feet on the ground and rocks below. I felt a consciousness\nthat, as 1 started, my arms were uplifted as they would naturally be from the\ntossing of the board upward and backward, and too, they were scraped and\nbruised fearfully, the hole so small that it was a \" wonder how she ever went\nthrough it.\"\nAs I went down, it seems too that my face was turned upward, for I saw\nperfectly plain what I think was my spirit form poised above me, a full\nlength form, recognisable by me as my own self, being clad in a garment\nwhich I had worn that morning and to which I have for years been attached,\nkeeping it out in the country on this farm place for use whenever I may be\nthere. The tender, sorrowful sadness depicted in the face and in the\nattitude of the spirit form is indelibly impressed upon my mind. And\nmoreover, with my spirit-eyes I as plainly saw my body go down, saw the\nclothing, the skirts fluff out, filling with wind as they naturally would\nin falling feet foremost or partially so, as it seems to me I did, through\nthe air.\nThere was, to me, no board fallen back between me and my spirit, yet\nwe were apparently entirely disconnected.

So that\nmyself, body and spirit, is stronger and in better state than before.\nOne other life-saving experience, by spirit-power, has been mine. This\noccurred in 1863.\nI was very ill\u2014apparently at death's door with ulceration of stomach and\nbowels. No confidence in physicians, and would see none. Enemas of\nwarm water would alone relieve my agony, which came on every two hours\nor thereabouts. I had been sick more than a year, and for seventeen days\nI had hovered between life and death. This special day no one except my\nmother and myself was in the house. I was unable to move a hand or foot.\nA breath, seemingly, would carry me over ; and I remember perfectly that\nas my mother left me to go to a distant room on some errand, there seemed\nan open grave beside me on my right hand as I lay with closed eyes upon\nmy bed. Suddenly I heard an audible, yes, a loud, strong whisper, and the\nwords, \"You are washing your bowels all away!'' (This could not have\nbeen a result of my own thought, for it had never occurred to me that\nI was being harmed by the process which alone gave me relief.) I opened\nmy eyes, and at my left hand, close beside the bed, which was a narrow one,\nstood the perfect form of my old physician and preceptor, Dr. Field\u2014(Dr.\nField had passed over about two years previous to this time)\u2014for even then\nI had begun the study of medicine. His light, straight hair, parted and\n-combed just as in life, his old-fashioned stock, his peculiar blue eyes,\neverything in perfection, though less opaque in appearance than the real,\nbodily form, and as I looked the vision began to fade gradually from the\nbedside upwards towards the chest, then to the shoulders, neck, and face,\ntill finally all had disappeared.\nI had always and utterly repudiated everything tending towards\nspiritualism or spirit return, and now, when it was gone, I said to myself\n(and almost out of patience with myself for having credited it) \"That was\nall my imagination.\" Immediately, and just as real as the whisper had\nbeen, although I heard nothing, only felt it, something said \" I will show\nyou whether it is imagination ! \" And if my body had been lifted and laid\nupon a bed of living coals, my experience could not have been more\nagonizing. Powerless as I had been to move, I threw off my coverings, and\nexclaimed in spirit, \"Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief.\" And I\nhave believed from that very day.\nNothing would have induced me to take another enema. In three days\nmy sufferings were very much modified, my bowels became natural, and\nfrom that time forth although my recovery was very slow it was sure. Had\na knowledge of the power of mind over matter, and the power within\nmyself to control and heal myself which has since been vouchsafed me, been\nmine at that time, my sufferings need not have been so lingering nor so\ntrying as they were before health was restored.\nOther experiences, for which you may or may not care, have frequently\nbeen mine. For instance, wave following wave of the richest purple passes\nr\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research- [May, 1898-\nbefore me (my eyes being always closed), accompanied with such complete\nrest of body and mind that a few minutes of it seems almost equal to a\nnight's sleep. I always feel that this purple flood foretells success, but\nwhether it may be that it gives me much sweet rest, that like an elixir\nit renders me abler to ensure success in whatever I may desire to\naccomplish, I do not know.\nAnother purple, \u2014a spot about as large seemingly, as a half dollar, and so\nbrilliant as to be almost dazzling, \u2014 wheels and wheels around so rapidly as\nto be painful to follow it, and at length, may be in a minute, may be only a\nsecond, for I seem to have no thought of time, it slows down and in the\ncentre, a form (exactly the form of my dear mother) is plainly visible, but\nso very small, indeed like as if seen through the wrong end of a telescope ;\nthis, after a moment, fades and is gone. Then I seem to feel my mother's\npresence and converse with her as if present, the replies being felt but\nnever heard.\n******\nOne appearance seems to precede a death near me, as it has come to me\nat five different times and has always been followed very soon by a death of\nsome one in close proximity, but not in my family relations.

Sidgwick in the chair.\nThe Chairman stated that Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey, the author of the\nfirst paper to be read, was unable to be present owing to the effects of\nan accident.\nDr. Tuckey's paper entitled : \" The Influence of Suggestion on\nHealth, with special Reference to ' Christian Science,' \" was then read\nby Mr. St George Lane Fox.\nDr. Tuckey explained that his excuse for bringing the subject\nbefore the Society after the able and exhaustive manner in which it\nhad been handled by Mr. F. W. H. Myers and his brother the late Dr.\nA. T. Myers (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IX.) was that he had had\nconsiderable practical experience in the field of mental therapeutics\nand also that much public interest had been recently taken in the\nsubject of so-called \" Christian Science.\" The author then quoted\nvarious passages from a book by Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, entitled,\nScience and Health, with the view of showing the ignorance and\nabsurdity involved in them. He also referred to widely advertised\nquack nostrums, pills, electric belts, etc., and stated that cures never\ntheless often occurred in connection with such remedies after regular\npractitioners had failed. The \" curative force \" in all these cases was\ndue to suggestion. It appeared from the statements made by Mrs.\nEddy that medical diagnosis was held by the \" cult \" to be a mis\nchievous error, tending only to produce disease, whereas nearly all the\ngreatest triumphs in therapeutics were due to progress in this direction.\nThe author then dealt at length with the influence of suggestion in\nboth the production and the cure of disease, giving special atten\ntion to hypnotic suggestion. What was of value in \" Christian\nScience \" was not new ; its novelty consisted in the addition of much\nthat was false or ridiculous ; and it was evident that there was a very\nstrong commercial spirit animating Mrs. Eddy herself.\nThe Rev. Frederic Mann said that he sympathised with Dr.\nTuckey's criticism of the quackeries and other absurdities which in\nmany cases accompanied the promulgation of \" Christian Science,\" but\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1898.\nhe thought that there might be some danger that, while we saw the\nludicrous aspects of certain cases, we might forsake the attitude of\ncalm judgment. We should be very tolerant, remembering that a\nkind of healthy exaggeration was often attendant upon a presentation\nof new thought, and he believed that there was in Christian Science a\nnew and powerful realisation of neglected truth, although an obstacle\nin the way of its perception had been Mrs. Eddy's method of present\ning its principles. What Dr. Tuckey had said so excellently concerning\nthe power of \" suggestion \" did not entirely cover the ground.\n\" Suggestion\" was not a final explanation. The gap between thoughts\nand the physical action of the brain molecules had not been bridged,\nand the very facts cited regarding suggestion illustrated the power in\nmind to control the operations of so-called \" matter.\" Heresy was\noften a half truth, and there was no dogma that did not contain some\ntruth, along, perhaps, with much obvious error. There was much\ncrudity in Christian Science, but to judge it fairly we must remember\nthat its outlook is taken from a high level of metaphysical thought,\nquite apart from that of psychological experiment. Its presentations\nof the ultimate facts of life might indeed be faulty and one-sided, but\nviewing, it as a reaction from materialism, and from certain narrow\nforms of theological dogma, we might hope for some useful synthetic\nresult. He bespoke a tolerance and a patience in trying to sift the\ntruth from a great deal that might seem erroneous and absurd.\nThe Lady Isabel Margsson said that the value of Christian Science\nin England had been to show many persons the power that resided in\nthemselves of controlling their health, and to convince them that there\nwere spiritual realities behind matter. There were two special reasons,\nhowever, for not accepting Mrs. Eddy as a teacher. (1) Mrs. Eddy\nclaimed wrongly that her teaching was new. (2) She claimed a\nproperty in truth. As Emerson said, there was no property in truth.\nIt had always been held philosophically that we were more than we\nseemed to be, more than material beings, and a merit of Christian\nScience was that it led to the practical application of this. It was\nmetaphysics applied to daily life. She had known people who had been\nill and miserable, and who had been made strong and happy by the\ninfluence of Christian Science in their own lives. Such results could\nnot be overlooked, and showed that there was a truth worthy of\nconsideration in the teaching that gave these people a spirit to triumph\nover weaknesses to which they had previously yielded.\nMil. J. G. Smith then read a paper dealing with some cases which\nhad recently appeared in the Annates des Sciences Psychiques, beginning\nwith a short account of two experiments with a French woman, named\n\fJune, 1898.] Instruments Alleged to Indicate Cerebral Force,etc. 249\nAnna Brion, of Narbonne, in reading the contents of sealed envelopes,\n\u2014one conducted by Professor Grasset and the other by a committee of\nthe Academie des Sciences et Lettres of Montpellier. Photographs of\nthe envelope used in Professor Grasset's experiment were handed\nround for inspection and Mr. Smith drew attention to indications in\nthe photographs that suggested fraudulent opening of the envelope.\nIn the second experiment, the committee concerned had themselves\nsuggested grounds for concluding that fraud had been used.\nSome cases of table turning, with the accompanying phenomena of\nslate-writing communications from spirits, etc., recorded by M.\nRonillon in the September-October, 1897, and January-February,\n1898, numbers of the Annates des Sciences Psychiques were then read\nand commented on. Criticism was directed chiefly to the incom\npleteness of the evidence and to the absence of really test conditions.\nPart of the paper was omitted for want of time.\n(Only very brief abstracts of the papers are here given, as they will\nappear later in the Proceedings.)\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nREPORT ON INSTRUMENTS ALLEGED TO INDICATE\n\" CEREBRAL FORCE \" AND THE \" PSYCHIC ACTION\nOF THE WILL.\"\nSeveral forms of apparatus, including E. S. d'Odiardi's, Ditcham's,\netc., have been examined, all of which consist essentially of a light\nbody suspended in a glass bell jar by means of a silk or other fibre in\nsuch a manner that a very slight force exerted upon it from one side\nor other causes it to rotate about the point of suspension.\nIn the instruments inspected, the bodies suspended were made to\nmove by the approach of the whole body, by the hand alone or\nother part of the human body, or by heated bodies, as a glass of hot\nwater. The air currents set up by the warmth or movement of the\nwhole body or the hand were quite sufficient to account for any\ndeflection that resulted in the suspended body.\nThat air currents were formed was clearly shown by means of\nclouds of smoke. The approach of a slightly electrified object would,\nof course, exert a certain amount of force upon the suspended body\nand might induce some movement apart from air currents ; but there\nwas no evidence whatever of the exercise of any \" psychic force.\" It\nshould be added that neither in the suspended body itself, nor in the\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1898.\nmethod of suspension, was there anything in any way striking or\nnovel, or other than is perfectly familiar to every practical physicist.\nThese instruments do not contribute to our knowledge of \" psychic\nforce,\" as it is obvious that in order to make any satisfactory test for\nits presence the various forces well known to the physicist must be\neliminated altogether or duly accounted for in any experiment that is\nmade. The \" inventors \" of these \" psychic \" apparatus are evidently\nquite ignorant of the methods of scientific research. The claims made\nregarding d'Odiardi's instrument, in a book called Cheiro's Language\nof the Hand, that the deflection of the suspended body is a means not\nonly of demonstrating the existence of \" cerebral force \" but of\nregistering its amount, are entirely without foundation ; and we warn\nour readers against placing the slightest credence in the allegations\nmade by \" Cheiro \" and other persons that the instrument in question\nrecords the action of forces other than those well known to physicists.\nSt. George Lane Fox.\nA. Wallace, M.D.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nThe Consciousness of Dying.\n{To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nColumbia College, New York, April 16\u00abi, 1898.\nDear Sir, \u2014I have often been puzzled by a phenomenon whose possible\nexplanation did not occur to me until recently. The phenomenon, or at\nleast apparent phenomenon, is the consciousness of dying, which many seem\nto exhibit near the point of death. Whether there is evidence to suppose\nany such consciousness (immediate consciousness), I shall consider further on.\nI merely assume at present what many believe to be a fact, and what is often\nremarked as a noticeable circumstance, however it be interpreted. From\nthe materialistic point of view it would seem difficult, if not impossible, to\naccount for such a phenomenon. Thus, if materialism be true, death must\nbe the extinction of consciousness. It would seem then to be impossible\never to be conscious of dying ; that is, conscious that consciousness is being\nextinguished. Consequently, materialism would seem to make impossible\nthe phenomenon which is at least an apparent fact.\nThe real difficulty is to find evidence to show that the supposition is a\nfact. This may just as well be admitted. It is certain that we cannot\nobtain the direct testimony of consciousness itself except on the condition\nof dying ourselves. Hence whatever evidence we may claim to have must\nbe wholly inductive in its character. As a consequence of this the first step\n\fJune, 1898.] Correspondence. 251\nmust be the statement of a hypothetical case, based upon what we know, or\nassume that we know, about materialism. This, in the Lucretian form at\nleast, is that consciousness is extinguished at death. This extinction can\nnever be known by the subject of it. It might be inferred that the extinc\ntion is coming, but the immediate consciousness of such extinction would\nindubitably appear to be a contradiction. Hence the only meaning that we\ncould give to the expression, \"conscious of dying,\" assuming that it is an\nactual phenomenon of any significance at all, is that it represents, not the\nconsciousness of actual extinction, but the consciousness of mere separation\nfrom corporeal embodiment. If, then, it be a fact, we should have a\nphenomenon which is presumably impossible on the materialistic theory.\nConsequently it might be of some interest to psychical research to investi\ngate whether any such phenomenon does occur.\nI have stated the a priori difficulty in supposing the fact, and this is the\ncircumstance that direct proof must be found in the experience of the indi\nvidual himself who is dying, and external observers can only conjecture the\ncondition of consciousness in the dying. But there is another difficulty.\nOften enough a person fears that he is dying when he is not, and also we\noften observe cases where persons evidently near death think that they are\ndying, when, in fact, they may survive hours, days, weeks, or even recover\naltogether. When, therefore, we measure such instances against those\nwhich happen to be connected with actual death, we may raise the question\nwhether they are not after all merely inferences on the part of the decedent,\nand not immediate cognitions at all. Then again, in favour of materialism\nand against the hypothetical assumption here made, we have to meet the\nallegation that we can be conscious of going to sleep, which on a materialistic\ntheory ought to be as impossible as any alleged consciousness of dying,\nthough the fact of going to sleep is perfectly consistent with materialism.\nHence, if I can be conscious of going to sleep, which may be only the\ntemporary suspension as death is the permanent suspension of conscious\nness, why not, the materialist will ask, may it be possible to be conscious\nof dying ? All these facts throw the burden of proof upon the anti-\nmaterialist.\nNow, while I shall not undertake to prove a case here, I may indicate\ncertain interesting facts, or possible facts, that might make it worth an\neffort to study the cases where the consciousness of dying is alleged.\nIn the first place, it might be maintained that we are never conscious of\ngoing to sleep. If this be a fact, it would appear to confirm the supposition\nthat we could not, on a materialistic theory, be conscious of dying. The\nobjection to the alleged fact that we are never conscious of going to sleep\nwould be that as a matter of certitude we often, some people perhaps\nalways, know when we are going to sleep. This is an experience which I\nthink no one can dispute. But its meaning is not so easy to determine. We\ncan as easily explain this alleged consciousness of going to sleep by calling\nit an inference, as we can the alleged consciousness of dying. Consistency,\nat least, requires us to apply the same principle to both instances. On the\nmaterialistic theory both ought to be impossible, and, if apparent facts, must\n\f252 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1898.\nbe inferences. Consequently no one can suppose that we are conscious of\ngoing to sleep without admitting that we might be conscious of dying.\nThe doubt about the latter must apply also to the former, unless the con\nsciousness of dying be interpreted as mere departure from the organism.\nBut we are here considering the expression as standing for the suspension of\nconsciousness. Hence, if we were conscious of this suspension in one case\nwe ought to be so in the other, and the objections to both will be the same.\nNow, on any theory, I think it impossible for consciousness to be immediately\naware of its own suspension. At least, I cannot see how any other view of\nthe case is possible. This, however, is a priori, and may be questioned on\nthat ground, though I think it a fairly certain assumption. That the cases\nof alleged consciousness of going to sleep can be explained by inference is a\npresumption that the position here taken is true, to say the least. At any\nrate, as much proof is required to show that we can be conscious of going to\nsleep as is needed to maintain that we can be conscious of extinction. When\nit comes to facts I can say personally that I have never in my life been con\nscious of going to sleep. Like many or all others, I am able to tell when\nsleep approaches, but it may be interesting to the reader to know that this is\nnot always the case. Only occasionally do I know anything of what is called\ngoing to sleep, and by far the largest part of my life was spent up to the\npresent with the rarest consciousness of any signs of oncoming sleep, and I\nbelieve the perfectly normal and healthy condition of life to be one in which\neven the approach of sleep is either a rare or an improbable fact of conscious\nness. I have found it only when I \"was unwell, or when there was a gradual\ntransition from extreme nervous wakefulness, in which I was able to notice\nmy thoughts wandering. This I inferred to indicate the approach of sleep.\nBut in all other conditions, sleep has come with the suddenness and ignorance\nthat we should expect in the suspension of consciousness. I have been able\nto discover no traces of an immediate knowledge of this suspension. Only\na few indications even of its approach are accessible. They are a physical\nsensation of weariness, the dropping of the eyelids, the wandering of my\nthoughts, and the discovery, when reading, that my memory has little\ntenacity. I do not observe all of these signs on every occasion. The most\nfrequent one is the physical sensation, perhaps combined with the dropping\nof the eyelids. The detection of wandering thoughts is very rare, and has\noccurred only within the last two years. No experiences in hearing, taste,\nor smell have ever been remarked as similar signs. Often, howeTer, not one\nof these indications is present. Sleep comes without warning, and there is\nnot the slightest suggestion of its approach or inception. If, then, I may\ntake such facts as typical of what we generally call the consciousness of\ngoing to sleep, we have an explanation that accords with the judgment that\nconsciousness cannot be aware of its own suspension. This conclusion, we\nhave found, applies equally to the phenomenon of death, considered as\nextinction. But what if we should ascertain evidence to make it probable,\nin some instances at least, that persons are conscious of dying, immediately\nconscious of a fact that shows no distinct traces of inference in it ? Would\nwe not have a fact in such a case which suggests the survival of consciousness\n\fJune, 18U8.] Correspondence. 253\napart from the organism rather than its extinction, the consciousness of\nwhich must be impossible unless we change our conception of the postulates\nof materialism ?\nIn answering this question, I shall freely admit that direct proof of\nanything but inference in alleged cases of the consciousness of dying is not\npossible. But we sometimes hear of cases that suggest that interpretation\nand it only remains to investigate such in order to ascertain more about\nthem. The phenomenon is often enough remarked in a way that indicates\nsurprise and that the very opposite would be expected. I can report none,\nhowever, that have any scientific weight. They are mostly such as appear in\nthe talk of friends, and generally without the care in observation that is\nnecessary to make instances of the kind strongly suggestive. More striking\nare cases where the person seems to suddenly discover approaching death and\nshows a calmness that is not usual in regard to it. I cannot detail any\ninstances of this, though I have heard one very remarkable case narrated.\nThe moral courage of the decedent, however, must be reckoned with in\nmaking up our judgment. But I know one instance that has a few features\nworth recording. I helped to nurse a man during the last week of his life,\nand had an excellent opportunity to observe all the symptoms of death. The\ncase was one in which the man had been an invalid for thirty years, though\nthe constitution was most excellent in every particular except for the\naffliction of locomotor ataxy. There was a slight attack of apoplexy twenty\nyears before death. About two years before death paralysis of the larynx\noccurred, and after a time something like cancer of the larynx. But\ndigestion remained unimpaired until two months before death. On the\npatient's deathbed there were several suffocating spells caused by spasms of\nthe larynx. But these decreased in intensity as death approached, and\nthere was not the slightest trace of them during the last forty-eight\nhours. In these struggles there were the most evident indications that\nthe patient expected death to ensue, but they were as evidently inferential\nin their nature. The patient showed great willingness to have the pulse\nexamined and to receive that attention which was due to him in the\ncircumstances. Knowing that he could not recover he often felt his own\npulse, which kept in very good condition until a few hours before death.\nDelirium appeared only once or twice, and only for a short time, during the\nlast two days of life. The voice, only a loud whisper at any time, became\nweaker. But until within a very short time before death there was the usual\nwillingness to have all necessary examinations made of the pulse and other\nsymptoms of his condition. During the last night there was evidently much\npain or discomfort, though endured without murmuring, and consciousness\nwas not clear. There were periods of stupor and fitful sleep, interrupted by\nfrequent requests to be turned over and expressions of pain. But in the\nmorning about two hours before death this fitfulness passed away and\nconsciousness became much clearer. The hunger, which is so often the\nmessenger of death, appeared, but the muscles of the throat would permit\nonly a partial satisfaction, and the patient lay back with a distinct conscious\nness of his weakness. It was evident to those at his side that the end was\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1898.\nnear, though the pulse indicated it less than the general weakness. But half\nan hour before the end the patient seemed to show decided distaste to the\nexamination of his pulse, and pulled his hand away from mine with some\nimpatience. Several times he pressed the hand of his wife in indication of\nthe end. There was much struggling to get breath, though it did not show any\nmuscular expression of either pain or alarm that had accompanied the spasms\nof the larynx. Though not at all so distinct as might be desirable, the\nindications that the patient was conscious of dying were tolerably apparent.\nThe recovery of a clearer consciousness in the morning before death, the\nunusual and impatient dislike of having the pulse examined, and the signs\nto his wife which had not been given during the severer spasms, were\nall suggestive, even if they were not decisive, of the consciousness of\ndying.\nI do not pretend here to have produced anything like proof of such\nconsciousness, but only a case where I was able to observe the phenomena\nconnected with death a little more carefully than is usual, and there are, as\nwe see, some indications that there was a consciousness of the situation\nwhich might not have been suspected. It is only a suggestion that such\ncircumstances ought to be studied more than they are if we are to have a\nbetter knowledge of their nature and meaning. There is an a priori fact\npossibly bearing upon such cases, suggesting their genuineness and signifi\ncance. It is that inference is usually, if not always, in normal life, connected\nwith some previous experience which has had the meaning inferred in the nevj\ncase. But as the subject has had no experience involving the connection of\na sensation with death, it would appear remarkable that it should infer a fact\nwhich is interpreted as extinction, an experience which it has not had. A\nnew experience of an extraordinary kind might, of course, suggest death as\nits explanation, though it might equally suggest mere wonder at its newness\nas strange sensations often do. In normal life variations from usual\nsensations awaken curiosity and do not always suggest the approach of death.\nHence the question here is an open one. If the subject had had any\nexperience which it knew meant death, then the consciousness of dying\ncould easily be explained. But the absence of such experience leaves the\nquestion open to investigation in spite of anything that we can consider\nprobable in it. That the explanation, in the consciousness of the subject\nhaving the experience, takes the form of supposing the approach of death,\nmight be suggested by the a priori conception of death as the departure of the\nsoid from the body, which a long religious teaching has made general. Hence,\nas the meaning inferred in such supposed cases is wholly new, assuming\nthat it is an inference, we can wonder why the object of it should be death,\nthis not being the invariable accompaniment of new sensations, unless it be\nthe discovery by the subject that the experience conforms to the religious\nbelief or conception that death is not the extinction but the severance of\nconsciousness from the body. In this view of it we should have inference,\nbut more than inference at the same time. Besides interpretation we should\nhave the immediate realisation of a fact that might have much importance\nagainst the supposition of extinction.\n\fJune, 1898.] Correspondence. 255\nI am not stating a conviction but a problem, which can be investigated,\nonly by inductive methods of course, but yet conceivably open to intelligent\nconviction one way or the other. In conceiving the consciousness of death\nas possibly more than an inference, I do not intend to imply that it should\nbe a frequent phenomenon. On the contrary, it may be as rare as you\nplease to consider it. If we interpret sleep as the suspension of conscious\nness, as I think we must do, under any theory whatever, then it would be\nquite probable, even supposing the persistence of the subject after death,\nthat this suspension would generally, if not always, take place at death, per\nmanently, of course, on the theory of materialism, but temporarily, at least,\non the opposing theory. But there might be exceptions to this suspension\nat the moment of decease, if death is not extinction. There might be cases\nwhere the subject retains consciousness of the severance, similar to those\nexperiences on record in which the person says that he has seemed to leave\nthe body. It is simply a question of evidence, whether we can determine\nthe probabilities of such a consciousness or whether we find the facts either\nwithout significance or disproving the hypothesis. If we find phenomena,\nnormal or abnormal, in the experience of the living and resembling what we\nmight imagine to be at least an occasional phenomenon of the dying, we\nshould give the problem the attention it deserves, and endeavour to ascer\ntain whether the so-called consciousness of dying is anything more than an\ninference, or like those apprehensions about death that are often illusions.\u2014\nVery sincerely,\nJames H. Hyslop.\nProfessor Hyslop adds, in a letter of April 24th, 1898 : \u2014\nSince mailing you my letter on the possible significance of the alleged\nconsciousness of dying, I yesterday came across an interesting little book,\ncalled X Rays, by Gail Hamilton, whom I think most people in the world of\nletters well know. It contains quite a number of just such cases as I had in\nmind. They, of course, are not so well authenticated as one would like to\nsee them, but there is some care in the selection and description of them.\nThey suggest very clearly the conception of the phenomenon I was discuss\ning and confirm the possibility that an investigation of such instances might\nexhibit some very interesting results.\nSpiritualism and Spirit Identity.\nJudging by the two letters in the last Journal, it is evident that I have\nnot yet succeeded in expressing myself in a convincing manner. The position\nwhich I am endeavouring to maintain may nevertheless be a sound one.\nThe exposition is not always worthy of the cause. I think, however, that\nboth Mr. Schiller and Dr. Hodgson have shown some ingenuity in missing\nthe point ; their remarks, moreover, would seem to suggest that no one who\nis not prepared to give a simple, complete, and final explanation of all the\nmysteries of individuality and self-consciousness can have any title to make\nan attempt at the work of their elucidation ! The origin of this discussion\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [June, 1898.\nis simply this : I had noticed what appeared to be an obvious error in the\nprevailing method of dealing with psychic phenomena, and it occurred to\nme that by helping to remove it a step would be taken in the right direction.\nMr. Schiller is quite wrong in saying that I studiously evade what he calls\nthe \"main point,\" viz., the question \"whether 'spirit' phenomena justify\nus in attributing them to persons in the same way as we recognise the\npersonality of our fellow men.\" I had merely failed to discover its impor\ntance. The answer to this \" main point\" must surely depend upon who is\nmeant by \"we.\" The sense of the term personality is ambiguous, its uses\nbeing various and vague ; but they are all for the most part associated with\nfamiliar mundane experiences, necessarily limited by our bodily conditions,\nso that the ideas underlying them could rarely be said to have any perma\nnent value in determining the fundamental meaning of Individuality, when\nand where these conditions no longer obtain. The great aim of Psychical\nResearch, as I understand the matter, is the correction and expansion of\nprevailing beliefs concerning life and its phenomena. Now the main obstacle\nthat confronts us at the outset is the difficulty of language ; and it was for\nthis reason that I ventured to make a protest against the improper use that\nwas being made of the word spirit. In common language the word has a\nwell-ascertained meaning, and I humbly urge that this should be adhered to.\nWe all know what is meant when we speak of an individual being animated\nby the spirit of love, or that it is the determining factor of certain thoughts,\nfeelings, and actions ; but it would be difficult to know what is intended\nwhen some one begins to talk of \"a spirit\" going about by itself like a\nballoon and occupying the body of a medium, or becoming visible by\n\"materialisation.\" I also ventured to protest against the ideas of per\nmanence or immutability being applied to individuality. Nothing can be\nreally permanent but truth. Individual life necessarily involves change,\neither development or decay in the process of evolution.\nA comprehensive theory covering all the phenomena of self-consciousness,\nmemory, and spiritual evolution, cannot reasonably be demanded of me\nmerely because I have endeavoured to point out what, in all sincerity, I\nregard as a grievous source of error in the treatment of these questions. If,\nhowever, I am not trespassing too much on your space I should be glad to\nbe allowed to offer a few remarks by way of indicating the direction in which\nI believe the truth is to be found. First, then, I hold that a critical exami\nnation of our mental states, by the systematic and vigorous exercise of the\nfaculties of thought and memory, will lead to the abandonment of the belief\nin a permanent self or ego ; and to the realisation of the fact that the ego is\nno more than a transitory polarisation of feelings, tastes, and desires ; that\nalthough connected by memory the ego of one mental state is not the ego of\nanother ; that in proportion as the mind becomes enlightened, and becomes\na true vehicle of truth, so it becomes less egotistical and loses in degree the\nessentials of personality, or, in other words, it becomes relatively freed from\nthe false sense of isolation, greed, bigotry, vanity, hate, and lust. Thus the\nprogress of the mind towards truth involves the gradual abandonment of the\nideas and feelings of an absolutely separate self, and the development of a\n\fJune, 1808.] Correspondence. 257\nhappy disposition, which manifests love, sympathy, kindness, charity,\nforbearance, and all the virtues. The growth of the mind in this direction\nmight well be described as its progress in spirituality, for with it spring into\nactivity fresh mental energies, new and keener faculties, deeper and more\nfar-reaching than before.\nIt is often asked what practical outcome has resulted from the work of\nthe Society for Psychical Research ? To this I would reply that its inquiries\nand discussions have done much towards the establishment of the doctrine,\ngiven such eloquent expression to by Mr. Myers, that the discovery of truth\nis practically synonymous with the development of faculty ; or, in other\nwords, that the growth of knowledge depends upon the organised extension\nof the threshold of sensibility to wider regions of understanding and ex\nperience.\nSt. G. Lane Fox.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nBeing in some sympathy with what I suppose to be the main intention of\nMr. St. George Lane Fox's protest against the popular use of the terms\n\" Spirit,\" \" Spiritualism,\" etc., I should like to be allowed to take part in\nthe discussion which his letter in the February Journal has elicited.\n\" Spiritualism \" properly and primarily signifies a philosophical tendency\nof thought, or Welt-Anschauung, opposed to the materialistic tendency, and\nto Pantheistic systems which subordinate conscious intelligence to nature.\nThe philosophical sense has thus a recognisable, if remote, affinity to the\nsecondary, special and empirical sense which the term has acquired in con\nnection with phenomenal evidence that consciousness is not an accident of\nphysical organisation. Thus, too, one may be a \" Spiritualist \" in that\nsecondary sense without believing in the perpetuation of the Ego-conscious\nness on an identifiable line of level continuity. I accept the designation\nmyself, though in my long association with the subject I have never con\ncealed my inability to get determinately much beyond Mr. Lane Fox's\nproposition (Journal, p. 185), that \"there is probably\" [I should say,\ncertainly] \" some definite though transcendental connection between some\nof the phenomena exhibited and the past or even future life of the\nindividual persons concerned.\" (I do not adopt this as the most satisfactory\nformula for the result of the experience in question, but for the present\npurpose it will serve.)\nThe motive of Mr. Lane Fox's letter appears to be contempt for what,\nmany years ago, in addressing my friends the Spiritualists themselves, I\nventured to call \"a bourgeois conception of immortality.\" But he seems to\nme to confuse what he describes as the \" theory \" of Spiritualists with their\nevidence. And, perhaps, I need hardly follow your correspondent, Mrs.\nBrowne (Journal, March), in protesting against the ridiculous phrase, \"a\nlump of spirit in human form,\" as at all applicable to any conception ever\nentertained by Spiritualists, of the \" bearer \" of posthumous consciousness.\nThe fact is they have simply used the expression \"a spirit\" to signify the\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jc.ve, 1S98.\nconcrete unity of personality and form, just as everyone uses the expression\n\"a man.\" The doctrine of the \"vehicles\" (o^tjfiard), gross and subtle,\nis of the most ancient and respectable authority, as may be seen by reference\nto the citations in the 2nd Volume of Cudworth's Intellectual System of the\nUniverse, to say nothing of the \"vestures\" enumerated in the Upanishads,\nnor of St. Paul. Mr. Lane Fox kuows all that as well as anyone, and I\nthink he ought to have known that the terminology of the modern \" Spirit\nualist\" is simply taken over, if uncritically, from a traditional use. Nor is\nthe term \"spirit \" or \" a spirit \" quite indefensible, when understood, as it\nis or should be, as simply relative to our present sense objectivity\u2014not in\nantithesis to corporeity in general. If, however, Mr. Lane Fox's objection\nto the word \" spirit \" extends to its identification with self-conscious intelli\ngence, he stands before us as the critic of Hegel and other great lights of\nmodern philosophy, and no longer as just the superior person before whom\nthe poor empirical Spiritualist must quail. And if, on the metaphysical\nquestion of individuality, he really imagined that he had only this despised\nopponent to encounter, the letters of Mr. Schiller will have convinced him\nof his mistake.\nNevertheless, it is quite possible for an Idealist and a Spiritualist, both\nwhich I profess myself to be, to sympathise with Mr. Lane Fox, (1) in not\nbelieving, or desiring to believe, in the perpetuation of the Ego-conscious -\nness as now determined, out of the conditions of such determination, (2) in\ndeclining to accept the best evidence of \"spirit-identity\" as proof of a\npermanent continuity or sequence in the conditioning of personal conscious\nness as now known to us. Depending upon phenomenal evidence, we\ncannot, I have long been convinced, get beyond the conception which the\nFrench Positivist, M. D'Assier, presents in his interesting book, L'Humanite\nPosthume, (Paris, 1883), of a temporary animal survival associated with a\nretreating psychical consciousness, and a disintegrating memory. This is\nwhat we should expect from failure of regular organic relation with the\nworld of our past experience and interests. It is in agreement with nearly,\nif not quite, all the indisputable evidence of outside intelligence in the\ncommunications, which show a greater frequency, animation, and coherence\nin the case of the recently, and especially of the prematurely, deceased, and\nalso a usual failure to react connectedly and lucidly upon questions\naddressed by ourselves, however perfect the \"control\" may apparently\nbe. That view is also in accordance with a universal analogy, that of\nthe alternation of states of externality and internality, or of manifestion and\noccultation ; out-breathing and in-breathing. It is the law throughout all\nthe life and nature whose cycles we know : it is observed in respiration, in\nvegetation, in the day, in the year, in that smaller cycle within our own\norganic period, its waking and sleeping states. If we believe in a deep root\nof individuality, its larger cycle of expression and indrawal, of organic\nrenewals and periods of subjective rest and assimilation, is a hypothesis so\nnatural\u2014 not to say of such wide and ancient prevalence\u2014that we in this\nSociety should surely ask if there is anything in the experience we study con\nformable to it. And at least I think we discover a significant extension of\n\f.Tune, 1898.] Obituary. 259\nthe analogy. For the communications which we can best associate with the\npersonalities of the deceased have, or soon acquire, a character suggestive of\nthat intermediate condition between waking and sleep which varies so much\nand so often in duration, and in the degree of surviving lucidity.\nOne word more. The rejection of individuality by essentially ethical\nthinkers like Mr. Lane Fox presupposes the common form of the conception,\nwhich is that of an abstract monadism or unatoned (unintegrated) pluralism.\nIf, on the other hand, we conceive individuality according to the analogy of\nthe cellular constituents of an organism, it will be seen that relativity, not\nextinction or absorption, is the true ideal. As the particular self recognises\nits universal truth, the tendency must be more and more to realise that truth\nin universal relation and reciprocity of influence, exclusive egotism becoming\nimpossible in the plenitude of harmonious consciousness, and particularity\nbeing felt only as a basis of reception and reaction, mediating distribution.\nBut the absolute negation of the individual is negation of the universe.\nC.

Massey.\nThe Divining Rod\u2014To American Members.\n{To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nVale Lodge, Hampstead Heath, London, N.W.\nSir,\u2014Though the atmosphere of the States has probably been uncongenial\nto the practice of the divining rod and its record, I think it likely that more\nnotices of it exist than I have yet succeeded in including in our forthcoming\nbibliography of the subject. I shall therefore be glad if our American\nmembers will put me in the way of getting references, other than those in\nfoole's Index and in the American Journal of Folk-Lore.

PEARSALL SMITH.\nMr. R. Pearsall Smith, Member of Council S.P.R., died on April\n17th last, and I wish to add my own personal expression of regret to\nthat recorded at the Council Meeting.\nIt was at Mr. Smith's home in Philadelphia that the first Com\nmittee Meeting was held, under the auspices of Professor Barrett, that\nafterwards resulted in the formation of an American Society for\nPsychical Research ; and when, later, the American Society was\nactually established in Boston, he was a Member of its first Council,\nappointed at the end of 1884, and he rendered the most valuable\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

During the last\nten years Mr. Smith resided chiefly in England, but he continued to-\nmaintain a warm interest in the American Society, even after it ceased\nto be an independent Society in January, 1890, and became a Branch\nof the parent S.P.R. ; he gave generous financial aid to it not only at\nthe time of its origin, but at later periods also, and was ever ready\nwith the fullest sympathetic encouragement for our work.\nR. H.\nTHE RIGHT HON. W. E. GLADSTONE.\nMr. Gladstone's relation to Psychical Research affords one more\nillustration of the width and force of his intellectual sympathies.\nMany men, even of high ability, if convinced as Mr. Gladstone was of\nthe truth and sufficiency of the Christian revelation, permit themselves\nto ignore these experimental approaches to spiritual knowledge, as at\nbest superfluous. They do not realise how profoundly the evidence,\nthe knowledge, which we seek and which in some measure we find,\nmust ultimately influence men's views as to both the credibility and\nthe adequacy of all forms of faith. Mr. Gladstone's broad intellectual\npurview,\u2014aided perhaps in this instance by something of the practical\nforesight of the statesman,\u2014placed him in a quite different attitude\ntowards our quest. \" It is the most important work which is being\ndone in the world,\" he said in a conversation in 1885. \" By far the\nmost important,\" he repeated, with a grave emphasis which suggested\nprevious trains of thought, to which he did not care to give expression.\nHe went on to apologise, in his courteous fashion, for his inability\nto render active help ; and ended by saying, \" If you will accept\nsympathy without service, I shall be glad to join your ranks.\" He\nbecame an Honorary Member, and followed with attention, \u2014I know\nnot with how much of study,\u2014the successive issues of our Proceedings.\nTowards the close of his life he desired that the Proceedings should be\nsent to St. Deiniol's Library, which he had founded at Hawarden ;\u2014\nthus giving final testimony to his sense of the salutary nature of our\nwork. From a man so immersed in other thought and labour that\nwork could assuredly claim no more ; from men profoundly and\nprimarily interested in the spiritual world it ought, I think, to claim\nno less.\nF.

W.\nH. Myers in the chair.\nProfessor W. F. Barrett gave an address, \" A Second Report on\nthe So-called Divining Rod,\" the paper being a sequel to the Report\npublished in Part XXXII. Proceedings S.P.R.\nProfessor Barrett stated that, after the lengthy report recently\npublished on the divining rod, some surprise might be felt that this\nsubject should again occupy the attention of the Society, the more so\nas it was a question which, at first sight, seemed unworthy of serious\nand prolonged inquiry. This view was, however, a superficial one, for\nthose who might have read the previous report would have recognised\nthat whilst many of the pretensions of the \"dowser\" or water-finder\nwere absurd, there remained a considerable body of well-attested\nevidence on behalf of the real practical value of dowsing for under\nground water. The lecturer was glad to find this opinion shared by so\nable a geologist as Mr. T. V. Holmes, F.G S. (ex-president of the London\nGeological Association), who had recently published a paper on the\ndivining rod, and to whom Professor Barrett expressed his indebtedness\n\fJuly, 1898.] General Meeting. 263\nfor many suggestive geological criticisms of the cases recorded in the\nprevious report. Professor Barrett also acknowledged the great assist\nance he had received from Mr. E. Westlake, F.G.S., who had visited,\nand carefully examined from a geological point of view, numerous\nplaces where the dowser appeared to have succeeded after other previous\nattempts to find water had failed. These criticisms and inquiries had\nundoubtedly diminished the surprise with which some of the successes\nof the dowser were viewed by unscientific witnesses ; on the other hand\ncloser investigation had shown that there were a certain number of out\nstanding cases which could only be described as inexplicable from\nany ordinary scientific standpoint. These cases, such as the \" Water-\nford case \" in the last report, and others to be described in\nthe present Report, could not be explained away by any shrewd\nness, or surface indications of underground water, affording the\nrequisite information to the dowser. Whether the number of\nsuch outstanding cases was much beyond what might fairly be\nattributed to chance coincidence was the question that remained to\nbe decided. Professor Barrett was of opinion that the view which he\nhad expressed in his previous report in favour of what might provi\nsionally be called a \" dowsing faculty \" was supported by more recent\ninquiries. At the same time he pointed out that this faculty appeared\nto be a rare one, and he expressed a doubt whether many of the\nprofessional dowsers now living could lay claim to it.\nThe mere fact of the apparently spontaneous motion of a forked\ntwig in the hands of certain persons was no proof of the possession of\nsuch a faculty, since the divining rod would work in the hands of\nnearly everyone if certain rules be followed. The motion of the rod\nwas simply due to unconscious muscular action on the part of the\ndowser, a fact which Professor Barrett had been able conclusively to\nestablish through the assistance of Professor Purser, M.D., the\ndistinguished professor of Physiology in Trinity College, Dublin.\nThe rod was merely a convenient index of a sub-conscious impression\non the part of the dowser. The lecturer then pointed out that there\nwere cogent reasons why the source of this impression must be\nsought for not in the physical but in the psychical world, and that if a\ndowsing faculty existed it would probably be found correlated to other\npsychical phenomena which must eventually force themselves upon the\nattention of scientific men.\nProfessor Barrett then referred to the evidence on behalf of the\nuse of the rod in the search for underground metallic veins and\nrecounted the numerous other uses to which the divining rod had been\napplied during the past four centuries. He then briefly sketched the\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1898.\nhistory of the modern dowsing rod. A detailed report would be given\nlater in the Proceedings, together with a voluminous and admirable\nbiography of the rod, which had been prepared by Mr. E. Westlake.\nA number of lantern slides, illustrating the past history and use of the\nrod, were thrown on the screen in the course of Professor Barrett's\naddress.\nMb. J. F. Young, an amateur \" dowser,\" illustrated the different\nmethods known to him of holding the divining rod, and replied to\nvarious questions, explaining that for the last four or five years he had\nfound it at least equally serviceable to hold his hands extended some\nwhat in front of him, without holding a rod at all. Water was\nindicated by a curious sensation in his hands, somewhat like that pro\nduced by a small induction coil. He used also a small forked aluminium\nwire, holding the end between finger and thumb. He said that this\nrotated, and he was unable to explain its rotation by muscular action,\nalthough he believed generally that the movements of the rod were\ndue to the unconscious muscular action of the operator.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nPSYCHICAL HEREDITY.\nThe following narrative has been recently written by a gentleman\nwell-known to me, an active clergyman of the Church of England.\nOf his good faith there can be no doubt, and the narrative may, I\nbelieve, be regarded as substantially accurate ; indeed there are about\nit no features which we can consider extraordinary, but it suggests the\ndesirability of keeping complete family records and of subsequently\nhaving them collated to see if the inheritance of psychical faculty\nfollows laws akin to those of colour blindness, arithmetical or musical\ngenius, and other slight abnormalities. n T\nThreb Generations of Psychical Faculty.\nMy father was born in 1790, and lived during the early years of his life\nunder the strong emotional influences of early Methodism. He saw\n\"ghosts,\" or, at least, he thought he did, which, as far as he was concerned,\nmeans the same thing.\nWhen I was seventeen, he took me into Yorkshire to see the scene of his\nmost vivid experience of this sort.\nA large house stood back at some distance from the high road in an\nextensive park. A carriage drive led from the house to the road, which it\ncut at right angles. My father described to me with precise detail, how at\n\fJuly, 1898.] Psychical Heredity. 265\nmy age he was returning home one night, the moon being at the full, when,\non passing this avenue, he was surprised to see a horse and rider galloping\ntowards him through the park at a great pace. Curiosity prompted him to\nstand aside and see who it was. As the horse issued from the gate, he saw\nthat a lady was seated on the pillion behind the rider, very pale and sad, and\nhe recognised her as the lady of the mansion hard by. Then he said fear\nsucceeded to wonder, when, instead of turning to right or left along the\nhighway, the horse appeared to gallop forward in air across the hedge on the\nother side of the road and so in time became lost to view. He hurried home\nto relate his adventure, and next morning heard the news, that the previous\nevening the lady had died in giving birth to her first child.\nFrom his first experience I will pass to his last. Before he married my\nmother, a rich widow, who was a very intimate friend, proposed to him, but\nhe declined the suggestion. When his first daughter was born, this lady\nbegged him to have no anxiety as to her future, as she should regard it as\nher privilege to provide for her. The girl practically became her child,\nspent most of her time with her, and was always taught by her adopted\nmother that she would inherit a fortune.\nI well remember my father coming down to breakfast one morning looking\nhaggard and anxious. Upon being pressed as to the cause, he said that in\nthe early morning hours he had distinctly seen Mrs. X. standing by his\nbedside with signs of agonizing distress, which he could only interpret as\nassertive of innocence about something, and deprecatory of his displeasure.\nHe insisted on starting at once to visit her, but, before he could do so, news\ncame of her death. He went to the funeral and heard the will read, which\ncontained no allusion whatever to my sister. The will was a very old one,\nand left everything to a relative, who had the custody of it. We have long\nknown that the codicil in favor of my sister was destroyed by this relative,\nbut, as my sister died a few months after her godmother, no steps were\never taken to secure legal proof of the crime.\nThese two instances of my father's idiosyncrasy must suffice. I have\noften heard him say, that his ghostly experiences gave him no fear, and\nthat nothing would afford him more pleasure than an interview with the\nspirit of a departed friend. I have known him walk for hours in the deepest\ndarkness of the remote country in the hope of an encounter with some\nvisitant from the spirit state. Moreover, he would derive the strongest\nintuitions from dreams and voices, which he said were inaudible to the ear,\nbut curiously articulate to his consciousness. As an example of the former,\nhe came down one cloudless morning in June and incongruously begged my\nmother to have an early lunch, saying that there was going to be a fearful\nthunderstorm, and he should not like to have steel articles lying about. He\nthen went on to describe how he had dreamt of such a storm, how a globe\nof fire had seemed to enter the room, and a stack of chimneys at the old\nmanor house across the way had been simultaneously knocked down.\nCertain it is, that everything happened precisely as he had dreamt it, though\nthe storm came on so suddenly, that at the beginning of lunch my mother\nhad chaffed him by pointing to the still cloudless sky and asking him what\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1898.\nhad become of his dream ! Twenty minutes later the ball of fire had\nblinded them and the manor house chhnneys had fallen.\nAs to the voices, he always had an outdoor oratory, consisting of a plain\nwooden chair, against which he knelt on the ground in some secluded bit of\nthe boscage. A favourite little daughter was seized with diphtheria in the\nfirst year of its appearance, and from the first moment he said she would die.\nHis oracle always answered, \" What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou\nshalt know hereafter.\"\nShortly afterwards I lay at death's door with typhoid, and was given up\nby my doctors. But he was always cheerful and confident, as his oracle\npersistently assured him : \"Thy son liveth.\" I must in justice add, that a\nmore practical man than my father could nowhere be found. His whole life\nwas spent in vigorous activities, and his psychical other-world experiences\nhappened in the ordinary course of things. I remember how they used to\nseem to him natural incidents in his career. It would never have occurred\nto him to publish them.\nNow I must ask your patience while I recount to you some symptoms of\nthe form in which I think my father's temperament has descended to me.\nI squirm at the bare idea of a ghost ; I hate the dark ; I dislike every\nthing connected with death ; I scoff at dreams and intuitions ; and yet I\nhave had some experiences which I attribute to heredity and which are, to\nsay the least, coincidences worth recital.\nThe first I can remember had to do with my father. On October 25th,\n1865, I was reading hard for my tripos in the following March in my college\nrooms at Cambridge. I always worked until midnight. That evening I\nsuddenly became aware of an appalling fear, so strange and weird that it\ndrove me from my room to seek the companionship of a man opposite. I\nlooked at my watch as I hurried out of the room, and saw that it was five\nminutes to twelve. My neighbour exclaimed, on seeing me enter, \"How\npale you look ! You might have seen a ghost.\" I had no thought of ghosts,\nand only wondered what had really happened to me. I refused pipe and\ndrink, and said I only wanted to be with someone for a few minutes. In a\nvery short time the incredible oppression passed. I felt quite well again,\nand went off to bed, laughing at my own absurdity. I noticed that it was\njust after twelve by his mantel clock. I awoke in the morning perfectly\nfit, and read hard at Pindar until about eleven, when I heard a knocking\nat my door. Enough to say, it was a brother-in-law, who had hastened\nup to break the news that my father had been seized with acute angina\nat five minutes to twelve the previous night, and was a corpse at twelve\no'clock, the times exactly coinciding with my sense of horror and experience\nof relief.*\n* During the brief attack his mind was so alive and active, that he was able to\nindicate where a considerable sum of money was concealed, and to show the deepest\ninterest in the members of his family who were present. This may in some sort\nanswer the objection, that the mind becomes too feeble on the approach of death to\nmake itself felt at a distance, assuming such a phenomenon to be ever possible.\n\fJuly, 1808.] Psychical Heredity. 267\nSome years elapsed before my attention was drawn by a cognate experi\nence to some peculiarity in my own constitution. I had a godmother,\nbetween whom and me there had existed for many years the tenderest\naffection. So marked was her regard for me, that her children, much older\nthan myself, showed some little jealousy, as I thought at that timo, and\nput difficulties in the way of my seeing her. This led to my saying one\nday, that were I a thousand miles away at her death, I would stand at\nher grave, if it were possible to do so. This pleased her, and she said if\nshe could help me to do so she would. I did stand by her grave, and\nit fell out in the most incalculable and involuntary way. I was then\nrector of a church in A, and on a certain Monday in July, 187-, with\nmy wife, was taking a large congregational party to C . As this\nwas half way to B, where my old godmother lived, I determined to quit\nthe party in the evening and go on to see her, taking with me a small bag of\nrequisites for the night. But on returning to the station at C, I suddenly\nchanged my intention and went back to A, for which I had to face a good\ndeal of chaff for my inexplicable irresolution. I could give no reason ; I\nonly knew that I felt an indescribable barrier between me and my journey.\nFor no special reason I fixed the following Wednesday for the journey, and\nin the evening reached the house of our family lawyer, with whom I had\nsome business and was to stay. Almost his first words were, \"I suppose\nyou have heard of the death of Mrs. H. She died on Monday afternoon.\"\nI said to him, \"Then I shall be able to fulfil a wish and be at her funeral.\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"not unless you can spare a Sunday, as she is not to be\nburied until Monday. Her son has some extraordinary notions on the sub\nject.\" Not to weary you with details, a curious chain of incidents, which\nseemed to be a series of annoying contretemps at the moment, brought me\nnext day, Thursday, to my godmother's house in the suburbs five minutes\nbefore the funeral started for the churchyard across the road. In fact, had\nI planned the whole thing with the utmost precision, I could not have\naccomplished my purpose with more complete accuracy. It was not one\ncoincidence, but many, which have to be accounted for in this unique\nepisode. First there was my own unaccountable change of purpose on the\nMonday, my equally unaccountable choice of Wednesday for my journey,\nthe alteration of the day of burial to Thursday instead of the following\nMonday, and then the catena of circumstances which brought me to the\ndoor just as the funeral was being marshalled. Since then, one of the\nmost marked features in my life has been the frequency of similar coin\ncidences, which possibly might be accounted for on the theory of some\nco-ordination of my nervous system with that of the other person concerned.\nIt is also worth adding, that I generally seem to be the recipient and not the\nsender of any such intelligence, and that I appear to be in that receptive\ncondition only at times when my nerves are a little overwrought. These\ncurious experiences generally occur in groups, and are simultaneous with the\nclose of a period of excessive mental activity. A very singular one occurred\nlast January, when I went to D with my wife for a few days' quiet. While\nthere, I remembered that E was in the neighbourhood, where I had a\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1898.\ncousin residing, a brother of a distinguished artist, and that he had written\nto me some time before about a picture of his brother's, which he wanted\nto sell. I at once resolved to ride over next morning. Upon inquiry\nfrom the manager of the hotel, I learnt that the road was bad, the weather\nunpromising, other directions more interesting. But I stuck to my purpose\nand went, though the road was atrocious, and, within three or four miles of\nmy goal, I was so dead beat that I almost turned back.\nHowever, I reasoned with myself, that I might perhaps never have the\nchance of seeing my cousin again, and that I might even find him in some\ngreat need of my help. 1 continued my journey, found out his cottage, and\nknocked at the door. He opened it himself and said without showing any\nsurprise at my appearance :\u2014 \"It's very good of you to come so promptly,\nbut I didn't expect you to-day.\" \"Why did you expect me at all? \" I\nsaid. \"Haven't you got my letter?\" he replied, \"I wrote to you last\nnight.\" \" To W ? \" I said. \"Yes,\" he answered. \" But I'm staying at D\nand have had no letter,\" I said. He then took me in, and, to make a long\nstory short, I found him in very great distress, and my coming on the scene\nreally proved a sort of lifebuoy to a drowning man.\nI will conclude this section with one instance in which I seem to have\nbeen the active element of communication. It was of great moment to\nher interests, that I should see a young girl on a particular day during the\nChristmas holidays. To her, great issues depended on the interview. I\nknew her exceedingly well. I wrote to her begging her to see me at 4.30\np.m. precisely, laying great emphasis on the hour. Coming from another\npart of the house, I found her knocking at my study door exactly at\n4.30 p.m. I commented upon her extraordinary punctuality, when I\nfound, that she had never received my card, that her call was quite\nunpremeditated, and that the encounter was a pure accident.\nNow I come to the third generation, in the case of my daughter, who also\nhas experiences, which may or may not be due to heredity, but, if they are,\nshow distinct signs of degeneracy.\nShe received a great shock one day, when about sixteen years of age,\nby walking into her bedroom and seeing one of her schoolfellows there,\nwho, in a few seconds, disappeared. This phenomenon began to occur so\nfrequently, that she grew quite used to it, and came to the conclusion that it\nwas in some way due to the condition of her eyes.\nA feature of the phenomenon was, that she only saw the phantasmal\nfigures down to the waist. The lower part of the body was never visible,\nthough she only noticed this when familiarity had removed fear. The most\nextraordinary vision was one she had on coming down the road where we\nlive, when a hearse and long mourning cortege was drawn up in front of\nour house. She speculated for whom it was intended, until, all in a\nmoment, the mirage vanished. This is some years ago, and I am glad to\nsay we have, as yet, had no death in the house. Nor, indeed, does there\nseem to have been at any time any connection between her spectral\nexperiences and after events.\n\fJuly, 1898.] Correspondence. 269\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Correspondents.]\n\"Faces in the Dark.\"\n(To the Editor of the Journal op the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSt. Louis, April, 1898.\nI am glad you have opened the subject of seeing faces in the dark. This\nis a capacity which I have cultivated to a limited extent and believe it to be\na normal condition, meaning that one has attained, while awake, the concen\ntration which exists during dreaming. That this condition sometimes\nappears during illness, is not necessarily proof that it is of itself objection\nable. Concentration is the most needed of all powers to-day, and anything\nwhich cultivates it is, to that extent, valuable.\nI began this cultivation several years ago, by forcing myself, when in the\ndark, to see the letters of the alphabet, one by one\u2014a gold thread on a\nblack ground. Faces do not come so easily when I am willing them, and\nvanish quickly. Sometimes, however, they come spontaneously, and are\nthen life size, and very close to my eyes.\nFrequently entire figures will appear in a landscape, and remain several\nminutes, moving about in a most natural way. The most frequent experience\noccurs just after waking from a short sleep, when I have remembered not to\nopen my eyes. In a brilliant yellow light will appear the most beautiful\ndecorative patterns, finials, curves, spirals, leaves, blossoms, but all black.\nThis interests me particularly, because for several generations back in my\nfamily, decorative engraving has been practised, and this would seem to be\na result. The drawing of such designs comes as naturally to me as writing.\nSometimes in this yellow light, there will also be figures, or pages of printing\nand names. If, however, I attempt to catch an idea of the printed matter,\nit immediately changes to something else, which seems to indicate that it is\nautomatic nerve action, such as occurs in sleep.\nMy brother, who is a teacher of long standing, is frequently able to\nrecall a forgotten name of town or river by closing his eyes, and recalling\nthe picture of the map containing it ; the name then appears in its proper\nplace. His son has the same power. This would indicate, I think, that this\ncapacity is a natural development worthy of attention, as revealing a kind\nof progress which may be in store for humanity.\u2014Sincerely,\nMrs. 0. H. Stone.\n76, Mount Vernon Street, Boston, May Itith, 1898.\nMy dear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014 ... I was very much interested to\nread in the December Journal a letter from Mr. Aug. Glardon concerning\n\"Faces in the Dark.\" I have for a very long time found much interest\nand amusement in observing faces and scenes which suddenly present them\nselves in the dark, upon (it seems to me) the inner surface of my eyelids,\nwhen I am awake.\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1898.\nThese visions\u2014if I may call them so\u2014are quite independent of my will ;\nindeed, I am unable to call them up when I wish to. They come and go,\napparently as if following some law of their own. My experience is identical\nwith that of Mr. Glardon in that the faces which I see are always those of\npersons unknown to me ; the scenes are unfamiliar, but commonplace, and\nmight easily have been seen and forgotten. The peculiarity of both faces\nand scenes, is their clearness, and solidity, if I may so express it ; in this\nthey are strikingly different from any deliberate visualisation.\nThis clearness is, at times, so remarkable that I have been startled ; I\nhave the impression that what I am seeing with my eyes shut must be\nbefore me.\nThere are two things which I think characterise almost all these visions ;\nfirst, that there is some movement about them ; and, secondly, that I very\noften see only part of a thing\u2014two fingers of a hand, half of a face, an\nopening door, with a foot moving across the threshold.\nWhen I deliberately visualise (which I cannot do very easily) or when I\nsimply remember, the thing which I see in my mind's eye is motionless, and\n. I see all of it. I visualise a person, for instance, in some action, but it is\nalways as if they had been caught by a camera, and one particular second of\nthe action presented to me ; whereas, in these scenes upon my closed eyelids,\nthere is always motion, and always the feeling of life about them. I am afraid\nI am expressing this very awkwardly, but I scarcely know how to put it.\nWill you tell me whether this habit of seeing faces with one's eyes closed\nis some peculiar form of memory ? I should have concluded that it was\nexcept that I have never seen anything which was familiar to me. Only\nonce have I seen anything of striking interest, and as I had no means of\nknowing whether it ever took place, it has no importance. . . . Very\nsincerely yours,\nMargaret Deland.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nDetroit, Mich., June 3rd, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014The correspondence in No. 148 of the Journal from Mr. A.\nLang in regard to crystal-gazing, recalls a recent experience which may have\nsome bearing on the phenomena. I had been confined to bed for three days\nwith a mild type of fever. On the fourth day, following a night of profuse\nperspiration, which marked the beginning of convalescence or the \" crisis,\"\nI noticed that although apparently in a normal condition, on closing my\neyes there would instantly flash into view visions of remarkable variety in\ncolour, scenery, and movement. Scene succeeded scene with great rapidity.\nSeemingly with every movement of the eyeballs a new scene appeared.\nThese hallucinations continued for about two days while my temperature\nwas lowering to near normal, gradually becoming fainter and less frequent.\nThe pictures embraced an inconceivable variety of scenes, but were in\ngeneral so fleeting that the impression made by them was gradually effaced,\nand I can now recall only a few of the more striking ones. Many of them\ncontained persons engaged in different actions. Sometimes they would\n\fJuly, 1898.] Correspondence. 271\nappear close enough and present a front view of the face so that their\nfeatures could have been recognised. There was nothing hazy or indistinct\nabout the images. All were sharply denned as in dream pictures, and in\nincessant motion in a majority of cases. Colours especially were exhibited\nn endless variety. I remember one in which I seemed to be in front of a\nlarge structure, and my attention was arrested by the sight of a man in\nmilitary clothes and having the appearance of an officer of high rank sitting\nat an upper story window and looking out so as to present a profile to my\nview. I did not seem to be aware of his presence until, as if by oblique\nvision, as I was not looking directly at him, I saw him turn his head slowly\naround, presenting a nearly full front view of his face, but before I could look\ndirectly at him his head turned slowly around again and I saw only a profile\nview, which in a very short time faded entirely from my sight. This des\ncription is, I believe, accurate ; being one of the first, it made a lasting\nimpression. In another scene I seemed to be in a box at a theatre watching\na play in progress. This vision lasted perhaps a minute or more. Another\nscene represented a street scene in winter, the ground covered with snow, a\nstreet car with men standing on the rear platform in heavy ulsters, the\nconductor assisting a lady to alight, pedestrians passing back and forth.\nMany pictures of places apparently in foreign countries, oriental and tropical\nlands. I cannot say that I recognised any of the pictures or persons,\nalthough it is possible they may have been latent in my memory based on\npictures in books seen long ago. A common experience was that of seeing\nseveral persons and watching first one and then another, wondering what\nthat one would do next and feeling vexed at not being able to take in all\nthat was going on before my eyes. I can think of nothing which compares\nso well with this particular experience as the feeling one has in attending a\nthree ring circus and trying to see everything.\nThe condition of the brain producing these visions seemed to bear a\ndefinite relation to the course of the fever. They appeared concomitant\nwith certain well-defined symptoms and dissipated with the return to a\nnormal condition. I have never seen these visions at any other time in my\nlife. I was in full possession of my faculties and remarked to my nurse and\ndoctor on the strangeness of the visions. The next day after the subsidence\nof the visions I was able to leave my bed and walk about. These visions\nwere probably entirely similar to those seen by aid of a crystal ; I believe\nthat the latter are observed to better advantage on closing the eyes in a dark\nroom after gazing at the crystal for some time. I was in a company recently\nwhere this was done and many of them declared that they saw pictures.\nThe faculty can probably be developed with practice, although to some it is\nentirely normal, and they are able to see at all times scenes similar to those\nI observed in an abnormal condition. Certain drugs have, it is well-known,\nthe property of producing these hallucinations. The whole subject with its\nallied phenomena is of the highest import in connection with the study of\nthe workings of the secondary consciousness. \u2014Yours truly,\nH. W.

[July, 1898.\nThe Knockings at Long Wittenham.\n23, Crafts Avenue, Northampton, Mass., May Kith, 1898.\nDear Dr. Hodgson, \u2014May not the mysterious knockings and rappings\nreported in the May Journal have been simply the effect of sympathetic\nvibrations due to sound waves ? I venture the suggestion because this spring\nthe windows in my house have repeatedly rattled in a way to produce the\nimpression of rappings, or, when the sound is fainter, tappings, and there is\nno doubt that the movements are caused by the fall of water over a dam a\nhundred yards or so away. The water in falling makes very distinct\n\"beats.\" All the houses in the neighbourhood and none, so far as I can\nascertain, in other parts of the town, are affected in the same way. The\nsounds start and stop in the most unaccountable fashion, depending,\napparently, on the coincidence of a number of conditions. I have got quite\nused to them now, being well aware of their source ; but when I first heard\nthem, they seemed to be just as though some one were knocking on the\nwindow-pane or on the wood-work. Is it not just possible that at Long\nWittenham, on the night referred to, when the bells were ringing from a\nnumber of steeples and when, perhaps, the distant trains and signals at\nDidcot were further disturbing the air, similar conditions were temporarily\nestablished, producing a similar succession of ' ' beats \" and a similar\nsympathetic shaking of windows, shutters and doors ? The query suggests,\nat least, that there may be other explanations of the phenomenon besides\nowls, bats, or kicking horses and that there are other alternatives besides\npractical jokes or ghosts.\u2014Yours very truly,\nH. Norman Gardiner.\nThe Consciousness op Dying.\n{To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\n3, St. Albans Road, Kensington, W., June 3rd, 1898.\nDear Sir, \u2014I have read Mr. Hyslop's letter in the June number of the\nJournal, and can give an instance of consciousness of dying in the case of a\nfriend of mine, a Miss E. Y. S., who died of cancer some two years ago.\nI was with her nearly every day for some time before her death, and on\nthe occasion of my last visit did not expect to find her alive, and she seemed\nspeechless and comatose when I went in, and the nurse said she \" was\nalmost gone.\" However, she lived for an hour after my entrance, and\nsuddenly, half an hour before her death, she, with a great effort, raised her\nhand to her lips and kissed it and waved to me ; then later, three minutes\nbefore death, she signed to the nurse to raise her in bed, and to our amaze\nment, ejaculated \"Go \" to me\u2014she did not wish me to see her die, fearing\nmy distress. I could see that her mind was perfectly clear, and that she\nwas quite conscious of the approach of death. After this supreme effort\nshe drew a few gentle breaths and was gone. \u2014Yours sincerely,\nJessie Hall.\n\fJuly, 1898.] Correspondence. 273\nTour de Peilz, June oth, 1898.\nDear Sir, \u2014It seems to me that Prof. Hyslop's problem on the conscious\nness of dying is one of those that cannot be solved except by people who may\nhappen to be behind the scene\u2014in another world. It implies a contradic\ntion which is perhaps only apparent ; who can tell ? but which effectually\nputs a stop to inquiry. If Professor Hyslop had spoken only of the con\nsciousness of being on the point of dying, on the verge of death, that is,\nabout to lose consciousness, I could afford a testimony or two on the fact that\nsome people are conscious of being close to the loss of consciousness.\nA friend of mine, a medical man, died a few years ago of a disease of\nthe heart. During his last moments, his family being around his bed, he\nkept his finger on his pulse, saying that in five minutes, in three, in two,\nhis heart would cease to move. About a minute afterwards he fainted, and\nhis breath stopped at the end of the two minutes given by him as the\nlast ones.\nI can give another perhaps more striking illustration of persistence to\nthe last of the cerebral faculties. An uncle of mine, near eighty years of\nage, had been descending the hill of life gently for some months without\nbeing perceptibly ill. One evening, he was smoking his last pipe in his\nstudy, near the fire, sitting in his armchair. His wife was on a sofa close\nby ; his son, named Ernest, in a room at the other end of the passage.\nAfter having finished his pipe, my uncle knocked the ashes on the grate, put\nhis pipe down on the chimney-piece, and told my aunt that he was feeling\nfaint. At the same moment he felt his own pulse and exclaimed : \" Hallo !\nmy heart is stopping. Go and fetch Ernest ; the end has come.\" My aunt\nopened the door and shouted to her son. As he came into the room,\nhardly one minute having elapsed, my uncle peacefully closed his eyes and\nwent to sleep the sleep of which there is no waking.\nThis, of course, does not prove that man survives after the dissolution of\nhis body ; still I think it is rather striking, as showing the possibility in\ncertain cases of keeping one's cerebral powers and one's consciousness\nunimpaired up to the very moment of death.\nFarther on we cannot go, and just as a candle sometimes gives a last and\nbrighter flash at the moment of dying out, it is possible in a materialistic\npoint of view to explain the phenomenon alluded to as being the last\nmanifestation of a chemical or physiological process in a dying brain. I do\nnot, of course, believe it to be the case ; but I deem that every effort to\nprove anything about the persistence of consciousness in and through\ndeath would be unavailing. I believe in life after death, but without any\nsensible or logical demonstration ; and I do not see how it could ever be\notherwise. . . .\nAug. Glardon.\nSpiritualism and Spirit Identity.\nWimbledon, May 21st, 1898.\nSir, \u2014I have followed with interest the discussion on Spirits and ask to\nbe allowed to make a few remarks on the subject.\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [July, 1898.\nThe tornado picture is good so far as it goes and Mr. Bennett is justified\nin discriminating the whirlwind (spirit) from the dust (body), and in asking\nus to conceive the whirlwind as pursuing its wild career after leaving the\nbelt of desert from which it drew its embodiment. The simile can be pushed\na little further. If the wind may exist after dropping the dust it may have\nexisted before raising the dust, which brings us face to face with the doctrine\nof Pre-existence.\nI do not share the objection to such pictures on the ground of their\n\"gross materialism.\" This means no more than that they are graphically\nphysical or phenomenal, which is just what a picture ought to be. All our\nconceptions, even the most noumenal, have to be constructed in phenomenal\nimagery. A concrete picture may embody a law which can easily be\nabstracted from the irrelevant details. The word \" law \" itself is a case in\npoint ; we speak of natural laws without supposing they are issued by any\nthing like a political government.\nMay I propose another picture on the relation of mind and body 1 It\nhas haunted me for years and may assist speculation.\nThe mind (the seat of consciousness and energy) is not in the body but\nworks it from a distance, as a commercial firm or joint-stock company\ndomiciled in London may work for its account a machinery plant in Lanca\nshire or South Africa. The medium of communication is generally invisible,\nbut something that may be this medium is said to be seen by clairvoyants.\nCompanies and their machinery, we know, are much more apparent than\nthe letters and telegrams by which the one directs the other.\nPhysiologists and others assert that the mind is in the brain, but they\nhave not found it there, and all the facts they adduce are equally consistent\nwith the other hypothesis.\nSpirit is not mind., but an intermediate or alternative body. In our\nparable it is the local staff at Johannesburg, and while the works are in\naction the members of the staff are distributed about and among the works\nand are indistinguishable from them. That is why we do not see the spirit\nof a living man ; it is distributed through his nervous system.\nBut let the works break down, or wear out, and then the local staff\nseparates from them, and can exist and be seen as an independent entity.\nSo spirits may exist and be seen after death.\nThe company survives though its works perish and its staff may be\nscattered : that is the perpetuation of an individual in spite of death and the\ndissolution of the spirit.\nThe same company may outlast several sets of machinery\u2014an observation\nthat accords with the theory of re-incarnation.\nThe company may abandon its work in Africa and start a fresh enterprise\nin Australia with new machinery ; that is the transfer of a being from one\nsphere or world to another.\nObserve the conception our picture offers of \"spirit control.\" A company\ndomiciled in Berlin has some workmen at Johannesburg but no machinery.\nThese men attack the British staff, overcome them, seize the works, and cut\noff communication with London. The works now act in a German instead\n\fJoly, 1898.] Correspondence. 275\nof a British manner. That is the case of a body passing under the control of\nanother spirit and mind.\nMembers of the S.P.R. are familiar with the idea of multiple personality.\nIt is a truth. A mind, like a company, consists of many egos, and now one\nand then another group of them get the upper hand. These correspond to\nthe successive boards of direction in whom is invested the authority of a\ncompany.\nAnyone familiar with the facts and alleged facts of psychology can work\nout the analogies for himself. The imagery requires a good deal of trimming\nto bring it into philosophical shape, and it has to be elaborated in conjunction\nwith a correct theory of Perception, not the common Natural Realism. \u2014I\nam Sir, yours faithfully,\nD. B. McLachlan.\nI suppose that Mr. Lane Fox's letter in the June Journal craves for some\nreply, though this must not take the form of a rambling discussion of half-\nrevealed metaphysical dogmas. Obviously the Journal is not the place for\nmatters of the sort, and it will be my object to recall the discussion to the\npoint from which it has strayed. The point was whether, when we find\n' spirit ' communications of a personal type, we are justified in inferring\nfrom them the persistence of personality through what we call 'death.'\nThis method of interpretation is asserted by the spiritualists, and has\nrecently been (provisionally, at least) endorsed by the great authority of Dr.\nHodgson ; Mr. Lane Fox chose to make this a peg whereon to hang sundry\nreflections of his own tending to exhibit his superiority to the low-minded\nand grovelling superstitions of the spiritualists. I ventured to point out\nto him that he was not entitled to take up this attitude, and I ought, I\nsuppose, to be satisfied with having succeeded in inducing him now to\nrepresent himself as \" humbly urging \" his views. That is certainly not what\nhe did at first.\nI also felt that Mr. Lane Fox had from the first lost sight of the main\npoint (which alone would have made his discussion relevant and profitable)\nas to whether the personality of the ' spirits ' was sufficiently similar to that\nof the living to justify us in treating them as continuations of the latter ;\nbut I hardly expected him to admit this so naively and to defend himself by\nsaying that he \" had merely failed to discover its importance.\" Just so\u2014he\nhas missed the point. For if that is not the important point for the psychical\nresearcher, what is 1 Surely not Mr. Lane Fox's metaphysical doctrines, his\nconviction that persons are egotistical, and that selves must be \" absolutely\nseparate. \" What we want is a working theory, and Mr. Lane Fox's theories\nare certainly not scientific, whatever their ethical and metaphysical character.\nThe truth is that Mr. Lane Fox does not regard the question of ' spirit\nidentity' from the standpoint of a psychical researcher. He has simply\nmade a pretext of the poor ' spirits ' in order to vent his spite on certain\nmetaphysical views which are obnoxious to him, but have no special relation\nto the evidence for 'spirit identity.' He dislikes the notion of a \"perma\nnent self or ego \" (so far as he understands it) ; he analyses himself into\n\"a transitory polarisation of feelings, tastes and desires,\" and supposes that\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jdly, 1898.\nhe thereby betters himself and changes the facts. If he really feels the\nbetter for it, and finds himself able to explain the facts of his mental con\nstitution in this way (including those which, like his own identity, he\nappeared to overlook), so be it. It pleases him, and will not hurt others.\nBut he ought to recognise that his quarrel is not with the dead, but with\nthe living, that the personality he contests is that of the latter. And\nit strikes me as ungenerous to deprive the apevqva Kaprjva of the\ndefenceless dead of their personality merely because you want to attack\nthat of the living !\nI pass to a few comments on Mr. Massey's letter. His views appear to\ndiffer very radically from Mr. Lane Fox's, although he also seems more\ndisposed to discuss the bearing of the conception of 'spirit identity' on\nhis metaphysics than to examine its usefulness as a method of investigation.\nMr. Massey can conceive the empirical personality as surviving 'death,' but\nnot as maintaining itself in its post mortem, existence. This difficulty is\nboth odd and old (it is propounded, e.g., by Cebes in Plato's Phwdo 88 A),\nand to my mind the answer to it is simple. If personality is tough enough\nto survive death it must be credited with the power to persist in its new phase\nof existence. At all events it would seem ludicrously premature to dogmatise\nupon the subject. I will confess, too, that M. D'Assier's interpretation of\nthe facts seems to me to combine almost every incongruity and absurdity.\nBut, again, Mr. Massey is free to believe as he pleases, and I would only\ndraw his attention to the very different way in which Dr. Hodgson inter\nprets the peculiarities in \"spirit communications\" which led to D'Assier's\ntheory.\nAnd, not to speak of ethics, I must say I much prefer Dr. Hodgson's\ninterpretation, both on physical and on psychological grounds. That spirit\ncommunication should be difficult is what I should have inferred on physical\ngrounds, that it should be rare and exhibit a gradual diminution of interest\nin and memory of our concerns is precisely what I should have inferred on\nthe supposition that the human personality takes its known psychological\nconstitution with it. The wonder is rather that the deceased should trouble\nthemselves at all about us and have leisure to devise means of communica\ntion with the world they have left. For if we are to conceive them as surviv\ning death at all, it must be as ipso facto entering into a new and engrossing\nphase of existence (all the more engrossing because of its novelty) and as\nneeding to adapt themselves to new conditions of existence. And it is\nnot unreasonable to suppose that even if they could effectively desire to\ncommunicate they might not find the means available. Hence there need be\nno trace of cynicism in the suggestion that probably the dead forget the\nliving far more rapidly even than the living forget the dead : it merely\n-expresses a psychological necessity. We forget because life absorbs our\nenergies and robs us of the leisure to remember : the departed, if they\nsurvive, must forget, because a new life must absorb their energies and cut\noff their associations with the past to an indefinitely greater degree. Is\nthere not, therefore, more than a touch of human conceit in the imagination\nwhich depicts the spirits of the dead as having no other function than to\n\fJuly, 1898.] Cases. 277\nhover invisibly around the living as futile spectators of the follies and the\ncrimes of earth ? Nay, will not the notion appear grotesque as soon as we\ntake up a less geocentric position in our eschatology and look at the matter\nfrom the point of view of the ' dead ' 1\nOn the whole then, the scantiness and scrappiness of the alleged spirit\ncommunications should not as yet provoke remonstrance, but rather gratitude.\nPossibly, too, we might have less reason to complain that ' ' no traveller\nreturns,\" or that if he does, he brings no travellers' tales to rejoice our ears,\nif the accommodation we offered to such travellers were a little better. No\ndoubt a few spiritualists and psychical researchers do their best to recall\nspirits from the vasty deep wherein they may be conceived to disport them\nselves, but could they conscientiously recommend the facilities they offer\nto a departed friend as either interesting or edifying for him ? And how\nmany have even an open mind upon such questions ? The human mind is a\nmost inhospitable thing and not at all disposed to entertain novelties ; even\nangels have to slip in unawares. How much more so in this case when such\nmessengers from another sphere would have to force their way through the\nbarriers created by our ordinary modes of life and thought, would have to\novercome the inner loathing with which, I am convinced, the vast majority\nof men regard (and always have regarded) anything that could obtrude\nupon them an effective recognition of a wider environment to which they\nwould need to readjust their actions. This loathing everybody who has\npenetrated to men's real beliefs must have encountered, and it is psycho\nlogically quite intelligible. My excuse for dwelling at such length upon\nsuch very hypothetical considerations must be that though I am well aware\nthat the facts alone can ratify our theories, we yet need a good supply of\nnot uncriticised theories to guide us in analysing the ' facts.

De Wolf, went to his residence in 6, Grenville-place, Cromwell-road,\nwhere I could be under his immediate care. For two days I was confined to\nmy bed, and about five o'clock in the afternoon of the third day, feeling\nsomewhat better, I partially dressed myself, slipped on a heavy bath robe,\nand went down to the sitting room on the main floor, where my friend, the\ndoctor, usually spent a part of the afternoon in reading. A steamer chair\nwas placed before the fire by one of the servants, and I was made comfort\nable with pillows. The doctor was present, and sat immediately behind me\nreading. I dropped off into a light doze, and slept for perhaps thirty minutes.\nSuddenly I became conscious of the fact that I was about to awaken ; I was\nin a condition where I was neither awake nor asleep. I realised fully that\nI had been asleep, and I was equally conscious of the fact that I was not\nwide awake, While in this peculiar mental condition I suddenly said to\nmyself: \"Wait a minute. Here is a message for the doctor.\" At the\n\fJuly, 1898.] Cases. 279\nmoment I fancied that I had upon my lap a pad of paper, and I thought I\nwrote upon this pad with a pencil the following words : \u2014\n\"Dear Doctor : Do you remember Katy McGuire, who used to live with\nyou in Chester 1 She died in 1872. She hopes you are having a good time\nin London.\"\nInstantly thereafter I found myself wide awake, felt no surprise at not\nfinding the pad of paper on my knee, because I then realised that that was\nbut the hallucination of a dream, but impressed with that feature of my\nthought which related to the message, I partly turned my head, and, speaking\nover my shoulder to the doctor, said : \"Doctor, I have a message for you.\"\nThe doctor looked up from the British Medical Journal which he was\nreading, and said : \" What's that 1 \"\n\" I have a message for you,\" I repeated. \" It is this : ' Dear Doctor : Do\nyou remember Katy McGuire who used to live with you in Chester ? She\ndied in 1872. She hopes you are having a good time in London. ' \"\nThe doctor looked at me with amazement written all over his face, and\nsaid : \"Why, what the devil do you mean 1 \"\n\" I don't know anything about it except that just before I woke up I\nwas impelled to receive this message which I have just delivered to you.\"\n\" Did you ever hear of Katy McGuire ? \" asked the doctor.\n\" Never in my life.\"\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, \"That's one of the most remarkable things\nI ever heard of. My father for a great many years lived at Chester, Mass.\nThere was a neighbouring family named McGuire, and Katy McGuire,\na daughter of this neighbour, frequently came over to our house, as the\nyounger people in a country village will visit their neighbours, and used to\nassist my mother in the lighter duties about the house. I was absent from\nChester from about 1869 to about 1873. I had known Katy, however, as a\ndaughter of our neighbour and knew that she used to visit the house. She\ndied sometime during the absence I speak of, but as to the exact date of her\ndeath I am not informed.\"\nThat closed the incident, and although the doctor told me that he would\nwrite to his old home to ascertain the exact date of Katy's death, I have\nnever heard from him further in the matter. I questioned him at the\ntime as to whether he had recently thought of Katy McGuire, and he\ntold me that her name had not occurred to him for twenty years, and that\nhe might never have recalled it had it not been for the rather curious\nincident which had occurred. In my own mind I could only explain the\noccurrence as a rather unusual coincidence. I was personally aware of the\nfact that the doctor's old home had been in Chester, Mass., and had\nfrequently talked with him of his earlier experiences in life when he began\npractice in that city, but never at any time during these conversations had\nthe name of this neighbour's daughter been mentioned, nor had the name of\nthe neighbour been mentioned, our conversation relating entirely to the\nimmediate members of the family, particularly the doctor's father, who was\na noted practitioner in that district.\nJohn E.

My father practised his profession of medicine, in Chester, Mass.,\nfor sixty years\u2014dying in 1890.

In 1861 I\nreturned to America and immediately entered the Army as surgeon and\nserved until the close of the war in 1865. In 1866 I located in Northampton,\nMass., where I practised my profession until 1873, when I removed to\nChicago.\nChester is a hill town in Western Mass., and Northampton is seventeen\nmiles distant.

There is nothing left of my family in Chester.

Alexander.\nThe London paper Light, of March 21st, 1896, published under\nthe heading \" Spirit Identity,\" the subjoined translation from the\nRevue Spirite. It is a letter from San Paulo, in Brazil, containing\nthe account of a hypnotic experiment which was attended with\nremarkable results.\nDr. O. Vidigal resides at No. 2, Allies du Triomphe, with his family,\ncomprising his wife, two children, and his aged father. His mother died\nthree months ago. Requiring a young domestic, he went to the emigration\ndepot, and arranged to take a Spanish girl about twelve years of age, who\nhad just arrived that day, and who did not know a word of Portuguese, and,\nof course, she did not know her employer.\nThe girl had lost her father, and on the evening of her arrival at Dr.\nVidigal's the latter had a visitor, Mons. Edouard Silva, a native of Gibraltar,\nwho could speak Spanish. This gentleman, having asked for a glass of\nwater, the little girl brought it to him, and he, being a good magnetiser,\nasked her\u2014by an inexplicable intuition, it is said\u2014if she would consent to\nbe magnetised. She agreed, and in a few moments she was put into a\ntrance of a marked character.\nSuddenly raising her eyes and looking into the air, she said in agitated\nfashion that she saw extremely beautiful things and asked that they might\nnot be removed from her gaze. After a few minutes of silent contemplation\nshe told them that she saw her father and that he spoke to her. Making\nwith her hand a kind of ear-trumpet, she listened an instant and said that\nher father told her an old lady, whom she also saw, had a request to make to\nDr. Vidigal. She described this old lady very minutely, and the whole\nfamily recognised the description as that of the doctor's deceased mother.\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1898.\nThen the spirit of this lady \u2014still through the little medium \u2014enjoined her\nson to open the room which she formerly occupied, and which had been\nclosed for the three months that had elapsed since her decease ; to take\ndown a black silk dress hanging there on the wall, and he would find in a\npocket, entirely sewed up, the sum of seventy-five thousand rees, which was\nto be handed to her husband. (There is a ring of wealth about this amount\nwhich is deceptive to those unacquainted with the value of a ree ; a thousand\nrees\u2014a milree\u2014used to be worth 5s. 7Ad., which would yield a total slightly\nin excess of twenty guineas. It appears to have fallen greatly in value, but\nit does seem a little rough on the old lady to reduce the grand total to the\nslender sum the amount now represents.)*\nThose who were present when the girl made the revelation could hardly\nbring themselves to give it serious attention, but when the members of the\nfamily considered that she had been with them barely a day, and only two\ndays in Brazil altogether, and, further, that she could not possibly have\nknown what she announced to them, they resolved to verify on the spot the\naccuracy of the communication. They went to the room, accompanied by\nMons. Silva and three neighbours, who from curiosity wished to witness the\nresult. Dr. Vidigal had considerable difficulty in opening the door, the lock\nhaving become rusty, but when they got in they found the black dress\nhanging from the wall as indicated, and in one of the pockets, which was\nwholly sewn up, they found the exact sum of money named. The writer of\nthe account is Mr. Manfred Meyer.\nAt Dr. Richard Hodgson's request inquiries have been made into\nthe particulars of this case. For the investigator, who can rarely\nabsent himself from Rio, it was possible to undertake the long journey\nto San Paulo only at certain seasons of the year. Some of the\npersons who testify to the above account had moved to other places of\nresidence. Hence delays were occasioned in obtaining the evidence\nwhich is here presented. In June, 1896, four of the principal\nwitnesses were interviewed : Dr. Orencio Vidigal, his wife Dona Julia,\nMr. Edward Silva, and his daughter Amalia. In January, 1897,\nDona Maria Freitas, the doctor's mother-in-law, who was also present\nat the hypnotic experiment, was visited at her hacienda near Bacae-\ntava. In the latter year, another witness, Dr. Theodomiro Telles, who\nhad been absent in the north of Brazil, returned to San Paulo.\nThrough the intermedium of a third person, certain written questions\nwere submitted to him ; but to these he refused to reply, saying rather\nirrelevantly that as a doctor and a sensible man he could not believe\nin Spiritism. In view of his remark it seemed possible that he might\n* The Brazilian milreis\u2014nobody says \"a thousand rees \"\u2014is equal to 27d. at par.\nIn 1898, at the date of the old lady's death, it had fallen to 12d. and it fell still lower\nin the ensuing months so that 75 milreis would then have been less than \u00a33 15s.\nThe singular of \"reis\" is \" real,\" not \"ree.\"\n\fOct., 1898.] A Case of \"Spirit\" Identity. 283\nhave something to adduce that would lessen, or destroy, the impor\ntance of the evidence already collected. Such, however, was not the\ncase. A personal interview with him in February, 1898, elicited very\nlittle in favour of, and nothing against, the credibility of the state\nments made by the other deponents.\nThe proof of \" spirit \" identity obtained at Dr. Vidigal's house\ncame about the month of September, 1893. Before proper inquiries\nwere made into the occurrence, nearly three years had passed away\u2014\na lapse of time that has sensibly affected the memory of some of the\ninformants. Taken collectively, however, their testimony, so far as it\ngoes, may be regarded as quite reliable. The essential part of Senr.\nManfredo Meyer's narrative stands confirmed, but the details presented\nby him are shown to be very inaccurate. He gives a false impression\nthat the case was recent at the time of its publication. In September,\n1893, Dr. Vidigal had only one child, and his father was not then\nresiding with him. The evidence tends to prove that the Spanish girl\nhad been some days at the emigration depot before she was hired, and\nit is not at all certain that Mr. Silva's visit coincided with the evening\nof her arrival. Some stress is laid on the fact that the girl did not\nknow the language of her new country ; but it must be recollected\nthat Spanish and Portuguese are so very similar that a knowledge of\none of these languages will soon enable a person to seize the drift of\nwhat is said in the other. The \" magnetic \" experiment was made to\nsatisfy the curiosity of one of the ladies and was not led up to by any\n\" inexplicable intuition.\" The dress referred to by the somnambule\nwas of light-coloured cotton and not of black silk ; it was found\nhanging on the inside of the door and not on the wall of the room\noccupied by the deceased person. After the message had been\nreceived, this apartment was entered by Donas Julia and Amalia, and\nneither Mr. Silva nor Dr. Vidigal accompanied them on this occasion.\nIt will also be seen that the doctor himself was quite aware that his\nmother was accustomed to keep money sewn up in the pocket of her\ndresses. The defects of the published narrative are those of an\naccount received at second hand. The narrator, Senr. Manfredo\nMeyer, is a gentleman of good position and repute in San Paulo\u2014 one\nwho would not voluntarily make any statement that he considered\nincorrect. Before sending his letter to the Revue Spirite, he showed\nit to Dr. Vidigal, and obtained his consent to publication.\nAs a first step towards obtaining more definite information\nrespecting the alleged occurrence, a list of questions was sent, on the\n15th of May, 1896, to Dr. Vidigal, and with this was included a\ntranslation of the letter as it appeared in Light. These inquiries met\n\f284 Journal, of Society for Pxychicai Research. [Oct., is'.is.\nwith courteous attention on his part, the answers sent by him being\nas follows : \u2014\n1. What is the name of the little somnambule ?\nFrancisca.\n2. Was it the first time that she was hypnotised ?\nYes.\n3. Had she any recollection of the occurrence after she had been awaked?\nShe was entranced twice. The first time she had no recollection of the\nfacts ; the second time, however, we awoke her with a full memory [of all\nthat had occurred].\n4. What is her character in the normal state ?\nGood. [She is] of sanguine temperament. Her trance is characterised\nby pallor.\n5. Could the magnetiser have had any previous knowledge of the\nparticulars given by the somnambule ? Would he not have been aware, for\ninstance, of the appearance of the deceased lady ?\n[He could have had] none, for we became acquainted only after her\ndecease.\n6. Is the narrative transcribed in the inclosed translation exact in all\npoints ?\n[To this I reply] affirmatively : it could not be more exact, for we\nobserved [the facts of] the narrative personally, my family being present.*\n7. What were the particulars given by the girl in her description of the\ndeceased lady ?\n[With regard to] the symptoms shown by the somnambule, her eyes were\nlit with pleasure, she being in the presence of wonderful things ; and it was\nobserved that she sometimes laughed at and applauded [them], asking that\nthey might be repeated. She often heard badly and placed her right hand\nagainst the external ear in order to listen to greater advantage. It was\nremarked that she showed signs of gladness, and of [having entered into]\nsome kind of communication.\n8. Is it not very probable that some of the persons of the household\nknew that the black dress was hanging on the wall in the room of the\ndeceased lady ?\nWe do not know the reason why the wearing apparel remained in the\nroom .\n9. Is it not possible that some one knew that that lady carried about\nwith her money sewn up in one of her pockets 1\n[To this I reply] negatively. [Neither I], nor any other person of the\nfamily, [knew of it].\n10. Would you not even know the exact sum which she was accustomed\nto keep in this manner ?\nNo.\n11. What motive had the deceased for thus sewing up her money in her\ndress 1\n* This is probably the meaning of this loosely -worded answer.\n\fOct., 1808.] A Case of \" Spirit \" Identity. 285\nShe used to keep this money as the product of [her] savings. It was\nemployed in the celebration of masses, as the message given by the girl\nmedium was satisfactory to us.\n12. Was it really on this occasion that the room was entered for the first\ntime after the death ?\nI cannot answer with certainty, for I do not know whether, or not, this\napartment had indeed been entered by stealth (violado).\nDr. Vidigal was further requested to give the date of his mother's\ndeath, and of the visit of Mr. Edward Silva. In reply to this he\ncontinues :\u2014,\nThe decease took place on the 16th of June, 1893, (nearly at midnight).\nDr. E. Silva paid us the visit about three months after the decease.\nNothing more occurring to me respecting a matter of such serious and\nscientific interest, I sign my name to the above in witness of the truth.\n(Signed) Dr. O. Vidigal.\nSan Paulo, 18th of June, 1896.\nIt is very apparent that in replying to these questions Dr. Vidigal\ndid not always apprehend their meaning, which was, however, as clear\nin Portuguese as it is in the above English translation. Nos. 4, 7,\nand 8 are answered at cross-purposes. His replies to 11 and 12 intro\nduced, quite unnecessarily, doubts which were dispelled only by\nsubsequent investigation. His assertions that Senr. Meyer's account\ncould not be more exact, and that he did not know of his mother's\nhabit of sewing her money in her pocket, were surely made without\ndue reflection, or with much mental laxity, for they are not in accord\nance with fact. These answers must be considered jointly with the\nmore trustworthy information elicited from the witness when he was\npersonally interviewed. For the sake of comparison his oral state\nments are arranged, as far as possible, in the same order as his written\nreplies :\u2014\n1. The little servant was called Francisca. She had been at the emigra\ntion depot probably some days before she was engaged by the doctor. Her\nmother, who objected to the seances, withdrew her from the service shortly\nafterwards.\n2. She was hypnotised twice, at an interval of about two days. It was\non the second occasion that neighbours were present.\n3. The girl liked being hypnotised, and asked to be thrown again into\nthe trance in order to speak to her father. (Dr. Vidigal's written answer to\nthe third inquiry is in all probability correct. It seems that, besides the\ntwo stances mentioned, there was some further experimentation with the\ngirl en famille.)\n4. In her normal state the girl was remiss in the execution of her duties\nand needed scolding.\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1898.\n5. The witness became acquainted with Mr. Silva only a short time\nbefore the first seance took place.\n6. He stated that Senr. Meyer called on him to obtain leave to publish\nthe account that appeared in the Revue Spirite, and he seemed to think\nthat that gentleman's narrative of the facts was quite satisfactory.\n7. Francisca in her trance described the old lady whom she professed to\nsee as a tall, thin, pale person with black hair. She went through the action\nof shaking hands with the supposed communicator and declared that the\nhand that grasped hers was a cold one. The old lady was said to be \" in\nglory (na gloria).\" The witness, who was apparently labouring under some\ndiscouragement at the time, expressed a desire to be with his mother ; but,\nthrough the little somnambule, he was reminded that he had yet duties to\nperform towards his family and must, therefore, have patience. The girl\ndeclared there were some things she was not permitted to tell.\n8. With regard to the dress referred to in the narrative, they were not\naware that it was hanging in the room. Francisca did not say that it was of\nblack silk ; she spoke of it as \" the dress behind the door.\"\n9. The witness did not recollect whether the girl described the pocket as\nbeing sewn up ; but he evidently knew that his mother was in the habit of\nsecuring her money in this manner.\n10. The doctor's statements tended to prove that, even supposing it were\nremembered that the dress was in the room, it did not occur to them that\nmoney might remain stitched up in the pocket. A fortiori they could not\nknow the exact amount thus secured. He thought that masses had been\nasked for ; but however that might have been, the money found was spent\nin masses.\n11. Although courageous in other respects, the old lady was in her life\ntime abnormally afraid of thieves. Thus she would tie up her money in\npackets and carry her jewels in a little receptacle fastened to her wrist.\n12. At the time of the experiments with the girl Francisca the only\nmembers of the witness's family who lived in the house were his wife and\nchild. Afterwards, by the advice of the trance personage, his father came\nto reside with him. His wife had a dread of the room where the death had\ntaken place. As for the servants, they would hardly have entered it with\nout permission. The witness could not say whether the door of the room\nwas opened after the first, or after the second, sitting.\nThis second deposition, although more to the point, is still not\nquite reliable. Having possibly in mind the state of his mother, Dona\nAngelica, during her last illness, Dr. Vidigal supposed that the\nsomnambule saw her as a thin person. According to other witnesses,\nwhose memory is more trustworthy, the girl said \" stout \" and not\n\" thin,\" her description corresponding to the lady's appearance before\nshe was wasted with disease. All the evidence being taken into\nconsideration, there is no doubt whatever that the door of the room\nwas opened immediately after the first sitting. Neither in his written,\nnor in his oral, replies did the doctor seem to recollect what must,\n\fOct., is\u00bb8.] A Case of \" Spirit \" Identity. 287\nnevertheless, have been latent in his memory : the wardrobe of the\ndeceased was given away, with the exception of two dresses, which\nwere left in the room. He called this circumstance to mind at a visit\npaid to him on January 9th, 1897, after the caller had had an inter\nview with Dona Maria Freitas. On this occasion he stated that Dona\nAngelica's wearing apparel had all been put into one room and had\nafterwards been sent away by persons of the family, two light-coloured\ncotton dresses remaining, which it was intended to give to the\nservants. Dona Julia had a superstitious dread of articles of clothing\nthat had belonged to a dead person. He added\u2014 and this observation\nof his has great weight\u2014 that they were not in good circumstances at\nthe time and could with difficulty defray the heavy funeral expenses.\nThis being the case, they certainly would not have left the money in\nthe pocket if they had known it was there.\nMr. Edward Silva, who was next interrogated, is a native of\nGibraltar, and therefore a British subject, who is more familiar with\nthe Spanish than with the English tongue. As an engineer of mines\nand fortifications, he was formerly employed in the service of the\nSultan of Morocco ; but soon after coming to Brazil, he began to\nexerc se the profession of magnetic healer, in which he has lately\nacquired great notoriety. It would be irrelevant to discuss here how\nfar his method of treatment is justified by success. It is sufficient to\nsay that he has great faith in his own powers and that his very\npositive personality is characterised by much apparent candour.\nNevertheless, he also seemed to think that Senr. Meyer's account was\na reliable one, and in reply to inquiries, he wrote on June 3rd, 1896,\nasserting its correctness, and adding some details relative to the\nmanner m which the seance began. The contents of his letter may\nbe thus condensed :\u2014\nWith the exception of Dr. Vidigal's address, which should have been\nNo. 2, Alameda Triumpho, the account published in the Reoue Spirite is\nquite correct. Mr. Silva was requested by the doctor's mother-in-law to\nmesmerise the girl so that they might learn what certain workpeople at her\nhacienda were doing. To Mr. Silva's surprise, the girl replied as if to the\ninterrogations of another person. Commanded to say why she did not\nanswer his questions, she declared that she was conversing with her deceased\nfather, who in his lifetime had been a blind man. The latter, she said,\ndesired to shake bands with Mr. Silva, to whom he was grateful for having\ninduced the trance and thus afforded the means of communication. The\nsomnambule explained that Mr. Silva was to place his right hand in hers,\nand on doing so, she also held out her left as if to her father, and both hands\nwere then shaken simultaneously.\nAfter this Mr. Silva desisted from asking his own questions, and for an\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

What he then observed\nis narrated in the Revue Spirite.\nAt the personal interview, Mr. Edward Silva, after premising that\nhis memory of the occurrence had been somewhat impaired by time,\nendeavoured to furnish such particulars as. he was still quite sure of.\nHis manner was earnest, and he was professedly cautious in his state\nments. He asserted that his daughter Amalia was present with him\nat the experiment, and that she recollected the details of the case\nbetter than he did. Having made his own declaration, he called in\nthe young lady, who was allowed to give her version of the story\nindependently. From the notes taken at this cross-examination, the\nfollowing depositions were drawn up, which were sent to the witnesses\nfor their approval and signature :\u2014\nThe account given in the Revue Spirite of my experiment with the girl\nFrancisca at the house of Dr. Orencio Vidigal is substantially in accordance\nwith my recollection of the occurrence.\nOn that occasion I had called with my daughter at Dr. Vidigal's, but did\nnot find him at home. His wife, Dona Julia, and her mother, Dona Maria\nFreitas, were, however, present. (I must here mention that my acquain\ntance with this family was formed after the death of Dr. Vidigal's mother,\nof whose personal appearance and habits I was totally ignorant. ) It was\nDona Maria Freitas who requested me to mesmerise Francisca, and as I was\nanxious at the time to discover some good somnambule, I very willingly con\nsented to do so. The lady wished to know how matters were going on at a\nplantation (fazenda), where some workmen were employed by her.\nThe girl became deeply somnambulised, and as she made an ear-trumpet\nof her hand and seemed to ask for a repetition of questions, I thought at\nfirst she had some difficulty in hearing me. I soon found, however, that she\nbelieved herself to be in communication with her dead father, who, through\nthe intermedium of his daughter, desired to shake hands with me in the\nmanner described in my letter of June 3rd.\nEither Dona Julia, or Dona Maria, telephoned for Dr. Vidigal, who was\nat a chemist's in the neighbourhood, and he soon arrived accompanied by\nDr. Telles, a friend of his. Dr. Vidigal put questions to Francisca ; the\ngirl, however, professed not to hear him, asserting that I was the only person\npresent. She became aware of the doctor's vicinity only after I had made\nmagnetic passes from her to him, and thus established a connection between\nthem.\nThe proof of spirit identity related in the Revue Spirite certainly came\non this first occasion, and it is almost as certain that the girl, who belonged\nto the peasant class and came from a country place in Spain, had never\nbefore been experimented with in such a manner. She declared that she\nsaw beautiful sights. There were many bright faces in a bright place, and\nmany dark faces in a dark place. She did not wish to be awaked. In giving\nthe characteristics of the lady seen clairvoyantly, she described her as having\n\fOct., 1808.] A Case of \" Spirit\" Identity. 289\nblack hair ; but I cannot now recall the other particulars mentioned in her\ndescription. I have au idea that, in referring to the money contained in the\ndress pocket, Francisca spoke of the pocket as being stitched together ; but\nof this I am not sure. She directed that the money should be delivered to\nDr. Vidigal's father.\nOf this, her first trance, she retained no recollection after waking. On\nthe occasion of the second experiment, however, I suggested that she should\nremember what had occurred.\nI remember that, when the ladies returned from the room with their\nconfirmation of the message given through the little somnambule, it was\nmentioned that there had been difficulty in opening the door.\nThere was, of course, at Dr. Vidigal's, a desire to witness more of these\nphenomena, and, perhaps, a tendency to experiment with too much fre\nquency ; but the girl's mother, when she heard that her daughter was\nholding communication with the dead, took the alarm and expressed her\nfear that Francisca would \" lose the efficacy of the waters of baptism (per-\ndiese lasaguas del bautismo).\" This was, I believe, the principal reason why\nFrancisca soon after left Dr. Vidigal's service.\n(Signed) Edward Silva.\n17, Alameda Nothmann, San Paulo, August 16th, 1896.\nIn answer to an inquiry, the witness adds :\u2014\nThe dress where the money was found was left in the room, and was\nnever inspected by me.\n(Signed) Edward Silva.\nI was with my father at Dr. Vidigal's on the day on which Francisca was\nmagnetised for the first time. This girl, who at that period might have been\nabout ten or eleven years of age, was a little simpleton when in her normal\nstate.\nThere were present with me on that occasion Dona Maria Freitas, Dr.\nVidigal's mother-in-law ; Dona Julia, his wife ; Dr. Vidigal himself, with\nhis father and his cousin ; a friend of his called Dr. Telles, and a chemist.\nDr. Vidigal and others came from the chemist's shop after they had been\ncalled by telephone. I recollect that the child was magnetised at the request\nof Dona Maria Freitas ; but, as at that moment I was engaged in conversa\ntion, I cannot say what reason she had for making it. I merely supposed\nthat the experiment was being tried in order to see whether the girl was a\nsomnambule.\nOnce magnetised, Francisca neither recognised, nor heard, any of the\npersons present except my father. She declared that she was alone with\nhim and continued in this isolation up to the moment in which a rupport was\nestablished between her and Dr. Vidigal by means of magnetic passes. In\nthis somnambulic condition she asserted that she beheld God and glory, that\nshe distinguished a hand resting on my father's shoulder and that, placed\non his head, she saw a crown. No such crown was perceptible to her on the\nhead of Dr. Vidigal. She described the lady of her vision as dressed in\nblack with a veil of the same color. She [the lady] was full-bodied, of\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., 1898.\nmedium stature, and had black hair. (I afterwards saw a photograph of\nDr. Vidigal's mother, in which she is, in fact, represented as a stout person.)\nThe communicator declared that she was much pleased with her daughter-in-\nlaw, and she expresed a desire to shake hands both with her and her son\nthrough the intermedium of Francisca. She advised them, moreover, to\ndesist from their intention of giving the name Diaulas to their little son,\nwarning them that, if they did so, the child would die. (Dr. Vidigal and\nhis wife did not follow this advice, and the child died a few days after it was\nchristened.) She was contented and desired nothing for herself. Dr.\nVidigal alluded to the troubles he had to bear in life, and asked her to take\nhim so that he might be with her ; but he was told in reply that he must be\nresigned inasmuch as he had yet duties to fulfil towards his family. I\nrecollect how in the same manner the communication came that in the room\nof the deceased lady, and behind the door of this room, there was a light-\ncoloured cotton dress with the pocket stitched together. Inside this pocket\nwould be found a certain sum of money, which had been put there for\nsecurity. Such was the drift of the message.\nTt remained to verify this information about facts that the medium must\nhave ignored completely. I went with Dona Julia to the room, and we\nopened the door ; but I do not remember whether we encountered any\ndifficulty in so doing. On our entering the apartment we saw several\narticles of clothing hanging on the wall ; behind the door, however, we dis\ncovered only the light-coloured cotton dress mentioned by the somnambule,\nand inside the dress pocket, which was sewn together with needle and\nthread, we found the exact sum which had been announced. I can guarantee\nthat the occurrence took place in this wise, although I no longer recollect\nwhether the amount was, or not, that of 75 milreis, as the other witnesses\naffirm- (Signed) Amalia Silva.\nAugust 16th, 1896.\nBoth Mr. Silva and his daughter seemed to be much struck with\nthe hand- shaking. Dona Amalia thought it necessary to append the\nfollowing postscript to her deposition : \u2014\nI also recollect the girl somnambule saying that her deceased father\nprofessed himself well pleased with my father for having induced in her the\nconditions which enabled him to communicate. He desired to shake hands\nwith my father. The latter stretched out his hand, but the girl said her\nfather told her that it could not be grasped in that manner. It could be\ndone only through her intermedium. She was to extend her hand in his\nstead. In this way both her arms were seen by me to be strongly shaken.\n(Signed) Amalia Silva.\nDona Julia, the wife of Dr. Vidigal, was next interrogated :\u2014\nShe asserted that Mr. Silva and Dona Amalia were right in saying that\nthe message from the doctor's mother was obtained the first time that\nFrancisca was hypnotised. She remembered calling her husband from the\nchemist's. Her mother, her father-in-law, her husband's cousin, and his\n\fOct., 18\u00bb8.] A Case of \" Spirit \" Identity. 291\nfriend Dr. Telles were also present.* She thought the girl spoke of the dress\nas a cotton dress, and of the pocket as being stitched together ; but she did\nnot recollect whether mention was made of the colour of the dress. In\ncommon with many Brazilian ladies, she had a nervous dread of going into\nan apartment where a death had occurred, and the room in which the dress\nwas hanging had not been entered by her since the decease of her mother-\nin-law. It was only after the message had been received that she went to\nthe room with Dona Amalia. No other persons accompanied them on this\noccasion. The door was opened with much difficulty. The witness virtually\nconfirmed the evidence of the others relative to the discovery of the money\nin the pocket. In answer to other questions, she said that the only likeness\nof her mother-in-law that existed at the time of the hypnotic experimentation\nwas a photograph which was in her father-in-law's keeping. There was no\npossibility whatever that Francisca could have obtained a sight of this.\nSubsequently an enlarged portrait, taken from the photograph, was hung up\nin the front apartment of Dr. Vidigal's house. It represents a lady with\nblack hair, who could by no means be described as thin, although part of her\napparent stoutness might be attributed to the style of dress worn by her\nwhen she was taken.\nDona Julia replied to the questions that were put to her simply\nand directly. Her verbal deposition, reproduced from notes, is\nvaluable ; but of the four witnesses who were first examined Dona\nAmalia must be considered the most reliable, for the reason that her\nmemory was evidently more retentive of the facts of the case than\nthat of the others.\nIt has been mentioned above that there was an unavoidable\ninterruption of some months before these inquiries were continued.\nAt the interview which at length took place with Dona Maria Freitas\nit was found that, in accordance with the description given of her by\nher friends, she was a lady endowed with more independence of\ncharacter and vigour of understanding than the generality of her\ncountrywomen. Her statement, which is, therefore, all the more\ntrustworthy, was drawn up at the hacienda where she lives, the usual\nprecautions being taken to ensure accuracy.\nI was present when the girl Francisca was somnambulised by Dr.\nEduardo Silva. This child was the sister of an employt of the health\ndepartment, who recommended her to Dr. Orencio Yidigal as a servant. In\nthe normal state, however, she was of limited intelligence and could neither\nread nor write. Before she was hired in my son-in-law's family, she had\nalready left the emigration depot ; but she had, in fact, been only a very\nshort time in Brazil.\nIt was at my request that Francisca was magnetised, for I wished to\n* At the time of the first visit to San Paulo both Dr. Vidigal's cousin and the\nchemist were dead.

As the other\nwitnesses relate, the little somnambule struck out into another path,\ndescribing scenes quite foreign [to the subject of] our thoughts. \"A beauti\nful door [gate ?] is opening. Oh, what a beautiful door ! \" She afterwards\ndeclared that she saw Dr. Vidigal's mother, and she gave some message for\nhis father which I can no longer call to mind. I recollect very well, how\never, the shaking of hands, and the [somnambulic] utterances faithfully\nreported by Dona Amalia, for Francisca gave an exact description of the\ndeceased Dona Angelica. The somnambule said that she saw a tall stout\nlady with black hair. She said, moreover, that [the lady] was dressed in\nblack and wore a black veil, this being, indeed, the costume in which the\nlatter had been buried. Francisca also spoke of Dr. Yidigal's little son,\nsaying that the doctor's mother did not want them to call him Diaulas, and\n[warning them] that, if they gave him that name, the child would die. (The\nchild did, in fact, die after the baptism.)\nThe sitting began in the presence of three or four persons only ; later on\nit was better attended, Dr. Orencio arriving with Dr. Theodomiro Telles and\nothers. At first my son-in-law did not approve of this magnetisation of the\nservant ; but, in view of the revelations made by her, he at length became\ninterested.\nI did not remain till the termination of this sitting, and consequently I\nwas not present at the finding of the money in the dress. I remember that\non the occasion a light-coloured cotton dress was spoken of.\nAs to Senr. Eduardo Silva, it is certain that I knew him shortly before\nthe death of Dona Angelica ; but it is also certain that he had no knowledge\nwhatever of that lady, and was, therefore, not able to transmit mentally or\nverbally the ideas [which were] expressed by the somnambule in describing\nthe physique of the deceased person.\nFrancisca herself finally refused to sit, declaring that her father did not\nwant her to continue. It was then that her mother withdrew her from Dr.\nVidigal's house.\n(Signed) Maria Rangel db Freitas.\nFazenda Chave Amaro, January 6th, 1897.\nAnother interesting circumstance is brought to light in the fore\ngoing deposition : it seems that Francisca described the very costume\nin which Dona Angelica was buried. On the other hand, it was dis\nappointing to find that Dona Maria Freitas had not directly witnessed\nthe discovery of the money in the pocket. She had, of course, been\ninformed of the incident immediately after its occurrence, and so far\nwas able to corroborate the assertions of the others respecting what is\nthe really important event of the sitting. Some minor particulars\nbearing on the case were also furnished by this deponent : The death-\nchamber had formerly been Dr. Vidigal's room, to which, it seems,\nDona Angelica had been moved, either before, or during, her last ill\nness. The clothes belonging to the deceased were, with the exception\n\fOct., 1898.] A Case of \"Spirit\" Identity. 293\nof two dresses, given away after her death (see Dr. Vidigal's evi\ndence). Dona Maria Freitas was inclined to think that at the time\nof the first sitting Francisca had been in the house some two or three\ndays ; but of this she was not quite sure. The girl in her ordinary\nstate of consciousness was exceedingly dull and childish. In her\nsimple admiration she would touch the telephone, examine the carpet,\nand pass her fingers over the pattern of the wall-paper. She was fond\nof little children, but could not be trusted to take care of them.\nWith regard to Dona Angelica's personal appearance in her lifetime,\nshe was tall and very stout, and even at the time of her last illness\nhad not one white hair. The portrait hanging in Dr. Vidigal's house\nrepresents her as she was when she was younger.\nDona Maria Freitas's statement was afterwards read to Dr.\nVidigal, who declared it to be correct in all but one detail of slight\nimportance : Francisca's brother was employed in the emigration depot\nand not in the health department.\nFour of the preceding witnesses, Mr. Silva and Donas Amalia,\nJulia, and Maria Freitas, agree in saying that Dr. Theodomiro Telles\nwas present on the occasion of the first experiment. His own verbal\ndeclaration made on February 13th, 1898, that he had attended only\nthe second sitting, was therefore a surprise. Dr. Orencio, however,\nhad told him the next day after the first experiment that the somnam-\nbule had announced the existence in a pocket of money which was\nsubsequently found there. Dr. Telles considered Mr. Silva to be a\nvery good operator ; but when he himself was present, he witnessed\nnothing more than the ordinary hypnotic phenomena. This assertion\nof his probably means that he saw nothing that exceeded the bounds of\nhypnotic possibilities, for the second sitting, like the first, was of the\nnature of a spiritistic seance, the girl again declaring herself to be in\ncommunication with her dead father.\nIn the obituary of the Diario Official of San Paulo for the 20th of\nJune, 1893, among the names of those who were buried on the 17th\nof that month, the following notice is published : \u2014\nAngelica da Costa Carvalho Vidigal, 00 years, Brazilian, married : nervous\nexhaustion.\nThis confirms the date of the death as it is given by Dr. Vidigal.\nSuch is the evidence which is now obtainable for this proof of\n\"spirit\" identity. If it is here presented with prolix repetitions, and\nif prominence is given to trifling circumstances, it is in order that the\nwitnesses and their depositions may be appreciated at their just value.\nTo confine the narrative to essentials would be to lose sight of certain\ndiscrepancies which must not be thus smoothed over. Though not\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Oct., ushs.\ndirectly asserted, it is apparent from the above statements that there\nwas a marked difference in intelligence between Francisca's normal\npersonality and the trance personage brought to the surface by Mr.\nSilva. The one was childish and simple-minded in the extreme ; the\nother was evidently characterised by vivacity and was the vehicle for\nsome very sensible advice to Dr. Vidigal. This first trance induced in\nan ignorant country child bears an interesting likeness to that of other\nsomnambules who have been better studied. With the same activity\nof the visual centres, she sees a beautiful gate or door ; then, possibly\ndrawing upon her remembrance of the imagery in Catholic churches,\nshe beholds God and His glory\u2014there peer upon her bright faces and\ndark faces\u2014also a crown is on the head and a hand on the shoulder of\nMr. Silva, who was, perhaps, revered by her as a man endowed with\nmysterious powers. Francisca had recourse to the old excuse for not\ngiving some information which was very likely beyond her ken : there\nwere some things, she said, which it was not permitted to tell. It may\nbe noticed that the performance of hand-shaking was rather unnatural\nin the case of Dr. Vidigal and Dona Julia. After a separation, a\nBrazilian mother embraces her son and her daughter-in-law ; she does\nnot usually shake hands with them. The impulse to salute them may\nhave proceeded from the outside influence ; but the manner of salutation\nwas probably chosen by Francisca, who, although entranced, was, it\nmay be supposed, still mindful of her position as a servant. The\nDiaulas incident likewise finds parallels in similar experiences else\nwhere. If it is anything more than a chance hit, it would indicate some\nslight prescience on the part of the trance personage, or some somnam\nbulic perception of the state of the child's health and, perhaps, of the\nfixed resolve of the parents to call their little son by that name. Had\nthe child been christened Carlos or Henrique, its fate would, no doubt,\nhave been the same. It is tolerably well proved that neither Mr.\nSilva, nor his sujet, had any previous knowledge of the personal\nappearance and habits of Dona Angelica. But Dr. Vidigal, who knew\nof both, was put en rapport with her. Thought-transference from his\nmind was, of course, possible as long as Francisca confined herself to a\ndescription of the physique, the burial costume and the personal\npeculiarities of the deceased lady. It was when she mentioned the\nexact sum of money sewn up in the pocket, and pointed out the exact\nlocality where it would be found that it became apparent that there\nwas some other source of information. This one instance of the\ncommunication of knowledge belonging exclusively to a dead person\nreflects back on the other phenomena of the sitting and makes it more\nprobable that they also were derived, at least in part, from the same\n\fOct., 1898.1 Correspondence. 295\ndiscarnate intelligence. In conclusion, it may be remarked that in the\nlatter part of the trance Dona Angelica's personality seems to have\nstood out with some relief, so much so that the main incident of the\nsitting is more plausibly attributed to her action than to mere clair\nvoyant perception on the part of the somnambule.\nOBITUARY.\nLT.-COL.

When I see figures or faces\u2014which at present I have not\nbeen able to do by will\u2014the figures are about the size of a full length figure\nin a carte de visite photograph, the faces sometimes those of a cabinet\nvignette photograph, now and then life size.\nI sometimes have the sense while observing these phenomena that there\nis a brilliant light somewhere near gradually increasing in brightness. This\nis so present to my conciousness that I have sometimes opened my eyes\nexpecting to find daylight, and opened them on darkness.\nI am a very keen visualiser, and I have sometimes had the sensation of\nimaginary faces, etc., visualised before me without, any corresponding\nimpression on my eyes. I imagine that these two classes of sensation\ncorrespond to the different kinds of \"vision\" described as the experience of\nSt. Teresa. M Brameton.\nSpiritualism and Spirit Identity.\n(To the Editor of the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.)\nSir, \u2014I should like to correct a misconception of the view I submitted in\nthe June Journal. Mr. Schiller remarks that I \"can conceive the empirical\npersonality as surviving 'death,' but not as maintaining itself in its post\nmortem existence.\" And he supposes this position to be the same as that of\nthe Reincarnationist, Cebes, in the Pfuedo, that the soul may wear out\nmany bodies, but eventually itself perish. They have only this much in\ncommon, that, as successive incarnations are successive ' empirical personali\nties,' no reincarnationist can conceive the relatively permanent individuality\nas a mere survival of one of its transient expressions. Our positive evidence\nis necessarily confined to the fact of a memorial prolongation of consciousness.\nNeither that evidence, nor my view of its significance, has any connection\nwith the larger doubt of Cebes, which regards the ultimate value or fate of an\nindividuality assumed to be inclusive of many distinct lives, or segregated\ncontinua of experience.\nBy the ' empirical personality ' I understand generally the determined\nself, self-reference to, or self-position in, an environment or ' world.' This\ncorrelation implies, that any new environment must be ejusdem generis with\nthe old, if the personal consciousness is to find itself connectedly in both,\nthat is, to identify both as comprised in one continuum of experience. In\nany supposition we make of a new world of relation, we must include that of\ndiscrete deepening, or expansion, of the ' psychological constitution ' of a\nself which is to be conscious of the unity of its experience in both relations.\nEither the environment cannot be wholly new, if with our definitely\ndetermined psychological constitution we are to ' survive ' in it at all ; or there\nmust be a new psychological adaptation. In short, of an ' other ' life our\n\fOct., isms.] Correspondence. 297\nevidence gives, and can give, no information whatever. Of its identifiable\npersonalities we must say, in the words of a French writer : the only\nrevenants are the lion allants.\nThe view which I wished to suggest so far agrees with M. D'Assier's\nthat it recognises the attachment of the post-mortem memorial consciousness\n\u2014the only consciousness we can get at in the evidence \u2014 to the earthly life,\nand sees in it a mere temporary and evanescent survival of the latter. But\nthe French Positivist thinks this 'posthumous humanity' is all ; and there T\npart company with him. For I conceive the individual life\u2014pending trans\ncendent development\u2014as a cycle of states, of great days and nights, or\nobjective and subjective periods, according to what I believe to be universal\nanalogy. That indrawal of consciousness does not ensue immediately and\ncompletely upon physical death, at least when that is at all 'premature,' is\nalso quite in agreement with our frequent experience of the difficulty of\ngetting to sleep, and it is just this interval of increasing lassitude and\nincoherence with which our evidence of ' spirit identity ' is concerned.\nConvinced of the unity of process, we shall not suppose it to be unique on\none scale of representation, but shall find clues to all our thought of the\ninvisible in what we already see and know.\nThough rejecting M. D'Assier's conclusion, that individuality itself\nsurvives only as a decaying remnant of the earthly empirical consciousness,\nI must urge that it is the readiest apparent explanation of the gradual\nfailure of the identifying evidence, and that that evidence, of itself, only\npushes materialism a step back, compelling it to recognise a temporarily\nsurviving extract from the physical organisation. And I believe we should\nfind, were our facts once generally admitted, that the Materialist and the\nPositivist would immediately take up M. D'Assier's position. The evidence\ndoes not really help us to the proof of immortality ; it may be said even to\nembarrass that conviction seriously, until explained by one or other of\nhypotheses which are as little subject to immediate verification as the specula\ntions of Plato. Knowing nothing of post-mortem consciousness, faith in\nimmortality retains all the force of doctrinal and philosophical considerations,\nand of authoritative tradition. But recognition of what may be called the\nghost-consciousness tends to push all such ideas aside (that is for those who\nplace their reliance on external evidence), and the disintegrating character\nof that merely memorial consciousness will seem to reduce the whole\nconception of individual persistence to that of a mere after-glow of\nterrestrial life. Mr. Schiller describes that view as 'odd and old.' Well, it\nis not odd in the sense of being singular, because it is old, at least in the\nessential particular, to a much wider extent than his not very relevant\nreference to Plato's doubter would lead one to suppose. For in the earlier\nGreek and Jewish conception, survival\u2014in Hades and Sheol\u2014was merely\nmemorial (\" Man survived only as a shadow of himself. Intellectually and\nmorally he ended at death.\" See Article ' Eschatology, ' Encyclopedia\nBritannica). I cannot help thinking that those old notions originated in\n' Spiritualistic ' experience. The only difference is that the modern\npsychologist recognises, as the Greek did not, that a merely memorial\nsurvival caunot endure. q_ q_ Massey\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

In a\nletter of July 27th, 1898, he states that \"the words of the mother's\nletter were the ipsissima verba as I copied them myself.\" Owing, how\never, to the distress of the family at the death, he is unable to obtain\nany further corroboration, and has also changed the names of the\npersons concerned.\nCosheen, Castle Townshend, Co.

On 10th June, Helen having a bad headache,\nremained in bed, and did not get up for dinner. Her sister went up from\nthe dinner-table to inquire what Helen would like, and found her dead. An\ninquest reported the cause as arising from a tumourous growth on the brain.\nDr. Cecil's sister, not wishing to shock his family by an abrupt telegram,\nwrote the bad news the following day, which should be, and was, received\na fortnight later. The child Helen was buried on 14th June, and the family\nheard of the death nine days after. On 27th June, the mother wrote to the\nsurviving daughter, telling her that on the night of the 13th June, she had\nseen Helen in a bad dream, who had said that \" she was dead and could not\nsay how it had happened.\" She had told the father of it, and until the\nletter from Ireland told the fact, they had forgotten all about the dream or\nvision, when it at once recurred to the father's mind that it occurred the\nnight before the child was laid in her grave.\nKendal Coghill.\nL. 1102.

Feared perhaps something had happened to Mr. Castle.\nOn Mr. Castle's return about 6 p.m. he greeted me with \"I came near\ngetting in a bad fix this afternoon.\" I said \"When?\" And he replied,\n\fOct., 1898.] Cases. 299\n\" About an hour and a half ago.\" I then told him my experience, and he\ntold me that he had unexpectedly had an operation performed on his throat,\nand afterwards, instead of remaining still, went down to a barber shop. There\nhe was suddenly seized with a terrible choking fit, and almost feared he was\ngoing to die. It frightened the barbers greatly too. He sat there nearly\nan hour before he was able to go.\nI did not know anything of his having that operation performed.\nI never had any such sensation before or since this one, but have had a\nfew incidents in connection with Mr. Castle which might be thought-\ntransference.

After a further discussion they were\nsigned as correct. But Mrs. Castle has herself written out the attached\nfuller account on her part. \u201e p\nMr. Castle is of the firm of A. H. Castle and Co., Pianos, Nicollet and\n7th-streets, Minneapolis.\nMinneapolis, May, 1896.\nOn the first day of last July (1895), while resting, late in the afternoon,\nI suddenly experienced a constrictive sensation in my throat, accompanied\nby a numbness, which increased for some time, and finally became so\ndistressing that I bathed and rubbed my throat several times\u2014while\ndressing, soon after it began\u2014using also a mental treatment (in which I am\na firm believer). I could discover no cause within myself for such a\nsensation, which was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. It\noccurred to me that it might be due to some influence outside of myself,\nand I thought of my husband with some anxiety, but I remember that the\nfear for his safety was dissipated by the ludicrous thought that nothing but\na \"hanging\" would be an excuse for such symptoms. I thought also of a\nfriend (Mrs. Baldwin) who was stopping with me at the time. She had\ngone out that afternoon, and was not in the house when this occurred.\nA stiff collar had been the source of annoyance to her frequently, and I\nthought of that as a possible cause for my discomfort, knowing that she was\nwearing a freshly-laundried shirt waist at the time. She came in for a few\nmoments, to announce her intention of dining out, and I asked her if her\ncollar had made her uncomfortable that afternoon. She assured me to the\ncontrary, and I told her of my strange experience. We discussed it while\nshe was in, and soon after she left, Mr. Castle (my husband) came home to\ndinner. Almost the first words he said were these (if I may be truthful\ninstead of scientific?), \"I came near getting myself into a bad scrape\nto-day.\" He then explained that he had been taking a treatment for his\nthroat, which was very severe, and the doctor had advised him to rest\nawhile in his office before going out, but being pressed for time he had\nconcluded \"to rest\" in the barber's chair, and had gone a short distance\n\f800 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I interrupted him to enquire with much\ninterest as to the time it occurred, and asked him if it were about 4.30.\nAfter thinking a moment, he said, \"Yes, it must have been about an hour\nand a half ago.\" (It was then about six o'clock.)\nI then related my experience to him, and although he was inclined\nto be sceptical at first as to its telepathic origin, he at last admitted that\nit must have been a case of thought-transference, since my symptoms\ncoincided exactly with his\u2014barring the choking\u2014which I did not feel. I\nhad no idea that he was going to the doctor's that day (the date of which,\nby the way, is furnished by Mrs. Baldwin, who remembers it as the day\nbefore she left my house, and this city, for a visit to St. Cloud).

P. Chattock of University College,\nBristol, for the records of several series of thought-transference experi\nments, from which the following results are selected.\nAt a sitting at Harrow in September, 1897, the agents were\nProfessor Chattock and R. C. Clinker, and the percipient was E. B.\nWedmore. E. B. W. sat about three yards from the agents, a lamp\nand table being between them.\nProfessor Chattock, writing to Dr. Hodgson under date of January\n19th, 1898, says :\u2014\nThe impromptu experiments of which I enclose copy seemed to show\nexistence of the real thing in some cases ; e.g., Nos. 1, 3 and 5. No. 5 is\ninteresting because while it was arranged that we were to think of a word of\nthree letters, R. C. C. only wrote down M. The two overlapping As, which\nI remember E. B. W. said insisted on overlapping, though he tried to make\nthem separate, certainly suggest M. (see pp. 305-6).\n\fNov., 1898.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 303\nProfessor Chattock says further in the same letter :\u2014\nR. C. C. and I tried after these experiments to transmit the same draw\nings at appointed times to E. B. W. in London, he from London, and I from\nBristol for a week, sending a different drawing each day, but the result was\ncomplete failure. A second week of experiments under similar conditions\nwas equally unsuccessful. Proximity seems to be required for people in our\ncondition of mind. ... It occurs to me that the percipient should be\nin a partially dazed state. In taking long sets of readings during which one\ngets into a sort of vacant condition, I seem often able to anticipate what my\nassistant is going to say. Is there any convenient way of keeping oneself in\nsuch a condition ? I thought of watching a slowly revolving disc.\nOn January 23rd, 1898, Professor Chattock writes to Dr. Hodgson\nthus :\u2014\nWith regard to the drawings, they were made with two old students of\nmine\u2014the percipient belonging to an old Quaker family here, other members\nof which have shown psychic tendencies. He and Mr. Clinker spent the\nevening with me in some lodgings at Harrow, and it was quite a sudden\nthought that we should try thought-transference experiments. To this, and\nto the fact that we had become socially tuned with much talking and laugh\ning, I fancy what little success we had is due. It has so often happened that\nthe first one or two trials in experiments of this kind show transference and\nthen fail. One gets self-conscious and excited. . . . The percipient\nknew in each case what sort of a thing was to be drawn, e.g., a number of\nthree figures, a word of three letters, three musical notes, name of city, etc.\n. . . I enclose a little set of three experiments between Mr. Wedmore\nand his brother made in September, 1897, which may interest you. Here\nE. B. W. was the agent. Note the success in the first only.\nThe experiments referred to are shown on p. 307.\nOn April 24th, 1898, Professor Chattock again writes to Dr.\nHodgson thus :\u2014\nI am sending you the accounts of a few more experiments in telepathy,\nas you were interested in those I sent before. Those by the brothers\nWedmore are described in the letter I enclose.\nThe following record is enclosed in Professor Chattock's letter :\u2014\nAgent : E. B. W. Percipient : R.

B. Wedmore says :\u2014\nJust after 12 p.m., December 31st [1897], we got some splendid results\nwith playing-cards. . . . We tried five in succession. We were both\nsitting in bed as indicated approximately. (A sketch is enclosed showing\ntwo beds with a screen between). I then got up and wrote the list down.\nWe afterwards tried three more, but without any success. I made my mind\nvacant, and then searched it as it were, and out of the mist would develop\nalmost at once a playing-card. My brother doing the same saw a card\ndevelop in the same way. The funny thing is that I saw my cards as though\nthey were coming from a point rather low down, a little to the right, so that\nthe top of the card was tilted back, and the side tilted somewhat towards my\nbrother, and he saw them almost edgeways and also tilted back, almost as\nthough we had each been looking from our respective positions at the same\nsolid object. It was quite by an after-thought that I enquired how he saw\nthe cards. We tried cards two or three other evenings but without success ;\nwe found we could think of cards much too readily.\nWe had some very curious successes with numbers. I thought of 197 and\nmy brother immediately said the same and thought of the same kind of 9.\nAgain (being rather tired), I thought of 497 but could only imagine the\nnumbers one at a time, and did so taking them in rotation. My brother said\n749 and saw the 7 separately from the others. We had also several partial\nsuccesses always occurring almost immediately after or before complete\nsuccesses.\nOne day at tea my second sister (Margaret) and I were on the same side\nof the table but separated. I told her of our other experiments and she\nthought of five cards in succession. I got, first wrong, second right, third\nnumber slightly wrong, fourth right (immediately), fifth wrong. In each\ncase only one attempt was made. All correct results have been obtained\nalmost immediately and clearly. After tea we tried five more with similar\nresults ; two right, one partial, two wrong. My sister could not receive\nfrom me and I cannot do so from my brother. During above attempt, after\nthe second case we were interrupted, so I strided about determined not to\nthink of a card, and studied the pattern of the carpet, etc., till my sister was\nready. That time was a complete success.\nThese experiments are interesting, showing, as Professor Chattock\nsays, \" the existence of the real thing in some cases.\" The success,\nthough partial and uncertain, should encourage other experimentors.\n\fNov., 1898.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 305\nAgents: Prof. Chattock and R.

A\u00ab P\u00ab\nThe following case was written down next day and sent to me in\nFrench by a scientific friend, who prefers that the narrative should\nbe anonymous. He has had other experiences pointing to thought-\ntransference. The value of the coincidence is more than doubled by\nthe fact that the apprehension was felt also\u2014independently so far as\nany ordinary communication went\u2014by the percipient's sister.\nF. W. H. M.\nOn Friday, December 10th, 1897, at about 10.35 p.m., being alone and\nat work in my library, I began to think, without any reason, that there had\nbeen a fire at the Opera. My wife and daughter had gone off to the Opera\nat 8 ; I had not been able to accompany them. The impression was so\nstrong that I wrote + F [Feu !] on the cover of a book which lay near me.\nA few instants later, wishing to emphasise this presentiment, I wrote \" Att \"\n(for attention), \"Fire!\" I enclose what I wrote. [Fragment of book-cover\nsent herewith with the words mentioned.] I did not, however, feel anxious ;\nbut said to myself, \"There has been no great fire at the Opera, only an\nalarm of fire.\"\nAt the same time, or rather 10 or 15 minutes later, at 10.55, my sister,\nMme. B., who lives in the same house, and whose bedroom is on the same\nfloor with my study, had an idea that my study was on fire. She was at the\nmoment on the point of getting into bed, but she came in deshabille to my\nstudy door and put her hand on the handle to come in ; but then, telling\nherself that her fear was absurd, she went back to bed. She tells me,\nhowever, that she would nevertheless have come in, but that she was afraid\nthat I had someone with me in the room.\nAt 12.10, my wife and daughter came back from the theatre. They\ninstantly told me that there had been a sort of beginning of a conflagration.\n1 said nothing, and they told me as follows :\u2014Between 8.45 and 9, at the\nend of the first act of the Maitres Chanteurs, a smell of burning and a light\nsmoke were perceived in the auditorium. My wife said to my daughter : \"I\nwill go out and see what is the matter ; if I make a sign to you, follow me\nat once, without saying a word or even waiting to put your cloak on.\" The\nattendant whom she asked said that nothing was wrong. Nevertheless,\nthere was some emotion among the audience, and five or six persons in\nthe stalls got up and went away. The smoke came, no doubt, from\na stove.\nNote that this is the first time that my wife ever left her seat in a theatre\nfrom alarm of fire. It is the first time that I have ever been anxious about\nfire in her absence ; and I do not suppose that I jot down my possible\npresentiments more than five or six times in a year.\nMy sister has never before been anxious about fire in my room.\n\fNov., 1898.] Cases. 300\nL. 1104.\nThese extracts were kindly copied out and sent us in the original\nFrench by Sir Lawrence J. Jones, Bart., Associate S.P.R., who stayed\nat Schloss Wildeck in 1897. There is a real interest,\u2014 although there\nmay not be the highest evidential quality,\u2014in records of this kind,\nwritten down in a serious spirit by a lady of high character and\nintelligence, for her own satisfaction, and kept in private archives for\nmore than a century.\nExtracts from the MS. of Madame Sophie d'Erlach, nee d'Effinger- Wildeck,\nof Schloss Wildeck, Aargau, Switzerland.\nI was born November 16th, 1766. I had the misfortune to lose my\nmother in early childhood. She died of small-pox in 1768, aged only 28\nyears.\nOne night (in 1771) I had a vision or a dream, which still lives in my\nmemory a though it were of yesterday. ... I was sleeping in my grand\nmother's room in a little bed without curtains ; on account of my restlessness\na wooden rail had been put to prevent me from falling out. ... I dreamt\nthat a young and beautiful woman, surrounded by a supernatural light, came\nup to me, removed the rail, seated herself on my bed and called me softly\nby my Christian name. \" Dear child,\" she said to me, \" I have chosen the\ntime when you are asleep that I may not frighten you, to let you see\nyour mother. Look at my features which portraits will recall to your mind ;\nyou are destined to have many sorrows ; I am happy, I died young, whilst\nyou will survive those you love ; it will be your fate to mourn for them.\"\nWhen she left me she kissed me and told me not to tell my grandmother of\nher appearance. She added: \"I shall see you once more, at the hour of your\ndeath.\" So saying, she disappeared. I woke up with a start, my rail was\nin its usual place, but I was so terrified that I took refuge in my grand\nmother's bed, without, however, telling her of my dream. My terror was\nincreased by seeing the excitement of the faithful spaniel, which had\nfollowed in my mother's funeral procession. He was my companion, sleep\ning at the foot of my bed ; his intelligence was extraordinary, and he took\npart in all my amusements.\nThis prediction was so far fulfilled that Madame d'Erlach led a\nvery unhappy life and survived all her children and most of her\nrelations and intimate friends. She died in 1842.\nThe next extract is dated 1786.\nAnother relation, for whom I soon entertained a filial affection, was\nMonsieur d'Erlach de Hindelbank. . . . His eldest son, colonel of the\nSchomberg regiment of dragoons . . . had before served in the Swiss\nGuard at Paris, where he had the good fortune to save the life of the Duke of\nCastries at the risk of his own. This secured to him the support of this family\nand an introduction into the best French society. It was whispered that the\nPrincess Charlotte of Lorraine had taken particular notice of him ; she had\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 18U8.\nwished to marry him rather than any other man, although he was a\nProtestant. As she could not do so, she became a nun, and died abbess of\nthe noble and royal chapter of Remiremont. . . . The singular thing is\nthat the Princess in the habit of an abbess appeared to him one day at\nOberhofen, where he happened to be at the time, to bid him a last farewell.\nAlthough he was far from being superstitious, this apparition made the more\nvivid impression on him inasmuch as it corresponded with the day of her\ndeath.\nThe subject of the following extract, under date of 1804, was\nMadame de Montleart de S. Simon, \" dame d' honneur chez Madame,\"\nat Versailles before the Revolution, afterwards one of the \"emigres.\"\nOn June 2nd my friend Madame de Montleart arrived at my house. She\nwas in the last stages of consumption . . . she breathed her last in my\narms on June 21st. . . . On the 23rd she was buried in a spot she had\nherself chosen, close to the castle. . . . An extraordinary circumstance,\ndifficult of explanation, was a dream which Madame de Montleart had several\ntimes in succession, many years before coming to Wildeck ; a dream which\nstruck her so much that she made a note of it. She dreamt that she had\naccompanied the royal family to the chapel at Versailles to attend mass, but\nhad not been able to find a suitable seat. A prelate, seeing her embarrass\nment, gave up his place to her, at the same time presenting her with a\nmirror, and saying to her \"Believe me, madame, there only will you find\nrest.\" On looking at it she saw an old manor house and a landscape, which\nwere quite unknown to her. When she told mo about this dream, she\nadded : \"I have found the place, it is Wildeck, I recognised it immediately\nupon my arrival ; be persuaded it is there I shall leave my earthly\ntenement.\"\nAnother account of these dreams, from the same hand, states that\nthey took place twenty years before Madame de Montleart's arrival at\nWildeck.\nThe MS. containing these extracts is in the possession of the\nBaroness von Effinger of Schloss Wildeck, great-granddaughter of the\nwriter. Schloss Wildeck has been the residence of the Effingers\nsince 1484.\nL. 1105.\nThis case closely resembles a case already printed in Phantasms of\nthe Living (Vol. II., p. 211), where a gentleman, kept away from his\noffice by slight illness, is seen in that office by two other persons.\nOn Thursday, April 12th, 1888, I made an arrangement to meet Mr.\nA. B. and the Rev. T. W. Lemon at the British Museum Reading Room at\na quarter to eleven the next morning, Friday (13th). But I caught a cold\non Thursday evening, and on Friday I was confined to bed with a feverish\ncatarrh, and I lay there fretting at not being able to keep the appointment,\n\fNov., 18U8.] Cases. 311\nand I fancied their presence at the Reading Room and their annoyance at\nmy absence.\nI heard subsequently from Mr. A. B. personally that he and the Rev.\nT. W. Lemon had met at the Reading Room and had not been able to find\nme, but that he had asked some officials, notably one named Ryan, for me,\nand some habitues among the readers, notably a Miss O'Connell and a Mrs.\nSalmon. Mr. A B. also said that Ryan and Mrs. Salmon had both told\nhim that they had seen me in the Reading Room walking around as if\nseeking some one, just before he enquired of them.\nA few days after that, I went to the Reading Room and saw Miss\nO'Connell and Mrs. Salmon, when the latter in a jocular way said : \" Is it\nreally you to-day or not 1 \" She was so much impressed by the peculiarity\nof my appearance on the 13th, that for a long time she made the same\njocular query when I met her. Miss O'Connell was told of the event at the\ntime, and has repeatedly heard Mrs. Salmon and me refer to the incident.\nBy recent enquiry I find that Ryan is dead, but Mrs. Salmon and Miss\nO'Connell are both still alive and in England.\nW.

B. went to\nthe seat and came and told me Dr. Westcott was not there. I said, \" Oh, he\nmust be, it's only a few minutes since I saw him sit down.\" I went myself.\nHe was not to be seen. I went to the man who takes the umbrellas and\nsaid, \"Have you seen Dr. Westcott ?\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"he went into the\nroom about five minutes ago.\"\nThis is exactly what took place.\nJanuary 2tth, 1898.\nEllen Salmon.\nMiss O'Connell lias also given her account of the incident as\nfollows :\u2014\nI perfectly remember on the occasion in question meeting Mr. A. B. at\nthe entrance to the Reading Room. He asked me if I had seen Dr. West\ncott come in, as T. W. Lemon was waiting to see him by appointment, and\nI replied that I had not seen Dr. Westcott. About ten minutes later Mr.\nA. B. came to me and said: \"It is very queer, I have been four times\nround the room and can see no sign of Dr. Westcott ; yet Mrs. Salmon says\nshe will take her Bible oath she saw him come into the room and go direct\nto my seat.\" Shortly after, Mr. A. B. went over to Dr. Westcott's residence\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1898.\nto discover the reason of his absence, and the following morning told me\nthat he had found him in bed with a feverish cold, and very much worried\nat not being able to keep his appointment. Mrs. Salmon was the more\nsurprised at having seen his astral form, as she has never studied these\nmatters in any way, and naturally thought it singular that she should be the\nonly one in the room to have seen Dr. Westcott's astral form.\nTheresa J. O'Connell.\nJanuary 2Uh, 1898.\nG. 258.\nUnder the title \" A Good Case of Clairvoyance,\" a contribution\nfrom Mr. John Lamont of Liverpool appeared in Light of January\n16th, 1897. Through the kindness of Mr. Lamont, of Mr. John\nJobson, and of others who took part in the occurrences, some further\nfirst-hand evidence has been obtained, which is given below, in addition\nto the particulars furnished in the report in Light. There were some\ndiscrepancies in dates in that report, due to its having been written\nfrom memory. These have been cleared up. The following paragraphs\nare from Mr. Lainont's article in Light of the above date : \u2014\nBy way of preface to the following narrative, let me say that three friends\n\u2014James Connell, James Oliver, and John Jobson, all then resident in\nLondon, where Mr. Connell still resides\u2014were in the habit of discussing the\nprobability or otherwise of life after death ; the two first named at that\ntime being sceptics.\nJobson removed to Liverpool, some time after which Connell and a few\nfriends formed a circle at Connell's house. At this time Oliver (who soon\nafterwards died) was too weak to join the circle, but was present and heard\nand saw what was gcing on, and said, sometimes in jest, sometimes in\nearnest, that if there was a life after death he would come back and rattle\nthe planchette for them. (The reader is referred to a letter in Light, of\nMay 25th, 1895, bearing on the promise made by Oliver, entitled \" A\nStrange Story.\")\nNow for the facts. Mr. Connell had two children\u2014Dan, who died some\nyears ago, and Kathleen, to whom this narrative more directly relates, and\nwho was very fond of Mr. Jobson, and was in the habit of sitting on his\nknee and calling hiin her Daddy Jobson. Thus it will be seen that a close\nintimacy existed between the child (whose pet name was Cathie) and Mr.\nJobson.\nIn the meantime, as I have said, Mr. and Mrs. Jobson removed to\nLiverpool, where they were in the habit of attending Pembroke Baptist\nChurch, of which the Rev. Charles F. Aked is pastor ; but being interested\nin Spiritualism, they came occasionally to the meetings at Daulby Hall,\nwhere the Liverpool Society of Spiritualists hold their meetings, and Mr.\nJobson became influenced to write automatically. On Monday, November\n30th, 1896, Mr. and Mrs. Jobson being present at a meeting of members at\nDaulby Hall, Mrs. Rossbottom, a lady member of the society who is a\n\fNov., 1898.] Cases. 313\nclairvoyant, said to Mr. Jobson : \"There has been a little girl sitting on your\nknee nearly all the evening.\" Mr. Jobson replied : \" I don't know of any\nlittle girl ; but I do know of a little boy, whom it might be ; \" Mr. Jobson\nthinking of his favourite, Dan, who he knew was in the spirit world, if there\nwas such a place.\nMrs. Rossbottom replied : \"I did not see the face, as the back was\nturned towards me, and the head rested on your shoulder with one arm round\nyour neck, but it looked to me to be a girl.\"\nIn a letter to Mr. E. T. Bennett written in February, 1897, Mr.\nJobson, whose address is 137, Hall Lane, Kensington, Liverpool,\nsays :\u2014\nMonday, November 30th [1896] I attended seance held at Daulby Hall,\nat the close of which Mrs. Rossbottom told me about seeing the little girl,\nof which the Light account is correct.\nMrs. Rossbottom also writes to Mr. E. T. Bennett in February,\n1897 :\u2014\n194, Phythian Street, Liverpool.\nDear Sir, \u2014Being present at a meeting held in Daulby Hall, Daulby\nStreet, Liverpool, on November 30th [1896], sitting close to me was a gentle\nman whose name was not at that time known to me. I saw a little girl\nsitting on his knee and told him of the fact. Mr. Jobson, whose name I\nsince learnt, shook his head, and he said he did not know any little girl.\nHe added, if it were a little boy I might know it. I said, judging from the\nhair and general appearance, I should take it to be a girl about six years old.\nMr. Jobson said something about the age of the little boy, which I did not\nquite catch, but I gathered from his tone it was not satisfactory, so for the\ntime the matter dropped. Mr. John Lamont was present at that meeting.\nI also was present when Mrs. Ohiswell and Mrs. Watson gave descriptions\nof wreath, and name Cathie was given. Seeing the little girl was not\nknown, I said nothing of what I have written on page 3 [i.e., what follows.]\nOn reaching my own home and sitting quiet I saw a woman whose face was\ncovered with her hands in such grief, not tears. The little girl whom I had\nseen about an hour before put her hand in mine and said : \"Come to\nMamma, do come.\" Shaking my head doubtfully, I saw a bright and\nbeautiful spirit of a young woman draw the child to her and they vanished.\nI know they are real on that side, and have much pleasure in sending my\nversion of the matter. I am not a public medium. Such [power] as I possess\nis my greatest blessing, a pearl beyond price.\nCharlotte Rossbottom.\nMr. Jobson writes further in the letter above quoted :\u2014\nMonday, December 1st, at home, I sat down to see if I could get any\ncommunication, when a spirit who often uses my hand wrote automatically\n\" Oliver is here, and wishes to give you a message.\" I then asked mentally,\n\"Are you here, Jim?\" The reply came, \"Yes, I wanted to tell you that\nCathie Connell is here. She has been here a fortnight. \"\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1898.\nMr. Lamont remarks in Light in his article above quoted : \u2014\nThis was news indeed, if true ; the Jobsons not having heard from the\nConnells since Easter, when Cathie was in her usual health.\nOn Saturday, December 12th, Mr. and Mrs. Jobson were at Mr.\nLamont's house, and expressed considerable anxiety about the message\nthat had been received. Mr. Lamont thus reports in Light what\npassed : \u2014\nI advised them to let the matter pass, as there might be nothing in it,\nand Jobson did not like to write to the Connells to inquire, lest he might be\nmaking a fool of himself. But I asked : \" Was this child in the habit of\nsitting on your knee ? \" \"Oh, yes,\" was the reply, \"she was very fond of\nme, and I of her, and I cannot but think that her parents would have\nwritten to let us know if the child was dead. I don't know what to make of\nthis writing through my hand ; whether it is myself or some other force\nthat does it.\"\nIn the letter quoted above Mr. Jobson further says : \u2014\nMonday, December 14th, 1896. Received by morning's post, after I had\ngone to business (Mrs. Jobson taking the letter from postman), a letter\ncontaining the news of Cathie's passing away. This was the letter sent by\nMrs. Connell. I attended stance at Daulby Hall on the evening of the\nsame day. Mrs. Watson heard the name of Cathie several times. After\nwards Mrs. Watson and Mrs. Chiswell saw a spirit come and place leaves on\nmy shoulder, as described in Light. When I got home from stance on same\nnight I thought I would try if I could get writing, to know why the spirit\nhad come to me at the stance. My hand wrote the message you have seen\nin Light ; that being a verbatim account of all I received.\nThe following is Mr. Jobson's account of this as it appeared in Mr.\nLamont's article in Light : \u2014\nI was at the meeting at Daulby Hall last Monday, and had, as you know,\nthe following description given me, but did not know till I got home that it\nhad any bearing on the passing away of dear little Cathie. (It was on this\nday that Mrs. Jobson received Mrs. Connell's letter, and Mr. Jobson being\nat business went to the meeting at Daulby Hall before going home, hence his\nignorance of Cathie's passing away.) Two ladies, Mrs. S. S. Chiswell and\nMrs. Watson, both described a spirit as coming to me. They said : \" She is\na beautiful young woman, dressed in spirit robes. She places a wreath of\nivy on your shoulder.\" At the close of the meeting I heard various\nconjectures about the significance of the wreath being placed on my\nshoulder. Some put one construction on it and some another, so I decided\nwhen I got home to try automatic writing. Much to my surprise my hand\nwrote: \"I am here.\" I then asked mentally : \"Can you tell me why you\nplaced the wreath on my shoulder ? I should like to know if it is symbolical\nof anything that tends to good. Are you the spirit that placed the wreath\non me ? \" My hand wrote : \" Yes ; I am that spirit, and will tell you what\n\fNov., 1898.] Cases. 315\nyou wish to know. I placed the wreath on your shoulder to let you know\nthat we appreciate your sympathy on behalf of the parents of the dear\nchild you loved so well. We return our sincere thanks to you for all your\nlove to her and her dear brother Dan. They are both happy here, and know\nthat they are brother and sister. They will often visit you while you remain\nin the earth-life, and will be sure to meet you when you come to the summer\nland. They are very lovable children, and play with each other here.\" I\nasked : \" Can you tell me if it was Cathie whom the lady medium saw\nsitting on my knee a few weeks as;o ?\" \" Yes ; it was she, and she was so\npleased that she had seen you. She often talks about you. I am her spirit\nmother. No name can be given ; if I gave it you would not know it.\" I\nasked: \"Have you anything more to say to me?\" \"No; good-night.\"\n\" Will you visit me again ? \" \"Yes.\"\nMr. Lamont concludes his article in Light by saying : \u2014\nThis ends the narrative, but I ought to say that Cathie was six years and\nfour months old when she passed to the higher life.\nCathie Connell died on October 31st, 1896.\nIn reply to an enquiry as to whether the original messages had\nbeen preserved, and in reply to some other queries, Mr. Jobson wrote\nas follows under date November 3rd, 1897 :\u2014\nI will tell you how I know that the above date [1st December] is correct.\nWhen first I found that I had the gift of automatic writing I used scraps of\npaper which I threw away, but as I proceeded I thought that it would be as\nwell to keep the communications, if only to know whether the writing\nimproved in style as I went on. So I got a note-book and used it. Every\ntime I sit for writing I first jot down the date, so that the event you enquire\nabout appears under the date 1st December. Your second query is : Was\nMrs. Jobson at the stance or had she met Mrs. Watson during the day 1\nShe was at the stance, but she had not met Mrs. Watson during the day. I\nmay explain that when Mrs. Watson entered the stance room Mrs. J. was\nalready there, but at the other end of the room, so that there was about six\nyards between them, and the room was full of people. I may say also that\nit is quite a usual thing for Mrs. Watson to hear names called at seances.\nOn the night in question she had not sat long when she exclaimed : \" Who's\nCathie\u2014I hear someone calling Cathie.\" Soon after that Mrs. Chiswell and\nMrs. Watson saw the spirit described in Light appear. . . . As to my\nautomatic writing, I do not use a planchette, I take a pencil in my hand,\nmentally say an invocation, wait a minute or two, then some force not my\nown guides my hand along. . . . But, as I have said before, I got a\nreporter's note-book to keep them in, and the messages in the story you are\ninterested in are mixed in among others of a more or less private nature ; so\nthat you will see the difficulty in that direction. But if you are particularly\ninterested about seeing them, I will be in London (if nothing comes in the\nway to prevent) at Easter. If you care to make an appointment to meet me,\nI will be pleased to show you the book.\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1898.\nMr. Jobson was in London at Easter, 1898, and kindly brought\n-up his note-book, and showed Mr. Bennett the original entries above\nreferred to, obviously, as he says, made at the time.\nThe following is the letter from Mrs. Connell informing her friends,\nthe Jobsons, of the death of her daughter. It is not dated, but was\nreceived on the morning of December 14th, 1896.\n139, Denmark Hill, S.E.\nMy Dear Friends, \u2014I know how you will sympathise with us when I tell\nyou that our darling little Cathie passed away over a month ago. Jim is\naway in Scotland, and I have been very ill ever since or would have written\nbefore. Our darling was only ill a day or two of diphtheria. She had been\ngetting on so well lately. Since I had given her the maltine tablets, she had\nseemed so well and went to school. My dear friends, I cannot tell you half\nhow I miss her charming, sweet little ways. She was the very emblem of\nlove and sympathy. Her whole thoughts were what she could do [to] make\nus all happy. She seemed to love everything and everybody. She saw\nbeauty everywhere ; and I never knew a child so young to have so many\nfriends. I have had at least 30 letters of condolence from people who loved\nher ; and it is only the knowledge that my darling may return to us that\nkeeps my heart from breaking. Poor Jim came home too late to see her\nalive. I will write again soon. \u2014Yours ever,\nK. Connell.\nThe two following communications are from Mrs. Chiswell and Mrs.\nWatson mentioned above :\u2014\n9, Sugnall-street, Liverpool, February 22nd, 1897.\nOn Monday evening December 14th, 1896, I attended the weekly\nmeeting of the members of the Liverpool Society of Spiritualists, held in the\ncommittee room at Daulby Hall, 14, Daulby-street. During the evening, I\nsaw clairvoyantly, and described to Mr. John Jobson, the spirit form of a\nlady, clad in a flowing white robe, who passed in front of Mr. Jobson,\nturned, and stood immediately behind him, resting her hand on his shoulder.\nThe palm of the hand being uppermost.\nF. A. Chiswell.\nThis is to certify that on Monday, 14th December, 1896, I attended a\nseance held by the members of the Liverpool Society of Spiritualists at\nDaulby Hall, Daulby-street, Liverpool. When I had been there some time,\nI distinctly heard the word \" Cathie \" pronounced several times. Some little\ntime afterwards I saw the spirit of a beautiful young woman come and place\na wreath of ivy leaves on Mr. Jobson's shoulder, then disappear in the same\ndirection she came when she entered the room.\nI have read the above and find it quite correct.\nKate Watson.\n125, Field-street, Liverpool [February, 1897.]\n\fNo. CLIV.\u2014Vol. VIII.

[Dec, 1898.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nA meeting of the Council was held at the Society's Rooms, 19,\nBuckingham Street, on November 4th. Mr. H. Arthur Smith was\nvoted to the chair. There were also present, Dr. A. W. Barrett,\nMr. F. W. H. Myers, Mr. F. Podinore, Mr. Sydney C. Scott, and Dr.\nA. Wallace.\nThe minutes of last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nTwo new Members and twelve new Associates were elected, and\nthe election of one new Member and three new Associates of the\nAmerican Branch was recorded. Names and addresses are given above.\nThe Council recorded with regret the decease of Mrs. Minto\nElliot, who had been an Associate of the Society for many years.\nTwo presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was accorded to the donors.\nIt was agreed that General Meetings be held\u2014subsequently to those\nalready arranged for December 9th, and January 27th\u2014on Friday,\nMarch 10th, at 8.30 p.m., and on Friday, April 28th, at 4 p.m.\nOther matters of business having been attended to, the Council\nagreed that its next meeting should be at the Westminster Town\nHall, on Friday, December 9th, at 3 p.m., previous to the General\nMeeting on that day.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 95th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, November 4th, at 8.30 p.m.; Dr.\nA. W. Barrett in the chair.\nMr. F. Podmore read his paper entitled : \" A Predecessor of\nMrs. Piper.\" The paper is embodied in Mr. Podmore's article in\nProceedings Part XXXIV., under the title of \" Discussion of the\nTrance-Phenomena of Mrs. Piper.\"\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then gave a \"Discussion of some Reciprocal\nand other cases recently received.\" He began by calling attention,\na propos of Mr. Podmore's paper, to a case of Mrs. Piper's type (G.\n256) printed in the Journal for July, 1898, and coming from a very\ngood witness. In that case Mr. Wilkie (now Chief of the Secret Ser\nvice Department of the U.S. Government), when slowly awaking\nfrom a doze, in the presence of a friend, Dr. de Wolf, imagined\nhimself to be writing on a pad of paper a message for Dr. de Wolf\nfrom \" Katy McGuire,\" a person of whom he knew nothing at all ;\nbut whose message, when he awoke and repeated it to Dr. de Wolf,\n\fDec., 1898.] General Meeting. 319\nwas recognised by that gentleman as coming from an old acquaintance,\nand as containing facts never communicated to Mr. Wilkie.\nThe case, thus seen at once to be essentially parallel to Mrs.\nPiper's, becomes closer still when we look at its details. There is the\narrival of the message from a person not near or intimate, but who\nmay probably enough have thought more of Dr. de Wolf than he did\nof her. There is the motor impulse ready to flow with equal ease\ninto writing or speech. And especially there is the utilisation of the\nmoment of waking, the \" peculiar mental condition \" which in Mrs.\nPiper marks the exit not from ordinary sleep, but from trance, in\nwhich she is increasingly wont to utter some of her most significant\nwords. There is, perhaps, no moment in which the sensitive seems to\nbe so nearly in both worlds at once as she does in this.\nFinally, there is the same possibility with which we are familiar in\nmany of Mrs. Piper's messages, namely, that the message may have\nbeen derived from the mind of the living person present. Except the\ndate of Katy McGuire's death,\u2014whose correctness we can hardly now\ntrace,\u2014the facts given were known to Dr. de Wolf.\nMr. Myers then read the two following cases, (one of them\nreciprocal) both of which the Society owes to the kindness of Mr.\nAndrew Lang, who is acquainted with the families concerned.\nL. 1106.

B.'s narration.\n(1.) \"On Friday night, December 11th, 1896, about 11 p.m., we wereall\nsitting by the fire in the kitchen. We heard steps in the passage, coming\nfrom the hall and going along by the nursery door. Jane looked up and\nasked if I heard anything. I said, 'Yes, I thought I heard Mrs. Blaikie\nwalking along with her skirts rustling, from the front door along by the\nnursery.' We had all heard it. I said I thought it was like a warning, and\nI said, ' I hope Mrs. Blaikie isn't dead.' Then we rose and went to the door\nleading from the kitchen to the nursery passage, but saw nothing. Miss\nFrances heard our steps, and came out and asked what on earth was the\nmatter. Miss Frances said she had heard it too, and thought it was one of\nus. Then we went upstairs to Miss Jeanie's room. She had heard it and\nsaid she hoped there were no burglars about. We went all over the house and\nlooked everywhere but there was nothing to be seen. We then went to bed\nand have never heard it again. We all thought Mrs. Blaikie must be dead.\"\n(Signed) Mary B.\nIsabella C.\nDecember 17th, 1897.

I heard the steps come from the hall, past the foot of\nthe staircase, and along the passage known as \"the Nursery Lobby.\" There\nthey died away, and I heard no more. It was rather a heavy, quick,\ndecided step, accompanied by the rustle of a silk dress, and was so exactly\nlike my mother's that if I had not known her to be in Edinburgh, ill, at the\ntime, I should not have had two doubts about it. I wondered which of the\nservants it could possibly be, thought I should ask in the morning, and went\non writing. In a few minutes there was a knock at my door, and I opened\nit to find three scared and white-faced maids. They asked me if I had been\ndownstairs, and looked more scared when I said no. They then asked if I\nhad heard steps, and when I said \"Yes, they sounded exactly like Mrs.\nBlaikie's,\" they told me they had heard them as they sat in the kitchen, had\ngone to look in the hall and passage, and had soon no one. They then went\nto the \" Nursery,\" the room to which the passage where the steps were heard\nled, and asked my sister, whose bedroom it was, if she had left her room. She\nsaid No, but had heard the steps. It was very evident they thought they\nhad heard a ghost, and as my mother was rather seriously ill at the time, of\ncourse they concluded it was hers. We did not discuss this, however, and I\nsuggested burglars, took my poker, and went with them in a procession all\nround the house. We looked in every room and closet, in every wardrobe,\nin the bath, and under every bed, and found nothing. The only other\nperson in the house at the time, besides my sister, three maids, and myself,\nwas my elder brother, who slept in a room upstairs not far from mine. I\nwent to his room, and found him fast asleep. On being roused up he said\nhe had not heard anything at all. In the letter I was writing at the time I\nmentioned that I had broken off to have a burglar hunt, and my\ncorrespondent kept it, so that we have in writing the date and hour.\n(Signed) Jeanib Lang Blaikie.\nHolydean, December 17th, 1897.\n(3.) About 11 o'clock on Friday night, December 11th, 1896, while\nundressing in my room I heard footsteps coming along the lobby towards the\ndoor. They were heavy and rather quick ; exactly like my mother's, but\nnot resembling those of any of the servants. I thought it must, however,\nbe one of the maids, and paid no attention to them until the three servants\ncame in a great state of panic to ask if it had been me. It did not strike me\nas being anything supernatural.\n(Signed) F. M.\n(4.) On Thursday (December 10th 1896), while visiting my niece, Miss\nL., 19, M. Terrace, Edinburgh, I was seized with an acute attack of\nlaryngitis. The evening of the next day (Friday, December 11th), about 11\no'clock I had such a sensation of being suffocated that I felt as if I were\n\fDec., 1898.] General Meeting. 321\ndying, and would never see my home again. I was suddenly filled with an\noverpowering longing to be at home, and whether I fell asleep for a few\nmoments and dreamed I do not know, but it seemed the next minute as if\nmy desire was granted, and I felt I was actually there. I was conscious of\nwalking along the passage past the dressing-room door, and towards the\nroom we call the nursery, but I had hardly time to realise my own joy and\nrelief when I found myself still lying in bed, and the feeling of suffocation\nfrom which I had had such a happy respite for a few moments, again\ntormenting me. When I returned home a week later I was told by Jane D.\nof the curious occurrence at Holydean on the evening of Friday, the 11th.\n(Signed) H. B.\nL. 1107. A\" P\u00bb\nOn an evening in February, 1891, I was seated in the smoking-room of\nthe New Club, Edinburgh, about 11 p.m. I fell asleep, and slept soundly\nfor an hour. During the time I was asleep I had the following very vivid\ndream.\nI dreamt that I was running home as fast as I could to the house in\nAbercromby-place, in which we then lived, fearing I was late for dinner. I\nopened the door with my latch key, and hurried upstairs to dress ; about\nhalf way up, I looked down and saw my father standing in the hall, looking\nup at me. At this point I awoke, and, finding that it was a few minutes\npast twelve, p.m., I rose immediately from my chair and went home.\nOn my arrival I was astonished to find that the house was lighted up,\nand my father and one of my brothers searching the rooms, and calling\nfor me.\nMy father, on seeing me, expressed much surprise, and asked whence I\nhad come. I explained that I had only just returned from the club. He\nthen asked me if I had not come in about twelve o'clock, and on my replying\nin the negative, told me the following facts.\nHe had, as was his custom, been sitting in his smoking-room, and about\ntwelve rose from his chair, intending to go to bed. On opening the door,\nwhich led into the hall, he heard the front door shut, and distinctly saw me\nhurriedly cross the hall and run upstairs, and, looking up, saw me glance\ndown at him and disappear. He went to his room and remarked to my\nmother that he had locked the front door, as I had come in. My mother\nsaid she thought he must be mistaken, for, had I returned, I would not have\npassed her room without wishing her good night. My father confidently\naffirmed that he had seen me enter the house, but, as my mother was still\nunconvinced, he went to my room, and, finding it unoccupied, he called my\nbrother and began to search for me. While they were thus engaged I\nactually returned. My father was so certain that he had seen me that it was\nsome time before I could convince him that I had only just returned, and I\nshall never forget our mutual mystification at this strange occurrence.\nArthur Hamilton Boyd.\nSt. Boswells, N. B. [December 18th, 1897.]\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., 1898.\nI remember the occurrence which my son, the Rev. Arthur Hamilton\nBoyd, Clerk in Holy Orders, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, has narrated above,\nand can testify to the accuracy of the statement. It was frequently\nafterwards alluded to by my husband, the late Sir John Boyd.\nMaxpoffle, St. Boswells, March 28th, 1898.\nOn the former of these two cases Mr. Myers made some remarks,\nmainly to the following purport :\u2014\nThis case of Mrs. Blaikie's combines two of the most interesting\ncharacteristics which these narratives can possess. It is reciprocal,\nand it is also collective. That is to say, in the first place, it involves a\nperception at both ends of the chain,\u2014on the part of the person who\ncauses the phenomenon as well as on the part of those who perceive it.\nSuch cases have much value, as letting us to some extent into the\nmechanism of the transference, as it appears to the persons concerned.\nThey cannot, indeed, know what is really happening ; since the\nprocess goes on, in my view, in an environment to which their supra\nliminal selves have no clear access. Yet we may guess something\nfrom the sensations which find their way upwards, at sucli crises, into\nordinary consciousness.\nAgain, the case is what we call collective, inasmuch as the per-\ncipience was shared by several persons ; as though some common cause\nhad affected all of them. In some sense this must be so in any\ngenuine collective case ; the event at a distance must needs produce\ndirectly or indirectly all the phantasms which represent it. But it\nmay produce these effects directly in one percipient only, and indirectly\nin the rest, \u2014they receiving the impression telepathically from the\nprimary percipient. This view was defended both in Phantasms of the\nLiving and in the \" Report on the Census of Hallucinations \" (Pro\nceedings, Vol. X.), and, if accepted, it does certainly avoid a serious\ndifficulty. It avoids, or at least postpones, the question of the relation\nof a disembodied spirit to space ; with which is associated the question\nof the relation of a disembodied spirit,\u2014I do not say to an \" etherial\norganism \"\u2014but to any localisable centre of force.\nYet, as our evidence accumulates, this postponed question forces\nitself more and more into notice, through several lines of suggestion.\nI have here to consider one line of suggestion alone,\u2014 which follows\nnaturally from the case just quoted.\nWhat, in the case of any psychical transfer, is the agent's own\nsubjective impression of what has occurred 1 I do not say that his\nimpression is exactly evidential, \u2014it may be of a quite dream-like or\nmuch-refracted type,\u2014but if any one type seems to prevail among\n\fDec, 1808.] General Meeting. 323\nmany percipients, that very fact should have some instruction for us.\nThe agent's impressions, as we know, are less often accessible for us\nthan the percipient's. It many cases the agents death follows close\non the apparition ; at other times no trace of the subliminal com\nmunication rises into his waking mind. Yet \" agents \" have by this\ntime given us a good many accounts, both of their clairvoyant\nexperiences, unshared by any percipient, and of their sensations in\nreciprocal cases, \u2014that is, at the moment when they were, in fact,\ncausing a phantasm which one or more percipients observed. It is\nwith this latter group of narratives that we are at present con\ncerned.\nMrs. Blaikie tells us what she felt or imagined, at a moment when\nfive persons, in three separate rooms, heard what they took to be her\nstep in a passage. Let us consider what feeling on her part would\nhave suited each of the theories above mentioned. If, for instance,\nher feeling had simply been one of close spiritual contact with one of\nher daughters, that would have fitted in with the notion that this\ndaughter was the primary percipient ; that this daughter's mind had\nprobably translated some vague telepathic impression into the familiar\nsound of her mother's footstep ; while the other percipients, \u2014though\nin different rooms of the house, \u2014-had caught that hallucination\nfrom her.\nIn fact, however, Mrs. Blaikie's own experience was not at all like\nthis. She did not think of her daughter, nor did she feel in special\ncloseness to any spirit. She felt two things, \u2014a deliverance from\nbodily distress, and a presence in a particular locality. These feelings\ndo not, I think, suit the strictly telepathic explanation so well as they\nsuit my alternative suggestion of a \" phantasmogenetic centre\"\n{Phantasms of the Living), the modification by the agent of an actual\npoint in space, whence certain unknown influences (not air-waves nor\nlight-rays) are diffused, which are by us recognisable only through\ntheir influence upon certain sensitive organisations. Let us try to\nrealise this complicated notion rather more closely. In the first place,\nI should accept the sense of momentary freedom from bodily obstruc\ntion as in itself an important fact, indicating that there was a scission\nof personality, and that a portion of the personality not closely linked\nwith the organism became, for the time being, prepotent in conscious\nness. This fits in well with the view to which I have been of late\nyears gradually led, that we may often get nearer the truth by thinking\nof scissions ofpersonality as operative in these psychical incidents than\nby keeping strictly to our old notion of telepathic messages despatched\nfrom one to another mind.\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., 1898.\nIf, however, we speak of a scission of personality in such a case as\nMrs. Blaikie's, how can we define that fragment or element of her\npersonality which manifested itself only by the sound of footsteps in\na passage ; by the very phenomena which the unbodied personality\ncould not be expected to produce ? This must have been a symbolic\nmanifestation ; how are we to reconcile symbolical appearances with\nanything like an actual presence ? If this spiritual element of Mrs.\nBlaikie showed itself as footsteps, as what might it or might it not\nhave shown itself 1 This question has often already been discussed in\na different form,\u2014when we have speculated whether the details of\nthe form assumed by a phantasm were fashioned by the mind of the\nagent or of the percipient. I regard such details as generally coming\nfrom the agent, although not in most cases consciously chosen. They\nexpress, I think, a path of least resistance ; an organised habit of\nsubconsciously conceiving one's personality or Wesen in a particular\nway. Thus, although we may pay little attention to the sound of our\nown steps, it would surprise us much if that habitual sound were to\nchange suddenly ; and one's idea of one's own footfall is in a sense\nmore intimate than any intellectual preoccupation. Somewhat\nsimilarly I have observed that slight interruptions of lifelong habit, to\nwhich one hardly gave a waking thought, are more likely to recur in\ndreams than events of more rational interest. I suggest, then, that\nthe possible range of self-manifestation for one of these fractions of\npersonality is limited to a certain set of familiar symbols, which work\nthemselves out in quasi-automatic fashion ; like Mrs. Blaikie's quick\ndecided footfall in the passage of her house. But in what way do they\nwork themselves out ? If there really is this translocation of a frag\nment of personality, how is it manifested to several percipients, if it\nbe neither a direct influence of one mind on another, nor an actual\ndisturbance of the natural order of things ? What is the suggested\ncompromise between the mental and the molecular ?\nWhat I suggest is, in my view, not so much a compromise as a\ndimly apprehended reconciliation. I suggest that a modification of\nspace was effected by Mrs. Blaikie, but a modification of space which\ndid not modify matter, and probably did not modify ether, at least in\nany way which established science can parallel. There is no a priori\nimprobability in such a conjecture ; rather it would be absurd to\nsuppose that we already know all the ways in which space can be\nmodified. I suggest, then, that a translocation of a part of Mrs.\nBlaikie's personality did actually change a special part of space in its\nrelation to human intelligence. The change was not expressible in\nterms of matter and motion ; it was not necessarily perceptible to\n\fDec., 1898.] Obituary. 325\nhuman ears, nor to a phonograph ; but it was perceptible by certain\nincarnate intelligences not wholly bounded by acoustic or optical limi\ntations. The metetherial change translated itself into quasi-acoustic\nphenomena, just as material changes may translate themselves into\n\" real \" sounds or etherial changes into light. From that particular\npoint of space a stimulus was transmitted which would affect certain\nhuman organisms (not necessarily all healthy human organisms) in a\nspecial supersensory way.\nThe conception of a phantasmogenetic centre, then, involves some\nthing which transcends the special forms of the senses, but which does\nnot transcend or nullify space. Surely this is reasonable enough.\nThe special senses have been slowly elaborated by our pre-human\nancestry on this planet. They cannot survive bodily dissolution in\nanything like their present forms. Space, on the other hand, what\never its ultimate significance may be, is a much wider conception,\naffecting, at any rate, the whole etherial and material universe,\nwith all its unknown grades of conscious life. If there be in us men\na perceptive power beyond the ordinary senses, there seems no reason\nwhy that power should lose hold at once of this vast generalisation.\nA spirits powers may not be limited or determined by space, as\nour bodily powers are limited. But a spirit need not, therefore, lose\nthe sense of space ; any more than a man born blind, and acquiring\nsight, loses in his widened faculty the old power of feeling his way, on\nwhich he once wholly depended.\nI have here used the word \" spirit \" with reference to a certain\nfraction or element in a still incarnate personality. It is obvious that\nthe same line of argument would continue to apply even if that special\nelement in the personality, or something like it, were alone surviving.\nIf Mrs. Blaikie had died suddenly at the moment of the noise in the\npassage, that noise might, for all we know, have continued just the\nsame ; although we should then have to define the phantasmogenetic\ncentre as due, not to the translocation of an element of an embodied\npersonality, but to the haunting of a ghost.\nOBITUARY.\nTHE REV. ALFRED GURNEY, M.A\nOur readers will learn with regret the death of the Rev. Alfred\nGurney, who died on November 28th, at the age of 55. He was a\nbrother of Edmund Gurney,\u2014the value of whose work, in the earlier\nyears of our Society, is known to all our readers,\u2014and had himself\n\f326 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

We extract the\nfollowing account of him and his literary work from the Athenaeum of\nDecember 3rd :\u2014\nA writer of religious verse of more than common merit, the Rev. Alfred\nGurney, died last Monday at Roehampton. He was a son of the Rev.\nHampden Gurney, a well-known hymn-writer, and a nephew of Mr. Russell\nGurney, Recorder of London. Mr. Gurney's publications included The\nVision of the Eucharist, and other Poems, Day Dreams, and A Christmas\nFaggot, a little book of particularly beautiful and serious verse. He wrote\nalso a study of Wagner's Parsifal, and though a High Churchman, he gave a\nlecture, and afterwards published it, entitled \" Our Catholic Inheritance in\nthe Larger Hope,\" which even broad Churchmen might have charged with\nuniversalism.\nCASES.\nG. 259.\nThe following account of the apparition of a suicide has been re\nceived from the percipient. Mrs. O'Donnell had been living for some\nmonths in Brighton previous to March, 1898, but never saw the local\npapers, and had not seen any account of the suicide. In conversation\n(with Mr. R. W. Buttemer, who saw her on the part of the S.P.R.) she\nstated that she had never seen anything of the kind, nor had any\nwaking hallucination before. The fact of her engaging the rooms\nseems in itself enough to show that she had no knowledge of what had\nrecently occurred in them.\nOn March 22nd last, 1898, I went into furnished rooms in one of the\nroads at Hove, Brighton. They were large and well-furnished, and seemed\ncomfortable. We were promised good attendance, and I congratulated my\nself on feeling I should be able to stay there some time. As the evening\nwore on, a strange sense of cold and gloom seemed to pervade the place, and\nan unaccountable feeling of desolation came over me. I ordered a good fire\nin my bedroom and retired early, saying I feared I had got a chill. I hoped a\ngood night's rest would make me all right again. I was scarcely in bed an hour\nwhen I was awoke by heavy footsteps overhead, and so loud did they become\nI almost fancied they were in my room\u2014in fact I felt as if it was full of\npeople. The noise continued all night, only ceasing with bright daylight.\nWhen the maid came into my room at 8 a.m., I said, \" Those are very noisy\npeople up-stairs.\" She looked astonished, and said, \" No one is up-stairs ;\nall the house there is vacant.\" The landlady also assured me of the same\nthing. Yet I was certain I heard the walking about. All the next day I\nfelt ill and strangely depressed ; so that, although I never believed in such a\nthing before, I felt the house must be haunted. That night the same noises\ncontinued, but, it possible, louder. It was impossible to sleep, and on trying\nto get up in the morning, I felt too ill and could not. The third night I had\n\fDec, 1808.] Cases. 327\na large fire made up, and had a night-light for company. About 11 p.m.\nmy daughter went to her own room, wishing me a better night. Again the\nfeeling of footsteps overhead\u2014so much so that a perfect thrill of terror ran\nthrough me. I kept looking towards the fire for about an hour, and then\nthought I should turn towards the wall, where, terrible to relate, a horrible\nfigure was standing by my bedside, one arm pointing to the adjoining room\n(then vacant), and the other pointing to me, quite close to my face. I gasped\nfor breath, and covered my face with the clothes. After some time I re\nassured myself it was all imagination, and again turned to where I saw the\nhorrid apparition. There it still was. I shrieked for terror, and called out,\n\"Oh, my God, what is it ? \" and put out my left hand as if to feel if it was\nreal, but imagine my horror, I was grasped by the icy hand of death. I re\nmember no more. My daughter came to my room at an early hour; but I\ncould not speak for a long time. On hearing the terrible story she said it\nwas dreadful, and that I should not sleep in that room again, and that she\nwould change with me. The figure I saw was that of a rather small man,\nvery dark, with very small hands, and covered in a tattered black suit from\nhead to foot, more like a scarecrow than anything human. I slept in my\ndaughter's room the next night, or rather occupied it, for I could not sleep.\nTowards the middle of the night the door opened (I had locked it). A\nsmall, dark, gentlemanly young man walked in, saying, \" Oh, so you have\nthe Scotchman's room ! \"\u2014smiled pleasantly, and walked out of the room\nas he had come in. It was all so strange and dreadful. I told some friends\nnext day. They were greatly startled, and said, \"Can this be the house\nwhere a suicide happened a few weeks ago 1 \" I at once called up the land\nlady. She denied it, saying it was next door. I was determined to find out,\nand on sending to the various tradespeople with whom we dealt, found it\nwas the very house. The landlady then admitted it. The poor young man\nhad slept in my bedroom, and the adjoining room (to which he had pointed)\nwas his sitting-room, from the window of which he threw himself out. He\nwas killed on the spot. The landlady's son waited on us at table. On\ninvestigating the matter with him and his mother afterwards, I found his\ndescription of the poor young fellow corresponded with the apparition I saw.\nHe was four-and-twenty, rather small, and very dark. He had had bad\nbronchitis, and became depressed. On the morning of his death he got up\nrather early, saying he felt better, and when his family left him he imme\ndiately opened his window, and threw himself out. He fell from a second-\nfloor window into the area. His clothes were torn to pieces as he fell. On\ninquiry as to the Scotchman's room, the landlady told mo a young Scotch\ngentleman (now in the service) had occupied our drawing-room and that bed\nroom which I changed to\u2014and that he was a great friend of the poor young\nfellow who had ended his life in such a dreadful manner. The landlady\nalso admitted she would not go up stairs after dark alone, so she also\nmust have considered the house haunted. I can certify all I have stated is\nstrictly true.\nMary O'Donnell.\nSeptember oth, 189S.\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dec., 1898.\nOn the first occasion the phantom had its face averted, was very\ndark, including the hands and head, and was apparently in tattered\ngarments.

He was formerly a\nclerk in the employ of Messrs. Robins and Sons, of Waterloo-street. He\nhad suffered from asthma all his life, but on Friday week he had a very\nsevere attack, which confined him to bed. He had also been a little\ndelirious. His mother had been sleeping in the same room. On Saturday\nmorning she left the room to go to her own apartment, and directly she\nreached her room she heard his brother lock the door. She called witness,\nwho at once forced the door open, and saw his brother climbing on to the\nwindow-sill. He disappeared just before witness reached him. He was\nonly dressed in his nightshirt at the time. Witness went downstairs, and,\nwith the help of the servant, carried deceased indoors. He had never\nattempted to take his life before, and had not threatened to do so. When\npicked up he was breathing slightly, but died almost immediately after.\nMr. Richard Hughes, L.R.C.P., practising at Silwood Road, Brighton,\ndeposed to having known deceased for about fifteen years. Deceased had\nbeen subject to attacks of asthma, from which he used to suffer very\nseverely. Witness had not seen him for two years or more. The brother\ncame for witness on Saturday morning last, and told him what had\nhappened. On going to the house he found the young man was dead. The\ncause of death he attributed to shock. Deceased had evidently fallen on\nhis left side, as the left arm was broken, the head being quite uninjured,\nsave for a blow on the nose, which might have been caused by striking\nagainst something in the fall.

(Pp. 82\u20143 and 88). The Governor-\nGeneral's party had left Ottawa on June 10th, 1873, and were touring\nabout at the mouth of the St. Lawrence. On the 30th they were at\nMingan. Lord and Lady Dufferin, and a small party, had started off\nearly, up the river, salmon fishing. After describing the morning's\nwork, Lady Dufferin says :\u2014\nWe were just going to begin fishing again, when an Indian canoe arrived\nbringing us very sad news. One of our footmen had gone out fishing, and\nwas drowned. We returned immediately. We saw the place where the\naccident happened ; on the rocks lay a piece of bread he had been eating.\nHe had got up and stood at the edge of the water with his rod. The steward\nsaid, ' ' Can you swim 1 \" \"No.\" \" Then take care, for it is slippery and the\nwater is very deep.\" \"Never fear,\" he said, and instantly slipped. He\nput up his hands to take off a mosquito-veil he had on, and disappeared.\nThe steward dived after him, but he never rose at all. A boat was got, and\npresently the men saw the thick end of a fishing-rod sticking up. They\ntook hold of it, and lifted the poor dead body up with it. He appeared to\nbe upright in the water, the rod fast in his hand.\nUnder date of July 11th, \u2014when near Gaspe,\u2014Lady Dufferin\nwrites :\u2014\nYou remember that I told you that a poor manservant of ours was\ndrowned at the Mingan. As we knew nothing about his people, we were\nunable to communicate the news of his death to them, so D. [Lord Dufferin]\nordered any letters that might arrive for him to be brought to himself. The\nfirst of these\u2014which we have just received\u2014was from a servant girl he was\nattached to at Ottawa, and was dated exactly seven days after the date of the\naccident.

My dress Jack had never seen, and I am not\nin the habit of wearing my chain outside my dress. As for the boots they\nwere a pair I had not worn for years, because they were in the habit of\ncreaking.\nI went to the door to wait for my cousin, who was a long time saying\n\"good night\" to a friend, and while there I was thinking deeply of Jack as\nI had not received his morning letter. We made an agreement when he\nwent to boarding school that we would think of one another every night and\nalso say \" good night.\"\n(Signed) Annie E. Challacombe.\nAugust, 1898.\nIn reply to further enquiries, Master Challacombe writes thus :\u2014\nAugust 27th, 1898.\nI had never had any psychical experience before, and mother has never\nexperienced anything of the kind either. As to the door of the bedroom\nbeing open, I do not know anything about that. It is situated at the bottom\nof the stairs, so practically there is no door to the bedroom. Most probably\nit was shut, but I did not hear it open. As to the date, I remember it was\na Sunday evening. I wrote home to mother the following Saturday, and\nshe thought it was a strange coincidence, as she was away, and the date was\nMarch 20th. When I was home at Easter she questioned me about it.\nJ.
