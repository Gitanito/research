Jan., 1923.\nOBSERVATIONS ON MR. PRICE'S SITTING WITH\nMR. HOPE.\nThe issue of Light of the 25tli November, 1922, contains an\narticle contributed by Mr. Hewat M'Kenzie, and entitled,\n\" Total Collapse of the Price-Hope Case.\" This article is of\na most misleading nature, and at the request of the Council\nwe sent a short reply to Light at the first opportunity. In\nfairness, however, to the various Members of the Society\ncriticised in the article, we feel that we ought to set before\nthe Society as a whole a more detailed resume of the facts\nand of the conclusions which we think should be drawn from\nthem.\nIn the May Journal of the S.P.R. Mr. Price described in\ndetail an experiment with Mr. Hope, for the purpose of which\na packet of six plates, each containing a mark which would\nonly appear on development, was prepared by the Imperial\nDry Plate Co.\nThe plates were sent by the Company to Mr. Price in a\npostal packet, within which was a close-fitting brown paper\nwrapper, the ends of which were stuck down, a paper label\nbeing pasted so as to cover the ends of both flaps. Inside\nthis wrapper was the box containing the plates.\nMr. Price received this packet on the 30th January, and\nhanded it, as it was received by him, to Mr. Moger, a neigh-\nbour, who put it in a large envelope, which he sealed. Out-\nside this again Mr. Moger put a postal wrapper, and posted\nthe packet to the S.P.R. There were, therefore, at this stage\nfour wrappers outside the box\u2014Mr. Moger's postal wrapper,\nhis sealed envelope, the Company's postal wrapjjer, and the\nCompany's labelled wrapper. When received by the S.P.R.\nthe packet remained in the charge first of the Secretary and\nthen of the Research Officer of the S.P.R., until it was\ndehvered by the Research Officer, exactly as received from\nMr. Moger, to Mr. Price on the morning, and very shortly\nbefore the sitting of February 24th.\nMr. Dingwall then removed Mr. Moger's postal wrapper and\nhis sealed envelope, and the packet was taken to the British\nCollege of Psychic Science and laid before Mr. Hope and\n\fJan'., 1923. Observations on Mr. Price's Sitting with Mr. Hope. 5\nMrs. Buxton in the postal wrapper in whicli it had been\ndespatched by the Company. This postal wrapper was then\nremoved in their presence, and in the presence of Mr. Seymour\nW'ho accompanied Mr. Price, and the labelled wrapper was\nclosely scrutinised by both Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton. Mr.\nHope gave Mr. Price a dark slide to examine, and Mr. Price\nmade certain secret marks on it. Finally, in the dark room\nMr. Hope cut open the labelled wrapper, and two plates from\nthe packet were loaded into the marked slide.\nMr. Price observed that the shde put subsequently into the\ncamera was not marked. Two exposures were taken at the\nsitting, and on the two plates being developed the marks\naffixed by the Company appeared on neither of them.\nAfter despatch by the Company the plates passed through\nthe hands of four persons\u2014Mr. Price, Mr. Moger, the Secretary\nand the Research Officer. Each of them declares positively\nthat he or she did not in any way tamper \\vith the outer\nw^rapping as he or she received it, except that, as already\nstated, Mr. Dingwall removed Mr. Moger's postal wrapper and\nsealed envelope on handing the plates to Mr. Price, who at the\nCollege removed the Company's postal wrapper. Since the\npubhcation of the article in Light we have questioned Mr.\nPrice, Mr. Seymour, the Research Officer and the Secretary\nin detail, and we have seen a written statement by Mr. Moger,\nAvho is in poor health, as to his part in the transaction. There\nis no discrepancy between the accounts given by any of them,\nand, as regards what took place at the College in the presence\nof Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton, Mr. Price's account is con-\nfirmed by Mr. Seymour.\nAs they are all responsible persons, their first-hand evidence\ncannot be rejected, unless clear contradictory evidence can be\nadduced.\nMr. M'Kenzie attempts to discredit their evidence by stating\nthat, when on the 5th of November he first examined the\nCompany's labelled Avrapper, he saw signs that the label had\nbeen disturbed, and by quoting a letter of the 13th November\nfrom the Company, in which they state that they are \" of\nopinion that one end of the label has been unstuck from the\n\\frapper and folded back, so as to leave the '\near ' of the\nA 2\n\f6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1923.\nbrown paper wrapping uncovered. This '\near '\nalso appears to\nshow signs of having been unstuck and refolded.\" The\nsuggestion obviously made by Mr. M'Kenzie is that the labelled\nwrapper was tampered wdth before the sitting of the 24th\nFebruary by some one of the four persons who had then had\npossession of the packet, and unless this can be shown, the\nwhole of Mr. M'Kenzie's case falls to the ground.\nThe labelled wrapper, which is the property of the S.P.R.,\nhas, together with several other articles relating to the case\nlent by the S.P.R., been most improperly retained by the\nCollege, notwithstanding requests by the Council of the S.P.R.\nfor its return. It has admittedly been subjected to much\nrough usage since it was first opened ; it was left lying about\nduring the sitting, at the close of which it was crammed into\nMr. Price's pocket, and it has since been in the hands of\nnumerous persons, as appears from Mr. M'Kenzie's report.\nOn the evidence before us (and two of us have never seen\nthe wrapper at any stage) we cannot say with certainty that\nthe marks on the wrapper were not innocently produced by\ntliis rough usage. For the purpose of argument, however, we\nare prepared to assume that the labelled wrapper has in fact\nbeen tampered with at some time.\nNow, neither Mr. M'Kenzie himself, nor his Committee, nor\nthe manufacturers of the plates, whom we have questioned as\nto the meaning of their letter of the 13th November, claim\nthat the present state of the wrapper shows that the assumed\ntampering took place before any date earlier than the 4th of\nNovember, when Mr. M'Kenzie took charge of it, and, as\nalready stated, unless it can be shown to have taken place\nbefore the 24th February, there is a \" total collapse \" of Mr.\nM'Kenzie's case.\nIt can, we tliink, on the contrary, be proved beyond all\nreasonable doubt that the Company's labelled wrapper did not\nat the time of the sitting bear the marks of \" tampering\n\"\nwhich it now bears.\nIf, as the suggestion apparently is, the labelled wrapper was\nopened for the purpose of extracting two of the Imperial Dry\nPlate Company's marked plates, and substituted two unmarked\nplates, this scheme could only succeed if Mr. Price, who\n\fJan., 1923. Observations on Mr. Price's Sitting ivith Mr. Hope. 7\nselected the two plates taken from the box at the sitting,\nwere at least privy to it. Otherwise the chances were four-\nteen to one that at least one of the two plates selected would\nhave been a marked one, and at least one unmarked plate\nwould have been left in the box and discovered afterwards\nwhen developed (.see S.P.R. Journal, pj). 281-2).\nNow, Mr. Price is a skilled \" magician,\" and it is incon-\nceivable that, if he had been a party to a fraud of this kind,\nhe would have carried it out, or allowed a collaborator to\ncarry it out, so clumsily as to invite immediate detection by\nMr. Hope or Mrs. Buxton.\nBut if, for the sake of argument, even this degree of\nclumsiness and stupidity on his part be assumed, is it credible\nthat any one fraudulent enough to be a party to such a\nscheme should not have taken the first opportimity of covering\nup his tracks, either by cutting the wrapper open at the\nsitting in such a way as to obliterate all trace that it had\nbeen tampered with, or by destroying the wrapper, the pre-\nservation of wliich was not necessary to prove liis case 1 The\nfact that Mr. Price adopted neither of these courses appears\nto us conclusive evidence, were any needed, of his bona\nfides.\nIt is not, however, necessary to explore Mr. Price's hypo-\nthetical motives, as both Mr. Price and Mr. Seymour testify\nthat the packet was carefully examined by Mr. Hope and\nMrs. Buxton, who apparently saw nothing suspicious in the\ncondition of the wrapper.\nMoreover, Mr. M'Kenzie's article does not in any way meet\nMl'. Price's evidence that the sHde used for the exposure was\nnot the sUde into which he had placed the two plates. Unless\nit can be shown that this is a pure invention on his part, it\nis quite immaterial whether or not the manufacturers' label\nhad been tampered with.\nWe do not feel called upon to make any suggestion as to\nthe time when, or the person by whom, the crease and other\nsuspicious marks, stated now to be visible on the wrapper,\nwere produced. Since the wrapper was lent to the College\nseveral persons appear to have had access to it. The direct\nrequest of the Council for information as to what has happened\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 3923.\nto it since it left the Society's hands has not yet been\nanswered.\nIt is, however, significant that the insinuations as to the\nwrapper having been tamj)ered with were only made when\nother attempts to discredit Mr. Price's report had broken\ndown, and apparently as an afterthought. No request by\nMr. M'Kenzie for the loan of the wrapper was made until\nthe 23rd of October.\nMr. M'Kenzie airily dismisses as \" frivolous \" all questions\nas to the plate bearing the Imperial Dry Plate Co.'s mark\nwhich came into the Society's possession after the sitting, as\nstated on p. 282 of the May Journal. Tliis plate was\ncontained in one of two anonymous packets purporting to\ncome from the College, and we see no reason whatever to\ndoubt that they in fact did so. It is not difficult to suppose\nthat the sender of the anonymous packet was aware of Mr.\nPrice's experiment ; for according to Mr. Price's account two\nmarked plates were left at the CoUege in the dark shde into\nwhich they were loaded. Only one of them has been returned.\nThe other may well have been developed at the College by\nMr. Hope himself, who would thus become aware of its being\nmarked, and that, therefore, Mr. Price must have discovered\nthe substitution practised on him. That the S.P.R. might\nknow something of the matter would be a not unreasonable\nconjecture, Mr. Price being a member of it.\nThe real significance, in our opinion, of the \" anonymous\n\"\nplate is that it is a complete disj)roof of the suggestion at\none time put forward that the two plates exposed at the\nsitting might have been two of the plates marked by the\nCompany, and that the non-appearance of the marks was due\nto faulty exposure and\/or development. This suggestion\nis otherwise negatived by Mr. Price's evidence as to the\nchange of slides. But, putting this aside for the moment,\nand also disregarding for the moment the fact that the\nevidence is altogether against faulty exposure or de-\nvelopment, and the remarkable difference in thickness\nbetween the exposed plate brought back from the sitting and\nall the four unexposed plates, the suggestion would be possible\nonly if the Company had marked nine plates, whereas they\n\fJan., 1923. Ohservations on Mr. Price's Sitting ivith Mr. Hope. 9\nonly marked eight. Seven of tliese are now in tlie Society's\npossession and have been developed. Whence, then, came\nthe two plates exposed and developed at the sitting ?\nIn conclusion, after carefully examining the case afresh, we\nare satisfied that the report contained in the May Journal is\ntrue as regards the facts, and that the inferences there drawn\nfrom the facts are fair and reasonable. In so far as Mr.\nM'Kenzie's article makes insinuations\u2014for no overt charges\nare brought\u2014of mala fides against any of the Members of the\nSociety who took part in the experiment, we consider these\ninsinuations absolutely disproved.\nWe cannot but express our surprise and regret that six\nMembers of the Society should have been found willing to\nsupport Mr. M'Kenzie in his unfounded attacks on their fellow-\nmembers, and in preventing the Society from recovering pro-\nperty voluntarily lent by it.^ Their action in this respect is\nto the best of our knowledge unparalleled in the whole history\n1 Postscript.\u2014Since the above statement was sent to the printers\nfvirther correspondence has taken place between the Society and the\nBritish College of Psychic Science in connexion with a proposal by the\nCommittee of the College to submit the wrapper to a chemist for\nanalysis of the adhesive. In the course of this correspondence Mr.\nM'Kenzie was invited to disclaim any intention of making charges\ninvolving mala fides against any Members or Officials of the S.P.R.\nMr. M'Kenzie personally has omitted to take any notice of this in-\nvitation, but a letter dated 18th December, 1922, from the College\nConmaittee contains the following passage :\n\" No charge of bad faith\nhas been or is being made against any Member or Official of the S.P.R.\nin connexion with the Price-Hope enquiry, but we are quite convinced\nthere has been some questionable dealing of which the S.P.R. as well\nas ourselves may be the victims.\"\nThat insinuations against the good faith of Members and Officials of\nthe S.P.R. were made in Mr. M'Kenzie's article is beyond doubt. If\nand so far as the Committee 'wish, however tardily, to dissociate them-\nselves from Mr. M'Kenzie's insinuations, we welcome their disclaimer.\nWho the mysterioiis person or persons may be who by \" questionable\ndealing \" have -victimised both the S.P.R. and the College Committee\ndoes not interest us deeply.

There is a further point of mterest in\nthat at the hour that the message was obtained Mr. McClure\nin his own home had a strong impression that \" some one\n\"\nwished to commimicate with him and his wife.\nThe first report of the incident reached us in a letter\nfrom Mr. McClure to the Secretary, as follows :\nJune 24, 1922.\nOn Friday night, 2lst April, 1922, about 9 p.m., my wife and\n1 were sitting in our rooms at , Bushey. I got a very\nstrong impression that \" someone was there,\" and said so to my\nwife, but as we both were tired (she especially so), we took\nno further notice. As a rule, when these \" impressions \" come,\nmy wife tries for automatic writing, or (lees frequently) we use\nthe ouija board.\n\fJan., 1923. Case. 11\nNest day, our friend Mr. A. R. [Crane], called round and said\nthat on the previous evening, about 9 p.m., he and his sister\nhad felt urged ^ to go to the ouija board. A. R. C. is very\n\" sensitive,\" but his sister more usually acts as recorder at any\nsittings. On this evening they worked together, and with great\ndifficulty, and very slowly, the following was spelt out. The\nnotes were taken by Miss C.,^ and I copy from her typescript.\nThe message meant nothing to them, but A. R. C. brought it\nround to my wife, wondering if it might be intelligible to us.\nIt was\u2014entirely so.\n\" Am I here for K ?\n\" 2\n(A. R. C. No, K. is not here.)\n\" He is coming \" ?\n(A. R. C. Not that we know of.)\n\" Tell him Mrs. [McClure] is . . . make my daughter try to\nwrite.\"\n(A. R. C. Do you mean Mrs. [McClure] ?)\n\" Yes.\"\n\"\n.\n\u2022\n(A. R. C. Have you failed to make her write when you\nwished to do so ?)\n\" My son must know that we will try to help him.\"\n(A. R. C. We are sure he knows that.)\n\" See if he can come soon to this house. My hope is that\nhe will find his help here.\"\n(A. R. C. asks if it is easier to write here ?) ...\n\" I think he likes to come.\"\n(A. R. C. We went to their rooms to-day, but they were\nout. We had expected to see them, and wondered why\nthey had not turned up.)\n\" He is very worried. Do help him.\"\n(A. R. C. Did you hear me say that we tried to find them\nto-day ?)\n\" Yes. Will you help him to find joy and peace for them\nboth ? Yet my normal thought is that she is helping\nhim.\"\n(A. R. C. notes here that one or two words are doubtful in\nthe foregoing sentence, but that he was unable to get\nthem repeated.)\nSee below Mr. Crane's comment. ^ See below p. 14.\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1923.\n\" My own simple life was easy, his is hard. He, more\nthan she, is needing help. She loves him. . . . pity\nhim . . . fight [confusion here] . . . my own simple life\nwas not more hard work. More trials will come if he\nthinks his father lets him alone. Give him your friend-\nship. He needs hope more than faith, my best wishes\nmore than gifts [sic]. Time is short. Make him come\nhere soon. My destiny is to him more than his wife.\"\n(A. R. C. asked further about the meaning of this last\nsentence.)\n\" Desire is to help him. ...\" -\n(A. R. C. suggests \" more than his wife ? \")\n\"Yes.\"\n(A. R. C. That is most natural, we tliink.)\n\"Now she will make him happy; this is all I wish. You\nare tired. My thanks to you.\"\n. . . The time of the message (circa 9 p.m. on April 22) coincides\nwith the time when I got my \" impression.\" The opening\nwords \" make my daughter try to write \" are apposite, as that\nis just what she had refused to do, and it is worth noting that\nin all communications from my father, he always refers to my\nwife as \" my daughter,\" not \" my daughter-in-law \"\u2014a fact\nof which A. R. C!. was ignorant.\nThe whole burden of the message (the desire to \" help \" me)\nis singularly appropriate, as I was going into London practically\nevery day for a course of treatment by a doctor, and it is\nquite true that his own life, which was strenuous but very\nsuccessful, was \" not more hard work \" than my own, hampered\nby ill-health, has always been. Of this, too, A. R. C. was\nignorant.\nThis is the first time A. R. 0. has ever had a communication\nfrom him (or read one that has come to us), and yet that phrase\n\" not more hard work \" is typical of my father's \" style \" over\nthe board. He will never use the board if he can get my wife\nto write, and when he does, he shows an extraordinary fondness,\nfor comparatives like \" more hard \" and for monosyllables be-\nginning with \" m \" or \" n.\" This has been very noticeable.\nWill you please let me know what you think of it, and ask\nany questions you like ?\n\fJan., 1923. Case. 13\nIn reply to this Miss Newton wrote to J\\Ir. McClure as\nfollows :\n1st July, 1922.\n. . . The important point is hoxv much knowledge Mr. A. R. C.\nhad of your trouble and need of \" help.\" I note that it is\nthe only communication purporting to come from your father\nthat he had received, and that he had not seen any of the\ncommunications which you had received. Do you and your\nwife often get communications purporting to come from your\nfather and, if so, are they similar to those in question now ? I\nam wondering whether there can have been any telepathic rapport\nin the case.\nTo this letter Mr. McClure replied thus :\nm, 1 . J^'hj 3, 1922.\nlhank you for yours of the 1st inst.\nI note that you say, \"the important point is how much\nknowledge Mr. A. R. C. had of your trouble and need of \u2022\nhelp.'\n\"\nI don't think he had any real knowledge of it at all. He\nknew that we were not well off, but the trouble to which my\nfather refers is another matter entirely. It has to do with a\ncourse of treatment I am undergoing for the relief of an obstinate\nneurotic condition, and I don't think he even knew I was under\ntreatment, or how hopeless I at times became of a really satis-\nfactory cure. I really know him only slightly, through going\nto his house now and again to attend ouija sittings. Both\nmy wife and myself are fairly cheerful individuals, and naturally\ndo not refer either to monetary difficulties or illness of any\nkind among people whom we know only slightly. I do not\nthink that anything either in the manner or speech of either\nof us would give Mr. [Crane] any idea of how great our need\nof \" help \" of various kinds has often been. . . . What struck\nme about the whole thing was, that on the evening in question,\nI was feeling sjKciallij depressed, my wife was too tired to\nattempt to write, and my impression of someone \"wanting to\nget through \" was unusually vivid and insistent.\nA. R. C. has never seen any communications from my father.\n[I am taking it, argumenti causa, that the communicator is my\nfather, as it simpHfies writing.] They are all of a purely private\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, Jan., 1923.\nnature, referring to our difficulties, or (on one occasion very\n\" evidentially \") to his own domestic affairs. He has occasionally\ncome to the board at A. R. C s but it has invariably been\n\" I cannot speak before these people. Get Ella [my wife] to\nwrite.\" He has (1) the greatest contempt for, and objection\nto, the board as a means of communication. It is apparently\nvery difficult to him to communicate in that way. Witness the\npeculiar, crabbed style to which I referred in my previous letter,\nand the fact that the short typed message I sent you, took over\nan hour to come through. (2) The only third person before\nwhom he will \" speak freely \" is our friend Mr. P K ,\nand of him too, he was at first extremely \" shy.\" On Sept. 6,\n1921, he came through the board for the first time when my\nwife and P. K. were sitting. I was recording, and my notes\nrun, \" [McClure] I am your father. Why have you him, K ?\nHim I do not know. Will he mind you talking ?\n\" He is now\n'\nbroke '\nto P. K., but still objects to the board.\nAfter A. R.

Best.\nII. Oisr \" An Experimental Study of the Appreciation of time\nBY SoMNAMBULES \" (read before S.P.E. by Mr. S. E. Hooijer, M.A.).\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.E..\nMadam,\u2014It does not appear to me that Mr. Hooper's experi-\nments, extremely interesting though they be, have at all\nsolved the question as to whether somnambules possess any\nintuitive sense of the passage of tinw, or whether they calculate\nthis by some mechanical means, such as by counting. Further,\nI am of opinion that the long interval experiments described by\nMr. Hooper are not of a nature to lead to any definite conclusion.\nFor it does seem very probable that in these experiments the\nsubject did, either immediately the suggestion was given, or shortly\nafter, make a simple calculation by mental arithmetic, reducing\nthe thousands of minutes to hours and a fraction (in minutes)\nof an hour, and then calculated the day, and the hour by the\nclock, at which the suggestion should be acted upon. This is\nan entirely reasonable method, and one which would undoubtedly\nbe adopted by any person in their normal condition, although\nhe might have to use paper and pencil to make the calculation.\nIt transpired during the discussion that followed the paper\nthat the subject either knew the time by the clock at which\nthe suggestion was given, or knew it approximately, and the\nerrors made seemed to have a definite ratio to the degree of\naccuracy with which the time at which the suggestion was given\nwas known to the subject.\nIt also transpired that in most cases the somnambule had\naccess to a timepiece at the time at which the suggestion had\nto be carried out, while on the occasions on v\/hich she had\nnot such access she had verified the time shortly before.\nNow whether in this latter case the subject estimated the\ntime remaining by counting, or by some other mechanical method,\nor appreciated the time through an intuitive sense, there is nothing\nin the experiments to show, and that is just the question to be solved.\n\f18 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. Jan., 1923.\nIn any case it would seem unnecessary to assume that a\nsomnambule counts day and night for say 5080 minutes, and for\npurposes of investigation short time experiments would appear to\nbe better than long time ones and more convenient.\nNow, we, in civilized countries, are accustomed to appreciate\ntime by the movement of the hands of a clock or by the ticking\nof a clock, but the division of the cycle of day and night into\n24 hours, of the hour into 60 minutes, and of the minute into\n60 seconds is convenient but purely arbitrary, and is not even\nabsolutely correct astronomically.\nStill, civUized people have become so accustomed to this division\nof time that it is possible that they may estimate time consciously\nor unconsciously by counting seconds, and indeed many photo-\ngraphers can count seconds up to 40 with an error of not more\nthan 1 or 1^ per cent. Whether they could continue for any\nconsiderable length of time, say for 10 minutes, is doubtful ;\nit would probably become too irksome, but perhaps their siib-\nconscious would not find it too tiresome. It would be of interest\nto ascertain whether a somnambule accustomed to count in seconds\nis more accurate than others.\nThere exist, however, on the Earth many peoples who still\nknow nothing about the clock, or the subdivision of the day\ninto hours, minutes, and seconds. Obviously, to tell a somnambule\nof this kind to perform an act in say 45 minutes would convey\nnothing to his mind. If he were to perform the act correctly\n(in a number of experiments) one would be led to suspect the\ndirect impulse of the hyjonotiser's mind on that of the subject\nabout the nioment the act should be carried out. Experiments\nof this kind would be very interesting. People who do not use\nor know of a clock, estimate the passage of time in various\nother ways, such as by the relative position of the sun, or by\nthe time it takes to perform some familiar act, such as the\ncooking of a pot of rice. It would be of extreme interest if\nexperiments of the same kind as those of Dr. Mitchell and Mr.\nHooper were carried out by qualified and competent men with\nsomnambules unacquainted with clock time.\nAs the ordinary estimates of time by such persons are necessarily\ninaccurate compared with our appreciations of time, one would\nnot expect any great degree of accuracy in the carrying out\nof a suggestion, but if it should be proved that they did in fact\n\fJan., 192;^. Correspondev ce. 19\ncarry out the suggestion given in their own terms of time, with\nan accuracy transcending chance, care being taken of course that\nthey were exchided from the observation of the events by which\nthey normally estimate time, it would tend to establish as a\nfact that an intuitive sense of time does exist, as it could hardly\nbe maintained in their case that they had been counting seconds.\nThere should be many medical men living amongst uncivilized\npeoples who would, if approached, be sufficiently interested to take\nthe matter up and to carry out the necessary experiments.\nC. B. Baddeley, Colonel.\nREVIEWS.\n{Psychical Research.) The GoUgher Circle ; May to August, 1921.\nExperiences of E. E. Fournier D'Albe, D.Sc. Pp. 81.\nLondon: John M. Watkins. 1922. 7s. 6d. net.\nWhen Dr. Crawford died in July, 1920, it was naturally thought\nto be desirable by those who had supported his work that further\nresearches should be undertaken with a view to confirming and\namplifying the results that he had already attained. For this\npurpose Dr. Fournier D'Albe was chosen as one who had con-\nsiderable knowledge of and sympathy with mediumistic work,\nwhile at the same time being a critical investigator and careful\nobserver. He took up his work in May and completed it in\nAugust, 1921, the results of his inquiry being embodied in the\nvolume under review.\nBefore attempting to deal with the contents of this book, let\nus \"^cast our minds back and glance at the past history of the\nGoligher Circle. Dr. Crawford first began work in 1914. His\ninvestigations continued until 1920, when he died by his own\nhand. Thus for varying intervals he worked with the circle for\nabout six years, and published the summaries of his results in the\nvolumes which have already been reviewed in these pages. His\nmethod of work was peculiar, and it is as well to understand it.\nIts origin is rooted in the theories built up by those who claim\nto know the truth underlying psychical phenomena. The tragedy\nof it is that nascent mediumship is immediately seized upon by\nsuch persons, and in the ignorance of their conceit they at once\nbegin a course cf \" development.\" Darkness or the dimmest\nlight ;\nhymn singing ;\n\" guides and spirit friends \" ; the evil\neffects of a critical attitude ; the paramount necessity of avoiding\n\f20 Joanud of Society for Psychical Reflexive}'-. Jan., 1923.\na .scienUfic investigation ; the good influence of vibrations,\" and\nthe bad influence of human eyesight\u2014all those spiritualistic\naxioms, which are handed down from generation to generation in\nan unbroken succession, are dinned into the only too willing ears\nof the new medium and circle. In such an atmosphere as this\nDr. Crawford found himself in 19M. Four main courses were\nopen to him: (1) To avoid the circle altogether; (2) To work\nwith them under their conditions and make the best of it ; (3) To\naccept their conditions at first, and then to break down their\nprejudices little by little ; (4) To insist from the start on test\nconditions and on forming a committee to investigate the pheno-\nmena. Of these four alternatives he chose the second. When\nconfronted with a similar though milder problem, Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing chose the third, and can we doubt who was the\nwiser ? Having chosen. Dr. Crawford proceeded to work almost\nsingle-handed and in semi-darkness with seven persons. He\nintroduced mechanical appliances, all of which had to be explained\nto the \" operators \" before use. He began to take photographs,\nand although the results staggered even sympathetic critics and\ndid not seem to agree with his own theories, he persevered.\nContinuous co-operation with prominent psychical researchers was\nrefused : an offer by a committee of skilled conjurors to verify\nthe authenticity of the phenomena was likewise refused. Personal\nrequests from those who had specialized in fraudulent manipula-\ntions were declined, and entrance often given to spiritualist\nsympathisers and persons with no special qualifications.\n\"When 1920 came and Dr. Crawford passed away, the situation\nwas somewhat clarified. Opinions differed v\/idely. The spirit-\nualists, of course, proclaimed the absolute truth and accuracy of\nthe results of Dr. Crawford's investigations, looking upon him as\none of their champions, although perhaps a trifle upset by the\nfact that Dr. Crawford had decided that plasmic rods raised\ntables and not the hands of the spirit friends which clair-\nvoyants had so vividly described when visiting the circle.\nThe ordinary physical scientist either did not read the books at\nall or just derided them, whilst the serious psychical researchers,\nincluding, of course, those who had accepted the survival of\npersonality, found themselves in a state of uncertainty and\nsuspense. Knowing that similar telekinetic phenomena do actually\noccur when fraud is out of the question, the majority regarded\n\fJan., 1923. Reviews. 21\nthe conclusions of Dr. Crawford as possibly approximating to\naccuracy in regard to the mechanics of telekinesis. They were\nhowever totally unable to accept the phenomena on Dr. Craw-\nford's bare statements, and without even many of the simplest\ndetails being provided for their enlightenment. On the few\noccasions when critical witnesses were invited their reports ^ were\ndistinctly favourable, yet the conditions seemed so impossible that\nthe great majority of intelligent critics hesitated before finally\ncommitting themselves. Thus when Dr. Crawford died and Dr.\nFournier took charge, it was hoped that at last evidence would\nbe forthcoming which would either confirm or deny the observa-\ntions of the former investigator. It is true that many felt that\nthe old method was to be continued and would yield nothing of\nvalue. They therefore welcomed the appearance of Dr. Fournier's\nbook in the hope that their fears might prove groundless. We\nconfess that we were with those that feared and whose fears have\nnot been allayed.\nThe volume before us gives an account of twenty sittings and\na discussion of the results obtained. It also includes some\nextracts from unpublished notes by Dr. Crawford and a selection\nfrom letters written by various sitters. Dr. Fournier's conclusion\nis, in short, that the circle is an organized gang of frauds, highly\nskilled and acting in concert. Dr. Crawford, he thinks, under\nthe influence of spiritualistic traditions, was completely deceived\nthroughout his six years' investigation, and in the course of his\nbook Dr. Fournier hints at the sort of methods used by the\nfamily for bringing this about. The curious thing, however, about\nDr. Fournier's book is that he has given no real evidence what-\never that his conclusion is correct. It seems to be founded\nlargely upon suspicious incidents and movements which might have\na simple explanation. It is true that the shadowgraphs of the\nplasma cannot be distinguished from shadowgraphs of chiffon, but\nthen for all we know \" plasma \" may be exactly like chiffon. The\nonly way of discovering Avhether the plasma is or is not chiffon\nis to prevent- real chiffon from being brought in, which Dr.\nFournier found to be impossible for the most excellent of reasons.\nIt is also true that he saw, or thought he saw, Kathleen Goligher's\nfoot raising the stool, but for all we know it might have been a\n1 Such as those of Sir William Barrett and Mr. Whately Smith.\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1923.\n\" pseudopod,\" just as Home's \"arm\" might have been one when\nMr. Merrifield saw it. He does not say whether he could see\nMiss Goligher's two feet, one raising the stool and the other on\nthe groimd. Presumably the light was too poor to see either\nwhen on the ground, but would it not have been better to repeat\nthe experiment on another occasion, and in the meantime to have\ninvented some secret device for controlling the feet of the medium?\nApart from these self-evident objections the book is full of\nomissions and inconsistencies, which imply that for some reason or\nother it was hurriedly put together and therefore left incomplete.\nFor example, in the list of sitters A is omitted ; in the account\nof Sitting 10 it is said that the sitters and table are seen dis-\ntinctly (p. 28) without saying whether the medium is included as\na sitter. Presumably she is not, since on p. 30 Dr. Fournier says\nthat all the results of the sitting could have been produced by\nthe medium leaning out of her chair and supporting herself with\none foot. If, as he says, there was good red light, then it is\ndifficidt to account for the fact that he did not see the medium\nperforming these actions. Again on p. 34 a 7-lb. weight is\ndescribed as being raised several tunes. We are not told whether\nthe weight had a handle, an important point, since it might not\nhave been very difficidt to have raised a weight provided with\none, whilst not at all easy had the weight merely smooth sides\nand top. In the first sitting the table was levitated eighteen\ninches into the air, was turned over towards the medium, turned\nover on to its top and dropped with its top on the floor. It\nwas then seized and turned back in the reverse direction. Dr.\nFournier says that the light was not sufficient to show anything\nbelow the level of the table top, but he does not say whether\nthese conditions still held good when the table was upside down.\nHe tells us that \" most \" of the sitters' hands could be seen, but\nhe does not say if he could see the medium's hands, which surely\nwere the most important in the circle.\nSimilarly we fail to understand the experiment with the decanter\n(pp. 18, 19) and Dr. Fournier's note on p. 22. There would\nseem to be no need for substitution if a \" receptacle \" into which\nto put the mercury or water had been used like the bell in the\nold independent voice test.\nTaking the above as specimens of how the book is constructed,\nit will be seen how incomplete is Dr. Fournier's report. What\n\fJan., 1923. Reviews. 23\nhowever is far more important is the fact that he did not\napparently witness any of the larger phenomena under good\nconditions as described by Dr. Crawford, Sir William Barrett or\nMr. Whately Smith. This fact alone makes one ask why Dr.\nFournier did not continue his work even after he had decided\nthat he was dealing with a party of tricksters. It ought to have\nbeen perfectly easy to devise experiments which would have\nexposed comjaletely the true nature of the phenomena and which\ncould have been put into operation without the circle being in\nthe least aware of what was occurring. Thus ample proof could\nhave been given and the matter placed beyond any doubt. As\nit is, the gravest doubt exists whether the circle is in reality the\ngang of frauds that Dr. Fournier woiild have us believe. A\ncritical and detailed examination of his book is valueless. It is\nas useless as any critical examination of Dr. Crawford's work in\nthe past. The facts are not given. In Materialisations-Phaeno-\nmene and in the S.P.R. Naples Report on Palladino the facts are\ngiven, and no serious adverse attack has yet been made upon\neither. The Goligher Circle has yet to find an investigator to do\njustice to it. If the medium and members are genuine they\nmust be prepared to give as well as to take. If conditions\nexcluding fraud and normal processes prevent the phenomena\nfrom occurring, then it is almost waste of time to prosecute the\ninvestigation further. We do not believe the above to be the\ncase, but rather the reverse. The history of investigations into\nphysical phenomena shows that it is not true. No serious in-\nvestigator pays any heed to the stories of the marvels occurring\nin the presence of Monck or Spriggs, Mrs. Roberts or Mrs.\nBenedict. The conditions insisted upon by the spiritualists\neffectually prevented any value being attached to their efforts,\nalthough in the case of Mrs. Roberts some sort of semi-scientific\ninvestigation was attempted. Similarly, spirit photography has\nbeen going on under the direction of spiritualists since about 18.55\nor 1857, when such pictures were said to be first produced in\nAmerica. Since their appearance scarcely a single series of con-\nnected scientific experiments have ever been conducted, to the\nmisfortune of all concerned. In the present instance it is for\nthe CToligher Circle to take the next step. It has done much in\nthe past for what many people believe to be the good of science.\nIt is indeed deplorable that its efforts should have been of so\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1923.\nlittle scientific value. Whether we may think it just or not, the\nfact remains that Dr. Fournier's book will be generally taken as\na complete exposure of the circle and as a refutation of all Dr.\nCrawford's findings. Such a conclusion is warranted neither by\nthe book itself nor by common sense. However unfortunate\nDr. Crawford's conditions may have been he obtained results for\nwhich it is extremely difficult to account on any theory of fraud.\nAre we really to suppose that this family of working people,\nbesides levitating tables and faking innumerable other phenomena,\nperformed these tricks night after night for four years without\nany remuneration whatsoever ? It would certainly seem to be\ndoubtful, although not perhaps so doubtful to some as the theory\nof the plasma. The truth about the Belfast phenomena still\nremains to be discovered, and it is for the Goligher family to\ndecide whether it shall be arrived at or not. They have two\nalternatives before them. They can either decline to have any-\nthing to do with any investigators\u2014in which case they will go\ndown to history, at least for a time, as dubious mediums with a\nbias against them, or on the other hand they can pocket their\npride\u2014or their fear\u2014and demand the fullest and frankest in-\nvestigation of their claims by a committee of sympathetic scientific\nmen. It is only in some such way that progress can be made.\nB. J. Dingwall.\nRaymond Revised. By Sir Oliver Lodge.

Conan Doyle's motion, the Report says, \" If a deduction may be\ndrawn from the opinions expressed at the Meeting, it was clear that the\nmotion had the support of the great majority of the private members of\nthe Society. \"\nThis deduction is wrong, for a large majority of those present\nare known to have been opposed to the motion, and in addition over\neightj- Members who were unable to be present in person, including many\nof our most distinguished Members, had sent proxies to be used, if necessary,\nin opposing the motion.\nWe need hardly add that the Annual General Meeting is for Members\nonly, and that whoever sent the Report to Light committed a serious breach\nof confidence.\nA 2\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

This defect was most noticeable\nduring the recent investigation into the phenomena of Eva C. ;\nthe entranced medium was extremely sensitive to sudden noises,\nand on several occasions the inception of phenomena was\ncompletely inhibited by this cause. The new rooms are very\nquiet and will for this reason be better suited to a,ny experi-\nmental work upon which the Society may wish to engage.\nThey are also more commodious than the rooms at Hanover\nSquare. There is an excellent Library and Reading Room\nwhere members can be quite undisturbed, and there is also\nplenty of storage room\u2014an important consideration when we\nremember the large number of documents of various kinds\nwhich have to be carefully preserved. Although the move\nhas at the moment involved the Society in considerable\nadditional expense, the Coimcil are confident that it will in\nthe long run be a source of economy.\nAs was recorded in the Annual Report for 1921 in January\nlast, the Council decided that some addition to the regular\nsalaried staff of the Society was desirable if full advantage\n\fFeb., 1923. Annual Beport of the Council. 31\nwas to be taken of any opportunities for research whicli might\npresent themselves ; it will be remembered that since the\nresignation of Miss Alice Johnson in 1917 the Society had had\nno salaried Research Officer. It was decided, therefore, to fiU\nthis post, and Mr. E. J. Dingwall was appointed, and entered\nupon his duties in February immediately upon his return\nfrom America, where he had been working with Dr. Walter\nPrince.\nAt the end of May, 1922, the Research Officer visited Munich\nat the invitation of Baron von Schrenck-Notzing in order to\nbe present at a few sittings with Willy S., a young Austrian\nmedium. Three seances were attended in the laboratory of\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing, and, as reported at a meeting of the\nSociety on July 13th, 1922, many varied phenomena were\nobserved. The movements of objects without visible contact\nformed the major part of the phenomena, but apparent partial\nmaterialization of limbs was also observed. The control was\nexcellent, and the sitters mainly savants and relations or\npersonal friends of Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing. No normal\nexplanation of the phenomena appeared to be possible imder\nthe circumstances, and both the Research Officer and Mr.\nHarry Price, who had accompanied him, were strongly inclined\nto the opinion that the occurrences were of supernormal origin.\nThis view seems to be strengthened by the fact that the most\npowerful phenomena occur within a gauze cage, the only\nopening to which is away from the medium and the sitters.\nIn order to explain normally the phenomena observed it would\nseem necessar}^ to assume coUusion on the part of the in-\nvestigators, a supposition which can scarcely be seriously\nentertained.\nSince 1920 the Society had been receiving reports concerning\nthe alleged poltergeist phenomena which were occurring in a\nlonely cottage in Argyllshire. The case had interested the\nGlasgow Society for Psychical Research, and several members\nhad had sittings with the family, the results being considered\nworthy of further study. Accordingly the two children most\nconcerned in the manifestations visited Glasgow and gave\nsittings, but the phenomena did not seem good enough for the\nCommittee to issue a unanimous report. Later a member of\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1923.\nthe Glasgow Society had a number of further sittings and\ngave a more favourable report. It was suggested that our\nResearch Officer might visit the family and give his report,\nand a member of the Glasgow Society very kindly defrayed a\npart of the traveUing expenses. At the end of September,\ntherefore, Mr. and Mrs. Dingwall visited the hamlet. A number\nof sittings were attended and a great variety of phenomena\nobserved. There was, however, no reason to suppose that any\nof the manifestations were supernormal, and when adequate\ncontrol conditions were imposed the phenomena ceased abso-\nlutely. Although the case presented nothing in the way of\nsound evidence for supernormal physical phenomena, it has\nsome psychological and historical interest in relation to similar\npseudo-poltergeist cases elsewhere. In connexion with the\nstudy of fraud in incipient mediumship, too, the case may\nprove of interest, and it is hoped to keep in touch with the\nfamily for the next few years.\nFor some time past the Society has been anxious to enquire\ninto the phenomena of the well-known \" psychic photographer,\"\nMr. Hope, of Crewe. One or two members of Council have\nbeen able personally to obtain occasional sittings during the\nlast year or so, but Mr. Hope has not appeared willing to\nsubmit himself to anything in the nature of a systematic\nenquiry. In February, 1922, Mr. Harry Price, a Member of\nthe Society, had a sitting with Mr. Hope, a full report of\nwhich was printed in the May Journal, together with an\ninvitation to any persons who might be in possession of\ngood evidence for the genuineness of Mr. Hope's psychic powers\nto submit their evidence for the Society's consideration. Of\nthe cases received in response to this invitation one, sent in\nby Major Spencer, was printed in the July Journal. A\nnumber of other cases were also submitted to the Society\nbearing on the alleged mediumship of the Crewe Circle, and\nalso that of Mrs. Deane. The evidence consisted mainly of\nshort accounts by various sitters supplemented by specimens\nof the photographs obtained. It was said that further infor-\nmation could be obtained from Mr. Fred Barlow, the Hon.\nSecretary of the Society for the Study of Supernormal Pictures.\nA careful enquiry has been made into each of these cases\n\fFkb., 1923. Annual Report of the Council. 33\nby the Research Officer and first-hand evidence obtained\nwhenever possible. A summary of the evidence has been\nexamined by the Research Committee, appointed by the Council,\nand it is hoped to deal with it fully in a report on psychic\nphotography in general. Of the cases submitted two only\nappear to approach the evidential standard necessary. The\nvalue of one of these depends in great measure on the memory\nof one of the witnesses, whilst in the other the case rests\non the question whether the mediums could have obtained\na photograph of the person whose \" extra \" is shown. The\nother cases submitted to us have but little evidential value,\neither from lack of any detailed accounts at the time of\nthe sitting or from insufficiency of knowledge on the part of\nthe sitters as to the kind of information required.\nThe only useful moral which it appears possible to draw\nfrom these facts is that in the case of such extremely obscure\nand disputed phenomena as those which are believed by some\nto occur in the presence of Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane, no\ngeneral scientific conclusions will ever be reached so long as the\nenquiry is carried out under such uncertain and constantly\nshifting conditions as have hitherto obtained. It is in the\nhope of setting the enquify upon a systematic basis that the\nCouncil is anxious to have the opportunity of investigating Mr.\nHope's and Mrs. Deane's powers. They are so far fortunate\nthat by the generosity of Mr. H. W. Pugh the sum of \u00a3100\nis available for this investigation. The terms upon which\nMr. Pugh's ofler was made have been set out in the Journal\nfor July last, Vol. XX., p. 331-333, and also in Light, and\nthe Council take this opportunity of re-affirming that their\ninvitation to both niediums is still open.\nA certain number of minor experiments have been carried\nout at the Rooms during the past year. Amongst these we\nmay mention a few with Mrs. Travers Smith, some of whose\nearlier experiences with the ouija board have been described\nby Sir William Barrett and have also been published in her\nown book.\nWe have already recorded in the Journal our thanks to\none of our Members, Mr. Harry Price, for his generosity in\nlending to the Society for an indefinite period his extensive\n\f34 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1933.\ncollection of books on magic and witchcraft. These books are\nnow installed in the Research Officer's room and form a valu-\nable addition to the Library. A catalogue of them has now\nbeen completed and comprises over two thousand cards.\nAmong recent additions to this library which may be of\ninterest to members are Pierre Masse's De I'imposture et trom-\nperie des diables (Paris, 1579) ; a rare pamphlet by Gottlieb\nDammerung on the early \" Spirit \" photographs of Mumler\npublished in Vienna in 1863 ; Guillaume de Fontenay's work\non psychic photographs (Paris, 1912) and the study of the\nsame subject by Girod published a year later ; two editions of\nthe rare pamphlet by Oscar Simony on making knots in\nendless bands published in Vienna in 1881 ; a locally printed\ntract by Thomas Carr on the Davenports published in New-\ncastle in 1864 ; the volume of the Psychic Magazine containing\nMiss Barklay's attack on Eva C. ;\ncopies of several early\nGerman works on the table-turning controversy of the middle\nof the nineteenth century, and a set of E. D. Hauber's Biblio-\ntheca, Acta et Scripta Magica (36 parts in 3 Vols., Lemgo,\n1739-1741).\nOur thanks are due to other members of the Society for\nassistance of various kinds\u2014for example, in the re-arranging\nand re-cataloguing of the Society's Library consequent upon\nthe removal\u2014and in particular to Mrs. Creasy, who has spent\na considerable amount of time in indexing the records of\nHaunted Houses.\nThe Society's Library, as already said, has been more suitably\nhoused in the new rooms. For convenience the Edmund\nGurney Memorial Library is now combined with the General\nLibrary, and the whole number of volumes now amounts to\njust over 4,000. The library has been well used both by\nMembers and Associates reading at the rooms and by Members\nborrowing books.\nPermission has been granted to translate into French\nMr. G. W. Balfour's paper on \" The Ear of Dionysius,\" and\ntwo papers by Professor Wilham James, pubhshed in our\nProceedings. The Council welcome this evidence of the interest\ntaken abroad in the Society's publications.\nMr. Gardner Murphy, a member of our Society, has been\n\fFeb., 1923.

(The foun-\ndation of the Memorial was announced in the Journal,\nNovember, 1912.)\nAn additional privilege has been granted to members of the\nSociety, the Secretary having been authorised \" to issue to\nmembers who apply for them tickets admitting husbands or\nwives of such members to any Private Meeting of the Society,\nother than a Business Meeting.\" Advantage has been taken of\nthis pri^^lege upon several occasions.\nThe President of the Society for the past year, Dr. T. W.\nMitchell, delivered his Presidential Address in May. Dr.\n]\\Iitchell is the first practising physician who has occupied our\nPresidential chair, and his distinguished position amongst\nmedical psychologists in this country makes it specially advan-\ntageous to the Society to be able to include him amongst our\nPresidents.\nDuring the year Sir Lawrence Jones and Mr. Sydney C.\nScott, both Council members of long standing, who have done\nmuch to promote the interests of the Society, have been\nelected Vice-Presidents.\nThe Council has lost a member and a former member by\ndeath. Mr. H. Arthur Smith, a former President of the\nSociety, was a member of Council from 1883 to 1921, and as Hon.\nTreasurer for 31 years rendered very valuable service in\nestabUshing the finances of the Society upon a soimd basis.\nThe Rev. M. A. Bayfield, who joined the Society in 1890 and\nbecame a member of Council in 1912, was a frequent contributor\nto the Journal and Proceedings. Both Mr. Arthur Smith and\nMr. Ba}^eld were regular attendants at Council Meetings so\nlong as their health permitted, and the Society owes much to\ntheir help and advice. Obituary notices have appeared in the\nJournal.\nNine Members, sixteen Associates and one Corresponding Mem-\nber have died during the past year. xAmongst these we may\nmention j\\Irs. James, widow of Professor WiUiam James, Dr. Gower\n(of Denver, Colorado) and j\\Ir. E. Westlake, F.G.S. Dr. Gower,\nwho had been an Associate since 1904, contributed a consider-\nable number of cases to the Society's records and in particular\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1923.\nsome interesting reports on physical phenomena said to occur\nin a circle of his own friends. Readers of Proceedings will\nremember a further report on these phenomena by Miss Alice\nJohnson after her visit to Denver in 1908. Mr. Westlake\nbecame a Member in 1887 and did a good deal of useful\nwork for the Society in its earlier days. In particular he\nspent a considerable amount of time in investigations into the\nphenomenon of dowsing, and several of his reports on this subject\nare included in Sir William Barrett's two papers published\nin our Proceedings.\nThe total number of resignations during the past year has\nbeen 35 Members and 32 Associates ; 13 Members and 22\nAssociates who have not paid their subscriptions have been\nremoved from the list. One Member has become an Hon.\nAssociate and 10 Associates have become Members.\nSeventy-four Members and one Corresponding Member have\nbeen elected.\nThe total membership of the Society is now 1213.\nThe amount received during the past year by the sale of\nthe Society's pubUcations is as follows : By sale through the\nSecretary to Members and Associates, \u00a370 12s. 7d. ;\nby sale in\nAmerica through the Society's Agents, the F. W. Faxon Co.,\n\u00a315 Os. 7d. ;\nby sale to the public in this country through\nMr. Francis Edwards, \u00a383 8s. 3d.\nFinancially, the Society still needs further support. For\nthe first time for many years it was found necessary at the\nend of 1922 to obtain a small overdraft from the Bank, and\ntemporarily to apply to meeting current expenditure various\nsums which strictly speaking cannot be reckoned as part of\nthe Society's ordinary income.\nIn one way and another the move to the Society's new\npremises cost about \u00a3225, an amount which would have been\nsubstantially greater had not Mr. Scott generously declined to\naccept any remimeration for the legal work done by him in\nthis connection. In response to the Appeal issued by the\nCouncil, the sum of \u00a3197 9s. Od. was received to the end of\nthe year, of which \u00a369 13s. Od. was allocated by the donors\nto the Removal Fund, \u00a314 lis. Od. to Research, and the\napplication of the balance as between the two Funds was left\n\fFeb., 1923.

In the meantime the Council\nwishes to thank those Members and Associates who have\nalready given their generous assistance, either by donations or\nby increasing their subscriptions.\nThree Parts of the Proceedings were published during the\nyear.

I sent for the\nplumbers, and told them there was probably a washer worn out,\nor something simple the matter, but they said it was something\ndeeper, as they could find nothing wrong with the pump itself.\nAfter they had spent nearly a week hunting for leaks in the\npiping, and had taken up the flooring of two rooms, I stopped\nthem, as they seemed to be running up a bill with nothing to\nshow. From that time onwards, up till now, much pumping has\nhad to be done before any water could be obtained. I did not\nsend again for the plumbers, however, as I found that many of\nmy neighbours were having trouble to get water, as their wells\nwere running dry owing to the drought. I concluded that pro-\nbably mine was in the same condition.\nIn view, however, of what was said at this sitting, I called in\na plumber from another firm. He did not come to start on the\nwork till Aug. 14, 1922. He told me that all that was wrong\nwas that the leather of the lower valve was worn away ; he put\nthe matter right in a few hours, and the pump now goes as well\nas it used to. I know nothing myself about the mechanism of\npumps, nor that they had leather valves.\nA. Upper valve. B. Lower valve. X.

G. S. S.\nADDITIONAL NOTE ON A PUBLISHED CASE.\nWe have recently obtained a small piece of additional evidence\nin regard to a case which appeared originally in our Journal\n(Vol. XIX., p. 76) and was afterwards published in Mrs. Sidg-\nwick's recent report on Phantasms of the Living {Proc. S.P.R.\nVol. XXIII., p. 152). As the case is an exceptionally good\none, it seems worth while to print the additional evidence,\neven after this long interval, because a normal explanation of\nwhat occurred is thereby made even more unlikely than it\nwas before.\nMrs. Sidgwick's attention was first drawn to the point by\na letter from one of our Members, Dr. Sydney Alrutz, of\nUpsala, who wrote as follows :\nI am lecturing this term on hallucinations at the University\nand have given Case L. 1226, p. 152, Part 86 [of Proceedings].\nA quite remarkably good case. Would it not, however, be\ninvincible, if Mr. M'Connel, who is jjersonally acquainted with\nthem, would procure testimonials that they had not entered the\nroom at the time from the two officers who wore a naval cap ?\nIn consequence of receiving this letter from Dr. Alrutz Mrs.\n\fFeb., 1923. Additional Note on a Published Case. 43\nSidgwick wrote to Mr. M'Connel and got from him the following\nreply :\n4-1-23\n... In reply to your inquiry about my son's appearance\u2014all\nI could say to Mrs. Salter at the time she wrote to me, asking\nif it might not have been another of the \" white caps \" who\ncame into the cabin, and which Lieut. Larkin saw, was what\nappeared in the Journal of the S.P.R. I learned afterwards\n\u2014\nthat one of the \" white caps \" had gone to the Instructors'\ncamp at Redcar the week before David's death. The other was\non leave at the time of the accident so that there is no possi-\nbility whatever that either of them came to Lieut. Larkin that\nevening\u2014Dec. 7th. I learned this from Larkin himself and\nfrom other fellow officers of David\u2014too late for the information\nto be printed in the Journal which contained the account of the\nappearance\u2014and did not think it worth while to tell Mrs.\nSalter after the Journal had been printed. . . .\nD. R. M'Connel.\nIf our readers will refer to the original report of the case,\nthey will see that this statement by Mr. M'Connel appears to\nput out of court the possibility that the figure seen by\nLieut. Larkin at the time of Lieut. M'Connel's death, and\nidentified by him as Lieut. M'Connel, might have been one of\nthe two other officers in the camp (the only two) who wore\nthe same uniform.\nERRATUM IN CASE L. 1240.\nIn the report of a case printed in the last issue of the Journal\nthere is an error on p. 12. In Mr. M'Clure's first letter to us\nhe has by mistake written \" circa 9 p.m. on April 22.\" As\nappears from an earlier passage in Mr. M'Clure's letter, and\nfrom original notes in our possession, the date when the\nmessage was received by means of the ouija board was April\n21, not April 22, 1922.\n\f-'44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1923.\nREVIEW.\nSfiritism and Common Sense. By C. M. de Heredia, S.J. New-\nYork : P. J. Kenedy & Sons (1922). Pp. xv. 220.\nThis book is an attempt to discuss psychical phenomena from\nthe point of view of one who, although admitting that \" there\nmay be something in it,\" is inclined to think that trickery will\naccount for a great deal and that the rest had better be left\nalone by all true Catholics. Father Heredia is not content to\ndiscuss fraud in the abstract. He is a performer himself and\nin his entertainments he is said to duplicate many of the tricks of\nfraudulent mediums. On the whole we are inclined to think\nthat he overestimates the fraudulent aspect of the subject and\nwould liave done better by a serious consideration of some of\nthe best cases brought forward by psychical researchers. Thus\nwe cannot admit his explanation of Home's accordion test (p. 68),\nneither do we consider it in the least probable that mediumistic\nlevitation, if it ever takes place at all, should be produced by\nmethods similar to those employed by himself for his own levita-\ntion. We would also like to remind Father Heredia that neither\nMr. Clodd nor Mr. Joseph MacCabe deserves serious consideration,\nand we are frankly surprised that he has followed the latter in\nhis statement that Dr. von Kemnitz's book is \" an annihilating\ncriticism \" of Materialisations-Phaenomene (p. 188).\nBeing a Catholic, Father Heredia is bound to exhort his co-\nreligionists to eschew the practices of spiritualism. \" In baptism,\"\nhe says, \" Catholics promise to renounce the devil and all his\nworks.\" Since the presence of the devil is probable in some\nof the phenomena, and since observers can never know whether\nhe is not present in others, the best plan is to avoid seances\naltogether. The Church knows best and it is for Catholics to\nobey (pp. 167, 162).\nGenerally the book marks a distinct advance on similar pro-\nductions. Father Heredia has some knowledge of his subject\nand treats of it in an original manner. The photographs of\nfraudulent phenomena are highly entertaining, and we would\nlike to recommend especially the \" spirit\n'\"\nphotographs, produced\naccording to the author without touching the plates in any way.\nE. J. D\n\fNo. CCCXCIII.\u2014Vol. XXI. March, 1923.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT.\nAs has already been announced in the Journal for February,\nthe Council have elected Monsieur Camille Flammarion to be\nPresident of the Society for the year 1923. We are indebted\nto Sir William Barrett for the following account of Monsieur\nFlammarion's work ;\npart of this account he gave at the recent\nConversazione on February 7th, but some additions have been\nmade since.\nAs is now known to our members the Council have elected the\ndistinguished French astronomer, M. Camille Flammarion, to be\nthe President of our Society for the ensuing year. In accepting\nthis invitation, M. Flammarion writes that he is proud to be\nasked to follow so many eminent men who have presided over a\nSociety which he honours so profoundly, and which has done so\nmuch for the critical and scientific investigation of psychical\nphenomena.\nI have been asked to say a few words about our new President,\nwhose name is, of course, known to everyone present. In spite\nof his great age, he will be 82 years old in a few weeks, his\nintellectual activity is undiminished. Few, if any, scientific men\nhave written so many books, each characterised by great and\nwide learning and that wonderful lucidity in which French savants\nexcel. His last treatise, now in course of pubUcation, is on\npsychical research, and entitled La Morf et son Mystere, and is\ndivided into three volumes, viz. 1. \" Avant la Mort \"\n; 2. \" Autour\nde la Mort \" ; and 3. \" Apres la Mort.\" The first two parts\nhave been translated, and already pubhshed in handsome volumes\nby Fisher Unwin ; the last part (which M. Flammarion has kindly\nsent me) is being translated, and will shortly be pubhshed both\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, mae., 1923.\nin America and England. I have only read enough of this last\nvolume to see that it contains an immense mass of evidence on\nbehalf of survival after death. Much of this evidence is new to\nme, and will doubtless be of considerable value ; but in such\nvoluminous records as M. Flammarion has collected in these\nvolumes it is obvious that all the cases cannot come up to a\nvery high standard of excellence, and some will doubtless need\nrevision or excision.^\nBut what amazes one in reading these and other works by our\nnew President is the prodigious labour they have involved, and\nyet, M. Flammarion informs me he has no secretary and writes\nevery word with his own hand. On the fly-leaf of Apres la Mort\nis given a list of some of the many psychical works M. Flam-\nmarion has published. His best-known book is L'Inconnu et les\nproblemes psychiques, in two volumes, the French edition of which\nhas reached a circulation of twenty-six thousand. Another work\nof his, entitled Dieu dans la Nature, in two volumes, has had a\ncirculation of thirty-four thousand, and is, I beUeve, a brilliant\nattack on Materialism. But although M. Flammarion has been\nstudying psychical phenomena for fifty years, his Ufe work has\nbeen astronomy, and his papers and books on this subject have\nhad an immense circulation ;\ne.g. his small volume entitled\nLumen has reached a circulation of 70,000, and his Reves Etoiles\nno less than 142,000. Besides these he has published at least\ntwenty works on astronomy, most of which are intended to bring\nthe wonders of the heavens and the results of modern astro-\nnomical research within the comprehension of the general public.\nIn addition he has published sixteen books on general science,\nof which his UAtmosphere, a popular treatise on meteorology, is\nthe best known. Then he has written at least half-a-dozen books\non speculative science and philosophy, such as La pluralite des\nmotides habitues, La fin du monde, etc.\nBut all this monumental labour has been subsidiary to his work\nat the Observatory of Juvissy, which he founded in 1883 and\nstill superintends. The resume of his astronomical observations\n^ Since the meeting I have had the opportunity of a long interview with\nM. Flammarion at his summer quarters in Monaco, and he kindly gave me\na copy of the Proceedings of the French Astronomical Society, devoted to the\nhomage paid him by distinguished French savants, and from the information\ntherein contained I have gleaned most of the facts subsequently mentioned.\n\fMar., 1923. Election of the President. 47\nand papers fills two pages of the memorial to him in the Bulletin\nde la Societe Astronomique de France, and to these labours must\nbe added the editing of a monthly astronomical review which\nM. Flammarion founded in 1882. With such a wonderful record\nof scientific work there is little wonder that last year the Council\nof the French Astronomical Society held a public meeting to\ncelebrate the 80th anniversary of M. Flammarion's birth. At\nthis meeting the great amphitheatre of the Sorbonne, which holds\n3000 persons, was found too small for the multitude who wished\nto join in this magnificent celebration. A special number of the\nBulletin of the Society was published, entitled \" Hommage a\nCamille Flammarion,\" with a striking portrait of the veteran\nastronomer. This meeting was presided over by the President of\nthe Astronomical Society, Prince Bonaparte, membra de Tlnstitut,\nwho read a delightful letter from the President of the Republic,\nM. Poincare, regretting his inability to attend, and spoke (as Prince\nBonaparte remarked) \" des paroles eloquentes et particulierement\nelogieuses \" of M. Flammarion, whom he called\n\"'\ncitoyen du ciel.\"\nDiscourses were delivered by M. Reibel, representing the French\nGovernment, and by M. C. Ed. Guillaume (Director of the \" Bureau\ninternational des poids et mesures \" and Nobel prizeman), who\naddressed M. Flammarion as \" mon venere maitre, mon cher et\nillustre ami,\" he gave a resume of his friend's life work with a\nfervid eulogium of Flammarion, and of the esteem in which he\nis held. A valuable discourse was then given by that eminent\nsavant, M. Paul Painleve, also a member of the Institute, on recent\nastronomical discoveries, which concluded as follows :\n\" Mon cher\net illustre ami, en celebrant votre ceuvre, je veux celebrer aussi\nI'oeuvre de bienfaisance que vous accomplie\u2014et pour notre pays et\npour toutes les autres nations\u2014en creant, en fondant la Societe\nAstronomique de France.\"\nWe hope to reproduce the portrait of M. Flammarion in our\nProceedings, and shall look forward to the address he will deliver,\nthough it is unlikely he will be able to be present, as he rarely\nattends any meetings, and at his age we can hardly expect him to\ngreet us in person.\nSince the foregoing was written the Continental papers announce\nthe discovery of a remarkable and sudden change of brilliancy\na2\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, mak., 1923.\nof a star\u2014made by a student of M.

S.P.R., Vol. XXXIII., pp. 439 ff).\nThis note embodies the comments made by Sir Oliver Lodge upon\nthe first part of the pajjer when it was read at a yneeting of\nthe Society on November 14, 1922. Ed.]\nIt will be seen, from what Mr. Piddington has told us, that\nat the outbreak of war all three automatists were productive\nof concordant scripts, agreeing in tone with the scripts that\nhad long preceded them, when as yet they had no inkling of\nthe fact that any war topic was being involved. No doubt\nwe are unable positively to assert that they had no such\ninkling, but it certainly did not clearly come into their\nconscious minds. And one of them has said that, in so far\nas she thought about the meaning of her scripts, she thought\nthey might possibly refer to future domestic or financial\ntroubles of a private nature.\nIt is noticeable that the actual outbreak of war brought\n\fMar., 1923 Note On Mr. Piddington^s Recent Paper. 49\nno new and pugnacious quality into the scripts. They con-\ntinued to employ sentences sufficient to show that the previous\nwritings had been anticipatory of what was now fulfilled.\nBut they seem to me now to cease to lay stress upon the\nfulfilled portion of the vaticinations and to proceed rather to\nre-emphasise the other aspect, that is to say, the peaceful,\nthe Utopian ultimate outcome, the forgiveness of injuries, the\ncoming of the Kingdom, which all along had been promised,\nhowever little the significance of the passages was recognised ;\nand continued to repeat those portions which, in the outbreak\nof war fever, might have seemed almost alien to the normal\ntemper of the automatists, had they understood the allusions.\nIt must be assumed I suppose that they did now begin to\nunderstand them, but they had not the advantage which we\npossess of collating each other's writings. They could not\nrealise their consisten'- and concurrent character, because for\nthe most part each was only cognisant of her own script\n:\nand it is only now, by putting the scripts together and\npondering over their cross correspondences and following out\nin detail their literary allusions, that Mr. Piddington has clearly\nperceived and expounded :\n\u2014first, the clear anticipation of a\ncoming world-war, and then an equally clear anticipation of a\nfruitful and beneficent outcome in the fulness of time, a time\napparently not long to be delayed, though also apparently\nlikely to be preceded by further troubles and eruptions, suffi-\nciently perturbing, though not so violently destructive as the\nwar itself.\nIn so far as we can admit intention and intelligent design\nin the production of these concordant scripts, I believe their\nobject to be our encouragement ; and they probably acquiesce\nin the present publication of such parts of the material as can\nbe published, with the object of helping us to live through\nthe present and future perturbed era, to take our due share\nin helping on the forces that make for good, and to realise,\namid untoward events when men's hearts are failing them for\nfear, the guidance, the foresight, and the preparation for the\nComing of the Kingdom.\nOliver Lodge.\n\f50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1923.\nCASES.\nI.\nL. 1242. A Book-Test.\nThe following report of a successful book-test has been\nreceived from Mr. J. F. C. Kimber ; other cases reported by\nMr. Kimber have been printed in the Journal for January\nand December, 1922. In, the present instance Mr. Kimber\nwas himself the percipient, as he was in an earlier case (see\nJournal S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 197). In so far as the incident\nis to be explained by telepathy from the living, the agent\nwould seem to have been Mrs. Ellis, as she is called here, a\nfriend of Mr. Kimber's, who was one of the sitters in some of\nthe earlier cases reported by him ; one of the supposed com-\nmunicators at the sittings is Mrs. Ellis' husband. Colonel Ellis\n(see below). The book-test had a curious sequel, which\nappeared to indicate precognition. Mr. Kimber's first report\nwas enclosed in a letter to Mrs. Sidgwick, which ran as\nfollows :\nThe Gate House, Bashing,\ngodalming.\nNov. ISth, 1922.\nI think perhaps the enclosed will interest you, as there are one\nor two interesting points about it. Are we to suppose for\ninstance that Mrs. [Ellis's] subliminal noticed the space in the\nbookcase and guessed where the book came from ? Mrs. [Ellis]\nhas no conscious knowledge of this. I seem to have gone wrong\nwith the room description, and this was probably my imagination\nat work ; it is so difficult to know what is coming from outside\nand what one is thinking of oneself.\nThe bottle I saw very plainly, but Mrs. [Ellis] does not re-\nmember if there had been one there.\nAt our last home sitting we got a reference to Moth and Rust.\nWithout prompting came :\n\" Moth and Rust is Filmed and\nWILL be here see.\" I asked before reading out if Bob [Colonel\nEllis, one of the communicators] had anything to do with the\nmessage I got. \" I think so.\" \" Who did I get most of it\nfrom ?\n\" \" My Wife.\" \" And partly from you ?\n\" \" Yes.\"\nMrs. [Ellis] was not trying to transmit anything at the time, nor\nwas she reading the book.\n\fMar., 1923.

F. C. KiMBER.\nSubsequently, in reply to an enquiry from Mrs. Sidgwick,\na corroborative statement was received from Mrs. Ellis. This\nstatement is not dated, but was received by Mrs. Sidgwick\non November 30, 1922, and ran as follows :\nOn Oct. 25, 1922 I visited my friends at H in Dorsetshire\nfor the first time.\nA day or two before the 29th my hostess gave me a book\nentitled Moth and Rust. I took this to my bedroom, without\nknowing which book-shelf in the house it had been taken from.\nOn the 29th, when in bed, I read up to page 93 on which\noccurs the passage quoted above.\nIt was not until Nov. 1st, before taking my departure and after\nhaving read J. K.'s letter, that I returned the book to my hostess,\nwho asked me to replace it on a particular shelf in the library,\nsaying that I should find the gap from which it had been taken.\nOn finding this gap, I discovered that it was the fourth place\nfrom the Right on the bottom shelf.\nThe bookcase, a large one, contained books of all sorts and\ndescriptions. E. P. [Ellis].\nIt will be generally admitted that the word \" confusion\n\"\nused by Mr. Kimber excellently describes the subject matter\nof the passage quoted from Moth and Rust, by Mary Chol-\nmondeley, a passage which is found in the position indicated\n\" about half way down page 93.\" This book-test differs from\nthe majority of those obtained through Mrs. Leonard, in that\nthe information obtained about the contents of the book\nappears to have been derived from the mind of a recent\n\fMar., 1923. Cases. 53\nreader of the book, and at the sitting referred to in Mr.\nEamber's letter, which occurred on November 11, 1922, it was\ndistinctly claimed that Mrs. Ellis was the principal agent.\nIn the Leonard tests it is claimed that the information is\nderived by the communicators clairvoyantly from the books\nthemselves, and if any living telepathic agents do in fact\nexist, it has not been possible to trace them.\nThere is one veridical point in Mr. Eamber's impression\nwhich was not derived from Mrs. Ellis' conscious mind, namely\nthe position of the book on the shelf. It is possible, as Mr.\nKimber himself suggests, that Mrs. Ellis unconsciously noticed\nthat the fourth book from the right in the bottom sheK of\nthe library book-case was missing, and inferred that this was\nthe book she had been given to read. If we admit the\nclaim made by the communicator at the sitting of November\n11th that he had some share in the matter, we may suppose\nthat his contribution was the knowledge conveyed to Mr.\nKimber of the position of the book on the shelf.\nWe may now pass on to consider the sequel. It will be\nnoted that in Mr. lumber's letter quoted above he stated that\nat the \" last home sitting \" a statement was made that\nMoth and Rust would be filmed and the film shown in the\nneighbourhood. Subsequently Mr. Kimber sent us the record\nof the sitting, which we quote below ; but it is important to\nnote that the reference in Mr. Kimber's letter of November\n13th was made before any corroboration of the prediction\nhad been obtained.\nExtract from the sitting of November 11, 1922.\nSitters : Mrs. Ellis and Mrs. Kimber.\nRecorder : Mr. Kimber.\n[The words spelt out by the oiiija board are in capitals.]\nMoth and Rust is Filmed and will come here see.\nJ.

Hooper's recent paper on \" The Appreciation\nof Time by Somnambules.\"\nWe print the account just as it was sent to us, except that,\nby our correspondent's request we have given only his initials.\nIn the nature of the case it will be understood that no corro-\nboration is possible, but we have no doubt whatever that to\nthe best of his knowledge the writer has given an accurate\naccount of what occurred.\nJuly 19, 1922.\nOne evening in May, 1919, I had been reading the two cases\ncited in Myers' Human Personality of people having seen\nhallucinatory clock-faces which showed the correct time at the-\nmoment. Next morning, after a long hot climb on a Scotch\nmountain, I had lain down in the heather and gone to sleep :\nsometime later, perhaps an hour or an hour and a half, I awoke\ninto a very drowsy state, and, before I had opened my eyes or\nmoved in any way, the thought \"... what's the time . . . ?\n'^\ncame vaguely into my mind, linked with the feeling that though\nclose in spirit to my luncheon I was far removed from it physi-\ncally. Following immediately came a perfectly clear visualisation\nof the face of my own watch ; the hands being at \" just short of\n12 minutes to one.\"\nSo absolutely life-hke was it, indeed, that I had noted the time,,\nexactly and at leisure, before I realised that my watch was still,\nin my waistcoat pocket, that I had not yet opened my eyes, and\nthat I was in fact supposed to be still half-asleep. Then, as may\nbe readily imagined, I did wake to full consciousness, instantly,\nexclaiming to myself, \" Why, this is just like Myers last night !\n\"\n;\nand thereupon, as far as I can describe it, I found that the watch\nhad imperceptibly shifted from an actuality into an ordinary\nmemory,\u2014it had lost its objective reality, however vivid the\npicture that remained. Well, I sat up, rubbing my eyes while\nI quickly checked the facts of the case, and then looked round\nfor the first time at the view\u2014dazzled by the sunshine ; sure\nenough, I was awake and not still dreaming, I had just seen my\nwatch, and now I could safely take it out and check the time\nand make sure that this strange thing really had happened to me..\nI was totally unaccustomed to such events. Out came my watch :\nthe minute-hand was just perceptibly past where it had been.\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1923.\nNow, five theoretically possible explanations occur to be dealt\nwith,\u2014no doubt there may be more in reality,\u2014and as in these\ncases it is probably the victim who sees most of the game,\nalthough he may not understand so well as the trained observer\nwhat it is that has happened to him, his impressions may at\nleast be of interest, and possibly of value, even if wrong ; so I\nwill deal with my own seriatim :\n(i.) Somnambulism. \\\n(ii.)\n\" Complete telepathy.\" \/ N.B.\u2014Probably unscientific\n(iii.) \" Partial telepathy.\" headings, but adopted\n(v.) Clairvoyance. \/\n(i.) Somnambulism : the hypothesis that I had previously in some\nsuch state taken out and examined my watch, lain down again,\nand finally reawakened to commence the above experience.\nI think anyone who has ever slept in deep heather under a\nhot sun, to awake feeling rather cramped, stiff, and sticky, will\nat once rule this out. It is not easy to rise out of such a bed\n{though it makes a remarkably comfortable one, may I add ;\n\" on top \" by day, \" underneath \" at night), and the operation\ncalls for some little muscular effort : my whole physical being\nprotested against any such idea,\u2014especially since, as the hands of\nthe watch had scarcely moved, the whole of such an occurrence\nwould have had to have taken place in the interval of a few\nseconds.\n(ii.)\n\" Complete telepathy \" .\u2022\nthe hypothesis that some mind ivith which\nI may have been in touch telepathically had, knowing inti-\nmately the appearance of my watch and also the correct time,-\ntransmitted this visual image to me in response to a sub-\nliminal request.\nThis may sound rather far-fetched, and there is also a further\nobjection inherent in it, which may not be apparent at first sight,\nthat makes it tremendously improbable. Any such message, in\norder to meet the test to which it was put, would have had to\nhave included an exact allowance (we are dealing now with\n\u2022seconds) for whatever the error of my watch was at the time,\n\u2014\ni.e. the difference between its reading and standard time or\nwhatever the time by which my hypothetical colleague was going.\nThough many people may have known what they thought to be\nfor brevity.\n\fMar., 1923. Cases. 57\nthe correct time at that instant, not even I myself knew the\nerror of my watch. Again, I am sure that no one save myself\ncould have visualised the inner face of that half-hunter as I then\nsaw it,\u2014a watch that I have only used during the past 10 years\nwhen my wrist-watch has been out of action.\nOn the whole, then, it would seem that that theory may be\nruled out pretty safely ; unless one postulates clairvoyance in the\nfirst place on the part of such a collaborator. Should anyone\npossibly suggest that it might yet have been telepathy, but with\na discarnate mind, I imagine they might then write the case down\nas one of clairvoyance ; no one would be in a position to disprove\ntheir theory.\n(iii.) \" Partial telepathy \" ; hypothesis as above, but with my own mind\nsupplying the visual image in response to a subliminal 7nessage\ngiving either numerical terms or guidance in ])lacing the hands.\nAs to the psychological probability, or possibility, of such a\ntranslation of mental impressions from one set of terms to another\nI am not competent to express an opinion ; but the theory is open\nto the same radical objection as the previous one, namely, the diffi-\nculty of the allowance for watch-error. It seems scarcely less im-\nprobable, and we will therefore beg permission to rule it out also.\n(iv.) Subliminal time-sense : the hypothesis that there exists such a\nsense, which can record its results by prompting a visual\nhallucination of an actual or imaginary time-dial.\nAs to such a possible sense, it seems important to note that\nits results could at best be only relative ; that is to say, referring\nalways to some previous observation of the time and bringing it\nup to date by adding to it a record of the \" interval since the\nlast observation \" ; and further, the corollary that such a sense\n(of interval) must have been acquired subconsciously during life.\nFor there is no such thing as Absolute Time : what we call the\ntime of day is an arbitrary thing, and also it is different for all\nobservers, or at all places, except those on exactly the same\nmeridian of longitude,\u2014that is to say, either due north or due\nsouth of each other. At the poles of the earth, for example,\nthere is no \" Time of day.\" For conventional purposes we call\nthe time the same at any moment all over England, although\nMargate and Land's End are nearly half an hour apart, and to\nthis inaccuracy we have now added \" Summer Time \" : add to\n\f58 Journal uf Society for Psychical Research. Mah., 1923.\nthese inaccuracies those of individual watches, and we see that\nno subliminal \" Sense of the Actual Time,\" even were such a\nthing possible, could hope in summer to bring off one of these\ntests, which work to a matter of seconds ! Incidentally, such a\nsense would have to slow up its speed of functioning very con-\nsiderably if the observer flew due west in an aeroplane, and\nincrease it similarly if flying east, and such retardation or accelera-\ntion would have further to vary with the latitude in which he\nflew. Assuming, however, a possible subliminal sense of Lapse of\nTime,\u2014of Time-intervals, acquired by a lifetime of subconscious\nnotation of our measurements or units of time, \u2014it must be\nadmitted that this theory does meet the watch-error difficulty ;\nbut why should the freakish thing have gone to the added trouble,\nat its first and only appearance, of building up a re^jroduction of\nmy watch, complete in every detail and with the hands set\nexactly right, instead of just murmuring in an appropriately\ndrowsy fashion into my auditory centre, \" Not quite twelve\nminutes to one.\" Again, this is a matter for expert psychologists ;\nbut to the layman the latter method would seem at least the\nmore natural and calling for fewer steps in the dark,\u2014or at any\nrate in a rather obscure region.\n(v.) Clairvoyance.\nThis heading at least calls for no amplification, and, as a\ntheory to explain the occurrence, it calls for but one \" step in\nthe dark,\" and that of a not very startling or unheard-of nature ;\nalso only a very short one, into my waistcoat pocket ! Is it not\nalso an open question, possibly, as to whether the previous theory,\n\u2014the only other one that appears to remain at all in the running,\n\u2014would not in fact be tantamount to \" clairvoyance,\" restated\nin a series of cumbrous guesses as to the processes involved in\nthis particular instance ? For who as yet can say in what fashion\nthese things really take place ? C. H. B. G.\nREVIEWS.\nI.\nRemembering and Forgetting. By T. H. Pear, Professor of Psy-\nchology in the University of Manchester. Ijondon : Methuen,\n1922. Pp. xii, 242.\nProf. Pear is one of those psychologists who ought to join\n\fMab., 1923. Reviews. 59\nthe S.P.R. He is so open-minded, so acute, so ingenious, and\nso capable of seeing that questions generally have more than one\nside, that a subject like Psychical Research seems to be just\nmade for the exercise of his talents. His present volume, which\nis eminently readable, is not directly concerned with Psychical\nResearch, though it just mentions veridical dreams and the evidence\ntor telepathy on p. 70 ; its main topics are the problems con-\nnected with remembering and forgetting, with dreaming and its\npsycho-analysis. Now these topics are distinctly relevant to\nPsychical Research, and it is refreshing to come across an\nacademic psychologist who realizes how great and intricate are\nthe problems they involve. Probably, however. Prof. Pear\"s book\nis best taken as one more tribute paid by academic ps3'chology\nto the stimulus it received from the War. For the war shook\npsychology out of its dogmatic slumbers and idle, theoretic\ndreamings of a perfectly technical and perfectly futile terminology,\nand put it on its mettle. Or rather, the psychologists. For\nthey had to show that they were of use in the world, and even\nof national utility, or go into the trenches. So, not unnaturally,\nthey preferred to devise mental tests and to analyse, and some-\ntimes cure, the multitudinous cases of shell-shock.\" No wonder\nthey have returned from practice to theory with their theories\nconsiderably expanded. I cannot do better than quote Prof.\nPear's own testimony to this effect (p. 176). \" Many psychologists\nhave recently been among the tempests of the mind. From them\nthey, like Franklin's pupils, have learnt that the lightning displays\nare but striking appearances of a force which exists, in a quieter\nform, everywhere. Yet while some physicists remained to study\nthe rough weather, others went back to apply the new knowledge\nto everyday life, And in this respect the parallel between physics\nand psychology does not appear as yet to be suiBciently complete.\"\nNor, one may add, is that between psychical research and psy-\nchology. If psychologists would pay more attention to the\nabnormal and the residual phenomena that lurk in the dark\ncorners of the mind, they might get control of the forces that\nactuate its normal workings ;\nconversely, if psychical researchers\nmade more use of normal clues, they might find that their super-\nnormal happenings were in principle intelligible as exaggerations\nof quite normal processes. And so, perhaps, both parties inight\nmake progress. F. C. S. Schiller.\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1923.\nII.\nKri7ninal- Telepathic und Retroskopie. Telepathic und Hellsehen im\nDienste der Kriminalistik. By Dr. Ubald Tartaruga. Leip-\nzig : Max Altmann, 1922. Pp. ii, 201.\nDas Hellseh-Medium Megalis in Schweden. By Dr. Ubald Tartar-\nuga. Leipzig : Talisverlag. Pp. 128.\nDr. Tartaruga is a lawyer, and has been (or is) an official of\nthe police (Regierungsrat) in Vienna. He is also a writer on\ncriminology and interested in \" occultism,\" which is the German\nequivalent of psychical research. It was in his latter capacity\nthat he came across Dr. Leopold Thoma, also a lawyer, with\nsimilar interests and moreover, a skilful \" muscle-reader,\" percipient,\nand hypnotizer, who had been appointed official police expert in\ntelepathy, and had founded, in the beginning of 1921, an \" Insti-\ntute for Criminological Research,\" in Vienna. His researches were\nconducted with the aid of a medium called \" Megalis,\" alias\nPraulein Karoline Steininger, the twenty year old daughter of a\nViennese butcher who had been killed in the War. About this\ngirl Dr. Tartaruga tells us that, as a little girl of ten, she had\nhad veridical dreams about the future and had foreseen e.g. the\ndeath of her grandmother. In 1920 she had performed as a\n\" dream-dancer \" on the variety stage and, after her mediumistic\ntalent had been discovered, as a fortune-teller. When Dr.\nThoma hypnotized her, she used to pass into deep hypnosis,\nbecoming anaesthetic and deaf to every voice but his. In\naddition to this she used to be blindfolded. After this the\nmodus operandi was as follows :\nDr. Thoma was told the place and time of the case to be\ninvestigated by the clairvoyant, whether a crime or an otherwise\ninteresting occurrence, and he then told \" Megalis \" to proceed\n(clairvoyantly) to the locality and to say what she saw happening\nthere at a certain time in the past. If she did not know the\nplace, she had to be given directions to find it, until she said\nshe had arrived there. She then described what she saw from\nthe standpoint of a spectator, and her utterances were taken down\nin shorthand in the presence of various officials of the police, who\ncould usually verify her statements. According to Dr. Tartaruga\nshe frequently, and indeed usually, described cirumstances of which\nshe could have no normal knowledge, and often such as were\n\fMah., I!t23. Reviews. 61\nnot known to anyone present, though they turned out to be\ncorrect ; but as, even where her descriptions were sufficient to\nidentify the suspected parties, she could only see what they had\ndone in the places she was sent to, and could not say where\nthey were at the time, her evidence never actually enabled the\npolice to apprehend and convict a suspect. In spite of her\nremarkable successes, however, Dr. Tartaruga after about two\nmonths retired from the Institute for clairvoyant criminology,\nbecause he disapproved of Dr. Thonia's advertizing and un-\nscientific methods. It thereupon collapsed, and Dr. Tartaruga\nlost sight of \" Megalis \" for some months. After this interval she\nreappeared with a new hypnotizer, a Swedish gentleman, to whom\nshe was engaged, and whom she soon after married, and proposed to\nDr. Tartaruga that he should accompany them on a tour in Sweden.\nThe latter accepted, and gives a full account in his second\nbook of \" Megalis' \" performances in nineteen Swedish towns during\nthe four weeks of April 1922. The account is very full and clear\nand abounds in very remarkable incidents, which seem to\nestablish the genuineness of \" Megalis' \" clairvoyance and leave\nno very obvious ground for cavil.\nIt is also obvious that \" Megalis'\n\"'\nsuccesses were all the more\nremarkable for occurring in a strange country, and in places in\nwhich she had never been, than in her native Vienna.\nAt the same time psychical researchers know from much painful\nexperience that every account has to be confirmed and every\ndetail verified before it is accepted, even in cases where the\nhomi fides of the narrator cannot be questioned. There is no\napparent reason for questioning that of Dr. Tartaruga, whose\nqualifications as an observer seem excellent, and whose narrative\ncarries conviction ; but one would like to hear more from some\nof the other witnesses of this highly sensational and useful\ndevelopment of ])sychism. Fortunately, there should be no\ndifficulty about this ; for among those who are mentioned as\ntaking part in the experiments are the well-known members of\nour Society, Dr. Sydney Alrutz and Dr. Backman. They could\neasily supply the requisite corroboration of Dr. Tartaruga's narra-\ntive. And clearly, unless marriage has completely destroyed\n' Megalis' \" powers, further experiments should be arranged with\nher, even though Scotland Yard is probably much too conservative\nand too jealous to welcome her collaboration with the amiable\nalacrity shown by the Vienna Police.

Mr. Peterson has a paper on imitation and\nmental adjustment, whilst A. A. Roback discusses behaviourism\nin the light of medicine.\nThe Proceedings of the American Society for Psychical Research\nfor 1921 is a bulky volume of 592 pages. Section one is devoted\nto a consideration of the Chenoweth-Drew automatic scripts\n;\nsection two comprises\u2014first, an account by Dr. Prince of the highly\nimportant psychometrical experiments with Senora Maria Reyes\nde Z, and secondly, a Survey of American Slate-Writing Medium-\nship. Anyone who read Dr. Prince's searching analysis of the\nKeeler-Lee-Bocock photographic case will be prepared for his\ndiscussion of the evidence in favour of the mediumship of the\nphotograjiher's brother, tlie famous \" Alphabetical Keeler \" of\nWashington, Mr. Pierre L. 0. A. Keeler. Pierre Keeler is un-\ndoubtedly the most important medium for independent slate\n\fJiAE., 1923. Notes on Periodicals. 63\nwriting in the world. His work has been passed as genuine by\ninvestigators in almost every branch of life\u2014lawyers, business\nmen, doctors, etc. He appears willing to sit with anyone provided\nthat they are not acquainted with deceptive methods. Thus the\nofficials of the American Society are not allowed. Dr. Prince\npublishes part of his correspondence with the medium ofEering to\ngive him full facilities for proving his gifts before publishing the\npresent report. The report deals with the Keeler scripts mainly\nfrom their external aspect and their phraseology. Internal\nevidence is then examined and a number of sittings compared.\nAs Mr. Keeler obtains messages from one's deceased relatives\nwritten in their handwriting, it was necessary to examine this\ncarefully and to estimate the ability of sitters to recognize the\nwriting of their friends. The whole account of the evidence\njoints to one conclusion, namely, that the handwriting is that of\nMr. Keeler, the phraseology is that of Mr. Keeler, the conditions\nthose necessary for normal processes on the part of Mr. Keeler.\nThe report closes with an account of a recent materialization\nseance through Mr. Keeler's mediumship where the police were\n\"forced to stop the performance, a trap door being found in the\nwall and the footsteps of the confederate leading away across the\n\u2022snow to the back fence. The medium was fined fifty dollars\nand departed. Yet the mediumship of this person has been the\nsubject of at least two books, one written by the late President\nof the '\"\nCanadian Society for Psychical Research,\" and the otl. er\nby a well-known lawyer. Working in full light at the same table\nas the sitter, he obtains what purport to be messages from the\ndead, and in their own familiar witing as certified by their own\nfriends. Conducting the Message Department in the Progressive\nThinker, which is the chief spiritualistic paper in the United\nStates, he gives comfort to thousands and what is considered\ncertain proof of immortality.. Yet it cannot be said that there\nis any valid evidence whatever that he possesses supernormal\npower. For possibly forty years the Brothers Keeler have been\noperating, the one with the camera, the other with the slates.\nSince Dr. Prince's exposure of the photographer, Mr. L. K.

An Early Psychical Research Society. 67\nAN EAELY PSYCHICAL RESEAKCH SOCIETY.\nBy Sir W. F. Barrett.\nIt may be of interest to our members to read the accom-\npanying document, giving the objects of a Psychical Research\nSociety established in Cambridge at least twenty-five years\nbefore our S.P.R. was founded. My friend, the Archdeacon of\nDublin, kindly gave me the printed circular, which originally\ncame from the Hon. Arthur Gordon. This Cambridge Society\nseems to have been foimded by the Rev. B. F. Westcott,\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who afterwards became\nthe eminent Bishop of Durham : he was appointed assistant\nmaster at Harrow School about or a little before 1860 ; this\nexplains the address given on the circulars.\nMrs. Henjy Sidgwick has reminded me that this early Cam-\nbridge S.P.R. is referred to in her memoir of Professor Sidg-\nwick on p. 43, as foUows :\n\" He [Professor Sidgwick] before his degree joined the Ghost\nSociety which Archbishop Benson when at Cambridge had helped\nto found (see Life of the latter, Vol. I., p. 98 ^). Dr. Westcott,\nafterwards Bishop of Durham, while in residence at Cambridge,\nhad apparently acted as Secretary ; and in 1860, when he had\nleft for Harrow, we find him sending Sidgwick a story, \" pro-\nduced by the old '\nghostly '\ncircular,\" and adding \" I trust I am\nright in believing you are still engaged in the pursuit of this\nquestion.\" This investigation of ghost stories was the beginning,\nso far as Sidgwick was concerned, of \" Psychical Research,\" in\nwhich, as will be seen from the following pages, he was engaged\nwith brief intervals during the rest of his life.\"\nMrs. Sidgwick tells me she does not think the Cambridge\nGhost Society ever published anything nor preserved any\nrecords, as it appears to have been loosely organized and had\nno centre nor means of continuity.\n1 \" Among my father's [Archbishop Benson's] diversions at Cambridge\nwas the foundation of a '\nGhost ' Society, the forerunner of the Psychical\nSociety, for the investigation of the supernatural. Lightfoot, Westcott and\nHort were among the members.\"\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1!}2:3.\nHere is a reprint of the circular of the Cambridge \" Ghostly\nGuild \" as some called it : ; .\nThe interest and importance of a serious and earnest inquiry\ninto the nature of the phenomena, which are vaguely called\n\" supernatural will scarcely be questioned. Many persons believe\nthat all such apparently mysterious occurrences are due either to\npurely natural causes, or to delusions of the mind or senses, or\nto wilful deception. But there are many others who believe\nit possible that the beings of the unseen world may manifest them-\nselves to us in extraordinary ways, and also are unable otherwise\nto explain many facts, the evidence for which cannot be im-\npeached. Both parties have obviously a common interest in\nwishing cases of supposed \" supernatural \" agency to be thoroughly\nsifted. If the belief of the latter class should be ultimately\nconfirmed, the limits which human knowledge respecting the spirit-\nworld has hitherto reached might be ascertained with some degree\nof accuracy. But in any case, even if it should appear that\nmorbid or irregular workings of the mind or senses will satis-\nfactorily account for every such marvel, still some progress would\nbe made towards ascertaining the laws which regulate our being,\nand thus adding to our scanty knowledge of an obscure but\nimportant province of science. The main impediment to investi-\ngations of this Icind is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient\nnumber of clear and well-attested cases. Many of the stories\ncurrent in tradition, or scattered up and down in books, may be\nexactly true : others must be purely fictitious : others again,\nprobably the greater number, consist of a mixture of truth and\nfalsehood. But it is idle to examine the significance of an\nalleged fact of this nature until the trustworthiness, and also\nthe extent, of the evidence for it are ascertained. Impressed\nwith this conviction, some members of the University of Cam-\nbridge are anxious, if possible, to form an extensive collection of\nauthenticated cases of supposed \" supernatural \" agency. When\nthe inquiry is once commenced, it will evidently be needful to\nseek for information beyond the limits of their own immediate\ncircle. From all those then who may be inclined to aid them\nthey request written communications, with full details of persons,\ntimes, and places : but it will not be required that names should\nbe inserted without special permission, unless they have already\nbecome public property : it is, however, indispensable that the\n\fApril, 1923.

And it is manifest\nthat great help in the inquiry may be derived from accounts of\ncircumstances which have been at any time considered \" super-\nnatural,\" and afterwards proved to be due to delusions of the\nmind or senses, or to natural causes, (such, for instance, as the\noperation of those strange and subtle forces which have been\ndiscovered and imperfectly investigated in recent times) ;\nand,\nin fact, generally from any particulars which may throw light\nindirectly, by analogy or otherwise, on the subjects with which\nthe present investigation is more expressly concerned. . -\n'\nThe following temporary classification of the phenomena, about\nwhich information is sought, may serve to show the extent and\ncharacter of the inquiry proposed.\nI.

We now print a further report\nfrom Mr. de Bray and some accounts of similar experiences\nsent to us by members of the Society after reading Mr. de\nBray's earher statement.\nI. Further Report by Mr. de Bray.\nThe following is an account of three observations similar to\nthe one I described in the Journal of the Society for Psychical\nResearch for April, 1922, together with some remarks suggested\nthereby.\nA. The usual appearance took place in almost an exactly\nsimilar form to the one described. The appearance was, how-\never, less distinct, the details were hazy and smaller, as if seen\nfrom a distance, in fact as seen from an aerial rope railway or\naircraft flying fairly low. (I have never been in either, nor had\neither been particularly brought to my notice in the few days\npreceding the observation.) An important variation, however, was\nthat the motion of the landscape was reversed, being from right\nto left. To test whether the sub-conscious self responded to a\nconscious mental stimulus, I - willed \" to see a crashed aeroplane\nin a field; and two or three seconds later, surely enough, was\nthe quite recognisable collapsed structure of a smashed aeroplane,\nwith a profusion of details, too many, however, to be noted,\nwhite on the dark ground as if seen from above, my sub-\nconscious self evidently interpreting the stimulus in a manner\nconsistent with the rest of the picture. The view then became\nmore blurred and vanished gradually.\nB. A short semi-conscious period revealed the impression of\nsomething passing before my eyes TOth such a great speed that\nnothing was visible but horizontal hues, Hke a wall close by an\nexpress train at full speed.\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Apbil, 1923.\nC. The scene, this time, was architecture\u2014building after build-\ning jjassing into view. The view was uncomfortably crossed\nslantingly from the left down to the right by a line which ap-\npeared as a defect, crumphng, or crease in the view that was\nunrolling itself before my eyes. The motion was erratic\u2014some-\ntimes oblique or, I beheve, even vertical\u2014and suddenly I realised\nthat this slanting feature did not belong to the view. It was\na hue of separation (and therefore had probably no objective\ne.xistence) between two views, both of an architectural nature,\nthe one on the right moving to the right, the one on the left\nmoving to the left. It was as if two rolls, oppositely wound,\nwere placed side by side and unrolled in a skew manner, so that,\nalthough the pictures were unrolling horizontally right and left,\nyet the line separating them (dark narrow gap between the two\nrollers) was oblique. The effect was most peculiar.\n.\n;\nREMARKS. .\n'\u2022'\n'\nMy theory of these curious appearances is as follows : . .\nIt is known that just as the heart beats continuously from\nbirth to death, the mind works continuously, and ceaselessly\nthere is produced a succession of mental pictures. This is done\nby a mental mechanism, the effect of which is similar to the\nunrolling of an endless picture film. Three different states can\nexist : \u2014 .\n1. The unconscious. The picture film is reeled off, but we do\nnot know it when we are sound asleep. In this state our power\nof interpreting or feeling is immensely greater than at any other\ntime.\n2. The semi-conscious, in which we become aware of the reel-\ning off. If we are more unconscious than conscious, or if we\nbecome suddenly conscious, we are in the position of the person\nwho remembers his dream. With the vividness of percep-\ntion that we all know, the degree of which depends on the rapi-\ndity of the transition between sleep and wakefulness, a quick\nawakening allows our conscious self to retain for a moment the\npower of acute perception of the unconscious state. If we awake\ngradually, this power becomes bhnded by the gradual breaking\nin of consciousness, and yet if we remain in the intermediate\nstate long enough, we see the hypnopompic picture, which I only^\n\fApril, 1923 Further Notes on Hypnopompic Illusions. 73\nsee when I am lying lazily in bed, before getting up at leisure,\non a Sunday or other day of rest. ' :\n3. The conscious, subdivided into :\n\u2014\n(a) Semi-control when the picture film continually interferes\nwith our thoughts, only partially guided by them.\n(6) The full control when we become absolutely unconcerned\nto the moving picture (which goes on all the while) and cause\nour mind, as a perfectly obedient tool, either to call forth a\nsuccession of correlated pictures as when one goes through the\nsequence of the action of one's afternoon shopping to remember\nwhere one has left one's umbrella or hand-bag behind ; or a\nsuccession of correlated ideas, as when going through the chain\nof a mathematical reasoning, or yet merely to remain open,\npregnant to the required stimulus, as when one goes over one's\nmemory, as one would investigate one by one a set of pigeon\nholes, to remember a name \" that is just on the tip of one's\ntongue.\"\nIt is well known that in dreams, the pictures (or actions)\nsuggested by the sub-conscious self succeed one another with an\ninconceivable rapidity. Observation B seems to throw a light\non this. The sub-conscious mind being intensely more active\nmay be able to follow the swift unrolling film, which to the\nconscious mind presented but a blank, owing to the lightning\nspeed at which it was unreeled.\nIt is also held by many that the brain is in duplicate (so\nthat it is possible in the case of particular lesions of the brain,\nto have one half only of it working). It seems as if this was\nverified by observation C. In this particular partly sub-conscious\nstate, evidently, there were two processes going on, correlated to\na certain extent (both unrolling pictures were of the same nature),\nbut so independent as to allow of the unrolling to take place in\ntwo opposite directions. It is rather interesting to note that the\nseparation was skew, that is, along an oblique line. Is this\nalways the case ? If it is, is it the same for different indivi-\nduals, or is the direction of the dividing line different for dif-\nferent persons, owing to some dissymmetry peculiar to each\nperson ? These questions are not impossible of elucidation but,\nseeing the rarity of favourable opportunities, may require a very\nlong time to be answered.\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1923.\nThree of our members have sent us reports of experiences\nakin to Mr. de Bray's. In the first two cases the pictures\nseem to have been in rapid motion, as was the case with\nMr. de Bray. In the third case the pictures, sometimes of\nvery short duration, were apparently stationary.\nI.\nI think you may Uke to be told that, so far as I could judge\nfrom his letter in the Journal, I have had much the same ex-\nperience as Mr. Gheury de Bray\u2014only mine were before going\nto sleep instead of at waking time. The landscapes were often\nvery pleasant ones and I wished they would delay a little in-\nstead of changing so quickly. ... I do a Uttle sketching some-\ntimes, and sometimes spend the day on my bicycle enjoying\nbeautiful views, and it may be on these occasions I see the\nmoving pictures ... I fancy I saw them a few months ago.\nSince I saw the Journal I have tried to see them when not too\ntired, but they did not come at call. I have always been quite\nawake when they came, but in a reposeful condition. I believe\nthey came more frequently when I was young.\nI have never had any sort of visions or hallucinations.\nA. E. Grignon.\nII.\nI have been much interested in reading Mr. M. Gheury de\nBray's report of the hypnopompic pictures . . .\nFor a good many years I have from time to time seen pic-\ntures of landscapes apparently inside my head, before going to\nsleep but not with my eyes shut. These landscapes, it seems,\nare not, as it were, painted on my closed eyelids. They are\nquite as plain and distinct as if I saw them actually, but are\nperceived by something within. My experience is almost exactly\nthe same as that of Mr. de Bray. The scenes are, I am thank-\nful to say, invariably beautiful. They are never of any place\nI have seen, and vary from gardens or quiet English scenery\nto bits of wild African or other far off ^Jlaces. None seen ever\nrecurs again. If I try to fix them they change like a kaleido-\nscope. They always come when I am overtired, or not very\nwell, or perhaps worried.\nM. H. Mason.\n\fApril, 1923. Further Notes on Hypnopompic Illusions. 75\nIII.\n... I have had them\u2014experiences like Mr. de Bray's\u2014on\ngoing to sleep (hypnagogic) from my girlhood, as I recall by\noutstanding incidents. My \" visions \" are of two .sorts and have\ntwo methods.\n1. These come on and go off with a snap as if the shutter\nof a camera is flicked off and on. They are in minuscule,\nhighly coloured, as if seen through the finder (?) of an amateur's\ncamera. These may be faces or objects (a sickle with horn\nhandle) or small scenes (cats playing in the grass).\n2. These are built tentatively up out of the moving light-\nshapes inside the eyes, and disintegrate (not fade) in the same\nway, so as to give the impression of decay\u2014most unpleasing\nwhen the face is human and known to me. Nearly always\nthese visions are of human faces (sometimes oddly inhuman).\nMemory does not account for all, although some visions are\nroughly speaking, memories or built upon memories ; but ima-\ngination tinges them. For instance, a row of gloves hung out\nto dry had six fingers apiece ; and a fox-terrier had goat's horns.\nNo memory is accountable for such sights.\nThis faculty (?) is capable of development. By attentiveness\nand quiet expectancy, not by alertness or self-suggestion, the\nvision can be brought on ; but not the subject of it. Within\nquite a short time I have begun to see \" live-wire spooks \" which\nare words, phrases of music, small objects made up as if a pen\nfull of fire were writing them.\nMy visions will not oblige by answering to command, as have\ndone those of your correspondent. It is peculiar that general\nvague of darkness doesn't develop them, though personal dark-\nnesses, made by screwing the eyes tight, or pressing them with\nthe hand, induce them in waking (fully waking) hours.\nIda Wild.\nWe print below a report sent to us by one of our members\nof three vivid hallucinations experienced by himself, when\nfully awake, under special recurring conditions of light. These\nexperiences do not, strictly speaking, fall under the same\nheading as the experiences related above, but since they are\nin the nature of optical hallucinations, and therefore some-\nthing akin to them, it seems convenient to record them here.\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1923.\nThe name and address of the percipient are known to us,\nbut are not printed. . ...\nThe following is a record of three halhicinations occurring to\nthe same individual at intervals, far separated from each other\nin time, but under very similar enviroDments as to atmosphere.\n1. It was the percipient's custom at the age of 17 to rise before\nsunrise in the autumn mornings and walk along the bank of a\nriver to shoot wild duck which fed there during the night, but\nflew to safer haunts to spend the day. On one such occasion\nthere was thick white fog.\nWhilst [the percipient was] walking, gun in hand, a man, to all\nappearances, suddenly sprang to his feet 15 yards to the left,\nthe river being immediately on the right, ran round the third\nof a circle in front and suddenly vanished on the half right\nfront, on the other side of the river. The circumstance of his\ncrossing the river without pause, splash, or swimming, immedi-\nately brought the percipient to his normal senses.\n2. The percipient at the age of 36 was entering San Francisco\nHarbour. There was a dense white fog illuminated by a bril-\nliant sunshine above. The percipient, with a number of other\npassengers, was standing at the break of the upper deck, watch-\ning ; and the Captain with two of his officers was on the Bridge,\nalmost immediately over the passengers' heads^ keeping a sharp\nlook-out. Suddenly the percipient saw a large steamer, on the\nport bow, slowly steaming right across our course. He called\nout \" ship ahead \" and pointed with his hand. The hallucina-\ntion was broken by the harsh voice of the Captain saying, \" Now\nthen ! it's no time to be skylarking there !\n\" The percipient\nfelt thoroughly ashamed of himself, detesting as he does prac-\ntical jokes, but no explanation was given. The creation in this\ncase was most complete ;\nrigging, boats slung in davits, dense\nsmoke drifting in the direction the phantom was going. The\ndistance covered by it was perhaps 100 yards.\n3. The percipient was crossing Regent's Park at the age of\n52. There was a dense white fog; 11 a.m. Suddenly a tall\nviaduct of graceful arches, a quarter mile in length, came in\nview. The consciousness that it was an hallucination was pre-\nsent from the beginning, but did not dispel it. It remained a\nfull half minute, perhaps more. It faded quickly, but gradually.\n\fApril, 1923. Further Notes on Hypnopompic Illusions. 77\nThese or similar hallucinations have never been experienced\nunder any other conditions of solitude or darkness, indoors or\nout ;\nonly in dayUght and mist. Under these conditions per-\ncipient has to keep a close watch on himself as they tend to\nrise all the time, and he dislikes them.\nNothing is ever seen in a crystal or in a coal mirror, ink,\netc. In sub-tropical forest, camped alone, where the darkness\nis intense, nothing ever arose.\n.

April, 1923.\nREVIEW.\nOccultism and Modern Science. By T. Konstantin Oesterreich.\nTranslated from the second German edition. London : Methuen\nand Co., Ltd., 192-3. Pp. 18L 6s. net.\nThis is a brief but cautious survey of the present position of\npsychical research by the Professor of Philosophy at the Uni-\nversity of Tubingen. It deals broadly with a few of the funda-\nmental problems engaging scientific workers as seen through the\ninstrumentality of the most powerful mediums. The difficulties\nof research are clearly apparent to Prof. Oesterreich. The prin-\ncipal one is, as the author points out (p. 160) \" the aversion\nmanifested in spiritistic circles to scientific research.\" This dis-\nlike is due mainly to the fear that closer investigation might\nweaken the case for spiritism and so hinder the propaganda of\nthe spiritists. As Prof. Oesterreich remarks, the resulting atmos-\nj)here of the seance room becomes rejjellent to the professional\nscientist. \" The paraj^sychologic problems,\" he says, \" exercise a\npeculiarly fascinating influence on all half-educated individuals\n. . . who are drawn to them as moths to the light of arc-\nlamps . . . They then develop a peculiar spiritual fanaticism\nwhich makes all discussion with them as hopeless as it is un-\nrefreshing. They look down on science with ineffable disdain,\nmeet every critical objection with instinctive enmity, filled as\nthey are with the secret fear that they may find themselves to\nhave been mistaken.\" This mental predisposition. Prof. Oester-\nreich continues, makes them the victims of astoundingly im-\npudent frauds, and he goes on to relate how in his own ex-\nperience he has seen well-educated and intelligent persons being\ntaken in by the most transparent deceptions (pp. 11, 12). It\nis for this reason that ])sychical research is unpopular with or-\nthodox science, the author concludes, and he points out how\nGerman scepticism reverting to materialism, has made the subject\nin that country a forbidden chapter to all but the most en-\nlightened scientists.\nCommencing with Helene Smith, the author briefly reviews the\nvaluable work of Flournoy in unravelling the amazing cycles of\nher mediumistic career. .\nHe then proceeds to deal with Mrs. Piper and touches on\nthe telepathic hypothesis as one possibly sufficient for an ex-\n\fApril, 1932. Review. 79\nplanation of her phenomena. Comparing Mrs. Piper's trance work\nwith that performed by a good psychometrist, he says that the\ntelepathic theory would involve the assumption that Mrs. Piper\nwas in unbroken subconscious telepathic nexus with almost every-\nbody, a supposition concerning which he does not enlarge.\nFrom Mrs. Piper the author passes to a consideration of the\ncross-correspondences, and then proceeds to deal with physical\nphenomena. He accepts, apparently, some of the phenomena of\nPalladino and, in our opinion, rightly dismisses the result of the\nAmerican sittings, laying stress on the S.P.R. Naples sittings,\nand also those conducted by Prof. Botazzi.\nPassing to Eva C, Prof. Oesterreich reviews briefly the S.P.R.\nReport on this medium. He concludes, if we read him rightly,\nthat the report is favourable to the medium, and appears glad\nto learn that certain of the supposed \" normal \" processes attri-\nbuted hypothetically to the medium by ourselves were not pub-\nlished as our own beliefs, but merely as specimens of the lengths\nto which sceptics would have to go if they will not accept the\nsupernormal. In Chapter VI. Prof. Oesterreich approaches the\nproblem of Steiner and his relation to Theosophy and Anthropo-\nsophy. With other thoughtful men he is naturally staggered by\nthe claims of the Dornach philosopher, and rather innocently\nsugo-ests that Dr. Steiner should submit himself to experiment.\nComparing the Theo-Anthroposophical methods of attaimng clair-\nvoyant cognition with Yogi practices the author laments the fact\nthat Indian occultism remains uninvestigated. \"It is hard to\nunderstand,\" he writes, \" and regrettable in the extreme, that\nthe Society for Psychical Research ... has not yet made any\neffort to do so.\" Dr. Hodgson tried to see some of the Indian\nfeats when in the East, but he was not impressed by them.\nProf. Oesterreich is, however, quite right in his surmise that a\nrich harvest of facts remains to be gathered both in the East\nand elsewhere. We have recently come across an account of a\nseance for materiahzation in the South Sea Islands, but it is\nprobable that with the advance of Western modes of life all\nthese primitive magical ceremonies will tend to die out. As\nProf. Oesterreich says, there is no time to be lost, but we have\nhttle hopes of any expedition being sent out for obvious finan-\ncial reasons. The result will be that all the material now exist-\ning will be permanently lost to science and we shall have lost\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research.

'i.i P:X\n-\nCORRESPONDENCE. .\n. .\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014Referring to Mr. Hooper's paper on \" The\nAppreciation of Time by Somnambules,\" may I point out that\nthere is a singular faculty of the same kind in people while in\na normal condition of sleep. A small experience of mine lately\nis a typical instance of it. I was suffering from gastric influenza,\nand a doctor came to me in the evening. He said he would\nsend in a medicine to be taken every four hours, but he added,\nIf you are asleep of course it does not matter, as that is\nbetter than anything.\" The medicine came and I took a dose\nat exactly 7 p.m. It gave me reUef, and I fell asleep with a\nstrong intention and wish of going on with it. When I woke\nthe room was pitch dark ;\nI had not the faintest idea of whether\nI had been asleep five minutes or several hours, but as I was\nawake I decided to find out the time. So I struck a light and\nlooked at the watch on my wrist. The hands were exactly at\nII p.m., the hour when the next dose was due. The next\nsecond the church clock close by chimed out the hour.\nI am aware that such occurrences are pretty common, but\nI don't think they have ever received the attention they merit.\nEor what part of us is it that thus keeps watch and ward,\nneither slumbers nor sleep, and, as in my case, either keeps its\neye on the church clock outside or on the watch on my wrist\nin a dark room ? The experience of your correspondent in the\nlast Journal who fell asleep in the heather, yet knew the time\nprecisely when he woke, although exhibiting further complications,\nstrikes me as very analogous to mine. But I cannot admit\ntelepathy from any living mind in my case. No one but myself\nknew the time at which I took the medicine, so no one could\nknow the hour when it was due again.\nIf this mysterious part of us which does these things, and\nwhich I believe has immensely extended powers and knowledge,\nis not the part which survives death\u2014what is it ?\nLeila Boustead. .\n\fNo. CCCXCV.\u2014Vol. XXI.

Generous contributions continue to be\nreceived, but it is felt that the response to the Research Fund\nin particular has not been at all adequate.\nThe Society is conducting negotiations with a view to a\nseries of sittings with Mr. Hope, of Crewe, and also with\nvarious other mediums, and there is a good prospect of these\nnegotiations ending satisfactorily. As regards the sittings with\nMr. Hope, Mr. Pugh's generous offer has relieved the Council\nof financial anxiety, but the provision of funds for the investi-\ngation of other mediums is a matter on which the Coimcil\nconfidently looks for assistance to those Members and Associates\nwho have not already given or promised donations to the\nResearch Fund.\nThe question has also arisen as to the provision and equip-\nment of a room to be devoted specially to seances. It\ncannot be doubted that a Research Society such as our own\nought to possess a room of this kind. In the old premises\nat Hanover Square limitations of space prevented this. In\nour new and larger quarters the limiting factor is one of\nfinance. Possibly some structural alteration or addition to\nthe house at Ta\\'istock Square will be necessary, and in any\nevent the purchase of recording and other instruments, whose\nutility in the investigation of physical phenomena has been\n\f82 Joxirnal of Society for Psychical Research.

Before, however, the\nCouncil can formulate any scheme for a special seance room,\nthey must know to what extent they can rely on the\ngenerosity of Members and Associates.\nUnless the Research Fund is very largely increased, the\nCouncil may be compelled to abandon the idea of a special\nseance room. This would very seriously circumscribe the\nutility of the Society's work, and would put it in an inferior\nposition to other Societies formed for the same purpose abroad.\nThe Council feel that they cannot too strongly urge upon\nMembers and Associates the need for making a response to\nthe Appeal worthy of the traditions and standing of the Society\nfor Psychical Research.\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION OF THE\nCREWE CIRCLE.\nThe inquiry by the Society into the mediumship of Mr. Hope\nand Mrs. Buxton, which was facihtated by the generous offer\nof Mr. H. W. Pugh (see Journal, July, 1922), has now been\narranged and will, it is hoped, take place during the course\nof the present year. The representatives selected by the\nmediums are Miss F. R.

The conditions of the investigation closely\nfollow the proposals of Mr. Pugh, who has been kept fully\ninformed as to the progress of the arrangements.

Thoughts on Trance Phenomena. 83\nsimilarity in the experience of students of trance mediumship\nis of importance, in order to obtain perhaps a little more\nlight both as to the source of the phenomena, and the reason\nfor the contradictions and misstatements that sometimes are\nmade. I should like to put forward the suggestions that, in\nsittings with an entranced medium, (1) the bulk of the\nmaterial to be given is prepared beforehand by some intelligence\n\u2014possibly learnt by heart. (2) That the material is mainly\nreceived telepathically by the controlled medium, through what\nappears to the sitter to be the ordinary sources of sight,\nhearing, smell, etc. ; so that everything happens as if the\ncontrol actually saw, heard, and smelt what is being trans-\nmitted, and interprets accordingly. (3) That the process of\ntransmission requires continual concentration on the part of\nthe communicator, to such an extent that the communicator\nis by no means always aware whether or not the control has\nreceived the message correctly, or what is being taken down\nby the sitter. That there is therefore here a two-fold pos-\nsibility of error in transmission. Taking the above points in\norder, the first I come to is the suggestion that the bulk of\nthe material is prepared beforehand by some intelligence or\nother. Some theory of this sort would seem to be necessary\nwith regard to a good deal of the material received through\ntrance mediums, and especially with Mrs. Leonard's Book-tests.\nThere is, I think, a certain, though perhaps small, amount of\nactual evidence pointing to the communicator coming to the\nsitting ready primed with the material, and impatient to give\nit out. This can sometimes be tested at sittings with Mrs.\nLeonard, owing to the habit of Feda of carrying on a running\nconversation with the communicator, as well as repeating to\nthe sitter what the commimicator wishes to say. At the com-\nmencement of a sitting, and before the actual \" appearance\nof Feda, whispers can generally be heard, the purport of\nwhich it is not easy to catch ; Feda, apparently, receiving\ninstructions as to the first few sentences that the communicator\nwishes to give. On two occasions I have been able to\ndistinguish words that afterwards proved to be important\nkey-words in veridical material which followed, pointing, I\nthink, to the commimicator being already prepared with these\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical ltef>earck. May, 1923.\ntests. It would be interesting to know if others have had\nthe same experience. If this theory be correct, it should have\nsome significance with regard to the source from which the\ncommunications are coming, for those parts, at least, of the\ncommunications about to be received are not gradually extracted\nfrom the sitter's subliminal consciousness, by the medium, as\nthe sitting progresses\u2014as has been suggested. Indeed, in any\ncase it is not easy to see how the sitter can be the source\nof a good deal of material given at sittings ;\nfor, not infre-\nquently, material is given of which the sitter can never have\nknown ; and Book-tests are, at times, taken from places of\nwhich the sitter has little or no knowledge. Clairvoyance on\nthe part of the entranced medium during the sitting might in\nsome cases seem to be a solution, but, at times, when the test\nis solved, it is found to be appHcable to the communicator in\nso special a way that this suggestion does not satisfy. If, as\nI suggest, these tests and other veridical matter are prepared\nbeforehand by an intelligence independent of both medium and\nsitter\u2014to wit, the supposed communicator, everything follows\nas we might expect.\n(2) That the telepathic impression received by the medium\nconfers some form of actual vision of the object \" seen is,\nat times, I think, undoubted. It must, of course, be\nhallucinatory, for the medium's eyes are closed, and there is\nnothing visible to the sitter ; but that the object seen by the\nmedium is a picture of the object itself, rather than the sitter's\nor communicator's ideas of the object, seems to be supported\nby evidence. I have had several instances of this at my own\nsittings. A thurible was being described as \" shown \" to\nFeda. It was said to have \" two bits sticking out at the\nsides, not big things, two little things, half-way down there\nare rings.\" Feda added :\n\" Can't you put your nails through\nand feel grooves ?\n\" The supposed communicator would cer-\ntainly know that the thurible is hung by three chains, not\ntwo, as, of course, I knew myself. On examining the thurible\nafter the sitting, I found that when held up in front of anyone,\nas a rule only two of the projecting bits and rings can be seen\nat once. A similar case is described by me elsewhere, when\nit was said that I had a snake in my room, \" a wide\n\fMat, 1923. Thoughts on Trance Phenomena. 85\nsnake,\" \"it gets fatter in the middle. \"\nThe snakes, for there\nare two, are on a vase, but as the vase stands on the\nmantel-piece in my dining-room, with the head of one snake\non each side, the impression given by a picture of the vase\nwould probably be that there was but one snake. Here\nagain, the communicator, hke myself, would know that there\nwere more snakes than one. Feda seems to have actually\n\" seen a picture of the vase. I had an interesting illustra-\ntion also, a short time ago, of the same thing with regard to\nthe sense of smell. Feda, having stated that she 'was being\nshown a small tin box, \" not like the slaves bring when they\ncome to hve \"with you,\" said :\n\" She keeps on trying to make\nme understand there should be a kind of smell attached to\nit.\" Here Feda sniffed vigorously, and I enquired, \" What\nkind of smell ?\n\" I don't think it a very nice smell,\" said\nFeda, \" not hke lilies and roses. She can't make me smell\nwhat it is. Not a nice one, a characteristic one, not a sweet\none, not a pretty scent.\" The box in question Avas a tobacco-\ntin. There is no doubt about that, as ample description was\ngiven. I should certainly myself describe tobacco as a pleasant\nsmell, and so would the communicator. Feda seems, in some\nway, to have been able to catch a telepathic impression of the\nscent itself.\n(3) My third suggestion\u2014that the process of transmis^^ion\nrequires continual concentration on the part of the communicator,\n\u2014is based upon the internal evidence of the sittings them-\nselves. I am not sure how far this suggestion is supported\nby experimental telepathy. I find that if I interrupt a com-\nmunicator to ask a question, I run the risk of getting a wrong\nanswer. To ask Test-questions and to expect correct answers\nat the same sitting is to invite failure : it would seem to be\nsafer to ask the questions, and then say :\n\" Please answer\nthese at my next sitting.\" The sceptic will say, \" Oh ! Of\ncourse that gives the medium time to learn the answers before\nthe next sitting takes place.\" The type of cj^uestions, how-\nf, ever, of which I am thinking are not of this nature, they are\npersonal matters, known only to myself and the supposed\ncommunicator, and no one could learn the answers by enquiry.\nCorrect answers are thus given, later, on occasion, generally\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. may, 1923.\nspontaneously. If tlie material that is being given, and that\nI have interrupted by a question, has been uninteresting, and\nI have really been trying to change the subject, an evasive, or\nimpatient, reply is sometimes given, and there is a quick\nreturn to the original topic. It is just what a public speaker\nsometimes does, if his mind is concentrated on his work, and\nhe is rudely interrupted. This applies with greater force still\nto \" personal \" controls, where the power to think seems almost\nwanting at times, and little seems to be remembered that has\nnot been prepared beforehand. I have known the \"personal\"\ncontrol to say, when questioned, \" I'll tuck it up in \u00bbiy brain,\nor her brain, or whatever it is, and see if it comes up again \" :\nand, at another time, in answer to a question as to whether\na certain message given through another medium by the same\ncommunicator was authentic :\n\" No, I can't remember that\nmessage. I want you to be a little careful, because it may\nbe I can't remember in her. If I can remember after I'll try\nand give it through Feda '\nyes or no,' at the moment I have\nno memory whatever.\" I may say, in passing, that material\ngiven through one medium is sometimes alluded to through\nanother, and fresh detail added. One often gets the impres-\nsion of effort at sittings. Feda striving to grasp what is being\ntransmitted to her, and giving the impression of equal effort\nat the other end of the line. Sometimes what cannot be\ncaught in one way is caught in another. My communicator\nwas once trying to give the name of an obscure village, well\nknown to us in the past, which I will call Banswell. (It is\nas near the real name as I can give.) Feda got as far as\n\" Bans,\" but could get no further, and after several attempts\nto get the remainder of the word by \" hearing,\" she took my\nwriting-pad, at my suggestion, and wrote \" wel,\" remarking\n\" She missed one letter, I think.\" It is as though the com-\nmunicator, having failed with the telephone, got through with\nthe telegraph. Veridical material often comes with a rush,\nand is followed by what may possibly be \" padding \"\u2014the\ncontrol carrying on the sitting while the communicator prepares\nfor a further effort. This is particularly noticeable with several\nmediums other than Mrs. Leonard. I cannot find an instance\nin my Notes, but I am under the impression that at times\n\fMay, 1923. Thoughts on Trance Phenomena. 87\nFeda says, \" Hold it a moment longer, I haven't quite got\nit,\" when a picture is apparently being shown her. This also\npoints to concentration being required on the part of the com-\nmunicator. Occasionally palpably incorrect material is given,\nyet the communication goes steadily on : the communicator,\nseemingly, being unaware of anything having gone wrong with\nthe message she is giving. I have known this happen with\na \" Book-test,\" and it may explain why some of these have\nnever been found. A room was described by Feda, and it\nwas said to be in a certain person's house. The recorder,\nwho knew the house, saw at once that the description being\ngiven did not fit the room. In this particular case the room\nwas eventually recognised by the description. It was in\nanother house\u2014the details were clear, and the book and tests\nwere found. How did the mistake arise ? I would suggest\nthat occasionally, as in this case, the room is said, by Feda,\nto belong to someone she is especially interested in at the\nmoment ;\nsometimes, perhaps, to someone who has been men-\ntioned, shortly before, in the sitting. The mistake, of course,\nwould be a genuine one on Feda's part. But, ivhy, in such a\ncase, does not the communicator transmitting the Test knoiv of\nthe error that has been made ? May it not be that the effort\nof concentration is the impediment ?\nCASES.\nL. f243. I.\nA Case of Apparent Communication through a Medium by\nA Person living, but suffering from Senile Dementia.\nWe have received from Dr. F. C. S. Schiller the following\nreport of a case which has been brought to his notice. The\nnames of all those concerned are known to the Society. It\nhas been suggested to us by one of our Members that it would\nbe a convenient plan to print pseudonyms in italics, so that\nthe fact of their being pseudonyms would be at once apparent\nto the reader. This plan has been adopted below.\nDr. Schiller's Report.\nThe materials of this case have kindly been put in my hands\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1923.\nby an old friend who has taken a life-long interest in Psychical\nEesearch, and for whose good faith I can most unreservedly\nvoucli. As, for reasons obvious to the reader, names cannot\nbe published, I will refer to her as Mrs. G. Tarrant. In\naddition to Mrs. Tarrant, the persons concerned are Mrs. Piper,\nwith whoni Mrs. Tarrant had many very successful sittings\nyears ago, and with whom she still corresponds ; Mrs. F. B.\nRobertson, an elder half-sister of Mrs. Tarrant ; her father, Mr.\nA. Yovng, who died in 1899 ; and her near relative, Mr. B.\nWesterham, who is still alive. Mr. Westerham\\s conduct had\nseriously estranged him from his family, and Mrs. Robertson\nespecially had resented it so much that she had never felt\nable to forgive him. In 1919 Mrs. Robertson's husband died,\nand as her daughter was married, she lived alone for a time.\nIn former years (sixteen to seventeen years ago) the Robertsons\nhad had sittings with Mrs. Piper, and had obtained messages\nwhich they were convinced came from their deceased son.\nHence it was not surprising that Mrs. Robertson took to experi-\nments with a oni-ja board and to automatic writing. She\nobtained messages which she considered to be veridical, and to\ncome from her step-father, Mr. A. Yoking, to whom she had\nbeen devoted. They warned her against continuing her\nexperiments, especially when alone. Moreover, their physical\neffects appeared to be disastrous. She \" nearly went intO'\ntrance \" and had \" a very bad nervous breakdown.\" Her\ndoctor told her she \" must give it all up.\" So she did, and\nwent to live with her daughter. In 1920 she came to visit\nher sister, Mrs. Tarrant, and complained to her of hearing\n\" voices all the time \" which said disagreeable things and worried\nher. This led Mrs. Tarrant to fear she was becoming insane.\nHer subsequent letters did not, however, confirm this fear.\nThen for a time Mrs. Tarrant got no news. But on October\n30, 1921, Mrs. Robertsons daughter wrote to her aunt, Mrs.\nTarrant, that her mother \" had gone entirely insane \" over\nfour weeks ago and had to be put in a sanatorium. Her\nusual condition resembled a deep trance, and medical prognosis\ngave no hope of recovery, as the condition was ascribed to\nsenile deca^' of the brain. In the light of this diagnosis it\nbecomes clear that the breakdown in 1920 was already due.\n\fMat, 1923.

Tarrant, who had an arrangement with\nMrs. Piper whereby any messages or automatic writings which\nseemed to refer to her or her family were sent to her before\nMrs. Piper's records were sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, had\nreceived some curious messages which had completely puzzled\nMrs. Piper.

The condition of the lady very near\nand dear to him who is suffering greatly, is senile and the\nwanderings due to a cancerous condition of the blood, from which\nthe gentleman says he himself passed over. In her wanderings\nshe says. \" I forgive, I forgive and I'm trying to be happy \"\n;\nthough she is still in the body, her step-father over here gets her\nreal thoughts, and when she comes to us she will understand and\nall will be clear.

Have faith and find peace in\nprayer.\nTo complete the statement of the case, the certificate, dated\n19th Sept., 1922, of the hospital doctor attending Mrs.\nRobertson should be given. Writing to her daughter he says :\n\" Our diagnosis on the case of Mrs. Robertson is Senile Dementia\ndue to Arterio-sclerosis. In our opinion it is due wholly to her\nage, and the fact of her being inclined towards cancer plays a\nvery unimportant part in her condition. Her appetite is good.\nShe sleeps fairly well. Has few trances. Spends some time each\nday in the open air.

Cases. 91\nIt is evident that on the face of it this case presents several\nvery remarkable features. Not only do the very accurate\ndetails of Mrs. Robertson's physical condition displayed in Mrs.\nPiper's messages involve supernormal knowledge of a high\norder, if (as Mrs. Tarrant is confident) there was no one who\ncould have informed her, as Mrs. Robertson's daughter and her\nson-in-law were not aware of its nature and were not in com-\nmimication with Mrs. Piper about her illness ; not only is\nthere a very exact coincidence between the date of the first\nPiper messages and Mrs. Robertsons lapse from \" sanity,\" but\nthe case has theoretic imphcations of a very important kind.\nIt would seem that our conscious personality, i.e. what is\ntraditionally called our \" soul,\" is not so strictly tied down in\nits manifestations to its \" body,\" nor so completely and\nadequately represented by its behaviour, as it is natural,\nand hence scientifically \" orthodox,\" to suppose. The bodily\nmachine may become disordered in ways which irresistibly\nsuggest that the \" soul \" is destroyed or deranged : but they\ndo not prove this, and all the time it may be leading a life\nof its own in another \"sphere,\"\" or on another \"plane,\" though\nit cannot express this fife through a body which is no longer\nits possession in any effective sense. Now this is precisely\nwhat, as a few philosophers, notably WilUam James, have long\nsuggested, should have been expected. For the facts about the\ncorrelation of bodily and mental processes were always am-\nbiguous, and there was always an alternative to its materiahstic\ninterpretation. It was always a possibihty that bodily function-\ning did not produce the activities of mind but only conditioned\ntheir manifestations, forming the vehicle or machine through\nwhich they were transmitted. As a logical possibihty this sug-\ngestion had great merits\u2014it could not, e.g., conceivably be\ndisposed of by any of the facts to which materiahsm was wont\nto appeal ; but it had to remain merely a theoretic possibihty\nin default of positive evidence in favour of its interpretation.\nNow we seem to have got the requisite evidence. For we\nseem in this case to catch a glimpse not only of the actual\ncorrectness of the \" transmission \" theory of mind, but also of\nthe real spiritual agencies which are operating behind and\nthrough the veil of material mechanisms. At any rate, it\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

II.\nA Coincidental Dream.\nOn March 16, 1923, a lady whom we will here call Mrs.\nVincent wrote to Lady Betty Balfour the following account of\na dream of which she had previously spoken to her. Mrs.\nVincent's name and address are known to the Society, but\nhave been withheld at her request.\nI woke with horror finishing a dream as I reached out to put\non light\u2014or rather realising what the horror was. The light shone\nfull on the clock at foot of my bed\u2014the hour was 2.10. I seemed\nto remain in the midst of the horror though fully awake until it\ngradually faded, and after some time I fell asleep\u2014over a book\nthat I tried to read, but in the morning the recollection of the\nhorror was strong upon me. It returned at intervals during the\nday with a feeling of misery and fear\u2014at having dreamt of blood\nso vividly. In the evening I played cards with the [grand]\nchildren ; distress at the dream seemed to take more and more\nhold of me. The evening paper came in about 8\u2014an hour after\nthe children had gone to bed, and as P gave me the Evening\nNews I saw in large black letters : Taxi-cab Murder\u2014at 2 a.m.,\netc., etc.\u2014and the details.\nMy dream was that I was close to the back of a vibrating\ntaxi-cab\u2014that there was a pool of blood on the road on left of\ncab\u2014that I was saying, \" Can nothing be done ? \" ; and a voice\nsaid, The woman is dead. I saw the change in her face,\" and\nI saw that she was being drawn from the cab, and carried away.\nI do not know where I was, but I tJiinli I have the impression I\nwas in a taxi behind the vividly seen one. I was horrified. I did\nnot mention my dream to [anyone] that day. These are the\nbare facts of my dream. [Signed] EvelyxX [Vincent].\nMiss G L states that the dream was told to her on\nthe evening of February 6th after the Evening News had come\nin, and that with that exception the above account accords\nwith her recollection.\n\fTtfAY, 1923. Cases. 93\nIn answer to questions Mrs Vincent says that she has\nvivid dreams occasionally, but not horrifying dreams. She\nonly remembers one other horrifying dream, which occurred\nsome years ago and was not apparently veridical. She does\nnot think that the idea of murder was in her dream of Feb-\nruary 6th\u2014neither was there any suggestion of accident. She\nwas simply horrified and bewildered as she beheld what was\nbefore her. She saw the woman drawn forth and carried\naway, her head nearest to her. She was being carried at\nabout the height of the step, but whether she was drawn from\ninside or from under the cab Mrs. Vincent cannot say. It\nwas the left side of the taxi. She was carried forward\ntowards the front of it away from the dreamer.\nAccording to the evidence given at the inquest, as reported\nin the Times of Feb. 9, 1923, the murder was committed on the\nmorning of Tuesday, February 6, at about 2 a.m. in the neigh-\nbourhood of Leicester Square. The girl was taken to the hos-\npital, and died there shortly after. The dreamer was in Surrey.\nWe give below the extract from the Evening Neivs of Febru-\nary 6, 1923, to which Mrs. Vincent refers :\nA girl of 20 is dead, a man of 2.5 is detained by the police,\nin connection with a strange taxicab drama in the West-End\nearly to-day.\nPercy Pomercy is the name of the man. His address is given\nas Cotterell's-road, Hemel Hempstead, and he is said to be a\nshop assistant.\nThe girl was AHce Cheshire, of Bourne-End, Boxmoor, and\nTemplewood-avenue, Hampstead.\nWhen the taxicab was crossing Leicester-square the driver\nheard the woman screaming. The Evening News learns.\nLooking through the window, he is alleged to have seen a\nstruggle taking place.\nHe pulled the taxicab up, and when he got to the door the\nman is alleged to have said : Cabby, it's all right.

On \" The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules.\"\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam, Afril 17, [1923].\nYou may consider the following experience of interest in\nconnection with Mr. Hooper's recent paper.\nIn August 1910 I visted Glen Dol in Forfarshire with my hus-\nband. After walking to the head of the Glen we lay down in the\nheather to rest. I fell into a state of semi-consciousness, bordering\non sleep. I do not know how long this state continued, but\nI should say about half an hour. While I was in this semi-\nconscious state, with closed eyes, I had a clear vision of the\nGlen as I had seen it on walking up, but instead of being\"~a\ndesolate expanse of grass without a building of any sort in\nsight, I saw in my vision a number of small cottages, and a\nchurch tower with a clock face on it pointing to 3 o'clock. At\nthe same time I distinctly heard the clock chime the hour of 3.\nI then regained full consciousness, and the impression of the\nsound and vision was so vivid that I immediately asked my\nhusband the time ; and on looking at his watch he found it\nexactly 3 p.m. After a few minutes I again fell into a similar\nstate, and saw the cottages and tower as before, and heard\nthe clock chime the quarter past. I again awoke, asked my\nhusband the time, and found it was 3.15.\nSome days afterwards we were told that Glen Dol was formerly\nthe site of a village, and that according to a local legend, the\n\f^)6 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1923.\nchimes of the church clock are still heard in the Glen. We had,\nhowever, never been told this previous to our visit to Glen Dol.\nOlga C.

On the Clairvoyant Medium \" Megalis.\"\nTo the Editor q\/UJk-Jo^JiRNAL -Of the S.P.R.\nUpsala, A-pril 25, 1923.\n\u2022\nMadam,\u2014In the March number of the Journal Dr. Schiller\nin his review of Mr. Tartaruga's books on the medium \" Megalis\n\"\nput forward the idea that Dr. Backman or I might easily supply\nthe requisite corroboration of Mr. Tartaruga's narrative. I there-\nfore beg to give you the following information.\nOur Institute for Psychological Research decided in the beginning\nof this year to invite Megalis to give a series of sittings in\nUpsala. These sittings have now taken place before the Council\nof the Institute.\nThe experiments have been conducted in such a manner that\nin most of them nobody at all, or nobody present, knew\nthe \" solution '\"\n; in others this was known, partly or wholly,\nto some or all present. Not only experiments having the usual\ncharacter of Megalis' performances, i.e. assumed clairvoyance\nin regard to the past, were made, but also experiments as to\nher power to see \" and describe objects and drawings placed\nat the end of the same room [the subject is always blindfolded],\nas well as objects or drawings concealed in small boxes, envelopes,\netc., placed in her immediate vicinity. Hyjmosis was induced and\nexperiments were conducted in relation to the medium sometimes\nby the husband of the medium, sometimes by me. Everything\nsaid by the medium or the hypnotizer was taken down in shorthand\nby a lady doctor, German-born, incidentally residing in Upsala.\nThe minutes will shortly be examined and discussed and the\nresults published in some way or other.\nSydney Alrutz,\nPresident of the Institute for Psychological Research.\n\fNo. CCCXCVL\u2014Vol. XXI. _ .Jcxf, 192.5-\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nNOTICE OF MEETING.\nA General Meeting of the Society\nWILL BE HELD IN\nTHE STEINWAY HALL,\nWIGMORE STREET, LONDON, W. i,\nOn TUESDA Y, JUNE 26th, 1923, at 3 \/.w.,\nWHEN\nA Presidential Address\nBY\nM.

An Apparition at the Time of a fatal Illness.\nThe following case was first brought to our notice by a\nMember of the Society, Mr. E. P. Larken, to whom the\npercipient is personally known. In the case of the first of\nthe experiences related below it is unfortunately not possible\nnow to obtain corroboration, since the person to whom the\npercipient tells us she related her experience before it was known\nto be veridical does not remember the incident. Since, how-\never, the percipient has in more recent years had another\nexperience of some psychic interest for which corroboration is\navailable, it seemed worth while to put the two incidents on\nrecord together.\nMr. Larken's letter, addressed to Mrs. Salter, ran as follows :\nApril 1, 1923.\nA friend of mine told me the other day of an experience she\nhad about ten or twelve years ago which seems to have been\nof the nature of a \" Phantasm of the living.\" She had just\ngot into bed when she saw the figure of her mother, who was\nliving in the country,^ standing by her bedside. She says that\nshe did not feel at all frightened, but spoke to the appearance\nwhich turned away, and passed through the closed door. My\ninformant distinctly heard the rustling of the skirt of the dress\nas she did so. That night or the next morning (she is not\nsure which) my informant told her husband of her experience,\nand later in the day a telegram arrived to say that the mother\n^ The percipient was in London at the time.\n\fJONE, 1923. Cases, 101\nhad had a stroke at the time of the appearance to my informant.\nThe stroke did not kill the mother at once, but it was the be-\nginning of the end. If the case seems worth recording my\ninformant will give you all the information you wish. She\nsays her husband will be able to vouch for having had the\ninformation from her before the arrival of the telegram. Her\naddress is :\nMrs. E. H. Lacon Watson,\nE. P. Larken.\nIn reply to the above letter Mrs. Salter wrote to Mrs.\nLacon Watson asking for a first-hand account of her experience\nand a corroborative statement from her husband. Mrs.\nLacon W^atson replied as follows :\nAfril 14, 1923.\nI came to the conclusion that the incident I told you of was\nof no value whatsoever, as my husband does not remember\nanything at all about it, but I saw Mr. Larken to-day and he\nhas asked me particularly to send it on to you and also to write\nvery fully about it, which I am trying to do. The plain facts\nare these and they are very clear in my mind. I was alone\nin my bedroom and getting into bed, or had just got in when\nmy mother appeared by the bedside, it seemed, looking at me\nbut she at once moved across the room to the door and I heard\nthe rustle of her black dress. I expected to hear the door\nclose after her, but to my astonishment she vanished through\nit, and I remember seeing the panels of the door as she vanished\nthrough them. I then knew that I had not seen Mother at\nall.\nYou can imagine I was very much upset about it,, as I felt\nsomething must have happened to her. She had not been ill\nat all and I was getting letters from her in the ordinary way.\nI told my husband about it and I was very anxious to go to\nSuffolk and see her the next morning, but although he told me\nI could please myself, he also gave me to understand it would\nbe an absurd thing to do, as I should probably find her per-\nfectly well, and he made me also feel that I had been foobsh\nor fanciful, and said I had been dreaming ; and this is very\ndistinct in my mind, because I had told him I was awake and\n\fl02 Journal of Society for Psyclncal Research. June, 1923.\nI did not like being told I was asleep. He prevented me going\nand I quite saw that to stay was the common-sense thing to\ndo. However I got a telegram that afternoon asking me to\ncome at once. Mother had had a stroke and was not ex-\nl^ected to live. That was March, 1912 ; she died in July.\nI see you ask if there was any light. 1 cannot remember,\nexcept that I saw her dimly. . . .\nI have had a good many what I call coincidences in an ordin-\nary way, but also one quite distinctly curious thing when my\nold neighbour. Lady B., who was also a very great friend, died\ntwo years ago, and also when a friend became blind ; this last\nwas years ago, when I was very young. But Lady B. was only\ntwo years ago and I told my husband and also my maid about\nit at the time, which they remember. . . .\nRuth Lacon Watson.\nIn reply to this letter Mrs. Salter wrote again to Mrs.\nLacon Watson asking for a detailed account of the two further\nexperiences mentioned above with corroborative statements,\nif possible, in regard to her experience at the time of Lady\nB.'s death. Mrs. Lacon Watson wrote as follows :\nAfiil 21, 1923.\nThese experiences were so small that I fear they are hardly\nworth writing ;\nhowever, as you ask for them I will send them.\nA great friend living next door but one was seriously ill after\nan operation, but was so much better she was expecting to come\ndown the following week. I had been very anxious about her,\nbut was much relieved at her improvement. This was Friday,\nSeptember 16, 1921, and on Saturday I did not go to read the\nbulletin on her door. I always take a rest when I can after\nlunch, but on Saturday at 2.30 I felt so restless I could not\nremain where I was and something impelled me to go down\nand out into the garden without a hat or wrap, and it had\nbecome very windy and was cold and showery. As I gazed up\nI was under the impression that my old friend was being carried\nby the wind out of her house and over the mulberry tree that\nstands next door. I did not see her, but I felt she was going\nthrough the air in streams of light. It was all imagination of\ncourse and I felt quite annoyed with myself for being so silly\nwhen I knew she was more or less out of danger. But what\n\fJune, 1923. Cases. 103\nstruck me at the time as being odd was that I felt obliged to\ndisturb myself to go out there and stand there for a time, until\nthe necessity to stay there had gone. The next day Sunday\nI was out until 7 o'clock, when I went to read on the bulletin\nthat she had passed away at \" 2.30 to-day.\" Monday we read\nin the obituary notice that she had died on Saturday at 2.30.\nI suppose the shock of reading her death prevented me noticing\nthe date and I thought she had died on Sunday, and told my\nhusband how odd it was that I had felt so near her on Saturday\nbut had never felt anything on Sunday at all. I also told my\npresent maid about it on Saturday which she remembers quite\nwell.\n(She [Lady B.] died of sudden heart failure.)\nRuth Lacon Watson.\nP.S. The other was only a dream, but it made a deep im-\npression. It was so long ago I don't even know the date. I\ndreamt a friend was blind and wept absurdly about it and the\nnext day we got a letter saying he was temporarily blinded by\nan accident at cricket.\nWith the above letter was enclosed a corroborative state-\nment from Mr. Lacon Watson, as follows :\nApril 22, 1923.\nI have read the enclosed letter from my wife. So far as I\ncan remember the details her account of the first occurrence\ndescribed is perfectly accurate. Of that mentioned in the post-\nscript I know nothing ; it must have taken place long before\nwe became acquainted.\nE. H. Lacon Watson.\nMrs. Salter then wrote to ask whether a corroborative\nstatement could be obtained from the maid to whom Mrs.\nLacon Watson had mentioned her experience at the time\nof Lady B.'s death. In reply Mrs. Lacon Watson wrote as\nfollows :\nApril 26, 1923.\nI am enclosing the letter from my maid you asked for. She\nis not a great writer, but it is better I think for me not to\ntell her to alter it in any way. . . .\nRuth Lacon Watson.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 192.3.\nWith this was enclosed the following letter from the maid :\nI quite well remember Mrs. Watson saying she saw Lady B.\npassing through trees on Saturday afternoon. J. W.\nII.\nL. 1246. A Cross-Correspondence between Statements\nMADE THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT MEDIUMS.\nThe following case has been sent to us by the Rev W. S.\nIrving. Readers of the Journal will remember that several\nother cases contributed by Mr. Irving have appeared in recent\nyears. The interest of the present incident lies in the fact\nthat there seems to have been an attempt on the part of a\ndeceased person communicating through two difierent mediums\nto refer to the same topic. It will be seen that the state-\nments made were in part at least veridical. The two mediums\nconcerned were Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Brittain, with each\nof whom Mr. Irving has had a considerable number of sittings,\nat all of which the same communicator, Mr. Irving' s wife,\nhabitually purports to be present. We give first an extract\nfrom Mr. Irving's sitting with Mrs. Brittain, which took\nplace on January 24th, 1923 :\nBelle.1 Did she \\i.e. communicator] be frightened of spiders ?\nShe shows me a lovely garden that has shrubs\nand flowers, all covered with gossamer, not all\nlittle round webs, like pretty cobwebs, garden,\ncobwebby things. Like cobweb's lace, and there's\nsomething she's trying to convey to me about\nthis garden, as if weaving a pattern Me\nthinks it symbolical thing for you to find out\nafterwards.\nThe above extract is certified by Mr. R. R. Farmer, the\nfriend who acted as Mr. Irving's recorder, to be a correct\ntranscript of the notes he took at the sitting.\nThe sitting with Mrs. Leonard, at which Mr. Irving acted\nas his own recorder, took place on the following day,\nJanuary 25th, 1923. The relevant extract is as follows\n:\nW. S. I. Have you been down to see me lately ?\n^ Mrs. Brittain's usual control.\n\fJune, 1923. Cases. 105\nFeda. I have been down a little while ago and a long time\nago. Is a cage empty ?\nW. S. I. We haven't got a cage.\nF. It look so, it got pieces across the front like a cage\nthing.\nYou can look into it, so it's not an ordinary cup-\nboard.\nW. S. I. Not the meat-safe, was it ?\nF. Dora [communicator] says, \" It was the meat-safe and\nnothing in it. The spiders get close to it, not in\na good place.\n(Later in the sitting the communicator purported to con-\ntrol the medium herself, and the following statement was\nmade) :\nD. G. I. Did you hear a remark of Feda's just now about\nspiders ? It was something I thought you'd re-\n^nembered. It wasn't just about the meat-safe.\nI was trying to remind you of something. Will,\nI didn't like them when I was here, I wasn't think-\ning of anything in my earth life. It was very\nimportant I should say \" spiders \" to Feda. Isn't\nit peculiar 1 We hadn't been saying anything that\nin Feda's mind led up to spiders. Feda didn't\nknow why I was mentioning spiders. She didn't\nat all. I think she thought I meant spiders in\nthe meat-safe. You do understand I mentioned\nit because of something that's been happening\nlately ? Do you know, I want to say a word\nbeginning with B connected with that ? Isn\"t it\nfunny ? I've got to push things through. It's\nlike the camel and eye of needle. You know I\ndon't always talk about spiders, do I ?\nAfter reading the two extracts given above. Miss Newton\nput some questions to Mr. Irving, which we give below to-\ngether with his answers.\n1. {Is it true that your wife did not like spiders?)\nI don't think my wife disliked spiders more than most\npeople do, nobody likes them in the house. We have always\nhad rather a lot of spiders here. Our house is largely\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1923.\ncovered witli Virginia Creeper, and as the bedroom windows\nare usually open, spiders of large size are often found in\nthe rooms.\n2. (Where is the meat-safe kept?)\nIn the pantry, close to an open window covered with\nwire netting. The meat-safe referred to, though, may be\nan old one discarded last year, and now left in an out-\nhouse. It was said to be \" empty.\"\n3. {Is it true that \" spiders get close to it\" ?)\nProbably, especially to the latter one.\n4. (7s there any association in your mind between spiders and\nthe meat-safe ? Or do you know of any reason why the com-\nmunicator should thus associate them ?)\nNo.\n5. {Have spiders ever been mentioned before at any of your\nsittings with Mrs. Leonard, Mrs. Brittain, and other mediums ?)\nNever so far as I can remember.\n6. {So far as you know, did Mrs. Brittain know that you were\ngoing to have a sitting tvith Mrs. Leonard the next day ? And\nhad you told Mrs. Leonard that you were going to have a sitting\ntvith Mrs. Brittain, or that you had had one ?)\n\u2022\nNo.\nSubsequently Mr. Irving sent us the following note, dated\nApril 19th, 1923 :\nMy housekeeper decided to take advantage of my coming visit\nto town on April 16th, to clean out and lime-wash the pantry\nand china closets, which had not been done for some years. In\npreparation for this she removed the contents of the upper shelf\nin the pantry, which was full of empty jam jars. This shelf\nextends over the meat-safe. This was on March 27th, 1923. In\nthe evening she came to me to tell me of the numerous spiders\nshe had encountered, and I took down at once an accoxint of what\nshe said; which I enclose. I have never myself connected spiders\nwith the pantry. My housekeeper, of course, knows nothing of\nmy psychical experiments.\nW. S. Irving.\n\fJune, 1923. Cases. 107\nWith the above was enclosed the foUowmg note of Mr.\nIrving's conversation with his housekeeper :\nMarch 27, 1923.\nI had a turn at cleaning, the pantry, and the spiders ! They\ndrop ofi the shelves into the food. They must have been there\nsome time.\nW. S. I. Were they alive 1\nOh, they were ! And alive. In the jars and under\nthe jars. That's why I want it white-washed.\nThey keep dropping down onto the food. They\nwere there when I came. I'll give it a good dose\nof lime.\nW. S. I. Did you know there were a lot of spiders there before 'I\nNo, I didn't.\nThe following corroborative statement by a neighbour of\nMr. Irving's was also enclosed :\nApril 21, 1923.\nI certify that Mrs. Jones, the Rev. W. S. Irving's house-\nkeeper, this evening on being questioned stated to me that when\ncleaning out the pantry about three weeks ago she found the\nshelf above the meat-safe full of spiders.\nR. R. Farmer.\nTHE ALLEGED POLTEEGEIST DISTURBANCES AT\nGOREFIELD.\nAbout February 17th, 1923, accounts began to be received by\nthe Society of a series of violent disturbances in the house of\na Cambridgeshire fruit farmer at Gorefield, near Wisbech.\nThe Research Officer communicated with the vicar, the Rev.\nJ. H. Rutter, on the subject of the occurrences and acting\non the report received visited the scene of the disturbances.\nNo phenomena occurred during his presence in the house, and\nalthough they have a good deal in common with similar\noccurrences elsewhere, no definite evidence was obtained for\ntheir supernormal origin. Later information seemed to indicate\nthat the young girl of the family was observed trying to\n\f108 Jouifnal of Society for Psychical Research.

A more detailed report\ncan be seen in the Society's files on application.\nREVIEW.\nTeleplasina mid Telekinese. By Dr. F. Schwab. Berhu. 1923.\nPp. 109.\nThis volume is an account in general terms of a series of sittings\nwith the Berlin medium who is usually known as Frau Maria\nVollhart. The phenomena are mainly physical and appear to be\nof exceptional interest. Although the conditions can hardly be\ncalled satisfactory Dr. Schwab's observations are worthy of some\ncareful attention. Besides the movement of objects, Frau Vollhart\nproduces teleplasm of the kind made familiar by Eva C. The\nsubstance, as in Eva's case, is derived apparently from the bodily\norifices, and Dr. Schwab succeeded in obtaining some remarkable\nphotographs of its extrusion from the mouth. Apports, lights\nand occasionally complete levitation of the medium are also\nreported, although it seems a pity that Dr. Schwab did not\nattempt a more detailed investigation. The value of the book\nis not so much in its reports, which are not nearly sufficiently\ndetailed, but in the light the phenomena throw upon similar\noccurrences reported from all parts of Europe. E.

Ill\nCONCERNING THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.\nIt is proposed to print a limited number of copies of the\nEnglish translation of Monsieur Camille Flammarion's Presi-\ndential Address (read at a meeting of the Society on June\n26th last). The translation will be issued in pamphlet form\nand the price will be Is. 6d. to Members of the Society and\n2s. to the public. It is hoped to have it ready by the time\nthe Society's Rooms re-open early in September. Members\nwho w^sh to secure one or more copies are asked to write\nto the Secretary, 31 Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1.\nThe Presidential Address in the original French will in\nthe ordinary course be published in Proceedings.\nOBITUARY NOTICE.\nColonel C. E. Baddeley, C.B., C.M.O.\nWe have to record with regret the death of Colonel C. E.\nBaddeley, which occurred upon the 28th April, following an\noperation.\nColonel Baddeley was a keen student of psychical research\nand had during recent years devoted much of his time to\nthe subject. The Society was indebted to him for help in\nvarious ways, and in particular for the considerable amount\nof work he did in connexion with the experiment carried\nout by the Society upon \" the element of chance in book\ntests,\" a report upon which recently appeared in the Pro-\nceedings (Part LXXXVIL, p. 606 ff.).\nThose who are both able and willing to undertake work\nof this kind are not too numerous, and Colonel Baddeley's\ndeath is a loss to psychical research.\nCONCERNING THE PROPOSED EXPERIMENTS\nWITH THE CREWE CIRCLE.\nIn the Journal for last May it was stated that an enquiry\nby the Society into the mediumship of Mr. Hope and Mrs.\nBuxton had been arranged and woiild, it was hoped, take\nplace during the present year. A definite and detailed written\na2\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1923,\nagreement, covering all the conditions under which the first\nsittings of the enquiry were to take place, had, before the\nMay Journal was issued, been reached between the Research\nCommittee of the Society and the three representatives of\nthe Crewe Circle, Miss F. R. Scatcherd, Mr. H. Engholm\nand Mr. G. E. Wright. Since that date, however, the Crewe\nCircle have raised objections to carrying out this agreement,\nand as considerable misconception appears to prevail in some\nquarters as to the Society's action in the matter, it is felt\nthat a short statement of the course of negotiations is desir-\nable.\nIt will be remembered that we are indebted to Mr. H. W. Pugh\nfor an offer of \u00a3100 to cover the cost of an enquiry into\nMr. Hope's mediumship. On the 23rd July, 1922, at Mr.\nPugh's suggestion, he and our Research Officer, Mr. E. J.\nDingwall, went by appointment to the British College of\nPsychic Science to meet Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton. Mr.\nHope and Mrs. Buxton were very friendly in manner, and\nin the course of the interview they both signed a statement\nto the effect that they agreed to take part in an enquiry\ninto their phenomena by the S.P.R. The nature of the\nagreement was recorded in Light, July 29, .1922, p. 467, as\nfollows : .\nPsychic Photogkaphy.\nMr. J. Hewat M'Kenzie writes : Your readers will be interested\nto learn that Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton authorise me to say\nthat they willingly agree to co-operate with the Society for\nPsychical Research in the proposed experiments on the lines set\nout in your recent issues ; it being, however, a condition that\nthe Society shall first provide Mr. Hope with details as to the\nextra marked plate purporting to belong to Mr. Price. Upon\nthis being done, the sittings will take place in the autumn, and\nto establish the best conditions, will be carried out with as\nlittle public attention as j^ossible.\nIt is to to be observed that this agreement was reached\nnearly two months after the Report of Mr. Price's sitting\nhad been printed in the Journal for May, 1922, that Mr.\n\fJuly, 1923. Proposed Experiments ivith the Crewe Circle. 113\nHope, when he signed the agreement, was evidently quite\nfamiUar with the general tenor of that report, and that the\nonly stipulation made by him in regard to Mr. Price's sitting\nor the report thereon was that he should be \" provided with\ndetails as to the extra marked plate purporting to belong\nto Mr. Price.\" This stipulation has long since been com-\npUed with. There was not even a hint that Mr. Hope or\nMrs. Buxton regarded the imputation of fraud contained in\nthe report as any obstacle to the proposed sittings.\nOn March 23rd, 1923, a letter was received from Mr. G. E.\nWright, of the London Spiritualist Alhance, suggesting that\na Committee of six persons should be appointed, three nomi-\nnated by the S.P.R., and three by the L.S.A. \" on behalf of\nMr. Hope,\" to consider conditions under which experiments\nwith the Crewe Circle should be carried out. The Research\nCommittee of the S.P.R. agreed to this suggestion, and\nappointed three of their own members, and shortly afterwards\na further letter was received from Mr. Wright to the effect\nthat the L.S.A. had nominated Miss Scatcherd, Mr. Engholm\nand himself \" on behalf of the Crewe Circle.\" This Com-\nmittee met several times during April and May, and ultimately\nafter a good deal of discussion a definite agreement covering\nthe earUer sittings was, as above stated, arrived at, and a\nstatement was accordingly inserted in the May Journal.\nTowards the end of May, after the May Journal had gone\nto press, Mr. Wright informed Mr. Dingwall over the telephone\nthat before Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton would consent to any\nexperiments with the S.P.R., they demanded something in\nthe nature of a withdrawal of the charge of fraud made against\nthem in the Journal for May, 1922. Although negotiations\nwith regard to the proposed enquiry had been proceeding\nsince July, 1922, this was the first intimation of any kind\nthat either Mr. Hope or Mrs. Buxton required a withdrawal\nas a condition precedent to the investigation.\nIn view of this unexpected development the Hon. Editor,\nMrs. Salter, wrote to Mr. Wright on the 14th June, 1923,\nenquiring exactly how matters stood, as it was proposed to\nmake a further statement in the Journal, and on the 5th\nJuly Mr. Wright wrote regretting that his Committee had\n\f114 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1923.\nnot yet received any definite statement from the Crewe Circle,\nand added that he hoped it might be possible to furnish the\nSociety with something definite before long.\nThere the matter at present stands. The stipulation on\nwhich Mr. Hope and Mrs. Buxton now insist is obviously\nan afterthought. No negotiations can ever reach a satis-\nfactory conclusion if after an agreement has been reached one\nparty shifts their ground and raises new objections. If the\nCrewe Circle desire to have their phenomena investigated\nby the S.P.R., they have only to carry out the terms agreed\nto by their representatives from the L.S.A.\nIn conclusion we may express our appreciation of the\nfriendly spirit shown by the three representatives of the\nL.S.A. in these negotiations, and our sympathy for the un-\nfortunate position in which they have been placed\u2014we hope\nonly temporarily\u2014by the Crewe Circle's repudiation of the\nterms Avhich their representatives had accepted.\nCASE.\nL. 1246. An Auditory Hallucination.\nIn the following case the percipient, Miss Ethel Butler, heard\nherself called three times at about the time when a favourite\nsister in Australia was lapsing into the unconsciousness which\npreceded her death. The case has been enquired into by\nthe Research Officer, Mr. E. J. Dingwall, who first heard\nof it from Miss Butler's father on January 16, 1923, and\nwrote on January 20th for further particulars.\nIn reply to Mr. Dingwall's letter Mr. Butler wrote as\nfollows :\n\u2014\n. 60 Herongate Road,\nWanstead, E 12.\n29 Jan., 1923.\nIn reply to your request for an account of the incident I\nspoke to you about at the Lecture you gave at Manor Park\non the 16th instant when I said my eldest daughter heard her\nname (Ethel) called three times on the 31st July last.

The\nthird time she thought it was her youngest sister who called\nso went to the bottom of the stairs and called up \" Yes, Edie,\nwhat do you want ?\n\" and the reply was, \" Why I haven't called\nyou.\"\nWe received the news of my daughter's death on the 16th\nSept. from the Matron of the Mining District Hospital New South\nWales saying she became unconscious on the evening of 31st\nJuly and died at 11.20 a.m. on 1st August. This latter date\nis indelibly fixed in my memory as on that morning from what\ncause I cannot say but on that morning I told my daughter\nthat a boat race would start from London Bridge at 12 noon\nto Chelsea for Doggett's Coat and Badge, and that when I was\na boy I saw it start on one occasion.\nMy daughter who died in Australia went out and married an\nAustralian soldier whom she nursed in Colchester Military Hospital.\nShe was married in Sydney 2-5 May 1920 and went to live on\na Soldier's Settlement at Milperra Bankstown. Within 6 months\nhe deserted her and went off with a married woman who was a\nwitness at the Wedding and helj^ed to select some of the furni-\nture for the home paid for with money my daughter cabled him.\nThis of course worried her very much but she would not let\nus know by writing about it to us nor would she allow anyone\nelse to communicate her circumstances. She followed him 300\nmiles up and down K.S. Wales trying to reclaim him for about\n20 months without success. At last we know from a friend\nwith whom she stayed for some time that she left off worrying\nabout her husband and was worrying about us. She was very\nmuch attached to her sister (Ethel) who was 7 years her senior\nand told a neighbour some time before she went out that she\n\" would never meet another woman like her sister Ethel.\" At\nthe end of her nursing at Colchester she had a severe attack\nof pneumonia but as soon as Ethel entered the ward the effect\nwas psychological for she began to get better at once.\nI am enclosing statements from my daughters and I trust that\nthese may be useful to you for the purpose of research.\nJ.

My name was spoken clearly.\nI thought nothing of it at the time, merely remarking \" What\nis the matter with me, I'm certain someone called me.\"\nWe heard six weeks later, that my sister in Australia had\nbecome unconscious the evening of July 31st and died 11.20 a.m.\nAug. 1st.\nEthel Annie Butler.\nA statement from Miss Butler's sister was also enclosed,\nas follows :\n\u2014\n60 Herongate Eoad,\nLondon, E 12.\n29-1-23.\nOn the morning of July 31st between the hour of 9 a.m.\nand 10 a.m. I was upstairs, and twice my sister called up the\nstairs and asked me what I wanted.

A CORRECTION CONCERNING A CASE PUBLISHED IN\nPROCEEDINGS.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014I have received from a friend a letter cor-\nrecting certain statements in the account given in the Journal,\nVol. XVI., and hence in my paper on \" Phantasms of the Living\n'\nin the last number of Proceedings, of the sinking of H.M.S.\nPathfinder and bearing on Miss \" Ann Jones's \" contemporaneous\ndream of September 5, 1914.\nMy friend writes :\n\u2014\nOn page 353 of the October issue of the S.P.R. Proceedings\nthere is a certain inaccuracy in respect of the sinking of the\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1923.\nPathfinder quite immaterial in itself, but as I know how you\nvalue precise statements I venture to draw your attention to it.\nThe time of the exj^losion was 3.50 ; not 4.30. And although\n... the Admiralty at first announced it as due to a mine,\nit was in fact due to a torpedo. . . .\nThe fact that the ship was torpedoed and not mined\nseems to me to be of special interest in relation to Miss\n\" Ann Jones's \" swoon like state, inasmuch as it initiated\na new method of warfare and as such may have had a\nmore powerful influence on the dreamer.\nIn support of her statement my friend enclosed a copy of an\ninteresting account of the wreck written on the next day by her\nson, who was one of the survivors, and a letter from the Captain\ndescribing this account as excellent.\nI agree with my correspondent in thinking that the fact of\nthe ship having been torpedoed\u2014not sunk by a mine\u2014is im-\nportant. For whereas striking a mine would have been a sudden\nevent not anticipated at the moment by anyone, the torpedoing\nwould be the result of meditated action which the perpetrators\nmay have been endeavouring to carry out even before Miss\nJones's swoon-like state began. Contrary, therefore, to what I\nsaid in my paper, this state may in both her experiences have\nbeen part of the telepathic effect. The whole experience\u2014swoon-\nlike state and drowning dream\u2014would on this hypothesis be in\nthe case of the AmpJiion a deferred impression, and in the case\nof the Pathfinder a contemporaneous one influenced both by the\nplanning and the fatal result. This is of course conjecture only,\nbut not entirely baseless, and it is important to find hypotheses\nwhich harmonise different experiences.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nDec. 15, 1922.\nII. ON THE PROCESS OF TRANSMISSION.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014The Rev. W. S. Irving's article in the May\nissue contains suggestions of considerable interest, upon which he\ninvites comments.\nOn his first point, viz. that communicators prepare in advance\nthe material given at a sitting, I would like to observe that if\nthis surmise is correct it would afford an explanation of the fact\n\fJuly, 1923. Correspondence. 119\nthat the communication purporting to be given about Abraham\nFlorentine coincided verbatim with the obituary notice published\nin the States (see S.P.R. Journal, Nov. 1921).\nIn his second suggestion Mr. Irving says, \" Everything happens\nas if the control actually saw, heard and smelt.\" A recent\nexperience of my own has a feature of special significance in this\nconnection.\nA communication came to me last year through my friend\nMiss Bazett, who has for several years past been receiving messages\nfor bereaved persons, frequently from complete strangers to her.\nPrevious to the communication above referred to I had received\na letter \" from a friend (S. G.) through her mediumship. As it\ncontained evidential matter, it occurred to me to ask Miss Bazett\nif she could again get into touch with S. G. to put two test\nquestions to her. One was a mental question (not expressed to\nthe medium), which was answered satisfactorily, but not sufficiently\ndefinitely to be up to the S.P.R. standard. In the second ques-\ntion I asked : Could S. G. say how she always closed her letters\nto me l I added, \" She always signed her name or initials, but\nI do not mean that ; she had her own way of ending her letters\nto me almost invariably.\" Miss Bazett had never seen one of\nher letters to me, and I knew she had no normal means of know-\ning the correct answer. She willingly co-operated to obtain this,\ntest, as she realises the value of such tests as much as I do\nmyself.\nIn the \" controlled script \" I found no reply to this question :\nbut the impressions received by Miss Bazett at the time the\nscript was written appeared to convey the following correct\nanswer. At the same time Miss Bazett had a very correct impres-\nsion of the personal appearance of S. G., with this auditory\nimpression. It must be remembered that she had never seen her\nor heard her speak. The part of her impression bearing on Mr.\nIrving's suggestion is as follows :\n\" Some word beginning PH,\nending in S. or ES. She would enunciate words very clearly\n[correct] I think articulation exceedingly clear, not smeared in any\nway\u2014low and clear [correct]\u2014Vowels like AE or A in the middle\nof the word\u2014very nice articulation clear speech. A word like\n.PHASES, possibly, or rhyming with it. . .\n.\" Later :\n\u2014\" There is\na poetic touch\u2014the idea of FRIEND elaborated in some sort of\nexpression.\"\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1923.\nS. G. always closed her letters to me with the words :\n\" Your\nfaithful friend.\" When I first read this impression I could see\nHo meaning in the letters PH. A E, but as they were in capitals\nit seemed likely that they had some special significance ; when I\nread them as a syllable I was struck by the fact that PHAE\nproduces the sound of the first three letters of the word \" faith.\"\nIf S. G. was trying to convey that word to her mental sense of\nhearing Miss Bazett would get this impression, which she repro-\nduced as literally as possible in spelling. \" Th \" is a difficult\nsound to catch, and is not capable of reproduction in other letters\nof the alphabet, but might easily be mistaken for \" S.S.\" One\nhas only to pronounce the word \" faith \" in a whisper to recognise\nthis. I imagine that, having failed to convey the whole\nword by the auditory method, S. G. tried to convey the sense of\nit in the later sentence by referring to \" the idea of FRIEND\nelaborated in some sort of expression.\" She, no doubt, relied\nupon my being able to understand what she was trying to convey ;\nand I did.\nI have thought it worth while to report this experience fully,\nbecause it supports Mr. Irving's suggestion, and, also, because it\naffords a possible explanation of some apparent errors in giving\nnames. If the communicator is trying to impress the auditory\nfaculty of the recipient, and the latter translates the sound impres-\nsions exactly into letters of the alphabet, the spelling of the name\n(for sight) may be quite wrong. \" PHAE \" and \" fai \" are not\nequivalents for sight, but they are for sound.\nMr. Irving's third suggestion finds corroboration in many com-\nmunications, some of which are, if I remember right, published\nin the S.P.R. Proceedings. They seem to indicate that the com-\nmunicator is not always aware whether his message has been\nreceived. H. A. Dallas.\nREVIEWS.\nI.\n0 Trabalho dos Mortos. (Livro do Joao). By Dr. Nogueira de\nFaria. Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. 1921. Pp. xvii, 221.\nThis is an account of the phenomena which are said to occur in\nthe presence of Madame Prado, the wife of Eurij^edes Prado,\na merchant in Belem do Para, Brazil. Sujiporting the reality\n\fJULT, 1923. Reviews. 121\nof the phenomena are a great number of local medical men\nand others, including Dr. Jose Texeira da Matla Bacellar, Dr.\nI. Xavier de Carvalho, Dr. Pio de Andrade Ramos and many\nothers. The circle is a typically spiritualistic one, with all the\ncustoms and traditions common in gatherings of the kind. At\nthe sittings a dim light only was provided, and the medium\neither sat in a cabinet, a cage or at the table. Varied phenomena\nare reported to have been observed, of which the chief were the\nfull form materializations which walked and talked as in the\ngolden days of spiritualism. Several photographs were taken,\nand some of these are reproduced in the book. Thus Grav.\n4, p. 17, illustrates the spirit of \" Joao,\" to whom the book is\ndedicated. The phantom appears as if dressed in a voluminous\nsheet, with white stockings and muffler. The face seems curiously\nflat, and even the head is something like the handle of a basket\nbound up with white material. These flat faces seem, as in the\ncase of Gazzera, characteristic of Mme. Prado's mediumship.\nGrav. 29 illustrates such a formation in a striking way. The\nmedium is seated in a cage, beside the side of which is a second\ncage containing two buckets of melted paraffin wax. From\nthe medium's mouth proceeds a broad band of white substance,\npart of which goes to form a flat strip of material on which\nat the top is seemingly stuck a flat doll-like head, whilst the\nother part proceeds in a narrower strip into the second cage,\nTvhere it falls down towards the buckets, appearing rather like\na crude hand at its lower part. With this photograph Grav. 9-a\nmay be compared, and the similarity with the productions of\nLinda Gazzera can hardly fail to be recognized. On the other\nhand, the thick hands and solid masked head in Grav. 30 are\nreminiscent of Kluski's earlier efforts, whereas the form photo-\ngraphed on Grav. 32 is a combination of the two. Here we\nhave what appears to be an ordinary person arrayed in a sheet,\nwith bare hands and one bare foot, whilst the face is absent,\na child's portrait being apparently attached to the sheet at the\npoint which covers the \" real \" face of the form, a decidedly\nstartling effect. Among other phenomena recorded are a number\nof wax moulds, finger-print impressions, direct writings, apparent\ncases of dermographism, apports and a series of transparent\nphantoms of which photographs are included. Although the\nconditions would probably not satisfy a critical investigation,\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

What is wanted is a connected series of sittings\nunder scientific guidance and control with the object not only\nof securing evidence of the reality of the phenomena, but also\nof discovering the common factor seemingly present in all materiali-\nzation processes from Warsaw to Belfast, from Turin to Copen-\nhagen or from Munich to Para.

D.\nIII.\nLola, or The Thought and Speech of Animals. By Henny Kinder-\nMANN. Translated by Agnes Blake : with a Chapter on\nThinking Animals by Dr. William Mackenzie. Methuen\n& Co., Ltd., 36 Essex Street, W.C., London.\nThis is a book which it is easier to ignore than to place rightly.\n\fJuly, 1923. Reviews. 123\nIt contains a detailed account by a German lady of her education\nof, and intercourse with, an Airedale terrier, Lola, daughter of\nRolf, the Mannheim dog who has long been classed with the\nThinking Horses of Herr Krall. Lola was taught to rap replies\nto audible questions : to each letter of the alphabet a number\nwas assigned, not necessarily corresponding to its place in the\nalphabet, and by using the left paw for tens and the right for\nunits spelling seems to have proceeded fairly rapidly. Among\nthe minor difficulties raised by these performances and those of\nthe horses who communicate similarly, it does not seem to have\nbeen yet observed how un-natural a decimal system of numeration\nmust be to animals not possessing ten distinct digits.\nFraiilein Kindermann believes that she has not only taught her\ndog to spell, to read and tell the time, to do sums of quite\nadvanced difficulty, and to know the days of the week, but that\nthe dog is capable of intercourse, as the following incident suggests.\nLola had been going after game disobediently, and had also been\nlosing flesh, and when questioned about her behaviour by her\nmistress persistently affirmed that her condition was due to her\nwant of honour. One day the following discourse took place\n:\n^'\nHave you any excuse to make for such behaviour ?\n\" \" Yes.\"\n\"Then, what is it?\" \" Ich ohne er \" ( = 1 am without honour).\n\" But, Lola, you are only making things worse\u2014if you are naughty\n-and go off like this after game !\n\" \" Zu schwer zu leben !\n\"\n(=too difficult to live!). \"Lola! how can honour be made good\nagain?\" \" Wenn ich sterbe !\n\" (=if I die). When we consider\nthat the idea of honour is a special product of chivalry and one\nnot at all familiar to children or savages, it is difficult to suppose\nthat it had really taken root in Lola's mind. Moreover, when we\nfind her mistress convinced that in some cases there was thought\ntransference between herself and the dog, we may question whether\nthis was not taking place when she believed herself to be passive.\nA valuable part of the book is the additional chapter by Dr.\nWilliam Mackenzie of Genoa, who attributes these phenomena to\na, very particular psychic relation between the animal and his\nmaster.\" Fraiilein Kindermann herself lays stress on her belief\nthat one particular person is most en rapport with a particular\ndog ; she concludes that her dog is really unconscious of the\nideas supposed to emanate from her. And yet the mind of the\ndog seems a necessary element for many of the results. To the\n\f124 Journal of Society for PsycJtical Research. July, 1923.\npresent reviewer some such theory as the following seems plaus-\nible : \u2014In physical nature there are certain objects which reflect\nothers, as water and glass\u2014in them we become aware of aspects\nof ourselves which otherwise would remain unknown to us ; and\nif we were not so familiar with looking-glasses we should not at\nfirst recognise these images as in any way caused by ourselves.\nMay these not equally be reflected in the psychic world ? and may\nnot the imperfect mind of the dog and the trance mind of the\nmedium be the means of revealing to us aspects of our own minds\nhitherto unrecognised ?\nTelepathy co-existent with mediumistic action is Dr. Mackenzie's\ntheory, and he compares the action of the animal and that of a\nspeaking table, but a table with live feet and a nervous system,\n\" so that the subliminal action of the investigator is enough by\nitself to work it.\" The rapidity with which the animal learns\nits lessons even when apparently quite inattentive favours this\nhypothesis. . \u201e\n'\n^ Agnes Fry.\nIV.\nLa TelejMthie. By E. Warcollier, Ingenieur-CMmiste. Felix\nAlcan. 20 frcs.\nThis book well deserves the tribute paid to it by Prof. Richet,\nwho writes the introduction, of being a scientific contribution\nto the subject. Monsieur Warcollier has evidently made a special\nstudy of telepathy for many years and has himself carried out\na large number of experiments ; in some of his most successful\nresults he has himself played the part of percipient.\nIn one respect M. Warcollier is at issue with the majority\nof his fellow researchers in this country. He seems to find very\ndifiicult of acceptance the idea that telepathy may be a purely\npsychic process, operating between one mind and another (and\nincidentally he rejects the hypothesis of telepathic communica-\ntion between the living and the dead) ; he conceives it as a\npsycho-physical process consisting in the transmission of certain\nvibrations from one living brain to another, the process being\nin the first instance wholly unconscious on both sides. \" If I\nthink of the word '\nred '\nor the word '\nmother,' \" he says, \" why\nshould not the vibratory currents which result from the emotional\nstimuli of these words, be capable of producing identical vibra-\ntory currents in a brain similarly constructed to my own ?\n\"\n\fJuly, 192:5. Reviews. 125\nHe suggests that these vibrations are transmitted in all directions\nin the same manner as light, heat, etc., but in the great majority\nof cases they never rise into the percipient's consciousness, being\nignored or suppressed on the Bergsonian theory of selection to\nmeet the practical needs of life.\nM. Warcollier\"s suggestions as to the ultimate nature of tele-\npathy are admittedly a [matter of theory only and are fraught\nwith difficulties which to some of us may seem insuperable. But\neven if we are not inclined to follow him in these speculations,\nwe shall find much that is interesting and valuable in the large\nsection of his book which is devoted to a record of experiments\nand to a discussion of such practical questions as what are the\nconditions most conducive to telepathy, and what kind of ideas\nor sensory stimuli are most easUy transferred.\nIt is impossible in a short review to give any detailed account\nof M. Warcollier's results\u2014those who are interested may read\nhis records for themselves\u2014but he puts forward one suggestion\nto which it seems worth while to call attention here. In common\nwith other experimenters in this field M. Warcollier has been\nimpressed by the extreme tediousness of the simpler forms of\ntelepathic experiment, whereby not only are people discouraged\nfrom making any systematic efforts in this direction, but their\nefforts are less likely to meet with success. He has, therefore,\ngiven a good deal of time and trouble to devising schemes for\nmitigating this tediousness. Many of his schemes have for one\nreason or another proved unsatisfactory, but with one he has\nobtained a certain amount of success and he thinks it worth\nfurther trial.\nThe form of the experiment is based upon an old game of\nchance. The percipient sits with a full pack of cards (52) spread\nbefore him face upwards. The agent, who plays the part of\n\" banker,\" has a complete suit of thirteen cards, well-shuffled,\nfrom which he draws one card at random and looks at it. The\npercipient then selects any card he pleases from those laid out\nbefore him and this card is paired with the agent's card. The\ngame continues in this way, until the agent has \" played \" his\nthirteen cards, and the thirteen pairs of cards are then examined\nto see whether in any case the number of the card selected\nby the percipient (the suit is for this purpose immaterial) tallies\nwith the number of the corresponding card drawn by the agent.\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1923.\nAt the beginning of each game the percipient should pay his\nstake (say, one counter) to the banker (the agent) on the under-\nstanding that if in that game there is no instance of corresponding\nnumbers the banker keeps the stake, but for each case of corre-\nspondence he pays the amount of the stake to the percipient.\nNow chance will give one set of corresponding numbers in each\ngame of thirteen cards, and therefore on a sufficiently prolonged\nseries, if the results are attributable to chance alone, the agent\nand percipient should be quits ; but any telepathic power on the\npart of the percipient will weight the scales in his favour.\nTwo further points should be noted :\n(1) between each game\nthe percipient's pack should be taken up, shuffled, and laid\ndown again, so that the cards are not always in the same rela-\ntive jMsitions ; (2) the agent and percipient should, if possible,\nsit in different rooms, as they did in M. Warcollier's experiments.\nThey must in any case have a substantial screen between them.\nUpon each occasion that M. Warcollier was able to try this\nexperiment the percipient won, which seems encouraging,\u2014at\nleast to persons possessed of telepathic powers. If any of our\nmembers are moved to spend the winter evenings in a telejaathic\ngamble, it is to be hoped that they will give the Society the\nbenefit of their results !\nM. Warcollier records in detail a series of experiments he\ntried with a friend of his on the same general lines as the ex-\nperiments between Miss Miles and Miss Ramsden, recorded in\nour Proceedings. He played the part of percijaient himself and\nsome interesting results were obtained.\nIn conclusion, let us hope that M. Warcollier will be able to\ncontinue his experiments and that others will be incited to follow\nhis example. Especially we may hope that his book will stimulate\ninterest in France, where in recent years the efforts of psychical\nresearchers have been mainly directed to the physical branch\nof the subject. H. de G. S.\nV.\nMetapsychica Moderm. By Dr. W. Mackenzie (of Genoa).\nThe first thing I wish to say regarding Dr. W. Mackenzie's\nbook, is to express the wish that some capable translator will\nspeedily render it accessible to the English student who does\nnot possess knowledge of the Italian language.\n\fJuly, 1923. Reviews. 127\nThe book, -^vhile it is inevitably to some extent a record and\nrepetition of mucli that has already been published (for Dr.\nMackenzie aims at giving the Italian reader a clear and very\ncomplete record of the principal lines along which Psychical\nPhenomena have been observed and investigated in recent years),\nis far more than a mere record. While treating his fellow investi-\ngators, past and present, with a courtesy and respect not always\na,ccorded in critical works, Dr. Mackenzie gives his readers, in\nevery branch of phenomena with which he deals, thoughtful and\ninteresting comments of his own.\nHe is remarkably just and unbiassed in his opinions and con-\nveys the impression that neither scepticism nor its antithesis\nhave any undue part in his conclusions, with which the reader\nmay or may not be in agreement.\nIn dealing with dubious matter, such as psychic photography,\netc., Dr. Mackenzie contents himself with referring to those\nrecorded incidents which strike him as best authenticated and\ntherefore at least worthy of due consideration. He goes so\nfar as to say that a small number of records of such cases\nstrike him as being incontestibly reliable reports of genuine pheno-\nmena.\nThe first half of his book deals at some length with the more\nimportant cases of varied supernormal phenomena recently dis-\ncussed and investigated. Thinking and calculating animals, such\nas the Elberfeldt horses and Rolf, the Mannheim dog, whose\nprogeny, and notably his daughter Lola, have (if Miss Kinder-\nmann's record of her pets' achievements is to be believed, and it\ncertainly has every appearance of care and sincerity) not only\nequalled but exceeded their sire's prowess. And here Dr. Mackenzie\nexpresses himself as equally dissatisfied with the hypothesis that\nattributes the performances of these animals to fraud on the\npart of their trainers, with that which seeks for their explanation\nsolely in the animals' intelligence, and with that which would\nexplain the whole matter as resulting from a telepathic\nlapport between beast and trainer. Dr. Mackenzie prefers\u2014and\nto my mind, correctly\u2014the supposition that the explanation of\nthese animal phenomena may be found in a combination of\ntheir own intelligence and a hitherto unsuspected and therefore\nundeveloped capacity of the higher animals for acquiring tele-\njpathically from certain persons and under certain conditions.\n\f128 Journal of Society \/or Psychical Research, jult, 1923.\nfacts and statements which would be quite beyond their own\ncomprehension.\nDr. Mackenzie deals at some length with the apparent mathe-\nmatical faculty demonstrated by these trained animals, and\ngives a record of the same faculty as observed in a human\nsubject, a lawyer of his acquaintance, when in the hypnotic\nstate, and purporting to be \" controlled \" by an invading \"\nspirit\n\"\nAnother section treats] of the experiments of Dr. von'' Schrenck-\nNotzing, Mme.

Radclyffe-Hall the following\nreport of some incidents which have occurred at sittings held loith\nMrs. Leonard during this year. According to their usual habit\nMiss Radclyffe-Hall and Una, Lady Troubridge, have tahen these\nsittings joinily, and the 'pwyorting communicator is again A.V.B.\n\fOct., 1923. On Some Evidence of Personal Identity. 131\n{see Proc. S.P.K. Vol. XXX., pp. 339-554). But on the occasions\ndescribed below the evidence obtained related not to A. V.B,\nherself, but to another jjerson, referred to here as Mrs. X., and\nshowed Jcnoivledge of matters concerning which the sitters themselves\nwere in a large Pleasure ignorant.\nThe identity of Mrs. X. is known to the Society, and detailed\nrejjorts of the sittings in question are in our 'possession.\u2014Ed.]\nIt occurs to Una, Lady Troubridge, and myself, that the\nfollowing short resume of evidence received through Mrs.\nLeonard, concerning a lady whom we call Mrs. X., may\nbe of interest to readers of the Journal. The interest lies in\nthe fact that Mrs. X. was almost a complete stranger to us,\nand that we knew nothing to speak of about her private life\nand incidents concerning it. We had lunched with Mrs. X.\non one occasion in London, and had met her once or twice\nout walking at Hove ; as far as she is concerned that was the\nextent of our acquaintance. One of her daughters is an intimate\nfriend of ours, her other daughter we barely know. Mrs. X.\nhas a son whom we do not know very well either.\nMrs. X. died during the late summer of 1922. Her daughters\nwere anxious to obtain communications through Mrs. Leonard\nif possible. One daughter could not get an appointment, and\nthe other was sxiffering from shock owing to her mother's\ndeath, and was not in a condition to take a sitting ; she\nwas however most anxious to get some tidings regarding\nher mother, so that on January 24, 1923, I introduced the\nsubject at a sitting with Mrs. Leonard during an A.V.B.\ncontrol. I mentioned Mrs. X.\"s daughter by her Christian\nname (I did not give the surname). A.V.B. had been\nan old friend of Miss X., and has often mentioned her\nat Leonard sittings by her Christian name. It may be as well\njust here to state that the Miss X. in question had had one\nsitting with Mrs. Leonard prior to her mother's death ; she\nwas accompanied to that sitting by Lady Troubridge and\nmyself. I conducted the sitting and Lady Troubridge took the\nnotes, and nothing of any kind was said regarding Mrs. X.,\nthe sitting being entirely concerned with the deceased Mr. X.\nOn January 24, 1923, I told the A.V.B. Control that some-\none connected with T. (Miss X.'s Christian name) had lately\npassed over. A.V.B. replied that she knew that, and that the\na2\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1923.\nperson in question had not passed over in the last few days\nbut a little while ago. Mrs. A. had died al^out five months\nprior to this sitting. A.V.B. did not volunteer any further\ninformation on January 24, and the subject was dropped.\nOn March 14, 1923, the subject was introduced again by\nFeda at the beginning of the sitting and without any sugges-\ntion from us. A.V.B. was said to be speaking on behalf of a\ncommunicator, who was apparently not present in person. A\nnumber of things were said by Feda regarding the late Mrs. X.,\nwhose full surname was finally given quite clearly. On this\ndate some extremely good evidence was obtained\u2014evidence\nwhich left no doubt regarding identity, but for want of space\nwe only propose to give those points which cannot conceivably\nhave been known to us. The first point concerns a house,\nand for the sake of brevity we will not give Feda's actual\nwords (of which of course an accurate record is held), but will\ncondense her remarks to what is essential.\nFeda said that Mrs. X. was interested in a house that, while\nbeing London, was not in the townified part of London, but\nin a part where there would be a good deal of green and a\ngreat many gardens. She said the house was near the river\nin an old part, and again repeated \" Gardens, gardens.\"'\nWe had no reason to suppose that Mrs. X. had been\ninterested in any such place, but her daughters were sent\nquestion papers. The answer to the question with which we\nare now dealing proved that Feda was correct. For many\nyears Mrs. X. had known intimately the owners of an old\nhouse in Fulham, quite near Hurlingham. This house was one\nof those large semi-estates that exist in that part of London.\nIt had extensive groimds sloping down to the river, and Mrs.\nX. had at one time been a very constant visitor there.\nMrs. X.'s old friend to whom the house had belonged had\ndied quite recently at the time of this sitting ; it is suggested\nby Mrs. X.\"s daughter, T., that her mother may have met her\nold friend, and thus been reminded of the house at Fulham.\nThe next question submitted to Mrs. X.'s daughters con-\ncerned a box in which it was said by Feda that the deceased\nlady had kept her handkerchiefs. Feda said that according to\nA.V.B. most people are particular about their handkerchiefs,\nbut that Mrs. X. was extraordinarily so. Mrs. X., she said,\n\fOct., 1923. On Some Evidence of Personal Identity. 133\nkept her handkerchiefs in two places, one of which was a small\ndrawer. This first remark was accurate, but was considered\ntoo usual to be of interest. Feda went on to say that Mrs.\nX. also kept some handkerchiefs in a lined box. She laid\ngreat stress on the word Lined, saying that A.y.B. had been\nparticularly told by Mrs. X. that the box had been lined and\nthat she was to call it \"A lined one.\" Feda went on to say\nthat, according to A.V.B., Mrs. X. had mentioned that point\nparticularly, because so many people keep handkerchiefs in\ncases and so on.\nThe answer to the question paper sent to Mrs. X.'s daughters\nwas to the effect that their mother kept some of her hand-\nkerchiefs in a brocade-Uned box and others in a drawer. This\nincident particularly struck T., as she told me verbally she\nherself had given the box in question to her mother, who\nhad always used it for her handkerchiefs.\nThe third question which we put to the daughters was\nintimately connected with Mrs. X.'s private business. Feda\nsaid that not long before she died she burnt and destroyed\nsome things. Mrs. X. sent a message to the effect that she\nwas not sure that people knew this, but that she expected they\nwould miss one or two things, among which were some letters.\nFeda proved to be right here on two counts. One of the\ndaughters was not certain that any papers had been burnt,\nbut believed they must have been, as many letters which she\nknew had been in her mother's possession were missing after\nher death. The other daughter T. had, unkno^\\Ti to her sister,\nbeen told by the late Mrs. X.'s maid, that shortly before her\ndeath Mrs. X. had burnt a number of papers and letters.^\nThe next question, to which we could not obtain an answer\nfor some little time, concerned the behaviour of Mrs. X.\nduring her last illness. Feda said that not long before Mrs. X.\npassed over she did something pecuhar, she would take her\nfeet from under the bedclothes and hang them dow^n over the\n^It has since been discovered by one of Mrs. X.'s daughters (who has now made\nan exhaustive search for papers belonging to her mother), that letters written to\nher by both her daughters, which she had kept from the earliest times, are\nmissing, including those from her daughter T., when the latter was on active\nservice during the war. It is considered that the only explanation of this must\nbe, that iVIrs. X. destroj^ed these letters with the others, shortly before she died.\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1923.\nside of the bed, and Feda again emphasised that this was not\nlong before death. This point was verified by the late Mrs. X.\"s\nmaid, who assured T. that Feda had been quite correct and\nthat Mrs. X. had persisted in taking her feet from under the\nbedclothes and hanging them over the side of the bed during\nlier last illness.\nThe next bit of evidence given through Feda is amusing\nas well as evidential, and perhaps constitutes the best thing\nin this sitting. Feda said that Mrs. X. had something pecuhar\nthat she wore on her head which she had been asked not to\nwear. She said that A.V.B. said that she had not been asked\nvery seriously not to wear it, but had been asked jokingly to\nput it away. She had however insisted on wearing this thing\non her head. A.V.B. says through Feda that the thing was\nnot serious in itself, but that it was important because Mrs. X.\nhad insisted so on wearing it. And just here Feda told me\nthat A.V.B. was not making her see anything, she was only\nmaking her feel that there was something on her head ; she\nadded, that Mrs. X. was teased about this a little.\nMrs. X.'s daughter T. was able to verify this fully. She\nstated that at one time her mother had had a switch of false\nhair which she insisted on wearing. The hair did not match\nher own, of which incidentally she had plenty, and her\ndaughter T. constantly urged her to discard the false hair, she\nalso teased her about it a great deal. However, Mrs. X. was\nobdurate and would joke with the maid about the false hair\nin front of T., saying that she knew Miss X. disliked her\nwearing it, but that nevertheless she was to give it her as\nshe intended to put it on. This point regarding the hair was\nverified by Mrs. X.'s other daughter as well as by T.\nI wish to make it quite clear that at the time Lady\nTroubridge and myself met Mrs. X., which was not very long\nbefore she died, she was not wearing the false hair in question.\nNothing had ever been said to us regarding the false hair, the\nfirst intimation that such a thing existed was given to us by\nFeda during this sitting.\nNothing further in connection with Mrs. X. occurred until\nApril 7, 1923, on which date the old lady herself arrived\nat the sitting with A.V.B. (according to Feda). Feda gave\nMrs. X.'s surname in full again.\n\fOct., 1923. On Some Evidence of Personal Identity. 135\nFeda stated that someone whom Mrs. X. had known\nfell out of a high window. She said that the letter D. was\nconnected with this person and that there had been a great\nupset about the accident at the time.\nAlthough the coimection of the letter D. has not been traced\nthis bit of evidence is interesting because, fortunately, we do\nnot all know people who meet with such a tragic end.\nAccording to Mrs. X.'s daughters, Mrs. X. had a friend who\nfell out of a high ^^^indow some time ago. The lady in question\nwas in London society, and the event caused a considerable\nstir, being much discussed by people, including Mrs. X.\nFeda next stated that she was being shown a piece of black\nsatin, that the commimicator was folding over the ends and\ndoubling it over, and then stitching on some gold trimming.\nThis is not a very important piece of evidence, as most old\nladies do some sort of needlework. It is worth mentioning,\nhowever, because Mrs. X.'s daughters state that their mother\ndid a great deal of fancy sewing, making a great many such\nthings as bags and sachets, and that moreover she was a very\nbeautiful needlewoman.\nFeda next spoke about some silver. She said that a little\nwhile before Mrs. X. passed over she had been talking and\nthinking aboiit packing some silver to send away somewhere\nfor a special purpose. Feda was careful to state that Mrs. X.\ndid not say it was a present, according to Feda it was \" Not\nlike giving a present, more like sending it away for a purpose.\"\nIn this connection silver is not strictly correct, the allusion\nmust refer to gold plate. According to Mrs. X.'s daughters,\nnot long before her death their mother sent some silver gilt\nplate to her son in the country. The plate was only lent to\nhim for a special occasion.\nFeda next gave a message to the effect that Mrs. X.'s\ndaughter had been thinking about France and a journey quite\nrecently. We knew this, so it is not of much interest, and we\nonly mention it because Feda went on to say, that the daughter\nhad been thinking about France actually on the morning of\nthis sitting. That point we were unable to verify to our\ncomplete satisfaction ; but the reference to France has its\nimportance, because Feda went on to say that according to\nMrs. X., the daughter was wondering whether her last shoes\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., i'J23.\nwould do or whether she would have to get others. Feda\nsaid that shoes had been in the daughter's mind rather\nspecially.\nAs I have stated, we knew that Mrs. X.'s daughter was\ngoing to France, and we also knew that she was going there\nto fence. We did not know, however, that she had been\nworried regarding her fencing shoes. When questioned, by us.\nMiss X. stated, that about a week prior to this sitting she\nhad begun to think about getting new fencing shoes, and\nhad visited several bootmakers in her efforts to do so. The\nshoes, she stated, had been very much on her mind, as they\nare an important part of every fencing outfit. She eventually\nordered the shoes on April 12, 1923.\nThis completes the evidence regarding Mrs. X., that was\nquite unknown to Lady Troubridge and myself at the time of\nthe sittings. A little more evidence was obtained on April 18,\n1923, but has not been verified so far. It concerned a friend\nof Mrs. X.'s youth, and is likely to be very difficult to trace,\nthe more so as Feda could not succeed in getting this friend's\nname through clearly. From April 18 up to the moment of\nwriting, namely, August 29, 1923, no reference has been made\nto Mrs. X. at any of our Leonard sittings.\n(Signed) M. Radclyffe-Hall.\nCASE.\nDream Memoky.\nThe following account of a dream has been sent to us by Miss\nS. Boucher James, a member of the Society. As she points\nout there is no evidence in it of telepathy or other super-\nnormal process. It is merely an instance of unusual working\nof memory in dream. But as such it has an indirect interest\nfor us and bearing on our work. Miss James recorded the\ndream in writing on December 2, 1922\u2014three weeks after its\noccurrence\u2014and she has shown us the notes then made. The\naccount here given, sent on February 9, 1923, was based by\nher on her original record with slight alterations made for the\nsake of clearness, which do not affect the main points.\nShe writes :\n\u2014\nOn November 12 [1922] I dreamt I was standing with a friend on\n\fOct., 1923. Case. 137\na wharf and the vessel iu front of lis started on its voyage rising\nabout 200 ft. in the air. (Which of course did not surprise me.)\nAn appalling disaster followed, wreckage and three explosions in\nthe sky. After it was over I met another friend and proceeded\nto describe the whole incident to her, but when it came to the\nactual moment before the disaster there was a hiatus in my\nmemory. After an ineffectual effort to remember I missed that\npart out and described what followed. I woke and was recalling\nthe dream, and when I got to the gap in my memory to my\nsurprise after a second's thought I was able, now I was awake,\nto fill it in. The forgotten part was that the vessel had suddenly\nturned completely over and I had said to my companion \"'\nShe\nhas no business to do that\u2014she's not an aeroplane.\"\nSo often on waking one cannot recall certain details, but to be\nable to recall details which in one's dream one could not does\nseem to me fantastical.\nIn answer to enquiries Miss Boucher James gave further\nparticulars, not previously recorded, which seem to show clearly\nthat her dream could be divided into two sections, in the\nsecond of which she could not remember, and was aware of\nnot remembering, part of the first, though regarding it as a\nreal experience through which she had just passed. When she\nawoke she could remember both sections definitely and appar-\nently completely.\nIt may be worth noting that on November 11, the night\nb>efore the dream just described. Miss James had another dream\nwith a somew'hat similar memory experience in it, only in\nthis case the effort to recover the memory w'as successful.\nShe saj^s :\n\u2014\nI threw my mind back as one does in real life to search for the\nincident [very slightly referred to by a friend in the dream]. I\npicked up the thread almost at once and all the unmentioned\ndetails flashed back to me. The picked up incident was appar-\nently a pure dream memory.\nMiss James says that \"though quite an industrious dreamei\nthe memory detail in each \" of these dreams was new to her.\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1923.\nPROFESSOR RICHET S ADDRESS AT THE INTER-\nNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PHYSIOLOGISTS.\nAt the International Congress of Physiologists held last July in\nEdinburgh, Professor Charles Richet, Professor of Physiology\nin the University of Paris, read a paper entitled \" Les Voie\u00bb\nnon sensorielles de la Connaissance et la Methode Experimentale,\"\nProfessor Sir Edward Schafer being in the chair.\nThe occasion is a notable one in the history of psychical\nresearch and we give below some extracts from Prof. Richet's\npaper, taken from a report which appeared in The Scotsman\nof July 25, 1923 :\u2014\nProfessor Richet said that although he appeared to discard\nclassic physiology he knew how to remain within its limits. What\nindeed was classic physiology if it was not experiment ? . . . When\nthe immortal Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood by\nincontrovertible experiments, he destroyed the classic physiology\nof Galen, Hippocrates, and of Aristotle, and provoked for twenty-\nfive years the indignation of the professors. . . .\nWhat he was going to expound to them was very revolutionary,,\nand he would expose himself to vigorous and innumerable objec-\ntions. . . . The proposition which he was there to defend and\nprove by experimental method was this\u2014that there were, for the\nknowledge of reality, other channels than the sensory and normal,\nchannels. . . . He was not alone in his defence of this theory,\nand it was above all among English men of learning that he\nfound his forerunners and defenders. . . . After reciting numerous\ninstances of unexplained cognition. Prof. Richet said he hoped\nthere would be no more doubt in their minds, in spite of the\nnovelty of his conclusions, that other ways were open to our-\nconsciousness than the normal ways of our senses. ... If he had\nspoken of these matters in that solemn Congress, it was because\nhe considered them as pertaining to physiology. It was a new\nchapter of physiology which he sought to introduce to their classic\nscience. He knew too well the wisdom of the physiologists to-\nbelieve that they would refuse to admit it. They would forget\ntheir theories and bow to the facts ; for the facts were there,,\nmany and inexorable. . . . When it was objected regarding these\nprecise experiments, these careful observations, that they were\ncontrary to the common perception, he felt he had the right to^\n\fOct., 1923.

It required a sensitive\nto prove their reality. Here was a field open for their investiga-\ntions. Certainly the difficulties were great, but since when did\nthey refuse to study a problem under the pretext that it was\ndifficult ? Above all they should not let themselves be prejudiced\nby the credulity of the spiritists. He did not wish to say any Ul\nof the spiritists, although they had been at times very hard on\nhim. They and he had principles quite different. He believed\nonlv in science, experience and observation. They on the other\nhand had theories ready made. . . . Assuredly, he did not deny\nthat their theories might be acceptable. . . . But before establish-\na theory, it was necessary to study the facts. This should be\ntheir task. He would like to see physiologists, well-informed,\nsceptical, cautious, take up the study of cryptesthesia.\nCONCEKNING PROFESSOR RICHET'S \"THIRTY YEARS\nOF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\"\n[We have been asked by Sir William Barrett to jmnt in the\nJournal the following correspondence between himself and Professor\nRichet, as he ivishes to draw the attention of Members to the matters\nthere discussed.\u2014'Ev.]\n, ,\n24:th August, 1923.\nDear Professor Richet,\nMay I take the liberty of pointing out a few inaccuracies,\nwhich not unnaturally occur, in the wonderful and comprehensive\ncollection of facts contained in your great work Thirty Years of\nPsychical Research.

Oct., 1923.\ncorrectly stated in Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 224, where\nMr. F. W. H. Myers says :\u2014\" When, in 1882, Professor Barrett\nconsulted him [Rev. Stainton Moses] as to the possibility of\nfounding a new Society, he warmly welcomed the plan ; Edmund\n\u20acrurney and I were asked to join, etc.\" They did so, together\nwith Professor H. Sidgwick, who consented to act as the first\nPresident. It was due to the able and active co-operation of these\nthree eminent men, and later of Mrs. H. Sidgwick, that the S.P.R.\nachieved the respect and success it has won. The reason why it\nseemed necessary to me to form a new Society,\u2014to record and\ncarry on the work of psychical research,\u2014is briefly stated on p. 55\nof my little book on Psychical Research in the \" Home University\nLibrary.\"\n(2) On page 582 and also on p. 752 (456 and 592 E.) you\nstate that the S.P.R. \" started with the axiom and fundamental\nprinciple that there were no material phenomena, that everything\nwas subjective, and rejected everything but telepathy.\" This is\nnot the case. If you will turn to Vol. I. of the Proc. S.P.R.,\np. 4, you will find that one of the original and fundamental\nobjects of the Society was to conduct \" an enquiry into the various\nphysical phenomena commonly called spiritualistic.\" Moreover in\n1886 {Proc. S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 25) I read a paper on \"on some\nphysical phenomena commonly called spiritualistic witnessed by\nthe author.\" It is true that both Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick\nrejected these phenomena, although they had devoted many years\nto the investigation of the subject; but like Mr. Myers and Mr.\nGurney they preserved an open mind. As to Mr. Podmore, he always\ntook the role of \" devU's advocate,\" but the value of his opinion\nmay be judged from what you rightly term, p. 615 (482 E.) his\n\"insinuations against the honesty of Stainton Moses,\" and you\nmight also add against D. D. Home, of whom he made the\nentirely untrue accusation {Journal S.P.R., Vol. XIII.) that Home\n\" selected his sitters with great care \" with the object of choosing\nonly those who were most suggestible ! Mr. Myers and myself\ncarefully investigated the accusations made against D. D. Home\nand found them baseless.\n(3) On pp. 67, 107, 139 (58, 90 and 116 E.) you state that\nthe evidence for thought transference we obtained with the Misses\nCreery is valueless and must not be taken into account as \" fraud\nwas proved.\" This sweeping assertion is quite inaccurate; a\ngreat and cruel injustice has been done to the Misses Creery by\n\fOct., 1923. Pwf. Richefs \" Thirty Years' Psychical Research:' 141\nthe persistent slanders that all the experiments which we made\nwith these young ladies are worthless on account of their trickery.\nOn the contrary, these experiments were of the utmost value, they\nled to the discovery of telepathy, and have never been exceeded\nin their wonderful success. As you have unwittingly lent the\ngreat weight of your name to discredit these experiments it is\nnecessary to trouble you with the facts of the case, which are as\nfollows :\nAfter the discovery\u2014for it was then an entirely new dis-\ncovery\u2014of what I ventured to call '\nthought transference '\nin the\nnormal state, had been announced by me in the scientific journal\nNature for July 7th, 1881, I invited my friends Myers and Gurney,\nand later Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, to take part in the experi-\nments which I was conducting with the Misses Creery in Cheshire.\nWe were all naturally incredulous and gradually imposed more\nand more stringent tests. After a prolonged series of experiments,\nextending over many months, Professor Sidgwick's extreme scepti-\ncism was overcome, and he stated in his Presidential address to\nthe S.P.R. {Proc. SP.R., Vol. II., p. 154) that those who suggest\nthat cheating took place by a simple code of signals quite \" ignore\nsuch cases as that given in Part I., pp. 22 and 23, where the\ncards guessed by one of the Miss Creerys, were entirely unknown\nto anyone but the four strangers who went to witness the experi-\nment, and where, therefore, as I before said, the investigators\nmust either have been idiots or one of them in the trick.\" That\nthis conclusion is obvious, anyone can see by referring to the\ndetailed record of our experiments in Vol. I. of the Proc. SP.R.\nTor two or three years the Misses Creery freely gave their time\nto these experiments and cheerfully consented to all the tests we\nimposed. At our request they travelled from their home in\nCheshire to London, Dublin and Cambridge, and interrupted their\neducational studies in order to submit themselves to the repeated\nand wearisome experiments which we made with them.\nAs is always the case the sensitiveness of the Creery's varied\nand after some years their percipience waned, as the S.P.R.\nCommittee noted in their third report. It was under these adverse\ncircumstances, and against the wish and advice of their father\n<see Journal S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 176), that the children went to\nCambridge to submit to some further experiments, which were\nconducted by Gurney and the Sidgwicks. (Guiney's note on the\nsubject is in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 269, 270.) In\n\f142 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., ]923.\nsome of these experiments one of the sisters was allowed to-\nknow the word or thing selected, and anxious to appear successful\nthey were found using a code of signals which was promptly\ndetected and acknowledged. In some of the very early experiments,\nwhich the children thought was only a game, they told us they\nhad also sometimes signalled to each other. This, however, was-\nquite impossible after the stringent tests later imposed, as can be\nseen from the reports of the Committee in the Proc. S.P.R., Vol.\nI., and from the lengthy MS. notes, taken at the time by Myers,\nand which I still possess.\nIn Chapter V. of my little book on Psychical Research, the\nproof sheets of which were read, and some revisions made by Mrs.\nSidgwick, the whole matter is I think fairly set forth. I have\nnever concealed my indignation at the way the Misses Creery\nand their father, the Eev. M. M. Creery, M.A. (a clergyman,,\nas our report states, of unbleinished reputation and integrity) have\nbeen treated after the valuable help they generously and freely\ngave to the S.P.R.\nPardon the length of this explanation which I am grateful to-\nyou for enabling me to make public, and which will, I hope,,\nput an end to a widespread erroneous belief.\n(4) Chapter IV. of yoiir great work is devoted to the so-called\ndivining rod, and you kindly and casually refer to my investiga-\ntions on the subject, but I think you can hardly have read my\ntwo lengthy Eeports, nor the conclusions reached after fifteen\nyears' laborious work. An excellent summary of these conclusions\nwas given by Mr. F. W. H. Myers in Htiman Personality, Vol. I.,\np. 480. As regards the motion of the dowsing rod, and the\nprobable explanation of the dowsing faculty, may I refer you to\nmy second Report, Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 276-314. It was\nnot Chevreul, as you state,\u2014and as is commonly believed,\u2014but\nFather Kircher, S.J. (one of the founders of experimental science),\nwho in 1650,\u2014two centuries earlier,\u2014showed that the motion of\nthe rod was due to involuntary muscular action.\n(5) In your reference to the Reichenbach phenomena, I think\nyou have overlooked the early work of the S.P.R. on the subject.\nAs chairman of the Committee on that subject, I made a\nlengthy series of experiments with numerous subjects, and the\nresults are given in our report in the Proc. S.P.R., Vol. I., p. 230\net seq.\n\fOct., 1923. Pwf.

CHARLES RICHET.\nREVIEW.\nThe Controls of Stainton Moses. By A. W. Trethewy, B.A.\nLondon. Hurst & Blackett.\nStudents of Psychical Research interested in the mediumship of\nStainton Moses are likely to turn to this book in the first instance\nin order to satisfy their curiosity as to the identity claimed by\nhis principal controls, which has not hitherto been made public.\nThey will learn that \" Imperator,\" the chief of the band, said\nhe was the prophet Malachi ; that Rector,\" the j^^^ii^cipal\namanuensis of the band, had been Hippolytus, a Christian bishop\nof the third century, a.d. ;\n\" Doctor,\" Athenodorus, a Stoic philo-\nsopher ;\n\" Prudens,\" Plotinus ; and so forth.\nBut though this revelation is interesting it does not constitute\nthe main value of the book, which lies in its usefulness as a\nguide and help in the study of Stainton Moses's phenomena,\n\u2022especially as regards spirit identity. Stainton Moses is perhaps\nthe most remarkable private medium\u2014combining as he did most\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1923.\nstartling physical phenomena with automatic writing of a hortatorj\nand larofessedly instructive kind intermingled with evidential\nmatter\u2014of whom we have fairly complete records. And though\nthe interpretation of his phenomena is difficult and, in my opinion\nat least, the evidence taken all together is inconclusive, his case\nwill remain a classic one even when we have learnt more about\nmediumship than we know now. Any light that can be thrown\non his case is therefore important.\nStainton Moses himself published some of the contents of his\nnote-books in his lifetime, and Myers included more in two long\narticles published in the S.P.R. Proceedings, Vols. IX. and XI.\nBut much remains unpublished. The note-books are in the keeping\nof the London Spiritualist Alliance, of which Stainton Moses was\npresident at the time of his death in 1892, and it appeared to\nMr. Trethewy that the time had come when these should be-\npublished in full with such annotations as might be required.\nHaving obtained the necessary consent he has prepared them\nfor publication accordingly, and publication is only delayed\nbecause of the prohibitive present expense of printing and pro-\nducing so large a book.\nThe present volume embodies part of this editorial work and\nis of value by itself. The bulk of it (as we are told in the\nintroduction) \" Consists of evidential information relating to the\nidentity claimed by the communicating spirits.\" There is a\nclassified list of the principal ones (eighty-two in number) \" with\na notice showing the part played by each, the evidence, if any,\nfurnished by him, and an appreciation of his claim \" ; and \" in\nChapter XIII. an attempt is made to consider all the cases as\na whole and to suggest some general conclusions.\" In an appendix:\na summary of all the automatic script extant is given, which\nmay serve as a full table of contents to the proposed book if\nultimately published, and in the meanwhile gives the student\nthe means of referring comparatively easily to what has already\nbeen printed or to the typewritten copy of the note-books in\nthe library of the London Spiritualist Alliance.\nThe matter contained in the jjresent volume is not all new.\nA good deal of the evidence for spirit identity has, as our readers\nwill remember, already been examined both by Stainton Moses\nhimself and by Myers. But Mr. Trethewy's work on it is more-\ncomplete and thorough. He has taken considerable trouble tO'\n\fOct., 1923. Review. 145\nmake it as full and exact as possible, and we may recall as an\nexample that it was at his suggestion that enquiry was made\nin America about newspaper notices of the death of Abraham\nFlorentine, one of the communicators, with the result printed in\nour Journal for November, 1921. It appears that the information\ngiven (by table tilting) at the sitting at which Abraham Florentine\ncommunicated, about a month after his death, together with\nStainton Moses's impression that he had died of a painful illness,\nexactly coincides with\u2014is neither more nor less\u2014than what was\ncontained in the obituary notice. The case must therefore be\nclassed with several others where strangers recently deceased gave\nas evidence of identity just as much information (and no more)\nas could have been derived from their obituary notices had these\nfallen under the eye of Stainton Moses or had he or his controls\nhad access to them clairvoyantly. It is not, of course, necessary\nto suppose any conscious perception.\nIn the case of persons longer dead and known to history, a\nsimilar difficulty arises. The information given is sometimes fuller\nthan that in the recent cases, and is generally though not in-\nvariably correct. But it could have been derived from books,\nand were this not so it would rarely of course be verifiable.\nSome of Stainton Moses's controls claimed the power of reading\nclosed books (as in book tests) and it is undeniable that books\nwere on some occasions copied. In the case of historical person-\nages therefore we have not, and hardly could have, any guarantee\nthat books were not the source of the evidence offered respecting\ntheir identity.\nThe method of cross-correspondence was not used by Stainton\nMoses's controls. They did not profess to communicate through\nother mediums, and indeed at one time refused Stainton Moses's\nrequest that they should do so. The \" Imperator,\" \" Rector,\"\netc., of e.g. Mrs. Piper did not give the earth names alleged\nthrough Stainton Moses to be theirs, nor indeed give any evidence\nof being the same persons as his controls, though they asserted\nthemselves to be so.\nBut with all that is unsatisfactory in the evidence for spirit\nidentity, we have on the other hand certainly one case, \" Blanche\nAbercrombie,\" where the death was announced to Stainton Moses\nbefore it had appeared in any newspaper, and where the automatic\nscript announcing it was in a handwriting resembling that of\nthe deceased lady, who was almost a stranger to him.\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical ReMwrch. Oct., 1923.\nThe above is of course a very inadequate description of the evi-\ndence that has to be studied. The facts I have referred to as well as\nothers are much more fully examined by Mr. Trethewy, and I\nshould endorse almost all he says in his careful discussion, except\nthat he does not seem to me to allow enough for possible\noperation of the subconscious mind unknown to, or unremembered\nby, the normal consciousness. He apparently thinks that if there\nwere such subliminal action it would involve what he calls a plot\nor drama\u2014a scheme planned in detail beforehand and carried\nout through months and years. I see no sufficient evidence of\nsuch a planned sequence. The communications and events might\nall, I think, have followed each other without having been\nforeseen\u2014initiated successively by association of ideas or external\nsuggestion. If Stainton Moses's subliminal mind was responsible\nI should imagine that it was in a dream-like manner\u2014dream\nideas and sleep-walking actions insinuating themselves not only in\ndeep trance, when the normal consciousness was in abeyance, but\nin semi-trance conditions such that though there is no apparent\ninterruption to ordinary life, things may be done of which the\nnormal waking consciousness has no knowledge or at least no\nmemory. That Stainton Moses was liable to both these forms of\ndissociation is certain (see S.P.R. Proceedings, Vol. IX., p. 340) ;\nand it is, moreover, perhaps possible that there was in his case\nan even deej^er division of personality, resembling that exhibited\nin Miss Beauchamp's and other cases.\nI dwell on subliminal possibilities because I agree with Mr.\nTrethewy and with Myers, that Stainton Moses's character and\nposition, the testimony of friends and colleagues, and the circum-\nstances attending his phenomena, make it imjJossible, or at any\nrate almost impossible, to attribute to him habitual conscious\ndeception. The possibility of subliminal deception has, undoubtedly\nhowever, its difficulties. For as Mr. Trethewy points out the\nintelligences responsible for the automatic writing also claim to\nhave jjroduced the physical phenomena and these included, among\nother apparently supernormal occurrences the introduction into\nthe seance room of objects not previously there, which if not\naccomplished by occult means, must have involved preparation\nbeforehand. In trying to form an idea of what really happened\nat these physical seances, allowance must be made for possibilities\nof illusion of the senses and of memory in the observers ;\nespecially\nas there is reason to doubt whether these possibilities were\n\fOct., 1923 Review. 147\nadequately appreciated by Stainton Moses or the friends (Dr. and\nMrs. Speer) wtio habitually sat with him. But no illusion could\naccount for some of the things described\n\u2014\ne.g., liquid scent\nsprinkled on the sitters and not only affecting two senses\u2014touch\nand smell\u2014but leaving visible stains on furniture, etc. Whether\nthings like this can be attributed to subliminal contrivance is the\nquestion that has to be determined. It was some fifty years ago\nthat the events occurred, and naturally Stainton Moses and his friends\nknew less about dissociation and subliminal action than we know\nnow, imperfect though our knowledge still is. If he had known\nmore he would I think have insisted on being searched before\nsittings at which scent, or lights, or any kind of \" apport \" was\nlikely to occur. So far as I know he never did so, and it is perhaps\nfortunate from one point of view that he did not, for had he\ndiscovered that the required objects were, unknown to himself, in\nhis pockets or concealed about his person, the shock would\nprobably have, voluntarily or involuntarily, stopped the j^henomena\nand we should have had no records to study.\nMy object in this review is to call attention to Mr. Trethewy's\nbook, not to discuss the whole complicated question afresh, and\nI think I have said enough to show why I regard the Stainton\nMoses phenomena as inconclusive and yet of great and permanent\nimportance to psychical research. It is unlikely that we shall get\nfurther direct knowledge than has now been obtained concerning\nthis particular case, but indirect light may well be thrown on it\nby investigation conducted with other mediums. In the meanwhile\nas Mr. Trethewy says (p. 193) \" no theory [about it] can be\nproved true, and there are grave objections to all of them.'' If\nwith our present knowledge his conclusion is that the most\nprobable explanation is spirits, while I incline to doubt whether\nin this case it is necessary to assume agency beyond the subliminal\nmind, that is no reason why I should not congratulate him on\nhis book. It is undoubtedly a valuable piece of work and should\nbe in the hands of all who wish to study the phenomena in\nquestion.

It was brought by Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing, and\nrelated to the prohibition of pubhc exhibitions of psychic\nphenomena. This appeared to be an extension of the previous\nproposition, which related to hypnotic phenomena only. Dr.\nSchrenck-Notzing was asked to formulate his ideas on the\nmethods of bringing about such action by the properly con-\nstituted legal authorities.\n(6) It was proposed by the Metapsychical Society of Cracow\nto create an international bureau for establishing a complete\ninternational bibliography of works on psychical research and\nto keep such a bibliography fully up to date. After some\nchanges in the proposal, especially as regards the scope and\nnature of the bibliography, it was agreed that the National\nCommittee should furnish periodical lists of publications to\nsome central authority, and that the list should be published\nas a supplement to the Revue Metapsychiqtie.\n(7, 8) The seventh and eighth propositions brought forward\nrespectively by the Psychophysical Society of Warsaw and by Mr.\nProsper Szmurlo of the same society dealt with (a) the intro-\nduction of lectures dealing with psychical research into higher\ncentres of learning, and (6) the furnishing of prizes to inventors\nof apparatus for the purpose of psychical investigations. These\nwere not accepted by the Congress, and were withdrawn after\nsome discussion.\nAfter a number of minor resolutions were passed, full details\nof which will be published in the forthcoming Report, the\nCongress completed its work and the majority of the members\ndispersed. Dr. Alrutz, Mr. E. J. Dingwall, Dr. Geley, and a\nfew others, however, remained, and a number of sittings were\nsecured with some Polish mediums. During the course of the\nCongress, M. Ossowiecki, whose clairvoyant phenomena are now\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The conditions under\nwhich this was done appear to leave no reasonabh' doubt that\nM. Ossowiecki has the faculty of obtaining information of this\nsort other than through the normal channels of sense. The\ncase has several points of great interest, and a full report will\nappear in the Official Report of the Congress. Further sittings\nwere held with Jan Guzik, whose phenomena have attracted a\ngood deal of attention in Paris recently, also with Stanislawa P.\nand several others.\nIt was finally decided that the next International Congress\nshould be held, circumstances permitting, in Florence in 1926.\nOFFICIAL REPORT OF THE\nINTERNATIONAL CONGRESS AT WARSAW, 1923.\nThe official report of the Congress at Warsaw, containing all\ncommunications made to the Congress, in full and in the\noriginal languages (English, French and German), will be pub-\nlished at the beginning of next year (1924) by the International\nSecretariat.\nThis volume, printed in France, will consist of 350 pages and\nwill be sold to the pubhc at 22 francs.\nMr. Carl Vett, the General Secretary of the international\norganisation, asks us to state that a special reduced price will\nbe allowed to Members of this Society.

A Remarkable Premonitory Crystal Vision. 157\nA REMARKABLE PREMONITORY CRYSTAL VLSION.\nBy Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nMany valuable papers on the subject of crystal vision, some-\ntimes premonitory, will be found in our Proceedings and\nJournal. Our former President, Mr. Andrew Lang, was deeply\ninterested in this subject, and it was I believe the only branch\nof psychical research he studied experimentally, through some\npersonal friends who were \" scryers,\" or crystal gazers. The\npower both of precognition and retrocognition is exhibited by\ncertain sensitives not only in crystal vision, but in deep\nhypnotic trance and in dreams. We owe to Mrs. Henry\nSidgmck's laborious care a most valuable monograph on the\nsubject of Premonitions published in Vol. V. of our Proceedings\nfor 1888. One of the best evidential cases of premonition is\nthat of a fire in Munich in 1886 which was given with singular\ncorrectness and precision in a dream repeated three times over\na month before the fire occurred.\nThen there is the well-known case of the dream by Mr.\nWilliams in Cornwall, of the murder of Mr. Percival, the\nChancellor of the Exchequer in 1812. This dream, also thrice\nrepeated, occurred about a week before the event. Mrs.\nSidgwick regrets that the printed record of the dream which\nshe quotes is twenty years after the di'eam occurred. But in\nthe memoirs of one of the earliest psychical researchers, the\neleventh Duke of Somerset, on p. 335, an earlier record is\ngiven of this dream. I have also lately received from my aged\nfriend. Miss Percival of Chobham (a direct descendant of the\nChancellor), a still earlier record of the same dream which\nagrees in nearly all particulars with that given in the later reports.\nThe following remarkable and tragic case of premonitory\ncrystal vision is not only of very recent date, but some of the\nwitnesses have been mlling to give their personal testimony\nand I am allowed to give the name of the percipient, who is\nMiss St. John Montague, and she has kindly furnished me with\nthe following report of her vision and its fulfilment :\n\u2014\nThe incident which I am about to relate was written down as\nI described it on April 14th, 1920, to the lady, as it came before\nme in the crystal I was holding.\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1923.\nI had run in to see a friend, Mrs. R., and as I entered her\nhouse in Kensington she came out into the hall to meet me,\nsaying how glad she was I had come, as a friend of hers, whom\nI will call \" Mrs. Holt,'\" had just arrived from abroad and had\nasked her to beg me to read the crystal for her. As I was A^ery\npressed for time I suggested doing as she wished at a future\ndate, but my friend begged me to do it at once, ofiering to send\na servant round to my house, which was close by, to get my\ncrystal ball, and not liking to refuse I agreed to do as she asked.\nA few minutes later, having been introduced to the lady, Mrs.\nHolt, who had just arrived from the continent\u2014and who was an\nutter stranger to me,\u2014I gave her my crystal to hold. When I\ntook it from her hands and looked into it I experienced a terrible\nshock. Noticing from my manner that I was disconcerted Mrs.\nHolt asked me if I saw anything to upset me. Fearing to look\nany longer I told her I would prefer not to tell her what I saw.\nShe assured me that nothing I could say would worry her, and\nshe brought such pressure to bear that I gave way and told\nher what I had seen so vividly in the crystal. I obtained her\npermission to write it down after I had described it to her. I\nwarned her as delicately as I could that a gruesome tragedy was\nbefore her, an awful deed which would make her a widow almost\nimmediately. When I had finished, to my surprise she laughed\nmerrily, telling me that it was all quite impossible, that her\nhusband had never been more cheery or in better health and\nthat he had no financial worries, and in fact she was just going\nofi to lunch with him at his club. Rather relieved at the way\nin which she took what I had told her, I looked over the notes\nI had written down shortly after describing the scene word for\nword which I had witnessed in the crystal. The exact copy of\nmy notes is as follows :\n\u2014\n\" I can see a tall fair man rather bald, pacing up and\ndown a small room, evidently a smoking room, close beside\nthe desk is a telephone, he is excitedly taking up the receiver\nand speaking into it, he opens a drawer in the desk and holds\nan object taken from it in his right hand\u2014it is a revolver\u2014\nagain he speaks into the receiver excitedly and watches the\nclosed door on the left eagerly. Once more he speaks into\nthe receiver, and for a moment points the revolver in the\ndirection of the door\u2014apparently listening for someone to\n\fNov., 1923.

With a\nsudden gesture he looks once more at the door and shakes\nhis head as though giving up hope of it opening to admit\nsomeone for whom he seems to be waiting. He raises his\nright hand and staggers back, the revolver is now pointing\nat his own head\u2014then I see blood everywhere gushing. A\nwoman comes into the room, the same woman who is in the\nroom with me now, only in the picture she wears a loose\nwrapper, she lifts his head\u2014blood is everywhere.\" ^\nThree days later, on April 17th, 1920, the husband of my\nfriend, Mrs. R., a Swedish gentleman, came to my house with a\nmessage, and in answer to my invitation to come in he told me\nthat he was on his way to see Mr. Holt who had telephoned for\nhim, explaining (as the name was not remembered by me) that\nMr. Holt was the husband of the lady for whom I had read the\ncrystal two or three days previously, on her arrival from abroad.\nAs he spoke a sudden presentiment came over me, and hardly\nrealising what I said I begged Mr. R. not to go. Amazed he\nstared at me and asked me why he should not go and said that\nMr. Holt had phoned to him three times in a few moments asking\nhim to go at once to him, as \"he wanted to take him with him,\"\nand he was just rushing out to go when his wife asked him to\nleave a note for me on the way. Once more I begged him to\nstay and not to go, and confided to him that I knew he would\nendanger his life if he went. Mr. R. stared at me as though he\ndoubted my sanity, and in answer to my vehement entreaty first\nto ring up his friend Mr. Holt, he went to my phone. There was\nno answer, the Exchange said, from the number given. A moment\nlater Mr. R. hurried off, apparently irritated with me for having\ndelayed his going to his friend from a mere whim. After he left\nI drove to an appointment in Harley Street with a well-known\n1 Fortunately Miss Montague had not destroyed the rough notes she made\nat the time.

Soon after my arrival there I\nwas called to the telephone and when I took up the receiver a\nvoice spoke I hardly recognised as that of Mr. R., who knew\nwhere I had gone.^ He told me that just as he entered the\nhall of his friend, Mr. Holt, he had been startled at the sound of\na revolver shot coming from the direction of Mr. Holt's room. On\ngoing into the house he had found Mr. Holt lying dead just as I\nhad seen him, beside the desk and the telephone receiver, with\na revolver held tightly in his hand. The horrified servant said\nto Mr. R., \" He had been waiting for you, Sir, and was phoning\nfor you to come a little while ago.\" If he had obeyed that\nsummons five minutes earlier, Mr. R. would probably also have\nbeen shot and so have accompanied Mr. Holt. The Doctor's\nopinion was that a sudden madness had seized Mr. Holt, and as\nthis came upon him he felt the craving to take a friend with him\non his journey to the unseen, and no doubt would have shot\nMr. R. and then himself. There was no reason and no motive\nfor Mr. Holt's tragic suicide, other than temporary insanity.\nSome days after the tragic event the poor widow came to me\nto thank me, she said, for having warned her of what was about\nto happen ; but for that warning, though laughed at at the time,\nshe declared to me that the suddenness of the shock might have\nimpaired her reason.\n(Signed) Nell St. John Montague.\nIn an interview with Miss Montague, she kindly arranged\nfor Mr. R. to come and see me. He did so a few days later\nand corroborated the account Miss St. John Montague had\ngiven me, and said that undoubtedly he owed his life to Miss\nMontague's warning. After reading Miss St. John Montague's\naccount Mr. R. wrote the following letter in corroboration :\n\u2014\n\" I have read Miss St. John Montague's account of her crystal\nvision of the tragedy of Mr. Holt. On April 17, 1920, when I\ncalled on Miss Montague, I told her I was going to see Mr. Holt ; she\n1 Miss Montague, in answer to my enquiry, informs me that she left word\nwith her maid that she was going to Dr. Sloan Chesser, and gave the tele-\nphone number in case she was wanted, so that when Mr. R. rang her up the\nmaid gave Dr. S. Chesser's telephone number to Mr. R., who thereupon rang\nup Miss Montague. I have seen Dr. Sloan Chesser, who is a well-known\nand able lady doctor, and she confirms Miss Montague's statement about\nbeing rung up when she was consulting Dr. Chesser. \u2014W. F.

After ringing\nhis front door bell I heard the report of a pistol. A servant opened\nthe door, and when I came in he begged me to wait. A lady then\ncame to see me and asked me to go to her brother in the next\nroom. I did so, and he told me that Mr. Holt had just shot him-\nself. I owe my life to Miss Montague's warning as I have explained\nto Sir William Barrett. (Signed) I. Blomquisst R.\nThe following additional facts were told me by Mr. R.\nThere was an extension telephone from Mr. Holfs room and\nMs servant had to get on to the exchange. The servant said\nMr. Holt asked him to get on to Mr, E.. and to tell him that\nhe, Mr. Holt, wished to see him at once, as he wanted Mr. R,\nto go with him. Mr. Holt then got on to Mr. R. 'himself and\nsaid to Mr. R. over the 'phone, \" Come here at once, as I\nwant you to go with me. Please come within the next five\nminutes.\"\nI asked Miss Montague if she could obtain the evidence of\nthe widow and of the servant at Mr. Holfs house. She replied,\n\" I am sorry to say that the widow feels the recent tragedy\nso much that she does not wish to give her name, nor\ndoes she wish to speak about the subject.\" Miss Montague\nadds\n\u2014\" I have been trying to trace the servant but so far\nwithout success, as he has left his place.\"\nThere remains the newspaper report of the suicide and the\nCoroner's inquest. This Miss Montague obtained for me through\nthe kindness of the editor of the Daily Graphic, who sent me\nthe following extract from the Daily Mail of Monday, April 19,\n1920. Possibly a fuller report may be found in other con-\ntemporary newspapers which I have not been able to consult.\nI omit the actual names in the report and substitute the\npseudonyms I have used. The report is headed :\n\u2014\nLondon Hotel Drama.\n\" Hullo . . . death ! Come round in five minutes or it will be\ntoo late.\"\nSoon after shouting this message through the telephone on\nSaturday at a private hotel, Palace Gate, Kensington, Mr. Holt,\na married man of 38, was found lying dead in his dressing room,\nshot through the mouth, with a revolver in his right hand.\n\f162 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1923.\nAccording to his native servant, Mr. Holt had made the remark\nquoted above in phoning for a friend, Mr. R. He then left the\ncall to his servant, who, when the friend answered, went to tell\nhis master, whom he found dead.\nMr. Holt had served in the army and seen much service in\nFrance and was present in Dublin during the rebellion. He had\nsuffered from shell-shock.\"\nThe newspaper account difiiers somewhat and is incomplete,\nbut perhaps is not more so than newspaper reports generally.\nOne is jiaturally sceptical of such a tragic story. In this\ncase the premonition appears to have saved Mr. R.'s life, just\nas the premonition in the case of the Munich fire enabled the\nfamily to save some valuable papers which otherwise would\nhave been destroyed in the fire which was so vividly depicted\na month before it occurred.\nWhen I read the foregoing paper at a meeting of the S.P.R.\non April 11, 1922, Miss Montague and Mr. R. kindly came at\nmy request and answered very fully and satisfactorily the\nnumerous questions asked by the members. In addition an\nindependent witness, a stranger to me, related another case of\ncrystal vision which Miss Montague had given him and which\nproved to be correct.\nAlthough the widow of Mr. Holt did not like to recall the\nsad past, in response to my urgent request, she kindly called\non me and had an interview, at which Mr. Dingwall happened\nto be present. The statement she made was taken down by\nMr. Dingwall at the time, August 28, 1922. Mrs. Holt said\nthat her husband had sat with Miss Montague for crystal\nvision some six months before his death.^ Miss Montague then\ntold him what she had then seen, and begged him not to under-\ntake the business he was about to engage in, as she said it would\nend in tragedy.^ Mrs. Holt herself sat with Miss Montague in\n1920, and in a letter to me Mrs. H. says :\n\" When I asked\n^ Miss Montague informs me that when she gave this sitting to Mr. Holt\nshe did not know his name and had no idea he was any relative of the\nlady whom she saw six months later. \u2014W. F. B.\n^ It seems the business Mr. Holt was about to engage in was converting a\nlarge house he had secured in Kensington into an hotel which turned out a\nfailure. This explains why Mr. Holt's house is called an hotel in the news-\npaper report.\u2014W. F. B.\n\fNov., 1923. A Remarkable Premonitory Crystal Vision. 163\nher to read the crystal for me, she told me of things that\nhad happened to me years ago. Then she predicted I should\nbe a widow very shortly.\" In her inter\\dew with Mr. Dingwall\nand myself Mrs. Holt said she believed Miss Montague had told\nher \" that she would be a widow within two days \" ; Mrs.\nHolt added, \" this was the case, though I do not remember now\nwhat else she said.\" Mrs. Holt said she was fetched by Mr. E.\nfrom Gloucester Road Station, London, after the tragedy.\nShe had previously arranged to meet her husband at Gloucester\nEoad Station as they were going to ^^sit their solicitor.\nOn arriving at the station she found Mr. R. there instead. He\ngradually broke the sad news to her, and said her husband\nhad died suddenly. This was about 10.4.5 a.m. on Saturday,\nApril 17, Mrs. Holt said.\nIn the crystal vision Mrs. Holt told Mr. Dingwall and myself\nthat Miss Montague had also stated her first husband had\ndied suddenly, which she remarked was quite true, and that\nshe, Mrs. Holt, would have a very chequered life, which .was\nalso true. In her letter to me Mrs. Holt adds that \" ]\\Iiss\nMontague also said that she saw things would clear up for me\nafter a couple of years, which I trust will be the case as I\nhave had such troubles and difficulties.\"\nIt will be seen that Mrs. Holt only partially confirms the\ndetailed prediction, which Miss Montague says she -wrote down\nafter she had the sitting with Mrs. Holt. But it is possible\nthe awful sequel had blurred Mrs. Holfs recollection. In any\ncase the prediction of the tragedy is fully confirmed.\nThis and other cases are illustrations of the existence of the\ntranscendental self which lies beneath our empirical or normal\nself\u2014of faculties which doubtless will have fuller exercise when\nwe are freed from the present \" muddy vesture of decay.\"\nThe precognitions Ave have described bring before us the great\nproblems of Time and Space, and whether these are merely\nnames for illusions, due to the present limitations of our\npersonahty. J\\Ir. Myers has eloquently discussed this question\nin his great work on Human Personality. May we not. as\nhe suggests, be apprehending as a stream of sequence that\nwhich is really an ocean of co-existence.

Just as the\nhighest of our senses (sight) perceives instantaneously a flash\nof lightning, which a lower sense (hearing) only perceives later\non through the roar of thunder. So it is conceivable, Mr.\nMyers suggests, that some occasional intercommunion of con-\nsciousness may enable our higher self to call to the lower, the\ncentral organism to inform the periphery that \" at such an\nhour this shock will reach you, listen to the nearing roar.\"\nCASES.\nI.\nL. 1247. A Telepathic Dream.\nA REPORT of the following case of a dream apparently of\ntelepathic origin reached us in the first instance through Mr,\nE. P. Larken, a Member of the Society, to whom the dreamer\nis known personally. On August [misdated October] 22, 1923,\nMr. Larken wrote to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nAbout a year ago, Mrs. Wynn Roberts, a Wimereux resident, was\nstaying with her mother in England. One morning Mrs. Wynn\nRoberts had a morning dream in which she thought that some\none had put sugar into her tea, which is a thing she detests.\nShe tasted the sugar and, whUe dreaming, she thought that it\nwas a curious and unusual thing to taste in a dream. Then she\nwoke up as the maid came in with her morning tea. With\nthe maid was her mother, Mrs. P., and Mrs. Wynn Roberts at once\nasked her if she had ever tasted in a dream and told her the story.\nMrs. P. said \" no \" but that she had just been scolding Nellie\n(the maid) for putting sugar into her (Mrs. P.'s) morning tea, which\nshe dislikes as much as Mrs. Wynn Roberts dislikes it.\nMrs. Wynn Roberts at my request wrote to her mother about\nthe matter the other day and the enclosed fragment of a postcard\nbears the reply.

Can you remem-\nber having any conversation with any one on this subject ?\n(3) Have you had any other telepathic experiences either with\nyour mother or with any other people ?\n(4) Can you give the date of your dream ?\nIn reply to this letter Mrs. Wynn Roberts wrote as follows :\nAugust 27th, 1923.\nIn reply to your letter of enquiry about my dream which\nshowed telepathic communication with a contemporary incident.\nI shall be pleased to give you the account as I remember it.\nThe incident took place a little under a year ago, while I\nwas on a visit to my mother. The dream itself having been\nso unusually clear and sensible has remained in my mind as\nan outstanding one ever since.\nAs most of my dreams come just before waking in the early\nmorning, I imagine that this must have occurred between the\nhours of six and seven.\nIt appeared to me that I was drinking tea which had been\nsweetened as I distinctly tasted the sugar in it. I have a par-\nticular dislike for sugar in that beverage and I was most bothered\nwith the unpleasantness of it.\nMy mother came into my room with the maid who was calling\nme about 7-45, and being so impressed with the strangeness of\nthe taste sense having been so clear in my sleep, I asked my\nmother whether she had ever known or heard of anyone having\nhad a similar experience. She remarked at once how curious\nthat this shoidd have happened as about an hour before (she is\nalways called very early) her maid, when preparing her tea, as\nshe had been in the habit of doing for a considerable time, had\nabsent-mindedly sugared it and she had been very much annoyed\nwith the girl for her carelessness. She has the same aversion\nas myself to sweetened tea and will never drink it.\nWe both concluded that the whole thing had been a case of\ntelepathy, which in no way astonished us as we are quite accus-\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mr. Wales gave an account of the circumstances\nin which this incident occurred in a letter to Mrs. Sidgwick,\ndated February 25, 1923, thus :\u2014\nIn your very interesting paper in Proceedings (Vol. XXXIII.),\non coincidental hallucinations and dreams, you refer (on p. 331)\nto \" the extended idea of the operation of telepathy which is, I\n\fNov., 1923.

For this\npurpose in the autumn of 1921, a friend of mine, Mrs. Donohoe,\nof Hampstead, extremely kindly undertook a series of sittings on\nmy behalf with a professional medium, Mrs. Brittain, or rather\npartly on my behalf and partly on her own. I did not meet\nMrs. Brittain or hold any communication with her, and did not\nindeed know in what part of London was her house, when the\nsittings were held. But at, or before, the first sitting Mrs.\nDonohoe read to her part of a letter to herself (Mrs. D.) from me,\nin which I said I was anxious to obtain communications, if\npossible, from any deceased friends of mine. Mrs. Donohoe took\nwith her to every sitting a friend who wrote shorthand, who took\na verbatim note of what was said, of which a typed copy was\nsent to me as soon as possible.\nAbout twelve sittings were held, but no evidence for survival\nworth reporting was obtained. Several incidents, however, occurred\nsuggestive of the extended, or linked, telepathy you mention.

A spiritualistic circle of six persons\nat Flushing (Holland) held a seance on the evening of the\n23rd July, 1922. They did not usually get anything remarkable\nat their seances, and on this occasion they first tried table-\ntilting without success. They then tried the \" cross,\" i.e. a\ncross-shaped piece of wood ' with a needle at the point of inter-\nsection, held over the alphabet. The four arms of the cross\nwere held by two ladies (S. and M.) and two gentlemen\n(S. and H.) ; it was about 9 p.m. ; this time has been\nverified by Dr. Suringar. What they got seemed to be non-\nsense, but after some time one of the gentlemen recognised\nEnglish words. The following dialogue then took place, the\nquestions, which were put in Dutch, being placed in round\nbrackets, and comments and explanations in square brackets.\n* These amounts were included in the total of \u00a3.355 mentioned in the\nNovember Journal (p. 152).\n\fDec, 1923.

None of the other four\nmembers knew any English, and the verse in question was\nentirely unknown to the whole circle. With the aid of an\nEnglish dictionary, one of the gentlemen reconstructed a four-\nUne poem out of it, neglecting altogether the rhymes.\nThe matter would have been allowed to rest there, had it\nnot been for what happened on the following day. Opposite\nto the house where the seance took place (a grocer's shop\nbelonging to Mr. and Mrs. M.) is the house of a tailor, whose\nson, aged fifteen, visits the M. family. He knew that there\nwere mysterious meetings now and then, but did not know\nv\/hat happened at them ; he longed to attend one of the\nmeetings, but was not allowed to. This boy, next day, came\nto the shop and asked Mr. M. if there had been a seance last\nevening, and the reply being in the affirmative, he asked if\nthey had had anything remarkable. Mr. M. answered : yes,\nan Englishman who said he woidd sing a song, but spelt it\nout with the cross. \" What song was it ?\n\" asked the boy.\n\"Evening song of a little bird,\" was the reply. \"Well,\" said\n\fDec, 1923. A Case of Thouglit-Transference. 173\nthe boy, \" last evening I read such a song myself out of\na text-book used at a former school.\" He went home, typed\nthe song out from memory on a piece of paper and brought\nit to Mr. M.\nThe poem, as typed by him, was as follows :\nEvening Song.\nThe sun has set,\nAnd now a new\nWith fallen dew\nThe grass is wet.\nAnd little burd\nis sing to rest\nWithin his nest.\nNo song is heard.\nWhen Mr. S., one of the sitters, was shown the poem as\ntyped by the boy, he corrected '\nhurd '\ninto '\nbird '\nand '\nsing\n'\ninto '\nsutiks '\n; on other occasions also he wrote '\nsunks\n'\n(for '\nsunk ').\nDr. Suringar, to whose notice the case had been brought,\nentered into correspondence with the members of the circle\nand the boy, in order to verify the facts. He obtained the\noriginal record of the sitting, and the typed poem given by the\nboy to Mr. M., and elicited the following additional details.\nThe boy standing in his room before the A\u00a5indow (on the\nfirst floor) looked at the persons who entered Mr. M.'s house\n;\nhe felt vexed not to be able to attend the seance (which was\nheld on the ground floor). He was bored, went over to his\ncupboard, rummaged amongst all sorts of things, and found\nthe remnants of an old school book, Huynink, Engelsche\nSfraahleer, of which there only remained a few pages. These\npages contained the five four-lined stanzas of an English\npoem which he had formerly learnt at school.\nThe boy took the pages to the table, sat down and read\nthe poem on p. 44 of the book. He was all the time in a\ndoze. He began to look at the book about 9 o'clock, and\nremained sitting until he heard the clock of the town hall\nstrike half past nine ;\nshortly after that he rose and went\ndownstairs, and threw the remains of the book in the dust-bin.\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. Dec, 1923\nDr. Suringar learnt that the boy had also been in the habit\nof dozing in school, and was informed by his schoolmaster\nthat his diligence left much to be desired.\nDr. Suringar obtained a copy of the Engelsche SjJraakleer and\nfound that the poem consisted of five four-lined stanzas^\nprinted on a separate page. The first two stanzas (repro-\nduced at the seance) were printed thus :\nEvening Song.\nThe sun has set,\nAnd now anew\nWith fallen dew\nThe grass is wet.\nEach little bird\nHas sunk to rest\nWithin its nest.\nNo song is heard.\nIt will be observed that the points in which the version\nwritten at the sitting, the version typed by the boy from\nmemory, and this same version as corrected by Mr. S., vary\nfrom the original are different. This, as Dr. Suringar points\nout, corroborates to some extent the opinion he had formed\non other grounds, that all the members of the circle and the\nboy had acted bona fide and without any kind of collusion.\nDr. Suringar's comment on the episode is as follows :\n\u2014\nIn the whole literature on this subject I have not found a case\nof thought-transference with as long a piece of thought material\nas here transferred with an equal degree of correctness. It is a\nspontaneous case with the thoughts transferred fully, and it took\nplace between two separate houses, neither the agent nor the\npercipient giving themselves conscious trouble to perform any\nthought-transference.\nThe conversation at the beginning makes it still more remark-\nable, because the medium did not know any English.\nHow must we interpret this case 1 Ordinary transference of\nthought through the air seems to me to be excluded because of\nthe strength of the case, and because of the English conversation\nwhich was not in the boy's conscious thoughts. Equally impos-\nsible is it, I think, to suppose that the medium read from her own\n\fDec, 1923. A Case of Thought-Transference. 175\nhouse the poem in the boy's room, because Mrs. M. has never been\nshown to possess that gift ; and in that case the quantity of what\nwas read would not exactly have corresponded with what the boy\nknew by heart. So the only interpretation left seems to be the\nwithdrawal of the psychic substrate (subconsciousness) from the\nbody. The boy has some clairvoyant power ; he was that even-\ning in a mood fit for such a withdrawal, he knew Mrs. M., and\nthereby had some psychic contact with her ; and he longed to\nbe in the seance room.\nWith this interpretation the English conversation, held by the\nspirit of the boy before the poem came through, the medium not\nknowing any English, is also explicable ;\nso, too, the manner\nin which the boy ruled the situation ;\ne.g. when the poem was\non the point of coming through, questions were put which were\nanswered by the spirit of the boy ; meanwhile the spirit waited\nwith the poem and brought it forth as soon as there came a\nfavourable moment for it. After the first stanza he added '\nfirst\npart ' (this was not understood by the sitters), and when the\ntwo couplets had been given, the spirit of the boy felt dis-\ncharged, he knew only two stanzas by heart\u2014and retired ; the\nboy awakened from his dozing, rose, and went downstairs.\nWe take it that what Dr. Suringar would suggest by this inter-\npretation is that the boy, being at the time in a state of\npartial dissociation, played the part of a \" communicator \" at\nthe seance over the way. Some of our readers will call to\nmind that one or two striking instances of veridical communi-\ncation from living persons have occurred at sittings with Mrs.\nLeonard, although\u2014so far as we are aware\u2014there has never\nbeen anything in her phenomena quite on the lines of the\npresent case.\nThis case has been independently investigated, and reported\non, though in less detail, by Dr. VoUgrafi {Mededeelingen der\nStudiever voor Psychical Research, 1923, No. 5).\nAs mentioned in the October Journal, the case is reported\nand discussed at length by Dr. Suringar in De Tempel, with\nreproductions of the original record, the typed stanzas (with\ncorrections by Mr. S.), the street, houses, etc.,^ and a brief\naccount of it appeared in the issue of Light of the 27th October.\n^ This detailed report is in the Society's possession and can be seen by\n. anyone who wishes to examine it.\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The incident\nis slight but we put it on record here, as all evidence bearing\nupon the question of the conditions under which telepathy\noccujs may be of interest to the future student.\nA first report of the incident was contained in a letter to\nthe Secretary, Miss Newton, dated April 10, 1923, from Miss\nNutter, an Associate of the Society, who appears to have been\none of the agents. Miss Newton then wrote for further par-\nticulars and in reply Miss Nutter sent the following report :\n\u2014\nMiss Evans and I were sitting at the table, Monday evening\nApril 9, playing at \" Scramble Patience.\"\nMiss Skeat was dozing at the fire, slightly turned towards it, in\nan armchair.\nI put down 3 of clubs, and hurried to put down 4 of clubs on\nit, but in the meantime Miss Evans had placed her own 4 of\nclubs.

Warcollier^s Experiments. 177\nCONCERNING MONSIEUR WARCOLLIER^S SUGGESTED\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nWith regard to the \" telepathic gamble \" suggested in a\nreview of Monsieur Warcollier's La TeUpathie {Jour. S.P.Ii.,\nJuly 1923, pp. 125-26) one of our Associates, Dr. F. J. M.\nStratton, who is a mathematician, has called attention to the\nfollowing difficulty :\n\u2014\nIt will be remembered that according to Monsieur Warcol-\nlier's game the percipient has before him a complete pack of\nfifty-two cards, from which he has to select thirteen cards to\nbe paired with the thirteen cards of the agent. Dr. Stratton\npoints out that by deUberately restricting his choice to any\nfour numbers the percipient can weight the scales in his\nfavour. This is a serious objection to the game, because\nit means that players could not assume, as Monsieur Warcol-\nlier suggests, that, whatever the percipient's choice of cards,\nany advantage gained by him over the agent would be evi-\ndence of thought-transference ; mathematical calculation would\nbe required to ascertain in any given instance just what\nadvantage chance would give the percipient. Nor can the\ndifficulty be solved by limiting the percipient's field to four\nnimibers and deducting from his total of success the pro-\nportion due under these conditions to chance. For this\narrangement involves \" a limitation of choice which vitiates\nany result or explanation in terms of telepathy. ... A funda-\nmental difficulty in the game is that once you have guessed\nany card four times you can't guess it again, even though it\nremains as a card to be drawn.\"\nIt would therefore appear that what seemed at first sight\nan attractive method of varying the monotony of telepathic\nexperiments will not serve, and we must look elsewhere for a\nsolution of this problem.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning Dk. Alkutz's Hypnotic Experiments.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014Volume XXXII., pp. 151-178, of the Proceedings\ncontains a paper by Dr. Sydney Alrutz, entitled Problems of\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1923.\nHypnotism, describing certain experiments which he thinks establish\nthe existence of a nervous '\neffluence '\nfrom the human body\nwhich is cajDable of inducing or modifying hypnosis.\nTo establish the existence of such a factor it is of course\nnecessary to eliminate telepathic suggestion. Dr. Alrutz believes\nhe has done so, but upon this crucial point his report is hardly\nas complete as its importance requires. The following criticisms\nof his test experiments suggest themselves :\n\u2014\nSitting 20 (p. 156). In this experiment passes were made above\nobjects which were regarded as opaque to the effluence, the\nposition of which was unknown to Dr. Alrutz. Their position\nwas however known to Dr. von Bahr who seems to have been\npresent all the time.\nSitting 2,1 (p. 157). Prof. Svedberg chose the objects and the\ndirection of the passes himself. Dr. Alrutz being out of the room.\nWe are told \" He [Prof. S.] had not expected any certain result\nhimself.\" This is hardly sufficient information as to his knowledge\nof, and mental attitude toward, the theory. Further, Prof.\nSvedberg appears to have reported what he had done to Dr.\nAlrutz before the skin was examined. Who made the examination\nis not clear.\nSitting 38. The result (no difference between the right and left\nsides) was in accordance with the theory. It was also what\nwould happen if there were no effluence\u2014and no particular\nsuggestion.\nSitting 44 (p. 158). Here Dr. Alrutz had no normal knowledge\nof what had been done by Mr. Rosen; but may not the latter\nhave telepathically informed the subject of what he was doing?\nIf such a leakage took place and the subject knew what was\nrequired of him the regular result would naturally follow.\nSitting 48 (1) (p. 158). That Mrs. A\u2014z, who was present while\nMrs. E. L. conducted the experiment, was familiar with the\ntheory, is implied by the statement that she had absent-mindedly\nexpected another result. Two possibilities arise. The subject\nmay have learned telepathically what was being done, and Mrs.\nA\u2014z may have subconsciously conveyed the ordinary suggestion\nas to the result.\nSitting 48 (2) (p. 158). Mrs. E. L. now experimented alone\n;\nbut may she not by then have gathered what the theory was ?\nSitting 105 (9) (p. 159). Here an attempt was made to use an\n\fDec, 1923. Correspondence\n.\n179\n'\nopaque '\nobject the position of which was unknown, but no\naccount is given of the precautions taken to ensure that it was\nunknown. Further, as there were only two possible positions\nchance must be remembered here. On p. 164 an experiment\nis mentioned in which the position of the '\nopaque '\nbody is\nsaid to have been unknown to both the experimenters. The\nresult was irregular. Alternative explanations are however given.\nThe only statistics of successes and failures (p. 165) are not\nclear. They appear to refer to only 10 '\nnon-informed '\nexperi-\nments. The total number of the experiments which yielded 78%\nof successes (p. 166) is not stated, and in view of the experiments\nwhich are described the statement that telepathy was ruled out\ndoes not inspire confidence. In 11 cases contra suggestions seem\nto have been attemjDted. This raises the question\u2014What happens\nwhen one suggestion is given consciously and another from the\nsubconscious ?\nTwo other arguments are brought forward. On p. 167 it is\njDointed out that certain regular physiological reflexes can be pro-\nduced in subjects who are ignorant of j^hysiology ; and on p. 173\ncertain reactions are stated to have been produced only by stimuli\napplied by the hypnotist or someone in physical contact with\nhim. In the first case the knowledge of the operator might well\nmake up for the ignorance ,of the subject, and in the second\nDr. Alrutz does not seem to have ascertained what would happen\nwhen neither experimenter knew whether physical contact did or\ndid not exist between them.\nTo devise experiments in which the direction of the passes,\nand the position and shaj^e of the \" opaque \" bodies would, at\nthe time, be unknown to any of the experimenters should not\nbe difficult. Until the effluence theory is sujjported by a detailed\nreport of such experiments it cannot be regarded as established.\nW. B. Leslie.\nDr. Aleutz's Reply.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nDear Madam,\u2014In reply to Mr. Leslie's criticism of my paper\nProblems of Hyjmotism, I wish, first of all, to point out that\nthe main thing was to find out if the phenomena existed, even\nwhen every conceivable way of producing them by auto-suggestion\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1923.\non the subject's part had been eliminated. If they nevertheless\noccurred and occurred regularly, the next problem was : did they\ndepend on the thoughts or, to put it on a broader footing, on the\nknowledge of the hypnotizer or the experimenter (the maker of\nthe passes), who generally, however, were the same person 1\nFinally, if this was not the case, were they brought about by the\nmental activity of some assistant or any third person ? These\nlast two possibilities may be termed telepathic. I cannot use the\nexpression which Mr. Leslie employs, telepathic suggeetion, because\nthe telepathic stimulus, if such a cause there be, may very well\nbe conceived as stimulating the primary sensory or motor centres\nof the brain, in which case there might ensue either a sensation\nof warmth, etc., or only an alteration in the physiological ex-\ncitability of these brain centres. But in neither case need definite\nideas of any sort arise in the mind of the subject. If, however,\nno such ideas are evoked by this telepathic means\u2014as may be\nthe case\u2014can we then talk about telepathic suggestion in a strict\nsense of this word ? I think not.\nI shall now as shortly as possible reply to Mr. Leslie's detailed\ncriticism, adding a few more experiments, and making here and\nthere some general remarks.\nSitting 20. Certainly these experiments only prove that the\nhypnotizer-exiKrimenter needs have no knowledge of the nature and\nposition of the screens used. But that is already a good deal.\nSitting 37. Mr. Leslie considers the information that Prof.\nSvedberg himself had not expected any certain result concerning\nExp. 371\u00b0 too scanty. I may then add that at the beginning of\nthis sitting Prof. Svedberg had no knowledge of the effects which\nmy experiments brought about. The minutes of the first experi-\nment follow :\nSeance 2,1. 22\/10\/191L At my house. Present : Prof.\nSvedberg.\nL After C. W. had first been put to sleep for half-an-hour\nhis sensibility was examined ; this was normal (for light\nhypnosis) and right = left. A cloth was put over face.\n2 and 3. Prof. S. was asked by me (in another room) to\nmake passes (the procedure of which I also showed to him)\nabove the brass screen either on the right or on the left and\neither upwards or downwards. Then S. came out to me and\ntold me he had done as he had been told. I then asked him\n\fDec, 1923. Coirespondence. 181\nto test the sensibility witli my algesimeter (2 gm.), first ten\ntimes on the side that had been operated on and then ten\ntimes on the other side and to observe the results. He was\nto do the same thing with the temperators (means for apply-\ning a stimulus of cold).\n4. S. did this and then told me that the arm and hand\nthat had been operated on, i.e. which had been exposed to\ndescending passes, had become insensible, while the other side\nwas clearly hyper-sensitive. This was then verified by me as\nwell. S. also found the same result when examining with\ncotton-wool (ticHing).\nThe result was thus regular. In Exp. 10 of this sitting, which\nis the experiment criticized by llr. Leslie, Mr. Svedberg may well\nhave begun to put two and two together. StLU, when a person\nof J\\lr. Svedberg's scientific standing states that he expected no\ndefinite result when making an experiment in a way chosen freely\nby himseH, there seems no very good reason to disbelieve him.\nProf. Svedberg did certainly 7iot report to me what he had done\nbefore he made the examination of the skin. Finally, it is quite\nclear by whom the examination was made. By Mr. Svedberg\nfirst, and then by myself. The translator has unfortunately turned\nthe words of the minutes, \" as \/ foimd afterwards,\" into the\nneutral form, \"as it proved later on.\"\nSitting 38. This negative experiment has certainly more im-\nportance than J\\Ir. Leslie thinks. It shows that the subject does\nnot suggest to himself some alteration, simply because passes are\nmade\u2014whether he feels or knows that such movements are being\nmade or not. Further, this being the first experiment she made.\nSister L. would naturally expect something to occur. But in fact\nnothing did occur, which was the correct result.\nSitting 44. Mr. Leslie supposes here that Mr. Rosen may have\ntelepathicaUy informed the subject of what he was doing, and\nconsequently that the subject then suggested to himself two\ndifferent alterations in his sensibility in the \" right \" places '. I\nonly wish to say here that there exists no evidence that anybody\nbut the hypnotizer can in any way influence this subject tele-\npathicaUy. On the other hand, the subject has spontaneously\ninformed me that he feels my thoughts sometimes.\nSitting 48^. The same reasoning as above can be applied to\nthis experiment as well as to Sitting 48-. Mr. Leslie asks here\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Refiearch.. Dec, 1923.\nif Mrs. L. may not have gathered by then what the theory was.\nI doubt it, seeing that the only preceding experiment (48^) was a\nnegative one.\nSitting 105^. Here the zinc-box with a lid on and half of its\nbottom-surface filled with an opaque substance (paraffin) was used.\nThe precautions taken were that Dr. Klapper twisted the box\nround, so as not to know himself where the paraffin was situated.\nI did not take any \" precautions \" against him, Dr. Klapper being\na German neurologist who visited me in order to obtain a personal\nopinion of the nature of my experiments, and whom I had no\nreason not to trust when lie told me that he did not know the\nposition of the paraffin. Mr. Leslie writes that chance must be\nremembered here, as there were only two possible positions. If\nMr. Leslie means by this that there was a .50 per cent, chance\nfor and against right results, I cannot agree with him. Mr. Leslie\nseems to think that I said to my subject something of this kind :\n\" Now, look here, I am going to make an experiment with that\nzinc-box, filled half-way, and I shall let the boundary line run\nhere ; then you are to tell me which half-part of the skin-surface,\nlying beneath the box, gets sensitive.\" In point of fact, the\nsubject did not know either that we were going to make an\nexperiment on his sensibility at all (the foregoing experiments\nhaving been made on motility), neither, consequently, that we\nwere going to use a zinc-box, nor that it would be a combined\nexperiment with a boundary line somewhere. I doubt even\nwhether the subject knew of the existence of this box, as we\nalways, as much as possible, kept him in ignorance of our arrange-\nments. Of course, when I began the examination of the skin\nwhich was insensible he might understand, if he heard my move-\nments, that I expected some kind of alteration somewhere, but that\nwould be all. Consequently, the probability of success by chance-\nguessing cannot be estimated. Other experiments with this box\nhave, of course, also been made, with \" right \" results. But\nsometimes no differentiated effect could be obtained\u2014the subject\nbeing so suscej)tible that an alteration (irradiation) in the ivhole of\none half of the body took place on account of the passes\nmade. In such cases the waking condition is to be preferred.\nThis makes me point out how incredible it is that telepathy is\nthe right explanation, seeing that regular results can be obtained\non persons in the waking condition who never have been hypnotized\nby me.\n\fDec, 1923. Correspondence. 183\nAs to statistics, I wrote in my article that space did not permit\nme to give more than extracts. On p. 165 I gave statistics for\na certain class of phenomena, i.e. descending passes in light\nhypnosis, and I wrote \"... ten were ^ made with the non-in-\nformed\" method.\" Why does Mr. Leslie then write \" they {i.e. the\nstatistics) appear ^ to refer . . .\n\" ? The statistics on p. 166 refer,\non the other hand, to non-informed experiments belonging to all\nclasses of phenomena, and the 78 per cent, of regular results is\nbased on the results of thirty-seven experiments. Further, I wrote\nin my article (p. 166) that these experiments were made under\nconditions unknown to tlie experimenter ^\n\u2014I said nothing about\npossible assistants. I also wrote \" there even telepathy must be\nconsidered ruled out of the question.\" I judged it to be well\nproved that telepathy was not the vera causa of the phenomena,\nas they took place, and were quite as regular, not only when the\nhypnotizer-experimenter was ignorant of the nature of the experi-\nment, others present knowing it however, but also when the\nexperimenter had no idea of the expected results, and no one else\nwas present, and, finally also, in some cases, when nobody knew\nhow the screens were arranged. I did not, however, write that\ntelepathy was ruled out\u2014as Mr. Leslie says I did\u2014but only that\nit must be thought to be ruled out. I therefore cannot believe\nthat I have made any statement which \" does not inspire con-\nfidence,\" as Mr. Leslie expresses it. JSTaturally, however, as many\nexperiments of the zinc-box type as possible should be made.\nWhy does Mr. Leslie write that in eleven cases contra sug-\ngestions seem ^ to have been attempted when I expressly stated\nthat eleven such experiments were ^ carried out ? The validity of\nthe experiments alone can be disputed, not their existence or their\nformal nature. They were made in such a manner that the\nexperimenter wished or had the intention that a result should\nensue of an opposite kin^ to the one which the passes he then\nmade usually give. And in all the eleven experiments the passes\ngave, nevertheless, their usual eii'ect. I have also made experi-\nments in which the subject has tried to prevent the usual effect\nof the passes from taking place, but the only result was that the\nusual effect was somewhat retarded. Mr. Leslie asks \" What\nhappens when one suggestion is given consciously and another\nfrom the subconscious 1\n\" Well, I should very much like to\n^ Italics by me now.\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1923.\nknow. I have really tried to answer the question experimentally\nmyself, but I am not yet quite prepared to give any opinion on\nit. I have also tried to suggest to one of my subjects to see a\ngiven spectrum brighter, to see farther out in the red, to see\nbrown there, but this had no effect. All these alterations of the\nspectrum and others also were however obtained if I made upward\npasses above the arm of the same side as the eye with which the\nsvibject regarded the spectrum, or downward passes on the opposite\nside (see my paper, pp. 163-4).\nAs to motor phenomena, I have certainly obtained responses,\nand the right ones too, even when the experimenter has been a\nperson who did not believe in my experiments. If, however, this\nhas also been done when I was absent, or by persons ignorant of\nwhat might happen, I cannot state without a good deal of search-\ning in my records. In regard to the ,\nexperiment mentioned on\np. 173 of my paper, Mr. Leslie's proposal might and ought to be\naccepted. StUl the tremendous complications, which a telepathic\nexplanation would involve here, make the possibility of such an\nexplanation being the right one extremely small.\nThe main thing now seems to be to try and make competent\njDersons repeat and test the validity of my results and theories.\nTo debase means which w^ould realize this wish seems to me quite\nas important as to devise new forms of experiments. Neverthe-\nless, I readily agree that any good variation of methods, however\nsatisfactory in themselves, ought to be tried. Variation gives\nadded safety and may bring about increased knowledge of the\nphenomena. Sydney Aleutz.\nREVIEW.\nMy Coninionplace Boole. By J. T. Hackett. Fourth Edition,\nRevised and Enlarged. Macmillans. 12s. 6d. net.\nWe are not surprised to learn that Mr. Hackett's book, which\nhas already been noticed in the Jovrnal, has now reached a fourth\nedition. Mr. Hackett was an intimate friend of Richard Hodgson,\nto whose memory the book is dedicated. Of the notable passages\nof literature contained in it about one-third were collected by\nHodgson himself. They cover a very wide field, and, as is natural\nin any work in which Hodgson played .so large part, the lighter\nside of life is by no means neglected.\nThe author has appended to several of his quotations his own\nilluminating comments. Of particular interest to our readers will\nbe the long note (pp. 170-184) on the unconscious, or as he prefers\nto term it the \" superconscious \" self.\nMr. Hackett in many passages pays a warm tribute to the work\nof the S.P.R., of which he has long been a member, but he is\nnot afraid to break a lance on occasion with William James,\nProf. M'Dougall and Prof. Gilbert Murray. It is a most stimu-\nlating book, and we confidently expect that the present edition\nwill prove as great a success as its predecessors. W. H.

Bromberg, of Mobile, Alabama, the following\nreport of what appears to be a telepathic impression received\nwithin a short time of the death of the person to whom the\np)ercipient\"s impression related. The first account of the case\nreached us in a letter from Mr. Bromberg addressed to the\nHon. Editor, Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nJune 21, 1923.\nThe enclosed is the original letter by Mrs. Daisy M. Wilkie\n\u2022of this City narrating one of those not infrequent cases of appar-\n-ent telepathic influence exercised by a dying person during hours\nof physical dissolution upon distant intimate friends.\nThe interval between Winston-Salem, X.C., and Mobile, Alabama,\n<?overs several hundred miles.\nI know the writer personally very -uell, and can assure you that\nher statements and that of her son can be accepted with perfect\nconfidence in the integrity of the writers.\nThe occurrence transpired in the same building within which I\nreside, and was communicated to me the next day by Mrs.\nWilkie. I asked her to commit to writing her statement of facts,\nAvith which request she complied after a few days of delay.\nI told her that I intended to send her communication to you\nfor publication in the Journal of our Society.\nFeEDERICK G. BEOitBERG.\na2\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJi. Jan., 1924.\nWith Mr. Bromberg\"s letter was enclosed the following\nstatement from Mrs. Wilkie and a corroborative statement hj\nher son : .\nJune 14, 1923.\nOn the eve of the 3rd of May (I\"m not quite certain of the\ndate as the paper I had with the notice is mislaid), my son and\nI were speaking of my girlhood days, without any reason for sO'\ndoing. I began to tell him of a certain Mr. Rich'd. Plenge, of\nCharleston, S.C., who was a fine Baritone Singer, and quite an\nadmirer of mine. I had not thought of this gentleman for some\ntime. Try as I may that eve., I could not keep him out of the\nconversation no matter what other subject was introduced, I found\nmyself going back to him and his lovely singing. I said to my\nson several times \" I can imagine I hear him now singing '\nLove's\nSorrow ' \" (his favorite Ballad in those days). We spoke of him\nincessantly from 8 till after 11 p.m.\nTwo days later I rec\"d a Charleston paper with the marked\nparagraph, containing the announcement of his death in Winston-\nSalem, N.C., at 2 a.m., 3 hours after our eve. spent in talking\nof him.\nHe died after an illness of 4 or 5 wks., but was dying, his.\nbrother. Dr. Henry Plenge, informed me thro, my mother, from\n8 f.m.. of the same eve. I could not keep him from my mind.\nMy son remarked when I showed him the paper\n\u2014\" Well it\ncertainly makes me feel peculiar, almost as if he was somewhere\nnear us all the time.\"\nThese facts are true and positively happened.\n(Mrs.) D. M. Wilkie.\nThis statement is true and I am \" son \" mentioned.\nC4. B. Wilkie.\nIn reply to these communications Mrs. Salter wrote to ask\nwhether it was possible to obtain a copy of the Charleston\npaper giving the date of Mr. Plenge's death. ' This Mr. Bromberg\nendeavoured to do, but subsequently he wrote again to Mrs.\nBaiter, as follows :\nIS^ovcmher 2, 1923.\n''Daisy M. Wilhe.\"\nReferring to my letter of the 16th of August, written by me\nin reply to your letter of the 30th of July, I have this report to-\n\fJan., 1924 Case. 189\nmake, having just this day been supplied with the data by Mrs.\nDaisy M. Wilkie. I have seen the original letter written by Mrs.\nBlanche Clacius Harris to my informant, her cousin, Mrs. Daisy\nM. Wilkie. I had the original in my hands and am satisfied that\nit is the original, and in part confirmation of that fact I am\nsending you the original envelope in which the letter came to\nMrs. Wilkie, and copy that portion of the letter of Mrs. Harris\nsvhich refers to the death of Richard Plenge. The remainder of\nthe letter related entirely to private fairdly matters.\nThat the News and Courier newspaper does not have a spate\ncopy of this paper for the month of May is simply consistent\nwith the practice in this country. I have had occasion to ask\nfor copies of the Mobile Register, which is a paper over one hun-\ndred years old, in this City, for some date, only a few months\nback, and have been informed that they have none except that\nwhich belongs to the permanent file of the newspaper.\nI hope this letter may be considered satisfactory. To me it\nis the best secondary proof obtainable, short of getting somebody\nto go to the office of the News and Courier and copying from their\nbound file under oath. I do not believe the case would warrant\nthe expense of that when the secondary evidence ought to be\nconsidered satisfactory in a case which depends more upon moral\ncharacter than any financial element.\nFrederick G. Bromberc;.\nWith Mr. Bromberg's letter was enclosed the following letter\nfrom Mrs. Harris addressed to Mrs. W^ilkie :\nCharleston, S.C,\nOct. 30, \u20142.3.\nDear Daisy :\nYour card reed, a few days ago, and I phoned to Dr.\nPlenge's house, and was told that his brother died May 1st so sup-\npose the notice was in the paper May 2nd. Have just come\nfrom the News and Courier, and they looked, but found they had\nno paper of May at all so tlie only way that you could get one\nthat I know of is if the family would give one that they might\nhave, and don't suppose they would care to do that. . . .\nYour fond cousin. Blanche.\nIt would appear to be sufficiently established by Mrs.\nHarris's letter that Mr. Plenge's death occurred on May 1, 1923.\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1924.\nIf, therefore, Mrs. Wilkie is correct in referring her impression\nto May 3, this impression did not coincide mth the death, but\noccurred two days later. It is, however, to be observed that\nMrs. Wilkie is admittedly uncertain as to the exact date of her\nimpression, and since no contemporary note was made, the\ndate cannot now be fixed. In these circumstances the case\ncannot be reckoned as a \" death-coincidence,\" but it seems to\nbe clearly shown on the evidence of Mrs. Wilkie herself, her\nson, Mr. G. B. Wilkie, and Mr. Bromberg, that the experience\noccurred before Mrs. Wilkie had any normal knowledge of Mr.\nPlenge's illness and death.\nSubsequently, after receiving the proof of this report, Mr.\nBromberg wrote to Mrs. Salter as follows :\nNovember 27, 1923.\nSince writing to you yesterday Mrs. Wilkie is in my office and\nstates that the feelings that she had and the statements she made\nto her son positively took place before she received the newspaper\ncontaining the obituary of Mr. Plenge. She also distinctly remem-\nbers that as soon as she received the paper, and observed the\ndate of the death, she remarked to her son and also came down\nand told the writer that the obituary showed this death occurred\nthe same evening that she had thought of him and of hearing\nhis voice. . . . Frederick CI. Bromberg.\nCONCERNING THE \" PRICE-HOPE \" CASE.\nIn April of this year one of our Members, the Rev. C. Drayton\nThomas, sent us a detailed criticism of the report of Mr.\nH. Price's experiment with the Crewe Circle as printed in the\nJournal for May 1922 (p. 171), and further discussed by the\nHon. Officers of the Society in the Journal for January 1923\n(p. 4). In this criticism Mr. Thomas gave reasons why in\nhis opinion the evidence put forward in Mr. Price's report\nshould not be regarded as affording proof that any member\nof the Crewe Circle had been guilty of fraud on the occasion\nin question.\nMr. Thomas's statement was examined by the Research\nCommittee of the Society, who discussed it with him at some\nlength, and eventually invited him to make an abstract of\n\fJan., 1924. Concerning the \" Price-Hope \" Case. 191\nhis arguments to be printed in the Journal, the original\nstatement being too long for this purpose.\nThis abstract, as sent to u.s by Mr. Thomas, we now print,\ntogether with a reply on behalf of the Eesearch Committee,\nwritten at the request of the Council.\nStatement by the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas.\nThe following is an abstract of the report upon this case\nprepared by a Member of the Society for consideration by\nthe Research Committee.\nThe report itself being considered too lengthy for inclusion\nin the Journal, the Committee suggested that an abstract\nshould be placed before our readers.\n1. The main questions are :\n(o) Whether the packet which Price handed to Hope con-\ntained the plates marked by the Imperial Plate Company.\n(5) Whether the plates exposed in the camera by Hope\ncame out of the .said packet.\n2. As to (a) : In the first place the neglect to take proper\nprecautions for the continuous security of the packet from\nthe time it left the control of the Imperial Plate Co. till\nthe time of the seance ; and secondly, the omission, when\nthe coverings were opened, to notice whether the seals were\neffective and intact, weaken the evidence as to the identity\nof the plates so much that the point is not proved in the\njudicial sense.\n3. As to (6) : Mr. Price alleges that the slide containing\nplates taken from the said packet was changed by Mr. Hope\nfor another slide containing other plates. He says that he\nmarked the slide into which the plates were put, that he\nnoticed a suspicious movement on Hope's part which suggested\nthe substitution of another slide, that this suspicion was con-\nfirmed when he failed to find on the slide which Hope gave\nto him the second time the niarlvs made on the original slide,\nand that suspicion was converted to certainty when the\ndevelopment showed that the plates were not those which had\nbeen in the packet. This appears to be the meaning of\nhis various statements. He has not said in his published\nevidence that he observed the results of his attempt to mark\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1924.\nthe slide ; and the presumption, that the performance then\nwas equal to the demonstration before the S.P.R. Annual\nMeeting in January 1923 is weakened by the consideration\nthat, to elude Hope's observation and hearing, he must have\nacted more covertly and silently than at the meeting. He\ncertainly did not take the precaution of inventing some excuse\nto show the marks to Seymour and thus obtain corroborative\ntestimony. It is possible, therefore, that, when he received\nback from Hope what purported to be the same slide, he\nfound no marks on it because his apparatus had failed to\nwork properly.\n4. A subsidiary question touching the respective theories\nof both sides concerning (a) and (6) relates to the source\nof the two anonymous parcels sent to the S.P.R. The same\nperson apparently sent both (see letter accompanying the\nsecond parcel). The sender's object was to prejudice Hope's\ncase. To have obtained possession of the plate forming one\nof the Imperial Co.'s original set, which plate was in parcel\nNo. 1, the sender must have been either somebody attached\nto the British College for Psychic Science who bore ill will to\nHope, as the letter and papers enclosed in the parcels imply,\nor somebody connected with the experiment. There is no\nevidence that Hope had an enemy at the College, and nothing\nto show that such an enemy, had there been one, could have\nfound out at so early a stage of the proceedings that the\nS.P.R. was concerned in this experiment. If the sender was\nan enemy, he was extraordinarily fortunate in selecting this\nparticular undeveloped plate when rummaging through Hope's\nstock. If he were one of the experimenters, he must have\nhad access to the packet and obtained the plate before the\nseance, taking advantage of the laxity of the custody.\n5. There were two glass positives in the second parcel\nrepresenting a Chinese Magician, which are at least as likely\nto have been in the possession of somebody connected with\nthe Magic Circle as to have been found among Hope's stock.\nThere is no evidence to connect them with any \" extra\n\"\never obtained by Hope.\n6. The red celluloid disc contained in parcel No. 2 was\napparently intended to suggest a device for imitating the\n\fJan., 1924. Concerning the \"Price-Hope'' Case. 193\nstencil dots used for the X-ray outline of the Imperial Plate\n\u20aco.'s trademark, the figure of a crowned lion. Whether it\nwas made by Hope, or by someone else who A\\dshed to convey\n\"the impression that Hope had so made it, is the point at\nissue. The correspondence between the pattern of these dots\non the red disc and two sections of the crowned lion is too\nclose to be due to coincidence.\nOne of these sections is the hind leg, as on the plate\nenclosed in anonymous parcel No. 1, which belonged to the\noriginal set prepared for Mr. Price. Nobody could have known\nwhat was on this plate who had not seen it after its develoj)-\nment, and because it was not developed until it reached the\n.S.P.R. only a person in touch v\\rith the S.P.R. could have\nobtained the knowledge ; and Hope is thus absolved from the\nsuspicion of making those dots on the disc which correspond\nwith the lion's hind leg.\nOther dots on this red disc represent the crowned head of\nthe lion. An examination of the complete set of plates shows\nthis to have been the section of the figure which was borne\nhy the plate still missing, that is to say, one of the plates\nsaid to have been given by Mr. Price to Mr. Hope for the\n\u2022experiment and for which other plates were substituted either\nthen or at an earlier stage (see paragraphs 2 and 3 above).\nWhoever had the plate with the hind leg doubtless had also\ni}he plate marked Avith the crowned head ; the same person\nmust have copied from both plates to make the pattern\nwhich is on the red disc, and this person cannot have been\nHope.\n(To follow this argument in detail the reader requires the\nphotographic illustrations, and the text, embodied in the\nreport of which this is an abstract.)\n7. Finally, there is the mistaken remark in parcel No. 2\nabout Madam getting suspicious, which may more plausibly\nbe attributed to one of the experimenters than to anyone\n\u2022connected with the College.\n8. The general circumstances, therefore, and the internal\nevidence furnished by the contents of the parcels are favour-\nable to the theory of their source having been the Magic\nCircle rather than the College.\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1924.\n9. In the S.P.It. Jountal for May 1922, page 283, it was\nstated that\n:\n\" It can, we think, hardly be denied that Mr. William Hope\nhas been found guilty of deliberately substituting his own plates\nfor those of a sitter.\"\"\nOn an ex ;par?e statement of the case this impression was\nnatural ; but now that the other side has been heard and\nfresh facts have come to light it is inconceivable that any\nimpartial Court would convict him on the evidence.\nKeply to Mr. Drayton Thomas's Statement.\nWe give below a reply seriatim to the arguments put for-\nward by Mr. Thomas. It should be stated that this replv\nhas been made as brief as possible. If any of our Members-\nwish to enquire further into the case, they can see at the\nEooms of the Society a copy of Mr. Thomas's original detailed\ncriticism, and our Research Officer, Mr. E. J. Dingwall, or\nthe Hon. Editor, Mrs. Salter, will be glad to discuss with\nthem any points upon which they are not satisfied.\nThe numbers given below in round brackets refer to the\nnumbered sections of Mr. Thomas's statement.\n(2) With regard to the suggestion that the packet of plate*\ntaken by Mr. Price to the sitting cannot be proved to be the\nidentical packet containing all the plates prepared and marked\nby the Imperial Dry Plate Co., we are entirely satisfied that\nthe packet of plates handed over to Mr. Price and Mr. Seymour\nimmediately before the sitting was the identical packet com-\nmitted to the Society's charge. As to what occurred before\nthis packet came into the Society's possession we are admit-\ntedly dependent on Mr. Price's statement. On this point the\nHon. Officers of the Society have already stated {Jour. Jan.\n1923, p. 5) that after careful enqiiiry they can find no evidence\nwhatever that the packet had been tampered with by any of\nthe people through whose hands it had passed. No fresh\nevidence has been broxight to the Society's notice which could\nlead us to reconsider this conclusion, and the assumption that\nproper precautions were not taken for the continuous security\n\fJan., 1924. Concerni7ig the Price-Hope'\" Case. 195\nof the packet during its detention in the Society's keeping\nis gratuitous and unfounded.\n(3) With regard to the suggestion that Mr. Price may have\nfailed to mark the slide into which his own plates were put,\nwe would point out that while it is, of course, possible that\nMr. Price's apparatus failed to make the expected marks^\nthere is absolutely no ground for supposing this to have been\nthe case, in view of the fact that his own statements are clear\nand consistent ; he is experienced in such matters ; he knew\nexactly what he had to do and what to look for afterwards.\nWhen, therefore, he asserts positively that he marked one\nslide in a certain way and that the slide eventually put into\nthe camera was 7iot marked, his assertions afford strong pre-\nsumptive evidence that a change of slides had in fact been\neffected. This evidence is reinforced by the absence of any\nmarks on the two plates developed after the sitting.\nAs to the circumstance of Mr. Price having failed to draw\nMr. Seymour's attention to the marked slide, he has already\nexplained at the Annual Meeting of the Society in January\nlast that he was actuated by a desire not to arouse any\nsuspicion of his proceedings on the part of Mr. Hope or Mrs.\nBuxton.\n(4) With regard to the two anonymous packets it has not\nso far been possible\u2014although in this matter we have done our\nbest\u2014to obtain any clear evidence as to the identity of the\nsender. As to Mr. Thomas's statement that \" the sender was\nextraordinarily fortunate in selecting this particular undeveloped\nplate [one of the original marked plates] when rummaging\nthrough Hope's stock,'\" we cannot do better than repeat the\nstatement already made in the Journal for January 1923-\np. 8.\nIt is not difficult to suppose that the sender of the anonymous\npacket was aware of Mr. Price's experiment ;\nfor, according to\nMr. Price's account, two marked plates were left at the College\nin a dark slide into which they were loaded. Only one of them\nhas been returned. The other may well have been developed at\nthe College by Mr. Hope himself, who would thus become aware\nof its being marked, and that, therefore, Mr. Price must have\ndiscovered the substitution practised on him.\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1924.\nAs to the suggestion that no one at the British College for\nPsychic Science \" could have found out at so early a stage\nof the proceedings that the S.P.R. was concerned in the\nexperiment,\" it should be noted that Mr. Price was known to\nbe a Member of the Society, and that in March 1922 the\nfollowing note appeared in the Journal\n:\nThe Research Officer would be glad if those Members and\nAssociates of the Society who have experiments in view with Mr.\nHope, Mrs. Deane, or Mr. Vearncombe, would communicate with\nhim before arranging their sittings.\nIt is rather surprising that Mr. Thomas should assert positively\nthat the object of the sender of the two anonymous packets\n\" was to prejudice Hope's case,\" seeing that in Sections 5 and\n6 of his statement he himself argues that the contents of the\nsecond packet go far to prove Hope's innocence !\n(5) It is doubtless true that the representation of a Chinese\nMagician found upon one of the glass positives in the second\nanonymous packet might \" have been in the possession of\nsomebody connected mth the Magic Circle.'' But would such\na person have selected it as a likely method of casting sus-\npicion upon Mr. Hope ? Would he not have been more likely\nto reproduce upon this positive the kind of \" extra \" which\nis typical of Hope's phenomena ? It is more easily arguable\nthat someone of Mr. Hope's circle might have chosen the\nMagician in order to cast suspicion on someone comiected with\nthe Magic Circle.\n(6) We now come to the only point in Mr. Thomas's state-\nment which brings forward anything in the way of new\n\u2022evidence. Mr. Thomas contends that the marks upon the red\ncelluloid disc contained in the second anonymous packet are\nin fact copied from that portion of the Imperial Dry Plate\nCo.'s Trade Mark (the hind leg of the lion) which was repro-\nduced upon the undeveloped plate sent to the Society in the\nfirst anonymous packet and developed on behalf of the Society\nby the London Stereoscopic Society. No one, he says, \" could\nhave known Avhat was on this plate who had not seen it\n<ifter its development,'' and such a person must have been \" in\ntouch with the S.P.R.\"\n\fJan., 1924. Concerning the \"Price-Hope\" Case. 197\nAssuming for the moment that Mr. Thomas is correct in\nhis statement that part of the marks on the ceUuloid disc\nhave been copied from the plate sent undeveloped to the\nS.P.R., may we not ask why a person in touch with the\nS.P.R.\" and desirous to incriminate Hope should have deliber-\nately chosen to copy just that part of the Trade Mark con-\ncerning which knowledge could not easily be attributed to\nHope or any of his associates ? According to Mr. Thomas's\nown statement the marks on the celluloid disc were in part\ncopied from the plate which w^as (and still is) missing and\nmight be presumed to be in Hope's possession. Why did\nthe sender of the second anonymous packet not confine him-\nself to copying the marks on that missing plate, thereby\ncarrying the trail of suspicion straight back to Hope ?\nThe \" Chinese Magician \" argument suggests a surprising\nlack of resource in Mr. Thomas's shadowy villain ; the argument\nnow under consideration surely implies a perverse ineptitude\nwhich passes all behef !\nThe real answer, as we believe, to Mr. Thomas's argument\nis that there is no good reason for supposing that the marks\non the celluloid disc are \" copied \" from any part of the\nTrade Mark. For the details of Mr. Thomas's argument\n'(together yvith the ilhxstrations he sent us in support of it)\nwe must refer our readers to his full statement which, as we\nhave already said, can be seen at the Society's Rooms. Put\nbriefly the arguments against Mr. Thomas are as follows :\n(a) The alleged resemblance between a part of the pattern\non the celluloid disc and the hind leg of the lion (on the un-\ndeveloped plate) can only be made apparent by quite arbi-\ntrarily dividing the pattern on the celluloid disc into two parts\nat a point where there is no evidence of such a division\n;\nthat is to say, a group of dots which appear to form a con-\ntinuous curve has to be counted as belonging partly to one\nsection and partly to another.\n(6) The correspondence in number between the dots forming\na certain part of the pattern on the celluloid disc and the\n-dots forming the hon's hind leg (18 dots in each case, see\nMr. Thomas's detailed statement) is only reached by arbi-\ntrarily determining both as regards the celluloid disc and as\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1924\nregards the Trade Mark at what point in the pattern we are\nto begin and end the counting.\nWe maintain that the objections brought forward under\n(a) and {b) weaken Mr. Thomas's argument so seriously that\nonly an absolutely exact correspondence between the selected\nportion of the celluloid disc and the hind leg of the lion would\nhave enabled Mr. Thomas to prove his point.\nAs a matter of fact there is no exact correspondence ; there\nIS only a general resemblance in outUne, which does not seem\nat all beyond what chance might produce.\nWith regard to the resemblance detected by Mr. Thomas\nbetween the pattern on another part of the celluloid disc and\nthe crowned head of the lion, after subtracting the dots re-\nquired by Mr. Thomas to form the Uon's hind leg, we are\nleft with four large dots\u2014too few in number and too vague\nin outhne for any conclusion to be drawn from them\u2014and\na double row of small dots set close together, which have no\ncounterpart on any portion of the Trade Mark.\nWhat we suggest is that the person who made the celluloid\ndisc had probably seen that part of the Trade Mark which\nwould appear on the missing plate (left at the College accord-\ning to Mr. Price's statement and never traced since) ; thi&\nunknown person may or may not have recognised the pattern\non the plate as forming part of the Imperial Co.'s Trade\nMark\u2014on this point there is no clear evidence ; he did not\n\"copy\" any part of the Trade Mark, but he pricked out a\npattern of dots sufficiently like the marks on the plate to\nsuggest imitation.\nAs to the motive by which the sender of the two anonymous\npackets was actuated, no positive assertions can be made so\nlong as he remains imidentified. We should hke, however, to\nsuggest that if his motive was to obscure the issue and draw a\nred herring across the original trail, the amount of time and\ntrouble expended by Mr. Thomas and others in a discussion of\nthese packets is evidence of his success.\n(7) We cannot follow Mr. Thomas's reasoning. It does not\nappear to us that the wording of the remark included in the\nsecond anonymous packet affords any clear evidence one way\nor the other as to the source of the packets.\n\fjax., 1924. Concerning the '^Price-Hope\" Case. 199\n(8) For the reasons given above we dissent from Mr. Thomas's\nconclusion that \" the contents of the parcels are favourable\nto the theory of their source having been the Magic Circle\nlather than the College,\" though the general evidence is in-\nsufficient to justify us in suggesting the imphcation of any\nparticular person. Mr. Thomas, we note, does not repeat the\nsuggestion that has been made in other quarters that some\nperson at the Society's Offices tampered with the packet of\nplates before the experiment. It appears scarcely necessary\nto refer to this suggestion otherwise than by pointing out the\nfact that the wrapper, upon the condition of which it is based,\nwas preserved and handed over to the British College by our\nResearch Officer, an action absurdly inconsistent with any such\npresumed guilt.\n(9) After a careful consideration of all the evidence brought\nto our notice we are unable to find any indication of mala\njides either on the part of Mr. Price or on the part of any\nof those associated with him in his experiment, and we see\nno reason to doubt that the report of this experiment, as\nprinted in the Journal for May 1922, w^as substantially true.\nA year and seven months have now elapsed since the\nprinting of this report. During that interval the case has been\nthoroughly discussed at the Annual General IMeeting of the\nSociety in January 1923, and we have tried to give fair\nconsideration to such arguments as have been put forward\nfor rejecting Mr. Price's evidence. We do not feel that any\nuseful purpose can be served by prolonging the discussion,\n\u00abo far as concerns the evidence already before us. If anv new\nevidence of importance should be brought to our notice,\nMembers of the Society may be sure that it will receive our\nmost careful attention. !\nNote by Sir W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nI regret that in the very brief report of the Annual General\njMeeting of the Society, pubhshed in our Journal for February\nlast, there was not space for the excellent speech made by\nSir OHver Lodge on Sir A. Conan Doyle's motion, nor for\nmy letter to the chairman on the same topic.\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Besearch. Jan., 1924.\nThe following extract from my letter expresses the view I\nhold on the whole question :\n\"Whilst I have nothing to do with the investigation in dispute,\nlet me say that no one who knows our Research Officer, Mr.\nDingwall, can doubt for a moment that his zeal and ability are\ncoupled with a perfectly straightforward and open mind. At the\nsame time, the way in which the Hope inquiry has been con-\nducted is, I think, a matter for regret. Our Research Officer\nshould have had the investigation entirely in his own hands, or\nwithdrawn from it altogether. As it is, not only Mr. Price, but\ntwo other persons, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Moger\u2014neither of whom\nare connected with the S.P.R.\u2014were more or less mixed up in\nthe enquiry. I have not the least doubt they are all perfectly\nhonourable gentlemen, but under these circumstances, in view\nof the unsatisfactory results obtained, it is far better, in my\nopinion, not to waste time over further discussion and recrimina-\ntion, but to go back to Mr. Pugh's generous offer contained in\nthe July [1922] Journal, and begin the investigation de novo.\nMight I beg my friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to read the four\nliberal conditions stipulated by Mr. Pugh, accepted by the S.P.R.\n\u2014\nand, I believe also, by Mr. Hope, on condition that he was told\nabout the anonymous packet, which was done, I understand.\n\"We all know how much the mental attitude of the investigator\naffects the medium, and may inhibit all supernormal phenomena.\nHence it is undesirable that anyone who has already committed\nhimself adversely to Hope should take part in this further enquiry.\"'\nCONCERNING TWO NEW GROUPS FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH.\nWe have been informed by one of our Members, Herr\nRegierungsrat Ubald Tartaruga, that, upon his initiative, a\n\" Parapsycliic Institute \" has been established in Vienna. This.\nInstitute, which has for its object \"systematic and impartial\nenquiry into psychical phenomena,\" consists in a Committee of\nDirection and Associates.\nIt proposes to hold weelcly meetings every Saturday evening at\nthe Neue Wiener Handelsakademie.\nWe have also been informed by Monsieur Ed. Wietricli of the\nfoundation in Paris of the Societe d'Etudes Telepathiques (Cercle-\n\fJan., 1924. Correspondence. 201\nS. Hotel des Societes Savantes, 28 Paie Serpente, Paris 6).\nMonsieur Wietrich tells us that the Society would be glad to be\nput in touch with possible percipients with a view to arranging\nexperiments.\nWe are Qjlad to note these indications of increased interest in\npsychical research in other countries, and we wish both these\nSocieties all success.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nCONCEENING PROFESSOR RICHET S TRAITJS DE M^TA-\nPSYCHIQLE AND THE MEDIUM SAMBOR.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nNovember 16, 1923.\nDear Madam,\u2014I see that in his magnificent work Tmite de\nMetapsychique Professor Ch. Richet more than once refers to my\nexperiments with Sambor, but says that all these experiments\n\u2014\nand even \" everything Sambor did \"\u2014must be held to be \" abso-\nlutely suspicious\n'\"\"\n\u2014and this : because I (P. P. S.) did subsequently\nascertain that one of my friends, who was also one of the sitters\n(in some of the seances, be it added), proved to be Sanibor's\n\" accomplice.\"\nProfessor Bichet will permit me to state that in this form what\nhe atfi.rms is incorrect.^\nI never obtained' one item of evidence that the ''friend \" referred\nto {who died in 1915 or 1916) played the part of an accompilice of\nthe famous Russian medium. The evidence we subsequently\n(about eight years after S.'s death) did obtain was this : X. was\ndetected in not holding a medium's hand when he ought to have\ncontrolled it. As to this there is no doubt. And as it was X.\nwho controlled at some of my best sittings witli Sambor (notably\nat two simply marvellous ones held in St. Petersburg in May\n1902\u2014my last ones with that medium), I felt bound to consider\ntliat these seances must be held to be \" null and void \" : a\ntremendous pity since they were so good. But I repeat that we\nhad no direct evidence that X. did allow Sambor to cheat either\nat the sittings in question or at any other. In particular the\n1 See my article in S.P.E. Proceedings, Vol. XXV., 1911, pp. 413-417.\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jax., 1924.\nfirst of the two sittings above referred to seemed to contain at\nleast one feature telling against the hypothesis of fraud : some of\nthe sitters who were facing the windows thought they saw a kind\nof stick protruding from the medium and moving a chair which\nhad been (\" supernormally \") placed on the table ;\nwhen, however,\nthat part of the sitting over, Sambor was thoroughly searched\nnothing suspicious was found. Still I cannot honestly lay stress\non these two sittings, seeing that unfortunately X. controlled at\nthem ; but that is all.\nIn justice to the late Sambor (who died in 1902) I, though now\nfin almost thorough sceptic, wish to make that plain statement.\nAs for the experiments with the so-called \" chair threading \" to\nwhich Professor Richet very briefly I'efers (]). 710), the X. incident\nleaves these experiments entirely unaffected (with one exception\nonly : when at one of the two seances in question the chair was\nthreaded on X.'s own arm). I still think these experiments very\nremarkable, and possibly affording us {via suggestion) an explana-\ntion of some a])parently \" ectoplasmic \" cases. For they leave us\nno choice between either (o) passage of matter through matter\n(which I reject) or (6) unreliability of the hand control even when\nthe medium's hand is grasped.\nThe painful and absuid X. episode (and I may add by the way\nthat even when hard pressed by me subsequently X. never\nadmitted he had cheated) leaves my special experiments on\nSambor's \" chair threading,\" I can say it honestly, entirely\nuntouched.\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo\n.\nP.S.\u2014I observe that apropos of the Sambor-X. case Professor\nEichet says :\n\" On ne pent pas faire assister a une experience des individus\nquelconques ; ils doivent etre tons d'une loyaute tellement irre-\nprochable que nous pourrions I'attester avec autant de force que\nsi c'etait la notre \"\n(pp. 599, 600).\nIt may interest your readers to know that X. was far from\nbeing \" un individu quelconque.\" He died in a very important\ndiplomatic post abroad (that is, not in Russia). Prior to that lie\nhad been for many years an official in the Russian Foreign Office,\nPetrograd. Apart from that he was a most distinguished and\nwell-known alpinist, a painter, and a writer ; and a very pleasant\nman besides. He was also a Chamberlain of the Imperial Court.\n\fJan., 1924. Correspondence\n.\n203\nI may add by the way that he never \" confessed.\" Since my\narticle in S.P.E.. Proceedings (Vol. XXV. pp. 413-446) I had the\nopportunity in 1911, under rather dramatic circumstances, of\nentreating him in as eloquent and friendly terms as I could\nmuster to admit that he had deceived me. He maintained cate-\ngorically he had not. I then let the matter drop. And yet we\nundoubtedly did detect him in not holding the medium's hand.\nAnd this of course makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to\nattach any importance to any cases in which he controlled, and\ncasts a peculiarly lurid light on the sittings in his presence at which\nnumerous apports appeared (the medium being chiefly a girl\n-called Luba Morozofi). I often ask myself if his case is not\nsomewhat analogous to a mucli more famous one : that of the\nEev. Stainton Moses.

Metta.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nOctober has an account of certain alleged telepathic experiments\nwith Mr. Romano at Warsaw. From the account published\nthere appears to be no evidence of telepathy ; it is rather a\nrecord of various kinds of \" muscle \" and \" sound \" reading.

Belle Cross.\nThe issue for November has a long review by Sir Oliver Lodge\nof Prof. Richet's recently published Traite de Metapsychique (also\npublished in Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIV., p. 70 ff.) and two\ntranslations from Dr. Geley and Prof. Oesterreich. Dr. Titus\nBull replies to a request by Dr. Osty for a clear statement upon\nthe resistance to metapsychic science as seen in the United States.\nDr. Bull sees in this resistance a relation to the assumed spiritual\ncausality underlying psychical phenomena. Science to him is\ntaking the place of religion and demanding power and control for\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 19 24\nitself. Materialism, as seen in the commercial civilisation of the\nUnited States, is a factor making, according to Ur. Bull, for a\nutilitarian order, and consequently the problems of psychical\nresearch have but little attraction for the commercial mind.\nPsychische Studien for September has a review of Dr. Schwab's\nrecent experiments by Baron von Schrenck-Notzing ; an article\nby Dr. E. Kindborg on telepathy ; and a review by Dr. Rabel\nof Count Keyserling's book Das Okhilte, recently noticed in these\npages. The issue for October has the first instalment of an\naccount by Prof. Adolf Hoffmann of the poltergeist disturbances\nat Brody, a small town on the Polish-Ga^ician frontier. The\nphenomena, which remind the reader strongly of the recent dis-\nturbances at Ledaig, took place in the house of a local parson\nand commenced in 1922. Raps and telekinetic movements are\nreported, besides a certain amount of \"direct\" writing on paper\nsupplied for the purpose.\nThe Reviie Metapsychique for July-August has a continuation of\nthe account of the seances with the medium Guzik, both in\nWarsaw and Paris.

She felt that it was one\nof their own men whom she knew, but could not recognise his\nfeatures, as his face was scarred and cut. The witness added that\nhis wife knew the dead man very well. He was a good and con-\nscientious soldier, who always went for solitary walks.\nA verdict of \" Accidentally drowned, while bathing,\" was^\nreturned.\nOn October 2, 1923, after reading the above report, and\nagain on October 20 and 22, 1923, the Secretary, Miss Newton,\nwrote to Quartermaster-Sergeant McGuinn to ask for further\nparticulars. On October 23, 1923, Quartermaster-Sergeant\nMcGuinn wrote to Miss Newton, thus :\n3 Married Quarters,\nThe King's Regiment, Jersey, C.I., 23-10-13.\nI am in receipt of your letters D\/2nd, 20th, 22nd, inst. request-\ning further information as to the death of Pte. A. W. Quinn and\nmy wife's dream in connection thereto. I have been particularljr\n\fFeb., 1924. Cases. 207\nbusy in preparing a draft for foreign service, or should have\nwritten you earlier, and have also had no little trouble in over-\ncoming my wife's objections to further publicity in the matter.\nIn the first j^lace it will be as well to enlighten you to the fact\nthat the late Pte. Quinn was my storeman, and that my wife\nknew him quite well. During September half my company were\nat Les Landes Musketry Camp, firing the annual course. I went\nout daily by bicycle, but Quinn remained at camp to look after\nmy stores there.\nOn the morning of the 27th Sept. (I am sure of the date as it\nwas my 36th birthday) my wife told me that she had had a\nnasty nightmare, and had dreamed that we were on a cliff near\nSt. Ouen's Bay. when, on looking over into the sea, she saw the\nbody of a man floating in the water face downwards. The head\nappeared to be very swollen and white looking, with a very deep\ngash near the forehead, and was pitted and scarred with small\ncuts. She felt instinctively that it was one of our men whom she\nknew well, but she could not see the face or recognise whom it\nwas. She went off to sleep but dreamed the same dream over\nagain.\"\nMy wife's description of the man's head was strikingly vivid, as\nshe likened its general appearance to the head of a little baby she\nhad seen a few days previously which was suffering from \" water\non the brain.\" ' '\nI afterwards identified the body in the mortuary, and saw\nimmediately how much the head was like my wife's description\nof it. There was a deep gash over the left temple, and the top\nof the head was covered in small cuts, where apparently the rocks\nhad cut it each time the body was washed against the rocks.\nThe spot where the body was found (Beauvallet) is quite near\nSt. Ouen's Bay, and its description tallies with the appearance of\nthe place in my wife's dream. My wife had never been further\nthan the shore, quite five miles from where the body was found.\nThe absence of Pte. Quinn was first notified to me by telephone\nat about 2 p.m. on the 27th Sept., when I was asked if I had\ncalled him in to attend to stores in barracks. During the after-\nnoon I mentioned to my wife that Pte. Quinn was reported absent.\nShe became very agitated, and said she felt sure that he had met\nwith an accident. Quinn was a most sober and conscientious man,\nand I could not bring myself to believe that he was absenting\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1924.\nhimself in an ordinary way. I let tlie matter go until next morn-\ning, when I went to the Orderly Room and asked for a search\nparty to be sent out. I related my wife's dream to the Orderly\nRoom Sergeant (on the 28th), and it of course met with the usual\nlaugh which, perhaps not unnaturally, occurs when one relates such\nan incident.\nHowever, on the 29th, as I was so insistent that the man was\nnot absent, a search party was sent out, and at about 2 p.m.\nfound the body floating in the water, exactly as described in my\nwife's dream. The clothing was found first, half-way down the\nrocks, and that of course stimulated the search.\nTwo other instances, although having no bearing on the present\ncase, I would mention as they will no doubt interest members of\nyour society.\nFifteen years ago my wife dreamed that her sister was being\nburied. As the hearse went along the road and turned a corner,\nshe saw (in her dream) the sun come out and illuminate the\nhearse and coffin. A month later her sister died, and each incident\nof the funeral, even to that of the sun shining on the coffin\nat the turn of the corner, was repeated in reality as in the\ndream.\nIn Sept., 1914, I was reported missing and killed in the retire-\nment from Mons. Although my own mother and relatives believed\nme to be dead, my fiancee (I was not married then) refused to\nbelieve it and insisted all along that I was alive, as she had\ndreamed that she had seen me waving to her as I had waved\nfrom the boat when we left England. I was wounded and taken\nprisoner, and the first news my people received of me was towards\nthe latter end of November, 1914.\nI have related the foregoing as I know it to be true, and may\nbe of some use in the solving of the problem of the sub-conscious\nself. My wife too often had premonitions of certain occurrences,\nand in most cases the thing occurred.\nMy wife cannot sit down and write about her dream, it un-\nnerves her so. I have written for her, and trust it will serve its\npurpose in aiding you in your researches.\n\u2022\n, : : - . E. J.

Cases. 209\nIn reply to this letter, Miss Newton wrote again to Quarter-\nmaster-Sergeant McGuinn on November 7, 1923, asking for\nfurther information on the following points :\n(1) Is it known approximately when Private Quinn dis-\nappeared or was last seen ?\n(2) When did Mrs. McGuinn last see Private Quinn ?\n(3) Is there any reason for supposing the case to be one\nof suicide ?\n(4) Did Mrs. McGuinn know Private Quinn well enough to\nknow whether he was depressed or worried about anything?\nMiss Newton also enquired whether it would be possible to\nobtain from the Orderly Eoom Sergeant a statement of his\nrecollection of the account given him of the dream on Sep-\ntember 28, 1923, before the finding of the body.\nIn reply to this letter Quartermaster-Sergeant McGuinn wrote\nagain as follows :\n18-11-23.\nWith reference to your letter of 7th inst., I have asked the Orderly\nRoom Sergeant if he will be wilHng to corroborate my statement to\nhim of my wife's dream. He is prepared to do so, and will\nanswer any questions you may put to him upon the subject.\nThe following will find him\n:\nQ.M.S. Franklin, 2a Green Street, St. Helier, Jersey,\nI will answer your questions as fully as possible, trusting they\n\\vill be lucid enough to give some light upon so complex a subject.\n(1) According to evidence given at the inquest, Pte. Quinn was\nlast seen about 3.30 p.m. on 26th Sept. walking in the direction\nof the cliffs.\n(2) My wife saw Pte. Quinn on the Saturday prior to his death,\ni.e. 22nd Sept.\n(3) There was a rumour to the effect that Pte. Quinn had\ncommitted suicide. The only information I have elicited with\nregard to the birth of the rumour is the fact that Pte. Quinn\nwas supposed to have been jilted by his fiancee. I personally\nwent through his correspondence but found nothing to indicate\nthat he had been jilted. Only a fortnight prior to his death he\nhad asked me for the information as to his prospects of being\nplaced upon the married roll of the battalion, and told me that\n\f210 Journal of Society for Psychical Kef<earch. Feb., 1924.\niie wished me to arrange for his annual leave in January for the\npurpose of getting married.\n'\nPte. Quinn's clothing was found folded and covered by his over-\ncoat. From my personal experience of Quinn, I think suicide was\nmost unlikely.\n(4) My wife had no knowledge as to whether he was worried or\ndepressed. She knew him simply as my storeman from the fact\nthat I sent him to my quarters with messages, etc.\nShe also knew from what I had told her that Quinn was apt to\nworry over trifles, and she remembers that once when Pte. Quinn\nhad been placed under arrest by a young non-commissioned\nofEcer, he came to see me at my quarters, and was in a very\nagitated condition until I heard the full facts of the case, and\nreleased him from arrest. Quinn was a man who worried and\nfumed over minor matters. He was also, as far as is possible in\nthe army, somewhat of a recluse, and devoted to reading books\nupon somewhat abstruse subjects, a queer taste for a man not well\neducated. E. J. McGuinn.\nQuartermaster-Sergeant McGuinn also explained in the above\nletter that the two incidents described in the concluding part\nof his letter of October 28, 1923, occurred before his marriage,\nthe percipient being in each case his present wife.\nIn reply to the above letter Miss Newton wrote to Quarter-\nmaster-Sergeant McGuinn asking for a signed statement from\nMrs. McGuinn, endorsing the record sent to us of her dream.\nSubsequently Mrs. McGuinn sent the following statement\n:\nDecember 4, 1923.\nI have read the letters to Miss Newton written by my husband\non 23rd Oct. and 18th Nov., and agree with all that he has written\nwith reference to my dream and other experiences. L. M. McGuinn.\nMiss Newton also wrote to Quartermaster-Sergeant Franklin\nasking for an account of what he remembered being told of\nMrs. McGuinn's dream before Private Quinn's body was found.\nThe following reply was received :\n- December 26, 1923.\nIn reply to your letters, which I regret I have not answered\nearlier.\nC.Q.M.S. McGuinn mentioned to me about 11 a.m. on the\n\fTeb., 1924. Cases. 211\nmorning of the 27th September\/ 1923, that his wife, Mrs. McGuinu,\nhad dreamt that she saw the body of a soldier she knew, but\ncould not recognise, lying on the sands at the foot of a cliff\ndead.\nAt that time I was unaware that any one was absent in the\nbattalion. At 2 p.m. I received notification officially that Pte.\nQuinn was an absentee.\nI did not regard his absence as a serious matter or think any-\nthing harmful had happened to him, and especially would not\nconnect the man with committing suicide by any means, drowning\nor otherwise. He was an exceptionally steady man, and his work\nwas always performed conscientiously.\nHis body was found on the 29th September, 1923, by a search\nparty which was sent out on the off chance \" that there \" might\nbe something in the dream,\" I having mentioned the fact of the\ndream to my superior.\nThe dream was related to me 2 days^ before the man was found.\nA. H. Franklin, Q.M.S.\nA detailed report of the inquest on the body of Private\nQuinn was published in the Jersey Weekly Post on October 6,\n1923. It corroborates the statements made by Q.M.S. McGuinn\nand Q.M.S. Franklin, and the following paragraphs are worth\nnoting : ,. ,\nLce.-Corpl. Alexander McCann said he was sent with a search\nparty at 2.45 on Saturday (Sept. 29, 1923) after the clothes had\nbeen found ;\nthey were on the top of a rock. Pte. Jones, who\nwent around one side, saw something floating in the water ; the\nhead was being dashed against the rocks. . . . Pte. Fred. Geo.\nJones corroborated the previous witness's evidence. . . . He\nrecognised the body as that of Quinn by the short or square\nneck ; the features were not recognisable.\nIt also appeared from e\\adence given at the inquest that\nPrivate Quinn was not present w^hen the roll was called at\n9.30 p.m. on September 26, but as he had a late pass, this\ncircumstance attracted no attention. He w-as reported absent\n^ According to Q.M.S. McGuinn's statement, he related his dream on\nSeptember 28, 1923. It seems, however, certain that he related it before\nthe finding of the body.\n\" See footnote above.\n\f212 Journal of Society for Psycldeal Research. Feb., 1924.\nwhen tlie roll was called at 6.30 a.m. the following morning.\nHe was last seen alive in the early afternoon of September 26,\nand his death presumably occurred soon after. At the time of\nMrs. McGuinn's dream\u2014during the night of September 26-27\n\u2014\nit may therefore be supposed that he had been dead some\nhours, but, so far as can be ascertained, no living person had\nat that time any normal knowledge of the fact or circumstances\nof his death. So far as concerns the fact of his death by\ndrowning, Mrs. McGuinn's dream might be accounted for by a\ntelepathic impression received from Private Quinn at the\nmoment of death. But this will not account for the close\ncoincidence as regards the conditions of the body and the\ncircumstances in which it was found. Unless this coincidence\ncan be ascribed to chance there appears to be in the dream,\nan element of prevision.\nIt will be observed that there is a shght discrepancy between\nthe account of the dream given in Q.M.S. McGuinn's letter of\nOctober 23, and the account in Q.M.S. Frankhn's letter of\nDecember 26. According to the former Mrs. McGuinn saw\nthe body floating in the water (where it was in fact found)\n;\naccording to the letter she saw it lying on the sand. Of the\ntwo accounts, Q.M.S. McGuinn's, being earlier in date, seems\nrather the more hkely to be accurate ; it corresponds, more-\nover, with the statement made by Q.M.S. McGuinn at the\ninquest on September 30, 1923, only three days after the\ndream and one day after the finding of the body. As may\nbe judged by his letters, he is a good and careful\nwitness.\nMiss Newton also made some enquiry into the question of the\nweather at the time of Mrs. McGuinn's dream, to see whether\nit was such a kind as particularly to suggest death by drown-\ning. It appears, however, that though there had been strong\nwinds earlier in the week, amounting on September 23 to a.\n\" moderate gale,\" the wind on September 26 (the day before\nthe dream) was only a \" hght breeze\" and the sea \"moderate.\"\nWe should like to take this opportunity of thanking Q.M.S.\nand Mrs. McGuinn and also Q.M.S. Franklin for the trouble\nthey have taken in assisting us to put an interesting case oa\nrecord.\n\fFeb., 1924. Cases. 213\nII.\nL. 1252. A Telepathic Impression.\nWe are indebted for the follo\\ving report of what appears to\nbe a case of telepathy to Miss A. M. Brown, who was herself\nthe percipient and has given us permission to print her name.\nMiss Brown's first report of the case was contained in a\nletter to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nOct. 22, 1923.\nAs the S.P.R. among other activities is apparently still collect-\ning examples of telepathy, the enclosed notes of an instance of\nthe spontaneous kind may perhaps be of interest. May I add a\nfurther detail to the notes, omitted at the time they were made\n(yesterday, Oct. 21). \" A. H. C4.\" left this morning, so is unable\nto witness the statement.\nIt will be convenient to insert at this point the notes to\nwhich Miss Brown refers as enclosed in her letter of Oct. 22,\n1923, for the \"further detail\" is not easily intelligible until-\nthe original statement has been read.\nStatement Enclosed in Miss Brown's Letter op\nOct. 22, 1923.\nOctober 21, 1923.\nThe evening before last I and A. H. G. were sitting together\nby the fire reading. She was reading the End of the House of\nAlard by Sheila Kaye Smith, and I, Moordius & Co., by Locke.\nSuddenly a memory came into my mind entirely unconnected with\nanything in my book or anything I had been thinking about\nduring the day, and I said to A., \" Do you remember the people-\nwho lived at B House ?\n\" naming a place near a country\ncottage I had rented for some years, and where A. had spent\nsome months a year or two ago. She replied that she did, but\ncould not remember their names. Neither could I, at the moment,\nbut I went on to tell her the piece of information which had\njust flashed into my mind, and which had been given me by a\nmutual friend some months ago. It had reference to a divorce\ncase. When I had finished A. said : \" What made you think of\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1924.\nthat ?\n\" \"I haven't the least idea,\" I replied ; \"it just came into\nmy mind.\" \"Well, it is odd,\" she said, \"but I was just reading\nabout a similar case when you spoke.\" She was reading Part II.,\nSect. 4, p. 83. I had not read the book at that time, nor had\nI read any detailed review of it.\nA. M. Brown.\nI certify that this account is correct.\nAgnes H. Gibb.\nWe will now quote the latter part of Miss Brown's letter\nof October 22, 1923 :\nLater in the evening [Oct. 19, 1923] I said, \" I have just\nremembered the name of the people at B House ; it was\n'\nPembroke.' \" \" Oh, no,\" she said, \" I am sure it was not ;\nthat is the name of the people in my book.\" Afterwards I did\nremember the name of the people ; it had no resemblance whatever\nto that of \" Pembroke,\" it began with C and ended with D.\nI have never tried any experiments with telepathy or \" thought-\nreading,\" but have had frequent instances of the non-experi-\nmental type. ;,\nI have also had one or two curious veridical dreams, but\nunfortunately took no notes at the time, so have no evidence to\nshow for them.\nA. M. Brown.\nIn reply to this letter Mrs. Salter wrote to Miss Brown to\npoint out that as regards the name \" Pembroke,\" which did\nnot come into Miss Brown's mind until after she knew that\nthe apparent thought-transference between her friend and her-\nself was concerned with a particular book The End of the\nHouse of AJarrL it was possible that Miss Brown had at some\ntime read a review of the book in which the name \" Pembroke\n\"\nwas mentioned ; if this were so, it would account for the\nassociation of ideas in Miss Brown's mind. In reply to this\nletter, Miss Brown wrote to Mrs. Salter as follows :\nOct. 31, 1923.\nI have no objection to your mentioning my name in connec-\ntion with the thought-transference case, if you should wish to\nrecord it. With regard to the name \" Pembroke,\" I cannot\n\fFeb., 1924. Cases. 215\nrecall having read any detailed review of the book that men-\ntioned it\u2014the episode of her divorce proceedings is only incidental,\nas you wUl see on reading the book. She was a married daughter\nof the Alard family, and her married name is rarely mentioned.\nThe incident impressed my friend specially because of a somewhat\nsimilar case which took place in her own family some years ago.\nWe had not discussed the book at all (I had not read it at\nthat time), nor had she even commented on it.\nOf course, I cannot be sure that the name \" Pembroke \" was\nnot mentioned in a review ;\nbut, of course, as you say, that\npoint would not affect the other more evidential part of the\nthought-transference.\nA. M. Brown.\nSubsequently, after reading The End of the House of Alard,\nMrs. Salter wrote again to Miss Brown to ask whether the fol-\nlowing note was in her opinion a fair and adequate summing\nup of the incident in question :\nA married daughter, Mary Pembroke, is threatened with divorce\nproceedings by her husband and, whilst maintaining her inno-\ncence, is anxious to let the case go undefended, in order to avoid\nnotoriety and unpleasantness. Her family, however, take the\nview that it is her duty to defend herself, and eventually she\nyields to their arguments.\nIn reply, Miss Brown wrote to Mrs. Salter, thus :\nDec. 26, 1923.\nIn reply to your letter of the 19th . . . your account of the\nincident of the Pembroke divorce in The End of the House of\nAlard could not be put more concisely and accurately. The\nincident it brought to my mind was one in which the pressure\nwas brought to bear by the man's family, not the woman's,\nand was of a financial nature. The result of the trial was the\nsame in both cases ...\n'\nA. M. Brown.\nWith regard to the name \u2022\u2022\nPembroke, \"'\nalthough, as Miss\nBrown points out in her letter of Oct. 31, 1923, this name is\nnot likely to have been mentioned in any but a very detailed\nreview of the book, and, so far as she is aware, Miss Brown\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1924.\nhad never seen such, a review, it is impossible to be absolutely\ncertain that Miss Brown had no normal knowledge of the\noccurrence of the name in the book. This doubt, however,,\ndoes not affect the evidence for thought-transference presented\nby the first part of the incident.\nDr. PAGENSTECHER'S EXPERIMENTS IN PSYCHOMETRY.\nA REMARKABLE series of experiments in psychometry is recorded\nby Dr. Pagenstecher, one of our members, and Dr. Walter\nPrince in Vols. XV. and XVI. of the Proceedings of the\nAmerican S.P.R. The medium, Senora Maria Reyes de Z, is\na Mexican lady of good social position and better education\nthan is usually possessed by ladies of her nationality. During\na course of hypnotic treatment for the cure of insomnia, Dr.\nPagenstecher observed that she manifested the possession of\nsupernormal faculties, of which she had herself until then no\nsuspicion.\nDr. Pagenstecher began his psychometric experiments in\n1919, and the results he obtained were so surprising that he\nlaid the facts before the leading Mexican Medical Society,\nwhich appointed a commission to verify them. Members of\nthis commission were present at several experiments and,\nequally with Dr. Pagenstecher, were convinced of the super-\nnormal nature of the phenomena observed. In 1921 Dr.\nWalter Prince went to Mexico and had several very successful\nsittings. The case is therefore noteworthy for the amount of\nskilled observation it has received.\nThe experiments conducted by Dr. Pagenstecher and also\nby the Medical Society's Commission are recorded in Vol. XVI,\nof the American Proceedings, and Dr. Prince's observations in\nVol. XV. It is perhaps unfortunate that the earlier series,\nwhich was distinctly more successful, was not recorded with\nquite the same clearness and fulness of detail as the later.\nThe procedure throughout was substantially the same.\nSenora Z. and Dr. Pagenstecher were weighed at the beginning\nof the sitting. Dr. Pagenstecher then hypnotised her, and\ntests were applied to ascertain how far she retained her\n\fFeb., 1!)24. Dr. Pagenstechefs Experiments in Psychometry. 217\nordinary senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. It\nappears that she completely lost all these senses, except that\nshe was able to grasp with her fingers the object placed\nwithin them for the purpose of the experiment, and to hear\nand answer questions put to her by Dr. Pagenstecher. But\nit was found that Dr. Pagenstecher's sensations were trans-\nmitted to her, so that, if a bright Hght were flashed in his\neyes, she flinched, although she took no notice of a hght\nflashed in her own. At the close of the experiment, they were\nboth weighed again, and it was invariably found that both\nhad lost weight considerably. However, in half-an-hour or so\nthey returned to approximately their normal weights.\nThe object to be psychometrised was placed between the\nmedium's fingers, which immediately clasped over it and then\nkept rigid. She does not appear, therefore, to have been\nassisted by any deductions that might be drawn from feehng\nthe object all over. The objects submitted were of various\nkinds, e.g. a shoe, the seed of a tropical plant, fragments of\nstone from ancient monuments, pieces of timber with historical\nassociations, etc. In some cases the history and nature of the\nobject was known to some of the experimenters, in others not.\nIn the former class it was, of course, impossible, as Dr. Prince\nrecognises, to exclude the possibility of successful results being\ndue to telepathy, but some of the most striking successes were\nobtained where the history of the object was only ascertained\nlater by the experimenters.\nIn view, however, of the remarkable powers shown by the\nmedium as regards the transference to herself of Dr. Pagen-\nstecher's physical sensations, we are bound to refer to tele-\npathy any cases in which the history of the object was known\nto him. For instance, a piece of marble was submitted to\nSenora Z. at three sittings. At the first, when Dr. Pagen-\nstecher was unaware of its origin, she described merely an\nopen space, where, as she said, \" it seems they are building a\ntown,\"' with what appeared to be a church in the background.\nThe marble in fact came, as Dr. Pagenstecher ascertained\nbetween this sitting and the next, from the Forum Romanum.\nBut no details were given at this sitting which might not\nreasonably be attributed to subconscious guessing on the part\n\f218 JotirnaL of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1924,\neither of Dr. Pagenstecher or Senora Z. At the second and\nthird sittings, however, the principal features of the Forum\nwere clearly described, and from a post-hypnotic sketch of her\nvision, made by the medium while still ignorant of the pro-\nvenance of the object, it is clear that she had visualised the\nForum, as it exists to-day, with great clearness. Even,\nhowever, if we are compelled to relegate this particular case\nto the domain of telepathy, it remains sufficiently remarkable.\nThere are, however, other cases which it is extremely\ndifficult to explain by telepathy. The following is, perhaps, the\nmost striking. A friend of Dr. Pagenstecher, then in Japan,\nsent by hand, to a lawyer in Mexico City, an envelope con-\ntaining a letter to Dr. Pagenstecher and two sealed envelopes.\nThe letter stated that one of the sealed envelopes contained a\npaper written under circumstances of great emotion, and the\nother a description of the supposed writer. The letter requested\nDr. Pagenstecher to submit the first to Senora Z. and not to\npermit either to be opened until the close of the sitting.\nThese directions were comphed with, and both Dr. Pagen-\nstecher and Dr. Prince were present at the sitting. Senora Z.\ndescribed a ship, at night : there were many people on board,\nfrightened : the language spoken was English, and people were\nputting on life-preservers. She described in some detail a\nman with a scar over the left eyebrow, tearing out a leaf from\na Uttle book, writing on it, and after the sound of an explosion,\nputting it in a bottle and throwing it in the sea.\nWhen the seals were broken, in the presence of Dr. Prince\nand Dr. Pagenstecher, the following facts, till then unknown\nto all present, were disclosed. The envelope submitted to\nSenora Z. contained a slip of paper, apparently torn from a\npocket-book, with words iu Spanish hastily written on it, of\nwhich the following is a translation :\nThe ship is sinking\nFarewell my Luisa ; see \u2022\nthat my children do not\nforget nie your\nRamon.\n\u2022\nHavana\nMay God care for you\nand me also farewell.\n\fFeb., 1924. Dr. Pageiistccher' s Experiments in Psychometry. 219'\nThis writing had been found in a bottle, picked up off the\ncoast of the Azores. From enquiries made at Havana, it\nappeared that a gentleman, who for political reasons passed\nthere imder the assumed name of Ramon P., disappeared in\n1916. His handwriting closely resembled that of the paper\nfound in the bottle, and he had a wife. Luisa, and children.\nHe was supposed to have left Havana for Europe, and was\nbeheved by his wife to have perished when the Lusitania\nwas sunk. In physical appearance, including the scar, he\nclosely resembled the description given by Senora Z.\nEven in this case, of course, it is not absolutely impossible\nthat the facts, as known or believed by the gentleman then\nin Japan, had been transmitted to Senora Z. telepathically,\nbut in the particular circumstances such an explanation seems\nrather far-fetched.\nWe regret that space will not permit of our quoting further\ninstances. Senora Z., whatsoever the precise nature of her\npowers, is clearly a most remarkable medium. We recommend\nour readers to study carefully her case as presented in the\ntwo volumes of the Proceedings of the American Society.\nNOTES OX PERIODICALS.\nPsychiscJie Studien for Xovember has an account by Dr. von\nSchrenck-Xotzing on the International Congress at Warsaw, and\nthe continuation of the report of the Brody poltergeist case from\nthe October issue. The December number of the same journal\ncontains an article by Dr. Ludwig on the position of Roman\nCatholics to parapsychology ; a paper by General Peter on psychic\nphotography, and the continuation of Dr. Walther Kroner's\nprotocols concerning certain experiments in medical clairvoyance.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research\nfor January appears in slightly new format and contains a long\nseries of articles. Dr. Murphy gives a short account of the\nCongress, with summaries of some of the papers. Dr. Walter\nPrince prints four separate cases, two of which he classes as\npossibly premonitory in nature, although the evidence is, as he\nadmits, not of a very impressive character.

To suppose that the Universe is but meaningless and\nfutile is, according to Sir Oliver, a blasphemous supposition, and\nthus the life of man may be something more than a gradual\nprogression towards extinction. Modern views in physics appear\nto lighten the difficulties of the acceptance of a supposed \" spiri-\ntual body,\" and the author concludes that human life cannot\nfail to be assisted by the broader conceptions engendered by a\nwider outlook of the Universe as a whole and of man's place\ntherein.\nThe Scientific American for December has a detailed account\nof the recent sittings held with the American medium, Jose\nStewart. The attention of the Committee had been called to\nthis medium by Sir A. C. Doyle, who had been shown a number\nof affidavits, and who affirms that many thousands of people\nhave tested and fully endorsed Mrs. Stewart's alleged power.\nThe phenomena consist in the production of messages written\nin ink, purporting to be supernormal and to be produced by the\nspirits of deceased persons. As the messages are produced upon\ncards supplied by the investigators, the easiest way of producing\nthe phenomena fraudulently is to exchange the cards, although\nthis is not absolutely necessary. The Committee's findings are\nthat the cards were so exchanged, those upon which writing\nappeared being longer, greyer, thinner, and with a more mottled\ntexture than those supplied by the investigators. Sir Arthur's\nreply to the decision of the Committee is that if it is correct,\nMrs. Stewart must be the champion prestidigitateur of the world,\nand that spiritualists must be slow before accepting the result.\nE.

The following Members were present\n:\nMr. W. W. Baggally, the Rt. Hon. G. W. Balfour, Sir George\nBeilby, Mr. E. N. Bennett, Mrs. E. Kenneth Campbell, Miss\nCotterell, Mrs. K. C. Creasy, Mr. E. J.

Mont-\ngomery Smith, Mr. J. St. Loe Strachey, Rev. C. D. Thomas,\n(Una) Lady Troubridge, Miss Wills, and Dr. V. J. WooUey.\nThe Chairman presented the Report of the Council. Dr.\nV. J. Woolley read the Report to the Meeting ; and discussion\nwas invited.\nThe Hon. Treasurer (Mr. W. H. Salter) in presenting the\nFinancial Statement for the year said that although the balance\nin hand stood at \u00a3779 this actually represented the dona-\ntion of \u00a3510 for the building of the Seance Room, and also\nincluded the sum of \u00a3250 realised by the sale of one of the\nSociety's securities which was awaiting re-investment ; so that\ntaking this into consideration the Society had actually just met\nits expenses. A very high proportion of the total income was\nexpended in printing ; the printers' accounts for the year\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1924.\nhaving amounted to \u00a3963. He hoped that this year it would\nbe possible to lower the printing expenses, especially with\nthe help of Lord Dunraven's generous donation. The loss in\nmembership referred to in the Keport was not due to excessive\nresignations or excessive deaths but to the fact that during\nthe last year fewer new members had been elected. This\nwas partly because the Society was no longer electing Associates.\nIn view of this it would be necessary to restrict printing,\nand therefore an increase in membership was desirable.\nKev. C. D. Thomas said he would be very glad of the\nopportunity to make a few remarks bearing upon the Price-\nHope case.\nAlthough it was eighteen months since the publication in\nthe Journal of a charge of dishonesty certain results remained,\nand all agreed that the remaining results were deplorable. He\nknew both of the bitter feelings that had been experienced and\nalso the sense of injustice that had been felt. And in con-\nsequence the Society was now severely limited, at least for the\ntime being, in any further attempts to solve the problem as to\nhow are obtained what are termed \" extras \" in photography.\nMany members who unfortunately found themselves seriously\nat variance with the Council in the Price-Hope case, regretted\nthat it was not possible at the present time to arrange any\nsittings with the Crewe Circle. But human nature being what\nit was, he felt that such investigation was for the present at\nleast out of the question.\nIn reviewing the Price-Hope case Mr. Thomas offered as\nhis personal opinion about it the remark that in addition\nto the initial mistake in backing up with all the prestige of\nthe Society the verdict of a private member, it seemed to\nhim that the Council was unhappy in the subsequent decision.\nFirst, to withhold for six months all information relating to\nthe circumstances in which one of the missing plates had come\ninto its possession, and keeping secret the facts of the two\nanonymous parcels ;\nand, secondly, to refuse the request for a\njoint inquiry into all the details of the charge, so that there\nwas the unedifying spectacle of the Council acting the double\npart of accuser and of judge and refusing to submit their case\nto a jury. Possibly the Council as such might have had very\n\fMar., 1924. Anntiol General Meeting of Members. 227\nlittle to do with the matter, but left these matters to its Research\nOfficer and its editorial Committee, but the Council did as a\nwhole make itself responsible for the action of those officers.\nTo the first part of his report^ he had nothing to add, but\nthe second part contained clues which it had been his hope\nthe Council would at once follow up and so discover the\nidentity of the sender of those anonymous parcels. This was\ndetective Avork, and so far as he had been informed they had\ntaken no steps in the matter.\nHe had detected what he thought was a slip in the criticism\nof his report in the Journal for January, 1924, where it was\nsuggested (p. 196) that the unknown person at the College\nmight have read the notice in the Journal for March, 1922,\nand known that the S.P.R. might be a good place to send the\nincriminating matter. The anonymous parcel was received on ith\nMarch, and the Journal usually came out later in the month.\nMr. Salter, dealing with Mr. Thomas' last point, said that\nthe Journal for March, 1922, came out between the 21st and\n27th of that month, that is after the first anonymous packet\nhad been sent and before the second. Mr. Dingwall had,\nhowever, long before Mr. Price's sitting, been trying to obtain\nsittings with Mr. Hope and Mrs. Deane, and this fact was well\nknown, so that the argument that the interest of the Society\nin spirit-photography was known at the College before the first\nanonymous packet was despatched was fully justified.\nThe discussion was continued by Mr. Piddington, who\nassured Mr. Thomas that the Council as a body had gone very\nfully into the case, and by Mr. Dingwall, who denied that\nthe breaking off of negotiations for sittings with the Crewe\nCircle was in any way due to the Price-Hope report ; while\nstill in America he had made persistent ei5orts to arrange for\nsittings with Mr. Hope, and had invariably been put off with\none excuse or another. He had been engaged for some time\nin going into reports of sittings with the Crewe Circle com-\nmunicated by Members and Associates, and hoped to print\ntwo or three cases at an early date.\ni\\Iiss ScATCHERD said she was glad to hear this, and affirmed\nher belief in the genuineness of Mr. Hope's powers.\niSee Jour. Jan. 1924.\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1924.\nSir Lawrence Jones, in closing the discussion, said that,\nquite apart from Mr. Price's report, suspicious facts regarding\nMr. Hope had been brought to the notice of himself and other\nMembers of Council. He would remind the meeting that\narguments as to the anonymous packets rested merely on\ninference. What was important was Mr. Price's direct testi-\nmony that he had marked the slide into which the plates\nwere put, and had found that the slide used for the exposure\nwas unmarked, and that he had seen Mr. Hope make a move-\nment apparently designed to cover the substitution of one\nshde for another. At their last Annual Meeting Mr. Price\nhad demonstrated the effectiveness of his method of marking.\nCONVERSAZIONE.\nA Conversazione was held for Members and Associates and\nfriends in the Society's Rooms at 31 Tavistock Square, London,\nW.C., on Thursday, February lith, 1924, at 4 p.m. Tea was\nprovided between 4 and 5 o'clock. The new Seance Room\nwas on view ; and later in the afternoon Sir William Barrett\nspoke of some of his experiences in psychical research, and\nMr. Dingwall gave an interesting account of his recent visits\nto Copenhagen and Paris, and of his sittings with the medium\nEiner Nielsen in Copenhagen and with Erto in Paris.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 165th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nSteinway Hall, Wigmore Street, London, W. 1, on Thursday,\nMarch 6th, 1924, at 5 p.m. ; The President in the chair.\nSir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., read a paper entitled \" Argu-\nments for and against Survival \" (a discussion between Pro-\nfessor Charles Richet and Sir Ohver Lodge, F.R.S. ), which\nwill be published later in the Proceedings.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR 1923.\nMembers of the Society will be aware that we have from time\nto time during the past year urged upon them the advantages\nthat would accrue if the Society possessed a special room\n\fMar., 1924. Annual Report of the Council. 229\ndevoted to experimental work and in particular to .seances\nwith mediums. We are glad to be able to report that this\nobject is now accomplished, mainly o\\viug to the generosity\nof an anonymous donor, a Member of the Society, who has\npresented us \\vith the sum of \u00a3510, a sum which covers the\nwhole cost of building the new room. We have in addition\nreceived donations from many other Members of the Society,\namounting to a considerable sum \u2014\u00a3100 each from two Members\nand nearly \u00a3190 in smaller donations\u2014which will provide a\nuseful fund towards the necessary equipment of the new room,\nthe cost of the work which we hope to carry out there, and\nother expenses. We take this opportunity of thanking all\nthose who have made special contributions to the Society's\nfunds during the past year, and we welcome the proof of con-\nfidence in the Society's future which these contributions afford.\nThe new seance room, which is built out on the ground\nfloor over the yard at the back of the Society's premises, will,\nit is expected, be shortly ready for use.\nHaving now the prospect of a suitable room for experi-\nmental work, we have entered into negotiation with several\nmediums, who provisionally have consented to submit them-\nselves to our investigation.\nWhile the work of the Research Department of the Society\nshows no strildng feature for 1923, much work has been\ndone and many minor experiments have taken place. On\nFebruary 23rd the Research Officer went to Gorefield, near\nWisbech, to make enquiries into the alleged poltergeist dis-\nturbances which were reported as occurring in the house of a\nlocal farmer. Much assistance was given in the case by the\nRev. J. H. Rutter, Vicar of Grorefield ; but the disturbances\nhad ceased when the Research Officer, Mr. Dingwall, arrived,\nand all that could be done was to obtain interviews with\nthe principal witnesses and compare the accounts received.\nIt appeared that the phenomena centred round the person\nof a young girl. No convincing evidence was obtained that\nthe occurrences were in any way supernormal ; but later\naccounts, received after Mr. Dingwall left the village, suggest-\ning that the child had been observed producing \" phenomena \"\nin a normal way were equally without real confirmation.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., W2i.\nDuring the early part of the }'ear the Society received\nsome reports concerning the phenomenon of glossolaly as\nobserved in the medimnship of Mrs. Olive S. Wright. Mr.\nDingwall attended a sitting with Mrs. Wright, and in ]\\Iay\na seance was at her request arranged at the rooms of the\nSociety. As Mrs. Wright desired that persons acquainted\nwith certain African languages said to be spoken by her\nwhilst in trance should be present at the sitting, some members\nof the School of Oriental Studies were invited. Several\nlinguists, including Professor Alice Werner, accepted ; and\ndictaphone records were taken of the voices. The reports\nwere to the effect that except for a few words the sounds\nwere unintelligible ; and no conversation was successful with\nthe \" communicators.\"\nIn the spring of 1923 arrangements were concluded between\nthe Research Committee and the representatives of Mr. Hope\nfor an early investigation by the Society of his claims as a\n\"spirit'\" photographer, and this was announced in the Journal\nfor May, 1923. Mr. Hope, however, as announced in the\nJournal for July, 1923, refused to accept the conditions agreed\nto by his representatives.\nWith regard to the Report on Mr. Harry Price's experiment\nwith Mr. Hope, printed in the Society's Journal for May, 1922,\nthe only new considerations submitted to us during the past\nyear were contained in a detailed criticism of the case by one\nof our members, the Rev. C. Drayton Thomas. This criticism\nwas carefully considered by the Research Committee, and an\nabstract by Mr. Drayton Thomas of his statement together\nwith a reply drawn up by the Research Committee is printed\nin a recent number of the Journal (Jan.. 1924). The\nconclusion to which the Research Committee came was that\nthe arguments put forward by Mr. Drayton Thomas did not\nin any material way affect the e\\ddence obtained by Mr.\nPrice.\nIt is a matter of regret to the Council that it has not so\nfar been possible to conduct any systematic investigation\nof the phenomena of Mr. Hope. We desire to call attention\nto the fact that Mr. H. W. Pugh's generous offer of a sub-\nstantial sum towards the expenses of such an investigation\n\fMai;., 1924. Annual Report of the Council. 231\nis still open, and to say that so far as concerns the Society\nwe should be glad to avail ourselves of it at any time.\nThe Research Officer has investigated and is still making\nenqmries into a number of cases of alleged psychic photo-\ngraphy submitted to the Society by various persons. Should\nthe general results be of sufficient interest a report \"will be\nissued. In one case the Society has been indebted to a\nmember for sending in at intervals during the year a fully\ndocmnented series of attempts at psychic photography in her\nhome circle. Certain of the results show markings not easily\nexplicable and it is hoped that the investigation will be con-\ntinued.\nDuring the year the Council placed a room at the disposal\nof Mr. Price and Dr. Woolley for the investigation of the\nphenomena observed with the medium known as ]\\Iiss Stella C.\nUnfortunately after the second sitting, at which incidents of\nsome interest took place, the investigation could not be con-\ntinued owing to the medimn having entered into employment\nwhich prevented her from devoting the necessary time to the\nwork.\nAs regards other physical phenomena a number of experi-\nments have been made under various conditions, mostly with\nprivate mediums. Through the kindness of an Associate a\nseries of sittings was carried on, chiefly at the rooms of the\nSociety, with a yoimg lady under her charge. The phenomena\nconsist mainly of raps and movements of objects apparently with-\nout contact. It is hoped that a further series of sittings\nwill be arranged.\nThe Warsaw Congress in August and September gave further\nopportunities for enquiry into physical phenomena occurring\n\\nth weU-known Continental medimns. The delegate of the\nSociety, jMr. Dingwall, had sittings with the Pohsh mediums,\nJan Guzik, Stanislaw Z , and .]. F . In the case of\nthe last named certain \" teleplastic formations were observed\nsimilar to those observed with Eva C. and Stanislawa P.\nWe hope to have further opportunities of investigating this\nmedium.\nThe Congress was held imder the auspices of the Polish\nNational Committee, in the premises of the University of\n\f1\n00\nCO\n,-1 rH\nO O O :^ ^ (M CI 20 cr.

It was attended not only by delegates from |\nSocieties interested in psycliical researcli but also by members\nof the public. Among those ])resent were Baron von Schrenck-\nNotzing, Dr. William Mackenzie, Mr. Fritz Grunewald, Dr.\nGustave Geley, Dr. Sydney Alrutz, Dr. Gardner Murphy, Dr.\nD. I. F. Brugmans. A number of papers were read and\nproposals discussed, a list of which has already been printed\nin the Journal. M. Ossowiecki, a non-professional clairvoyant,\nsubmitted to some experiments with certain members of the\nCongress and succeeded in describing correctly part of the\ncontents of an opaque envelope prepared by Mr. Dingwall.\nA good prima facie case appears to have been made out,\nand further investigation is eminently desirable.\nExperiments in thought-transference were carried on regularly\nduring the greater part of the year by Miss Newton and\nothers, at first with one percipient only (a member of the\nSociety who has shown indications in dreams of possessing\nsome telepathic faculty), and later with several percipients\ntogether. The object of the experiments was not so much to\nincrease the evidence for telepathy as to try to obtain the\nkind of evidence that may throw light on the conditions\nunder which telepathy is most likely to operate. Bearing in\nmind the generally inhibitory effect of anxiety, or of too much\nconscious attention, on the emergence of subconscious ideas in\nautomatic writing and other automatisms, the experimenters\naimed at eliminating this condition, and conducted the experi-\nments informally in the Secretary's room, increasing the number\nof percipients so that no one should feel specially responsible.\nThe experiments were varied to test certain suggestions arising\nfrom the pubhshed Cross-correspondences (for example, the\nquestion whether the existence in the percipient's mind of\nknowledge relating to the agent's idea may have any bearing\nupon thought-transference) ; and from Mr. Hubert Wales' report\nin Part 80, and from Mrs. Henry Sidgwick's Papers in Parts\n8() and 89 of Proceedings. The results so far, though promis-\ning, do not warrant definite conclusions. The experiments are\nbeing continued in the hope that from a large accumulation\nof results some light on the process and conditions of tele-\npathy may be derived. It is also hoped that by means of\n\fMak., 1'J24. Annual Beport of the Council. 235\nthese iufonnal experiments we may find among those of our\nmembers who are -wdlUng to take part in them some who\npossess distinct telepathic faculty, and that later a series of\nexperiments may be carried out under test conditions, with\nthe percipient, or percipients, in one room and the agent, or\nagents, in another. The new seance room and the adjoining\nroom be admirably suited for this purpose.\nA series of long-distance experiments in telepathy was con-\nducted from London vnih a member in Devonshire. There\nhas been one complete success, but as the circumstances\nbecame unfavourable the experiments have been temporarily\nsuspended.\nThe Council thank all who have taken part in the various\nexperiments, and would gladly welcome others who are wilUng\nto help in this way.\nWe are indebted to several of our members for reports\nof evidence obtained through sittings with mediums and in\nother ways. In particular the Kev. W. S. Irving has regularly\nsent us extracts from his notes of sittings with Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard, Mrs. Brittain and Mr. Vout Peters. The notes\nreceived from Mr. Irving and others include a number of\nstatements made by supposed communicators in regard to\ndifficulties which appear to arise in getting what they wish to\nsay correctly recorded. AVe hope that by collecting and\ncomparing a considerable number of such statements we may\nbe able to throw some fight on the modus operandi in medium-\nistic trance, a branch of research in which at present little\nhas been done. We shall be glad to receive any further\nrepoi'ts our members can send us.\nIn its Annual Report the Council has sometimes taken\noccasion to point out that the number of Members and Associ-\nates actively co-operating in the work of the Society, appeared\nundidy small. It is pleasing to be able this year to thank\nmembers for an unusual amount of help in various ways.\nReference has already been made above to some of this help,\nbut we may further refer to the fact that a good many\nmembers have brought to our Officers records of sittings\neither in their own private circles, or ^vith Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard and other known mediums. These records are often\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJi. Mau., 1924.\nof an exceedingly private and personal character and we are\ngrateful for the confidence shown in allowing our Officers to\nsee them. Other members have taken great trouble in re-\ncordiug experiences of their own or in reporting cases they\nhear of. E\\'idence thus received is printed in the Journal\nwhen it comes up to a sufficient evidential standard and when\nit is not too private. But what cannot be printed is not\ntherefore valueless. It can be of real use in giving our\nOfficers greater experience of and insight into the phenomena\nto be investigated, and in supporting or throwing light on\ncases whose veridicality can be made evidential. Moreover,\nexperiments and spontaneous experiences which begin with\nKttle clear evidence of the occurrence of anything supernormal\nsometimes develop into valuable cases.\nIn addition to help of this kind and in providing material\nfor investigation, Ave have, as already mentioned, received\nvery important assistance in money from Members and Associ-\nates, whieli \\Adll greatly facilitate our work and, as far as it\ngoes, enable us, without stinting this, to meet the expense of\nprinting, which is still very much higher than it used to be.\nAt the request of some of our members an English trans-\nlation has been published, and can be obtained from the\nSecretary, of Monsieur CamiUe Flammarion's Presidential\nAddress. The Address was read in English by Sir W. F.\nBarrett, F.R.S., at a Meeting of the Society in June last, and\nwas pubUshed in the Proceedings (Part LXXXIX.) in the original\nFrench. The Council take this opportunity of expressing their\nthanks to M.

Some account is given of the remarkable\nmaterialized animals and \" primitive men \" said to occur with\nthis medium. At one time the form was described as a bear's\ncub, but now Dr. Geley compares it with other animals, as\nfor example dogs, squirrels or cats. The same method of\ncontrol was adopted as that described upon a former occasion.\nThe sitters were chained wrist to wrist, but unfortunately the\n\f240 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. mar., 1924.\nmedium's legs were not automatically controlled, but left to\ntlie sitters to touch upon either side. Dr. Geley declares that\nthe medium remained absolutely motionless, and the complex\nmovements involved in producing phenomena by means of a\nfreed leg could not have been made without detection. More-\nover, objects appear to have been moved at a distance beyond\nthe normal reach of the medium. In the same issue Dr.\nGeley criticises the report of the Sorbonne Commission published\nin L'Opericon for December 21st. The Commission came to the\nunanimous conclusion that the phenomena produced by Guzik\nin their presence were entirely fraudulent, being due to the\nmedium's use of his legs, which he prevented his investigators\nfrom effectively controlling. When an automatic control of\nGuzik's legs was advised, all the phenomena ceased, a fact\nexplained away by Di. Geley as due to the medium's health.\nSince two sittings were given elsewhere at the same time as\nthe negative Sorbonne seance with excellent results, the objec-\ntion raised by Dr. Geley appears to be hardly valid, and a\nfurther solution must be found. The principal note in the\nSorbonne Commission's report is one of uncertainty. They re-\npeatedly insist upon the immense difficulties of controlling the\nmedium effectively, a fact which appears to have partially\nescaped the attention of the Institute in Paris.\nThe American Journal of Psychology for January has an interest-\ning discussion by Mr. Frank Angell of the horizon-illusion.\nMr. Angell briefly reviews the work hitherto done in this field,\nand his report testifies to the varied opinion as to the cause\nof the phenomenon. It would seem that such a widespread\nand universal illusion, if illusion it be, would be capable of\nan explanation, satisfactory in every detail. Yet so far from\nthis being the case, views are so diverse and the results of\nexperiments so confficting that the ordinary reader is left with\nthe impression that the cause of the illusion is still almost\nwholly obscure.

This book, which, as the\nnumber of editions shows, was widely read and appreciated,\nis dedicated to the memory of Richard Hodgson, and Mr.\nHackett has himself recorded that it was largely to his friend-\nship mth Hodgson that he owed the impulse which led to\nhis only essay in authorship.\nReviews of the book will be found in the Journal (Vol. XIX.,.\np. 143, and Vol. XXI.. p. 184). \" -\nMr. Hackett had been either resident in this country or\ntravelUng in Europe during the last years of his Ufe, and his\nkindly personality will be missed by those of us who had the\npleasure of meeting him at the Society's Rooms. We take tliis.\nopportimity of expressing our sympathy with Mrs. Hackett.\nSeverin Lauritzen.\nThe Society has also lost an old friend in the person of Mr.\nSeverin Lauritzen, of Copenhagen, who became an Associate\nof the Society in 1904 and a Corresponding Member in 1923.\nMr. Lauritzen contributed two cases to the Journal (Vols.\nXIV. and XV.) and on several occasions the Society has been\nindebted to him for information concerning occurrences of\npsychical interest in his part of the world.

S.\nCASE.\nL. 1253.\nWe have received from Mr. Charles W. Armstrong, an Associate\nof the Society, the following account of an incident which\noccurred in January 1923. The first report of the incident\nwas contained in a letter from Mr. Armstrong to the Editor,\nMrs. Salter, as follows :\nOctoher 29th, 1923.\nIn Dr. Schiller's report of communications received, through\nMrs. Piper by Mrs. Tarrant from her step-father, I noticed the\nfollowing words which are significant in connexion with an experi-\nence of my own :\n\" All the little ones will be cared for if you\nhave faith. When we see them in danger, we ourselves can interfere\nand prevent all hinds of cnlamity.\"\nIn January this year I was staying witli my wife and family\nin Petropolis, a beautiful health resort in the Organ Mountains\nnear Rio de Janeiro. On the evening of January 5th, after the\nchildren had gone to bed, my wife and I were dining at a small\ntable in a corner of the refeitorio of the small hotel in which\nwe were staying, and it so happened that our table was exactly\nunder the corner of our bedroom where some of the children were\nsleeping. While at dessert, we both heard a tapping just over\nour table ;\nmy wife thought it was done with the knuckles of\nthe hand on the floor above us, but to me it sounded more like\nthe tap of a shoe. In any case I attached no importance to it,\nbut my wife was inexplicably alarmed. She called to the servant\nof some other guests, who was standing near us in the doorway,\nand asked her where was Theresa, our nurse-girl. The woman\nreplied that Theresa was dining in the kitchen. Then my wife\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1924.\nleft the table hurriedly and ran upstairs. At first I had smiled\nat her evident alarm about a mere nothing, but when she had\ngone I felt the same alarm myself, and seemed to expect her\nmomentarily to call to me from the head of the stairs to come\nu-p^quicMy. However, she did not call, so I went up to see what\nwas the matter. To get at the bedroom one had to go through\nour private sitting-room, which, as indeed the whole upper floor,\nwas at that hour in darkness, for there was nobody upstairs at\nall, except the sleeping children. My wife had turned on the\nelectric light in the bedroom, and I found her very pale, with\ndrawn face and frightened look, leaning over the youngest child\nwho began to cry a moment after my entry. This child was\nnot yet one year old, and my wife told me she had found him\nsuspended by the neck alone, between two beds which the nurse\nshould have left toucliing each other, but had carelessly left\nslightly apart. The child's feet could not reach the floor as it\nhung suspended, and even if they could, as they were bare, they\ncould not possibly have tapped it. The smaller bed was the one\nagainst the wall, from which it was never removed. The other\nwas a large double bed, very heavy, which the baby's weight\ncould not possibly move in the slightest degree. The other\nchildren were all fast asleep, and nobody else was upstairs. The\nnurse had not been up for some time. The baby, therefore, had\nrolled over in his sleep, and fallen between the two beds, but as\nthey were too near each other to admit of the passage of his\nhead, he had remained hanging in that position, (the beds being\ntogether at the head but pidled apart at the foot). He had not\ncried, and had apparently lost consciousness. We found marks\non one side of his neck where the iron bedstead had caught him.\nThese marks were visible for some days. When our relief at\nhearing the child cry had somewhat subsided, we asked each\nother \" Who tapped ?\n\" To this question we could find no\nanswer, and nobody to whom I have recounted the incident has\nbeen able to find any but a supernormal answer that could fit\nin with all the facts.\nA few days after this I wrote to my mother in Liverpool,\nnarrating the strange occurrence, but without the sequel ; for it\nwas not until the end of the month of January that my wife\nreceived a letter from her home in Barcelona telling her of the\ndeath of her brother on December 30th. Two other brothers had\n\fApril, 1924. Case.\nalready come out to Brazil, and were and are still working in\nEio de Janeiro. The other was preparing to come and join them\nwhen his illness prevented him. Putting off his journey had been\na keen disappointment to him and he talked of little else, while\nill, than of going to Brazil. January the 5th was also the anni-\nversary of my father's death in 1905, but I think this is irrelevant.\nCharles W. Armstrong.\nI have read the above statement of our experience in Petropolis,\nand every incident mentioned I distinctly remember. It is in\nevery respect in strict accordance with the facts.\nEnrica Armstrong\n(Mrs. C. W. Armstrong).\nIn reply to this letter Mrs. Salter wrote to Mr. Armstrong\non November 7th, 1923, and put the following questions :\n(1) For how long was the tapping sound heard ?\n(2) Was the bed in which the child lay in that part of the\nroom which was immediately over the restaurant in\nwhich Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong were dining at the time,\nor was it far removed ?\n(3) Is there any evidence as to whether slight normal sounds\nin the bedroom would be easily audible in the restau-\nrant ?\n(4) Does it seem likely that the sounds could have been\nmade by the bed rocking and striking either the\nfloor or the wall of the room ?\nIn reply to this communication Mr. Armstrong wrote again\nto Mrs. Salter, as follows :\n. . . Replying to your questions, both my wife and I think it\nimpossible a rocking of the bed could have caused the tapping\nnoise we heard, because the sound did not suggest any such cause,\nand the bed, being steady, could not have produced any such\ntaps. The smaller bed was against the wall. It was a full\nsized iron bed-stead, and I only referred to it as small in com-\nparison with the other which was a double bed. There were\nthree or four taps in quick succession. If produced intentionally\nby a conscious intelligence, no further taps would be needed\nbecause my wife immediately left the table, and indeed was so\nalarmed already as to cause me much surprise. The very fact\n\f246 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1924.\nof her alarm being out of proportion to the apparent cause\nseems to me to demand explanation. She is not easily alarmed\nabout the children, and does not, as most mothers do, wake in\nthe night when they cry. The child's bed was over the corner\nof the dining-room in which our table was placed. Neither of\nus can remember hearing from below slight normal sounds. When\nthe children romped boisterously we heard, and once I remember\nsending to tell them to make less noise. We are both sure the\nsounds could not be caused by the bed knocking against the wall.\nOne other suggested cause I have heard when narrating the\nincident, has been that perhaps one of the other children made\nthe sounds. But the eldest was only five ; all were undressed\nand sound asleep in their respective beds. I verified too that the\nbreathing of all was regular and am certain none of them had\nleft their beds at all. Besides, they could not have got at that\ncorner of the room. The room, moreover, was in darkness and\nnone would get up in the dark.\nPersonally I am disinclined to believe in the presence here of\nthe spirits of the departed, but I am at a loss to find any other\nexplanation of this incident to fit in Avith all the facts. If I\nreject the spirit theory I find myself obliged to recognise some\nform of second sight or peculiar intuition to account for my\nwife's alarm at that moment ; and that leaves the tapping still\nunexplained. Charles W. Armstrong.\nIn reply to a further letter from Mrs. Salter, pointing out\nthat in the circumstances the supernormal nature of the\nsounds could not be considered as definitely established, and\nthat, if the case w^ere printed in the Society's Journal a note\nto this efJect would have to be included in the report, Mr.\nArmstrong wrote again to Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nDecember 31st, 1923.\nI have to thank you for your favour of 27th inst. I certainly\nhave no objection to the note you suggest.\nI quite see that from the point of view of the Society, the\nsupernormal cause of the sounds produced cannot be said to be\nconclusively proved, and probably, had the incident occurred to\nsomebody else, I should have been more sceptical on this point\nthan you are. As it is, I cannot help accepting jjersonally the\nsupernormal explanation of the sounds as well as the telepathic\n\fApril, 1924. Case. 247\nexplanation of my wife's alarm. But I should be inclined to\nthink of the telepathy as between the spirit of my wife's brother\nand herself and not between the baby and her. I may mention\nthat I was not and still am not a spiritualist, but am inclined\nto think that occasional communication occurs between the\nliving and the dead. Charles W. Armstrong.\nIt should be noted that, although I myself at first attached\nno importance to the knocking, and was surprised and even\namused at my wiie's alarm, that alarm very quickly came to me\ntoo, with no very evident reason, and I distinctly expected my\nwife to call to me to come up quickly. As she did not, I went\nupstairs, and I remember it was two steps at a time. C. W. A.\nAs Mr. Armstrong himself admits, the supernormal nature\n<ot the sounds heard by himself and his \"nnfe cannot be re-\ngarded as proved. Indeed, it would seem not unlikely that\nthe struggles of the child, as it hung between the beds, might\nby one means or another\u2014and for a short time\u2014produce\nsounds. This interpretation is at any rate so far possible\nthat from a scientific standpoint we are bound to accept it\non the general principle of preferring the known to the un-\nfmown cause. There remains, however, the question of the\n\u2022effect which these sounds\u2014presumably slight\u2014had on the\nmother in instantly arousing her alarm. The suggestion may\n:be put forward that they reinforced and defined in her con-\n:sciousness a vague impression, telepathically received, of her\nchild's danger. It has to be remembered that people are\nsometimes extraordinarily sensitive to sounds relating to\nmatters in which they have a keen personal interest, such as\nthe interest of a mother in her children. This sensitiveness\nmay be telepathic in origin or hyperaestlietic. Myers {Human\nPersonality, vol. ii., p. 517) suggests that \" hyperaesthesia . . .\nseems sometimes to pass gradually beyond the point which\nany sensory influence can be stretched to cover. . We must\nthen assume at least a minghng of some form of supernormal\nacquisition of knowledge ;\ntelepathy, if we have an agent's\nmind already possessed of such knowledge, telaesthesia, if no\nsuch, agent can be suggested.\"\n- A rather similar suggestion will be found in Prof. Gilbert\njMurray's Presidential Address [Proc. S.P.R. vol. xxix, p. 62).\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1924,\nGLASTONBURY ABBEY. \u2022\nlu regard to Dr. H. J. Wilkins's brocliure recently pub-\nlished, entitled A further Criticism of the Psychical Claims\nconcerning Glastonhurij Abbey and the Recent Excavations, a\ncopy of which, has been received by the Society, Mr. Bligh\nBond, whose work is the subject of criticism, asks us to publish\nthe foUomng statement. It must, of course, be understood\nthat the responsibiUty for this statement rests with Mr. Bhgh\nBond:\nFebruary 13th, 1924.\nA careful perusal of Revd. H. J. Wilkius's work will shew that\nthe basic arguments on which he seeks to vitiate my conclu-\nsions are :\n(1) That the length of the standing ruins is by generally ac-\ncepted tradition 510 feet (pp. 41, 73).\n(2) That the total length as originally existing, given by various\nauthorities as 580 or 581 feet, was an external measure.\n(3) That consequently the missing portion (Edgar Chapel) must\nbe the difference between these two measures, i.e. 70\nor 71 ft. only.\n(4) That since the rectangular part of the Edgar Chapel approxi-\nmates to 70 ft., this represents all there was, and the further\nextension marked with angular walls must be left entirely\nout of account as a part of the Abbey.\n(5) That the Elizabethan document which states that the length\nof the complete building was 594 feet, with a chapel at\nthe east of 90 feet, may be read as 574 feet, and 70'\nfeet, respectively, because at that time a 9 was written\nlike a 7. The original document being lost, Dr. Wilkins\nassumes this clerical error as probable.\nTo these points I reply as follows :\n(1) The generally accepted tradition of 510 feet is greatly in\nerror. Had Dr. Wilkins taken the trouble to obtain the\nactual measure of the standing ruins, he would have found\nthis to be so.\nAs a practical antiquary, not an armchair critic, I\nobtained a certificate of this true measure from an in-\ndependent surveyor, and it affirms that the total internal\n\fApkil, 1924. Glastonbury Abbey. 24&\nlength of the standing ruins is 493 ft. 6 ins., and the\nexterior or extreme length 502 ft. only. This more than\njustifies my estimate.\n(2) Assuming the traditional total of 580-581 ft. to be, as he\nwould have it, an over-all measure, this leaves a balance\nof 78 or 79 feet for the Edgar Chapel, which is an im-\npossible measure under either theory. But if the 580-581\nft. be taken as an internal measure, then the true exterior\nmeasure wUl be found by taking in the thickness of\nboth end walls and the projection of turrets at the west.\nThis will bring it well over 590 ft., and near the Eliza-\nbethan measure.\n(3) The true external measure of length of the standing ruins\nbeing 502 ft., and the further extension of my rectangular\nchapel being 66 ft. 6 ins., we should have only 568 ft.\n6 ins. over all, which is another absurdity.\n(4) This gives a balance still of 13 ft. to be accounted for, if,\nas Dr. Wilkins suggests, the total measure of the Sale\nPlan, i.e. 581 ft. 6 ins. is an external one. Dr. Wilkins\nmust meet this fact.\n(5) Dr. Wilkins is welcome to his opinion that the figures in\nthe Elizabethan document have been misread, but he\ncannot use such an assumption as a positive argument\nfor destroying my conclusions. The document being lost,\nhis theory is quite incapable of proof.\nGenerally it must be apparent that a man who claims that his\nknowledge is so complete on this subject that few if any facts\nhave escaped him (p. 85) would be expected by his readers to have\nascertained for himself the true length of the ruins instead of\nadopting merely reputed measures.

April, 1924.\nTvas a powerful medium, and that various phenomena occurred in\nhis presence. Having met him I asked him about it.\n\" Y \" admitted that various phenomena, chiefly apports, took\nplace in his presence, though he apparently did not consider him-\nself a \" medium \" in the strict sense of the word. He objected\nto that term being applied to him, because he was never en-\ntranced, while other sitters were, but thought himself a kind of\ntrumpet \" (his expression) for the concentration of various\ninfluences emanating from others\u2014the result being chiefly a^jjjoris\nin abundance, often coupled with\" direct \" writing.\nThe seances, it appears, began in the Crimea three or four years\nago ; then the Crimea had to be left on account of one of the\nBolshevist invasions. They were then continued in Rome, and\nlater in Berlin, some of the sitters, notably two B. brothers, being\nthe same as in the Crimea.\nI spent one evening at \" Y's,\" and was shown some of the\na^yports. Needless to say there was in these apports nothing\nsupernormal \" so far as their nature was concerned, though\nsome of them, it is true, had some pretension to be vaguely\ndemoniacal in origin ! And from the accounts given by \" Y\n\"\nas to the manner in which they appeared it became clear that\neverything or nearly everything depended not so much on \" Y \"\nhimself as on other members of the circle. In justice to \" Y it\nshould be mentioned, however, that he narrated to me two cases\nAvhere the phenomena happened when, as he stated, he was\nabsolutely alone : in one case direct writing, in the other ap>2^ort\nof direct writing.\nAs \" Y \" was giving at the time, more or less regularly, seances\nat Countess X's (a Russian lady) in Berlin, I asked for permission\nto attend one sitting.\nMy imjaression was altogether unfavourable. The seance took\nplace in total darkness.

Perovsky Petrovo Solovovo.\n\u00ab\nREVIEW.\nDas Ziveckgesetz in der Natur, Gnindlinien einer Meta-Mechanik des\nLebens. By Adolf Wagner. Eugen Eentsch, Erlenbach-\nZurich, Munich and Leipzig, 1923. Pp. 301.\nProfessor Wagner appears to be professor of Biology at the\nUniversity of Innsbruck, and his book is a very elaborate and\nacute, carefully and closely reasoned refutation of the mechanistic\ntheory of life. So far from admitting the application of be-\nha\\-iouristic materialism to psychology, he refuses to restrict biological\nscience to the physics and chemistry of living organisms, and\ninsists on the psychic guidance of all mechanical processes. He\njustly points out that in ultimate analysis the very notion of a\nmechanism as a contrivance implies a reference to a psychic factor,\nand that all the mechanisms we find in nature are subject to\npsychic control and demand psychic interpretation. This psychic\nfactor is conceived as entirely natural and its teleology as immanent.\nProfessor Wagner's conception comes out well in the following\npassage (p. 267) ; Wherever there is life, there is soul. Life is\npsychic activity. All life is psychic life. And the law which\ncontrols this peculiar activity is reason. . . . The riddle of\nlife consists in this that wherever life stirs, Avhether it be in the\ndrop of water, in the soil, or in the brain of a genius, there\nappears a naturally directed subordination of mechanical laws to\na superior law of reason.\"\nWe may agree that Professor Wagner's criticism is convincing,\nand unanswerably brings out the inadequacy of materialism.\nBut candour compels us to add that what he does (as has often\nbeen done before) is not enough to eradicate materialism. Its\nstrength does not lie in its doctrine, but in its method. Its\nmethod, whether or not at a particular time and in a particular\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1924.\ncase it succeeds, is always applicable. It can always be tried.\nIt always therefore will be tried, if no other tnethod can be\nsuggested. And it can be scientifically superseded only by another\nmethod which works better. Now the great weakness of vitalists\nand believers in the '\nsoul '\nhas too long been that they have\nconceived their principles as mere negations, and not as methods\nof discovery. They have feared to use them as principles of\nprediction and exploration, for the control of phenomena. Now a\n'\nsoul '\nthat does nothing is nothing. A mere unknown, and perhaps\nunknowable, something in the background is no explanation of\nanything. At present the '\nsoul ' is a mere confession of ignorance :\nit should be conceived as a field of exploration. If, therefore,\nthe psychic factor is a fact, it ought to lead to further facts.\nAnd if further facts are alleged, they must be examined, estab-\nlished, and extended, with the insatiable curiosity of scientific\nmethod. There is safety only in going on, not in taking one's\nstand upon any impregnable rock of '\nsomething that no mechanism\ncan account for.' This appears to be the essential difference\nbetween vitalism and psychical research. F. S. C. Schiller.\nNOTES ON PEEIODICALS.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nFebruary is almost wholly devoted to the reports recently pub-\nlished of sittings with Guzik. The Editor begins the discussion\nby examining rather superficially the evidence both for and against\nthe reality of Cxuzik's mediumship. He maintains that (as every-\none admits) there may be two Guziks ; one capable of producing\ngenuine phenomena and another capable of doing \" what he did\nat AVarsaw, when not under control, with a miscellaneous lot of\npeople in a parlour, who have paid a good fat sum to see some-\nthing.\" Accordingly Dr. Edwards concludes that \" where the\ncontrol was rigid, the phenomena are attested as genuine by many\nrespoiisible men. Where there was no control Mr. Price says\nthey were humbug ; at least, while he doesn't explicitly say so,\nthat's the inference.\" We presume that in coming to this strange\nconclusion Dr. Edwards has forgotten all about the Sorbonne\nReport on the same medium. When he says, \" where the control\nwas rigid, the phenomena are attested as genuine by many re-\nsponsible men,\" he means the men at the Institute and not the\nmen at the Sorbonne, who came to precisely the opposite con-\n\fApril, 1924. Notes on Periodicals. 255\nelusion. The great difference between the two reports is that at\nthe Institute the investigators thought they could control the\nmedium's feet and legs, and ^that at the Sorbonne they discovered\nthat they could do nothing of the kind, Guzik's motionless legs\nand feet being transformed into two very active and mobile\nmembers. Two luminous buttons attached to the toe of Guzik's\nstockings would have given some security, but the Institute\npreferred the control by touch. The Sorbonne, seeing the enormous\ndifficulties of the control, declared candidly their incompetence,\nand substituted an automatic control, whereat the phenomena\nceased absolutely, which was precisely what happened with minor\nvariations at Warsaw, where, although I could not institute an\nautomatic control, I was kept fully occupied in chasing an agile\nfoot, which finally gave up its efforts to escape, and silence reigned\nimtil the end of the sitting.\nFollowing the Editor's contribution to the problem comes a\ntranslation of part of Dr. Geley's report upon Guzik's sittings at\nthe Institute and at Warsaw. Then Mr. Price's impressions are\nprinted, in which he gives an amusing and accurate account of\nhis experiences at Warsaw with Guzik, which is valuable from\nthe point of view of one who wishes to see how phenomena\nreported as \" supernormal \" appear to one acquainted with nor-\nmal methods of producing them. Sir Oliver Lodge then con-\ntributes a short letter on the same subject, in which he says\nthat the conditions of the Institute were \" perfectly controlled\n\"\nand in this he is supported by Dr. Geley in a succeeding letter.\nThe discussion is wound up by Mr. Stanley de Brath who\nsupports the Institute in a short article.\nThe March issue of the Journal continues the discussion. Part\nof the Sorbonne report on Guzik is published, in which the in-\nvestigators declare their conviction that there is nothing mysterious\nin the phenomena they observed, for the \" medium produces\nthem, by using his elbow for certain contacts applied to the\nregion of the shoulder, [and] by freeing from control one of his\nlegs.\" Mr. de Brath again summarises the evidence which is so\nconflicting and has caused such bitter controversy. He has three\n\" explanations,\" they are :\n(1) That Guzik is one more case of mediums with genuine\npowers, who, exhausted by constant seances and greed\nof gain, descend to vulgar and stupid trickery.\n\f256 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1924.\nWe confess that the first explanation is unintelligible to ns.\nWhen at Warsaw Guzik was giving four or five seances a day\nyet the phenomena were pronounced magnificent except by certain\nBritish and Swedish investigators. It is certainly singularly\nunfortunate that when Guzik arrived at the Sorbonne he should\nhave been exhausted and greedy for gain, when outside in other\nParisian circles at the same time the phenomena were convincing\nother inquirers. Mr. de Brath's second \" explanation \"'\nis that\n:\n(2) He is acting under the mental suggestion of a highly sceptical\npsychic atmosphere created by the strong annoyance and\ndisgust of the sitters.\nThis theory need not be considered, as Mr. de Brath has yet to\nprove that the distinguished members of the Sorbonne Commission\nwere filled with annoyance and disgust before the alleged trickery\nwas discovered. The next theory is that the phenomena may just\npossibly be referred to unseen operators playing poltergeist tricks\non the sitters, in regard to which explanation Mr. de Brath\nappears to be somewhat confused between supernormal poltergeist\nphenomena, pseudo-poltergeist phenomena, and poltergeist con-\ntrolling entities, whatever they may be supposed to be.\nThe Revue Metapsychique for January-February contains a\nreply by Professor Richet to Dr. A Delmas upon the subject of\nsupernormal phenomena and also a highly interesting paper by\nProfessor Hans Driesch on the relation of vitalism to psychic\nmanifestations. Dr. Neumann contributes an article supporting\nthe claims of the medium Guzik, but we are not aware that the\nauthor has devised any better scheme of control than that used\nby his predecessors. Dr. Geley contributes also a portion of his\nforthcoming book, Teleplasm and Clairvoyance, entitled Intro-\nduction a I'etude pratique de la mediumnite.\nPsychische Studien for February has two articles by Dr. von\nSchrenck-Notzing ; the first on German philosophy of the nine-\nteenth century and the second on the Laszlo scandal at Budapest.'-\nGeneral Peter has reprinted part of Mr. Price's report upon the\nmediumship of Miss Stella C, and Dr. Tischner has a short paper\non occultism in relation to materialism and mysticism.\nThe March issue of the same journal has a further account of\nthe Laszlo exposure in Hungary ; a paper by Zimmer on tele-\nplasm and possible analogies as seen in the chrysalis, and an\naccount of the exposure of Rudi Schneider at Vienna.

Dingwall.\nThe following experiment mth the medium Ossowiecki took\nplace at Warsaw during the Second Congress in the autumn of\n1923. Prior to leaving for Poland I had prepared a test for\nthis medium on August 22, 1923. No one was present at the\noperation and no one was informed what I had written and\ndrawn upon the paper within the envelopes. The paper measured\napproximately 17-5 cm. by 11 cm. The following words were\nwritten at the top of the paper before placing it within the\nfirst envelope :\n\" Les vignobles du Rhin, de la Moselle et de\nla Bourgogne donnent un vin excellent.\" On the lower half I\ndrew an exceedingly rough design which was meant to convey\nthe idea of a bottle without actually being a picture of one\n(Fig. 1). This I enclosed within three lines, the fourth being\nsupplied by the left hand edge of the paper. Near the bottom\nright hand corner I then wrote [Aug. 22, 1923]. The slip of\npaper was then folded with the writing outwards and placed\nin an opaque red paper envelope, the external measurements\nof which were about 11 '5 cm. by 9 cm. The slip was placed\nso that the writing was facing the plain side of the envelope\nand the drawing the flap side. The flap being left unsealed.\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1924.\nthis red envelope was then inserted flap end first into an\nopaque dull black envelope, into which it fitted closely. This\nenvelope, again unsealed, was then inserted flap end first into\na brown paper envelope, into which it again fitted closely.\nThe flap of this envelope was then pasted down and a single\nseal affixed to the lowest part of the flap where it adhered\nto the envelope. Four pinholes were then pricked at the four\nFig. 1.\ncorners of the envelope, and the packet put away until taken\nto Warsaw. There it was left either locked up in my suit-case\nor carried inside the breast pocket of my jacket inside my\npassport.\nTowards 1.15 p.m. on August 30, 1923, I met Baron von\nSchrenck-Notzing outside the University of Warsaw. He told\nme that as there might be a sitting with Ossowiecki that\nevening it would be advisable to present a sealed letter if I\nhad one ready prepared. In that case he would himself take\nit to the seance at which I should not assist, it being thought\nthat through some telepathic process the medium might gain\nknowledge of the contents of the packet by reading my mind.\nThe sitting took place in Ossowiecki's flat in Warsaw the\nsame evening at 9 p.m. Three documents had been prepared :\ntwo were made up at the Hotel de I'Europe the same evening,\nand the third was my own brought by Baron von Schrenck.\n(The account which follows is partly derived from that pub-\n\fMay, 1924. An Experivient with the Polish Medium. 261\nlished in the Revue Metapsychique (Sept.-Oct. 1923, 317-320)\nby Dr. Geley, who, with M. Sudre, Mme. Ossowiecki and Professor\nA. Vehab and Baron von Schrenck-Notzing were present at the\nsitting.)\nM. Ossowiecki took the three letters and, turning them over\nin his hands, selected the one in the brown envelope brought\nby Baron von Schrenck-Notzing and prepared by myself. The\ntwo other envelopes were white.\nThe medium then began to concentrate, tightly holding\nthe packet in his hands and walldng about but without leaving\nthe sight of the observers. Speaking in short phrases with\nlong pauses between each sentence, Dr. Geley was able to note\ndown what he was saying, which was as follows :\n\" I feel the restaurant . . . the Hotel de TEurope ... it is not\nyou (designating Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing) who have written.\nIt is another man that I might be able to describe .... The\nletter that I am holding has several envelopes ... It is a letter\nand yet it is not a letter ... I see something greenish, in card-\nboard {en carton) . . . They are the other letters [i.e. the two in\nthe white envelopes] which have come from the Hotel de I'Europe.\n. . . I see a stranger of from 34 to 35 years of age. He is\nFig. 2.\n\f262 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1924.\nspeaking a little and is a trifle stout. You have spoken with\nhim ... The letter that I am holding has been prepared for\nme . . . I cannot understand ... I see red .. . something red\ncolours ... a lady on one side . . . [Long pause.] I do not\nknow why I see a little bottle ... you have a very fine study\n;\nmany old pictures ;\nchairs upholstered in leather, with much wood\nin the room ... the study is a little dark ... It is not the\nman that I have just seen, the stout one, who has written the\nletter that I am holding. . . There is a drawing made by a\nman who is not an artist . . . something red with this bottle .\nThere is without any doubt a second red envelope . . . There\nis a square drawn at the corner of the paper. The bottle is very\nbadly drawn. I see it! I see it! (He draws: Fig. 2.) I see\nit\n!\nI see it !\nat the corner on the other side. In the middle\nsomething also is written, on the back ...\"\nAt this juncture the company were asked to come into the\ndining-room for refreshments. The medium, still holding the\nenvelope, stains it slightly whilst eating a sardine. He con-\ntinues to speak :\n\" I see a man who resembles Mr. Vett. It is he who has\nwritten for me one of the two white letters. One of the two is\nfrom him. The other is the stout gentleman whom I have already\ndescribed.\"\nDr. von Schrenck-Notzing then took the opportunity of\ninforming those present that this was correct. One of the\nletters was prepared by Mr. Vett and the other by Mr. Neu-\nmann, who is short and rather stout. The medium then\ncontinued :\n\"There is something else: something white and in the middle\n... I see before the year, there is a date or the name of the\ntown ... It is rather a feminine than a masculine hand.\" Dr.\nvon Schrenck then inquired in what language was it written?\n\" In French,\" M. Ossowiecki replied and he added, \"\nThe bottle\nis a little inclined to one side. It has no cork. It is made up\nof several fine lines. There is first a brown envelope outside;\nthen a greenish envelope, and then a red envelope. Inside, a piece\nof white paper folded in two with the drawing inside.' It is\nwritten on a single sheet.\"\n\fMat, 1924. Atl Experiment with the Polish Medium. 263\nThe following day I opened the packet at a meeting of the\nCongress and explained certain of the precautions which I had\ntaken against tampering. The envelopes appeared to be wholly\nintact and no evidence whatever was discernible that the\npacket had been opened. I had no doubt that the test was\nvalid and that the knowledge of the contents had been ascer-\ntained by M. Ossowiecki through channels not generally recog-\nnised. The opening of the packet created a sensation. M.\nOssoAviecki received an ovation and fell on the necks of the\nobservers with tears in his eyes.\nIn discussing this case it is necessary to bear in mind that\nthe result of the experiment showed, I think, quite definitely\nthat coincidence can be wholly excluded. Either the know-\nledge was obtained in a normal manner or it was not. In\norder to discover the contents normally it would have been\nnecessary to gain possession of the packet, open it skilfully,\nand mth much laborious care reseal it after having discovered\nthe tests and devised the best methods to be used in circum-\nventing them. Now the packet was in my possession at\nWarsaw from the day that I arrived (9.15 a.m., Monday,\nAugust 27) until it was given to Dr. von Schrenck-Notzing\non August 30 at about 1.15 p.m. To obtain possession of\nit would have meant (\u00ab) Having a duplicate key made to\nmy suit-case or opening it in some other manner, or (6) ob-\ntaining possession of it from Dr. von Schrenck. Since it was on\nDr. von Schrenck's person, this appears to me to be im-\npossible and need not be considered. Now, as the sitting was\nheld in the light and the packet was visible in the medium's\nhand during the reading, the knowledge, if gained normally,\nmust have been so gained before the sitting, and this, as I\nhave tried to show above, involves insuperable difficulties.\nThis, together with other excellent evidence of the same faculty\nin Ossowiecki and other mediums, leaves us but Uttle choice\nas to the proper interpretation to be put upon the experiment.\nThe supernormal character of the incident seems to me quite\nclear and decisive.\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1924.\nBRAIN AND SPEECH.i\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nIn Nature for April 5th, 1924, there is an account by Dr.\nTudor Jones of work done by Dr. Henry Head on Aphasia.\nIt seems that Dr. Head, the eminent neurologist, has had\nplenty of opportunity of studying the residual mental power,\nor rather that part of the residual mental power which can\nbe demonstrated in speech and writing, possessed by soldiers\nwho have had their brain injured in the war.\nWhereas usually aphasic patients are old people with many\ndisabilities\u2014arterial degeneration, diminished intellectual capacity,\nand possibly mental depression\u2014these patients were extremely\nintelUgent, wilKng and anxious to be examined thoroughly, and\nwere not at all depressed. Nevertheless, they were quite unable\nto bethink themselves of simple names. They generally got\nround them by roundabout phrases. By \"names,\" I mean not\nthe meaningless \" Proper names \" of persons, but the perhaps\nequally meaningless though more familiar names for such\nthings as colours, days of the week, places, pieces of furniture,\nand such like. For instance, to take one singular though\napparently typical case, obtained while testing for colours\nwhich nevertheless they w^ere able to distinguish and match\u2014\nmstead of the name \"black,\" the idea was conveyed, not by\nthat famihar w^ord, but by the roundabout idea, \"what you\ndo for the dead.\" So that the word \"dead\" tended to be\nemployed instead of black.\nSimilarly it was difficult to tell the time by a clock; and\nthough the patients might be punctual for appointments, they\nwould specify time as \" when w^e went there,\" or \" when we\nwere doing so-and-so.\" Which reminds one of Phinuit's\nspecification of Monday as \"the first after Sabbath.\" In fact,\nthe whole phenomenon seems closely related to what may be\ncalled the aphasia of mediums under control. I have con-\nstantly noticed that roundabout phrases are employed. Instead\nof sajdng \"Shut the door,\" Phinuit would say \"Close that\nopening ! \"\u2014with a momentary hesitation before the word\n' Read at a Private Meeting of the Society on April 7th, 1924.\n\fMay, 1924. Brain and Speech. 265\n\" opening\/' which if indicated by a printed dash would convey\na wrong impression ! <\nAgain, in recent time, with another medium, though the\nword \" France \" is often used, Paris itself is never mentioned,\nthough that is what was intended. Not only names and\naddresses, but even places, are seldom or not often spon-\ntaneously mentioned. Some phrase hke \" where we went to,\"\nand other circumlocutions are employed ; and the same for\nthings in the room\u2014\" that object,\" for instance, instead of\n\" that table,\" or \" that work-box,\" as if they were not clear\nwhat the object was.\nWhen a name is suggested, says Dr. Head, virtually, it is\nat once understood ;\nthey know the thing corresponding to\nthe name when the name is spoken, but they cannot apparently\nbethink themselves of the name.\n\" Many patients who cannot name objects can choose them to\noral as well as printed command. '\nOnce the word has been\npresented to the patient, it calls up an image which corresponds\nto some object before him '\n; but he cannot himself reproduce the\nappropriate symbol on demand.\"\nHow like this is to the aphasia of mediums, and indeed some-\ntimes to our own, many can testify. .\nThis kind of aphasia is often attributed to a mental con-\nfusion of the communicator under unusual conditions ; and\noccasionally there may be that confusion. But usually I\nthink the difficulty is not due to mental confusion at all, but\nto a lack of adequate control of the mechanism ; so that\nthere is a block at some junction on the way to the speech-\ncentres, an obstruction which has to be got round by some\nindirect path.\nInitials seem more easily given than names, and there is\na tendency even with well-known and frequently repeated\nnames to employ initials, or some other description. For\ninstance, Richet is usually spoken of as \" C.R.\" But the\ncontrol called John King goes further, and humorously calls\nhim \" Mule-eel,\" because on an early occasion, in Professor\nRichet's presence, when referring to Richet's attitude to sur-\nvival, stigmatising the obstinacy with which he clung to his\nmaterialistic views and the slipperiness with which he evaded\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1924.\narguments against them, John King said; \" I Uke your attitude,\nthough you are part mule and the rest eel, still I like you.\"\nMonths later, when John King was again intending to refer to\nRichet, in his absence, he expected us to understand and\ninterpret the nickname \" mule-eel.\"\n1 might with a little trouble make a collection of these\ncircumlocutions, of which the last is not a good example,\nsince it is only a nickname. Circumlocutions have occurred\nmore or less through all mediums ; and in taking notes, one\nis tempted sometimes, when one guesses perfectly well what\nthe meaning is, to abbreviate and write, not what they say,\nbut what they mean. But from the scientific point of view\nthis would be very wrong, since it would throw no light on\nthe process ; and I hope I have always avoided that tempta-\ntion. When the sentence is sjkU out, instead of being volubly\nspoken, there is no difficulty in getting down the exact\nphraseology. And one notices that although the spelling- out\nmust, one would think, be laborious, and takes a little time,\nyet often, even when using that method, a rather long-winded\nphrase is employed.\nFor instance, to take an- imaginary example, merely by way\nof illustration, I can imagine their saying \" that place where\nfamous people are buried,\" instead of Westminster Abbey.\nAnd Phinuit, speaking on a Friday, would certainly have said,\n\" The third after second Sabbath,\" when he meant Wednesday\nweek ; thus avoiding even the word \" day.\"\nIn his lifetime F. W. H. Myers was rather impatient of\nthese circumlocutions. He thought that by taking adequate\ntrouble, communicators might avoid these indefinitenesses and\nuse conipacter and more ordinary phraseology, such as \" the\nday before yesterday,\" or \" the day after to-morrow,\" \" this\n\u2022day fortnight \" ; or even \" the 21st of April,\" and have done\nwith it. The indications have always been that they knew\nperfectly well what they meant, and were able to convey it,\nbut that they could not easily use the compact forms of\nexpressions to which we have grown accustomed ; so that we\nsometimes forget how compact and convenient they are.\nNow that he is on the other side, Myers acts up to his\n<Jontention, and, whether troublesome or not, manages to\n\fMay, 1924. Brain and Speech. 267\nspecify things for the most part in the ordinary way, especially\nthrough a very definite spelling medium, a Miss Yam. And\napparently he has got John King and some others to do the\nsame. So that now when they make an appointment for\nanother sitting, they say : \"I will meet you again on Friday\nthe 26th of May at nine o'clock ; don't be late.\" And Avhen\nwe have time to look into the diary, we find that the 26th\nreally is a Friday. It seems as if they had taken the trouble\nto looks things up, and specify them, just as they would have\ndone when here.\nAgain, during a sitting, with this definite and business-like\namateur medium, a communicator may stop and say, \" I must\ngo now, but I will return at eleven,\" lea\\'ing someone else\nto talk meanwhile. And at eleven they usually do return.\nThis part of my statement seems in contradiction of what\nwent before. What it shows is that definite statements can be\nmade, even when using an alien brain, but probably only by\npreparation and arrangement. In any spontaneous utterance,\nand through vaguer mediums, these definite communicators are\nalmost as likely to use roundabout phrases as other people\n;\nor if they want some particular name about which they feel\na difficulty, they say, \" I cannot give it you now, but I will\ngive it you later.\"\nMany people have thought that this difficulty about names,\nand the hedging when anything definite has to be uttered, as\nfor instance in reply to a sudden question, is a sign not\nof mental confusion, but of some kind of fishing and fraud.\nI believe that in most cases that is a great mistake, and that\nwe should accept the fact that there is a difficulty, and should\ntry to reaUse wherein the difficulty consists. The patho-\nlogical work of Dr. Head, undertaken and carried out without\nthe least reference to our subject, seems likely to throw light\nupon it. Dr. Head says that \" general intelligence \" is not\nprimarily affected by a brain-lesion. The fault is not in the\nintelHgence but in the physical demonstration or manifestation\nof it. I would emphasise that statement as an important one.\nNevertheless (he says) :\n\u2014\n\" A man who in general conversation is unable to express his\nthoughts or comprehend the full significance of words and phrases\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1924.\nappears more stupid than others. His isolation from the sources\nof mental life diminishes his field of thought, and thus many\naphasics gradually deteriorate. But '\ngeneral intelligence '\n(the\nexistence of which Hughlings Jackson denied) is not primarily\naffected. Behaviour suffers specifically. What cannot be done in\none way can be done in another.\"\nAgain he says :\n\u2014\n\" When a uni-lateral lesion of the brain disturbs the use of\nlanguage, any act of mental expression which demands symbolic\nformulation tends to be defective, and the higher its propositional\nvalue the greater difficulty will it present. Any modification of\nthe task which lessens the necessity for symbolic representation\nwill render its performance easier.\"\nThe fact is that all words are conventions, not only proper\nnames. As Elliot Smith has pointed out :\n\u2014\n\" Man's immediate ancestors possessed high powers of dis-\ncrimination before man developed speech and invented his symbol-\nisms to register differences (relations) apparent to him. Like\nspeech, this is a cortical function but earlier acquired. A\npatient with his eyes closed may be able to point to the position\nof various objects in some familiar room with regard to himself,\nalthough he cannot formulate their relation to one another.\"\nAnd Dr. Head, in contending against the idea of speech-\ncentres in the brain where words originate, regards such\napparent centres as negative, not positive :\n\u2014\n\" The processes which underlie an act of speech run through\nthe nervous system like a prairie fire from bush to bush ; remove\nall inflammable material at any one point and the fire stops.\"\nIt is noteworthy that Professor Bergson also regards the func-\ntion of the brain as inhibitory, or negative, rather than positive\n\u2014a screen rather than a glow. \"What you forget with,\" as an\nexamination candidate said. It protects us from a wilderness or\ncomplexity of thought by blocking all avenues but one, and\nsometimes blocking that. Anatomical sites in the brain are not\nfunctional parts from which words spring ready formed. There\nare no centres for spealdng, reading, writing, or the normal use\nof language. Such apparent centres are merely places where the\nnormal stream of nerve activity may be interrupted, with results\n\f3Hay, 1924. Brain and Speech 269\nwhich may or may not be characteristic. There is nothing charac-\nteristic in our purely hnguistic terms. Dr. Head is said to have\ngiven a death-blow to the classical theory of aphasia, and thrown\nthe whole conception of \" centres \" into the melting-pot.\nWords, if used, are appUed correctly by an aphasic patient.\n'The significance of words is retained, but it is easier to deal\nwith pictures. The comprehension of the meaning of words is\nalways in excess of their use. The order of terms in a simple\nphrase is sometimes reversed, and pictures are often read from\nright to left. (This, too, is often done by mediums, 27 for 72 for\ninstance.) There is usually an inability to name things, which\nis more marked when the things themselves are abstract.\nEelations cannot be identified by appropriate word labels. An\n.aphasic patient does not forget people or places ;\nhe can recall\nspontaneously events both recent and remote, but he may not\nbe able to put them into words.\nNow all this has evidently a close analogy with iiiediumistic\ndisabihties. And really it is very much what one ought to\nexpect, on the view that a full and competent intelUgence is\ntrying to use a borrowed brain-mechanism not completely\nunder control, and finding obstruction along what would seem\nto be quite simple and customary channels.\nFatigue induces in normal people something of the same\n\u2022characteristic. When tired, it is much more difficult to re-\nmember names or to speak a foreign language. And it seems\nto me very important that it should now have been dis-\ncovered that lesions of the brain, such as occur in war, only\ninterfere with the mechanism, and do not destroy what Dr.\nHead calls \" the general intelUgence.\"\nThat is exactly the contention of those (myself being one)\nwho hold that the brain is merely an instrument, and that\nimperfection in the instrument need imply no corresponding\nimperfection in the operator.\n,\n'\nCASE.\nL. 1254 A Book-Test.\nWe have received from Mr. J.

Sir OUver Lodge, has given a lucid\nexposition of the essential features of the sj^iritist hypothesis\napart from its too common crudities.^ I am sure that he will\nforgive me if. after having read and meditated upon his\narticle, I am unable to share his opinions. Taken as a whole\nthe facts\u2014whether they be called spiritualist or metapsychic\n\u2014\nare true, authentic and indisputable. Doubtless there are\namong them errors, illusions and frauds, but there is a residue\nof undeniable phenomena before which all authority, however\nwell-estabhshed, must bow.\nFor those who hold the spiritist hypothesis the explanation\nis relatively simple\u2014personality is not extinguished by the\ndeath of the brain ; George Pelham's consciousness reappears\nwhen Mrs. Piper speaks in his name ; that of Raymond Lodge\nappears through Mrs. Leonard and Feda : that of Myers when\nMrs. Verrall writes.\nThe hypothesis is bold and clearly defined. It is supported\nby some very remarkable semblances which may be briefly\nsummed up by saying that the words of George Pelham,\niSee Proc. S.F.J!. Vol. XXXIV. p. 113 ff.\n\fJune, 1924. MetapsycMc Science and Survival. 275\nRaymond Lodge and Frederic Myers are such as they would\nhave uttered if they were hving among us. The intimately\npersonal memories, the highly charasteristic phraseology, con-\nstitutes so coherent a whole that the simplest hypothesis is\nthat of the survival of the personahty.\nIt is here to be understood that I pass over all the innumer-\nable trivialities, often crude and absurd, which are attributed\nby the medium to the spirits of the dead. For reasonable\ndiscussion it is but seemly to set aside these foolish utterances\nand to consider only vaUd instances in which the spirit supposed\nto be speaking through the medium reveals particular facts\nknown only to the deceased. Such cases exist ;\nthey are not\nnumerous, they are indeed extremely rare. But their frequency\nis of little consequence. It would suffice that there be some\nduly verified cases to warrant the hjnpothesis of survival. I\nsay to ivarrant, I do not say to justify, for other explanations\nthan survival seem to me possible or even probable ; and it\nis at this point I find myself unable to concm\" with Sir OUver\nLodge.\nMoreover, since the very nmnerous cases detailed in the work\nof my very good friend Dr. Osty, it is obvious that sensitives\ncan revive memories, knowledge, and events equally unknown\nto the percipient and to the questioner.\nI can add notiling to the opinions that I have pubUshed\nin my Treatise on Metapsychics. A perusal of that book will\nmake my intentions clear. I endeavoured to write on science,\nnot on dreams ; and I therefore confined myself to a state-\nment of facts and discussion of their actuaUty, not only with-\nout advancing any theory, but scarcely mentioning theories.\nFacts are permanent, and for them I have profound respect,\nbut theories change from year to year or even from day to\nday.\nAs for the explanation of the metapsychic facts on which\nmany men of science are still sceptical, I can only say definitely\nthat I believe in the hypothesis, now unknown, which the\nfuture -will estabhsh\u2014a hypothesis that I cannot formulate,\nfor it is unknown to me.\nAmong all these perplexing phenomena there is one that is\nmore perplexing than any others\u2014Prevision. It is established\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1924.\nby proofs that are absolutely certain, but it remains totally\nincomprehensible.\nThere are also a few cases, rare no doubt, but of an\nimportance that I do not disguise\u2014in which there are, or seem\nto be, intelligent and reasoned intentions, forces, and acts of\nwill apparent in the phenomena produced, and these have all\nthe characteristics of being due to extraneous action. I allude\nmore especially to the visions of young children when dying.\nThese facts would be exceedingly curious and noteworthy if\nthey stood alone, but they do not stand alone. I have mentioned\ntwo precisely similar ; and their similarity, or rather their\nidentity, is so definite that it is impossible to admit chance\nor imaginative fancy as their cause. Such facts are highly\nimportant. They are much more exphcable by the spirit-\nhjrpothesis than by that of cryptaesthesia. It even seems to\nme that among all the facts adduced to prove survival, these\nare the most disconcerting ; I have therefore been scrupulous\nto mention them. Nevertheless despite their spiritoid appear-\nance these facts are not sufficient to make me infer that the\nconsciousness of deceased persons appears as a phantom at\nthe death of a relative.\nSir Ohver reproaches me with an obsession on the subject\nof the brain\u2014that I consider cerebral integrity essential to\nhuman conditions. That other intelhgences under othei? con-\nditions than those of our animal organisation in terrestrial life,\nmay exist in nature, is possible or even probable ; but they\nivill be no longer human intelligences.\nMaeterhnck has expressed this admirably\n\u2014\" This '\nI,' so\nuncertain, so fugitive, and so precarious, evading all definition,\nis so entirely the centre of our being, and interests us so\nexclusively, that all the reahties of life fade when confronted\nwith that phantasm. If remembrance of certain facts, nearly\nalways trivial, does not accompany us ... it is nothing to me\nthat the highest, free-est and noblest parts of my mind should\nshine, living and eternal, in supreme bUss ;\nthey are not me ;\nI do not know them. Death has severed the links of nerves,\nor the memories that bound them to that unknown central\npoint at which I feel myself complete.\"\nThis does not signify negation of any intelhgent energies\n\fJune, 1924. Metapsychic Science and Survival. 277\napart from a brain ; but such hypothetical inteUigent forces,\nindependent of a material substratum, have nothing in common\nwith human intelligence. We may well suppose at the outset\nthat intelhgent beings other than men are about us and may\nbe associated with our evolution, although they may be free\nfrom the mechanical, physical, anatomical and chemical con-\nditions under which we Uve.\nWhy shordd not intelhgent and powerful beings exist apart\nfrom the worlds of which our senses inform us ? By what\nright can our Hmited senses, our defective intelligence, warrant\nus after a bare three centuries of scientific thought, in affirm-\ning that in the immense Cosmos Man is the only intelhgent\nbeing, and that all intellectual reaUty necessarily imphes nerve-\ncells nourished by oxygenated blood ? That there should be\nintelhgent energies other than man, constructed on a wholly\ndifferent plan, is not only possible, it is extremely probable.\nTt is absurd to suppose that ours is the only intelhgence in\nNature ; and that every inteUigent energy is necessarily\norganised on the animal or human mode, with a brain as its\norgan. It is immediately obvious how deep the mystery is\n:\nfor, when we speak of '\nintelhgence ' our inevitably anthro-\npomorphic conception of things leads us to suppose that such\nintelhgences must have human memory, a verbal terminology,\nlogic, and afiectivity hke our own. But intelhgence (in the\nhuman sense) is so imperfect, so speciahsed in himianity, that\nwe can only appreciate intelhgent energies by assimilating\nthem more or less to those of mankind : which is probably\na grave mistake.\nEven the spirit-hypothesis, stripped of its simpler concepts,\nwould, up to a certain point, be compatible with these con-\nclusions. According to some well-informed spirituahsts, the\n\" Spirits \" do not use words to express their thought ;\nthey\nact by projecting ideas or symbols which the medium sub-\nconsciously translates into human language. Their alleged\ncommunications assert the impossibility of expressing their\nenvironment in terms of Space and Time. That is to say\nthese \" spirits \" are no longer imder human conditions. That\nthe consciousness of the hberated Self shoidd retain love for\nits kin, may pass as a reason for attempting commimication.\n\f278 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. June, 1924.\nBut these are somewhat mystical speculations. I stand on\nfacts alone, and I take no pleasure in polemics. I do not\nseek to persuade journalists, nor even to convince my colleagues\nin science, but I am entirely set on proving facts to myself.\nI will let discussions and arguments 'pro and con follow their\ncourse. 1 have no desire to proselytise\u2014my own convictions\nare sufficient for myself. The important thing is to define the\nconditions under which the facts can manifest ; to found them\non soHd ground ; and (which is the supreme purpose of science)\nto estabhsh new truths which will certainly open new horizons,\ninstead of keeping fruitlessly in the old rut and the old track.\nTherefore until some approach to proof comes before me,\nI shall consider the spirituaUst theory as a ivorking-hypothesis,\nmoderately probable, convenient, and perhaps of use for the\nstudy of the phenomena. That is all.\nSir Oliver thinks that theory true ; I think it neither\ndemonstrated nor even proveable. But that ^vill not prevent\neither of us from trpng the same experiments, for neither he\nnor I make experiments to support or disprove any theory.\nWe observe and experiment in order to know and understand.\nWhither that research will lead us we cannot either of us\nguess ; but what we are fully convinced of is that we shall\naccept positively established results, for both of us are ready\nto adopt, integrally and resolutely, whatever may be con-\nformable with experimental truth.\nTHE CASE OF THE MEDIUM PASQUALE ERTO\nThe work of the medium Erto was first described in some\ndetail in the Revue Metaj)sychiqve for Nov.-Dec, 1922, pp.\n354-365. Dr. Sanguineti of the neuropsychiatric chnic of the\nUniversity of Naples and Dr. William Mackenzie of Genoa\ncontributed two articles on the medium and the marvellous\nluminous phenomena said to occur in his presence. Later he\nvisited Paris ; Dr. Geley did not issue a detailed report, but\nmanaged to secure the services of the medium for a further\nperiod in February 1924. The phenomena were then abundant\nand impressive and besides the lights certain impressions were\nbeing obtained upon plates contained in sealed shdes. Dr.\n\fJune, 1924. The Case of the Medium Pasquale Erto. 279\nGeley very kindly invited me to be present at a few of the\nsittings, and lia\\'ing accepted, I went to Paris on February 4th.\nBefore the sitting Erto is examined and afterwards taken to\nthe seance room. There he is left uncontrolled, wearing only\nspecially chosen garments which at the earlier sittings consisted\nof a pyjama suit, but latterly a suit of tights was substituted\nfor the loose fitting jacket and trousers. Erto stoutly resisted\naU attempts at a systematic control. He objected even to the\nsimplest precautioiLs, and as he was permitted at least once\nduring my ^isit to be in the seance room alone and unattended\nfor at least five minutes, I deemed it unnecessary to cause any\ndisturbance by insisting upon a proper control of his person.\nAfter my return to England negotiations were begun with\nErto with the object of persuading him to visit London in\norder to enable the Society to make a systematic and detailed\ninquiry into his mediumship, concerning the reahty of which\nI had the gravest doubts, although fully beheving that the\nphenomena were worthy of careful attention. In April was\npublished a note from the Institute in Paris which was printed\nin the Parisian press and A\\idely circulated in England.\nFerro-cerium had been discovered upon Ertos person and\nelsewhere, and by the aid of this material hghts could bs\nproduced similar to these observed with the medium. Erto\nthereupon requested Le Matin to form a committee to declare\nupon the authenticity of his mediumship. The report has been\nprinted and an account has been published in L'Opinion for\nMay 23, 1924. The committee are unanimous in their view.\nIt is that Erto is entirely fraudulent, ferro-cerium being again\nfound and also a piece of a steel nib wherewith to rub it.\nThus Erto is the third of the great continental mediums whose\nwork has been endorsed by scientific committees and who\nhave been subsequently exposed.\"' Perhaps in the light of\nhis exposure, we can understand Erto's refusal to accept anv\ninquiry by the Society into his medirmaship. On February\n11th, Erto proposed the sum of four pounds per sitting, full\ntraveUing expenses and an additional fee of two pounds per\nday for his expenses. The Society did not feel justified\nin accepting this offer and proposed a compromise in the\nshape of an offer of two pounds ten shilhngs per sitting, full\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1924.\ntravelling expenses and one pound per day for board and\nlodging. This proposal Erto refused. Thereupon one of our\nmembers very generously came forward and offered to defray\nthe cost of Erto's original proposals. This offer was communi-\ncated to Erto who promptly doubled liis fees after quadruphng\nthem ! It was evident that M. Erto did not feel inclined to\nvisit London on any consideration.\nThe results of the exposures of such well-known mediums as\nLaszlo ^ and Erto are the same. Psychical research is retarded\nby such events, and the authenticity of all physical phenomena\nbecomes a matter of doubt to those who see in them merely\nthe performances of mediums such as these two. Such frauds\nwill take place just so long as investigators permit mediums\neither to be uncontrolled or to be controlled ineffectually.\nA systematic method of control is lacking, the investigators\nimagining that they are able to prevent fraud merely by\nmuddling through an unsystematic inspection and superficial\nexamination. Laszlo was stripped, purged, given an emetic\nand watched for many hours, but in spite of all these pre-\ncautions he smuggled in a roll of material to be produced as\n\" teleplasm.\" The trick he used was childishly simple, so\nsimple that it completely deceived his investigators. Moreover,\nthe danger of multiplying these farcical occurrences is very\nreal. Year by year as interest increases self-appointed\n\" investigators \" will appear with no qualifications whatever\nfor the task they have set themselves. The cases of Erto,\nGuzik and Laszlo show that modern fraudulent mediums are\nfar more ingenious than those in the past, and consequently\nthe Imowledge of trickery has to be increased in proportion.\nE. J. Dingwall.\nCASE\nL. 1255. Information Given at a Sitting Concerning\nA Matter of which the Sitter had no Normal\nKnowledge.\nWe have received from Mrs. Robinson, 125 Adelaide Road,\nN.W. 3, the following report of an incident in which information\n'It is hoped that a report on the exposure of Laszlo may be printed later.\n\fJune, 1924. Case. 281\nwas given in a mediumistic trance in regard to a matter con-\ncerning which neither the medium nor the sitter had any\nnormal knowledge at the time of the sitting. Mrs. Eobinson's\noriginal report of the incident (printed below) was written out\nin 1918 shortly after the sitting, but was not sent to us until\nJanuary of this year.\nStatement by Mrs. Robinson :\n\u2014\nA GIFT OF LINEN (1918).\nMrs. Taylor is a friend of long-standing, whose acquaintance I\nrenewed some eighteen months ago. We are both deeply interested\nin occult matters, though I, personally, have little time for study\nor investigation. Whenever we meet, which is seldom, our con-\nversation is generally on such topics ; we do not discuss household\nmatters as we might if we met casually and often.\nMrs. Taylor's mother, Mrs. Bentley, I also knew some years\nago, but I have met her only a few times, and only once during\nthe last eighteen months since Mrs. Taylor and I resumed our\nfriendship. 1 had a very strong instinctive liking for Mrs. Bentley,\nand I think she had feelings of friendliness for me, in each case\nrather out of proportion to the slightness of our acquaintance.\nBut neither with Mrs. Bentley nor Mrs. Taylor did 1 discuss\nconcerns of the house, and certainly not the special matter with\nwhich the following experience deals. Our minds had never been\nin touch on the question of house-linen ; neither had the least\nidea of the condition of my linen cupboard.\nAt the end of last year (December 6th, 1917) I had one sitting\nwith Miss Miller 1 the medium, at which Mrs. Taylor was present.\nThe sitting was interesting, and what the medium told me was\naccurate, but no deep impression was made on my mind. After\nthat sitting I did not meet Mrs. Taylor again for quite six\nmonths.\nMeanwhile, at the beginning of this year, Mrs. Bentley died. 1\nwas very sorry, and thought much of her\u2014and of Mrs. Taylor.\nAs the spring came, among the many practical matters with\nwhich my mind is always occupied, 1 was obliged to consider\nseriously the condition of my house-linen, which was in very sad\nneed of renewal. I looked longingly in shop windows, and hunted\ndesperately in sale catalogues, but any chance of buying new\n^The medium's name is known to the Society, but a pseudonym is printed here.\n\f282 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1924.\nlinen seemed to become more and more impossible. The state of\nthe tablecloths, pillow-cases, and towels was a subject of general\nfamily comment. At last, on Sunday evening, April 7th, the\ndiscussion became critical, my son plainly declaring that he found\nthe utmost difficulty in drying himself on \" holes.\" But in spite\nof this pathetic representation, I was obliged to decide and state\nfinally that it was entirely impossible for me to buy any house-\nlinen that would at all meet the problem of our needs.\nBy the first post next morning, April 8th, I received the\nfollowing letter from Mrs. Taylor. Rose M. H. Robinson,\n125 Adelaide Road, N.W. 3.\nFormerly of\n20 Well Walk, N.W. 3.\nWith the above statement was enclosed a letter from Mrs.\nTaylor to Mrs. Robinson as follows :\nAfril 1th (1918).!\nSt. James' Terrace, Regents Park, N.W\\ 8.\nMy Dear Mrs. Robinson,\nI had a most wonderful sitting with Miss Miller, and\nfeel convinced my dear Mother really spoke. Some time or other\nI should like to tell you all about it, but now just a little bit.\nShe spoke of you, and Miss Miller said Mother wanted me to give\nyou something white of hers.\nThen she said, It is house-linen.\" Mother said she wished you\nto have some sheets, pillow-cases, and tablecloths, \" because you\nneeded them.\"\nIs that so ? Strangely enough I had been thinking during the\nmorning I should have more linen than I needed, as I have half\nMother's as well as my own now, and not room for it all. It is\nat present stored at Shoolbred's, but I shall be moving to our\nnew house (near Chalk Farm tube) at the end of May. Then\nI shall be so delighted if you will have this little present from\nMother. I have few tablecloths except kitchen ones, but plenty\nto spare of them, and single and double sheets (the latter large\nlinen ones, not very new, but good still), and pillow-cases in fair\ncondition also. Nothing is quite new naturally, but as all cotton\nand linen things are so scarce a few extra may, I hope, be of\nuse to you, as dear Mother thinks. Let me know if she is right.\nWith love, always yours sincerely,\nE. M. Taylor.\n1 Postmark on envelope, 7th April, 1918.\n\fJune, 1924. Case. 283\nMrs. Robinson also enclosed her reply to Mrs. Taylor, as\nfollows :\n20 Well Walk, Hampstead, N.W. 3.\nMy Dear Mrs. Taylor, ^W^^ 8<A, 1918.\nYour kind and thoughtful Mother is perfectly right. I\ndo need house-linen very badly. For some time the matter has\nagitated the family and caused me very anxious consideration.\nOnly last night\u2014perhaps while you were writing\u2014we were again\ndiscussing the state of things, and I said finally that we must\nhang on, as I could not afford any extra expenditure now. For\na long while I have been looking in catalogues and shop windows\nwith the question of house-linen in my mind, so you may imagine\nthat your letter this morning stirred me very deeply. It is so\nexquisitely dear and considerate .of Mrs. Bentley. I think she\nknows that I thank her very much.\nIf the rest of the messages were as clear and as absolutely\ncorrect as the one connected with myself, you must have had\na wonderful sitting, and I am so glad for you. When you feel\nyou would like to tell me more about it, please let me know,\nbecause you may be certain that I shall care very much to hear.\nI have thought a good deal about you lately, but have not been\nto see you because I know that at first one cannot talk much,\nif at all, about what hes so near one's heart, but Mrs. Bentley\nevidently knows that you and she have both been in my thoughts.\nI shall be delighted to have some of her linen\u2014just what you\ncan really spare. I am specially weak in towels, but tablecloths\nand pillow-cases are getting shabby too.\nThere is another point, too, about the message. Lately I have\nbeen wishing that I could have some real proof that there is some\nindividual consciousness\u2014apart from my own or that of a medium\n\u2014in the touches I have had from the other side. I was saying\nso to Miss W only just lately. Your Mother's message really\nseems an answer to that, doesn't it ? because you and Miss Miller\nat the time were so absolutely out of touch with me that I\ndon't think you could have known, even subconsciously, that the\nsmall matter of house-linen was worrying me.\nIt is very wonderful, because it is all very true, and I am so\nglad for you, and grateful to Mrs. Bentley, and pleased and happy\nfor myself.\nMuch love From your affectionately,\nRose M. H. Robinson.\n\f284 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1924.\nAt the same time that she seut to the Society the state-\nment and letters printed above, Mrs. Robinson also wrote to\nMrs. Salter, the editor, as follows :\n125 Adelaide Koad, N.W. 3,\nJanuary 28th. 1924.\nI ENCLOSE an account of an incident\u2014with corroborative docu-\nments\u2014which may be of interest to your Society. The account,\nas you will see from internal evidence, was written during the\nyear (1918) in which the incident occurred. . . .\nPlease note particularly three points in connection with this\nmatter.\n(1) That Miss Miller had no knowledge whatever that Mrs.\nTaylor had any surplus Unen to dispose of. And so little did\nMrs. Taylor think of it herself that she enquired of the medium\nwhether \" Something white \" might be a shawl ?\n(2) That neither Mrs. Taylor nor Mrs. Bentley [Mrs. Taylor's\nmother] knew anything at all about my need of linen.\n(3) That between December 6, 1917, and April 1918 Mrs.\nTaylor and I had not met nor corresponded, except that I wrote\nto her on the occasion of her mother's\u2014Mrs. Bentley's\u2014death,\nFebruary 10, 1918.\nI am sending you these documents with the full consent of\nMrs. Taylor.\nI may add that during the last 2| years\u2014that is, since Mrs.\nTaylor moved to her present address at 22 Primrose Hill Road,\nN.W. 3., and I to this one in Adelaide Road\u2014we have worked\ntogether for automatic communications, which are often quite\ninteresting and in some instances veridical.\nWe are both very busy women, chiefly occupied in that most\nexacting and practical business of looking after households and\nfamily concerns.

Correspondence. 285\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nConcerning Miss Radclyffe-Hall's Resignation\nFROM THE Council.\n3 Kensington Palace Mansions,\nDe Vere Gardens, W.\nMay 30th, 1924.\nDear Mrs. Salter,\u2014I shall be glad if you will insert this\nletter in the next copy of the Journal, as I wish to make it\nquite clear to all our readers, and particularly to those of my\nfellow workers who have, in the past, shown appreciation of the\nefiorts made by Una Lady Troubridge and myself in the cause\nof Psychical Research, that we continue to take a keen interest\nin the subject.\nIn the announcement of my resignation from the Council which\nappears in the Journal No. CCCCV.\u2014VOL. XXL, May 1924,\nappears the following words :\n\" her time having become so fully occupied with other matters\nas to prevent her from remaining an active member.\"\nI feel that were I to read these words regarding anyone who\nhad been an active worker in Psychical Research, I should\nimmediately conclude that the person in question had, either\nfrom entire loss of interest, or from some other cause, ceased to\npursue the subject altogether.\nI should like it to be understood that ill health was one of my\nprincipal reasons for tendering my resignation ;\nmy only other\nreason being that my literary work has made greater calls upon\nme lately than in the past. I have no intention of giving up\nPsychical Research ;\nmy interest in it has not diminished, but\nhas rather increased after a good many years of study ; and I am\nstill a regular sitter with Mrs. Leonard, whose powers, in my\nopinion, are greater far to-day than they were at the beginning\nof my investigation.\nWe all know that purely mundane interests may sometimes\nintrude themselves to the exclusion of such a subject as ours ;\nbut I can only repeat that in my case this has not been so, and\nas far as I can see at present, never will be.\nYours sincerely,\nM. Radclyffe-Hall.\n\f286 Journal of Society for PsycJiical Research. June, 1924.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for April\nhas an account of the phenomena alleged to have occurred in the\npresence of the Icelandic medium Indridason. The reports are\nreprinted from articles in ncAvspapers and are of little scientific\nvalue. Dr. Prince contributes several reports of cases which iiave\npassed through his hands including an account of a sitting with\nan American trumpet medium in the light, which affords a good\nillustration of the value of an independent report by an expert.\nPsycliische Studien for April has an account by Dr. Erich\nKindborg on the famous stone-throwing poltergeist case in Java\nin 1831. A documented report of this incident was printed in\nPsychische Studien in January, 1881 (pp. 5-12)^ and here Dr. Kind-\nborg contributes a further accoimt and criticism. In the same\nissue M. Koehler has a short paper upon occult phenomena in\nthe Old and New Testaments, and M. Reinhold contributes a\nletter upon the recent alleged exposures of Rudi Schneider and\nLaszlo, to which has now been added the discovery of normal\nmethods of producing the luminous appearances observed with\nthe medium Pasquale Erto together with traces of the necessary\nsubstance on the medium's clothing and elsewhere. He maintains\nthat the scientific world is making a united attack upon psychical\nresearch throughout Europe in the hope of discrediting the in-\nvestigators and demonstrating the fraudulent character of the\nphysical phenomena.\nL'Opinion for May 30 has an amusing article by M. Paul\nHeuze upon the alleged exposure of the medium Erto. He relates\nthe story of how Erto has been working in spiritualistic circles\nfor ten years and was then finally made famous by Dr. William\nMackenzie and his collaborators in Genoa. Then came the sittings\nin Paris and at the Institut du Radium a, fragment of ferro-\ncerium was found, to be followed by even more damaging dis-\ncoveries. M. Heuze condemns the investigators : he says that\n^ For a collected version of similar stone-throwing incidents see The\nSpiritual Magazine, 18G5, VI. pp. 3-17; 49-70; 108-110. Compare also\nthe well-known Paris case translated by Sir A. R. Wallace and published\nin his Miracles and Modern Spiritualism (London, 1896), pp. 284-286; the\nGrottendieck case published in the Joimial for May 1906, and the less\nknown, but equally curious account of the phenomena which occurred in\nNew Hampshire in the seventeenth century which Governor E. Cranfield\nascribed to \" the waggery of some unlucky boy !\n\" (See C. R., Esq. [i.e.\nRichard Chamberlain]). Lithobolia (London, 1698).\n\fJune, 1924. Notes on Periodicals. 287\nby reason of these revelations the ordinary plain man does not\nknow what to think. \" Remarquons,\" he observes, \" que les\nliommes qui nous ont dit d'Erto :\n'\nnous Vavons mis dans Vim-\nfossibilite de truquer ' nous avaient dit exactement la mhne chose\nd'Eva Carriere et de Guzik.\" M. Heaze's conclusion is brief and\nto the point, although we do not think he has made his mean-\ning perfectly clear. He says :\n\" Ancun ])}ienomene mediumnique\nne devrait etre livre a I'etude des hommes de science avant d'avoir\nete d'abord authentique par des specialistes du truquage.\"\nIf by this pronouncement M. Heuze means that a committee\nof conjurers is to be the first judge, then no genuine medium\nwould consent to such a plan, and the medium would, in our\nview, be right in this decision. But if M. Heuze implies that a\ncommittee of scientists versed in trick methods is to be employed,\nthen we agree with him, but we must doubt whether that interpre-\ntation is justified from his words. What is needed is not the\nconjurer but the scientist with the conjurer's knowledge ; the\nman who will not confuse, as M. Heuze has done, the different\ntypes of mediumship such as those of Eva, Guzik or Erto. Con-\ntrol is to be varied as the types of phenomena var)^ A control\ndesirable with Erto is totally distinct from that desirable with\nWilly Schneider or with Frau Silbert. Similarly no knowledge\nof places of concealment will assist an investigator of Ossowiecki\nand Bert Reese. The phenomena of sealed l^illet reading appear\nthe same in both cases. They are in reality totally different and\nthe control varies accordingly. Genuine mediumship is full of\nsuspicious appearances, which can easily be wrongly interpreted\nby those unaccustomed to the singular phenomena of the seance\nroom. Accusations of fraud are then launched against the un-\nfortunate mediums supported by no real evidence and credited by\npersons who, although not openly hostile, are secretly of the\nopinion that all physical phenomena are fraudulent. Thus in\nthe Tagespost published in Graz on Sunday, March 23, 1924,\n(morning edition), occurs a long article by Professor Dr. Hans\nBenndorf in which he publishes letters from various persons\naccusing Frau Silbert of gross and deliberate fraud. He says that\nhe has received accounts \" from a whole series of persons in\nwhose honour and integxity he has full confidence \" in which the\nmedium is openly accused of trickery. One account says that\nthe luminous appearances seen with this medium are due to\nsmall detonating caps.\nDiu-ing one of the sittings a Mr. Schmidtbauer turned on a\nflash lamp and saw Frau Silbert standing up, whilst on the\ntable lay the remains of one of these explosive caps. Another\nreport narrates how the alleged teleplasm was seen beneath the\ntable and how it resembled \" a rather coarse, yellowish-white\nwoollen stocking.\" The next revelation is made by a student,\nMr. T. von Somogyi. His story is as follows. At a sitting with\nFrau Silbert at the house of Dr. Reisch, his host and hostess\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1924.\nexperienced repeated touches. Desirous of seeing the teleplasm\nhe crept under the table unseen by anyone in the circle. Al-\nthough, however, the light above the table was apparently insuffi-\ncient for the circle to notice the absence of one of their number,\nthe light below enabled this keen-sighted witness to observe that\nFrau Silbert was wearing a high laced boot upon her left foot.\nThis boot parted in the middle, one portion remaining on the\nground and the other being still fastened to the medium's leg.\nThus the foot was freed from the shoe and was responsible for\nthe touches, which Mr. Somogyi admits were done with incredible\nskill. The same gentleman, whose eyesight deserves serious in-\nvestigation, describes the method employed for producing an\nalleged independent movement of a cigarette case. We translate\nthe passage in full : It is headed \" The Flying Cigarette Case\n\"\nand reads as follows :\n\" From the same sitting. The second\nobservation which I made and which is free from objection is\nthe following. My brother Viktor von Somogyi had laid his\ncigarette case under the table. Some time had elapsed and we\nsee the case lying undisturbed under the table. I remain sitting\nin my place noticing everything with the keenest attention.\nFrau Reisch goes to the sideboard to look for a bell which we\nwanted to put under the table. Everyone's eyes and attention\nare directed towards the sideboard and Frau Reisch. At the\nsame moment, the case, which we had just before seeu under the\ntable flew to Frau Reisch in the corner of the room. Everybody\nwas much astonished at this remarkable phenomenon. I made\nthe following clear and distinct observation. The medium, with\na short and energetic movement of her right hand which was\nmade as quick as lightning liad thrown the cigarette case into\nthe corner.\"\nThe accusation imi^lies that the medium first of all secured\nthe case and then threw it. It is remarkable that Mr. Somogyi\ndid not see her stoop and pick it up when he was gazing at her\nwith the keenest attention.\nThe next story is from Director Wahrlich. He attended a sitting\nin the summer of 1919, was repeatedly touched, seized the structure\nand found that he had the left foot of the medium clothed in a\nwhite stocking and that the half shoe was left under the table.\nSuch are the stories contributed bj^ the Professor of Physics\nin the University of Graz to the public press. We believe that\nif similar observations had been printed supporting supernormal\nphenomena they would have received but scant attention, but as\n\" exposures \" they are considered valuable and treated with\nserious attention.\nIn the Revue Metapsychique appears a translation of Dr.\nSchrenck-Notzing's report upon the medium Laszlo ; the con-\ncluding part of the rejDort of the Institute upon Guzik and a\nreply to Professor Zimmer by Dr. Geley in reference to the\nformer's article upon histotysis in insects.

Apparition of a Living Person.\nWe print below a report on two incidents in which an\napparition of a living person was seen at a time when the\nthoughts of the person seen, apparently the agent, were\nstrongly directed towards the percipient. The names and\naddresses of the various persons concerned are known to the\nSociety, but pseudonyms have been substituted here. The\ncase has been sent to us by Sir Oliver Lodge to whom the\noriginal reports and corroborative statements were addressed.\nThe first report of the case was contained in a letter written\nto Sir Oliver Lodge by the agent. Miss Stanley, as follows :\n[Received by Sir Oliver Lodge early in November, 1922.]\nI know you will forgive a letter from me as I think you may\nfind it interesting from a psychic standpoint. I have had (without\n\fJuly, 1924 Casc : Apparition of a Living Person 291\nhaving studied psychology to any extent) two very definite\ninstances of materialisation, I believe it is called.\nOne occasion in Vancouver 3 years ago. My mother was ill and\nI was tending her in our little flat till we came home to England,\nand shortly before leaving a friend asked me to go to the theatre\nwith her for a last time. Having settled my mother for the night,\nI was ready to go, and my mother said, \" Now, Marjorie, do not\ncome in to me when you come home to-night unless I call you,\"\nand I said I would not go in.\nAt 11.30 p.m. my friend Miss M said before we parted\n\" Do come in to have some refreshment, cake, cocoa or something.\"\nI said \" No, thank you, I think I must go straight home, as\nMother might wake up and be anxious if she found I was not in.\"\nBut Miss M persisted in asking me, and I thought, I suppose,\nvery intensely as to how Mother was, and if I could stay out\nlater, and I ended by going, as I thought I should require some-\nthing to eat, and if I got it at home I might make a noise and\ndisturb Mother, as our flat was very small. I stayed out about\nan hour more and went quietly to bed on my return.\nImagine my amazement when the next morning the first thing\nmy mother asked me was \" Marjorie, why did you come in to me\nlast night when I asked you not to.\" Of course I told her I\nhad not thought of going in to her, as that had been arranged.\nShe said she saw me come in, bend over her, as I had often done\n\u2014\nwithout speaking. She saw the light from the landing behind me\n\u2014and then I went out\u2014and she went ofi to sleep again.\nThe second occasion of materialisation occurred a few weeks ago.\nI went to visit a house where several ladies were sitting. One\nwas a stranger to me, but we spoke and she in a very jaunty way\ntold me how ill she was after many operations, aged 69, what\ncould you expect, etc. etc. ! adding that since last January she\nhad been told to use certain drops for her eyes (which had some\ndisease) also to bathe them every day with hot water. All this\ntreatment caused her agony and her eyes were steadily getting\nworse\u2014but she persisted in the treatment ordered. I was so\namazed at such faith in what was doing her an injury that\nI exclaimed, I have never seen such marvellous faith \" and was\nabout to leave the room, when I turned to some one and said,\n\" You have not told me this lady's name.\" I was told the name\nand I left the house. I must here add that I have great faith in\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1924\nhealing through the Power of the Spirit of God\u2014and that night\nin my silence to God I urgently pleaded for the healing of this\nwoman, and she was vividly in my mind with all her sufferings,\nas I asked for her.\nTwo days later I again went to the Convalescent Home, and\nnot seeing the lady of my prayers, asked if I might go up to her\nbedroom and see her. I went up and asked her how she was.\nHer reply was \" Did you pray for me the other night ?\n\" I said\n\" yes, I did.\" She said she had noticed my asking for her name.\nShe added \" I thought you had, for you came into my room\n(and she pointed to where I stood) and you looked just as you\ndo now. I felt vibrations coming from you and I felt happier and\nbetter, and you vanished.\"\nIn concluding I had felt intensely for this woman\u2014I'm supposed\nto be rather intense !\n\u2014but I was most astonished and gratified at\nwhat I heard . . .\nE. Marjorie Stanley.\nIn reply to this letter Sir Oliver Lodge wrote on November\n14, 1922, asking for some corroborative evidence. Subsequently\nhe received from Miss Stanley the following letter :\nDec. Uh, 1922.\nMany thanks for your letter of Nov. 14th in answer to mine,\nin which I told you two instances of telepathy (or as I thought\nit was thought materialised). I have pleasure in now enclosing\nletters from the other people concerned, which 1 hope may be of\nuse, should the two instances be thought worthy of record in the\nS.P.R.'s private Journal. . . .\nE. Marjorie Stanley.\nWith this letter were enclosed the two following corroborative\nstatements.\nLetter from Mrs. Stanley.\nMy daughter has asked me to corroborate an experience she has\nhad, which I will now relate :\n\u2014We were at the time living in\nVancouver. I was not in good health, and she did not like leaving\nme and for some time had not spent an evening out. However,\nthis evening she went out, at about 8 o'clock, leaving me in bed,\nand I particularly told her not to come into my room when she\ncame back. 1 soon fell asleep, a dreamless sleep. After two hours\nI should think, I woke to find my daughter stooping over me.\n\fJuly, 1924 Case : Apparition of a Living Person 293\nThere was no light in the room, but there appeared to be in the\npassage, which showed me my daughter's figure plainly as the\ndoor appeared open. Then it all disappeared and I was asleep\nagain. In the morning I asked my daughter why she had come\ninto my room as I asked her not to, and was much amazed to\nhear she had not been. E. Stanley.\nI Letter from Miss Florence.\nAfter visiting another patient in the house Miss Stanley came\nin to see me and on telling her how I dreaded the night, which is\nmy worst time, she helped and encouraged me greatly with silent\nprayer by my bed, and told me she would again pray for me\nbefore she went to sleep that night. Awaking in the early hours\nin greater pain than usual, I longed for her presence\u2014for one\nfeels so lonely when suffering in the night. My room is quite\ndark, as my eyes are weak, but I saw her quite clearly at the\nfoot of my bed as she had stood before leaving me in the evening.\nShe just smiled and disappeared. Nearly a fortnight after she\nappeared again, this time only her face and a greyish cloud round\nher, but all was clear. S. Florence.\nIt will be seen that there is a discrepancy on one point\nbetween the statements of Miss Stanley and Miss Florence ;\n. for whereas Miss Florence speaks of Miss Stanley having\nmentioned her intention of praying for her that night on the\nday of their first meeting, that is to say before the hallucina-\ntory impression occuxred, it would seem from Miss Stanley's\nstatement as though nothing had been said of this matter imtil\nlater. This point however is not of great moment, for the\ninterest of the case Ues in the circumstance that on each of\ntwo occasions Miss Stanley seems to have caused an external-\nised hallucinatory image of herself to appear to the person\ntowards whom she directed her thou2;hts.\nL. 1257. A Case of Reciprocal Telepathy.\nWe have received the following case from Sir William Barrett,\nwho came across it in looking through some old letters from\nF. W. H. Myers. Sir William Barrett writes as follows :\nJune 7 [1924].\nThough remote in date the following curious case of reciprocal\ntelepathy may be worth publishing.\n\f294 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1924\nMy friend the late Mr. Glover of Stephen's Green, Dubhn, told\nme about 1891 of a case of telepathy he had heard from Dr.\nHobart of Cork. This I communicated to Frederic Myers, who\nwrote to Dr. Hobart. The latter replied to Myers as follows :\nNov. 4, 1891.\nOn one occasion when I was working in a room and a\nfriend at the other end\u2014distant say 10 feet\u2014was near a\nwindow reading, his back being turned to me, in a day dream\nI seemed to speak to him and to a third friend, then many\nmiles away. Our discussion became animated and a slight\naltercation arose which was settled amicably.\nThe whole episode occupied, I should say, 5 to 6 minutes.\nIt would have passed away from my memory, but to my\nastonishment next day my friend said .\n\" I had a queer idea\nwhile in the room with you yesterday that you were speaking\nto me and our friend Brown came in and in his usual way\nsaid a few unpleasant things\u2014so and so, and so and so. He\nrepeated word for word the ipse verba of the imaginary con-\nversation of the day before. Not a sound or sight could by\nany possibility have conveyed the facsimile either to or from\none to the other and I cannot say in which of us the drama\noriginated, but it was a literal transcript of ideas, words and\nactions of .3 persons, 2 only being actually present. I have\nnever ascertained if the absent .^rd had a similar experience.\nMyers wrote to me to ask if I could get independent details\nfrom all the persons concerned. This however was difficult to\nobtain, and I don't remember the result. W. F. Barrett.\nTWO UNUSUAL DREAMS.\nI. A Sense-Impression lasting into Waking Consciousness.\nThe report of this experience which we print below was\nxeceived through Mrs. Leaning, a Member of the Society, who\nsent it to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, with the following letter :\nElmstead,\nBpsoji Lane, Tadworth,\nSurrey, April 9th, 1924.\nDear Mrs. Salter,\nI have just received permission to use the enclosed,\nwhich I have transcribed as it stands. It is an example, I think,\n\fJuly, 1924 Two Unitsual Dreams 295\nof a not very large class, and the normal sense being blocked\nmakes it a better case than some. It is part of a more compli-\n\"Cated account, and I have a good deal of side hght on the possible\nmeaning of the dream, the temperament of the dreamer, and the\niamily circumstances. The writer (this for your private informa-\ntion only) is a Mr. H C , and the dreamer is his wife.\nIn asking if I might send in the dream to our S.P.R., I told\nhim that my name would appear as the responsible communicator,\n-and that the Journal being for private circulation neither he nor\nhis wife would ever see it. She is exceedingly shy and reticent,\nand it is therefore only through him that we can get at her\nexperience. However, she had the dream on April 2nd, he wrote\nit down in full on April 4th, it was in my hands on the 5th,\n-and will be in yours by the 10th\u2014if you think it worth while\nto use.\nYours sincerely,\nF. E. Leaning.\nCopy of MS. sent to F. E. Leaning.\nApril 2nd, 1924. [The dreamer] was back in her old home in\nSouth Kensington, and in her mother's bedroom. She had a\nsense of being alone in the house. Going to the dressing-table,\nshe picked up a bottle of Russian violet scent of which her\njnother was very fond : she was going out and she thought she\nwould sprinkle some on her handkerchief. The bottle containing\nthe scent was labelled \" Russian Violet,\" and such as she was\naccustomed to see when a young girl. Directly she took up\nthe bottle, she felt an \" electric shock \" uj) her arm, and the\nliquid began bubbling and hissing and seemed \" to become alive.\"\nThen there issued from the bottle a vapour. A feeling of great\nhorror came over her, and she walked with the bottle to a writing-\ntable to place it down (the furniture was exactly in the same\nposition as in her mother's time), the vapour meanwhile streaming\nover her shoulder as she walked. She then proceeded upstairs\nto her own bedroom. The whole house seemed full of the vapour\nand the pungent smell of the violet scent. She awoke in fear,\nand with an overpowering smell of the perfume, which lingered\nfor a time as she lay awake.\nAn important point is this. Owing to a bad catarrhal cold,\nher normal sense of smell has disappeared : she can scent nothing,\n\u00a3\" Sufiers much from catarrh.\"\u2014Letter of April 8th.]\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1924\nThis is the second time she has awakened to the scent of\nviolets. The first occasion was, apparently, unaccompanied by a.\ndream\u2014if she had dreamed, she did not recollect it.\nII. A Dream Memory recovered after Many Years.\nIn this second case the dreamer, Mr. Ernest S. Thomas, an\nAssociate of the Society, sent us a record of his dream in\na letter to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nQuiney's Shottery,\nStratford on Avon, 21\/4\/24.\nDear Madam,\nThe following is an example of the solution of elements\nof a dream dreamt as a child, some forty years after the event,\non a recurrence of the dream. If such events are as uncommon\nas I imagine them to be, the details may be of interest.\nAs a child of six (under six) in Ceylon I used to play beside\na large coffee store of pink brick, with rows and columns of\nwindows like a mill. The immensity of the building to a small\nchild, with its majestic waterwheel and cascade of water from\nthe mountain behind, used to fill me with awe.\nA vivid dream I had at this time is deej^ly fixed in my memory,\nas it recurred frequently for some fifteen years, but not after\nthat until recently. Walking in my dream along a well-known\npath on the outskirts of a jungle, I saw a large tiger rolling\nand gambolling about the foot of a tree on the sun-dappled\ngrass. It sat up, looked at me in a very human way, and I\nwas filled with awe but not terror of it, or fear of its attack.\nThis feeling always recurred with the dream. The tiger was pink:\nwith black stripes. It must have been after an interval of at\nleast twenty-five years that I had the dream again some two\nmonths ago.\nOn waking, while still drowsy, I let my thoughts run to see\nif I could get a clue to the dream content. A vision of the\npink brick store with dark windows in lines down the wall\nflashed through my mind. I had not thought of the dream or\nthe store for many years, and had never associated them together\nbefore. The human-faced tiger, it occurred to me quite recently,\nand since the last dream, was probably suggested by the \" tiger\n\"\nmummers, Tamils fantastically painted and dressed up, sometimes.\n\fJuly , 1924 Tivo Unusual Dreams 297\nas tigers, with painted yellow and black, or blue and black,\nstripes on their bodies, who went about dancing and performing\nwith music, at the time of the Mohammedan Hassan-Hussein\n(Hobson-Jobson as the English called it in Ceylon) festival.\nI used to be terrified of these people. On jungle walks I\nfelt a pleasureable-fearful expectancy of meeting wild animals,\nbut not tigers, as I knew my elementary natural history.\nI feel confident that these elements explain this dream, inter-\npreted after a lapse, as I have said, of some forty years.\nYours faithfully,\nErnest S. Thomas.\nTHE MEDIUMSHIP OF MISS STELLA C.\nThe May number of the Journal of the American S.P.R. contains\n\u2022 a full report by one of our members, Mr. Harry Price, on his\ninvestigation of the mediumistic faculties of the young lady known\nas Miss Stella C.\nPart of his results have already been printed elsewhere, but the\npresent report contains the full record of each sitting and con-\nstitutes Mr. Price's complete account of his investigations.\nIt would be impossible in a summary to give any adequate\naccount of the various phenomena described. They include\nspecimens of almost every variety of \" mediumistic \" activity, and\nin the case of many of them the reader has to choose between\nadmitting their supernormal character and assuming the fraudulent\ncollusion of one or more of the investigators combined with\nincredible mal-observation by the others.\nApart from the extraordinary nature of the phenomena observed,\nthe report is particularly valuable on account of the careful\nrecords which were taken throughout cf all the conditions of the\nexperiment which were capable of exact measurement. These\nincluded various data regarding the physical condition of the\nmedium, e.g. her body temperature and pulse rate, as well as full\nparticulars of the surrounding conditions in the seance room, and\nthe readings of one of the recording instruments used for the\nlatter purpose formed one of the most curious of the phenomena\nobseryed. This instrument is a thermometer designed to record\nthe lowest temperature to which it is exposed after being set at\nthe beginning of the experiment. This is shown by the position.\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1924\nof an iron pin in the bore of the thermometer. This pin can\nonly be moved normally either by cooling the instrument or by\nthe action of a magnet brought near to it. It was found on\nvarious occasions that the pin at the close of the sitting had been\nmoved to a position corresponding to a fall in temperature of\nseveral degrees. Since all present appear to have agreed that the\ninstrument was correctly set at the beginning and not interfered\nwith before the reading was taken, Mr. Price is driven to assume\ni.hat the movement of the pin was supernormally produced, and it\nseems impossible on the evidence to avoid such a conclusion.\nMr. Price goes further and, correlating the movement of the pin\nwith the sensations of cold experienced by the sitters, claims to\n\" have absolutely proved that the temperature of the seance room\nfalls.\" Perhaps that is the most probable cause for the move-\nment, but if the psychic activities of the medium are able to\nproduce raps on distant walls it seems conceivable that they may\nalso affect the pin of which the movement would then be an\ninstance of telekinesis.\nAmong other ingenious instrumental aids to investigation, Mr.\nPrice also describes a device which he has named the \" Tele-\nkinetoscope.\" This consists of a small electric lamp which can\nnormally be lighted only by the depression of a small contact flap\nwhich is placed inside a brass bowl of which the open top is\nclosed by a toughened soap film.\nThe wires to this contact come out apparently over the top of\nthe bowl through small openings which are not closed by the soap\nfilm, and these wires are heavily insulated throughout their course.\nUnder these conditions Mr. Price was able to observe the lighting\nup of the lamp, which normally could only be brought about by\nthe depression of the switch which was protected by the soap\nfilm. Here again there is clear evidence of a supernormal event,\nbut it is difficult to agree fully with Mr. Price's claim that it is\nproved that the psychic force can penetrate a soap film. We\nknow nothing about psychic forces. It may have penetrated the\nbrass cup. It may have followed the course of the electric wires\nover the edge of the cup. It may have penetrated the rubber\ninsulation cf the cable and so brought the wires into electrical\ncontact. While the experiment is of the utmost value and\ninterest, the deduction from it is one of several possible alter-\nDatives, and while Mr. Price is fully justified in putting it forward\n\fJuly, 1924 The Mediumship of Miss Stella C. 299\nas a hypothesis he cannot in the present state of our ignorance\nclaim it as the only one. Other experiments described were\ncarried out in order to measure the pressures exerted super-\nnormally on prepared surfaces and to obtain permanent records\nof such pressures on smoked surfaces. The results are of the\ngreatest interest, but cannot be adequately summarised here, and\nit is certain that everyone who contemplates a similar investigation\nwill refer to Mr. Price's full description. Perhaps the most\nstartling of all the phenomena was the prediction on April 12 of\nthe contents of the front page of the Daili\/ Mail of May 19.\nThe prediction was recorded in writing at the time and signed by\nall the sitters, and while it was not accurate in every detail it\nwas correct enough to exclude absolutely any suggestion of chance\ncoincidence. Mr. Price was able to find out from the Daily Mail\nthat at the date of the sitting the advertisers had booked a\ndifferent picture for May 19, and only about Aj)ril 28 changed to\nthe one finally displayed, but it would have added greatly to the\ninterest of the case in relation to book and newspaper tests if he\nhad been able to find out from the advertisers when and why the\noriginal booking and the change were made and at what date the\npicture printed was first drawn, and if at any time a poster had\nbeen submitted to them which resembled the prediction even more\nclosely than the one actually printed.\nThe series of sittings eventually came to an end through causes\noutside Mr. Price's control, though he concludes his paper on a\nnote of hope that at some time in the future it may be possible\nto resume them. In that hope everyone who is interested in\nPsychical Eesearch will join.\nV. J. W.\n\u2022 \"\nCOERESPONDENCE.\nBrain and Speech.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In connection with Sir Oliver Lodge's article on this\nsubject, it may be worth while to record my experience when\nteaching a child to read. The child was born with a malformation\nof the spine, which was described to me as a \" thickening of\nthe spinal cord \" ; the result was that the nerves did not act\nnormally on the muscles ; it was as if a drag was on all the\n\f300 Jotvrnal of Society for Psychical Research July, ]924\nwheels of life in the mechanism of the body. The case was a.\nrather rare one. I undertook the education of the child, who was-\na relative. His intelligence and will-power were assets which\nmade the task very interesting. I found when he could read\nthat he would suddenly be unable to pronounce quite a simple\nword, such as and or I, which at another time he could pro-\nnounce easily. I knew that mentally he recognised the word,\nand that his muscles could pronounce it ; the hitch was not in\nmind or muscle ; no doubt Sir Oliver Lodge's sentence exactly\ndescribes the condition\u2014it was \" not due to mental confusion at\nall, but to a lack of adequate control of the mechanism ; so\nthat there was a block at some junction on the way to the\nspeech centres, an obstruction which had to be got round by\nsome indirect path.\"\nI tried several devices to \" get round,\" in order to avoid his\nmaking a painful struggle, which might have become a habit.\nSometimes I told him to spell the word and pass on. When\nhe had spelt it he sometimes pronounced it easily, at other times\nto substitute another word which had a similar meaning, and I\nalso suggested to him to look up, taking his attention from\nthe printed word, and then he could pronounce it. The device\nof substituting one word for another is similar to that apparently\nadopted by \" controls,\" referred to (p. 265) in Sir Oliver Lodge's\narticle.\nWith regard to names, many persons like myself are conscious\nof getting an initial or syllable of a personal name when the whole\ncannot be recalled. These sort of experiences corroborate a remark\nwhich occurs in one of Mr. F. W. H. Myers' articles, to the effect\nthat the difficulty which discarnate spirits seem to have in \" con-\ntrolling \" a medium may help us to understand the difficulties\nwhich we all have more or less in completely controlling our own\nmechanisms.\nH. A. Dallas.\nREVIEW.\nL'Ectoplasmie et la Clairvoyance. By Dr. Gustave Geley. Paris\n(F. Alcan), 1924. Pp. iv.-445. Price 35 fr. net.\nThis volume is the first of two works by Dr. Geley upon the\nphenomena examined by psychical researchers. It comprises what\nthe author describes as a simple exposition of the facts. No\n\fJuly, 1924 Review 301\n-theories are discussed, and all philosophical data are held over\nior the succeeding volume.\nThe first section is devoted to an introduction to the practical\n^study of mediumship. It insists upon a detailed course of study\nof the meaning of mediumship before embarking upon the most\nelementary inquiry into the phenomena presented. For Dr. Geley\na medium is a being whose constituent elements, mental, dynamic,\nor material, are capable of momentary decentralisation. Medium-\nship is an hereditary gift, and like artistic gifts has a tendency\n-to show itself early in life. Beheving that mediums are potenti-\nally capable of producing both mental and physical phenomena,\nDr. Geley maintains that the one class can give place to the other,\nor vice versa, even when a medium has been presenting one class\nonly for many years. Proceeding, the author examines the con-\n<iitions necessary for the production of good phenomena. In the\nmedium he maintains that good health, good temper, confidence\nin the investigators, and a state of general ease are desirable,\nwhilst in the experimenters, health, passivity, and patience are\nparamount necessities. With regard to the control of the sittings\nDr. Geley believes that the holding of both the medium's hands\nis an essential precaution, but in his analysis of the problem of\nfraud he forgets the principal point in all mediumistic deception.\nTo him the three necessary conditions for good conjuring are\n(a) liberty of movement for the performer, (6) apparatus or a\nfaked room, (c) confederacy. But he omits entirely the important\nfactor of misdirection. Slate-writing mediums often have no\napparatus and no confederates. Their very methods cause their\ninvestigators to imagine that their liberty is restricted. Mis-\ndirection is used by such performers to such an extent that the\nsitters leave the seance maintaining that certain things have\nhappened which have never happened at all. Without a knowledge\nof misdirection control is useless. The very fact of the medium\ninsisting upon his hands being held may be for the express\npurpose of controlHng his controllers and keeping them at arm's\nreach. Dr. Geley is right when he says (p. 24) that the control\nmust vary according to circumstances. But the variations must\nbe made according to the phenomena presented.\nIn the first part of this volume following the introduction,\nDr. Geley has collected a number of instances of alleged clair-\nvoyance of different types. Some of the material has already\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research July, 1924\nbeen made familiar to readers of the Revue Metapsychique, especi-\nally that relating to M. Ossowiecki. The most important hitherto\nimpublished material is an account of some of Dr. Geley's sittings\nwith Eva C. in 1918. They are important and highly interesting.\nMany of the phenomena developed slowly under the direct gaze\nof the observers. Fingers, faces, and flat disc-like objects grew\nfrom amorphous masses of substance, there being no closing of\nthe curtains between the successive appearances.\nChapter II. is devoted to the paraffin-mould tests with Kluski,\nwhich have already been published, as is also the case with\nthe accounts of the phenomena occurring with the mediums\nGuzik and Erto, which are described in Chapters III. and IV.\nChapter IX. is devoted almost wholly to an attack upon the\nmethods of spiritistic circles. Styling them pitiable comedies,\nDr. Geley declares that they are only possible on account of the\nincompetence of the directors and the absence of critical faculty\namongst the sitters. Such sittings, he writes, have started in\nParis and are spreading to the country, and it is impossible to\nsay how far the scourge will spread.\nAll experimenters, he concludes, who consent to inquire into\nmediumistic phenomena without sufficient control are putting\nthemselves upon the level of fools who let themselves be duped\nand who are making themselves the accomj)lices of those who\ndeceive them (p. 440).\nE. J. D.\nNOTES ON PERIODICALS.\nThe Occult Review for May has a stimulating note upon occult-\nlore in Brittany by Mr. Spence, who maintains that this com-\nparatively virgin soil offers a rich harvest to the patient inquirer,,\nthe editor contributes a series of observations on Mr. Sauter's\nrecently translated book Amoyig the Brahmins and Pariahs and\nMr. Span contributes a rather superficial and dogmatic account\nof hypnotic suggestion.\nIn La Lutte four la Metapsychique (Paris : P. Leymarie, 1924),\nM. Sudre deals with the present position of psychical research\nwith special reference to the recent series of- alleged exposures\nupon the Continent. We do not agree with his diagnosis of\nthe situation, neither can we assent to his estimate of the find-\n\fJuly, 1924 Notes on Periodicals 303\nings of the Sorbonne Commission with regard to Guzik. But the\nbook is interesting inasmuch as it throws light upon a point of\nview which many hold respecting psychic phenomena. M. vSudre\nis distressing himself needlessly over the recent exposures. That\nthey hinder research and cause much bitterness is certainly true.\nBut metapsychical studies are still young and it is only through\nsuch revelations as those recently made in Paris and Buda-Pesth\nthat investigators will at last learn that certainty can only be\nachieved by ceaseless vigilance, scrupulous accuracy, and above all\na minute acquaintance with the limits of deception.\nPsyche for April has an article on hand prints in relation to\nmental development. The author, Dr. F. G. Crookshank, has been\nexamining the palmar markings of Mongolian imbeciles and has\nbeen noting certain characteristics to which Dr. R. Langdon-\nDown had already drawn attention in 1909. Dr. Crookshank\nconcludes that the subject is of a great anthropological and\npsychological interest, suggesting that here may be found some\nempirical basis for the study of palmistry. It is regrettable that\npalmistry has never received the attention it undoubtedly deserves.\nPerhaps when the name has been changed to something else\nand the subject made respectable by Dr. Crookshank, Professor\nWood Jones ^ and others, the more timid inquirers may come\nforward and confirm the findings of those who have lung main-\ntained that palmar markings have a certain significance which\nit is unwise entirely to neglect. In the same issue Dr. Suttie\ncontributes an able discussion of the physiological theories under-\nlying M. Romain's alleged discovery of certain paroptic phenomena.\nHe concludes that in the first place the phenomena should be\ninvestigated by psychical researchers with their long and varied\nexperience of sources of error as seen in the seance room, a\nconclusion in which we most certainly agree with him.\nThe Scientific American for April has a summary of results\nobtained by the Commission. It pleads for better co-operation\non the part of mediums and concludes by an offer to European\nmediums. This offer, which is the first business proposition put\nforward by the Scientific American since the commission com-\nmenced its work, consists of a promise to pay full travelling\nexpenses and maintenance whilst in the United States. The\noffer is extended amongst others to Hope, Erto, Mrs. Deane, and\n1\nCf. F. W. Jones, The Principles of Anatomy as seen in the hand.

It is somewhat incongruous that of all the mediums\nWilly should have been chosen as the one from whom is de-\nmanded some defence against the supposed allegations of an\nobscure newspaper.\nThe May issue has an account of Dr. Brack's experiments in\ntelepathy. The results, which are sufficiently startling, were\nobtained with four subjects mostly under hypnotic influence.\nIn 108 sittings, 20 were positive and 56 negative, the remaining\n32 showing only partial success. Drawings were the principal\nsubjects chosen for the tests and the subjects' copies offer a\nremarkable similarity to the originals. Certain points in Dr.\nBrack's experiments are of considerable interest. Thus the occur-\nrence of a lag in the supposed impulse was illustrated by the\nsubject drawing something which was not intended, this drawing\nbeing the last one presented in which a failure was scored. A\nreversal of this was also noticed by Dr. Brack, which it is much\nmore difficult to account for upon any hypothesis.\nOBITUARY.\nDe. Gustave Geley.\nAt the moment of going to press we have learnt with much\nregret of the death of Dr. Gustave Geley, Director of the Institut\nMetapsijchique at Paris, and a Corresponding Member of this Society.\nDr. Geley's death occurred as a result of an aeroplane accident\nwhen he was on his way home from Warsaw, where he had\ngone in pursuit of his psychical investigations.\nA further notice, giving some account of Dr. Geley's important\ncontributions to psychical research, will appear in the Journal for\nOctober.\n\fNo. CCCCVIIL\u2014Vol. XXI.

He was much interested in our\nwork, and had himself contributed an interesting case of a\nremarkable apparition or rather waking vision of a dying man\nwhich occurred to a lady he knew, and the evidence for which\nwas very carefully collected. It was printed in the Journal,\nVol. XVII., and again in Mrs. Sidgwick's paper on \" Phantasms\nof the Living,\" Proceedings, Vol. XXXIII., p. 2'1:.3. He also\ntook part in the experiments with Eva C, and helped with\nsome suggestions.\nSir George Beilby was an industrial chemist of great dis-\ntinction, and the work he has done in connection with fuel and\nfuel economy and allied subjects is of great and lasting value.\nThe practical value of his work to the nation won him his\nknighthood in 1916 ; and his scientific investigation into the\ncell structures and properties of coke, and more generally his\nexperimental investigation of the microstructure and physical\nproperties of solids in various states of aggregation led to his\nelection to a fellowship of the Royal Society.\nHe was a most generous and disinterested man, and much\nbeloved by all who knew him.\nProfessor Falcomer.\nWe have also to record with regret the death on July 15,\n1924, of Professor Marco Tullio Falcomer, of the Regio Institute\nTecnico e Nautico at Venice. Prof. Falcomer was elected an\nAssociate in March 1892, and an Hon. Associate in 1901, and\nmaintained his connexion with the society up to the time of\nhis death.\nA FICTITIOUS COMMUNICATOR.\nIt is thought desirable by the Council that an account should\nbe placed on record of a case which at first seemed likely to\n\fOct., 1924 A Fictitious Communicator 307\nbe a valuable one, but which finally broke down under\ninvestigation. It at least shows the importance of careful\nresearch. All names of persons (including that of the com-\nmunicator ultimately proved to be fictitious) and names of\nplaces have been changed in what follows.\nTowards the end of July 1922 a Mr. and Mrs. Brown, not\npreviously known to Miss Newton, called on her at 20 Hanover\nSquare, and told her they had obtained in a private circle\nsome interesting communications purporting to come from a\ndeceased French soldier whom they had never heard of before,\nand that they had verified the information that had been\ngiven. They asked if such evidence was of value to the\nSociety. She replied that if the information was provably\noutside the scope of the sitters' knowledge it would be of\ngreat value. They said they would consult their fellow-sitters,\nand if all agreed would report the case fully to us.\nAbout the middle of August a note was received from\nMr. Jones, writing as the person at whose house the sittings\nin question had been held, stating that he had heard from\nMr. Brown of his call, that they were by no means forgetful\nof the importance of the matter, and that towards the end of\nSeptember or a little later he would write again with a view\nto re-opening it. Accordingly on 7th October, 1922, he wrote\nagain to say that \"if it should be the wish of your Society,\nand if certain conditions w^hich we feel bound to make are\nagreed to, we shall be pleased to put you in possession of all\nthe facts of the case . . . together with the documents appertain-\ning thereto.\" He went on to suggest an interview at the\nS.P.R. rooms, and gave the following account of the sittings :\n\u2014\n. . . Our small circle consists of Mr. [Brown] and his wife, myself\nand my wife, and my sister, the last of whom has taken notes\nof any strange occurrences. Very occasionally some well-known\npersonal friend has sat with us.\nOur sittings have been held with fair regularity on Saturday\nevenings over a period of about eighteen months\u2014since the death,\nin fact, of my second sister, who\u2014so we are convinced\u2014has been\nour chief visitant all this time.\nExtraordinary phenomena have from time to time occurred,\nwhich, though interesting and significant, I will now pass by\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\nbeyond saying that among them a table weighing about 25 lbs.\nhas frequently turned completely over without contact and that\nloud raps are of common occurrence. But this is not what is\nimmediately before us. We have received a large number of\nmessages\u2014if I may so term them\u2014from my sister and others,\nbut nothing which could be deemed conclusive as evidence till\nthe occurrence of the present case. ' \u2022\u2022:(\/ i-r .m;-.\nMr. Jones goes on to say that they are aware that all the\ncircumstances connected with such a matter must be closely\nexamined, and that they would therefore fall in with any\nreasonable suggestion made on behalf of the Society\u2014desiring\nas much as tbe Society that a good case should be established.\nAn interview between Mr. Brown and Mr. Jones and Miss\nNewton accordingly took place at 31 Tavistock Square about\nthe middle of October 1922, and notes of sittings and other\ndocuments were left for Miss Newton's consideration, with the\nstipulation that she was not to communicate any names with-\nout permission or to approach the gentleman whom I will call\nMonsieur C, who had confirmed the statements of the supposed\ncommunicator. The reason given for this was that Monsieur C.\nbad desired that bis correspondence with Mr. Brown should be\nregarded as confidential, and had been annoyed by some\nenquiries whicb he stated had been already made by the\nsitters concerning him. As a matter of fact, these enquiries,\ntbough contemplated, and though thought by some of the\nsitters, including Mr. Brown, to have been made, never were\nmade. \u2022\nTbe documents at this stage consisted of extracts from the\nrecords of two sittings, on April 22nd and July 8th, 1922,\nrespectively, at which Bernard Lebek (so spelt on April 22nd\nand persisted in in spite of questioning), or Lebecq (as spelt\nand persisted in on July 8th), communicated, together with\ncopies of Mr. Brown's letters to Madame Lebecq and to\nMonsieur C. and the replies of the latter. Later another\nrecord of communication from Bernard Lebecq, received at a\nsitting on July 30th, 1922, and a final letter from Monsieur C.\nwere added.\nThe communications at the sittings were disjointed and\nconfused, as communications through table-tilting are apt to\n\fOct., 1924 A Fictitious Communicator 309\nbe\u2014the confusion in the present case being increased through\ninterruptions by raps (with which Bernard Lebecq disclaimed\nany connexion). Moreover, questions and answers had to be\nconducted in French as Bernard did not understand English.\nMrs. Brown's knowledge of French was fortunately equal to the\noccasion. It will simplify matters, therefore, if we do not\nhere reproduce the records verbatim, but merely report the\nalleged facts communicated.\nOn April 22nd Bernard gave his Christian name and surname,\nstated that he was a soldier killed in the war at a place\nwhich he named, and said that he came from the town of T.\nin France. He had apparently nothing he wished to com-\nmunicate. On July 8th in reply to questions he gave his\nregiment (the 7th Zouaves), stated that he died on July 3rd,\n1916, at the place named before, and was born at T. The\nsitters asked if they could do anything to help him, and he\nreplied, \" Dites, s'il vous plait, a ma mere que Jean est\nheureux,\" and added that she lived at T. in a street and at\na number given, that she was a shoemaker and a widow.\nAsked whether if the sitters wrote to his mother and told her\nthey had spoken to him and gave his message she would\nbelieve them, he answered yes. They asked further, \" Are\nyou happy, shall we tell her so ?\n\" And he said, \" Et petit\nJean aussi . . . tous mes reves sont a ma mere.\" He also\nstated in answer to questions that he had been a dealer\n(negociant) in wines, and was thirty-five years old when he\ndied.\nAfter this Mr. Brown undertook to write in French tenta-\ntively to Madame Veuve Lebecq asking whether she had a\nson named Bernard who was killed in the war and another\nson named Jean. If so, and if she would write to him, he\nwould give her news of them. A copy of this letter, dated\nJuly 10th, 1922, is among the documents.\nA reply came dated and postmarked Paris, July 17th, and\nsigned [Emile C.]. The following is a translation of it :\n\u2014\nI am in possession of your letter of the 10th instant, which\nyou addressed to Madame Veuve [Lebecq] at [T.]. Unfortunately\nMadame [Lebecq] is blind and has been almost out of her mind\nfor the last four years. The loss of her two sons during the war\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\nwas a great grief to her and changed her life completely. You\nknow that her sons Bernard and Jean fell at , and now there\nis no one of her family living. I have been an old friend for\nthirty-seven years and I see Madame [Lebecq] from time to time,\nbut for a few minutes only. I have never heard Madame [Lebecq]\nspeak of you, Sir. .\n>\nIn reply to this Mr. Brown wrote on July 21st a letter, of\nwhich a copy is with the documents, thanking Monsieur C. for\nhis letter and regretting the bad news ;\nexplaining that he\n(Mr. Brown) had never known Madame [Lebecq], but that at\na private spiritualistic seance the message from Bernard Lebecq\nto Ms mother (as quoted above) had been given. The letter\nwent on to ask for the following information concerning\nBernard : (1) his birthplace ; (2) his occupation ; (3) the day\nof his death and his age at the time ; (4) his regiment. The\nwriter added that Monsieur C.'s answer would be regarded as\nconfidential.\n\"\nTo this came Monsieur C.'s answer, dated and postmarked\nfrom an important town in Belgium, and purporting to have\nbeen written on July 25th. The street and number were\ngiven. Monsieur C. stated that he had returned home a week\nbefore ; that Mr. Brown's letter to Paris (that is, the one dated\nJuly 21st) had been forwarded ; that he found it of some\ninterest, but knew nothing of spiritualism ; that Madame\n[Lebecq] could not be spoken to on the subject of her sons,\nbecause she only partly understood what was said to her and\nwas distrustful of everybody. He stated, in reply to the\nquestions that Mr. Brown had addressed to him, that [Bernard]\nwas born on March ith, 1881 ; that he fell at on July\n3rd, 1916, aged 35 ; that he was a dealer in wines and spirits ;\nand during the war was in a Zouave regiment, which was\n\u2014\nthe writer thought\u2014the 7th. These statements confirmed what\nBernard had said through the table. Mr. Brown was enjoined\nto treat the letter as confidential.\nThis letter having been acknowledged by Mr. Brown, the\nnext event was a further conversation with Bernard through\nthe table on July 30th. He was asked whether he knew a\nfriend of his mother's at B. He said yes, and on being\nasked for the name of an old friend of his family living at\n\fOct., 1924 A Fictitimts Communimtor 311\nB. replied C Monsieur C . He was then told of his\nmother's illness, and appeared much shocked ; he asked if she\nsuffered much and where she was. The sitters promised to\nwrite again to Monsieur C, and to let Bernard know what\nthey heard when they could ; there would be no further\nsittings for some weeks however. He was asked what was\nMonsieur C.'s occupation, and replied that he was a dentist\n(dentiste) at B., but denied that he had patients either at T.\nor in Paris [the two places besides B. named in Monsieur C.'s\nletters]. His address at B. was given, and corresponded\u2014\n-\nstreet and number\u2014with that on Monsieur C.'s last letter.\nMonsieur C. was informed by Mr. Brown in a letter dated\nAugust 3rd of this communication, and asked whether he could\nsay whether Madame Lebecq suffered and where she was, as\nthe sitters wanted to help Bernard as well as they could. In\nhis reply, again dated from B., on August 8th, he said Madame\n[Lebecq] had left T. and was in a hospital {maison de sante)\nnear Paris, that it was not possible to see her without giving\nher annoyance as she was angry with everyone, but that he\ndid not think she suffered much.\nIn the meanwhile Mr. Robinson, a friend of Mr. Jones who\nhad been present at the sitting of July 30th, endeavoured\nthrough a friend living in Belgium to find out something about\nMonsieur C. This friend, who wrote on August 6th, ascer-\ntained that the house in B. from which Monsieur C.'s letters\nwere addressed had been destroyed in the war ; that the firm\nof C. was and always had been dealers in lace, that their\npresent address was in the same street but a different number,\nand that there appeared to be no dentist of the name of C.\nat B., none being mentioned in directories. It seemed a\npossibility that there had been confusion in the table-tilting\nbetween dentiste (dentist) and dentelles (lace).\nMonsieur C.'s letter of August 8th was acknowledged on the\n16th, but a letter from Monsieur C, dated August 17th and\nsent from a town in England, reproached Mr. Brown with\nbreach of confidence, as Monsieur C. had learnt from a friend\nthat enquiries had been made concerning him. (It was after-\nwards ascertained by Mr. Robinson that the enquiries made by\nhis friend had consisted in looking in directories, so how\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\nMonsieur C. could have heard of them is mysterious. Also\nthat further enquiries, subsequently suggested and thought by\nMr. Brown to have been made, never were made.) Mr.\nBrown apparently wrote to smooth matters over (we have no\ncopy of this letter), and Monsieur C. wrote on August 23rd,\nagain from a place in England, where he said the letter had\nreached him during a brief absence from home, admitting that\nMr. Brown was not to blame about the enquiries, but closing\nthe correspondence.\nThere were some odd points about the case at this stage\n\u2014\ne.g. the curious spelling of the name of the communicator\n(which cannot be represented in the name we have substituted\nfor it), the strangeness of the reply to enquiries addressed to\nthe French Madame Lebecq coming through a Belgian gentle-\nman living at a distance, and Monsieur C.'s letters from B.\nbeing addressed from a house no longer existing. We may\nadd that a detailed examination of the French of Monsieur C.'s\nletters discloses errors so gross as to gravely discredit their\nauthenticity. Still, up to this point there seemed no reason\nto doubt the good faith of all concerned, and it apparently\nonly remained to discover whether the true information about\nBernard Lebecq's life and death had been published anywhere\n\u2014say in a local newspaper at T.\u2014and accidentally fallen under\nthe eyes of some member of the circle. AVith a view to\nascertaining this, Miss Newton explained what was wanted to\nMr. Brown and Mr. Jones, and obtained their permission to\nask a French member of the Society, who has done work for\nus before, and always with care and discretion, to make the\nnecessary enquiries. He was unfortunately in great family\nanxiety and trouble at the time, and this led to considerable\ndelay. In the spring of 1923, however, he was able to inform\nus that enquiries at the war office showed (a) that the regiment\nto which [Bernard Lebecq] claimed to have belonged\u2014the 7th\nZouaves\u2014had never existed ; (6) that there was no record of\na soldier named [Bernard Lebek] or [Lebecq] having been\nkilled. Such a record would certainly have existed, as every\nFrench soldier killed in the war was at once awarded post-\nhumously the Mihtary Medal and the fact recorded in the\nofficial journal and in the local papers of his region. Thorough\n\fOct., 1924 A Fictitious Communicator 313\nenquiries at T. revealed (c) that there was no such, street there\nor in the neighbourhood as that in which Madame [Lebecq]\nwas said to live ; and (d) that no trace of anyone named\n[Lebek] or [Lebecq] having lived at T. could be found, though\nsearch was made through many years. The name [Debecq]\nwas found, but the person bearing it had not been a dealer\nin wines, and had died at Paris during the war as a refugee\n\u2014\nnot as a soldier. The police register at T. for 1914 was\nexamined and no name of [Lebek] or [Lebecq] found.\nThese facts were communicated to Mr. Jones by Miss\nNewton, and she encouraged him to make enquiries on his\nown accoimt, both at T. concerning [Lebecq] and at B. and\nelsewhere concerning Monsieur C. What he learnt at T. con-\nfirmed our French investigator's conclusions. From B. he\nlearnt that there was no [Emile C] in the firm of [C], though\nthe late head of the firm, who died before the war, had Emile\nas his second Christian name, but was not so called. Also\nthat no one of the name [Emile C] was known at B. Mr.\nJones further found that nothing was known of anyone of the\nname of [C] at the English address given in the letter from\nMonsieur C. to Mr. Brown i\nof August 17th, 1923.\nIt was now therefore clear that both the [Lebecqs] and\nMonsieur Emile C. were mythical, and that the letters purporting\nto come from the latter were forgeries. The statements concern-\ning Bernard Lebecq through the table-tilting were false and\nhad not really received any confirmation. Evidently a\ndeliberate hoax had been practised on the circle by someone\nwho knew what was said by the table-tilting, and was there-\nfore able to confirm it in the forged letters. The further\nconclusion is almost inevitable that the letters from Monsieur\nC had either been written by Mr. Brown or caused to be\nwritten by him, and that he had arranged for their being\nposted in difierent towns, presumably in order to give the\nimpression that Monsieur C. was a person who travelled about\non business. The motive of the hoax is unknown, but it is\npossible that in the later stages there may have been in\nMr. Brown's mind a desire to test the Society's credulity.\nIt should be said that the circle very kindly invited Mr.\n^ The other letter posted in England had no full address on it. t\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\nDingwall and Dr. WooUey to attend a sitting in the autumn\nof 1922 with a view to seeing the movements of the table, etc.\nOnly Dr. Woolley was able to take advantage of the invita-\ntion, and nothing of importance happened while he was,\npresent. The phenomena on this occasion consisted only of\nthe usual movements of the table with contact, due, he con-\ncluded, to unconscious movements made by Mr. Brown, and\nof raps, the origin of which he was unable to determine.\nA SIMPLE TEST FOR THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.i\nBy Professor Hulsey Cason.\n[Editorial Note. We have received from Professor Hulsey Cason,\nof Syracuse University, New York, U.S.A., the following report\non some experiments in thought-transference which he has carried\nout\u2014with negative results. Professor Cason refers in his con-\ncluding paragraph to the \" aversion \" shown by members of the\nvarious psychical societies \"to the scientific method of experi-\nment.\" In justice to those who have carried out experiments in\nthought-transference either in this country or abroad it may be\npointed out that if these persons have not followed the method\nadvocated by Professor Cason it is not because they are in any way\naverse from scientific method, but rather because they are aware\n\\)t the pecuhar difficulty of applying such a method as Professor\nCason's to experiments of this kind. So far as can be judged by\nthe circumstances in which thought-transference appears to occur\nspontaneously, the state of mind induced by time-experiments\nconducted on such rigid lines is not a state of mind conducive\nto the reception of telepathic impressions. In investigating any\npsychical or psychological phenomena not under our conscious\ncontrol it is surely better to proceed by finding out under what\nconditions these phenomena seem likely to occur, and then\ngradually to modify these conditions to meet scientific require-\nments.\nMoreover, Professor Cason does not seem to take into account\nthe desirabihty of finding suitable subjects for experiment.\nWhether one person is better qualified than another to act as\n1 For a good introduction into the voluminous literature on this general sub-\nject, see Coover, J. E., Experiments in Psychical Research at Leland Stanford\nUniversity, 1917.\n\fOct., 1924 A Simple Test for Thought-Transference 315\nagent may be open to question, but\u2014assuming that such a\nphenomenon as thought-transference ever occurs at all\u2014there\nseems no doubt that some people are far better qualified than others\nto act as percipient, or \" re-agent,\" to use Professor Cason's term.\nWe can all, however, agree as to the desirability of carrying out\nfurther experiments along all possible lines, and we therefore\nwelcome this evidence of Professor Cason's interest in the subject,,\nand hope that he will pursue his enquiries.]\nThe material used in our experiment was a pack of 40'\ncards, on each of which was drawn a square, circle, triangle,,\nor rectangle. These figures had an approximate area of 2 sq.\ncm. There were 10 of each in the pack of 40 cards, and\nanyone could guess the figure on a given card 1 time in 4 on.\nthe average, or by chance. This pack of cards was used to\ndetermine the order of the series of figures at the experi-\nmenter's or \" sender's \" end. The re-agent or \" receiver \" had\n4 cards before him on which were drawn the same figures,\na square, circle, triangle and rectangle, and in the centre of\nthese figures was placed an S, C, T, and R, respectively. The\nwriter attempted to function as the experimenter or \" sender\n\"\nin all trials. I would take off a card from the shuffled pack,,\nand think about it for several seconds. The re-agent under-\nstood that one figure would be used as often as any other in\neach series of 40 trials, and that the figures would occur in a\nchance order. He made a record of the particular figure\nwhich he believed was being thought of at the moment,\nrecording S, C, T, or R.\nTwo types of procedure were used. In the first the subject\nand I were in different rooms separated by two walls. In the\nsecond procedure we were in the same room, and about 3 yards\nfrom each other. We may now describe the first kind of\nprocedure more specifically.\nThe second hands of two well-regulated watches were set\ntogether ; and at certain times previously agreed upon I would\nthink of the figures on the consecutive cards of the pack, and\nthe subject who had the other watch before him attempted to\nguess the figure. Starting on a certain minute previously\nagreed upon, I would think of a figure and the re- agent would\n\" search \" for it when the second hands of the two watches\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\nwere between 60 sec. and 5 sec, 15 sec. and 20 sec, 30 sec.\nand 35 sec, and 45 sec and 50 sec. At the end of each of\n\"these periods of impression, or when the second hands reached\nthe 5-, 20-, 35-, and 50-sec mark, the re-agent wrote down S,\nC, T, or R. Thus 4 trials were made per minute. In the other\nroom I was thinking about the consecutive figures suggested\nby the pack of cards during these same periods of impression\nand also for some 2 sec. both before and after each period.\nI made a record of the card thought of just before the next\nperiod of impression, thus making my record after the re- agent\nmade his. At the end of a series of 40 trials, i.e. at the end\nof a 10-min. period, I went into the subject's room to be sure\nthat the watches were exactly together and that everything\nwas all right, but nothing was said about the order of the\nfigures. The subject rearranged the 4 cards before him as he\nwished from time to time, in order to equalise any advantage\ndue to position. Before beginning each series of 20 trials, the\nle-agent put any records just made out of sight. After agree-\ning upon another starting-point, I returned to the other room,\nand after the pack of cards had been shuffled several times,\nanother series of 40 trials was begun.\nThe 11 subjects who took part in this experiment generally\ncompleted three series of 40 trials each per day. They were\nkept in total ignorance of the outcome of the experiment, and\nI was also careful not to look over the record sheets myself\nuntil a large enough number of trials had been made to\nfurnish reliable results. All of the re-agents made an honest\nefiort to guess the figure being thought of, and the records\nshowed that no subject consistently preferred any particular\nfigure. In fact, more changes from figure to figure were\nfound in the subject's records than would be found ordinarily\nin a chance arrangement with a shuffled pack of cards. With\nthe procedure outlined above, it seemed that the conditions\nwere satisfactorily controlled, and the results bear out this\nassumption only too well.\nNo extra-chance influence was observed in 3040 trials made\nin this way. The theoretical probability is 25 right out of\n100, and the group of 11 subjects made an average score of\n25-36. This minute difference of 0-36 in 100 or about 1 in\n\fOct., 1924. A Sim-pie Test for Thoug?d-Transference 317\n300 has no reliability whatever. We conclude, therefore, that\nmental telepathy does not materialise under these conditions.\nThe same pack of 40 cards was used in the other type of\nprocedure. Now, however, I sat facing the subject, in the\nsame room, and at a distance of about 3 yards. The re-agent\ncould see the upper portion of my body, but the view of the\ncards was shut ofE from his position by a screen. 2400 trials\nwere made with 10 subjects. After tapping on the table as\na signal for the subject to look up, I would turn over the first\ncard of the pack, think about the figure and look at it for\nsome 7 sec. This time-interval was kept as nearly constant\nas possible. At the end of each period of impression the card\nwas laid aside in a new pile turned face down. When the\nsubject saw this movement of the arm made in laying the\ncard aside he recorded either S, C, T, or R. Between three\nand four trials were made per min. All subjects were in-\nstructed to make whatever use they could of corneal reflection,\n\"muscle reading,\" \"intuition,\" changes in expression, move-\nments of the head, changes in position, sounds originating from\nthe physical process of thinking, etc. I made a record of the\norder of the figures after each series of 40 trials had been\ncompleted, and both subjects and experimenter again remained\nin complete ignorance of the outcome until after the experiment\nhad been finished.\nThe results from this procedure were a little surprising\nbecause of various claims which had been made for \" muscle\nreading,\" \" intuition,\" and the like. In 2400 trials the 10\nsubjects made an average score of 25-25 right out of 100,\nwhere the theoretical probability is 25-00. This microscopic\ndifference of 1 in 400 has no reliability whatever. Shght\nmovements of the body apparently do not serve as an adequate\nbasis for judgment imder these conditions. Whatever stimuli\nthe subjects may have received did not seem to possess any\nmeaning as far as the four geometrical figures were concerned.\nBringing the re-agent into the same room and placing him at\na distance of only 3 yards also did not enable him to make a\nhigher score than chance would allow. During the experiment\nseveral of the subjects paid particular attention to eye move-\nments, changes in expression, and movements of the head, but\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\napparently to no avail. In this latter procedure the subjects\nwere asked to underline the letters, S, C, T, or R, in their\nrecords, when they felt particularly certain that they were\ncorrect. 57 letters were underlined in this way, but only 14\nof these were correct,\u2014thus affording a further illustration of\nthe law of chance. Various factors of suggestion, etc., seem to\ninfluence the subject under these conditions. Introspective\ntestimony is of very questionable value.\nSeven men and four women, all juniors or seniors in college,\ntook part in the two types of experiment, and no subject\nshowed any particular superiority over any other in his ability\nto guess the figure being thought of. During the first type\nof procedure over half of the subjects believed in mental\ntelepathy in one form or another, and all of them were\ninterested in making the trials. Practically all of the subjects\nbelieved that some result beyond chance would be obtained in\nthe second type of procedure, and the failure to obtain such\na result was apparently not due to any lack of serious effort\nor willingness on their part.\nA good opportunity was afforded for \" mental telepathy \" to\nmanifest itself in both of the procedures described above.\nThroughout the experiment the records were conveniently kept\nin groups of 20 trials each, and the following table shows the\nfrequency with which the different numbers of correct guesses\nin 20 trials were made :\nNo. correct guesaes\nin 20 trials. Frequency.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\nm\n40\n50\nSO'\n48-'\n\u2022\n6\n'7'\n8\n9'\n10\n11\n12 0\n\u2022\n\fOct., 1924 A Simple Test for ThongM-Transference 319\nThe average score of these 272 groups of 20 trials each is\n5-06, as against a theoretical probability of 5-00. There was\nno case of none correct out of 20, and no case with more than\n11 correct. The distribution is seen to be skewed slightly\ntowards the larger numbers of correct guesses out of 20 trials,\nbut this distribution coincides almost exactly with the curve\nof chance for this material. In 5440 trials, therefore, the\nn subjects scored on the average 1-0125 correct out of 4-0000,\nas against a theoretical probability of 1-0000. The probable\nerror of this difference of 0-0125 in 4-0000, or 1 in 320, is\nmany times larger than the difierence itself.\nThe result of this brief venture into the thaumaturge's field\nof the occult affords nothing new to those who work with\npsychical research, but the type of procedure illustrates a\nuseful method of detecting or failing to detect the presence of\nmental telepathy, however weak or frail its manifestations may\nbe. The members of the various psychical research societies\nshow a peculiar aversion to the scientific method of experi-\nment, but if their claims are ever to be substantiated this is\nthe method which will have to be employed.\nSyracuse University.\nCASE.\nL. 1258. A Telepathic Dream.\nThe follo^ving case of a dream apparently of telepathic origin\nwas received through one of our Members, Mrs. Ernest Hock-\nliffe, who is personally acquainted with the dreamer, JMrs.\nGriffith. The first report of the dream was contained in a\nletter from Mrs. Griffith to Mrs. Hockliffe, thus :\u2014\nFriar's School, Bangor,\nMarch 24, 1924.\n. . . The incident you referred to was merely that I had a\nvery vivid dream about people whom I have not met, and as I\ndo not dream often and it was particularly vivid, I mentioned to\nmy husband that Sir R. J. Thomas and family were in great\ntrouble and I was very concerned about them in some way. He\nis Member for Anglesey, and I had heard that one boy was at\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Oct., 1924\nUppingham 1 and that is all I knew of them. Anyway, after break-\nfast we heard of the fire that had taken place in their house\nnear Holyhead the previous night and that there was a valuable\npicture burnt D. Qt. b. Griffith.\nIn a subsequent letter to Mrs. HocklifEe, dated March 29,\n1924, Mrs. Griffith writes:\u2014\nThe date of the fire could be found out because it was in all\nthe local papers and happened soon after the Prince's visit here,\non which occasion I saw Sir R. J. Thomas for the first and only\ntime. As to the time of night, I never wake up until the\nmorning bell goes, so I am quite ignorant. . . .\nD. St. B.

Thomas'\nhouse at Holyhead broke out on Sunday evening, November\n18th, just as \" the family were about to sit down to supper,\"\nand was got under control about 5 o'clock on the Monday\nmorning, by which time a large part of the house had been\ndestroyed. Since Bangor, where Mrs. Griffith lives, is only\nabout 23 miles from Holyhead, Miss Newton enquired into the\nquestion of whether (a) the fire could have been seen at\nBangor, and (6) whether any news of it reached Bangor on\nthe Sunday evening. Information on these points was obtained\nthrough a Member of the Society living in Bangor, to the\nfollowing effect:\u2014 ,, .\nThe news came to Bangor same evening per train (it was\nknown at Bangor Station). Mail train leaves Holyhead every\n1 Where Mrs. Griffith had lived for some j'ears.\n\fOct., 1924. Case : A Telepathic Dream 321\nevening, 7.30\u2014due Bangor, 8.25. Bangor Fire Brigade was not\ncalled out.\nSome students that I questioned, who live in upper Bangor,\nquite scouted the idea that the glare from an ordinary fire at\nHolyhead could be detected in upper Bangor. Apart from the\nfact that there is a distance of over twenty miles, there is a high\nridge in the way. . . .\n\u2022.i!!'^'- '\n-\nHaving ascertained that the news about the fire reached\nBangor on Sunday evening, Miss Newton then enquired of\nMrs. Griffith as to the possibility of any member of her house-\nhold having heard the news that night, i.e. before she had her\ndream. To this enquiry Mrs. Griffith replied as follows :\n\u2014\nJu7ie 26, 1924.\nAs far as I know no one in the house knew of the fire at Sir\nR. J. Thomas' until I read it in the paper. It is, however,\ndifficult to guarantee anything because there are over seventy\npeople in the house, but none of the boys were out as late as\nwhen the mail train came in. .\nD. St. B. Griffith.\nIn these circumstances, it appears improbable that Mrs.\nGriffith can have had any normal knowledge concerning the\nfire on the night of Sunday, November 18, 1923, though the\npossibility of her having unconsciously overheard some remark\ndropped by a person who knew of the fire cannot be absolutely\ndisproved.\nCONCERNING A RECENT CASE : A CORRECTION.\nIn the Journal for May of this year (Vol. XXL, p. 269) we\nprinted a report of a book test sent to us by Mr. J. F. C.\nKimber, who was himself the percipient. We have since\nreceived a letter from one of our Members j)ointing out what\nhe thinks must be \"a slight error, on the supposition that the\ncopy of Tennyson's Demeter is in the original edition of 1889.\nThe words '\nat this glad ceremonial ' are on the fourth line\nof page 9, not page 8. The third and fourth lines on p. 8\nrun :\n\u2014 , ^ ,\n,\nHail the fair Ceremonial\nOf this year of her Jubilee.\"\n\f322 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1924\nIn consequence of this letter Mrs. Sidgwick wrote to Mr.\nKimber, asking if he could throw any light on the point at\nissue, Mr. Kimber replied as follows :\n\u2014\nAug. 5, 1924.\n... I have looked up tlie quotation and must own the fault\nis mine. In writing to you giving you the case, I wrote from\nmemory instead of, as I should certainly have done, referring to\nthe book again.\nI am so very sorry, as I hate carelessness in these matters.\nMrs. Kimber will tell you that it was p. 9, not p. 8, I asked\nher to look up for me. . . .\nJ. F. C. Kimber.\nWith the above letter was enclosed a letter from Mrs.\nKimber, as follows :\n\u2014\nAugust 5th.\nJust a line to say that the mistake about page 8 in the book\nDemeter is owing to my husband having written it down from\nmemory. When he called me into the room, he told me to look\nat page \" 9, line 4,\" and read it out. I then read \" at this glad\nceremonial,\" put a mark at the page, and a little mark at the\nline which lies before me in the book now. Another time we\nwill see that the details of a test arc written down at once, then\nthere will be no mistake. . . .\nGertrude L. Kimber.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nThe Half-Belief in Immortality.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014In reviewing my Problems of Belief for the last Pro-\nceedings, Mr. G. L. Dickinson mentions, quite rightly, that I have\nquoted in it a number of typical answers to the Questionnaire of\nthe American Branch of the S.P.R. which Richard Hodgson\ncirculated nearly twenty-five years ago. He does not, however,\nexplain why I did this, and the reason bears so directly on the\n.attitude and policy of the Society that attention must once more\nbe drawn to the point which these answers seem to have proved.\nI used them to illustrate the nature of what I call a \" half-\nbelief,\" and to explain why under normal comlitions belief in\nimmortality remains a half-belief, and I defy an unbiassed mind\n\fOct., 1924 Correspondence 323\nto read these documents without accepting my interpretation of\nthem. Mr. Dickinson should, I think, have pointed all this out,\nas also that this was the first occasion on which these answers\nhave been published in extenso, thus completing the discussion\nbegun in Proceedings, Part 49.\nBut what is more unfortunate is that he should have seriously\nmistaken the original aim of our inquiry. He represents it as\nhaving been an inquiry into \" What the recipients believed,\nhoped, feared and so on about the question of survival after death.\nThe raphes showed great diversity of opinion and much reluctance\nto attempt to pursue the question in a scientific way.\"\nNow this is just not the point Hodgson, .James, and myself\ntried to elucidate. We did not ask people to tell us about their\nbeliefs and opinions. We realised how easily beliefs arej professed\nand how lightly opinions \" are given, and knew that, whether\nwe asked for them or not. we should get more of them than we\nwanted. What we asked for was the human sentiment, i.e. the\nway people felt about the prospect of survival, and the sort of\nfuture life that would be acceptable. We thereby assumed that\nthere was something deeper and more significant than \" opinions\n\"\nand '''\nbeliefs,\" viz. the feelings, desires, cravings, instincts, which\nfind expression, or rather take cover, in the opinions professed ;\nand our questions were designed as inducements to analyse them\nout.\nThus, if our assumption was justified, as I hold the answers\nproved, it would evidently be an enormous mistake to treat the\n\" beliefs \" held as merely intellectual products, capable of being\ndealt with by argument. They are largely what it is the fashion\nnow to call \u2022\u2022\ncomplexes.\" To affect them the methods of Psy-\nchical Research would have to address themselves to their real\nnature, and to be modified accordingly. Nay, in any scientific\ninquiry it would be necessary to distinguish, as intellectualist\ntheory had not done, between ordinary opinions, which are super-\nficial and volatile because no one cares enough about them to be\nobstinate, and those which are camouflage for deep-seated cravings\nand prejudices and, when assailed by reasons, change their form\nbut not their ground. Mr. Dickinson, I am afraid, has either\nfailed to follow this argument, or dishkes it so much himself that\nhe has slurred it over. But in the latter case will he not have\nprovided one more illustration of its truth \\ F. C. S. Schiller.\n\f324 Review Oct., 1924\nNoTJO BY Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson.\nI regret if I failed to follow Mr. Schiller's argument. I am not\naware of \" disliking \" it, and I suppose myself to be very much\naware of its general truth. Whether I am also an \" illustration of\nits truth \" I dare not affirm or deny. For if I were, of course I\nshould not know it. The same applies to Mr. Schiller.\nG.

Pp. 55.\nDr. Tartaruga, whose accoimt of the clairvoyant '\nMegalis ' I\nreviewed in the Journal for March 1923, has now become the\nDirector of a Parapsychical Institute which has been started in\nVienna and the Editor of its Library, of which this work is the\nfirst publication. It reports new experiments with '\nMegalis,'\nand also with a young Viennese business man, '\nErnest L.,' who\ngoes into trance voluntarily, and then becomes a child-like person-\nality, '\nEro,' and it has an important bearing on the theory of\n'\nclairvoyance.' For Dr. Tartaruga makes a determined attempt\nto test (1) the validity of explaining such performances by tele-\npathy, and (2) the actual way in which clairvoyants '\nsee '\nthe\nscenes they describe. His suggestion for testing the first point is\nthat there should be four series of experiments with every medium\n:\n(a) one in which all those present are aware of the object of the\nexperiment ; (6) one in which all but the experimenter know this ;\n(c) one in which few, one or none know ; and finally (d) one in\nwhich the only one who knows is absent, and does not know\neither when or where the experiment is to take place, and so\nthat he cannot be supposed to be actively transmitting his\nthought. It is evident that such experiments might yield results\nwhich would render the telepathic explanation extremely im-\nprobable.\nFor the purpose of elucidating the second point, Dr. Tartaruga\nvery rightly thinks that the actual proceedings at a sitting, as\ntaken down stenographically, must be stated and annotated, in\norder that their significance may be grasped. The conclusions he\ndraws from his own experiments are that there really is such a\nthing as clairvoyance independent of telepathy (in any ordinary\nsense), and that in estimating the results it is essential to make\nam])le allowance for the fact that what the medium sees he may\nbe quite unable to interpret, because his trance-intelligence is\nquite insufficient to understand it. There appears to be no\ndoubt that Dr. Tartaruga's experiments are conducted on the\nright lines, if scientific progress is to be made ;\nand, altogether,\nhe is to be congratulated on producing a substantial and valuable\ncontribution to psychical research.

There were also present : The Rt. Hon. G. W. Balfour,\nSir William Barrett, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Sir Ohver\nLodge, Mr. W. H. Salter, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, and Dr. V. J.\nWoolley ; also Mr. E. J.

The library cannot be reserved for group meetings more\nthan twice a month, and a clear week's notice must\nbe given to the Secretary. Group meetings can only\nbe held during the afternoon, between 3 and 6 p.m.,\non week-days, excepting Saturday.\n2. Groups must consist exclusively of Members and Asso-\nciates. Each group should appoint a Secretary who will\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1924\nmake any necessary arrangements with the Secretary of\nthe S.P.K.\n3. The choice of subject, method of discussion and member-\nship of each group will be left to the group : it will\nprobably be desirable to limit each group to a maximum\nof 15 Members.\n4. Group Meetings must not be advertised, nor must any\nreport of any discussion or other proceedings at any\ngroup be made to any periodical, whether pubhshed or\nprivately printed, mthout the Council's consent.\nThese arrangements are provisional and may be modified\nas the result of experience. The Council hope that they will\nhelp Members to keep in touch with each other, and believe\nthat informal discussions by groups might serve a useful\npurpose in supplementing the ordinary Meetings of the Society.\nCASE.\nL. 1259. A Telepathic Dream.\nThe following case of a dream which appears to have been of\ntelepathic origin has been sent to us by Lady Grey of Fallodon,\nwho is a Member of the Society.\nThe first report of the case was received in a letter from\nLady Grey addressed to the Editor, Mrs. Salter, as follows :\nWiLSFORD Manor, Salisbury,\nJune Uth, 1924.\nI do not know if the following case of thought-transference would\ninterest the S.P.R. that occurred between myself and a friend\nlately. Miss MacRae (the friend of whom I write) is often the\nrecipient of impressions and dreams, and has intimations of what\nher friends are doing at a distance which are arrived at not\nthrough the ordinary channels of sense.\nI was walking with my son on Sunday the 8th [June, 1924]\nand I said to him :\n\" For the last week I have had a return of\nthat neuralgic pain in my neck that I had three years ago ; I\nwish I knew if it comes from a tooth and if I ought to have\nthe tooth out or not.\" ..,\nOn the 10th Miss MacRae wrote me the letter which I enclose\n\fNov., 1924 Case : A Telepathic Dream 329\nMy son Stephen endorses below the fact that I spoke to him\nof this neuralgic pain before T\\e received the letter.\nPamela Grey of Fallodox.\nCorroborative Statement by Lady Grey's Son.\nI remember the conversation with my mother to have been\nexactly as she states above, and her reading the letter aloud to\nme subsequently. Stephex Texxaxt.\nWith, the above letter from Lady Grey was enclosed the\nfollowing letter from jVIiss MacRae :\nJune 10 [1924].\nDear Lady Grey,\nI have been told you had 'liu, but I hope it is gone now and\nthat you are quite well again. You looked so well when I saw\nyou I thought you were safe for the rest of the year and nothing\nevil would assail you. I dreamed one night that you told me\nyou had an old pain coming back down the side of your neck\nand that it was caused by a tooth. I hope it wasn't a true\ndream; perhaps it was because I was thinking of you before going\nto sleep. . . . WiLLEAMEXA.\nSubsequently Mrs. Salter wrote to inquire whether ]\\Iiss\nMacRae could remember how long an interval had elapsed\nbetween her dream and her ^^Titing to Lady G-rey. Miss\nMacRae replied to Mrs. Salter as follows :\nJune 26 [1924].\nLady - Grey has forwarded me your letter, and, in reference to\nthe date of my dreaming, I did not make a note of it, but I\nremember I was two or three days without writing after I had\ndreamt. ... Willeamexa jMacRae.\n]\\Iiss MacRae wrote to Lady Grey on June 10, 1924 ; it\nwould therefore appear that her dream occurred about June\n7th or 8th. Lady Grey's conversation with ^h. Stephen\nTennant was on June 8th. Miss MacRae mentions in her letter\nto Lady Grey that she had been thinking about her on the\nnight of her dream. This fact, coupled with her having lately\nheard that Lady Grey had had influenza, may have made her\nmind receptive to impressions about Lady Grey's health, but\nit could hardly account for the very close similarity between\nthe dream-impression and the actual occurrence.\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1924\nFOR AND AGAINST SURVIVAL.\nBy C. G. Palmer.\nThe great interest aroused by the two papers by Sir Oliver Lodge\nand Professor Charles Richet (Proc. S.P.R., Vol. XXXIV., pp.\n107 ff.) may perhaps be admitted as a sufficient excuse for my\nventuring to offer some remarks on the subjects they treat of.\nIn presenting the difficulty of survival from the scientific point\nof view, Professor Richet lays stress on two main difficulties.\nThe first is the \" rigorous parallelism between intellectual func-\ntions\u2014otherwise called memory\u2014and the brain,\" so that it is\ndifficult to believe memory can exist without the anatomical and\nphysiological integrity of the brain. The second is the unbroken\nchain of analogous memories throughout the immense animal\nkingdom. There is no gap or hiatus in the memories from man\n\" down to the worms,\" so that if one set of memories survive the\nothers must also survive. In reference to this passage I submit\nthat as a worm has no brain, it\u2014the intelligence within it\u2014must\nmanifestly depend on something which is not brain for the com-\nparatively simple intellectual activities of the worm.\nA fertile egg of the common hen may be placed in an incubator\ncompletely isolated from direct control by any brain. It contains\nnothing resembling a brain. Yet when given suitable warmth the\nyolk of it will develop special cells, it will commence to build up\na most complex body, and presently it will fabricate a brain suited\nto the future requirements of the chicken after it leaves the shell.\nThe work thus done by the yolk has involved intellectual\nfunctions of a super-human quality ; it has demanded profound\nknowledge and unerring memory to a degree that incomparably\nsurpasses the intellectual requirements of any work yet done by\nman with the instrumentality of his conscious brain. The work\nhas been done by\u2014or must we not say through the instrumentality\nof\u2014-organic substance which had no brain until it made one for\nits own purposes. The work has not been done under the control\nof a self-conscious mind, but it has necessitated the employment\nof intellectual functions. A similar argument develops itself in\nreviewing the activities of the vegetable kingdom. Memory is\ninnate in the organic cell.\nTaking this view of the facts, it seems difficult to hold that\nintellectual functions cannot persist without a material brain. It\n\fNov., 1924 For and Against Survival 331\nseems more reasonable to use the working hypothesis promulgated\nby Sir Oliver Lodge and regard the brain as an apparatus\ndeveloped by the formative impulse pari passu with the increasing\nneeds of more complex organisms by controlling and suitably\ndirecting the motor force\u2014whatever it may be\u2014in somewhat the\nsame manner as a telephone operator's switchboard increases in\ncomplexity as additional users need separate services.\nThe second difficulty\u2014the unbroken chain of analogous memories\n'\n\u2014seems to me logically unanswerable at the present stage, but\nyet overborne by the strength of a persistent inner urge. Those\nwho believe that urge arises from the deeps of the subconscious\nmentality cannot lightly disregard it, but will mostly be content\nto await the coming of more light to the conscious mind.\nThe working hypothesis of Sir Oliver Lodge entices me to\ndescribe very diffidently an imagining of my own\u2014a mere scaffold-\ning for thoughts\u2014which has seemed helpful in picturing thoughts\non the genesis of matter and its subsequent behaviour. In\nthe first place it has seemed to me that persistent action of\nany kind is a manifestation of memory. Imagine two unequal\nforces that fluctuate rhythmically being liberated in vacuo ; the\ntwo mutually attractive and mutually impenetrable ; both en-\ndowed with the persistence which is Memory, and the dominant\nforce informed with an impulse toward a Purpose unknown, but\nof which we now see some of the introductory stages. It seems\nto help my thought, but may be sheer nonsense to others.\nJune 27, 1924.\nNOTES ON PEEIODICALS.\nThe June issue of the Journal of the American S.P.R. has two\narticles by Dr. Walter Prince, one of which gives an account of\nthe experiments with the Scientific American. He describes the\nmethods adopted and gives some details as to the persons con-\ncerned in the inquiry. Drawing a sharp distinction between the\nstaff making the actual arrangements and the judges, he shows\n\"that many of the attacks made upon the judges were misplaced and\nindicated a misunderstanding of the position. Proceeding, Dr.\nPrince discusses the various test sittings held, which usually ended\nin the judges deciding that no satisfactory evidence had been\noffered to support the medium's claims. In one case, that of the\nJRev. Josie Stewart, he deals rather fully with the defence of this\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1924^\nmedium which was led in this country by Sir A. C. Doyle. Mrs.\nStewart claimed to produce \" direct writing \" upon cards supplied\nby the investigators, but the Committee easily discovered that the\ncards were substituted and published their conclusions. The case was\na palpable instance of fraud and the judges had no hesitation in deciding\nagainst the medium. Sir Arthur, however, relying upon methods\nof propaganda now familiar enough, defended the medium vigor-\nously in a letter reprinted in part by Dr. Prince. Taking a\ndozen examples or more, Dr. Prince shows that Sir Arthur s\nobjections and defence are based upon a number of misstatements\nemphasised in order to discredit the judges. Thus he declares\nthat the judges will ^aj the prize, whereas they will not pay a\npenny towards it ; that the medium had a dozen people around\nher at one sitting, whereas the printed diagram shows that such\nwas not the case ; that there was a \" minute difference \" in the\ncards whereas they were in reality longer, thinner, and of a different\nweight, texture and colour. Finally, in order to account for the\nfive missing cards. Sir Arthur suggests that the investigators failed\nto count them correctly in the first place ! Dr. Prince concludes\nhis caustic survey by printing another letter from Sir Arthur in\nwhich the latter suddenly discovers that the attitude of the\nScientific American was entirely justified. This amazing volte-face\nwas due to the belated discovery that some eighteen years ago\na spirituaMstic Committee had also decided against the authenticity\nof the medium's phenomena, and this conclusion disposes, according\nto Sir Arthur, of all his objections to the later inquiry.\nThe issue of the same Journal for August has a translation\nof Dr. William Mackenzie's pajjer at the Congress in Warsaw, and\na review of his recent book by Bozzano. Dr. Mackenzie, in a\nbrochure which has been widely distributed, annoimces his in-\ntention of giving up his studies in psychical research, being dis-\ncouraged by the series of exposures and by the extreme difficulty\nof distinguishing the genuine from the simulated, which he thinks\nalmost insurmountable. The September number has an excellent\nreview of the work of Rafael Schermann by Dr. Prince, and in\nthe prefatory note the author hopes that the paper may be of\nservice to those who wish to learn something of methods and\ncritical discrimination as practised in psychical research. The article\nis an admirable exposition of the principles to be adopted in an.\nexamination of the claims of a so-called \" psycho-graphologist.\"\n\fNov., 1924 Notes on Periodicals 333\nThe Scientific American for July has a further instahiient of\nMr. Bird's account of the work of the Commission. It consists\nof a glowing narrative of the phenomena said to occur in the\npresence of a Boston lady who is known under the pseudonym of\n' Margery.\" There are several records of actual sittings, but\nthese are worthless from the scientific point of view and the\nmedium's work is apparently treated as an exhibition since Mr.\nBird describes it as \" the big show.\" The story is continued in\nthe August issue. It is written in the same style as the previous\naccount, and it is a pity that the Committee could not obtain a\nsecretary who was not so obviously excited, emotional and oblivious\nof what facts are important and what are not. But the general\ntenor of the account leads one to suppose that the Committee is\nmore or less satisfied as to the genuine character of some, at\nleast, of the phenomena which include the independent voice\nmaterializations, lights, telekinesis, etc. Dr. William M'Dougall and\nDr. Prince v.'ere present at some of the sittings and presumably\npassed the report before publication. The final verdict has yet\nto be pronounced, the Committee having had 31 sittings when\nthe August issue of the Scientific American was published.\nThe AugTist issue of Psychische Stvdien has an account of the\nexperiment with Ossowiecki recently printed in the Journal. Mr.\nGrunewald contributes a translation of the report upon Nielsen\nrecently published by some Icelandic investigators in which the\ngenuine character of Nielsen's phenomena are strongly afiirmed.\nDr. Schroder has an attack upon the methods and conclusions\nof Moll and his school as expressed in the latter's work Der\nS]nritismus (Stuttgart, 1924).\nThe September issue of the same periodical continues Dr.\nSchroder's paper and has also a note upon Dr. Murphy's tele-\njDathic experiments by Dr. Bruch of Berlin.\nThe issue for May and June of the Revue Metapsychique has\nthe first part of Dr. Geley's report upon the medium Erto,\nthe tenor of which is already familiar to readers of the Journal.\nM. Sudre has a paper upon reincarnation and M. Forthuny continues\nhis Chronique Stranger, the contents of which should be read with,\ncaution. -\nE. J. D.\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1924\nCORKESPONDENCE.\n\"\nI. The Apparition of Booty on Stromboli.\nTo the Editor of the Journal of the S.P.R.\nMadam,\u2014This story has been repeatedly told and always in the\nsame form, beginning with quotations from Mr. Spinks' log of the\nmeeting with the Captains Barnaby, Bristowe, and Brewer (or\nBrown), and the vision to them and their assembled crews of two\nfigures in flight up the side of Stromboli. The foremost was\nrecognised by Barnaby as his neighbour at home, Mr. Booty ;\nand for saying that they saw him \" run into hell,\" on their\nreturn to England, action was brought by the widow, but the\ncase was lost. The date is given as 1687 ; the trial took place\nin the Court of King's Bench, and the judge is almost always\nreported as having said that \" two or three may be mistaken, but\nwe cannot suppose above thirty were.\"\nThe earliest account I have been able to find of this incident\nis in Wesley's Arminian Magazine, Vol. VL, p. 43, in 1783, where\nno date or names of any judges are given. But all the succeeding\nauthors (Kirby, 1804; Tregortha, 1808; Cockburn, 1815; Welby\n(i.e. John Timbs). 1825 ;\nCharley, 1836 ;\nMoncriefi, 1830 ;\nOttway,\n1846 ;\nMary Howitt (in the Supplement to Ennemoser), 1854\n;\nShorter {Spiritual Magazine), 1860 ; W.

He goes\non to argue, however, that there might be even an evidential\npoint about the jest as the supposed comnrunicator, A. W.

Assuming that the allusion is to the quoted lines :\n\" The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\nTo dying ears.\"\nI think it is very significant that the poem brings in the \" ear\n\"\nmotive in two places. First as emphasised by the pun (\" ear\nliest pipe \") and next in the phrase \" dying ears.\" It is true\nthat the plural form is here and the singular has just been\ninsisted upon very persistently in the script. But what about\nthe accompanying adjective \" dying \" ? In view of the \" Dy\nDy \" of the script four sentences further down, it seems to me\nthat the association \" dy ing ears \" is very remarkable.

By Rudolf Tischner.\n(Pfullingen in Wurtfcenberg. 1921). Pp. 371.\nThe historian of occultism invariably finds his task harder than would\nappear at first sight. The limits of his field are so vague and\nshadowy that he knows not what to include and what to discard.\nFor \" occult phenomena \" are so easily simulated and their very\nexistence is so hotly debated that any treatment whatever will be\ncondemned by those readers whose predilections have led them to\ncherish special prejudices. In the choice of his material Dr.\nTischner has not been especially wise ; at least, his book thus\nstrikes the present writer, who freely admits his own pecuHar\nprejudices. Moreover it is perhaps unfair to compare his work\nwith those of his predecessors, whose aims difl'ered possibly from\nhis own. Podmore's position remains unchallenged, whatever we\nmay think of his diy and even caustic comments at the expense\nof the spiritualists. After all he erred upon the right side and\nescaped the ponderous style of Kiesewetter, whose historical work\nis not so well known in England as it might be. Indeed Dr.\nTischner's work resembles the Englishman's rather than the\nGerman's.\nIt is popular and, for its size, surprisingly accurate, a feature\nwhich naturally commends itself to those who favour truth rather\nthan propaganda. Starting from the rise of the modern spiritualistic\nmovement, Tischner discusses the influence of the mesmerists in\nlaying the ground for the later doctrines. In dealing with the\nsubject he favours the older views rather than propounding any\nnewer ideas founded upon original research. With Podmore he\npasses over as scarcely worthy of mention the very remarkable\nmanifestations among early American Shakers, an omission partly no\ndoubt due to the rarity of Shaker literature in European libraries.\nSimilarly he neglects to comment upon the rajspings in the Potter\nfamily at Glenn's Falls which took place some seventeen years\nbefore the Hydesville manifestations. On the other hand, realising\nthe importance of the Joller and Kettelhut poltergeist cases he\nmentions them both, and among mediums actually includes Henr}^\nB. Allen whilst neglecting the far more important Mary Hollis.\n\fNov., 1924 Reviews 337\nIn selecting his cases and commenting upon them, however, Dr.\nTischner has obviously found some difficulty. Thus his perspicacity,\nwhich is well shown in his disdain for the so-called evidence\nregarding psychic photography, deserts him when he comes to\ndeal with such mediums as Eeese or such investigators as Kotik.\nHis observations upon Kluski are, on the other hand, to be\ncommended, whilst we cannot assent to his summing up of the\nevidence in favour of the Goligher phenomena. Chapter III. deals\nalmost exclusively with the English and American work upon the\nmental phenomena, and his section upon the cross-correspondences\nis likely to assist these Continental students who, not fully con-\nversant with English, find these cases of some considerable diffi-\nculty. Generally speaking, the book is written for German-sjDeaking\np)eoples and fulfils its aim in a way which is really quite admirable.\nHad Dr. Tischner been more cautious, both in his selection and in\nhis consideration of evidence, the book might, we think, have\nbecome the standard modern German authority upon the subject\nwith which it deals. As it is, however, the author has allowed several\navenues of attack to be opened- upon him. Thus the complete\nomission, we think, of the case of Mrs. Blake is almost as extra-\nordinary as the apparent failure to reaUse the enormous importance\nof the organised phenomena occurring with Willy Schneider as\ncompared with these alleged to take place with Guzik or Kluski.\nMore also might have been made of the book tests and the\n\u2022evidence for psychometry. But apart from this weakness the\nbook exhibits many highly commendable characteristics, and if\nonly the author successfully resists the omnipresent temptation to\naccept evidence upon other grounds than its own inherent solidity,\nAve may expect further and more detailed work from the same\npen which will remain of permanent value amidst the debris of\nforgotten scribbhngs which burden our shelves.\nE. J. Dingwall.\nII. From Agnosticism to Belief : An Account of Further Evidence for\nSurvival. By J. Arthur Hill. (Methuen & Co. 1924.\n7s. 6d. net.)\nThe author describes the progress of his mental attitude from\nagnosticism to belief in a spiritual world and a future life. He\na,lso states his opinions on various psychological, religious, and\nphilosophical problems which he has encountered on the way or\n1\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1924\ndiscerned from the farthest stage which he has reached. His\nconversion seems to have been due mainly to his experiences\nwith a single medium, Mr. Wilkinson, who has remarkable powers\nof clairvoyance and trance-speaking. Mr. Hill gives strong reasons\nfor considering that some veridical communications purporting ta\nbe given through this medium by the spirits of persons recently\ndeceased can be explained more satisfactorily as due to spiritistic\nagency than on any other basis. He admits that \" coercive\nproof \" of such an origin cannot be obtained, but he contends\nthat the facts were not within the medium's knowledge or revealed\nto him by telepathy. In some cases, he shows that they were\nnot within the knowledge of himself or of any person of his\nacquaintance. The possibility of telepathy from some distant\nmind, which has no connecting link with sitter or medium, makes\ntoo great a demand on his credulity and, as an explanation of\nthe phenomenon, is attended with the difficnlty of accounting for\nthe agency by which the facts are selected from the distant\nmind (page 90). In a later chapter on \" The Subconscious,\" he\nsuggests that we are \" all in connexion with each other in the\nsubliminal levels \" (page 148), but he does not discuss the bearing\nwhich this speculative proposition may have on the scope of\ntelepathy. He nowhere mentions the Theosophical doctrine of\nthe Akashic Record. In support of the spiritistic theory he relies\non the fact that there are other mediums, who have powers\nsimilar to those of Mr. Wilkinson and obtain equal results. He\nalso relies on the many records of apparitions as pointing in the\nsame direction, but he does not lay stress on physical phenomena,\nspirit photogTaphy, and the direct voice, chiefly because he does\nnot consider his experience on these lines to have been sufficient.\nPhysical phenomena in general do not seem to him to have\nmuch spiritualistic interest, for at the most they only prove the\nexistence of new forces. In this connection he might well have\ndiscussed the frequent cases in which the phenomena are accom-\npanied with communications purporting to come from the spirits\nresponsible for the manifestations. It is not always easy to ascribe\nsuch claims to subliminal dramatisation. On the whole, the basis for\nhis opinions seems rather narrow, the foundation might have been\nenlarged to embrace recorded observations of classes of allied pheno-\nmena. He sums up his case so moderately and fairly in pages\n178, 179, that one much regrets the omission to deal with som^e\n\fNov., 1924 Reviews 339\nexcluded questions, on which his opinion would have been read\nwith interest.\nHe discusses some psychological problems, as well as the contact\nbetween psychical research and religion, the difference between\nthe intuitional and scientific methods of seeking truth, the nature-\nof the after life and the scheme of evolution, without throwing new\nlight on these subjects. In the last chapter, \" Final Conclusions,\"'\nhe has recourse to the writings of Hebrew prophets, Omar\nKhayyam and Browning for his ideas and illustrations. He has\nreached what he calls a mild orthodoxy, a belief in a spiritual\nevolution in a friendly universe with dim consciousness of an all-\npervading God. It is an interesting and suggestive work writtea\nin a pleasant and easy style. . A. W. Trethewy.\nIII. A Magician Among the Spirits. By Houdini [pseud, i.e. Weiss^\nHarry].

Though Houdini's knowledge\nof psychical research may be most profound, he has successfully\nhidden this fact from the reader of A Magician Among the Spirits.\nAnd the historian of the future who has to refer to the \" impartial\nresults of many years of careful study \" (see advertisement), will\ndeserve all the pity he gets.\nWhen I opened the volume and found two pages of \" errata\nand addendum \" I feared the worst. Another two pages could\neasily be compiled. What are we to think of the claim {vide\njacket) that the book \" forms a valuable chapter in the crusade\nfor truth,\" when we are told that Crawford's book was \" pub-\nlished by David Gow \" (p. 177), and that the Crewe Photo-\ngraphers \" consist of \" Mr. Hope. Mrs. Buxton, Mrs. Deane, and\nMr. Vearnacombe \" [sic] (p. 123) ?\nHoudini tells us on page 63 that Mr. Dingwall had caught\nEusapia Palladino cheating and \" stated positively \" that he knew\nher to be a fraud. For the sake of posterity v,'e will inform Houdini\nthat Mr. Dingwall never saw Eusapia in his life, and that he is\nnot at all certain that she was always fraudulent. On page 128\nwe are told that Mr. Harry Price had a sitting with Mrs. Deane,\nwhereas the fact is that Mr. Price has never had a sitting with\n\f340 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov., 1924\nthis particular photographic medium. These are only a few of\nthe silly mis-statements in Houdini's \" crusade for truth,\" and\nnone of those mentioned has been corrected in the list of errata.\nWe are almost tempted to say with Macbeth :\n\" And be these\njugghng fiends no more believed \" !\nThere is an interesting chapter on Slade, and an alleged con-\nfession extracted from the slate-writing medium by a namesake of\nHoudini's\u2014Remigius Weiss. The \" confession \" is printed on\npage 99, but why this most important document has not been\nreproduced in facsimile is a mystery not elucidated by the author.\nAs there are no fewer that six portraits of Houdini scattered\nthroughout the pages, it is to be regretted that photography was\nnot brought in as a witness to this very strange \" confession.\"\nHoudini records (p. 20), another confes.sion by Ira, the survivor\nof the two Davenport brothers, that their \" phenomena \" were\nproduced \" by perfectly natural jneans.\"\nHoudini gravely warns us (p. 189) that \" not the least of the\nevils of Spiritualism is the insanity which it causes,\" and informs\nlis that an \" English doctor,\" wisely unnamed, \" has estimated\nthe number of such cases at a million.\" I am afraid that the\np)erusal of Houdini's book will not effect any cures.\nStudents of the \" nu speliug \" will find many choice examples\nin A Magician Among the Spirits.

(For plan, see Journal,\nNovember 1923, p. 151.)\nAt the extreme right is the note-taker's chair, and in front\nof it, the note-taker's table, on which are two rheostats for\nthe central inverted bowl lights and a box for taking notes,\ninternally illuminated through ruby glass. A little to the\nfront and to the left of the table is the gramophone, and\nbehind it, a camera on tripod. Above the camera and to\nthe right are two black switches, a maximum and minimum\nthermometer, and, just above, a double lamp bracket, with\none of the bulbs enclosed in a ruby shade. A similar attach-\nment can be seen on the left hand wall and both of these\nbrackets are controlled separately by sliding rheostats, one of\nwhich can be seen a little beneath and to the left of the\nthermometer. Each rheostat is fitted with a sliding scale\nattachment.\nThe cabinet curtains are black satin and slide on rollers\nalong a bow-shaped bar from corner to corner. Just within\nthe cabinet can be seen the medium's chair in the centre,\na little table for experiments, and in the ceiling one of the\nhooks for suspending scales. In front of the cabinet stands the\nmagnesium light apparatus, which is smokeless and adjustable.\nThe inverted bowl fitting, suspended from the ceiling just\nby the air grid, has been specially designed for this room\nand provides upward and downward motion, the bowl itself\nbeing detachable by means of two bayonet catches. Within\nthe bowl, which is enamelled white inside, are four lamps\non a separately-wired double series, two being of ruby glass\nand two of white glass, and all controlled at three different\npoints in the room.\nJust behind the arm-chair to the left is the sliding shutter\nwhich covers the window and effectually excludes light.\nHeating is provided by a couple of electric radiators, one of\nwhich can be seen behind the note-taker's table.

The case has been known to us for\nsome considerable time, and late in 1922, when the Society's\nResearch Officer, Mr. Dingwall, was preparing a general report\non psychic photography, it was decided to include this to-\ngether -with several others as deserving especial attention.\nCircumstances, however, made it impossible to carry out this\nscheme,^ and this case therefore is printed separately as it\nstands ; it is hoped to pubhsh another one of equal interest\nin due course. Mr. Dingwall has had a considerable corres-\npondence with Lady Grey, who is the principal witness in the\ncase.

I first heard of the Crewe Circle in\nthe winter of 1916. In the simimer of 1917 I went to Crewe,\nMr. Hope knowing my name, and I obtained photographs that\nshowed \" extra spirits,\" but nothing that we recognised as my\nson. I was naturally disappointed, but extremely interested, as\nwe thought we recognised two of the faces : and the Crewe Circle\nhad impressed me favourably, appearing honest, and showing no\ncuriosity ;\nthey asked no questions, and I had brought my own\npktes, signed them, and placed them in the slide. On my return\nhome, and later in the summer, I had a dream, in which my son\nsaid that he would go to Crewe with me and stand behind me,\nputting his hand on my left shoulder ; and he would try to get\niSee Journal, May 1923, p. 82; July 1923, 111-114.\n\f344 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1924\nphotographed doing this. My younger son, at my wish, wrote\nthis down, and in October he and I went to Crewe. Mr. Hope\nknew nothing of my dream ; the sitting took place exactly as the\nprevious one had, and the photograph of a hand on my shoulder\nwas on one of the six plates exposed on that occasion.^ Again\nI had brought my own plates.\nApart from the spiritistic hypothesis, it is interesting as evidence\nof some liind of supernormal activity. Perhaps it is a good case\nof thought photography, for it followed my dream; and possibly\nthe boy's presence helped, he having written down the dream\nand standing as witness to it. As an argument in favour of\nHope, if we take it as spirit photography, it may be said that\nhad he been fraudulent on this occasion it is a series of young\nmen's faces he would have tried to show on the plates, and not\na hand. Further, as there was a considerable lapse of time\nbetween my first sitting with him in July 1917 and my next in\nOctober of that year, he had ample opportunity to equip himself\nwith some photograph of my soldier son's face, either from the\nPress or some photographer, to work from fraudulently to this\nend.\nThere still stands, however, the objection that you may bring\nforward that, having told my family of my dream, I may\nhave told it to Hope. You have only my word that I did not\ndo so, but one might say against this that the bare fact of my\nhaving taken the precaution to get my younger son to write the\ndream down and date it, in the case of our obtaining good results\nat Crewe, is in itself some testimony to my anxiety to see this\nmatter through in order and with care.\nI did not want Hope to know anything about my dream, so that\nhis conscious mind might not bias the result, even though it\nwere supernormally, for I was eager for the facts to support the\nauthenticity of my dream.\nIt seems to me a case of interest, whether it stands either for\nthought-photography or spirit-return. ;\n-\nAs an argument for thought-photography we cannot close our\nminds '\nto the possibility of my own conscious mind and that of\nmy younger son influencing results, though supernormally.\nOn the other hand, I have another experience that came through\nPlate 2 shows the result of the sitting with apparently a left hand and\nwrist resting upon Lady Grey's left shoulder.\n\fDec, 1924 Cases 345\nthe channel of a dream that would stand in support of the\nspiritistic hypothesis.

Please look it up, if it is not too much trouble ?\nI think it provides unusually good evidence, cunningly contrived\nto meet the objection of telepathy from the living.\nI hope you will forgive my writing at such length, but I think\nyou should know all there is about this case.\nYours truly,\n(Sgd.)

A Eemaekable Case of Vision op the Dying.\nBy Sir William Barrett, F.E.S.\nThe evidence of Visions of the Dying, when they appear to\nsee and recognize some of their relatives of whose decease\nthey were unaware, aiJords perhaps one of the strongest\narguments in favour of survival. I have given some striking\ninstances of these visions of the dying in my book, On the\nThresJiold of the Unseen, and other cases will be found iu\nthe Proceedings of our Society. Even Prof. Richet states\nthat he regards these facts as very important, and more\nexpKcable by the spiritist theory than by cryptsesthesia, and\nhe adds that \" Among all the facts adduced to prove survival,\nthese [visions of the dying] seem to me to be the most\ndisquieting,\" i.e. from his own (materialistic) point of view.\nWe must, however, remember that hallucinations of the\ndying are not infrequent. Expectancy may possibly account\nfor these ; the dying person being under the hallucination he\nor she has seen some deceased relatives. Hence the chief\nevidential value of these visions depends on conclusive proof\nthat the dying person was wholly ignorant of the decease of\nthe person he or she saw. The importance of the case I\nam about to narrate is enhanced, from the extraordinary\ncare taken to prevent any knowledge of the illness or death\n^See The Earthen Vessel, p. 79.\n\f346 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. dec, 1924\nof the person, whose vision was seen, reaching the percipient.\nThe present case was related to me by Lady Barrett ; it\noccurred when she was in attendance on a patient in the\nMothers' Hospital at Clapton, of which she is the Obstetric\nSurgeon.\nLady Barrett, in January last, received an urgent message\nfrom the Resident Medical Officer, Dr. Phillips, to come to a\npatient, Mrs. B., who was in labour and suffering from serious\nheart failure. Lady Barrett went at once, and the child\nwas delivered safely, though the mother was dying at the\ntime. After seeing other patients Lady Barrett went back\nto Mrs. B.'s ward, and the following conversation occurred,\nwhich Lady Barrett wrote down on her return home :\nWhen I entered the ward,\u2014Lady Barrett says,\u2014Mrs. B. held\nout her hands to me and said :\n\" Thank you, thank you for\nwhat you have done for me,\u2014for bringing the baby. Is it a\nboy or girl 1\n\" Then holding my hand tightly, she said :\n\" Don't\nleave me, don't go away, will you ?\n\" And after a few minutes,\nwhile the House Surgeon carried out some restorative measures,\nshe lay looking up towards the open part of the room which\nwas brightly lighted, and said :\n\" Oh, don't let it get dark,\n\u2014\nit's getting so dark, \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 darker and darker.\" After a few\nmoments she looked up again with a radiant smile and said :\n\" Oh, lovely,\u2014lovely.\" \" What is lovely ? \" I asked, \" What I see,\"\nshe replied. I said :\n\" What do you see ?\n\" She repHed :\n\" Oh,\nlovely brightness,\u2014wonderful beings. Oh, light, beautiful bright-\nness.\" Then looking steadily towards one place for a few moments\nshe said :\n\" Why, it's Father ! Oh, he's so glad I'm coming,\nhe is so glad. Oh, it is lovely, if only P. (her husband) could\ncome too.\" Her father had died some time previously.\nShe welcomed her husband, who had been sent for, and spoke\nof \" Our Baby \" to him. The baby was brought for her to see\nand she said :\n\" Perhaps for Baby's sake I might stay, but Oh !\nthe lovely brightness.\" To her husband she said :\n\" You won't\nlet Baby be put out to anyone who won't love him, will you ?\n\"\nThen she gently pushed him to one side saying :\n\" Let me see\nthe lovely brightness,\" and shortly afterwards she died, smiling\nhappily.\nDr. Phillips who was present, after reading the above notes,\n\fDec, 1924 Cases 347\nwrites to me saying that she \" fully agrees with Lady Barrett's\naccount.\"\nThe most important evidence is, however, given by the'\nMatron of the Hospital, to whom I wrote, and who has sent\nme the following account :\n\" I was present shortly before the death of Mrs. B., together\nwith her husband and her mother. Her husband was leaning\nover her and speaking to her, when pushing him aside she said :\n\" Oh, don\"t hide it, it's so beautiful.\" Then turning away from\nhim towards me, I being on the other side of the bed, Mrs. B.\nsaid :\n\" Oh, why there's Vida,\"' referring to a sister of whose\ndeath three weeks previously she had not been told. Afterwards\nthe mother, who was present at the time, told me (as I have\nsaid) that Vida was the name of a dead sister of Mrs. B.'s, of\nwhose illness and death she was quite ignorant, as they had care-\nfully kept this news from Mrs. B. owing to her serious illness.\n(Signed) Miriam Castle,\nMatron^\nI asked Dr. Phillips to try and obtain the independent\nreport of Mrs. B.'s mother, who, as the Matron stated, was\nalso present at the time. This was kindly done, and I have\nreceived the following interesting and informative letter from\nMrs. Clark (Mrs. B.'s mother), with whom also I had an inter-\nview subsequently :\nHighbury. N. 5.\nI have heard you are interested in the beautiful passing of\nmy dear daughter's spirit from this earth on the 12th day of\nJanuary, 1924.\nThe wonderful part of it is the history of the death of my\ndear daughter, Vida, who had been an invalid some years. Her\ndeath took place on the 2.5th day of December, 1923, just two\nweeks and four days before her younger sister, Doris, died. My\ndaughter Doris (Mrs. B.) was very ill at that time, and the\nMatron at the Mothers' Hospital deemed it unwise for Mrs. B.\nto know of her sister's death. Therefore when visiting her we\nput off our mourning and visited her as usual. All her letters\nwere also kept by request until her husband had seen who they\nmight be from, before letting her see them. This precaution was\ntaken lest outside friends might possibly allude to the recent\n\f348 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli.

My dear child said :\n\" Oh, it is lovely and bright ;\nyou cannot see as I can.\" She fixed her eyes on one particular\nspot in the ward, saying :\n\" Oh God, forgive me for any thing\nI have done wrong.\" After that she said : \"I can see Father, he\nwants me, he is so lonely.\" She spoke to her Father saying :\n\" I am coming,\" turning at the same time to look at me,\nsaying :\n\" Oh, he is so near.\" On looking at the same place\nagain, she said, with rather a puzzled expression :\n\" He has Vida\nwith him,\" turning again to me saying :\n\" Vida is with him.\"\nThen she said :\n\" You do want me, Dad, I am coming.\" Then\na very few parting words or sighs were expressed, nothing very\ndefinite or clear.

He heard about the\nvision from Mrs. Clark just after it had taken place, and\nbriefly narrates the fact in the Parish Magazine he sent me,\nemphasising the great care the mother and other relatives had\ntaken, to prevent any news of the illness and death of the\nsister, whose vision was seen, reaching Mrs. B.\nThe Rev.

Two Cases of Co-incidental Dreams.\nWe print below a report of a case in which two persons\n\u2014\nhusband and wife\u2014dreamt very similar dreams on the same\nnight. A first account of the incident was given to the\nsecretary, Miss Newton, in conversation by Mr. B. Jordan-\nSmith, one of the dreamers and a Member of the Society.\nSubsequently Mr. Jordan-Smith wrote to Miss Newton as\nfollows :\n-\n2nd March, 24.\nFurther to my conversation with you on Tuesday afternoon\nlast, I enclose you statement of two dreams experienced the\nsame morning by myself and wife on the 11th February, 1924,\nand related at breakfast time.\nI may, however, mention that on awakening I generally go\nover the details of any such dreams that strike me, with a\nview to relating or recording later. If the dream is very marked\nI generally make a shorthand note of it in a note-book kept\nat the bedside. I did not, however, make such a note of this\nparticular dream until both were related at breakfast time about\n8.45 a.m.\nThere is just the possibility in this case of a telepathic im-\npression being received of my dream by Mrs. Smith, as I generally\nawaken first. Otherwise it seems to support Mrs. Henry Sidgwick's\nsuggestion on telepathy that you mentioned. B. Jordan-Smith.\nWith this letter was enclosed the following statement\n:\nDream.\nB. Jordan-Smith. 11-2-24. 7 a.m.\nI awoke from a dream about 7 a.m., as follows,\n\u2014\" That Annie\n^ Any mothei'S who read this narrative will be sure to ask what has become\nof the baby? When it was a few mouths old the grandmother, Mrs. Clark,\nasked to have charge of it. She most tenderly cared for it until the husband,\n]VIr. B., insisted on taking it to his own home. This could not be prevented,\nbut, lacking the care and attention the delicate babe had hitherto received, it\nlanguished and died. . . :\n\f350 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1924\n(Mrs. B. J.-S.) was cuddliug to her face a long necked bird,\na sort of a cross between a turkey and a pheasant. Its beak\nand head was rubbing Annie's eyes (mostly left eye). I was\najjprehensive that it might damage the eyes with its beak, and\nI said,\n\u2014\" be careful of your eyes.\" Annie said something about\nit would be alright.\nI related this at breakfast time about 8-45 a.m. to Mrs. Jordan-\nSmith, when she remarked she had a dream early this morning\nabout a swan and her eyes as follows :\nDream. .\nMrs. A.

I kept quiet, and said to Ben, \" I suppose it could\nhurt me.\" Ben said, \" Oh rather ! it could have your eyes out.\"\nA correct statement.\nA. Jordan-Smith.\nB. Jordan-Smith.\nL. 1262.\nWe also print another case of two co-incidental dreams in\nwhich, one of the- dreamers was Miss Ann Jofies, as she has\nbeen called. Eeports of some of Miss Jones' earlier experiences\nhave been sent to us and three of them will be found in\nMrs. Sidgwick's paper Phantasms of the Living [Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. XXXIII., pp. 317, 330 and 352). It will be noticed\nthat the dreams occurred some time ago in December, 1919.\nA verbal report of them was given by Miss Jones to the\nEditor, Mrs. Salter, very shortly afterwards and the written\naccounts, printed below, were enclosed in a letter written\nto Mrs. Salter by Miss Jones on March 9, 1920. The case\nwas held back at the time as it was hoped that further\nevidence might be obtained in regard to another similar case\nin which Miss Jones was concerned, and the two cases could\nthen be printed together. It has not, however, been possible\nto obtain this evidence and the present seems a favourable\n\fDec, 1924 Cases 351\nopportunity to print the case. The friend to whom Miss\nJones related her dream on the day of its occurrence\u2014whose\ncorroborative statement is printed below\u2014is the Mr. M. who\nwas concerned in the case which Mrs. Sidgwick relates on\np. 330 of her paper.\nStatement by Miss Ann Jones.\n(Enclosed in letter to Mrs. Salter, dated March 3rd, 1920.)\nI was staying in my rooms at on the morning of Tuesday,\nDec. 29, 1919. I was awakened from an unusually deep sleep\nat 7.45 by the woman who calls me every morning. I sat up\nin bed and was aware of her movements in the room, but was\nunable to reply to her customary remarks on account of a vision\nof Heaven closing in the shape of an immense dark-blue-purple-\nviolet globe with a segment still open from which a radiance\nof light and music was coming towards me. As the light and\ncolour faded the beat of the music became more intense. Finally\nI made an effort to arouse myself, and turned from the side\nof the room where I had been seeing the vision to get out of\nbed. I saw standing on a mirror over the fireplace a small\nwhite toy elephant which I had bought some weeks earlier as\na Christmas present for a child, but had not given away. The\nsight of this toy completely banished the effect of light and music\nand I was awake. I spoke to no one of the experience until\nlate that afternoon when Mr. [M.] came to see me. I then told\nhim this story with special reference to the heavily stressed nature\nof the music. He left the house before 6 o'clock and my sister\nE. did not arrive from Stepney until after 6.30. She had not\nmet him on the way. [Ann Jones.]\nStatement by Miss E. Joyies.\nAt Loughton, in Essex, on the morning of Tuesday, 29th\nDecember, 1919, I dreamt I saw my sister [Ann] walking up\na slight incline and disappearing into a mound. This I knew\nto be Heaven. I stood watching for a few moments, when she\nre-appeared from round the back of the mound, this time in\nthe shape of three small white elephants, which moved briskly,\nin single file, down the incline towards me. I was wondering\nin what fashion to address my sister in her triplicate form,\nwhen I awoke with a start to find it was 7.4-5 in the morning.\nI spent the whole day in Stepney, and in the evening went\n\f352 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1924\nto [Miss Ann Jones' lioiise], arriving there about 6.30 p.m.\nIt was not until some hours later that I suddenly remembered\nthe dream and related it to my sister.\nE. [Jones.]\nIn her covering letter of March 9, 1920, Miss A^m Jones\nsays :\nShe [Miss E. Jones] told me at the time that she'd been called\nat 7.30 and fell asleep till 7.50.\nIn reply to a letter from Mrs. Salter asking whether he\ncould give an account of the dream related to him by Miss\nAnn Jones on December 29th, Mr. M. wrote as follows :\nFeb. 26, 1920.\n. . . Such is my memory now that try as I may I cannot\nclearly recall the dream [Ann] told me, though I remember it\nbeing told very well. I think there was some small figure came\nin at the end of it. . . .\nW M .\nIt will be noted that although Mr. M. was unfortunately\nnot able to remember the details of the dream, he was able\nto corroborate the fact that it had been related to him.\nTHE RESEARCH OFFICER.\nThe Research Officer v\/ill be absent from England from the\nmiddle of December until probably early in February. Cor-\nrespondence will not be forwarded.\nTHE MEDIUM WILLI SCHNEIDER.\nThe Society has recently had the opportunity of having a\nseries of sittings with the young Austrian medium, Willi\nSchneider, who has visited England at the Society's invitation.\nSome striking results have been obtained under exceptional\nconditions of control, and a full report will appear later in the\nProceedings.\n\fDec, 1924 Brain and Speech 353\nBEAIN Am) SPEECH.\nBy Captain Quentin C. A. Craufurd, R.N., A.M.I.B.E.\nSir Oliver Lodge's article on Brain and Speech has encouraged\nme to offer a contribution to his argument from a point of view\nthat I hope may be original\nIt has been rather a hobby of mine to study the methods by\nwhich animals communicate their thoughts. I think it is pretty\ngenerally supposed that animals converse in some kind of a lan-\nguage, but I have not found much evidence of this, and I am\ninclined to think that they naturally use speech in any form very\nlittle.\nOf course, if we teach them to use our method of communi-\ncating thought we introduce human methods, but the fascinating\nthing to study is their method.\nFirst of all do not let us put a fictitious value on speech.\nSpeech is not thought, it is not even the expression of thought*\nIt is a convention by which we endeavour to stimulate thoughts\nin others by famihar sounds. It is impossible to awaken a thought\nthat is not already dormant in the brain, and before an audience\ncan catch the meaning of something put forward each one must\n\" have ears to hear.\" This means that each hearer must be\ncapable of translating what he hears into common sense.\nNow we have such a thing as thought-transference along Unes\nthat are unfamiliar. We may suppose brain waves to exist, but\nwe have no proof of them. Let us call them brain waves for\nthe purposes of this article, and for want of a better name.\nI assume that these brain waves do nothing else than stimulate\ncertain centres or whirlpools of thought. Consequently, I have\nno difficulty in allowing the possibihty of brain waves from animals.\nAnd the assumption has been fruitful. I have on many occasions\ntraced the stimulation of thought to animal friends.\nLet me give an instance. WhOe I write there is a little\nsparrow playing about on my shoulder, absolutely fearless and\nwith no apparent desire to join his own people. He is very\nyoung, and no doubt he will leave me in the near future. Why ?\nInstinct ! Nonsense ! His instinct, whatever be meant by that\nword, taught him to avoid me when he fell out of the nest. I\nthink he wiU leave me on account of slanderous and ill-natured\n\f354 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1924\nthoughts put into his mind by his own race. They mistrust me,\nand he certainly does not.\nThe roundabout methods of getting at an idea which Sir Oliver\nLodge so well illustrated in Brain and Speech seem to me to\nsupply the clue. The other sparrows will never use any term that\nrelates to me as a benefactor, simply because they do not know\nthat I have tended and fed this little youngster and can have no\nconception of me in that light, and my experience is that directly\nhe begins to associate with them and imbibe their ideas he will\ngo. Again, my experience teaches me that if I want to keep\nhim I have to act. I have to endeavour to make him form an\nidea, and what that idea is it is absolutely impossible for me to\nknow, for it is a sparrow's image and not a human one.\nThe nearest I can get to it is \" that which I (the sparrov^)\nlike.\" And I have found that no amount of affection and care\non my part will necessarily create such an image, it must be\nformed in the little animal mind. Strangely enough, the surest way\nto xim this animal loyalty, or if you like to call it so\u2014love\u2014is\nto pretend to be indifferent, occupied with other things. If you\nobserve animals making friends, this is their way. It creates, if\nI may so express it, a vacuum, a vacancy in .thought, which the\ndesire to be noticed fills with its own ideal. This is all very\nhuman on the purely natural side, and almost any daughter of\nEve is well acquainted with its power, though she would probably\nexpress it in very dif!erent words. But this, or something of this\ndescription is, I believe, the clue.\nSo far I have been putting forward a theory from the animal\nside, but it is time to come to the effect of animal influence upon\na human brain. In dealing with little wild animals one is far\nmore successful in trusting to one's own instinct, or rather the\nthought of the moment, than in appealing to ordinary reason.\nI am going to propose that these thoughts of the moment are\nvery often akin to transference of thought. Careful observation of\ncoincidences in an enormous number of trials lead one to this\nconclusion. I will take an instance of this same little sparrow.\nI had to feed him with a match to do duty for his mother's\nbeak and bread and milk. At first he would not offer his mouth.\nThere came into my mind a happy thought. I do not know how\nto describe it, and must adopt a roundabout phrase or rather\nparagraph in order to communicate the idea :\n\fDec, 1924 Brain and Speech 355\n\" When mother comes to feed me she suddenly enters where the\nlight is.\"\nI am sorry I cannot do better than that; it is not true. The\nwords as I have put them never came to me at all. Yet it\nwoiild be also untrue to say that I saw a picture of the nest and\nthe mother arriving and blocking out the light. But I got it\n\u2014\nthe idea\u2014in a flash, and it v^as correct.\nI moved my hand suddenly instead of very gently as I had\ntried before, also I moved it so as to block out much of the light.\nInstantly the little mouth was all agape, and from that moment\nI had no further difficulty ; I had come into contact with some-\nthing understood.\nNow it would be far easier for me to claim that I had reasoned\nthis out, and I am sure it would make much better reading, but\nit would not be true.\nAgain I will give an instance of thought-transference from this\nsame little subject.\nI am sorry to have to confess that I neglected to think. The\nlittle bird had to be fed at early dawn and the bread and milk\nhad become very dry, but being sleepy that did not worry me at\nall. In fact, I never gave the matter a moment's thought. I\nwoke up with the first cry of the little mite, crammed it witJi\nfood and dropped off into the state of dreams.\nOne particular dream persisted. I saw a stork which I knew\nwas really a flamingo in the marshes which abound in the Sahara\ndesert. The stork which was really a flamingo I knew to be my\nlittle guest the sparrow, and also I knew the reeds growing in the\nmarshes were in reality my shaving brush. The dream evaporated\nas dreams do, while I gradually wakened to the fact that the little\nbird was extremely thirsty.\nBut how did I know this was the meaning of the dream ?\nThat is a secret which is difficult to discover.\nThe chief point was that the little bird was exceedingly thirsty,\nbut it required a certain amount of conviction to make me get\nout of bed at that time of the morning and go and get water\nfrom the bottle, which happened to have the shaving brush leaning\nup against it, giving an enlarged view of the bristles like reeds\ngrowing in the water.\nWe have many curious things here, some of which I can explain,\nbut the outstanding point for the present is the fact that the bird\n\f356 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Dec, 1924:\nwas very thirsty, that he was appealing to me for relief and that\nI got the message. That the message formed itself in my brain\nin a \" roundabout way \" is another matter.\nThe point is my inner consciousness perfectly well understood.\nI do not claim for a moment that I would have understood if\nI had been awake. I should probably have got the message\nand taken no notice of it because I would, ten chances to one,\nhave been thinking of something definite.\nI take it that definite thought blots out vague impressions such\nas thought-transference, at any rate for the time being, though\nwe may stumble upon the message at a later moment, finding it\nHke an isolated footprint in a frequented garden and believing\nit to be our own. For perhaps the brain may be compared to a\nsort of garden in which ideas grow from seeds and contribute\nthoughts founded upon memorial seeds, which are the memory.\nAnd when I say seeds, I mean literally some kind of nucleus\nformed by an impression or minute injury to the brain tissues.\nThought-transference would scarcely go so far as to injure the\nbrain and create a memory, though the recipient might create\nsuch a permanent record by his own act.\nSo I liken the impact of an outside thought to a footprint and\nour own idle fancies that leave no record to footprints of our own.\nNow watch the process of the transference of thought from this\nlittle sparrow. No one else may find the key, but searching my\nown memory I can find it without difficulty. Allow me to\ncontinue my simile of the garden. I find thoughts about thirst\nplanted long ago when first I passed through the Suez Canal.\nThe desert produced mirages and away in the distance there\nappeared to be innumerable marshes. I deliberately thought of\nthe tales I had heard about men dying of thirst being encouraged\nby these mirages. While looking at them a number of flamingoes\nflew out of the reeds on the right bank of the Canal. It was\nthe first time I had seen flamingoes in the wild state. They\nwent off in the direction of the mirage. Their legs trailing away\nbehind them brought up a magic-lantern picture I had seen as\na small child. It was a flight of storks bringing babies as presents\nto various mothers :\n\u2014a German notion, I believe. Now, my\nlittle baby sparrow fallen out of the nest with his absurd long\nlegs trailing out has a connection here. In that same magic-lantern\ndisplay on Christmas long ago the slide which most took my\n\fDec, 1924 Brain and Speech 357\nfancy was a comic one of a German with a shaving brush ; it was\none of those moving slides and was real magic to me.\nThe coincidence of the shaving brush seen through the water\nbottle I cannot explain. It was after the dream and may have\nno connection. AVe can wipe it off the slate for the purposes of\nthis article.\nNow we see the action of the brain. It clothed the idea of\nthirst in memory images from that part of the garden where the seeds\nof the voyage through the Suez Canal lay.\nIt might have clothed the idea of thirst in myriads of other\nmemory forms, but in this instance it chose that particular part\nof the garden. I shall not try to account for this apparent\nlocality in the brain just now, but I may express it by saying\nI happened to be walking in that particular part of the garden\njust then. Or if you like it better, my consciousness happened\nto be inhabiting that particular part of the brain.\nBut the idea of a garden is to my mind an old one\u2014as old\nas the story of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Paradise.\nHere then the little sparrov>r met me on the threshold of the\nsubliminal world, and, knowing me as its protector, asked for drink.\nThis surely is beyond our three dimensional world where sparrows\nare classified as a group of automatons. It seems to me to be\nin that region where Sir Oliver Lodge found his dog still living\nand Rider Haggard became acquainted with his dog's accident\n;\na spiritual world or a place of unknown dimensions where life\ndoes not require material to manifest itself.\nNow this absurd dream is just an example of the manner in which\nknowledge filters imperfectly through the brain and forms images\nthrown together in a ridiculous manner. Are we to be surprised\nthen if communications from disembodied spirits come clothed in\nabsurd garments on occasion ?\nThe grave man of science can present equally absurd pictures\nof his thoughts. He can appear absolutely ridiculous. Indeed, to\nsome minds he presents no other picture and we get the creation\nof an image of the Professor of our comic papers.\nScientific Thought is not really a ridiculous thing, it is the\nblending of two points of view that gives us the caricature.\nWhen advanced thought crosses orthodox teaching it invariably\ncreates ridicule and distorted ideas. The history of discovery is\nfull of such things. Hence it is not only speech which is unable\n\f358 Journal of Society for PsycJncal Research Dec, 1924\nto disentangle itself from what Sir Oliver Lodge calls a roundabout\nidea when the brain is not properly awake, but the brain even\nin waking life acquires new knowledge by approaching it in a\nroundabout way.\nWe can afford to be warned by the ridicule with which our\nforbears clothed new ideas, ideas which to our generation are\nalmost self-evident facts. There were not a much larger proportion\nof unreasonable men among our forefathers ; it v\/as merely that\nthey were unable to absorb the novelty, to interpret it in terms of\nordinary experience. If they did so, it appeared a ridiculous image.\nSurely then the impact of truth from an outside, unexpected or\nunrecognised source, musi make its appearance in the form of a\ncaricature.\nKEVIEWS.\nI. Die Theosophie {Anthroposophie) in Psychologischer Beurteilung.\nBy Albert Sichler. J. F. Bergmann, Munich and Wiesbaden,\n1921. Pp. 45.\nThis little work belongs to a series more or less popular, of\nmonographs on \" border land questions \" of nervous and psychic\nlife, in which it forms No. 112. It makes a gallant attempt\nto convey to the German public some idea of the Theosophical\nmovement, started by Helena Blavatsky, and of the \" anthroposophy\n\"\ndeveloped out of it by Rudolf Steiner. Both movements are\ntreated with respect as philosophies, though their psychology is\ncriticized ; and hardly any stress is laid on the frauds which have\naccompanied the history of Theosophy. Nor does it seem an\ninsuperable objection to Mr. Sichler that both doctrines should\nbe entirely composed of the arbitrary assertions of their authors,\nfor whjch no shadow of proof is offered. Altogether, he must\nbe a very charitable man. This characteristic is also indicated\nby his readiness to swallow Freud's psycho-analysis and Indian\n\" Yoga,\" which he considers far superior to \" theosophy.\" They\nmay be, but a little regard for the methods of scientific proof\nwould add to the credibility of both of them, as of \" theosophy\n\"\nand \" anthroposophy.\" F.

William\nRider and Son, Ltd. 5s. net.\nMr. Besterman's painstaking compilation describes the various\n\fDec, 1924 Revieivs 359\nmethods of scrying, reviews the history of the practice in many\ncountries\u2014quoting many curious passages from the by-ways of\nliterature, ancient and modern\u2014and finally deals with the scientific\nside, quoting Miss G-oodrich-Freer, Mr Andrew Lang, and other\nS.P.R. investigators. The author's general conclusion is that\n\" scrying is a method of bringing into the consciousness of the\nscryer by means of a speculum through one or more of his senses\nthe content of his subconsciousness, of rendering him more sus-\nceptible to the reception of telepathically transmitted concepts,\nand of bringing into operation a latent and unknown faculty of\nperception \"\n(p. 160).\nThe book is of interest to the anthropologist and folklorist\nrather than to the psychical researcher, for it gives no new\nfacts, the author's experiments having yielded nothing worthy\nof inclusion ; but it will be a useful reference volume for anyone\nwho takes up this branch of investigation and wishes to know\nsomething of its history.

The interest aroused by the earlier\nwork has opened up new channels of \" automatic \" activity, and\nin the present volume the author has been able to avail himself\nof scripts received through three automatists new to this particular\nsubject, namely a lady called \" S.,\" Mr. Philip Lloyd and Mrs.\nTravers Smith. The last named is, of course, well known in\nconnection with the recently published \" Oscar Wilde \" Scripts.\nAs the sub-title indicates, the author deals mainly with the\nscript emanating from and through the communicator called\n\" Brother Symon,\" who claims to be in some fashion rein-\ncarnated in the automatist \" S.\" The period of history covered\nis from the earliest times to the destruction of the Abbey by\nfile in 1184. The documentary evidence for this period is very\nslight, and the remains on the site of the Abbey are necessarily\nscanty. Independent sources, to which the automatists are stated\nto have had no access, bear out some of the statements made\n\f360 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1924\nin the scripts, but it is not likely that future research will en-\nable verification to be carried as far as was possible in the case\nof \" The Gate of Remembrance \" scripts. The statements (illus-\ntrated with automatic drawings) that the original settlement was-\na \" hut circle,\" are very interesting, but not all his readers will'\nbe able to agree with Mr. Bond's interpretation of the data\nin terms of transcendental mathematics.\nThe author, in this book, shows himself more inclined than\nhe was in 1918 to accept the ''\nscript intelligences \" at their\nown valuation, and he boldly develops some of their statements\nin the direction of speculative theory.\nThe author gives us some information, perhaps as much as\nhe can, about the automatist \" S.\" She has always been in-\nterested in monks (page 13, footnote), and her control is \" Brother\nSymon.\"' Is her interest in monks a cause or an effect of\n\" Brother Symon \" ? The reader whose mind is not already\nmade up will find this a very difficult question to answer.\nTo those who are eager for \u2022\nmore, Mr. Bond holds out a hope\nof a further book. He does not appear to have had time yet\nto make a complete collation of the various scripts, and we\nlook forward with lively anticipation to the next volume of this\nextraordinary series. G-. W.
