[Aug., 18815.\nRETRACTATIONS AYD ALTERATIONS OF VIEW.\nThe following are the remarks which Mr. E. Gurney made on this\nsubject at the last General Meeting:-\nSomething was said at the last Meeting implying that the Committee\nappointed to investigate phenomena connected with the Theosophical\nSociety had, in their conclusions, to some extent retracted what had\nbeen said in their First Report. But I think it must be clear to any\ncandid reader of the First Report that what the Committee did in it\nwas this-to define, on their then imperfect knowledge, what were the\nquestions which further knowledge might enable them to determine,\nand which, as they think, they have now on their further knowledge\ndetermined. The only point where they expressed a definite view\nwhich they have altered was in connection with Colonel Olcott, as so\nfully explained in Mr. Hodgson's Report.\nI say this not from any desire to Juke out or imply an\ninvariable consistency in our published Reports. Psychical research\nis eminently a department in which workers ha,-e to learn as they\nproceed. And I may take the present opportunity of mentioning that\nthere are several points in which we think that the increase of our stock of\ninformation has led us to Ilo more corrf>Ct view as to what can be properly\nput forward as evidence for telepathy, and what cannot; with the result\nthat several cases which we have no reason to suppose inaccurately\nreported, and which we have published as supporting the telepathic\nargument,do not now seem to us fairly to do so. I maymention especially\nthe cases where the percipient,at the time of seeing the phantasmal figure\nor hearing the phantasmal voice, has been in a state of anxiety with\nregard to the person whom we regarded as the agent. In some of these\ncases we have not made sufficient allowance for the possihility that the\nstate of the percipient might have generated a purely subjecth-e phan-\ntasm. That mere anxiety is a condition adequate to produce a definite\nvisual hallucination in a waking person is, it is true, very far from\nbeing a self-evident proposition. The assertion has often been loosely\nmade; just so has the assertion that cold lobster is an adequate condi-\ntion often been loosely made; but in neither case have proofs been\nforthcoming. Now this illustrates the importance of making a very\nlarge collection of purelysubjectin or pathologic hallucinations, as lVell\nas of alleged telepathic cases. A very large collection has been gradu-\nally amassed, and in it I do not find a single case of hallucination due\nto indigestion; but I do find material from which it may, I think, fairly\nbe argued that the nervous strain of anxiety is occasionally able to\ngenerate hallucination of the senses. Consequently we shall feel bound\nin future to exclude from the evidence for telepathy all, or nearly all,\nthe cases where this condition is shown or may fairly be inferred to\nDigitized by Google\n\fAug., 1885.] Journal qf Societ!lfor PS!lchical Re&earch. 3\n------------------\nbve been present. If the effect on the senses of the percipient can be\ndue to a subjective emotion such as anxiety, we should not feel justified\n{unless in very exceptional circumstances) in seeking or assuming any\nfurther cause for it in the state of an absent person.\nThere are, however, two (and only two) of our published accounts\nwhere we have to acknowledge error of a different sort. In these, it is\nno longer a matter of our own misinterpretation of facts; but we have\nlearnt, since publishing the cases, that the facts were misreported to\nbegin with-that there has been exaggeration or inaccuracy on the partof\nour informants, of a sort that (in one case, at any rate) fundamentally\naffects the evidence.\nThe first instance is that of Sir E. Hornby, who told us of a\n-certain death as having occurred coincidentally with a vision of\nbis own; whereas the death was afterwards asserted, by a person\napparently acquainted with the facts, to have occurred at least\nthree months previously. Sir E. Hornby at once admitted-with\n-complete candour-that if this assertion turned out to be true, his\nmemory must have played him the most extraordinary trick. We then\ndid what I take blame to myself for not thinking of before the case\nwas published-searched the files of Chinese newspapers at the British\nMuseum; we found that the critic's assertion was correct, and that the\nman did die three months before Sir E. Hornby supposed. And the\ncase, as recorded, thus completely breaks down.\nThe second instance is thllot of Mr. X. Z. (Proceedi.ngs, Vol. I.,\np. 106.) The account of his examining the parish register, and finding\nthere the record of the two deaths-the murder and thp. suicide-as\nhaving occurred in 179-, is entirely wrong. 'Ve have now done\nwhat we ought to have done before-had the rt'gister searched; and we\nfind no record of the sort at all. We have ascertained otherwise that\na. former owner of the house did commit suicide, but not in this house,\nand, moreover, not till 1809, and in May instead of September. l\\Ir.\nX. Z. further told us that he went with a friend to calion the landlord\nin London, on which occasion the portrait of the apparition was\nrecognised; but he proves to have been wrong as to the friend with\nwhom he went; and the friend who, as he now tells us, accompa.nied\nhim, is dead. These inaccuracies do not, it is true, affect the account\nof the a.pparition itself, but they greatly weaken the evidence for its\nobjective origin. Moreover, a narrative which is so far proved inac-\ncurate is clearly not one that could properly be used for evidential\npurposes.\nIn cases of this sort, where flaws are discovered in accounts which\nhave been given us in perfect good faith, what we have done and what\nwe propose to do in future, is this-to withdraw the narrative, with an\nadmission of its incorrectness. For instance, in the second edition o(\nDigitized by Google\n\f4 Journal of Societyfor P8!1ciliCaI Re8earciJ. [Aug., 188.',.\nthe number of the Proueding, where Sir E. Hornby's story appeared,\nanother case was substituted, with a note to state that the rejected\nevidence had broken down on the fundamental point of dates; and a.\nsimilar explanation was given in the Jourrwl. The same course will be\npursued with regard to Mr. X. Z.'s story, as to which the facts just.\nmentioned have only been ascertained within the last few weeks. We\nthink that this treatment answers the requirements of the position~\nwithout causing unnecessary annoyance to a perfectly bondfole witness.\nIt is, of course, otherwise in cases of fraud.\nMARGINS.\nI fear that the apparent difference of opinion between my courteous\ncritic \"C. C. M.\" and myself must be due to defective expression on my\npart, for I entirely agree with him that if a phenomenon can be shown\nto lie in the margin between what is known to be possible aud what is\nclearly impossible, so far as recognised causes are concerned, we have an\nunexplained fact--more or less unexplained according to the extent to\nwhich it goes beyond known possibilities. But such an unexplained\nfact, in my view, is the starting-point of psychical research, not the\nconclusion at which it seeks to arrive: to prove the presence of a new\nagency it must, I contend, go further j it must go beyond the unex\u00b7\nplained to the inexplicable.\nNo rule can, however, be laid down for determining the reasonable\nmargin, and the task is especially difficult when we cannot reduce the\nquestion to an alternative between a definitely known cause and the\nunknown, but are in doubt as to what known agencies may have\noperated unperceived.\nAn illustration of what I mean is afforded by our study of the\n\"willing-game.\" Before it was known from experience that muscular\nindications could be given and taken unconsciously to the extent re-\nquired to explain the willing-game, it was recognised by our inquirers\nthat this might be possible, and that consequently experiments in\nthought-transference with contact between agent and percipient, could\nnot prove telepathy. And their caution was soon justified; for Mr.\nSugden and others showed that such unconscious muscular indications\nare given, and ca!l__be consciously interpreted.\nE. M.

We o.re now able to add an im-\nportant confirmation of part of tho.t o.ccount. The following is 0. slightly\nabridged translation of a. letter written in Ita.lia.n by Demetrio Volterra.,\nCount Crissoplevri, to Dr. Nicolas, Count Gonemys, o.nd do.ted, Zante\n7th (19th) June, 1885.\nHonoured Sir and Doctor,-I am in receipt of your letter of the 3rd\n(15th), and hasten to reply thereto. My wife, my son Anastasio, and I can\nall testify that the mesmeric cure which you effected of my son in the year\n1869 appeared no leas than a miracle, and made a great sensation in our\ncountry, since the nervous malady under which my son suffered was so\nviolent that all the doctors in Zante, called into consultation, were unable to\nunderstand or relieve it, and absolutely despaired of a recovery. .At that\ntime you arrived at Zante as officer of health (medico militate), and I begged\nyou to come and visit my son. You declared at your first visit, in the\npresence of other physicians, that his condition was moat desperate, but that\nnevertheleas you felt sure that he would be restored to health by a mesmeric\n(magnetic) cure.\nAlthough all your colleagues opposed this opinion, since they had no\nbelief in mesmerism, we relied on you, and you began your cure, by means\nof which my s:m was completely saved.\nOf those who were present at the cure, Dr. Carvellaa and both Verikios\nare dead, Dr. Cokinakis is established elsewhere, and Dr. Margaris is now\nat Naples. My daughter (Madame Couzojaunopoulos) is also living in Naples.\nBut I have obtained the signatures of my wife, my son, M. Vaasopouloa,\nand M. Xanthopoulos, who were always present, and are cognisant of all\nthe facts which I am about to narrate.\nAnd first of all, before you reached Zante, and up to a few hours before\nyour actual visit to my house, we had never thought of you, nor desired\nyour arrival in order to consult you about our boy, nor had the patient\nhimself, in his moments of relative calm, ever expressed such a desire.\nOn your arrival in Zante, however, I called on you in my distrcss, con-\nducted you to my house, and entrusted to you the care of my son.\nHe had long been suffering from a very strange nervous disease, aft'ecting\nhis whole cerebro-spiual axis (tutu le e1~rgie del IUO aui. ce1\u00b7ebt'o\u00b7,pi,ude),\nwhich mo.ny doctors in Zante had vainly endeavoured to cure.\nYou suggested the use of ammal magnetism; you magnetised him during\nhis crises, and he became clairvoyant. During his cure, which lasted about\nthree months, he prescribed for himself different remedies, which never failed\nto benefit him. He succeeded in foretelling the day and hour when a specially\nviolent nervous attack would come on, and the number of hours that it\nwould last, which happened according to prediction.\nOn one occasion he directed you to mesmerise him and leave him asleep\nfor eightconsecutive days and nights, which was actually done, nor did he take\nDigitized by Google\n\f6 Journal of Society for P'1Jchicl41 Re8earch. [Aug\u2022\u2022 IS8&.\nany food during that time except a little Ol'gllllt with bi.acuit and liquorice-\njuice.\nOn two occasions you sent him to sleep from your own house, at a distance.\nSometimes when in tile sleep he rebelled against your magnetic influence,\nand mesmerised hiB own pillow in order to free himself from your impulse,\nbut you always succeeded in overcoming him in the conflict. Sometimes he\nspat in your face, and afterwards bitterly repented, and aaid that he W88 not.\nhimself when he committed such an act. He foretold the day and the hour\nof his recovery a month and a-half before-hand. He aaid that on that day\nyou would have to struggle with him with all your magnetic power, and that.\nif you conquered in the struggle he would be completely cured. All this took\nplace to the letter. As soon 88 the hour of that struggle had been traversed\nhe fell into a magnetic sleep, and declared himself to be perfectly cured, a&\nin fact he haB remained ever since.\nBefore your arrival at Zante I had no acquaintance with you whatever,\nalthough 1 have been many years at Corfu 88 Deputy to the Legialative\nAaaembly, nor had we ever spoken together, nor had 1 ever aaid a wOl\"d to\nyou about my BOn. As I before aaid, we had never thought of you, nor\ndesired your 888istance until I called on you on your arrival aB officer of\nhealth, and begged you to Ave my BOn.\nWe owe his life first to you and then to mesmerism.\nI hold it my duty to declare to you my sincere gratitude, and to subscribe\nmyself affectionately and sincerely youra,\nDEMETRIO VOLTERRA, Count CriaBoplevri.\n(Additional signatures) LAURA VOLTERRA.\nDIONISIO D.

The percipient's knowledge that Major F. G. was in a\ncritical state, is, of course, an element of weakness; but it remains a\nremarkable coincidence that she should have had her one experience of\nan apparition at the exact hour of his death.\nCheltenham,\nMay, 1885.\nAn attack of rheumatiun and nervous prostration left me far from well\nfor lOme weeks last spring, and one night I had a strange unaccountable\nvision which baa left a vivid impression upon my memory. 1 had gone\nto bed early and W!lS lying awake alone with a night light burning in\norder in some degree to dispel the gloom. Suddenly across the lower\nend of the room passed Major F. Go's figure, dressed in his usual every-\nday costume, neither his features nor his figure any whit altered. It was no\ndream, nor was I in the least delirious or wandering, therefore a conviction\nseized me that something must have occurred; in consequence 1 particularly\nmarked the hour, when the clock struck 11 shortly afterwards. Tho next\nmoming I was not the least surprised when my sister handed me a note from\nMias F. G. announcing her brother's death, and was fully prepared before\nreading it to find that he had passed away before 11 the previous evening,\nwhich preaentiment,atrange to say,was fully verified; MaJor F. G. having died\nat a quarter to 11. Major F. G. had returned in a bad state of health from\nEgypt. where he had been serving in the campaign of 1883. For lOme time\nhe appeared to recover and was able to go about and enter into society\nduring the winter, but during the last month the old symptoms had returned,\nand gradually he grew worse and worse, until no hopes of his recovery were\nentertained. Though not personally intimate with him, we were well\nacquainted with his family, and naturally his case formed a topic of conversa-\ntion among us. We had also received bad accounts a few days before and\nwere aware that he was in a critical condition; nevertheless at the time of\nhis death he had been quite out of my thoughts and mind. 1 had nelver\nbefore had any apparition of any description whatsoever, nor baa this one\nbeen followed. by any other.\n[Major F. G.'s name baa been given to us in confidence.]\nIn answer to inquiries, Mias P. says:-\nc.p.\n\" As it is lOme time since I related the vision to my sister, slle feels now\nunable to add her testimony.\"\nMias Scott Moncrietr says :-\n\" As I was at Cheltenham at the time, I call myself 80 far confirm the\nstory as to mention that on the day after it occurred we heard that the\nyoung lady had been 10 shaken in her nerves by her illneaa that ahe had\nDigitized by Google\n\f8 Journal of Society for P8ychical Research. [Aug., 1885.\nbeen seeing what you would call a \u2022hallucination,' and was going to\nMalvern for change of air.\" She adds that Miss P. was staying with her\nwhen the above account was written, and that as to the date: \"Both she\nand I remembered that it was on a Thursday near the end of March or\nbeginning of April.\"\nWe find from an obituary notice that Major F. G. died on Thurmy,\nApril3rd, 1884.\nL.-2316.-Ad pn\nFrom Colonel Swiney (Duke of Cornwall's Regiment.)\nRichmond Barracks, Duplin.\nJuly 14th, 1885.\nI have not been succeBBful in obtaining corroborative evidt.nce with\nregard to the occurrences mentioned in yours of July lat, but briefly the\nfacts were as follows as far I can remember :-\nIt was some time the latter ead of September, 1864, when quartered at\nShorncliffe Camp, I thought I saw my eldest brother (whom at the time I\nbelieved to be in India whl:re he was serving in the Royal Engineers) walking\ntowards me, and before I could recover from my astonishment the figure\nhad disappeared. I perfectly well remember mentioning the fact to some of my\nbrother officers, and saying how curious it was, but never thought much\nabout it until I received news of his death, which had occurred about (as near\nasI can recollect, without having made any note)the time I had imagined I had\nseen him, viz., September 24th, 1864, at Nagpore, East Indies, and but for\nthe f'\\etof his death, I should never probablyhaverecalledthe circumstance. I\ndo not attach much importance to this, it might have been a coincidence,\nremarkable certainly, but nothing more. I am afraid it will not be of much\nuse to you in your inquiries as half its value is gone by my not being able\nto bring corroborative evidence to prove that I had mentioned the facts prior\nto hearing of his death, although in my own mind I am perfectly certain I\ndid so. Richard Edgcumbe was quartered at Shorncli1fe at the very time\nthis occurred.\nS. C. SWINEY.\n[It was from Mr. R. Edgcumbe that we first heard of this incident.!\nIn answer to enquiries Colonel Swiney adds :-\n(1) Years afterwards, in 1871, at the Cape of Good Hope, I wrote a long\naccount of it to a Yorkshire gentleman who was collecting data on the\nsubject of hallucination.\n(2) The 24th September, 1864, was a Sunday. I Cl\\Ilnot say whether that\nwas tlle day I mentioned it. My brother died some time, as far as I can\nrecollect, after the family with whom he was stopping had returned from\nchurch; for I remember the letter saying: \"He was so much better, and\nasleep, that we thought it safe to leave him for an hour or so. On our return,\"\nit went on to say, \"we found he was very feverish, and he died that after-\nnoon.\" Now the time I saw the hallucination could not have been later than\n2 p.m. Allowing for the five hours difference of longitude, that would be\ngitized by (.oogI\n\fAug., 1885.] Journal ofSociet!l\/or PSJ\/chical Research. 9\nabout 9 a.m., and would not tally. [Colonel Swiney aeems to have reckoned\nthe difference the wrong way. At any moment the time of day in India is\nfour or five hours later than the time of day in England j and thus the\ncoincidence may have been exact.]\n(3) I have had a peraow interview with Colonel Schwabe, who was a IUb-\nwith me in the Carabineers, and he cannot recall the circumstances at all,\nindeed, bas no recollection whatever about it. This may be accounted for by\nthe fact of his having gone abroad very Ihortly afterwards, and we did not\nmeet for some months after I had heard of my brother's death. At the time\nI heard of his death I was stopping with Charles Gurney, shooting, near\nNorwich, some time the latter end of October, if not the beginning of\nNovember. When I leceived the letter I knew what was in it, and if I only\nknew Charles Gurney's address, I should have liked to ask him if he\never remembers the morning I received the bad news before I left for\nLondon, saying\" How curious; I thought I saw him coming towards me at\nShorncllife a few weeki ago.\"\nL.\u00b7-2317.-A PA\nFrom Mr. Joseph A. Chamberlain, High Garrett, Braintree, Essex.\nDecember, 1884.\nAbout 12 or 14 years ago a little scholar in my school, named James\nHarrington, WIl.8 very ill with diphtheria. I had been to a village.> about\nthree miles off to give a lesson on the pianoforte, and was returning on a\ndark night about 7 o'clock. I was walking in a narrow footpath between\ntwo hedges, and on coming to a stile I saw a luminous figure Iloa.t over the\nstile, meeting me, and gradually disappear at my left hand. I started and\nsaid to myself, \"That's Jimmie,\" then stamped my foot on the ground and\nsaid, \"How foolish I am to-night.\" I reached home about 7.30 to attend to\nmy evening school, and judge of my surprise, on entering the school, the\ncaretaker met me at the door, saying, .. Jimmie is dead.\" \" When 7\" I\naaid. He answered, \"About \\J.alf-an-hour ago.\"\nI am almost sure it W:18 on t.he same night, on'coming downstairs for some-\nthing for our lick child, I distinctly saw a tall female figure as if for a\nmuftled up journey, come out of our drawing-room door and glide out of the\nfront door. I must say it rather startled me.\nlD answer to questions Mr. Chamberlain II&Ys:-\n(1) The vision in a general way resembled James, especially Il.8 to size.\nThe features were not clearlydefined, but more like a magic-lantern view not\nproperly focussed.\n(2) I knew that he was ill, but not that he was likely to die.\n(3) I was attached to him, but I cannot say I was particularly anxioul\nabout him. AI far Il.8 I remember, 1 went to the house every evening, Il.8\nhis father and mother kept the coffee-room of which I had the superinten-\ndence ; 10 my mind was occupied with hia. condition j but he was not in my\nthoughts before I saw the luminous figure.\n(4) 1 did mention it to our minister, the Rev.

It waa either in 1874 or 1875. My brother waa third mate on\nboard one of Wigram's large shipe. I knew he waa somewhere on the coaat\nof Australia, but I have no recollection of my having been thinking of him\nin any special way; though aa he was my only brother, and we were great\nfriends, there waa a very close bond always between us. My father was\nliving in the country, and one evening I went into the kitchen by myself\nBOOn after 10, to get some hot water from the boiler. There 11'81 a large\nDuplex lamp in the kitchen, so it waa quite light; the servants had gone to\nbed, IUld I was to turn out the lamp. As I waa drawing the water, I looked\nup, and, to my aatoniahment, saw my brother coming towards me from the\noutside door of the kitchen. I did not see the door open, aa it waa in a deep\nrecess, and he waa crossing the kitchen. Tho table waa between us, a.nd he\nsat down on the comer of the table furthest away from mo. I noticed he\nwaa in lUs sailor uniform with 0. monkey jacket on, and the wet waa shining\non his jacket and cap. I exclaimed, \"Miles I Where have you como\nfrom 1\" He answered in his natural voice, though very quickly, \"For God's\nsake, don't s::.y I'm here.\" This waa allover in a few seconds, and aa I\njumped towards him he waa gone. I waa very much frightened, for I bad\nreally thought it waa my brother himself; and it waa only when he vanished\nthat I realised it waa only an appearance. I went up to my room and wrote\ndown the date on a sheet of paper, which I put away in my writing-table,\nand did not mention the circumstance to any ono. About three montha\nafterwards my brother came home, and the night of his arrival I sat with\nhim in the kitchen, while he smoked. I aaked him in a caaual manner if he\nhad had any adventures, IUltl he said, \"I waa nearly drowned at Melbourne.\"\nHe then told me he waa ashore without leave, and on returning to the ship\nafter midnight he slipped oft' the gangway between the side of the ship and\nthe dock. There waa very little space, and if he had not been hauled up at\nonce, he must have been drowned. He remembered thinking he waa drown-\ning, and then became unconscious. His absence without leave waa not\nfound out, so ho escaped the punishment he expected. I then\ntold him of how he had appeared to me, and I aaked him tho date. He\nwaa able to fix it exactly, aa the ship sailed from Melbourne the samA morn-\ning, which waa the reaaon of his fear of being punished, aa all hands wero\ndue to bo on board the evening before.

The hoWle belonged to General Stewart, who had a\ndelicate daughter, and he let it. to take the daughter to Torquay for the\nwinter. We did not know the Stewarts, so our imagination could not have\nauisted in any way to account for the curious apparition that was seen. I\nmyself did not lell it, but I was in the room with my sister and little cousin,\nwho botb did. My belief is that Providence preyented my seeing it as I\nam of a very nervous temperament, and it might have had a very bad effect\nupon me if I had. Well, the apparition took place on Good Friday night at\nabout 12 o'clock. This little cousin, who was only about six years old, had\ncome into town from the country, and as our hoWle was very full she had\na ahake-down beside our bed on my side. I was the first to be awakened by\nhearing her calling out in a frightened way. So I said, \"What is the\nmatter, Addie 1\" \"Oh,\" ahe said, \"Cousin lIaria.nne, I am so frightened.\nA figure has been leaning over me, and whenever I put out my hands to\npUBh it offit leant back on your bed I\" At this I was alarmed and awoke\nmy uter, who lifted her head from her pillow and looked up, when ahe 8&W\na figure gliding &CroM the foot of our bed wrapped in a ahawl, with a hat and\na veil on.

We cannot be certs.in that this is\na. genuine telepathic type; but the cases are well worth recording.\nDr. Morfitwrites on July 4th, 1885 :-\nThe following narrative I now report to you for whatever of interest and\n8uggestion it may be worth.\nCAMPBELL MORFIT.\nAbout the year 1853 I was engaged during 18 montlls in scientific\nwork for the Ordnance Department of the United States, at one of the\nArsenals; and my father's country house being conveniently near, I lived\nthere most of that period. The building, though one of irregular plan, had\ncertain constructional o.rra.ngements which made it all exceptionally\ncomfortable domicile, and these advantages, together with the natural\nbeauties of the place, inspired my fatller to distinguish it by the uncommon\nname of its builder and original owner. Hence, it became known by that\ndesignation, which, let me say for the purpose of tllis narrative, was\nMetarko.\nThe room occupied by me, in this Ilouse, was an isolated one in wltich the\nbuilder and original owner died some years previously, and was said to be\nhawll;ed by him. His ghost, however, never showed itself to any member\nof our household.\nAt the end of my term of residence there I lived in a city ; and several\nyears later, after II. period of professional duty at tile University ofMaryland,\nmoved to New York for the purpose of engaging in private practice as a con-\nsuIting chemist; and the very first client who presented himself was a\ngentleman of eccentric appearance and manner,bearing the name of l\\Ietarko.\nIts peculiarity prompted me to ask him if he was a relative of the builder\nof our family homestead, and he replied, \"Yes, I am his son.\" This odd\ncoincidence interested me, but the profOBBional work which he wished me to\nundertake did not promise succcBBful resulta, and therefore I declined it. He\nthen left but without taking away the sample of waste material which he\nbad brought to me for experiment, and there it rested, obtrusively in sight,\nuntil after several days a moment; of leisure determined me to look into it\nmore closely. Having subjected it to tentatives I soon found, despite first\nimpreBSions to the contrary, that it could be given commercial value as\nrequired, and notified him to that effect. He responded in person, received\nDigitized by Google\n\fAug., 1885.] Journal of Society for P8!1cMcai Re8earch. 15\nmy report gratefully, and 88ked the amount of my fee, but went away wi,th-\nout paying it, though he sent it in a lettera month afterwards upon the eve\n.of his departure homewards, to one of the Western States.\nFor a time that disappearance took him entirely out of my world; but\none evening nearly two years subaequently I had been p888ing an hour or\ntwo at a friend's, listening to some fine music. On my return in good health\nand spirits I felt unusually wide awake 88 recurs to mind even at' this\nmoment, and in fact quite free from any susceptibility to hallucination.\nNevertheless, scarcely had I got into bed than there at the side stood\nlIetarko looking 88 when he last W88 with me, but having two new features,\none a kind of excrescence on the cheek, and the other a neck-tie of striking\npattern. At first this sudden presence amused mu 88 a freak of the imagina-\ntion. but became an annoyance when it would not leave on my trying to dis-\nmiss it. The good part done him forbade the idea that he had come to\nhaunt me reproachfully, yet I W88 somewhat disquieted, and 88 Diy brother\nslept in a distant room upon the same floor I called to him through the open\ndoors of the intermediate sitting-room, without receiving any answer. The\napparition persisted, and I turned my face from it to the wall, by way of\nexorcism; and a few minutesiater, seemingly, though actually, perhaps,\nonly seconds, found that it had vanished.\nSeeking an explanation of the occurrence by reflecting upon it, I arrived\nat the conclusion that Metarko had died that night at his distant home, and\nthe apparition W88 a psychological incident to announce the fact to me, though\nfor what reuon W88 beyond my imagination. The circumstances, however,\n80 absorbed my thoughts all the next day, that when evening set in I felt the\nneed of diverting influences, and went out visiting. On re-entering about\nbedtime I W88 greeted by my housekeeper with the infonnation that a\nstranger gentleman had called in my absence to request that I would allow\nhim a consultation at 9 o'clock the following morning. His name, she said,\nwas on the slate, and there I found it,--to be that of Metarko !--in his\nown unmistakable handwriting! ! This fact, 88tounding for the moment,\nrecalled, vividly, the apparition of the previous evening, so as to rerlder me\nimpatient for the actual interview, and when, at the appointed hour next\nday he came in the flesh, profound W88 my astonishment to find him then\nexactly as he appeared in the vision of 34 hours previously.\nAt a 1088 what to think of this concatenation of mysterious events, and\nhaving pre-engagements for the whole day, after listening to the statement\nof his case I asked him to call again in the evening upon the excuse that an\ninterval W88 desirable for the consideration of his busine88 confided t.o my\ncharge. He agreed to this arrangement, and left but did not return 88 pro-\nmised; and from that moment to the present I have never seen or heard of\nhim. Heralded bya spectre, like itself he departed.\nIn answer to inquiries, Dr. Morfit write.:-\nJuly 12th, 1885.\nIn reply to yours of yesterdate, the narrative sent, through Mr. Crookea,\ncomprises all the particulars of the incident that I can remember at this\ndistance from its occurrence, which is about 26 years.

I was very much surprised at not\nfinding the colonel, and I walked into the barrack yard and joined\nLieutenant Caulfield, 66th Regiment, who was walking there ; and I told\nthe story to him, and particularly described the dress in which I had seen\nthe colonel. We walked up and down the barrack yard talking about it\nfor abou~ 10 minutes, when, to my great surprise, never having kept my\neye from the door leading to the meas-room (there is only one outlet from\nit), I saw the colonel walk into the barracks through the front gate-which\nis in the opposite direction-accompanied by Ensign Willington, 70th\nRegiment, in precisely the same dress in which I had seen him, and with a\nfiabing-rod and a landing-net in his hand. Lieutenant Caulfield and I im\u00b7\nmediately walked to them, and we were joined by Lieut.-Colonel Goldie,\n66th Regiment, and Captain Hartford, and I Bsked Colonel Reed if he had\nnot gone into the mesa-room about 10 minutes before. He replied that he\ncertainly had not, for that he had been out fiahing for more than two houn\nat lOme ponda about a mile from the barracks, and that he had not been near\nthe meB8-room at all since the moming.\nAt the time I saw Colonel Reed going into the mesa-room I waa 1J,0t\naware that he had gone out 6ahing-a very unusual thing to do at this time\nof the year; neither had 1 seen him before in the dress I have described\nduring that day. I had seen him in unifonn in the morning at parade,\nbut not afterwards at all until 3 o'clock-having been engaged m my room\nwriting letters, and upon other buaine88. My eyesight being very good, and\nthe colonel's figure and (lenera! appearance somewhat remarkable, it is\nmorally impoaaible that I could have mistaken any other person in the\nworld for him.

When Colonel R. got off the car, about a couple\nof hours afterwards, Colonel Goldie and other officers said to me, \"Why\nthat's the verydress you described.\" They had not known where he was or\nhow he was engaged. The month, February, was a most unlikely one to\nbe fiBbing in.\n(3) The quartennaster, sitting at the window, would have been bound to\nMe a real figure; he denied having seen anything.\n(4) I have never had the slightest hallucination of the senses on any other\noccasion.\n(5) Colonel Reed was much alanned when told what I had seen.\nThere are several discrepancies in these two accounts, as is natural\nenough considering the interval of time between them. Of these dis-\nDigitized by Google\n\f18 Journal oj Society lor Pagelueal ReaeareA.

Two other points in the later account alter the evi-\ndence in the direction of making the incident seem slightly more marvel-\nlous than it was. The fishing-dress may be taken as practically a proof\nthat the case was one of hallucination, and not of mistaken identity;\nbut had it been the case that the percipient bad not seen Colonel Reed\nat all \/0'1' a week, and m1..'61' in his fishing-dress, the hypothesis of a.\npurely 8ubjective hallucination would be harder to maintain than it is.\nwhen we realise that he had certainly that morning had Colonel Reed's\nfigure before his eyes; and had almost certainly seen him on 801M fornler\noccasion in the dress of the vision. In the remaining point, on the\nother hand, the later account unduly weakens the evidence for the\ntelepathic origin of the hallucination. It says that the interval between\nthe vision a.nd Colonel Reed's return was 2 hours, whereas it was\nreally little more than 10 minutes. Now, if there is any justification\nat all for the provisional hypothesis that the sense of impending arrival\nis a condition fa.vourable for the emission of a telepathic influence, it is\nof importance that, at the time when the phantasmal form was seen.\nColonel Reed was not busy with his fishing, but was rapidly approach-\ning his destination. For thus the incident, at any rate, gets the benefit\nof analogy with other cases.\nL.-2322.-Ad pn\nFrom Mrs. Bettany, 2, Eckington Villa, Ashbourne Grove, Dulwich.\nOn the evening of, I think, March 23rd, 1883, I was seized 'withan unac-\ncountable anxiety about a neighbour, whose name I just knew, but with\nwhom I was not on visiting terms.

However, as he was also invited.\nby my grandfather, ho preferred to accept that invitation, glad of the\nopportunity of meeting my mother. The house was a large one, and full of\nChristmas guesta. One night tllere was a dinner party of friends from the\nneighbourhood. After dinner such a storm arose that my grandmother found\nherself obliged to provide everyone with beds for the night. \u2022 . \u2022 My\ngrandmother, to arrange for her unexpected company, gave up the young\nmen's bedroom to the ladies, and turned the library into a BOrt of barrack\nroom for the night.\nAt 3 o'clock my Uncle William spoke to my father, who was sleeping\nnear him, and said ., James, who are you talking to ; what are you saying ,,'\nMy father raised hinl80lf up, looked at his watch, and replied, \"I have\nseen a vision. Mrs. Brown has been standing at my feet,and she said, 'Good-\nbye, James! I wished greatly to seo you, to say good-bye to you before I left\nthis world, and I have now come to you. Serve God and be a good man.\nand He will prosper and bl088 you. I have loved you BO dearly from the\ntime you were a boy, that I had to say good\u00b7bye. But let us meet again.' She\nwaved her hand and disappeared.\"\nBoth the young men were much impreued, and in the morning my father\ntold my grandmother of the dream or vision. She advised him to write an\nordinary letter just inquiring about Mrs. Brown and her daughtel'8. Letters\nthen cost tenpence, and were not written on slight occasions.\nMy father did write, but a letter crossed his saying, that at 3 o'clock\non the very night ofhis dream, Ml'B. Brown had died, and her last conscious\nwords were regrets that she had not been able to see him to say good-bye.\nMy father never much liked telling this story. He firmly believed he had\nseen a vision. I have heard it from his lips, and I have seen the two letters\nwhich croued each other in the post. My father was the Rev.

In a very few instances would it be obtainable. Nor is it worth\nwhile to invite and overhaul a vast correspondence in the hope of finding\nauch cases, when much more direct, more acceaaible, and more tangible\nresults may be obtained by another method. Instead of evoking shadowy\nreminiscences of what occurred many years ago, why not test the alleged\niutervention of the spiritual universe in occurrences of to-day 1If such things\never occurred, why may they not occur at the present time 1And a multitude\nof honest, disinterested, and intelligent persona, not in one country only,\nbut in many countries allege that they do occur. How is it that theee\n\" modem instances\" are not inquired into 1 How is it that they are not\nprimarily resorted to for a reply to the question-Do persons who once lived\non this earth, but who now exist in the Unseen, ever communicate with ns\nhere by dIeam, by apparition, by ftllt and scnsible presence and contact,\nby signs and wonders utterly beyond Pur mortal powers 1\nThere seems a perversity in selecting the more remote, ambiguous and\ncircuitous method of inquiry in preference to the immediate, the more direct\nand definite method of procedure. The question of the reality or the delusion\nof \" spiritual agency\" is presented in a much more manageable shape in\naaaerted instances of to-day than in stories of wl18.t occurred 20 or more years\nago, where the agents are dead or inacceaaible, and where there is no power\nof croaa-tlxamination. In one word, a definite conclusion arrived at as to\nthe pretensions of Mr. Eglinton would be much more valuable than the\nheap of doubtful casel, and more doubtful comments, which we find in the\nProuediltg. of your Society.\nIt would seem as if the \" cases\" were chiefly valued for the sake of the\ncomment, and as if the principal aim of the Society was to invent theories,\nand not to investigate facta. Two such theories are presented to us as\ncovering all the cases of reported spiritual agency. \"Telepathy\" is Olle, and\n\" Unconscious ccrebratil'll\" is the other. The former is really ollly the\ninvention of a term or phrase, f01' there i8 undeniable evidence of the fact.\nThere is no attempt InBde to solve the mystery, or to explain the modus\noptmndi of this power. But it is brought forward in order to show that\n.. spiritual agency\" need not be resorted to to account for any of these\ncaaes ; in the hope, indeed, of excluding the thought of it. If there be such a\npower it must clearly be of an electrical or magnetic kind. And if so, it is\nmuch more credible, or in other worda, le8a my8terious if wielded by\n\" a spirit\" than by a mortal, A 8pirit'8 mode of existence, and more rcfined\nvehicle of consciousneaa muat be more favourable to the exertion of tele\u00b7\npathic influence than the coarser organs and tiaaues of mortality. :&Iust we\nnot conceive it in the case of the former to act at. much longer distances 1\nYet Mr. Myers propounds it as an easy and all-sufficient solution of\nmY8terious cases, though all the while he is talking about he know8 not\nwhat, for he muat acknowledge that his mind ia in a state of profound dark-\nneaa as to the mod\".. operandi, Nevertheleaalle extends this power, at his\narbitrary will, to any case wherein it appears neceaaary to exclude the inter-\nvention of \" a apirit.\"\n'Ve may observe the Bame proceaa in the case of \"Cerebration.\" That;\nDigitized by Google\n\fAug., 18S5.] Journal Qf Society for P8ychical Resem\u00b7ch. 21\nalso has been wan~nly and gratuioously ~nlarged until, in Mr. Myers' handa,\nit threatens ~ annihilate all moral responsibility, and, if it be true, ~ render\nthe administration of justice a mere haphazard affair. A crime might after\nall be only a case of \"unconscious cerebration.\" He has raised Dr.\nCarpenter's theory ~ a higher and most dangerous power. So in regard to\ntelepathy he naively remarks that he has only raised what all admit 00 be\ntrue in some small extent \"~a higher power.\" It w(;uld be just as good\nan argument 00 assert that man has the power of flying, if he would only\nexert it, for that ~ suppose him to have that power is only raising his\nacknowledged faculty of locomotion \"~ a higher power.\" This is not\nllCience, either physical or metaphysical; it is mere and wan~n assumption,\nadopted for convenience sake, and prompted by a predetennination, however\nnnconscious, ~ exclude spirit agency at all hazards. Anything is ~ be\nbelieved, anything is ~ be assumed rather than that. Telepathy is much\nmore credible in the case of a spirit and a mortal, than between two mortals.\nI will defy Mr. Myers ~ controvert that argument. Is it not certain that a\nspirit can administer \"the telepathic impact\" more readily and powerfully\nthan a mere mortal \u2022\u2022 clad in this Dl uddy vesture of decay\" 1\nLet any ono run through the cases presented in the pagElS of tho Jo\"rnal,\nand note the comments on them, and he will find that in nearly e\\'ery case\nthe evidence is reported as defective-that further particulars, dates, fuller\ndetaila and more corroborative testimony is required. One ingenious gentle-\nman s~ests that\" the antecedents of the servants\" who reported a case\nought to be investigated. They pursue the inquiry like a firm of solici~rs\npreparing a case for a trial. Mr. Myers complains that the evidence is Vf'Ty\nfar indeed from reaching the point which will satisfy science. But he 111\nlI&IlgUine that, by accumulating more cases and more and further testimony,\nthis point will at last be reached. He will then triumphantly adduce his\ncases and be aUle ~ exclaim, \"Find a. flaw in this evidence if you can ! \"\nOur physical scientists would laugh at this as childish bravado. They\nwould coolly reply, \"We know the laws of the physical universe-the only\nuniverse which we have any knowledge ofl or believe, and we know that\nyour reported marvels are clean contrary to those laws; therefore we know\nin advance that the things you allege are impossible, and that you are the\nvictims of delusion. Therefore, we scorn your evidence, and will not waste\nour time in examining it.\" Such is the reply of physical science, of which\nthe delegates of the Society are in such murtal terror,and which they are vainly\nattempting ~ propitiate. 'l'rue Spiritualists view the visible universe as the\nuniverse of cjfectiJ, and believe that beyond it, and inside of it, is the unseen\nuniverse of cames, and that the latter sometimes flows in~ the former and\ncontrols it by finer elements and agoncies; even as the mind, working by\nfaith, sometimes dominates tlle mortal body and changes its working. You\ncannot compel assent by sheer force of evidence. The mind must first\naccept principles, and be guided by them. Hence this accumulation of more\ncases and ampler detaila, and this ransacking narratives of long past timAs,\nis all labour in vain and will never produce conviction.\nBut why take such pains ~ rummage out cases in auld lang syne, when\nequal and far greater wonders are said by respectable witnesses to be at tills\nday occurring among us in lavish abundance '\/ The cases are more decisive,\ngitized by (.oogI\n\f28 JOllrnal qf &ciet!\/ lor P8!\/cMcal Re8earch.

They seem apprehensive that their verdict\nmight be called for, and they are determined not to give it. Meanwhile they\nprefer to occupy themselves with Madame Blavatsky and her trickeries,\nand to prosecute their researches in the remote Indies. Why do they not\n-send envoys to America, and investigate the alleged wonders there 1\nThere is, however, quite enough to interest and engage them at home,\nif their hearts are in the cause. Why do they not investigate the case of\nMr. Barkas, of Newcaatle 1 He is a credible witneaa-the people of New-\ncastle knoN him well; his antecedents would aatisfy even Mr. Davies.

Let\nthem rest awhile from speculations on \"the telepathic impact,\" and their\nendeavours to raise it to a. higher power, and tum their a.ttention to these\nnearer and more 101ubie problems. Let Mr. Myers paUle in his efforts to\nestablish the complete duality of the lOul of man, and ita separation into\nconacious and unconscious spheres-the latter of these irresponsible-and let\nhim addreaa himself to the cases I have mentioned. Let us have facta first,\nand theones afterwards.\nG. D. HA.UGHTON.\nTo 1M Editor oj tile JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL REsEARCH.\nSm,-Sincc my name occurs repeatedly in Mr. Haughton's letter, which\nyou have shown to me before ita insertion in the JOHnlal, you will, perhaps,\nallow me to make some reply to such part of it as concerns myself and lily\nfriends on the Literary Committee. The old Committee on Physical\nPhenomena will, doubtleaa, answer for themselves, and I must confeaa that\nI to lOme extent share Mr. Haughton's curiosity lUI to the exact explanation\nwhich they may give of their prolonged silence. The fact of their non-\npresentation of any Report has several times been alluded to with disappoint-\nment at meetings of the Council, and lOme of us might have ventured on\nmore direct appeal to thom had we not shrunk from putting preaaure on a\ncommittee of volunteers engaged in a field of inquiry which, as I know from\nexperience, is a very toillOme one ; and also from appearing to bring into\ncontrasted relief the activity of the Committee of which Mr. Gurney and\nmyself have the honour to be secretaries. Mr. Haughton has brought that\ncontrast into view; but he seems to draw the inference that the sight of our\nCommittee working vigorously at ita own tasks has actually preuflua other\nCommittees from prosecuting their\u2022\u2022 We could scarcely have anticipated this\nJ'8IIult, which seems depreaaingly at variance with the usual teaching of\nmoralista as to the force of example.\n.As to my own relation to Spiritualism, I shall have IOmething to say\nfurther on. But I shallbelt consult the reader's convenience by taking lOme\nof Mr. Haughton's topics in order.\nMr. Haughton makes various strictureson the cases of apparitions, &c.,\nwhich we have collected, and on our treatment of them, which strictures I\nfind lOme little difficulty in hannonising.Firat, he complains that we present.\nvast variety of cases,\" but deliver\" no clear judgmentj\" then that the cases\n\" are chiell.y valued for the sake of the comment.\" He smiles at our \" in-\nterminable correspondence in the collection of evidence,\" yet adds that \" it\n'Would seem as if the principal aim of the Society was to invent theories and\nnot to investigate facta.\" He points out the evidential weuneaa of remote\ncaaea (aaauming, whah little attention will show to be a mistake, that our\nDigitized by Google\n\f30 Joltl'lIal qf Societ.1f for Psychical Be8fflrch. [July, 188.'1.\ncaleS are u8Uul'y remote ones), yet at the IlAme time he seems to think that\nwe ought not ourselves to indicate what toe think weak points in the evidence\nwhich we collect. \"They purs~e the inquiry,\" he exclaims, \"like a finn\nof solicitors preparing a case for a trial.\" 1cannot help being pleased that\nwe produce this impre88ion, at any rate, on one critic's mind, inasmuch as\nthe last letter of criticism which I had occasion to answer in this Journal (in\nMay last), was actually from a solicitor, who objected, in effect, that we did\nnot pursue the inquiry in a way which his firm would consider as 8ufficiently\nItringent.\nI gather, however, that Mr. Haughton'8 real objection is to our use of\nthe theory of telepathy, of a tnn&ference of impressioJl8 from one mind\nto another without the agency of the recognised organs of 8ense. Not\nthat he disputes the fact of lIuch transference, of which he lII\\y8 that there is\n\"undeniable evidence,\" but he seems (if I may 110 IlAY)to grudge our wasting\ngood telepathy on mere mortal minds, instead of using it to demonstrate\nthe influence of spiritual beinga.\n\"A spirit's mode of existence and more refined vtlhicle of consciousness\nmust be more favourable,\" he sayll, \" to the exertions of telepathic influence\nthan the coarser OrgaDB and tiBBue8 of mortality. Telepathy is much more\npo88ible in the case of a spirit and a mortal ~han between two mortals. I will\ndefy Mr. Myers to contro\"ert that argument.\"\nAs it so happens that I have already said something \"ery like this myself\nin print, I am happy to join Mr. Haughton in defying, not myself only, but.\nthe whole world, to controvert it.\nIn a Report written by Mr. Gurney and mYllelf, Proceeding. VI., p. 184,\nthese words will be found.\n\" We have found [in diacu88ing certain e\"idence] no need to postulate\nthe existence of any intelligences except human minds, and human minds,\nnot in hell or heaven, but on earth as we know them. But nevertheleBB,\nif other intelligent beings besidell those visible to us do in fact exist-if\nman'lI own soulllurvives the tomb-then, no doubt, our telepathic experi-\nments or our collected casell of apparitions, interpret.ed as we interpret them,\ndo suggest analogies of influence, modes of operation, which (it is hardly too\nmuch too say) would throw a quite novel light over the long controversy\nbetween Science and Faith. It is only in lIome form of idealism that that.\ncontroversy can find a close.\"\nI am far, indeed, from complaining that Mr. Haughton has not remem-\nbered this paBBage. It is only natural that on seeing the too frequently\nrecurring namell of MeIIIIrB. Gurney and Myers at the bottom of an article, he\nIIhould exclaim T01tjours perdl'ix I and pass on to the next. But I think\nthat the reader will lIee that, allowing for what I may call the 8uperior\ndecisivenesll of Mr. Haughton's style, our words and his expre88 much the\nsame conviction; namely, that this supernormal transmiBBion of thought\nmay naturally be supposed to be facilitsted by the conditions of 8piritual,\nas opJiosed to carnal, existence. The main difference is that we still\nfeel bound to speak of communication with spiritual existences in a hypo-\nthetical tone ; thougb we almost go out of our way to assert that if we\nshould be fortunate enough to attain conviction on the point as to which\nMr. Haughton is already convinced, we should at once draw the very\ncorollary which he defies us to controvert.\nDigitized by Google\n\fAug., 1885.] Journal of SOCiet!l101\" Psychical Research. 31\nIt cannot, however, be said that Mr. Haughton ignorea the fact that the\nmajority of aamnu at !,resent deny that this crucial point baa actually been\nproved. On the contrary he represents .. the reply of physical science\" a\nconsisting of such remarks as \"We scorn your evidence and will not waste\ntime in examining it.\" I am sorty if any IGmnt, have spoken in this tone\nto Mr. Haughton or his friends, and if my own experience baa been leu\ndisagreeable, I am inclined to refer this to the leu lofty air which 1 have felt\njustified in taking towards men whom I regard-not, I hope, with\" mortal\nterror,\" as Mr. Haughton suggests,-but with a reapectand admiration which\nmake me feel that if (as is the CaBe) I believe in certain marvellous things\nwhich many men with more knowledge and sagacity than I can boast treat\naa mere figments and delusions, it behoves me at any rate to be moderate in\nstating my novel views, and to take all poBBible pains to justify and support\nthem. Considering that in Cambridge alone a past and a present Prof8880r\nof Experimental Physics, a Profe880r of Astronomy, and a Profeuor of\nAnatomy have already joined our Society, I hardly feel tempted to change\nmy style to the more .. triumphant\" phraseology which Mr. Haughton puts\ninto my mouth, with the kind warning that .. our physical scientisr.s would\nlaugh at this as childish bravado.\"\nBut, putting controversy aside, let me say at once that I heartily concur\nwith Mr. Haughton in desiring an immediate and thorough investigation by\nmembers of our Society of any Spiritualistic phenomena which may be\nacceuible to us. Let us see what specific lines of inquiry he suggests :-\n(1) The automatic writing of an indifferently-educated person (otherwise\nknown as Mrs. Esperance), said to be inspired by\" Humnur Stafford,\" and\nrecorded by Mr. Barkas. I havo known Mr. Barkas since January, 1875,\nand through his introduction sat with this mediwn on October 16th, 17th,\nand 18th, 1875. I have also studied all her printed answers. I consider\nthe case curious and interesting, and I am not surprised at Mr. Barkas' view\nof it, but unfortunately the grou want of comprehension of the subjects\ninquired about, and the palpable blunders which the replies contain, seem to\nme to preclude us from regarding the case as affording evidence of the\nguidance of a scientific spirit.\nThe fact, moreover, that the same medium, under the name of Mrs.\nEsperance, was afterwards detected in personating a materialised spirit,\ntended to discourage me from seeking further evidence through that\nchannel.\n(2) The ring on Mr. Husk's arm, which Dr. Wyld considers as a con-\nelusive proof of spirit agency, has heen examined by two committees of our\nSociety. The first of these reported unfavourably ; but as it was then urged\nthat this Committee was lJOt strong enough, a second was appointed, including\nMr. Crookes, Mr. Victor Horsley, the well-known surgeon, and other men\nof scientific training. Their Report is to appear, I believe, in the next\nnumber of our Procuding., having been delayed by the Committee's desire\nto make it as complete as might be, and to support it, if poBBible, by actual\nsurgical experiments.\n(3) The CaBe of Mr. Morell Theobald. I quite agree with Mr. Haughton\nthat some further investigation of this case is to be desired. Mr. Theobald\nkindly offered to allow some delegate of our Society to join his circle, .. if\nDigitized by Google\n\f32 Journal qf Societ!\/ for P8ychical Researcn. [Au,., 1885.\nthe spiriu. would allow it \" ; but this condition does not as yet seem to have\nbeen fulfilled. We can, therefore, do nothing more in the matter at\npresent.\n(4) \"Cases of movemenu. of tables, ringing of bella by invisible per-\nformers,\" &C. Where are these cases to be found, actually going on 1 If\nonly Mr. Haughton will let me know, I, for one, will grudge no trouble to\nsee and investigate them. \\Ve cannot hear ofany such; will not those who\nmay be more fortunate help us 1\n(5) Mr. Eglinton. As for myself, I have sat with Mr. Eglinton at\nintervals since 1875 or earlier; thp first seance of which I can find a noto at\nthis moment being on April 25th, 1875. I have never got any noteworthy\nphenomena with him except on the very last occasion on which I sat, viz.,\nat Cambridge on June 3rd, 1885. On one other occasion,February 16th,1885,\na very striking phenomenon occurred, but unfortunately I was requested to\nleave the room immediately before it. Without expressing any doubt as to\nthe genuineness of this phenomenon, I feel that my absence from the room\nwould prevent my description of it from carrying weight. I hope to continue\nsitting with Mr. Eglinton whenever occasion offers, but I do not seem to be\nthe best possible person for that particular task.\nMr. Gurney baa sat nine or ten times with Mr. Eglinton, and baa, I\nbelie\\-e, obtained some interesting though inconclusive phenomena. Othera\nof my friends have sat repeatedly; but some member of the Committee on\nPhysical Phenomena may be able to give fuller details.\nMy letter is already too long, but I am obliged to add one more point.\nMr. Haughton complains of \" a latent moth-e, an arriere peflaU,\" .. a pre-\ndetermination,\" apparently on my part especially, \"to exclude spirit\nagency.\"\nNow, I have already said in Light, -in very explicit terms, that I have no\nsu~h arTiere pemU, no such predetennination. And I may here add that I\nhave for many years regarded the prublems involved in Spiritualism as of\nthe very highest importance; and that in joining the Society for Psychical\nResearch I was actuated in great measure by my hope that I should\nthus gain some opportunities of witnessing phenomena of this kind obtained\nin private circles, without the presenco of a paid medium. Interesting\nthough the other branches of our work may be, any phenomenon which\nauthentically proved the intervention of the spirits of tlle dead\nwould, to my mind, far surpass in interest the \"telepathy\" and \"unconscious\ncerebration\" to which Mr. Haughton supposes me to be so closely wedded.\nBut I can only say, in Mr. Haughton's own words, \"Let us have facts\n:first, and theorios afterwards.\" Before we venture to utter an opinion on a\ntopic so difficult and momentous let us have more, much more, of compe-\ntent observation and careful oxperiment. Once again I repeat the earnest\nappeal which I have already made both in Light and in our Procuaiflg3 to\nthe Spiritualistic world-to suggest to us the means, to offer to us t.he\nopportunities, of attaining those assured convictions on this great matter\nwhich should surely inspire those who already hold them with a zealous\nreadine88 to labour for their wider diffusion among open-minded men.\nI am, sir, &c.,\nFREDERIC W.
