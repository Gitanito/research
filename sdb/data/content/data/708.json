This is one of the few purely spiritualist journals of the period and is a good example of the sad decay of the movement in the twentieth century.  It provided platitudinous commentary on the spirits, a \"Mediums' Directory,\" and \"Reports of Societies,\" but the result lacks energy and is padded out with recipes and other general material.
