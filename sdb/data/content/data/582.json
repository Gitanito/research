Myers.\nChapter VI.\nThe Mechanism of Hysteria.\nThe survey of human personality on which we are now engaged ;\u2014\ninvolving as it does the discovery and discussion of such intimations\nas upraise themselves in many quarters from the hidden or submerged\nstrata of our being into the consciousness of ordinary life;\u2014is a survey\nof which no single section can be complete until the whole field has\nbeen passed under review. On the other hand, fresh problems present\nthemselves in each department as fresh phenomena are noted in other\ndepartments, and closer interrelations discerned or divined. And be\nsides this increasing complexity there is an increasing marvellousness\nin the phenomena gradually encountered, which must needs send us\nback again and again in search of phenomena analogous, but less\nstartling in character.\nIt is reasonable, therefore, that before we pass on from the complex\nand marvellous phenomena described under the head of sensory\nautomatism to the no less surprising facts of motor automatism\u2014\nespecially of automatic script and speech\u2014-we should pause and con\nsider how far our definition of motor automatism is to extend, and\nwhat earlier or simpler phases thereof may point the way to those\nhighly-developed telepathic motor messages with which we are mainly\nto be concerned.\nIn the first place we shall observe once more\u2014what has often been\nalready manifest\u2014that the simple partition of nervous action into\nsensory and motor does not suffice as a logical scheme for the arrange\nment of subliminal messages. We are not, indeed, entitled to assume\nthat what we call sensory or motor qualities are inherent in these\nmessages, either as received telepathically from others, or as initiated\nin the depths of our own being. Such qualities may be the mere\ntranslation into terms intelligible by the supraliminal self of impressions\nfor which we possess no specialised term ;\u2014impressions which we should\nbe obliged to describe vaguely as \" organic \" ;\u2014although, for aught we\nknow, they may in reality be themselves specialised in categories of\nb 2\n\f4 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwhich we have at present no conception. This seems to be the case\nwith many even of those subliminal messages which are ultimately\nclothed in the most definite sensory form. An apparition or a\nphantasmal voice may be the exteriorisation of a telepathic impact\nwhich has first shown itself in a mere sense of apprehension or malaise.\nSuch an apparition is no simple optical presentation ; we may call it\nif we please an internal vision, but its deeper initiatory processes are\nas yet unknown.\nStill more markedly is this the case with motor automatisms. The\ntelepathic transmission of a message directly prompting to a motor act\n(as of writing) has no even apparent parallel in ordinary life. For I\ncannot directly prompt my friend to a motor act ; I can so prompt him\nonly by first producing upon him some sensory impression. I can tell\nhim to write; I can stir him to answering speech; but my volition\ncannot touch his motor centres of hand or throat except through some\nsuch indirect road. All the harder, then, is it to conceive from what\nform of initial impulse these motor automatisms spring ; all the more\nare we bound to study such vague, organic, internuntial messages as\nwe can detect in their passage from one stratum of our psychical being\nto another, before we deal with the full-blown motor messages,\ntelepathic or otherwise, which are conveyed by automatic script or\nvoice. In other words, and using my old metaphor, before we follow\nmotor automatism above the psychological end of the conscious\nspectrum, we must trace its beginnings below the physiological end.\nWe must analyse the influence of motor and quasi-motor messages upon\nthe organic functions before we analyse the intellectual contents of such\nmessages, or discuss the source of such definite knowledge as they may\ncontain.\nTo some extent this has been already done in previous chapters.\nDiscussing the Mechanism of Suggestion (Chap. II.), we encountered\nmany vaso-motor and trophic changes over which, in my view, the\nhypnotic stratum of the Self exerts habitual control. Again, the\nInspirations of Genius (Chap. III.) were seen to have their motor side,\nboth in the plastic arts, in music, and in oratory ; although the greater\ndefiniteness of mathematical achievements led us to dwell mainly on a\nform of genius whose results are conceived and expressed mainly in\nvisual terms. Dreams, which were next touched upon, involve obscure\nforms of motor as well as of sensory excitation ; and the very name of\nsomnambulism points to a pitch of dream-intensity at which its motor\nimpidses translate themselves into more or less coherent action.\nOn these topics, then, I must be content to refer my readers to\nwhat has already been briefly and imperfectly said. But there is one\ncognate topic of great importance\u2014one repertory of subliminal mes\nsages especially of the vaguer organic types\u2014on which I have as yet\n\fThe Subliminal Consciaumess. 5\ntouched so meagrely that I must needs here discuss its lessons at\nsome length before proceeding to those more specialised and intellec\ntual motor messages of which automatic writing is the familiar type.\nI allude to the whole range of morbid interchanges or interactions\nbetween one section of the personality and another,\u2014those \" self-sug\ngestive maladies,\" or \" diseases of the hypnotic stratum,\" as I have\ntermed them (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 309), \" whose differentia is an\nirrational self-suggestion in regions beyond the powers of the waking\nwill ;\u2014a morbid or uncontrolled functioning of powers over the\norganism which effect profounder modifications than the empirical\nself can parallel.\" For convenience' sake we. may continue to give to\nall these perturbations the meaningless name of \" hysteria \" ;\u2014trusting\nthat the reader will divest his mind of those popular notions of hysteria\nwhich merely reflect and misinterpret some superficial symptoms of a\ngroup of maladies which are among the most formidable, and the\nmost instructive, disturbances to which human minds and bodies are\nexposed.\nTo define hysteria in nosological terms, by cataloguing and connect\ning its symptoms, is well known to be an impossible task. In our\nignorance of the physical genesis and interrelation of those symptoms\nwe cannot predict from one day to another what evolution the disease\nwill follow, or what new phenomena may occur. If we would attain\nto a comprehensive view, we must seek it from some psychological\nstandpoint. And we must begin by distinguishing all ordinary\ndiseases, taken together, from their hysterical simulations, as profoundly\nas we distinguish all placental mammals from the marsupial parodies\nwhich by some freak of evolution so strangely mimic placental forms.\nOn the one hand we have a series of definite, objective lesions,\ninflicted upon the organism by some external injury, or by some\ninternal operation of microbes, malnutrition, heredity disease, or senile\ndecay. On the other hand, and side by side with this series, we have\nanother series of what I may term pltantom lesions, depending, of\ncourse, ultimately upon some cerebral conditions\u2014hereditary, self-\ndeveloped, or traumatic ;\u2014but so depending in an indirect rather than\nin a direct fashion, not as incapacities anatomically following on injury\nto definite nervous centres or tracts, but as the apparently capricious\nmanifestations of an injury presumably affecting some unknown seat\nof highest co-ordination ; in short, as perturbations of personality,\nwhich work themselves out through some morbid process of self-sug\ngestion, according to laws of association cognisable by us, if at all,\nfrom the intellectual rather than from the anatomical side.\nThese phantom lesions, I say, are not like anatomical injuries, but\nlike some ignorant patient's objectified dream. Hysterical patches of\nanaesthesia do not correspond with any true areas of ordinary sensory\n\f6 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ninnervation ; they seem to follow the patient's crude notions of where\nhis limbs begin and end ; they are \" anaesthetic bracelets,\" \" anaesthetic\nboots.\" The eye - troubles of the hysteric affect not the optical\nmechanism alone, but all that the ophthalmic patient would call his\n\" eye \" ;\u2014all: that occupies or surrounds the orbit. Nay, certain well-\nknown syndromes\u2014as the so-called hysterical \" astasia-abasia,\" or\ninability to walk and stand\u2014are, if I may so say, unblushingly\nintellectual in character, are the mere abolition by some profound\nself-suggestion of one special set of co-ordinated movements deeply\nrooted, first in the supraliminal, then in the subliminal life. The\n\"rhythmic chorea,\" or \"danse de S. Guy,\" on the other hand, so\ncommon in mediaeval Germany, is an intensification of an acquired\nsynergy, a helpless prolongation of a set of co-ordinated movements\nwhich the patient is unable to arrest, as the boy in the fairy tale was\nunable to arrest the mill, whose controlling charms he had forgotten,\nand which is still grinding out salt at the bottom of the sea. On these\npoints all will agree. And I may suggest that from my own special\npoint of view hysterical \" allocheiria \"\u2014the confusion or reversal of\nmotor conceptions of left and right\u2014is but the degenerative counter\npart of that ambidexterity which I regard as now accompanying the\nevolutionary process in man ; and, moreover, that hysterical attaques de\nsommeil are but that reversion to our primitive state of personality\nwhich is natural, which was even predictable, amid the upheavals of\nthis psychic storm.\nIt is, then, this fundamentally psychological character of hysteria,\nas a perturbation of personality, which excuses, or rather compels,\nits study not only from the clinical, but from the psychological stand\npoint. But before we discuss symptoms which show us perturbed\npersonality as an undoubted evil, I feel bound once more to disavow\na view which, though it be taken for granted, for instance, by all\nwriters on hysteria, I cannot but regard as erroneous. I mean the\nview that any perturbation of the ordinary . personality is necessarily\nand in itself an evil. Such perturbations, no doubt, disturb the\n\" normal man \" ; but the \" normal man \" represents in my eyes no\ntrue ideal, no stable synthesis, but rather a transitory and shifting\ncompromise between the Sage and the Dement. The Sage,\u2014if I may\nthus use the name of the imaginary Stoic hero with a new implication\u2014\nwould be the man who fully controlled all faculties immanent within\nhim ;\u2014who (for instance) could voluntarily receive and transmit tele\npathic impressions ; who could remedy by self-suggestion his body's\nremediable ills, and exempt himself at last from any painful perception\nof its inevitable decay. The Dement, on the other hand, has suffered\nthe almost complete obscuration of personality. His organism retains\nbarely so much of unity as suffices to protect it from piecemeal disin\n\fThe Subliminal Comciousness. 7\ntegration. Between these two extremes\u2014the one imaginary, the\nother real,\u2014lies an almost infinite series of combinations and permuta\ntions of the elements of human personality. Combinations superior\nto the habitual combination which makes the normal man of the\ntime being are wont to arise slowly by evolution, and may be hastened\nby deliberate experiment. And high among such improved plans of\npsychical structure I reckon the condition of those sensitives who,\nwithout injury to normal health or capacities, can exercise an easier\ncommerce than is open to most of us with their own subliminal\nselves.1 Of course I am not saying that members of this type are\nindividually superior to men of the \" normal \" type any more than all\npersons who are \" immune \" against influenza are individually superior\nto all who catch it. Mr. Keulemans (on whose experiences we dwelt\nin the last chapter) is not wiser than Charles Darwin ; but he never\ntheless belongs, in my view, to an advanced, a forward-pointing type ;\nhe is wiser than he would have been if, with the same character and\nintelligence, he had been constructed on the physical pattern of the\nnormal man.\nBut, nevertheless, among adjustments so complex and delicate as\nthose of our psychical being, any perturbation will naturally be injurious\nmore often than beneficial. For the most part it will indicate no pro\ngress towards a new ideal, but a mere incapacity of maintaining the\npractical compromise which has been found needful for terrene well-\nbeing. To all troubles of this kind, where no discernible organic lesion\nis suspected, the name of hysteria is loosely given. But what a differ\nence between the various cases massed under this head ! \" Great wits \"\nhave at least never been supposed to be \" near allied \" to blank im\nbecility ; yet we are content to include in the same class of \" hysterics \"\nat once such intense and epoch-making spirits as St. Theresa or Rousseau,\nand some dead-alive inmate of the Salpetriere, who cannot vary the\npattern of wool-work on which she started years ago. nor leave the\nhospital ward for the garden without bewilderment and alarm. \" Les\nhyste'riques menent le monde,\" says the French proverb. \" It is the\nfact,\" say Breuer and Freud, \" that among hysterics we find the clearest-\nminded, the strongest-willed, the fullest of character, the most acutely\ncritical specimens of humanity.\"2 Can these things be true of the\nsame class which contains all those poor Lucies and Marcelles who\nseem to exist flabbily for the mere purpose of moral vivisection,\u2014\" the\n1 It may, of course, be the case that the subliminal Self of the sensitive is not only\nmore easily reached but also more capable or better-informed than with ordinary men.\nBut since different degrees of facility in intercommunication seem enough to account\nfor difference in results, I refrain from touching on that other (obviously insoluble)\nquestion.\n2 Neurologischci Central-blatt, January 15th, 1893, p. 44.\n\f8 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfrogs of the experimental psychologist \" ? There is need, I venture\nto think, of some such generalisation as I propose, if definitions\napparently so discrepant are to be brought under a higher unity. On\nthe view here taken, the characteristic both of St. Theresa and of Mar-\ncelle is a perturbed personality. But there may be many different\nforms of such perturbation, leading to almost opposite results. Two\nleading types of possible derangement will at once suggest themselves.\nIt is the business of the supraliminal Self to maintain the em\npirical span of consciousness and faculty both unimpaired and un-\ninvaded. \" Just in this fashion,\" has that Self decided, \" is it needful\nfor terrene prosperity that man should feel, and should react upon the\nworld outside him. There may be faculties deeper down in him which\ncan perceive more, and can react more profoundly. Let these faculties\nkeep to their proper business of superintending the organic processes,\nwhose mechanism I, the supraliminal Self, have never known or have\nlong since forgotten. I do not desire the casual incursion of powers\nwhich I am unable to control. Nay, I must needs keep the threshold\nof consciousness stable, the psychical diaphragm impermeable, if I am\nto secure my own preservation. If that partition be too easily tra\nversed, I shall fear that knowledge and faculty essential to my own\nwell-being may sink into subliminality and pass beyond my control. I\nmust not risk such losses. I need to be able to catch, retain, digest,\nthe impressions from without which subserve practical life ; to mix\nthem in healthy association with each other, and to excrete them from\nmemory when they have ceased to be of use and are becoming cumber\nsome or even noxious.\"\nWe shall find, I think, that in most cases of hysteria these two corre\nlative dangers\u2014of insurgence and of subsidence\u2014are represented, but\nare represented in varying proportions. With \" the hysterics who lead\nthe world \" there is no marked loss of supraliminal grasp or span, but\nthere is irregular uprush of subliminal faculty\u2014an uprush like that of\ngenius, but less wisely directed\u2014depending upon a lack of liminal\nstability, an excessive permeability, if I may so say, of the psychical\ndiaphragm which separates the empirical from the latent faculties of\nman.\nWith the confirmed and often hereditary hysteric of the hospitals,\non the other hand, the leading phenomenon is not the uprush but the\ndown-draught. It is the gradual sinking of one supraliminal faculty\nafter another\u2014sensation, memory, will\u2014into a subliminal region where\nindeed experiment or inference may show them to be still existing, but\nwhere they are useless for the purposes of common life. This is for the\nhuman spirit \" that vast Serbonian bog, where armies whole have\nsunk\"; where its powers are absorbed without annihilation, and rot\nbeneath the treacherous surface in an unseen decay.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 9\nWe must now come to concrete examples. And first let me remind\nthe reader that there is nothing unique or isolated about these hysteri\ncal disturbances of personality. The personality of each of us is in a\nstate of constantly shifting equilibrium, and the healthy person, under\nthe influence of various intoxications, or from mere changes of trophic\ncondition, undergoes shiftings of the threshold, uprushes and sub\nsidences of many kinds, which bear to hysterical phenomena somewhat\nthe same relation which those in turn bear to the more permanent\npsychical changes of actual insanity. Alcoholic intoxication simulates\nin its various stages a strange variety both of hysterical and of insane\nsymptoms. Hunger, fatigue, slight poisoning by impure air, produce a\nwell-known group of disturbances of memory and sensation. A very\nsmall degree of fever is enough to produce a transient perturbation of\npersonality of the most violent kind. Familiar though all this may be,\nthere is yet, I think, some interest in the following account of a feverish\nexperience, sent to me by Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, from Samoa.\nFor in Mr. Stevenson's paper on his own dreams, elsewhere alluded to,\nwe have the most striking living example known to me of that helpful\nand productive subliminal uprush which I have characterised as the\nmechanism of genius. It is, therefore, interesting to observe how\nunder morbid conditions this temperament of genius\u2014this ready per\nmeability of the psychical diaphragm\u2014transforms what might in others\nbe a mere vague and massive discomfort into a vivid though incoherent\nmessage from the subliminal storm and fire. The result is a kind of\nsupraliminal duality, the perception at the same time of two personali\nties,\u2014the one rational and moral, the other belonging to the stratum\nof dreams and nightmare.\nVailima Plantation, Upoho, Samoan Islands.\nJuly 14th, 1892.\nDear Mb. Myers,\u2014I am tempted to communicate to you some experi\nences of mine which seem to me (ignorant as I am) of a high psychological\ninterest.\nI had infamous bad health when I was a child and suffered much from\nnight fears ; but from the age of about thirteen until I was past thirty I\ndid not know what it was to have a high fever or to wander in my mind.\nSo that these experiences, when they were renewed, came upon me with\nentire freshness ; and either I am a peculiar subject, or I was thus enabled\nto observe them with unusual closeness.\nExperience A. During an illness at Nice I lay awake a whole night in\nextreme pain. From the beginning of the evening cme part of my mind be\ncame possessed of a notion so grotesque and shapeless that it may best be\ndescribed as a form of words. I thought the pain was, or was connected\nwith, a wisp or coil of some sort ; I knew not of what it consisted nor yet\nwhere it was, and cared not ; only I thought, if the two ends were brought\ntogether the pain would cease. Now all the time, with another part of my\nmind, which I venture to think was myself, I was fully alive to the absurdity\n\f10 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nof this idea, knew it to be a mark of impaired sanity, and was engaged with\nmy other self in a perpetual conflict. Myself had nothing more at heart than\nto keep from my wife, who was nursing me, any hint of this ridiculous\nhallucination ; the other was bound that she should be told of it and ordered\nto effect the cure. I believe it must have been well on in the morning:\nbefore the fever (or the other fellow) triumphed, and I called my wife to\nmy bedside, seized her savagely by the wrist, and looking on her with a face\nof fury, cried : \" Why do you not put the two ends together and put me out\nof pain ? \"\nExperience B. The other day in Sydney I was seized on a Saturday\nwith a high fever. Early in the afternoon I began to repeat mechanically\nthe sound usually written \"mhn,\" caught myself in the act, instantly\nstopped it, and explained to my mother, who was in the room, my reasons\nfor so doing. \"That is the beginning of the mind to wander,\" I said,\n\" and has to be resisted at the outset.\" I fell asleep and woke, and for the\nrest of the night repeated to myself mentally a nonsense word which I could\nnot recall next morning. I had been reading the day before the life of\nSwift, and all night long one pait of my mind (<7ie other fellow) kept inform\ning me that I was not repeating the word myself, but was only reading in\na book that Swift had so repeated it in his last sickness. The temptation,\nto communicate this nonsense was again strongly felt by myself, but was on.\nthis occasion triumphantly resisted, and my watcher heard from me all\nnight nothing of Dean Swift or the word, nothing but what was rational\nand to the point. So much for the two consciousnesses when I can\ndisentangle them ; but there is a part of my thoughts that I have\nmore difficulty in attributing. One part of my mind continually bid me re\nmark the transnational felicity of the word, examined all the syllables,\nshowed me that not one was in itself significant, and yet the whole expressed\nto a nicety the voluminous distress of one in a high fever and his annoyance\nat and recoil from the attentions of his nurses. It was probably the same\npart (and for a guess the other fellow) who bid me compare it with the non\nsense words of Lewis Carroll as the invention of a lunatic with those of a\nsane man. But surely it was myself (and myself in a perfectly clear-headed\nstate) that kept me trying all night to get the word by heart, on the ground\nthat it would afterwards be useful in literature if I wanted to deal with mad\nfolk. It must have been myself, I say, because the other fell&w believed (or\npretended to believe) he was reading the passage in a book where it could\nalways be found again when wanted.\nExperience C. The next night the other fellow had an explanation ready\nfor my sufferings, of which I can only say that it had something to do with\nthe navy, that it was sheer undiluted nonsense, had neither end nor be\nginning, and was insusceptible of being expressed in words. Myself knew\nthis ; yet I gave way, and my watcher was favoured with some references to\nthe navy. Nor only that : the other felloic was annoyed\u2014or I was annoyed\n\u2014on two inconsistent accounts ; first, because he had failed to make his\nmeaning comprehensible, and second, because the nurse displayed no\ninterest. The other fellow would have liked to explain further ; but myself\nwas much hurt at having been got into this false position and would be led\nno further.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 11\nIn cases A and C the illusion was amorphous. I knew it to be so and yet\nsuccumbed to the temptation of trying to communicate it. In case B the\nidea was coherent, and I managed to hold my peace. Both consciousnesses,\nin other words, were less affected in case B, and both more affected in cases\nA and C. It is perhaps not always so : the illusion might be coherent, even\npractical, and the rational authority of the mind quite in abeyance. Would\nnot that be lunacy ?\nIn case A I had an absolute knowledge that I was out of my mind, and\nthat there was no meaning in my words ; these were the very facts that I\nwas anxious to conceal ; and yet when I succumbed to the temptation of\nspeaking, my face was convulsed with anger, and I wrung my watcher's\nwrist with cruelty. Here is action, unnatural and uncharacteristic action,\nflowing from an idea in which I had no belief and which I had been conceal\ning for hours as a plain mark of aberration. Is it not so with lunatics 1\nI have called the one person myself, and the other the other fellow. It\nwas myself who spoke and acted ; the other fellow seemed to have no control\nof the body or the tongue ; he could only act through myself, on whom he\nbrought to bear a heavy strain, resisted in one case, triumphant in the two\nothers. Yet I am tempted to think that I know the other fellow ; I am\ntempted to think he is the dreamer described in my Chapter on Dreams to\nwhich you refer. Here at least is a dream belonging to the same period,\nbut this time a pure dream, an illusion, I mean, that disappeared with the\nreturn of the sense of sight, not one that persevered during waking moments\nand while I was able to speak and take my medicine. It occurred the day\nafter case B and before case C.\nCase D. In the afternoon there sprang up a storm of wind with\nmonstrous clouds of dust ; my room looked on a steep hill of trees whose\nboughs were all blowing in the same direction ; the world seemed to pass by\nmy windows like a mill-race. By this turmoil and movement I was confused,\nbut not distressed, and surprised not to be distressed ; for even in good\nhealth a high wind has often a painful influence on my nerves. In the midst\nof this I dozed off asleep. I had just been reading Scott's Life of Dryden,\nhad been struck with the fact that Dryden had translated some of the\nLatin hymns, and had wondered that I had never remarked them in his works.\nAs soon as I was asleep I dreamed a reason why the sound of the wind and\nthe sight of the flying dust had not distressed me. There was no wind, it\nseemed, no dust ; it was only Dryden singing his translated hymns in one\ndirection, and all those who had blamed and attacked him after the Revolu\ntion singing them in another. This point of the two directions is very\nsingular and insane. In part it meant that Dryden was continuously flying\npast yet never passing my window in the direction of the wind and dust,\nand all his detractors similarly flying past yet not passing towards the other\nside. But it applied, besides this, both to the words and to the music in a\nmanner wholly insusceptible of expression.\nThat was a dream ; and yet how exactly it reproduces the method of my\notherfellow while I was awake. Here is an explanation for a state of mind\nor body sought\u2014and found\u2014in a tissue of rabid, complicated, and inex\npressible folly.\u2014Yours very sincerely, Robert Louis Stevenson.\nLet us now turn to cases of definitely hysterical uprush from sub\n\f12 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nliminal \u2014and, as I have maintained, specially from hypnotic strata. It\nwill begin by some citations from one of the best recent German sources,\nthat the English reader may see that these observations are not peculiar\nto the French schooL\nIn an important essay contributed to the Neurologisches Cenlral-\nblatt, for January 1st and January 15th, 1893, Dr. Joseph Breuer and\nDr. Sigm. Freud, of Vienna (in which capital there has already been much\nfruitful study of hysteria), give a preliminary account of a long series\nof observations on \"The Psychical Mechanism of Hysterical Phe\nnomena,\" especially with regard to the nature of the incident which\nhas originally started the train of symptoms. That incident, they say,\ncannot usually be discovered by examination of the patient in his\nordinary condition. He will not realise its connection with his present\ntrouble, he may even have forgotten it altogether. But hypnotise him,\nand he will clearly remember the incident itself, will fully realise its\nperturbing effect on his psychical equilibrium. In fact he will usually\ntell you that this very incident reproduces itself with distressing vivid\nness in every attack which he undergoes. This close connection\nbetween some initial lesion and the subsequent troubles is observable\nnot only in cases of so-called traumatic hysteria, where the effect of the\nprimary shock\u2014-the rupture (if I may so call it) of the psychical\ndiaphragm\u2014is marked and obvious, but also in cases where the complex\nand persistent troubles are commonly regarded as spontaneous and\nidiopathic hysterical symptoms. Among such symptoms which have\nbeen found on analysis to be reproductions, more or less symbolical in\ncharacter, of some definite original shock, are neuralgia, contractures,\ntic, persistent vomiting and anorexia, troubles of sight, hallucinations,\ntfec. A momentary accident at the time of maximum shock may\ndetermine the character of years of malady ; much as in certain cases\nof aphasia (Cf. the \" come on to me \" case, to which I have often\nalluded) the last sentence healthily spoken will dominate the aphasic\nutterance ever after. Thus a German girl, endeavouring to pray in a\nmoment of bewildered anguish, could think of nothing but an English\nchild's prayer ; somewhat as men, piously reared, when in danger\nof shipwreck, have been heard muttering \" What is your name 1 M. or\nTST.,\"\u2014the first words of the English Church Catechism. Hysteria\ndeveloped itself, and for a year and a half this German girl could speak,\nwrite, and understand nothing but English. In other cases the connec\ntion between the original psychical lesion and the subsequent symptoms\nis dreamlike or symbolical in character; as when a shock of moral\n\u2022disgust is followed by persistent hysterical vomiting. The distressing\nidea which caused the original lesion seems to continue to keep up\nirritation like a foreign body lodged in the organism, say a thorn in the\n-finger. It must be brought to the surface and extruded ;\u2014the painful\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 13\nmemory must be diagnosed in the hypnotised patient and then brought\nback to his waking consciousness and freely discussed, and thus\nreduced to its due proportions. \" A mere unemotional recollection,\" say\nDrs. Breuer and Freud, \" is generally useless ; the psychical process\nwhich caused the trouble must be again set on foot, brought down to its\nstatus nascendi, and then worked out (abreagirt) and talked away.\" The\nneuralgia or the hallucination will thus recur once in full intensity and\nthen disappear for ever. The act of thus luring the hypertrophied idea\nup from the hypnotic into the supraliminal stratum is quite analogous\nto the \" bringing out \" of an eruption, or the re-establishment of an\narrested secretion. The benefit of tears in emotional shock\u2014\"she\nmust weep, or she will die \"\u2014comes just midway beween the benefit of\nauricular confession and the benefit of getting out a good crop\nof measles.\n\" It is not in the normal memory of the patient,\" continue our\nauthors, with emphasis, \" but in his hypnotic memory, that the recol\nlection of the operative psychical lesion is to be found. The more we\nbusy ourselves with these phenomena, the surer becomes our conviction\nthat that sundering of consciousness which is so striking in certain\nclassical cases of duplex personality exists in rudimentary fashion in\nevery case of hysteria. The tendency to this dissociation, and conse\nquently to the appearance of abnormal states of consciousness, which we\npropose to include under the term hypnoid, is the fundamental\nphenomenon of the hysterical neurosis. . . . Beside the well-\nknown saying, ' Hypnosis is an artificial hysteria,' we would set this\nsomewhat different dictum : The foundation and condition-precedent of\nhysteria is the existence of hypnoid states. Amid all their differences\nthese hypnoid states agree in this ;\u2014that the images which in them rise\nto the surface (auflauchen) are of a very intense character, but are\npartitioned off from the rest of the contents of consciousness. . . .\nThe intimate nature of these hypnoid states, and the degree of their\nseparation from the remainder of consciousness, vary as widely as the\nhypnotic trance itself, which includes all conditions from light somno\nlence to somnambulism, from full recollection to complete forgetful-\nness.\"\nAnd here it is noticeable that Drs. Breuer and Freud, who come\nto this discussion unpledged to any hasty theory, fully recognise the\ngravity\u2014nay the insolubility under present conditions\u2014of that problem\nof the unique effectiveness and power of hypnotic suggestions, and of\nhysterical self-suggestions, for which so many pseudo-solutions have\nbeen based upon so much hypothetical cerebral physiology.\n\" The question,\" they say (p. 44), \" why it is that the pathological\nassociations which form themselves in hypnoid states are so stable,\nand influence organic processes so much \"more profoundly than do the\n\f14 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nideas or presentations of our ordinary experience ;\u2014this question forma\na part of the general problem of the efficacy of hypnotic suggestion in\nany case whatever. Our observations throw no new light on this prob\nlem ; rather they bring into relief the contradiction between the dictum\n' Hysteria is a psychosis,' and the actual fact that amongst hysterics\nwe find the clearest-minded, the strongest-willed, the fullest of char\nacter, the most acutely critical specimens of humanity. In the cases\nto which we refer those characteristics hold good for the man's waking\nconsciousness, but in his hypnoid states he is insane\u2014as we all are in\ndream. But whereas our dream-insanities have no influence on our\nwaking life, in his case the products of his hypnoid conditions break\nin upon his waking life as hysterical symptoms.\"\nI need not point out the independent coincidence between these\nviews and those already expressed in my chapter on \"The Mechanism\nof Suggestion,\" and elsewhere.1 But I may repeat my conviction that\nthis problem can only be solved by continued research into what I deem\nthe healthy and orderly functioning of those subliminal faculties\nwhich hypnotic suggestion reveals to us acting blindly as in a dream,\nand which hysteria reveals to us acting wildly as in a nightmare.\n\" In hysteria,\" say our authors once more, after citing further ex\namples of these disturbed messages, these explosive uprushes from sub\nliminal strata,\u2014\" in hysteria we are confronted with groups of formed\nimages which have been developed under hypnoid conditions, which are\ncut off from interchange and association with the rest of the patient's\nmental imagery, but are capable of association amongst themselves,\nand thus constitute a more or less fully organised rudiment of a secondary\nconsciousness, a ' condition seconde.' Thus a chronic hysterical symp\ntom corresponds to an incursion of this ' secondary condition ' upon\na tract of innervation previously governed by the normal conscious\nness, while a ' fit of hysterics ' indicates a more organised develop\nment of the ' secondary condition,' and marks by its first onset a\nmoment when this hypnoid consciousness (Hypnoidbetvusslsein) has\nmade itself master of the whole existence, as acute hysteria.\nDuring such an attack the control over the whole bodily innervation\nhas passed to the hypnoid consciousness. Yet the normal conscious\nness, as some well-known experiments show us, is not always entirely\nset aside. It can itself take note of the motor phenomena of the\nattack, although the psychical conditions-precedent of that attack lie\noutside its cognisance altogether.\"\nI could not wish for a more emphatic support, from wide clinical\nexperience, of the view of hysteria to which my own observations on\ndifferent branches of automatism had already, by mere analogical\n1 See Procecdingt, Vol. VII., pp. 300, 349, 353, &c.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 15\nreasoning, directed my thought.1 What I would fain add to the\nexposition of Drs. Breuer and Freud the reader may have already\ndivined. That extraordinary potency of subliminal action, which they\nfrankly present as insoluble by pure physiology, is part and parcel of\nmy scheme of man ; and its occasional appearance in this disordered\nform is to me but the natural concomitant of its habitual and\ninevitable residence within us ; in readiness\u2014if we can contrive to\nsummon it\u2014to subserve our highest needs.\nFor I have urged that we men here incarnated are in very truth\n\" clausi tenebris et carcere caeco \" ;\u2014that in this darkness and imprison\nment our terrene faculties represent merely such fraction of our pre-\nterrene faculties as the struggle for existence has compelled the\norganisms from which our bodies spring to conserve and develop. And\nI have claimed that,the potential faculties which terrene evolution has\nnot thus developed do none the less make themselves manifest from\ntime to time in terrene life ; that gleams of a wider perception, a truer\ninsight, may flash into the darkened and narrowed chamber of con\nsciousness which our earthly brain allows. Apart from such super\nnormal visitings, the evolutive process consists, in my view, of a constant\nexpansion of the span of supraliminal consciousness ; a constant\nre-selection of faculties and perceptions to suit an ever more extended\npurview, a wider present which opens upon man. We add the higher\nartistic and moral faculties\u2014drawing these from their latency in the\ndepths of our subliminal being ;\u2014and at the same time we lose the\npower of repairing injuries which our remote ancestors possessed, the\nacuter sense of smell which our near ancestors possessed ;\u2014and who\nknows what other faculties which existed somewhere in our long ances\ntral line ? We widen, deepen, and select. The spectrum of empirical\nconsciousness grows both longer and brighter ; but some dark lines\nappear in places which once were bright.\nA process thus involving our own selves may be as difficult to\nexamine directly, and by our own sensations, as it is to examine directly,\nand by our own sensations, the rotation of the earth. Or, to recur to\nour earlier metaphor, if we would study solar physics we do not only\nwatch for changes in the spectrum of our noonday sun ; we look for\nthe spectrum of a sun in the making, or of a sun eclipsed, or of a sun\n1 Conceptions of what I have called ttratified consciousness are now coming to\nthe front in so many places that it may be of interest to remark that (so far as I\nknow) such a conception first presented itself independently to three observers, as\nthe result of three different lines of experiment. Mr. Gurney was led that way by\nexperiments on hypnotic memory ; M. Pierre Janet by experiments on hysteria ; and\nto myself the observation of various automatisms neither hysterical nor hypnotic,\u2014as\nautomatic script and the like\u2014brought a still more developed (I do not say a better\nestablished) conception of the stratified nature of our psychical being, of the higher\nfaculties discernible in the deeper strata, and of the unity which comprehends them\nall.\n\f16 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nalready darkening down into the night. The animal world still exists\nto show us our sun of terrene consciousness in its nebulous making\nsleep and trance show that sun eclipsed ; and the subliminal uprushes,\nseen more clearly when waking consciousness is obscured, are for us\nwhat for the astronomer are the rosy prominences, upleaping from the\nhidden flame.\nBut where shall we get our spectrum of a sun going out ? Where,\nin plain words, shall we come upon a process dissolutive of terrene\npersonality which may be the nearest approach to a precise reversal of\nthe evolutive process which our hypothesis has assumed 1 For this we\nneed some slow, functional brain-degeneration, not dependent upon any\nlocalised lesion or any specific intoxication. The process through senile\ndecay to the coma of imminent dissolution has already furnished us with\nsome observations strongly corroborative of the scheme of personality\nhere proposed. Of vivid, supernormal messages received or transmitted\nat or about the moment of death,\u2014and of the inferences which such\nfacts suggest,\u2014my readers have heard much and often. But for the\ndetailed study here desired we need to find a narrowing of the field of\nconsciousness at once more definitely progressive and more persistent\nunder our prolonged experiment.\nNow, surely, is the moment to remember that other result of hys\nterical loss of liminal stability to which we have as yet barely alluded.\nWe have said that when the psychical diaphragm has once given way\nthere is down-draught as well as uprush. Besides the incursions from\nthe hypnotic stratum of which we have been speaking, there are losses\nfrom the supraliminal stratum ;\u2014narrowings of empirical consciousness\nwhich may look like absolute abolitions of familiar powers, but\nwhich often turn out to be the mere subsidence of those powers to a\nlevel where the empirical will can no longer reach them. Such are\nindeed the main phenomena of advanced, of chronic hysteria; and to these\nwe must now turn ; seeking whether in this disintegrative process there\nare traces of the original mode of integration ; whether, when the\nstratum which remains supraliminal is thinned to a shell and straitened\nto a speck, there come to it upward messages from its own lost wealth\nand submerged powers,\u2014simulating in that miserepsyclwloyique the gifts\nonce sent upwards to its affluence from the still richer treasure-house\nbelow. In this inquiry we can have no better guide than Dr. Pierre\nJanet, whose recent work, L'Etat Mental des Hysteriqnes, is full of\nprecisely such observations as must either confirm or altogether dis\ncredit the theory with which we are now concerned.\nWhat then, to begin with, is M. Janet's general conception of the\npsychological state of the advanced hysteric ?\n\" In the expression \/ feel,\" he says (Etat Mental, p. 39), \" we have\ntwo elements ; a small new psychological fact ' feel,' and an enormous\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 17\nmass of thoughts already formed into a system ' L' These two things\nmi-x and combine, and to say I feel is to say that the personality,\nalready enormous, has seized and absorbed this small new sensation ;\n. . . as though the \/ were an amoeba which sent out a prolongation\nto suck in this little sensation which has come into existence beside\nit.\" Now it is in the assimilation of these elementary sensations\nor affective states with the perception personnelle, as Janet terms\nit, that the advanced hysteric fails. Her field of consciousness is\nso far narrowed that it can only take in the minimum of sensations\nnecessary for the support of life. \" One must needs have consciousness\nof what one sees and hears, and so the patient neglects to perceive the\ntactile and muscular sensations with which he thinks that he can\nmanage to dispense. At first he could perhaps turn his attention to\nthem, and recover them at least momentarily within the field of personal\nperception. But the occasion does not present itself, and the psycho\nlogical bad habit is formed. . . . One day the patient\u2014for he is\nnow veritably a patient\u2014is examined by the doctor. His left arm is\npinched, and he is asked whether he feels the pinch. To his surprise\nthe patient realises that he can no longer feel consciously, can no longer\nbring back into his personal perception sensations which he has\nneglected too long\u2014he has become anaesthetic. . . . Hysterical\nanaesthesia is thus a fixed and perpetual distraction, which renders\nits subjects incapable of attaching certain sensations to their person\nality ; it is a restriction of the conscious field.\"\nOn just the same principles may the amnesia and the akinesia\nor pseudo-paralysis of hysterics\u2014which last is really an aboulia or\ndefect of will and not a paralysis\u2014be explained. In each case there\nis a dropping out from attention of groups of recollections, which\nthrough enfeebled attention (aprosexia,) the patient is no longer able\nto grasp. The life has shrunk to the smallest needs of the actual\nmoment ; it has ceased to look before and after ; its threshold of\nconsciousness has mounted higher, so that the waking consciousness of\nthe hysteric embraces only a shallow and narrow layer of what was the\nwaking consciousness of the healthy man. \" 0 dear spirit, half-lost In\nthine own shadow \" ;\u2014surely the words which the poet addresses to the\nman-soul undergoing its descent into generation gain a fresh signifi\ncance if we apply them to the man-soul thus shadowed anew; his\nnormal terrene consciousness shrinking into a fragment, even as into\na fragment had shrunk already at earthly birth his memory of \" the\nglories he had known, And that imperial palace whence he came.\"\nLet us see if there is more in this analogy than a poetic fancy. I\nhave urged\u2014and the idea draws its descent from philosophers as well\nas poets\u2014that amid our normal terrene life we trace incursions of\na subliminal consciousness, with obscure pre-terrene memories, frag-\nc\n\f18 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmentary pre-terrene powers. And I now ask whether any like incur\nsion of pre-Salpetriere faculties, any obscure traces of the freer, more\npotent life of old, are discernible amid the narrowed life of hysterics,\nand show to those who watch them from a larger existence that amid\nall their dimness and bewilderment those imprisoned spirits yet \" are\ngreater than they know \" 1\nLet us take first a question as definite as may be possible ;\u2014the\nquestion of field of vision and subsequent visual memory. I have\ncontended that what we know that we see is not really all that we see,\nand that what we know that we remember is not really all that we\nremember. I have urged that it is at least possible that whatever has\nonce fallen within our actual field of vision may be perceived by the\nsubliminal self and permanently registered in the subliminal memory,\nand I have adduced cases where dream or crystal-vision has brought to\nthe surface some fact thus subliminally observed, but which provably\nhas never come within the cognisance oi the supraliminal self. And I\nhave suggested that albeit the messages or reports of unobserved objects\nthus cast up from the subliminal storehouse\u2014\" the treasure of the\nheart \"\u2014were often casual-seeming and trivial, yet sometimes also\nthey seemed to show selective choice, and to indicate a guardianship\nsubliminally exercised over the ignorance and folly of the empirical\nself.\nCan we, then, find any parallel phenomena in hysteria 1 Are there\nany cases where the narrowed and shallowed field of hysterical con\nsciousness receives messages from the normal perceptive faculty, still\npersisting, though in what has now become a subliminal fashion? and\nare such messages ever made useful as warnings of danger, or as\nguidance to a fruitful end 1\nThanks to the delicacy of modern experiments on various\nanaesthesue, and especially on optical defects, it is now possible to\ndistinguish between the range of perception (visual field, &c.), of which\nhysterics have conscious control, and the range of perception (visual\nfield, &c.), from which a certain amount of information reaches them in\nan unconscious fashion. Thus, for instance, it has now long been\nknown that a hysteric might assert himself to be totally blind of the\nright eye, while yet, if he was made to look at a given object with his\nright eye, while believing that he was looking at it with his left, he\ncould see the object perfectly well. This anomaly was naturally\nsupposed to be due to mere simulation. Similar anomalies were soon\nobserved in hysterical colour-blindness. The green (for example) which\nthe hysteric said he could not see did nevertheless affect the retina\nand induce a complementary after-image. A still more naive attempt\n(as it might seem) at deceit was exhibited by one of Professor Janet's\nsubjects, who, when her head was placed behind a screen and the two\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 19\nsides of her body\u2014that on which she could feel and that on which she\ncould not feel\u2014were pinched at intervals, replied, \"I feel,\" whenever the\nsensitive side was pinched, and \" I don't feel \" whenever the pinch was\non the soi-disant insensitive side.\nBut in truth,\u2014although I must refer my readers to Professor Janet's\nbook (see especially pp. 35-7) for the proof of what I here summarise,\u2014\nin truth we are dealing in the great mass of these cases not with deceit\nnor with recklessness, but with a condition of things which, since it\nhas till lately entirely baffled medical interpretation, may well have\nbeen puzzling enough to have bewildered the sufferers themselves.\nWe are dealing with a fluctuating constriction of the conscious field ;\nwith a shifting faculty which can at one moment embrace some given\nstimulation within the range of \" personal perception,\"\u2014as something\nwhich the \" I \" cognises as \" my \" sensation,\u2014and then at the next\nmoment loses grasp of the stimulation, which thus falls back into the\ncondition of an \" elementary sensation,\" in some sense still existing\nbut no longer comprised in the conscious personality. Or the differ\nence may be, not between one minute of wider and the next of\nnarrower purview, but between one mode and another mode of per\nceiving the stimulus ;\u2014the colour green, for instance, remaining\nunnoted when the subject endeavours to apply a voluntary act of\nchoice among colours, but still manifesting itself to the more deeply-\nlying, more automatic perception which feels the red blur when the\nretina is exhausted by prolonged gazing on the green spot.\nThese phenomena, which to readers unfamiliar with the subject may\nlook so dubious, are phenomena common both in incipient and in estab\nlished hysteria; and their reality derives a stern confirmation from the\ncases in which their slow advance\u2014still on the same lines of contracting\npersonality, shrinking power- of attention\u2014lands the sufferer at last\nin worldly ruin, in compulsory seclusion, in insanity and irremediable\ndecay. For ourselves every stage of this process is rich in parallels\nwith our larger conception of pre-terrene personality submitting to,\nand reacting against, the limitations of the flesh. The internuntial\nmessages which for us reach the normal terrene field or stratum of\npersonality from profounder strata are paralleled for the hysteric by\nthe messages which reach the shallowed hysteric stratum from the\nremainder of the normal terrene field. In each case such messages\nmay be frequent or rare, trivial, or apparently purposive and designed\nto guide or restrain. They are frequent and trivial in the crystal-seer\nwho can summon up a picture almost at will ; and in the hysterical\ngirl who, with her ordinary field of vision contracted almost to a point,\nis yet able to play at ball with her companions ; the slight excitement\nof the exercise widening the visual field sufficiently to allow her to\nfollow the ball's flight through the air. Again, the messages are rare\nc 2\n\f20 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nand monitory in such incidents in healthy lives as that (already\npublished) of the hurrying lady who saw the figure whose presence\nchecked her from falling through the open door of the elevator ;\u2014or of\nthat other lady whom a sense of a touch on the arm hindered from\nheedlessly throwing her banknotes into the fire. And in like fashion\nthey are rare and monitory in the hysteric who has long lost all feeling\nin the hands, but who nevertheless in some way avoids the burns on\nthe hands characteristic of that profound insensibility which follows on\nthe nervous lesions of syringo-myelitis.\nAgain, we have printed several instances where the nearness of\nsome object, not cognisable by the ordinary senses (as the dried body\nof a baby in the roof, the buried body of a murdered man in a field), has\napparently caused a distress or alarm which the supraliminal self has\nbeen unable to explain. Somewhat similarly we find that when an object\nwhich specially stimulates the hysterical fears of a given subject (as\na lighted match, a stuffed mouse,) is brought within what would be\nthe normal visual field of a hysteric, the alarming object starts a hys\nterical attack, although an indifferent object fails to be discerned until\nbrought within the very much narrower visual field over which alone\nthe hysteric is aware of having any sight. The parallel is maintained\nas to subliminal calculation. \" When I count,\" said a hysteric, \" I\nwrite the result, but I know that I have-not really worked the sum.\nI no longer understand my own ideas ; they seem to come of themselves ;\nit is as though they were written on a great roll of paper which un\nwinds itself before me.\" Compare the \" mental blackboard \" of the\n\" calculating boy.\" Did space allow it, we might follow out these analo\ngies in further detail. It must here suffice to say that this great mass\nof hysterical phenomena seems explicable only by the very conception\nwhich we have elsewhere advanced on a larger scale,\u2014the principle\nof a restricted personality reinforced by intimations or messages pro\nceeding from a wider personality subjacent but habitually unreachable ;\n\u2014yet, meantime, more or less cognisant of the proceedings of the em\npirical self.\nTurning from sensory to motor automatism, the more special topic\nof this paper, let us again consider what phenomena our theory would\nlead us to expect.\nDo we find that beneath the kinesthetic obtuseness, the confused\nataxia, the impotent aboulia of these miserable women there are any\nindications that the complex movements once acquired are not really\nforgotten 1 that there is still a will which can rule the organism in the\nold way ? If so, we shall have a fresh parallel to our conception of a\nmore potent and profounder personality, underlying for us normal\npersons also the personality which we know. When the hysteric is in\nan \" aboulic \" state\u2014has lost the power to will any action which\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 21\npresents novelty or difficulty\u2014do we find that she can still perform\nsuch actions without conscious will, and as though by help of a motor\nmessage transmitted from the self which for her is now subliminal but\nwhich in health was the self which was habitually in conscious play ?\nHave we parallels of this kind to the automatic writing or drawing of\nthe normal man ? or to his automatic speech 1 or to those inspirations\nof genius which transcend the fruits of conscious toil ? I leave it to\none of Prof. Janet's hysterics to reply :\u2014\n\" I cannot in the least understand what is going on,\" said Maria, when\nshe entered the hospital ; \"for some time past I have been working in an\nodd way ; it is no longer I who am working, but only my hands. They\nget on pretty well, but I have no part in what they do. When it is over I\n-do not recognise my work at all. I see that it is all right ; but I feel that I\nam quite incapable of having accomplished it. If anyone said, It is not yon\nwho did that ! I would answer, True enough, it is not I. When I want to\nsing, it is impossible to me ; yet at other times I hear my voice singing the\n:8ong very well. It is certainly not I who walk ; I feel like a balloon which\njumps up and down of itself. When I want to write, I find nothing to say,\nmy head is empty, and I must let my hand write what it chooses, and it fills\nfour pages, and if the stuff is silly I cannot help it,\"\n\"The curious point is,\" continues M. Janet, \"that in this fashion she\n.produces some really good things. If she makes up a dress or writes a letter\nshe sometimes shows real talent, but it is all done in a bizarre way. She\nlooksabsorbed in her work, but yet unconscious of it; when she lifts her head\nshe seems dazed as if she was coming out of a dream, and does not recollect\nwhat she has been doing. Her way of acting recalls what is said of men of\n:genius who obey their inspiration without being themselves aware of accom\nplishing their masterpieces. ... To take a humbler comparison, she acts\n-as we occasionally do when we let our hand write of itself a word which we\nhave forgotten how to spell. But what with us is accidental is with her per\npetual ; although she has still activity she has no longer the personal\nconsciousness of this activity, and her acts therefore can no longer be\ncalled voluntary. . . . Some patients, on the other hand, will not or cannot\nabandon themselves to this automatic activity. They try to perform\nthe actions consciously and voluntarily, and then they fail altogether. \"\nI pass on to one of M. Janet's most acute observations 1 ;\u2014a case\nwhere the difference between the faculty still at the command of the\nsupraliminal personality and the faculty transmissible only by\nautomatic impulse from the self now subliminal reaches its maximum\npoint, and suggests some reflections of novel import.\n\"If we tell hemiplegics or amyotrophies to squeeze the dynamo\nmeter, we get such figures as 5 and 10,\u2014very much what these hysterics\nmanage to reach. But with the truly paralysed such figures do not\nsurprise us. We know that we are dealing with impotent persons,\nwhose every action shows their weakness. But our hysterics who mark\n1 Elal Mental de> Hystiriquti, p. 171.\n\fMr. F. W. H. Myers.\n5 and 10 are by no means impotent ; they sew, they work, they carry\nburdens without any apparent trouble. Ctlestine, for instance, is a\nrobust country girl, accustomed to hard work, and still asking as a\nfavour to be allowed to sweep and rub the floors. She is quick^\ntempered, and when things do not go just as she likes she shakes the\nbeds, changes their places, and lifts with one arm the wooden armchairs.\nShe has terrible fits of passion ; and in some asylums where she has\nbeen she has soundly thrashed strong men. Well ;\u2014I stop this young\nwoman in the middle of her work, and give her the dynamometer to\nsqueeze. To begin with, she is absolutely anaesthetic on both sides of\nher body, and must needs look at the instrument in order to be able to\nsqueeze it at all. I have tried this experiment often ; and the\ndynamometer generally marks 9 with the squeeze of her right hand, 5\nwith that of her left. Now I repeat that such indications of feeble\nmuscular power are in complete contradiction with what I see her doing\nevery minute. I have made the trial myself, and although I can\nsqueeze the same dynamometer up to 50, I cannot lift and move\nthe chairs and beds as Celestine does. ... It is clear that in the\nhysteric there is a special modification of muscular power when she is\nmade the subject of an experiment ;\u2014when she is told to pay attention,\nand to squeeze an instrument with personal will in order to show her\npersonal strength. She can then no longer get at her strength ; she\ncannot use it in this fashion ; albeit the strength is really there and\nis lavishly expended in all the acts of common life, when the patient\nis not thinking of it. What we have here is a defect not of muscle\nbut of will.\"\nI venture to make such a case as Celestine's the starting point of a\ns range speculation. Suppose that it becomes necessary to form a con\nception of what really happens when a \"spirit\" is said to move an\nobject lying near a \" medium,\" but beyond his normal reach ; suppose\nthat we come to think that here, too, as in hysteria itself, there is\nsomething beyond the fraud and beneath the confusion,\u2014will these\nhysterical phenomena afford us any analogy, however remote 1 We see\nthese hysterics with the strength of a mere baby at command, the\nstrength of a strong man latent and operating through another\nstratum of the self. We see them with only vague and feeble move\nments under their conscious control ; while strong and definite\nmovements are still evocable by suggestion coming from without.\nAnd now let us suppose that each man brought with him into earth-\nlife a force or will capable of a far more exhausting (and a far less\nuseful) form of activity than that on which he usually employs it. He\nuses it to act somehow upon the brain, and somehow upon the nerves,\nand so to move heavy objects in contact with his muscular organism.\nBut it is also (on our hypothesis) capable of moving small objects\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 23\nwhich are near his person, but not actually in contact with it. Now\nif for a long time he should fail to discover this power of his, that need\nby no means surprise us. Until a few years ago he had failed to discover\nthat he could affect matter at a little distance from him in a far more\nstriking way ; namely, that he could light a fire with his fingers. Yet\nhow to light a fire was the most essential discovery which man ever\nmade ; and no one knows how many thousand years it took our\nancestors to make it. If the cave-man, and Aristotle, and Bacon\ntogether could have seen the summer-boarder at Colorado Springs\nlighting the gas with his fingers, would they not have exclaimed, \" Ou\nsupercherie, ou miracle 1 \" in absolute unison 1 Yet all that the summer-\nboarder needed to do was to rub his feet on the floor.\nSuppose, then, that man is born in virtual possession of this telekinetic\npower,\u2014this capacity of acting upon ponderable objects at a short dis\ntance from his person in some way not wholly different from the way in\nwhich he acts upon his own limbs. And suppose that this latent power\nis not called forth and developed by natural selection, but remains\nunobserved and unsuspected in the subliminal strata of his being. He\ncan now move by voluntary effort only objects in contact with his\nperiphery ; just as the hysteric by voluntary effort can only squeeze the\ndynamometer with a baby's strength. But sometimes that power, less\ndeeply subliminal in some of us men than in others, crops up in\nsome \" spontaneous physical phenomenon,\" or movement of an object\nat a small distance in accordance with no known law. So also with\nC^lestine, the muscular strength\u2014now for her subliminally controlled,\n\u2014crops up sometimes in sudden action, when the hands that can\nscarce deflect the little brass index thrash the strong man. Or some\ntimes it may be that some other fuller intelligence, possessing man's\nterrene faculties in their entirety, and knowing that the hysteric does\nin truth possess those faculties too, will evoke by suggestion and\nartifice the latent power which the hysteric herself could never reach.\nEven so does M. Janet, who knows that Isabelle's co-ordinating power\nis really intact, tell her to touch her face, and she succeeds in doing\nso ; although if she tries to do this without his command her hands\ngo helplessly astray. If we men also have lost by disuse and forget-\nfulness some pre-natal power, can we conceive that intelligences who\nconsciously possess that power, and who discern it in us also, may by\nsuggestion and artifice bring it to the surface, and startle us as\nM. Janet startles the confused hysteric by the seemingly impossible\nresurgence of what is her Self indeed 1\nOne more reflection, and I have done. I would call attention\nto the hysterical indifference; to the apathy or frivolity of these\nwretched sufferers ; to their unconsciousness of their own lost powers,\nof their paralysing disabilities;\u2014of what we feel, in spite of all\n\f24 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nthat apathy, to be their pitiful and bewildered woe. Is it a question\nof anaesthesia, or of contraction of the visual field 1 To the ordinary\nman even slight losses of cutaneous sensation are distressing and\nunforgettable. In graver disturbances,\u2014to sufferers, for instance,\nfrom the \" tabetic mask \" of facial insensibility,\u2014the affliction is no\nless than terrible. So likewise a retrenchment of the field of vision\nwhen caused by pigmentary retinitis will induce a sense of distressed\nconfusion quite disproportionate to the actual loss of self-guiding\npower. But the hysteric, on the other hand, will support with absolute\nindifference sometimes an almost punctiform retrenchment of the visual\nfield, sometimes an anesthesia of half or of all her body. 1 She will not\neven be aware of her complete incapacity to distinguish objects by touch.\nSometimes, indeed, she will save from the wreck of her sensibility\nsome pre-hysteric reminiscence, some knowledge which\u2014to adapt again\nthe poet's description of man's limitation by earthly birth\u2014she has\n\" trailed \" after her, \" not in entire forgetfulness, and not in utter\nnakedness,\" from that common world of humanity from which she\nis now exiled. She will still know by touch a comb, an earring, the\nfeel of her own fringe of hair. She will dwell fondly on these recog\nnised objects, and play with the shells which she has thus picked up\nupon the shore of the ocean of truth.\nIs it loss of will, of memory, from which she suffers ? If no\ndemand is made upon her, no stimulus applied, she will pass days in\nre-reading the same newspaper, re-knitting the same pattern, with no\napparent desire for progress, nor outlook beyond the present hour.\nSometimes indeed there will be \" obstinate questionings of sense and\noutward things \" : \"Is all this true ? \" said Marcelle at a concert ;\u2014\n\" the music, the dances ;\u2014it seems not true, it must be a dream.\"\nThe same patient, allowed to pass from the hospital ward into the\ngarden, found her \" shadowy recollections \" too much for her peace.\n\" Where am I ? What is this ? \" she cried ;\u2014with \" fallings from her,\nvanishings,\" she felt with anxious feet whether the earth was solid\nbeneath her; and, \" moving about in worlds not realised,\" her whole\noutlook merged into the dark.\nMight not this tale be told, mutato nomine, of the whole race of\nmortal men 1 What assurance have we that from some point of higher\nvision we men are not as these shrunken and shadowed souls ?\nSuppose that we had all been a community of hysterics ; all of us\ntogether subject to these shifting losses of sensation, these inexplicable\ngaps of memory, these sudden defects and paralyses of movement and\nof will. Assuredly we should soon have argued that our actual powers\n1 See Janet, op. cit., p. 18, &c. Charcot, Pitres, and many other observers have\ndwelt on the same phenomena ; but here as elsewhere Janet's statement is the best\nfrom the psychological side.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 25\nwere all with which the human organism was or could be endowed.\nWe should have thought it natural that nervous energy should only\njust suffice to keep attention fixed upon the action which at the\nmoment we needed to perform. We should have pointed out that our\nlack of sensation over large tracts of the body rarely led to positive\ninjury ;\u2014but by what means such injury was averted, by the action of\nwhat subjacent intelligence our skin was saved from steel or fire,\u2014of\nthis we should have been too contentedly ignorant even to ask the\nquestion. Nor, again, should we have been astonished at our\ncapricious lack of power over our organisms, our intermittent defect of\nwill. We should have held, and with some reason, that the mystery\nas to how our will could ever move any limb of our bodies was far\ngreater than the mystery as to why certain limbs at certain moments\nfailed to obey it. And as for defects of recollection ;\u2014is the reader\ninclined to think that the hysterical memory could never have been\naccepted as normal 1 That some guess of a more continuous conscious\nness, of an identity unmoved and stable beneath the tossing of the\npsychic storm, must needs have been suggested by all those strange\ninterruptions ?\u2014by the lapses into other phases of personality, by the\ncompeting fields of reminiscence, by the clean sweep and blank\ndestruction of great slices and cantles of the Past ? I ask in turn how\nmuch of guess at an underlying continuity has been suggested, I do not\nsay to the popular, but even to the scientific mind, by life broken as\nwe know it now?\u2014by our nightly lapses into a primitive phase of\npersonality 1 by the competing fields of recollection which shift around\nthe hypnotic trance ? by the irrecoverable gaps in past existence when\nthe sun's ray or the robber's bludgeon has struck too rudely on the skull 1\nNay, if we had been a populace of hysterics we should have\nacquiesced in our hysteria. We should have pushed aside as a fantastic\nenthusiast the fellow sufferer who strove to tell us that this was not\nall that we were meant to be. As we now stand,\u2014each one of us\nlotus, teres, atque rotundus in his own esteem,\u2014we see at least how\ncowardly would have been that contentment, how vast the ignored\npossibilities, the forgotten hope. Yet who assures us that even here\nand now we have developed into the full height and scope of our\nbeing 1 A moment comes when the most beclouded of these hysterics\nhas a glimpse of the truth. A moment comes when, after a profound\nslumber, she wakes into an instant clair ;\u2014a flash of full perception,\nwhich shows her as solid vivid realities all that she has in her bewilder\nment been apprehending phantasmally as a dream.

W. H. Myers.\nChapter VII.\nMotor Automatism.\nThe phenomena of hysteria which we discussed in the last chapter\nwere perhaps in themselves strange to many of my readers. Still\nstranger must have been the hypothesis proposed for their explanation,\nand assuming them under the general theory of personality which\nthese chapters set forth. Yet neither the phenomena themselves\n(attested, indeed, by leading medical authorities), nor the theory\nsuggested could be said to transcend known laws in the same way as\nany form of thought-transference, for instance, transcends them.\nThe \" messages \" which I described as passing between one stratum\nand another of the hysterical personality were purely internuntiative,\nand not telepathic. Their whole course, that is to say, lay within the\nindividual himself ; they transmitted the command or the information\nfrom one part of that individual's intelligence to another ; but they did\nnot involve any supernormal communication of ideas from an extraneous\nmind. Such supernormal element as hysteria does contain is of a\ndifferent order ; it consists in indications of powers beyond what I\nhave called the \" red end \" of the conscious spectrum,\u2014of potent in\nfluences exerted over organic processes by the apparently random orders\nof the dreaming or distracted hypnotic self.\nIn the motor messages to which we are now proceeding, on the other\nhand,\u2014just as in the sensory messages discussed in Chapter V.,\u2014the\nmain interest lies in the original source of the message which in some\nway reaches the automatist's subliminal self, and is thence transferred\nto his supraliminal perception.\nAnd to these definite telepathic motor messages the vaguer inter\nnuntiative, organic messages of hysteria, just discussed, as well as\nthose of hypnotic suggestion, discussed in Chapter II., form a kind\nof approach or introduction. They form such an introduction, I say,\nmore naturally to motor than to sensory messages ; for although the\nsensory messages also\u2014spontaneous hallucinations, crystal-vision and\nthe like\u2014are presumably themselves also based upon and developed\nfrom obscure organic conditions, yet the fact of such development is\nmore obvious, as we shall presently see, with messages which, like\nthose with which we shall deal in this chapter, often involve a consi\nderable amount of varied organic disturbance, from which the definite\nverbal or written message issues at last as the final product towards\nwhich those less specialised efforts have been confusedly tending.\nOur first inquiry, therefore, will naturally be : Are there messages\nwhich conform to the same general type as those hypnotic, those\nhysteric messages, but which differ in containing a telepathic or a.\nclairvoyant element ?\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 27\nThe reader well knows what reply we have to make to this\nquestion. The intermixture of telepathic phenomena in the phenomena\nof hypnotism has been one of our most constant themes of discussion.\nAnd the telepathic phenomena thus observed have often been of that\ncomparatively vague organic kind with which we are at this moment\nspecially concerned. Thus the sensory messages conveyed telepathically\nto the hypnotised subject have not belonged only to the higher,\nexacter senses of sight and hearing. They have included\u2014from the\ntime of Elliotson and Esdaile onwards\u2014impressions made on the less\ndefinite or intellectual senses of taste, smell, temperature, contact and\npain. And there have been motor messages also ;\u2014especially that\ndeep-seated, pervading form of motor message which consists (as of old\nin H. S. Thompson's cases) in an impulse to rush to the distant\nhypnotiser. Without repeating what has been so often narrated, the\nreader may be reminded that at this special point of our scheme\nwe have much corroborative matter to introduce.\nIf, then, hypnotic phenomena have proved thus fruitful in\ntelepathic incident, can we say the same of hysteria 1 Hysterical dis\nturbance mainly affects the infra-red spectrum ; does it ever affect the\nultra-violet spectrum as well 1\nThe answer to this question is still doubtful. It is only in France\nthat there is enough of experiment with hysterics to promise an\nanswer, and one series of French experiments, which seemed at one\ntime to afford an affirmative answer, is not, in my view, sufficiently\nconfirmed. I allude to the supposed transference of hysterical symp\ntoms, by aid of the magnet, from one patient to another, as often\ndemonstrated by Dr. Babinski at the Salpetriere, and kindly shown by\nhim to the late Edmund Gurney and myself. Inasmuch as these\nexperiments, if valid, would precisely have suited my argument at this\npoint, the reader will probably not demand from me a long account of\nmy reasons for awaiting their further confirmation.\nApart from these doubtful phenomena there seems little reason to\nthink that hysteria, as apart from hypnotisability, exerts a specially\nfavouring effect on telepathic phenomena. Some few hysterics (as the\n\" Madame B.\" of the Havre experiments) who have been very\nconstantly hypnotised, have become excellent subjects, but it is not\nclear that healthy persons, if similarly trained, might not have given\nlike results.\nA converse question is of considerable interest. Even if hysterics\nshow no special aptitude for transmitting ordinary telepathic messages,\ndo healthy telepathic agents show any power of transmitting hysterical\nphenomena? This is in fact the question at the root of sorcery.\nGurney has already shown that such phenomena of witchcraft as have\nany real first-hand evidence to support them are explicable by hysteria,\n\f28 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhypnotic suggestion and self-suggestion. While dealing mainly with the\nmost striking point\u2014the effect of self-suggested hallucinations upon the\n\u2022witch herself,\u2014he remarks also that \" if we bear in mind the prevalent\n,belief that the witch commanded the full powers of the devil, we need\nnot refuse to connect the threats and angry words of unpopular old\nwomen with a certain proportion, at any rate, of the illnesses which are so\nfreely testified to as having soon after supervened.\" 1 We may expand\nthis sentence, perhaps, by saying that the witch induced hypnosis in\nherself and hysteria in her neighbours. There is something indeed in\nthe wasting of the bewitched person\u2014apparently progressive, and then\nsuddenly mending\u2014which strongly suggests the now familiar hysterical\nmalady of \" pseudo-tabes.\"\nLimua ut hie durescit et haec ut cera liquescit\nUno eodemque igni ; sic nostro Daphnis amore.\nCould we better describe the intercurrent spasm and paresis of\nthat phantom affection? the threatened death, yet the rapid disappear\nance under the influence of pleasurable shock 1\nBut the incantations of the Pharmaceutria\u2014unlike the face to face\ncursing of which Gurney speaks\u2014were intended to take effect lele-\npathically . Ts there any evidence for such action ? any evidence, that\nis to say, that there ta,n be a telepathic projection into other minds\nnot only of our harmless pictures of Queens of Hearts or of hippopo\ntami, but of such impulses as may generate in the percipient some of\nthose hysterical symptoms which we know to be generated with such\ndisastrous ease by the unconscious self-suggestion of the hysteric's own\nunstable being ? If this be so, we should have something like an\nexplanation for many tales of mediaeval sorcery and of the so-called\n\" black magic \" about which so much nonsense is still occasionally\nwritten. Nor is there any obvious reason why this should not sometimes\noccur ; why a telepathic impulse should not sometimes be felt by the\npercipient as an obsessing presence, a disintegrating intrusion into a\nsensitive mind. I can only say that we have not as yet met with any well-\nattested case of this type ; and that, on the other hand, we have heard\nvarious statements of telepathic persecution which we felt bound to rank\nas examples of a not uncommon class of insane delusions. It was, there\nfore, with surprise as well as interest that we received some years ago\nfrom Dr. Gibotteau (known to Professor Richet) the record (since\npublished at greater length in the Annalea des Sciences Psychiques) of\ncertain experiments made partly by himself, but chiefly under his\nsupervision, by a woman,\u2014ignorant indeed of most other arts\u2014but\ntrained (as she said) in sorcery by her mother, in a village in Nor\nmandy. This woman was willing to communicate her hereditary artifices,\n1 Pkantatms of the Living, Vol, I,, p. 182.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness.\nwhich turn out to be precisely such as our knowledge of other tele\npathic experiments might have led us to anticipate. I have already\nquoted (Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 466) some of Berthe's doings. I\nadd some accounts, mainly of motor disturbances, akin to those of\nhysteria, and generated, as Dr. Gibotteau believes, by Berthe's tele\npathic action,\u2014although the limits of suggestion and self-suggestion\nare in some cases hard to define.\nM. 57.\u2014\"Passive telepathy,\" says Dr. Gibotteau,1 \" the r6le of percipient,\nwas nota marked feature in Berthe's case ; and it was generally by an exercise\nof will that she arrived at it. I do not remember that she ever became sponta\nneously aware of any action performed by me. More commonly she would\nseek and listen. Sometimes she mentally followed the track of her subject ;\nsometimes she watched a place where she supposed that he must pass ; and\nfrom this ambush, as it were, she seized him as he went by. For example,\nshe had resolved to prevent me from walking up the Boulevard St.\nMichel, towards the Observatory,\u2014a street by which I do not often pass.\nSeldom have I passed that way without feeling her presence, and a resis\ntance which took two quite different forms. Sometimes I felt an un\nusual feebleness in my legs, which seemed paralysed. It was as though I\nhad been carrying on my shoulders a weight too heavy for me. If I turned\nto walk the other way, I felt myself light and free. At other times I had a\ncertain difficulty in moving forwards, as if I had been struggling against a\nstrong wind, or rather against a current of water which reached to my\nmiddle, for the sensation was confined to the legs. I amused myself by\nobserving this effect, which I quite understood to proceed from Berthe. If\nI turned the other way, the opposite effect followed ; the imaginary current\nseemed to drag me towards the Seine, and I had difficulty in preventing\nmyself from running.\n'.'Berthe's other method of influencing me was mentally to explore\na place\u2014my own room, for instance, and thus somehow to discover whether\nI was there. This at last became very tiresome. When I wished that she\nshould leave me alone I deceived her by the following artifice. I took the\nhomeward route in the evening, summoning her strongly, and as soon as she\nmentally replitd I continued my route in imagination, picturing to myself\none point in it after another. I fancied myself entering my house, mounting\nthe staircase, and going to bed and to sleep. Then I suddenly broke contact\nwith her, and continued my real walk in another direction. It will be under\nstood that in the absence of notes I cannot now give precise details, but all\nthese facts stood out clearly enough at the time. I ought to add that she by\nno means always succeeded ; nor did she always tell the truth, being given\nto boast about her powers of this kind. Nevertheless, the kind of surveillance\nwhich I felt hanging over me for the space of two months was, perhaps, the\nmost interesting to me among all Berthe's phenomena.\n\" My friend L. on one and the same evening both imposed upon Berthe,\nand received from her, a sensation of this kind. After a single sitting with her\nhe endeavoured to prevent her from returning home, at about 11 p.m., and\nto make her take a road which led her away from her lodgings into a solitary\n1 Annates, September and October, 1892, p. 259, &c. (abridged).\n\f30 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nquarter. He felt as if he had succeeded in this ; and indeed he had suc\nceeded, as Berthe told us next day that she had been astonished to find\nherself far from her lodging and her right road. But she took her revenge\nat once. L., on leaving me, went after a time to his club, at about midnight.\nHe was there watching the play, when suddenly he felt a foreign influence ;\neverything became distasteful to him ; he only stayed a few minutes, and\nwent home almost at a run. Next morning he told me of this experience,\nand said he was sure that it was Berthe who had made him thus suddenly\nchange his mind. And Berthe afterwards gave me the same account, boast\ning that she had made him change his mind.\n\"Another time Berthe taught me how one ought to proceed in order to\nmake a person fall down. The method is thoroughly logical. First you\nmust get to know him, talk to him, impress him as much as you can, and\nmake him afraid of you. When he is in the street you follow behind him\nand imitate his walk as closely as you can, charging him all the time. (This\nwas the word she used for the process, to her quite familiar, of mentally\npossessing herself of someone's thoughts, and slightly hypnotising him.)\nThen you must see a string stretched across the road a few steps in front of\nhim. You follow the movements of your victim, and then, at the moment\nwhen he reaches the imaginary string, you yourself intentionally stumble,\nand the poor man is forced to tumble down.1\n\" We had,\" he continues, \" been having a stance with Berthe ; and we\nprolonged it in an open carriage, where she sat between P. and myself.\nIt was a summer evening, near midnight, in the Quartier des Invalides.\nBefore entering the carriage I said to Berthe : ' Since you say that you know\nhow to do it, try and make M. P. lose his sense of direction, so that he may\nimagine that he is turning his back on the direction in which he is really\ngoing. Wait to do this until I give you a sign.' At a certain moment I gave\nher the sign ; and after a few moments P. said to me, ' I feel very odd ;\neverything round me seems turning, and I feel sick ; it is just as if I was\nsea-sick.'\n\" Nothing further occurred, so the hallucination remained incomplete. P.\nis entirely ignorant of medicine ; he knows nothing of the sense of direction,\nor of the intimate connection which exists between a disturbance of this\nsense and the special discomforts of which he complained. One could hardly\nhave a better proof of the reality of Berthe's action, or a better commentary\non the power of causing the victim to lose his way, so often attributed to\nsorcerers of every country.\"\nThe production of sleep at a distance is, among the phenomena\nwhich we have already discussed, that which bears the closest\nresemblance to these unholy tricks.\nWhat the exact mechanism of sommeil a distance may be we do not\nknow. We do not know whether all telepathic transmissions are of\nthe same type ; nor whether the typical transmission is to be regarded\nas a physical transmission. On this point M. Gibotteau's experiments\nare of interest :\u2014\n1 Annales, Sept., Oct., 1892, p. 258.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 31\nM. 58.\u2014\" I had been reading the account of the experiments with Mme.\nB. (Leonie) at Havre. I asked Berthe one day, ' Can you manage sleep at a\ndistance 1 ' 'Certainly,' said she, 'it is not difficult ; I have done it often\nwith [an experimenter whose name I forget].' 'Well then, look out, some\ntime to-day I will send you to sleep.' After lunching at the hospital-officers'\nhall I asked a colleague to choose an hour for me at random. The hour\nchosen was, I think, 2.30. When that hour came I walked up and down in\nthe corridor, at least 300 yards from the hall, mentally ordering Berthe to\ngo to sleep, as if I had been close to her. After ten minutes, it seemed to\nme, I cannot say why, that I had succeeded. I walked back to the win\ndow of the creche, where Berthe was, and looked in. She was asleep. I\nentered. They told me that she had been asleep for ten minutes or so. She\nhad lain down, and they had seen her go to sleep. It was her ordinary som\nnambulistic sleep\u2014a sleep into which she sometimes fell spontaneously. I\nrepeated the experiment a great number of times, always choosing an hour\nat random. I almost always succeeded, with occasional failures when she\nwas occupied in talking, or when I lacked patience. I observed that a\nprolonged effort was necessary for success. It did not seem that I merely\nsupplied a signal at which she voluntarily sent herself to sleep ; but rather\nthe sleep itself seemed an effect directly and laboriously produced by my\nwill. I have had the same feeling in sending other subjects to sleep from a\ndistance.\n\"I tried further experiments ; I used to succeed pretty well in making\nBerthe come from the crlche to the hall at my mental order. In these cases\nshe went to sleep first and moved forward totteringly, her eyes ecstatically\nfixed. Unknown to me the head nurse forbade her to enter the hall. She\nthen used to walk into the garden and come up to the window nearest to\nwhere I was at work. I tried to send her to sleep at greater distances ; for\nexample, from my own lodgings in the Rue des Ecdes, &c. The results were\nless good, but still encouraging.\"\nIt is certainly satisfactory that among the very few efforts which,\nso far as we know, have been made to repeat our Havre experiments\none series should have been thus successful. It is to be regretted, how\never, that even an inquirer so active and so fertile in expedients as Dr.\nGibotteau should have neglected that accurate and immediate regis\ntration which experiments of this kind so manifestly need.\nAnd as regards those other and more novel experiments of Dr. Gibot-\nteau's they do certainly seem to afford us sporadic examples of just the\nkind which our series needs. If correctly described, they show telepathic\naffections (1) of the motor system generally, (2) of the centres for\nvertigo and nausea. Our argument needs both. We want to be\nable to point to vague motor affections, from which our more definite\nmotor affections of hand or throat may be developed or specialised.\nAnd we want as many miscellaneous organic effects of telepathy as pos\nsible ;\u2014instances of its action on special sensibilities, on the vaso-motor,\n\f32 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ncirculatory, respiratory systems, Jcc.1 We may well conjecture that\nthe telepathic impact may affect some sensitive internal organs,\u2014\nla vessie, ce miroir de Vdme,\u2014and so forth. We have had at any rate\nsome telepathic cases of deep ccenesthetic disturbance, of a profound\nmalaise which must, one would think, have involved some abnormal\ncondition of the viscera. In Gurney's collection of \" emotional and\nmotor effects\" {Phantasms of the Living, Vol I., Chap. VII.), we find\nsuch phrases as \"a cloud of calamity which was almost a physical\nfeeling,\" \" deep depression,\" \" a dreadful feeling of illness and faint-\nness, and I felt that I was dying,\" \" dreadful trembling with prostra\ntion,\" \" trembling, with no apparent cause whatever,\" \" conviction that\nI should die that night,\" and so forth. And we have, moreover, the\ndefinite vaso-motor phenomenon of sudden weeping, which in one case\n(op. cit., p. 275) is described as \" hysterics \" by a lady who \" never\nexperienced a similar feeling.\" This attack corresponded exactly\nwith the sudden death of a father at a distance. We must hardly\npress her phrase as implying more than a sudden, uncontrollable,\nunmotived fit of weeping, though it would, of course, be specially\ninteresting if we could find definite hysterical symptoms originated by\na telepathic shock. Another informant (p. 277) speaks of an \"extra\nordinary state of depression and restlessness ; a violent fit of weeping,\na thing quite alien to my character,\" as coinciding with the sudden\nillness and delirium of a distant husband.\nAlong with these emotional or vaso-motor cases, Gurney gives some\nnarratives of pervading motor impulse,\u2014\" a sense of being wanted\u2014\nan impulse to go somewhere or do something.\" It is, of course, not easy\nto get a motor impulse quite clear of intellectual impression ; since if\n(for instance) a man feels a strong impulse to go home he probably also\nhas a strong impression that some of his family are ill. In at least one\ncase, however, that of Major Kobbe' ( p. 288), the percipient is\nprompted to visit a distant cemetery, without any conscious reason, and\nthere finds his father ;\u2014who had in fact, for certain quite unexpected\nreasons, sent to his son, Major Kobh>4 a request to meet him there at\nthat hour ; a request which Major Kobbe' had never received.\nI add a case where the object of the motor impulse was perfectly\nwell known, but where, nevertheless, the motor impulse itself is\ndescribed as the vivid and controlling element.\nImpressions from a Distance.

I had engaged to\npreach in New York on Sunday the 3rd, and I was somewhat amazed when\nSaturday's sunset came, and only the word from Sandy Hook, \"no signs yet\nof the Vanderbilt.\" I feared the steamer might come in during the fore\nnoon while I should be detained in the pulpit. Late at night I went several\nmiles up town to my lodging-house, having been officially assured that, late\nas it then was, with no tidings, the steamer could not possibly get in before\n12m. on Sunday. That assurance was perfect in my mind and gave me great\nsatisfaction and I fell asleep.\nAfter a quiet night, I suddenly woke, soon after six a.m., finding myself\nspring out of bed, exclaiming, \" She's in, she's in ! \" It was not a question\nI was discussing. It was fully settled ; there was not a shadow of doubt in\nmy mind ; and I began dressing with all conceivable rapidity to fly to meet\nher. I was alone. Anybody with me would have deemed me as good as\ninsane, so eager and confident was my assurance. I rushed out of the\nhouse, across, some distance, to Broadway, and took the down town omnibus.\nWholly alone, I had time to reflect on the ridiculousness of my conduct.\nMy faith in my impression was somewhat shaken by the long shaking in the\nslow 'bus before we reached the Astor House about 7.30 a.m. I rushed in,\nhowever, asking at the desk, \"Any news of the Vanderbilt?\" \"She's\ncoming up the Bay, sir,\" answered the clerk, and I rushed out with fresh\nspeed, moved quickly over the intervening mile, sped down the long pier,\nand leapt on board just as she drew up to the dock\u2014not pausing an instant\nin my eager movement, and being the first to board her from the pier. A\nmoment later, I stood quietly leaning against the jamb of the upper cabin\ndoor, gazing upon her whom I sought, who sat before me conversing with a\nfriend, not being aware that the steamer had drawn up to the dock, and by\nno means expecting to see anybody she knew so early in the day.\nI consider this a case of immediate agnition, or perception not attained\nby any process of unconscious reasoning during sleep. My active mind had\npreviously scrutinised the facts, weighed all the probabilities, and fully\nsettled the conviction so far as cognition could, that the Vanderbilt, under\nthe then present conditions of weather, &c., could not reach her dock before\n12m. on Sunday.\nThe two following cases, in both of which the same percipient was\nconcerned, come to us through the American Branch of the Society.\nIn the first, the conscious desire of the agent seems to have been the\npredetermining cause of the percipient's impression.\nL. 877. Ae P\" Motor Impulse.\nThe percipient, Mrs. Hadselle, writes to Mr. Hodgson as follows :\u2014\n28, Bradford-street, Pittsfield, Mass., May 28th, 1888.\n\"Less than two years ago a curious thing happened to me. I had been\nD\n\f84 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nin Wash. Co., N.Y., giving half a dozen readings, and was on my way to\nWilliamstown, where I had spent a part of the summer, and where much of my\nworldly goods, in the shape of wearing apparel, was safely stowed in my room\nat the ' Mansion House.' With ticket purchased, I was serenely seated in\nthe car, 'box, bundle and bag' beside me, the conductor's ' All aboard' was\nat that instant in my ears, when I sprang to my feet with the force of an\ninward command, ' Change your ticket and go to Elizabeth (N.J.). Change\nyour ticket and go to Elizabeth. Change your ' Here a gentleman in the\nopposite seat\u2014an utter stranger\u2014rose and said : ' Madam, have you for\ngotten something, can I help you ? ' I said : ' Do you think the train will\nwait for me to change my ticket 1 ' For there appeared to be no alternative.\nAs I spoke I moved towards the platform ; he followed, and seeing that the\noffice was but a few steps distant said : ' Go, I'll see that you are not left. '\nI did go, and in a moment more was on my way to Elizabeth, though I had not\nbefore even thought of such a thing. Next morning, on reaching my friend's\nhouse, she threw her arms about me and sobbed out : ' Oh, I have wanted\nyou so.' Then she led me to a room where an only and beloved sister lay\nin life's last battle. In an hour it was ended.\n\"My poor grief-stricken friend declared then\u2014declares now\u2014that my\nsudden change of purpose was a direct answer to her repeated though\nunspoken demand for my presence. And who shall say it was not ? I wish\nto add that while I had learned by letter of the sister's illness of a chronic\ndisorder, I did not suppose her case hopeless ; indeed, from the fact that no\ntidings had reached me lately, was hoping that she was on the road to\nrecovery, and had I been questioned concerning her that 10th of November,\n1886, should have replied confidently, ' She will without doubt last through\nthe winter.' My friend, by the way, is, much more than I, a believer in\npsychical phenomena.\n\" (Signed) C. A. C. Hadselle.\"\nMr. Hodgson writes :\u2014\n\"Mrs. G.\u2014the friend referred to\u2014has sent me her corroboration, dated\nMarch 5th, 1890. The date of the incident, she states, was November 11th,\n1886. She says :\u2014\n\" ' I had not expected Mrs. H. ; did not at that time know where she\nwas, so could not have summoned her had I wished to do so,\u2014but in my\ntrouble there grew upon me a great desire for her presence, and I said many\ntimes, \" If she would only come.

To this he could\nsafely reply, as I was an old-time contributor to that and other leading\njournals. A local paper lately copied it. Many of the then witnesses have,\nwith Dr. Holland and my darling ' Eddie ' (Kleber Loomis Hadselle), gone\nover to the ' great majority, ' but there are several still living who remember\nthe episode, and no one of my acquaintances doubts or thinks the sketch\noverdrawn.\n\" The account is taken from the Berkshire County Eagle, May 10th, 1888,\nPittsfield, Mass., and is there headed ' The Unspoken Warning\u2014A Mother's\nExperience.' As above implied, the account itself is nearly contemporary\n\u2022with the incident, being here quoted from a reprint, which the author accepts\nas correct :\u2014\n\"One bitter cold day in winter a merry party of us, nestled down under\nfurry robes, went to meet an appointment with a friend living a few miles\ndistant, with whom we were to spend the afternoon and in the evening attend\na concert to be held near by. The sleighing was delightful, the air keen and\ninspiriting, the host and hostess genial as the crackling fires in the grates,\nand the invited guests, of whom there were many besides ourselves, in that\npeculiar visiting trim which only old-time friends, long parted, can enjoy.\nRestraint was thrown aside ; we cracked jokes ; we chattered like magpies,\nand not a little of the coming concert, which promised a rare treat to our\nunsophisticated ears. All went merry as a marriage bell, and merrier than\nsome, till just before tea, when I was seized with a sudden and unaccount\nable desire to go home, accompanied by a dread or fear of something, I knew\nnot what, which made the return appear, not a matter of choice, but a thing\nimperative. I tried to reason it away, to revive anticipations of the concert ;\nI thought of the disappointment it would be to those who came with me to\ngive it up, and running over in my mind the condition in which things were\nleft at home, could find no ground for alarm.\n\"For many years a part of the house had been rented to a trusty family ;\nour children were often rocked in the same cradle, and half of the time ate\nat the same table ; locks and bolts were things unused, and in deed as in\nword we were neighbours. In their care had been left a boy of ten years,\nthe only one of the family remaining at home, who knew that when he\nreturned from school he was expected to bring in wood and kindlings for the\nmorning fire, take supper alone, or with little Clara E., as he chose, and\notherwise pass the time as he pleased, only that he must not go into the street\nto play, or on to the pond to skate. He had been left many times in this\nway, and had never given occasion for the slightest uneasiness ; still, as this\nnameless fear grew upon me, it took the form of a conviction that danger of\nsome sort threatened this beloved child.\nd 2\n\f3G Mi. F. W. H. Myers.\n\"I was rising to go and ask Mr. A. to take me home, when someone said,\n'You are very pale ; are you ill ?' ' No,' I answered, and dropping back\nin the chair, told them how strangely I had been exercised for the last few\nminutes ; adding, ' I really must go home.' There was a perfect chorus of\nvoices against it, and for a little time I was silenced, though not convinced.\nSomeone laid the matter before Mr. A., who replied, \"Nonsense; Eddie is a\ngood boy to mind, will do nothing in our absence that he would not do if we\nwere there, and is enjoying himself well at this moment, I'll warrant.' This,\nanswer was brought to me in triumph, and I resolved to do as they said,\n' not to think about it.' But at tea my trembling hand almost refused to\ncarry food to my lips, and 1 found it utterly impossible to swallow a mouth\nful. A death-like chill crept over me, and I knew that every eye was on me\nas I left the room. Mr. A. rose, saying in a changed voice and without\nceremony, ' Make haste ; bring the horse round, we must go right away.\nI never saw her in such a state before ; there is something in it.' He\nfollowed me to the parlour, but before he could speak I was pleading as for\ndear life that not a moment be lost in starting for home. ' I know,' said I,\n' it is not all imagination, and whether it is or not I shall certainly die, if\nthis dreadful incubus is not removed shortly. '\n\"All was now confusion ; the tea-table deserted, the mealscarco tasted ;\nand my friends, alarmed as much at my looks as at my words, were as anxious\nto hurry me off as they had been before to detain me. To me those terrible\nmoments seemed hours, yet I am assured that not more than half an hour\nelapsed from the time my fears first found expression before we were on the\nroad toward home. A horse somewhat noted for fleetness was before us,,\nand with only two in the cutter\u2014the rest stayed to concert, and made Mr.\nA. promise that if nothing had happened we would return\u2014went over the\nroad at a rapid pace. I know from the frequent repetition of a peculiar\nsignal that the beast was being urged to his best, yet I grew sick witb\nimpatience at the restraint. I wanted to fly. All this while my fears had\ntaken no definite shape. I only knew that the child was in danger, and felt\nimpelled to hurry to the rescue. Only once was the silence broken in that\nthree-mile journey, and that was when the house was in full view. I said,\n' Thank God, the house is not on fire.' ' That was my own thought,' said\nMr. A., but there was no slackening of speed.\n'' On nearing home a cheerful light was glimmering from Mrs. E.'s window ;\nbefore the vehicle had fairly stopped we were clear of it, and opening the\ndoor, said in the same breath, ' Where's Eddie ? ' ' Eddie ? why, he was\nhere a little while ago,' answered Mrs. E., pleasantly striving to dissipate\nthe alarm she saw written on our countenances. ' He ate supper with the\nchildren, and played awhile at marbles ; then spoke of Libby Rose having\na new picture book, and that he wanted to see it. You'll find him over\nthere.' With swift steps Mr. A. crossed the street to the place mentioned,\nbut returned with ' Ho has not been there.' Eddie was remarkably fond of\nskating, and my next thought was that he had been tempted to disobedience.\nI said calmly, ' We will go to the pond.' I was perfectly collected ; I could\nhave worked all night without fatigue with the nerves in that state of ten\nsion ; but Mr. A. said, 'No, you must go in and lie down. Eddie is safe\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 37\nenough, somewhere about the village. I'll go and find him.' But there\nwas nothing in the tone as in the words to reassure me.\n\" As he spoke he crossed the hall to our own room and turned the knob.\nThe door was locked. What could that mean 1 Eddie was either on the\ninside or had taken the key away with him. Mr. A. ran round to a window\nwith a broken spring which could be opened from the outside. It went up\nwith a clang, but a dense volume of smoke drove him back. After an\ninstant another attempt was made, and this time, on a lounge directly under\nthe window, he stumbled on the insensible form of little Eddie, smothered\nin smoke. Limp and apparently lifeless, he was borne into the fresh cold\nair, and after some rough handling was restored to consciousness.\n\"Eddie said, on returning from school, he made a good fire, and as the\nwood was snowy thought he would put it in the oven to dry ; something he\nhad never done before. Then on leaving Mrs. E. 's room he went in for an\napple before going to see Libby Rose's picture book, and it seemed so nice\nand warm he thought he would lie down awhile. He could give no explana\ntion as to what prompted him to turn the key : it was the first and last time ;\nbut this could have made no difference in the result, for no one would have\ndiscovered the smoke in time to save his life. The wood in the oven was\nburned to ashes, but as the doors were closed there was no danger of falling\nembers setting the house on fire ; and had we stayed to the concert every\nthing-would have been as when we left, except that little Eddie's voice would\nnever more have made music for our ears.

In the case next to be cited,\nLady de Vesci described to me in conversation a similar malaise,\ndefining itself into the urgent need of action,\u2014namely, of sending a\ngreeting to the friend then dying at the other side of the world. Such\nan impulse was unique in her experience.\nMay 24th, 1891.\nL. 885.\n\" Madame X. was a very remarkable woman, and I was most deeply\nattached to her. She had had great troubles and difficulties in her life, an\nunhappy marriage, and two sons who were entirely educated by her.\n\f38 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nWhen they came to London as clerks in the City she followed them to make\na home for them there ; but as one was soon sent out to work at Hong-Kong\nand the other to a business at Bahia, she sought employment for herself in\nLondon and came to us as governess in 1864. In 1869 she became ill, and\nspent the winter alone at Bournemouth. She and I wrote constantly to\neach other, and when she moved to Norwood for the summer of 1870 my\neldest brother and I went often to spend long afternoons with her. He died\nthat summer, and although she had not left her sofa for months she came\nat once to see me when she heard of our great sorrow ; the doctor said he\nhad never seen such an indomitable spirit as she showed through her illness,\nand when in the spring of 1871 Sir J. Burrows told her that she had not\nmany months to live she resolved to go out to Hong-Kong and see her\neldest son once more. It was not thought that she would survive the\nvoyage. Our deep love for each other was unchangeable, and this final fare\nwell was a great grief to us both. She reached Hong-Kong and spent the\nlast 18 months of her life with her son there. I heard from her by every mail.\n\"In 1872 I married, and shortly afterwards we were quartered at the\nCurragh. It was from there that I sent the telegram which she received less\nthan 24 hours before her death. Until 2 years ago I had in my possession a\nfew faint lines written by her on blue foreign paper, saying she had received\nmy message and that her ' fever dreams ' were filled with memories of our\nhappy days together at Cannes and elsewhere. Her son is now dead. He\ncame to see me in '76 and told mo that my telegram had made his mother\nvery happy.\n\"The impulse that made me communicate with her on that particular day\nwas a very strong one. It came to me suddenly and not in consequence of any\nincreased anxiety from news received. On the contrary, the accounts were\nquite satisfactory. I had heard from her by the mail a few days before. I\nasked my husband to go with me to the Curragh Post office, as I wished to\nfind out the cost of a telegram to China, and he accompanied me to the Post-\noffice and we were told it would cost \u00a35 to send 12 words or so, I think. I\nat once wrote and sent the message containing a few words of loving greet\ning. These words she received and acknowledged only a few hours before\nher death.

Some can be made\nto see, some to hear, some to act out the conception proposed to them.\nIn a recent paper 1 Dr. Btrillon has even shown that certain subjects\nwho seem at first quite refractory to hypnotisation are nevertheless at\nonce obedient, even in the waking state, to a motor suggestion.\nThis was the case both with a very strong man, with weak men and\n1 Revue de VMypnotiame, March, 1893, p. 2G8.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness.\nwomen, and with at least one subject actually suffering from loco\nmotor ataxy. It would seem, then, that sometimes a loss of motor\ncontrol may predispose to motor suggestibility. On the other hand,\na specially well-developed motor control may predispose in a similar\nway ;\u2014as for instance, the subject who can sing already is more easily\nmade to sing by suggestion. We must, then, await further observa\ntions before we can pretend to say beforehand with which autom-\natist the messages will take a sensory, and with which a motor form.\nStill less can we explain the special predisposition of each experi\nmenter to one or more of the common kinds of motor automatism,\n\u2014as automatic speech, automatic writing, table movements, raps, and\nso forth. These forms of message may themselves be variously com\nbined ; and the contents of a message of any one of these kinds may\nbe purely dream-like and fantastic, or may be veridical in various\nways.\nLet us enumerate the modes of subliminal motor message as nearly\nas we can in order of their increasing specialisation.\n1. We may place first the massive motor impulses (like Major\nKobbe's) of which mention has already been made, and which mark a\nkind of transition between coenesthetic affections and motor impulses\nproper. There was here no impulse to special movement of any limb ;\nbut an impulse to reach a certain place by ordinary methods.\n2. Next, perhaps, in order of specialisation come the simple sub\nliminal muscular impulses which give rise to table-tilting and similar\nphenomena.\n3. Musical execution, subliminally initiated, might theoretically be\nplaced next ; although definite evidence of this is hard to obtain,\nsince the threshold of consciousness with musical performers is\nnotoriously apt to be shifting and indefinite. (\"When in doubt, play\nwith your fingers, and not with your head.\")1\n4. Next we may place automatic drawing and painting. This\ncurious group of messages has but seldom a telepathic content, and\nmay be better considered hereafter in connection with other non-\ntelepathic forms of subliminal faculty.\n5. Next comes automatic writing, on which much has been said in\nprevious papers, and much remains to be said here.\n6. Automatic speech, which would not seem to be per se a more\ndeveloped form of motor message than automatic script, is often\naccompanied by profound changes of memory or of personality which\nraise the question of \" inspiration \" or \" possession \" ;\u2014for the two\nwords, however different their theological import, mean much the same\n1 The often-cited case of \"Blind Tom\" (a semi-idiotic negro of extraordinary\nmusical gift) will be better dealt with later in connection with the phenomena of\ntrance.\n\f40 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nthing from the standpoint of experimental psychology. Much has been\nsaid on this subject in connection with Mrs. Piper's trances ; and since\nthose trances still continue it is hoped that the topic may be dealt\nwith again before long.\n7. I must conclude my list with a class of motor phenomena which\nI shall in this present paper merely record in passing, without attempt\ning any explanation. I allude to raps, and to those telekinetic move\nments of objects whose real existence is still matter of controversy.\nComparing this list of motor automatisms with the sensory\nautomatisms enumerated in Chap. V., we shall find a certain general\ntendency running through each alike. The sensory automatisms began\nwith vague unspecialised sensations. They then passed through a phase\nof definition, of specialisation on the lines of the known senses. And\nfinally they reached a stage beyond these habitual forms of\nspecialisation :\u2014beyond them, as of wider reach, and including in an\napparently unanalysable act of perception a completer truth than any\nof our specialised forms of perception could by itself convey. With\nmotor messages, too, we begin with something of similar vagueness.\nThey, too, develop from modifications of the percipient's general organic\ncondition, or ccenesthesia ; and the first dim telepathic sense apparently\nhesitates between several channels of expression. They then pass\nthrough various definitely specialised forms ; and finally, as we shall see\nwhen automatic script is considered, they, too, merge into an unan\nalysable act of cognition in which the motor element of the message\nhas disappeared.\nBut these motor messages point also in two other even more perplex\ning directions. They lead, as I have said above, towards the old idea\nof possession;\u2014using the word no longer in an unfavourable sense,\nbut simply as an expression for some form of temporary manifestation\nof two veritably distinct and alien personalities through the self-same\nphysical organism. And they appear to lead also to another class of\nphenomena in which (just as in \" possession\" ) the influence at work,\ninstead of becoming more and more identified with the automatist's\nconscious thought, appears to become more and more markedly dis\ntinguished from it. I allude to telekinesis, or hyperboulia, or whatever\nname we may decide to give to effects apparently exercised in the\nautomatist's presence, but not through his normal agency, upon the\nphysical world.\nThese two last named topics, so-called \" possession,\" and so-called\n\" telekinetic phenomena,\" although unavoidably mentioned here, must\nbe reserved for fuller description in a subsequent chapter. It will be\nenough for the present to consider motor messages as running parallel\nto sensory messages ;\u2014as covering much the same ground, and pre\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 41\nsenting the old problems as to their source and initiation in an in\nstructively different light.\nI will, then, briefly recount what seem to be the conceivable\norigins of written and other messages,\u2014which messages, be it said,\nusually profess, with more or less insistence, to come from some de\nparted spirit. Such assertion is no proof ; and judging by their\ndefinite contents alone, we may arrange the messages in the following\nclasses.\nA. In the first place, the message may come from the percipient's\nown mind ; its contents being supplied from the resources of his\nordinary memory, or of his more extensive subliminal memory ; while\nthe dramatisation of the message,\u2014its assumption of some other mind\nas its source,\u2014-will resemble the dramatisations of dream or of hypnotic\ntrance.\nOf course the absence of facts unknown to the writer is not in\nitself a proof that the message does not come from some other mind.\nWe cannot be sure that other minds, if they can communicate, will be\nat the pains to fill their messages with evidential facts. But, equally\nof course, a message devoid of such facts must not, on the strength of\nits mere assertions, be claimed as the product of any but the writer's\nown mind.\nB. Next above the motor messages whose content the automatist's\nown mental resources might supply, we may place the messages whose\ncontent seems to be derived telepathically from the mind of some other\nperson still living on earth ; that person being either conscious or\nunconscious of transmitting the suggestion.\nG. Next comes the possibility that the message may emanate\nfrom some unembodied intelligence of unknown type,\u2014other, at any\nrate, than the intelligence of the alleged agent. Under this heading\ncome the views which ascribe the messages on the one hand to\n\" elementaries,\" or even devils, and on the other hand to \"guides \"\nor \" guardians \" of superhuman goodness and wisdom.\nD. Finally we have the possibility that the message may be derived,\nin a more or less direct manner, from the mind of the agent,\u2014the\ndeparted friend,\u2014from whom the communication does actually claim\nto come.\nLet us consider each of these possibilities in turn.\nA. My main effort has naturally been thus far directed to the\nproof that there are messages which do not fall into this lowest class,\n\u2014in which class most psychologists would still place them all. And I\nmyself,\u2014while reserving a certain small portion of the messages for\nmy other classes,\u2014do not only admit but assert that the great major\nity of such communications represent the subliminal workings of the\nautomatist's mind alone. It does not, however, follow that such\n\f42 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmessages have for us no interest or novelty. On the contrary, they\nform an instructive, an indispensable transition from psychological\nintrospection of the old-fashioned kind to the bolder methods on\nwhose validity I am anxious to insist. The mind's subliminal action,\nas thus revealed, differs from the supraliminal in ways which no one\nanticipated, and which no one can explain. There seem to be\nsubliminal tendencies setting steadily in certain obscure directions,\nand bearing as little relation to the individual characteristics of the\nperson to the deeps of whose being we have somehow penetrated as\nprofound ocean-currents bear to waves and winds on the surface of the\nsea.1\nIs this indeed the drift of the Zeitgeist, as Professor James\nsuggests, steady beneath the tossings and tumblings of individual man ?\nOr is it something independent of age or season? Is there some\npattern in the very fabric of our nature which begins to show when\never we scratch the glaze off the stuff?\nAll this may be better considered hereafter, apart from the\nevidential discussions with which this chapter must be mainly\nconcerned.\nAnother point also, of fundamental importance, connected with the\npowers of the subliminal self, will be better deferred until a later chapter.\nI have said that a message containing only facts normally known to\nthe automatist must not, on the strength of its mere assertions, be\nregarded as proceeding from any mind but his own. This seems\nevident ; but the converse proposition is not equally indisputable.\nWe must not take for granted that a message which does contain facts\nnot normally known to the automatist must therefore come from some\nmind other than his own. If the subliminal self can acquire super\nnormal knowledge at all, it may obtain such knowledge by means other\nthan telepathic impressions from other minds. It may assimilate its\nsupernormal nutriment also by a directer process,\u2014it may devour it\nnot only cooked but raw. Parallel with the possibilities of reception of\nsuch knowledge from the influence of other embodied or disembodied\nminds lies the possibility of its own clairvoyant perception, or active\n1 See James's Psychology, Vol. I., p. 394: \"One curious thing about trance\nutterances is their generic similarity in different individuals. ... It seems\nexactly as if one author composed more than half of the trance messages, no matter by\nwhom they were uttered. Whether all sub-conscious selves are peculiarly susceptible\nto a certain Btratum of the Zeitgeist, and get their inspiration from it, I know not.\"\nSee the account of automatic and impressional script, by Mr. Sidney Dean, which\nProfessor James goes on to quote, and which is closely parallel to (for instance)\nMiss A.'\u00bb case, to be given below, although the one series of messages comes from\nthe hand of a late member of Congress, \"all his life a robust and active journalist,\nauthor, and man of affairs,\" and the other from a young lady with so different a\nhistory and entourage.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 43\nabsorption of some kind, of facts lying indefinitely beyond its supra\nliminal purview. This possibility must be kept in sight throughout ;\nbut our easiest plan will be to defer its discussion until we have, in this\nchapter, reviewed the evidence so far as it makes for the influence of\ndifferent orders of mind external to the automatist.\nB. We may proceed, therefore, to those motor messages which seem\nto indicate the telepathic influence upon the automatist of other still\nembodied minds. Messages of this kind have been dealt with at\nvarious stages of our past work. The transferences of diagrams of\nwhich we have from time to time given examples sometimes contained a\nmotor as well as a visual element;\u2014the percipient feeling an impulse to\ndraw, as well as discerning a \"mind's eye\" sketch of the diagram onwhich\nthe agent was gazing. Again, a case, contributed by Dr. Liebeault,where\nautomatic writing announces the death of a distant person, is regarded\nby Gurney as a motor message transmitted in the last moments of the\ndecedent's earth-life.1 But our leading instance of this kind is\nundoubtedly the long series of communications between the Rev. P. H.\nand Mrs. Newnham, which we have already cited at so mueh length\nthat I need not repeat them here.2 These experiments, which date\nback to 1871 and whose contemporaneous written record is preserved\nin the archives of the S.P.R., must, I think, always retain their\nprimacy as early and trustworthy examples of a telepathic transference\nwhere the percipient's automatic script answers questions penned by\nthe agent in such a position that the percipient could not in any\nnormal manner discern what those questions were. No part of our\nevidence seems to me more worthy of study than this.\nIn the Newnham case we have the advantage of seeing before us the\nentire series of questions and answers, and thus of satisfying ourselves\nthat the misses (which in that case are very few) are marked as well\nas the hits, and consequently that the coincidences between question\nand answer are at any rate not the result of chance. In several other\ncases which I have known, where the good faith of the informants has\nbeen equally above question, the possibility of an explanation by chance\nalone has been a more important element in the problem. All our evi\ndence has tended to show that the telepathic power itself is a variable\nthing ; that it shows itself in flashes, for the most part spontaneously, and\nseldom persists through a series of deliberate experiments. And if an\nautomatist possessing power of this uncertain kind has exercised it at\nirregular moments and with no scientific aim ;\u2014and has kept, more\nover, no steady record of success and failure ;\u2014then it becomes difficult\nto say that even some brilliant coincidences afford cogent proof of\n1 Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 293.\n* Phantasms of the Living, Vol. I., p. 63; Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. III., p. 8.\n\f44> Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ntelepathic action. The case which I am about to cite presents these\ndrawbacks ; but it presents also positive points of interest and\ncorroborations of memory quite sufficient, I think, to justify me in\nlaying it before my readers as an example of telepathy acting\u2014not just\nin the way in which we should like it to act, but in the way in which\nit apparently does act ;\u2014and with that strange intercurrence, moreover,\nwhich we so often find of something like clairvoyance and premonition\nmingling with the reflection of thoughts which pass through minds in\nrapport with the automatist's.\nThe following account, dated Thornes House, Wakefield, January\n30th, 1893, is signed by Lady Mabel Howard ; her husband, Mr.\nHenry Howard, of Greystoke Castle, Westmoreland, attesting the\nfacts which lie within his cognisance.

I began to write automatically every now and then when a young girl,\nas some relations of mine were in the habit of doing so. I do not, however,\nremember any of the messages until I was eighteen, when one day a girl\nfriend asked me as a joke, ' Who wished to marry her ? ' My pencil wrote\ntwo initials which had no meaning for me. The girl was very angry, as\nthough the writing implied that she was fated to marry this man. She told\nme nothing ; hut some years afterwards a man with these initials told me\nthat he had wished to marry this lady at just that time.\" [The transference\nof an idea latent in the agent's mind\u2014to the exclusion of the idea which he\nitrishcs to have transferred\u2014is, of course, a frequent phenomenon in these\nexperiments.]\n\"2. Some time after my marriage (1885) there was a burglary at Netherby\nHall, in Cumberland, a few valuable jewels being stolen. The robbers\nwere caught three or four days later, but the jewels were not found. Next\nSunday [apparently November 1st, 1885, see below], I was asked by some\nfriends to write where the jewels were. I wrote, ' In the river, under\nthe bridge at Tebay.' This was very unlikely, and had never been sug\ngested, so far as I know, by anyone. Everyone laughed at this ; but\nthe jewels were found there.\" [The Hon. Mrs. C. J. Cropper, of Tolson\nHall, Kendal, corroborates as follows, in February, 1893: \"We were\nstaying at Greystoke just after the capture of the Netherby burglars, and\nsome questions about the burglary were answered by Lady Mabel's pencil.\nI am absolutely certain that in answer to the question ' Where are the\njewels ? ' the pencil wrote ' In the river.' I think that in answer to a further\nquestion it added 'Under the bridge,' but I am not so certain of this. I\nam perfectly certain that it went on to say that the fourth man, who never\nwas caught, was then ' in Carlisle ' and that it also gave his name. (The\nfourth man was some time after suspected to have been a local man.\u2014M. H.)\nMy husband, who was also present, is quite sure about the words ' under\nthe bridge.'\u2014Edith E. Cropper.\"]\n[From the Carlisle Express and Esximiner, October 31st, 1885, it appears\nthat two of the burglars were captured at Tebay Station. The guard saw them\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 45\nconceal themselves in a truck, and telegraphed in advance for assistance.\nThe third man escaped, but seems to have crept back to the train, for he was\nsubsequently caught at Lancaster, as he was quickly making for a London\ntrain. It was not in the least known where the jewels were (a fourth man\nhaving got away), and the finding of the first jewel near Tebay Station, close\nto the water side (reported in same paper November 7th), was accidental.\nThis discovery, of course, caused search to be made in the river, where the\njewels were found \"near the railway bridge,\" more than a month later. (Same\npaper, December 19th.) There can, I think, be no doubt that the writing\nwas on November 1st. Lady Mabel Howard, writing from Lyulph's Tower,\nPenrith, May 5th, 1893, is quite certain of this : \" It was immediately after\nthe men were caught, and before any jewel at all was found. This all will\nassert\u2014the Bullers, Croppers, my brother and husband\u2014for all five of us\nwere local people, and looking out for every fresh detail about it, and only\nthe capture had taken place when the pencil wrote.\"]\n\"3. On the same night I wrote that my sister would be engaged to be\nmarried in September, 1887. At the end of September, 1887, she became\nengaged to a gentleman of whom there had been no idea at the time.\" [It\nis, of course, conceivable that the prediction, known to this lady, may have\ninfluenced the date of the event.]\n\"4. At nearly the same date some connections of mine who had let a house,\nthe lease of which was expiring, were expecting to hear whether any damage\nhad been done, but did not speak of any particular possibility. I wrote\nthat nothing was injured except a particular table in a particular spot.\nNext day they heard that this particular table, and this alone, had been\ninjured.\n[Miss Buller corroborates and expands this statement as follows :\u2014\n\"36, Green-street, Park-lane, W., April 26th, 1893.\n'' The following incident happened when I was staying at Greystoke more\nthan a dozen years ago [discrepancy as to date], but I have often told the\nstory since, and to the best of my recollection the facts were these :\u2014\n'' On being asked what damage our tenants had done,Lady Mabel Howard'*\npencil replied: 'They have broken the table and a chair,' and added,\n' the table has been mended. ' On reaching our house and asking the same\nquestion of our housemaid, she replied that a table in the drawing-room (the\nonly one of its kind) had been broken, but had been mended, and one of the\nkitchen chairs had been broken.

For\nsome reason or other the answers were particularly good there. One day, a\nlady living in quite a different part of the huge hotel, and on the fourth\nfloor, while we were on the first floor, missed a valuable object which she\nhad bought as a prize for tobogganing. I knew nothing of the circumstances,\nbut my hand wrote that the object had been taken by a light-haired young\nwaiter called Richard. I knew of no such waiter, as he had nothing to do\nwith our part of the hotel. But on mentioning this answer to the lady in\nquestion she said that there was in fact a young light-haired waiter called\nRichard who waited on her floor ; and that she had suspected him. My\n\f4G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhand had written where the object was hidden ; but the lady would not have\nsearch made.\n\"6. A Mr. Huth, who was staying at our hotel, was leaving the next day\nfor Paris, and had arranged to dine the day after with a friend, a young doctor\nattached to the Embassy in Paris, from whom he had just received an invi\ntation. He asked me to predict something about his journey. My hand\nwrote words to this effect : ' You will have an accident on your journey ;\nand you will not see your friend, and you cannot see him. ' He derided this,\nas the arrangement with the friend had just been made. As he went to Chur\nnext day by sleigh his sleigh was overturned, and his journey was thus\ndelayed for a day. When he got to Paris he found that his friend was dead.'*\nMr. Huth independently corroborates and adds to this account as\nfollows :\u2014\nOakfield Lodge, Huddersfield, April 16th, 1893.\n\"In March, 1889, I was staying at St. Moritz (Engadine), where I met\nwith a very serious accident tobogganing. Although still crippled I decided to\nreturn home, and on the morning of my departure the weather was brilliantly\nfine. I asked Lady Mabel Howard's pencil, more in joke than anything else,\nwhat sort of a journey I should have. The pencil promptly replied that I\nshould have an awful journey and meet with an accident. I then asked\nwhether I should meet and dine with any friend in Paris. I asked this\nquestion because I had arranged to dine with a friend of mine, a Dr. Davies,\nwho was living there, to talk over some theatricals he was to get up at the\nBritish Embassy. The pencil at once replied that I should neither meet nor\ndine with anyone I knew. Knowing of my arrangement and incredulous as\nto this reply, I repeated my question, with the same result. I then asked\nwhat day I should get back to England, having decided in my own mind to\nreturn on the Friday. The pencil at once answered ' On Thursday. '\n\"On the summit of the Julier Pass the weather suddenly changed from\nbright sunshine to a perfect hurricane of wind, snow and sleet, which com\npletely blinded us, and the snow was so thick we could not see ten yards in\nfront of us. Our driver missed the track, the sleigh upset, and we were all\nthrown out on to the snow,and it was three hours before we were in compara\ntive safety. On my arrival in Paris I found no word from my friend Dr.Davies\nand on inquiry at his rooms I learnt that he had died from typhoid fever ten\ndays previously. I neither dined with nor met anyone I knew whilst in Paris,\nand I returned to England a day sooner than I had intended in consequence\nof my friend's death, and it was only upon my arrival in London that I\nremembered it was Thursday, the day foretold by the pencil.\n\" Harry Huth.\"\n\"7. In 1888 another girl friend of mine asked when she was to be engaged\nto be married. My hand wrote : 'In March, 1890.' She became engaged\nin that month to a man of whom there had been no idea at the time. [The\nlady in question, Mrs. Lawson, writing from Greystoke Castle, February,\n1893, confirms and enlarges this statement as follows : \"I was at Greystoke\nin February, 1888, and Lady Mabel Howard was writing with her pencil,\nwhich said that I should be engaged to be married in March, 1890, and it also\nsaid that I should not be married until the following year.

I have never tried experiments in thought-transference, such as those\nrecorded in the S.P.R. Proceedings. But I have no doubt that words and\nideas do pass without speech from my husband's mind into mine. I have\nspecially remarked this apropos of bye-elections, when I feel certain that\nI have never consciously known the names of the candidates. Many times\nmy hand has written those names (when known to him) truly, and some\ntimes it has predicted results of elections with an accuracy which seemed to\nboth of us not to be the result of chance. In one case, where a gentleman\nnamed Nanney was standing, of whom I was quite sure that I had never\nheard, my hand kept writing ' Goat, Goat.

Names which have\n\"been printed in newspapers which have been lying about must be taken as\nhaving possibly fallen within the field of at least unconscious vision. The\nemergence of an unconsciously observed name Nanney in the grotesque\nform Goat would thus be parallel to the emergence of the unconsciously\nobserved word Bouillon in the grotesque form Verbascum Thapsus, mentioned\nin Proceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 455.]\n9. Writing later, from P Park, April 18th, 1893, Lady Mabel adds :\n\" The H. girls asked what entertainment they should go to directly on\narriving in London. The pencil answered, 'Lady C This puzzled us\nall, as no one knew of an entertainment to be given next week. At last,\nas it continued writing 'Lady C.,' we gave it up, thinking it must mean\ndining at home, Lady C. meaning [their mother]. That very evening, 8\nhours after, a letter arrived from [Lady W. G.] saying Lady Carrington\nwished to know if the H.'s could dance the minuet at her house on the 27th.\nThey will arrive in London on the 25th.\" [From a later letter it appears\nthat the Ladies H. knew that this engagement impended, but believed that\nit would be much later in the season, \" and were much surprised themselves\nat receiving the letter.\"]\n10. I have myself [F.W.H.M.] succeeded in getting two correct answers\nto questions absolutely beyond Lady Mabel's knowledge. I was asked to\nluncheon at the house of a gentleman whom I knew only by correspondence,\nand of whose home and entourage the rest of the party knew absolutely\nnothing. On my return I asked, \" How many people sat down to luncheon 1 \"\nThe answer was \" Six,\" which was right. \" What was the name of the gentle\nman, not my host, with whom I sat and talked after luncheon 1 \" The pencil\nwrote MO, and then began to scrawl. The name was Moultrie. It was impos\nsible that Lady Mabel should have had any kind of notion that a gentleman of\nthat name would have been present in a group of which she knew nothing\nwhatever. But here the impulse to write seemed spent, and a few\nfurther questions were answered by erroneous words or mere scrawls.\n11. The following statement, dated Downes, Crediton, Devonshire,\n\f48 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nApril 8th, 1893, is signed by Sir Redvers Buller, K.C.B., and by Miss-\nDorothy Howard (daughter of Lady Audrey Buller). \"Lady Mabel Howard\nwas stopping with us this week. She was writing with her pencil just after\narriving. Someone asked : '.Where is Don 1 ' The pencil immediately\nanswered, 'He is dead.' Lady Mabel then asked who Don was, and was\ntold that he was a dog. No one in the room knew that he was dead ; but\non inquiry the next day, it was found that it was so. One of the party then\nasked how many fish would be caught in the river the next day. The pencil\nat once wrote three, which was the number obtained the next day.\n\" A little girl in the house, who attends a school in London, asked who was\nher greatest friend at this school. The pencil answered Mary, which was\nagain a fact absolutely unknown to Lady Mabel.\n\"Dorothy E. Howard.\n\"Redvers Buller.\"]\nI defer for the present any discussion of the elements of clair\nvoyance and precognition which these incidents apparently contain. I\nquote the case as one where thought-transference from the living seems\nto play at least a considerable part in supplying the contents of the\nmessages.\nI pass on to two cases where an actual conversation goes on\nbetween the distant agent and the automatist, informing the automatist\nof matters which the agent\u2014consciously or unconsciously\u2014wishes him\nto know. The first of these cases was printed in the S.P.R.\nJournal for July, 1888, but is now published for the first time.\nEvidentially it is not strong, for it depends upon a single memory,\ncorroborated on one collateral point alone (although not invalidated\nupon any point) ; and the writer was not personally known to any of\nus. The date is also very remote. On the other hand the reasons for\nthe absence of corroboration seem satisfactory ; and in my view at least\nthe narrative offers internal evidence of honesty and care, while the\nincident is such as might stamp itself permanently on the mind.\n' Mrs. Kirby wrote to me from Santa Cruz, California, August 13th,\n1886, as follows :\u2014\nM. Aut. 60.\n' ' In 1850 I left New York for San Francisco. Spiritualism, in the sense\nin which that word is now used, had no existence. The facts and philosophy\nit covers were unknown, except partially to the very few readers of Sweden-\nborg's cumbrous and involved theology.\n\"Attention had been called to some rappings which had made themselves\nheard in a house in Rochester, N. Y., and there had been some violent\ndemonstrations (breaking of windows, moving of furniture, and unlocking:\nof locked drawers and doors) in the house of an orthodox clergyman some\nwhere in Connecticut.\n\" In 1853 I was living on a ranche three miles from what is now the city\nof Santa Cruz. (It was but a village then, though they called it a town.)\nMy family consisted of my husband, myself, and in a certain sense, of a\nyoung English sailor, a healthy, kind-hearted, and very decent, though very\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 49\nignorant fellow, whom my husband had employed to work on the ranche\nduring the previous year. His name was Thomas Travers, and he had just\nmade his mark ( x ) to a written agreement for another year's service. As it\nwill be seen, I had no servant, but Tom stood ready to help me in any way\nhe could. For instance, when, at intervals of weeks, visitors would make\ntheir appearance, he would immediately kill and clean some chickens for me.\n(If you wanted beef-steak in those days you could only have it by killing an\nox. The nearest neighbours sometimes combined and took a quarter each.)\n\" On one occasion the two most intelligent men in town came out, a Dr.\nMcLean and the Rev. \u2014 Dryden, and they presently asked me if I had a\nsmall table I could let them have (while I was busy, and my husband a mile\noffat his tannery), with which they could continue some strange experiments\nthat had lately been made among our mutual friends in town. Spirits tipped\nthe table, and they said sentences were spolled by the use of the alphabet.\nThe A's and B's had in this way heard of their long since departed\nchildren, &c., &c.\n\" I listened eagerly. I had left a large circle of friends at the East, and\nhere was not one of the old kind : Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone, Garrison,\nPurvis. A view of the entire bay of Monterey from my sitting-room window\ndid not prevent me from longing continually for a little of the old sympathy.\nOne of my most devoted friends had a few years since passed to the\nother shore ; my young brother was there too. If I could establish commu\nnication with them what a relief, what a pleasure it would be to me !\n\" My smallest table was in size 3|ft. by ljft. My husband was willing to\ntest the matter, and as we were given to understand that three or four\npersons together would be more likely to succeed than two (since magnetism\nor electricity was drawn from them by the invisibles to help in accomplishing\ntheir object), Mr. K. went out to Tom's shanty and asked him to come and\nsit at the table with us.\n\" We had not held our hands one moment on the table before it tipped very\ndecidedly, and I forthwith proceeded to repeat the alphabet. The doing so,\nhowever, struck me as worse than ridiculous ; it was very unpleasant, too,\nand I observed that if spirits were present they could hear me say the letters\nin my mind as well as if they were uttered from my tongue.\n\" ' All right. Go ahead ! ' my husband replied, ' we will sit and wait\nfor results.'\n\"I did so, and the table tipped promptly to the letters, spelling out\u2014\n\" 'Mary Howells.'\n\" As \/ knew no such person, I asked if she was a friend of Mr. K.'s?\nAnswer: 'No.' Of Tom's? Answer: 'Yes.' A relation of his? Answer:\n'Sister.' Are you married ? I questioned. Answer: 'No.'\n\" ' Oh, don't let us waste any more time !' I exclaimed. 'It's all false\nhood and nonsense. Here is someone professing to be Tom's sister who\nsays her name is Mary Howells, and that she is unmarried. If this wore true\nof course her name would be Travers.'\n\" Tom nodded aside to me and said in a low tone\u2014\n\"'Yes, mum. That's her name. Mary Howells.'\n\"He looked extremely confused and astonished.\n\" ' Why, what do you mean ? ' Mr. K. broke in ; ' your name is Travers,,\nhow can hers be Howells ? '\nI\n\f50 Mr. F. W. H. Myera.\n\" ' No, sir,' Tom replied, looking down, ' my name is Howells.'\n\"But Mr. K. insisted that it could not be. Had he not made his mark\n, after the Travers only the other day ? Five minutes were taken up in the\nattempt to convince Tom that he did not know his own name.\n\" ' You see, sir,' he at length explained, ' I ran away from a whale ship\nin San Francisco, and sailors is so scarce there I was afraid they would hunt\nme up and take me back, so I just took another name.'\n\" Hardly convinced now, Mr. K. advised him to drop the alias at once,\nassuring him that no one would molest him. This he did, and the second\nyear following married, and he is now the father of 12 girls and three boys\nwho bear the strangely discovered name.\n\" But to return. Finding that the communication had been so far correct\nI proposed that we should compose ourselves while I repeated the alphabet\nas before, still hoping to receive the name of my dear friend. But Tom's\nsister had not accomplished her purpose, and she proceeded to spell the\nfollowing words :\u2014 ^T^t~MC^^\nfingers of one hand by those of the other, looked up and observed :\u2014\n\"'Yes, mum, that's so. She's seven now.'\n\" When I gave him the rest of the message he became much excited, and\nbegged me to assure his sister that he would send home 50dol. the next\nmonth, and have the child removed to a better place, and that as soon as the\ncrops were in he would go home and get the child.\n\" I assured him she could hear all he was saying.\n\" ' But is it true that there is a street called Cat-street ? ' I asked.\n\" ' Yes, mum ; and it is the worst in the city,' he returned.\n\" The following day he acknowledged to me that his sister was a woman\nof the town.\n'' I now asked my husband to procure me a smaller and lighter table so that\nI might sit at it by myself and in that way be more likely to attract my own\nfriends. This he did, but to my great annoyance, Mary Howells imme\ndiately presented herself. This time, however, she came to say that her\nchild was ill. When she left the movements of the table were weak and\nuncertain.\n\" The following evening, she came to say that the child was much worse,\nand she thought it would die. A day or two later she reported it dead. I\nasked if the child were now with her, and she replied by very decided move\nments, that she uxu iwt.\n\" After this, Mary Howells never put in an appearance, and every day I\nprayed that someone I loved might speak.a word to me. They did not. I\nknow now that they could not, for want of the honest sailor's electrical help,\nwhich I rejected in my ignorance.

In due\ntime I received a reply, or, I should say, Tom did, though he could not read\nwriting. They said they were all well except Mary's little girl, who had\ndied. (They did not say exactly when, hut as Tom had not been absent\nfrom England much over a year, it must have been within that time, and we\nhad every reason to believe the mother's statement a true one.) The old\npeople further said that Mary had married a soldier.\n\" I understood from this that the child's mother was not wholly depraved,\nthat she was concerned about the welfare of her little one, and looking about\nfor help in her destitute circumstances her thoughts had turned to her\nbrother, most likely persistently turned to him, and this resulted in her\nleaving her body temporarily during sleep in search of him. We had assumed\nthat she was, as we say, ' dead.' She had not asserted the fact.\n\" I submit this one experience and will write out another as soon as I\ncan.\u2014Very truly yours, .' , \" \" Georgiana B. Kirby.\"\nA second letter from Mrs. Kirby, dated Santa Cruz., Cal., October 12th,\n1886, gave further particulars, as follows :\u2014 '., ,\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014Yours of September 9th arrived in due season. My reply\nhas been delayed by my ineffectual efforts to ascertain the month when our\ntwo friends, McLean and Dryden, visited us on the ranche, because it was\nwithin a month after this that Mary\" Hbwells told me her child was ill, and\nlater that she was dead, and I thought it might not be so difficult to search\nthe death record of one month for the child under the head of ' Howells. '\nAs it is the gentlemen have proved to me that their visit occurred in 1852,\nand not in 1853 as I had supposed, but they could not remember if it were\nthe spring or fall of that year. This, our ignorance of the date of the death\nand of the child's Christian name, is the most unsatisfactory part of my\nrecord. Neither were mentioned in the grandfather's letter, and from Tom\nnever mentioning the name I fancied he did not know it. I saw him\nrecently, but I could not venture to speak to him of his sister's illegitimate\nchild. He has 12 living daughters of his own, and he would be justly\noffended if I should remind him of how we had gained a knowledge of his\nsister's life. He told us that his father was still alive and living where they\nalways had lived, at Saltash, which he thought by this time must be a\npart of Plymouth.\n\" I should explain that neither Dr. McLean nor the Rev. \u2014 Dryden were\npersonally cognisant of our doings, so that they could not act as witnesses in\nthe case.\n\"You ask if I can point you to any contemporary record. Thirty-four\nyears ago no Spiritualistic paper was published in the United States, and such\na narration given as true in any ordinary journal would have laid us open to\nthe charge of lunacy. And had this been otherwise, we could not have\nproclaimed the fact that the sister of the honest fellow who was working for\nus was a disreputable woman.\n\" As to fraud on Tom's part, he could hardly understand why we wanted\nhim to sit with his hands on the table. I repeated the letters in my mind.\nHow could he tip the table at the right instant so as to spell words which\ndisclosed his sister's disgrace ? Then he was in no want of money. He had\nE 2\n\f52 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nbeen earning 60dol. a month (and had spent it all, mostly at Spanisht\nfandangos), and the agreement with my husband, to which he had lately-\nplaced his X, bound him to work for Mr. K. for one year for the sum of\n60dol. a month and his board and lodging. You, sir, must have read some\nthing about the high price of labour in California in those early years of its\nsettlement.\n\" The sittings were held after supper (or dinner, you would call it), be\ntween seven and nine o'clock.\n\" Cat-street was in Plymouth, England. If it has given place to another\nthe fact of its former existence could be verified.\u2014Georgiana B. Kirby.\"\nThe actual existence of the \"Cat-street\" of the narrative is shown by\nthe following letter :\u2014\nPost Office, Plymouth, January 23rd, 1888.\n\" Sir,\u2014In reply to yours of the 21st instant I beg to inform you that a\nfew years ago there was a street named Catte-street, but it is now called\nStillman-street.\u2014I am, sir, yours obediently,\n\"R. A. Levbrton (for Postmaster).\"\nThe regretted death of Mrs. Kirby soon after the date of her last letter\nput an end to this correspondence.\nIt will bo observed that the communications from the woman at Plymouth\nwere received at an hour which, in England, fell in the middle of the night.\nThe case next to be cited is a thoroughly modern one, and is in\nfact still in course of development. Mr. W. T. Stead, the well-known\njournalist and editor of the Review of Reviews, has repeatedly called\nattention in that magazine to the telepathic correspondence which he\nis able to maintain with several persons, who \"write through his\nhand \" while at a distance, and thus convey to him information which\nthough sometimes erroneous, is true in a far larger proportion of\ninstances than chance would allow. Mr. Stead has been good enough\nto introduce me to four of these correspondents, who confirm his\nstatements, and to give me the written testimony of a fifth and sixth.\nI propose with his permission, to quote three of these cases at length.\nThe most important of Mr. Stead's telepathic correspondents thus\nfar is a lady whom he describes as A, but on whom, for the sake of\nclearness\u2014among many initials\u2014I shall bestow the name of Miss\nSummers. This lady is engaged on literary work of a kind needing\nmuch care and accuracy. I consider her a good witness.\nMiss Summers verbally confirmed to me Mr. Stead's account, given\nbelow, and wrote the following statement: \"I, the subject of Mr.\nStead's automatic writing, known as 'A,' testify to the correctness of\nthe statements made in this report. Mr. Stead's hand wrote these things\njust as they happened ;\u2014excepting, of course, the few incidents which\nhe gives as errors. I should like to add what I think more wonderful\nthan many of the things which Mr. Stead has cited, namely, the\ncorrectness with which he has on several occasions given the name of\npersons whom he has never seen or heard of before. I remember on\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 53\none occasion a person calling upon me with a very uncommon name.\nThe next day I saw Mr. Stead and he read to me what his hand had\nwritten of the visit of this person, giving the name absolutely correctly.\nMr. Stead has never seen that person, and till then had no knowledge\nof his existence.\"\nI now quote from the Review of Reviews for April, 1893, pp. 428-\n430, substituting \" Miss Summers \" for \" A,\" and giving the true sex\nof the correspondent, which Mr. Stead at first altered as an\nadditional precaution against identification.\nM. Aut. 61. How it all Began.\nOne day in August [1892], \"Julia \"\u2014as I call the invisible intelligence\nthat from time to time controls my hand\u2014suddenly wrote, \" Why do you\nthink that it is strange that I should write with your hand ? Any one can\nwrite with your hand.\" I asked what she meant, and she answered, \"Any\nof your friends.\" \"On this earth?\" I asked incredulously. She wrote,\n\"Try it.\" \"Need they know about it?\" \"No.\" \"Then,\" I said,\n\"there will be an end of all secrets in the world.\" She wrote, \" No ; mind\nis in contact with mind all over the world. Any one to whom you can\nspeak if you were within range of the physical senses you could speak to\nmentally wherever he is, because the mind is not trammelled by the limita\ntions of matter.\" She explained that the real self, the Ego, had both mind\nand body as its instruments, by which it could communicate with the out\nside world. Both were instruments, either could be used, but each was not\nalways informed of the use which had been made of the other. That is to\nsay, it was perfectly possible for the Ego to use your mind to direct my\nhand without finding it necessary to inform your physical consciousness\nthat any such communication had taken place. But the mind would no\nmore communicate a secret which the Ego did not wish to be known, than\nthe tongue would be guilty of such an indiscretion, for tongue and mind are\nalike the servants of the real self.\nI. The Test of the Old Thistle.\nI was rather incredulous, but I began experimenting with a friend in\nLondon who was sympathetic. I found that it succeeded to a marvel. That\nis to say, I found that my friend had no difficulty whatever in using my hand\nto communicate information or the expression of the mood of the moment.\nWhen my friend, whom 1 will call Miss Summers, was writing, I said to her\nin the middle of the communication, \"Are you really writing, or is it only\nmy subliminal consciousness?\" My hand wrote, \"I will try and prove to\nyou that I am really writing. There is an object in my hand just now which\nI will bring to your office. I am sitting at my table. It is a small present\nthat I want to make to you. It is an old thistle.\"\n\" What ! \" I said, \"a thistle ?\"\n\" Yes, an old thistle ; it played a part in my life that made it dear to me.\nI will give it to you to-morrow. I will explain to you when I give it. I\nhope you will accept it.\"\nNext day, when my friend came, I asked her if she had brought a present\nfor me. She said no, she had not. She had thought of bringing one, but\n\f54 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nshe had left it at home. I asked her what it was. She said it was such an\nabsurd thing she did not like to mention it. When I pressed her she said\nit was a piece of scented soap ! I was considerably disgusted at this apparent\nfailure, and told her why. She said at once, \" That is very curious. Every\nthing happened as you have it written there, and it is a thistle, and an old\nthistle. But it is a thistle that is stamped on the piece of soap. I will\nbring it to you next time I see you. It did play a part in my life,\" which\nshe then proceeded to explain. I have the soap now in my possession. It\nis stamped with a thistle. [The private incident has been explained to me,\nand shows that it was the thistle stamped on the soap which gave that object\nits significance. Miss Summers had thought of the gift before Mr. Stead's\nhand wrote,\u2014perhaps at the exact time of his writing.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nA Journey Described.\nShe wrote from time to time describing her movements. The first dis\npatch which is worth quoting was one I received on Saturday, September\n18th. It will be noticed that there are inaccuracies, but they are very\nslight.\n\" I went to Waterloo Station by the 12.0 train and got to Hampton\nCourt about one. When we got out we went to an hotel and had dinner. It\ncost nearly 3s. After dinner I went to the picture galleries. I was very\nmuch pleased with the painting of many of the ceilings ; I was also inter\nested in most of the portraits by Lely. After seeing the galleries I went out\ninto the grounds. How beautiful they are ! I saw the great vine, that lovely\nEnglish garden, the avenue of elms, the canal, the great water sheet, the\nthree views, the fountain, the gold fishes, and then I lost myself in the maze.\nI got home about nine o'clock. It cost me altogether about 6s.\"\nOn communicating this to Miss Summers, she said that everything was\nright with two exceptions. She went down by the 2.0 train and not by the\n12.0, and gotto Hampton Court about three. The dinner cost her 2s. lid.,\nwhich was \"nearly 3s.,\" and the total cost of the expedition was 6s. 3d.\nThe places were visited in the order in which they were named. The only\nmistake was the train by which Miss Summers went to Hampton Court.\nThe Unreserve or the Real Self.\nThen came some curious experiences which showed that the real self\nwhich wrote with my hand was much more ready to communicate its wants\nthan the physical self. On September 20th, for instance, my hand wrote\nfrom Miss Summers :\u2014\n\"I have had rather a sad day. I have had a disappointment in some\nwork, or rather in the payment of some work, and as the result I am rather\nshort of money. I don't like to tell you this, because you will want to give\nme some. But I don't want you to. I am rather pinched for money-\njust now ; I have \u00a33 to pay for lodgings. But I will pull through.\"\nI said, \" I will send you the money.\" My hand wrote and said, \" No, I\nwon't take it. I will send it back if you do. I don't like to seem\nmercenary.\" On sending up to Miss Summers the next day I found that it\nwas as stated, but that she was very much disgusted on finding that I knew\nof her needs.\nFrom that time forward any incident was reported as a matter of course\n\fThe StMiminal Consciausness. 55\nby her. Occasionallyan incident would be slightly misstated, but broadly\nspeaking out of 100 statements 90 were as correctly written by my hand\nas if Miss Summers had written them herself.\nA Trip to Windsor.\nOne among many may be mentioned. It was written on October 15th.\nThis was interesting, because my hand wrote the communication when I\nwas 250 miles distant in the North of England.\n\" It is a very fine day. I went from Paddington by the 1.15 train.\nWhen I got to Windsor I went to the Castle. I went first upon the terrace,\nthen I went to St. George's Chapel. I thought it might be as well to stay\nthere, but reconsidered it, and thought I would go into the park. So I left\nthe Castle and went into the park. I wanted to find a beautiful oak that\nI had spoken of to you. There were many deer and many great trees,\nbut I could not find the oak. I wandered about for some time until I found\na beautiful oak, but it was not the oak I wasjn search of. After finding it\nI went for a walk to seek a cavern, but could find none. I have spent for the\nrailway 3s. ; for food I spent half-a-crown. I spent 6d. for a telegram, and\ntaking two busses made my expenses for to-day 5s. lOd.\"\nThis was exactly correct in every particular, as to the time of the train,\nand the succession of events, and the sum of money paid, [although wrongly\nadded up].\nAutomatic Correspondence.\nFor several months past I have almost every day received communica\ntions from my friend when anything interested her, or she felt she had any\nthing to communicate with me. The immense majority of these communi\ncations are of a private character, and can only be referred to here. Often\nthey are but brief memoranda regarding a visit to a church or a business\nappointment, or a visit to some friend. Frequently mention is made of\nbooks she has been reading, and the usual information given as to the state\nof health, of good spirits or depression, which one friend might send to\nanother. On one occasion she startled me by reporting a rather disagree\nable fracas which had taken place in a carriage on the South Western\nRailway, but which fortunately terminated happily. The aggressor took\nalarm and jumped out of the train as it was slowing up at a station. Nor\nwas it only contemporary events which were described. On one occasion a\nrather painful chapter in my friend's history, which she had shrunk from\ntelling me in detail, was written out by my hand with the utmost minutiae,\nand, as she informed me when I read it over to her, with the most absolute\naccuracy. Although it had happened some years ago it had made a very\ndeep impression upon her mind at the time, and it remained as vividly\npresent in her mind as if it had happened on the previous day. In my com\nmunications with this correspondent, Miss Summers, the mistakes are\nextremely small. I have frequently kept appointments, and written letters,\nand even sent cheques, in response to communications written by my hand,\nnor have I on any of these occasions found that there was a mistake.\nOnce or twice my hand has written that Miss Summers was about to visit\nme and I have been disappointed, but in every case I have afterwards\nlearned that she had actually started to call upon me, but had been\nhindered by some unforeseen event.\n\f56 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nErrors in Transmission.\nThere have been, however, two or three occasions when there have been\ncurious errors in detail. These are quite as important to note as those cases\nin which the messages have been correct. The first error was a statement\nthat on a certain Saturday afternoon she had walked in Regent's Park,\nwhereas, as a matter of fact, she had not left her house. I do not know how\nthat error arose ; there may have been some expectation on my part that she\nwas going to walk in the park, but, whatever the cause, the fact remains\nthat it was a mistake. On another occasion a still more remarkable error\noccurred. It was when I was at Redcar. My hand wrote an account of an\ninterview which it said Miss Summers had had with a certain person who\nwas named. It was a disagreeable interview, and portions of the conversa\ntion were reported. On comparing notes I found, to my surprise, that while\n\u2022he had been to the office of the person in question, the interview which was\nreported had not taken place with him or my friend. The conversation re\nproduced had, however, taken place between a friend of Miss Summers's\nand another person. Miss Summers's friend had told her what had taken\nplace, and my hand had given a very much exaggerated account of that con\nversation at a distance of 250 miles. Miss Summers's friend was personally\nunknown to me, and Miss Summers was very much astonished to find that\nher friend's interview was attributed to herself and interpolated into her\nbusiness conversation with another party.\nInstances of Inaccuracies.\nI will close my account of my experiences in automatic telepathy with\nMiss Summers with a report which was curiously inaccurate in some points.\nFor me the inaccuracies have more interest than the accurate statement. I\nam so accustomed to use this faculty for the everyday purposes of life, that\nan accurate statement is to me a matter of course ; it is the inaccurate state\nment which puzzles me. On Christmas Day I knew that Miss Summers in\ntended to visit Matthew Arnold's grave. That I knew, but nothing else.\nOn the afternoon of Christmas Day my hand wrote a narrative of what had\nhappened. It stated that in the morning my friend had gone to St. Paul's\nto attend the service, where she had enjoyed the music very much. After\nleaving St. Paul's she had gone home, and then had gone to Paddington\nStation, where she took a ticket for Laleham. When my hand wrote this\nI stopped, and asked whether there was a station at Laleham. My hand\nwrote Yes, and continued that she had taken a return ticket to Laleham,\nwhich had cost about 3s. 6d. It was a beautiful day, and there were very\nfew people in the train. It went on to say that she had gone to the church,\nand had had no difficulty in finding the grave. There was no one in the\nchurchyard but Miss Summers. She stayed there about half-an-hour, and\nlaid on the tomb some white flowers, the name of which my hand tried to\nwrite, but only succeeded in making unintelligible scrawls. She had then\ncome back to the station. The train was nearly empty, and Miss Summers\nhad a compartment to herself all the way to London. Returning home\nshe spent the evening in front of a roaring fire, reading Arnold's poems.\nI did not see her for several days, and then I told her the narrative.\nI learned that while on the whole the statement was quite correct, in three\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 57\nminor details it was erroneous. Miss Summers did not go to Laleham\nfrom Paddington; but from Waterloo. I can only explain that mistake by\nsaying that as the previous journey to Windsor had been made from\nPaddington, possibly my mind thought that she would start again from the\nsame station, and thus led my hand to write wrongly. As for the railway\nfare, I believe it was wrong ; but my friend did not remember how much\nchange she got out of the half-sovereign with which she had paid for her\nticket. The other mistake was that the flowers she had laid on the tomb\nwere not white, but blue. The name of the flowers Miss Summers did\nnot know, and this of course accounts for the unintelligible scrawl which\nwas the only reply when asked for the name. Before seeing my friend, I had\nreferred to a railway guide to see if there was a station at Laleham ; I found\nthat there was none. I thought that my hand had been writing wrongly ;\nbut when I asked my friend where she took her ticket for, she replied\nat once, \"To Laleham.\" I said, \"Why, there is no station at Laleham.\"\n\" No,\" she said ; \"but I asked the booking-clerk for a ticket to Laleham,\nand he gave me one for Staines, and said that was the station for\nLaleham. \"\nII. The second case is interesting as involving a very distinct state\nment from a slight acquaintance. I quote from the Review of Reviews,\np. 432, and add a corroborative letter.\nI will conclude this very imperfect account of the communications which\nhave been going on now for more than seven months\u2014hardly a day of which\nhas passed without communications of one kind or another\u2014by describing a\nremarkable instance in which a comparative stranger to me communicated to\nme things by my hand which he had expressly refused to communicate face\nto face. Last February, I met a correspondent in a railway carriage with\nwhom I had a very casual acquaintance. Knowing that he was in consider\nable distress, our conversation fell into a more or less confidential train, in\nwhich I divined that his difficulty was chiefly financial.\nThe Hand more Communicative than the Tongue.\nI said I did not know whether I could be of any help to him or not, but\nI asked him to let me know exactly how things stood, what were his debts,\nhis expectations, and so forth. He said that he really could not tell me, and\nI refrained from pressing him. We parted at the railway station. That\nnight I received a letter from him apologising for not having given me\nthe information, but saying that he really could not. I received that letter\nabout ten o'clock, and about two o'clock next morning, before going to\nsleep, I sat down in my bedroom and said, \" You did not like to tell me\nyour exact financial position face to face, but now you can do so through my\nhand. Just write and tell me exactly how things stand. How much money\ndo you owe ? \" My hand then wrote, \" My debts are \u00a390.\" In reply to a\nfurther inquiry whether the figure was accurately stated, \" ninety pounds \"\nwas then written in full.\n\"Is that all?\" I asked.\nMy hand wrote, \"Yes ; and how I am to pay them I do not know.\"\n\" Well,\" said I, \"how much do you want for that piece of property you\nwish to sell ? \"\n\f98 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nMy hand wrote, \" What I hope is, say, \u00a3100 for that. It seems a great\ndeal, but I must get money somehow. Oh, if I could get anything to do, 1\nwould gladly do anything ! \"\n\" What does it cost you to live '( \" I asked.\nMy hand wrote : \"I do not think I could possibly live under \u00a3200 a\nyear ; you see I have to keep some relatives besides myself. If I were\nalone I could live on \u00a350 per annum, but there is rent and everything.\nWhere can I get this ? I cannot tell.\"\nA Successful Result.\nThe next day I made a point of seeking my friend. He said, \"I hope\nyou are not offended at my refusing to tell you my circumstances, but I do\nnot think it is right to trouble you with them.\" I said, \" I am not offended\nin tho least, and I hope you will not be offended when I tell you what I have\ndone.\" I then explained this automatic telepathic method of communica\ntion. I said, \" I do not know whether there is a word of truth in what my\nhand wrote. I hesitate at telling you, for I confess I think that the sum\nwhich was written as the amount of your debts cannot be correctly given.\nIt seems to me to be much too small, considering the distress in which you\nseemed to be. Therefore I will read you that first, and if it is right I will\nread you the rest ; but if it is wrong I will consider that it is rubbish, and\nthat your mind in no way influenced my hand.\" He was interested but\nincredulous. \" But,\" I said, \" before I read you anything, will you form a\ndefinite idea in your mind as to how much your debts amount to ; secondly,\nas to the amount of money you hope to get for that property ; thirdly, what\nit costs to keep up your establishment with your relatives ; and fourthly,\nwhat could you live upon if you were by yourself ? \" \" Yes,\" said he, \"I\nhave thought of all these things.\" I then read out, \"The amount of your\ndebts is about \u00a390.\" He started. \" Yes,\" said he, \" that is right ; but the\nfigure I was going to mention was \u00a3100. But that includes some money for\ncurrent expenses.\"\nThen I said, \" As it is right I will read you the rest. You hope to get\n\u00a3100 for your property.\" \" Yes,\" said he, \" that was the figure that was in\nmy mind, although I hesitated to mention it, for it seems too much.\"\n'' You say you cannot live upon less than \u00a3200 a year with your present\nestablishment.\" \" Yes,\" said he, \" that is exactly right. \"\n\"But if you were by yourself, you could live on \u00a350 a year.\" \" Well,\"\nsaid he, \"a pound a week was what I had fixed in my mind.\" Therefore\nthere had been a perfectly accurate transcription of the thoughts in the\nmind of a comparative stranger, written out with my own hand at a time\nwhen we were at a distance of some miles, within a few hours of the time\nwhen he had written apologising for not having given me the information for\nwhich I had asked.\nI could multiply instances of the same kind of thing, but this will\nprobably suffice.\nThe unconscious correspondent confirms as follows, in a letter in\nmy possession. I suppress his name, but it may be given to inquirers.\nApril 6th, 1893.\nDear Mr. Stead,\u2014I received your communication and have no hesitation\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 5&\nin allowing you to submit it to the P. R. Society. The statements are\ncorrect. I was unaware of the experiment until next day. I consider the\nproof a very striking one, as from some circumstances connected with my\n[affairs] you could not possibly have formed an estimate even\u2014at least I think\nit hardly possible,\u2014of what my debts, prospects, or expectations were.\nI am, yours faithfully, E. J.\nIII. The third case which I shall quote also involves a message\nfrom a comparative stranger :\u2014\nAn Impromptu Test.\nIt may be said that between my friend \" Miss Summers,\" my son, and\nmyself there existed a knowledge that I would try to let them write with my\nhand, but this can hardly be said in an impromptu experiment which I made\nwith a correspondent whom I had only seen once before in my life. Some\nmonths ago I was at Redcar, in the North of England. A foreign lady who\ndoes some work for the Review had to meet me at Redcar railway station\nabout three o'clock. I was staying with my brother, who lives about ten\nminutes' walk from the station. At twenty minutes to three it occurred to\nme that \" about three,\" the phrase used in her letter, might mean some time\nbefore three, and as I could not lay my hand upon a time-table, I simply\nasked her to use my hand and tell me what time the train was due. This, I\nmay say, was done without any previous communication with her upon the\nsubject. She immediately wrote her name, and said the train was due at\nRedcar station at ten minutes to three. I saw that I should have to leave at\nonce, but before starting I asked her where she was at that moment. My\nhand wrote, \" I am in the train at Middlesborough railway station, on my\nway from Hartlepool to Redcar.\" I then went off to the station. On arriv\ning there I went up to the time-table to see when the train was due. It was\ntimed to arrive at 2.52. The train, however, was late ; three o'clock came,\nand it had not arrived. At five minutes past three, getting rather anxious,\nI took a slip of paper from my pocket, and taking a pencil in my hand,\nasked her where she was. At that moment she wrote her name (they always\nwrite their names at the beginning and end of each communication), and\nsaid, \" I am in the train, rounding the curve before you come to the Redcar\nstation ; I will be with you in a minute.\" \" Why the mischief have you\nbeen so late?\" I mentally asked. My hand wrote, \" We were detained at\nMiddlesborough for so long ; I do not know why.\" I put the paper in my\npocket, walked to the end of the platform, and there was the train ! The\nmoment it stopped I went up to my friend and said to her, \" How late you\nare ! What on earth has been the matter ? \" \" I do not know,\" she said.\n\"The train stopped so long at Middlesborough, it seemed as if it never\nwould start.\" I then showed her what my hand had written. The lady in\nquestion confirms as follows :\u2014\nWest Hartlepool, April 4th, 1893.\nMy Dear Friend,\u2014I most certainly and very distinctly remember the\noccasion you have referred to in the subjoined newspaper cutting. I was\nmuch surprised when you told me that you had made me telepath you the\ntime I should arrive at Redcar, as I was quite unconscious of having telepathed\nany information to you with regard to my arrival. I don't see that I can add\n\f\u20ac0 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nanything to your account of the incident. It is very clear, and I can make\nno corrections.\u2014Yours sincerely, Gbeda Grass.\nMr. Stead also favoured me with an account of further experiments\nwith his own son (see p. 430 of Review of Reviews), being a narrative of\nincidents on a bicycle tour, as written by Mr. Stead's hand, and as\nactually recorded by his son, Mr. William Stead. This was a good and\ncareful experiment, and contains messages which to the persons\nconcerned seem beyond the scope of chance. There are, however, a\ngood many mistakes ; nor is it quite easy to estimate how far the little\nincidents of such a journey might have been unconsciously foreseen by\na father at home.\nThere is an evidential difficulty of a somewhat similar kind with\nregard to the experiment with \" B \" given on p. 431, of which \" B \"\nhas kindly given me a written confirmation. The point which Mr. Stead\nthere makes is an interesting one, and is in conformity with evidence\nalready adduced. \" B \" willed to transfer certain statements to Mr.\nStead ; but the statements which were actually transferred were for\nthe most part not these, but (as \" B \" expressed it) \" all the thoughts\nthat kept bobbing up in my mind when I have been trying to make\nyou write the other things.\" \" This,\" says Mr. Stead, \" was an\ninteresting experiment, as it seems to indicate that this power is\nexercised not so much by the power of the will of the conscious mind as\nby the spontaneous action of the subliminal consciousness.\" This may\nwell be so ; but in the present instance the statements written by Mr.\nStead (and which he read to me), seemed to me to be scarcely\nso unexpected and definite as to make it quite certain either that Mr.\nStead's own subliminal self might not have supplied them, or that \" B \"\ncould clearly have remembered that these special facts \" bobbed up \"\nat that special moment.\nIt will be observed, indeed, that throughout these experiments of Mr.\nStead's the telepathic correspondent communicates not what his supra\nliminal self, but what his subliminal, desires to communicate. It is as\nthough, not Leonie I., but Leonie II., were to have used Professor\nJanet's hand for the purposes of her outspoken correspondence. This\nadds some difficulty to the evidential record ; but in itself it is a fact\nof great interest, and is, I need not repeat, in thorough accord with what\nthe theories advanced in these papers would have led us to expect.\nMr. Stead's experiments, indeed, are so precisely confirmatory of the\nexistence of a continuously active subliminal consciousness in all man\nkind that I almost shrink from pressing cases which look as though\nthey had been constructed (although they most certainly were not)\nexpressly to bolster up my own hypotheses.\nIn reply to further inquiry Mr. Stead says :\u2014\n\" I quite appreciate the need of seeing the original MS., but it is em\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 61\nbodied in a mass of other matter, some of which is extremely confidential,\nand I think that it would be much better to begin de now.\"\nWe hope, therefore, to be able to report further on Mr. Stead's\nwritings at no distant date.\nMy next case is on a smaller scale, but equally encouraging, I\nthink, in its own way.\nI have often urged that attempts should be made to imitate Mr.\nand Mrs. Newnham's series of experiments in the transference of an\nunseen question through an automatist's subliminal self to his pencil ;\nand I have lately been fortunate enough to find a friend,\u2014Mr. R. H.\nButtemer, of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, a graduate in honours in\nNatural Science,\u2014willing to make a serious endeavour of this kind.\nSome perseverance was required ; but a friend of Mr. Buttemer's, Mr.\nH. T. Green, having first been several times lightly hypnotised by Mr.\nButtemer, showed during some months unmistakable power as a per\ncipient. I was cognisant of the experiments throughout ; although on\nthe only occasion on which I was myself present Mr. Green'smind was\ndistracted by a theological examination which he was to pass next day,\nand his pencil would write little but names of kings of Israel and\nJudah. The conditions were throughout good ; the question being\nwritten down out of Mr. Green's sight, and indications carefully\navoided. In the last sitting Mr. Green had his back to all the other\npersons present\u2014which is of course the right plan ;\u2014and that sitting\nwas, as will be seen, the best of all. But considering the nature of the\nquestions asked, there was, I think, little opportunity for unconscious\nindications, even when some of the persons who knew the question\nwere within sight of Mr. Green. There was never any contact. The\nselection of questions and answers given below is a nearly average\nsample ;\u2014those which are omitted being mainly questions on private\naffairs, where the answers were necessarily less definite than numbers\nor htiers, and where their degree of correctness would need cumbrous\nexplanation. The best answer is certainly the spelling out of John\nBou\u2014from the unseen card.\nThe answers here classed as \" irrelevant \" were sometimes a repro\nduction of thoughts likely to be in the operator's mind (persons like\nJeroboam and Omri frequently turning up) ; and sometimes, I think,\nrepresented imperfect efforts of the subliminal self to get at the unseen\nquestion. In this and other points these experiments resemble the\nmuch more completely successful Newnham series. There is no\napparent reason for the cessation of Mr. Green's power. He is a\nhealthy man, but had one or two trifling ailments during the experi\nments, which seemed to check the faculty for the time. Mr. Green,\nMr. W., and Mr. S. are known to me ; and all, I think, have pursued\nthe inquiry in a scientific spirit. The frivolous and roundabout\n\fG2 Mr. F. W. II. Myers.\nstyle of the replies is very characteristic of automatic messages in their\nearlier stages. I now give Mr. Buttemer's account.\nAutomatic Writing Experiments with Planchette.\nM. Aut. 62.\nThe following series of experiments were conducted at Cambridge, the\noperator being Mr. Green, of Emmanuel College. The agentR (present\nduring all the experiments described) were Mr. W. and Mr. Buttemer. The\nseries of experiments commenced on November 12th, 1892 : prior to this Mr.\nGreen had made one or two moro or less successful attempts at automatic\nwriting, but the obvious difficulty of avoiding the chance of conscious inter\nference where the questions put were asked aloud had prevented the\nfollowing up of these till the suggestion was made that the questions should\nbe written down and concealed from the operator. Under these conditions a\ntrial was made on the above date, time 2 p.m., the questions being known\nonly to the two agents. No one else was present.\nQ. : What is number on machine ? (an automatic dice-box, none of the\nthree having seen the numbers on it).\nA. : Give another.\nQ. : Who is ill on this staircase ?\nA. : Ke pike pike. (A man of that name, Pike, was ill, as all were aware ;\nbut Mr. Green had not seen the question.) All then (Mr. Green included)\nlooked at the dice-box, and saw the number\u2014seven\u2014on it.\nQ. : Why would you not answer first question 1\nA. : Seven.\nAnother question was then correctly answered.\nQ. : What is the matter with H. T. Green ?\nAnswer referred to previous question.\nQuestion was put again, still without Mr. Green seeing it.\nA. : A bad cold. (Correct.)\nQ. : Why cannot (Mr. W.) write with Planchette?\nA. : W , you mean. There is nothing in good health. Liver is not\nin good condition.\nQ. : Whose liver is not right ?\nA. : i. (Irrelevant.) ii. Nobody particularly.\nQ. (By Mr. Buttemer) : Where am I going this afternoon ?\nAfter waiting some time the answer was written rapidly.\nA. : Away, away, away.\nMr. Green knew where I was going, but did not write a more definite\nanswer automatically.\nEight questions were put in all, of which four were answered immediately\nand correctly, and two after a sentence referring to the previous question had\nbeen written. The first and third were not answered, the answer to the first\nbeing unknown to the agents, while at the third Mr. Green's subliminal\nconsciousness appeared to seize the opportunity of showing its just-acquired\nknowledge of the first. [When two answers are given, the operator was\nsimply told to write again, after the first irrelevant answer, without being\nshown the question ; except where otherwise stated.]\nAt the next sitting, on the 14th November, Messrs. W., S., and Buttemer\nwere present, while Mr. Green operated Planchette, as before. Six questions\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 63\n[the answers to which were known to the agents] were put in the same way,\ntwo being answered directly and unmistakeably, while one was answered\nafter some irrelevant writing, two incorrectly, and the last was not answered,\nthe operator appearing tired.\nNovember 20th. Agents and percipient as before. 4 p.m.\nThe questions were put in the same way.\nQ. : Who is J. O. F. M. ? (The initials being given in the question, we\nwished the name to be written.)\nA. : i. Man. Dean. (Rather illegible. ) ii. Murray. (Right. Dean of\nEmmanuel. )\nQ. : Who is G. R. S. 1 (Only S. knew who was meant.)\nA. : Not S . (Here S. told the other agents the name\u2014Smith.) Mr.\nGreen wrote \" Sleep,\" and became drowsy. He was spoken to, to rouse\nhim, and the question was written.\nQ. : Why did you become drowsy and write \" Sleep \" ?\nA. : H. T. Green (pause) cannot help himself.\nQ. : Why?\nA. : He is tired, he is tired, he is tired. (Written very fast.)\nJanuary 31st, 1893. 4 p.m. Agents as before,with the addition of Mrs.\nH. and Miss B.\nQ. : How many cups of tea did Miss B. have ?\nA. : i. Cannot be ascertained, ii. It was in all two\u20142 2 2. (Correct.)\n(When a second answer was waited for, care was taken that the writer\nshould glean no idea of the question in the interval.)\nQ. : What engraving is on the wall over the piano ? (It was one of the\nQueen soon after her marriage.)\nA. : i. You may perceive it was so. (Apparently referring to previous\nquestion.) ii. It is a girl, the daughter of a man.\nQ. : Who was playing the piano when the ladies came in 1\nA. : i. The clock hath stricken five. (The clock struck just as Mr.\nGreen began to write.) ii. Mr. S. (This was correct.)\nQ. : What was it?\nA. : i. The one that was asked first, ii. Something, iii. Explain your\nself more clearly.\nQ. : What was S. playing when we came in ?\nA.: i. The original one of all. ii. All I can say is \" La Cigale. \" (Correct.)\nTwo more questions were answered correctly, and then the writer began\nwriting on a subject in his mind at the time, and four more questions that\nwere put received no direct answers.\nFebruary 18th. 8 p.m. Mrs. H., Miss B., Mr. and Miss M. present, in\naddition to Mr. Green, and Messrs. S., W., and Buttemer.\nMr. Green, as usual, operated Planchette, and on this occasion sat with\nhis back to all the other persons present.\nQ. (from Mr. M.) : What was I doing this afternoon ?\nA. : i. the sun (all else illegible), ii. Enjoying the fresh air\nof heaven.\nQ. : What was Mr. Rogers doing in Cambridge ?\nA. : i. (Irrelevant, or possibly connected vaguely with the question.)\nii. Ask another, but Mr. Rogers came up on important business connected\nwith the Lodge. (Correct.)\n\f64 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nQ. : Where has Mrs. M. gone ?\nA. : i. (Irrelevant.) ii. Far, far away, but more next time. iii. Her\nmother has gone to\u2014oh, what a happy place is London ! iv. All change\nhere for Bletchley. (Mrs. M. had possibly passed this station on her\njourney.)\nQ. : Who has won the Association Match to-day 1\nA. : i. (Illegible.) ii. O ye simple ones, how long will ye love simplicity ?\nWhy, Oxford, of course. [This fact was known to some persons in the room,\nbut not to Mr. Green.]\nOne of the company then suggested the attempt to get the name on a\nvisiting card transmitted, and the question was written, \"Write name on\ncard. \" Mr. Green did not know that this experiment was about to be tried,\nand the card was picked from a pile at random. The name was John B.\nBourne. A sentence was written by Mr. Green, which proved to be, \" Think\nof one letter at a time and then see what will happen.\" We did so.\nA. : i. J for Jerusalem, 0 for Omri, H for Honey, and N for Nothing,\nii. B for Benjamin, O for Olive, U for Unicorn. (The remaining letters were\ngiven incorrectly.)\nQ. : How many of the Society's books are here ? (There were two\nvolumes of Proceeding* on the table.)\nA. : i. (Irrelevant.) ii. The answer is 100-98.\nQ. : What is 2 x 3?\nTwo irrelevant answers were given, possibly owing to a slight disturbance\nin the room. The third answer was\u2014\" When that noise has ceased and\nS. has finished knocking the lamp over I say 6.\"\nA trial shortly after this, February 19th, gave no results, and the power\nof automatic writing appears to have entirely left Mr. Green for the present.\nI pass on to a small group of cases which form a curious transition\nfrom these communications inter vivos to communications which I\nshall class as coming from the dead. These are cases where the\nmessage professes to come from a deceased person, but shows internal\nevidence of having come, telepathically, from the mind of someone\npresent. I shall begin with a case such as is often cited as proof\n(insufficient proof, I think,) that a deceased person is communicating.\nDr. Hodgson's informant, Mr. Lewis, a man of business in\nCincinnati, states that an automatist to whom his (Mr. Lewis's) family\nwere absolutely unknown wrote a message, with true name, purporting\nto come from an infant sister long deceased. Mr. Lewis, naturally\nenough, accepts this message, as similar messages have often been\naccepted, as an indication of his sister's actual presence.\nFrom Mr. S. Lewis, 347, Baymiller-avenue, Cincinnati.\nM. Aut. 63. April 9th, 1888.\n\" On January 28th last I called at the house of some friends ; and on this\noccasion there was some planchette writing. The friends I called on, I\nbelieve, are professed Spiritualists. Some four or five of us (I also did) sat\naround a table in a full and well lighted room (lighted the entire evening).\nThe operator of the planchette was a lady ; her husband was at the table,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 65\nalso three other friends, including myself. Different communications (so\ncalled) were received by different ones at the table, from different friends\n(as the Spiritualists say), who have passed into the spirit world. I can't give\nall communications to-day, but one I wish to state. But first let me say\nthat many years since in my father's family the first little one that came to\nlive\u2014a short time\u2014with them was a little girl, named Angeline ; she lived\nonly about two years and died ; next to this little girl was a brother, named\nCharles (in after life a clergyman in the Episcopal Church) ; and next to\nCharles was another little sister also named Angeline, and next to her was\nanother sister named B. Ann ; then next to B. Ann appeared, well, your\nhumble servant, myself, to behold many of the beauties of this beautiful\nworld. So that you see that between the two brief years of my first little\nsister, Angeline (1st), and my own coming on this globe there was born one\nbrother and two sisters ; therefore, my first little sister, Angeline (1st), I\nnever saw ; and only heard my mother (in her lifetime) speak of Angeline\n(1st), and I have also seen her name in the records, &c. , in the Bible at my\nold home.\n\"The operator of the planchette, on the evening of which I am speaking,\nknew nothing of my father's family (excepting, of course, myself). I never\nhad mentioned one word to the operator (of planchette), or anyone else in\nthat little company, anything whatever about my brothers and sisters or even\nabout my father's family in any way or manner ; and besides, we all lived\nand grew up in the north part of the State, not far distant from Lake Erie,\nwhile the operator has (I think) lived in the south part of this State not far\ndistant from the Ohio River ; and there never has been any acquaintance nor\nany communication between any member of my father's family (or anyone\nelse even) to give any history or information of any kind to the operator,\nand I certainly never gave the operator any information whatever until after\nthe occurrence and the writing on the planchette, which wrote this evening,\nJanuary 28th last, the following, viz. : ' Mr. Lewis, I am his sister, I am\nglad you came here to-night ; come again (signed) Angeline.'\n\" Now I want to ask, how could originate in the mind of operator any\nideas or thoughts about this little sister Angeline (1st) and myself ? I had not\nfor years past even thought of her until the name was written on the evening\nspoken of.\n\" The operator is not, never has been a paid medium. S. Lewis.\"\nNow let us consider a similar message, which might have produced\na similar belief in another informant's mind. ' But here it so happened\nthat he tested the alleged fact of death ; and found that the supposed\n.spirit was still alive at the time of the message. The correspondent,\nMr. G. S. Long, is known to Dr. Hodgson.\nM. Aut. 64.\nJersey City, N.J., October 22nd, 1888.\n******\n\" I think I wrote you once that about two years ago I had received what\nwas said to be a most convincing test of spirit-return, convincing to all\nexcept myself. A young lady, a Spiritualist and medium, though not a\nprofessional, nor one that ever received one cent in pay, by means of a\nlettered board and toy chair, she holding one leg of the chair and I another,\nP\n\f66 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwhile a third let; of the chair served as a pointer, gave the following by\nmeans of the chair :\u2014\n\" First the chair spelt out my name and showed a disposition to get in my\nlap; then it spelled out ' CARY,' and when I asked for the name of the\n' spirit ' it spelt out ' George (my name), you ought to know me as I am\nJim.' But I didn't, and said so. Then, without my looking at the board,\nit spelt out 'Long Island, \u2022 Jim Rowe,' and 'Don't you remember I\nused to carry you when you were a little fellow,' or words to that effect. I\nhad to acknowledge the truth of it and also to say that as he was an ignorant\nman he possibly intended ' CARY ' for carry. I must own I was puzzled\nfor the moment. To make sure of his power I asked that he count the\npickets in the fence outside of the house and I would go out and confirm his\nstatement. Somehow he couldn't agree to this, and even the medium\nobjected. As a last resort I asked how long he had been in the spirit land\nand the answer came, between 13 and 14 years.\n\"Now to the sequel. First it occurred to me a day or two after, that\nwhile all the incidents given were correct, the name should have been given\nas ROE instead of ROWE. Second, I was upon Long Island this summer,\nand the matter coming to my mind I inquired how long Jim Roe had been\ndead, and was informed he died last winter ; so when I received this test so\nconvincing to the believers the man icas not dead.\n\"Yours truly, Geo. E. Long.\"\nOn October 26th, 1888, Mr. Long adds :\u2014\n\" I do not think that the medium was fraudulent. Her family consists\nof Mr. S. and 3 daughters, she being the youngest. I have found all\nto be hypnotic subjects, with the exception of the eldest daughter. They\nare all believers in Spiritualism, the youngest having been the medium.\nThey do not sit now, as it is claimed that the sittings, while rich in spiritual\nistic satisfaction, were productive of a state of poor health in the medium.\n\"As I myself have obtained information supposed to have been impossible\nfor me to have reached, I cannot say for certainty that she had not obtained\ninformation about Jim, but I don't believe she had. As the name Rowe\nwas being spelled I sat with my eyes turned from the board and had in mind\nthe name Scudder, and mentally followed the taps of the chair to S C U D\u2014\nwhen the medium said, 'The name Rowe is given,' &c. This would seem\nto leave out any involuntary muscular action. Why Rowe should have been\ngiven instead of Roe is still another phase. I wonder whether if any question\nof the Roe family had arisen I would have had in mind the name of Rowe ?\nIf so, then she produced that which I had long while before been conscious\nof, but was at the time unconscious of, and had it coupled with an error in\nspelling that I might have been guilty of had I myself been called upon at\nthat moment to spell it. Had she been fraudulent the probability is she\nwould have spelt it correctly.\n\" It seems to me that the basis of Spiritualism rests mainly upon this phe\nnomenon which men and women in a supernormal condition produce, with\nout understanding it, and credit to spiritual agencies. \"\n[A general corroboration of Mr. Long's memory of the incident is added\nfrom a lady present at the time, who does not now recall the details.]\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 67\nThe next case is very remote ; and I should not use it to aid in\nestablishing communication with the dead. But as indicating a\npossible source of error it seems worth quoting, as it is vouched\nfor by two informants who, although here anonymous, are distinguished\nand intelligent men. Professor H. writes to Dr. Hodgson in 1889 :\u2014\nM. Aut. 65.\n\" I write you the details of another matter told me by a friend, Hon. Z.,\nof C . He is one of the leading members of the Bar, has repre\nsented his State several times in the National Congress, and has a very clear,\ndiscriminating, and vigorous intellect. He does not believe in Spiritualism,\nbut regards its phenomena as illusions or hallucinations. In his youth, in\n1854, he had taught a winter's term in his native town of P , and in the\nspring returned to Q to complete his fit for college in the Academy in that\nplace. One evening after his return to Q , a party of young people to the\nnumber of eight were gathered about a table to witness the trance-writing\nof one of their number, a Miss A., a very beautiful girl of eighteen years\nof age, and the music teacher of the Academy. She wrote the name of Mr.\nZ. 's father, , who had died in 1845, and whom no one in the room\nsave his son could have known. I may add that none of the party save\nmy friend knew anything about P or its inhabitants. Mr. Z. declared\nthat he did not believe his father had anything to do with the writing. At\nthis Miss A., who sat on the opposite side of the table from Mr. Z., arose,\ncame about to his side, drew her pencil several times rapidly across the two\nmiddle fingers of his left hand, returned to her seat, and wrote quickly,\n' Does this convince you ? ' Mr. Z. said that those two fingers were gone\nfrom his father's left hand, having been cut off in his boyhood. Mr. Z. was\nstartled, but still expressed his disbelief. Miss A. then wrote H. T. Y.'s\nname, and continued : ' Killed on day of , sliding down M\nHill, running off embankment, broke his neck ; Rev. Mr. W. attended\nfuneral; text: book , chap. , verse ., Both date and text\nwere given with particularity. Mr. W. was a Congregationalist clergyman\nof P , and Mr. Y.'s family were active and leading members of his\nchurch. Mr. Y. had been one of Mr. Z.'s pupils that winter in P , and with\nthe other boys had coursed M Hill, a very steep hill near the school-\nhouse, and covered with glare ice from summit to foot. Near the foot was\nan embankment wharfed up to sustain the road-bed, and that was a very\ndangerous place to slide by. Mr. Z. had repeatedly warned the boys of the\ndanger, but had not deemed it best to forbid their sliding. He had worried\nover the matter a great deal, and was exceedingly relieved when school closed\nwithout any accident having happened. Mr. Z. looked up the text and\nfound it entirely inappropriate to a funeral occasion. H. T. Y. is living\nto-day, and is the head of the K School of Technology. This fact made\nMr. Z. scout the whole affair as unworthy of his notice ; but to me it seems\nto indicate a telepathic explanation of both occurrences. I asked Mr. Z. if\neither his father or Mr. Y. were in his mind at the time. He replied, ' No,'\nthey came into his mind with a shock of surprise when their names were\nwritten. We must so suppose the telepathic communication to be without\nconsciousness on the part of the agent.\"\nThe Hon. Z. of this case writes as follows :\u2014\nf 2\n\f68 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\" This statement by Professor H. is correct, and I cannot improve it, or\nmake it more correct by re-writing. Now you may use these facts, but I\nearnestly desire you not to make use of any names or places.\"\nMy next case comes from Dr. Ermacora, of Padua, one of the group\nof savants whose experiments with Eusapia Paladino are mentioned in\nthe Supplement to this Part of our Proceedings. Professor W. James\nhas visited Dr. Ermacora at Padua, and tells me that Dr. Ermacora's\nexperiments are seriously and carefully conducted. Dr. Ermacora\nhimself, for reasons which he states below, regards this message as prob\nably coming from a disembodied intelligence. But it seems to me that\nthe statement as to the date of the letter's arrival may have emanated\nfrom the mind of the Venetian cousin at the time when she meant to\npost her letter in the evening. Dr. Ermacora has sent me a case (not\nfor publication) where a message written by the same automatist pre\ndicted some remarkable points with regard to her own future health.\nSuch a prediction, however,\u2014like the frequently recorded predictions of\nsomnambulists with regard to their own epileptic fits, ifcc.\u2014seems to me\nto belong to the province of the subliminal self, which I conceive as\nmore intimately acquainted with the state of the organism than the\nsupraliminal self can be. Dr. Ermacora is continuing his experiments,\nand we may hope for fresh light upon the source of these messages.\nM. 41.\nPadua, June 17th, 1892.\nThe following case offers some resemblance to that which is quoted in the\nS.P.R. Journal for April, 1892, p. 246 [L. 936], but is in one respect\nmore complete, inasmuch as it seems to show that the presence or near\nneighbourhood of a letter containing news not yet read by the percipient\n(in this case a writing medium) may be without influence on the phenomenon.\nIt has, moreover, I think, a wider interest, as showing that the simple\nmessages obtained by writing or similar means may often be more trustworthy\nthan messages obtained in more complicated and elaborate ways. It is most\ndesirable that cases of this type should be collected in greater numbers and\nwith greater care.\nSignora Maria Manzini, residing here in Padua, has been for a few-\nmonths experimenting with automatic writing, and is habitually controlled\nby a personality which announces itself under the name of Elvira\nOn April 21st, 1892, Signora Maria Manzini received a letter from Venice\ninforming her that her cousin, Maria Alzetta, was seriously ill with phthisis.\nIt was long since Signora Manzini had heard news of this cousin, and she\nonly knew that, having been left a childless widow, she had remarried and\nhad two children by her second husband. On the evening of the same day\nSignora M. was writing in my presence, under the control of Elvira, and\nasked questions as follows :\u2014\nQ. : Can you tell me if my cousin's illness is really serious 1\nAfter a pause of about a minute and a half the answer came\u2014\nA. : She has a very short time to live, and she leaves three lovely children.\nQ. : Did you first know this when I received news of the illness ?\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 69\nA. : No, I have known it for many days, but did not mention it for fear\nof paining Maria [the medium].\nQ. : Why, then, were you so slow just now in answering my question ?\nA. : I went to see how she was, so as to be able to tell you precisely.\nNext day Signora M. wrote to Venice offering to go and see the invalid.\nOn the 24th she received an answer expressing a desire for her arrival, and\nstating that the invalid was at the hospital. She wrote again to ask on what\ndays it was allowed to visit the hospital patients. Before an answer arrived,\nSignora M. wrote in my presence (April 28th) under Elvira's control, and\nwe put the following questions :\u2014\nQ. : How is the invalid at Venice ? Do you know why the answer to my\nletter has not arrived 1 and do you know on what day it is allowed to visit\nthe hospital ?\nA. : The invalid's condition is the same. There is little hope. She has\nundergone a serious operation ; there is danger. To-morrow morning Maria\nwill receive a letter. Visitors such as she are received every day at the\nhospital.\nQ. : Do you mean because Maria is a relation of the invalid's ?\nA. : No, but because she comes from a distance.\nFailing to see what connection there could be between pulmonary disease\nand a surgical operation, we asked :\nQ. : If the patient is in a consumption, what operation can she have\nundergone 1\nA. : She is in a consumption ; but the operation was necessitated by the\nbirth of her last little girl.\nNext morning Signora M. received a post-card from Venice containing\nthese words : \" Amalia inquired at the hospital and was told that you and\nyour mother would be received on any day, as strangers from another city, if\nyou will come when it suits you.\"\nThe date of the letter's arrival and the news contained in it thus corre\nsponded with the prediction. But an embarrassing circumstance remained.\nWhen the postman delivered this letter he said that he had in fact brought\nit to the house on the previous evening, but finding no one at home he had\ntaken it away with him again till the following morning. Thus the messages\nfrom Elvira had been received after the postman had endeavoured to\ndeliver the letter. Had, then, the fact that the letter was already in Padua\ndetermined the communication which announced its approaching delivery\nand part of its content ?\nOn April 30th Signora M. went to Venice and found that her cousin had\nreally had a third child a few months previously, and after its birth had\nbeen ill in a way which had ultimately needed a surgical operation. Another\nsmall detail previously communicated to Signora Manzini by Elvira was\nlikewise found to be true. Signora Manzini made no mention whatever of\nher own experiments, and her cousin at Venice continued entirely ignorant\nof them.\nOn that same evening, April 30th, on Signora Manzini's return from\nVenice to Padua, I was anxious to inquire from the \"control\" as to the effect\nof the presence in Padua of the letter which had been announced on the even\ning of the 28th for the following morning. Under the control of Elvira,\n\f70 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nSignora M. wrote the following answer : \" I did not know that the letter\nhad arrived ; but I was sure that Maria would receive it next morning,\nbecause those who wrote it had intended that it should reach her in the\nmorning. They had intended to post it in the evening, but instead of that\nthey posted it directly it was written. I was, in fact, mistaken ; for it was\na mere chance that it was actually received in the morning.\"\nI then requested Signora M. to write to her friends at Venice in the fol\nlowing terms : \"I would beg you to satisfy a feeling of curiosity on my part\nwith regard to a presentiment which I lrad about your last letter. I should\nlike to know whether it was posted at the hour which you originally\nintended ; or whether you changed your intention and posted it at a different\nhour. Will you please tell me all you remember about this ? \"\nThe following answer was received on May 2nd :\u2014\n\"I had meant to post my last letter to you in the evening, but, fearing to-\nforget it, I posted it at mid-day, when I had occasion to go out.\"\nTo resume the facts. Automatic writing informed us of facts entirely-\nunknown to our ordinary consciousness ; namely, the fact that the invalid\nhad three children, and the fact that she had undergone an operation. Thus\nfar we might invoke telepathy and clairvoyance as the explanation. Then\nthere was a true prediction of the arrival of a letter, and of part of its con\ntent. But although the letter was delivered on the morning specified, it\nhad, in fact, already arrived in Padua when the communication was made-,\nand its non-delivery in the evening was due to accident. Clairvoyance would\nnot explain this incident,, as that power might have been expected to reveal\nthe presence of the letter in Padua. Neither was there an indication of so-\ncalled psychometry\u2014an influence from the nearness of the letter itself. But,\nlastly, an automatic message explains the incident in the simplest manner,\nand that explanation turns out to be the true one.\nDr. G. B. Ermacora.\nC. Thus much for the present with regard to communications\nfrom the living ; and as to the danger that a message purporting to\ncome from a deceased person may in reality emanate from the mind of\none of the living persons present. But this, although a real risk, is by-\nno means the only risk of deception which such messages involve.\nThe communication may conceivably come from some unembodied\nspirit indeed, but not from the spirit who is claimed as its author.\nHave we any way of guarding against this deception ;\u2014any hints wliich-\nmay even help us to conceive the nature of a danger which lies so\nentirely outside our terrene experience 1\nLet us at least make an attempt to consider the possibilities of dis\nembodied existence, apart from any dogmatic preoccupation, and\nsimply in the light of such analysis of terrene personality as our\ndiscussions may have suggested.\n- It is clear in the first place that we must put aside the moral\ndistinctions on which men have mostly dwelt in such speculations as\nthese. Men have for the most part confined themselves to imagining\npersonalities shaped on their own familiar type,\u2014but some of them so\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 71\ngood as to be called angels, some of them so bad as to be called devils.\nThese conceptions have constantly deflected and distorted our present\ninquiries, by suggesting that if we are dealing with intelligences very\ndifferent from our own, these strange intelligences must either be\nimmensely better than ourselves or immensely worse. But this is\neminently an anthropomorphic illusion. Angels and devils there may\nbe, if you like, in indefinite numbers ;\u2014as there may be mermaids and\nsea-serpents in the deep sea ; but that does not make it logical to\nassume that every form of deep-sea life which comes to our net will be\neither a sea-serpent or a mermaid. For our present purpose it will be\nmore instructive to regard man\u2014not as a moderately good being,\u2014\nintermediate between possible extremes of fiendishness and beatitude,\u2014\n\u2014but rather as an extremely complex being, more complex and at the\nsame time more integrated than any other being that we know. As\ncompared with a civilised adult man, all other creatures are less com\nplicated and some are less coherent. The man's earlier stages, whether\nas savage or as infant, are less coherent; and his arrests of dev\u00ablop-\nment, or retrograde processes, are always a sort of disintegration. The\nhysteric exhibits this disintegrative process in its active stage of\nextreme instability ; the dement shows us a kind of stability reached\nwhen the disintegration of personality has been pushed as far as is\nconsistent with keeping a human frame alive.\nIn the animal creation we have unification and specialisation secured\nat the cost of range and adaptability. And we must remember that the\nenormous majority of animals are protozoa, microscopic and unicellular;\nand that the enormous majority of metazoa or multicellular animals\nare parasitical. So that if we were simply told that we were to be in\ntroduced to a great number of new living beings, with no further\ndetails, the presumption would be that these new beings would be\nextremely short-lived, and dependent for their very existence upon\nclose proximity to some higher organism. And by analogy, if we are\ntold that we are to come across a number of denizens of the unseen\nworld, taken at random, the presumption will be that we shall not\nencounter a Gabriel or a Plato, a Beelzebub or a Napoleon, but simply a\nnumber of parasitical existences who perhaps rise into individualisation\nby the mere momentary contact with our own spirits, and sink back again\npresently into some psychical \" womb and tomb of things \" out\nof which they for an instant rose. Or if this be lower than we like to\ngo even in imagination for our comradeships, let us realise at least that\nspirits of the same grade as the higher animals here may be able to\ncommunicate with our spirits simply from the removal of those\nconditions which the struggle for existence has here imposed on the\nanimal creation, and which have fitted them for objects more\nimportant to their well-being than converse with man.\n\f72 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nThe only excuse for speculations so wild as these is that they are at\nleast less wild, more in accordance with analogy, than the popular fears\nwhich see a full-blown \" lying spirit \" in every random utterance of a\nplanchette, and endeavour with Bibles and invocations to test the\ntheology of suspected entities, which (to judge from all that we can\nlearn of them) may be about on the level of a psychical jelly-fish.\nWell, it will next be said, all this may apply to the nameless,\nwitless agencies from which (if not from our own spirits) most of our\nmessages do assuredly come. But what say you to the higher\ncommunications 1 to those that are above and not below the automatist's\nordinary level 1 If these messages come from outside ourselves, have\nyou anything to say of high spirits, such as the senders claim to be ?\nOne suggestion I have, which seems to me to be again founded on\nanalogy and to help in explaining certain fresh difficulties of \" spirit\nidentity \" which meet us so soon as the alleged spirit assumes the\ncharacter of a \"guide,\" and communicates continuous advice or\nteaching.\nWe have seen that on earth the pathway of ascent in the scale of\norganisms is through integration, through unification. The cells of the\nmetazoon\u2014say of man\u2014could have carried on an inferior existence\nseparately ; they have modified and unified themselves into man, and\nhave made an organism more capable than any other of subduing the\nworld. But how, again, has man's organism subdued the world 1 By\nits capacity for further integration ; its ability to collaborate as a unit\nin a social organism, in which the minds of many act as one. These are\ntruisms. But it is not yet a truism to point out that the psychical law\nof telepathy (if such it be) represents a still more advanced, a still\ncloser integrative process. It points to a surer convergence, a more in\ntimate fusion of spirit with spirit than is possible so long as all converse\nhas to pass through mere rifts in the veil of flesh. How far, then, may\nsuch unification extend 1 We have suggested the possibility that para\nsitical minds may form a temporary union (possibly a permanent union)\nwith our own. What if minds like our own should in their turn\nbecome in some way components of a larger spiritual aggregate 1\nThis need not interfere with our individuality. A corpuscle in a human\nartery is as indefeasibly a cell as if it were swimming freely in pond-\nwater. But nevertheless it may give to certain communications\nsomething of a conjoint and collective character, which may interfere\nwith our attempts at individual identification.\nI have suggested these difficulties as possibly inherent in the very\nnature of the unseen world with which we have to deal ;\u2014quite apart\nfrom any deliberate wish to deceive us,\u2014such as may, of course, exist in\nthat world as well as in ours. There also, there may be \" clashings and\nentanglements \"\u2014opposing wills, confusion of memory, desire to banie\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 73\nand annoy. Both for good and for evil the possibilities which these\nmessages open out must long remain beyond our power to estimate or\nto understand.\nAt this point the record may fitly be given of the varied experiences\nof automatic writing which have been intermingled with Miss A.'s\ncrystal-visions, &c., already narrated in my chapter on \" Sensory\nAutomatism.\" Such account as can here be produced is, from various\ncauses, very incomplete. It contains, however, specimens of several of\nthe problems of which mention has already been made. I may remind\nthe reader that this is a case with which I am intimately acquainted,\nhaving carefully watched the progress of the phenomena for some\nyears. The following statements refer largely to facts within my own\nknowledge, and these are given without exaggeration.\nM. Aut 66.\nStatement of Miss A. as to her Automatic Writing.\n\" 1. Origin of the Writing.\u2014About eight years ago we first heard that\npeople could sometimes write without knowing what they wrote ; and that it\nwas supposed that departed friends could communicate in this way. We\ndetermined to try whether any of us could write thus. We tried first with a\nplanchette, and when my mother's hand and my hand were upon it we got\nwriting easily. We did not at first get any message professing to come from\nany spirit known to us.\n\" 2. Mode of Writing.\u2014We soon ceased to use the planchette, and I was\nable to write alone. I can now generally, but not always, write when I sit\nquiet with a pencil in my hand. The writing often comes extremely fast ;\nat a much faster rate than I could keep up by voluntary effort for so long a\ntime. I have to turn over the pages of the large paper which I generally\nuse, and to guard the lines of writing from running into each other, but\nexcept for this there is no need for me to look at the paper, as I can talk on\nother subjects while the writing is going on. I can always stop the writing\nby a distinct effort of will. One curious thing is that my hand is never in\nthe least tired by automatic writing.\n\"3. Character of the Script.\u2014I get various handwritings ; I may have had\na dozen altogether. I may divide these simply into two classes.\n\".4. Large and scrawly hands, which seem to aim at ease of writing,\nrather than at individuality, and do not divide their words, but run on without\na break. Such are the hands of the so-called ' guides ' and of other\n' spirits ' who write frequently. (Whatever the sources of this writing may be,\nI must use the terms which the writing uses in order to avoid constant\nroundabout phrases.) These large running handwritings do differ somewhat\nboth from my own handwriting and from each other ; but they most of\nthem have a general resemblance to a large, rapid scrawl of my own,\nwith an alteration in the shape of some letters so as to avoid breaks in\nthe continuous scrawl. I can almost always tell who is writing ; but there\nare differences in energy, in little details of management of the paper, &c.,\nwhich help me to distinguish, even before the end of the message comes,\nwhen the signature shows me who has been writing. When the pronoun\n1 we' is used there is no signature, as that represents ' the guides.'\n\f74 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\" B. There are also several handwritings which keep a strongly individual\ncharacter, sometimes plainly of an assumed kind ; I mean writing in a way\nin which no one would have written in life. Thus John Longland wrote in\nan odd twisted, serpentine way and very small. We unluckily burnt all his\nwritings except one scrap, as we did not believe that he was a real person.\nA spirit calling himself Detorno makes all the letters square.\n\" Then, again, when the guides are writing in reply to a private question\n> put by some friend of mine they write wrong side up, so that the friend\nsitting opposite to me can read the writing and I cannot. They seem to\nwrite this way just as easily as the other. Sometimes there is mirror-\nwriting. Sometimes each word in a sentence is written backwards, and\nsometimes the whole sentence is written backwards, beginning with the last\nletter of the last word. In a few cases only have we thought that the hand\nwriting resembled what the supposed spirit wrote in life. This was especially\nso in the case of a communication claiming to come from my grandfather,\nwhose handwriting I had never seen. My mother produced an old signature\nof his, and certainly it was like ; but there was not enough of the automatic\nwriting to make us quite sure. When the 'spirit' or 'control,' or what\never it is, leaves me I cannot make it come again, and writing from\nspirits known to us on earth is rare in comparison with writing from the\nguides, or from quite unknown spirits giving fantastic names. Sometimes they\ngive what they say were their real earth-names ; and then we can sometimes\nidentify them ; although there is, of course, this difficulty, that if they are\nobscure we cannot find them, or if they are well-known, people who give mo\ncredit for more knowledge of history than I possess may think that I\nknew all about them, and that the messages come from my own mind.\"\n[\"I think Miss A. has considerably understated the number ofdistinctly\nand remarkably different types of handwriting that have come through her\nhand. I enclose a list of thirteen names of 'guides,' each one of whom\nhas a characteristic handwriting,\u2014invariably the same, however great the\nlength of time that elapses between the communications. In addition to\nthese there have been many instances where personalities,\u2014the so-called\ndead, or occasionally the living\u2014have written in distinct handwritings. \u2014\nH. M. Radnor.\"]\n\" 4. Drawings.\u2014Sometimes my hand is moved to draw instead of to write.\nThe impulse in such cases is quite equally distinct. I never know what I\nam going to draw till the picture is half finished. My hand begins at odd,\nunexpected places ; for instance, with shading in a corner, or at the ear of a\nprofile ; and approaches the principal lines in a way which no artist would\nchoose. There is no rubbing out or alteration of what is once done, but if\nwhatever moves my hand does not like the picture it suddenly scrawls it all\nover and begins again on another piece of paper. Sometimes twenty or\nthirty pieces of paper have been spoilt in this way,\u2014even when the picture\nwas all but finished ; so that if I think that a picture is pretty I sometimes\nbeg someone to take it away from under my hand for fear it should be\nscrawled on. I have no natural gift for drawing, and have only received a\nfew lessons as a child. I could not even copy some of these automatic\ndrawings. I have never of myself painted in oils, but sometimes I am\nmoved to paint automatically in water-colour or oils. I put out a number of\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 75\noil colours in a row, and my brush goes to them automatically and dabs one\nwet colour on the top of another, making a picture which is odd enough, but\nmuch less muddled than might be supposed ; in fact, artists have said that it\nwas curious that a distinct picture could be produced in that way. When I\npaint thus there is no drawing or outline, only the brush-work. These\ndrawings and pictures have a certain boldness and strangeness about them,\nbut they are certainly not like the work of a regular artist.\n\"5. Connection of written toith otlier messages.\u2014The writing sometimes\nexplains or completes other phenomena, as, for instance, figures seen, or\nsentences begun by raps. Sometimes, on the other hand, raps will come when\nI wish to have writing. But the writing will hardly ever explain or in any\nway allude to what really most needs explanation, namely, the crystal-visions.\nThe guides who write seem to know nothing about these visions.\n\"6. Subject of the Writing.\u2014The great mass of the writing consists of\nteachings, as to religion and philosophy. This is what my guides seem to\nwish to give, and it is strange that it should be so, as my own thoughts have\nnot been much directed to such matters.\n\" Another large part of the writing consists in a kind of fantastic, descrip\ntion of the way in which a world was made. The name given with these\nwritings is Gelalius. I suppose that this is a kind of romance. It is very\ndifferent from anything that I should myself ever write or dream of, nor am\nI at all fond of reading romances of that kind. The writing professes to be\ncopied from a book open at that particular chapter, and sometimes a passage\nwill be continued weeks or months after the first part of it was written, as if\nthe book had chanced to be open again at that same place.\n\"Some of the messages, however, deal with earthly matters. Some give\ngeneral advice, some give medical advice, and some show a knowledge of\nthings in the past or present which I do not possess. Some of these messages\nhave been curiously right ; some have been partly right, but confused or\ninterrupted ; and some have been wrong altogether. The sense of time\nseems confused, so that it is hard to say whether the incidents are meant to\nhave happened long ago, or lately, or to be still in the future. Many of the\nmessages we have not tested, as they were about things which did not interest\nus. Often, for instance, there would be messages about events in the news\npapers which I had not thought or cared about.\n\" As to what I have called 'general advice,' I think that this has always\nbeen good when it related to the conduct of the automatic writing itself.\nI should be told, I mean, when to write and when not to write, and what\npeople's presence was desirable, and so forth. The advice is often quite\ndifferent from what we i\/riWi ;\u2014forbidding us to ask people whom we had\ndesired to ask. There has been one very curious case where we were\nrepeatedly told to 'send for' a gentleman whom I will call Mr. C. D., of\nwhom we knew nothing, except that we had seen his name in the papers in\nquite a different connection. It so chanced that a friend of ours knew\nMr. C. D. and brought him to see us, but for some years there seemed to be\nno particular result. Lately, however, Mr. C. D.'s presence has very greatly\nhelped the phenomena ; and the advice given so long ago has turned out\nimportant in a way which we could not possibly have foreseen.\n\" On matters not connected with these phenomena I should always care\n\f76 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfully read what the writing told me, but I should not go by it unless it\nseemed sensible. It does not always advise either what I wish or what I\nthink wise ; but generally it is wiser than I.\n\" 7. Medical Advice has often been given by a control calling himself\n' Semirus,' and this has been often successful ; which is strange, since I am\nquite ignorant of medicine, and often do not know the names either of\ndiseases or of drugs mentioned. Of course I cannot be quite sure that I\nhave never read the words, but certainly when I have written them I have\noften not known what they meant.\n\" At other times the facts relating to the illness have been quite outside\nmy knowledge. One friend has given an instance of this kind [printed later] ;\nbut I have not liked to ask others, as what Semirus says is generally meant\nfor the questioner alone.\n\"8. Tlwti\/1ht-traiisference.\u2014The writing occasionally, but not often, tells\nme of thoughts in the minds of persons present. One day a lady handed me\na letter, in a handwriting which I did not know. I held the letter in one hand,\nand the other hand wrote, ' Bright metal and brown earth.' The letter\nwas from a gentleman whom I had never seen, and who committed suicide\nby throwing himself on the rails in front of a railway engine. I think that\nthis message came from thought-transference, as I do not find that merely\nholding letters in my hand tells me anything about their writers unless\nsomeone is there who knows the content ; and even then I so seldom\nsucceed that I do not care to try experiments of this kind.\"\n[Lady Brooke (the Ranee of Sarawak), who was present at the time, has\ngiven me a written confirmation of this (quite recent) incident, for which I\nhave not pressed the owner of the letter, on account of the painful nature\nof the circumstance.\u2014F. W. H. M.]\n\"9. Clairvoyance.\u2014I sometimes get messages which perhaps may be\ncalled clairvoyant, telling me, for instance, where lost objects are, or warn\ning me of some danger at hand. Thus about September 20th, 1888, [this\nincident was written down October 21st, 1889], my sister M. and I had\njust finished dressing for dinner in the dressing-rooms leading from a large\nbedroom. The maid had left the room. M. had left her dressing-room, and\nwas standing in the bedroom, when suddenly she called tc me : ' Get a bit\nof paper; there are some raps.' I came in and took an envelope and\npencil, and at once the words came, by raps : ' Look to the candle or the\nhouse will be on fire.' We saw that it was not the candle in the bedroom, so\nwe went into M. 's dressing-room, and found that her candle was so close\nto a cardboard pocket depending from the looking-glass that it would have\nbeen on fire in a moment. It was already smoking. No servant would have\ncome in for sometime.\" [Mrs. A. confirms as follows: \"I heard of the\nincident in my daughter's next letter.\"]\n\"Again, I was descending a dark corkscrew staircase at Longford, in August\nor September, 1889, [account written October, 1889] when I heard a rapping\non the stair. It was persistent, and drew my attention. I looked about\nwith a candle, and at last saw a gold pencil-case of Lady Radnor's, with\nwhich I was accustomed to write automatically, lying on a dark little landing\nof the stair. I did not know that the pencil had been lost.\n\" 10. But the most puzzling cases are those where the message professes to\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 77\nbe from some departed person, and tells some true things, but perhaps mixes\nup some mistakes with them. ' Jack Creasy ' was a case of that kind. [See\nProceedings, XXIII., p. 513. We have since ascertained that the widow's\nname is not Mary.\u2014F. W. H. M.] I certainly had not read any newspapers\nabout his accident, and had no connection whatever with Greenwich or\nDeptford. I can see no link, and I do not know either why the message\nshould have come at all, or why it should have come so confusedly. But\nsometimes I do think that the message really comes from the person who\nprofesses to communicate.\n\" Another frequent writer is a strange person to have come to us, as I\nknew nothing about him, and should not have thought that we had anything-\nin common. That is Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. He\u2014or whatever it is\nthat takes that name\u2014has become a sort of family friend. He has a distinct\ncharacter of his own, which is not quite what I should have expected in a\nLord Chancellor, for he is full of jokes and very bluff and outspoken. He\nhas given a number of facts about himself, names of friends, and laws about\nmarriage that he had made.\n\"One reason which makes me think that the messages come from out\nside myself is the feeling which I have sometimes of rivalry or even conflict\nbetween them. When I am writing there will occasionally be sudden\nchanges, as if some new personality had been able to get hold of the pencil.\nAnd in one long case [John Black] there seemed to be spirits purposely try\ning to confuse each others' messages ; or perhaps one telling a story and\nothers simply trying to prevent us from hearing it.\n' ' Again, if I see figures and then have writing which professes to come\nfrom those figures, it seems to me natural to suppose that it does so come. \"\nI will now give some examples of motor messages, by writing and raps,\ngiven through Miss A. Here, as in the case of Miss A.'s crystal-visions, I\nam obliged to confine myself mainly to cases corroborated by the few friends\nwho have felt in the messages more than a merely personal interest. It\nmust, of course, be remembered, in justice to other friends, (who have often\ncarried off messages without even showing them to the writer), that much of\nwhat has been thus written has dealt with very private matters.\nThe first message which I shall quote is evidentially interesting, on\naccount of the mere chance by which its truth was verified. It should be\npremised that Miss A. has never been to Blankney, and is not acquainted\nwith the Chaplin family.\nI. Lady Radnor writes under date January 15th, 1893 :\u2014\n\" The following case has always struck me as particularly curious.\n'' About 8years ago, when Miss A.'s powers had only quite recently shown\nthemselves, her automatic writing told me that I had two guides, ' Estelle '\nand 'Silvo,'\u2014spirits who accompanied me and took an interest in my welfare.\nI did not think of this at first as a thing which could be either proved or\ndisproved. But one day, when a question was mooted as to whether ' spirit\nguides' had ever lived on earth, I asked whether mine had done so, and was\ntold that Estelle had. I asked for her earth-name ; and as we were then\ngetting answers by raps (through Miss A.'s power) it was rapped out 'Loved\nvoices called me Anne.' I asked for the surname. C\u2014H\u2014A was rapped out.\n\f78 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nAs my maiden name was Chaplin I at once jumped to the conclusion that\nthat was the name meant. But the raps said decidedly No, and rapped out\nChambers. I had no associations with this name. I asked if connected with\nmy family ? 'Yes.' Any portrait ? ' Yes.' At Blankney i (my brother's\nplace). 'Yes.'\n\" Now I had spent much of my childhood at Blankney, and I had been\nparticularly fond of one picture there, representing a lady whose name I did\nnot know. It used to hang in the morning room, and then on the staircase,\nand represented a lady in a red velvet gown with a. basket of cherries in her\nhand. As a child I used to sit and talk to this picture and make a friend of\nthe lady with the cherries.\n\" So when I heard that the picture of my 'guide ' was at Blankney I hoped\nit might be this lady, and asked, 'Is it the lady with the cherries?' 'Yes'\nwas eagerly rapped out. I at once wrote to my old nurse who was still at\nBlankney, and who knew a good deal about the pictures, and asked her to\nget the picture examined for any name which might be on it. She got the\npicture taken down and carefully examined, but there was no clue. She told\nme, however, that she thought she had heard a Mrs. S.\u2014a connection of the\nfamily, who knew the pictures better than anyone\u2014say that the lady with the\ncherries was a Miss Taylor. This disheartened me ; but I wrote to a friend\nat the College of Heralds to ask whether the name Chambers occurred any\nwhere in the Chaplin pedigree. He wrote back that there was no such name\nin the pedigree.\n\" The same day that I got his letter I happened to meet Mrs. S. (whom I\nhad not seen for many years) in a shop in London. I knew that she had once\nmade a catalogue (which I had never seen) of the Blankney pictures ; so I\nfelt that here was my last chance. I asked her if she knew who the lady\nwith the cherries was. 'Oh, that is Lady Exeter,' she said, 'whose daughter,\nLady Betty Chaplin, married an ancestor of yours. ' ' Do you know what\nLady Exeter's maiden name was ? ' 'It was Mellish. ' I now lost all\nhope, but I just asked : ' Has the name Chambers any association for you ? '\n' How stupid I am ! ' she exclaimed, ' Lady Exeter was a Miss Chambers, of\nMellish ! ' My friend at the Heralds' College then looked in the Exeter\npedigree, and, sure enough, the lady with the cherries was Hannah\nChambers. H. M. Radnor.\"\n\" I was cognisant of all this, and attest the accuracy of the account.\n\"Radnor.\"\nIn a later letter Lady Radnor adds : \" Personally I had always believed\n' the lady with the cherries'to be someone (name unknown) who had married\na Chaplin ancestor. There was no Chaplin pedigree, and it was I who\nsuggested to my brother that he should ask ' York Herald ' (Mr. Gatty) to\ndraw one up ; and I therefore applied to Mr. Gatty as being the only person\nwho would know the names of the families connected by marriage with the\nChaplins. I knew that the great-grandmother was ' Lady Betty, ' ne'e Cecil :\nbut as in those days pedigrees and family history did not interest me, I had\nnever\u2014and up to the present time never have\u2014seen the Chaplin pedigree.\nIn any case the name Chambers would not appear in it.\"\nII. The next case is typical of many similar trifling incidents.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 79\nJanuary lath, 1893.\n\" I have several times had reason to think that some intelligence writing\nthrough Miss A. was aware of trifling circumstances happening to myself.\nA good instance occurred the other day. I came back from hunting and\njoined in a seance, where my so-called ' guide ' was communicating. I\nasked ' Well, have you been with me in my run to-day ? '\n\" 'Yes,' was the answer, 'but you should have gone up the hill instead\nof down.' 'Was Nancy right, then?' 'Yes.' Now, in point of fact we\nhad changed foxes that day by going down a hill instead of up, one hound,\nalone, Nancy, running up hill on what was doubtless the original scent.\n\"Radnor.\"\nJanuary 16ft, 1893.\nIII. \"The following writing was given at Longford, February 27th, 1890,\navowedly by ' Estelle ' :\u2014\n\" ' You ask me whom I see in this habitation. I see so many shades and\nseveral spirits. I see also a good many reflections. Can you tell me if there\nwas a child died upstairs ? Was there an infant who died rather suddenly 1\n[Why ? ] Because I continually see the shadow of an infant upstairs, near\nto the room where you dress. [A shadow?] Yes, it is only a shadow.\n[What do you mean ? ] A shadow is when anyone thinks so continually of a\nperson that they imprint their shadow or memory on the surrounding\natmosphere. In fact they make a form ; and I myself am inclined to think\nthat so-called ghosts, of those who have been murdered, or who have died\nsuddenly, are more often shadows than earthbound spirits ; for the reason\nthat they are ever in the thoughts of the murderer, and so .he creates as\nit were, their shadow or image ; for it would be sad if the poor souls\nsuffered, being killed through no fault of their own,\u2014 that they should be\nearthbound ; though, remember, they very often are earthbound too.'\n\"With reference to the above communication I may say that an infant\nbrother of mine died of convulsions in a nursery which then occupied the\npart of the house where the figure of the baby was said to have appeared.\nI do not see any way in which Miss A. could have known either of the\ndeath of my infant brother or of the fact that that part of the house had\npreviously been a nursery.\nRadnor.\"\nIV. A few further points connected with Longford may conveniently be\nadded here.\nJanuary loth, 1893.\n\" The following point should be added to the account of Miss A.'s vision\nof the Long Drawing-room at Longford as a Chapel, which (as we knew) it\nwas in Lord Coleraine's time, although she had no means of knowing this.\n\" She remarked that there was a door where the altar ought to be (i.e., at\nthe east end), and that there was an altar between two of the side windows,\nwhich she designated. None of us knew at that time where the altar had\nbeen, but later on we found in the muniment-room, (which, of course, is\nalways kept locked), an old plan of Longford, in which the Long Drawing-\nroom is a chapel, and the altar is in precisely the place where Miss A.\nlocated it. This is just like her putting the Cathedral altar in the place in\n\f80 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwhich, unknown to her, it used to be, when she saw the induction of Brian\nDuppa. Radnor. \"\nJanuary Ibth, 1893.\nV. \"It should be added to the account of Brian Duppa that Miss A.\nsubsequently in my presence pointed out to me a portrait, in a room and house\nwhich she had never previously entered, as being the man whom she saw as\nBrian Duppa.1 Although very short-sighted, she recognised the face and\nfigure at a few yards distance. I did not know the picture, and although I\nhave long-sight, I could see no name on it from where we sat. I went up\nand examined it, and found that the name Brian Duppa was on it in small\nletters. H. M. Radnor.\"\nVI. The next case, so far as it goes, supports the view that the \"douser's \"\nwater-finding may be the result of a real motor message from the subliminal\nself ; a thrill passing unconsciously through the organism and acting, by a\ntightening of the muscles, upon the hazel-rod :\u2014\nJanuary loth, 1893.\n\"Feeling some curiosity as to the alleged powers of water-finders or\ndiviners, I recently sent for a man who had much local repute of this kind,\nand set him to find water in the park at Longford. His rod turned up in\nvarious places where there may or may not be water, but when we came to a\nplace where I knew that there was water running through a brick conduit\nunderground, his rod gave no sign. I taxed him with this and he replied\nthat he could not find running water when it was enclosed in a conduit.\nMiss A. was at Longford at the same time, and I asked her to try the rod,\nwhich I myself cut from a hedge. She had never made the attempt before.\nI placed her at some distance from the brick conduit and told her to go on\ntill she came to it. I took care not to give any indication. Exactly at the\nright place the rod turned up. She then followed the hidden conduit ; when\never she stepped off it the rod went down. Lady Radnor then tried her in\nthe Castle itself. She went into the central hall, which had been the court\nyard. In one corner the rod went up strongly, having been going up a little\nbefore. In my memory a pump had stood there ; but no one in the house,\nexcept myself and my aunt, knew of the existence of this old well.\n\" Radnor.\"\nVII. The following statement is from the Ran6e of Sarawak :\u2014\nJanuary, 1893.\n\"In September, 1892, my maid, who was not known to Miss A., complained\nof persistent pain in the neck and arm. She told me afterwards that she\nhad been afraid of paralysis. I asked Miss A. to let ' Semirus ' write\nwhat was the matter with her. The maid came into the room. No one\nsaid a word as to her symptoms, but Miss A.'s hand at once wrote in\n'Semirus\" handwriting: ' It is not paralysis, as you fear ; it is rheumatism ;\nyour bed ought to be moved from the window,' or words to that effect.\nI went into the maid's room, which it so happened that I had never seen, as.\nit was in a house which I had only rented for a short time, and I found in\n1 Her words were : \" Oh, thereis my Bishop 1 only his hair was brown and in thi\u00bb\npicture it is grey-\"\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 81\nfact that the bed was exposed to a severe draught. It was placed against\nthe window. I had it moved, and the rheumatic pain disappeared.\nMargaret Brooke.\"\nVIII. I give here an incident of which I was myself witness, and which\nseems to me typical of a class of communications of which I have already said\nsomething,\u2014where information unknown to the automatist is given, on the\nsoi-dutant authority of some departed spirit ; but yet this information, so far\nas true, is known to some person present, and when anything which goes\nbeyond the knowledge of persons present is asked for, the answer goes off into\nmere guessing and vagueness. Note also the fact that these messages were\ngiven by a distinct rapping sound in the table. This phenomenon is often\nspoken of in spiritist journals as a very common one. For myself I may say\nthat having sat at tobies many hundred times, in readiness to welcome raps if\nthey appeared, I have frequently heard raps in the presence of paid mediums,\nand I have frequently heard creaks of the table in the presence of my\nown friends ; but only in the presence of some four or five non-profes\nsional and trustworthy persons have I heard unmistakable raps, answering\nquestions, and producing upon my mind the conviction that no known agency\nwas concerned in producing them.\nOn this occasion the messages given were private enough to need an\nalteration in the initials of the friends present. Besides Miss A., a sister,\nand myself, there sat at the table Lady B. and the Hon. C. D. A Christian\nname was clearly rapped out, which was recognised by Mr. C. D. as that of\nhis mother, not consciously known to any of the rest of us. Since, however,\nthe name was in the Peerage, it was of little evidential value. A message then\ncame as to Mr. C. D. 's efforts on behalf of a friend, for whom he was then\ntrying to get a post. \"What kind of employment shall I get for him?\"\n\" Island.\" \" What island ? \" \"Jersey.\" \" Can you mention anyone who will\nhelp in this ? \" \" Lang \" was rapped out, and then came many confused raps\nand the message ceased.\nNow Mr. D. was in reality trying privately to get a post in Jersey for his\nfriend,\u2014about whom none of us knew anything. How easy, therefore, it\nwould be to report this sitting as follows : \" Mr. D.'s mother announced her\nself by raps, and gave advice on a private matter.\"\nBut now compare the classical case, if I may so term it, of the Rev. P.\nand Mrs. Newnham, and consider how these replies might be explained on the\ntheory of mere thought-transference between living persons. In Mr.\nNewnham's case we found that the automatic writing got at the questioner's\nideas gradually and imperfectly, and filled up gaps by random answers made\nto look as interesting as possible. So here, in my view, some intelligence\nnot necessarily other than some part of Miss A. 's subliminal self readily\ndiscerns in Mr. D. 's mind an idea so firmly fixed as his mother's name, and\ntakes that as an interesting source to which to ascribe the replies. It next\ngets easily at the idea of helping the friend ; but the definite name Jersey is\nharder to come at, and is preceded by island, a reply which could hardly\nhave been given save by someone groping for the clearer notion. Then\nwhen the name of some helpful resident in Jersey is asked for\u2014Mr. D.\nhimself now not knowing any such name\u2014an attempt is made to rap out\nthe name which is in most minds the first which the idea of Jersey would call\na\n\f82 Mr. F. W. E. Myers.\nup. Senseless as this guess was, (for Mr. D. certainly did not expect Mrs.\nLangtry to find posts for his friends), it was quite analogous to the random,\ndreamlike associations and plays upon words which are characteristic of\nsubliminal messages of all kinds.\nThe next question, again, received an answer which might have been\ncredited to clairvoyance. Mr. C. D. handed Miss A. a ring (not that I\nsee reason to suppose that the ring made any difference) and simply said, \"Tell\nme about my friend now at a hotel in Paris, with whom this ring is\nconnected.\" Immediately raps spelt out the sentence, \" Case for operation.\"\nA few details of the disease were then given, which corresponded with what\nMr. C. D. knew, and which, where they went beyond his knowledge, admitted\nof no proof.\nI can hardly myself doubt that this knowledge also came from Mr. C. D.'s\nmind, and not (as is usually professed in such cases) from actual inspection\nof the patient.\nIt may, of course, be asked why experiments like this, which, even if\nthey prove nothing more than thought-transference, do at least seem to\nprove that so definitely, are not constantly repeated. The answer is that\nthere are very few persons with whom they can be repeated ; and that Mr.\nC. D.'s personality was in this case probably as essential as Miss A.'s. Mr.\nD., though he cannot by himself obtain raps, has marked power of a psychical\nkind, and is in fact the gentleman to whom Miss A. has above alluded as\nhaving been demanded by her guides before she or her family knew any\nthing of him beyond official mentions of his name in the papers. I can my\nself vouch for the recurring scrawls, \"Bring C. D.\"\u2014\"Bring C. D.\" which\npuzzled the A. family some six years ago, when they certainly were not\naware of Mr. D. 's gift (then very slightly developed), and when it had not\nconsciously occurred to myself that good might result from the collocation\nof the two sources of power.\nIX. The next case which I shall give is a curious one, as involving (1)\nrapB, (2) a crystal-vision, (3) an apparition seen by two persons, viz., Miss A.\nherself and Mr. Harry de Windt, well known as a traveller in Russia. Un\nfortunately no notes were taken, but I heard of the incident a few weeks\nafterwards from Lady Brooke, Mr. C. D., Mrs. A. and Miss A. (all present\nat the time), and a letter from Mr. de Windt confirms two of the main\npoints.\nIn September, 1892, on the occasion of the first meeting of Mr. de\nWindt and Miss A., the latter wrote the word Doishowalinksky, which at\nfirst was thought to be a sentence, but turned out to be a name well known\nto Mr. de Windt.\nOn the same day a face appeared near Mr. C. D. which was clearly\nseen by Miss A. and Mr. de Windt, and recognised by the latter, as stated\nin a letter to me, dated October 5th, 1892: \"I can only tell you that I\ndistinctly saw the face of an exile I am acquainted with, one Dombrowski,\nwho is (or was) located at Tomsk, in Western Siberia. A message was also\nsent me \" [from a Russian source ; but Mr. de Windt explains the inexpe-\ndience of printing further particulars of this].\nMiss A., on being afterwards shown a photograph of Dombrowski (not,\nhowever, mixed with other photographs, as it should have been), recognised it,\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 83\nbut said that the face as seen by her looked older and more worn ; in which\nMr. de Windt concurred. It is not known whether Dombrowski is dead\nor alive.\nOn the same day Miss A. , looking in the crystal, saw a small man with\nbright red hair and red face, a big stick, a long petticoat, and a fur cap,\nwalking in front of a little hut. Mr. de Windt recognised this figure .is\nresembling a hill-man set to watch an isolated prisoner. These stunted hill-\nmen dye their hair with red clay.\nA few days later (September 15th, 1892) a message was given by raps to\nLady Brooke (the Rane'e) : \" Tell your brother (Mr. de Windt) that Shiskine\nis the man to help him.\" Neither Miss A. nor Mr. de Windt had ever con\nsciously heard of Shiskine, but in the St. James's Gazette of September 24th\nthey observed that M. Shiskine had received a certain high appointment,\nwhich explained the message. His appointment had also been mentioned\nin the Times of August 31st. It is, of course, possible that subliminal\nmemory may externalise itself by raps, as by other means.\nX. Among the habitual \"controls,\" \"Lord Chancellor Hardwicke\"is\nalmost the only one of sufficient historical mark to admit of our testing\nthe truth of his statements. He gave a list of the surnames of sixteen of\nhis friends ; and Miss Porter has been good enough to identify with proba\nbility most of these. Most of the names (though not all) appear in Harris's\nLife of Lord Hardtncke ; but in several cases there are reasons, not apparent\nin the Life, which make it probable that there was more intimacy than\nthe incidental mention in the Life would imply. The case resembles the\nbiographies of musicians written automatically by Mr. Stainton Moses (see\nSpirit Identity), which I hope to discuss on some later opportunity. The\ntone of boisterous humour which runs through these messages is unlike Miss\nA., but it must be remembered that in the \" objectivation of types\" so\noften obtained by hypnotic suggestion, a part quite alien to the hypnotised\nsubject's character is often surprisingly well maintained.\nXI. I will close this series for the present with a case which unites all the\nperplexities of these inquiries in a singularly tangled form. According as\nstress is laid on one or other of its aspects it may be regarded as one of the\nweakest or as one of the strongest items of our present evidence. Against\nit are the broad facts that the central story, if central story there be, never\ngot itself told at all ; that there were numerous inaccuracies in the fragmen\ntary stories which teere told ; and that these included an impossible incident\n(the experience of John Black, as I shall call him, in the hospital) which\npoints to an intentional mystification.\nIn favour of the case is, first of all, the fact that the communications do\nnot depend upon any one person. They are shared by Miss A. with four\nother members of her family, and with the gentleman here called Mr. B.,\nwho is known to me, and whom I regard as an excellent witness, although\nfor official reasons, which seem to me adequate, he wishes his name to be\nconcealed.\nThen again, we have the several mutually corroborative forms in which\nthe message was conveyed, raps\u2014sounds, visions, and writing. And finally,\nbesides the inaccurate or incredible statements, and closely mixed up with\nthese, we have a considerable number of facta accurately given, and these\nG 2\n\f84 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfacts of the oddest character. The impression left upon those who took part\nin these sittings was that they had here a fragmentary message, confused\nby the very conditions of its transmission, and its confusion worse confounded\nby some perverse or hostile agency ; but, nevertheless, reflecting certain true\nfacts, known to one or more minds altogether distinct from those of the\ngroup who received the communications.\nThe account here quoted was written partly by Mr. B., and partly by\nmembers of the A. family who were present.\nlie John [Black]\u2014Gertrude Tryon.\nOn Sunday, December 15th, 1889, while in church at morning service,\nMiss A. and B. saw among other things a form in the pulpit, dressed in some\nthing dark. We had some writing and were told that if we had a sitting that\nevening the man would try and show himself and tell us what he wanted,\nand that he had appeared in church to attract our notice. [Mr. B. tells me\nthat he has many times seen, as he believes, quite independently, the same\nphantasmal figures which Miss A. has at the same time seen. \u2014F. W. H. M.]\nAt 6.30 p.m. we sat round a strong square table in a darkened room, and\nloud raps began almost at once. Very shortly Miss A. saw the figure of a\nman lying on an ordinary hospital stretcher, and what appeared to be his\ndouble standing beside it. B. at the same time saw the standing figure.\nBy loud raps we were told that his name was J. [Black].\nRaps then continued : \" Water-lane, Brixton.\"\nQuestion : \" What number ? \" Answer : \" Kendal Villas,\"and then \"2.\"\nMiss A. now saw sort of magic lantern pictures at the end of the room, of\na station, lights, trains, &c.\nA low indistinct voice now began to speak, but we could not make out\nwhat it said.\nThe raps now continued, and in spite of great interruptions by the voice,\nwe made out the following :\u2014\n\" Once dead through concussion of spine. St. Bartholomew's.\"\nDuring this time the figure kept making signs of approval when his\nraps were understood, and a very cold air blew at intervals over our hands.\nAt about this time we noticed another figure between Miss A. and B.,\nevidently the one who was speaking so indistinctly that we could only make\n\" Yes \" or \" No \" at times of what he said.\nQuestion : \" What can we do for you ? \"\nAnswer : \" Ask Gertrude for the \" (we fancied \" will \").\nQ. : \" Does Gertrude live at Kendal Villas ?\" A. : \" No.\"\nQ. : \" Do you know where she lives ? \" A. : \"Ask Dr. Fyfe to help.\"\nQ. : \" Can you give us Gertrude's address ? \" A.: \"No.\"\nQ. : \"Can you give us Dr. Fyfe's address?\" A.: \" Montpellier-square.\"\nQ. : \" Can you tell us the number 1\" A. : \"Yes \" (we counted and they\nstopped us at 4, and again at 2), \" 42.\"\nThis conversation was rendered very difficult in places by the voice\ninterrupting, especially at the number of Dr. Fyfe's house. After this the\nraps became so weak that it was suggested that the figure should make a\nsign at the right letter, and this was carried out. A little diificulty was\nexperienced at first, but finally with some occasional raps the conversation\nrecommenced.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 85\nQ. : \" What was Gertrude's other name ? \"\nThe voice said \"Tryon\" and the hand waved approval.\nQ. : \"When did you die?\"\nA. : \"January 13th \"(we gathered). \"It was I that forgot Gertrude\nwhen I had the accident. Pray find Gertrude and give her money to\nlive on. \"\nQ. : \" Where did you see Gertrude last 1 \" A. : \" Richmond.\"\nWe had here to stop, as it was late. After the sitting, on looking in\na Blue-book we found the name and address: \"Andrew Fyfe, M.D.,\nM.R.C.S., 42, Montpellier-square, S.W.\" [Dr. Fyfe is, of course, in no\nway connected with this inquiry, into which he enters only as responding\nwith prompt courtesy to questions about a patient.]\nAt the same table, about 9 p.m. on December 18th, raps again began,\nbut there seemed a great many different influences, all wishing to commu\nnicate. The same figure appeared, and after a few minutes was able to rap\nand sign to us, but throughout there was great difficulty.\nJ. [Black] said: \"I want to tell you all, help me.\" We tried then to\nmake out on what line of railway he was travelling but could only make out\nthe following words :\u2014\nQ. : \" What was the accident ? \"\nA. : \"Train\u2014collision\u2014Victoria\u2014station near.\"\nQ. : \" Where were you coming from 1 \" A. : \"Richmond.\"\nQ. : \" Did Dr. Fyfe help you then 1 \"\nA. : \"No\u2014Symons\u2014in accident too.\"\nQ. : \" What do you want us to do for Gertrude ? \"\nA : \"I owe her money. You must tell Dr. Fyfe to tell you that address,\nhe knows it. I owed her money, and ask if I left a letter about Gertrude.\"\nQ. : \" How much did you owe her ? \" and we thought the answer was \u00a35.\nHe then said, \" Write to Kendal Villas.\"\nQ. : \"What is the name of the person who lives there now.\" A. : \" [Black.]\"\nQ. : \" What relation to you ? \"\nA. : \" Wife\"\u2014we suggested widow\u2014\" No, wife.\"\nThe voice then got stronger a great deal and distinctly said :\u2014-\n\" It is all quite right. Look for accidentJanuary 1st or December 31st.\nDuring this sitting we had a paper and pencil on the table, hoping for\nsome direct writing, and we heard them moved about several times. We\nasked if there was anything on the paper and the voice said, \" Ernest has\nwritten.\" We then struck a light and found written on the paper \" J. [B] .\"\nThe voice before we finished said, \" I am George Smith, and am trying to\nhelp: thank you. Going to write.\"\nThe guides wrote through Miss A. that George Smith was not a bad\nspirit, though not very high ; that he had known J. [Black] and was anxious\nto help him. They also said they fancied Gertrude Tryon was drowned, and\nthat she went to see Dr. Fyfe, either in November or December, 1888, by\nJ. [Black's] wish ; that she did not pay him, but gave him her address.\nWishing to follow this out, a telegram was sent to the London police\nasking for news of J. [Black] and the following answer was received :\u2014\n\" Brixton. Head Constable. December 19th, 1889.\n\"John [Black] has been stopping at 2, Kendal Villas, Water-lane.\n\f86 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nMarried Miss [W.J occupier's daughter, Sunday last. Expected home next\nSunday. Present address unknown.\"\nOn December 20th a file of the Times was obtained and the following\naccount of a railway accident on December 31st, 1888, was found in it :\u2014\nCopied from the Times of January 1st, 1889:\u2014 . . . \"The worst\ncase was that of a Mr. [Black] of Brixton, who received such serious injuries\nthat the doctor ordered his immediate removal to a hospital. He was\naccordingly placed in a police ambulance, and this was put in the guard's van\nof a train bound for the City. Mr, [Black] was taken to St. Bartholomew's\nHospital, where he now lies.\" . . . The paragraph stated that the collision\nwas between a L.C. and D. train in Loughborough Junction, going to\nVictoria, and a L. and S.W. train from Richmond. A Dr. Simonds\nattended the injured.\nA telegram was then sent to the house surgeon, St. Bartholomew's\nHospital, and the following reply received :\u2014\n\" [Black] left 11th January.\"\nOn the evening of December 21st we received the following communica\ntion, partly by raps and partly by voice, the voice being stronger than\nbefore :\u2014\n\"The real J. [Black] is here ; this is me.\" \"On January 7th, I was com\npelled to leave the body of J. [Black].' \" J. [Black], my body was entered,\ninto by another.\" \"I now am bodiless, do you not understand?\" \"I and\nhe are one.\" \"Two in one body.\" \"I married Gertrude Tryon.\" \"Not\nthe other.\" \"Yes, yes, help me\u2014help me to make you understand.\"\nQ. : \" Were you married in church to Gertrude Tryon ? \"\nA. : \"No I promised to marry her in January.\" \"I will, I must get\nhelp.\" We had said : \" How can you make us understand what it is yon\nwant?\" \"I was insensible for seven days, and when I came to myself I\nsaw just the other in my body ; I could not get back, so have no power to\nfulfil my promise.\"\nQ. : \" Can't you influence him (J. [Black] ), or get back into his body ? \"\nA. : \"I can when he is terribly excited. I implore you to help me.\"\nQ. : \" Why are you so anxious about Gertrude ? \"\nA. : \"She was an orphan, I used to meet her in Richmond Park. I\npromised to meet her on New Year's Day.\"\nQ. : \" Was she a lady?\"\nA. : \" No, she was a ' dancer ' at Liverpool ; a ' dancer ' is a worker in the\nmills. \"\nQ. : \" Can you tell us the name of the mill ? \"\nA. : \" Darlings, I think, cannot be sure.\"\nQ. : \" What was her address in Richmond ? \"\nA. : \"I think that she had lodgings in Castle-street.\"\nQ. : \"What number?\" A. : \"17.\"\nQ. : \" What is it you want us to do for her i \"\nA. : \" You must, when you find her, place her somewhere ; she has no\nfriends, and it is my fault.\"\nOn the evening of December 22nd, at a sitting, by raps we were told :\n\"I must give an address for George Smith. Gertrude Tryon was at Bold-\nstreet, Liverpool.\"\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 87\nQ. : \" Can you give us the number ? \" A.: \"No.\"\nQ. : \" Will you tell us more? \" A. : \" Public-house\u2014barmaid.\"\nA letter received on December 26th says:\u2014\n\" The principal street for shops is called Bold-street.\"\n\"42, Montpellier-square, S.W., December 26th, 1889.\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014I remember the name Tryon, I fancy, but I cannot see it in\nour books. I will have another look, however, through the day-book for\nNovember and December, 1888, to-morrow, and let you know. There are\nseveral names of [Black] in the book. Can you tell me where he lived 1\n\" Believe me, yours very truly, Andrew Fyfe.\"\nDecember 28tfi,1889.\u2014During the afternoon E. saw in the crystal a small\nroom, with only two chairs in it and torn curtains. In it was a young\nwoman, with a dark dress and dark hair, sitting with her back towards the\nseer. She was sitting on one chair with her feet on the other, in a very\ndejected attitude, and the following letters came \" G. H. T. o [Black].\"\nAfter dinner that evening, among other things, a mist suddenly seemed\nto us to form, and in it Miss A. saw the form of a young woman, dripping\nwith water, with her hair, which was long and black, hanging over one\nshoulder, and the whole circle was startled by the most distressing moans.\nThe voice said then : \"I am Gertrude Tryon, and I want to talk to you.\nI threw myself into the water.\" Q. : \"Was it in Richmond Park 1 \"\nA.: \"About Richmond.\"\nQ. : \" Was it in the river 1\" A. : \"Yes.\"\nQ. : \" Can you give us the date V A. : \" September 17th, 1889.\"\nThe figure which answered these questions and still had kept moving,\nthen faded away.\nDecember 29th, 1889.\u2014At a sitting after tea, towards the end of the time,\nwhen we had had several other messages and a few words of direct writing,\nraps, and voices, the spirit who gives the name of George Smith came. He\nsaid : \"J. [Black] will try and come but I will not let him ; I will make a\nform.\" Then we saw a kind of indistinct mask or face on the table which\nG. S. was evidently trying to make.\nQ. : \" Was what Gertrude Tryon told us last night correct 1 \"\nA. : \" Yes, she is near, I can ask her questions.\"\nQ. : \" Are you dead ?\" A. : \" Yes.\"\nQ. : \" What were you ?\" A. : \" Ostler, Richmond.\"\nQ. : \" Whereabouts in Richmond ? \" A.: \" Castle Hotel.\"\nQ. : \" Do you know if there was any account of Gertrude Tryon's\nsuicide ?\"\nA. : \" There was a notice in the Star, I think.\"\nQ. : \" Can you tell us what date ? \"\nA. : \"Not certainly, but I think September 19th.\"\nQ. : \" Is it the woman whose body was found in the Thames ? \"\nHere the answers became rather involved and we could not make out if\nhe was speaking of Gertrude Tryon or someone else.\nA. : \"I can tell you who made (did ? ) it ; she threw herself in and Long\nJack pulled her out. He took her to Bermondsey and from there to Chelsea ;\nfrom there I cannot trace her, and that was early in September.\"\nQ. : \" Was she alive, or did he take her body 1\"\n\f88 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nA. : \"(Alive) first ; the 17th September was killed.\"\nHere we had to leave off.\nWe had a sitting on the 31st, and after other things by the crystal and\nraps we got this message : \" Will you be careful of what G. Smith tells you ?\nhe is not the best of spirits, he is one who knows more of G. Tryon than\nanyone else ; it will not be any use for him to try to deceive you for you\nwill find him out ; we are afraid that Long Jack is only an alias of G. Smith.\"\nOn sending to Richmond to know if there is a Castle Hotel, we learn\nthat there was one, but it has been pulled down.\nOn January 1st got another answer from Dr. Fyfe.\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014I have looked carefully through our books for November\nand December, but I cannot see the name of Gertrude Tryon ; I remember\nthe name Tryon, but a number of patients used to come to me whose names\nwere not mentioned in the books afterwards. If you could give me any\nfurther particulars of her and [Black], I should be only too glad to try and\ntrace them.\n\" December 30th, 1889. \"Andrew Fyfe.\"\nOn January 3rd, when C. and Miss A. had gone up to bed, Miss A. had\nloud raps in her room, and going to C.'s room tried to write but could get\nnothing, so sat at a little table. This message was rapped out: \"Willow-\nwalk, Bermondsey.\"\nQ. : \" Who are you ? \" A. : \" Gertrude Tryon. \"\nQ. : \" What do you want to say ? \" A.: \"Baker met .\"\nHere the raps broke off and we could get no more.\nOn January 4th, we heard from Liverpool :\u2014\n\"Sir,\u2014I have to acknowledge the receipt of your inquiry of the 2nd,\nand to inform you that there is no hotel or public-house in Bold-street, and\nour directory gives no manufacturer or mill-owner of the name of Darling.\nBy the enclosed circular you will see we are precluded from making any\ninquiry.\u2014I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\nOn January 5th were told by \"writing\": \"You must remember that\nin all communications there are those who try and tell you exactly oppo\nsite from what they ought, to try to stop you from finding out the truth ;\nkeep everything, it will do more good in proving that you get false and\ntrue. There are two sides to every question, but you need not think that\nbecause all is not to be found out directly there is not the whole truth at\nthe bottom.\"\nOn January 7th, after tea, B. and Miss A. took a small table, placing the\ncrystal on it. First was seen in the crystal a cart with two men and a\nwoman (G. T.) in it ; the man who was sitting between the driver and the\nwoman was clean shaven and had a dark blue cap on. They seemed to be\ndriving through a square and along a narrow street, into what we were told\n(by raps) was Willow-walk. The cart stopped next door to an arch ; G. T.\nwent in through the door. By raps we then got, \"Baker is shortly out\nof prison.\" Then again in the crystal, G. T. appeared to be sitting at\nthe back of a large yard full of carts, as if she were hiding. The entrance\nseemed to be through the archway. Then was rapped out twice, \" Stores in\n(i\n\"G. Williams\n(Chief Superintendent).\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 89\nWillow-walk.\" Then two tin canisters appeared in the crystal, held in\nsomeone's hand, and the words \"Baker stole \" were rapped out. Then we\nasked some questions and were answered by raps :\u2014\nQ. : \"Who is Baker?\"\nA. : \"Baker was in prison for stealing ; he knows about G. Tryon.\"\nQ. : \" How does that help us 1 \"\nA. : \" Ask anyone who lives in Willow-walk if they know about Baker\nwho was found stealing.\"\nQ. : \" How long ago 1 \" A. : \" Not sure\u2014about four months perhaps.\"\nQ. : \"But still how will that help us ? \"\nA. : \"It gives you a clue, but be very careful if you talk to Baker; he\nwill not let you know he knows, he will hide it.\"\nQ. : \" Where was Baker ? \" (or, where did he steal).\nA.: \" Van depository in Willow-walk. \"\nThe following is a description of Gertrude Tryon as she appeared in the\ncrystal, also at the sitting :\u2014Very nice looking, pale complexion, dark eyes,\nblack hair brushed off the face ; very straight features ; rather long face\nwith scar over right eye ; plain gold rings in her ears ; hands long and thin ;\nprobably left-handed ; in the crystal was seen with black stuff dress, black\nbuttons, and steel centres.\n(While we were writing out this description directly after we had got it,\nthere were loud thuds on the screen behind us, and a noise as if someone\nwere talking far away, heard by all in the room ; also loud knocks the other\nside of the room.)\nWe have found that there is a Willow-walk, Bermondsey, and also there\nis a Pickford's van depository in Willow-walk.\nOn writing to Richmond for the first three weeks' local papers in Septem\nber, all were sent up to the 15th or 16th by Edward King. On writing\nagain for the 17th and 18th, the dates required, the following answer came\nback from Edward King: \"We regret we have no papers for the dates\nyou refer to.\" We sent for the Star evening paper of these dates, and they\nwere also out of print.\nWe learn on inquiry that there are two Bakers among a gang of burglars ;\none is caught and the other still at large.\nOn January 30th, a letter came from a friend who was making inquiries\nas follows :\u2014\n\" A detective came here yesterday with information from Scotland Yard\nabout Baker ; he was, it appears, employed on the railway and was convicted\nnot long since of stealing a can of milk, somewhere in Willow-walk, Ber\nmondsey, and is still undergoing his months' L. H. L. \"\nOn February 15th, 1890, Miss A. and B. again obtained the following\nanswers to questions, sitting at a small table alone, and the communications\ncoming from George Smith :\u2014\n\" That man that knows about Gertrude Tryon. I want to find one called\nSayce, he was with Gertrude ; find him ; he was with her in Liverpool.\"\nQ. : \" Where is he to be found ? \"\nA. : \" He was last in Pentonville-street, N.W.\"\nQ. : \" What had he to do with Gertrude ? \"\nA : \"He worked with her.\"\n\f90 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nQ. : \"Where?\"\nA. : \" Bar in pastry-cook's shop in Bold-street, Liverpool.\"\nQ. : \"What isthe name of the shop?\" A. (after much trouble): \"Howard.\"\nAbout 3 a.m. on the night of the 15th February, 1890, Miss A. was\nawakened by rapping and shaking at the end of her bed on the wood. She\nasked who was there ?\nA. : \" George Smith. I will tell truth; listen.

A. sat at a small table, and got\nthe following by raps :\u2014\nQ. : \" What are we to do about this case ? \"\nA. : \" You must try to find the body\u2014read sen-ice.\"\nQ. : \" WasG. T. drowned?\"\nA. : \"No, she was murdered.\"\nQ. : \" Tell us what to do to find her.\"\nA. : \" She never came from Bermondsey.\"\nQ. : \" Who murdered her ? \"\nA. : \"George Smith.\"\nQ. : \" AVill you tell us how and where G. S. died ?\"\nA. : \"Yes, though I will not pretend to know the name of the vessel ;\nhe went to Liverpool,\u2014 to the docks, and got a place on board ship. I only\nknow he was brought before the highest tribunal\u2014God's. \"\nQ. : \" Can you tell us where G. T.'s body is ? \"\nA. : \"Willow-walk\u2014in a shed\u2014stable\u2014near vans ; Pickford's yards.\"\nOn March 14th, 1890 (Friday), Miss A. went with a friend to Willow-\nwalk, Bermondsey. After walking nearly down the whole street without\nfinding anything like what she had seen, she suddenly recognised the grocery\nstores she had seen in the crystal. She could not find the archway, but went\nstraight into the yard where Pickford keeps his vans and packs ; and after\ngoing some way she found the archway she had seen close by the loading-\nplace, and recognised it as having seen it in the crystal.\nOn March 25th, B., Miss A., and A. W. sat at a small table, and got\nthe following communications by raps :\u2014\n\" E. (Emily ? ) Joyce must be found.\"\nQ. : \" Where does she live ? \"\nA. : \" She lived last in Wimpole-street as caretaker.\"\nQ. : \" What number ? \" A. : \"39.\"\nQ. : \" Who was she caretaker to ? \"\nA. : \" Charwoman also at the church.\"\n\fThe Subliminal Comciomness. 91\nQ. : \" Where is the church 1 \" A. : \" Raine-street.\"\n(Here George Smith came and interrupted and had to be sent away.)\nQ. : \" Where is Raine-street ? \"\nA. : \"E.C. Chap. Little Bethel.\"\nThey could then get no more, so left off. Miss A. sat down to write out\nwhat had been given, and the raps continued on the writing table. \"You\nwill find E. Joyce by applying to rooms, Whitecross Mission, Upper Nine.\"\nOn sending for a P.O. Directory it was found that there is a mission\nroom at 199, Upper Whitecross-street.\nOn March 31st, 1890, B. and Miss A. sat at a small table and got the\nfollowing by raps :\u2014\n\" From Gertrude Tryon. I must find rest. Murder it was ; my body\nlies there\u2014the river\u2014and I was made to put the child's body in the yard ;\nit is there now.

John [Black's] accident and illness.\nWe owe to the kindness of the Surgical Registrar of St. Bartholomew's\nthe following copy of an entry in Case-book of patients under Mr. Morrant\nBaker, 1888 :\u2014\n\" December 31st, 1888. 3856. John [Black], aet. 21, safe-maker. He was\nin train which collided with another on day of admission. Insensible for\nsome time, but not when he came in. Came in suffering from shock and\npains in the head.\"\nMr. Black had moved from the address which was correctly given by\nraps in the case above cited ; but Dr. A. T. Myers, after some difficulty,\nsucceeded in interviewing him at his new home on February 25th, 1893,\nand reports thus as to the effects of the accident.\n\" He looked about 25 or 26 years of age. The eyeballs were slightly\nprominent, the pupils regular, equal, rather smaller than normal. He said\nhe had never quite got over the accident. Since then he had been somewhat\nan altered man. He had had to do lighter work than that of a safe-maker,\nwhich was his business at the time of the accident. He had headaches at\ntimes and his sight was not so clear as before the accident. He remembered\nvery little of the accident, or of the days he spent in hospital. He said in\nreply to my questions that he did not suffer from walking or talking in his\nsleep. He was very little inclined to be communicative, and in fact, rather\nsuspicious as to the reasons of my visit. \"\nIt thus appears that [Black's] case was somewhat more severe than the\nfirst account indicated, and that there was a period of unconsciousness.\n2. Upper Whitecross-street. Mr. G. A.Smith reports (May 28th, 1890) :\u2014\n\" I went to this street, which has recently been renumbered, and what was\n\f92 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n199 is now 98 and 99. I find that up to April in this year a mission was\ncarried on at 199, but after that month it moved to large premises built on\npurpose in Errol-street. The missionary in Errol-street assured me that no\nMrs. Joyce had ever been connected with them in any way.\"\n3. Crane-court. No chemist's shop in Crane-court, Fleet-street.\n4. Raine-street. This street is now E.G., but E. runs from Old Gravel-\nlane, Wapping. A church in Old Gravel-lane, a few yards before one gets\nto Raine-street.\nIt is not easy to frame a hypothesis which will account for such\na case as this, with its odd fragments of knowledge or vision, and the\ndream-like vagueness and shadowiness of the story which connects\nthem. It is like a collective dream,\u2014for be it remembered that the per-\ncipience here is shared by several persons,\u2014working upon a foundation\nof facts, some of which may perhaps be referred to the latent memory of\nsome of the persons concerned. At any rate the reader can hardly be\ntoo often reminded that this hypothesis of subliminal memory must be\nkept closely in view in considering all retroeognitive messages.\nI proceed to quote a series of messages which afford an interesting\nfield for the discussion of that hypothesis. The automatist, who\nmust here be called Mrs. R., is a lady well known to me for some\nyears, and to whom I was first introduced by Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood\n(the cousin and brother-in-law of Charles Darwin, and himself a well-\nknown savant), who has here reported certain messages obtained in his\npresence, and partly through his co-operation. Mrs. R., and her sister\nMrs. V., now deceased, were for many years among Mr. Wedgwood's\nmost valued friends. There can be no more question in my mind as to\nMrs. R.'s scrupulous good faith than as to that of Mr. Wedgwood him\nself in endeavouring to recall the utmost that they hod ever known of\nthe personages who professed to be writing through the help of the two\nhuman hands. The question is one of subliminal memory ; and as to\nthis it may be remarked that Mr. Wedgwood's reading was wide,\u2014but\nthat he never, so far as I know, showed any automatic gift, nor ob\ntained writing except with one of these two ladies. On the other\nhand, Mrs. R.'s residing has not been wide in range ; and both Mrs. R.\nand Mrs. V. had many psychical experiences,\u2014most of them of a private\nnature,1\u2014in which Mr. Wedgwood was not concerned. The automatic\nimpulse seems to have come from tliem ; but it may be that Mr. Wedg\nwood's presence modified the character of the messages obtained. I\ngive first a general account by Mr. Wedgwood of the mode of experi\nment.\nMy experience in planchette-writing has been mainly acquired in sitting\nwith two sisters, whom I will call Mrs. R. and Mrs. V., of whom the\nyounger, Mrs V., has far the stronger influence in producing the writing.\n1 See, however, S.P.R. Journal, Vol. IV., p. 293, for two experiences of Mrs. V.'s.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 93\nWith her the board in general begins to move much sooner and in a more\nvivacious way than with her elder sister. When the two sit together the\nboard moves rapidly along, like a person writing as fast as he can drive,\nwhile with me and one of the sisters the action is often feeble and labouring.\nBut neither of the sisters can obtain anything whatever when they sit by\nthemselves. The board remains absolutely motionless under the hands of\nthe solitary operator.\nWhen trying for writing we sit opposite each other at a small table, I with\nmy right hand, my partner with her left on the planchette, while the writing\nproduced is upright to me, and upside down to my partner, from whom,\nhowever, the effective influence seems to proceed. The precise nature of\nthat influence is not very easy to understand, and is, I think, very\ncommonly misapprehended. Writing by planchette is often called\n\"automatic,\" and the pencil is conceived as being worked by the muscular\naction of the sitters, under the guidance of a blind impulse, as little under\nstood by them as the finished result is foreseen by a pair of birds instinc\ntively engaged in the construction of their first nest. But this is directly\nopposed to the experience of myself and my partners. When I am sitting at\nplanchette with one of them, I hunv that I am merely following the move\nment of the board with my hand, and not in any way guiding it, my only\ndifficulty being to avoid interfering with it. It seems to me exactly as if my\npartner, in whom I have perfect confidence, was purposely moving the board\nand I allowing my hand to follow her action, interfering with it as\nlittle as possible. And she gives to me an exactly corresponding account of\nher own share in the operation. Thus we give to the outside world our\nunited testimony of a fact which, as far as each of us is concerned, lies with\nin our own direct knowledge, viz. , that the writing traced out by the pencil\nis not produced by the muscular exertion of either of us.\nWe have, then, in planchette-writing, if our account is to be believed, the\nmanifestation of an agency invisible to us, yet capable of moving the bodily\npencil either in mere scribbling or in such a way as to fix an intelligent mes\nsage on the paper.\nThe first case which I shall give is in the words of Mr. Wedgwood,\nin the Journal for December, 1889.\nM. Aut. 673.\nWhenever I have an opportunity, perhaps once or twice a year, I sit at\nplanchette-writing with my friend, whom I will call Mrs. R., a most obser\nvant witness in whom I have entire confidence. We sit opposite each other\nat a small table, each resting the fingers of one hand lightly upon the board,\nand when the board begins to move, allow our hand to follow the movement\nfreely without interfering with it in any way.\nThe following account of our last sitting, on June 26th, is from the\njournal of Mrs. R., written the same evening, transcribing the part of plan\nchette from the actual writing, and filling in our share of the investigation\nfrom immediate memory.\nExtract from journal of Wednesday, June 26th, 1889, and copy of plan-\nchttte-writing with Mr. Wedgwood :\u2014\n\" A spirit is here to-day who we think will be able to write through the\nmedium.

It is possible that I might have heard\nof his suicide at the time that it occurred, without its making any impression\non me, but I am sure I did not read such an obituary notice as would be\npublished in the Times, and when my attention was directed to his editorial\nwork 18 or 20 years afterwards I did not know whether he was alive or dead,\nand was entirely ignorant of his military career. I never read any history\n\u2022of the Peninsular War, and am perfectly certain that I never had an oppor\ntunity of seeing Gurwood's crest, or knowing anything about it.\u2014H.W.\nThe following is the account Mr. Wedgwood wrote at the first seance at\nthe time :\u2014\nJune 26<A, 1882.\nHad a sitting at planchette with Mrs. R. this morning. Planchette said\nthere was a spirit there who thought he could draw if we wished it. We said\nwe should be glad if he would try. Accordingly P. made a rude attempt at a\nhand and arm proceeding from an embattled wall and holding a sword. A\nsecond attempt made the subject clearer. P. said it was meant for a test.\nThe spirit signed it \"J. G.,\" no connection of any of ours, he said. We\ngradually elicted that his name was John Gurwood, who was wounded in the\nPeninsula\u2014in 1810, and killed himself on Christmas Day, 1845. It was not\nthe wound, but the pen that did it.\nSomething like that.\nJuly 5th, 1889.\nI made the foregoing memorandum the same day, having very little ex\npectation that there would be any verification.

I think the same spirit wrote throughout, beginning without signature ;\nbut when we asked the name, writing (after some struggle and illegibility)\n'John Gurwood.'\n\"The effort was at first incoherent, but developed into the following sen\ntences :\u2014\n\" ' Sword\u2014when I broke in, on the table with plan of fortress\u2014belonged\nto my prisoner ; I will tell you his name to-night. It was on the table when\nI broke in. He did not expect me ; I took him unawares. He was in his\nroom, looking at a plan, and the sword was on the table. Will try and let\nyou know how I took the sword to-night.'\n\" In the evening after dinner.\n\" 'I fought my way in. His name was Banier' (three times repeated).\n' The sword was lying on the table by a written scheme of defence. Oh,\nmy head. Banier had a plan written out for the defence of the fortress.\nIt was lying on the table, and his sword was by it.'\n\" To a question :\u2014\n\" 'Yes ; surprised him.'\n'' Mr. Wedgwood thinks the name of the Governor of the fortress of Ciudad\nRodrigo was Banier ; but he says this would not be a test, as he knew it. He\nis going to see if he can find anything in Napier's Peninsular War corrobora\ntive of what is said about the sword.\n\" ' Look. I have tried to tell you what you can verify.' \"\nMr. Wedgwood reports his verification as follows :\u2014\n\"When I came to verify the message of planchette I speedily found that\nColonel Gurwood, the editor of the Duke's despatches, led the forlorn hope\nat the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, in 1812 [note error in date], ' and re\nceived a wound in the skull from a musket ball which affected him for the\nremainder of his life.'\u2014Annual Register, 1845. In recognition of the bravery\nshown on that occasion he received a grant of arms in 1812, registered in\nthe College of Arms as having been passed ' upon the narrative that he\n(Captain G.) had led the forlorn hope at Ciudad Rodrigo, and that, after the\nstorming of the fortress, the Earl of Wellington presented him with the\nsword of the Governor, who had been taken prisoner by Captain Gurwood. ' 1\n\" The services thus specified were symbolised in the crest, 'Out of a\nmural coronet, a castle ruined in the centre, and therefrom an arm in\narmour embowed, holding a scimitar. ' 2\n\"It is plainly this crest that is aimed at by planchette in his very rude\ndesign, which represents the arm and sword as issuing from the mural\ncoronet alone, omitting the ruined castle as too complex a subject for the\npowers of the designer. The drawing was given merely as a test, and if it\npointed unmistakably to the Gurwood crest it would fulfil its purpose.\n\" In accordance with the assertion of planchette, Colonel Gurwood killed\nhimself on Christmas Day, 1845, and the Annual Register of that year,\nafter narrating the suicide, continues : ' It is thought that this laborious\nundertaking (the editing the despatches) produced a relaxation of the\nnervous system and consequent depression of spirits.

Compare planchette :\n' Pen was too much for me after the wound.' \"\nI continue the quotation from Mrs. R.'s journal :\u2014\nMr. W. : \"Can you tell me where else to look ? \"\n\" I have no power to direct you. We have exhausted, but I wished to\ntell you about poor Quentain ... to tell you a secret of poor Quintain's,\nwhich is on my mind.

We pondered over it, but could not\nmake out any more. When planchette was put back, the following was\nvolunteered :\u2014\n'' Tell James I remember him quite well. He will recollect about Quen-\ntin's trial.\"\nMr. Wedgwood's friend, Captain James, of course, was meant.

We sat again for a few minutes before lunch,\ndirectly after which he left by train ; but the control was then different, and\nthe few words written did not appear to have any special interest or meaning.\na\n\f98 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nMr. Wedgwood writes on October 31st, 1889 :\u2014\nI find that there was a famous court martial on Colonel Quentin in\nOctober, 1814, in consequence of a round robin signed by 24 of his officers.\nI had a vague recollection of the name of Colonel Q. as a friend of George IV.,\nand something must have turned up about the court martial in the early twen\nties when the 10th Hussars became notorious, as I found I had heard of the\nround robin. The accusation, too, was of a want of proper directions to his\nsubordinates in action, so no reticence of anybody could have made any\ndifference, and he was himself the Colonel of the regiment.\nWith respect to the capture of Banier, the only chance of verification\nwould be from the family, and Miss Gurwood has not answered my letter.\n[Captain James writes to me from 10, Hereford-road, June 29th, 1891 :\u2014\n''About the year 1830 my regiment was quartered at Portsmouth, and Colonel\nGurwood was then on the staff of the garrison there.

On our beginning again to sit, the following\nwas volunteered :\u2014\n\" I am not Hume. I have come with [Mrs. V.]. I was attracted to her\nduring her life in America. My work was in that land, and my' earthly\ntoil was cut short early, as hers has been. T died at thirty years old.

I worked\nat \" (sentence ends with a line of D.'s).\nHere Mr. Wedgwood felt tired, and Miss Hughes proposed that she and\nI should go for a walk while he rested. When we came in Mr. Wedgwood\nsaid he thought it had come into his head who our control was. He had\nsome recollection that in the 18th century a man named David Brainard was\nmissionary to the North American Indians. We sat again, and the follow\ning was written :\u2014\n\"I am glad you know me. I had not power to complete name or give\nmore details. I knew that secret of the district. It was guarded by the\nIndians, and was made known to two independent circles. Neither of them\nsucceeded, but the day will come that will uncover the gold.\"\nIt was suggested that this meant Heavenly truth.\n\" I spoke of earthly gold.\"\nMr. Wedgwood said the writing was so faint he thought power was failing.\n\" Yes, nearly gone. I wrote during my five years of work. It kept my\nheart alive. \"\nMr. Wedgwood writes :\u2014\n\"I could not think at first where I had ever heard of Brainard, but I\nlearn from my daughter in London that my sister-in-law, who lived with me\n40 or 50 years ago, was a great admirer of Brainard, and seemed to have an\naccount of his life, but I am quite certain that I never opened the book and\nknew nothing of the dates, which are all correct, as well as his having been\na missionary to the Susquehannahs.\"\nIn another letter Mr. Wedgwood writes :\u2014\n\"I see the name is Brainerd, not ard, as I had supposed, and this removes\na difficulty in the writing. Planchette had written Braine, and said that\nwas right as far as it went, which it would not have been if the name had\nbeen Brainard. My daughter has sent me extracts from his life, stating that\nhe was born in 1718, and not 1717 as planchette wrote. But Mrs. It.'s\nBiographical Dictionary says that he died in 1747, aged 30.\"\n[Mrs. R. writes to me that she had no knowledge whatever of David\nBrainerd before this incident.\u2014F. W. H.

A celebrated American missionary, who signalised\nhimself by his successful endeavours to convert the Indians on the Susque\nhanna, Delaware, etc. Died, aged 30, 1747. Mr. Wedgwood adds :,\u2014\nIt is perhaps noteworthy in connection with the last sentence of the\nplanchette-writing that in the life of Brainerd by Jonathan Edwards\nextracts given from his journal show that he wrote a good deal, e.g., \" Feb.\n3, 1744. Could not but write as well as meditate,\" &c. \"Feb. 15, 1745.\nWas engaged in writing almost all the day.\" He invariably speaks of comfort\nin connection with writing.\nFinally, a few months before Mr. Wedgwood's death, I received\nfrom him the following letter.\nM.

Edition, 1849.\n\"An event occurred in the month of March, 1605, which has acquired more\nthan ordinary importance : we refer to the murder of Mrs. Clarke, land\nlady of the Blue Boar Inn, by her servants. Its details are contained in the\ndepositions taken before the magistrates at this time, and appear to have\nbeen these :\u2014About six weeks after Michaelmas, in 1604, a man named\nHarrison, who had fled from Staffordshire in consequence of having done\nbodily injury to a person named Philip, came to Leicester ; the Blue Boar\nbeing the first inn he approached, he resolved to lodge there, and slept there\nthree nights. During his stay he ' fell into speech with a maid in the house,\nin the way of marriage, whereupon she told him her mistress had great\nstore of money in her house, and bade him come again some night, and\nbring a secret friend with him whom she might trust, and there would be\nmeans made to get some of the money. ' Accordingly, Harrison ' went\nhis way,' and at Lichfield met with Adam Bonus, to whom he communicated\nthe nefarious project, and Bonus further made one Edward Bradshaw ac\nquainted therewith.\n\"Harrison and Bradshaw came to Leicester together on the 1st February,\n1605, and that night lodged at John Webster's house ; on Saturday, 2nd\nFebruary, they removed with their horses to the Blue Boar, where they\nslept ; and on Sunday they remained together at the inn all day.\n\" In the evening, about 10 o'clock, one of the female servants (Alice\nGrimbold, a native of Peckleton) went with her companion with some\nprovender for the horses, to the stable, whither they were followed by the\nmen. Alice Grimbold then went to the well, to fetch some water for the\nhorses, and, on returning to the stable with it, found her fellow-servant\nbound therein ; when Harrison immediately laid hands on her, and\nsecured her also. The men afterwards took some drink, and wanted\nthe servants to partake of it, but they refused. They then un\nbound Grimbold (as she stated) and took her into the house with\nthem, and obtained her mistress's keys from her, Bradshaw having bound\nMrs. Clarke while Harrison secured the servants in the stable. The latter\nin his examination confessed that he had done this, and added that the ' big\nmaid ' (meaning Grimbold) after she was unbound went with them, appa\nrently on compulsion, into her mistress's parlour, where they opened three\ncoffers\u2014one containing linen, the second being full of writings, and the\nthird having six or seven bags of gold and silver therein. The robbers took\nmost of the money (amounting, as was variously estimated by them, to not\nless than \u00a3250\u2014more probably \u00a3500), but left some upon the bedstead for\ntheir female accomplice. Bradshaw then murdered Mrs. Clarke, fastened\nGrimbold in the chimney, where (she said) they laid her, ' but easily. ' He\nand his accomplice next went to the stables, and brought out their horses,\n,and lastly, having fastened the bags about the pommels of their saddles, they\nrode away. Grimbold would gladly (according to her own confession) have\ngone away with them, but they swore by ' God's wounds ' they would hang\nher, and themselves, too, if she attempted to do so. Harrison had previously\ngiven her a linen cloth, containing money and other things, promising to come\nfor it in ten days, and take her away with him at the same time. Her legs\n\f102 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nnot being firmly bound, Grimbold released herself from her position, and\nwent into the buttery to see how her mistress did, but could not get out\nagain : so she lay there until the morning, when John Walter's man caine\ninto the house to light a candle, and completely unbound her. The deed was\ndiscovered the day after its execution ; for Bonus (who had refused to take a\npart in the robbery) being then in the town, was on Monday, February 4th,\napprehended and examined before the justices and the coroners. He said\nhe could not have revealed what he knew, had it not been that the\nmurder had been committed ; and he affirmed that he had positively told\nBradshaw, on the Sunday, he would take no part in the action. Harri\nson was examined on the 20th February before the magistrates. He denied\nhaving aided in the murder of Mrs. Clarke, and said she was living when he\nleft the house. But for the maid, he asserted, he should not have known\nwhat money Mrs. Clarke had in her possession. He had had only about \u00a317\nas his share of the booty, which Sir Simon Weston had then in his custody,\nwhile the remainder was hidden in a bank in Pool Park, Warwickshire.\nBradshaw was not examined until six days after Harrison. He confirmed his\naccomplice's account of the concealment of the money in Pool Park,\nTamworth. It seems he had succeeded by means of his share of the plunder\nin obtaining bail, and his release from Stafford Gaol (where he and Harrison\nwere at first confined) through the intervention of Lord Stafford, who also\nproceeded to London to procure his pardon. But the latter attempt was\nfrustrated by the intercession of the Leicester magistrates with Sir John\nPopham, the Lord Chief Justice, on February 17th. They informed his\nlordship on that date of the circumstances of the case, and added that\nBradshaw might be expected to go to Lord Stafford's lodgings in London.\nThe murderer was consequently apprehended and brought to Leicester.\nThe witnesses bound over to appear against the accused were Thomas Davy\nand Richard Hunt, bakers ; Alexander Simpson and William Robinson,\nlabourers. Harrison was specially examined relative to ten questions, by\norder of the judge, while he was in gaol and under sentence of death, on\nMarch 22nd, 1605. In reply, he stated that he knew not what was given to\nLord Stafford, to Cotty, or the gaoler, to procure bail for Bradshaw, but it\nwas reported in Stafford that Cotty had had \u00a340 ; that one Reynish, and\nGeorge Ewlins, servant to Lord Stafford, and Jane Holmes, wife to John\nHolmes, servant of Sir Walter Asten, Knight, did assure him (Harrison)\nthat Cotty's wife said to Lord Stafford, ' Let Bradshaw be bailed, and let\nHarrison be hanged ' ; that Mr. Humphrey Chatterton's wife, of Bowdis-\nworth Park, interceded with Lord Stafford to procure bail for Bradshaw, and\nhad money for her pains ; that John Bratt, who repaired to him at Stafford\nGaol, went to see him from motives of friendship\u2014for they had been fellow-\nservants with Sir John Bowes, Knight ; and that no persons had procured\nhim instruments to enable him to break out of Stafford Gaol. The other\nquestions related to matters which had been previously given in evidence,\nand were not of importance. The trial took place on March 25th, 1606\n[1605 1 ], probably in the present Town Hall\u2014before Sir Peter Warburton,\nKnight, when Bradshaw was sentenced to be hanged, and Alice Grimbold to\nbe burned.\"\nFrom Notes and Queries, 2nd series, Vol. IV., August, 1857, it appears\n\fThe Subliminal CoTiscioiisneas. 103\nthat one source of this story is the commonplace book of Sir Roger Twisden,\nAugust, 1653. He had seen a Mrs. Cumber, who had herself seen Alice\nburnt, some 40 years before. He mentions a legend which had grown up by\nthat time of the way in which Mrs. Clarke became possessed of the treasure\nfor which she was murdered ;\u2014namely, that it had been found on the bed\nstead on which Richard III. slept before the battle of Bosworth, and which\nafter his death was left at the Blue Boar. It will be observed that the\nautomatic script does not adopt this legend, but states incidentally that\nRichard once slept there. On this point Mr. R. E. Smith, of 41, Princess-\nstreet, Leicester, writes to Mr. Wedgwood, as follows .\u2014\n\" I give at foot a copy of the inscription you inquire about. It is on a\nmural tablet, adjacent to the Bow Bridge, and it was placed there some 30\nor 35 years ago by the owner of the property.\n\" Tradition points to the locality as the spot where the remains of Richard\nIII. were thrown after having been brought from the field of battle.\n\"However that may be, there can be no doubt that] he slept at the\n' Blue Boar ' Inn, in the Southgate-street, the night before the battle. That\nwas the house kept by Mrs. Clarke. It was pulled down about 50 years ago.\"\nNear this spot lie the remains of\nRichard III.,\nThe last of the Plantagenets.\n1485.\nAs to the possible knowledge possessed by either automatist of the\nabove story, Mr. Wedgwood writes, May 19th, 1891 :\u2014\n94, Gower-street, May 16th, 1891.\nMrs. R. says : \"One or two points remain unconfirmed, such as the way\nin which Mrs. Clarke was put to death (A. G. says she was strangled), also\nthere having been a local tradition that ' Crook-backed Richard ' slept at\nthe Blue Boar ; but I suppose Mr. Smith could not help us to any further\nverification ? I am rather impressed by the fact that A. G. communicated\nwith us in March (the 22nd and 23rd), so near the anniversary of her trial\nand condemnation, and probably also that of her awful death. I wonder\nwhether the fact of my always having had an intense horror and dread of a\ndeath by burning, and of this manner of execution, could supply any link\nfor the control ? \" Mrs. R. proceeds: \"The effect of the influence on me\nwas strong and peculiar. I should recognise its return even apart from any\nthing written. ... I have never been in Leicester or the neighbour\nhood in my life, nor have I ever seen a copy of Thompson's History. I did\nnot know of the existence of the book till mentioned by Mr. Smith, and\nI have never consciously been under a roof with it in my life, except, as you\nsuggest, at the British Museum, and my last visit there was at 12 years old !\nI have no friends or acquaintances living in Leicester.\"\u2014Yours very truly,\nH. Wedgwood.\nAs regards himself, he writes, May 21st, 1891: \"I am quite\ncertain that I never saw Thompson's History of Leicester, nor ever\nheard anything about the incident.\" Mrs. R. also in a letter to me,\nMay 20th, 1891, repeats the statements above quoted from her by Mr.\n\f104 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nWedgwood and adds : \" I cannot now remember any communication\nthrough our circle for which so early a date was given as that of\nAlice Grimbold.\"\nA story like this of Alice Grimbold's may probably enough be\nquoted in some books more easily accessible than the History of\nLeicester. We have made some search without finding it thus quoted,\nbut should be glad to hear if it is found in any common work.\nI have quoted these three cases in succession, so that the reader may\nsee the kind of growing difficulty which the theory of forgotten\nmemories here involves. It will be seen that with each automatist of\ngood faith the question may with patience be capable of definite solution.\nWere Mrs. R. willing and able\u2014which at present she is not\u2014to find\nsome other partner with whom she can write, now that Mr. Wedgwood\nand her sister have been removed by death, and to record a long series\nof communications, we might gradually obtain a conviction that the\nmatters therein narrated either could or could not all of them have been\npreviously seen and forgotten. Similar records kept by many other auto-\nmatists might help to some general conclusion as to the source from\nwhich these refcrocognitive facts come, if in any cases forgotten memory\nfails to explain them. One of the most important data for such a\ndecision consists in the account,\u2014absolutely trustworthy, as I believe,\n\u2014given by Mr. Stainton Moses in Spirit Identity, (and soon, we\nhope, to lie reproduced in these Proceedings), of a series of messages\nfrom musical composers, giving the principal dates of their respective\nlives, as they may be found in any Biographical Dictionary, with\nhardly anything more. Now were such messages offered to us as\ncoming through an alleged automatist not of known probity or who\ncould bring no proof of other messages not capable of being got up be\nforehand, we should naturally set them aside. But with Mr. Moses, as\nwith Mrs. R. above,\u2014and in a still higher degree,\u2014there was so con\nsiderable an independent history of provably supernormal phenomena\nthat we are bound to consider these musical biographies in their place\nas a part of that series. Their peculiar nature excited the surprise of\nMr. Moses and his friends, who were informed by the \" guides \" that\nthese were in fact messages from the spirits in question, but that these\nspirits had refreshed their memory of their earth-lives by consulting\nprinted sources of information. It is obvious that this is to drop the\nsupposed proof of identity altogether. If any given spirit can consult\nhis own printed life, so also presumably can other spirits ; and so per\nhaps can the still incarnated spirit of the automatist himself. This was\nof course felt by Mr. Moses, who told me that subjectively also the feel\ning which accompanied these biographical writings was very different\nfrom that which came when, as he held, some spirit was entering with\nhim into real and direct communication.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 105\nThe truest analogy to messages like these from a remote past lies,\nas it seems to me, in the crystal-visions of scenes in a remote past, of\nwhich examples were given in my chapter on \" Sensory Automatism.\"\nWe are face to face with the problem of Retrocognition, closer akin\nperhaps to the still stranger problem of Precognition than to the\nquestion of personal intercourse with recently departed friends on\nwhich we are now dwelling. That vaster question of a Universal\nMemory, a Cosmorama of things past, present, and to come, must be\nleft for later discussion.\nBefore leaving this series of cases I think it only fair to print a\nfourth experiment with the same operators, but apparently involving a\n\" physical \" or \" telekinetic phenomenon,\" as well as either clair\nvoyance or spirit agency. Mr. Wedgwood is again the narrator. The\naccount was printed in the Journal for February, 1890.\nM. CI. Aut. 674.\nOn the 4th December last I had a sitting with Mrs. R. and her sister,\n,which afforded evidence not less decisive of the intervention of an intelligence\ncognisant of matters of which we had no intimation.\nNot long after my arrival on a visit to Mrs. R., mention was made of a\nmysterious breakage of a thick washhand-basin which had taken place onthe\nprevious Sunday, closely resembling other breakages which had occurred in\nthe house from time to time in a like unaccountable manner. On one\noccasion a water bottle was seen to explode on the dressing-table when no one\nwas near it. On the Sunday in question Mr. R. and his sister-in-law, Mrs.\nV., were in the breakfast-room directly under Mrs. R. 's bedroom, Mrs. R.\nwith the children in the drawing-room, and the servants at Bupper in the\nkitchen, when Mr. R. and Mrs. V. were startled by a loud crash in the room\nabove them. Mrs. V. immediately ran in to her sister in the drawing-room\nand they went together upstairs to see what had happened. They found the\nthick washhand-basin in fragments on the floor ; the larger pieces in front of\nthe washstand, but quantities of smaller fragments scattered over the floor to\na distance (as I estimated) of five or six feet, in a way that could not possibly\nhave been produced by a mere fall on the carpeted floor : the basin must\nhave been dashed down with great violence.\nWhile talking of these matters I sat down to planchette with my hostess\nand her sister, and Mr. R. coming into the room and hearing what we were\ntalking about, said that some half an hour ago he had heard a noise in the\nbreakfast-room for which he could not account in any way. It sounded like\nthe lid of the metal coal-box slamming down, but the box had been already\nclosed, and, besides, the noise seemed to come from the other side of the\nroom. Soon afterwards he said that his presence always seemed to interfere\nwith planchette-writing, and he left the room. Mrs. R. and I had begun\nsitting, but planchette suggested a change, and Mrs. V. and I had our hands\non the board.\nPlanchette : \"If Mr. Wedgwood will ask I will try to answer.\"\nI asked what was the noise Mr. R. had just heard.\nPlanchette : \"Noise from upstairs made by spirits with material object.\"\n\f106 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\" Was it in the room above ? \"\nPlanchette: \"Yes.\"\n\" What was it ?\"\nPlanchette : \"Mrs. R. will find out.\"\nMrs. R. accordingly went upstairs to look, and while she was away some\nthing was said as to the probability of my witnessing some similar display.\n\u2022 Planchette : \"Not yet\u2014you see the better class of spirits war against\nthe smashing fraternity.\"\nMrs. R. could find nothing out of order, and returned saying she had\nlooked everywhere.\nPlanchette: \"No, you did not.\"\nMrs. R. : \" Whereabouts am I to look, for I can see nothing 1 \"\nPlanchette : \" Wash\u2014(an illegible scribble)\u2014that side of the room.\"\nWe asked, ' ' Were you trying to write washstand ? \"\nPlanchette: \"Yes.\"\nMrs. R. went up again, and, meeting with no better success, came\ndown for more specific instructions where to look.\nPlanchette: \"Slop-jar\" (written very large).\nMrs. R., laughing, said she hoped that was not smashed, and went up for\nthe third time. She found the slop-jar in its usual place by the washstandr\nand when she came to look closely into it, found the water-glass lying broken\nall to bits in the bottom. She had not removed it from its usual place on\nthe top of the carafe since morning, from whence it had apparently been\nlifted off and dropped into the empty slop-jar from a height sufficient to cause\nthe crash heard in the room below.\nMrs. R. brought us down the jar to show how completely the glass was\nsmashed.\nWe then asked, \" Was this done by the same spirit who broke the basin ? \"\nPlanchette: \"The same adverse influence; not the same spirit, but\ninfluence,\"\nMrs. R. confirms and slightly corrects this account in a letter to Mr.\nWedgwood dated April 16th, [1890]:\u2014\"I have referred to my journal of\nDecember 4th, 1889, and it confirms our clear recollection that the crash of\nthe glass dropped into the slop-jar was heard by my husband sitting below in\nthe breakfast-room just before he came in to join our planchette seance, and\nwhile [Mrs. V.] and I were both with you in the drawing-room. On the pre\nvious Sunday, December 1st, we had had a breakage in the same room, which\nwas also referred to in the planchette writing. My sister and husband were\nboth in the breakfast-room and they both heard a noise like an explosion in\nthe room above, and running up immediately to see what had happened,\nfound my thick earthenware washing-basin broken to fragments and.\nscattered all over the floor. I was in the drawing-room with the three chil\ndren at the time this happened.\"\nD.\u2014I by no means wish to assume any clear line of demarcation\nbetween messages referable to some intelligence unknown and messages\nreferable to the special intelligence which claims to send them. In our\npresent state of knowledge such a dividing line can merely subserve\nour own convenience of study. By beginning my next class at this\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 107\npoint I would indicate that the six cases which follow involve messages\navowedly coming from persons more recently departed, and into which\nsomething more of definite personality seems to enter. One element\nof this kind is handwriting ; and in the next two cases it will be seen\nthat resemblance of handwriting is one of the evidential points alleged.\nNow proof of identity from resemblance of handwriting may conceiv\nably be very strong. But in estimating it we must bear two points in\nmind. The first is that, (like the resemblances of so-called \" spirit-\nphotographs \" to deceased friends), it is often very loosely asserted.\nOne needs, if not an expert's opinion, at least a careful personal\nscrutiny of the three scripts,\u2014the automatist's voluntary and his\nautomatic script, and the decedent's script\u2014before one can feel sure\nthat the resemblance is in more than some general scrawliness. This\nrefers to the cases where the automatist has provably never seen the\ndecedent's handwriting. Where he has seen that handwriting, we have\nto remember (in the second place) that a hypnotised subject can\nfrequently imitate any known handwriting far more closely than in\nhis waking state ; and that consequently we are bound to credit the\nsubliminal self with a mimetic faculty which may come out in these\nmessages without any supraliminal guidance whatever on the automa\ntist's part.\nThe case now to be quoted contains several points of interest besides\nthe alleged resemblance of handwriting. It shows once more, for\ninstance, the great similarity of ways in which this writing takes its\nrise with automatists all over the world, and the recurrence of the same\npuzzles with observers of many different types.\nPsychic Experiences.\nM. Aut. 68.\nBy Sara A. Underwood.\u2014Introductory Remarks by B. F. Underwood.\n(Arena, August, 1891.)\n\"The statements in this paper as to what was written in my presence\npurporting to be communications from ' spirits,' and as to the circumstances\nunder which it was written, are scrupulously correct. The 'communica\ntions,' it is certain, are from an intelligent source. Mrs. Underwood is the\nperson by whose hand they are put in form. That she is not labouring\nunder a mistake in thinking that she is unconscious of the thought expressed\nuntil she has read the writing,\u2014if, indeed, such a mistake in a sane mind is\npossible,\u2014I am certain. Sometimes, owing to the illegibility of the writing,\nshe has to study out sentences. The writing varies in style, not only on\ndifferent evenings, but on the same evening ; it is apparently the writing of\nnot fewer than twenty persons, and generally bearing no resemblance what\never, so far as I can judge, to Mrs. Underwood's handwriting, which is\nremarkably uniform. The communications are unlike in the degrees of\nintelligence, in the quality of thought, and in the disposition which they\nBhow. Detailed statements of facts unknown to either of us, but which,\nweeks afterwards, were learned to be correct, have been written, and\n\f108 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nrepeated again and again, when disbelieved and contradicted by us. All the\nwriting has been done in my presence, but most of it while I have been\nbusily occupied with work which demanded my undivided attention. The\nviews expressed are often different from my own, and quite as frequently,\nperhaps, opposed to Mrs. Underwood's views. \"\nMrs. Underwood writes as follows:\u2014\"The modits operandi is the simplest\npossible. As I remembered that Mr. Underwood was rather averse to the\nplanchette experiments of former years, thinking them unwholesome and\ndeteriorating in their tendency, I at first said nothing to him of my new\npsychical experiments, though these were made oftenest in his presence in\nthe evening when we both sat at one writing table, near each other, busied\nwith our individual literary work. As I experimented in his absence as well\nas in his presence, I soon found that I got the most coherent writings when he\nwas present. Indeed I could get nothing coherent, and very frequently\nnothing at all, when he was away, but when he was present the communica\ntions began to grow strangely interesting, and as he was called upon\nrepeatedly, I felt obliged to invite his attention, when the most surprising\nanswers were given, which roused his curiosity and interest. It has been\nexplained that his presence is necessary for me to obtain writing, as ' blended\npower is best.' Two or three times, at the suggestion of this intelligence,\nwe have asked two of our intimate literary friends\u2014non-Spiritualists\u2014to\nbe present, but each time with comparative failure ; afterwards we were in\nformed that the cause of failure was the introduction of persons unused to\nthe conditions, who broke up the harmonious relations necessary to com\nmunication ; in time they could be of help.\n\"It would take a volume to present all the interesting statements as to an\nadvanced stage of existence, only hidden from us because of the inadequacy\nof our sense perceptions, and by the conditions imposed upon us at this stage\nof our progress, which have been given from this source. Explanations have\nbeen made why communication through the agency of certain persons,\nthough not through all, is possible. The conditions, it is alleged, are not\nentirely dependent upon the superior intelligence or morality of the persons\nwith whom the intelligences can became en rapport. These invisibles declare\nthat they are as seriously and anxiously experimenting on their side to dis\ncover modes of untrammelled communication with us, as we on our side\nought to be, if what they write be true, and if such a thing is possible.\n' Spirits ' they persistently insist upon being called. In this paper I can\ngive only a statement of some things which do not seem explicable on the\nhypothesis of mind-reading, thought-transference, hypnotism, or subconscious\nness. In all these experiments I have been in a perfectly normal state. The\nonly physical indication of any outside influence is an occasional slight thrill\nas of an electric current from my shoulder to the hand which holds the wait\ning pen, Step by step I have been taught a series of signals to aid me in\ncorrectly reading the communications. I have no power to summon at will\nany individual I wish. I have repeatedly, but in vain, tried to get messages\nfrom some near and dear friends. It has been explained that on their side,\nas on ours, certain 'conditions' must exist in order to get in 'control.'\nWhen ' eh ? ' is written I know that the operator at the other end of the line\nis ready to communicate. When in the middle of a sentence or a word\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 109\n'gone ' or ' change ' is written, I understand that the connection is broken,\nand I must not expect the completion of that message. When a line like\nthis is drawn, it is a sign that that sentence is completed or the communi\ncation ended. So with other things. Rhymes are often unexpectedly\nwritten, especially if the ' control ' professes to be a poet, and they are\ndashed off so rapidly that I do not understand their import until the close\nwhen I can read them over. Impromptu rhyming is a feat utterly im\npossible to either Mr. Underwood or myself. Names persistently recur which\nare unknown to us. Many different handwritings appear, some of them far\nsuperior to my own. When I first began to get communications I destroyed,\nin a day or two after they were written, the slips of paper containing the\nwriting, but as the developments became more interesting, Mr. Underwood\nsuggested that they be preserved for reference. I acted on this suggestion,\nand thus in the instances of facts given outside our own knowledge, I am\nenabled to give the exact wording of each communication. Our questions\nwere asked viva voce, and as they were often suggested by what had been\npreviously written, I either at the time or soon afterwards wrote them just\nabove the reply. I am not, therefore, trusting at all to memory in the state\nments I shall make.\n\" A gentleman of this city (whom I will call John Smith, but whose real\nname was a more uncommon one) with whom Mr. Underwood had been\nacquainted many years, but of whose family relations he knew little, died\nhere more than a year ago. Mr. Underwood had met him but once in the\nyear previous to his death, he having been away on account of failing health,\nstaying, we understood, with a daughter recently married, whose home was\nin Florida. The first name of this married daughter, or of any of Mr. Smith's\ndaughters except one, was unknown to Mr. Underwood. I had met one of\nhis daughters whose name I knew to be Jennie. I also knew that there was\nanother named Violet. I was not sure, however, whether this was the name\nof the married one, or of another unmarried, but had the impression that\nViolet was unmarried. One evening, while waiting for automatic writing\nwith no thought of Mr. Smith in my mind, and Mr. Underwood sitting\nnear me at the table with his thoughts concentrated on an article he was\npreparing, this was written : ' John Smith will now enter into conversa\ntion with B. F. Underwood.' I read this to Mr. Underwood, who laid aside\nhis pen, and in order to test the matter, asked if Mr. Smith remembered the\nlast time they met, soon after his return from the South, and a short time\nprevious to his death. There was some delay in the answer, but soon reply\ncame, ' On Madison-street.' ' Whereabouts on Madison ? ' was asked. ' Near\nWashington.' ' At what hour ? ' 'About 10 a.m., raining.' As it was rarely\nthat Mr. Underwood was in that part of the city at so early an hour, and\nespecially on a rainy day, I doubted the correctness of this reply, but Mr.\nUnderwood recalled to my mind the unusual circumstance which made it\nnecessary for him to be in that vicinity on the day and at the hour named, on\nwhich he and Mr. Smith, he distinctly remembered, last met. Only a few\nwords passed between them on account of the rain. After this, writing, pur\nporting to be from Mr. Smith, came frequently. Very soon something\nwas written which induced Mr. Underwood half sportively to inquire\nwhether there was anything which troubled Mr. Smith, anything which he\n\f110 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwished he had done but had omitted, before his death. The answer came,\n' One thing\u2014change deeds on Violet's account. None of my wife's are at\nmy daughter's disposal. All in her own disposal.' Mr. Underwood asked\nif it was meant that he had not left his property\u2014for he was a man of some\nwealth\u2014as he now wished he had. ' You are right\/ was written, ' want all\nmy girls to share alike.' 'Which daughter do you refer to?' was asked.\n' Went away from her in Florida\u2014Violet,' was the answer. I remarked,\n' Why, I thought Violet was one of the unmarried girls, but it must be that\nthat is the name of the married daughter. ' Then Mr. Underwood was strongly\nurged to call on Mr. Smith's married son, James, with whom Mr. Under\nwood had a slight acquaintance, and tell him of this communication. 'Clearly\nstate my desire that my daughter Violet share equally with her sisters.' Of\ncourse this was utterly out of the question. At that time we had no intention\nof informing any one of our psychic experience, and if we had, Mr. James\nSmith would have thought us insane or impertinent to come to him with so\nridiculous a story, the truth of which we ourselves strongly doubted. Pages\nwere, however, written concerning the matter in so earnest and pleading a\nmanner that I came to feel conscience-stricken at refusing to do what was\nasked, and to shrink from seeing Mr. Smith's name appear. Once was\nwritten, ' Say to James that in my new position, and with my new views of\nlife, I feel that I did wrong to treat his sister Violet as I did. She was not\nto blame for following out her own convictions, when I had inculcated\nindependent thought and action for all.' This and other sentences of the\nkind seemed to convey the idea that Violet had in some way incurred his\ndispleasure by doing according to her own will in opposition to his. This\nwas puzzling to us, as we knew that in her marriage, at least, the daughter\nwe thought to be Violet had followed her father's wishes.\n\"A few weeks later, however, came an unlooked-for verification of Mr.\nSmith's messages. In a conversation between Mr. Underwood and a business\nfriend of Mr. Smith, who was well acquainted with all his affairs, regret\nwas expressed that so wealthy a man had left so little for a certain pur\npose. Mr. Underwood then inquired as to what disposition had been made\nof his property, and was told that he had left it mainly to his wife and\nchildren\u2014so much to this one, and that. 'But Violet,' continued Mr.\nUnderwood's informant, ' was left only a small amount, as Mr. Smith was\nangry because she married against his wishes.' ' Why,' remarked Mr.\nUnderwood, ' I understood that he approved of the match, and the fact\nthat he accompanied herself and husband to Florida, and remained with\nthem some time, would seem to indicate that.' ' Oh, you are thinking of\nLucy, the eldest girl ; her marriage was all right, but Violet, one of the\nyounger daughters, going to Florida with her [Lucy's] husband, fell in love\nwith a young man of whom her father did not approve, so she made a run\naway marriage, and on account of his displeasure, Mr. Smith left her only a\nsmall sum.' The intelligence writing was aware of facts unknown to either\nMr. Underwood or myself, and no other persons were in the room when these\npommunications were given.\"\nIn The Arena for June, 1892, Mr. Underwood continues :\u2014\n\" My presence has been and is now one of the conditions of Mrs. Under\nwood's getting connected and coherent writing. Only a few words and a\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. Ill\nsentence or two have been written occasionally in my absence. Once\n\u2022when I was absent from home the peculiar sensation which had always been\nfelt in Mrs. Underwood's right hand before the writing began, was felt in\nthe left hand, with which a name was written with letters reversed, and she\ncould read it only when impressed to do so. She held it before the mirror.\nIt was the name of a person two hundred miles distant, who was still alive,\nbut, as was subsequently learned, in an unconscious state at the time, and\n-very near death, which occurred two or three days afterwards.\n\"The word 'death' is never used except with 'so-called' before it, or\n'which is a new birth,' or some other explanatory or qualifying expression.\nThe writing purports to be from extra-mediumistic and extra-mundane\n.sources\u2014from invisible human beings who once inhabited this earth. The\nwriting always, whether purporting to be from a person of high or low\ndegree, claims that the controlling intelligence is a spirit\u2014a discarnate\nhuman being. Any intimation that the communicating intelligence may be\nthe medium's subconscious ego, a fraction of which only rises to the level of\nconscious knowledge, is met with responses to the effect that it is strange\nanybody can believe such a vagary. One claim, to which there has never\nbeen exception in any writing purporting to be a message, is that a ' spirit,'\nj\u00bb discarnate human being, moves the hand that holds the pen. Generally\nnames and dates are not given ; and when they are, they are as liable to be\nwrong as correct. In answer to questions as to the reason of this, it has\nbeen said substantially that memories and reminiscences are only gathered\nup as the departed are able to come in contact with persons and objects of\nearth. Strange as it may seem, I get tired and nervous when this writing\nis prolonged ; it exhausts me much more than it does Mrs. Underwood, on\nwhom it never leaves any depressing influence.\n\"The intelligence which seems to be extraneous, which invariably claims\nto be a departed spirit, now one, now another, is sometimes inferior\nintellectually to the medium ; at other times, in certain lines of thought, in\nthe use of words, and in the statement of facts, the intelligence that directs\n-the pen evinces larger knowledge than Mrs. Underwood consciously\npossesses. The spelling is sometimes different from her own, and the style\nis often stilted, and even grandiose, while her style is simple and natural.\nIn some cases the writing relates to what is entirely unknown to the\nwriter,\u2014to her ordinary consciousness,\u2014though in some of these cases I\ncan conceive it as possible, and deem it probable, that the writing relates to\nwhat has been noted or learned by the passive consciousness, and is evoked\ntherefrom even though there is no recognition of its having been included\nin the person's experience. But in other cases the writing has contained\nevidence of knowledge that Mrs. Underwood never could have obtained in\nany known way. She gave one or two instances in the August Arena, I\nwill relate another of her experiences which, in my opinion, proves that\nthere are supernormal methods of obtaining knowledge.\n\" One morning, a message purporting to be from a young man recently\ndeceased was received. Neither Mrs. Underwood nor I had ever seen his\nhandwriting. We knew his name only as William S. The message was\nsigned 'Z. W. S.' At the time, I remarked that I did not believe there\nwas any Z in his name, and in this opinion Mrs. Underwood concurred. A\n\f112 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nfew days afterwards we met the father and the mother of the young man,\nwho were so impressed with the resemblance between the handwriting and\nthat of their son that they wished to take the writing with them. There was\na Z in the name, but it was the initial of his second name, and not of the\nfirst, as it was written. In the presence of the young man's mother, Mrs.\nUnderwood's hand was moved to write, and the lady asked if her father\nwould give a test by writing his name. The first name, Solomon, was written\nslowly ; and after a pause, the surname was written very quickly. Mrs.\nUnderwood did not know and never had known the name, which was written\ncorrectly ; and Mr. S. , who is a lawyer and a man of critical and discriminat\ning mind, and his wife both declared that the signature closely resembled\nthat of the old gentleman. Some days ago I wrote to Mr. S., asking him\nwhether, after further reflection, he could suggest a possible explanation of\nwhat Mrs. Underwood wrote without recourse to any occult theory. He\nreplied and referred to the message purporting to be from his son, thus : ' I\nhave compared it with signatures of our boy. As I told you in Chicago at\nthe time, the writing bears a very strong resemblance to his writing. Mrs.\nUnderwood did not, in my opinion, either consciously or unconsciously,\nhave any knowledge of Will's full name. The writing, while quite similar\nto Will's, is very different from Mrs. Underwood's. My wife's father's\nname had not been mentioned at all. Never had been in Mrs. Underwood's\npresence. I don't think she had ever met a member of Mrs. S.'s family by\nthat name, yet she certainly wrote the name of Mrs. S.'s father, Solomon\nM., very plainly, when asked to write the name of the person who had just\nwritten that he had something to say. This writing was also very, very similar\nto the handwriting of the old gentleman. '\n\"Fully aware that incidents long forgotten may be recalled, that possibly\nno lapse of memory is irrevocable, and that under certain conditions from the\nsubmerged self may be sent up memories which cannot be distinguished\nfrom newly acquired knowlege, still, I am confident that Mrs. Underwood's\nhand has written names and statements of facts not only once, but several\ntimes, which were not and never had been any part of her conscious\nknowledge.'\nI proceed to a case whose interest for my readers is much impaired\nby my obligation to conceal the identity of the persons concerned. The\ntwo surviving witnesses are known to me, and are persons of position\nand intelligence. The third dramatis persona, who departed this life\na few years since, was also known to me ; and I am acquainted with\nthe joint work which was for many years carried on by the deceased\nand a survivor, and which was of a kind which may be conceived as\nstill interesting a departed spirit. I give to these three persons the\nnames, in all respects fictitious, of Mrs. Laurence, Mrs. Plowden, and\nMrs. Seddon, and I alter the Christian name quoted and the initial\nletter of Mrs. Seddon's home. The rest of the account is not altered\nexcept by abridgment.\nMrs. Laurence, whose account must first be given, had been\ninterested in the work done by Mrs. Plowden and Mrs. Seddon, had\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 113\ninterchanged a few letters with both, and had seen Mrs. Seddon on\na few occasions. Some months after Mrs. Plowden's death (but in no\napparent connection with that event) Mrs. Laurence began to expe\nrience certain automatic impulses, which were subjectively felt as\nproceeding from a deceased relative.\nLate one Tuesday evening [date given] the impulse to some form\nof such communication came on with unusual force.\nM. Aut. 69.\n\"Feeling very doubtful how to act, yet dimly conscious that I was being\ndrawn into something unusual, and unknown to me, I seated myself at a\nlittle table.\n\" Soon I began to feel my thoughts drawn out strongly towards Mrs.\nPlowden. Next there reached me an impulsion to get writing materials. I\nnow began to realise that I was not alone, and that my services were required\nfor some purpose, which revealed itself when, on taking up a pen, I imme\ndiately felt a strange thrill flow through my right arm, which then ceased to\nbe under my full control. Such an experience was entirely new to me, and\nwith amazement I watched the pen write rapidly. Several pages were\nwritten in this manner. It seemed to me as if several influences had gathered\naround me, and were endeavouring to aid in the furtherance of a design much\ndesired by someone whom they accompanied and to serve whom they thus\nsought to employ me. I quickly became convinced that the guiding mind was\nMrs. Plowden's ; the reason why I felt so positively assured of her presence\nis that I seemed to see (with an inner vision) the feelings which were\nprompting her, and her mental vibrations seemed to mingle with mine,\nmaking me share her emotion, even while I did not understand its cause.\nSo deeply did her earnestness of desire and effort affect me that the tears\nran down my cheeks as I felt her striving to greet and instruct the friend,\nMrs. Seddon, to whom this communication was being poured forth.\n\" The variety of influences, my inexperience in such conditions, and the\nstrangeness of the scene in which I found myself so unexpectedly participat\ning, all combined, I fear, to prevent me from acting as a very manageable\nmedium to write through ; consequently the letter was written in a large\nscrambling handwriting, neither mine nor Mrs. Plowden's, though I felt and\ninteriorly saw that she tried to reproduce her own handwriting ; and it\nseemed to me that she was perplexed by the difficulty she discovered in using\nher instrument (my hand), which, owing to my inexperience and because it\nhad never before been borrowed in this way, did not yield itself sufficiently\npassively, and thus failed to roproduce the mechanical yet individual move\nments of another hand.\n\" I was so absorbed by the pathos and strangeness of this effort made by\none ' beyond the veil ' to communicate with the friend and co-worker who\nhad shared her aspirations and life mission on earth, that I paid small heed\nto the contents of the letter ; which, moreover, referred to matters of which\nI was entirely ignorant. All that I understood about it was that it was a\nmessage to Mrs. Seddon. The letter ended with the words, written with\nextraordinary intensity and underlined several times :\u2014\n\" ' Ruth ! Does not my voice reach you 1 '\nI\n\f11* Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\"I was rather puzzled at this name (Ruth) employed by Mrs. Plowden,\ntill the recollection flashed into my mind that Mrs. Plowden was\naccustomed to address Mrs. Seddon by it, [in consequence of certain private\ncircumstances]. It is impossible for me to describe adequately in words the\nintense earnestness with which the above appeal and question were made.\nIt was an exceeding bitter cry, as though the speaker-writer could not\ncomprehend what barrier could prevent her voice from being heard. And,\nlooking back to that memorable evening, I can distinctly remember how\nthere appeared before my mental vision the picture of a grassy spot, shaded\nby trees, close to a river. I did not understand the meaning of this till\nafterwards, when Mrs. Seddon explained the reason why Mrs. Plowden had\nthus exclaimed and written : ' Does not my voice reach you ? 1\n\"The letter was duly dispatched. I did not even glance at its contents,\nfeeling that the letter did not belong to me in any way. The sentences I\nhave quoted were impressed on my consciousness, and have remained in\nmy memory, because of the great earnestness which prompted them, causing\nme to feel and hear the sentiments they expressed. A day or two after\nthis first letter was written I again felt myself impelled to get writing\nmaterials, and once more my hand was used in the same (to me) extraordinary\nway.\n\" This time the conditions and mental atmosphere were calmer, and I was\nnot conscious of such a mingling of influences as on the previous occasion.\nI was also reassured by receiving a strengthened impression of Mrs.\nPlowden's actual presence, and of her urgent desire to discharge what she\nevidently regarded as a duty, viz., the expression of her wishes respecting\nwork left undone by her.\n\" This second letter contained a message to Mrs. Seddon bidding her to\nuse as preface to a book by Mrs. Plowden, which Mrs. Seddon was editing, a\npaper which Mrs. Plowden had written some time previously. Mrs. Plowden\nendeavoured to explain that Mrs. Seddon would find the manuscript which\nMrs. Plowden wished her thus to use ' in the window-seat of the school\nroom at K.'\n\" On this second occasion Mrs. Plowden used my hand to write a note to\nMrs. Seddon, and one to a relative.\n\" This time also I felt how strenuously she endeavoured to produce her\nown handwriting ; perhaps because she thought that thus her wishes would\nreceive more attention ; perhaps simply because there is something so\ncharacteristic and involuntary about one's handwriting.\n\" When these letters were being written I felt my hand grasped by\nsome soft intangible substance ; sometimes in forming the words the unseen\nhand seemed to become tremulous, as if the writing was only executed by\nan effort of will of one to whom a return to any material conditions was\npainful and difficult.\n\" I watched the words trace themselves on paper and again seemed to see\nthem arising in the unseen writer's mind. I longed to help, but did not\nrealise that probably complete passivity on my part would have been the\nmost helpful course to follow ; on this point the intimation reached me\nanother time: ' Try to stop thinking and I will try to speak.' The writing\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 115\nof these letters resembled Mrs. Plowden's. The envelopes were addressed\nin a writing exactly like Mrs. Plowden's own hand, I was afterwards told. I\ndistinctly remember that while the addresses were being written the hand\nwhich was resting on mine and writing with it pressed with increased\nfirmness and resolution, as if the writer were determined that no mistake\nshould be made in the names and addresses of the persons for whom the\ncommunications were intended.\n\" The envelope containing the note to the relative bore the name in full.\n\"The letter to Mrs. Seddon bore her London address ; where, however,\nshe was not, as she was then at K. (These details were explained to me\nafterwards.)\n\" Owing to a delay in posting the letter to the relative, the two letters\nreached K. at the same time, as Mrs. Seddon's was forwarded to her from\nLondon. After a day or two I heard from Mrs. Seddon that all the contents\nof the letters apparently written by Mrs. Plowden in the way just described,\nwere correct in every respect, excepting that tho room called in the letter\nthe 'school-room ' was usually called the ' study.'\n'' I tried throughout to pay as little attention as possible to the contents\nof the letters, because they were not intended for me and were only brought\nthus under my notice from stress of circumstances.\"\nThis account is corroborated by Mrs. Seddon, the recipient of the\ntwo aforesaid letters. Mrs. Seddon's account begins by stating that she\nhad been vainly endeavouring to enter into communion with the spirit\nof her departed friend by sitting in the churchyard where that friend's\nbody was buried. On the Tuesday aforesaid she visited that spot for\nthe last time, and retired in despair of obtaining any increased sense of\nnearness by that means. \" My last attempt was made on Tuesday\n[same date as above], and I made no mention to anybody of any\nattempts or of my wish.\" On this same evening, as we have seen, the\nimpulse as from Mrs. Seddon came to Mrs. Laurence at a distance ; and\nthis coincidence was heightened by the fact that the scene flashed upon\nMrs. Laurence's mind corresponded (so far as such scenes can be\nexpressed in definite words) with the actual look of the churchyard\u2014\nthe general aspect of which had, however, been described by Mrs.\nSeddon to Mrs. Laurence shortly before. I continue in Mrs. Seddon's\nwords :\u2014\n\"The letter which I received on Saturday was written on Wednesday,\nand in it she stated that late on the previous night\u2014the night of the day\non which I had abandoned my attempts atthe grave\u2014she had been influenced\nby someone whom she recognised as Mrs. Plowden, and who had caused her\ntowrite to me the letter now enclosed.\n\" The message thus dictated contained warm assurances of Mrs. Plowden's\ncontinued regard for me and interest in our work, and concluded with the\nexclamation, emphatically underlined and written with great energy :\n' Ruth, does not my voice reach you 1 ' the effect being as if she was then\nactually calling to me just as I had desired her to call, and as I had felt that\nshe was calling though the sounds failed to reach me.\ni 2\n\f116 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\" On the following day, Sunday, I received from Mrs. Laurence, also\nforwarded from London under cover, another letter purporting to be\ndictated by Mrs. Plowden. The object of this letter was to charge me to use\nfor the book I had just edited a preface which she herself had written, instead\nof one of my own composition ; and a copy of which I should find in a\ncertain place in the room which had been her study. The particulars given\nwere correct, with the exception that the word ' school-room ' was used for\n'study.' As it happened, I had already made use of the preface in\nquestion, having set aside one that I had commenced writing, under a strong\nimpression that in so doing I was acting as she would have preferred had she\nbeen consulted. The book, moreover, had actually been published, so that\nthe instruction now received came too late to be observed. From which it\nwas clear that her knowledge of my doings was not fully up-to-date.\n\" The letters thus dictated showed a gradual and increasing assimilation\nof the medium's handwriting to that of Mrs. Plowden. But the envelope\ncontaining the last one was addressed in a hand which was not merely like\nMrs. Plowden's, but was hers, and was written with great freedom, clearness,\nand firmness, and as if dashed off at speed, only with a somewhat coarser pen\nthan she was wont to use, the strokes being thicker as through the effort of\nusing another's hand, and all the characteristics were hers and not in the least\nthe medium's.1 It was accompanied by a letter from Mrs. Laurence,\ndescribing the sensation in her hand when writing as that of being con\ntrolled by some pervading substance which, while strong and firm, was soft\nand impalpable. This was a description which tallied exactly with that\nwhich other mediums had described to me, and which I myself had expe\nrienced on the single occasion when it had been considered desirable to give\nme a practical example of the method of ' automatic writing,' though in my\ncase my own consciousness was not set aside, the words being presented to\nmy mind when being written.\"\nMrs. Seddon proceeds to describe the disquieting effect upon the\nrelative to whom the second letter was addressed of the close resem\nblance to the handwriting of the deceased. The subject being dis\ntasteful to this relative, no corroboration can be sought in that quarter.\nIn a subsequent letter Mrs. Seddon says : \" The full description,\nwritten through the medium, of the place of the MSS. in question is\n' the drawer at the left-hand side of the window-seat where I once put\nthem long ago.' This was a receptacle which stood by Mrs. Plowden's\naccustomed seat in her study, and in which I had found the preface\nreferred to. The study may have been called the schoolroom [at a\nprevious period]. My own impression is that intending to say ' study,'\nthe controlling influence succeeded only in impressing a corresponding\nword on the medium, and was content with it as understanding what\nroom was meant. . . . No reference to or mention of a window-seat\n1 I have seen the envelope and compared the handwritings. I think the statement\nin the text too strong ; but there is much resemblance ;\u2014and undoubtedly Mrs.\nLaurence's envelope bears the impress of speed and confidence.\u2014F.W.H.M.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 117\nhad occurred anywhere until the phrase was used in Mrs. Laurence's\nmessage.\"\nI hold it as certain that Mrs. Laurence had never visited K., nor had\nshe ever heard of the window-seat and the drawer. Of this, I repeat, she\nhas completely satisfied me ; nor indeed would it have been in any way\nlikely that she should have known of these details. She had not\nknown that Mrs. Seddon had hesitated between two prefaces, and\nalthough she knew that the book was out, she had not specially noticed\nthe preface, and cannot now recollect whether she had or had not\nread it. The degree both of knowledge and of ignorance shown in the\nautomatic message is therefore noteworthy. There was knowledge of\na very specific place\u2014left-hand drawer of a vnndoiv-seat. Against this\nmust be set the minor mistake of school-room for study, but here I\nthink that Mrs. Seddon's explanation is in accordance with analogy.\nOn the other hand, we have ignorance of a fact fully known to Mrs.\nPlowden, and partially known to Mrs. Laurence, namely, that the book\nhad already appeared with the desired preface. The message, there\nfore, is not exactly like ihe product of either living mind, and does\nsomewhat resemble that which might be sent by someone remembering\npast facts, imperfectly acquainted with recent facts, and feeling a strong\npersonal interest in the matter.\nAn interesting corroboration is furnished to this case by a previous\nexperience of Miss A.'s, quite unknown to Mrs. Laurence, who is not\nacquainted with the A. family. I copy the following passage from the\noriginal notes taken by Mrs. A. at the time of the incident,\u2014shortly after\nMrs. Plowden's death. [\"We knew,\" writes Mrs. A., \" thatMrs. Plowden\nwas dead ; but did not personally then know Mrs. Seddon ; and there\nhad not been any special conversation respecting Mrs. Plowden.\"] One of\nMiss A.'s accustomed \" guides,\" giving the name of \" E. Swedenborg,\"\nwrote : \" I want, through you, to fulfil a promise which I have given to\none very dear to me ; one who drew me to her through her kindly and\nunselfish influences ; one whom I helped to the best of my ability while\nthe beautiful spirit was yet chained to earth. I speak of her whom I\nknew best as ' Naomi,' but whom you would only recognise under the\nname of ' Mrs. Plowden.' ... I would for her sake have those\nto know from whom she has parted in bodily form that she is but\nremoved to a higher sphere of action, there to await those who worked\nwith her on earth.\"\nThe evidential point here is the name which I have given as\n\" Naomi,\"\u2014the correlative to the \" Ruth \" which appears in Mrs.\nLaurence's letter. The A family, who alone were present when the\nabove writing was given, all of them feel sure that they had never\nheard that this name was ever given to Mrs. Plowden.\n\f118 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\"As far as I can see by my notes,\" continues Mrs. A., \"we did not\nmeet Mrs. Seddon till [some months later]. Like many other messages,\nwe did not like to send it to the person it concerned ; but it was given\nto her at last by a mutual friend, and she came to see us.\" There was\nthen much writing, which Mrs. Seddon considers as so specially\nappropriate in content as much to strengthen the proof of identity.\nShe also states that \" Swedenborg \" had influenced Mrs. Plowden in life\nin a similar manner\u2014\"a fact of which no one knew but ourselves.\"\nOn the degree of proof which such coincidences of thougJit can afford,\nI may have to speak in a later paper. The point to which I here call\nattention is the appearance of the two private names through two\nautomatists entirely independent of each other. In one case the private\nname was unknown to the automatist, in the other case the name had\nbeen heard, but another fact, unknown to the automatist, was given in\nthe same connection.\nI will now place together four cases where a leading point of\ninterest is the writing of words which the automatist could not have\nwritten by conscious effort. In one case an unlettered man wrote\nGreek ; in one a girl ignorant of Kaffir wrote Kaffir ; and in the two\nother cases a young child who had not learnt to write, wrote, we are\ntold, legible and significant words.\nIn the first case of this group the phenomena were various, but con\nsisted mainly of automatic writing and speech. Some of the writings\nevinced a knowledge greater than the automatist possessed. Especially,\ntwo lines from Homer were correctly written in response to a request\nfor some Greek, although the writer was certainly quite ignorant even\nof the Greek alphabet. Some indications of identity were also given.\nCertain physical phenomena (the most important of which occurred\nin my informant's absence) were interpolated as it were at random\namong the intellectual phenomena, and carried with them no clear\nindication of their source ; except that they occurred only in the\npresence of the sitter, here styled Mr. Andrew.\nFor my introduction to Mr. O. (as I shall call him), the narrator of\nthese incidents, I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Andrew Lang.\nI first heard Mr. O.'s narrative from himself by word of mouth on\nNovember 20th, 1889, while the events were still fresh in his memory.\nI regard him as an excellent witness. The delay in producing the\nevidence has been partly caused by Mr. O.'s persistent but unavailing\nefforts to induce the survivors among his fellow-sitters to add their\ntestimony to his own. I have reason to believe that their refusal is in\nno way due to any disagreement with Mr. O.'s account, but mainly to\nscruples of a quasi-religious nature. Such scruples have repeatedly\nbaulked our inquiries ; but I hope that they may gradually die out\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 119\namong our informants, as the innocence and the importance of experi\nments of this kind come to be better understood. In Mr. O.'s own case\nthere are, I think, amply sufficient reasons why his anonymity should\nbe preserved. His brother\u2014in deference to whose serious wish during\ndangerous illness the sittings were undertaken\u2014is now dead.\nI will add that the intimacy among the members of the circle was\nsuch that I cannot doubt that Mr. O. heard, without delay, from his\nbrother and others, of the physical phenomena which had occurred\nduring his own absence from the circle. Mr. O. writes in 1890 :\u2014\nS. 11.\u2014In the winter of '88-9 I began, along with a few intimate friends,\nto investigate the phenomena commonly called Spiritualistic. None of the\ncompany was at all anxious for any specific communication from another\nsphere, but partly for the gratification of an invalid brother, and partly for\nthe sake of satisfying ourselves as to the possibility of some things we had\nread, we attempted a sitting. The results far exceeded our expectation.\nWe were favoured with phenomena somewhat startling to novices in the art\n\u2014phenomena styled in Scotland uncanny\u2014but their interesting nature soon\novercame our natural diffidence, and before the end of the winter we were\non quite familiar terms with our unsubstantial visitants.\nAs a rule the circle consisted of two of my brothers, two personal friends,\nand myself, though occasionally we admitted other members of the family,\nand once or twice an acquaintance. We were not Spiritualists, nor had we\nany desire to be known as such : all we did was done solely by way of experi\nment and amusement. The opportunity was the best possible : we had all\nour sittings in our own home, the circle was confined to personal friends in\nwhom we had full confidence, so that there was neither motive nor oppor\ntunity for deception. We usually met twice a week when my invalid brother\nwas able for company, but during the winter months relapses of his illness\ncaused interruptions ; and indeed, I often thought the excitement of our\nsittings did not affect him beneficially.\nOur sittings were all in the dark. Our medium was, in most cases, Mr.\nAndrew, though we had also a less efficient medium in the case of Mr.\nS . The performances of the latter were mostly of a somnambulistic\nkind, and do not call for special notice.\nWith Andrew, however, phenomena assumed quite another aspect. He\nwould play charming music on the violin, or produce beautiful pencil sketches\nof city and rural scenes. Sometimes the locus of these scenes was named,\noftener not, but they were invariably unknown to any member of the company.\nFor a time I failed to see anything very unaccountable in Andrew's trance\nproductions. I knew him to be an accomplished violinist and a fairly good\nsketcher, and I naturally put everything down to an unconscious exercise of\nhis own skilL One little thing did perplex me, namely, the very different\nstyles of handwriting he seemed to accomplish with equal facility.\nI mentioned an invalid brother. He suffered from a heart affection\nknown as presystolic murmur. At one sitting we consulted a medical man,\nwho called himself Dr. Snobinski of Russia. This gentleman not only pre\nscribed for my brother, but also furnished us with a diagram of the human\nheart, and put a special mark to indicate the valve diseased in my brother's\n\f120 Mr. F. W. If. Myers.\ncase. How this diagram was accurately drawn by a person ignorant of\nhuman physiology, and how the diseased valve was shown and explained by\none ignorant of pathology, was more than I could account for.\nOn another occasion another doctor, calling himself Arnold, confirmed the\ndiagnosis of Dr. Snobinski, and rated my brother for having neglected to\nfollow the regimen recommended by the famous Russian. On this occasion,\nduring examination of the chest, when the patient chanced to laugh, the\ndoctor [in the person of Mr. Andrew] suddenly gave him a mild box on the\near with his open palm. This I understood was to rebuke his laughter,\nwhich, as is well known, is a dangerous luxury to one suffering from valvular\ndisease.\nAt times we were entertained by a negro, who gave us no little fun. His\neffort to speak English was most amusing, and presented just those difficul\nties which perplex the negro in this more matter-of-fact sphere.\nThese phenomena had led me to perplexing thoughts, and, though unable\nto explain them on purely psychological grounds, I was slow to admit that\nthe medium was not also the cause of the effects he produced. I had so far\naccounted for the music and the sketches ; the varieties of handwriting were\na little puzzling, the diagram and the prescription a little more so, but I was\nstill inclined to suspend judgment till I should acquire more facts. With a\nview to this, I one evening interrogated : \" Where are you ? \" Answer : \"In\nthe sphere next the earth.\" \"Could you tell anything of the future?\"\nAnswer: \"We are as ignorant of the future as you are.\" This I thought\nwas at least honest, and very probable, but too general to be of service to me\nin arriving at any decision. I resolved to put what seemed to me a searching\ntest. None of the others knew Latin or Greek, so I asked an answer in\nLatin. This was readily given, but so badly spelt that I failed to fully\ntranslate it. Not yet satisfied, I asked any quotation from a Greek author-\nso that by comparison with the original, identity or variation might be satis\nfactorily apparent. This resulted in a quotation from the Odyssey, Bk. XL,\nlines 57-8 :\u2014\n'EXinjvop, nS>s %\\6fs vn'o \u00a3cxpov r1tpdtvra ;\nt(pdr1s it(\u00a3c>s (&>v r\\ (y\u00a3> triiv vrit fu\\aivj1.\nThese lines were beautifully written in cursive characters, and minute even\nto the accents. As a student I had read Odyssey XL, but could not have\ngiven the lines from memory, or written them out with correct accents. On\ncomparing the lines with the Greek text I found them to be without flaw.\nMy puzzle was now twofold : (1) That I was not able to read the Latin\nproved that what was given was not anything I had previously been\nrevolving in my own mind, but had come from an independent intelligence ;\n(2) The medium was not acquainted with either Latin or Greek\u2014did not know\none from the other. Clearly I must now quit the hypothesis that the\nmedium was the author of his own message, as not adequate to account for\nall the facts.\nThe Greek and the Latin [Mr. O. adds in a later letter] were both\nobtained at the same sitting. I asked for the Greek because the Latin was\nso badly written I could not fully make it out. The medium that evening\nwas Andrew, who, I am fully convinced, could not possibly have any know\nledge that Greek would be asked for\u2014and even if he had known, he could\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 121\nnot have given it, since he did not know the Greek when it was given. The\ncontrolling spirit was unknown to any of the company. In reply to my\nquestions he described himself as a youth of nineteen, according to their\nreckoning, but was only twelve years of age when he died. When I asked\nhow he was occupied, he told us he was still at school. This information led\nme to ask for the Latin, and subsequently for the Greek.\nStill more inexplicable was the evidential sign given to a doubting\nacquaintance. This gentleman requested permission to be present at one of\nthe sittings, but his general behaviour there indicated that he regarded a\nsitting as a kind of farce. He brought with him another gentleman of\nequally sceptical temper. The first remark from the medium that evening\nwas: \"There are strangers present to-night.\" This remark seemed to our\nfriend so commonplace that he requested evidence of the presence of a spirit.\nOn being asked what evidence he would like, he jokingly said, \"Bring a\ncandle ! \"\u2014an idea probably suggested by sitting in the dark. The wish had\nscarcely been expressed when a candle was placed on the table before him,\nwith the request that he should immediately quit the company. The candle\nwas found to be warm, a circumstance explained by the fact that it had been\nused in the next room only a few minutes before. My brother immediately\nwent to the next room, and asked for a candle. The good lady was much\nsurprised to find that while the candlestick was still standing where she had\nplaced it shortly before, the candle itself was gone. My brother then showed\nher the candle which he held in his hand, and this she identified as the\none she had used a few minutes before\u2014indeed there could not be two\nopinions, as there was only one candle in the house. This was regarded by\nthe circle as the most wonderful result yet obtained. Here was proof\namounting to a demonstration that a material object had been passed through\nmatter ; the candle had been brought from one room to another, though both\ndoors (there were two doors in the room in which the sittings were held)\nwere locked before the sitting was commenced.\nThis candle incident I give on the testimony of the others, as I myself\nwas not present that evening, a circumstance which I afterwards regretted.\nPersonally I have not seen a case of matter through matter.\nDuring that winter we obtained many interesting phenomena. The\nspirits (?) would strike any note we asked on a violin or harmonium which\nstood by. The notes requested would sound forth distinctly, though no\nvisible hand was near ; and this was done both in the dark and in the light,\nthough more often in the dark.\nOne evening a visitant addressed one of my brothers as an old school\nfellow, and in proof of his identity he reminded my brother of a poem they\nhad once learnt together as boys, namely, one by \" Surfaceman \" (Alexander\nAnderson), entitled \" The blood mi the w)ieel.\" My brother perfectly recol\nlected the exercise, and had no doubt as to the identity of the speaker. The\nwonderful thing here was that the medium had become acquainted with my\nbrother later in life, and had no knowledge of his schooldays.\nOf the scientific value of these results I was not aware till I had the\npleasure of meeting yourself, and if we had met some months earlier I should\ncertainly have preserved the legible results of our sittings. They were\ndestroyed in ignorance of their scientific worth, and chiefly because associated\n\f122 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwith a departed brother whose early death we still lament. Though our\nsittings are long past their results still dwell with me in all but their first\nfreshness. Circumstances conspired to break up our little company. Of\nour circle of five two have since married, one has left the district, and\nanother has departed this life. The death of our most spirited member was\nthe end of our meetings.\nOn the \" telekinetic phenomena \" involved in this case I must not\nhere dwell. The case of Mr. Stainton Moses, with which I hope to\ndeal later, will afford a better opportunity for discussing the relations,\nbetween automatism and telekinesis.\nThe next case came to Dr. Hodgson from a group of persons who\nmay not be. very critical, but who are plainly sincere. The pheno\nmenon alleged, however surprising, involves but a simple act of\nobservation and should have been easy to note and remember.\nM. Aut. 70.\nFlushing, Jvly 19th, 1890.\nMe. Richard Hodgson.\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014It affords me pleasure to respond to your inquiry concern\ning the item of spirit writing through the hand of a little child just four\nyears of age who had no knowledge of its letters, unaided and untaught.\n\"My wife had a niece who passed to spirit-life twenty years ago, who was\nin life strongly attached to her, and whenever we come in contact with a\nmediumistic person she invariably makes her presence known to us. My\ndaughter, fifteen years of age, and another young lady of the same age,\nopened a school for small children in a little room used for a Sunday-school\nby the Baptist society, where the event took place. It was approaching\nEaster, and to add to the coming exercises, the little girl was especially in\nvited to join them in rehearsing their pieces, as most all the pupils were\nmembers of the Mission Sunday-school. The first morning of her attend\nance a slate and pencil were given her to keep her quiet ; she scribbled\nawhile, when it was noticed that she had written very distinctly the name\nEmma. As it was known that the child had never been inside of a school\nbefore, and that she knew no single letter of the alphabet, it was a great\nsurprise. The slate belonged to some of the pupils, hence was not preserved\nby the young ladies.

Myers.\nand ' Emma ' on the first and second sheets ; Emma being written\ntolerably well on the second sheet.\n\" The enclosed tracing is of the last attempt.\"\n[An account (seen by me and concordant with the above) had been sent\nby Mr. Hempstead to the Banner of Light immediately after the incident,\nand was printed May 4th, 1889. I have seen the tracing of the last written\nphrase, \"your aunt Emma.\" It is a free scrawl, resembling the planchette-\nwriting of an adult rather than the first effort of a child.\u2014F.W.H.M.l\nI know not in what light I should have regarded my next case\nhad I seen it only in a book bearing the somewhat alarming title of\nThe Holy Truth, (Arthur Hallah, 1876). But just as my last-cited\nnarrative is not necessarily proved to be fictitious by having once\nappeared in that not over-trustworthy periodical, Tlie Banner of LiglU,\nso also the aggressiveness of religious conviction with which Mr. Hugh\nJunor Browne's experiences have inspired him does not prevent his\nbeing, as I have heard from the Hon. Sir W. G. Windeyer, Judge\nof Supreme Court, Sydney, and have found on personal acquaintance,\na man of high standing as to both character and practical capacity.\nHe is a prosperous man of business at Melbourne, and the elder of the\ntwo daughters with whose automatism we have to deal is married to\none of the foremost men of the Colony of Victoria. I regard him,\ntherefore, as a witness whose strong opinions, indeed, might help a\nfraudulent medium to deceive him, but who is fully to be trusted as\nregards easily-observed events occurring in his own family circle. I\ndiscussed this case with him and Mrs. Browne on October 3rd, 1891.\nMrs. Browne seemed to me a good witness, and corroborated the facts\nso far as immediately known to her, giving me a written confirmation\nof the writing of the young child, who was present at our interview,\nas a young lady of about twenty. Miss Browne cannot remember\nthe incident in her fifth year, but told me that she had sometimes\nwritten automatically since that date ;\u2014her arm used to feel numb\nwhile doing so.\nM. Aut. 71.\n\" In this [automatic writing] we were unsuccessful, until it came to the\nturn of my eldest daughter, a girl of eleven years of age, to take the pencil\nin hand. Immediately on her doing so her hand was influenced to write,\ncausing her to be considerably alarmed. She called out, ' Oh, mamma ! I\nam so frightened, my hand is moving.' We all pacified her as much as pos\nsible, and on taking up the paper we found her hand had written on it quite\nlegibly, though in rather tremulous characters, quite different from her\nordinary writing, the following sentence : ' Helen, Grace, Browne, I am\ncome to see you. Your beloved aunt. You will,' &c., &c. The remainder\nof the writing was too faint to decipher. The name written above is that of\nmy second daughter, between five and six years of age, who is called after\ntwo of her aunts, my sisters ; one of whom, the wife of an officer in the\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 125\nIndian army, passed away many years ago, having died on her passage home\nfrom India, and whose spirit we afterwards ascertained influenced the girl's\nhand to write this message to her little niece and namesake. We had a\nnumber of communications through the same source that evening from\ndifferent spirit-friends, and since that time, except on two occasions, when\nshe said she felt no influence (a reason for which afterwards was given)\nwhenever my eldest girl sits down for the purpose of communicating with\nour spirit-friends, her hand is almost immediately influenced to write. Her\nhand has written as many as forty pages of large notepaper within half-\nan-hour, which in her ordinary handwriting would take her several hours\nto copy.\n\" My daughter is quite unaware of what she is writing and describes the\nsensation of the influence as though electricity were running down her arm\nfrom the shoulder. This is what is termed mechanical writing medium-\nship. She often writes far beyond her own powers of comprehension on\nsubjects of which she has not the least conception, spelling words correctly\nwhich she does not understand, and of which, when read over, she inquires\nthe meaning\u2014such words as clairvoyantly, physically, &c. At other times\nshe spells small words incorrectly which in her ordinary writing she would\nspell correctly. She has written in French, of which language she knows\nbut the rudiments ; she has written in Chinese characters, and also in the\nKaffir language, of neither of which does she understand a word. She has\nwritten in blank verse, which, though it would not stand the scrutiny of a\ncritic, is decidedly beyond her powers hi this line, she being more of a\nromp than a student.\n\" My daughter has frequently been influenced to write messages to\nstrangers from their spirit-friends, giving them particulars about things of\nwhich she could not possibly know anything, and signing correctly the\nnames of their spirit-friends in spirit-life of whom she had never before\nheard. Her mother and I have thought of a question, to put to one of our\nspirit-friends when she was not present, and calling her into the room have\ngiven her a pencil and paper, and she has written a correct reply to the\nquestion mentally asked, and signed the name of the spirit-friend of whom\nwe thought. She can write either looking away from or on to the paper. A\ndifference can be seen in the writing from each of our spirit-friends. If I\nsee even the word ' yea ' written through her, I can generally tell what\nspirit is influencing the medium's hand. I have seen her write the letters\nupside down, backwards, left-handed, and in various ways quite impossible\nfor the child to do herself, and sometimes so fast you can hardly see her\nhand join the letters, and at other times slow ; sometimes in a very small\nhand, at others in bold text-writing.\n\" On one occasion it was written through my daughter's hand that I was\nto take a bottle of a specific I have for rheumatism to a Mr. Reed, directing\nme to inquire at a shop in the next street to where he used to live and I\nwould be directed to where he then resided. I had formerly given a man of\nthis name some of this mixture, which had relieved him of the pain, but had\nnot seen or heard of him for months, and I was not aware that he had\nremoved from where he then lived. On calling at his former residence I\nfound he had removed, and on calling as instructed at the shop indicated I\n\f126 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nwas told where Reed then lived. I found him confined to his bed, suffering\nacutely from rheumatism, and gave him the specific.\n\"I may mention another incident which occurred. One day when out\nwalking with my wife I met a black man whom I had never seen before, but\nwhom I recognised as a Kaffir from large holes made in his ears peculiar to\nthat race. I accosted him in his native tongue, at which he seemed rather\nsurprised, and I gave him my address, telling him to call on me. This he\ndid just as we were sitting down to investigate this subject. I told the\nservant to show him into the room, and on asking him if any of his spirit-\nfriends were present, my daughter's hand wrote out several Kaffir names,\nwhich on my reading out to him he recognised, and which evidently caused\nhim great astonishment. On asking if they had any message for him, a\nsentence was written in the Kaffir language, some of the words of which\nwere beyond my comprehension. On my reading the message out to the\nKaffir he understood every word of it except one. This I pronounced in\nvarious ways to try to make him comprehend, but all to no purpose, when my\ndaughter's hand was influenced to write 'Click with the mouth.' This\nreminded me of a peculiar click which frequently accompanies the sounding\nof the letter ' T ' in the Kaffir language, and on my pronouncing this word\nhe understood the meaning of it at once. I may state my daughter does not\nknow a word of Kaffir, having been born several years after I was last in\nthat country. I inquired who influenced her hand to write, as the art of\nwriting is generally unknown to Kaffirs, and was informed my old friend\nH. S., whose native name was ' Nonquambeen,' had written the message\nat the request of the Kaffir's spirit-friends. I may add H. S. was a well-\neducated man, whose memory I hold in regard, and who when in this life\ncould talk the Kaffir language fairly, having been an old settler in Natal.\nI explained to my Kaffir visitor that the Insleseea,or souls of his friends,were\npresent, at which he seemed rather terrified. I assured him there were\nnumbers of my spirit-friends present also, and that my children frequently\ndescribed both the spirits of my friends and of some of his countrymen who\nwere in my employ, and others whom I knew many years ago. This only\nseemed to increase his fear. I think I have referred to Chinese having been\nwritten through my daughter's hand imperfectly, and on my remarking that\nI did not think it was like the Chinese characters, I was informed by one of\nmy Anglican spirit-friends that it was the first time the Chinese spirit had\ninfluenced a medium to write, and that he would improve by practice. On\nshowing it to a Chinese (there were thirteen or fourteen pages of it) he could\nnot make out many of the characters, but here and there he said, ' That\nmeans sound,' ' That means twenty, ' and so on, and remarked, 'This like\nlittle China boy's writing, not know write good.'\n\"One day, while receiving communications through my daughter's hand, I\nobserved written, ' Put down that balloon.' I remarked to my wife, 'What\non earth have they to do with balloons in spirit-life ? ' She smiled, and told\nme that our daughter had in her left hand one of those pink india-rubber toy\nballoons, which she, childlike, had been trymg to inflate with her breath\nwhilst her right hand was writing the communications. I was sitting on the\nmedium's right-hand side, and was so interested in the communications as\nwritten that I had not taken notice what she was doing with her left hand.\n\fThe Subliminal Consciousness. 127\non which side my wife sat. At another time, in reply to a query by me on\nsome deep theological matter, through my daughter's hand it was written,\n' How can you expect an ans wer to such a question through a child's\norganisation 1 ' I have several reams of paper filled with communications\nreceived through my daughter's hand.\" (The Holy Truth, pp. 63-71.)\nThe incident of the child's writing is given in the same book (p. 71),\nbeing then of quite recent date. I will, however, give here the account,\nof course much later, but concordant, and in some points fuller, which\nwas given to me at the interview above mentioned.\nM. Aut. 72.\n' ' When our daughter Nelly was nearly five years old, she had not learned\na single letter of her alphabet. She had certainly received no instruction\nwhatever. One day her elder sister was writing automatically. To please\nthe child, we put a pencil in her hand. Presently we observed that she had\nwritten some words, and on looking we saw that the words were ' I am a mes\nmeric medium.' [Words 'I am a' not present in earlier account.] She\nhad been under our eyes all the time. The words were written in a small\nangular lady's handwriting. I then asked my elder daughter's 'guide,'\nthe late Dr. Godfrey Howitt, to explain this. Instead of the accustomed\nwriting, a message came in the writing of my elder sister, the late\nMrs. Colonel Kelso, to the effect : [here I give the correct wording as in\nearlier record] ' She will be very mediumistic, but is too young to be in\nfluenced ; do not let her sit until she is older, or you will injure her\nhealth.' We did not let her write automatically for some years afterwards ;\nthen she did write for some little time, and then the power left her.\n\" Hogh Junob Browne.\n\" October 3rd, 1891.\" \" Elizabeth Browne.\nI must here close for the present my budget of evidence. In spite\nof repeated limitations of the subject proposed for this paper, I have\nbeen unable within my limits to deal adequately with any one group of\nmotor messages. Of the class last touched upon, indeed,\u2014alleged\ncommunications from the departed,\u2014I have already in other papers\npublished several examples. Some of those have pointed, as some of\nthese fresh narratives do also point, towards a direct transmission from\na personality still vividly concerned with the loves and deeds of earth.\nOther cases, especially in this present group, suggest something of less\npersonal intercourse, as though the communion were rather of man's\nown incarnate spirit with some vaster knowledge existing somewhere\nbeyond his earthly ken.\nBut indeed the question, \"Can I communicate with a departed\nsoul 1 \" can seem simple only in so far as it is imperfectly understood. At\neach end of that desired communication lies a group of problems which\nonly darken beneath our steadier gaze. Suppose that an inhabitant of\nsome other world were to ask me, \" Can you communicate with other\nmen, and if so, with which men 1 \" what should my answer be ? Can\n\f128 Mr. F. W. H.

Yet it was memory and character\u2014\nthe stored impressions upon which he reacted, and his specific mode of re\naction\u2014which made our veritable friend. How much of memory, how\nmuch of character must he preserve for our recognition ? We do not\nask that he or we should remember always, or should remember all.\nIt would suffice us if, as Plato has it, the potential memory of an\nendless Past, lost for awhile in each dreamlike incarnation, should\nrevive in intercurrent spaces of absolute Being.

Yet, if only for the sake\nof historical completeness, it seems worth while to set forth in a short\narticle the absolute futility, in my judgment, of the appeals against\nthat verdict which have been thus far made. With the death of\nMadame Blavatsky the whole discussion has lost much of its interest,\nbut what I have now to say may still be taken as tending in a certain\nsense to the glorification of that lost leader, as showing how judicious\nwas the boldness with which she speculated on human gullibility ;\u2014\nhow sage was her conviction that with the populus qui vull decipi no\nsuch trifles as facts or figures will long be allowed to stand in the way.\nIn the expiring number (March, 1891) of the monthly magazine\nTime, Mrs. Annie Besant made an attack upon my Report on\nPhenomena connected with the Theosophical Society published in\nVol. III. of our Proceedings. Were I satisfied that the reader of\nMrs. Besant's article would consult my original Report for the purpose\nof seeing how far her statements were justified, I would leave the\nquestion as it stands. This, however, is hardly to be expected, and it\nseems to me desirable that I should myself, as briefly as possible, point\nout the chief mistakes made by Mrs. Besant, referring my readers for\nadditional details to the specific passages concerned in my original\nReport.\nFurther, Mr. Sinnett, in the Revieiv of Reviews for June, 1891, has\nrepeated some statements which he had previously made as to the\nmethod of my investigations,\u2014and to which I replied at the time in\nthe Journal S.P.R. for November, 1885. My reply notwithstanding,\nwhich concerns matters of fact easily verifiable by any intelligent\nperson, Mr. Sinnett has chosen to repeat these statements on more than\none occasion, without making any reference whatever to my reply, and\nK\n\f130 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nas our Journal is not readily accessible to the public I shall repeat my\nreply here.\nI shall also take this opportunity to notice some other statements\nmade by Mr. Sinnett in 1886, not long after the publication of my\noriginal Report (December, 1885), and which I thought at that time\nscarcely needed any fresh consideration. I refer to the pamphlet\nentitled The \" Occult World Phenomena,\" and the Societyfor Psychical\nResearch, and the volume entitled Incidents in the Life of Madame\nBlavatsky.\nI shall first ask the reader's attention to some general charges\nmade originally by Mr. Sinnett,\u2014and partly repeated since by Mrs.\nBesant,\u2014to which I replied some years ago in the Journal S.P.R.\nMrs. Besant speaks of my \" English ignorance of Hindu thought \"\nand \" English contempt for Hindu veracity,\" and regards the Hindu\nrace apparently as one \"that to guard its holy things from the insolent\nforeigner will deny point-blank a belief that will be frankly acknow\nledged among sympathisers.\" Mr. Sinnett makes a similar suggestion\nin his pamphlet on The \" Occult World Phenomena,\" &c. (pp. 5-7) ;\nand he has made other charges, which he repeats, in the Review of\nReviews, p. 556. Referring to my investigations he says : \" That\ngentleman never sought her [Madame Blavatsky's] explanations of the\n,circumstances he thought suspicious, never showed her the originals of\nthe letters on which the whole accusation turned, and disguised his\nunfavourable conclusions while staying as a guest at the Theosophical\nheadquarters.\" Now I cannot suppose that Mr. Sinnett did not see\nmy reply to some of these suggestions which he circulated among the\nmembers of the S.P.R. in the form of a letter dated October 12th,\n1885, addressed to the editor of Light; and his repetition of these\n,charges\u2014ignoring both my own reply made at the time and some\nstatements made still earlier by Professor Sidgwick\u2014indicates that\nhis excess of zeal on behalf of Madame Blavatsky is leading him\ninto actions which to the \" Western \" mind, \" unfamiliar with India\nand Indian ways,\" seem somewhat questionable.1 I am under the\nimpression\u2014subject to Mr. Sinnett's correction if I am wrong\u2014that\n1 Mr. F. \\V. H. Myers, in a letter to the Review of Reviews for July, 1891, called\nattention to another statement by Mr. Sinnett which \"suggested an inference at\n\u2022variance with fact.\" Mr. Myers wrote in reply: \"'At first,' says Mr. Sinnett, 'the\nleaders of the S.P.R. undoubtedly accepted Mr. Hodgson's views.' If it is intended\nto suggest that the members of the Committee who inquired into those alleged\nmarvels have since that date in any way modified their condemnatory judgment, that\nsuggestion is absolutely without foundation. I have not, indeed, encountered any\nmember of our Society who, having studied the evidence contained in Part IX. of our\nProceedings (published by Triibner in 1885, and to be had of any bookseller), has found\nhis judgment in any degree affected by any of the so-called replies, or protestations\nof innocence, which have as yet been given to the public.\"\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 131\nsome leading Theosophists, on seeing the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters,1\ntook refuge in the explanation (broached by one of the \" Mahatmas \" 1 )\nthat they were forgeries perpetrated by Black Magicians, and I\nsuppose that Mr. Sinnett was anxious to obtain an expression of\nMadame Blavatsky's opinion, from some occult point of view, upon the\nauthorship of the letters. Otherwise it is difficult to see what light\nshe could possibly throw on the subject by inspection of the originals.\nFrom the Theosophists' point of view Madame Blavatsky was not an ex\npert in handwriting; from the point of view of the Editor of the Madras\nChristian College Magazine, in whose possession the letters were, she\nwas an unscrupulous intriguer who would not hesitate to use any oppor\ntunity that she might get of tampering with the letters in question. Had\nthe letters been in my own exclusive possession, I should have felt com\npelled to exercise great care to prevent Madame Blavatsky's obtaining\nany such opportunity. But the letters were not mine, and I had no\npermission to show them to Madame Blavatsky even had she asked\nme to do so, as she did not ; doubtless because she was well aware\nthat I had no such control over them. All this and more I sufficiently\nindicated in my letter to the Journal S.P.R., November, 1885,\u2014\u2022\nwhich, as I have said above, I cannot suppose that Mr. Sinnett has\nnot seen.\nThe following is an extract from my letter :\u2014\nIn the first place I had no authority to show these letters to Madame\nBlavatsky, and Madame Blavatsky well knew that I had none. She\nfrequently asked me whether I had seen the letters myself, and she knew\nthat a considerable time had elapsed before I had an opportunity of doing\nso, in consequence of the absence from Madras of the Editor of the Christian\nCollege Magazine; and when I was first enabled to inspect them, I spoke\nto her of certain restrictions which were placed\u2014I think quite rightly\u2014\nupon my use of them. Several of them I had in my own possession for\na day or two only, for my own examination. The remaining ones I\nexamined in the house of a gentleman in whose custody they were at the\ntime, and two groups of them were eventually entrusted to me for the specific\npurpose of being sent to England for the judgment of the best caligraphic\nexperts obtainable here (a fact of which I did not think it necessary to\ninform Madame Blavatsky), under the particular condition that they should\nbe returned as soon as possible ; and they were actually sent back to India\nbefore my arrival in England. Those which I had in my own posssesion\nfor a short time I was requested not to take on my own responsibility\nto the headquarters of the Theosophical Society, the Editor of the Christian\n1 It will be remembered that these were the documents adduced in support of\ntheir charge of fraud against Madame Blavatsky by M. and Madame Coulomb, who\nhad been attached to the Theosophical Society for several years in positions of trust,\nM. and Madame Coulomb alleged\u2014correctly, as investigation showed,\u2014that these\ndocuments were written by Madame Blavatsky and afforded clear proof of trickery\non her part. I have quoted from some of them in my Report, pp. 211-219.\nK 2\n\f132 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nCollege Magazine being naturally apprehensive that Madame Blavatsky\nmight seize an opportunity of tampering with them. 1 In the second place,\nMadame Blavatsky had explicitly pronounced certain portions of them to\nbe forgeries, when they were first published, and I should be surprised to\nlearn that she had ever expressed any wish to see the originals while I was at\nMadras. Had she done so, I have no doubt that some arrangement would\nhave been made according to which she would have had the liberty of\ninspecting them in the presence of witnesses. That T do not say this\nunadvisedly is sufficiently shown by the fact that some of the disputed\nletters were taken to the headquarters of the Society and shown to\nTheosophists, in September, 1884, in consequence of a request by Major-\nGeneral Morgan to seo the letter in which he was concerned. The Editor\nof the Christian College Magazine writes in the number for April, 1885 :\u2014\n\"We took with us to headquarters four of the disputed letters, and\nfreely allowed all present to examine them. In return we asked to be\npermitted to see some of Madame Blavatsky's recent letters to Dr. Hartmann,\nDamodar, or anyone at headquarters. This request was complied with only\nto the extent of showing us a portion of a letter written from Paris. Xo\nThbosophist has ever asked to see any other letter, or his request\nwould have been, under proper precautions, at once complied with.\"\nI have no doubt that what the editor of the magazine quoted says\nis true, and that Madame Blavatsky never requested permission to\nsee the letters. In the face of these explanations of mine, but with\nout making any reference to them, Mr. Sinnett repeats the statement\nthat I never showed Madame Blavatsky the originals of the letters in\ndispute,\u2014a statement quite true in itself, but introduced by Mr.\nSinnett in a way distinctly and apparently intentionally calculated to\nmislead the reader concerning the actual circumstances.\nIn what way my alleged ignorance of the natives operated I am\nsomewhat at a loss to conceive, and I may here quote another passage\nfrom my letter (Journal S.P.R., November, 1885) in reply to Mr.\nSinnett :\u2014\nHe speaks of my \" unfamiliarity with India and Indian ways \" as having\nled me \"into many serious mistakes.\" Of course I do not claim the\nfamiliarity with India which Mr. Sinnett possesses, but I do not see how\nthis fact can affect my investigation in the way Mr. Sinnett seems to\nsuppose. He may, indeed, mean that I ought not to have been surprised to\nfind that certain chelas told mo deliberate falsehoods, and that had I been\nmore familiar with Indian ways I should have known that such falsehoods\nwere the natural outcome of \"Occultism.\" This I am not concerned to\ndispute ; but if he means that my unfamiliarity with India and Indian ways\nrendered me incapable of taking down evidence correctly, of comparing\ndocuments and drawing reasonable inferences, of examining envelopes which\nhad been surreptitiously opened, of carefully exploring the interstices of\nceilings and other localities where marvellous phenomena were alleged to\n1 I was allowed only a similar degree of liberty with certain documents which I\nobtained from Theosophists.\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 133\nhave occurred, I must simply join issue with him.

M.\nSeervai, formerly Vice-President of the Theosophical Society at Bombay, to\ngive up all connection with the Society, or that led Mr. S. K. Chatterjee,\nformerly President of the Lahore Branch, to declare that the Society was\n\"a huge imposture, \" or that led Mr. A. 0. Hume, long before the exposures\nof the Coulombs, to the opinion that some of the chdas were morally\nuntrustworthy\u2014that the Shrine was a \"conjurer's box\"\u2014and that many\nother of Madame Blavatsky's phenomena were fraudulently produced, or that\nled Pundit Dayanund Saraswati, the President of the Arya Somaj of India,\nto inform the public, in 1882, that \"neither Colonel Olcott nor Madame\nBlavatsky knows anything of Yog Vidya (occult science) as practised by the\nYogis of old,\" and that \"for them to say that they perform their\nphenomena without apparatus, without any secret pre-arrangement, and\nsolely through the forces existing in nature (electricity), and by what they\ncall their ' will-power,' is to tell a lie.\"\nThe other general statements which I have quoted from Mr.\nSinnett are also misrepresentations, and further show his ignorance of\nthe state of affairs at Adyar. When Madame Blavatsky was likely to\nhave anything to say of any importance whatever, I questioned her on\nthe matter. Her replies consisted chiefly in the trumping up of ex post\nfacto documents, in deliberate falsehoods, and the suborning of false\ntestimony. For references to Madame Blavatsky's statements see my\nReport, pp. 211, 221 note, 292 note, 318-321, 324, 331, 335-6, 346.\nMr. Sinnett speaks of my disguising my \" unfavourable conclusions\nwhile staying as a guest at the Theosophical headquarters.\" In the\nfirst place I had no \" conclusions \" at the time referred to. I reached\nMadras on December 18th, 1884, went to stay at the Theosophical\nHeadquarters on December 25th, and left on January 3rd, though of\ncourse I made frequent calls there afterwards until the end of my stay\nin India, March 26th, 1885. As an instance of the way in which the\nexpression of my unfavourable conclusions was met as regards one\nspecial part of my investigation, I may refer to a case given in my\nReport, pp. 335-6. I had pointed out that there was no satisfactory\nevidence that anyone had examined the west side of the wall immedi\nately behind the Shrine. (The Shrine was a cupboard placed in the\nso-called Occult Room, which adjoined Madame Blavatsky's bedroom.\nIt was fixed against the party-wall between the two rooms. Letters\nand other objects were alleged to have appeared in it by other than\nordinary means. The evidence adduced in my Report went to show\nthat they were put there surreptitiously through a sliding panel at the\nback, to which there was access through Madame Blavatsky's\nbedroom.) This was early in February. The result was an ex post\nfacto Mahatma letter foisted upon Colonel Olcott by Madame\nBlavatsky, who by means of it succeeded in engendering a pseudo\n\f134 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nmemory in Colonel Olcott's mind that he had incidentally made such\nexaminations himself. I assumed Colonel Olcott's innocence in the\nmatter ; the reader of my Report may remember that I quoted Madame\nBlavatsky as calling Colonel Olcott a \" psychologised baby \" (Report,\np. 311). In the second place, when I did reach my final conclusions, I\ncommunicated them at Adyar with some interesting results, of which\nMr. Sinnett is manifestly ignorant. On February 23rd I left Madras\nfor Bombay. There I obtained much important evidence by my own\ninquiries, and made the personal acquaintance of Mr. A. O. Hume,\nwho gave me much assistance then and afterwards. On March 11th\nI returned to Madras, whither Mr. Hume had preceded me. In the\ncourse of the next few days I discussed the results of my investigations\nwith the leading Theosophists at Adyar. It was on the evening of\nMarch 1 3th,at a conference between Dr. Hartmann, Mr. and Mrs. Cooper-\nOakley, Mr. Hume and myself, that Dr. Hartmann finally confessed\nthat \" nobody was allowed to touch that d Shrine,\" and he then\nrelated the incident described on p. 224 of my Report, concerning the\ndiscovery of the sliding panel of the Shrine and the subsequent destruc\ntion of the Shrine itself. I had learned from Mr. A. D. Ezekiel, in\nBombay, that he had discovered independently that there had once\nbeen a hole in the wall behind the Shrine, but that it had been care\nfully blocked up. Dr. Hartmann then admitted that traces of thia\nhole had been discovered previously, but the discovery was kept a\nsecret. On the following morning Mr. Hume drew up some statements\nto form proposed resolutions for an informal meeting to be held in the\nevening by himself, the Oakleys, Hartmann, Ragoonath Row, Subba-\nRow, and P. Sreenevas Row. These were to the effect that most of\nthe phenomena in connection with the Theosophical Society were\nfraudulent, as appears from such of the Coulombs' statements as have\nbeen verified, and the independent investigations by myself, that the\nSociety be reconstituted, that Madame Blavatsky, Olcott, Damodar,\nBabajee and Bhavani Shankar should resign their connection with it,\nthat the disputed letters are genuine, and that Hartmann's pamphlet 1\nas well as the Defence pamphlet2 should be withdrawn, as being founded\n1 Report of Observation! made during a nine months' stay at the headquarters of\nthe Theosophical Society at Adyar {Madras), India, by F. Hartmann, M.D., P.T.S.\n* Other curious incidents in connection with this pamphlet were known to some of\nthe Theosophists at the Adyar headquarters as well as to myself. The \"Defence\nPamphlet \" was compiled chiefly by Dr. Hartmann, and is that quoted from by Mrs.\nBesant, who refers to it as \" 'Report of the Result of an Investigation,' by a Com\nmittee of the Council of the Theosophical Society, Madras, 1885.\" It is also quoted\nfrom by Mr. Sinnett in The \" Occult World Phenomena,\" and the Society for\nPsychical Research. This \"Defence Pamphlet\" was issued in March, 1886. Its\nfull title is : Report of the Result of an Investigation into the charges against\nMadame Blavatsky, brought by the Missionaries of the Scottish Free Church at\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 135\non an imperfect knowledge of the circumstances. These resolutions,\nas I was informed by Mr. Hume, were not carried, the Oakleys and\nDr. Hartmann being unwilling to go so far as to condemn the pheno\nmena as fraudulent. It was decided, however, that the pamphlets\nshould be withdrawn. The circulation of these pamphlets was there\nfore stopped, and early in April the following announcement appeared\nin the Madras Mail :\u2014\n\" The Theosophists.\u2014Colonel Olcott writes on behalf of the General\nCouncil of the Theosophist Society to say that ' as a number of copies of a\npamphlet entitled Report of the Result of the Investigations into the Charges\nbroityht against Madame Blavatsky have been circulated, it is my duty to\nstate that the issue has not been ordered by the General Council, nor\nauthorised by the Committee.' \"\nIt is from this pamphlet, officially disowned by the Theosophical\nSociety, that Mr. Sinnett and Mrs. Besant, as we shall see later, quote\naccounts of examinations of the Shrine. But what I desire the reader\nat present to note is that the pamphlet was thus officially disowned\nin consequence of my communicating to the leading Theosophists at\nAdyar the results of my investigations. Madame Blavatsky's atti\ntude to myself, as expressed at the time, was as characteristic as her\nsubsequent vituperation. With her keen insight into human nature,\nshe was well aware that whatever prepossessions I had at the outset of\nmy investigation were distinctly in her favour, and in the last interview\nwhich I had with herself and Colonel Olcott, she declared that the\nBrotherhood was unwilling that the world should at this time believe\nin their existence, that I had in fact been practically guided by the\nBrothers themselves, that she knew I had done the most possible for\nher sake, that there was no alternative but for me to reach the con\nclusion which I had reached, that it was partly the result of her own\nbad Karma, that she deserved the fate which had overtaken her, but\nthat some day in the far distant future' I might come to believe that\nafter all she was innocent. With me personally, face to face, she was\ncourageous unto the last.\nI pass on to consider the article by Mrs. Besant. She alleges that\nmy \" prejudice \" made me \" welcome every unproven suspicion or\ncharge made by known enemies of the Theosophical Society, and ignore\nall evidence tendered by friends.\" As to the \"prejudice,\" it was\nMadronx and examined by a Committee appointed for that purpose by the General\nCouncil of the Theosophical Society. The full title of the other pamphlet, referred\nto above as \" Hartmann'b pamphlet,\" is: Report of Observation* made during a\nnine months' stay at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar (Madras),\nIndia, by f. Hartmann, M.D., F.T.S. (an American Buddhist). The first edition\nwas issued in September, 1884, and marked \"[Private and Confidential] \"; the second\nedition was published apparently in October, 1884.\n\f130 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nknown to my personal friends and also I believe to some of the leading\nTheosophists at the time in London, that whatever \" prejudice \" I may\nhave had was certainly not against the genuineness of the phenomena\nconnected with Madame Blavatsky (Report, p. 208). I was, as a\nmatter of fact,' prepossessed in her favour. Mrs. Besant states that I\nignored \"all evidence tendered by friends,\" yet she claims to have\nread my Report \"carefully.\" If so, she should recall that apart from the\nquestion of handwriting the great bulk of the evidence offered in my\nReport was furnished by Theosophists themselves (e.g., Report, Appen\ndix IV.), while the remaining part of the evidence consisted almost\nexclusively of information verifiable by any person, such as my own\ndescriptions of specific places like the rooms and grounds of Crow's\nNest Bungalow, or of the Adyar Headquarters, or the items in account\nbooks of well-known shops in Madras, or the facts about certain letters\nand documents (see Report, Appendices V., XIV., and XV.). I do\nnot suppose that Mrs. Besant has any deliberate intention of mis\nrepresenting the nature of the evidence furnished in my Report,\nthough the reader who goes to that Report to see whose statements\nare regarded as evidence will naturally be surprised at the absurdity of\nher assertion.\nMrs. Besant then passes from the general charge of prejudice to a\nmore specific one of dishonesty, alleging as follows :\u2014\nThere is one crucial instance of Mr. Hodgson's lack of honesty ; he\npublishes a \"Plan of Occult Room, with Shrine and Surroundings (from\nmeasurements taken by R. Hodgson, assisted by the statements of Theo-\nsophic witnesses).\" On p. 220 Mr. Hodgson says that \" the accompanying\nrough sketch made from measurements of my own shows the positions.\" As\na matter of fact, the place when Mr. Hodgson saw it had been so altered\nthat \"measurements\" were impossible ; the holes he shows in the plan did\nnot exist when he saw the rooms ; but it will be better for me to let the\nauthor of the plan speak for himself, only saying that he is Mr. William\nJudge, a New York lawyer of standing and repute, with a character to lose,\nand that Mr. Judge went from New York to Adyar with authority from\nMadame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, to look into the conduct of the\nCoulombs and the management of the place, and arrived the day after the\nCoulombs had been dismissed. He says : \" I made a plan of how it had been\nleft by Coulomb, and that plan it is that Hodgson pirated in his report, and\ndesires people to think his, and to be that which he made on the spot, while\nlooking at that which he thus pretends to have drawn. He never could have\nseen it as Coulomb had left it.\" I venture to suggest that the pirating of\nanother person's plan, with '' measurements \" of things that no longer existed\nwhen Mr. Hodgson visited Adyar, is not consistent with good faith.\u2014Time,\npp. 195-6.\nI repeat : \" Plan of Occult Room with Shrine and Surroundings\n(from measurements taken by R. Hodgson, assisted by the statements\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 137\nof Theosophic witnesses).\" I also repeat the other passage which Mrs.\nBesant quotes, but I repeat this with the context :\u2014\nOne large upper room of the main bungalow was used by Madame\nBlavatsky (see Plan). The Occult Room was built later, against the west\nside of Madame Blavatsky's room. The north window on this side was\nremoved, and a layer of bricks and plaster covered the aperture on the side\nof the Occult Boom\u2014a recess about 15in. deep being left on the east side.\nThe south window was transformed into a doorway leading from Madame\nBlavatsky's room into the Occult Room. Madame Blavatsky's large room\nwas divided into two by curtains and a screen ; that adjoining the Occult\nBoom being used by Madame Blavatsky as her bedroom, and at the end of\n1883 as her dining-room also. The accompanying rough sketch made from\nmeasurements of my own shows the positions, the Occult Room being about\n2ft. lower than Madame Blavatsky's room. The general entrance to the\nOccult Room was through Madame Blavatsky's sitting-room (Proceedings\nS.P.R., Part IX., p. 220).\nNow the reader will observe that in the title of my Plan I have\ndescribed myself as assisted by the statements of Theosophic witnesses.\nIt is clear from my Report for what particulars I had to depend on\nthe statements of Theosophists. The important points concerned the\nsize and position of the Shrine, the position of the hole in the wall\nimmediately behind the Shrine, and the position of the sideboard. I\nquestioned Theosophists at Adyar for their estimates on these points,\nand formed judgment accordingly. (See my Report, pp. 224-6, and\nAppendix IV.) Further, for all that I know to the contrary, Mrs.\nBesant may confirm my own measurements now on all the other points\nof any importance by a visit to Adyar. The walls and doors and\nwindows, ifcc., may still be in existence ; so also may the recess in the\nparty-wall between the Occult Room and that formerly used by\nMadame Blavatsky as a bedroom. The sideboard may still be where\nI saw it last, in the \" New Room,\"\u2014 and the bricked frame that once\nserved to hide the recess may yet be lying in the dust-heap of the\ncompound.\n\u2022 I shall now quote passages from my Report to show that there\nwere certain measurements which I distinctly and expressly pointed\nout I was unable to make ; and others which I distinctly and expressly\npointed out that I was able to make. Mrs. Besant quotes from p. 220.\nShe does not quote, however, what I say on that page about the\nShrine's disappearance before my arrival at Adyar, nor does she quote\nthe following statement :\u2014\nMoreover, the Occult Room, when I first received permission to inspect\nit, had been considerably altered ; its walls were covered with fresh plaster,\nand I was informed by Mr. Damodar that all traces of the alleged\n\" machinations \" of the Coulombs in connection with the Shrine had been\nobliterated. This was not true, for the bricked frame and the aperture into\nthe recess still existed (see p. 228). However, under the circumstances\n\f138 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nit was impossible for me to test the accuracy of much of the description\ngiven by Theosophists of the Occult Room and the Shrine at the time of\nthe \"exposure \"by the Coulombs. But by analysing and comparing the\nevidence given by various witnesses, I was able to put together the following\nhistory of the Shrine and its surroundings.1\nAgain, on pp. 228, 229 I wrote :\u2014\nDr. Hartmann in his pamphlet gave the dimensions of the aperture as\n27in. high by 14in. wide, and these dimensions are as nearly as possible\ncorrect. This I was subsequently able to ascertain for myself, as the frame\nhad been stowed away in the compound, and was shown to me by another\nTheosophist. The recess was alleged by Dr. Hartmann to be about 12in.\ndeep, and about 5ft. high ; the depth given is about correct, but the height\nwas more nearly 8ft.\u2014as I found by measurement.\nI have thus explicitly pointed out in my Report that there were\ncertain measurements which I was unable to make, and certain others,\nespecially concerning the size of the recess and the aperture to it, which,\nnotwithstanding the alterations in connection with the Occult Room,\nI was able to make and did make, and references to these points are\ngiven on the very page from which Mrs. Besant draws her quotation,\nwhich she separates from the context, and so makes it convey\u2014I do\nnot say intentionally\u2014a false impression. She then goes on to mis\nrepresent me as claiming to have made measurements which I have\nthus explicitly pointed out in my Report I was unable to make. And\nshe asserts that she has read my Report \" carefully.\"\nBut this is far from being the whole of Mrs. Besant's misrepre\nsentation. She asserts that the Plan which I made was made by\na \"Mr. William Judge.\" Now, the only plans, except my own, of\nOccult Room and Surroundings, that I ever heard of, were (1) an\nincomplete plan of the walls only \u2014made by M. Coulomb after his\ndeparture from the Theosophical Headquarters, and (2) the plan\nwhich was published in the pamphlet by Dr. Hartmann entitled\nReport of Observations made during a nine months' stay at the\nHeadquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar (Madras), India.\nBoth of these plans, as I found by my own measurements, were inac\ncurate. The one published by Dr. Hartmann, indeed, was absurdly\ninaccurate. Perhaps this was the one made by Mr. Judge. Dr. Hart-\nmann's pamphlet was both prepared and issued during Mr. Judge's\nstay at Adyar. I reproduce this plan here so that the reader may\ncompare it with mine (Proceedings, Part IX.).\n1 For the evidence on which this account is based see Appendix IV.\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 139\nShelf.\nSitting Room\no\nc\nC\n+ b Partilion.\nWard robp\n\u2022I Door\nBed Room.\nBook.\nCase.\n| Shrine.

But if he did make any other plan, and if it agrees with mine, I\nventure to congratulate Mr. Judge that he was so close in his judgment\nabout the recess, to which on his own showing he had no access except\n\f140 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nby the aperture in the bricked frame, and which I was able to measure\neasily as the bricked frame was removed during my stay at Madras.\nI also venture to congratulate myself that his measurements of the\nsize and position of the Shrine are found to justify my estimate formed\nfrom the various statements of the Theosophic witnesses. Mr. Judge\nhad opportunity enough for the measurement of the Shrine. I take\nthe following passage from my Report, p. 224 :\u2014\nThe ultimate fate of the Shrine, according to a statement made by Dr.\nHartmann to Mr. and Mrs. Cooper-Oakley, Mr. Hume, and myself, was as\nfollows. After the expulsion of the Coulombs, Mr. Judge, an American\nTheosophist, then residing at the headquarters of the Society, was desirous\nof examining the Shrine. Mr. Damodar, who possessed the keys of the\nOccult Room, avoided this examination several times on one pretext or\nanother ; but, eventually, a party of Theosophists proceeded to the inspec\ntion of the Shrine. The Shrine was removed from the wall and its doors\nwere opened. Mr. T. Vigiaraghava Charloo (commonly called Ananda), a\nTheosophist residing in an official position at the headquarters, struck the\nback of the Shrine with his hand, exclaiming, \" You see, the back is quite\nsolid,\" when, to the surprise of most of those who were present, the middle\npanel of the Shrine flew up. It seemed undesirable to some of the witnesses\nof this phenomenon that the discovery should be made public, and they\nresolved accordingly to destroy the Shrine. To do this they considered that\nthe Shrine must be surreptitiously removed, but such removal was incon\nvenient from the Occult Room. The Shrine was therefore first removed\nopenly to Mr. Damodar's room, and, on the following night, was thence\nremoved secretly by three Theosophists, concealed in the compound, after\nwards broken up, and the fragments burned piecemeal during the following\nweek.\nIn a written account furnished to me by Dr. Hartmann, given in\nfull on p. 225 of my Report, allusion is also made to these incidents 1 :\u2014\nIt was found that the back of the Shrine could be removed, and on\nmoistening the wall behind the Shrine with a wet cloth, it was found that an\naperture had existed, which had been plastered up. ... It seemed to\nme that if at that inopportune moment this new discovery, to which I then\nalluded in the papers (see Madras Mail), would have been made public, it\nwould have had a bad effect on the public mind. ... A gentleman who\nwas present, and who shared my opinions, was of the opinion that the Shrine\n1 The defence originally offered by the Theosophists was that M. Coulomb had\nmade the trick apparatus after Madame Blavatsky's departure from Adyar, but had\nnot had time to complete his tricks, and as one of the proofs of this they pointed out\ntbat there was no hole in the wall immediately behind the Shrine. When it was\nafterwards discovered that not only did the Shrine have a sliding panel in the back,\nbut that a hole had once existed in the wall, thus completing the required communica\ntion between the Shrine and Madame Blavatsky's bedroom, it became obvious that\nthe defence originally put forward was very unsatisfactory ; so unsatisfactory indeed\nthat Mr. Judge and Dr. Hartmann, to \"save the situation,\" suppressed tha\ndiscoveries and destroyed the Shrine. (See Report, pp. 340-1.)\n\fThe Defence of the Theoscrphiats. 141\nhad been too much desecrated to be of any more use, and he burned the\nShrine in my presence.\nThis gentleman, according to Dr. Hartmann's statement to us, was\nMr. Judge.\nNor was this the only instance in which Mr. Judge was willing to\nact for the purpose of \" saving the situation.\" One of the Blavatsky-\nCoulomb documents refers to an attempt to deceive Mr. Jacob Sassoon\nby a spurious marvel, viz., a telegram supposed to be sent by a Rama\nlinga Deb. The telegram was sent by Madame Coulomb according to\ninstructions from Madame Blavatsky (Report, pp. 211, 217-8,318-321),\nand it was clear that Ramalinga Deb was a fictitious personage.\nMadame Blavatsky's letter to Madame Coulomb arranging for this\nmarvel was published in the Madras Christian College Magazine for\nSeptember, 1884. I take the following passage from a later article in\nthe Madras Christian College Magazine for April, 1885 :\u2014\nMr. W. Q. Judge wrote the following letter on the subject to some of the\nleading Indian newspapers :\u2014\n\"In this matter which has now spread all over India very much has been\nmade of the sending a telegram to Madame Blavatsky signed ' Ramalinga\nDeb,' which was done, the Christian College Magazine says, by order of\nMadame Blavatsky in order to commit a fraud.\nWe wish the public and all our friends to know that this telegram\nincident is perfectly clear to us. We know Mr. Ramalinga Deb very well.\nWe also know how Mrs. Coulomb obtained possession of the receipt and of\na copy of the telegram.\nBut as this is an important point in the case we must refuse, at this-\nmoment, to inform our enemies what the evidence and explanation are.\nAt the proper time and before the proper tribunal we will produce both\nMr. Deb and the explanation, when Mrs. Coulomb will have an opportunity\nof confronting the substance of that shadow which is called by her in the\nChristian College Magazine 'Ramalinga Deb.'\nI am, &c.,\nWilliam Q. Judge, F.T.S.,\nBarrister-at-Law.''\nWhat, we would ask, has become of the substance of Mr. Ramalinga Deb\nnow ? Or what, indeed, of the substance of Mr. Judge himself ? That\ngentleman has, we believe, preferred a trip to America to the more hazardous\nenterprise of producing \" Mr. Deb and the explanation.\"\nI cannot profess myself to attribute any importance to Mr. Judge's\ntestimony. If he acted as the representative of Madame Blavatsky\nin these cases, to \" save the situation \" at Adyar, he may have acted in\nother cases also to \" prolong the situation,\" and I may here remark\nthat it would be very easy for Madame Blavatsky in a short time to\nproduce a number of persons who could master the characteristics of\nthe K. H. writing sufficiently to deceive the elect like Mrs. Besant,\n\f142 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nand that when Mrs. Besant speaks of having received K. H. letters\nafter Madame Blavatsky's death, we need to know the precise circum\nstances according to the accounts of cautious witnesses before we can\nregard her statement as worthy of serious consideration. But not\neven Mrs. Besant has offered more than a general statement which\nseems to represent her mere opinion.\nWe may now consider some other statements which Mrs. Besant\nquotes from this same Mr. Judge about the aperture made into the\nrecess.\nMr. Judge\u2014who saw the hole\u2014describes it as \" a rough, unfinished hole\nin the wall, opening into the space left when the old door had been bricked\nup. . . . This hole began at the floor, and extended up about 22 inches.\nFrom each edge projected pieces of lath, some three inches, others five\ninches long, so that the opening was thus further curtailed. . . . The\nplaster was newly broken off, the ends of the laths presented the appear\nance of freshly broken wood, and the wall-paper had been freshly torn off.\"\nThese facts were seen and signed to by over 30 gentlemen, sent for by Mr.\nJudge as witnesses. Mr. Judge further tells us that, at his request, Mr.\nDamodar tried to get into the recess through the hole, but could not ; Mr.\nJudge himself tried and failed, as did a \"thin coolie \" ; finally, \"a small boy\nabout ten years of age \" squeezed in, but found that he could not stand\nupright, for there were large pieces of hard mortar projecting from the sides.\nMr. Judge then sent fora man, who \" in my presence bricked up the aperture,\nreplastered it, and then repapered the whole space.\" What, then, becomes\nof Mr. Hodgson's \" measurements \" and his statement that the space was\nsufficient for a person to stand in ? (Time, pp. 199-200.)\nWith these statements of Mr. Judge we may compare the state\nments of two other prominent Theosophists, as examples of conflicting\ntestimonies. Dr. Hartmann writes in the pamphlet already referred\nto (Report of Observations, ifec., p. 39) :\u2014\nThe wall behind the \"shrine\" in the \"occult\" room was found to be partly\nhollow, forming a space of about 5 feet high and 3J feet wide, with a depth\nof twelve inches between the walls, and with an aperture of about 14 inches\nwide, by 27 inches high, sufficiently large for a little boy (who was not\nafraid of suffocation) to crawl in, and opening into the bedroom next to the\n\" occult \" room. This aperture was hidden by a heavy piece of furniture\nresembling a cupboard or clothes press, and it could be entered through the\nsame by opening the door of the cupboard and removing a sliding panel (d)\nat the back.\nAnd Damodar, in his first reply to Dr. Hartmann's circular of\ninquiry, wrote as follows (Report, p. 336) :\u2014\nAs regards the hole [through the sideboard into the recess] ... in\nthe presence of Dr. Hartmann and Mr. Lane-Fox, I attempted to enter it.\nAll who know me or have seen me are aware how thin and lean I am ; and\nalthough I was almost half naked at the time, I could enter the \"hole\" with\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 143\ndifficulty. And when once inside I could only stand abreast without being\nable to move, either way, an inch, or to lift up my hand.\nI pointed out in my Report (pp. 228-9) that the dimensions of the\naperture as given by Dr. Hartmann were \" as nearly as possible correct.\nThis I was subsequently able to ascertain for myself as the frame had\nbeen stowed away in the compound, and was shown to me by another\nTheosophist.\" This was the bricked frame which filled the front of the\nrecess, and through which the aperture had been made.\nThe recess was alleged by Dr. Hartmann to be about 12in. deep and about\n5ft. high ; the depth given is about correct, but the height was more nearly\n8ft.\u2014as I found by measurement. I have myself entered a space through a\nhole the dimensions of both of which were at least an inch less than the\ndimensions given by Dr. Hartmann. The hole I made for the purpose\nmeasured less than 13in. by 26in. , and the space into which it led, and in\nwhich I stood upright, was less than llin. in depth. In this space I could\nwith ease lift my hand, manipulate objects, and utilise the position generally\nin the way demanded for the production of the Shrine phenomena,.\nAnother Theosophist assured me that \" he regarded the aperture\nand the recess as quite large enough to be used by a person of ordinary\nsize for the production of the Shrine phenomena.\" This gentleman was\nMr. A. D. Ezekiel, of Poona, the same discerning witness who dis\ncovered that a hole had once existed in the wall immediately behind\nthe Shrine, but had afterwards been blocked up (Report, pp. 224-5),\nand who also detected in the ceiling the \"screw-rings\"1 which had\nbeen used in the production of a spurious letter-phenomenon intended\nfor his benefit (Report, p. 249).\nWhen, therefore, I stated in my Report that the space in question\nwas sufficient for a person to stand in, I did so while giving my\nreaders full information as to how I was able to make the measure\nments, and I quoted the measurements given by Dr. Hartmann, differ\ning with him only as to the height of the recess, which he gave as 5ft.2\nand which I found to be nearly 8ft. Dr. Hartmann assuredly cannot\nbe accused of having at that time any prejudice against Madame\nBlavatsky. He was, on the contrary, one of her warmest partisans ; he\n1 Mr. Ezekiel informed me that he was at Adyar some time after the \" exposure \"\nby the Coulombs, and Mr. Judge ehalh'nged him to point out the contrivances men\ntioned above. Mr. Ezekiel looked up at the ceiling and found that they had dis\nappeared, but he pointed out to Mr. Judge the marks of the fresh paint which showed\nwhere they had been. Mr. Judge said nothing.\n' This, I think, waa not an intentional misrepresentation by Dr. Hartmann. He\nevidently estimated the height of the recess when the only access to it was through\nthe aperture 14x27 in., and he may have taken a statement by Damodar as to its\nheight, Damodar, according to tiis own written statement, having entered it in the\npresence of Dr. Hartmann. Later on. long after Dr. Hartmann's pamphlet was\npublished, and while I was at Madras, the bricked frame waa removed, so that I was\nable to measure both the bricked frame and the recess.\n\f144 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nhad been nine months at Adyar when he published his pamphlet ; and'\nthree months and a half\u2014ample time for his measurements\u2014had\nelapsed since the departure of the Coulombs. What then, will the\nreader think of Mrs. Besant's charge against me on the strength of a\nwritten statement made by Mr. Judge to herself apparently some years\nlater 1 Those of my readers who have followed my accounts, in other\narticles, of the unreliability of human testimony, may perhaps be will\ning to let Mr. Judge's statements pass as a case of ordinary lapse of\nmemory. But Mrs. Besant, claiming to have read my Report \" care\nfully,\" and with the evidence in that Report presumably before her con\ncerning Dr. Hartmann's statements as published in his pamphlet\u2014-\nwhich surely Mrs. Besant ought to have also studied carefully,\u2014makes\nno reference whatever either to the detailed circumstances of my\nmeasurements, or the explicit declarations of Dr. Hartmann, who wrote\nin defence of Madame Blavatsky.\nI shall now proceed to deal with Mrs. Besant's other (doubtless\nunintentional) misrepresentations. Tn dealing with the question of\nstructures for trickery in connection with the Shrine, she makes it\nappear that I have adduced the statements of the Coulombs as evidence.\n\" All this Mr. Hodgson learned from the veracious M. Coulomb, and\nnobody else.\" A reference to my Report will show how far this is\nfrom being true. My consideration of the Shrine and surroundings\nwill be found chiefly on pp. 220-231 and pp. 325-341. On pp. 220-1 I\ngive the early history of the Occult Room and Shrine, which depends,\nas I expressly pointed out, on the statements of Theosophic witnesses.\nOn pp. 221-2 I give the statements of M. Coulomb in a single separate\nparagraph by themselves, and point out that his \" statement as to the\nhalf panel cannot of course be verified, and must be taken for what it\nis worth. What evidence there is in support of his other statements\nwill be seen from the remainder of my narrative, derived from other\nsources.\" I then proceed with the later history of the Shrine, up to\nM. Coulomb's delivery of the keys and the investigation of the various\ncontrivances for trickery. I stated clearly the view put forward in\ndefence of Madame Blavatsky :\u2014\nThe Theosophists contended that the structures for trickery revealed by\nthe Coulombs, who had had exclusive charge of Madame Blavatsky's rooms\nduring her absence, had been made after she had left ; that they had never\nbeen and could not be used in the production of phenomena ; that the\nhollow space and aperture leading to it were too small to be utilised in any\nconnection with the Shrine, and moreover that M. Coulomb's work was\ninterrupted before he had time to make a hole through the wall between\nthe hollow space and the Shrine itself.\nI then discuss, entirely apartfrom any statements whatever made by\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 145\nthe Coulombs, the evidence given on these points by Theosophists, and\nI quote all the important part of this evidence in detail in Appendix\nIV., giving much fuller and more numerous citati\u00abns than Mrs. Besant\nherself has given, and quoting also the replies of many of the witnesses\nto my own personal inquiries made on the spot. In drawing my con\nclusions I did not depend on a single statement made by the Coulombs,\nas the reader may easily see for himself. My conclusions were\n(Report, p. 226) :\u2014\n(1) That the position selected for the Shrine was peculiarly convenient for\nobtaining secret access to it from the back ; and that none of the changes\nfrom time to time made in Madame Blavatsky's bedroom behind the Shrine,\nthough made with the ostensible object of removing all suspicion of trickery,\ntended to diminish this convenience ; (2) that there undoubtedly were all\nthe necessary apertures for access to the Shrine from the back, at some period\nbefore the Coulombs left ; (3) that there is no trustworthy evidence whatever\nto show that this access did not exist during the whole time from the\nmoment the Shrine was put up till Madame Blavatsky left for Europe, in\nFebruary, 1884, except during the alterations connected with putting up\nthe bricked frame, when Mrs. Morgan saw the whole wall papered over ; and\nthere is no evidence of the occurrence of any Shrine phenomena during those\nalterations.\nThese results\u2014altogether apart from the Blavatsky-Coulomb correspon\ndence\u2014would prevent the whole mass of testimony to Shrine-marvels from\nhaving any scientific value ; taken along with this correspondence, they can,\nI think, leave no doubt in the mind of any impartial reader as to the mode\nof production of these marvels.\nYet Mrs. Besant has thought proper to represent me in her article\nas both depending on the evidence of the Coulombs, and as producing\nno other evidence. I do not attribute any intentional insincerity\nto Mrs. Besant. I regard this and other examples of her misrepre\nsentation of my Report as springing from a strong emotional bias\nin the light of which her intellectual faculty at least has become\nobscured. The fact is that Mrs. Besant is wofully ignorant of the whole\nmatter that concerns the trick structures at Adyar. She seems to\nhave adopted without any question the crude and hasty view which\nthe Theosophists at Adyar first put forward in explanation of the\norigin of those structures, and to have paid no attention whatever\nto the evidence that has been produced against that view. Her\nmethod of meeting the evidence offered in my Report on this point\nseems to be to take no notice of it, although it is the evidence of\nTheosophic witnesses anxious to defend Madame Blavatsky. And she\nquotes inaccurate statements about examinations of the Shrine from\na pamphlet disowned by the Council of the Theosophical Society and\nexpressly declared to be untrustworthy by tlie compiler of the pamphlet,.\nDr. Hcurtmann himself.\nL\n\f146 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nWe now come to what Mrs. Besant has to say concerning the\ngenuineness of the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters. She wishes her reader\nto think lightly of the opinion of Messrs. Netherclift and Sims, chiefly\nbecause these gentlemen formed a certain opinion in the first instance\nconcerning some other writing and then, when additional documents\nwere submitted to them, formed a different opinion. I shall have\nmore to say on this point presently. Meanwhile the fact remains that\nin the opinion of the best experts obtainable, the Blavatsky-Coulomb\ndocuments were undoubtedly written by Madame Blavatsky, and I\nknow of no expert in handwriting who has examined the letters who\nhas expressed any different opinion.\nI notice that Mrs. Besant has made no allusion to the circumstan\ntial evidence adduced in my Report which corroborates the judgment\nof the experts in handwriting. She uses an argument, however, which\nmay appear to have some validity to those persons who are unac\nquainted with the old relations between Madame Blavatsky and\nMadame Coulomb. It is absurd to suppose, she says, that Madame\nBlavatsky \" would be such a fool as to place herself at the mercy of a\nwoman of the type of Madame Coulomb.\" But the case is very\ndifferent when we remember that as far back as 1872, at Cairo,\nMadame Blavatsky had been associated with Madame Coulomb\nin producing bogus \"spiritistic\" phenomena, and that the latter\nalready was possessed of some important \" secrets \" of Madame Blavat-\nsky's life. Madame Blavatsky, before the incriminating letters in\nquestion were written, was already in Madame Coulomb's power.\n{Report, pp. 314-5.) Mrs. Besant quotes Mr. Hume as having put\nthis view well, viz., that Madame Blavatsky was \" far too shrewd a\nwoman to have ever written to any one anything that could convict\nher of fraud.\" She does not, however, refer to the fact that Mr.\nHume changed his opinion. I quote what I said on this point in my\nReport (p. 274) :\u2014\nWhen the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters were first published, Mr. Hume\n,expressed his opinion publicly that Madame Blavatsky was too clever to have\nthus committed herself ; latterly, however, and partly in consequence of the\nevidence I was able to lay before him, he came to the conviction that the\nletters in question were actually written by Madame Blavatsky. Further,\nhe had never placed the slightest credence in the Shrine-phenomena, which\nhe had always supposed to be fraudulent.\nMrs. Besant says : \" It has always been a mystery to me how any\none could read these letters, and believe them to have been written\nby Madame Blavatsky.\" This I suppose is largely a matter of personal\nopinion. To myself the mystery is how Mrs. Besant can believe them\nto have been written by anybody else. And that Madame Blavatsky\nherself saw the difficulty in foisting them on any other person is\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 147\nsufficiently indicated by the fact that she admitted nearly all the non-\nincriminating portions of the letters to be in substance genuine.\nThe next main point that Mrs. Besant deals with is the authorship\nof the Koot Hoomi documents, which I have given reasons for thinking\nwere written chiefly by Madame Blavatsky, in some cases by Damodar.\nMrs. Besant's belief that many Mahatma letters have been received\nunder circumstances which precluded their having been written by\nMadame Blavatsky or a confederate, has obviously no more evidential\nvalue than Dr. Hartmann's general statement, which she quotes, that he\nreceived such letters at Headquarters when Madame Blavatsky was not\nliving there. The only specific cases to which Mrs. Besant refers are\nmentioned, among others, in my Report (pp. 215, 248, etseq., 373-377).\nMrs. Besant seems to take it for granted that because Madame\nBlavatsky did not know Sanscrit, Mahrathi, &c., the Mahatma letters\nin those languages must be supernormal ; as if it were not superlatively\neasy for Madame Blavatsky to obtain such letters through one of her\nconfederates. I have mentioned in my Report that Mahrathi was\nDamodar's vernacular. It was much easier indeed for Madame\nBlavatsky to provide a Mahatma letter in one of the Indian languages\nthan to either read or provide one in Hebrew or in Arabic. And we\nfind accordingly that when Mr. A. D. Ezekiel, Theosophist of Poona,\nprepared a question in the Arabic language and in Hebrew characters,\nand submitted it to the Mahatma, he received a reply that showed\ncomplete ignorance of his question. His question concerned the\ninterpretation of a specific portion of the Kabbala, and not the slightest\nreference was made to this in the reply which he received.\nAn analysis of the circumstances of the appearance of all the Koot\nHoomi writings of any importance that came before us previous to the\npublication of my Report, showed that so far as time, place, &c.,\nwere concerned, they might have been written either by Madame\nBlavatsky or Damodar. It was therefore desirable to ascertain what\ngrounds there were, as a question of handwriting, composition, Ac.,\nfor supposing that the K. H. documents were actually the work of\nMadame Blavatsky and Damodar,\u2014and primarily of course of Madame\nBlavatsky. The question is considered in detail on pp. 276-311 of\nmy Report, and my conclusions were confirmed and strengthened by\nthe examination made by Mrs. Sidgwick (Report, pp. 378-380). Messrs.\nNetherclift and Sims also reached the same conclusions eventually, but\nthought differently on their first examination. Mrs. Besant makes\nmuch of this change of opinion on the part of these experts, and\nadduces on the other side the testimony of \" Herr Ernst Schiitze, the\nCourt expert in caligraphy at Berlin.\" Now the circumstances of Herr\nErnst Schutze's judgment happen to be given by Mr. Sinnett in the\nl 2\n\f148 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nvolume entitled Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky (Appendix,\npp. 323-4). The documents submitted to Herr Schiitze for compari\nson were a K. H. letter of September, 1884, and a Madame Blavatsky\nletter received October, 1885. He replied that they were not by the same\nhand. Later on, another K. H. letter, we are not informed of what\ndate, was sent to Herr Schiitze, and he was asked whether he would\n\" adhere to his opinion.\" He did so adhere. Now I venture to find\nfault with the circumstances of this judgment, as described by\nMr. Sinnett. In the first place the writing supplied to the expert,\nsupplied, I presume, as the undoubted ordinary writing of Madame\nBlavatsky, was written a year after the publication of the Blavatsky-\nCoulomb letters in the Madras Christian College Magazine. Mr.\nJ. D. B. Gribble had also published a pamphlet at Madras in 1884\nconcerning the characteristics of the handwriting of these letters, and\nhad pointed out many of the peculiarities of Madame Blavatsky's\nordinary handwriting. Further, at the meetings of our Society, in\nMay and June, 1 885, I had myself described some of the peculiar for\nmations of Madame Blavatsky's handwriting especially in connection\nwith the K. H. documents. One would suppose, even apart from these\ncircumstances, that a letter offered to an expert as a specimen of\nMadame Blavatsky's undoubted ordinary handwriting with which to\ncompare some disputed document, should at least have been written\nbefore the publication of the Blavatsky-Coulomb documents. Obviously\nthe standard of her undoubted writing must not be such a standard\nas Madame Blavatsky herself would ex post facto provide. That she\nwished myself to use such a standard plainly appears in my Report\n(p. 281):-\nSoon after my arrival at Adyar [in the latter part of December, 1884], I\nasked for a specimen of Madame Blavatsky's undoubted handwriting,\u2014for\nthe purpose of comparison with the disputed documents. Mr. Damodar\navoided giving me any before Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott reached\nheadquarters, and after I had had some conversation with them on the\nsubject, Colonel Olcott said that Madame Blavatsky would write me a letter\nat once, if I wished, which I could use as a test document. I replied that it\nwould be desirable for me to have some manuscript that was written before\nthe appearance of the Christian College Magazine in September, whereupon\nColonel Olcott said abruptly that he could take no action as to giving me any\nhandwriting of Madame Blavatsky's until their own Committee had met, and\nthat Madame Blavatsky was in the hands of the Theosophical Society.\nMadame Blavatsky, finding that I would not use as my standard a\nletter professedly written by her for that purpose, nevertheless\nhoped, as I believe, that I might take as a standard some document of\nhers ostensibly written for another purpose. She therefore wrote out\ncertain statements concerning Madame Coulomb's charges. These\nwritings, as I have shown in pp. 290-1 of my Report, show a sudden\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 149\nchange as regards one of the most important characteristics of her ordin\nary writing of several years previous, besides other minor alterations,\nand they would therefore have proved an untrustworthy standard.\nThe device, therefore, which we might suppose that a person charged\nwith forgery would adopt, if opportunity were given, was actually\nadopted by Madame Blavatsky in my own case, and she may well have\nresorted to a similar device in her letters generally.\nNot only is this flaw manifest in the data submitted to Herr Schiitze.\nThe documents that caused Messrs. Netherclift and Sims to abandon\ntheir first opinion concerning the authorship of the K. H. documents\nwere a series obtained from Mr. Sinnett, \" eight specimens of the\nK. H. writing, which represented, some of them at least, consecutive\nperiods of time, beginning with the earliest letter received by Mr.\nSinnett.\" Whether this was known to Mr. Gebhard or not when\nhe invited the judgment of the German expert on a K. H. letter of\nSeptember, 1884,and a Madame Blavatsky letter received October, 1885,\nwritten a year after she knew that she was suspected of writing the\nK. H. letters as well as the Blavatsky-Coulomb letters\u2014I do not know.\nOne thing surely is very clear, viz., that the German expert was far\nfrom having as complete a set of data as those finally submitted to\nthe English experts,\u2014a very strange neglect, if anything more than\na mere contrary opinion was wanted. Were I now submitting the\ncase for judgment, I should provide the expert with letters written\nby Madame Blavatsky some time previous to the appearance of the\nfirst K. H. letter,\u2014with letters written about that time, shortly after\nwards, and after the public exposure. I should for comparison with\nthese submit the earliest K. H. documents, and later K. H. speci\nmens in chronological series ; and then put the inquiry as to whether\nthese \" might not perhaps be really by the same hand \" as the undoubted\nMadame Blavatsky letters.\nI notice what Mrs. Besant has to say about the \" fragmentary\nscript \" which I quoted in my Report in connection with my remarks\nas to the possible political significance of Madame Blavatsky's career.\nShe asserts that it is a \" discarded scrap of a translation, by Madame\nBlavatsky, of a Russian work, translated for and published in the\nPioneer, ordered and paid for by its editor, and to be read there by\nanyone who cares to do so.\" I am aware that Madame Blavatsky said\nsomething of this sort, and I gave her, in my Report, p. 317, the credit\nof this explanation, which Mrs. Besant produces years later as though\nit were a new or a well-established thing. In Mr. Sinnett's pamphlet,\nThe \"Occult World Phenomena,\" tfec., Madame Blavatsky said that\nit was \" afragment ofan old translation I made for the Pioneer from\nsome Russian travels in Central Asia \" (pp. 51-2) ; Mr. Sinnett speaks\n\f150 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nof it as \" evidently a discarded fragment \" or \" rejected page \" from\nthat translation, or possibly a slip that might have happened to fall\n\" from some other Russian translations which Madame Blavatsky . . .\nonce made for the Indian Foreign Office.\" I only refer to this \" script\"\nat all here because it seems to afford an illustration of Mrs. Besant's\nmethod of examination of much of the evidence before her. Madame\nBlavatsky says it is so, and it is so. From Mr. Sinnett's remarks (loc.\ncit., pp. 10-11) it is clear that he is putting forward what appears to\nhim to be an adequate explanation for the existence of the \" script.\"\nBut Mrs. Besant speaks as confidently as if she had in her hand the\ncopy of the Pioneer containing the passage. Let the reader not forget,\nhowever, that the scrap is spoken of as discarded. It is pertinent,\ntherefore, to ask Mrs. Besant what evidence there is for her assertion\nbeyond the fact that Madame Blavatsky said and Mr. Sinnett thinks it.\nI shall now consider very briefly the reply which Mr. Sinnett made\nin his pamphlet entitled The \" Occult World Phenomena \" and the\nSocietyfor Psychical Research.\nThe first case dealt with (Report, pp. 256-7) hinges on the time at\nMadame Blavatsky's disposal for surreptitiously opening a letter. In\nhis account in The Occult World Mr. Sinnett wrote that she had not\nbeen away to her own room thirty seconds, that she had not been out\nof his sight otherwise except for a minute or two in his wife's room,\nand that she spoke for a few minutes in the adjoining room to his wife.\nIn his statement before the Committee he said : \" She was out of my\nsight but for an instant of time when she cried out, ' Oh, he has taken\nit from me now.' I will undertake to say that she was not out of my\nsight for ten seconds. Having uttered that exclamation, she returned\nto the drawing-room, and we then proceeded together to my office at\nthe back of my house. I went on with what I was doing, and she\nsimply lay on the sofa in my full view.\" I said, \" After this I cannot\nfeel certain that Madame Blavatsky may not have been absent in her\nown room considerably more than 30 seconds, nor do I feel certain that\nMadame Blavatsky may not have retired to some other room [connected,\nsay, with Mrs. Sinnett's room] during the interval of ' a few minutes '\nwhich Mr. Sinnett assigns to her conversation with Mrs. Sinnett in the\nadjoining room.\" Mr. Sinnett does not tell us how long after the\nevent his account in The Occult World was written, and in giving his\naccount to the Committee he had manifestly completely forgotten the\nabsence of Madame Blavatsky in his wife's room. Readers of my\naccounts in the Proceedings of the lapses of memory to which human\ntestimony is liable will not think my conjecture unreasonable that\nMadame Blavatsky may have had a longer time at her disposal than\nMr. Sinnett afterwards estimated. And Mr. Sinnett fails apparently\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 151\nto see that the important point of the incident turns on a question of\nseconds.1\nWhere it is a question whether, for a task that might be\naccomplished in 30 seconds, ten seconds elapsed or thirty, and when\nthe recorder in one account estimates thirty and in another ten, the\ndiscrepancy is certainly noteworthy. I have not, however, dwelt upon\nthis point at any length in my Report, nor did I specially impeach\nMr. Sinnett's care in the rest of his narrative on account of this inci\ndent. Yet Mr. Sinnett frequently bespeaks the sympathy of his readers\non the ground that I make him out as an inaccurate observer because\nof this discrepancy of seconds (although, be it observed, the importance\nof the incident turns upon how many seconds were at Madame\nBlavatsky's disposal). He writes : \" Mr. Hodgson actually goes on in\nhis Report to argue that I must be an inaccurate and untrustworthy\nnarrator because of this discrepancy of my evidence about the ten and\nthe thirty seconds\" (p. 16). He speaks of my \"contention\" as \"the\nfoundation of the major part of Mr. Hodgson's subsequent theorising\nabout my book\" (p. 17); \"that impeachment continues to underlie all the\ngroundless pretences which Mr. Hodgson makes throughout this Report\nin regard to having shaken the value of my testimony \" (p. 21) ; \"it is\nonly by beginning with criticisms so absurd that it is difficult to\nunderstand how he can have vanquished the sense of shame he must\nhave felt in first endeavouring to work with them\u2014those concerning the\nten and thirty seconds\u2014that he was able to inaugurate the system on\nwhich he has striven to damage the credit of my story. That system\nhas been to level an undue reproach at me, and to keep referring\nto me as a man who has incurred that reproach \" (pp. 42-3). After\nall this the reader will be surprised to learn that beyond my first\nreference to the incident on p. 257 of my Report, I have made no\nreference whatever to the discrepancy in question. Not only have I\nmade no specific reference to the discrepancy, but where in the course\nof my criticisms I have made any general reference to Mr. Sinnett's\nwant of care, it is obvious from the context that I had other cases in\nmind, and not this particular instance.\nThe next case is that of a fall of a letter in a room at Crow's Nest\nBungalow. I supposed that this letter came through one of the\ncracks in the ceiling from a garret above, the only entrance to the\ngarret being a trapdoor in Madame Blavatsky's bedroom. There\nwere large interstices in the ceiling when I examined the place myself.\nI said it was to be \"inferred from Mr. Sinnett's accounts that he made\nno examination whatever of the ceiling either from the room below or\n1 The envelope which I described myself in my Report u having manipulated in\none minute I opened without any special appliances. I opened it shortly after it was\nclosed before the gum was dry.\n\f152 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nfrom the garret above.\" To this Mr. Sinnett practically makes no\nreply, though he still thinks that the phenomenon was genuine. \" Mr.\nSinnett thinks that, and I think differently,\"\u2014to change the words of\nMr. Sinnett's remarks\u2014but \" there is no particle of evidence to\nsupport Mr. Sinnett's belief, beyond the fact that Madame Blavatsky\nsuggested it.\"\nThe third case,\u2014writing in a \" sealed envelope,\"\u2014Mr. Sinnett,\nwhen deposing before the Committee, regarded as \" quite complete.\"\nHe now regards it as \" relatively trivial,\" and makes no reply to my\nstatements about the ease of opening the envelope and abstracting\nthe contents. Mr. Sinnett implies much in other places about the\nlight which he could have thrown on the subjects mentioned in my\nReport if he had only been consulted. This was one of the instances\nwhere he was consulted\u2014the result being to show at once that Mr.\nSinnett's account of the security of the letter-fastening was absurd,\nand that there was no evidence at all for the genuineness of the\nphenomenon (Report, pp. 258-9).\nIn the fourth case, the alleged instantaneous transportation of a\npiece of plaster plaque, the only reply which Mr. Sinnett makes\ndepends on a misrepresentation of my explanations. He regards me\nas supposing that the fragment found by him at Allahabad was a piece\nbroken off by itself by Madame Blavatsky, and he says that the\nnature of the fracture forbids this supposition. If the reader will refer\nto my Report (p. 260) he will see that I do not suppose this. I suppose\nthe mould to have been broken into several pieces, and that one of\nthose pieces was conveyed by ordinary means to Allahabad. I have\nexpressly avoided the supposition that Mr. Sinnett attributes to me.\nThus it appears that Mr. Sinnett makes no real reply to my statements\nabout this incident. Further, he makes no reply to my statements\nabout the alleged Mahatma letters connected therewith, and I refer\nthe reader specially to my detailed comments on this point in the foot\nnote on pp. 260-1 of my Report.\nFor Mr. Sinnett's remarks about the \" raps \" and \" astral bells \" I\nsimply refer to my Report, pp. 262-3.\nMr. Sinnett passes over my criticism of the incident of the \" pink\nnote in the tree.\"\nIn dealing with the incidents of the Simla picnic, and taking\nColonel Olcott's account as distinguished from Mr. Sinnett's, I pointed\nout that there was no special difficulty in supposing that the cup and\nsaucer and diploma had been prepared beforehand, and that the bottle\nof water might also have been provided with the assistance of Babula.\nMr. Sinnett seems to think that after all that I have said in other places\nabout the unreliability of Colonel Olcott's testimony, it is rather\nabsurd for me in this case to take Colonel Olcott's account rather than\n\fThe Defence of the Tfieosophists. 153\nhis own. Now I cannot say positively that cceteris paribus I should\nalways prefer Colonel Olcott's account of an incident to Mr. Sinnett's,\nbut in the present case Colonel Olcott's account was written apparently\non the day after the event, and he had also noted various circumstances\nin his diary. When Mr. Sinnett wrote his account does not appear.\nPresumably, however, it was much later. But, aside from all this,\ngiven two accounts by different persons who are both enthusiastic\nfollowers of and believers in the \" occult \" phenomena of Madame\nBlavatsky, it is obvious that we must not choose the account which\nrenders the phenomenon more difficult of explanation by ordinary\nmeans. Further still, it is plain from even so much of Colonel Olcott's\naccount as Mr. Sinnett is now willing to admit as being \" broadly\nspeaking right,\" that Mr. Sinnett omitted from his narrative certain\nimportant facts about Madame Blavatsky's direction of the party. Yet\nMr. Sinnett not improbably had these facts in his mind when he itali\ncised the word \" exact \" in The Occult World, p. 49 : \" The exact spot\non which the ladies' jampans were deposited was chosen by myself in\nconcert with the gentleman referred to above as X .\" There is there\nfore still more reason for accepting Colonel Olcott's account in pre\nference to Mr. Sinnett's. And I remind the reader once more that of\nthe seven principals at the picnic, Mr. and Mrs. Sinnett and Colonel\nOlcott were the only ones who came away believing. Judge M., Major\nHenderson, and Mrs. R d looked upon the alleged phenomena as\nfraudulent. The \" cup and saucer \" incident depended upon the\nappearance of a seventh person who was supposed to have been unex\npected. The seventh person was Judge M. Did Mr. Sinnett ever ask\nhim whether Madame Blavatsky had not specially invited him to\ncome 1\nMr. Sinnett makes no reply whatever to my statements concerning\nthe \" brooch \" incident (Report, pp. 267-8), no reply whatever to my\nstatements concerning the cigarette phenomena (Report, pp. 268-9).\nHis reply to my statements concerning the \" pillow incident \" I am\ncontent to leave for comparison with my explanation of it (Report,\np. 270), together with my comments on the incident of the \"pink note in\nthe tree \" (Report, pp. 263-5). I observe that Mr. Sinnett makes no\nallusion to the corroboration of my view which is afforded by the Koot\nHoomi note incidents which formed part of the day's events.\nThe next case is the Jhelum telegram incident ; concerning which\nMr. Sinnett remarks : \" Mr. Hodgson has not much to say that is very\ncrushing about the Jhelum incident itself, except to suggest that Madame\nBlavatsky may have read my letter and ' have telegraphed the right reply\nto a confederate ' at Jhelum.\" If the reader will refer to my Report,\npp. 272-273, he will see that what I suggest as the probable explana\ntion, in the paragraph beginning on p. 272 and ending on p. 273, is\n\f154 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nvery different, and that Mr. Sinnett makes no reply whatever to the\nstatements there made.\nIn dealing with the last incident under discussion, that of the\n\" profile portrait,\" Mr. Sinnett takes occasion to \" conjecture \" (possibly\nfor the purpose of suggesting to his readers that my \" conjectures \"\nmay be as worthless as this one of his) that the \" blue shading drawings \"\nshown to me as specimens of Madame Blavatsky's handiwork, were\nshown to me \"as occult precipitations of hers, though he now calmly\nsuppresses this.\" To this I have simply to say that they were shown\nto me as specimens of her ordinary handiwork, and not as \" occult pre\ncipitations.\" Whether they have ever been shown to other persons\nas \" occult precipitations \" I do not know. I spoke of the \" exiguity\nof Mr. Sinnett's account \" of the production of the profile portrait\nto which he refers. Mr. Sinnett apparently takes offence at the word\n\" exiguity \", as though it were unjustly applied. He thinks that\nthere is \" nothing to allege or urge against the story,\" and that \" there\nis no getting out of the conclusion that on this occasion an occult\nphenomenon was wrought.\" Now it seemed to me so obvious that the\ndifficulty lay not in getting out of but in getting into such a conclusion,\nthat I did not consider the incident in detail. I will now do so.\nMr. Sinnett's account in his pamphlet (p. 38) is : \" The paper was seen\nto be blank before breakfast, left in a book on the table in sight of us\nall while we had that meal, and found to bear a portrait when we\nwent to look at it immediately afterwards.\" The account I shall\nconsider is not this but that given much earlier,\u2014though we are not\ntold how soon after the incident the account was written\u2014in The\nOccult World, pp. 137-8 :\u2014\nNow in aspiring to have a portrait of Koot Hoomi, of course I was wish\ning for a precipitated picture, and it would seem that just before a recent\nvisit that Madame Blavatsky paid to Allahabad, something must have been\nsaid to her about a possibility that this wish of mine might be gratified.\nFor the day she came she asked me to give her a piece of thick white paper\nand mark it. This she would leave in her scrap-book, and there was reason\nto hope that a certain highly advanced chela, or pupil, of Koot Hoomi's,\nnot a full adept himself as yet, but far on the road to that condition, would\ndo what was necessary to produce the portrait.\nNothing happened that day nor that night. The scrap-book remained\nlying on a table in the drawing-room, and was occasionally inspected. The\nfollowing morning it was looked into by my wife, and my sheet of paper was\nfound to be still blank. Still the scrap-book lay in full view on the drawing-\nroom table. At half-past eleven we went to breakfast ; the dining-room, as\nis often the case in Indian bungalows, only being separated from the\ndrawing-room by an archway and curtains, which were drawn aside. While\nwe were at breakfast, Madame Blavatsky suddenly showed by the signs with\nwhich all who know her are familiar, that one of her occult friends was near.\nIt was the chela to whom I have above referred. She got up, thinking she\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 155\nmight be required to go to her room ; but the astral visitor, she said, waved\nher back, and she returned to the table. After breakfast we looked into the\nscrap-book, and on my marked sheet of paper, which had been seen blank\nby my wife an hour or two before, was a precipitated profile portrait. The\nface itself was left white, with only a few touches within the limits of the\nspace it occupied ; but the rest of the paper all round it was covered with\ncloudy blue shading. Slight as the method was by which the result was\nproduced, the outline of the face was perfectly well-defined, and its expres\nsion as vividly rendered as would have been possible with a finished picture.\nThe interval between Mrs. Sinnett's looking at the blank paper and\nthe discovery of the portrait is described vaguely as \"an hour or two.\"\nWe may therefore assume that the interval may have been at least two\nhours. Now Mr. Sinnett says nothing about any person's keeping a\ncontinuous watch during that whole time over the scrap-book contain\ning the \" blank piece of paper.\" It is a fair inference from his account\nthat such a continuous watch was not even attempted, much less suc\ncessfully carried out. Referring to the day and night previous he\nwrites : \" The scrap-book remained lying on a table in the drawing-\nroom, and was occasionally inspected.\" For all that appears in Mr.\nSinnett's account, Madame Blavatsky might have had ample oppor\ntunity between the time of Mrs. Sinnett's inspection and the \" discovery\"\nof the portrait to produce the drawing by ordinary means on the very\nsheet of paper that Mrs. Sinnett previously saw blank,\u2014not to speak\nof the possibility of substituting another similarly marked sheet with\nthe drawing on it, or of re-substituting the originally marked sheet\n(with drawing) for an imitation sheet temporarily taking the place of\nthe first in the scrap-book. The scrap-book, moreover, belonged to\nMadame Blavatsky. I repeat, then, that Mr. Sinnett's account is\n\" exiguous.\" We need to be assured that the scrap-book was under\ncontinuous observation by trustworthy persons during the whole time\nthat elapsed between Mrs. Sinnett's inspection of the blank paper and\nthe discovery of the portrait. As to the method of and the persons\nconcerned in such continuous observation, their positions, the position\nof Madame Blavatsky, details of the examinations before and after of\nthe scrap-book and the blank paper, possibilities of imitation of mark\non paper, of substitution, &c.\u2014all such considerations meet with no\nmention in Mr. Sinnett's account.\nMr. Sinnett claims in his pamphlet (p. 42) to have shown that\n\" there is no force whatever in the objections which Mr. Hodgson\nbrings against any one of the long series of experiences related in my\nbook.\" To my objections to some of these experiences, Mr. Sinnett,\nas we have seen, makes no reply whatever. Whether his remarks in\nconnection with the other experiences show that there is no force in\nmy objections to accepting them as \"occult phenomena\" may now be\nleft to the reader's determination. Mr. Sinnett's faith in Madame\n\f156 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nBlavatsky I do not have any expectation of disturbing. The question\nis whether the alleged phenomena can be accounted for by ordinary\nmeans, whether the possibilities of trickery have been excluded. Mr.\nSinnett himself declared (The Occult World, p. 35) that it was\n\" impossible to proceed by any other but scientific modes of investigation.\nIn any experiments I have tried I have always been careful to exclude, not\nmerely the probability, but the possibility of trickery : and where it has\nbeen impossible to secure the proper conditions, I have not allowed the\nresults of the experiments to enter into the sum total of my conclusions.\"\nWhat I have said in my Report (p. 273) I venture to repeat here :\u2014\nOn the whole, then, I think I am justified in saying that the phenomena\nrelied upon by Mr. Sinnett in Thc Occult World can be accounted for much\nmore satisfactorily than can the performances of any ordinary professional\nconjurer by the uninitiated observer, however acute ; that the additional\ndetails which I have been enabled to furnish in connection with some of the\nincidents Mr. Sinnett has recorded, clearly show that he has not been in the\nhabit of exercising due caution for the exclusion of trickery ; and that he\nhas not proceeded in accordance with those \"scientific modes of investiga\ntion \" which he explicitly declares (Occult World, p. 35) he regarded as\nnecessary for the task he attempted.\nI pass on to deal with certain statements made by Mr. Sinnett in\nthe Review of Reviews for June, 1891. He writes on p. 550, referring\nto my Report : \" Bit by bit the famous Report has been torn to pieces\nby competent critics, till hardly a rag of it remains ; \" and on p. 556 :\n\" The few people who had been intimate with Madame Blavatsky all\nthrough the period of the transactions referred to, showed by degrees,\nin various pamphlets and articles, how worthless Mr. Hodgson's\nconclusions were, how fatally he had been hoodwinked by the enemies\nof the Theosophical movement at Madras, and how narrow-minded and\nunjust his methods of inquiry had been.\"\nThe best way to meet this statement is to consider it with reference\nto the summary of my Report.1\nIn the first place, a large number of letters produced by M. and Madame\nCoulomb, formerly Librarian and Assistant Corresponding Secretary respec\ntively of the Theosophical Society, were, in the opinion of the best experts in\nhandwriting, written by Madame Blavatsky. These letters, which extend\nover the years 1880-1883 inclusive, and some of which were published in the\nMadras Christian, College Magazine for September, 1884, prove that Madame\nBlavatsky has been engaged in the production of a varied and long-continued\nseries of fraudulent phenomena, in which she has been assisted by the\nCoulombs. The circumstantial evidence which I was able to obtain concern-\n1 The reader's attention may also be directed again to the conspicuous cases of\nfraud mentioned by our Committee, which did not come within the limits of my own\ninvestigations in India. I refer to the \" Kiddle incident,\" and the attempt to deceive\nMr. C. C. Massey by a bogus marveL See Proceedings, VoL III., pp. 206-7, 397-400.\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 157\ning the incidents referred to in these letters, corroborates the judgment of\nthe experts in handwriting.\nIn the second place, apart altogether from either these letters or the\nstatements of the Coulombs, who themselves allege that they were con\nfederates of Madame Blavatsky, it appears from my own inquiries concerning\nthe existence and the powers of the supposed Adepts or Mdhatmaa, and the\nmarvellous phenomena alleged to have occurred in connection with the\nTheosophical Society,\n1. That the primary witnesses to the existence of a Brotherhood with\noccult powers,\u2014viz., Madame Blavatsky, Mr. Damodar K.\nMavalankar, Mr. Bhavani Shankar, and Mr. Babajee D. Nath,\u2014\nhave in other matters deliberately made statements which they\nmust have known to be false, and that therefore their assertions\ncannot establish the existence of the Brotherhood in question.\n2. That the comparison of handwritings further tends to show that\nKoot Hoomi Lai Sing and Mahatma Morya are fictitious person\nages, and that most of the documents purporting to have emanated\nfrom these \"personages,\" and especially from \"K. H.\" (Koot\nHoomi Lai Sing), are in the disguised handwriting of Madame\nBlavatsky herself, who originated the style of the K. H. hand\nwriting ; and that some of the K. H. writing is the handiwork of\nMr. Damodar in imitation of the writing developed by Madame\nBlavatsky.\n3. That in no single phenomenon which came within the scope of my\ninvestigation in India, was the evidence such as would entitle it\nto be regarded as genuine, the witnesses for the most part being\nexceedingly inaccurate in observation or memory, and having\nneglected to exercise due care for the exclusion of fraud ; while\nin the case of some of the witnesses there has been much\nconscious exaggeration and culpable misstatement.\n4. That not only was the evidence insufficient to establish the\ngenuineness of the alleged marvels, but that evidence furnished\npartly by my own inspection, and partly by a large number of\nwitnesses, most of them Theosophists, concerning the structure,\nposition, and environment of the Shrine, concerning \"Mahatma\"\ncommunications received independently of the Shrine, and\nconcerning various other incidents, including many of the\nphenomena mentioned in The Occult World, besides the numerous\nadditional suspicious circumstances which I have noted in the\ncourse of dealing in detail with the cases considered, renders\nthe conclusion unavoidable that the phenomena in question were\nactually due to fraudulent arrangement.\nAs regards the first main point I am not aware that any testimony\nworth consideration has been brought forward to show that the\nBlavateky-Coulomb documents were not written by Madame Blavatsky,\n(or that they were written by the Coulombs or by Black Magicians), or\nto offset the circumstantial evidence which I adduced in confirmation\nof the opinion of experts in handwriting.\n\f158 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nAs regards the next series of points, I am not aware of any attempt\nto prove\n(1) that the statements of Madame Blavatsky, Damodar, Bhavani\nShankar, and Babajee are to be regarded as trustworthy ;\n(3) that the evidence for any of the phenomena which I\ninvestigated in India is such as would entitle it to be\nregarded as genuine (unless Mr. Sinnett's pamphlet is\nregarded as an attempt to prove the genuineness of some of\nthe experiences related in The Occult World. See below).\nAttempts have been made to deal with (2) and partially with (4).\n(2) is met by pointing to the fallibility of experts and to the\nopinion of Herr Schiitze. I have already shown that the\nopinion of Herr Schiitze was founded upon inadequate data,\nand I may now add that, so far as I am aware, no attempt\nhas been made to show how the various similarities between\nMadame Blavatsky's writing and the series of K. H.\ndocuments\u2014together with other related points which I have\nenumerated\u2014can be accounted for on any other supposition\nthan that Madame Blavatsky's hand wrote them.\nWith reference to the K. H. writings ascribed to the handiwork of\nMadame Blavatsky there are two points to be observed :\u2014,\n(a) That they were produced under circumstances which did not\npreclude Madame Blavatsky's actually having written them ;\n(b) that the similarities which I have pointed out between those\nK. H. writings and Madame Blavatsky's ordinary writing,\nand the gradual elimination of Blavatskian forms in the\ncourse of development of the K. H. writings, and the changes\nin Madame Blavatsky's ordinary writing, afford abundant\nproof that Madame Blavatsky actually did write them.\nNo attempt has been made to deal with either of these points in\ndetail. Similar statements apply to the K. H. writings attributed\nto Damodar.\nConcerning (4) Mr. Sinnett has offered a reply (considered\nabove, pp. 150-6) to my examination of his accounts of phenomena\nmentioned in The Occult World, and he quotes old testimony concern\ning the Shrine which throws no new light whatever on the subject,\nand nearly all of which is given in my own Report, together with\nmuch more of a similar character, and from superior witnesses. I am\nnot aware that any attempt has been made to deal with the other\nincidents which come under the head of (4), such as Damodar's alleged\n\" astral \" journeys, the alleged appearances of Mahatmas, either in their\nordinary or in their \" astral \" bodies, Mr. Hume's evidence, numerous\nalleged precipitated writings, including Mr. G.'s letter and Professor\nSmith's letter, and other instances.\n\fThe Defence of the Theosophists. 159\nSo far, then, as I am aware, much the larger part of my Report has\nnot been even touched by any person, while such attempts at replies as\nhave been made, both by their ignorance of the actual circumstances\nand by the temper of mind displayed in the language used by the\nwriters, strengthen my previously expressed opinion that \" not only\nwas the evidence insufficient to establish the genuineness of the alleged\nmarvels,\" but that the evidence obtained in many of the cases ren\ndered \" the conclusion unavoidable that the phenomena in question\nwere actually due to fraudulent arrangement.\"\nIn a final word I must remind my readers that I have been dealing\nin this paper, as I have dealt throughout, with the phenomena alleged\nby Madame Blavatsky in support of the tenets which she preached,\nand not with those tenets themselves. Of those streams of super\nhuman knowledge I will only say that I prefer to tap them at least\none stage nearer to their fountain-heads.1 I lay claim to no vast\nerudition. But the sources which were good enough for Madame\nBlavatsky are good enough for me ; and so long as Bonn's Classical\nLibrary and Triibner's Oriental Library are within reach of a modest\npurse I shall prefer to draw on those useful repertories for my ideas of\nPlatonic and Buddhistic thought ;\u2014even though I should thus be\nobliged to receive those ideas in a bald, old-fashioned shape ;\u2014unspiced\nwith fraudulent marvels, and uncorroborated by the forged corre\nspondence of fictitious Teachers of Truth.\n1 Mr. W. E. Coleman, of San Francisco, CaL, has pointed out voluminous\nplagiarisms and contradictions in Madame Blavatsky's writings. I may refer especi\nally to his articles in the Religio-Philoiopkical Journal(Chicago, IlL),for August 10th-\nSeptember 7th, 1889 ; in The Golden Way (San Francisco) for April-October, 1891 ;\nand in The Carrier Dove (San Francisco) for March, 1891-February, 1893 (and suc\nceeding numbers to be published).\n\f160 Dr. A.

Many pamphlets on\nMind-cure, 4c., known to us by their titles, are not procurable in England.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdea. 161\nMind-cure 1 denies that matter exists, or that evil exists, and heals the\npatient by inspiring him with the conviction that he is a pure spirit,\nunassailable by disease or pain. The Faith-cure teaches that pain and\ndisease, although really existing, can be dispelled by an act of faith in\nthe Divine power. Established science meets this movement with\nprecisely that ' contempt prior to examination ' which your Society has\nin so many similar instances replaced by an examination which has\nnot led to contempt.\"\nA second appeal of similar tenor reaches us from a quite different\nquarter. A distinguished English Catholic, Father Clarke, S.J., whose\nadvocacy of the Lourdes miracles2 is well known, calls our attention to\nthe evidence for these extraordinary cures, and assures us of the welcome\nwhich any serious inquirer will find at Lourdes itself. This appeal also\ncommands our attention. Unable at the present moment to find a com\npetent physician disposed to give the time necessary for adequate\ninquiry on the spot, we feel bound at least to place before our readers\nsome preliminary statement which may interest others in the problem\nof this great pilgrimage ;\u2014unrivalled as it is in modern days, and\nsupported by many volumes of evidence as to sudden cures, some of\nwhich are stated to transcend all human possibility.\nThe competence of the present writers to pronounce a valid opinion\non either of these main problems is greatly impaired by the fact that\nwe have not been able to study on the spot and at first hand either the\nAmerican mind-healing or the cures which take place at Lourdes. On\nthe other hand, we both of us bring to the task one obvious pre-requisite\nof any fruitful discussion ;\u2014namely, a considerable familiarity with\nhypnotic therapeutics, and with other forms of self-suggestion. One\nof us possesses the equally indispensable qualification of conversance,\nduring a good many years, with the diagnosis and registration of disease\nand cure as practised in modern hospitals of repute. The special qualifi\ncation (if such it can be called) of the other writer lies in the fact that,\nhaving already avowed his belief in the reality of some manifestations\nof discarnate souls, he is one of the very few non-Catholics who cannot\nbe challenged in limine by believers in manifestations of the Virgin\nMary at Lourdes as entering upon the inquiry with a mind already\nfixed in negation.\nIn conformity with the usual rule in these Proceedings, the main\n1 We have adopted the more reasonable name for this system, and advise its\nadherents to drop the title of \"Christian Science,\" which has naturally incurred both\nChristian and scientific disapproval.\na The word \" miracle \" is not of our choosing-, and seems to be used at present in a\nsomewhat arbitrary way. It is not commonly applied to supernormal phenomena\nbelieved to occur in the presence of \"mediums,\" or in an apparently spontaneous\nfashion ; butonly to such phenomena when regarded as supportingsome religiouscreed.\n\f162 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\npart of our task will consist in examining, not the theories which are\nproposed to us, but the actual first-hand evidence offered in their\nsupport. But since we have to deal with several discrepant theories,\neach of them supported by alleged facts of the same general kind, we\nmust needs consider first of all to what extent we can treat these\nvarious theories and facts all together ;\u2014what is their respective posi\ntion in some more general survey of human beliefs in the matter of\ndisease and cure.\nDisease is a matter first for diagnosis, then for therapeutic. \"We\nhave first to find out what is wrong, and then to find out how to set it\nright. Now diagnosis may be objective or subjective, and therapeutic\nmay be physiological or psychical. In primitive times these aspects\nwere confused vaguely together. Disease was diagnosed partly by\nobjective symptoms,\u2014as when a white nose indicated frost-bite ;\u2014but\nmainly by subjective notions,\u2014as when the patient said that he felt-\nsomething inside him, and the medicine-man told him it was a devil.\nSo also therapeutic was always partly physiological ;\u2014since the most\nsuperstitious Samoyede would rub his neighbour's frost-bitten nose with\nsnow in preference to uttering incantations. But it was mainly\npsychical, consisting of such charms, ceremonies, invocations, as tradi\ntion assigned for the cure of a disease which tradition had already\ndiagnosed after its own fashion.\nNow the aim of Science, from Hippocrates onwards, has been to\nmake diagnosis as far as possible objective, and therapeutic as far as\npossible physiological. In examining a patient in a modern hospital,\nwe rely much on observable and measurable facts ; less on the patient's\nown statements of what he feels ; least of all on his theories as to how\nhe came to feel it. In doctoring him, we rely much on definite opera\ntions and on those few drugs part of whose action on the human\norganism we can in some sense prove and show ; little on the patient's\nown prayers for recovery ;\u2014least of all, perhaps, on the encouraging\nwords which, in common humanity, we ourselves throw in.\nBut this objective mode of regarding disease and cure, however\ndominant at Guy's or St. Bartholomew's, has not yet spread itself over\nthe mass of mankind. Diagnosis continues to be largely subjective ;\u2014\nthe patient deeming himself a better judge of what is the matter with\nhim than anyone else can be, and the physician mistaking functional\nfor organic maladies, and hysterical disability for anatomical lesion.\nAnd the whole practice of therapeutic continues to show traces of\npre-scientific beliefs ;\u2014 ideas which assume new forms in each genera\ntion, but which carry us back to each in turn of the stages of thought\nwhich we associate with the slow development of civilised man.\n1. Felichism, or the primitive belief that certain objects, inanimate\n.and inert, could cure disease by application to the body, shows itself,\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 163\nslightly disguised, in such phenomena as the wide sale of Harness'\nElectropathic Belts. The practical inertness of these appliances has\nnow been proved in a court of law ; nor was any valid evidence ever\noffered for their alleged power. Assertion was enough ;\u2014assertion\nadapted to that belief in the mysterious potency of electricity which is\nthe modern counterpart of ancient beliefs in the mysterious potency of\ntalisman or totem. Yet how many sufferers have traced their cures to\nwhat is,\u2014to use gentle terms,\u2014a purely commercial product !\n2. Polytheism. The transition from fetichistic to polytheistic\nconceptions of cure is, of course, a gradual one. It may be said to\nbegin when curative properties are ascribed to objects not arbitrarily,\nnor on account of the look of the objects themselves, but on account\nof their having been blessed or handled by some divine or semi-divine\npersonage, or having formed part of his body or surroundings during\nsome incarnation. Thus Lourdes water, bottled and exported, is still\nheld to possess curative virtue on account of the Virgin's original\nblessing bestowed upon the Lourdes spring. But generally the\ninfluence of the divine or divinised being is more directly exercised, as\nin oracles, dreams, invisible touches, or actual theophanies, or appear\nances of the gods to the adoring patient. It will be seen as we proceed\nhow amply the tradition of Lourdes has incorporated these ancient aids\nto faith.\n3. Monotheism. Theological distinctions between polytheism and\nmonotheism lie, of course, outside our present purpose. Practices\noriginally polytheistic may continue (as in fact at Lourdes) under a\nreligion which looks up to one Supreme God. Our point here is that\nwhen subordinate divinities, saints, or spirits are wholly excluded,\nprayer may still be regarded as potent to effect cures ; and signs of\nanswer to prayer may still be sought. Here come in many Protestant\nforms of belief (the Peculiar People, ifec.) which the modern Faith-\nhealing does but present in a concentrated form.\n4. Metaphysics. Once more, when there is no longer a belief in a\npersonal Deity or in a direct answer to prayer, there may still be ways\nof regarding the Universe which seem to confer upon man some mode\nof issue from bodily pain. Oriental ideas of the unreality of matter\n(Maya) ; Stoical ideas of the Sage's command over external circum\nstances ; mystical ideas of the painless ecstacy into which the purified\nspirit can enter at will ;\u2014all these conceptions have the advantage of\nbeing independent of dogmatic systems ; with the accompanying\ndisadvantage of being difficult for ordinary minds to grasp. Mind-\nhealing is a modern name for this ancient and lofty protest against the\ntyranny of the flesh.\nWe have roughly arranged these forms of psycho-therapeutic in\nthe order of their historical evolution in the mind of man. But it\nM 2\n\f164 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ndoes not follow that all these notions together, or any one of them,\nmust necessarily be the mere figment of the uncivilised brain. On the\ncontrary, it is evident, it is certain, that there is truth in them some\nwhere. Cures are and always have been effected by other than\ndemonstrably physiological means. It is the business of science not to\nignore such cures, but to discover how they are in fact obtained.\nAnd here, broadly speaking, there are two alternative possibilities.\nEither all these quasi-psychical cures can be referred to physiological\nmeans which have escaped detection, or they cannot be so referred, and\nthere is a psychological basis which must be inquired into in other ways.\nThe former of these alternatives is what science should naturally desire.\nJust as endemic maladies once ascribed to the wrath of heaven are now\ndiscerned to be due to microbes, so also we might conceivably discover\nthat the cures ascribed, say, to the touch of saintly personages were due,\nnot to their saintliness or their dogmatic views, but to some physical\neffluence communicable from one organism to another. If this were so\nit would be a physiological effect, and the purely physiological explana\ntion of psychological marvels would have made an enormous stride. It\nis strange to remember that this thesis was actually advanced by\nMesmer, whose system of emanations from living organisms, metals,\nmagnets, crystals, was thus an early attempt at extending physiological\nand physical laws over a region till then abandoned to miracle. His\ntheories, however, were neither proposed nor received in a scientific\nspirit ; and it was easy to show that many of the phenomena could not\nplausibly be explained by such effluences as he assumed to be acting.\nDifferent portions of his general theory (metallaesthesia, influence of\nmagnets, passes, &c.,) are now believed, in altered forms, by different\nschools of thought ; but with these modes of sensitivity we have at\npresent no concern. So far as they exist, they are physiological ; and\nour present object is to disengage the psychological element in thera\npeutic, with the view of deciding whether any of the modern theories\nset before us for discussion has a predominant or specific value of its\nown.\nWe may, then, take it as admitted that the first of the two alter\nnative possibilities of which we spoke above,\u2014the possibility of explain\ning the whole of psycho-therapeutics by purely physiological means,\u2014\nis not yet an accomplished fact. Where Mesmer's loose generalities\nfailed, the less grotesque but not more demonstrable hypotheses of\nmodern physiologists have failed also. 'We need not here attempt to\nprove this in detail. It is enough to say that the now accepted formula\nfor all these quasi-psychical cures, as we have termed them, is simply\nthe word suggestion. Now if, as is now commonly held, we have not\nhere to do with any real effluence proceeding from one organism to\nanother, this suggestion from others, being nothing more than verbal, is\nI Mill\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 165\nvirtually resolved into self-suggestion ; and in fact we see that self-sug\ngestion\u2014itself no more than a formula\u2014is gradually supplanting all\nother formulae in psycho-therapeutics. That is to say, the second of the\ntwo alternative possibilities at present holds the field. We are forced\nto recognise in these cures a true psychological problem. There is action,\nas we say, \" of the mind upon the body,\" which may be exerted in\nmany modes, and from many causes, all equally beyond our ken.\nThis, then, is in one sense a favourable moment for the supporters,\nwhether of mind-cure or miracle, to press their claim. They find the\nmedical world,\u2014especially on the Continent,\u2014prepared carefully to\nconsider well-attested accounts of cures such as in earlier generations\nwould have been contemptuously dismissed without inquiry. But, on\nthe other hand, those who wish to prove some specific and peculiar\nefficacy in any one mode of psycho-therapeutics must be prepared to\nshow that its effects,\u2014its clearly traceable and well-attested effects,\u2014go\nbeyond any recorded effects of self-suggestion ;\u2014that the cures cannot\nbe paralleled by cures occurring without metaphysical meditations, or\nprayers, or the intervention of the Virgin Mary.\nWe shall have, in fact, to deal with alleged miracles of healing in\nthe same way as we have already dealt in these Proceedings with the\nalleged miracles of a physical or \" telekinetic \" type. Those\n\" mediumistic \" marvels, evidentially considered, have fallen naturally\ninto three classes. A first and largest class we have rejected in limine\nfor lack of first-hand, contemporaneous, exact attestation. A second\nlarge class we have discussed minutely, and have shown that they could\nbe paralleled by phenomena due to ordinary causes (including fraud),\u2014\nor at least that they could be so nearly thus paralleled that the margin\nof difference was not greater than ordinary human inaccuracy or\nprepossession might easily cover. A third small class are not obviously\nliable to these fatal objections. Some of Mr. Crookes', Lord Crawford's,\nLord Dunraven's observations are very well attested, and have not\nyet been plausibly paralleled by any familiar phenomena, or explained\nby any known laws. These experiences still stand too much alone to\ncommand general scientific assent. But should similar phenomena be\nmore widely observed in the future, the existence of these records\nwill strongly confirm the fresh observations. Meanwhile we must, of\ncourse, be on the look out for any hitherto undetected explanation\nwhich may bring these marvels into line with the rest ^of our\nknowledge.\nCases which would fall within the first two of these classes we\nshall doubtless find in the collection of evidence as to supernormal\nhealings which we have now to examine,\u2014as in all collections of\nmiscellaneous evidence to extraordinary facts. The important question\nis whether any, and, if so, what proportion of cases will survive this\n\f166 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nsifting process and appear in our third class, as marvels as yet\nunparalleled and unexplained, and which, if sufficiently repeated, may\ncompel our assent to their specific supernormal or miraculous claims.\nFirst, then, let us consider what is the kind of medical evidence,\nwhich the reports submitted to us ought to possess, and some fragment\nof which they must needs possess, if they are to claim any sort of con\nsideration.\nA good history of any medical case should consist of first-hand\ndetailed, expert evidence, supported by objective, and as far as possible\nby automatic records. Let us consider the terms of this definition in\norder.\nFirst-hand.\u2014Strictly speaking, the evidence should come at first\nhand both from the physician and from the patient. In disputed cases\n(as where the physician is charged with incompetence) this double\ntestimony may be essential. But in cases where (as in those which we\nhave here to consider) the patient agrees with the physician, and the\nseveral physicians (if there be several) agree among themselves, we may\naccept the physician's report of the patient's statement, which the\nphysician, of course, is bound to record as carefully as the objective\nfeatures of the case.\nDetailed.\u2014The physician when writing his account should endea\nvour to supply expert readers with the materials for forming a judgment\nof their own. Thus he is bound to give us not only a description of\nthe case as he sees it, but also a history in which the patient's own\nstatements are confirmed or otherwise by such other testimony as can be\nprocured. In many cases the history, including heredity and early\nenvironment, is the most instructive part of the whole record.\nExpert.\u2014This is plainly a question of degree. But we must insist\non having a physician's account ; since experience, not only in hospitals\nbut in private practice, has abundantly shown how defective and un\ntrustworthy an account of disease may be given by a layman,\u2014himself\nperhaps more intelligent than his physician, but unfamiliar with those\ndetailed and elaborate rules which enable even the dullest inheritor of\nthe great mass of clinical science and tradition to describe the complex,\nconfused phenomena of bodily disease in such a way that other experts\nshall understand him. Be it noted, however, that the great goddess\nHysteria can sometimes deceive ^Ssculapius, and that in such a contest\nof wits the expertry is not always on the side of the profession.\nSupported by objective records.\u2014All things in this world are\nfallible, but men are more fallible than thermometers. The patient's\ncurve of temperature is often more instructive than anything which\ncither he or his doctor can tell us. In all scientific observation,\nindeed, it is an object to have as many facts as possible recorded by\ninstruments which need only to be read off, or stamped upon impersonal\n.1\n\fWind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 167\ntranscripts which can be studied at leisure. And the progress of\nmedicine has consisted largely in the accumulation of registers of this\ntype ;\u2014numerical records of pulse, respiration, temperature ; localised\nrecords of results of auscultation and percussion, of muscular strength\nand electrical condition ; chemical analysis of excreta ; micro-photo\ngraphs of bacterial or cellular contents of sputa ; measured results of\nexamination in the waking state and also under anaesthetics, so as to\neliminate conscious or unconscious muscular contraction.\nWe enumerate forms of evidence every one of which would have\nbeen of important service in many of the cases with which we have to\ndeal. To what extent they have been actually offered to our scrutiny we\nshall see as we proceed. Only let our readers at once understand\nthat if no definite evidence whatever of these kinds be supplied, and if\nwe are also ignorant as to the degree of professional skill and knowledge\npossessed by the reporting physician, our own judgement on the case\ncan hardly go beyond conjecture.\nJudging by the antecedent history of the various modes of\npsychical healing now proposed to us,\u2014by their position in the scheme\nof psycho-therapeutics set forth above,\u2014it is for mind-healing that\nwe should at first sight be disposed to predict the most lasting success.\nFor here (as already pointed out) we have the most abstract form of\nself-suggestion,\u2014the form least involved with dogma liable to attack\nor disproof. We are all agreed that, whatever sense we attach to\nmatter and mind, what we call mind does in some way affect what we\ncall matter, and there is nothing absurd in trying to make our mind\naffect the matter of our own bodies as strongly as it can.\nNothing absurd, we say, in this effort itself. We do not say that\nsome of its preachers have not done their best to make it so. The\nsixtieth edition of Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,\nby Mary Baker G. Eddy, President of Massachusetts Metaphysical\nCollege, lies before us. It begins with the following words : \" In the\nyear 1866 I discovered the Science of Metaphysical Healing, and\nnamed it Christian Science. God had been graciously fitting me,\nduring many years, for the reception of a final revelation of the\nabsolute Principle of ' Scientific Mind-healing.' \" We did not close the\nbook after this passage, and were rewarded by finding (p. 441) a\ndemonstration,\u2014whose naivete' is only one step from the sublime,\n\u2014of the essential necessity of our somewhat toilsome perusal : \" A\nChristian Scientist requires my work on Science and Health for his\ntext book, and so do all his students and patients. Why ? First :\nBecause it is the voice of Truth to this age, and contains the whole\nof Christian Science, or the science of healing through Mind. Second : \"\n\u2014but the first reason really seems enough by itself.\nNow, a style of this sort in a popular manual by no means proves\n\f168 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nthat self-suggestion may not be successfully practised by many readers\non the lines there laid down. On the contrary, these gentle indications\nof personal merit, like the chariots and trumpets of the itinerant quack,\nmay actually predispose some minds to the belief desired. But it\nshows us nevertheless that the buyers of the sixty editions are not\nlikely to have much sympathy with science of a more humble and\nordinary type, or to have taken the pains to record very accurately\nthe cures attained by such a \" high priori road.\"\nWe know, however, by correspondence that much disinterested\nzeal for others' welfare,\u2014as well as much of eager personal hope,\u2014is\nbeing thrown into the effort to live up to the belief that Matter and\nEvil are non-existent, and that Spirit and Good are all in all. We\nregret the more that the actual evidence which we can obtain of the\ngood results reached by this ardent abstraction of thought should be\nas yet so extremely scanty. There must be more behind ;\u2014and we\nearnestly hope that those who have it in their power to send us such\nevidence may recognise that while we join with them in deprecating\nthe follies which have sprung up around their line of effort, our atti\ntude towards that effort itself is one of cordial interest and sympathy.\nAn American friend in whom we have entire confidence has\nfavoured us with a paper, written in 1892, containing accounts, (which\ndo not pretend to medical accuracy), of a series of singular cures\nexperienced by himself and his immediate group.\nM. 73.\nCase I.\u2014The writer says of himself that he \"is occupied in active life,\nhas a strong aversion to modern ' Spiritualism,' possesses little medical know\nledge, and can only be considered an average observer deeply interested in\npsychical phenomena. He has never undertaken cures by faith or expectant\nattention save in his own case and that of his children.\" \"In 1888,\" he\ncontinues, \" I almost totally lost the sight of my left eye through a con\ntraction of the iris, and was told by the celebrated specialist, Mr. Critchett,\nthat it could only be restored by an operation. This I declined, and for\nfour years was almost blind in that eye. Last week I suddenly found that\nsight was restored to the extent which had been promised as the result of\nan operation.1\nCase II.\u2014\"In the year 1867, my daughter, then three years old, was\nsuffering from a painful illness, and in reply to my inquiries, the doctor twice\ntold me that he had given up every hope of saving her life. By a sudden\nimpulse I then fixed my mind in certain expectancy that she would recover,\nand caused her to be wrapped in wet sheets. She at once rallied, and soon was\nwell. . . . About 1871 my son, a lad of fifteen, was very ill with uncon\ntrollable vomiting. The eminent physician who attended him thought it\nnecessary to pay six professional visits the day before his recovery, and\n1 It would seem likely that this was due to an accidental and unexpected rupture\nof a previous adhesion of the iris.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 169\nseemed to have little hope of his life. In the evening the boy assured me that\nat five o'clock in the morning he would be well. In the night he talked inco\nherently of a favourite spring near by. At five in the morning the servant,\nby his orders, brought the water from that spring. The boy heard with joy\nthe clicking of the ice which had been put into it, waked up fully, and drank\nthe whole of two glasses, was well at once and permanently.\nCase III.\u2014\" One of my neighbours, after lying on her back fpr thirty\nyears, under the care of my own medical attendant, from unceasing nausea,\ncalled in a new physician. He gave her some homoeopathic powders and\nassured her that she would be sick no longer. She at once arose and resumed\nher active out-door occupations after this long interval.\nCase IV.\u2014\"About 1880, my daughter of fifteen had her foot run over\nby a heavy sledge.\n\"In the course of the treatment by a specialist he one day put her\npainful foot into a fresh splint and said she could not give up her crutches\nfor nine or ten months. Driving from the physician's house her mother\nrecollected to have heard of a woman physician who had cured many sprains,\nand at once took her daughter to her office. A few passes were made over\nit, and the girl danced around the floor perfectly well, nor was there any\nrelapse. To rest even slightly on that foot till that minute had been\nunbearable agony. It was not till long afterwards that we became aware\nthat the doctor was a 'Spiritualist,' performing cures by the mediumship of\nthe stereotyped 'Big Indian.' Of the doctor's personal goodness and\nsincerity, however, there could be no possible question. Soon afterwards,\na nephew, then about eleven years of age, now my guest, had strained his\nankle at play and continued to use it till at length he was laid up. The foot\nbecame greatly swelled and so sensitive that any stepping on the floor\naround him caused him increased agony of pain. Remembering the healing\nof his cousin, his parents sent for the same woman physician. The lad was\ngreatly afraid of her, had not the least hope of being cured, and yet after\nabout ten minutes of manipulation the foot was absolutely free from pain\nand he was walking round the room, the only remainder being a temporary\nslight sense of weakness. There was no relapse.\nCase V.\u2014\" My younger brother's wife had a disease of the circulation\ncalled the 'milk leg,' by which she was laid up, unable to stand or to move\nthe leg for about a year. One day her physician had made a fresh special\nexamination and stated that there was no hope of her walking for another\nyear. Under a strong impulse of despair succeeded by one of hope, she said,\n\u25a0 I will trust God and walk.' She rose up, dressed for the first time for\ntwelve months, and has in the six years since had no relapse. Her physician\nsaid that he knew no precedent for or clue to her recovery.\nCase VI.\u2014\"A well-known lady of very remarkable scientific attainments\ntells me that she had from childhood a malposition of the ribs which distorted\nher figure. A new physician who supposed himself, in addition to his large\npractice of medicine, to be scripturally authorised at times to act on the\ninjunctions of the Epistle of James, one day prayed for her and anointed\nher with oil. Soon after getting into her carriage, she heard a sound which\nshe supposed to be of the bones of her thorax moving, and soon found that\nher ribs had taken their normal position. The change was so marked that\n\f170 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nher dresses had to be modified to her greatly altered shape. I should hesitate\nto tell this but for my long and intimate acquaintance with the lady, and a\nclose friendship, extending over twenty years, with the physician.\nCase VII.\u2014\" My little daughter, at the age of seven, was suffering from\nchronic indigestion which caused her much pain. She had been under the\ntreatment of a physician for several months and he gave no hopes of an early\nrecovery. The faith-healing doctorabove referred to happened at the time to\nbe visiting at my house, and it was suggested that he should anoint the child\nand pray with her. The matter was explained to her and she said she did not\nknow whether she would like to have it done or not, and that she would think\nabout it. This she did for a day and then came in a great hurry, saying,\n' I'm ready now, and he must do it at once.' The usual ceremony was gone\nthrough and the child was at once cured. Afterwards, when I was proposing\nto make a present in gratitude for cure, the child said earnestly, ' Papa,\nyou ought to give me half of that, for if it had not been for my faith the\ndoctor could not have cured me at all.'\n\" I have myself known of most successful faith-healing among the Mor\nmons at Salt Lake, the result being freely acknowledged by the surrounding\n'Gentiles.' One man who had lost a leg had heard so much of this that he\ncrossed the ocean and went to Brigham Young to get it renewed. The old\nfox-like prophet, whom I knew, said, ' It would be easy for me to give you\nanother leg, but I must explain to you the consequences. If I give you\nanother leg you will have two legs till you die, which will be a great con\nvenience, but in the resurrection not only willthe leg you lost rise and be united\nto your body, but also the one I now give you ; thus you will be encumbered\nwith three legs for ever. It is for you to decide whether you will take the\ninconvenience of one leg now or three legs through eternity.' The man chose\nthe present inconvenience, but I hold that the prophet's ingenuity was in\nexcess of his power.1\nCase VIII.\u2014\"My family physician habitually cures ulcers on ignorant\npersons by laying his hand on thom and assuring the patient that they will be\nhealed. To the inquiry, ' Then why do not you do it for me t ' he candidly\nreplies, 'Oh, it don't work with educated people.'\n\" His son at twelve years of age broke both bones of his arm below the\nelbow, which were set by an uncle. Two days afterwards the boy came to\nhis father and asked him to take the arm out of the splints. The father\nexplained the certain results, but the lad said, ' You taught me to ask Jesus\nfor what I wanted and to be sure that I would get it, and I have asked Him.'\nThe child was so persistent that at length the father directed the uncle to\nremove the splints. The arm was lit for use ! The uncle nearly fainted\nwith astonishment. Told to me at the time, all the parties my trusted\nfriends, I am compelled to believe in the fact.\"\nIt must be added, however, that this case- was thoroughly investigated\n1 This reminds us of a story of Elian's (Hilt. An., ix. 33), where the Epidaurian\npriests of .Aesculapius have rashly cut off a woman's head, as a sanative operation, and\nare unable to restore it. Fortunately in that case ^Eiculapius himself visited his\ntemple, and set right the little mistake.\n2 The latter part of this account is as given by Dr. J. M. Buckley in his book\nFaith-healing, Christian Science, and Kindred Phenomena, p. 54.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 171\nby Dr. James Henry Lloyd, of the University of Pennsylvania, and in the-\nPhiladelphia Medical Record for March 27th, 1886, Dr. Lloyd published a\nletter from the very child, who has become a physician.\n''Dear Sir,\u2014The case you cite, when robbed ofall its sensational surround\nings, is as follows. The child is a spoiled youngster who would have his own\nway, and when he had a green-stick fracture of the forearm, after having had\nit bandaged for several days, concluded he would much prefer going without\na splint. To please the spoiled child the splint was removed and the arm\ncarefully adjusted in a sling. As a matter of course the bone soon united, as\nis customary in children, and being only partially broken, of course all the\nsooner. This is the miracle. Some nurse, or crank, or religious enthusiast,\nignorant of matters physiological or histological, evidently started the story,\nand unfortunately my name\u2014for I am the party\u2014is being circulated in cir\ncles of faith-curites, and is given the sort of notoriety I do not crave.\u2014Very\nrespectfully yours, Carl H. Rbbd.\"\n\"We have here, in fact,\" adds Dr. Buckley, \"the testimony of the\npatient himself that his cure was not at all extraordinary, and not depen\ndent upon faith, but on the readiness of young bone to heal.\"\nA second somewhat similar series of cures is sent to us by an\nAmerican lady of good standing, who has kindly made considerable,\nthough unsuccessful, efforts to get for us the sort of corroboration\ndesired. The change of physical condition in these cases seems\nindubitable, but the rationale of these changes may be interpreted in\nvery various ways.\nM. 74.\nCase IX.\u2014The first is a case in which the improvement in a malforma\ntion of the foot and leg is accredited to \" Christian Science.\" The story is\ntold by the patient himself, Mr. T. (name given), solicitor, of Los Angeles,\nCalifornia. \" I was born September, 1858. At my birth my right foot was\ndeformed, being turned upon one side, and in after life my right leg did not\ngrow equally with the left leg, so that at the time when Christian Science was\nintroduced to me (June, 1889) my right leg was about two inches shorter\nthan my left leg, so that I had to wear a thick cork sole upon my right shoe.\nWhile in Washington in January, 1891, I made the acquaintance of Miss\nVirginia Johnson, and also of Mr. and Mrs. Packard, all of whom were\npupils of Mrs. Eddy. When about to leave Washington and return West,\nMiss Johnson encouraged me to go to Concord and call upon Mrs. Eddy.\nI did not feel it would look well for me to do so wearing the unsightly shoe\nwhich seemed to be necessary. On the Tuesday before my departure from\nWashington my measure was taken by Simpson the tailor (of 9th and G\nstreets, N.Y.) for a pair of trousers, which were ready for me on Thursday\nfollowing. The right trousers leg was too short and it was found necessary to\nlet down the hem, so I did not got the trousers until Friday, when the hem\nhad been let down and the legs appeared to bo all right. I wore the trousers\nSaturday. The next morning, Sunday, January 25th, while lying in bed\nand wondering how I could manage to call upon Mrs. Eddy and make a\npresentable appearance, I chanced to stretch out my legs and was surprised\nto find that they were nearly the same length. I dressed, borrowed a cast\n\f172 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\noff shoe and wore it upon my right foot that day. The next morning I found\nthe right leg of my trousers again too short, and as soon as the stores were open\nI bought a new pair of shoes and a pair of ready-made trousers, the same being\nthe first pair of trousers with the legs the same length I had worn since a boy.\nThese trousers fit me without any alterations, but I had to have a new leg put\nin the other trousers before I could wear them. I have worn straight shoes of\nthe ordinary ready-made kind ever since, while before I required for my\nright foot a special shoe which cost me lOdol. This demonstration occurred\nwithout any treatment, and I have never received treatment for my deformity\nexcept a short time by a so-called Christian Scientist . . . but I\ndiscovered that the so-called treatment which was being given was of no\nbenefit, but rather otherwise, and I discontinued it. Miss Johnson informed\nme that she simply put it out of her thought, and declared harmony the first\ntime she met me. I consider that to have been the most effective treatment\nthat could have been given. My foot does not yet appear to be straight,\nand I have never made any effort to have it straightened. I had studied\nChristian Science for a year and a-half before the above demonstration\ncame.\"\nIn evidence of the accuracy of his account of the above demonstration,\nMr. T. sends the corroborative testimony of Lieutenant F. H. Crosby, dated\nNovember 15th, 1892. \" I certify that I am personally acquainted with Mr.\nJ. R. T., of Los Angeles, Cal. ; that I saw him very frequently about\nthe time his leg was lengthened ; that I walked with him considerable\ndistances ; that he spent Friday evening at my house wearing at that time\nthe thick cork sole\u2014at least l^in. thick; that he expressed then and at other\ntimes a firm conviction that his deformity would be at some time overcome\nthrough the truths of Christian Science ; that he spent the following Monday\nevening at my house wearing an ordinary pair of shoes of equal thickness of\nsole ; that I walked at least half a mile with him that evening ; that I looked\nfor signs in his walking that would indicate inequalities in the length of his\nlegs ; that he walked erect and with no sign of pain or inconvenience ; and\nthat, although I have no means of proving it, I believe\u2014I am as sure as I\ncan be of another man's acts\u2014that he used no other means to bring about\nthe lengthening of his leg than the methods of Christian Science.\u2014F. H.\nCrosby, Lieut., U. S. Navy.\"\nWe asked for some details of this rapid change and lengthening of the\nlimb. Was there any full description of the limb, its bones, joints and\nmuscles, before the lengthening ? was there any elongation of the long bones of\nthe limb, the femur, tibia, or fibula, such as could be shown by the comparison\nof measurements made between different parts in the same bone before and\nafter the lengthening ? was there any curvature which by being straightened\ncould have made the bone longer 1 was there any evidence of chronic muscular\nspasm before the lengthening, of tension or adhesion of the tendons, or\nmuscles, or fasciae, or slight chronic displacement of the bones at the joints,\nthe hip, the knee, or the ankle ? for a change in these conditions might con\nstitute or contribute to the lengthening. To these inquiries Mr. T. wrote\na reply to our informant saying that the shortness of his right leg \" was by\nreason that it did not grow equally with the left leg, so that it was about two\ninches shorter than my left log.\" \"I will further state,\" he continues, \"that\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 173\nthe above statement as to the cause for my short leg included all the causes\nwhich I then or now believe could be assigned by the medical profession.\nThe statement appears to me to exclude the hypotheses that the lengthening\noccurred by reason of relaxation of 'chronic muscular spasm, of tension\nor adhesion of the tendons, muscles or fasciae, or slight chronic displace\nment of the bones at hip, knee, or ankle.' In order that the statement\nmay be understood by the dullest one who may chance to read this, I will\nsay that none of the above quoted conditions were present in my case.\nI cannot say whether there was a growth of the bones or not, and I know\nof no way in which such a question could be determined. To-day the bones\nappear to be the same length as those of the other leg ; but as to having an\n* M.D.' to perform any measurements to satisfy his unbelief in the power of\nmind to shape its own conditions of expression, I must respectfully decline.\nThe proofs of Divine Science can never be discerned through material means\nand measures. ' A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign,\nand no sign shall be given except the sign of the prophet Jonas. For as Jonas\nwas three days and nights in the whale's belly, so shall the Son of\nMan be three days and nights in the heart of the earth.' The only satisfac\ntory sign the human thought can get is to do as Jonah did, i.e., come out of\nhis belief of life, substance and intelligence in matter. If Mr. Myers and\nthose with whom he is associated will open their minds to the truth that\nthere is no life, substance or intelligence in matter, that the Son of Man is\nnot in the heart of the earth ; that is, to-day, if they will come out of their\nmaterial beliefs, they will learn more in one day than they can otherwise\nlearn in an age. They with their belief of mind within a skull, of them\nselves within a material body, fulfil the type of Jonah within the body of the\nwhale. When they appeal to Omnipotent Mind to release them and deliver\nthem from this false environment, they, like their prototype, will find them\nselves placed on firm ground. . . . If I were to destroy every scrap of\nevidence that I had ever had the deformity I have spoken of, it would\nrelieve me of much that is not desirable. I knew when the Society was\ndiscussing it, and was almost unable to put on my shoe by reason of the\nswelling induced in that member when it was being mentally discussed in\nLondon. I am fearless, though, and know that such seeming power for evil\nis a myth.\"\nMr. T.'s perceptions are indeed abnormally acute if he painfully\nfelt our Society \" mentally discussing \" his case at a time when\nthat discussion was confined to the forum conscientice of a single\nmember. Mr. T. compares our difficulties to those of Jonah when\nswallowed by the whale ; but at this moment we feel more disposed to\nsympathise with the difficulties of the whale when swallowing Jonah.\nIn the other cases received from the lady above mentioned there is\nno marked repugnance or contempt for medical testimony, but this is,\nnevertheless, conspicuously absent, and she holds out little hope of\nbeing able to get it. A fair instance of the kind of case offered is the\nfollowing :\u2014\n\f174 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nM. 75.\nCase X. \u2014\" Eliza H. slipped in the dark and was thrown against the stone\nwall at the foot of the stairs. By this accident, six ribs were dislocated, the\nbones of my right wrist were all displaced, and my hand pronounced useless\nhenceforth ; my skull was crushed, my stomach was injured, and all my other\ninternal organs displaced ; my spine, too, was seriously affected. I was attended\nby the most prominent physicians. After four years of intense suffering, chills\nand fever set in for nine months. On this account it was thought necessary\nto send me out West. I went to the country to gain strength and returned\nto the city in the autumn, expecting to be operated upon in the hospital where\nI was a patient, but Professor Fellowes and Dr. Ludlam stated in lectures\nto their classes that it would be impossible, as my body was a complete\nwreck. Also, as all the inward organs were displaced, it was thought I could\nnot rally from the effects of chloroform. Seven years of intense suffering\nwere passed in a pilgrimage from hospital to hospital. I was entirely help\nless and pronounced incurable, when a friend opened my eyes to the truth.\nFrom that hour I abandoned all medicine and trusted God. I began to\nmend, slowly but surely, and as a result of mental treatment only, followed\nby earnest study, I am now in vigorous health, able to accomplish any work,\nsuch as running a sewing machine for hours at a time, walking great dis\ntances, going up and down stairs with perfect ease and pleasure, &c., and\nfind my happiness in imparting to others what I have received and am con\ntinually receiving.\"\nAll that we can be sure of from this report as it stands is that there\nwas relief from pain. But for any real estimate of the powers of\n\" mind-cure \" it is essential that we should learn the details of the dis\nplacement \"of all the inward organs \" and their re-adjustment ;\u2014points\ncertainly sufficiently difficult to tax to the utmost the skill of the most\nexpert observers. Why, after all these years of hospitals, is there not\na single word from any physician 1 Have \" Professor Fellowes and Dr.\nLudlam \" any remark to make 1 We cannot but remember the case of\nMaria Jolly, advertised in every newspaper in the days of our youth,\nwhere \" thirty years of indescribable agony \" were cured at once by the\nuse of \" Revalenta Arabica,\" which turned out to be the flour of lentils.\nWhen we turn from faith-healing in America to faith-healing in\nEngland we find an equal lack of satisfactory evidence. \" We could\ncontinue,\" says Dr. Schofield (Faith-healing, p. 50), \" to give pages of\nmost interesting unproved or unprovable cases, but enough has been\nnarrated to show that, in England at any rate, we have found it\nimpossible directly to verify a single organic case.\" Dr. Schofield has\ntaken much trouble in the matter ; and additional weight is given to\nhis negative conclusion by the fact that he writes from a decidedly\nChristian standpoint, and that his book is published by the Religious\nTract Society. Assuredly rational religion has little to gain from such\ndoctrines as Dr. Schofield quotes : \" ' I hold,' says one writer, ' that all\nwho come to God for healing, and accept it by faith in His appointed\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 175\nway, are Jiealed,\u2014no matter what may be the evidence of their senses\nto the contrary.' ... A friend of mine, a Christian doctor, found\na woman, from whom he had to remove a cancer, actually protesting\nat the time that she was [already] healed. ... 'I know,' says\none, ' many people who have been cured for three or four years, but\nwho still wait its manifestation ! ' \"\nThe fact that in our discussion of mind-healing we are reduced to\nquoting cases like those given above indicates, of course, that no real\nevidence for the alleged cures has fallen under our ken. We believe,\nhowever, from private statements that at any rate marked alleviations\nof pain and discomfort have often followed upon self-suggestion of this\nconcentrated kind ; and we here appeal to all persons seriously interested\nin the matter to send us evidence somewhat more nearly approaching\nthe type which we have above laid down. We on our part are prepared\nto believe, not indeed all that mind-healers have asserted, but a good\ndeal more than they have as yet made any attempt to prove. We\nmake this appeal with considerable hope, in spite of the probability that\nsome prominent persons in the Faith-healing camp will be little dis\nposed to listen to us. The founder of the \" University of the Science\nof Spirit \" \u2014who argues that ordinary science is grossly at fault because,\nwhile asserting that mercury cures, it refuses the obvious deduction,\n\" Then the more mercury you take the better,\"\u2014will be unaffected by\nany views so old-fashioned as those which we can offer. The keepers of\n\" faith-houses,\" whose motto is \" The Lord hath need of the money,\"\nwill discover that the Lord hath need of the money still. The Brother\nwho announces in the \" Crown of Glory \" that he \" has given up rum,\nwine, tobacco, and everything but Jesus,\" will be content to call our at\ntention to his approaching voyage to preach salvation (by Faith-healing)\non the West Coast of Africa, whither he will set forth \" as soon as the\nXord has sent the balance of the fare.\" 1\nThe existence of a crew of this kind is an inevitable, although, it\nmay be hoped, a transitory result of any widespread popular attempt at\ncure by suggestion and self-suggestion. Inasmuch as it seems to matter\nlittle from whom the suggestion comes, so long as that suggestion is\nsufficiently vigorous to get itself accepted, the charlatan has some\nexcuse for thinking that this is just the field for charlatans, and that\npatients may as well believe in him as in Bernheim or Delboeuf. As time\ngoes on it may perhaps be found that the lectures of Mind-healers (300\ndollars for a three weeks' course) and the prayers of Faith-healers (tariff\nnot stated) are alike needless, and that the sufferer himself, by the mere\nstrong exercise of his own volition, can at least control or alleviate\nmany nervous ills.\nTwo warnings only we feel bound to give. May not the solemn\n1 See Buckley's Faith-healing, p. 66, &c.\n\f176 Br. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ninvocations of the Faith-healer\u2014his assurances in the most sacred\nnames, and with the most awful adjurations, that the disease will dis\nappear at a given moment, be altogether omitted ? These assumptions\nof direct personal approach to the Deity are merely blasphemous ; and\nwhen the solemn covenant fails the ignorant sufferer is apt to sink into\nthe same bitter unbelief which makes the savage beat his idol when he\nis cheated of the promised rain. And it is our duty also to warn all\npatients most seriously, when trying any \"suggestive\" or \"psycho-\ntherapeutical \" treatment, not to neglect any means whatever of\nordinary and orthodox cure.\nAlitur vitium, vivitque tegendo,\nDum medicas adhibere manus ad volnera pastor\nAbnegat, aut meliora deos sedet omina poscens. 1\nWe must now proceed to the second part of our task,\u2014the exami\nnation of the so-called Miracles of Lourdes. And here we pass at once\nfrom the atmosphere of the future into the atmosphere of the past ;\nfrom crude attempts to popularise modern scientific conceptions to a\nmethod of psycho-therapeutic, which, however essentially the same at*\nfond as the modern developments, relies for its efficacy upon beliefs\nand practices which have come down to us through many transforma\ntions from a remote past. Deferring for the time, however, any notice\nof the parallels thus suggested, let us begin by examining the three\nessential factors of the Lourdes story. In a few words, that story is as\nfollows. The Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette, and in direct\nconsequence of that apparition miraculous cures are performed in and\nnear the same grotto where the divine figure was seen.\nPlainly we have three points to look into. (1.) 'What is the\nevidence that the apparition was really seen, or, if seen, was more than\na purely subjective hallucination? (2.) What is the evidence which\nconnects the apparition with the cures? (3.) What evidence is there\nof cures so far surpassing the known effects of suggestion and self-\nsuggestion as to demand a special or a miraculous explanation ? On\neach of these points there is a good deal to say.\n(1.) The apparition. \" On a great tablet of marble,\" says Dr.\nBoissarie, \"magnificently framed, fastened into the rock near the\ngrotto,\" the following inscription is to be read :\u2014\n1 Virgil, Oeorg. III., 454. These words\u2014too often justified in faith-healing\npractice\u2014may be rendered as follows :\u2014\nThus grows and grows the hurt which none can heal,\nWhile the false leech denies the saving steel ;\nHe with hands clasped invokes a favouring day ;\nAnd dies the victim, and the gods delay.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 177\nDates of the Eighteen apparitions\nand words of the Blessed Virgin\nin the year of grace 1858.\nIn the hollow of the rock where her statue is now seen\nthe Blessed Virgin appeared to Bernadette Soubirous\nEighteen times.\nThe 11th and the 14th of February ;\nEach day, with two exceptions, from February 18th till March 4th,\nMarch 25th, April 7th, July 16th.\nThe Blessed Virgin said to the child on February 18th,\n\" Will you do me the favour (me faire la grace) of coming here daily\nfor a fortnight ?\nI do not promise to make you happy\nIn this world, but in the next ;\nI want many people to come (qu'il vienne du monde).\"\nThe Virgin said to her during the fortnight :\n\" You will pray for sinners ; you will kiss the earth for sinners.\nPenitence ! penitence ! penitence !\nGo and tell the priests to cause a chapel to be built ;\nI want people to come thither in procession.\nGo and drink of the fountain and wash yourself in it.\nGo and eat of that grass which is there (de cette herbe qui est la). \"\nOn March 25th the Virgin said :\n\" I am the Immaculate Conception.\"\nThis, then, is the official account of the vision. We will simplify\nour discussion by waiving all question as to its good faith or accuracy,\nand accepting it as an exact account of what Bernadette believed that\nshe heard and saw. How, then, should we classify such a narrative, if\nsent to us in the ordinary course of our collection of evidence ?\nUndoubtedly we should regard it as a purely subjective experience.\nIt does not answer any of the tests which we habitually impose on a\nhallucination which claims to be veridical. The figure was seen by one\nperson only. The apparition did not coincide with any objective\nevent. It did not even\u2014though to this point we must presently\nreturn\u2014contain any prediction whose fulfilment could be a retrospec\ntive proof of the reality of the message. And\u2014worst of all from an\nevidential point of view,\u2014the figure seen was one which, by the\nadmission, we believe, of the Catholic clergy themselves, has been\noften reported as seen, mainly by young girls, under circumstances\nwhere no objective value whatever could be attributed to the\napparition.\nIt so happens that on this last and very important point we can\nadduce a significant series of facts. In Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII.,\np. 100, may be found a description, written for the S.P.R., by\nM. Marillier from observation on the spot, of a series of apparitions\nof the Virgin near Pontinet in the Dordogne. There the Virgin was\n8\n\f178 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nseen many times by many persons, generally through a special hole in\na wall, but sometimes on the open heath. We entirely concurred,\nhowever, with M. Marillier in ranking all these visions as purely\nsubjective. We considered that the expectation and excitement\ncaused by Marie Magontier's account of her first vision\u2014itself probably\na real, but entirely subjective experience,\u2014might well have predisposed\nher neighbours to similar hallucinations. The case was like that of\na haunted room, where one person has seen a figure, and then others,\ninformed of this apparition, have seen, or fancied that they saw,\nsomething like that figure again. And the Bishop of Perigueux must\nobviously have shared this view, for he discouraged the visions at\nPontinet and nothing has come of them.\nIt is not easy to explain why this long series of mutually\ncorroborative visions should be thus tacitly dropped, while the similar\nvisions of a single uncorroborated child should receive so much\nattention. Dr. Boissarie makes two points based on the apparition\nitself ; namely, the beauty of the figure and the loftiness of the\nmessage. \"We shall be able,\" he says, p. 31, \"to arrive at a scientific\ndemonstration of the supernatural by placing side by side, on the one\nhand, the faculties of this ignorant child ; on the other hand, the\nvision of this ideal Virgin, a creation of an unknown type, which the\ngenius of the greatest artists had never conceived, and has had\ndifficulty in reproducing. The name of this Virgin, the words which\nshe uttered,\u2014all is out of proportion to the percipient's intelligence.\nRemembering the formal principle, admitted by all authorities, 'A\nhallucination is never more than a reminiscence of a sensation already\nperceived,' it is evident that the intelligence and the memory of\nBernadette could never have received the image or heard the echo of\nwhat she saw and heard at the grotto.\"\nHow, it may be asked, do we know of the extraordinary beauty of\nthe form which Bernadette perceived? We know this, it appears, (p.\"0)\nfrom the statement of the sculptor Fabisch, who made a statue of the\nVirgin which Bernadette regarded as a faithful copy of what she had\nseen. Of the pose and expression which he had thus faithfully\nreproduced, Fabisch informs us that \" he has seen nothing to equal\nthem in suavity and rapture in the chefs (Foeuvre of the greatest\nmasters,\u2014of Perugino or Raphael.\" It was fortunate that the task\nwas committed to an artist so fully equal to the occasion ; and the less\nfavourable impression made upon one of ourselves by the sight of the\nstatue in the grotto should not, perhaps, be placed in opposition to this\n\u2022decisive judgment of the sculptor himself.\nAs regards the loftiness of the message we have less definite\nguidance. Dr. Boissarie does not tell us whether it is the divine\ncommand to kiss the earth for sinners, or the divine command to eat\n\fMind-Care, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lowrdes. 179\ngrass, which is manifestly beyond the intelligence of a simple child.\nHe dwells only upon the phrase \" I am the Immaculate Conception \" ;\nand we may indeed admit that this particular mode of reproducing the\nprobably often-heard statement that the Virgin was conceived without\nsin does indicate a mind which is either supra or infra grammaticain\nWe have quoted this passage at length mainly as indicating what it\nis that Dr. Boissarie is willing to call a demonstration scienlifique du\nmrnaturel. And since this physician is sometimes referred to as\nthough his judgments carried much weight, we may mention here that\nthe most definite knowledge which we have been able to gain about\nhim is that he \"has been mixed up for several years (mele depuis\nplusieurs annees, p. 147) with the religious and scientific movements of\nhis time.\" This fact about himself,\u2014the only one which he vouchsafes\nus,\u2014is also that which the study of his volume would have enabled us\nto divine with the most confident assurance.\nIf, however, we must admit that the story of the apparition is not\none which could have found a place as evidential in these Proceedings,\nthe same thing cannot be said of another incident, much less noticed,\nbut in itself far more surprising, in the recorded life of Bernadette.\nThis incident was observed and described by Dr Dozous,\u2014the\nphysician to whose advocacy the credence bestowed on Bernadette, and\nthe consequent fame of Lourdes, seem to have been in the first instance\nmainly due. Dr. Boissarie quotes from Dr. Dozous' account, but\nwithout giving any reference, nor even the name of the work where\nthe citation occurs. We repeat the story, therefore, as Dr. Boissarie\ngives it (p. 49).\n\" The girl, upon her knees, held in one hand a lighted taper, which\nrested upon the ground. During her ecstasy she put her hands\ntogether, and her fingers were loosely crossed above the flame, which\nthey enveloped in the cavity between the two hands (dans l'espece de\nvoute qui les separait). The taper burnt ; the flame showed its point\nbetween the fingers and was blown about at the time by a rather strong\ncurrent of air. But the flame did not seem to produce any alteration\nin the skin which it touched. \"\n\" Astonished,\" says Dr. Dozous, \" at this strange fact, I did not\nallow anyone to put a stop to it, and taking out my watch I could\nobserve it perfectly for a quarter of an hour. Her prayer ended,\nBernadette rose, and prepared to leave the grotto. I kept her back for\na moment and asked her to show me her hand, which I examined with\nthe greatest care. I could not find the slightest trace of a burn any\nwhere. I then tried to place the flame of the taper beneath her hand\nwithout her observing it ; but she drew her hand quickly back, exclaim\ning ' You burn me ! '\n\" This fact,\" continues Dr. Boissarie, \" has often been imperfectly\nn 2\n\f180 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ninterpreted. It includes two elements quite distinct from each other,\nthe insensibility, and the absence of actual burning. Bernadette in\nher ecstasy might have lost the sensation of pain ; . . . but actual\ncombustion, actual destruction of tissues by heat takes place under all\ncircumstances and inevitably, irrespective of pain or absence of pain.\"\nThis is quite true ; nor would any kind of preservative application have\nsufficed to prevent the fingers from being charred under the conditions\ndescribed.\nWe have here, then, a most important statement, vouched for by\nDr. Dozous, one of the most essential witnesses in all this case, and\n(according to him) confirmed by all the persons present, who \" saw the\nflame mount along the interlaced fingers, and but for Dozous' inter\nvention would have taken the taper from the child's hands.\"\nIt seems to us that a physician's observation so easy, so prolonged,\nand by the observer's account so corroborated both by his own immediate\nexperiment and by the agreement of all bystanders, cannot be set\ndown to mere mal-observation. It must either be true or else wilfully\nfalse. If wilfully false it brings down with it, one may say, the whole\nlegend of Bernadette, of which this is by far the most remarkable and\napparently the best-attested incident. If on the other hand, Dr.\nDozous' story be true, what are we to hold that it proves? What\nparallel cases have we with which to compare it 1 The obvious answer\nis that we have a series of similar occurrences reported in the case of\nD. D. Home. Home's phenomena of resistance to fire are in fact both\nin themselves more striking and better attested, since we have such\nnames as those of Mr. Crookes, Lord Crawford, Lord Dunraven, with\nother observers of known position and probity, to set against the little-\nknown Dr. Dozous, and the still less known peasants who witnessed\nthe \" miracle of the taper\" at Lourdes.\nThis parallel, however, striking as it is, does not carry us much\nfurther towards the solution of the Lourdes problem. For in the\nfirst place D. D. Home's phenomena, in spite of their attestation, have\nnot gained general scientific acceptance ; and in the second place, those\nwho do believe in them are undecided as to the power\u2014whether\nresident in Home himself or in unknown spirits\u2014to which these\nstriking effects are to be attributed. The \" miracle of the taper,\"\ntherefore, if truly reported, may show that Bernadette was a \" medium,\"\nbut cannot fairly be used to prove the action of the Virgin Mary. Still\nless safe would it be to appeal to the ecstasies themselves as proving the\ndivine character of their inspiring cause. Here again Mr. Daniel\nHome also had Ms ecstasies,\u2014controlled by \" guides,\" who were quite\nas sensitive to human incredulity as better-authorised saints might have\nbeen. \" Little faith ! \" they would exclaim,\u2014\" little faith ! Will you\nnot trust in Dan ? \"\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 181\nAnd this brings us to the second point marked out for our\ndiscussion. What connection is to be discerned between the visions of\nBernadette and the cures subsequently occurring at Lourdes ?\nIn the first place it may be observed that the original words of the\nmessage make no mention whatever of physical healing. On the\ncontrary, the Virgin expressly states that the happiness which she\npromises is to be enjoyed in the next world and not in this. What she\napparently aims at in this world is worship for herself : \"I want people\nto come,\" \" I want people to come in procession.\" There was also,\nindeed, a direction to wash in the stream, and to drink of it. Whether\nthis stream meant the visible Gave, or its visible tributary,\u2014both\nwithin a few yards of the spot\u2014or the spring just below the surface\nwhich Bernadette is said to have scraped clear with her hands 1\u2014it\nseems to have referred to a stream sufficiently established to have\nalready grass growing on its banks, which Bernadette (presumably with\nother believers) was commanded to eat. Whether Bernadette, or any\none else, did eat it is not quite clear. And why they were to eat it, why\nthey were to wash in the stream, is still more mysterious. It may\nhave been for the same reason that they were to kiss the ground, as an\nact of abasement or penitence for sin. But we need hardly perhaps\nfurther analyse the somewhat incoherent message which has since been\nmade to mean so much more than its actual words will carry.\nA quarryman of the name of Bourriette, however, (Boissarie, p. 99)\nconceived the idea that the water of the spring in the grotto might\nwith advantage be applied to his eyes, injured by an explosion. The\nalleged good effects of the water, in this and other cases among the\nneighbouring peasantry, started the long series of cures with which we\nshall presently have to deal.\nThe connection between these cures and the Virgin Mary lies in\nalmost all cases in the subjective conviction of the sufferer that he will\nbe cured at Lourdes and that the Virgin's aid will do it. Sometimes,\nno doubt, his conviction may be reinforced by a dream, as when\nMustapha, a Mussulman in Constantinople, dreamt that a lady in\nwhite told him that she was the Virgin adored by the Georgian\nFathers in that city ; in whose chapel, in fact, water from Lourdes is\ndistributed gratis. Mustapha's right eye, which he had completement\nperdu \u2014 \" lost altogether,\" \u2014 was radicalement gueri\u2014\" completely\ncured \" (we are told), when he awoke, and Dr. Boissarie concludes\n(p. 237) that \" Our Lady of Lourdes seems to have commenced the\nreligious reformation of the East.\" Of such dreams and like phenomena\nwe shall have something to say further on.\n1 It would be interesting to compare this alleged miraculous discovery of a spring\nwith the exploits of \"dowsers \"or \"water-finders\"; but we have not seen any\naccount definite enough to serve as a basis for discussion.\n\f182 . Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nFor the present our point is that we have not in analogous cases\nconsidered that subjective evidence of this kind, even when backed up\nby definite assertions of identity and continuous action on the part of\nsome unseen agent, did really constitute a proof that that agent was\nat work. We have regarded it as still possible, and even probable,\nthat the effects were produced by self-suggestion, and that the alleged\nSpirit or Guardian was no more than a form in which the self-suggeslion\nclothed itself.\nA remarkable case, recently received, may here be quoted to\nillustrate both the degree of insistent assertion and apparently of\nactive supernormal influence which may sometimes point to the inter\nvention of some given spiritual agency,\u2014and at the same time the\ndegree of doubt and reserve with which it seems needful to meet\nassertion and evidence of that particular kind.\nThe writer of the following narrative is a physician occupying an\nimportant scientific post on the Continent of Europe. He is known to\nus by correspondence and through a common friend,\u2014himself a savant of\nEuropean reputation,\u2014who has talked the case over with Dr. X. and\nhis wife, and has read the statement which we now translate and\nabbreviate. We are bound to conceal Dr. X.'s identity, and even his\ncountry ; nor is this unreasonable, since the bizarrerie of the incidents\nto be recorded would be felt as greatly out of place in his actual\nscientific surroundings. The Dr. Z. who here appears in the somewhat\ndubious character of a mesmerising spirit, was also, as it happens, a,\nsavant of European repute, and a personal friend of Dr. X.'s.\nM. 76.\nAccount of Phenomena Observed with Mme. X.\nCase XI.\u2014Mme. X. is a lady healthy in body and mind, well-balanced, of\nsound judgment, strong common-sense, and a calm and firm character ; she is\ncharitable without excess ; is not susceptible to flattery, nor given to enthu\nsiasm ; she detests falsehood and duplicity and abhors injustice. She has never\nhad any one of those serious maladies, such as meningitis, typhoid fever, &c.,\nwjiich are apt to leave traces on the nervous system. Nor has she suffered\nfrom any nervous complaint. She is the very opposite of what would be\ntermed a nervous or hysterical subject. She is sensibly affected by accounts\nof human woes, especially among children ; but such sensibility by no means\nexplains the accesses of violent laughter which I have remarked in her since\nthe commencement of the series of events to be now related. These accesses,\nwhich have nothing in common with the hysterical crises which they super\nficially resemble, are always caused by some extraordmary communication\nemanating from an occult intelligence.\nIn September, 1890, while we were staying in the country, Mme. X.\nsprained her right foot on a very dark night. A fortnight after our return\nto M the foot was almost well ; but shortly afterwards I fell ill, and Mme.\nX. underwent much fatigue in nursing me. The injured foot then became\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 183\ninflamed and painful ; and the left foot also became painful. For all that\nwinter Mme. X. was obliged to lie up, the foot being kept from all movement\nby plaster or silicate dressings. This treatment was ultimately abandoned ;\nthe foot was simply bound up and crutches used. There was inflammation\nof the tissues of several of the joints of the right foot, and we were seriously\nalarmed.\nAt this point certain friends talked to Mme. X. about the alleged facts of\nSpiritism, of which until that date she had had a very vague notion. They\npraised the beneficent intervention of spirits in disease ; but had much\ndifficulty in inducing her to admit the mere possibility of facts of this nature.\nI can affirm, therefore, that it was only with great difficulty that these friends\nsucceeded in vanquishing Mme. X.'s scepticism \u2014 which was moreover\nsupported by my own objections to Spiritism\u2014and at last persuaded her to\nsubmit herself to the action of the invisibles. The spirit-guide of a group of\nwhich one of our friends was a member advised the intervention of the\n(spirit)-doctor Z. A day was arranged when Dr. Z. was to visit Mme. X.,\nand she was informed of the date. Owing to other preoccupations we com\npletely forgot this rendezvous. On the day named\u2014it was in April, 1891\u2014\nDr. Z. announced himself by raps in the table. Only then did we recollect\nthe rendezvous agreed upon. I asked Dr. Z. his opinion on the nature of\nthe injury to Mme. X.'s foot. By tilts of the table, through Mme. X.'s\nmediumship, he gave the word \"tuberculosis.\" He meant that there was\ntuberculosis of the joints, and of this there had been some indications. Had\nMme. X. been predisposed to tubercle I doubt not that this would have\nsupervened. Personally, I much feared this complication, and Dr. Z.'s\nanswer (as I at once thought) might well be the mere reflection of my fears.\nIt left me no more anxious than before. We now know that there was in\nfact no tuberculosis. In any case, Dr. Z. ordered a merely soothing remedy,\na sulphur ointment. Some days later, at our request, Dr. Z. reappeared and\npromised to undertake the cure of Mme. X.'s feet ; warning us, however,\nthat there would never be a \"restitutio ad integrum,\" but that the patient\nwould be unequal to long walks, and would suffer more or less from her feet\nin damp weather\u2014which has proved to be the case.\nI come now to the phenomena, mainly subjective, which Mme. X.'s case\nbegan to present. On August 17th, 1891, the patient felt for the first time\na unique sensation, accompanied by formication and sense of weight in the\nlower limbs, especially in the feet. This sensation gradually spread over the\nrest of the body, and when it reached the arms, the hands and forearms\nbegan to rotate. These phenomena recurred after dinner every evening,\nas soon as the patient was quiet in her armchair. At this point the\nX. family went into the country to R , and at that place the manifes\ntations took place twice daily for some 15 or 20 minutes. Usually the\npatient placed her two hands on a table. The feeling of \"magnetisation\"\nthen began in the feet, which began to rotate, and the upper parts of the\nbody gradually shared in the same movement. At a certain point, the hands\nautomatically detached themselves from the table by small, gradual shocks,\nand at the same time the arms assumed a tetanic rigidity somewhat resembling\ncatalepsy. On one occasion when these sensations had been strongly marked,\nand the patient had felt the whole of the upper part of her body stiffened.\n\f184 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nshe went to bed and saw in the dark an intense light which lasted for several\nminutes and then gradually disappeared.\nThree weeks after the family's return to M the phenomena changed\nin character, and gained in interest. The patient had begun to be able to walk\nwithout much difficulty ; but all forced and voluntary movement of the fix>t\nwas still painful, although when the movement was initiated by the occult\nagency no pain whatever was felt. One evening, after the usual seance, the\npatient felt her head move against her will. An intelligent intercourse was\nthus set up between the patient and the unseen agent or agents. The head\nnodded once for \"Yes,\" twice for \"No,\" three times for a strong affirm\nation. These movements were sometimes sudden and violent enough to cause\nsomething like pain. Words and phrases could, of course, be spelt out in this\nway. This form of correspondence has never wholly ceased ; although the\nintensity of the phenomenon has now much diminished. The occult agent\nnow impresses one or other of Mme. X.'s hands with movements which\ntrace in the air the form of letters of the alphabet ;\u2014a plan which works\nwell and quickly.\nMme. X. is also a writing medium ; and this power first showed itself in\na strange way during the stay in the country of which I have already spoken.\nShe was writing a letter one day, with no thought of these unseen agencies,\nwhen suddenly she felt her hand checked. Warned by a special^sensation,\nshe still held the pen. Her hand placed itself on a sheet of paper and began\nrapidly to write alarming predictions. The writings retained this tone only\nfor a few hours ; and soon the communications became trivial in character,\nand, save in some exceptional instances, have since remained so.\nAnother phenomenon followed shortly afterwards. One day Mme. X.\nfelt herself lifted with force from her armchair and compelled to stand up\nright. Her feet and her whole body then executed a systematic calisthenic\nexercise, in which all the movements were regulated and made rhythmic with\nfinished art. This was renewed on following days, and towards the end of\neach performance,\u2014sometimes of an hour's or two hours' duration\u2014the\nmovements acquired extreme energy. Mme. X. has never had the smallest\nnotion of chamber-gymnastics, Swedish or otherwise, and these movements\nwould have been very painful and fatiguing had she attempted them of her\nown will. Yet at the end of each performance she was neither fatigued nor\nout of breath. All was going well, and Dr. Z. had announced that henceforth\nhis attentions would not be needed, when next day a singular accident threw\neverything back. Mme. X. had mounted with great precaution upon a low\nchair with four legs and a large base of support to take an object from a\nwardrobe. Just as she was about to descend, the chair was violently snatched\nfrom under her feet and pushed to a distance. Mme. X. fell on the diseased\nfoot, and the cure had to begin again. [In a subsequent letter Dr. X.\nexplains that by Mme. X. 's account this movement was distinctly due to an\ninvisible force ; no natural slipping of the chair.]\nMme. X. was accustomed to bandage her own foot every morning. One\nday she was astonished to feel her hands seized and guided by an occult\nforce. From that day onwards the bandaging was done according to all the\nrules of the art, and with a perfection which would have done credit to the\nmost skilful surgeon of either hemisphere. Although very adroit with her\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 185\nhands, Mme. X. had never had occasion to practise nursing or to study\nminor surgery, yet the bandages thus automatically applied were irreproach\nable, and were admired by everyone. When Mme. X. wished to renew the\nbandages, she placed the strips all rolled up upon a table within reach of her\nhand, and her hand then automatically took the bandage which best suited\nthe occult operation.\nMme. X. is accustomed to arrange her own hair. One morning she said\nlaughingly, \"I wish that a Court hairdresser would do my hair for me;\niny arms are tired.\" At once she felt her hands acting automatically, and\nwith no fatigue for her arms, which seemed to be held up ; and the result\nwas a complicated coiffure, which in no way resembled her usual simple\nmode of arrangement.\nThe oddest of all these automatic phenomena consisted in extremely\ngraceful gestures which Mme. X. was caused to execute with her arms,\u2014\ngestures as though of evocation or adoration of some imaginary divinity, or\ngestures of benediction. When the occult agent placed her before the\nportrait of her son whom she lost five years ago the scene became\nreally affecting,\u2014and moved Mme. X. herself to tears. The few persons\nwho witnessed this spectacle are agreed that it was worthy of the powers of\nthe greatest actress. Of such a gift Mme. X. has nothing ; her nature is\nsimple and frank, but cold rather than demonstrative.\nAt the Paris Exhibition of 1889 Mme. X. once saw the \"Javanese\n,dance,\" consisting of rhythmic motions of the body with contortions of the\narms. The occult agents caused her to repeat this dance several times with\nperfect execution.\n[Disliking these phenomena,] Mme. X. has tried very hard to free\nherself from this control, and has to a great extent succeeded, by the use of\n,cold water, by strongly resisting all communications, and by \"passes of\ndisengagement \" executed by a hypnotiser. [This has reduced the phenomena\nalmost entirely to automatic writing, which, though vague or fantastic when\ndealing with ordinary topics, is precise and intelligent on medical questions.]\nThus far the phenomena recorded have been purely subjective ; in those\nwhich follow there is something objective also. When one has the honour to\nhe treated by a physician of Dr. Z.'s celebrity (!) ordinary kindness bids one\nsometimes think of benefiting one's neighbour. One of the officials of my\ndepartment had suffered for many years from pleurodynia, which occasionally\nlaid him up altogether, and also from frequent attacks of sick headache.\nDr. Z. was consulted and prescribed an internal treatment which, to my\ngreat surprise, consisted mainly of \"dosimetric granules\"; [which this\ngreat official surgeon had not in his lifetime employed]. He also caused Mme.\nX. to perform \"passes of disengagement \" for ten or fifteen minutes at a\ntime. It was noticeable that while these passes were made with extreme\nviolence, Mme. X. 's hands were arrested at the distance of a millimetre at\nmost from the patient's face, without ever touching him in the least. Mme.\nX. could never of herself have given to her movements such a degree of\nprecision. For two years now the patient has felt no more of his pleurodynia,\nand his migraine is, if not altogether cured, at least greatly reduced.\nOne day\u2014I suppose by way of a joke,\u2014Dr. Z., after one of these\nseances, pursued the patient with his influence as he walked home, and\n\f186 Br. A. T. Myera and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nmade him execute with his hands various gestures and contortions which\ndrew the attention of passers-by.\nAnother time, our servant A., whose husband was ill in hospital, came\ncrying to Mme. X. and told her that she had lost all hope of ever seeing him\ncured, &c. Mme. X. asked Dr. Z. to take him in hand. He promised to do\nso, and said that he would make him feel his presence. Next morning A.\nwent to the hospital and found her husband in despair. \" Look here,\" he\nsaid, ' ' besides what I had already, I am falling into a nervous malady. I\nhave been shaken about all night,\u2014my arms and legs have executed move\nments which I could not control.\" A. began to laugh, and told her husband\nthat Dr. Z. had taken him in hand, and that he would soon get well. The\npatient is going about as usual to-day, and is as well as an incurable pulmonary\naffection allows him to be.\nUnder other circumstances I have myself consulted Dr. Z. as to patients\nunder my professional care. On each occasion he has given a precise\ndiagnosis and has indicated a treatment, consisting mainly of dosimetric\ngranules, sometimes associated with other treatment. These facts have\nbeen repeated many times, and I owe great gratitude to Dr. Z. for the advice\nwhich he has given me. His prescriptions were always rational ; and when\nI showed fears as to certain doses which appeared to me too large, he took\npains to reassure me, but stuck to his prescriptions. I have never had to\nrepent having followed the advice of my eminent colleague in the other\nworld ; and I am bound to state distinctly that every time that a medical\nquestion has been submitted to him the replies and advice of Dr. Z. have\nbeen of an astonishing clearness and precision. I cannot say the same of\ncommunications obtained on other subjects, in which he seemed to take a\nmalicious pleasure in leading us wrong. He\u2014or someone else\u2014has often\nannounced to us, with minute and intimate detail, the deaths of persons\nknown to us ; who were found on inquiry to be alive and well. Lastly, I\ngive a detail which tends to prove the reality of this occult magnetisation.\nMme. X. has often seen two luminous rays projected upon her feet during\nthe seances of which I have spoken above. The rays were invisible in full\nlight, and in complete darkness, but were seen in partial obscurity and\nresembled rays of the sun passing through small openings into a dark room.\nIf this was a hallucination, it was shared on two occasions by the hypnotiser\nof whom I have already spoken. I myself never saw the rays, which may\nbo compared with those said to have been seen by somnambulists and other\nsensitives as emanating under certain circumstances from the human frame.\nIn reply to inquiries Dr. X. adds the following remarks.\nIt is not impossible that Mme. X. should have at some time heard\nmyself or others pronounce the names of the medicaments prescribed. But\nwhen she gave me an exact diagnosis, and formulated in detail a rational\ntreatment, I am sure that this did not come from her own mind. She has\nnever studied any branch of medicine\u2014neither the therapeutic art itself,\nnor the minor art of composing formulae. Nor could I have been acting\nsuggestively, since my own ideas were often quite different from those which\nthe occult agent dictated ;\u2014unless indeed my unconscious self acted upon\nMme. X.'s consciousness,\u2014which seems to me a somewhat too elaborate view.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 187\nThe dosimetric granules are a convenient mode of administering alkaloids,\nglycosides, and other toxic principles, and I have often been alarmed at the\ndoses which Dr. Z. prescribed. I confess that I was astonished to find that\nan occult agent who thus claimed to be a bygone Professor should have\nselected a form of medication on which the Faculty look with no approving\neye.\nAs to Mme. X.'s foot, I have a firm conviction that it was healed by the\nrhythmical movements imposed, and by the \"magnetisation\" of the occult\nagent.\nYou ask me whether I consider these agents as belonging to the human\ntype. Provisionally, Yes ;\u2014unless we admit that there exists, superposed\nupon our world, another world of beings distinct from humanity, but knowing\nit and studying it as we study the other regions of nature, and assuming for\nthe sake of amusement or for some other motive the role of our departed\nfriends.\nDr. X. concludes with warnings against the dangers of such\ninfluence or possession ; dangers which he thinks that Mme. X. avoided\nby her calmness of temperament and resolute maintenance of self-\ncontrol.\nThe savant already mentioned as introducing us to this case sends\nus (May, 1893) the following corroborative statement. He is, it may\nbe observed, himself a physician.\n\" I have frequently seen Mme. X. For the last year or two she has had\nno more phenomena ; but about two years ago she presented some curious\nsymptoms. In the first place, when she conversed with the late Dr. Z., her\nso-called magnetiser, his replies were made by movements of her head. She\nwould seat herself in an armchair, and according as Dr. Z. wished to say yes\nor no there were either two or three backward movements of her head.\nHer head threw itself backwards with force, and gave a vigorous blow to the\nchair-back. This movement was sometimes so violent that the shock was\npainful, so that Mme. X. cried out at the sharpness of the blows. Long\nsentences could thus be given, for when the alphabet was spelt out there\nwere movements and blows given with the head, just as in ordinary\nSpiritistic conversations there are tilts of the table. Often, also, while one\nwas talking with Mme. X. , there were movements of her head, indicating\nthat the so-called Dr. Z. was taking part in the discussion, and approving\nor disapproving such and such a phrase. More rarely, Mme. X. would\nunconsciously articulate a few words with her hps, and these words were\nprofessedly dictated by Dr. Z. As to the other phenomena, I have twice\nbeen present at the ample, semi-ecstatic movements of salutation and prayer\nwhich Mme. X. made against her will. It was a curious scene ; for Mme. X.\npreserved her consciousness all the time and continued to talk to us while\nexecuting this strange and complicated mimicry. It is to be observed that\nMme. X. is a person of calm nature, and rather apathetic than nervous.\nShe has strong common-sense, is healthy, and reasonable in character. It\nseems that she never had any previous hallucination. She is an excellent\nmother of a family, and deservedly enjoys general confidence and esteem.\"\n\f188 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nDr. X. has sent us two of the prescriptions written by Mme. X.'s\nhand We have compared them with British Pharmacopceal prescrip\ntions, by the aid of Burggraeve's Guide de Mcdecine Dosime'iriqite\n(Paris, 1872). Both prescriptions are in fair accord with English\npractice ; the doses of arsenic in the one case, of strychnia in the other,\nbeing rather stronger than usually given. Each prescription contains\nseveral ingredients, in what seems reasonable proportion.\nFinally, we learn that Dr. Z. in life was gay and fond of practical\njokes.\nThis curious narrative, which we cannot here criticise in all its\ndetails, forms an instructive preparation for our study of the cures at\nLourdes. It reminds us, in the first place, that supernormal cures do\nnot form a unique or sacred group of phenomena, needing the assump\ntion of some specially lofty origin. However effected, they will fall\nwithin some class already often discussed. If effected by some agency\nwithin the patient himself, they are a form of self-suggestion. If\neffected by some extraneous agency, they may depend upon some\ninfluence from living or departed persons, and so come under the\nmesmeric category ; or they may depend upon actual movements of\nponderable objects (as where a needle issues rapidly from the hand, in\none of the Lourdes cases), and will thus fall under the head of so-called\nspiritualistic or telekinetic phenomena. In Dr. X.'s case both mesmeric\nand telekinetic phenomena are alleged ; and also that apparent com\nmunication of medical knowledge from an unknown source which has\nbeen elsewhere noted in automatic messages, and which, though not in\nitself an act of healing, may lead to a cure. But there is nothing\nparticularly elevated or saintly about these acts of medical help and\nadvice,\u2014any more than there is anything specially saintly about medical\nadvisers while still in the flesh. Rather, the departed Dr. Z.'s skilful\ngood-nature is accompanied with a tendency to caprice and mystifi\ncation, which may be very human, but is certainly not even semi-\ndivine. Again, this story, as we have said, illustrates the extreme\ndifficulty of establishing a connection between any given unembodied\nagents and any given cure. In this case there is strong and repeated\nassertion on the agent's part ; and there is also a kind of a priori\nprobability that such help as this should come from a great surgeon, who\nis also an old friend. Take, for instance, the skilful bandaging ; that is\njust what Dr. Z. could have done ; he asserts that he is doing it; nor\ncan any other more likely source of the skill be suggested. And\nyet to Dr. X. himself, to us, and we imagine to most of our readers,\nthese assertions of Dr. Z.'s identity carry no conviction. He was never\nwilling to give any test involving knowledge of his past life ; and the\nwritings which he claimed to give were on all save medical subjects\ndreamlike and delusive. If the prescriptions really came from an un\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 189\nembodied intelligence we cannot be any more sure that that intelligence\nwas Dr. Z. than we can be sure that the author of similar prescriptions\ngiven through Miss A., and described elsewhere in this Part, was\n\" Semirus, an ancient Egyptian.\"\nAnd if, on the other hand, the phenomena were all in some way a\nproduct of the subliminal selves of Dr. and Mme. X., we still can find\nready analogies for their ascription to the discarnate friend. When a\nhypnotiser has been in the habit of sending a patient to sleep (take for\ninstance Dr. Gibert and Mme. B.) he can give her, say, a photograph\nof himself, or a box of lozenges, and tell her that when she looks at\nthe photograph, or takes a lozenge, she will go to sleep as if he were\nthere to hypnotise her. The effect will in fact follow ;\u2014and the\nsymbolic act will sometimes be accompanied on the patient's part\n(through strong association of ideas) by an impression of the\nhypnotiser's presence in the room,\u2014-or even by an actual hallucinatory\npicture of him. Yet only self-suggestion, in this supposed case, is now\nat work ; since at that moment the hypnotist is not thinking of the\npatient at all. Similarly, Mme. X.'s mind might associate the deceased\nfriend with the act of healing, and might originate a sort of hallucina\ntion of his presence which might express itself in the automatic script.\nBut if even in Dr. X.'s narrative the connection of the cures with\nthe alleged author is thus problematical, how much more is this the\ncase with the Lourdes cures, in almost all of which the patient's\nsubjective feelings\u2014his prayers and piety,\u2014are all the evidence\nforthcoming to the Virgin's intervention ! Almost the only con\nnection of the Virgin with the cures which can pretend to an\nobjective character is the so-called prediction or promise contained in\nthe words spoken to Bernadette. But we have already seen that these\nwords, naturally construed, contain no promise of cures, and no pre\ndiction whatever, unless an expression of a wish that people should\ncome in procession is a prediction that they will obey what they take\nto be a divine message. As to the idea of medical aid, it seems almost\nexpressly excluded by the words \"I do not promise to make you happy\nin this world, but in the next.\" And yet the supposed utterance of\nthese vague words by that figure, which of all figures is admitted to be\nthe one most frequently seen in purely subjective hallucinations, is\nassumed as explaining a series of cures which, to whatever cause they\nmay be due, at least offer no more intrinsic evidence of the action of\nthe Virgin Mary than certain other cures, to which we shall presently\nallude, offered of the action of ^sculapius.\nJudging, we repeat, by the canons of evidence generally used in\nthese Proceedings, we can neither say that there is any sort of proof\nthat Bernadette's vision was veridical (truth-telling as opposed to\nmerely subjective), or that the cures which have undoubtedly since\n\f190 Dr. A. T. Myers ami Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n. occurred at Lourdes bear any relation to that vision beyond what the\nminds of the patients have chosen to assume as existing. The proof of\ndivine intervention must therefore rest upon the cures themselves ;\nand these, of course, may prove so striking as to lead us to feel that,\nin the absence of all ordinary explanations, we are bound to give\nweight to those stranger causes which patients and physicians here\ncombine to invoke.\nThe medical evidence for the miracles at Lourdes has been from\ntime to time published in the 25 vols, of the Annales de Lourdes since\n1868, but it is only in the more recent years that its apologists have\nclaimed high accuracy of observation,1 and in such a wide field it is to\nthe last three or four years that our attention had best be given. In\n1891 Dr. Boissarie published his volume already cited, entitled\nLourdes, which claims to be an exact medical summary of the\nevidence for the miraculous cases made by an expert after long personal\nexamination and complete access to all the sources of information.\nThis work has been accepted by the lay supporters of the school as\ntheir technical book of reference.2 From it, therefore, we also shall\ntake our medical descriptions.\nM. 77.\nCase XII. \u2014The cure of Mlle. Blondel3 is one that deserves notice. She\nwas a lady whose history is traced far back and who had been the patient of\nmany doctors. She was born in 1839; and in 1863 and the winters of several\nsuccessive years had suffered from severe sore-throats (\" laryngo-tracheite\")\nwhich had been treatedatAmelie, Cauterets, and Mont-Dore. In 1873 (aet. 34)\n\"a rheumatic attack,\" we are told, \"affected her spinal cord and produced a\nparalysis of her lower limbs. \" Treatment by electricity, blistering, hydro-\ntherapeutics and various other methods was tried during the next five years,\nbut without improvement. In 1879 she first visited Lourdes, and was twice\nbathed in the sacred bath (pisci'\u00bbie), but even that was useless. The muscles\nof the legs were atrophied, flaccid and powerless, the skin sallow and ill-\nnourished. For three years treatment was abandoned as hopeless ; but in 1882\nshe was brought again to Lourdes as a paralytic who could only be treated by\nmiracle ; and this time the result of her first bath is claimed to have been\nmiraculous. \"In a few moments she felt cured. Without the least hesitation\nshe could get out of the bath, stand on her feet, sit down or walk about, and\nfull powers of sensation had returned to all parts.\" \" All the doctors, \"\ncontinues Dr. Boissarie, \"who had had the treatment of Mlle. Blondel\ngave a confident opinion that this was a supernatural cure.\" Whether\nmong this company of doctors are included Dr. Maurice Raynaud and\nProfessor Charcot, whom she consulted in Paris, we are not told. At any\nrate, a more observant doctor at Lourdes, Dr. de St. Maclou, seems to have\n1 Boissarie, Lourdts, p. 238. \" Depuis 1884 lea guerisons sont etudiees avec un\nsoin plus grand, si c'est possible ; avec une severity qui pourra defier tout* critique.\"\n4 Lourdes, p. 239. s Amudes de Lourdes, XXIV., p. 235.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 191\nhad his doubts ; but the cure appeared a very good instance of the supernatural\nto the rest, though not a word is said about the permanence of the recovery,\nor the alteration in nutrition, reflex action, or electrical conditions of the\nmuscles, as to which we might have expected to have heard something.\nGranted indeed the clinical facts of her ability and disability to walk, and\nloss and recovery of sensation, there seems to us no evidence for the super\nnatural. It is what we should expect to find in any case of hysterical\nparaplegia terminated by strong emotion.\nAs a parallel cure which makes no claim to be supernatural we\nmay cite in detail a case published by a distinguished Professor of\nsurgery in Glasgow, Mr. Charles Buchanan (which we are glad to notice\nhas also caught Father Clarke's eye). Mr. Buchanan visited Lourdes in\nthe autumn of 1883 and was much interested in the undoubted benefit\nthat some of the pilgrims received.\nM. 78.\nCase XIII.\u2014\"With regard,\" he writes, 1 \" to persons who have been lame\nand decrepit and known as such to their friends, the fact of their leaving their\ncrutches and walking away without help does seem astonishing and miraculous,\nand it is cases such as these which make the greatest impression.\" \" I believe\nthat the simple visit to the grotto by persons who believe in it, and the whole\nsurroundings of the place, might have such an effect on the mind that a\nsadden change in the nerve-condition might result in immediate improvement\nin cases where there is no real change of structure but where the malady is a\nfunctional imitation of organic disease. Such cases are familiar to all\nmedical men and are the most intractable they have to deal with, the disorder\nbeing in the imagination and not in the part. . . . It is rather a remark\nable coincidence that on October 2nd, 1883, within three weeks of my visit\nto Lourdes, I received a letter from Mrs. F., reminding me that some years\nbefore I had performed in her case a cure, instantaneous, and to all appear\nance miraculous, and which she properly attributed to undoubting faith in my\nword. It is a very good illustration of the kind of case to which I have been\nalluding and of the power of mind over mind, and of the effect of imagination\nin simulating real disease. Mr. F. called on me in October, 1875, and\nrequested me to visit his wife, who had been confined to bed for many months\nwith a painful affection of the spine. When I went into the house I found\nMrs. F., a woman of about thirty-one years of age, lying in bed on her left\nside and her knees crouched up, that being the position that afforded most\nrelief. She was thin and weak-looking, with a countenance indicative of\ngreat suffering. I was informed that for many months she had been in the\nsame condition. She was unable to move her limbs, any attempt being\nattended with pain, and practically she was paralytic. She was not able to\nalter her position in bed without help, and this always gave so much trouble\nthat she would have remained constantly in the same position if the\nattendants had not insisted on moving her to allow of the bedclothes being\nchanged and arranged. She had altogether lost appetite and had become\n1 Lancet, June 20th, 1885, p. 1117.\n\f192 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ndreadfully emaciated, and only took what was almost forced on her by her\nhusband and friends. She had given up all hope of recovery, but had ex\npressed a strong desire to be visited by me in consequence of something she\nhad heard from her husband connected with a health lecture he had been\npresent at many years before. When I entered her bedroom something in\nthe way she earnestly looked at me suggested the idea that I might have\nsome influence over her, supposing it to be a case of hysterical spine simu\nlating real spinal irritation and sympathetic paralysis. The Rtory I got was\nnot that of real disease of spine or cord or limbs, and I at once resolved to\nact on the supposition that it was subjective or functional and not de\npendent on actual molecular change or disintegration. I went to her\nbedside and said suddenly : ' I cannot do you any good unless you\nallow me to examine your back.' In an instant she moved slightly\nround, and I examined her spine, running my finger over it at first lightly,\nthen very firmly, without her wincing at all. I then said : ' Get out of bed\nat once.' She declared she could not move. I said, 'You can move quite\nwell ; come out of bed,' and gave her my hand, when, to the surprise of\nher husband and sister, who looked perfectly thunderstruck, she came out\nof bed with almost no help at all and stood alone. I said, ' Walk across the\nfloor, now ' ; without demur, she walked without assistance, saying, ' I can\nwalk quite well ; I knew you would cure me ; my pains are gone.' She then\nwent into bed with very little assistance, lay on her back and declared she\nwas perfectly comfortable. She was given a glass of milk, which she took\nwith relish, and I left the house having performed a cure which to the\nbystanders looked nothing short of a miracle. For many years I heard\nnothing of Mrs. F., when on October 2nd, 1883, I got the letter referred to,\nand shortly after the patient herself called at my house. In February, 1885,\nshe again called on me. She is at present in fair health, not robust, but\ncheerful and contented. She says she never altogether regained her full\nstrength ; but as an evidence that she is not feeble or unable for a good\ndeal of exertion I may state that she now lives about five miles from my\nhouse, and she made her way alone, partly by omnibus, partly by tramway\nand the rest on foot.\"\nThe extent to which such hysterical imitations of disease, such\npseudo-maladies, may be pushed without any conscious bad faith on\nthe part of the patient is very difficult to define. The diagnosis\nis perplexing, and we do not wish to accuse any of these Lourdes\npatients of bad faith. We are glad indeed to quote a recent case, too\nrecent to be included in Dr. Boissarie's book, which is described in very\nglowing terms by the cure of the district as a miracle which had\nproduced a profound impression in the neighbourhood of the patient.'\nM. 79.\nCase XIV.\u2014Mme. Antoinette Toussaint was a lady aet. 22, who on July\n14th, 1890, felt some sudden pain in her left calf and thought she must have\nsprained it, for it swelled a good deal. Various surgeons tried various remedies\nfor nearly a year, but without any success, and the sprained leg grew gradually\n1 Annates, XXIV., 246-250.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 1 93\nmore and more powerless and its muscles wasted, and were drawn up by a\nslight contracture. Her religious friends said that a healing in the bath at\nLourdes was the only chance for her. For three months her thoughts were\nset on this, and at last on August 26th, 1891, more than thirteen months\nafter the accident, she reached the grotto and after a night of pain and a\nmorning of solemn ceremony was introduced to the bath, and in leaving\n\" the miraculous water \" felt her pain and trouble all gone and her leg quite\nstraight and well again. There was a little pain next day, it is true, but\nthat was cured by another bath and she went home rejoicing with her \" legs\nas strong as iron \" and all the wasting and contracture gone. She was cured\nundoubtedly,\u2014there was no question of that ;\u2014but we are glad to observe\nthat the editors of the AimaU* for January, 1892, 1 in which the cure's\naccount is printed, have shown a spirit of honest criticism by adding a note\nto the effect that they consider this a case of \" traumatic hysteria,\" as they\nphrase it ; and that though they would not deny the sudden growth of the\nwasted muscles, yet they had not sufficient observations to prove it.\nTo come now to the majority of cases, in which the accurate proof\nof many facts in detail by first-class evidence at the time is a most\nessential point, we may quote the case of a soldier\u2014Francois Vion-\nDury, who is said to have been cured of blindness. In this instance\nthe late official doctor of the Lourdes water, Dr. de St. Maclou, who\nin several cases has shown more caution and appreciation of the\nvalue of evidence than his confreres, is very distinct in his avowal that\nthis is undoubtedly a miracle. \" Nous sommes vraiment en presence d'un\nmiracle.\" 2\nM. 80.\nCase XV.\u2014The man had entered the infantry ranks of the French army\nin 1881, when he was 21, without any exception being taken to his eyesight,\nand the next year (November, 1882) he was employed to help in putting out\na fire at Monceau-les-Mines. His eyesight was damaged, presumably by the\nflames, \" so that at the end of three months,\" he tells us, \"I could not see\nat all.\" Treatment was tried at the hospital at Dijon, and there, the patient\ntells us, the doctor told him he had \"detachment of the retina in both eyes.\"\nThat is a pathological condition which, so far as we know, invariably causes,\nso long as it is maintained, loss of sight over that part of the visual field\nwhich is affected, but which is by no means always incurable by nature or by\nsurgical art. We have no further account of his eyesight or of the pathological\ncondition of his eyes until nearly 18 months later (September 16th, 1884),\nwhen Dr. Dor, of Lyons, gave him a certificate saying that he suffered from\ndetachment of the retina in both eyes, and, \" although the retina,\" to quote\nDr. Dor's words, \"of the left eye was now re-attached,\" yet the left\neye could not distinguish light from darkness ; and the right eye could only\nsee sufficiently to count the fingers when they were held up before it at the\ndistance of about a foot. About 18 months later (January, 1886) some\nfurther treatment was tried by M. Dufour at Lausanne, which the patient\ni Annates, XXIV., p. 250-\n\u00bb Annaltt de Lourdes, XXIV., p. 30.\n0\n\f194 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ntells us had no result. In what condition M. Dufour found the eye or what\nhe did to it is not mentioned. After another four years and a half he\nbetook himself to a convent and made a novena which ended on Friday,\nAugust 1st, 1890. On the following day, Saturday, August 2nd, he went to\nconfession, and in the evening one of the convent sisters brought him a\nbottle of the Holy Water of Lourdes. He touched his eyes with it, and tells\nus that he felt it sting him as if it had been ammonia,\u2014and all at once, he\ngoes on, as quick as lightning, his sight came back to him, and he could see a\nlittle. He made another novena, and every day the sight of his left eye\ngrew better, and at the end of the nine days he could see perfectly. About\nnine months later a high ecclesiastical dignitary, the Abbe' Sonthonnax,\nbears witness to his capacity to use his eyes in doing some manual work.\nNow what does the evidence amount to here for a recovery which the\nwisest and the most prudent of the judges of the medical phenomena at\nLourdes, the late Dr. de St. Maclou, does not hesitate to call a most un\ndoubted miracle ? One medical certificate, given six years before the miracle,\nof a condition which all ophthalmic authorities admit is sometimes curable\nby nature, and whose exact observation is difficult even to the most highly\nskilled oculist,\u2014and not a single further word of expert testimony, either to\nthe state during the intervening 6 years, to the miracle itself, or to the results\nof the miracle ! The patient tells his own Htory of his feelings and we have\nthe letter of the AbW, who tells Dr. de St. Maclou that the man could see to\nuse his hands nine months after the miracle. But the true question at issue\nis not whether he could see, or thought he could see, much better at one\ntime than another ;\u2014there is no reason to dispute that, nor would it in itself\nbe miraculous ;\u2014but whether we can be perfectly sure that he had a patho\nlogical condition called \"detachment of the retina,\" which is by no means\nvery easy to observe, even for expert ophthalmological observers, and which\nfollows many different courses towards getting better or getting worse ; 1 and\nwhether we can be perfectly sure that he lost that pathological condition under\nsuch absolutely unprecedented and unique circumstances as to justify us in\ncalling the change a miracle. In weighing such a point we are bound to\nremember that we have no direct evidence that any retinal detachment\nexisted for six years before its alleged disappearance ; nor any medical evi\ndence that it did then disappear.\nThe group of cases on which the medical authorities of Lourdes\nseem to have laid more weight of late years than formerly as examples\nof supernatural healing is that of ulcers and sores, both superficial and\n1 Dr. de St. Maclou, in relating this case {Annates de Lourdes, XXIV., pp 23-30),\nquotes the opinion of a high English authority, Mr. Soelberg Wells, late Professor of\nOphthalmology at King's College, London, that this pathological condition of\ndetachment of the retina, if there is not early treatment, frequently leads to complete\nloss of sight {A Treatise on Diseases of the Eye, p. 381) ; but it is worth notice that a\nfew pages later in his book (p. 399), Mr. Soelberg Wells mentions that \" a case of\nreattachment with restored sight is described by von Gnefeand by Dr. Berlin {Klin.\nMonatsblattcr, 1863, p. 49), and Mr. Bowman has also mentioned a case to me in\nwhich he has observed the total spontaneous disappearance of a considerable detach\nment. Other cases have been related by Liebreich, Galezowski, Steffan, tc.\"\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 195\ndeep, as these afford evidence to the eye easy to appreciate when a\nfirm scar can be shown in place of the open wound. Some such cases\nare mentioned by Dr. Boissarie in the A unales de Lourdes, as occurring\nin the National Pilgrimage to Lourdes in the summer of 1891, after\nthe publication of his book. We shall say a few words later on as to\nthe rationale of such cures, but will first quote an illustrative case.\nM. 81.\nCase XVI.\u2014Amelie Chagnon 1 was a girl of 17, who was reported by her\ndoctor to have suffered for about a year from a white swelling of one knee\nand more or less disease of a bone of the left foot (second metatarsal) from\nwhich there was a discharge by a sinus nearly a third of an inch deep. She\nwas not in good general health and any attempt at a surgical operation for her\ncure was put off. She went to Lourdes August 19th, 1891, was bathed on\nAugust 21st, and went back to her convent. On August 30th the doctor makes\na report that he finds the knee no longer painful and less swollen, and a\nhealthy scar over the instep where there had been at one time a running sore.\nAbout the same time another girl, Clementine Trouve',2 came from a distance\nwith a similar disease of one of the bones of her ankle, which had lasted nearly\nthree years, and had not improved under surgical treatment. She came to\nLourdes for cure. Her foot was enveloped in bandages when she went into\nthe bath, as Amelie Chagnon's had been also. She left the bandages in the\nwater ; and it was there, in the bath, \"in a few seconds,\" Dr. Boissarie\nassures us,3 \" that an instantaneous and perfect scar was formed, at 3 p.m.,\nAugust 22nd, 1891.\" She went home, and eight days later, on September\n1st, 1891, her doctor at Lusignan gave her a certificate that a scar and a\nconsiderable amount of flattening of the sole of her foot was all that was left\nof her old disease. He certainly seems to have felt no doubt of the\nsoundness of the scar, for to her cure' he writes : \" Que ce soit le bon Dieu\nou le diable qui a gueri cette enfant, ca m'est tSgal ; mais la verity est qu'elle\nest guerie.\" But we should have liked to have known more of the details.\nWhat was the exact state of the bone and of the sore under the bandages\nwhen the girls put their feet into the bath 1 Whose eyes were fixed upon the\nsore during those few seconds when the miraculous cure was begun and\nended 7 Was the change too rapid for any human eye to tell whether it\nhealed from below or from above? We find no answer to such questions,\nand fear that a great opportunity has been missed. If we are called upon to\nadmire an instantaneous cure, we ought surely to have observations written\nand witnessed at the actual time of the change. On the other hand, we can\nfeel some sympathy with Dr. Boissarie when he explains to us how really\nimpossible it is for a small group of half-a-dozen doctors, with a crowd of\nlookers-on, some sceptical, others ignorant, to get an accurate history, a\nprecise record in writing of the present condition and of every change in and\nout of the bath of every patient, when they have some hundreds a day on\ntheir hands in time of pilgrimage.\n' Annales, XXIV., 159-163.\n= Annales, XXIV., 163-166.\n* C'est la qu'en quelques secondes une cicatrisation instantanee et complete sVtait\nop^rte.\u2014Annales, XXIV., 165.\nO 2\n\f196 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nSide by side with this last case we will place an experiment in\nsuggestion equally surprising in its way with Clementine TrouvtS's\nexperience.\nM. 82.\nCase XVII.\u2014Dr. Gibert, the well-known physician of Havre, desiring\nrecently1 to test the efficacy of suggestion in the waking state to influence\nsome pathological processes, took a boy of thirteen who had been brought\nto consult him for the warts which covered the backs of both his hands.\nThese were so thickly clustered that there was hardly any clear skin to be\nseen between them, and the boy could not bend his fingers enough to hold a\npen or even a knife and fork for his meals. M. Pierre Janet and some of\nthe doctors of Havre were gathered together to observe M. Gibert's treatment\nand its results. He took the boy's hands into his own, looked at them closely,\nand then gazed steadily in his face and asked him in a loud clear tone, \" Are\nyou wishing to be cured ? \" and as the boy answered at first half-heartedly,\nhe repeated his question several times till he got a reply with more decision.\n\" Yes, sir, I am wishing.\" \" Mind what I say, then,\" said M. Gibert. \" I am\ngoing to wash you with blue water ; but if the warts are not gone in a week I\nshall wash you with yellow water. Here ! Charles ! bring me the blue water. \"\nThen he sponged his hands with some water with a little blue colouring matter\nin it and dried them carefully. When they met again on that day week the\nwarts were all gone except two or three. M. Gibert took him by the hands as\nbefore and gave him a sound scolding for not having got rid of every one of\nthem. Then he sponged his hands with yellow tinted water without any drug\nin it, which the boy fancied had something burning about it ; and a few days\nlater the last traces of the warts were gone and the skin was completely\nhealthy. This bold experiment illustrates the effect that the mind when duly\nstimulated may in some cases have upon morbid conditions of the body\nwhich medical and surgical science is puzzled how to relieve ; for warts,\nthough they sometimes grow slowly smaller and smaller and finally after\nmuch more than a week disappear \"by nature,\" as we phrase it in our\nignorance, yet are very intractable indeed to any medical or surgical treatment.\nOne might, moreover, have expected that warts, which involve only the\nepidermis, would bo specially rebellious to suggestions which affect directly,\nas we must suppose, only the nervous system. To make a wart drop off is\nalmost like making a nail turn brittle. Yet from the days of Lord Bacon\ndownwards the warts themselves drop off at the word of the charmer, while\nthe fact of their dropping off, as that philosopher puts it, \" doth yet stick\nby us.\"\nOne further specimen of a cure of a very striking class may be here\ngiven.\nCongenital deaf-mutism may be due to causes of very various cur\nability, but it is naturally one of the most conspicuous and distressing\nof all bodily defects.\nM. 83.\nCase XVIII.\u2014Dr. Boissarie gives us (p. 173) a short history of the\n' Revue Scientifiqui, February 4th, 1893, d. 187.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 197\npartial cure of Aurelie Bruneau, who after being educated as a deaf-mute,\n(though we have no medical account of the extent of her infirmity), partially\nrecovered hearing after dropping Lourdes water for three days into her ears.\nDr. de la Mardelle thus reports : \" She hears blows struck on the outside of\na door, or notes of a piano in the next room ; and not only does she hear but\nshe pronounces some words, and it is because she hears that she speaks.\nFrom this fact we are obliged to conclude that this cure, obtained outside\nordinary processes, and without the help of any treatment, seems invested\nwith a supernatural character.\"\nIt does not appear to us, as it does to Dr. Boissarie, that this case presents\n\" all the guarantees which the severest criticism could desire.\" Is the per\nception of vibrations from blows on a door or from the playing of a piano a\nproof of restored hearing ? Is it miraculous that a deaf-mute should have\nbeen taught to speak \"a few words,\" when she has been brought up till\ntwenty in an \"institution de sourdes-muettes.\" ?\nLet us place beside this cure another somewhat similar, though\nmore striking, cure of deafness, whose supposed author was, we are\ntold, addressed in consequence \" in language of worship, and exalted\nto the height of a supernatural being.\"\nThe narrative was first published in D. D. Home's Incidents in\nmy Life, but is reprinted with further names, and with the letters of\nMme. de Cardonne, by Mme. Home in D. D. Home, his Life and\nMission, p. 80.1\nM. 84.\nCase XIX.\u2014\"On March 19th, 1857,\" says Mr. Home, whose account we\nslightly abridge, \" when I was residing at 13, Rue des Champs Elysees, I\nreceived a letter from a stranger to me, Mme. A. de Cardonne, of 233, Rue\nSt. Dominique, St. Germain, stating that she had had a dream, in which she\nhad seen her own mother and mine, and that the latter had told her to seek\nme at once, in order that her son, who had been deaf four years from the\neffect of typhoid fever, might be cured. This was so strongly impressed\nupon her mind that she wrote to me to say that she would call upon me\nwith her son the following morning at ten.\n\" Accordingly, the next morning she presented herself with her son at my\n1 As regards the genuineness of Mme. de Cardonne's letters, and the general truth\nfulness of the account, as representing the facts as conceived by those who wer\nparties to them, we may refer our readers to the S.P.R. Journal, Vol. IV., p. 101.\n\"Madame Home has been good enough to meet one of us (Mr. F. W. H. Myers) in\nParis, and has there allowed him freely to examine the collection of autograph MSS.\non which the book is founded. He thus went through the letters of more than a\nhundred correspondents, and he compared these letters, in important cases textually,\nin other cases in a more general manner, with the printed excerpts or translations in\nMme. Home's volume. The conclusion is that the letters given in the volume may be\nconfidently accepted as genuine. In many cases the handwriting of the correspon\ndents was already known to Mr. Myers ; in many others there were postmarks, official\nstamps, crests, monograms, &c., on the letters which indicated their date or source ;\nand in no case was there any circumstance of suspicion.\" Mme. de Cardonne's\nletters were among those thus examined ; see list in Journal, Vol. IV., p. 117.\n\f198 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nrooms, there being present Princess de Beauveau and Miss Ellice, who\nwere with me previous to my leaving Paris that very day. I had uniformly\nrefused such visits, but on this occasion I had been so much preoccupied\nthat I had not been able to acknowledge her letter. It was an embarrassing\nmeeting for both of us : the mother yearning for her son's recovery, and I not\nknowing how I was to be instrumental in healing this long total deafness, the\nmore so that operations had been performed on the boy, as I afterwards\nfound, by eminent surgeons in Paris, who had said that it was impossible he\nshould ever be restored to hearing. During the mother's recital, describing\nthe various surgical operations to which he had been subjected, my sympathies\nwere deeply moved, and I had unwittingly thrown my left arm about the boy\nand drawn him toward me, so that the boy's head rested upon my shoulder.\nWhilst in this position, and as Mme. de Cardonne was telling some of the\nmost painful particulars, I passed my hand caressingly over the boy's head,\nupon which he, partly lifting his head, suddenly exclaimed in a voice trembling\nwith emotion, ' Maman, je t'entends ! ' (Mamma, I hear you !) The mother\nfixed on him a look of astonishment, and said ' Emile ! ' and he at once\nreplied ' Quoi 1 ' She then, seeing that the child had heard her question,\nfainted with emotion. . . . The boy was able to resume his studies and\nhas continued to hear perfectly up to the present time.\"\n\" It was characteristic of Home (continues Mme. Home) that as soon as\nMme. Cardonne had left him he quietly finished his preparations, and started\nfor America, without troubling himself in the least to make public the\nparticulars of this wonderful cure, or to obtain the attestations of the mother\nand the witnesses. It was not till his return from America with his sister\nthat Mme. de Cardonne could write to him the grateful letter [May 30th,\n1857] from which I extract the following passages : . . . ' Messenger\nof Divine Providence ! bless you, for you have wrought a miracle for my\nson ! ' Mme. de C. writes again June 17th, 1857 : ' My son, who never\nceases to bless you, begs me every day to take him to see you. He is so\nhappy to have recovered his hearing that he cannot rest till he expresses to\nyou his gratitude.' \"\nThus far we have been mainly engaged in pointing out the\nimperfections of the Lourdes evidence to cures, and the parallels to\nthose cures which have been recorded among quite other surroundings.\nWe have a few remarks to add on the uncertainty and difficulty of\neven the best medical diagnosis and prognosis in many cases where\npopular opinion regards the malady as something unmistakable,\nwhose future course can be clearly foreseen. To illustrate this point we\ntake five maladies, whose cure is treated in the Annales de Lourdes as\nobviously beyond the powers of suggestion. These are :\u2014\nPhthisis,\nAtrophy,\nOrganic Paralysis,\nUlcers,\nCancers.\nLet us say a few words on each of these heads in turn.\n\fMind-Gwre, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 199\nPhthisis may be a disease which our art cannot cure, but it is by\nno means a disease which cannot cure itself. \" Complete arrest of the\ndisease,\" (say Drs. J. K. Fowler and E. Clifford Beale, in the Diction\nary of Practical Medicine), \" is occasionally observed under the most\nunfavourable circumstances ; such cases falsifying every rule of\nprognosis.\" And Professor Jaccoud (one of the best French\nauthorities) insists in his book on the Curability of Phthisis, that the\ntubercular growth in the lung occasionally dries up, becoming caseous,\nchalky or fibrous, and so remaining for 20 years with no percep\ntible symptoms, though still plainly visible on post-mortem examina\ntion. And apart from these rare lifelong cures, temporary remissions of\nthe disease occur frequently, and with such surprising suddenness\nof improvement that patients constantly think that there is a complete\ncure when there is not, and physicians not seldom, after many years'\nobservation, conclude that either there never was tubercle, or that the\nlung now contains nothing but healed scars of the old disease. A\npost-mortem examination is often the only way of discovering whether\nthere really has been phthisis or no. Thus the best judges are often\nleft in doubt ; and the mistakes of the less experienced are innumerable.\nSuch being the facts, we cannot attach importance to such a cure,\nfor instance, as that of Sister Julienne (Boissarie, 30, 326), where,\nin the first place, we have no proof of the existence of tubercle before\nthe cure,1 and in the second place no proof of the permanence of the\ncure. The disease may have been a chronic nervous cough, with bron\nchitis and dyspepsia.\nAtrophy.\u2014The rapid disappearance of atrophy, claimed in some of\nthese cases, is now recognised as a possible result of nervous stimulus.\nThe statements from Lourdes are not definite enough on this point.\nWeights, measurements, records of pressure exercised on dynamometer,\nare conspicuously absent.\nOrganic Paralysis. \u2014Next as to paralysis depending not on mere\nhysterical disability, but on actual cerebral and spinal injury. We\nshall quote a typical recent cure from Lourdes, regarded as miraculous\nby the patient's medical adviser, 2 and shall then give our reasons for\nconsidering that there may have been, in fact, no organic injury still\npersisting at the time when the cure began.\nM. 85.\nCash XX.\u2014Mme. FourS had led a healthy life on a farm near Dieppe until\n1 The phrase \"crachats caracteristiques \" (p. 325) is an insufficient and second\nhand statement. '' Creusee par les tubercules \" (same page) is thus an unproved\nassumption ; and since Koch has shown that tubercle is an essentially parasitic\ndisease, we cannot be satisfied without some real demonstration of the presence of the\nparasite or bacillus.\n* Dr. C. Helot, Annates de Lourdes, XXIII., pp. 161-170, 194-208, and 217-220.\n\f200 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nat the age of 55, on May 16th, 1886, she had an apoplectic attack, which left\nher with a \"crossed hemiplegia,\"\u2014that is to say, some paralysis of the left\nside of her face, and also of her right leg and arm. There was gradual recovery ;\nand after twelve weeks she could walk with a stick only. There was no\naphasia, but an indistinctness of speech, which got well before she visited\nLourdes. As is usual in such cases the arm recovered more slowly than the\nleg. It continued very weak, the fingers and elbow in a state of semi-flexion\nand of more or less complete anaesthesia. Rigidity, a more serious symptom\nin such cases, seems to have been absent. But it is hard to realise the state of\nthe arm, since we are told later on that although it had not changed its\ncondition she could not move it half an inch,1 and also2\u2014which seems\nabsolutely inconsistent\u2014that even before the leg recovered she used the\nright as well as the left arm to lift the leg. After the first three months\nprogress was slow. Dr. Helot first saw her sixteen months after the onset\nof the paralysis. He tells us little of her state except that her speech\nimproved and that she could stand on her right leg alone for a few seconds,\nand walk haltingly. He gives no account of reflexes, electrical condition,\nnutrition, or tone of muscles, or of regions of cutaneous anaesthesia ; nor\ndoes he seem to have attempted any treatment, whether by medicine,\nmassage, or electricity. In September, 1888, the patient, who was now much\ndepressed in mind, visited Lourdes with her son, the Abbe Foure, but with\nno medical man in attendance. Three baths in the sacred spring failed to do\ngood ; and on leaving Lourdes she insisted, just before telling her beads,\nthat more grace must be shown her next year. As she told the beads she\nnoticed more power in her right hand and in her right leg also. She tried\nmore movement with the right leg and found that it succeeded, \u2014and then\nwith the right arm and that succeeded also. She was delighted and cried out\nloudly, \" Cured ! cured ! Do you see I am cured ! \" She seemed to the Abbe\nto have lost both her anaesthesia and her paralysis ; and three days later, when\nDr. Helot saw her again, she seemed to him certainly to have lost the\nanaesthesia of the right arm and only to limp a little from habit, as convict*!\ndo who have worn a chain on one side for a long time. Within a fortnight she\ncould walk easily some eight or ten miles, and her power has been maintained\nafterwards for the two years following ; for she was carefully re-examined\nby Dr. Helot on August 11th, 1890. Such a case is interesting, but the\nevidence is too incomplete for any clear medical diagnosis. The description\nof the patient before going to Lourdes is inadequate ; the account of the\nphenomena at Lourdes is unfortunately second-hand and not by expert\nwitnesses, and deals with such phenomena as need the most highly trained\nobservers for their complete description.\nNow we suggest that although there was here almost certainly\nsome organic paralysis to begin with, yet the history of the case, so far\nas given, is consistent with the supposition that this true paralysis\ngradually disappeared, leaving behind it a functional paralysis, induced\n(as we are forced vaguely to say) by the altered habits of the organism,\nbut not necessarily presenting any obviously hysterical symptoms.\n1 p. 163. \u00bb p. 167.\n\fMind-Care, Faith-Cwre, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 201\nSuch a paralysis might rapidly disappear under emotional stimulus. In\nsupport of this view we cite the following sentences from a recent\nwork of authority, namely, Various Forms of Hysterical or Functional\nParalysis, by Professor Bastian, F.R.S. (London, 1893). On p. 122,\nProfessor Bastian says : \" It has, of course, long been known that\norganic disease of the nervous system often co-exists with hysterical\nsymptoms ; but I have only lately realised the extent to which actual\nfunctional paralysis and paralysis of organic origin may co-exist so\nas greatly to lessen the apparent gravity of the cases, or vice versd\"\n. . . And p. 124, \"The ultimate establishment of a cure may be\nconsidered the rule in cases of functional paralysis. ... In some\ncases, both of spasm and palsy, a cure may be brought about compara\ntively speedily and often abruptly.\" Also p. 1.: \" Hysteria is, after all,\nonly one of the general conditions under the influence of which paralyses\nof a purely functional type may develop themselves. Because a case\nbelongs to the latter category, therefore, we must not on this account\nlook upon it as necessarily hysterical in its origin. But this is what is\nonly too frequently done.\"\nUlcers.\u2014And just as it is to this very recent work of Dr. Bastian's\nthat we must appeal for the truest view yet attainable of the extent\nto which so-called hysterical or functional conditions\u2014conditions, that\nis to say, not involving nervous lesions which our present microscopes\ncan discern\u2014are effective in inducing paralysis ; so also is it to an\nequally recent utterance of Dr. Charcot that we must appeal for the\ntruest view yet attainable of the extent to which similar hysterical or\nfunctional conditions are effective in inducing actual (neurotic)\ntumours,1 (which must not be confounded with \" phantom tumours \"),\nactual suppurating ulcers and cutaneous gangrene. In a paper in the\nNew Review for January, 1893, Professor Charcot analyses at length a\ncase of this kind whose cure was imputed to miracle ; not at Lourdes,\nbut in 1731, and by virtue of the touch of a shift which had touched\nthe tomb of the Deacon Paris, and of some earth from the neighbour\nhood of that tomb. After describing the details of a really terrible\ndisease, which had lasted for fifteen years, Dr. Charcot gives the\nrationale of the cure as follows :\u2014\n\" The oedema which was due to vaso-motor trouble disappeared\nalmost instantaneously. The breast regained its normal size. There\nis nothing astonishing in this, since we know with what rapidity\ntroubles of the circulation may appear and disappear. When the\noedema disappeared, the local conditions affecting the nutrition of the\ntissues were favourably modified ; the wound on the breast was\n1 See Dr. Fowler on Neurotic Tumourt of the Breast, a paper read before the\nNew York Neurological Society, January 7th, 1890. New York Medical Record,\nFebruary 19th, 1890.\n\f202 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\npermitted to heal by virtue of physiological laws as well known as\nthose which had previously operated to produce the gangrene.\"\nThe doctrine which Professor Charcot thus formulates is no mere\nisolated opinion. It belongs to a general view which has of late years\nbeen rapidly gaining ground as to the trophic function of certain\nnerves, and the rapid changes in nutrition which vaso-motor nervous\ndisturbance can induce.\nIt is strange to reflect that all these phenomena are, so to say,\nlineal descendants of the stigmata of St. Francis. Ill-attested though\nthat famous case may be, it can now no longer be classed as in itself\nimprobable. If it bo true, it will not be the only instance in which\nthe Acta Sanctorum have pointed us to facts of deep import to science,\n\u2014which facts, nevertheless, have had to overcome the strongest scientific\nprepossession. The danger of any prepossession, however natural, can\nhardly be better illustrated than by the position of those who still\nendeavour to deny all save the most superficial effects of hypnotic\nsuggestion. Such reasoners, when confronted with the phenomena\nwhich we are studying in this paper, are obliged either to meet a grow\ning mass of testimony with blank incredulity, or to yield to the\nmiraculous pretensions with which that testimony is accompanied.\nTheir disbelief in stigmata, for instance, although that disbelief be\nmaintained in the interest of \" natural causes \" as opposed to \" super\nnatural seemings,\" cuts from beneath their feet the actual and only\nanswer to some of these reverse processes at Lourdes,\u2014these abolitions\nby mental impression of physical disturbances just such as (in our\nview) mental impressions can themselves create. For the open-minded\ninquirer, on the other hand, these wonders begin to shape themselves\ninto something like law. To one axioma medium, at any rate, we\nseem now to see our way. Whatever suggestion can cause, hysteria can\ncause ; and whatever suggestion or hysteria can cause, suggestion can\ncure.\nCancer.\u2014But now for our last disease, which neither suggestion\nnor any form of medical treatment has yet dominated. The Annales\nde Lourdes contain several cases of the miraculous cure of cancer. It\nwould be of little use to cite these cases in detail. The objector will\nof course maintain that they were not true cancer ; the apologist will\nask what, then, is the definition of true cancer, unless it be \" cancer\nthat does not get well \" ? It will be more to our present purpose to\nquote in brief an account\u2014at least equally well-attested,\u2014of the cure\nof cancer by mesmeric passes. The account is from Dr. Elliotson, who,\nbe it remembered, was one of the ablest and most experienced physicians\nof his generation.\nM. 86.\nCase XXI.\u2014\"On the 6th of March, 1843, a very respectable person.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 203\naged 42, fair, and with the sallow complexion of cancer, called to solicit my\nadvice respecting a disease of her right breast. I found an intensely hard\ntumour in the centre of the breast, circumscribed, moveable, and apparently\nabout five or six inches in circumference ; that part was drawn in and\npuckered, as though a string attached behind the skin at one point had pulled\nthe surface inwaids ; and upon it, to the outer side of the nipple, was a dry,\nrough, warty-looking substance, of a dirty brown and greenish colour. She\ncomplained of great tenderness in the tumour and the arm-pit when I applied\nmy fingers, and said that she had sharp stabbing pains through the tumour\nduring the day, and was continually awakened by them at night. ... I\nat once saw that it was a decided cancer in the stage termed scirrhus.\n. . . Her father's mother had died of a \"bleeding cancer\" of the\nbreast. ... I proposed mesmerism to her ; my purpose was to render\nher insensible to the pain of the surgical removal of the breast, seeing no\nother chance for her ; and this, indeed, was a poor chance, for cancer\ninvariably returns.\" Four other physicians and Mr. Samuel Cooper, Professor\nof Surgery at University College, London, concurred in pronouncing it\ncancer. The history of the case is one of gradual improvement under\nmesmerism, with some relapses, apparently coinciding with intermissions of\nmesmeric treatment. The patient was extremely susceptible and exhibited\nremarkable phenomena of many kinds.\nIn 1846 all pain ceased. In 1848 Dr. Elliotson reports :\u2014\n\" The cancerous mass is now completely dissipated ; the breast is\nperfectly flat : and all the skin rather thicker and firmer than before the\ndisease existed. Not the smallest lump is to be found : nor is there the\nslightest tenderness of the bosom or the armpit.\" \"The diseased mass was\ndissipated and absorbed, and painlessly and imperceptibly.\" 1\nOf this case we will only say that it seems to us impossible to\naccept any one of the Lourdes cures of cancer and at the same time to\nreject Dr. Elliotson's. What the disease was in either case, or how it\nwas dispelled, we do not know. We quote Dr. Elliotson's narrative\nmerely as one more non-miraculous parallel to an alleged miraculous\ncure.\nAnd here our detailed discussion of the Lourdes miracles must\nclose. From among a great mass of striking, but ill-reported, cures, we\nhave selected some of the most striking, which were at the same time\namong the best attested, and we have shown that cures greatly\nresembling these have been attained under circumstances where no\nclaim to miracle has been advanced. We have also pointed out\nsome of the points in which the Lourdes evidence must be greatly\nimproved if it is to be the basis of any serious conclusions\nfor the scientific world. More than this we cannot do. We have\nleft many striking cures untouched, and although we could find\nparallels for some of these, we could not for all. It would, indeed,\n1 Cure of a true Cancer of the Female Breast with Mesmerism, by Dr. Elliotson.\nZoist, Vol. VI., pp. 213-237.\n\f204 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhave been surprising if we could; if with our own imperfect\nknowledge, applied to these imperfect records, we had been able to\nshow convincingly what happened in each special case. Moreover,\namong the vast number of patients treated at Lourdes, there are\nlikely, by the mere law of chances, to have been some better subjects\nfor suggestion than have elsewhere been found, and consequently some\ncures which have not as yet been equalled elsewhere. For a fair\ncomparison it would be needful to take some other group of patients,\nbearing a known proportion to the Lourdes patients, and to compare\nthe proportion of alleged cures in each group,\u2014a test at present\nimpossible to apply.\nIf, then, we are asked for a provisional judgment on these various\ngroups of facts, as thus far recorded, we may give it in three clauses,\nas follows :\u2014\n1. No one of the special forms of psycho-therapeutic which we\nwere asked to examine has yet produced evidence definite enough to\nsatisfy reasonable men of any miraculous agency, however surprising\nthe cure may sound.\n2. Many forms of psycho-therapeutics produce, by obscure but\nnatural agencies, for which at present we have no better terms than\nsuggestion and self-suggestion, effects to which no definite limit can as\nyet be assigned.\n3. Thus far Lourdes offers the best list of cures ; but this superiority\nis not more than can be explained by the greater number of patients\ntreated there than elsewhere, and their greater confidence in the treat\nment. There is no real evidence, either that the apparition of the\nVirgin was itself more than a subjective hallucination, or that it has\nany more than a merely subjective connection with the cures.\nWith a few words on each of these clauses we must conclude our\npaper.\n1. There need be no real difficulty in greatly improving the kind of\nevidence now offered, if there is any real cure to report. The Faith-\nhealers, as is plain, both from our own citations and from Dr. Schofield's\nbook, are the worst offenders in this respect, showing too often a\npositive unwillingness to submit their alleged cures to even the\nfriendliest medical scrutiny. At Lourdes much has been done to\nimprove the earlier vagueness of record ; and it is still more satisfactory\nto observe that the present physicians (in spite of protestations which\nsometimes read absurdly enough 1 ) do sometimes recognise that a\n1 BoiBsarie, p. 238 : \"Since 1884 the cures have been studied with, if possible,\neven greater care,\u2014with a severity which can defy all criticism. The physician\ndeputed to the care of the patients analyses and tests all the facta whioh present\nthemselves. He brings to this great inquiry a method and a system which may\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 205\ngreat chance of evidence has been missed through their insufficiency.\n\" Of course,\" says Dr. Boissarie, 1 \" if we had known beforehand that\nClementine Trouve\" was going to be cured at 3 p.m. on August 22nd,\n1891, we should have got together fifteen or twenty doctors on the\nmorning of that day, and taken them to see her ; and we should have\nmade an examination and probed the sore, and written down all that\nwe observed. But as it was, we had no time to do it. For such treat\nment we should want as many doctors as we have patients.\"\nNot quite as many doctors as patients,\u2014but no doubt a larger\nproportion of staff to cases than is usual in a hospital when the exact\nstate of a patient before and after a particular moment is less often a\nmatter of importance. If, moreover, as we gather from Father Clarke,\nonly about two per cent, of the Lourdes cures are ultimately classed as\nmiraculous, much time would necessarily be consumed in noting facts\nto which little subsequent interest would attach. But what of that 1\nand what medical discoveries have ever been made without some such\nlavish and ungrudging expenditure of time and pains ? Such investi\ngation at Lourdes is in the last resort a mere question of money.\nLarge sums have been spent for emotional purposes\u2014in churches or\nprocessions\u2014and have, no doubt, achieved emotional ends. If scientific\nends are to be achieved also, the number of physicians at Lourdes will\nhave to bear a somewhat higher proportion to the number of priests.\nWe must repeat that it is no imaginary, no impossible standard of\nevidence which we have been throughout upholding. In the Trans\nactions of the Clinical Society of London (to take London alone),\u2014\nin the Reports of the leading hospitals,\u2014nay, in the principal\nnewspapers which treat of medicine,\u2014the reader may find hundreds\nof cases whose evidence reaches the level on which we insist. One\ncase from the first-named source we will briefly cite, as illustrating\ntwo points which have a direct bearing on our present discussion.2\nThe first point is the degree of care and accuracy needed to determine\nwith absolute conclusiveness even one single and simple fact of clinical\nobservation. The second point is the strangeness of the fact itself\u2014a\nstrangeness which, in an entourage that way disposed, might well have\nbeen held to reach the level of a miracle.\nOur readers are doubtless aware that since the general introduction\nof the elinical thermometer some forty years ago the temperature of\npatients in grave, or often in slight maladies, is habitually taken by\nserve as a model to all those who may wish to follow in his steps. \" Read in con\nnection with the picked accounts given by Dr. Boissarie himself, such phrases as\nthese do certainly remind us that their author has been mdi depuis pliwieuri annea\nau mtruvement rcligieux de son tempt.\n1 Annates de Lourdes, XXIV., p. 128.\n* Clinical Society's Transactions, 1875, p. 98.\n\f206 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nits aid. Many thousands of these simple observations are made daily in\nthe United Kingdom alone. Among the millions of observations which\nhave thus far been recorded a remarkable uniformity prevails. The\ntemperature of ordinary health is from 98 deg. to 99 deg. Fahrenheit,\nand each additional degree implies a perceptible increment of febrile\ndisturbance. A temperature of 106 deg. is a most serious symptom ;\nand perhaps not one person per million per annum reaches 110 deg.\nNot one person in a generation, so far as we know, reaches 115 deg. ;\nand no one in any country had ever been known to reach 120 deg.\nEach day\u2014each hour\u2014during which temperatures above 106 deg.\nare maintained adds to the gravity of the prognostic.\nYet, such being the facts, Mr. J. W. Teale, of Scarborough, on\nFebruary 26th, 1875, presented a report to the Clinical Society of\nLondon, of a lady under his care, who, after a fall from her horse, had\nmaintained for seven consecutive weeks a temperature never found less\nthan 108deg., and who on four several days had shown a temperature\nof 122deg. In spite of this unheard-of condition of things, he reported\nfurther that his patient had recovered. After this it seemed natural\nto ask this medical Munchausen whether he had ever personally\nobserved a case like that of St. Denys, who walked about with his head\nunder his arm.1 But gibes were silenced when Mr. Teale produced his\nproofs. Seven thermometers had been used for the observation. Three\nof these were made specially for the occasion. Four were sent to be\ntested at Kew, and found correct within a tenth of a degree. Each\nthermometer was inspected by two or three trustworthy witnesses\nbefore and after each observation, and the results were at once\nrecorded in writing. No hot water bottles were allowed in the room.\nThe temperature was taken in two, and sometimes in three parts of the\nbody simultaneously. Each thermometer, after having been shaken down\nto normal, was changed in position, and readings again compared, to\n\u2022eliminate any local accident or fraud. Finally, these elaborate observa\ntions were continued daily for nearly ten weeks. And thus, \" in spite\nof the widespread consternation at such a revolution of [previous]\nnotions, yet it was impossible to question the accuracy of the record.\"2\nHere then, is a fact. And if it was worth while to take this\ntrouble in order to prove the truth of this isolated clinical observation,\nwhich at present we can neither understand nor make use of, what\ntrouble ought we not to take if we had any chance of proving that a\ndirect divine intervention has remedied even the least of human ills ?\n2. The second clause of our conclusion, which pointed out that no\nsingle scheme of psychical healing could at present establish a\n1 Britiih Medical Journal, 1875, Vol. I., p. 347.\n* Lancet, 1875, Vol. I., p. 340.\n\fMind-Cure, Faith-Cure, and the Miracles of Lourdes. 207\npre-eminent claim to success, simply because there was so much of\nundefined prospect of this kind in so many directions, is naturally\nintended to stimulate, and not to check, further effort along each path\nwhich has thus far led to success. For the hope is that that second,\nor psychological, element in all therapeutics, which has thus far been\nleft to chance and wonder, while the physiological element has fallen\nunder settled law, may itself also be gradually recognised as an orderly\npart of Nature, presenting definite and partially soluble problems of\nits own. Nascitur ars secunda medendi. Or let us say, in purely\nphysiological language, that we seem on the eve of one more forward\nstep along a road which medicine has long been pursuing. Our process\nhas as a rule been from local to general treatment ; from the appli\ncation or affusion of external remedies on the diseased part to the\ningestion of remedies through the stomach, and then oh to the injection\nor infusion of remedies through the blood. We now propose to heal the\npatient's tissues not through the stomach, nor through the blood, but\nthrough the brain ; to utilise the controlling and innervating, as yre\nhave utilised the diffusive and the peptic power. Affusion, ingestion,\ninfusion, suggestion. At each step we touch the ill more intimately ;\nwe call more directly upon the patient's own inward forces to effect the\nneeded change.\n3. The third clause of our judgment explained the superiority of\nresults at Lourdes over results at other faith-healing centres, by the\nsuperior numbers and faith of the pilgrims resorting thither. But how\nis that superior faith itself to be explained 1 Why should the Lourdes\ngrotto prove a more potent rallying point than the \" Metaphysical\nCollege of Massachusetts \" 1\u2014\"Wandering between two worlds \"\u2014thus\nhas a poet described the present attitude of the spirit of man ;\u2014\nWandering between two worlds, one dead,\nThe other powerless to be born.\nThe words spoken of human faith in its wider bearings are\neminently true of the special form of faith necessary for psycho\ntherapeutics. We have discovered that faith will heal ; our difficulty\nis to find something in which to have faith. For the patient must in\nsome way picture to himself the agency which is to effect his cure.\nHe once pictured to himself the mesmeric effluence, and whether that\neffluence were there or no, the cure often came. He has now been\ntaught to distrust mesmeric effluence, and nothing has been given to\nhim in which to believe in its stead. He is ready to pin his faith upon\ngreat hypnotising physicians. But he finds these very physicians dis\nclaiming special powers, maintaining that hypnotic sleep is ordinary\nsleep, and that \" there is nothing in hypnotism but the name.\" If\nindeed, they succeed in hypnotising him, their negative theories do not,\n\f208 Dr. A. T. Myers and Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nperhaps, check the result. But in his habitual waking state he is now\nsimply advised to practise self-suggestion, and for the ordinary patient\nthis is not enough. Charlatans step in and occupy the empty field.\nWild theories, as we have seen, are invented. The new faith is power\nless to be born.\nAnd in the meantime that faith which the poet counted as dead,\u2014\nwhich science is apt to pass by unheeding,\u2014is living and efficacious\nstill. It is not really with Roman Catholic doctrines alone that we\nhave to do at Lourdes. That great Church under whose wing these\npilgrims are sheltered still represents the hopes, the fears, the creeds\nof a thousand generations of rude and ancient men. Lying for\ncenturies beneath her deeps, those primitive symbols have \" suffered a\nsea-change Into something rich and strange \" ;\u2014but each element of\nthe mystery of Lourdes\u2014dark grotto and sacred spring, neuvaine and\ndream and apparition\u2014carries us back to primitive memories and a\nsimple and pagan Past. Here is once more the oxd\/ia -fit,\u2014the\nearth-mouth of the old Chthonian worship, with its hidden fountain\nwhere Earth the izparrofLavrit herself uttered her healing oracles, or\npoured her virtue through divinities of later birth ;\u2014as at Acharaca.\nthrough the Kdpij,\u2014the Virgin of the underworld. Around that grotto,\ntoo, the votaries gathered in their navfiyvpis,\u2014a gathering half fair, half\npilgrimage,\u2014and sought in thousands the god-sent life-renewing power.\nAnd in later days, when the Heroes\u2014the Saints of Hellenic faith,\u2014\nbegan to be more widely worshipped, the Asklepeia of Epidaurus,\nof Cos, of Pergamus, give us examples of the impassioned expectation,\nthe critical moment, the sudden cure. There, too, on every side were\nthe public thanksgivings, the votive offerings ;\u2014and sometimes after\nthe solemn \"incubation,\" (represented now by the neuvaine of\nprayer), the rare \" theophany,\" like the Lourdes apparition, would add\nits consecrating assurance to the healing shrine. At Rome itself there\nwas an Asklepeion which augurs consulted without a smile. There, too,\nas the ex voto tablets still tell us,1 \" the blind Gaius touched the altar,\nand then his eyes, and saw, and gave thanks before all men \" ; and the\nphthisical Lucius \" took ashes from the altar, and mixed them with\nwine, and laid them on his side, and was healed of that disease, and the\nmultitude rejoiced with him.\"\nAll these things the newer Rome has received and transfigured ; and\nwith them much of emotion which the world cannot lightly lose ;\u2014\nthe succouring comradeship of deified natures,\u2014HSrakles, Trophonius,\nAsklepius, Amphiaraus,\u2014the sense of the nearness, the benignity, of\nheroic and enfranchised souls. We seem to see the great Church, like-\nNile after the rout of Actium, \" spreading broad her breast, and with\n1 Inscrr. ap. Bouch^-Leclereq, Hist. Div.

Can any new faith, as\nabsolute, as reverent as the old, guide, like the old, its votaries to\nhealing of body as well as soul 1\nAbsolute as the old the new faith might perhaps become if\npsychological therapeutics should win their assured place by the side\nof physiological ; if it should be recognised that here, too, our appeal is\nmade to no chance caprice or uncertain favour, but to inflexible and\neternal Law. Then, perhaps, the most scientific man would be the\nmost confident, and it would be the sign of wisdom to seek self-healing\nwith the directness of a child. Or is it possible that something beyond\nmere logical conviction may be needed for the profounder cure ; that\nthe self-healing must needs be felt to depend ultimately on something\nbehind and above the Self ? It may be that the inmost effort must\nstill be a religious one, and that to change man deeply it needs a touch\nupon that mainspring deep in man. What, then, for such a purpose,\nmust the religion of science mean 1 It must mean at least the ancient\nacceptance of the Universe as good, the ancient sense of the individual\neffort as co-operant with a vaster Power.

Untersnchmu\/eii iiber den Thierischeu\nMagnetismus. Von Dr. Med. Albert Moll, in Berlin. A. Abel,\nLeipzig, 1892, pp. 242.\nDr. Moll promised us in his well-known work on Hypnotism a special\nstudy of the phenomena of rapport, and he has given us an exceedingly\nsolid and valuable piece of work. He records an elaborate series of\nexperiments, often most ingenious, carried out by himself with the aid\nof several friends, amongst whom Dr. Max Dessoir and Herr Colonie-\nDirector Sellin were his most constant colleagues.\nDr. Moll directs his inquiry to the problem of the nature of the\ninfluence exercised by the hypnotiser. The original mesmerists held that\nthis took place through the medium of some special force effluent from\nthe body of the agent, and directed to that of the patient by the mesmeric\npasses by which sleep was at first always induced.\nUnder the surprise produced by discoveries in electricity and magnetism,\nwhich happened to coincide in time with the first appearance of Mesmer,\nthis fluid received the name of Animal Magnetism, though it does not\nseem that any serious attempt was ever made to prove its relation to\nthe magnetism of the physical laboratory. Dr. Moll then sets himself\nto test this theory ; in other words, to find out whether the hypnotic influence\nis physical or psychical. The stress which advocates of animal magnetism\nhave laid on the phenomena of rapport, as proof of a peculiar connexion\nbetween agent and patient not explicable by mere suggestion, shows that\nit is here that the theory can be most successfully approached.\nRapport itself, however, on the most superficial inquiry, turns out to be\nby no means easy of clear conception. Like all else in the domain of\nhypnotism, it is a most Protean phenomenon, irregular alike in its appearance\nand in its symptoms. That it is frequently found in a most marked form is\nknown to every one who has seen the commonest experiments ; the hypno\ntised person is often, to all appearance, absolutely irresponsive to any stimulus,\nhowever violent, applied by any other than the original hypnotiser. But in\nmany other cases there is no sign of such rapport ; the person hypnotised\nmay be perfectly suggestible by anyone, and will answer anyone as well as\nthe operator. Between these two states there are an infinite number forming\na gradual transition. But for practical purposes Dr. Moll divides rapport\ninto two divisions : that where the subject does not ignore other persons,\nthough motor suggestions are accepted from the hypnotiser only ; and that\nwhere others are in no way recognised. The latter he speaks of as \" isolated\nrapport.\"\nBut his experiments show that even in this deeper stage the rapport is\nnot really isolated ; though no reaction to any ordinary stimulus is to be\np 2\n\f212 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\nseen, yet he proves in the most conclusive manner that the subject is really\nsensitive to the words and actions of others than the hypnotiser. To begin\nwith, he finds that rapport can be transferred without any suggestion on the\npart of the hypnotiser, even in the apparently deepest stage ; not indeed\nuniversally, for no general rules as to the behaviour of the hypnotised can be\nlaid down, but in a large number of cases. Transference can be obtained\nby repeated verbal suggestion from a third party, even if for a\nconsiderable time it seems to be ignored ; but a better method is continued\ntactile stimulus, especially such as is provided by mesmeric passes. The\ntransference can take place even while the hypnotiser engages the subject in\ncontinuous conversation, but then it is much slower than if the third person\nis left to engage his attention undisturbed.\nIt is not, however, to be concluded that there is, as the \"mesmerists\"\nwould have us believe, any special virtue in these passes. A whole series\nof experiments was directed to this point. Perhaps the most decisive\nwere those in which two persons hypnotised the subject simultaneously,\none by verbal suggestion, after the Nancy method, the other by passes.\nIn these cases it was impossible to say beforehand which of the two\noperators would obtain the rapport. Sometimes both did so, sometimes\nit was produced by the passes, sometimes by the simple suggestion. It\nmay be remarked in passing that neither Dr. Moll, nor I believe the French\nhypnotists, seem to have come across the disagreeable phenomena which\nwe have been accustomed to associate with \" cross mesmerism,\" though\nthey do not hesitate to place a subject under the influence of two operators\nin immediate succession, or even, as here, at the same time.\nGenerally speaking, rapport is to a great extent a matter of hypnotic\neducation. It is comparatively rare at a first sitting and increases afterwards.\nTransference of rapport is most easily obtained by those who have frequently\nhypnotised the subject previously. But it often appears in an apparently\narbitrary manner. For instance, Dessoir is mesmerising the subject while\nMoll is holding his hand in order to feel the pulse. When sleep has been\nproduced, it is found that Moll and not Dessoir has the rapport. Experi\nment 63 is an interesting one. \" X is put to sleep by Dessoir with mesmeric\npasses. Moll can get rapport by laying his hands for some time on X's\nhead ; so can others, who are present, by means of pressure on his forehead,\ntemples, or other parts of his body. X is now awakened and again sent to\nsleep by Dessoir, after the following experiment has been agreed on in\nanother room. Dessoir and Moll stand together behind X, who, as appears\non questioning, is in rapport with Dessoir alone. Dessoir lays his hands on\nX's head and at the same time Moll asks him how he feels. The question\nis immediately answered, though Moll has not touched X and had no rapport\nwith him before.\" Evidently X believed that Moll's hand was on his\nhead. So again in 65. \"X had on previous occasions been hypnotised\nby Moll for the sake of some electrical experiments in which he had\nto hold a large electrode. X is on this occasion in rapport with Dessoir\nalone, who has hypnotised him. Moll gives him the electrode to hold,\nthough without any current passing through it. He immediately comes into\nrapport with Moll, though he does not lose that which he previously had\nwith Dessoir.\" Here rapport is the result of association of ideas. Then\n\fSupplement.l 213\nNotices of Books.\nin 68. \" While Dessoir is standing in front of X, apparently with the\nintention of mesmerising him, X's eyes are bandaged. Sellin then silently\ntakes Dessoir's place, and makes the passes till X is asleep. It is then\nfound that Dessoir and not Sellin is in rapport with X. \" This is clearly\nmistaken self-suggestion.\nThese experiments, and many others like them, all point convincingly to\nthe conclusion that rapport is not a physical but a psychical phenomenon ;\nthat it is produced not by any action of an effluence from the operator,\nmagnetic or otherwise, but by the action of the subject's own mind,\nobedient to suggestions whether received externally or spontaneously\ngenerated. It is natural to conclude that rapport is no more than a con\ncentration of attention on the operator, an exaggerated case of the state of\nmind which in its different degrees we know in ordinary life as reverie,\nabstraction, \"absence of mind,\" and so on. This supposition is raised\nalmost to a certainty by a further series of most important experiments,\nwhich prove that even in a state of what seems to be completely isolated\nrapport the subject is still accessible to stimuli coming from other sources.\nThese stimuli are received and noted by the \" subconsciousness \" which\npersists in the hypnotic as well as in the waking state ; and by means of\nvarious artifices Dr. Moll has succeeded in demonstrating the fact. Perhaps\nthe most striking instance is that given in Experiment 100. \" Y is hypno\ntised and only answers the hypnotiser Dessoir. Moll can obtain no reply.\nMoll now gives the command, several times repeated : ' Y, in two minutes\nyou will rise from your chair ; an irresistible force will oblige you to go to\nthe door and knock at it ; you will then return to your place and go to sleep\nagain.' The command is executed. While Y is still talking to Dessoir he\nrises and does what he was told after about two minutes. When Dessoir asks\nwhat he has just done, he replies that he has got up from his chair. lie can\ngive no satisfactory answer to the question why he did so. Y still gives no\nreply to Moll's questions ; he is evidently in isolated rapport with Dessoir.\"\nThe analogy in this case to what is so often observed in the post-hypnotic\nexecution of commands is pointed out by Moll, and must indeed strike\nevery student. But it seems to show something more than Moll indicates ;\nnamely, that there is not a duplication but a triplication of personality to be\nobserved. In the ordinary rapport of hypnosis the self which is sub\nconscious to the normal self receives and carries out the command. Here\nit is a self which is subconscious to this subconscious self again. It is in\nfact analogous to the deeper stratum which was demonstrated by Gurney in\nhis well-known experiments on the trains of memory in different hypnotic\nstates. In this connexion it is well to mention Experiment 164. Here the\nsubject is consecutively hypnotised and awoke by four experimenters, each\nof whom suggests to him a different scene. Subsequently it appears that,\nwhen hypnotised by them again, he remembers only the scene which was\nsuggested to him by the operator with whom he is at the time in rapport.\nBut it is by means of automatic writing that Moll has been able to test\nmost conclusively this subconscious, or rather sub-subconscious state. It\nis only rarely that a suggestion given by a third party is carried out as in\nExperiment 100. But even when the subject shows no sign of recognising\nthe suggestion it can often be proved by automatic writing that he was not\n\f214 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\nentirely unconscious of it. Experiment 141 will serve as an instance, the\nmore instructively because the stimulus applied was not in the nature of an\nurgent command. X is in rapport with Dessoir. Moll takes from him a book\nwhich he is holding loosely in his hand and puts it behind a sofa in front of\nX. When Dessoir asks X about the book, he is astonished to miss it, and\nsupposes that it must have fallen out of his hand, but can say no more. He\nsearches for it without finding it ; he cannot think where it is, though urged\nto do so by Dessoir. When told to write automatically where the book is he\nwrites, while conversing with Dessoir, \" Dr. Moll took the book from me,\nand put it behind the sofa.\" It would be interesting to repeat these\nexperiments with crystal-seeing in place of automatic writing for the test.\nThe importance of the book for the study of hypnotism is obvious ; it is\nmost suggestive as well as cogent. For instance, it makes one think of a\nwhole series of experiments which should throw light on negative hallucina\ntions. In my own experience I have seen transference of rapport obtained\nwith a few passes by a person whose presence the subject absolutely ignored\nin obedience to a negative suggestion.\nDr. Moll's last chapter is devoted to matters such as the \" mesmerisation\nof objects. \" He tried to obtain mental suggestion ; but his results here were\nentirely negative. It is, however, gratifying to find that he does not\ntherefore conclude that the subject is unworthy of serious investigation. In\nthe mesmerisation of objects he found that the subject could by tasting tell\nout of a number of glasses of water the one which had been \"magnetised,\"\nwith a succoss far beyond chance ; but he gives good reason for supposing that\nthis was really done through a hyperaesthetic recognition of a taste which had\nbeen imparted by the manipulations used. It seems indeed highly probable\nthat the senses both of taste and smell can be by concentration of attention\nraised to a pitch of acuteness which requires very serious consideration in all\ninquiries such as these.\nWe have to thank not only Dr. Moll but his colleagues for a book\nremarkable for sobriety, acumen, and patient search for truth. The entire\nabsence of sensationalism and it must be confessed the dryness of the style\nare likely to rob it of much of the attention which it deserves to receive ; but\nthey cannot detract from its value as a scientific investigation.\nWalter Leaf.\nPtychUogie der Stiggestion.

Stuttgart : Enke, 1892,\npp. xii., 424.\nOne is always reluctant to begin a review of an obviously serious and able\nbook with a confession that one has been unable to understand it ; but it is\ncertain that, whether from my own inability to grasp so profound a subject\nas transcendental psychology, or possibly from some want of lucidity in the\nauthor's presentation of it, I have not succeeded in following his arguments\nwell enough to form an approximately clear idea of his position as a whole.\nHis main thesis, however, seems to be this. Modern psychology since\n\fSupplement.l 215\nNotices of Books.\nBerkeley has on the whole followed an entirely false track in regarding the\nPsyche as a tabula rasa, a purely receptive and passive organism, partly the\nproduct of heredity, but for the rest built up by the successive effects of\nsensations. It is on the contrary above all an assemblage of energies. All\npsychical phenomena are dynamic ; sensations, ideas, judgments, will, are\nalike in the fact that they have the power of mutual interaction, by which\nthey generate the infinite complex of the actual Psyche. Whether behind\nthese phenomena there is \"an X,\" a psychical energy in itself, is a further\nquestion, to which the author himself seems to have no hesitation in giving\nan affirmative answer. Association is no more than an expression of the\ninfluence which any psychical phenomenon has on any other phenomena\nnearly related to it.\nThe energy of psychical phenomena exhibits itself particularly in two\nways, on which all suggestion ultimately depends : in the persistence of\nideas and in the tendency of all ideas to external realisation of themselves.\nA further instance of this energy is to be found in the feelings of repulsion\nand attraction which the contents of ideas are able to cause us. These feel\nings are primary and not to be analysed. Psychical energies are like\ngunpowder, latent forces always ready to become active if a trigger is pulled.\nSuggestion is the pulling of the trigger.\nThe associative energy of ideas is continually tending to make groups.\nWhen any object of sensation affects the Psyche in such a way as to give\nsuch a temporary group disproportionate prominence, we have a suggestion.\nThe object in question may be an idea within the Psyche itself ; then we\nspeak of self-suggestion. Or the idea may be aroused by an external\ninanimate object ; in this case Schmidkunz calls it an object-suggestion. Or\nfinally it may be an idea impirted by another mind ; this is known as\nFremdstiggestion. In all cases, as a corresponding idea must be called up\nin the Psyche itself in order to affect its state of aggregation or disaggrega\ntion, auto-suggestion is at least an intermediate step. Still, the question\nwhether an individual is more accessible to internal or external suggestion is\none which leads to a marked division of mankind. At the extremes of the two\nclasses Gerster, Schmidkunz's colleague\u2014to whom, be it said, the book owes\na large number of pregnant and fertile thoughts\u2014sets two opposed phases of\nhysteria. The one class, whom he calls \" Hysteriker I.,\" are paycho-\nneurotically affected, and exhibit rapid and intense corporeal reaction to\nexternal suggestion ; such are Charcot's subjects. The other, \"Hysteriker II.,\"\nare psychopathic, subject to their auto-suggestions, but possessing thereby\nan almost complete immunity against external suggestion, and therefore not\nto be hypnotised.\nBut, for reasons which I have already stated, I shall not attempt to give\nany more extended review of the system as a whole, and will confine myself\nto a few points which may have especial interest to readers of the Proceedings.\nThey will probably be surprised to hear that Schmidkunz has little or nothing\nto say about the phenomena of automatism, and dismisses the subliminal self\nin a passing rejection of Max Dessoir's \"Doppel-ich\" as unsatisfactory. He\nwould apparently explain, e.g., automatic writing thus : The pencil placed\nin the hand acts as an \" object-suggestion \" which calls into being a certain\ntrain of associated ideas connected with writing, and having the innate\n\f216 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\ntendency to realise themselves. Their action being unchecked by the will,\nthey form themselves into a group dissociated from the rest of the mental\norganism, and may so far be regarded as a temporary second self that they\ncarry with them the related power of judgment, and thus are capable\nof showing a logical sequence of thought. But one would certainly have\nlooked for a fuller discussion of these phenomena.\nThought-transference, on the other hand, he says, has been amply proved\nby our Society. He is only disposed to question whether it needs proof at\nall ; whether on his dynamical theory it is not a matter of course, and its\nabsence is not the abnormality which needs to be established. The view is\nnot one which we in England are prepared to accept for working purposes ;\nbut the book contains a passage which is of such practical interest to\nus that I do not hesitate to translate it nearly in full. It is from a letter\nwritten to the author by Dr. Wetterstrand, of Stockholm, the eminent\nhypnotic practitioner.\n\" I have recently seen a striking instance of mental suggestion, and I no\nlonger have any doubt in the existence of direct thought-transference\nfrom one human being to another. I have at the present moment under\ntreatment a lady aged 33 who has slept for three weeks without intermission.\nBy fixed thought I can send her to sleep from my house and wake her up\nagain ; I can make her execute a prescribed movement, and when I ask her\nwhy she did so, she always replies, ' Because you will it.' I have made her\nget up in a state of sleep from her own room and come to mine, and when\nasked ' Why did you get up ? ' she answered, ' Because you will it.' For me\ndirect thought-transference is now a proved fact, which I have hitherto\ndoubted, but now have seen. ... If you know a good somnambule,\nlet him sleep for a week on end, and thought - transference gradually\ndevelops. This continued sleep, which I have now tried four times,\nparticularly in a case of morphinomania, which I have discussed in the Rerme\nde VHypnotisms for Nov., 1890 (Sur lt Traitement de la Morphinomanie par\nVHypnotism*), entails no danger. The patients eat and do everything as\nwell in the sleeping as in the waking state, and in many complaints such\nprolonged sleep has an extraordinary effect in restoration to health. I have\nrecently received a letter from my friend Dr. Ltebeault, of Nancy, in which\nhe says that he is in a position to prove, as he will do in the forthcoming\nsecond part of his work on Sleep and Analogous States, that there is a ' force\nneurique d'hommes a hommes.' How is this thought-transference to be\nexplained 1 \"\nDr. Wetterstrand's experiment has obvious difficulties ; will it not be\npossible to get over these and try it 1\nWalter Leaf.\nPer lo Spiritismo. 2a Edizione, Biveduta ed AmpliatA. Prof. Anqelo\nBrofferio. Milano : D. Briola, 1893, pp. 364.\nEusapia Palladino, the peasant woman of Naples, is having a deep and\ngrowing influence on thought in the Italian peninsula. The extraordinary\n\fSupplement.l 217\nNotices of Books.\nmanifestations which she produces as medium have been vouched for by\nnumerous observers of the highest standing, among them by no less men than\nLombroso and Schiaparelli, who, among other things, have seen a large article\n\u2022of furniture move through the room in full light without the contact of any\nhuman hand. Lombroso has avowed his full belief in the genuineness of the\nphenomena, and in the existence of an occult force which produces them.\nBut he has not admitted the Spiritist hypothesis, and goes no farther than\na psychic force exercised by the unconscious self of the medium.\nProfessor Brofferio, himself converted by what seems to have been a\ncareful series of experiments made with Eusapia, accepts heartily the full\ntheory of Spiritism and has joined issue with all its opponents. But, as he is\nconvinced of the facts and therefore sure that they will in the end have to be\nadmitted, it is chiefly with the interpretation of them that he deals. His\nbook is in the main an attack upon the psychic force school, in which he\nrecognises the most dangerous enemy of Spiritism. He has in fact written a\npopular counterpart to AksakofFs Animismus und tipiritismits (see Pro\nceedings, XVII., 665). In liveliness and to some extent in persuasiveness, he\nhas the advantage of Aksakoff, in spite of a somewhat excessive tendency\nto repetition. He has, too, a good knowledge of the literature of the subject,\nthough of course he cannot pretend to AksakofTs exhaustive acquaintance\nwith the evidence. And his obvious honesty and fairness are not one whit\nbehind those of his Russian leader. But in thoroughness and logical\nconsistency he stands rather below him than above. He has more of the\nclever advocate, and would doubtless have more chance of persuading a\njury ; but he has far less of the philosopher.\nIt is especially in his treatment of the unconscious self of the medium\n(Vincosciente del medio) that this weakness shows itself. The Italian phrase\nis neat and compact, but it has perhaps some tendency to mislead. In\nspite of the teaching of all recent inquiries, Brofferio still argues that the\nphenomena cannot be due to Vincosciente del medio because they contradict\nthe conscious wishes and convictions of the medium, or involve the exercise\nof a reasoning power which may even transcend that of which the normal\nmedium seems capable. Prof. Brofferio would have been less likely to fall\ninto an error such as this if he had been in the habit of thinking not so\nmuch of an unconscious as of a subconscious or subliminal self. By post\nhypnotic suggestion we have no difficulty in producing automatic writing\nprecisely such as Brofferio would have to be the work of the dead ; what\nreason is there to doubt that the same result may be obtained by the\nmedium's own self-suggestion ? Take, too, the case of apports, material\nobjects brought into a closed room, or created in one, where they did not\nexist before. Brofferio says that such a fact implies the existence of a\nknowledge and an art ; a knowledge whether of a fourth dimension of space,\nor of the constitution of the ether by which it can be formed into matter, or\nwhatever theory we may prefer ; and the art of making practical use of such\nknowledge. And, he says, it is extravagant to suppose that so exalted a\nskill can exist in the mind of the medium, entirely unknown to the normal\n\u2022consciousness. Surely all that we have learnt of automatism entitles us to\nsay that such a supposition is by no means absurd. It at least claims to be\nleft an open question. What man is there with so profound a knowledge of\n\f218 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\nphysiology that he can tell exactly how a blister on the skin is produced ?\nYet we have learnt that the subconsciousness is able to produce it. It\nfollows that in each of us there exists a knowledge of the processes of our\nown most subtle structure, and a power of commanding it, of which our\nnormal state has not the least inkling. Assuming that, on the facts as\nstated, some intelligence has a similar power over the ether, or whatever it may\nbe, why should not that intelligence exist within the brain of what we call\nthe medium, equally unsuspected in its capacities and processes f Indeed,\nBrofferio's arguments would lead to the conclusion, at which he himself\nseems to hint, that all automatism of an intelligent nature is the work of\nthe spirits of the dead ; for it all comes from some intelligence of which we\nare not conscious except in its results. He is in fact far too prone to argue\nthat the statement of the intelligence itself that it pertains to some dead\nperson is to be taken as a presumption of its own truth ; a line of reasoning\nin which I think few careful thinkers with the evidence before them will\ncare to follow him. And even though these communications do generally\nannounce themselves as coming from the dead, it must not be forgotten\nthat they do not always do so ; Professor Brofferio would do well to carefully\nstudy the evidence of Mrs. Newnham's planchette in Proceedings, VIII., 10.\nTheir general agreement is perfectly intelligible as auto-suggestion arising\nfrom the common tendency to believe in the return of the departed.\nBut, though I cannot follow Brofferio in all his arguments, I willingly\nacknowledge that, unlike many Spiritists, he takes eminently rational\nground. A controversy between him and Lombroso cannot fail to do much\nto attract general attention to the subject in Italy, whence we may hope for\nlarge contributions alike to the evidence and the theory of supernormal\nphenomena.

No. 1\u2014Janvier-Fevrier, 1893. Paris: Felix Alcan.\nDuring last autumn a Committee, amongst whom were M. Schiaparelli,\nDirector of the Astronomical Observatory at Milan, Professor Gerosa,\nProfessor Brofferio, and M. Aksakoff, held a series of sittings at Milan with\na \"physical medium,\" Mme. Eusapia Palladino, of that town. Professor\nLombroso and Professor C. Richet were present at some of the meetings,\nand a statement by the latter of his own observations is published together\nwith the formal report of the Committee in the Jan.-Feb. number of\nthe Annates des Sciences Psychiques. The phenomena observed were of a\nkind familiar to all students of Spiritualistic literature : tilting and levita-\ntion of tables and other movements of furniture ; alteration of the weight\nof the medium in the balance ; raps ; and the appearance and contact of hands\nin the dark, or in semi-obscurity. That the reports now under discussion\ndeserve more respectful consideration than the innumerable accounts of\nsimilar manifestations which have appeared in overwhelming abundance\n\fSupplement.l 219\nNotices of Books.\nduring the last 40 years, is due not so much to the fact (though that is\nentitled to some weight) that the medium has not been detected in fraud, as\nto the high scientific standing of the witnesses, and the obvious care and\nfreedom from prepossession with which their observations have for the most\npart been made and recorded.\nThe most striking phenomena, and those which presented, apparently,\nthe best opportunity for excluding fraud, since they took place in full light,\nwere the levitation of the table, and the alteration of the medium's weight in\nthe balance. The table was a common kitchen-table, with four legs, 3 ft. 8 in.\nlong, by 2 ft. 4 in. wide, and weighing about 17 lb. Professor Richet,\nwho has witnessed the levitation of the table on several occasions, describes\nit as follows : \" Eusapia, seated at one end of the table, gave her right hand\nto one of the investigators, and her left hand to another. Usually in the\nexperiments at which I assisted, M. Schiaparelli held her right hand, and I\nheld her left. The other persons stood more or less aloof, so that the two\ntable legs at the end farthest from Eusapia could be seen, and the two at her\nend of the table, and between which she had placed her legs, knees and feet,\nwere visible all, or almost all, the time.\n\"After various movements, during which there were partial liftings, now of\none foot, now of another, the table was suddenly lifted up, all four feet being\nraised slightly from the ground, from about 3 to 5 inches. But in several\ninstances (when there was little or no light) it seemed to me that the table\nlegs were lifted off the ground to a height of from 8 to 10 inches. This only\nlasted for a short time, difficult to estimate, but which I take to have been\nabout one or two seconds. Nevertheless, on one occasion, at the second\nseance, the table appeared to me to be raised from the ground for about 3\nseconds, with a sort of swaying, rocking motion in the air. The room was\nlighted during the experiments.\"\nThe light in some cases was sufficiently good to allow of photographs\nbeing taken. A copy of one photograph, appended to Professor Richet's\narticle, shows the table suspended horizontally some inches above the floor,\nwhilst Eusapia's hands were held, on the surface of the table, by Professors\nRichet and Lombroso respectively, the former having his other hand pressed\non the medium's knees, and his left foot in contact with one of her feet.\nTwo other members of the Committee were watching the proceedings at a\nlittle distance from the table.\nIn discussing the possible mechanical explanations of the movement,\nProfessor Richet adduces strong arguments for concluding that it could not\nhave been lifted by any mechanism, or by the knees or hands of the medium.\nThere remains the hypothesis that the movement was effected by the feet\u2014or\none foot, placed under one of the legs, and aided by the pressure of the\nhands on the top of the table. That this is extremely improbable is\nshown by several considerations. One or other of the experimenters on\nseveral occasions held his hand on the medium's knees during the experiment,\nbut no movement of them was observed ; one foot of the sitter on either\nside was, as he in each case believed, in contact with one foot of the medium ;\nand had Eusapia's foot been placed under a leg of the table, the table could\nonly have been raised altogether from the floor by the exercise of consider\nable pressure above the table ; and whilst no indication was observed of any\n\f220 [Supplement.\nNotices of BooJcs.\nsuch pressure being exerted, the Committee add that they were unable to\ncredit Eusapia with the possession of the muscular force required. On the other\nhand it is pointed out that the levitation of the table appears to have been\ngenerally preceded by a puffing out (gonfler) of Eusapia's dress until it\ntouched and partially covered one foot of the table ; and that when contact\nof the dress with the table was prevented the experiment failed. Further,\nthe experiment also failed when Eusapia and the experimenters stood upright ;\nand she refused to try the experiment sitting at one of the longer sides of\nthe table, or with a pasteboard screen placed round her dress so as absolutely\nto cut off all possibility of contact with the table. Professor Richet, there\nfore, with characteristic scrupulousness sums up :\u2014\n\"The hypothesis that Eusapia lifted the table with her feet is not\nabsurd, and perhaps however improbable such an hypothesis may seem we\nshould accept it sooner than the absurdity of a table lifted without mechanical\nforce. Indeed, in no case have I seen the four feet of the table all raised\nfrom the ground, when both Eusapia's feet were so placed as to render\ndeception impossible, or when the four feet of the table could be seen\ndistinctly free from contact with Eusapia's feet.\"\nThe Committee, it should be added, attempted to perform the feat of\nraising the table from the ground under the conditions imposed upon\nEusapia, and failed to do so.\nThe experiment in which the weight of the medium in a balance presented\nunaccountable variations exhibits, unfortunately, precisely analogous defects.\nThe weight on several occasions was observed gradually to increase or diminish\n\u2014the variation in one instance being as much as 21 lb. on either side of the\nnormal weight. One occasion is thus described by Professor Richet :\u2014\n\"Eusapia, seated on a chair, was placed on the platform of a weighing\nmachine and her feet were strongly bound together by a handkerchief. One\nof us, M. Finzi, was told off to read the weight. M. Schiaparelli and I\nemployed ourselves in watching closely the balance and its surroundings, so\nas to be sure that Eusapia did not touch with hand or foot the ground or\nany object in the neighbourhood.\n\"Her weight with the chair being 58 kilogrammes (nearly 128 lb. or over\n9 stone), we placed on the scale 500 grammes at a point where it would be\nequivalent to 50 kilogrammes, and then the rider was placed at the figure 8.\nEusapia's weight was thus exactly balanced. Then, though Eusapia did not\nmove her chair, we had, in order to maintain equilibrium, to shift the rider,\nfirst to 6, then to 4, then to 2, and finally to zero, and further, to obtain\nexact equilibrium it would have been necessary to take away a little of the\nweight of 500 grammes which represented 50 kilogrammes. It will be seen,\ntherefore, that Eusapia diminished her weight in this experiment by at least\n8 kilogrammes (17\u00a3 lb.). We are certain that she threw nothing away (if\nshe had thrown anything away she would have had to recover it in order to\nrestore her original weight), and equally certain that she derived no support\nfrom any neighbouring object. And finally, the movement was sufficiently\nslow\u2014it occupied from 12 to 20 seconds\u2014to make it impossible to attribute\nit to a jump or quick movement of any kind. Nevertheless, the observation\ndid not appear to us conclusive. In brief, in the ordinary weighing machine,\nconstructed on the principle of the steelyard, the weight varies (although it\n\fSupplement.l 221\nNotices of Books.\nis true within very narrow limits) with the position of the centre of gravity.\nBy changing his position on the platform, especially when, as was the case\nhere, the machine is not a very good one, the person who is being weighed\ncan appreciably vary his weight.\n'' We devised accordingly a weighing machine of a different kind, in which\nthe platform was suspended by the four corners. In this machine the\nweight would show no variation, whatever the position of the sitter on the\nplatform. An automatic arrangement devised by M. Finzi registered the\nmovements of the lever. In the fifth sitting we obtained a result which was\ncertainly remarkable, seeing that it occurred under exceptionally good\nconditions. M. Schiaparelli and I were watching the machine both above\nand below, so as to be sure that Eusapia did not touch either the ground, or\nthe support from which the platform was hung.\n\"Under these conditions, there was certainly a slight upward movement of\nthe platform, but it was very trifling ; and although the automatic register\nindicated a marked diminution in the weight, lasting for about 15 seconds, I\ncannot say for certain that this movement of the register did not occur at the\nmoment when Eusapia, in order to gain more strength, asked one of the\ninvestigators to give her his hand, which she held for a short time before\nrelinquishing.\"\nThe Committee, however, point out that this experiment succeeded only\nwhen part of Eusapia's dress touched the floor, and that when precautions\nwere taken to prevent this contact no appreciable effect was produced\non the balance. On one occasion, indeed, when the balance was placed\nat a distance of more than 10 inches behind Eusapia, and her hands, feet, and\nknees were held, a rider, apparently in response to an energetic movement\non the part of Eusapia, oscillated violently on the beam, as if some weight\nhad been thrown into the scale. But this effect was never repeated. The\nobserved alteration in the weight of the medium, was, of course, far too\ngreat to be accounted for by the mere contact of part of her dress with the\nfloor ; but so long as this and other sources of error cannot be eliminated,\nthe evidence for some new physical force must, as Professor Richet points\nout, be considered incomplete.\nOther phenomena\u2014tilting of the table on two legs, lateral movements of\nthe table when the hands of the medium were not in direct contact with it,\nmovement of chairs, raps and noises of various kinds\u2014occurred also in the\nlight ; but in no instance were the conditions more favourable or the evidence\nmore complete than in the experiments above described.\nManifestations of various kinds occurred when the room was darkened or\npartially darkened, each person holding the hand of his neighbour, so as to\nform a chain. But here, again to quote Professor Richet :\u2014\n\" During the experiments Eusapia generally has the right and the left hand\nheld differently. On one side her whole hand is firmly held ; on the other\nside, instead of having her hand held by the person next her, she merely\nplaces her hand on his, but touches his hand with all five fingers, so that he\ncan feel quite distinctly whether it is the right or the left hand with which\nhe is in contact.\n\" This is what follows : At the moment when the manifestations are about\nto begin, the hand which is not being held, but which is lightly placed on\n\f222 (Supplement.\nNotices of Boolcs.\nthe hand of the person on that side (for the sake of simplicity we will\nsuppose that it is Eusapia's right hand, though it is in fact sometimes the\nright, sometimes the left), the right hand, then, becomes very unsteady,\nand begins to move about so rapidly that it is impossible to follow its move\nments ; it shifts about every moment, and for the mere fraction of a second\nit is not felt at all ; then it is felt again, and one could swear it is still the\nright hand.\"\nRecords of phenomena occurring under such conditions can hardly be\nthought to add much strength to the evidence already obtained, even though\nthey included such feats as the lifting of Eusapia and her chair bodily on to\nthe table ; the touching of those present with a hand which in some cases\nappeared larger than the hand of the medium ; the appearance of ftro hands\nagainst the faintly luminous background of the window ; the discovery of\nfinger marks on paper previously prepared with lamp-black, though the hands\nof the medium at the end of the sitting were found to be perfectly clean ;\nand the removal of M. Schiaparelli's spectacles, performed in complete\ndarkness, and with such care that he was unconscious of his loss until the\noperation was actually completed.\nIn a further set of experiments, however, it seems clear that the effects\nproduced were beyond the unaided resources of the medium. A portion of\nthe room was curtained off from the rest, and the medium placed in the\naperture of the curtains, which were joined a little above her head. The space\ncurtained off was left in absolute darkness, but the rest of the room was\ndimly lighted by a lantern with red glass sides, placed on the table round\nwhich sat the medium and the experimenters. On one occasion Professor\nRichet himself took up his station in the darkened part of the room, behind\nthe curtains, his chair placed back to back with that on which Eusapia sat.\nThe medium's hands were held on either side by M. Schiaparelli and M.\nFinzi, and the latter's stocking-clad foot was placed between the two booted\nfeet of Eusapia. Under these circumstances M. Richet was touched three\ntimes on various parts of the body. Then, he writes,\n\" At one moment she became rigid and said, ' Hold me tight, hold me tight,'\nupon which M. Schiaparelli on one side and M. Finzi on the other held her\nwith all their strength. M. Gerosa took notes. I said to M. Finzi : ' Are\nyou holding her left hand?' He replied, 'Yes.' I then asked M.\nSchiaparelli, ' Are you holding her right hand 1 ' He replied, ' Yes. ' Then\nI again asked M. Finzi, 'Are you holding both her feet?' He replied,\n' Yes.' Then on turning my head slightly to the left I saw something was\npreparing, by the fact that the curtain was bulging and seemed to be\napproaching Eusapia, as though to make the shadow deeper. Then I was\ntouched on the right shoulder by a hand which seemed to me to be a right\nhand (supposing it belonged to the medium). Almost at the same instant,\nafter Eusapia had asked me to put my head near hers, I was touched by two\nfingers, which pulled with some force, but without hurting me, the hair on\nthe nape of my neck ; I was certain it was a hand which touched my shoulder\nand neck. At the same time M. Finzi was touched on the ear, on the fore\nhead and on the temples by fingers which were behind the curtain, while thu\nhand which touched me was free from the curtain. M. Finzi was touched\nthree times. The other witnesses observed no abnormal movement on\n\fSupplement.l 223\nNotices of Books.\nEusapia's part. I, who was behind her, felt nothing but a sort of general\nconvulsion, and that at the moment when we were watching most attentively,\nand when M. Schiaparelli on one side and M. Finzi on the other held\nEusapia's hands firmly, and could distinguish which hand they held, right or\nleft. This experiment seemed thoroughly satisfactory, and I hardly\nsee how one could take exception to it. M. Schiaparelli did not let go\nEusapia's right hand ; on the other side M. Finzi could not let go her left\nhand ; for he had put his fingers in the copper wire which surrounded the\nfingers of Eusapia's left hand. Even supposing, what is difficult to suppose,\nthat M. Schiaparelli had let go Eusapia's hand, it is almost impossible that\nthat hand, even if free, could reach and touch M. Finzi, after passing behind\nthe curtain\u2014for I had my back almost touching Eusapia's, and the compli\ncated movement which she would have had to make to carry her hand behind\nwas rendered almost, or rather, quite impossible. On the other hand it\nseemed impossible for Eusapia to stretch out her hand in front, for the\nshadow was not deep enough to prevent those present from seeing this move\nment had it been attempted, and besides M. Finzi was touched on the face,\nthrough the thickness of the curtain. This is the experiment which seems to\nme to offer the strongest proof of the materialisation of a hand. For unless\nwe suppose\u2014which is of course admissible\u2014a serious experimental error on\nthe part of M. Schiaparelli, M. Finzi or myself, one cannot see how it was\npossible for Eusapia's hand to touch us under the conditions described.\"\nOn other occasions, with all the experimenters in front of the curtain,\nthe medium being seated as before, in the opening of the curtains, and her\nhands and feet held, hands were felt by each person in turn through the\nopening of the curtains just above the medium's head, and afterwards a hand\nwas seen by all simultaneously in the same place. Bluish lights were also\nseen in the same place, and a pencil was taken from the hand of one of the\nCommittee, and afterwards thrown back through the opening. To quote the\nCommittee's report :\u2014\n\" It is impossible to count the number of times that that hand appeared\nand was touched by one of us ; suffice it to say that doubt was no longer\npossible ; it was indeed a living, human hand which we saw and touched,\nwhile at the same time the bust and arms of the medium remained visible\nand her hands were held by those on either side of her.\"\nFinally, some wet clay which had been placed in the dark alcove was\nfound at the termination of the sitting to bear the imprint of a hand.\nThe whole series of experiments, it should be noted, took place in the\napartments of Dr. Finzi. The Committee do not apparently hold the\nquestion of a possible accomplice entering the room after the commencement\nof the sitting as worth considering, for they say nothing about the existence\nof a door in the darkened alcove, or the precautions taken to keep it closed.\nFrom Professor Richet, however, we learn that there was such a door, and\nthat it was locked and sealed during the progress of the experiments. He\nadds : \" It is absurd to suppose that another person could have come into the\nroom, which is small, and was completely shut up. It was in M. Finzi's apart\nments, we were making no noise, we could light up the room instantly,\nindeed there was light enough, as it was, to see its general appearance,\n&c., &c.\"\n\f224 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\nIt will be seen from this brief survey that the experiments presented many\nsuspicious features. The results in every case can be paralleled more or less-\nexactly by results produced through the agency of persons who have been\ndetected in fraud. Moreover, there were many circumstances which either\ndirectly suggested fraud, or oifered facilities for its intervention. Such are the\ndarkness that was found essential for so many of the experiments ; the\nmovements of Eusapia's dress in the table and balance experiments ; the\ntwitchings and convulsive movements of her hands and her whole body ;\nher groanings when exciting phenomena were taking place in the dark ; her\nrefusal on more than one occasion to accept conditions wchih would have\nrendered fraud more difficult, and the failure of the experiment when any\nsuch conditions were accepted and imposed. In Professor Richet's words ::\n\"The results degenerated as the conditions were made more stringent.\"\nIn short, seeing that Eusapia had practically an unlimited right of veto,\ndirect or indirect, upon the conditions, it is not accurate to speak of the re\nsults recorded by the Committee as experivieiUal. The Committee did not and\ncould not experiment ; they were permitted to observe certain phenomena\nproduced in presence of the medium under conditions chosen by herself\u2014\nconditions which the Committee and M. Richet (as they are themselves\ncareful to point out) were unable to vary in any material point. That even\nso the effects produced were such as can only be ascribed to trickery by means\nof several violent and improbable hypotheses will readily be admitted. But\nin all cases, it will be observed, the question between fraud and a new physical\nforce was only a quantitative one. It was a question in each case whether\nEusapia was strong enough, or quick enough, or clever enough, to have pro\nduced the whole of the effect observed. In no case was an effect produced\nwhich was measurably and indisputably beyond the power of any human\nbeing in the circumstances described. That after saying so much, we should\nadmit that the things done remain inexplicable is the strongest tribute that\ncan be paid to the skill and patience of the investigators. For in this\nadmission is implied that we have no ground here for assuming\u2014what\nexperience has shown that we are justified in assuming in most records\nof similar phenomena\u2014serious errors of observation and description on the\npart of the investigators. Two precautions, indeed, it may be suggested,\nwould not be superfluous on any future occasion : First, that the person of\nEusapia should be searched immediately before each sitting ; and second,\nthat when the room is darkened the doors and windows should be guarded\nfrom the outside. If the same phenomena could be reproduced under\nthese conditions, the difficulty of attributing the results to fraud would be\ngreatly increased ; if compliance with the conditions were refused, or if the\nphenomena ceased with their adoption, the argument for a new force would\nbe correspondingly weakened.\nThe Committee, it should be added, express their conviction that the\nresults obtained in the light, and many of those obtained in darkness, could\nnot have been produced by trickery of any kind. M. Richet, who does not\nsign the Committee's report, states his own conclusions more cautiously as\nfollows : \" Absurd and unsatisfactory though they were, it seems to me very\ndifficult to attribute the phenomena produced to deception, conscious or\nunconscious, or to a series of deceptions.

Podmoeb.\nSpiritismo e Telepatia. Note critiche e osservazione del Professors\nAugusto Tamburini, Rivista Sperimentale di Freniatria e di\nMedicina Legale. Vol. XVIII. Fasc. II. August, 1892.\nProfessor Tamburini, at the beginning of his interesting article, remarks\nupon the growing attention paid in Italy to the examination of those\nphenomena which may be described generally as Spiritualistic and Tele\npathic. Members of the Society for Psychical Research will welcome all\naccessions to the company of unprejudiced inquirers into these phenomena ;\nmore particularly when distinguished scientific attainments and high position\nin the medical profession give special weight to the opinions which those\ninquirers form. Professor Lombroso has long been known as a bold and\ningenious pioneer in many branches of Psychical Research ; and several\nother distinguished men of science in Italy have turned their energies in\nsimilar directions. Professor Tamburini is a noteworthy addition to the\nnumber.\nBut besides the special value which attaches to the attitude of men of\nscientific distinction, there are two general reasons why the extension of\npsychical inquiries in Italy seems to be of special importance. In the first\nplace, there is some reason to think that, whether from national tempera\nment, climate, or other cause, the Southern branches of the Latin race\nafford a specially good field for observation of psychical phenomena ; and in\nthe second place, religious orthodoxy and scientific orthodoxy are perhaps\nmore intolerant in Italy than in most other European countries. For this\nreason more courage is required for embarking upon a course of inquiry\nwhich is obnoxious to the Church, and is regarded with some suspicion by\nmen of the orthodox scientific school ; and the difficulty to be overcome\nmeasures the strength of the interest felt by those who overcome it.\nThe object of Professor Tamburini's article is mainly to give information as\nto the present position of the inquiries into some of the less obscure psychical\nproblems, in view of recent publications on the subject. Besides giving a\ngeneral view of the questions of which he treats, he contributes two cases of\ntelepathy which have come under his own notice. To these we shall return\nlater, after giving some general account of the views expressed in the\narticle.\nThe article is divided into two parts\u2014the first dealing with Spiritualism,\nthe second with Telepathy.\n1. Spiritualism.\nThe writer attaches great importance to the close examination of the\ncondition, mental and physical, of mediums. He calls attention to the\nconclusion of Janet that the mediums belong to the neuropathic class, and\nare generally characterised by hysteria, somnambulism, sensibility to\nhypnotism, or, in the most marked cases, hysteria combined with\nhemianp?sthesia. Professor Tamburini regrets that more care has not been\n\f22G [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\ngiven to observations upon these points ; and from the medical point of view\nno doubt such observations may be of the greatest value. The investigators\nof the phenomena produced cannot afford to neglect the study of any of the\nconditions under which they take place ; but at the same time a doubt\nmay be permitted as to whether, with some investigators, pathological\nproblems have not to some extent obscured the question which for the\npresent is more important\u2014namely, the question of what phenomena are\nproduced.\nWith regard to the phenomena, Professor Tamburini deals first with\nTable Tilting and Automatic Writing. He accepts the verdict of all\ncompetent observers that imposture is inadmissible as a general explanation,\nand endorses the view that the muscular action which causes the movements\nof the table or the pencil is produced by the subliminal consciousness. The\nsubdivision of personality, and the intelligent action of the subliminal\nconsciousness are fully accepted by the writer. He explains the definite and\nvarying characters of the supposed authors of the messages as the result of\nself-suggestion. As by hypnotic or post-hypnotic suggestion a subject may\nbe made to think he is Napoleon or a chimney-sweep, so by self-suggestion\nthe subliminal consciousness may be made to think that it is X or Y, and to\ntilt or rap messages in the character of X or Y.\nProfessor Tamburini, as we have said, is mainly interested in the\nmodifications of normal mental action in connection with which spirit\nrapping and automatic writing are produced, and does not discuss the\ncontent of the messages so given. This is the point of the investigation\nwhich has had the greatest interest for most English investigators. The\nquestion which they ask is whether the messages are such as to show\nknowledge on the part of the medium which could not have been acquired\nby the ordinary channels of communication ; and further, if it can be estab\nlished that such information has reached the medium by means not hitherto\nrecognised as normal, viz., without the intervention of the senses, is there\nany evidence that in any cases it is derived from intelligences other than\nembodied human intelligences ? Upon the first of these questions Professor\nTamburini touches to a certain extent, in the later part of the article, which\ndeals with telepathy ; but he does not extend his open-mindedness so far as\nto admit the possibility of the Spiritualistic hypothesis. He commends\no(>enness of mind for the reception of all evidence, and quotes with approval\nProfessor Lodge's statement that \" it is no proof of wisdom to refuse to\nexamine certain phenomena because we think it certain that they are im\npossible, as if our knowledge of tho universe were already complete. \" He\nmaintains the attitude of mind so indicated with the greatest consistency and\nfrankness\u2014but only up to a certain point. He has nothing but contempt for\nthose who accept a Spiritualistic explanation of the phenomena in question\n\u2014not because he considers such an explanation disproved, but because he\nthinks it so impossible and retrograde as not to require consideration.\nWith regard to \" Physical Phenomena \" his attitude is somewhat more\ncautious than that of Professor Lombroso. He does not consider that the\nevidence obtained by Crookes, or by the Neapolitan experiments with\nEusapia Palladino as medium\u2014experiments in which he himself took a part.\u2014\ngives conclusive proof of the production or transmission of force in modes\n\fSupplement. 227\nNotices of Books.\nother than those known to science. At the same time he fully admits that\nthere is strong evidence pointing in this direction ; and is prepared to grant\nthe possibility, or even the probability, of Lombroso's view that cerebral\nmovements may be transmitted by means of the \"ether \"to surrounding\nobjects, and act upon them as force, without the intervention of muscular\naction.\n2. Telepathy.\nThe second part of the article deals with Telepathy. Professor\nTamburini's verdict with regard to experimental telepathy is \"not proven.\"\nHe then turns to that part of the evidence which depends upon observation,\nnot experiment ; and, after paying tribute to the care, perseverance, and\nscientific rigour with which the telepathic cases of Phantasms of the Living\nhave been collected and investigated, he proceeds to classify and analyse\nthem, and finally to give his conclusion as to the inferences to be drawn from\nthis mass of evidence. There are three possible explanations, he says, of the\nlarge number of well-attested instances of coincidental hallucinations.\n(1) They may be fortuitous coincidences ; (2) they may be illusions of\nmemory, by which, after the event is known, the subject believes himself to\nhave had impressions which he did not really have ; or*(3) they may be\nreally telepathic. With regard to (1) he does not follow the authors of\nPhantasms of the Living into their calculations of probability, but he\nconcludes, on general grounds, that fortuitous coincidence is extremely\nimprobable. With regard to (2) he justly points out that this does not\napply to the considerable number of cases in which there is evidence that the\nimpression was recorded by the percipient, or communicated to others before\nthe coincident event was known. There remains, therefore, only the third\nalternative ; but upon this Professor Tamburini's final conclusion is cautious.\nHe considers that \" all the facts collected, however conscientiously weighed\nand checked, cannot be held sufficient at present to constitute a scientific\nand unshaken proof of telepathic phenomena. They seem only so far serious\nand worthy of consideration as to propound a problem, to the solution of\nwhich further research and observation can alone contribute.\"1\nIt is of great interest to know the deliberate judgment of a highly\ncompetent person upon the evidence collected thus far. Some members of the\nSociety for Psychical Research will no doubt think that Professor Tamburini\ninclines too much to the side of caution ; but this, if a fault, is a fault on the\nright side. And the result may at least be welcomed\u2014that Professor\nTamburini has himself set about the collection of further evidence, and\n1 Professor Tamburini suggests that \" telaesthetic \" would be a more appropriate\nword than \" telepathic,\" on the ground that thought-transference is compatible with\nperfect health, and that \"telepatAi'c\" suggests that the percipient's condition is\n\" pathological,\" or in other words unhealthy. Without discussing the correctness of\nthis limited use of the word pathological, we may reply that telepathy was not\nintended to convey, and need not convey, any suggestion of morbidity. It means no\nmore than \"action at a distance,\" or more strictly, \"the being acted upon at a\ndistance.\" It is to be preferred to \" telaesthesia \" as the more general word ; for\nit includes purely mental impressions as well as sensory impressions ; while\n\" teltesthesia \" would properly exclude the former, which, as Professor Tamburini\nrecognises, constitute an important class.\nQ 2\n\f22H (.Supplement.\nNotice's of Books.\ninvites others to do so also. Two cases are presented in the article under\nreview ; and in the succeeding number of the KirisUi di Freniatria\n(Vol. XIX., Fasc. I.) Dr. Giacchi communicates three cases and Dr.\nBracaloni another.\nThe two cases which Professor Tamburini gives are as follows :\u2014\n1. Virginia Guicciardi, wife of the head doctor of the Lunatic Asylum at\nReggio, had a veridical dream on the night of April 25th-26th, 1892. The\ndream was told to her husband in the morning, before the event to which it\nrelated was known. The story is best told in the words of the percipient and\nher husband. It is not stated when these accounts were written, but as the\nnumber of the periodical in which they appear was published in August,\n1892, it cannot have been long after the event.\nProfessor Tamburini states that the Signora Guicciardi is cultivated and\nstudious, a writer of distinction, of quick and impressionable temperament,\nbut not generally subject to terrifying dreams. She has never had any other\nremarkable experiences of a telepathic character ; but she has often observed\nherself thinking of a person, or having his image present in her mind,\nshortly before his unexpected arrival.\nAccount by the Siytwra Guicciardi.\n\" On the evening of April 25th last I went to sleep quietly, without\nthinking of my sick friend [Signorina G., of Modena], About halfway through\nthe night I woke up with a start, thinking I heard my name called. Before\nI had become quite clearly conscious I got out of bed, and, as though afraid\nof an unknown danger, I ran into the next room, where my husband\nwas sleeping. When he had assured me that neither he nor anyone\nelse could have called me, I immediately went back to bed, was quite calm,\nand soon went to sleep again. Later, I had the dream, in ,vhich I saw my\nfriend on the point of death,\u2014a dream which was extremely clear in detail,\nand which produced so strong an impression on me as to engrave itself\nindelibly on my memory. When I woke up it might be half-past six\nor seven in the morning\u2014judging by the light which penetrated the closed\nwindows, for I did not look at the clock. I remained for a time in an\nuncomfortable, half-awake condition, and fixed my mind upon the scenes of\nmy sad dream. I seemed to see my young friend stretched out upon her l>ed,\nhaving on her face the terrible expression of the death-struggle. Her sisters\nwere standing round her, and I looked at her from a little way off. Suddenly\nI could not bear the sight of her eyes, of which the white alone was visible,\nand I retired to the window, and leant my forehead against the panes. Then\nI heard them say in low voices, 'She is going; she is dying now.' Mean\nwhile my heart beat as though it would break.\n\"In the morning, when I told my husband these experiences, I was moro\nimpressed by the terror I had felt than by the belief that the dream might\nprove true. In fact, the news conveyed by the telegram which my husband\ngave me after I had told him about the dream was unexpected.\n\" That same day at Modena I received from the family the curious and\nsad intelligence which is connected with my dream.\n\"Virginia Guicciaiidi.\"\n\fSupplement.l 229\nXoticets of Books.\nAccount bij Dr. Gnicriindi.\n\" On the morning of April 26th last I went into my wife's bedroom about\neight, and found her awake and rather disturbed in mind. She immediately\nbegan to tell me the dream which she had had about two hours before (with\nall the particulars, as I remember precisely, which are related above).\nWhile she was speaking the maid came in, and, turning to mo, said,\n' C (a man who works for the asylum) ' is below, and wishes to speak to you.'\nI replied that I would come down directly, and went on listening to the\nstory, which my wife, who was still vividly impressed, resumed as soon as\nthe maid had gone away. I laughed a little, and when she had finished\nadvised her not to think of it. We talked a little of other things, and then\nI left her.\n\"On the ground floor I found C, who gave me a telegram, which the\ntelegraphist of the asylum had given to him, with directions to deliver it\ninto my hands alone. Before that he had not told the maid, or anyone else\nin my house, that he was the bearer of a private telegram. The day before\n\u2014and I remember this very well\u2014there had been no talk in tho family\nabout the lady who was ill. We were certainly far from imagining that her\nend would be so sudden ; for the day before that we had received a postcard\nfrom the sister of the sick lady, telling us that there was a comparative but\ndistinct improvement in her condition.\n\"Dorr. Giuseppe Guiooiardi.\"\nThe story was told to Professor Tamburini on the very morning on which\nthe events took place, both by Dr. Guicciardi and by his wife, before tho\nlatter went to Modena to see the family of Signorina G. She went to Modena\nthe same day, and learnt that the death had taken place unexpectedly, about\nsix o'clock in the morning ; that in the course of the night the Signorina G.\nh;id begged her sisters, who were nursing her, to write to her friend to come\n\" if she wished to see her again \" ; and further, that shortly before her death\nshe had named Dr. Guicciardi, and said that she thought she saw him behind\na screen which was in the room.\nIt will be noted that in this case the dream was told to one person\nbefore the fact of the death was known to the dreamer, and that it was,\nfurther, told to Professor Tamburini before the details of the death and tho\nfact that the dying person's thoughts had been directed to Dr. Guicciardi\nand his wife in the course of the night were known.\nThe evidence, however, might have been made more complete in some\nparticulars. It would be desirable to have a statement from the sisters of\nSignorina G. It would be interesting to know how far the details given by\nSignora Guicciardi as to the appearance, &c., of the dying person seen in her\ndream corresponded with reality. The statements given should bear dates.\n2. Nice Rossi, a lunatic in the asylum at Reggio, died on May 21st,\n1892, at 11 a.m. She had been in the asylum since December 20th, 1890,\nand had previously been from time to time in another asylum. No inquiries\nabout her had been received from her family for more than a year, but on\nthe morning of May 23rd a postcard arrived from Mantua, from her husband,\nGiovanni Berni, dated May 22nd, and asking for information as to his wife's\ncondition. On inquiry through a doctor at Mantua, it appeared that on the\n\f230 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\nday before writing, i.e., on the day of his wife's death, he had felt \" uneasy,\nas though some misfortune were going to befall him,\" and that it was in\nconsequence of this feeling that he had determined to write.\nAgainst the vagueness of the impression in this case may be set off the\nfact that it prompted Berni to a definite action ; but the coincidence does\nnot seem sufficiently exact or striking to exclude the likelihood of its being\ndue to chance.\nDr. Oscar Giacchi, of Racconigi, communicates three telepathic cases in\nthe Rirista, Vol. XIX., Fasc. I.\n1. The first is an experience of his own. In 1853, when a student at\nPisa, he saw in a dream, or when half awake, his father, apparently dying.\nThe figure spoke to him, and he kissed its lips. Although he had no previous\ncause for anxiety, he went at once to Florence, where his father was, and\nfound that he had died suddenly of heart disease.\nThis experience was not, apparently, recorded at the time, and no\nconfirmatory evidence is given.\n2. An old woman, for three years an inmate of the Racconigi Asylum,\nhad, before she was shut up there, received kindness from the parish priest\nof San Giovanni di Racconigi. She usually slept quietly at night ; but at\nmidnight on the night of November 18th, 1892, she began to howl and\ndisturb the whole ward. She told the nurses, who tried to calm her, that\nshe had \" seen the Prior fall to the ground, with bloody foam coming from\nhis mouth, and die in a few moments.\" The morning's report to the doctor\nrelated this occurrence ; and at the same time it became known that the\npriest in question had died of an apoplectic stroke at the time of the dream.\nHere again confirmatory evidence is wanting ; and it is not stated\nwhether the \" medical report \" exists, and whether it contains particulars of\nthe words used by the woman.\n3. Dr. Giacchi's third case is similar to Professor Tamburini's second.\nThe wife of a patient in the asylum wrote to inquire for news of him just at\nthe time of his death. But the coincidence in this case is less striking, as\nthe patient had only been in the asylum for two months.\nFinally, a case is communicated by Dr. Bracaloni, in the same number of\nthe Rivuta.\nIn October, 1880, Signora M. was at Florence, and her father at Siena.\nShe was suddenly seized with violent and persistent melancholy, so strong\nas to produce weeping, and to keep her awake through the night. Next\nmorning a telegram announced that her father\u2014about whom she had no\ncause for anxiety\u2014had been murdered at about the time when the\nmelancholy began. This is related in a letter from Signora M., dated\nMarch 26th, 1892. H_ Bamkotoh Smith.\nTim Law of Psychic Phenomena, a Working Hypothesis for the Systematic\nStudy of Hypnotism, Spiritism, Mental Therapeutics, &c. By\nThomson Jay Hudson. London ! G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1893.\nIt is not quite easy to decide on what plane Mr. Hudson's work should\nbe judged. If it be regarded as a purely popular, unscientific handbook to\n\fSupplement.l 231\nNotices of Books.\n\"pyschioal research,\" intended to inspire the general reader with an interest\nin the subject, we may say that it is clear and readable, and reproduces\na good deal of both fact and argument from these Proceedings and elsewhere\nin an easier, though often in an inaccurate, form, and occasionally with\nsome ingenious development. If, however, we judge it from a standpoint\nmore nearly approaching what seems to be the author's own, we shall be\nobliged to make some serious reserves even in this modified approval.\nThe professed aim of the book is certainly ambitious. \" My primary\nobject,\" says the author in his preface, \" is to assist in bringing Psychology\nwithin the domain of the exact sciences. That this has never been accom\nplished is owing to the fact that no successful attempt has been made to\nformulate a working hypothesis sufficiently simple to embrace all psychic\nphenomena. . . . The London S.P.R., whose ramifications extend all\nover the civilised world\" (we wish they did), \" was organised for the pur\npose of miking a systematic search for that law. ... I have tentatively\nformulated a working hypothesis for the systematic study of all classes of\npsychic phenomena. . . . Sincerely believing in the correctness of my\nhypothesis, I have not hesitated to follow it to its legitimate conclusion in\nevery field which I have entered.\"\nWe naturally looked with interest for the hypothesis which has thus far\neluded our own researches ;\u2014of which researches, we hasten to acknow\nledge, the author speaks in flattering terms. On p. 26 that hypothesis is\nproduced. But it hardly brings us much nearer to an exact science than we\nwere before.\n\" Under the rules of correct reasoning, therefore, I have a right to assume\nthat Man has two minds ; and the assumption is so stated, in its broadest\nform, as the first proposition of my hypothesis. For convenience I shall\ndesignate the one as the objective mind, and the other as the subjective mind.\n\" The second proposition is, that the subjective mind is constantly\nAMENABlE TO CONTROL BY SUGGESTION.\n\"The third, or subsidiary, proposition is, that the subjective mind is\nINCAPABlE OF INDUCTIVE REASONING.\"\nTo those who have in any degree followed the discussions in these\nProceedings on \"the supraliminal and the subliminal self,\" \"duplex per\nsonality,\" \"the hypnotic stratum,\" \" the mechanism of suggestion,\" and so\nforth, it will not at once be obvious for which part of this theory Mr.\nHudson claims originality. \" Hitherto,\" he goes on to say, \" no successful\nattempt has been made to define clearly the nature of the two elements which\nconstitute the dual mind\";\u2014and he proceeds \"slightly to modify and\nextend \" the definitions of objective and subjective in order to effect this\npurpose. The words \" objective \" and \" subjective \" have had many burdens\nto bear, but perhaps have never yet undergone the confusion worse con\nfounded of being set to represent two different forms or phases of what\nwould commonly be called subjective consciousness. Yet this nomenclature,\nso far as we can discover, is Mr. Hudson's main original contribution to\nthe psychology which he is anxious to transform into an exact science.\nA still more curious assumption of novelty for a theory familiar to most\nreaders will be found on p. 398. \" I have interpreted the passages \" (in the\nNew Testament), says Mr. Hudson, \" relating to the conditions precedent\n\f232 (Supplement.\nNotices of Boohs.\nto the attainment of immortal life in a way in which they have never before\nbeen interpreted.\" Mr. Hudson's interpretation is that when Jesus Christ\nsaid \"He that believeth on me hath everlasting life,\" he meant that \" belief\nwas the essential prerequisite to the attainment of immortality \" and that\nthose who did not believe simply perished altogether. This doctrine of\n\" conditional immortality,\" as it is usually called, is a perfectly well known\nform of theological escape from the doctrine of eternal perdition. It has\nbeen supported by tolerably conspicuous personages, from Origen down to\nSir George Gabriel Stokes. Whatever the theological value of the hypothesis\nmay be, it is hardly convincing as a mere proposition in experimental\npsychology deduced (as Mr. Hudson deduces it) from the phenomena of\nhypnotism. The theory of \"suggestion\" must be pushed far indeed if it\nis to prove that a mere change in a man's intellectual attitude, on however\nimportant a matter, can effect a fundamental revolution in the relation of\nhis soul to his own body, and to the unseen world. Mr. Hudson, however,\nhas no fear \"that even prejudice will find fault with my interpretation :\n. . [which] is confirmed by the facts of modern science, and must,\ntherefore, shed a new lustre upon the name and attributes of Jesus.\" The\ncritic, perhaps, may be excused from discussing a claim so lofty as this.\nBut indeed here, as often elsewhere, it looks as though Mr. Hudson had\nfallen into confusion from a somewhat hasty attempt to simplify theories\nwhich he has imperfectly grasped. His \"subjective mind\" is alternately\nmade equivalent to the whole of the self assumed as lying beneath the\nordinary threshold of consciousness, and then again only to the so-called\n\"hypnotic stratum\" of that assumed self,\u2014that dream-like part of our\nbeing which can be influenced by suggestions, however foolish, from our\nordinary conscious life. Thus he says (p. 324) of his \"subjective mind\":\n\"Those powers of which we catch occasional glimpses, and which so excite\nour admiration, are powers which pertain to its existence in a future world.\nThey arc powers which proclaim it as a part of God, as partaking of the\nnature and attributes of the Divine Mind.\" And yet this \"part of God,\"\nwhich \" sees God as He is,\" (p. 325) may be practically extinguished for ever\nby the mere suggestion of the mortal or \"objective mind,\" if the\n\" objective mind \" does not happen to believe in its companion's existence.\n\" A life-long scepticism regarding the existence of the soul, and a consequent\ndisbelief in immortality, constitute a suggestion that must operate to deprive\nthe soul of a conscious existence, if the law of suggestion is universal in its\noperations \" (p. 386). This seems (we repeat) a somewhat serious result to\nfollow upon a speculative uncertainty which a good many excellent men have\nshared ; nor are we convinced of its truth by being told (p. 327) that \" it is\nnot for man to question the wisdom of God in so ordaining the relations of\nthe soul to the body as to subordinate the eternal to the perishable.\"\nWe have dwelt thus far upon Mr. Hudson's theories, because he himself\nhas insisted much on their novelty and importance. But it is not by its thcoiies\nthat we are ourselves disposed to judge any new work on our special branch\nof experimental psychology, but rather by the new observations which it\nadduces, and most of all by the new experiments which it recounts. Let us\nsee how Mr. Hudson's work stands in these particulars. We cite the best\nnew observation and the best (or only) new experiment which we can find.\n\fSupplement. ] 233\nNotices of Books.\nOn p. 246 an alleged case of clairaudient warning ia given, which, if\ncorrectly reported, is in the highest degree remarkable. But all that is\nvouchsafed to us is a third-hand report, without names, date, or any kind of\nauthentication. We had hoped that one result of our work in these Proceedings\nmight have been that anyone who professed to accord importance to that work\nwould have become ashamed of this kind of looseness,\u2014would at least have\nendeavoured to bring his narratives up to a fair evidential level. What\nconfidence can we accord to a story told to us by Mr. Hudson, as told to him\nby an unknown person, to whom it was told by a \" well-known colored\npreacher \" at a date unknown 1 The case is worse here inasmuch as the\nstory happens to be one which, if true, it would be very easy to verify.\nOne series of experiments of Mr. Hudson's own is described in this work\n(pp. 192-5). \"The best possible condition,\" he says, \"for the conveyance\nof therapeutic suggestions from the healer to the patient is attained when\nboth are in a state of natural sleep ; and such suggestions can be so\ncommunicated by an effort of will on the part of the healer just before going\nto sleep.\" Mr. Hudson claims to have himself tried this method with\nsuccess. \" Over one hundred experiments have been made by the writer\nand one or two others to whom he has confided his theory, without a single\nfailure. Some very striking cures have been effected,\u2014-cures that would take\nrank with the most marvellous instances of healing recorded in the annals, of\nmodern psycho-therapeutics.\" It is obvious that if this statement represents\na real fact, it is extremely important. Not one tittle of evidence, however,\nis adduced in support of it ; and the one case which is described is a model of\nconfused vagueness.\nThe patient \"was subject to the most excruciating spasms during his\nnervous attacks of rheumatic trouble, and was frequently brought to the\nverge of the grave. . . . An idea of the suffering which he endured may\nbe imagined from the fact that pne of his hips had been drawn out of joint,\nby which the leg had been shortened about two inches.\" We find it\nuncommonly difficult to \" imagine an idea \" (to use our author's phrase) of\nwhat was really the matter with this patient ; and the description of his\ncure ;\u2014\" after the lapse of a few months\" he became \" comparatively well \" ;\n\u2014is of an equally mysterious character.\nNow we are quite ready to agree that Mr. Hudson's plan of endeavouring\nto affect a patient at a distance while both operator and patient are asleep\nmay be worth a trial. But who can pay any regard to alleged cures narrated\nin this slipshod unscientific style 1 If our author can really effect cures in\nthe manner claimed, he certainly can do nothing more useful to mankind\nthan to repeat them as often as possible, and to get someone to watch and\nrecord them with at least the care which an ordinary student bestows on a\nthesis sent in for his medical degree. We can assure Mr. Hudson that\nwe shall be the very first to welcome any real and effective collaboration\nof this kind.\nWe had marked for comment many passages containing, as it seemed to\nus, inconsistencies, exaggerations, or definite and demonstrable mistakes.\nBut it is distasteful further to insist on these in a book which does, after\nall, range itself on the side of what we regard as important and seldom-\nrealised truth. This is, we assume, a first work. We hope that our present\n\f234 [Supplement.\nNotices of Books.\nwords may have the effect, not of alienating the author from this difficult\nstudy, but of stimulating him to something more of that steady experiment\nand laborious accuracy which alone can help towards his avowed object of\n\" bringing Psychology within the domain of the exact sciences.\"\n\f\f\fSOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETINGS.\nThe 60th General Meeting of the Society was held at the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, July 14th, 1893, at 4 p.m., Professor\nSidgwick in the chair.\nMr. W.

But some\nother substances capable of producing anesthesia were also experi\nmented with ; among others, ethylidene dichloride, ethylene dichloride,\nchloropropane, amylene, etc. Professor John McKendrick and Dr.\nCoats bore the brunt of the inquiry ; my function was chiefly to\npurify the substances employed, and in some cases to ascertain their\ncomposition.\nOne of the questions which occurred to us to investigate was the\ninfluence of anesthetics on the rate at which the muscles respond to\na nervous stimulus. For example, a bright light was flashed before\nthe eyes of the partially anaesthetised person, who had to signal his\nperception of the stimulus by touching a button, which registered on\na chronograph the interval of time which elapsed between the flash\nof light and the response of the muscles. I was frequently the\nsubject of such experiments, and was often under various anaesthetics,\nmore or less completely. It has occurred to me that it might be of\ninterest to the Society for Psychical Research were I to put on record\nsome account of the mental delusions which invariably, with me,\naccompany partial insensibility ; and as I have frequently, though often\nat intervals of a year or more between each trial, taken anaesthetics\nwithout any tragic object in view, I am able to draw conclusions, not\nfrom one or two impressions, but from many, extending over a series\nof years.\nThe anaesthetic was always administered on a handkerchief or piece\nof rag, dipped in the liquid, whatever it might be. With nitrous\noxide, I usually breathed through an india-rubber tube straight from\nthe iron bottle in which the substance is sold, turning the gas on and\noff at each breath. When I failed to regulate the stop-cock, my\nassistant closed and removed the bottle.\nI may say at the outset, that on me all anesthetics produce the\nsame mental state. Some are more agreeable to inhale than others.\nTo breathe chloroform gives a feeling of slight nausea ; ether vapour\nis apt to excite coughing ; but they all produce the same curious\n\fPartial Anaesthesia. 237\ndelusion. My early recollections are of a kind of dream, of which\nthe main incidents were :\u2014A taste of peppermint ; an idea of two\ntones sounded together, of which the upper one was a harmonic of\nthe lower ; my eye then usually caught some object whose distinctive\nfeature was parallel lines ; for example, the bars of the grate, or the\ncross-pieces of the window-sash, and here again the idea of a harmonic\narrangement suggested itself, as if the bars of the grate were arranged\nso as to form gaps corresponding to the fundamental note, the fifth,\nand the octave. I have recollections of a certain artist's lay-figure\nin which the skin is removed to show the lie of the muscles, in motion\nround me, so that he, too, partook of the rhythmic nature of things,\ncontinually quickening his pace, and appearing on my left hand, to\ndart quickly past and disappear on my right. These I may term\npreliminary impressions ; I have long ceased to have them, and\nthey are more of the nature of an ordinary dream, in which things\npass through one's mind without exciting great attention, remarkable\nthough they may seem. I remember noticing with some curiosity\nthe mode of action of the gentleman without his skin ; how the\ninuscles of the thigh and calf contracted and expanded as he ran ;\nbut this was a matter of no great moment.\nDuring this dream I was really conscious, and was able to reply\nto questions, and to criticise the various remarks made by the persons\nround. Up to this point, moreover, I retained my power of signalling\nin response to a flash or a sound, with little, if any, greater retardation\nthan that of my normal state. But the second stage gradually\napproached ; and I failed to attend to external objects, except for\ncertain reasons, shortly to follow. An overwhelming impression\nforced itself upon me that the state in which I then was, was reality ;\nthat now I had reached the true solution of the secret of the universe,\nin understanding the secret of my own mind ; that all outside objects\nwere merely passing reflections on the eternal mirror of my mind ;\nsome more, some less transient. In later experiments with anaesthetics\nI have tried with success to recall events of the day ; how I was\noccupied in my laboratory ; how I walked down Oxford-street in\nthe morning ; what I saw, and whom I met ; and with success ;\nbut they impressed me as a fleeting vision ; something quite trivial\nand transitory. The main and impressive fact for me was that \/ was\nself-existent, and that time and space were illusions. This was the\nreal Ego, on whose surface ripples of incident arose, to fade and\nvanish like the waves on a pond.\nBut to test the truth of this conception, I have generally noted\nthe objects near me. Someone, perhaps, made a remark ; for example,\n\" He has had nearly enough now.\" This remark wearied me, because\nI had heard it so often before ; I conceived a low opinion of the\nr 2\n\f238 Professor William Ramsay.\nbeing who could pass his life in saying such a trivial and unimportant\nthing, and I disdained to answer. Or, perhaps, my eye caught sight\nof a Bunsen burner\u2014a common object in every laboratory ; and\nhere again I knew that it had been there through endless ages. Some\nnoise\u2014the emptying of a cart of coals on the street, perhaps\u2014struck\nmy attention. I not merely knew that it had happened before, but I\ncould have predicted that it would happen at that particular moment.\nTo make my story more definite, since writing the above, I have\ntaken ether, and during the commencement of anaesthesia, I took\nnotes ; it is as if one were writing in a dream ; I wrote until the\nmuscles of my hand refused to obey my will ; and I have little doubt\nthat the concentration of attention on the mechanical process of\nwriting interfered to some extent with the normal course of the\nmental impressions. The notes, such as they are, are as follows :\u2014-\n(I began with nitrous oxide.)\nSinging in ears ; slight difficulty in focussing, and dimness of\nvision (that is, I imagine, the partial paralysis of the muscles, the\nfunction of which is to focus the eyes) ; tingling in legs (continued\nwith ether ; the numbers refer to doses).\n1. Much slower than nitrous oxide : became unusually sensitive to\n\" outside things \" ; heard water dropping from cistern outside room.\n2. Deep inhalations ; stage of singing in ears not reached yet.\nJust come ; vision affected ; tingling in legs ; tingling in spinal\ncord at neck. Beginning of consciousness of previous existence.\n3. Slack off, keeping about the same stage.\n4. Ether disagreeable to inhale. Swallow, important. (This\nrefers to the fact, either true or imagined, that at this stage I always\nswallowed my saliva. It appeared to me to mark a definite stage\nin the whole range of sensations.) I allowed myself to recover\nslightly and wrote : \" This refers to feeling that same stage always\nrecurs, and to feeling of eternal existence.\"\n5. Felt perspiring. Am perspiring. Absurdly self-conscious,\nall through.\n6. A lot\u2014things going too slowly ; deep inhalations. Swallow,\ntfec., all as before.\n(On waking, I looked at my watch, and found that I had been\nunconscious about a quarter of an hour.)\nAs soon as I regained consciousness, I wrote :\u2014\" With the\nconsciousness of writing, sitting at this table ; with a handkerchief\nat my mouth, a door on my right, a window on my left, a cigarette\non the table (I am wearing striped trousers, and there is a cane-\nbottomed chair on my left), a ticket before me, and a book open\nat page 8. All these and other things convince me (as I have been\nconvinced before by seeing a piece of crumpled paper) that this is\n\fPartial Ancesthesia. 239\n.1 stage in the cycle of the universe. The notion is that I alone\naw privileged to see all this ; other people may exist, but I have .\nnot thought of them ; it is a phase in my development. Each time\nI am under the influence of an anaesthetic I am able to penetrate a\nlittle further into the unfathomable mystery. The recognition of past\nstages does much to render the path familiar.\" I do not think that\nI am a follower of Bishop Berkeley in my oidinary every-day existence ;\nmy tendency of mind is, by training, and by the nature of my daily\navocations, to suspend judgment\u2014a condition of scientific scepticism.\nBut under the influence of an anaesthetic all doubts vanish ; I know\nthe truth of Berkeley's theory of existence, and I also believe, because I\nknow with absolute certainty, that self-existence is all that any\nreasonable man can be convinced of ; that all fellow-creatures are\nproducts of my consciousness, and that, although they may be real\nto themselves, and have each a world of his own, to me they are\nmerely parts of my thoughts, and, moreover, not very important\nelements in my chain of life. Faith, I take it, is belief without\nreason, because of a supposed certain knowledge ; and that is my\nattitude of mind with regard to Berkeley's theory of existence. But\nthe feelings evoked are disappointing. It is not satisfying to realise\nthat the goal of the whole universe is of this nature. The circum\nstances are so trivial as to make it painful to believe that this is the\nscheme of nature ; that \" that far-off divine event to which the whole\ncreation moves \" should have in its progress no higher deeds, and for\nits outcome no nobler aim than I am then conscious of. My feelings\nare sometimes those of despair in finding the secret of existence so\nlittle worthy of regard. It is as if the veil that hides whence we\ncome, what we are, and what will become of us were suddenly rent,\nand as if a glimpse of the Absolute burst upon us. The conviction\nof its truth is overwhelming ; but it is painful in the extreme. I\nhave exclaimed\u2014\" Good heavens ! is this all ! \" Such impressions,\nwhich it is exceedingly difficult to express in words, pass off gradually.\nAfter five minutes they begin to fade in intensity ; the conviction\nof their absolute truth is less deep-seated ; that there exists an\nordinary work-a-day world, in which I and innumerable others play\nour parts, is again realised ; and in ten minutes or a quarter of an\nhour the state of mind is again perfectly normal. There is no after-\nimpression ; no nausea, except occasionally after chloroform ; and\nmy nerves are as steady as usual, for I have performed the operation\nof weighing immediately on recovery\u2014an operation requiring a steady\nhand, and some judgment.\nIt may be worth while to supplement the above account by full\nnotes taken by Miss F. W. of my sayings under ether.

Now I am sane again, but\nunder ether there is only me. It is all myself\u2014my wife and friends are\nnowhere. (2.10.) Fact of recurrence induces me to think of it as perpetual.\"\nAt the end of another experiment, in which the remarks bore a close\nsimilarity to those already given, I am reported to have said: \"Have\nbeen drunk with ether ; am now recovering. Of course, the theory\nof other people's existence is the most convenient. But when one is self-\ncentred, evidence goes the other way\u2014i.e., Universe evolves out of one's\nown mind. 27te whole thing turns on this point\u2014all social relations\u2014all\ndevelop out of the recurring stage.\" (I suggested, yes as \" nucleus.\") \"Yes,\nbut all comes out of this\u2014far more than you can imagine.\" (2.45, stopped.)\nSuch is a brief chronicle of my mental state under anaesthetics.\nOthers whom I have seen in a similar condition are usually unable to\ngive any account whatever of their sensations. One gentleman, how\never, now in Australia, used to be hypnotised by ether, and was very\nsusceptible to suggestions ; but he was highly excited, and sometimes\nbecame unpleasantly demonstrative, even dangerous.\nAt the end of a very interesting work by Sir Humphrey Davy\n(then Mr. Davy, working in Dr. Beddoes' Pneumatic Institution at\nBristol), entitled, Researches, Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly\nconcerning nitrous ' oxide or dephlogisticaied nitrons air and its res\npiration published in 1800, twenty-nine persons, among whom are\nDr. Joseph Priestley, Mr. Josiah Wedgwood, Mr. Boulton, and Mr.\nWatt, chronicle their feelings under the influence of nitrous oxide.\nThey almost all speak of a high flow of animal spirits, and great\npleasurable excitement ; but no one has placed on record any state of\nmind like that which I have attempted to describe. The only account\ntallying in the least with my impressions is by Davy himself, and with\nhim such impressions were exceptional. He says : \" As I recovered\nmy former state of mind, I felt an inclination to communicate the\ndiscoveries I had made during the experiment. I endeavoured to\nrecall the ideas : they were feeble and indistinct ; one collection of\nterms, however, presented itself ; and with the most intense belief and\nprophetic manner, I exclaimed to Dr. Kinglake, ' Nothing exists but\nthoughts !\u2014the universe is composed of impressions, ideas, pleasures,\nand pains ! '\" It is curious that this, with Davy, was an isolated\noccurrence ; it appears not to have recurred. With me it was a\npermanent impression.\n\fPartial Anccsthesia. 243\nIt is somewhat startling to be confronted with an unexpected\ncondition of one's own mind. The saying, in vino veritas, is, I suppose,\nintended to imply that an intoxicated person will blurt out the truth ;\nbut the intoxication of anaesthetics forces me, while in that condition,\nto believe that what I think is true. The theory attributed to Bishop\nBerkeley is a perfectly consistent one, and can be disputed only\non grounds of what we term \" common-sense.\" I do not, in my\nordinary state of mind, attribute any importance to this theory,\nbeyond regarding it as a somewhat improbable, but incontrovertible\nspeculation ; but I confess that, since my experiences with anaesthetics,\nI am disposed to regard it as worthy of a little more consideration\nthan it usually receives. The difficulty in accepting it is our\npractically absolute certainty of the existence of our fellow-creatures ;\nand the deduction that if A and B receive the same impression\nat the same time, that impression must be caused by some thing,\nexternal to both. But in my anaesthetic state, this objection presents\nno difficulty to me ; I conceive each ego to have his orbit, and\nto stand absolutely alone, conscious of, but uninterfered with by, the\nother egos. To choose a crude illustration :\u2014two mirrors reflect, but\ndo not influence each other in any mechanical or material sense. The\nrecollection, which remains after return to the ordinary state of mind,\nof having had such Berkeleian views, is, perhaps naturally, not without\nsome influence on the normal mind ; and, as I have said, it appears to\nme not wholly absurd to reconsider the usual postulates of \" common-\nsense.\" In short, I am confronted, under ether, with what I may term\n\" recurring events.\" It is necessary to form some theory which will\nreconcile myself with this new environment ; and the idea that the\nUniverse centres itself in me appears to me, while in the anaesthetised\nstate, to be a satisfactory one.\nI must leave to others speculations regarding the nature of the\nchange which has occurred in my brain by such stimulation or perhaps\npartial paralysis. Whether it is that a certain region of my brain is\nrendered inactive, and that a speculative tendency, to which I acknow\nledge, escapes the control of certain higher centres active in my\nordinary state of existence ; or whether the one lobe of the brain\nwhich I habitually use has become paralysed, and one which usually\nlies dormant is stimulated \u2014 these, and such questions, I cannot\nattempt to solve. The fact remains that, while amesthetised, my belief\nin that theory of existence which we may call for short the Berkeleian\nhypothesis, is immeasurably more firm and decided than in my normal\nstate is my belief in the ordinarily accepted views of matter and\nmotion which regulate the lives of most human beings.\nIn conclusion, I owe an apology for the egotistic tone of this\npaper. My only excuse is that, under the circumstances, it was\n\fProfessor William Ramsay.\nunavoidable. It might also have been desirable to have hunted\nthrough the literature of anaesthetics, and to have compared my\nimpressions with impressions possibly recorded by others. I have\npurposely avoided doing so, and for this reason, that I feared that I\nmight have been unconsciously led, before placing on record my\nexperiences, to give a biassed account. Such impressions are so apt to\nelude one's waking grasp, and to slip away like a dream, that any\ninducement to add to or to take from them has been carefully avoided.\nI believe that an examination of such a mental state is not without\nvalue. Everything which bears on the pathology of the mind throws\nlight on its physiology ; and I trust that others who may have\nhappened, from choice or necessity, to take anaesthetics, will be induced\nby my essay to give some details of their impressions.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 245\nII.\nTHE EXPERIENCES OF W. STAINTON-MOSES,\u2014I.\nBy Frederic W. H. Myers.\nMr. William Stainton Moses, who departed this life on September 5th,\n1892, entrusted by will his unpublished manuscripts to two friends as\nliterary executors\u2014viz., Mr. Charles Carleton Massey, barrister-at-law,\nand Mr. Alaric A. Watts, late one of the Assistant Secretaries to the\nBoard of Inland Revenue. These gentlemen, at my earnest request,\nhave permitted me to undertake the task of selecting passages from\nthe MSS. of our common friend, which passages they allow to be\nprinted in the first instance in the Proceedings of the S.P.R. In an\nobituary notice of Mr. Moses, already published in Proceedings,\nVol. VIII., p. 597 (and to which I would beg to refer my readers), I\nhave indicated the reasons which have for nearly twenty years led me\nto attach high importance to these records of his phenomena, and to\ndesire earnestly that they should be placed before the public in sufficient\ndetail to enable them to be rightly appreciated. Mr. Moses himself\nwas for a long time averse to any full publication of the documents,\nwhich do, indeed, contain much matter of a private and personal nature.\nBut in his later years his view changed ; he had himself begun (in\n1892) to publish them in Light, and his statements to intimate friends\nleave no doubt that this posthumous publication (with certain reserves\nto be mentioned hereafter) of the essential part of his records is in\naccordance with what would have been his own desire, as it is the desire\nof his trusted executors.\nThe materials here available for the exposition of Mr. Moses'\nunique experiences are of four kinds\u2014viz. : (1) his own printed\nworks ; (2) his MS. remains ; (3) the written and printed statements\nof witnesses to his phenomena, and (4) oral intercourse with himself\nand other friends.\nI. Among his printed works the most important for our present\npurpose are\u2014\n1. Researches in Spiritualism. This unfinished work was pub\nlished in Unman Nature\u2014a periodical now extinct\u2014in\n1874-5, and not reprinted. It is now difficult of access.\n2. Spirit Identity, published in 1879. This work also has been\nfor some years out of print.\n\f246 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n3. Spirit Teachings, published in 1883, is also at present out of\nprint ; but a new edition, with a biography by Mr.\nCharlton Speer, is now in preparation.\nTwo other volumes, Psyclwgraphy and Higher Asptcts of\nSjriritualism, contain little which bears on our present\ntheme.\nBesides these books, Mr. Moses wrote much in the weekly\nperiodical Light, of which he was for some years the editor.\nII. Mr. Moses' MSS. entrusted to me, and of which I have made\nuse, consist of thirty-one note-books, ranging from September, 1872, to\nMarch, 1883, and various letters.\nThe note-books may be divided as follows :\u2014\nTwenty-four books of automatic script, numbered 1-24, and\nextending from March, 1873, to March, 1883.\nFour books of records of physical phenomena, September, 1872\u2014\nJanuary, 1875. These books run concurrently with the books of auto\nmatic script. The first book of this series (April-September, 1872) is\nmissing. Those which remain I have numbered 2 B, 3 B, 4 B, and 5 B.\nThree books of retrospect and summary, which I number 25, 26,\n27. Books 25 and 26 recapitulate physical phenomena, with reflections.\nBook 27 is entitled The Identity of Spirit, and contains, in briefer form,\nmuch of the evidence first printed in Spirit Identity ; which work,\nindeed, this later tractate may have been intended to supersede. Some\nof the letters also are of value, but mainly as adding contemporary con\nfirmation to facts already to be found in the note-books.\nIII. Among the records made by friends the most important are\nMrs. Stanhope Speer's \" Records of Private Seances, from notes taken at\nthe time of each sitting.\" Over sixty instalments of these records have\nnow (October, 1893) been published in Light. They begin in 1872,\nand go down to 1881\u2014considerably beyond the date (1875) at which\nMr. Moses' extant records of physical phenomena obtained in his\nseances cease. As will be seen later on, these independent and con\ntemporary records are evidentially of capital importance. Dr. and Mrs.\nStanhope Speer were Mr. Moses' most intimate friends ; and they, often\nwith another intimate friend, Mr. F. W. Percival (Barrister-at-Law\nand Examiner in the Education Department), were the habitual mem\nbers, and generally the only members, of the small group who witnessed\nthe phenomena about to be described.\nMr. Percival, the late Dr. Speer, Mr. W. H. Harrison, and Dr.\nThomson, and the late Mr. Serjeant Cox have at different times\nprinted short first-hand records of certain of Mr. Moses' phenomena,\nand Mrs. Garratt and Miss Birkett took some contemporary notes of\nsittings at which they were present.\nTwo note-books and other MSS. by Dr. Speer have been placed in\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 247\nmy hands, and contain independent contemporary records of much\nevidential value.\nIV. In estimating the evidential value of oral intercourse as to Mr.\nMoses' phenomena, the character of my own friendship for him is an\nitem on which I am bound to be explicit. Friendship it might truly\nbe called, for it was based upon a consciousness of common pur\nsuits of great moment, and I felt for him much both of gratitude and\nof esteem. He responded to my unfeigned interest with a straight\nforward intimacy of conversation on the experiences of which I cared so\nmuch to learn. But there was no such close personal attraction as is\nlikely to prompt me to partiality as a biographer ; and, indeed, both\nEdmund Gurney and I were conscious in him of something like the\nimpatience of a schoolmaster towards slow students ;\u2014natural enough\nin a man whose inborn gifts have carried him irresistibly to a con\nviction on the edge of which less favoured persons must needs pause\nand ponder long. I am bound to add that the study of his note\nbooks, by making him more intimately known to me as he was in his\nbest days, has brought me nearer to the warm and even enthusiastic\nestimate implied in the letters of various more intimate friends of his\nwhich lie before me.\nMore important, however, than the precise degree of attractiveness,\nor of spiritual refinement, in Mr. Moses' personal demeanour are the\nfundamental questions of sanity and probity. On these points neither\nI myself, nor, so far as I know, any person acquainted with Mr. Moses,\nhas ever entertained any doubt. \" However perplexed for an explana\ntion,\" says Mr. Massey, \" the crassest prejudice has recoiled from ever\nsuggesting a doubt of the truth and honesty of Stainton Moses.\"\n\" I believe that he was wholly incapable of deceit,\" writes Mr. H. J.\nHood, barrister-at law, who knew him for many years. The people\nwho assumed that he must somehow have performed the phenomena\nof his dark stances himself ;\u2014who asked, triumphcintly, \" Where was\nMoses when the candle went out 1 \"\u2014even these never, so far as I\nknow, suggested anything beyond unconscious fraud in a trance-\ncondition.\nA brief record of Mr. Moses' life, with some estimates of the work\ndone by him in ordinary professional capacities, will help the reader to\nform something of a personal judgment on his character.\nOn the events of his life the Speer family, who were his most\nintimate friends, and are well acquainted with his nearest surviving\nrelatives, are my main authority. Their importance as witnesses of the\nphenomena is so great that I must be pardoned for inserting a\n\" testimonial \" to the late Dr. Speer (M.D. Edinburgh) ; which shall\nnot, however, be in my own words, but in those of Dr. Marshall\nHall, F.R.S., one of the best known physicians of the middle of this\n\f248 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\ncentury. Writing on March 18th, 1849, Dr. Marshall Hall says (in a\nprinted collection of similar testimonials now before me) : \" I have\ngreat satisfaction in bearing my testimony to the talents and acquire\nments of Dr. Stanhope Templeman Speer. Dr. Speer has had unusual\nadvantages in having been at the Medical Schools, not only of London\nand Edinburgh, but of Paris and Montpellier, and he has availed\nhimself of these advantages with extraordinary diligence and talent.\nHe ranks among our most distinguished rising physicians.\"\nDr. Speer held at different times various hospital posts of credit,\nand was much valued as a practising physician at Cheltenham and in\nLondon. The work of a physician, however, was rendered somewhat\ntrying to him by an over-anxious temperament ; and as he possessed\nprivate means, and had strong scientific and artistic tastes, he quitted\nhis profession at thirty-four, and preferred to spend the latter part of\nhis life in studious retirement. Dr. Speer's cast of mind was strongly\nmaterialistic, and it is remarkable that his interest in Mr. Moses'\nphenomena was from first to last of a purely scientific, as contrasted\nwith an emotional or a religious, nature.\nI regret that I never met Dr. Speer, who died in 1889. His\nwidow, Mrs. Stanhope Speer, is well known to me ; and I regard her as\nan excellent witness. Her son, Mr. Charlton T. Speer (also an\nexcellent witness) is an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music, and\nis well known in musical circles as a successful composer and performer.\nWith these words of preface I pass on to the facts\u2014simple and\nordinary enough in their external aspect\u2014of Mr. Moses' life.\nWilliam Stainton Moses was born in Lincolnshire, November 5th,\n1839. His father had been headmaster of a grammar-school at\nDonington, near Lincoln. His mother's family name was Stainton. Mr.\nStainton Moses believed that the name Moses had been originally\nMostyn, but that an ancestor had changed it in order to avoid some\nperil in the time of the Commonwealth. There seems no reason\nto suppose that the family, which had been for some time settled\nin Lincolnshire, was of Jewish descent. Mrs. Moses\u2014still living\nand vigorous (1893) at the age of ninety-one\u2014was a serious and\nintelligent woman, and brought up her only son with pious care. He\nshowed ability ; and the family moved to Bedford, about 1852, that\nhe might have the advantage of education at Bedford College. There\nhe did well, and in due time gained a scholarship at Exeter College,\nOxford. In his school days he occasionally walked in his sleep, and on\none occasion his mother saw him go down into the sitting-room and\nwrite an essay on a subject which had puzzled him on the previous\nevening, and return to bed without awaking. The essay thus written\nwas the best of those sent up by the class that day (Mr. Moses\ntells us), and was fully up to the level of his waking performances.\n\fTfte Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 249\nThis is the only incident of which I have heard which in any way\nforeshadowed his future gift. He is not recorded as having been a\nspecially nervous or excitable child ; and he was at this time strong\nand healthy. In after life his health was bad ; but his troubles were\nmainly respiratory\u2014constantly recurring catarrh and bronchitis\u2014until\nnear the end of his life, when he was attacked by Bright's disease,\nwhich ultimately caused his death. His phenomena, it may be observed,\nwere at their best when he was in his best health, and declined or\ndisappeared altogether when he was ill.\nTo return to his Oxford career. At Oxford he was an ambitious\nand hard-working, but not in other ways a very noticeable, under\ngraduate. His health broke down from overwork, and he left Oxford\nwithout taking a degree, and spent some considerable time in travel,\nmainly with friends, but in part alone. He was already much\ninterested in theology, and he lived for some six months (none of these\ndates are very precise) in a monastery on Mount Athos. Beyond the\nmere fact of his residence on Mount Athos, to which his surviving\nfriends testify, all that is known of this period of seclusion consists\nof allusions made by his \" spirit guides,\" who say that they directed\nhim thither that he might study the Eastern Church, and be prepared\nby a comparison of theologies for the reception of a wider truth. Be\nthis as it may, he recovered his health, returned to Oxford, took his\ndegree, was ordained by Bishop Wilberforce, and accepted a curacy at\nKirk Maughold, near Ramsey, in the Isle of Man, at the age of twenty-\nfour. He was an active parish clergyman, liked by his parishioners, and\nholding Anglican views of an ordinary type. On the occasion of an\noutbreak of small-pox he distinguished himself by his zeal and kindness ;\nand it is recorded that in one case he helped to nurse and to bury a\nman whose malady was so violent that it was hard to get anyone to\napproach him. During this period also he began to write for periodi\ncals, Punch and the Saturday Revieiv being specially mentioned. The\nmemorial verses to the Rev. F. D. Maurice which appeared in Punch\nhave since been quoted as of Mr. Moses' writing ; and I should conceive\nthat his other contributions were probably in this serious strain. He\ncontinued to write much, anonymously, for various periodicals during\nmany years of his life, and showed an easy style and a good deal of\nmiscellaneous knowledge.\nAfter some four years of residence near Ramsey, he accepted the\ncuracy of St. George's, Douglas, Isle of Man. Here also he was\nesteemed as an active clergyman, and admired as a preacher. In April,\n1869, he had a serious illness, and hearing that Dr. Speer, whom he\nknew slightly, was in the island on a holiday, he called in his medical\naid. Dr. Speer brought him successfully through his illness, and\ninvited him as a convalescent to the house which he was renting in the\n\f250 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nisland. The foundations of a life-long friendship with Dr. and Mrs.\nSpeer were then laid.\nIn 1870 he took a curacy somewhere in Dorsetshire, where also he\nwas liked, and was appointed \" Lent preacher \" for the county. A very\nsevere attack of hooping-cough obliged him to interrupt his parish\nwork, which, in fact, he never resumed. Dr. Speer invited him to\nbecome his son's tutor, and for seven years he filled that office in a way\nwhich attached to him both parents and pupil more closely than ever.\nIn 1871 he was offered a mastership in University College School ; and\nthis post he held until failing health compelled him to resign it some\nthree years before his death. The physical phenomena about to be\ndescribed began in 1872, and continued with gradually lessening-\nfrequency until 1881. The automatic script began in 1873, and finally\ndied out, so far as we know, in 1883. During these later years\nMr. Moses was active in contributing to, and afterwards in editing, the\nweekly newspaper Light ; and he took a leading part in several\nspiritistic organisations. Of one of these\u2014the London Spiritualist\nAlliance\u2014he was president at the time of his death. In 1882 he aided\nin the foundation of the Society for Psychical Research ; but he left that\nbody in 1886, on account of its attitude towards Spiritualism, which\nhe regarded as unduly critical. It is worth remarking that although,\nas the fact of his withdrawal shows, many members of the Society held\nan intellectual position widely differing from that of Mr. Moses, and\nalthough his own published records were of a kind not easily credible,\nno suspicion as to his personal probity and veracity was ever, so far as\nI know, either expressed or entertained.\nMr. Moses' health became steadily weaker. He suffered greatly from\nsuppressed gout, in addition to other ailments. A serious fall from\nthe top of an omnibus made matters worse. In 1890 he was attacked\nby influenza in the severest form, and was reckoned, I believe, to have\nhad twelve separate relapses or recurrences of that complaint. An\naccident to his eyes also gave him much trouble. He worked on, as\nbest he could, to the last ; but the period of decline was tedious and\ndistressing ; and it would be very unfair to judge him from the\nutterances of these last years. When in September, 1892, he passed\nfrom earth, we may surely trust that his achievements here had won\ntheir way to promotion, and his sufferings to repose.\nMr. Moses never married, and went very little into general society.\nHis personal appearance offered no indication of his peculiar gift.\nHe was of middle stature, strongly made, with somewhat heavy\nfeatures, and thick dark hair and beard. The accompanying photo\ngraph (reproduced from Light by the kind permission of Mr. E. Dawson\nRogers) shows his face as his body lay in death. His expression of\ncountenance was honest, manly, and resolute. Many testimonies of\n\f\f\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 251\naffection and esteem appeared in Light and elsewhere after his decease ;\nespecially, of course, from those to whom his experiences and teachings\nhad brought a convincing hope. I subjoin a few letters from friends\nwho had good opportunities of estimating his value in the common\nduties and intercourse of life.\nDr. Johnson, of Bedford, writes to me as follows :\u2014\n\" 68, High-street, Bedford.\n\" March 24th, 1893.\n\"Dear Sir,\u2014As the intimate friend and medical adviser of the late\nStainton Moses I have had ample opportunities of thoroughly knowing his\ncharacter and his mental state.\n\" He was a man even in temper, painstaking and methodical, of excep\ntional ability, and utterly free from any hallucination or anything to indicate\nother than a well-ordered brain.\n\" He was a firm believer in all that he uttered or wrote about matters of a\nspiritual nature, and he impressed me\u2014and, I believe, most others he came in\ncontact with\u2014with the genuineness of his convictions and a firm belief not\nonly that he believed in the statements he had made and written, but that\nthey were the outcome of a mind which had given itself up entirely to the\nstudy of a subject which he considered of essential value and importance\nto the welfare of his fellow men. .\n\" I have attended him in several very severe illnesses, but never, in sick\nness or at other times, has his brain shown the slightest cloudiness or suffered\nfrom any delusion. I not only consider that he believed what he stated, but\nI think that those who knew him best would not for an instant doubt that all\nhe stated were facts and words of truth.\u2014Sincerely yours,\n\" Wm. G. Johnson.\"\nIn another letter Dr. Johnson says :\u2014\n\" He was a most lovable character ; kind and generous in his every action ;\nand with a fund of information on most subjects which made him a most\nwelcome guest.\"\nDr. Eve, headmaster of University College School, writes as follows\nto Professor Sidgwick :\u2014\n\" University College School, Gower-street, London, W.C.\n\" March 18th, 1893.\n\"Mv Dear Sidgwick,\u2014Stainton Moses was an excellent colleague. He\nconfined himselr entirely to English ; in that subject he took classes in all\nparts of the school, and his work was always well and methodically done.\nHe taught essay-writing well, and was very skilful in appreciating the relative\nvalue of boys' essays, which is not easy. He was much looked up to by boys,\nand had considerable influence over them. On general points connected\nwith the management of the school he was one of the colleagues to whom I\nmost naturally turned for advice, and I have every reason to be grateful to\nhim.\u2014Yours very sincerely, \"H. W. Eve.\"\nMr. F. W. Levander, a master at University College School, writes\nto me thus :\u2014\ns\n\f252 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\n\" University College School, Gower-street, London, W.C.\n\"Ma<i 1893.\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014My acquaintance with the lnte W. Stainton Moses com\nmenced in the year 1871, when he first became one of the masters here.\nThis acquaintance soon extended beyond the nature of that generally met\nwith between colleagues ; it ripened into a constantly increasing friendship,\nwhich continued unbroken till his death. During the whole of this long\nperiod ho always impressed me with the idea that ho was thoroughly\nearnest and conscientious, and I believe that perfect reliance can be placed\non all his statements.\u2014Yours faithfully, \" F. W. Levander.\"\nI have often heard Mr. Moses discussed by persons of opinions\nopposed to his own ; and since I owe it to my readers to make the\npresent paper not merely eulogistic, but as accurately descriptive\nas my materials allow, I feel bound to reproduce adverse criticisms. I\nhave, then, heard him, in his later years, characterised as an obstinate,\nconfused, and irritable controversialist. I have heard him described as\nlacking in the grace of humility, and in that spirituality of tastes and\ncharacter which should seem appropriate to one living much in the\ncommerce of the Unseen. But I have never heard anyone who had\neven the slightest acquaintance with Mr. Moses impugn his sanity or\nHis sincerity, his veracity or his honour.\nThus briefly,\u2014and with a dispassionate coldness against which an\nimpulse of gratitude in my own heart rebels,\u2014let the life of W.\nStainton Moses be here recorded. But now our narrative must pass at\na bound from the commonplace and the credible to bewildering and\ninconceivable things. With the even tenour of this straightforward and\nreputable life was inwoven a chain of mysteries which, as I have before\nsaid, in what way soever they be explained, make that life one of the\nmost extraordinary which our century has seen. For his true history\nlies, not in the everyday events thus far recorded, but in that series of\nphysical manifestations which began in 1872 and lasted for some eight\nyears, and that series of automatic writings and trance-utterances\nwhich began in 1873, received a record for some ten years, and did\nnot, as is believed, cease altogether until the earthly end was near.\nThese two series were intimately connected ; the physical pheno\nmena being avowedly designed to give authority to the speeches and\nwritings which professed to emanate from the same source. There is no\nground for separating the two groups, except the obvious one that tho\nautomatic phenomena are less difficult of credence than the physical.\nSince, however, to the physical we must needs come sooner or later,\nit seems the simplest plan to place them first, as coming first in\nchronological order. I shall, therefore, proceed to describe some of\nthese sittings, mainly by quotation from Mr. Moses' contemporary\nnotes.\nMr. Moses' notes, however, are not the only records of theie experi\n\fThe Experiences of W. Staintan Moses. 253\nments. For almost all the sittings which he describes, and for some\nwhich he does not describe, there is (as already stated) a second detailed,\nindependent, contemporary record, by Mrs. Stanhope Speer, and for\nmany of the sittings a third record, also independent and contempora\nneous, although very brief, by Dr. Speer. For some few of them there\nis also a similar record by Mr. Percival ; whose memory also confirms\nthe other accounts. Parts of Mr. Moses' own record, indeed, are\navowedly derived from the other sitters, since he depended upon them\nfor information as to what went on when he was in trance. But he\nhas always, I think, made this distinction clear in his notes. His note\nbooks of these phenomena, I may add, were very privately kept, and\neven Mrs. Speer tells me that she has never read any of them except\nthe first. Curiously enough, therefore, much of what I now print has\nactually never been read till now, so far as I can discover, by anyone\nexcept the writer himself. And a certain combination of accidents has\nbeen needed even now to enable these passages, after their twenty years\nof privacy, to see at last the light of day.\nMrs. Stanhope Speer's notes have, as already stated, been for the\nmost part already published in Light, so that the reader can judge for\nhimself as to their accordance with Mr. Moses' record. They are\nlargely concerned with trance-utterances of which Mr. Moses was\nunconscious, but the description of the physical phenomena seems to me\nas nearly identical in the two series of records as can be expected from\ntwo separate observers. I have not thought it needful to reprint here\nmore than a few passages of Mrs. Speer's, where, for some reason or\nother, her account seems to supply a useful complement to Mr. Moses\nown.\nDr. Speer's notes, which are short, I have printed almost in extenso,\n\u2014interwoven with Mr. Moses' own. They were written on a loose sheet\nof paper and in two small note-books, which do not appear to have\nbeen shown to anyone but Mr. Moses, among whose papers at Bedford\nthey were found. He printed some extracts from them in Light. An\nimportant statement from Dr. Speer is also incorporated in Mr. Moses'\nResearches in Spiritualism, and will be quoted below. I may add that\nMrs. Speer, examining Dr. Speer's private diary, has found there also\nshort records of seances, concordant, though not verbally identical,\nwith the accounts given in his note-books. These records extend\nfurther than the note-books, and some of them also will be found below.\nSeveral passages by Mr. F. W. Percival, already printed, will be\nfound below ; and Mr. Percival has verbally confirmed to me the\ncorrectness of Mrs. Speer's record of those sittings at which he was\nhimself present. Much indeed which is there given was taken down\nby Mr. Percival himself.\nI have spoken of these records as contemporaneous. Mrs. Stanhope\n\f254 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nSpeer tells me that her notes were habitually written on the day of the\nsitting, or at latest on the morrow. As to Dr. Speer's and Mr. Moses'\nnotes it is now impossible to be equally certain, except in Mr. Moses'\nbooks of automatic script, in which every entry begins with a record of\nthe day, and often of the hour and the place, of writing. But the inci\ndental phrases, and the changes of pen and handwriting, in his note\nbooks of physical phenomena lead me to think that his notes were\nroughly jotted down daily, and written out in the note-book either at\nonce or at intervals of a few days. He says himself that they \" were\nvery regularly written when the events of the seance were fresh in my\nmemory.\" This point is the less important because, as I have said, the\nvarious series of records are so concordant that (unless it be suggested\nthat they were fabricated to suit each other, though with a show of\nindependence) it is clear that they must all have been written while the\nevents were fresh in the recorders' minds.\nThe passages which I have selected for quotation are simply such\nas best illustrate the subject matter ;\u2014the most striking and charac\nteristic samples of the recorded phenomena. This may not, perhaps,\nbe the most politic course, in view of the reader's difficulties of belief :\nbut (as already implied) there seems no valid ground for selecting what\nhe might regard as the least incredible among so many incredibilities.\nThe evidence for all the incidents is practically the same ;\u2014the whole\ngroup of witnesses are as fully pledged, say, to the falling of pearls\nfrom the air as to the automatic script or the trance-phenomena. I at\nleast can see no via media which can be plausibly taken. The\npermanent fraud of the whole group, or the substantial accuracy of all\nthe records, are the only hypotheses which seem to me capable of\ncovering the facts. At any rate, before further discussing this point, I\npropose to quote at sufficient length to allow my readers to form their\nown judgment. My only personal contribution to the data before us\nlies in my somewhat confident impression that my friends whom I am\nthus frankly discussing are and were in the habit of speaking the truth.\nThere are, indeed, two subsidiary points on which I have had a\nclear principle to guide me to certain omissions. In the first place, I\nhave almost wholly omitted Mr. Moses' accounts of his sittings with\nother mediums. What in those sittings is important for our present\npurpose may be briefly summarised as follows :\u2014\n1. Mr. Moses spent much time and trouble in sitting with many\npaid and one or two private mediums. He was in the habit of at once\nrecording the results in private note-books and trying to decide\nwhether the phenomena were genuine or no. So far we have addi\ntional indication of a serious and reasonable interest in such matters,\nas against the view that his own experiences are attributable to\nhallucination or fraud.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 255\n2, As an observer he seems to me to have been about at the average\nlevel of that epoch. Several times he detected fraud ; once at least he\nwas convinced by a manifestation afterwards absolutely proved to have\nbeen fraudulent. On some other occasions, while it is not certain that\nhe was deluded, he shows a very imperfect perception of possibilities of\ndeceit. But his degree of acumen as a detective is of little importance\nto our present inquiry.\n3. More important is the question as to the relation between these\nseances with other mediums and his own manifestations. He\nfrequently asked the l: guides \" or \" controls \" of his automatic writing\ntheir opinion on what he had witnessed. Did those \" controls,\" we\nmay ask, ever vouch for the genuineness of what was afterwards proved\nto be false 1 or did they, on the other hand, show that kind of intimate\nand infallible detective power which might be expected from observers\nfreed from the trammels of the flesh ? The evidence is to my mind\ninconclusive either way. The \" controls \" themselves are of various\ntypes ; and there is one rare \" control \" (\"Magus\"), to be later discussed,\nwhose utterances seem to me shifty and exaggerated, in a way very\ncommon in automatic script, and who does apparently endorse a com\nplete impostor. The utterances of other \" controls \" for the most part\nreflect Mr. Moses' own opinions on other mediums, or are sometimes\nmore severe. 1 But the question which is of most interest, and which\n1 After a sitting with Mr. Williams, which Mr. Moses had recorded as fully con\nvincing, the following remarkable colloquy occurs in an automatic note-book (Book\nXV., p. 1.)\nAug. !MA, 1874, Bedford.\nQ. Was anyone present at the last seance at Mrs. F.'st I was much impressed.\nA. Yes. I was not present myself but our friends were there. We do not advise\nyou to rest much on that.\ny. What 1 I thought it conclusive proof.\nA. You must use your own judgment. We do but warn you to be careful.\nI}. Do you mean to say it was not genuine ?\nA. We only urge you to be wary. The manifestation was suspicious and is not to\nbe depended on.\nQ. I am surprised. Who writes ?\nA. It is I,\u20141 1 : S : D. [Imperator, Servus Dei, the assumed name of Mr. Moses'\nprincipal guide.l\nQ. Then you will tell me. Am I to understand that the manifestation was not of\na materialised form?\nA We do not feel it part of our work to save you from the use of your own\npowers. You are warned. Exercise your observing faculties.\nQ. But I am bewildered.\nA It is needful for you to work through such experience. We may not save you\nfrom it. Only be wary.\nQ. I have long wanted information about those forms and have had grave doubts,\nbut I have believed in J.K. [John King.l\nA. It is not our plan to give you any further information now. We only say that\nwhat was then presented was dubious.\nC\u00a3 But I am to write about it. Was it a materialisation at all ? Is there such a\nthing?\n\f25G Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nis now insoluble, iirises when Mr. Moses and his accustomed guides\nconcur in maintaining the genuineness of certain phenomena occurring\nin the presence of a medium whose occasional fraud neither Mr. Moses\nnor his guides deny. Something of this sort is the case with regard to\nthe \" spirit photographs\" of the late Mr. Hudson. Hudson was clearly-\nshown to have occasionally cheated, and was once actually caught\ncheating\u2014in a most rudimentary manner\u2014by Mr. Moses himself.1\nNevertheless, if such things as genuine spirit photographs shall after\nwards be shown to exist, then these photographs of Hudson's and the\naccompanying statements made by the automatic script, will deserve\ncareful reconsideration.\nThe second point on which omissions from the manuscript are\nA. You will know all in due time, but that was not reliable. We urge you to Un\ncareful. You are always careful, as you think. But be wary as to generalising too\nrapidly. There is in the manifestation of the lower spirits much deception, nor can\nyou ever be sure that such is not being praotised. It is so in all the manifestations in\nwhich the more material spirits are concerned.\nQ. You do not tell me much.\nA. We do not purpose to do so. We only warn. It was not reliable.\nQ. But I had my hand in J. K.'s and the other on the medium's body. There\ncould be no deception there.\nA. On the medium's boot, but not on his body, as Kabbila informs us. But we\nwill go no further. It is not our habit to go so far. Seek not further information.\nIt will not be given. We do not wish to communicate at length now. You have\ndone all that you are capable of doing.\nti. But I want to ask further. Are my senses good for nothing, or am I so easily\ndeceived ?\nA. No, no. Neither. But you know nothing of occult influence when deceiving\nspirits are present. The mixture of the true and false would make it impossible for\nyou to arrive at fact. Hence have we warned you so urgently to beware of the intro\nduction of such. They are fatal to our work. Cease now.\nt I : S: D. [Iniperator, Servus Dei.l\nt R. [Rector.l\n(Two hours later\u2014same day\u2014evening.)\nA. The chief will not speak. He is very cautious. But I saw and can testify. It\nwas all bad.\nQ. How do you know 1 I can't believe it.\nA. It was all bad. John King was not there ; but another who deceived.\nQ. How in the world am I to know then ? I could not tell.\nA. You would have known if you had been woll, and we were not able to protect\nyou against false spirits.\nQ. How am I to know that you aro not mistaken t or if you are right, how am I\nto know what is true and what false ?\nA. We have already told you that false and deceiving spirits always do abound in\nsuch circles. Hence it is that you have been so warned of the danger of the assaults\nof the undeveloped.

As a general rule the same alleged spirits both\nmanifested themselves by raps, &c, at Mr. Moses' sittings with his\nfriends, and also wrote through his hand when he was alone. In this, as\nin other respects, Mr. Moses' two series of sittings\u2014when alone and in\ncompany\u2014were concordant, and, so to say, complementary ;\u2014explana\ntions being given by the writing of what had happened at the seances.\nWhen \" direct writing \" was given at the seances the handwriting of\neach alleged spirit was the same as that which the same spirit was in\nthe habit of employing in the automatic script. The claim to\nindividuality was thus in all cases decisively made.\nNow the personages thus claiming to appear may be divided\nroughly into three classes :\u2014\nA.\u2014First and most important are a group of persons recently\ndeceased, and sometimes, as will be seen, manifesting themselves\nat the stances before their decease was known through any ordinary\nchannel to any of the persons present. These spirits in many instances\ngive tests of identity, mentioning facts connected with their earth-\nlives which are afterwards found to be correct. With all such cases\nwe shall have in the next paper to deal at length.\nB.\u2014Next comes a group of personages belonging to genera\ntions more remote, and generally of some distinction in their day.\nGrocyn, the friend of Erasmus, may be taken as a type of these. Many\nof these also contribute facts as a proof of identity, which facts, as in\nGrocyn's case given below, are sometimes more correct than the con\nscious or admitted knowledge of any of the sitters could supply. In\nsuch cases, however, the difficulty of proving identity is increased (as\nwill be seen later on) by the fact that most (though not all) of the\nfacts thus given are readily accessible in print, and may conceivably\nhave either been read and forgotten by Mr. Moses, or have become\nknown to him by some kind of clairvoyance.\nC.\u2014A third group consists of spirits who give such names as\nRector, Doctor, Theophilus, and, above all, Imperator. These from\ntime to time reveal the names which they assert to have been theirs in\nearth-life. These concealed names are for the most part both more\nillustrious, and more remote than the names in Class B,\u2014and it is\nthese which will here be withheld. This was the express wish of Mr.\nMoses himself, who justly felt that the assumption of great names is\nlikely to diminish rather than to increase the weight of the com\nmunication. He felt this in his own person ; and for a long while one\nof his main stumbling-blocks lay in these lofty and unprovable claims.\nUltimately he came to believe even in these identities, on the general\nground that teachers who had given him so many proofs both of their\npower and of their serious interest in his welfare were not likely to\n\f258 Mr. F. W. H. Myers.\nhave deceived him on such a point. But he did not count upon a\nsimilar belief in others, and he expressly wished to avoid seeming to\nclaim special authority for the teachings on the ground of their alleged\nauthorship. It must be added also that some of these teachings them\nselves asserted that when the name of some spirit long removed from\nearth was given, the recipient must sometimes take this to imply a\nstream of influence emanating from that spirit, rather than his own\npresence in person.1\n\"The higher spirits who come to your earth are influences or emanations.\nThey are not what you describe as persons, but emanations from higher\nspheres. You must learn to recognise the impersonality of the higher mes\nsages. When we first appeared to this medium he insisted on our\nidentifying ourselves to him. But many influences come through our name.\nTwo or three stages after death, spirits lose much of what you regard as in\ndividuality, and become more like influences. I have now passed to the\nverge of the spheres from which it is possible to return to you, and I can\ninfluence without any regard to distance. I am very distant from you now.\"\nWith these special exceptions, made on the grounds above explained,\nthe quotations which follow are fully representative of the series of\nMr. Moses' notes of physical phenomena. These notes, as already\nstated, were contained in five books, numbered by me IB, 2 B, 3 B,\n4 B, 5 B,\u2014of which the first is missing.\nThe now missing 1 B (as is incidentally stated by Mr. Moses) con\ntained the early experiments, and was the note-book from which he\ntook much of the material for certain papers summarising those experi\nments which he printed in Human Nature in 1874. I shall therefore\nbegin with quoting the important parts of this summary, which has\nbeen long out of print. The subsequent direct quotations from the\nnote-books will explain some points which the summary leaves obscure ;\nfor instance, as to the amount of observation which Mr. Moses, in his\nnormal state, was able to give to the phenomena, and the degree to\nwhich he depended upon information from his fellow-sitters.\nOne word more before the citations begin. It must be remembered\nthat the phenomena here to be described, strange and grotesque as they\noften seem, cannot be called meaningless. The alleged operators are\nat pains throughout to describe what they regarded as the end, and\nwhat merely as the means to that end. Their constantly avowed\nobject was the promulgation through Mr. Moses of certain religious\nand philosophical views ; and the physical manifestations are through\nout described as designed merely as a proof of power, and a basis for\nthe authority claimed for the serious teachings.2\n1 1 have here had to draw a somewhat arbitrary line, and have decided to withhold\nall names more ancient and venerable than that of Seneca.\na Spirit Teachings, which includes many of these communications, has juBt been\nrepublished with a Life by Mr. Charlton Speer.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 259\nQugtations from Mr. Moses' \" Researches in Spiritualism.\" 1\n\" All that I have described [of movement] occurs readily when the\ntable is untouched. Indeed, when the force is developed, we have found\nit better to remove the hands and leave the table to its own devices.\nThe tilting above noticed has been even more marked when the sitters\nhave been removed from it to a distance of about two feet. It has\nrapped on the chair and on the floor, inclined so as to play into a hand\nplaced on the carpet, and has been restored to its normal position when\nno hand has touched it. The actual force required to perform this\nwould be represented by very considerable muscular exertion in a man\nof ordinary strength.\n\" We had ventured on one occasion, contrary to direction, to add to\nour circle a strange member. Some trivial phenomena occurred, but\nthe usual controlling spirit did not appear. When next we sat, he\ncame ; and probably none of us will easily forget the sledge-hammer\nblows with which he smote the table. The noise was distinctly audible\nin the room below, and gave one the idea that the table would be\nbroken to pieces. In vain we withdrew from the table, hoping to\ndiminish the power. The heavy blows increased in intensity, and\nthe whole room shook with their force. The direst penalties were\nthreatened if we again interfered with the development by bringing in\nnew sitters. We have not ventured to do so again ; and I do not think\nwe shall easily be persuaded to risk another similar objurgation.\n\" M r. Serjeant Cox 2 records a curious instance of the exercise of this\nforce, in the second volume of his very interesting work, \" What am\n11 In the cases specified above, the table was a small square one,\nfirmly placed on four legs, and weighing about 40ib. The dining-\ntable of Serjeant Cox, on the contrary, was very massive ; so heavy,\nthat the united exertions of two strong men were required to move it.\nThe experiment is so curious that I extract the account :\u2014\n\" On Tuesday, June 2nd, 1873, a personal friend came to my residence in\nRussell Square to dress for a dinner party to which we were invited. He\nhad previously exhibited considerable power as a Psychic. Having half an\nhour to spare, we went into the dining-room. It was just six o'clock, and\nof course broad daylight. I was opening letters ; he was reading the Times.\nMy dining-table is of mahogany, very heavy, old-fashioned, six feet wide,\nnine feet long. It stands on a Turkey carpet, which much increases the\ndifficulty of moving it. A subsequent trial showed that the united efforts\nof two strong men standing were required to move it one inch.

Stainton Moses.\nno cloth upon it, and the light fell full under it. No person was in the room\nbut my friend and myself. Suddenly, as we were sitting thus, frequent and\nloud rappings came upon the table. My friend was then sitting holding the\nnewspaper with both hands, one arm resting on the table, the other on the\ntack of chair, and turned sideways from the table, so that his legs and feet\nwere not under the table, but at the side of it. Presently the solid table\nquivered as if with an ague fit. Then it swayed to and fro so violently as\nalmost to dislocate the big pillar-like legs, of which there are eight. Then\nit moved forward about three inches. I looked under it to be sure that it\nwas not touched : but still it moved, and still the blows were loud upon it.\n\"This sudden access of the Force at such a time and in such a place,\nwith none present but myself and my friend, and with no thought then of\ninvoking it, caused the utmost astonishment in both of us. My friend said\nthat nothing like it had ever before occurred to him. I then suggested that\nit would be an invaluable opportunity, with so great a power in action, to\nmake trial of motion without contact, the presence of two persons only, the\ndaylight, the place, the size and weight of the table, making the experiment\na crucial one. Accordingly we stood upright, he on one side of the table,\nI on the other side of it. We stood two feet from it, and held our hands\neight inches above it. In one minute it rocked violently. Then it moved\nover the carpet a distance of seven inches. Then it rose three inches from\nthe floor on the side on which my friend was standing. Then it rose equally\non my side. Finally my friend held his hands four inches over the end of\nthe table, and asked that it would rise and touch his hand three times. It\ndid so ; and then, in accordance with the like request, it rose to my hand\nheld at the other end to the same height above it and in the same manner.\"\n\" Another singular instance occurred during a visit that I made to\na gentleman interested in this subject.. After some conversation, it was\nsuggested that we should try the effect of placing our hands on a pillar\nwork-table belonging to his wife. It was filled with reels and tapes,\nand the appliances of needlework. We had scarcely touched it when\nit began to move. It danced about like a live thing ; executed a series\nof gyrations, first on one foot and then on another ; and finally lay\ndown on the floor and jerked all its contents about the room. It rose\nagain unaided, bounded off the floor, and waltzed round the room.\nWhen it was still I held my hand over it, and it began to quiver, and\nfinally rose from the floor until it touched my hand, which was ten or\ntwelve inches above it. It afterwards rose to the height of eighteen\ninches or two feet. While this was going on, a column of. light was\nvisible over it.\n\"Once more, motion without contact, directed by evident intelligence,\nis seen markedly in the following instance :\u20141 was calling on a friend,\nand the conversation fell on the phenomena of Spiritualism. A sitting\nwas proposed, and nothing, or almost nothing, occurred. We were\nquite alone in the room, which was well lighted. We drew back from\nthe table, intending to give up the attempt. My friend asked why\nnothing occurred. The table, untouched by us, rose and gently touched\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stuinton Moses. 2G1\nmy throat and chest three times. I was suffering from severe bronchial\nsymptoms, and was altogether below par. After this no rap or move\nment could be elicited, and we were fain to accept the explanation of\nour want of success.\n\" My first personal experience of levitation was about five months\nafter my introduction to Spiritualism. Physical phenomena of a very\npowerful description had been developed with great rapidity. We were\nnew to the subject, and the phenomena were most interesting. After\nmuch movement of objects, and lifting and tilting of the table, a small\nhand organ, a child's plaything, was floated about the room, making a\nmost inharmonious din. It was a favourite amusement with the little\nPuck-like invisible who then manifested. One day (August 30th, 1872)\nthe little organ was violently thrown down in a distant corner of the\nroom, and I felt my chair drawn back from the table and turned into\nthe comer near which I sat. It was so placed that my face was turned\naway from the circle to the angle made by the two walls. In this\nposition the chair was raised from the floor to a distance of, I should\njudge, twelve or fourteen inches. My feet touched the top of the\nskirting-board, which would be about twelve inches in height. The\nchair remained suspended for a few moments, and I then felt myself\ngoing from it, higher and higher, with a very slow and easy movement.\nI had no sense of discomfort nor of apprehension. I was perfectly\nconscious of what was being done, and described the process to those\nwho were sitting at the table. The movement was very steady, and\noccupied what seemed a long time before it was completed. I was\nclose to the wall, so close that I was able to put a pencil firmly against\nmy chest, and to mark the spot opposite to me on the wall-paper. That\nmark, when measured afterwards, was found to be rather more than\nsix feet from the floor, and, from its position, it was clear that my head\nmust have been in the very corner of the room, close to the ceiling. I\ndo not think that I was in any way entranced. I was perfectly clear\nin my mind ; quite alive to what was being done, and fully conscious\nof the curious phenomenon. I felt no pressure on any part of my body,\nonly a sensation as of being in a lift, whilst objects seemed to be passiDg\naway from below me. I remember a slight difliculty in breathing, and\na sensation of fulness in the chest, with a general feeling of being\nlighter than the atmosphere. I was lowered down quite gently, and\nplaced in the chair, which had settled in its old position. The measure\nments and observations were taken immediately, and the marks which\nI had made with my pencil were noted. My voice was said at the\ntime to sound as if from the corner of the room, close to the ceiling.\n\" This experiment was more or less successfully repeated on nine\nother occasions. On the 2nd September, 1872, I see from my records\nthat I was three times raised on to the table, and twice levitated in the\n\f2G2 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ncorner of the room. The first movement on to the table was very\nsudden\u2014a sort of instantaneous jerk. I was conscious of nothing until\nI found myself on the table\u2014my cltair being unmoved. This, under\nordinary circumstances, is what we call impossible. I was so placed\nthat it would have been out of my power to quit my place at the table\nwithout moving my chair. In the second attempt I was placed on the\ntable in a standing posture. In this case I was conscious of the with\ndrawal of my chair and of being raised to the level of the table, and\nthen of being impelled forward so as to stand upon it. I was not\nentranced, nor was I conscious of any external pressure. In the third\ncase I was thrown on to the table, and from that position on to an\nadjacent sofa. The movement was instantaneous, as in the first\nrecorded case ; and though 1 was thrown to a considerable distance,\nand with considerable force, I was in no way hurt. At the time that\nI lay on the sofa I felt the chair in which I had been sitting, and\nwhich would be four feet from where I lay, come and press my back\nseveral times. It was finally placed on the table.\n\" The levitations were of a character similar to the one described\nbefore, with the addition of one very important particular. On the\nwall behind my chair was an oil-painting in an old-fashioned massive\nframe. The frame projected from the wall far enough to allow my arm\nto rest upon it, as my dust-covered sleeve afterwards testified. This\nframe was about eight inches from the ceiling. I remember distinctly\nbeing raised until my hand touched the top of this frame. I was then\nturned round, and my body was longitudinally extended over the table\nuntil my feet were close to the head of one of the sitters. I remained\nin that position long enough for it to be carefully ascertained by passing '\nthe hand over my feet and legs. In this case the lowering to the\nground took place rapidly and suddenly : I surmise, from the fact of\nmy feet and legs having been touched. This demonstration, which had\nagitated me, closed the seance ; and while we were preparing to leave\nthe room another display of force under well-ascertained conditions\ntook place. We had risen from the table, and one of the party was\nnear the door. A chair was close to his right hand; I was three yards\nfrom him, when suddenly, from the corner in which I had been sitting,\na footstool darted across the room as though it had been violently\nkicked, struck the chair near the door, and knocked it down with a\ngreat clatter. I saw the occurrence, which was in fair light, and very\nconvincing as a display of force. The footstool ran along the floor as\nthough it had been forcibly kicked ; and started from a corner near\nwhich no human being was standing.\n\"These phenomena of levitation have presented themselves on a few\n,other occasions ; but the most marked instances have been those above\n,described. I have discouraged them as much as possible, from a dislike\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 263\nto violent physical manifestations. I have little power to prevent a\nspecial kind of manifestation, and none whatever to evoke any that I\nmay desire ; but I do, as far as I can, prevent the very uncomfortable\nphenomena which at this period were so strongly developed. On\nseveral occasions my chair has been raised from the ground slightly.\nI have always checked any attempt to raise it beyond a few inches,\neither by request, or by rising from it, and so checking the manifesta\ntion. In the instances recorded above I was a passive agent, and did\nnot aid or check the exhibition of the force. . . .\n\" In dealing with the movement of objects within a closed room\nwithout the intervention of human agency, I make reference to the\nfirst startling manifestation which occurred in my presence. The date\nwas August 18th, 1872, and the occurrence was detailed at the time\nin the columns of the Medium, as well as in the Liverpool Mercury.\nOur circle had not met more than half-a-dozen times, and no results\nhad been elicited beyond raps and movement of the table. On the\nday named a remarkable access of the force was manifest throughout\nthe day, commencing with raps on the table during breakfast. The\nday was Sunday, and we all went to church. On returning I found\non entering my bedroom, which adjoined the drawing-room on the\nfirst floor, that three articles had been so placed on the bed as to\nform an imperfect cross. My attention was drawn to them by loud\nraps which followed me round the room. I called my friend, whose\nguest I then was, and he observed the position of the articles, and\nheard the loud rappings which followed me from chair to chair, as I\nwent round the room by way of experiment. Even whilst I was in the\nroom another article was brought and added to the cross. We thought\nit well to establish beyond doubt the intervention of an agency not\nhuman. As yet, though we ourselves had no doubt as to the agency\nat work, still there was no conclusive proof that children or servants\nmight not have hoaxed us. To be sure, they could not make the raps,\nseeing that my friend and I were alone in the room, but we thought it\nwell to exclude the possibility of such an explanation. Accordingly we\nsearched the room throughout\u2014it contained no cupboards\u2014bolted the\nwindow, and locked the door, my friend and host pocketing the key.\nAt lunch our conversation was annotated by clear raps, and distinct\nevidence of the presence of the force was never absent. As soon as\nlunch was over we went to the locked room, and found two more\narticles added. The room was again searched, and again locked by my\nfriend, who retained the key in his possession throughout, and we\nreturned to the dining-room. Raps loud and constant followed us,\nand the heavy dining-table, with all its load of dessert and decanters\nand glasses, was moved several times out of its place. Another visit\nof inspection discovered other additions, and this went on until 5 p.m.,\n\f264 The Experiences of W. Stuinton Moses.\nwhen a complete cross extending the whole length of the bed was\nmade entirely of little articles from my toilet-table. My friend, his\nwife, and myself were together all the afternoon, so we were not the\nunconscious authors of the mystery. The door was locked and the key\nnever left my host's pocket, so no human being played a trick. Indeed,\nthere was no one who could or would do so. The room was in a public\npart, next to the drawing-room. The children were with us, and were\nincapable of such tricks. The servants were old and trusted, and knew\nnothing of Spiritualism, nor of what was going on. Independently,\ntherefore, of the messages which were constantly being given through\nout the day, and of the direct writing which informed us of the reason\nfor this remarkable manifestation, we are able to assert with confidence\nthat human intervention was impossible. The formation of that cross,\nby a slow process of growth in a locked room, during a bright August\nafternoon in broad sunlight, remains in my mind one of the most\nremarkable instances of assured intervention by invisible agency with\nwhich I am acquainted. Nor is it the less remarkable that it occurred\nat the very outset of my experience, while I was yet comparatively new\nto the subject, as though to overthrow scepticism by one fatal blow,\nand to furnish by anticipation an answer to the theory lately put\nforward by Mr. Serjeant Cox : ' Psychics are developed. Their power\ngrows with practice. The phenomena are not produced immediately\nand together, but by slow degrees. None of liiem has found himself\nsuddenly possessed of the power to produce any but the commonest indi\ncations of its presence.1 (The italics are mine.) Here was no circle\nformed for the purpose of eliciting phenomena. I had undergone no\nprocess of development ; and though I object to the use of the word\n' produce,' seeing that it is not properly applicable, still what was then\nproduced was by no means ' the commonest indication of the presence '\nof the force.\n[I subjoin an account of this incident by Dr. Speer, found by Mrs. Speer\non a loose sheet of paper. He had apparently made the sketches, which\nwere reproduced by Mr. Moses in Light for February 19th, 1892, but which\nI deem it needless to give here.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nAugust 17th, 1872.\u2014On this day the Rev. W. S. Moses, self, and wife\nresumed our evening seances. We chose the back dining-room of the\nhouse, which we had only entered a few days previous ; the table being\na heavy square table with a deal top and having oilcloth sewn over it. We\nhud scarcely drawn our chairs up to the table and laid our hands on it,\nwhen it was violently tilted up two or three times, Mrs. S. being so\nastonished, if not alarmed, at the sudden and violent nature of the move\nment as to express a wish that it might not be repeated. Raps of various\nkinds now began all around Sir. M. ; on his chair, in the centre of the table,\non the floor, &o. Thuds were also heard in various places, and scrapings on\nthe floor\u2014in fact, as many as seven different kinds of sound were heard.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 265\nMr. M. was moved away from the table, turned round in his chair, and\npushed against the wall. He was then brought up to the table. The table\nwas then moved half round without being touched, it lifted itself up again,\nand on questions being asked as to who was present and the nature of the\nspirits, we were informed that there were forty-nine spirits present, that all\nwere good, and were commissioned to take charge of the sitters.\nOn Sunday morning, August 18th, 1872, my wife and family, and the\nRev. W. Moses, who had only arrived on Friday night, went to St. George's\nChurch, Douglas, Isle of Man. On returning, the latter went into his\nbedroom, and immediately came out and called me to witness the manner in\nwhich during his absence certain articles of toilet, &c., to wit, a writing-case,\na fly-book, and a pocket note-book, had been symmetrically placed on the\ncentre of the bed. We at once noticed the crucial appearance exhibited and\nhazarded a guess as to the intention thereof. We left the room and shortly\nafter returned, when we found that a skull cap lying on the chest of\ndrawers had been placed on the bed post, while the clerical white\ncollar which Mr. M. had removed not many minutes before had been placed\nlike a halo around the upper portion of the developing cross (fig. 2). (It\nshould here be noticed that our expressed surmises as to the design\napparently in progress were confirmed by various loud distinct raps on the\nfoot-board.) We again left the room for a time, and found that now the\nlower limb of the cross had been lengthened by the addition of two ivory-\nbacked clothes-brushes (fig. 3). We descended to dinner, having locked the\ndoor and taken the key with us. After dinner and while sitting round the\ntable at dessert, the conversation naturally (on the children leaving) reverted\nto these extraordinary proceedings, when immediately manifestations com\nmenced all around Mr. Moses, raps on the table, thuds on the floor, raps, loud\nand repeated, on the back of his chair. A tune played on the table with my\nfingers was accurately imitated, the table with all on it was moved out of\nits place and everything shaken. This was put a stop to by request, but the\nmilder phenomena persisted, and, it may be said once for all, continued till\n9 p.m. Mr. M. suggested that I should go up to his room again. I did so,\nand found on unlocking the door that two paper-knives had been placed like\nrays to the right and left of the cross bar of the cross (fig. 4). I again\nlocked the door, put the key in my pocket, and came downstairs. In about\nhalf-an-hour we returned and found that two additional articles had been\nappended (fig. 5). We again left and locked the door, and on return after\nanother half-hour the cross had been fully developed into halo and rays,\nwhile the skull cap had been placed above all as in a crown (fig. 6). During\neach examination, as before, our comments had been acknowledged by raps,\nand now, as we meditated going to church, we canvassed the propriety of\nremoving the articles from the bed, in the event of the servants wishing to\narrange the room for the night. It now occurred to Mrs. S. that before doing\nso an opportunity of communicating by writing should be afforded, and\naccordingly a piece of paper and an aluminium pencil were placed on the bed.\nWe retired, locked the door, and on returning shortly ascertained that\nnothing within had taken place. A piece of red flannel was then placed\nunder tho paper and wo again retired, myself being the last again to leave,\nand locking the door behind me. On returning we found that the paper had\nbeen written upon (tig. 7). To us the initials were unknown, but Mr. M. at\n\f206 The Experiences of W. Stainton Hoses.\nonce pronounced the monogram to be that of two friends, man and wife, botb\ndeparted, and one of whom had been buried on the Tuesday previous. The\nother initials [confusedly given] were those of a long-departed cousin, who\nin his lifetime had been strongly attached to Mr. M. The number 46 at first\nsight was puzzling, but taken in connection with the three autographs, it at\nonce explained the assertion of the spirits that there had been 49 present\non the previous evening. Before replacing the various articles Mr. M.\nsuggested that although the alphabet had hitherto been invariably refused\nit might now be acceptable as a means of explaining these phenomena. On\nasking the question the answer was now in the affirmative, and the alphabet\nbeing called out by myself and the message taken down by Mr. Moses,\nwe received the following :\u2014\nCross. We are happy.\n\" I come now to deal with the carrying of objects into a locked\nroom, and the passage of solid objects through material obstacles.\n\"The days immediately following the day above mentioned (August\n18th) were filled with instances of such phenomena. I have before\nnoticed the prevalence at certain times of certain phenomena ; and\nhave stated my belief that this is due to the operation for a time of a-\nparticular communicating spirit, who gives place in turn to another,\nwho produces a different manifestation. This was so at this time. My\nrecords of seances during the latter half of the month of August\nshow over fifty instances in which objects from different parts of the\nhouse were placed upon the table round which we were sitting. They\nwere invariably small, and were generally thrown on the table ; such\nof them, however, as would easily break were placed quietly, and our\nattention was drawn to them by a request for light. They came\nfrom all parts of the house indifferently, and even from outside ; from\nmy own bed-room, and from rooms which I had never entered ; whilst\nwe were sitting with joined hands in expectation of some such occur\nrence ; and whilst no seance was being held, and our minds were not\ndirected to the subject. It is in vain to attempt any exhaustive\nrecord. I have not space for it ; and it would be but a wearisome\niteration of a ten times told tale. It will suffice if I mention some\ninstances, and dwell more particularly on the most remarkable cases\nwhich I have observed.\n\"Our seances immediately after August 1 8th began to show instances\nof this phenomenon ; and on the 21st a curious instance of it, and of\nintelligent comment on conversation, occurred. The room in which we\nused to meet opened by folding doors into the dining-room. In this\nlatter room my host and I were sitting in the twilight at the open\nwindow, talking of the subject, and wondering much whether we were\ndeceived. Raps came, and we were told to go into the next room. We\nstood by the table, and raps came again. ' To convince ' was spelt\nout, and a small copy of Paradise Lost was gently placed on the table.\n\fdR. STANHOPE TEMPLEMAN SPEER.\n\f\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 267\nWe had all of us had it in our hands during the evening, and could\ntestify to its position on a book-shelf close to the window at which I\nand my friend had been sitting.\n\" On August 28th seven objects from different rooms were brought\ninto the seance-room ; on the 30th, four, and amongst them a little\nbell from the adjoining dining-room. We always left gas brightly\nburning in that room and in the hall outside, so that if the doors were\nopened even for a moment a blaze of light would have been let into the\ndark room in which we sat. As this never happened we have full\nassurance from what Dr. Carpenter considers the best authority, Com\nmon Sense, that the doors remained closed. In the dining-room there\nwas a little bell. We heard it commence to ring, and could trace it by\nits sound as it approached the door which separated us from it. What\nwas our astonishment when we found that in spite of the closed door\nthe sound drew nearer to us ! It was evidently within the room in\nwhich we sat, for the bell was carried round the room, ringing loudly the\nwhole time. After completing the circuit of the room, it was brought\ndown, passed under the table, coming up close to my elbow. It rang\nunder my very nose, and went round about my head, then passed round\nthe circle, ringing close to the faces of all. It was finally placed upon\nthe table. I do not wish to theorise, but this seems to me to dispose of\narguments which would put forward the theory of our being psycholo-\ngised, or of the object coming down the chimney, as an explanation of\nthis difficult subject.\n\"Another curious case occurred at a later date, October 14th, 1873;\nour circle of three sitting alone. An unusual length of time elapsed\nbefore anything occurred, and we were in the act of remarking this\nwhen a little Parian statuette from an upper room in the house was\nplaced on the table. One of the party made a request for one of our\nfriends who usually communicates, asking that he might be fetched.\n' We are doing so,' was spelt out by raps ; and as the sentence was\ncomplete and answered our thoughts, we ceased to call over the\nalphabet. However, it was called for again, and ' mething else ' was\nspelt. We could form no idea what this might mean. It was repeated,\nand after much puzzling it occurred to us to join it to the previous\nmessage, and it then read, ' We are doing something else.' (What a\nclear case of unconscious cerebration !) We were told to sit with joined\nhands, and very soon an odour like Tonquin bean was apparent to all\nof us. Something fell on the table, and light showed that there had\nbeen brought from my friend's dressing-room a snuff-box which had\ncontained Tonquin bean. The box was closed, and the odour was\nremarked before any of us had the remotest idea that the box was in\nthe room.\n\"With rare exceptions the objects brought seemed to come from\nT\n\f268 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nbehind me. I have noticed this in cases where something has been\nbrought from a distant part of the seance-room. It is the same when\nobjects are brought from without, except in certain cases, such as that\nabove noted. I have more than once been struck on the top of the\nhead by objects as they have been converging on the table, and on one\noccasion a heavy bronze candlestick, which was brought from the man\ntelshelf in a room near (January 25th, 1873), struck me a severe blow,\nthe effects of which remained for a day after. I will undertake to say\nthat I was not biologised on that occasion.\n\" Another exception to the rule of objects coming from behind me\noccurred lately. A friend [Mr. F. W. Percival] had joined our circle,\nand we sat in the dining-room, instead of our usual small seance-room.\nThe dining-table is very large, and he faced me with a good six feet of\nmahogany between us. He remarked that he had never been present\nwhen any object had been brought into the room from without, and\nsaid how much he desired to witness such a case. The request was\nmade, and, contrary to rule, promptly answered. A round stone from\nanother room was gently thrown from behind, so as to strike his left\nshoulder before rolling on to the table. The gentleman in whose house\nwe were [Dr. Speer] could testify to the exact position of the stone on\nhis study mantelshelf, and my friend had no doubt as to the direction\nfrom which it came when it struck him. Like the bell, its presence\nwas first manifested in a part of the room opposite to, and most distant\nfrom, me.\n******\n\"Hitherto I have described phenomena which my eyes have wit\nnessed,1 which have occurred while I was in full possession of my\nfaculties, and when my powers of observation were unimpaired. I come\nnow to a group, which, for convenience, I have classed together, where\nthe case is somewhat altered. I have, indeed, observed all the\nphenomena of which I speak at many different times, and under\nvarious circumstances, but not in their most perfect form of development.\nIn all cases where the large luminous appearances, which I am about\nto describe, were most successfully presented, I was in a state of\nunconscious trance. In a similar way, the most perfect musical sounds\nare made when I cannot hear them ; and, as a general rule, to which\nthe exceptions are so rare as only to serve to establish the principle,\nthe best and most successful manifestations occur when the medium is\ndeeply entranced. The condition of absolute passivity on his part is\nthen most perfectly secured, and the force which the operators use can\nbe more safely drawn off. Over and over again have I heard this\npassive state spoken of as an essential condition of success.\n\" The fact that I am entranced during the occurrence of the best\n1 These phenomena are said to have sometimes occurred in light.\u2014F.W.H.M.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 269\nmanifestations renders it difficult for me to give an accurate descrip\ntion. I have endeavoured to remedy this by requesting those who\nhave witnessed specially notable phenomena to favour me with a\ndescription of what they saw ; and I have been at pains to record a\nfaithful account immediately after each seance, drawing my information\nfrom the impressions left on the minds of the sitters. My own records,\ntherefore, contain exact accounts of what I have seen myself, and,\nfurther, of the descriptions given me by careful observers of phenomena\nwhich occurred during my entrancement. These sources of informa\ntion I have supplemented by accounts kindly furnished me, which I\nprint exactly as I have received them. As a consequence, I am able to\naffirm that my descriptions and statements are trustworthy, and\nwithin the margin of fact.\nSec. I.\u2014Perfumes and waves of scent-laden air.\n\"In every circle with which I am acquainted the conditions are\nharmonised by some means. Usually music is employed for that\npurpose. It seems to have the effect of soothing the minds of the\nsitters, and leading them to throw aside, for the time, thoughts of other\nmatters, while they dwell harmoniously on what is being attempted in\nthe circle. Whatever other effect music may have, I believe its sooth\ning property to be its chief merit. This harmonising is effected in our\ncircle by means of perfumes and waves of cool scented air. We are\nnever asked for music. If, very rarely, a musical box is set in motion,\nits only effect is to elicit a peculiar muffled sound in the floor, and to\ncause a vibration to be made in the room. By these sounds we know\nof the presence of a particular intelligence, who so announces himself.\nBut they are never asked for again, and they apparently have no\nharmonising effect. Singing is never introduced ; and any noise, even\nof loud conversation, is checked at once. We are told to keep still.\nBut when a,ny opposing conditions are to be removed, then the room is\npervaded by odours of subtle and delicate, or strong, perfume. If a\nnew sitter is present, he or she is censed (if I may adopt the expression)\nand so initiated. The chair which the stranger occupies is surrounded\nby luminous haze, from which issues the perfume ; and very frequently\nwet scent, more or less pungent according to conditions, is sprinkled\nfrom the ceiling at the same time. If a new intelligence is to com\nmunicate, or special honour to be paid to a chief, the room is pervaded\nby perfumes which grow stronger as the spirit enters. This scenting\nof the room in which we are about to meet will sometimes commence\nmany hours before we begin. Indeed, when we have been in the\ncountry, far from the polluted atmosphere of smoke and dirt, charged\nwith the nameless odours that London breeds, the air of the seance-\nroom is always laden with perfumes. There is a subtle odour in ifc\n2t\n\f270 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nwhich is perpetually being changed. Sometimes the aroma of a flower\nfrom the garden is drawn out, intensified, and insinuated throughout\nthe house. Sometimes the odour is like nothing of this earth's pro\nduction, ethereal, delicate, and infinitely delightful. Sandal-wood used\nto be a favourite, and rose, verbena, and odours of other flowers have\nbeen plentifully used.\n\"I find it difficult to convey any idea of the subtle odours that have\nbeen diffused throughout the room, or of the permanence of the scent.\nIt is usually the first manifestation and the last. The perfume is\nsprinkled in showers from the ceiling, and borne in waves of cool air\nround the circle, especially when the atmosphere is close and the air\noppressive. Its presence in a particular place is shown to me by the\nluminous haze which accompanies it. I can trace its progress round\nthe circle by the light\u2014and my vision has been many times corrobo\nrated on this point by other sitters\u2014and can frequently say to a certain\nsitter, ' You will smell the scent directly. I see the luminous form\ngoing to you.' My vision has always been confirmed by the exclama\ntions of delight which follow.\n\" When we first observed this manifestation, it was attended by a\ngreat peculiarity. The odour was circumscribed in space, confined to a\nbelt or band, beyond which it did not penetrate. It surrounded the\ncircle to the extent of a few feet, and outside of that belt was not\nperceptible ; or it was drawn across the room as a cordon, so that it was\npossible to walk into it and out of it again\u2014the presence and absence\nof the odour and the temperature of the air which accompanied it\nbeing most marked. Judge Edmunds [in his book on Spiritualism]\nespecially notes the presence of an odour which was not diffused\nthrough the room. He describes the sensation as being like a flower\npresented to the nostrils at intervals. I should rather describe what\nI observed as a scented zone or belt, perfectly defined and not more\nthan a few feet in breadth. Within it the temperature was cool and\nthe scent strong, outside of it the air was decidedly warmer, and no\ntrace of perfume was perceptible. It was no question of fancy. The\nscent was too strong for that. And the edges of the belt were quite\nclearly marked, so that it was possible, instantaneously, to pass from\nthe warm air of the room to the cool perfumed air of this zone. I do\nnot remember ever hearing of a precisely similar case to this, which\noccurred repeatedly.\n\" I have known the same phenomenon to occur in the open air. I\nhave been walking with a friend, for instance, and we have walked into\nair laden with scent, and through it again into the natural atmosphere.\nWe have gone back, and have found that the air in a certain locality\u2014\ngenerally a narrow belt\u2014was distinctly perfumed, while the air on each\nside bore no traces of scent. I have even known cases where wet scent\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 271\nhas been produced and showered down in the open air. On one special\noccasion, in the Isle of Wight, my attention was attracted by the patter\nof some fine spray on a lady's [Mrs. Speer's] silk dress, as we were\nwalking along a road. One side of the dress was plentifully besprinkled\nwith fine spray, which gave forth a delicious odour, very clearly\nperceptible for some distance round.\n\" During a seance the scent is either carried, as it seems, round the\ncircle, and is then accompanied by cool air, or it is sprinkled down from\nthe ceiling of the room in liquid form. In the clairvoyant state I am\nable to see and describe the process before the scent is sprinkled, and\ncan warn a special sitter not to look upwards. For, on certain occasions,\nwhen conditions are not favourable, the scent is pungent and most\npainful if it gets into the eye. At other times it is harmless, and causes\nno pain whatever. I have had a quantity of it thrown into my eye,\nand it has caused no more pain than water would. On the contrary, I\nhave seen the effect caused on another [Mrs. Speer] by a similar\noccurrence. The pain caused was excruciating, the inflammation was\nmost severe, and the effects did not pass off for twenty-four hours or\nmore. In fact, whatever the liquid was, it caused severe conjunctivitis.\n\" This variety in the pungency and potency of perfume I attribute\nto variety in the attendant circumstances. The illness of one of the\nsitters will cause the scent to be coarse and pungent. Harmonious\nconditions, physical and mental, are signalised by the presence of\ndelicate subtle odours, which are infinitely charming. I have said that\nsometimes the odour of flowers, either in the house or garden, will be\nintensified. A vase of fresh flowers put on the table causes the diffusion-\nthrough the room of one or more of the odours of flowers in the bouquet.\nI have observed the process of drawing out the natural perfume in this\nway. We used frequently to gather fresh flowers, and watch the pro\ncess. Flowers which had a very slight smell when gathered would, by\ndegrees, throw off such a perfume as to fill the room, and strike anyone\nwho came into it most forcibly. In this case the natural odour of the\nflower was intensified, and the bloom received no harm. At other\ntimes, however, some liquid was apparently put upon the blossom, and an\nodour not its own given to it. In that case it invariably withered,\nand died very rapidly. I have frequently had flowers in my button\nhole scented in this way ; and the phenomena to which I refer are too\nunmistakable, and have been too frequently observed, to leave any\nroom for doubt.\n\"Great quantities of dry musk have been from time to time thrown\nabout in the house where our circle meets. On a late occasion it fell in\nvery considerable quantities over a writing-desk at which a lady was\nsitting, in the act of writing letters. It was mid-day, and no one was\nnear at the time, yet the particles of musk were so numerous as to\n\f272 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\npervade the whole contents of the desk. They were placed, for no\nthrowing would have produced such a result, at the very bottom of the\ndesk, and between the papers which it contained. The odour was most\npronounced ; and the particles, when gathered together, made up a\nconsiderable packet. Some time after this, when at a seance, I saw\nsomething which looked like luminous dust on the table. .No odour\nwas perceptible, but in my clairvoyant state I saw a heap of luminous\nparticles which appeared to me extremely brilliant. I described it, and\nputting out my hand I found that there really was a heap on the table.\nI inquired what it was, and mtisk was rapped out. We demurred, for\nno odour was perceptible, but the statement was reiterated. After the\nseance we gathered up the dust, which looked like musk, but Iwd no\nsmell whatever. The next morning, however, the odour was powerful\nenough ; and the powder still exists, and is indubitably very good\npowdered musk. By what imaginable process can that phenomenon\nhave been accomplished ?\n\" I remember another occasion, amongst several, when, after a\nseance, I was walking up and down smoking a cigar. The odour of strong\nperfume was distinctly perceptible, in spite of the tobacco. On the\ntable lay a blotting pad of white paper. My eye fell on it, and I asked,\non the spur of the moment, whether some scent could not be sprinkled\nso that we could see it there. The request was at once and repeatedly\ncomplied with. The paper was drenched, and the odour from it was\nvery pronounced twenty-four hours afterwards. One of the astonishing\npoints connected with this matter is the quantity of liquid that is pro\nduced. The table is covered with innumerable stains ; and if they be\nremoved, another seance will renew them. The spray appears to fall\neverywhere, for the very fire-irons bear traces of its presence ; and I\nam quite sure that the housemaid's opinion of the manifestation would\nnot be complimentary to the invisible operators.\n\" I must omit much that might be said, but in conclusion I append\nan account of one remarkable manifestation, for which I am indebted\nto the kindness of a friend who was present. Our hands were all\njoined in a cluster in the middle of the table, and the quantity of\nliquid must have exceeded half an ounce at least.\nStatement by Mr. Percivaj,.\n\" In compliance with your request, I will describe as briefly as possible\nwhat occurred at the dark seance held on the evening of March 18th, 1874,\nwhen scent was produced so abundantly in the presence of Mrs. S. and\nmyself, while you were in a state of trance. The controlling spirit began by\nspeaking through you at some length, and we were told to expect unusual\nmanifestations. They commenced with a strongly-scented breeze, which\npassed softly round the circle, its course being marked by a pale light. In\na few minutes it suddenly changed, and blew upon us with considerable\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 273\nforce, as if a pair of bellows had been employed, and the temperature of the\nroom was perceptibly lowered. After this liquid scent was sprinkled upon\nus several times : it appeared to come from the top of the room, and fell\nupon us in small drops. Finally we were told that a new manifestation\nwould be attempted, and that we were to prepare for it by joining hands and\nholding the palms upwards. In this position we waited for two or three\nminutes, and then I felt a stream of liquid scent poured out, as it were, from\nthe spout of a teapot, which fell on one side of my left hand, and ran down\nupon the table. The same was done for Mrs. S. ; and to judge from our\nimpressions at the time, and from the stains on the table, a very considerable\nquantity must have been produced. I may remark, in conclusion, that there\nwas no scent in the room before the seance, and that we could distinguish\nseveral different perfumes which made the atmosphere so oppressive that we\nwere glad to seek a purer air so soon as the seance came to an end.\n\"F. W. P.\"\n\u00bb*\u2022****\n\" The first occasion on which we saw the large luminous appearances\nwith which we were for a time so familiar was on June 7th, 1873. By\nthat time we had become very familiar with the floating masses of\nluminous vapour which I have before noticed ; and on several occasions\nwe had seen these masses condensed, so to say, until a distinct objective\nlight was formed. On this evening, however, at an ordinary seance, I\nfelt my chair withdrawn from the table to the distance of three or\nfour feet, and I was partially entranced, but not so completely as to\nprevent me from recalling what happened. A number of cones of soft\nlight similar to moonlight appeared in succession, until a dozen or more\nhad been made. They presented the appearance of a nucleus of soft\nyellow light, surrounded by a soft haze. They sailed up from a corner\nof the room and gradually died out. The most conspicuous was shaped\nlike a mitre and was 8 or 9 inches in height. This was the first time\nwe saw lights of this description, and we determined to extemporise a\ncabinet for the purpose of developing them. This was simply done by\nthrowing open the door between two rooms, and hanging in the door\nway a curtain with a square aperture in the middle of it. On one side\nof the curtain a table was put for the sitters ; on the other side I was\nplaced in an easy-chair, and was soon in a state of deep trance, from\nwhich I never woke until the seance was concluded. What then took\nplace is described in the records of friends who were present. Large\nglobes of light such as I have described above sailed out of the aperture\nand went into the room where the sitters were placed. They are described\nas of the same soft, pale hue, like moonlight. They were sufficiently\nbright to illumine the lintel and door posts, and to cast a strong reflec\ntion into the room. Within the gauzy envelope was a bright point of\nconcentrated light, and the size varied considerably. The cone shape\npredominated, but some were like a dumb-bell, and others like a mass\n\f274 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nof luminous vapour revolving round and falling over a central nucleus\nof soft yellow light. They seem to have been carried in a materialised\nhand, a finger of which was shown at request by placing it in front of\nthe nucleus of light. Round each was soft drapery, the outline of\nwhich was usually perfectly distinct.\n\" I append an account kindly furnished me by my friend Dr. Thom\nson, of 4, Worcester Lawn, Clifton [now dead] :\u2014\n\"The manifestations began with a luminous haze surrounding a small\npoint of bluish light, which latter gradually increased in size, apparently at\nthe expense of the surrounding hazy envelope, as it seemed to diminish as\nthe point of light increased, till it attained the size of one's closed fist. At\nthis size it remained for some time, until one of the sitters expressed dis\nappointment at its not coming further into the room in which we were seated.\nThe mass of light then gradually enlarged till it became in bulk equal to an\nordinary sized water-melon. At the same time it approached us to apparently\nwithin 5 feet of where we were sitting. At this time the perfumes which\nhad been brought during the earlier part of the evening were again showered\ndown upon us. The appearance of the light reminded me strongly of what\nI have seen when an electric discharge is passed through an exhausted tube,\nwith the exception, of course, of the latter being momentary, whereas in the\npresent case the light continued more or less for nearly an hour. During the\nlatter part of the seance, the light emitted from this source was sufficiently\nintense to light up the whole of the doorway opposite to which we were\nplaced ; but it struck me that the intensity of the light was feeble as com\npared with ordinary light, as it did not extend beyond a few feet from the\nsource.\"\n\" I have reserved for separate description some very remarkable\nphenomena which occurred at four consecutive seances on August 9th,\n10th, 11th, and 12th, 1873. I was on a holiday excursion with the\nsame friends who have witnessed from the first the development of the\nphenomena that I have described. The weather was lovely, the scenery\ngrand, and, mentally and physically, we were in a harmonious condition.\nNothing heavier than the Spectator had engaged my mind, and my pen\nhad composed nothing more serious than a gossiping letter. No im\nportunate editor clamoured for ' copy,' and the stifling August heat of\nLondon was exchanged for the balmy air of a charming lough in the\nNorth of Ireland. Our days were spent in a boat, lazily flogging the\nwater to tempt the wary trout to rise\u2014exercise enough to invigorate\nwithout tiring, while the jaded mind took rest, and the body was\nrefreshed by scenes of beauty. It is under such circumstances that\nthe physique is in most perfect order, and the mysterious force which\nis used for these manifestations is generated most rapidly, while the\nharmonious mental state disposes to complete passivity. I do not envy\nthe possessor of a mind so ill-regulated and a body so dyspeptic as to\nfail of happiness in such surroundings. Accordingly, as might be\nexpected, our invisible friends were not slow to avail themselves of the\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 275\nimproved conditions. A synopsis of what actually occurred is carefully\ncompiled from notes written in detail at the time [by Dr. Speer], and\nwhich have been kindly placed at my disposal :\u2014\nStatement by Dr. Speer.\n\" On the 10th of August, after some other phenomena, a large globe of\nlight rose from the side of the table opposite to me, and sailed up to the level\nof our faces, and then vanished. It was followed by several more, all of\nwhich rose up from the side opposite to me, and sometimes to the right and\nsometimes to the left of the medium. At request the next light was placed\nslowly in the centre of the table. It was apparently as large as a shaddock,\nand was surrounded with drapery. At this time the medium was entranced,\nand the controlling spirit informed me that he would endeavour to place the\nlight in the medium's hand. Failing in this, he said he would knock on the\ntable in front of me. Almost immediately a light came and stood on the\ntable close to me. 'You see ; now listen, I will knock.' Very slowly the\nlight rose up, and struck three distinct blows on the table. ' Now I will show\nyou my hand.' A large, very bright light then came up, and inside of it\nappeared the materialised hand of the spirit. He moved the fingers about\nclose to my face. The appearance was as distinct as can be conceived. The\npower having become exhausted, he exhorted me to wake the medium, make\nhim wash his face and hands in cold water, and to tell him nothing till that\nhad been done. He also insisted on my writing a close account of what had\nbeen done.\n\" On the following evening I placed the paper containing the account on\nthe table, together with a pencil, and asked that the light might be brought\ndown upon it. This was done several times. The medium having become\nentranced, I requested the controlling spirit to append his signature to the\ndocument, if it were possible to do so. He said he would try. He then\nbrought a very large and bright light, and passed it up and down over the face\nof the entranced medium, so that I could see it distinctly. He told me that\nthe folds which I saw round the light were drapery, and to prove it he\nbrought the light and passed the drapery over the back of my hand several\ntimes. It was perfectly tangible. I asked that a light might be placed close\nto my face. He assented, and told me to close my eyes until told to open\nthem. I did so, and on opening them I saw close to my eyes a large and very\nbright light, the size of the globe of a moderator lamp. He told me to rub\nmy hands so as to generate more power, and very soon another large light,\nheld by a hand, appeared on the table. This time the hand appeared to be\noutside of the drapery, and moved the fingers about freely, and receded from\nthe light, as though the lamp were held in another hand. After other lights\nhad been shown, I heard the pencil moving, and repeating his admonition of\nthe previous evening, he departed, leaving on the paper a specimen of direct\nspirit caligraphy.\n\" I have omitted to say that the way of renewing the light when it grew\ndim was by making passes over it with the hand. The lights were of the\nkind described previously, and consisted of a nucleus which was said to be\nbrought by the controlling spirit, surrounded by a luminous haze, and an\nenvelope of drapery. They varied in size and luminosity, and seemed to be\n\f276 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nmore easily and fully developed when I rubbed my hands together or on my\ncoat. At one time a portion of a forearm was distinctly visible, and the hand\ncontaining the light was pressed very distinctly on mine as it lay on the table.\nI may add that all the cases recorded by me occurred when no other sitter\nwas present but myself. \" S.T.S.\"\n\"These strange phenomena have now ceased for some time past.\nThe drain on the vital strength of the medium was too great to be con\ntinued. As it was, the experiments made were attended by very great\nsubsequent prostration, and the phase passed away, as the levitations\ndescribed in Chapter I. ceased after a time. In the one case I strongly\nobjected to the manifestation ; in the other harm ensued. Both have\ntherefore ceased.\n\"Since the commencement of the present year we have had another\nkind of light altogether, which is still shown occasionally. It is\napparently a little round disc of light, which twinkles like a star. It has\na dark side, which is generally turned towards me, so that while other\nsitters have been carrying on a conversation, the answers being given\nby this light, I have not been able to see it at all. It is very much\nbrighter than the large light, and more like a star. It flashes with\ngreat rapidity, and answers questions by the usual code of signals. The\nlight usually hovers over my head, sometimes coming into the circle,\nbut more frequently floating in a distant corner of the room. It is not\napparently solid, nor does it seem to be surrounded with drapery.\n\" On a few occasions, not more than half a dozen, we have observed\na bright scintillating light, which apparently rests on the mantel-shelf.\nIt is about the size of a pigeon's egg, and looks like a large diamond lit\nup with strong light.\n\" I have reserved for the last a description of the most remarkable\nlight, of quite a different kind, that I have ever heard or read of. It\nappeared in greatest intensity on the eve of the year 1873, and has\nsince reappeared five times. On each occasion it diminished in\nbrilliancy, and when last it was seen had lost almost all its striking\ncharacter. It has not been seen for more than fifteen months now. In\nthis, as in much that I notice here, I rely for my description on notes\ncarefully taken at the time, and which now lie before me. When the\nlight was first seen I was so far under influence as to render my powers\nof observation worthless, and before it had attained its full dimensions\nand brilliancy I was deeply entranced. The description given by the\nsitters is fortunately very minute. The light was first observed directly\nbehind us. At that time it was a tall column, about half an inch or\nrather more in width, and six or seven feet high. The light was of a\nbright golden hue, and did not illuminate objects in its neighbourhood.\nFor a minute a cross developed at its top, and rays seemed to dart from\nit. Round my head was a similar sort of halo to that which clair\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 277\nvoyants describe round the heads of some persons, only in this case it\nwas perceptible by natural vision, for one of the sitters put out his\nhand to ascertain the locality of the rays which he saw, and placed his\nfingers directly on the top of my head. At this time I was not so deeply\nentranced as to be unable to hear what was said, and, at request, I\nmoved my body from side to side. As I moved, the ray moved with\nme, and the removal of my body discovered to the opposite sitter a\ncluster of scintillating light, of an oblong shape, about the size of a\nsaucer, at the foot of the long pencil or ray before described. As my\nbody resumed its position it hid the lower part of the long ray of light\nfrom view. Soon, however, the cross\u2014as it had then become\u2014com\nmenced to move, and gradually travelled from my back to my right\nhand, always on or near the wall, until it had passed over an arc of 90\u00b0.\nMy friend, who had been watching this strange phenomenon with\nabsorbing interest, requested to be permitted to examine it more closely.\nLeave having been given, he rose from his chair, went to the light, put\nhis face close to it, and passed his hand through it. He detected no\nodour, nor did the light disappear as he touched it. No warmth came\nfrom it, nor did it light up the room perceptibly. Both the long ray\nand cluster remained visible until the seance was concluded.\n\" The sound which has since developed to such an extent was first\nheard by us on March 23rd, 1873. At that time it resembled the\nplucking of a string in mid air. It was faint, and only presented\nitself at intervals. We called it the Lyre sound, for want of a better\nname, and could make nothing out about it, except that a certain\nimitation of it could be made by slightly touching the wires of a piano\nat the upper notes. Tt could have been more perfectly imitated by\nplucking the small strings of a harp, had one been at hand. I succeeded\nalso in making some resemblance to it by drawing my finger over the\nwires of a musical clock which hangs on the wall of the room adjoining\nthat in which we usually sit. This clock is distinctly audible to us in\nthe seance-room, and soon its sound was counterfeited to perfection.\nAlthough I could not exactly make out how it was done, I supposed\nthat the piano or clock must be used in some way to make a sound\nwhich seemed to be in mid-air. This theory was soon upset, for the\nsound came in rooms where there was no musical instrument ; even in\nmy own bedroom, where sometimes the sound has been so loud as to be\ndistinctly audible through the wall in an adjoining room. Two months\nafter its first appearance, it had become so loud that the vibration of\nthe table was very marked. The sound would traverse the room and\nseem to die away in the distance, and suddenly burst forth into great\npower over the table, which appeared in some inexplicable way to be\nused as a sounding-board. The wood of the table vibrated under our\nhands exactly as it would have done had a violoncello been twanged\n\f278 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nwhile resting upon it. It was no question of fancy or delusion. The\nsounds were at times deafening, and alternated between those made by\nthe very small strings of a harp and such as would be caused by the\nviolent thrumming of a violoncello resting on the top of a drum.\nSometimes in our midst, sometimes distant and soft, sometimes the\nbass and treble sounds alternating, the sounds were the most inexplic\nable that I have ever heard. When they once became established, they\nwere made almost continuously. We never sat without them, and they\nformed almost the staple phenomenon of the seance. With them, as\nwith other phenomena, great variety was caused by good or bad con\nditions. Just as illness or atmospheric disturbance made the perfumes\nand drapery coarse and unrefined, so the lyre sound became harsh,\nunmusical, and wooden. It seemed to be far more dependent then on\nmaterial accessories. The table was used until at times the musical\ntwang would shado into a sort of musical knock, and finally become\nan ordinary dull thud upon the table. Sometimes, too, we heard a\nvery distinct imitation, purposely done, I think, of a loose string.\nWhen things were not all right, the sound would assume a most\nmelancholy, wailing character, which was indescribably weird and\nsaddening. It was not unlike the soughing of wind through trees in the\ndead of night ; a ghost-like dreary sound that few persons would sit\nlong to listen to. That sound was always accompanied by black\ndarkness in the room, and we were always glad to take the hint and\nclose the sitting as soon as we could. We invariably found afterwards\nthat there had been some reason for this sadness.\n\" No point, indeed, connected with these strange sounds is more\nremarkable than the intensity of feeling conveyed by them. They\ncontrive to render all the varieties of emotion which are conveyed by\nthe human voice. Anger and sadness, content and mirth, solemnity\nand eagerness, are conveyed in a way quite inexplicable. In answering\nour questions sometimes an eager and rapid request for alphabet will\nbe struck out, the notes and the quickness with which they are sounded\nconveying precisely the idea of eagerness which a sharp interruption\nby an impatient listener would give. The wailing sounds above\nnoticed seem at times almost to sob and shriek as if in a burst of sad\nness. Sometimes to a question put silence will be maintained for a\nwhile, and then little, hesitating sounds will be made, very slowly and\ntremulously, so as to convey perfectly the idea of uncertainty and\ndoubt. Then again the reply will come clear, sonorous, and immediate\nas the ' I do' of a witness in the box who has no doubt as to the\nanswer he should give.\n\" As one instance amongst many to illustrate this intelligence in\nsound, I record the following. Following our usual custom, we had\ninquired as to the invisible intelligence which governed the sound, and\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. ' 279\nreceived full particulars as to his life in the body. These were so\nminute that I had no difficulty in verifying them from a Biographical\nDictionary. After we had become thoroughly used to the sounds and\nto the alleged maker of them [Grocyn : see later] a book came out\nwhich contained some incidental particulars of his life. It fell into\nthe hands of one of our circle, who read it, got up the facts, and took\nopportunity of questioning about them. For a time all was right ; but\non being asked whether he remembered a certain name which was\nlong and difficult to pronounce, a negative was returned. ' But you\nmust, I think?' 'No.' 'Why, he was your tutor?' 'No.' 'You\ndo not remember, but he was.' A tremendous irritable negative was\ngiven. ' The book says so.' ' No,' in violent, angry accents ; ' the\nbook does not say so ; and it is imperfect besides.' Other questions\nwere put, and answers returned in the same sharp, irritable tone,\nsometimes flatly contradicting, sometimes correcting, assertions made.\nAt last, calling for alphabet, the correct names were\u2014what shall I\nsay 1\u2014roared out ; and on reference to the book it was found that\nthey were correct. The names were long, and the questioner had\nforgotten and mispronounced them. No greater evidence of intelligence\ncould be conceived than this. The tone was just the tone of an excited\ndisputant, or of a man angry at having his word disputed when he\nknew he was right. I had never seen the book from which the queries\nwere propounded. Some of the facts given were not contained in it\nat all ; others which had been wrongly stated were corrected promptly\nand decisively ; and in no case was a slip made. I wonder where the\nUnconscious Cerebration came from then ? I do not believe any\nperson could have been present on that occasion, and have heard the\nanswers and the way in which they were given, without carrying\naway the conviction that a real individuality, with real feelings,\npassions, and mental attributes had been present, albeit invisible to\nthe eye of sense. And if he had talked with this invisible as often as\nwe have during more than a year past, he would have had no difficulty\nin bearing testimony to the reality of disembodied existence, and of the\nperpetuation of mental individuality and idiosyncrasy. I should have\nno more difficulty in recognising this sound again than I should in\nrecalling the features and voice of any old friend from whom I might\nchance to be separated. The individuality is not more real in one case\nthan in the other.\n\" But I am dealing with sounds now. Identity will come in its\nturn, and I shall be able to make out a strong case, I think. For the\npresent I return to the immediate question.\n\"The sounds used always to commence near the circle, and, so to\nsay, radiate from it as a centre into different parts of the room. Of\nlate they have changed, and are usually audible to me before they\n\f280 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nstrike the ear of any other person. How far this may be attributable\nto clairaudience, a faculty lately developed in me, I cannot say posi\ntively. But at any rate, they seem to me to commence by a distant\nrumble, not unlike the roll of a drum. This gradually draws nearer\nuntil it is audible to all, and the old sounds are in our midst.\n\"Nor are they confined to the seance-room, though they never occur\nanywhere else with anything like the readiness and intensity with\nwhich they are made in that room, into which no other but our own\ncircle who sit regularly is ever admitted. There they are finest both\nin tone and power. But they have been heard with great frequency\nin other places where we have chanced to be, in strange rooms alto\ngether, in different parts of the country where I may have been staying,\nand even in the open air, under very curious circumstances. We were\nat Southend this spring, where there is a pier more than a mile in\nlength. My friend [Dr. Speer] and I had taken our books and were\nsitting at the extreme end, looking out to sea, when raps came very\ndistinctly on the rail in front of us. We ascertained that the sound\n\u2022was there without doubt, and proceeded to experiment upon the\ndistance at which it could be heard. I placed my hands on the topmost\nrail, and my friend walked on, putting his ear to the wood from time to\ntime. The raps were clear and metallic, and well known to us at our\nseance. They followed us all along the pier, and were audible at a\ngreat distance, as indeed any sound is if made on a long wooden rail.\nThis was at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. At 8 p.m. we went on to the\npier again for the purpose of experimenting in a dim light. However,\na bright full moon shone overhead, and though it was quiet it was not\neven dusk. The clear metallic rap was plainly audible at a distance of\nfifty yards from me. As we were trying whether it could be heard at\na greater distance, the musical sounds rang out as clear and resonant\nas in a closed room. They were distinctly audible to both of us when\nwe were seventy yards apart, and were apparently made in the space\nbetween us. At any rate the sound was not near either of us, but\nseemed to come from a distance. Had the night been dark I believe\nthe sound would have been considerably intensified. As it was it rang\nout with all the characteristics which it possesses in a closed room, and\nthat at a distance of some 800 or 900 yards from land.\n\"Hitherto I have mentioned only the stringed musical sounds which\nfirst appeared and were gradually developed : the various sounds, as it\nwere, of a harp, from the tiny strings down to the deepest bass notes.\nBut there are other sounds which professedly emanate from the same\nsource, and which resemble the sound of a tambourine played over our\nheads, or, at times, the flapping of a pair of large wings. The tambourine\nsound hovers over the circle, and sometimes gets away to a distance,\nchanging almost instantaneously into the twanging of a string. Of\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stai-nton Moses. 281\nlate, other sounds, like those made by a small zither, have presented\nthemselves. They are very minute, rather metallic sounds, and are\nseven in number, graduated at regular intervals. I have never heard\na zither played, but I am told by those who have that these sounds\naccurately imitate that instrument. They are quite distinct from the\nsounds which I have described before. Unfortunately, I have no tune\nin my composition ; if it were otherwise, I have no doubt that actual\nmelodies would be played.\n\"The nearest approach to a distinct melody occurred on a late\noccasion. We sat on two consecutive evenings ; once alone, and once\nwith a friend who occasionally joins our circle. On each occasion the\nsounds were very marked. When alone, we sit in a smaller room, and\nthere the sounds come out most distinctly ; the sound as of a very\ntense string plucked by a finger nail. Three strings are distinguishable,\nand very musical were the notes produced from them. On the next\nevening these three strings were again presented, and in addition to\nthem, another set of seven, much less tensely drawn, and giving forth\na lower scale of sounds. I write without technical knowledge, and am\nsomewhat at a loss to convey my meaning ; but what struck me was\nthat these two sets of sound were graduated in pitch, and harmonised\nrelatively to each other. They represented two instruments, the one\nof three, the other of seven strings, and they were used in playing\nthus :\u2014Certain notes were sounded upon the three strings, and these\nwere followed by a run made as if by running a finger-nail rapidly\nover the strings of the other instrument. The result was like what\nmusical cognoscenti call ' a free prelude ' ; what I should describe as a\nseries of notes, highly pitched, clear, and liquid in their melody,\nfollowed by a rapid run on an instrument of lower pitch. I speak of\ninstruments, but it is necessary to state that there was in the room\u2014\nan ordinary dining-room\u2014no musical instrument of any kind whatever.\nI am indebted to the friend who has been most interested in observing\nthe phenomenon from its first appearance for the subjoined account,\nwhich supplements technical deficiencies in my own description :\u2014\nStatement by Dr. Speer.\n\" ' The sound which I am about to describe, which was heard in our\ncircle for the first time on March 23rd, 1873, has been one of the most\nconstant and persistent of all the manifestations with which we\nhave become acquainted since commencing our investigation into the\nphenomena of Spiritualism, having, during the space of fifteen months,\nalmost invariably presented itself at each sitting. By referring to my\nnotes I find it described as 'a sound like that of a stringed instrument,\nplayed, or rather plucked, in mid-air, while there was no stringed\ninstrument in the room.' Every attempt was subsequently made to\nascertain through what substance the sound could be evolved. Objects\n\f282 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nof every description were struck against one another -with a view to\nelicit a similar sound, but in vain ; and it at last became patent that\nthe sounds were formed independently of any material substance. In\nprocess of time, the character of the sound became more and more\nindividualised, and its locality more diversified. It would appear at\none time as though emanating from a distant part of the room, and of\nfeeble intensity. At another time, the first intimation of its presence\u2014\nI speak of it, as a phenomenon, but, as was subsequently shown,\nindicative of a presence\u2014would be the striking apparently of a tense,\nmetallic, or catgut string, over the centre of the table, and not un-\nfrequently upon the table itself. In process of time, the manifestation\nbecame most extraordinary. It was almost impossible (to an outsider\nit would have been absolutely impossible) not to believe that a large\nstringed instrument, e.g., a violoncello, a guitar, a double bass, or a\nharp, was struck by powerful human fingers. At times the sounds\nattained such a pitch of intensity as to be almost alarming ; as though,\nindeed, a double bass had been placed cross-wise over the top of a large\nregimental drum for a sounding-board, and then played after the\nmanner of a guitar\u2014viz., pizzicato. On these occasions the sitters\ncould distinctly feel a strong vibration transmitted from the points of\nthe fingers in contact with the table up to the shoulder-joint.\n\" ' Before long these powerfully resonant metallic sounds were\nsupplemented by sounds apparently made by .plucking the shortest\nstrings of a harp, and the two sounds would alternate with considerable\nregularity. Certain evidences of intelligence having been apparent in\nthe manifestations, we ascertained that the sounds were in truth\nevidences of the presence of individuals purporting to have long\nsince departed from earth-life. The intelligence was manifested first\nby answers to questions which were given in the same manner as the\nraps on a table, one, two, three, five, tfec. The peculiarity of the\nanswers was that the tone of the sounds corresponded in a most\nsingular and convincing manner with the nature of the response. In\nother words, the passions of individuals, as exemplified on earth by\ntones of speech, were here illustrated by the peculiar type and tone of\nthe musical sound. A harp was said to have been a favourite com\npanion of the departed when in the flesh ; and several attempts were\nmade to elicit actual melody at various times, but the medium not being\nof a musical turn of mind, this attempt invariably failed. By request,\nhowever, scales, octaves, and thirds have been correctly played, and on\none occasion an arpeggio was very fairly rendered, and repeated several\ntimes. S. T. Speeb.'\n\" I confess myself entirely unable to give any idea of the way in\nwhich these remarkable sounds are produced. That they are made by\nno material means I am certain, for they occur in places where no such\nmeans are available. That they are the means taken by an Invisible\nIntelligence for making his presence manifest is equally certain. Just\nas others take a peculiar form of rap, or a special handwriting, he\ntakes this musical sound as his symbol. How he makes it, I am as\nignorant as I am of the manner in which raps are produced on a table\n\fMRS. STANHOPE SPEER.\n\f\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 283\nwithout contact. To tell me that it is done by the exercise of will\npower does not help me ; and that is all the explanation I can get.\nThat the sound is objective is plain from the fact that all hear it\nalike; and if additional proof be wanted, it is found in the fact that the\ntable vibrates beneath the sound. It remaius one of the inexplicable\nmysteries which are none the less real objective facts because they are\nmysteries ; and for the explanation of which we must be content to\nbide our time. The fact is certain. Let the theory wait.\"\n[From this summarised account of the earlier phenomena I pass\non to citations from the almost wholly unpublished notes of Mr. Moses\nand of Dr. Speer, and from the published notes of Mrs. Speer (Light,\n1892-3). Mr. Moses' first note-book of physical phenomena (1 B), as\nalready said, is missing ; his note-book 2 B begins, as it happens, at\nthe same date as Dr. Speer's note-book 1, viz., on November 17th, 1872,\nwhen the little group met after an interval.\nThe period, April-November, 1872, covered by the missing 1 B is\ncovered also by Mrs. Speer's notes, and a few direct extracts from 1 B\nseem to have been printed by Mr. Moses in Light. I shall quote some\nof this early matter, giving throughout Mr. Moses' notes as the text,\nand Mrs. Speer's (signed M.S.) and Dr. Speer's (signed S.T.S.) in\nnotes. I may say at once that I have found no discrepancies of any\nimportance between the three series of records, although each narrator\ntends to dwell on a different class of phenomena. Mrs. Speer attends\nmost to the trance-utterances (which I do not here reproduce), and\nDr. Speer to the movements of objects without contact. Mr. Moses'\nown account is generally the fullest for such part of each seance as he\nwas in a normal state ; and where slight slips in dates, ifec., occur, Mr.\nMoses seems generally the most exact. In several cases one of the\nrecorders supplies some detail needed for the proper understanding of\nthe incidents which other recorders have given. None of the records\nattain, or can even be said to aim at, scientific completeness ; but by\nstudying them in connection, and noting incidental phrases, one can\nform, I think, a fairly accurate notion of what the recorders believe\nto have occurred.\nMrs. Speer's early notes describe the gradual way in which the\nphenomena began :\u2014\nMarch 1th, 1872.\u2014I was taken ill, and confined to my room for three\nweeks. During that time my cousin brought into my room for Dr. S. to\nread (she was tired of lending me books on the subject, seeing how little I\nwas interested) Dale Owen's last published work, The Debatable Land.\nI accidentally took it up, and began to read, and at once my indifference\nvanished, and I.read and re-read till I felt my mind and curiosity so aroused\nu\n\f284 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nthat I longed to get well and find out with the help of others whether the\nfacts contained in this, to me, wonderful book were true or false.\nMarch 2lith. \u2014I was able to leave my room, and on seeing our friend Mr.\nStainton Moses, I asked him to read the book and endeavour to discover\nwhether it was true or false. I had not been able to arouse my husband's\ncuriosity, as he was at that time almost a Materialist. Mr. S. M. had, up\nto the present period, felt as little interest in Spiritualism as ourselves, but\nimpressed with my great desire for knowledge upon the subject, he read tha\nbook, and became as anxious for information as I was.1\nOn June 3rd Mr. S. M. and self sat with Mrs. C. and Miss A. C. Wo\nthen had raps near Mr. S. M., and a few tilts of the table ; more than we had\nhad before. After this we met several times, Dr. S. and Miss K. joining our\nparty, but nothing ever occurred except slight rapping, always near Mr. S. M.\nI was getting weary of such constant failures, and my husband then proposed\nhaving the medium, Mr. Williams, to sit with us.\nAfter this stance we sat two or three times with Mrs. C. and her sisters,\nbut very little was elicited beyond numerous small raps, always in the neigh\nbourhood of Mr. S. M., who was by degrees developing into a medium, and\nwho with Dr. S. had attended several public seances, and had been informed\nat those seances that he would have great mediumistic power.\nAfter sitting at home with various people and getting very little result,\nwe became tired, and proposed one evening that we would try by our\nselves\u2014Mr. S. M., Dr. S., and self. Accordingly we did so on July 30th,\n1872, in the same room, and with the same table that was used when Mr.\nWilliams sat with us. For the first timo the raps became intelligent, and\nanswered a few questions. We sat again the following evening, under\nthe same circumstances. Raps louder and more frequent ; the table\nquivered and moved several steps ; raps also answered questions. \u2014M.S.\nThe phenomena improved during the summer ; and indications of\nthe identity of the communicating intelligences were occasionally given.\nThe subject of spirit identity will, however, be more conveniently dis\ncussed when the whole series of proofs, partly given by physical\nphenomena, and partly by automatic writing, shall be before us.\nDuring this summer, too, \" Imperator,\" the leading guide or director of\nall Mr. Moses' phenomena, announces his advent, although not yet\ngiving any more personal name.

A bright fire burned, and partially lit up the room.\nThe table used was a heavy round loo table, firm, and many times\nheavier than than the small table which we have been accustomed\nto use in the library, where we usually sit. Manifestations com\nmenced almost immediately. Raps loud and clear, but not so resonant\nas on the small table, creakings on my chair and on the table. Finally\nthe table rose, tilted violently until it rested on Dr. S.'s finger or the\nfloor. It followed my hands as iron follows a magnet, and was drawn\nbackwards on one occasion when it rested on the floor. I tried and\nfound that very considerable muscular effort was necessary to stir it\nat all. Yet it followed the passes of my hand. I found that my chair\nwas many times moved, and at length it rose in the air to the height of\neighteen inches or thereabouts, as near as I could judge. It then\ndropped to the floor, and I continued my upward journey until I must\nvery nearly have reached the ceiling. My voice was described by Dr.\nand Mrs. S. as sounding from the neighbourhood of the ceiling. Pre\nsently I came down, and a light was struck. My chair was found to\nbe some distance from the table. 'When the light was put out again\nmy chair was taken from under me, and placed after a time on the\ntable. It was a heavy chair, but was placed quite gently on the\ntable ; and glided towards Mrs. S. The light of the fire was enough for\nus to see it dimly. I again felt that I was moving, and I walked away\nto the end of the room to break the circle. Another table near me\nthen began to move, and I called for a light, objecting to any more\nknocking about.\nWhen we darkened the room again I called for Imperator, who had\nnever rapped all the evening. He came at last, but only rapped a\nfew times very faintly.1\nBells, rings, tubes, paper, pencil, &c., placed on table. Commenced at\n8 p.m., and sat 40 minutes without any result whatever. It was suggested\nthat Mrs. S. should join. She did so for 20 minutes, without any result.\nWe then adjourned for tea, and on returning sat for another hour, but\nwithout obtaining any results, although every change in the formation of the\ncircle was tried. We then broke up, and Mr. W. soon after departed. On\nMr. M. and myself going downstairs for a smoke, in about 10 minutes a\nshower of guimauve lozenges came rattling down on Mr. M.'s head, and were\nscattered all over the floor. They had been missing for several days past.\nMr. M. suggested a short seance without Williams. We again sat for\n20 minutes, and almost at once obtained results\u2014raps, turning of table,\ntilting of table. We had no theory to offer for this singular failure.\nNovember 28th.\u2014Seance\u2014same trio.\u2014Power very soon manifest. Aclosed\nbox placed on table, raps on table and box and in ditto\u2014table violently\nmoved several times, and struck each member in turn. Singular sounds\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 23D\nMonday, December 9th. \u2014 Seance as usual, Douglas House.\u2014\nImperator [name given by the leading control] came almost as soon as\nwe sat down. His knocks were, as usual, very distant at first, in\ncreasing in intensity until at one period of the evening the table\nshook as from a blow of a powerful fist. Dicky [name given by a\nfrequent control] had very little to do. He tried once or twice to get in,\nbut was shut up at once by a thud and retired creaking in an injured\ntone. Imperator professed his readiness to answer questions, and I\nproceeded to question him as to the source from which these mani\nfestations came.\nQuestion. Are these communications from spirits 1\u2014Answer. Yes.\nQ. Spirits of the departed 1\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Are you a spirit once incarnated 1\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You have been in the flesh ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Is the account given of these manifestations by spirits true 1\u2014\nA. I don't know.\nQ. Is what you tell us true ?\u2014A. Yes (emphatically).\nQ. Then are these manifestations from the spirits of the departed ?\u2014\nA. Yes.\nQ. There is no mistake about that ?\u2014A. No.\nQ. And you yourself are a departed spirit 1\u2014-A. Yes (three very\nloud knocks, startling in their intensity).\nQ. And others associated with you are spirits of the departed ?\u2014\nA. Yes.\nQ. Any who are not 1\u2014A. No.\nQ. Do you know the little French child who professed to be Dr.\nSpeer's sister?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Were you there when she came ?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Did Miss Kirkland come ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Was it Miss K. really 1\u2014A. Yes.\nemanated from box. Sawing closely imitated, ditto driving in of nails. Raps\nof Imperator soon heard, and became exceedingly strong, almost alarmingly\nso to a neophyte. Message : ' ' Stop.\" Seance then broken.\nSaturday, November 30th.\u2014Same seance. Raps, tilts as usual on table,\non a box placed on table, and on a suspended box, which box was twirled\nround and round several times without contact of any kind. Imperator\nmanifested loudly, as usual, but suddenly departed.\u2014S.T.S.\n1 December 3rd. \u2014Seance downstairs at large round table. Manifestations\nslow, some complaining of same ; the table suddenly tilted up with consider\nable force, and oscillated at a great angle. This occurred several times.\nMr. M. was moved about, and floated twice, and a large dining-room chair\nwas placed on the table. I, sitting in a large, heavy armchair, was for the\nfirst time distinctly moved.\u2014S.T.S. Sat in firelight.\u2014M.S.\n\f290 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nQ. Are you sure?\u2014A. Yes, yes.\nQ. Did you write that message the other night ?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Were you there when it was written 1\u2014A. No.\nQ. You did not come because Dr. Speer offended you ?\u2014A. Yes.\n(Dr. S. again apologised, and the apology was received with a series\nof stately raps, suggestive of bows.)\nQ. Then your absence let in an evil or lying spirit ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Are we liable to that ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then you do leave me ?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Not usually, you mean ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Then we must be guarded and careful to sit with solemnity, and\nfollow guidance 1\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. You are good 1\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. I solemnly charge and adjure you in the name of God that you\ntell the truth. Are you a good spirit, once incarnated in the flesh 1\n\u2014A. Yes.\n(Three of the loudest knocks I ever heard. We all involuntarily\ndrew in our breath, and a feeling of awe stole over us.)\nQ. It is true, then, that departed spirits can return. Do you know\nMr. C. ?\u2014A. Yes.\nQ. Is he here ?\u2014A. No.\nQ. Can you fetch him ?\u2014A. Yes.\u2014Do so.\nThe room, which had been filled (especially round me) with floating\nclouds of light, grew suddenly dark, and absolute stillness took the\nplace of the previous loud knockings. It would have been a strange\nscene for an ear-witness. The table, isolated, with no human hand\ntouching it, .giving forth a series of mysterious thuds of varying\nintensity, some of which might have been made by a muffled sledge\nhammer, all indicating intelligence ; an intelligence that showed itself\nby deliberation, or eagerness, or stately solemnity, according to the\nnature of the communication. Round the table three persons sitting\nwith a hush of expectation, and faces (if they could have been seen)\nof awe-stricken earnestness* a question put, and a loud response,\nanother, and a series, as though by a counsel cross-examining a dumb\nwitness. The room shrouded in total darkness, except at one end,\nwhere shifting masses of luminous vapour now and again gathered\ninto a pillar which dimly outlined a form, and again dispersed and\nflitted round the head of one of the sitters. No scene could be\nimagined more calculated to strike a novice with awe, none more\nsolemn and impressive for those who participated in it. The Witch\nof Endor was not more surprised when her unholy incantation evoked\nthe shade of Samuel than I was when Imperator in answer to my\nsolemn adjuration professed himself to be a departed spirit. I had for\n\fThe Experiences of W. Staintan Moses. 291\nsome time leaned to the opinion that the spirits\u2014if spirits they\nwere\u2014were not departed ones. Dr. S. had leaned to the same notion,\nso that the Unconscious Cerebration theory fails to meet this case.1 It\nmust be, I think, what it pretends to be\u2014a message of truth from a\ndenizen of the spheres, who has passed the probation of life and has\nbeen permitted to return to the world in which he once lived, and\nwhose communications, though imperfect, are sincere.\nAfter being absent about three minutes, Imperator returned, and\nhis commanding thuds drew our attention. They were at once followed\nby knocks of a different description to any which we had yet heard.\nWe inquired whether Mr. C. were present 1 Yes. Q. Are you the\nspirit of my old friend ?\u2014A. Yes.\u2014Q. Who died so-and-so, and so-and-\nso. . . 1\u2014A. Yes. Q. Can you give me any test?\u2014A. Yes.\nThe table then knocked TRINITY. It was a test to me. My\nfriend shortly before his death had been perplexed about theological\nquestions, and once had written to me to say he had been lying awake\non Trinity Sunday morning trying to realise the Trinity and had failed.\nHe asked me for an explanation of the doctrine, and I had written to\nhim on the subject.\nThe knocks ceased and Imperator returned. We requested that\nDicky might be allowed to tilt the table, and it was at once done ; but\nImperator soon stopped him, and bid us good-night. So closed a most\nimpressive seance ; in which the opinion of the intelligences themselves\ndeclared unmistakably for the Theory of Departed Spirits. Though this\nwould not form any strong argument to convince one who had made up\nhis mind in an opposite direction, still it must be allowed to have its\nweight Taken in connection with other collateral evidence such as the\nmaterialised spirit form, the strongly marked individuality which per\nvades communications from each particular spirit, the totally different\nnature of the knock in each case, and the fact of certain tests being\ngiven, the balance of evidence must be allowed to be strong.\nFor instance, I see a materialised form which bears resemblance to\na deceased friend (Step No. 1 ). I see that form standing by during the\nprogress of phenomena (Step No. 2). A knock different from any\nother is given (Step No. 3). That knock gives a communication\nwhich purports to come from the person whose form I see near me\n(Step No. 4). Questioned, that communicating intelligence asserts in\nthe most solemn manner that it is what it pretends to be, and per\nsists in that statement on being adjured (Step No. 5). On being\nfurther pressed a test known only to myself is given to prove identity\n1 Mr. Moses here fails to realise the possibility that opinions not held by our\nordinary selves may nevertheless be held and expressed by the unconscious or sub\nliminal part of our being.\u2014F.W.H.M.\n\f292 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\n(Step No. 6). That information is confirmed by other communicating\nintelligences, who knock with their own special knock, and are\napparently distinct individualities (Step No. 7).\nThis forms a strong link of evidence in favour of the theory\nadvanced by the intelligences themselves. On the other side is the\nmanifest fact that communications purporting to come from our\ndeceased friends are not always trustworthy, and that they are\ngenerally marked by evidences of intellectual weaknesses. It may be\nthat the falsehoods are traceable to lying spirits who personate spirits\nof good, and that the low order (intellectually speaking) of the com\nmunications may be accounted for by the tortuous channel through\nwhich they come and the medium through which they have been\nfiltered. But the explanation is not perfectly satisfactory. And\nthere is the additional stumbling-block that it is primafacie extremely\nunlikely that the spirits of the noble, the learned, and the pure\nshould be concerned in the production of physical and intellectual\nphenomena which, when not silly, are frequently mischievous, and\nwhen distinctly true are not new, and being new are not true. The\nargument that God permits for the establishment of a fading faith\nmanifestations such as these would satisfactorily dispose of all objec\ntions. A similar rough and ready form of argument would explain\neverything that is obscure and reduce all investigation as to the cause\nof things within very narrow limits. God permits it, or it would not\nexist. The fact that it exists because He permits it is no more an\nexplanation than would be the converse, that He permits it because it\nexists. Speculations as to the motives which sway the Deity are\nutterly fruitless, and presumptions as to what is or is not likely are\nworse than fruitless. I have seen enough to convince me that every\nthing is likely, and that nothing is likely ; and I have come to the\nconclusion that one fact is worth one thousand theories. No theory\nthat I know of will explain everything, simply because we are ex\nplaining a terra incognita and dealing with the impalpable, which we\ncannot grasp, and the unknown, which we cannot in our present state\nof existence expect to fathom.\nThe theory of the Spiritualists\u2014the theory advanced by the\nintelligences themselves\u2014is that which seems to me the roundest\nand most coherent. But \" round \" theories are suspicious, and the\nsuspicions in this case are aggravated by the manifestly untrue\ncharacter of many of the communications given by these intelligences.\nThe voice from beyond the grave is uncertain, and when it can be\ntested frequently delusive, if not absolutely and mischievously false.\nSo I fancy that a wise man will still return as his verdict, \" Not\nProven.\"\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 203\n[Mr. Moses came in a few months more to believe completely in the\nactual identity of the communicating intelligences. But this passage\nin his diary tends to show (what on other testimony also I believe to\nhave been the case) that he was by no means anxious to believe in, or\nto defer to, the claims of alleged '''spirit guides.\" His previous Anglican\nconvictions were very strong ; and his intellectual habit of mind in\nclined rather to the side of stubbornness than of pliancy.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nThursday, December 12<\/t.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and I.\u2014\nThe seance was short. I questioned Imperator as to a vision I had had on\nthe previous night. He said that he had appeared to me. He was some\nwhat different in appearance to what had been described. I asked\nwhether I should see him again. He knocked out : \" Watch.\" The clouds\nof light, which had gathered as usual round me, lifted and went to my\nright hand. They condensed gradually into a pillar, and fmally into a\nform, majestic, stately and noble in mien. The body was draped as with\na toga, though that might simply have been the spirit drapery. The right\narm was extended and pointed towards me. The face was the face of my\nvision, though not so distinct. I asked that I might be touched, and\nthe figure slowly stepped towards me, but did not touch me. Finally\nit faded away very gradually until it was dissipated in luminous mist.\nDr. and Mrs. S. saw misty light, but nothing more. I asked who\nit was, and \" Myself \" was rapped out in Imperator's knocks.\nMonday, December \\bth.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S., Mr.\nAug. Eves, and myself.\u2014Imperator never appeared. Dicky brought\nin two pieces of an ivory puzzle from the drawing-room, and a handful\nof sugar from the dining-room. The introduction of a new member\nutterly quashed all intellectual manifestations. This seems to me most\nundesirable, though in this case inevitable.\nDecember 16<A.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. Speer and self alone, Douglas\nHouse.\u2014Mrs. Speer explained to Mr. Eves that he must not join the\ncircle, as it was objected to by the spirits. We had no sooner sat down\nthan distant knocks of Imperator came.1 They increased rapidly in\nintensity, and the alphabet was called for at once. The knocks were\nvery loud, irritable and rapid. Several messages were given. \" If\nyou alter the circle I will withdraw all manifestations.\" \" It is\ndifficult enough without your making it harder.\" \" Never again, under\nany circumstances.\" On Mrs. Speer explaining that she did not know,\nthe irritable rejoinder came with knocks of vast power : \" You ought\nto have known.\" I remonstrated with Imperator on his violence, and\nhe knocked more quietly. Having more than once reiterated, \" Never\n1 Five knocks form a conventional request to have the alphabet spelt out, that a\nknock may be given at each letter of the intended message.\u2014F.W.H.M.\n\f294 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nagain,\" he told us to look under the table, and we found a piece of\npaper which we had put there perfectly clean, now covered with the\npencil marks of which the accompanying is afacsimile :\u2014\nHa I\nThe knocks were awful in their intensity, and so loud as to be\nplainly heard in the breakfast-room on the floor below. The com\nmunicating intelligence was of a most imperious description, little dis\nposed to brook opposition, and showed a power which gave one an\nuncomfortable notion that he was quite able to break our heads if it so\npleased him. Evidently the circle must not be added to without dis\ntinct permission. And no wonder. A delicate experiment may be\nvitiated by the most trifling alterations in conditions. And we know\nnothing of the conditions except that they are governed by laws of\nwhich we know little, which the spirits require before they can carry\non their higher work of intellectual manifestation. Interference with\ndraws the higher, and sends one back again to creaking chairs and\nphysical marvels. Imperator justly resents such interference.\nDecember \\9th.\u2014In the evening Dr. and Sirs. S. and self sat in\nthe study. After some knocks and tiltings, Imperator entranced me\nfor the first time in the presence of Dr. and Mrs. Speer. Mrs. Speer\nproceeded to hold a long conversation with him. She describes the\nvoice as quite unlike my own, very slow and measured, calm and very\ndignified. He said that he had influenced Mrs. S. to inquire into\nSpiritualism ; that he was here now ; that he (Imperator) had difficulty\nin communicating through me on account of my ill-health and want of\nperfect faith in the manifestations, or rather, in their origin. Psychic\nforce, he said, was true enough. He wished Dr. and Mrs. S. to sit\nwith me for ten minutes after he had left, so as to give me strength.\nSunday, December 22nd, 1872:\u2014Seance at Mr. Walter Crookes's,\n24, Motcombe-street, Belgrave-square. Present : Mr. D. D. Home, Mr.\nand Mrs. Walter Crookes, and myself.\u2014The only things that occurred\nwere owing to my mediumship and not to Mr. Home's. He was ill,\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 295\nand his mediuniship is very uncertain. Raps on my chair and in the\ntable occurred. When Mr. Home sang and played they kept time. The\ntable also moved twice. This was all.\nMr. D. D. Home is a striking-looking man. His head is a good\none. He shaves his face with the exception of a moustache, and his\nhair is bushy and curly. He gives me the impression of an honest,\ngood person, whose intellect is not of a high order. I had some talk with\nhim, and the impression that I have formed of his intellectual ability is\nnot high. He resolutely refuses to believe in anything that he has not\nseen for himself. For instance, he refuses to believe in the passage of\nmatter through matter, and when pressed concludes the argument by\nsaying, \" I have never seen it.\" He has seen the ring test, but, oddly\nenough, does not see how it bears on the question. He accepts the theory\nof the return in rare instances of the departed, but believes with me\nthat most of the manifestations proceed from a low order of spirits who\nhover near the earth sphere. He does not believe in Mrs. Guppy's\npassage through matter, nor in her honesty. He thinks that regular\nmanifestations are not possible. Consequently he disbelieves public\nmediums generally. He had read with great interest the Liver\npool Mercury letters [Autumn, 1872], and welcomed mo as the\n\"ablest exponent of a creed which was very dear to him.\" He said\nhe was thankful to know that his mantle had fallen on me, and urged\nme to prosecute the inquiry and defend the faith. Altogether he made\nquite an Elijah and Elisha business of my reception. He plays and\nsings very nicely, and recites well. He wore several handsome diamonds,\ngifts from royal and distinguished persons. He is a thoroughly good,\nhonest, weak, and very vain man, with little intellect, and no ability\nto argue or defend his faith.\n1873.\u2014The new year opens with a record of a very remarkable\nseance held by Dr. and Mrs. Speer and myself, in the study at Douglas\nHouse, on New Year's Eve. A number of strange spirits came, each\nwith its peculiar noise. We noticed the great number of strange\nnoises, and I knew by impression that strange spirits were present.\nDr. Speer was in the act of calling upon Dicky to bring him something,\nwhen a pair of salad tongs came down from the ceiling and struck him\non the head. They did not appear to have been thrown with any force,\nand seemed to come from a different direction to that from which articles\nare usually thrown. They generally come directly over my head, the\npower being concentrated there. In this case the tongs seemed to come\nfrom the ceiling nearly above Dr. Speer's head. Amongst the strange\nnoises that we heard was one very peculiar wailing sound. I succeeded\nin establishing communication and found that the Spirit purported to\nbe my old friend A. W. I begged her not to wail so. I fear she is not\nhappy She rapped out, \" Cross for you,\" Mrs. S. calling the alphabet.\n\f296 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nLight was called for, and before Mrs. Speer was placed a crucifix of\nblue enamel with a handsomely chased figure of the Saviour. It was\nunknown to all of us, and seemed to be of foreign manufacture.\n\" Wear it\" was spelled out. The next spirit gave the initials J. N. L. ;\nshe said that affinity had brought her ; we did not know her ; and she\nhad come to do us good. She managed to tilt the table, so as to rap\nupon the woodwork of Dr. Speer's armchair. The knocks were very\nclear and resonant, but gentle and firm in character.\nAfter this I was entranced by Imperator. He said that a great\nmany strange spirits had been admitted that night who had been wait-\ning to get into the circle. He had difficulty in speaking, not being\nused to it ; had left the earth for a very long time, and had come back\nto control mc in obedience to a direct mission entrusted to him. A\nquestion addressed to Imperator about a very remarkable spirit-light\nwas replied to by him to the effect that the bright halo of light\nindicated great spiritual power.\nThe light referred to was a very remarkable one. I regret very\nmuch that I cannot from personal observation describe the appearance.\nI was partially entranced when it appeared, so far that my powers\nof observation were worthless, and before it was fully developed I was\nin a very deep trance, from which I did not recover until the appearance\nhad vanished. The description given by Dr. and Mrs. Speer is very\ncircumstantial. Dr. Speer was the first to observe the light, which was\ndirectly behind me on the wall. Dr. S. faced me, and his eye was\nattracted by a line of light three-quarters of an inch in width, of a bright\ngolden hue, which for a moment developed in a cross and then took the\nform of a long line of golden light more than six feet in height. Round\nmy head was a halo with rays of light darting upwards, exactly as de\nscribed by clairvoyants on previous occasions. On this occasion Dr. S.\nsaid he saw light : was there any objection to his putting out his\nhand to feel whether it was over my head 1 He did so, and his hand\nwent straight to my head at once. The nimbus of light was formed\nbefore the concentrated pencil appeared on the wall. As I moved the\nray moved with me. Commencing near the door, between door and\nfireplace, on the floor there was visible a large cluster of light about the\nsize of a saucer, but more oblong. It was moved in conjunction with\nthe other, and remained for half-an-hour or more. (The cluster of light\non the floor was always in view. The long pencil of light was at times\nobscured by my body in its lower extremity.) The light on thewall moved\nround from my back to the looking-glass over the fire. It was not\nuntil Dr. S. rose from his chair to look over my head that he found that\nthe column of light rested on the floor. His view of it had been inter\ncepted by my body. The light was visible for more than half-an-hour.\nImperator on being questioned said that the pencil of light was himself;\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 297\nthe bright cluster of light was his personal attendant ; and other\nlights in the room were the band. Dr. Speer walked up to the light on\nthe wall, put his face within a few inches of it and passed his hand over\nit. The cluster of light on the floor seemed to be on the pedals of the\nharmonium. Both lights remained clearly in view until the gas was\nlighted and the seance terminated. 1\nJanuary Mi [1873].\u2014In the afternoon, whilst Mrs. Speer and I\nwere sitting in the dining-room, the gas being fully lighted, Dicky\nmoved the large dining-table, rocked it, and told us that he had lived\nwhen on earth in Lincolnshire. Whilst the musical clock was playing,\na heavy tramp passed round the room in time to the music.2\nJanuary 7th.\u2014Seance at 4, Worcester Lawn [Clifton]. Present :\nDr. Thomson and his son, Mr. Beattie, and Mr. Butland (the medium\nthrough whom the Clifton photographs were obtained). [Mr. Beattie\nand Dr. Thomson are dead ; and I have not been able to trace the\nother two sitters. \u2014 E\u00bbW.H.M.] The table was very fidgety, was\nmoved backwards and forwards, tilted, rocked, and finally floated\nto a height of about two feet from the ground. The movement\nwas very slow and stately, except now and again, when it was\nviolently shaken. The room was shaken throughout. Imperator\nentranced me and spoke to Mr. Beattie at great length about the\nphotographs, saying that they were not photos of spirits, but of\n1 December 31st, 1872.\u2014A very successful seance. A blue enamel cross\nwas brought, no one knew whence, placed before my wife, who was told to\nwear it. A pair of salad tongs of Sevres manufacture brought from drawing-\nroom through two closed doors. A column of light about seven feet high was\nseen to move round the room, and about two feet to the right of the column\nwas a large glowing mass of light. The column of light I placed my hand\nupon, as seen on the wall. High barometer, 30 ; dark. During the time\nImperator was entrancing the medium, and conversing with us through him,\nwe saw a large bright cross of light behind the medium's head, rays\nsurrounding it ; after this it culminated into a beautiful line of light of great\nbrilliancy, reaching several feet high and moving from side to side. Behind\nthis column of light on the floor was a bright cluster of lights in oblong\nshape. These remained for more than half-an-hour, and upon asking Im\nperator the meaning of the lights, he said the pillar of light was himself ; the\nbright light behind him his attendant ; and the numerous lights seen in the\nroom belonged to the band. The light around the medium's head showed\nhis great spiritual power. He also said in time we might see him ; might\ndo so now were our spiritual vision clearer. Imperator then closed the seance\nand the medium awoke unconscious of all that had been done.\u2014S.T.S.]\n2 January 4th.\u2014First appearance of Rector, known by his heavy tread all\nround the room, in full gas-light.

He gave a final inspirational address\non Progress, which is described as being extremely beautiful. Mr.\nButland in trance came round to me and went through an extremely\nelaborate pounding and mesmerising of my chest and throat. It was\na long process. He then (under the control of Dr. Elliotson) took my\nhand and joined it to Mr. Beattie's. This was in the dark. A very loud,\ngruff voice then said : \" Let the instrument sit at the table in light,\nand we will endeavour to entrance him again.\" Accordingly Mr.\nButland sat down, and we lit the gas. After a time he was again\nentranced. The process of passing into the trance was very painful to\nwitness. \"When entranced he rose and came round to me and stood\nover me. The face was upturned and the lips moved in prayer :\n\" Bless him,\" \" Guide him,\" \" Lead him in the right way.\" The hands\nwere outspread as in benediction. He then knelt by my knee, burst\ninto tears, covering his face with his hands, and finally fell flat on the\nfloor, and went through a semblance of dyinj. The hands were at\nlength folded on the breast, and the medium rose and impersonated\nanother character. This is a peculiarity of his mediumship. This time\nit was Mr. Beattie's mother. Then two friends of his who used to live\nin Clifton. The face and voice changed in each new control. One of\nthe latter, an old Presbyterian minister, said it would be better if the\nseance were opened with prayer. Mr. Beattie requested him to give a\nform. He turned round very reverently and bowed to me, or rather to\nImperator standing behind me, and said : \" The Great Spirit will give\nit.\" After a time the control passed and I was entranced again.\nDuring this time I spoke the following prayer :\u2014\n\" Holy Father, God Most High, he present with us and hear the\nearnest prayer of Thy children, crying after light. We are weak, but Thou\nart Mighty ! We grope in darkness after Thee, the Infinite Light. O God,\nThou Who art the Infinite Light ! 0 God, Thou Who art all-pure, nll-holy,\nguide us, Thine erring children, into purity and holiness ! Suffer us not\nto be led away by that which is earthly, sensual, devilish, but in Thine\nInfinite Mercy lead us onward and upward to the fountain of Eternal\nLight. O Thou good God, bo with us ! We ask no more. If we have not\nThee we are indeed bereft. Amen.\"\nThe whole seance was a most striking one. I regret again that I\ncannot record Imperator's trance-speakings, which Mr. Beattie savs\nwere most beautiful, reminding him of Home's finest trance-speakings.\nHe never saw such a seance, he says.\nDr. T. and I sat alone. The manifestations commenced at once.\nDicky brought a small croquet ball from the next room and a handful\nof lozenges from my bedroom. Imperator entranced me, and explained\nthat Miss M. had been the deterrent influence, not because of her\nunbelief, but from her tone of mind. My spirits could not come into\nthe room or breathe the atmosphere that surrounded her. He\n\fMR. CHARLTON T. SPEER.\n\f\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 299\n(Imperator) had sent a manifesting spirit to fetch the articles in order\nto show Dr. T. the power. He also gave information of peculiarities\nof my mediumship, its sensitiveness and high-class nature ; spoke\nfavourably of Mr. Butland, who was, he said, a very valuable and honest\nmedium.\nJanuary 9th.\u2014Dr. Thomson, Mr. Beattie, Mr. Butland and I\ntried for spirit photographs in the dark without success.\nJanuary 10th.\u2014Seance at Worcester Lawn, Clifton. Present : Dr.\nThomson, Mr. Beattie, Miss Jones, and a French artist, a friend of Mr.\nBeattie and myself.\u2014The manifestations commenced immediately. The\ntable was repeatedly floated in the air, two feet or more from the\nground, the raps were very loud indeed, Dr. Thomson and Miss Jones\nwere touched very distinctly, my chair was floated, removed from me,\nand I was placed in an armchair in a corner of the room. Articles\nwere brought from three different rooms in the house\u2014viz., some\nGuimauve lozenges from my bedroom, four dominoes from a box in the\ndining-room, and a heavy clip with receipted bills from Dr. Thomson's\nroom. I had never been in that room, and it is rare that articles are\nbrought from a room in which no psychic power has been left.\nI was entranced by Imperator, and gave a long address on the\ntemper and mind requisite for receiving communications and on\ninspiration. Lights were seen during the trance. All agreed that the\nmanifestations were the most powerful they had ever witnessed.\nJanuary Wth, 1873.\u2014Seance at Worcester Lawn. Present: Dr.\nThomson, Mr. Beattie, Mr. Butland, and self.\u2014Manifestations com\nmenced at once. The table was floated, loud raps came, my chair\nwas moved. Two things were brought out of a bag in my room, a\nrailway key and a foot-rule. The table was repeatedly floated, and\nremained suspended and waving backwards and forwards for a con\nsiderable time. Imperator entranced me, and gave an address on\nInvestigation and Proselytising, concluding with a very beautiful\nprayer.\nMr. Butland was then entranced, with less difficulty than usual, and\nrose from his chair with eyes firmly closed and with a peculiar gesture\nwhich Mr. Beattie recognised. He took paper and signed his initials,\nJ . E., indicating that the spirit of Dr. Elliotson was present. He is\nthe controlling spirit with Mr. Butland.\nAfter walking about for some time the face and mien changed and\nthe medium went through a death-bed scene. The face wore an\nexpression of pain, and the medium gasped for breath, put his hands\nover his head, writhed as though in pain, and went through a number\nof gestures indicative of dying. The face cleared, the expression\nbecame less painful, and the hands were put out as though on the\nheads of children. At last the hands were folded over the chest and\nx\n\f300 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nthe medium rose and came to Dr. Thomson and stood over him\nwith a look and attitude of great affection. He asked if it were his\nwife, who died in August last, and the face brightened and smiled eager\nassent. Asked if she were often with the children\u2014four little ones\u2014\nthe face assumed an expression of great maternal love and gazed\nupwards as though imploring a blessing. It was a singularly beautiful\nimpersonation\u2014Dr. T. told me that the death-bed was reproduced\nalmost exactly, and that he had no doubt that it was the spirit of his\nwife who inspired the medium.\nThe next control was by Dr. Elliotson, who went through a very\nelaborate magnetising of my throat and chest. Before doing so, how\never, he appealed with a deep obeisance to Imperator, who was standing\nbehind me, and asked permission. Having received it, he explained\nthat I was under the control of a very high spirit without whose per\nmission he dared not touch me. Having completed the operation he\nturned again, bowed low, and Imperator seemed to come forward. I\nfelt the presence of Imperator's touch. The spirit controlling Mr.\nButland was appealed to by Mr. Beattie as to a remedy which he had\nadvised for me, and again some three or four spirits were \"called in\nconsultation.\" Dr. E. said there were very many spirits who wished to\nmanifest, but he could not allow them, as it would hurt the instrument.\nMr. Beattie's father next manifested. He had been present before and\nhad communicated through the table, and had touched Mr. Beattie in\na way peculiar to himself. Amongst other things, he had given a\npeculiar Masonic knock, which Dicky caught up and was highly\ndelighted with ! | | | ~- | | | may represent it. After this\ncontrol ceased the medium's face changed to an expression of great\nsweetness. He came over and stood before me, and looked down on\nme with a smile of great affection. He then sat down on my lap, took\nmy hand and clasped it in both of his, straining it to him. Finally he\nput his arm round my neck and laid his head sobbing on my shoulder.\nThe sobs were so violent as to shake us both, and indicated delight\nrather than pain. The medium then rose and gazed with a rapt ex\npression upwards. The face was extremely beautiful. The arms were\nextended to heaven, and the lips moved in prayer. The arms were now\nand again drawn down on my head as though calling down angel minis\nters, and I was conscious of a very pure and soothing presence and in\nfluence. I have no doubt A. W. was the controlling spirit. I asked\nher if she were weeping for sorrow. She signed very earnestly \" No.\"\nI asked if I caused her pain, and she eagerly embraced me afresh.\nWas she near me often ? \" Always \" was faintly whispered. Could I\ndo anything for her 1 Apparently, no. Was she happy ? Yes. She\nturned and gazed again at me with a face of rapt, almost agonised affec\ntion, and left the medium, who was again controlled by Dr. Elliotson.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 301\nI inquired about the spirit who had just been present, but could get no\nanswer except that she would communicate with me herself hereafter.\nShe expressed great delight at my having recognised her. Soon after\nthis the control ceased, and we closed a very remarkable seance.\nMr. Butland's mediumship is of a very remarkable type. The face\nis a good one, with pleasant features, and a full black beard and mous\ntache. When controlled the face is very expressive, and admits of\ngreat change of expression. The gestures are fine and the attitudes\nwould be a fine study for a sculptor in some cases. Both expression\nand gesture change very rapidly, and a stranger has no difficulty in\nrecognising the emotions intended to be conveyed. At times the\npathos is very great and most strikingly depicted. Tears flow from\nthe eyes, and the whole man is thrown into the character he is depict\ning, for each representation has its strongly-marked individuality, which\nis maintained throughout.\nFew of the spirits speak, except Dr. Elliotson, Mr. Dickie, and Mr.\nCharleton.\nWednesday, January \\5th, 1873.\u2014Seance at Douglas House.\u2014The\nroom was lighted with a red light sufficiently strong to enable us to see\nperfectly what was going on. We could observe the lifting and\nfloating of the table to the height of two feet or more.1\nTuesday, January 21s<.\u2014Seance at Douglas House.\u2014The usual\nphenomena occurred. The table was floated repeatedly, and raised\nfrom the ground two feet without contact. . . . Dicky stated that\nhe was the spirit who trod so heavily in time to music, and shook the\nroom. He illustrated his remark by shaking the floor, and saying that\nthat was his peculiar sound. [It appears that this seance was held in\nhalf-light, though Mr. Moses does not mention the fact.] 2\nJanuary 2o(h.\u2014Seance at Douglas House.\u2014The physical phenomena\ncommenced at once, and on one occasion the table was floated to the\nlevel of our heads ; this in clear light. Dicky was requested to bring\nsomething, and accordingly he fetched part of an ivory puzzle out of the\ndrawing-room, and a heavy bronze candlestick out of the dining-\nroom. The latter struck me heavily on the head, and hurt me con\nsiderably.3\n1 January loth.\u2014Seance in red light. Great movements of the table. It\nwas repeatedly lifted up to the level of our faces, even without touching\nit. Subdued light, quite sufficient to see the table and our hands. The\ntable was moved and floated several times ; we could watch in light its every\nmovement.\u2014S.T.S.\n2 January 21s\u00a3.\u2014Seance. Half light, enough to see our hands.

Dicky\ncame and tilted the table near Dr. Speer. I lectured and forgave him,\nand he danced about in great glee. [This sitting is plainly the one\nreferred to below by Dr. Speer, who mentions that there was some light\nin the room, a fact which seems to have been only occasionally noted-]1\nSunday, February 23rd.\u2014Seance at Douglas House. Present, the\nusual circle, with Mr. Harrison, Editor of the Spiritualist.\u2014In order\nto avoid the usual seance-room [which Imperator desired to be kept\nexclusively for the intimate group] we sat in the breakfast^room, the\nfirelight being excluded as well as possible. The usual raps and creaks,\nwhich had been plainly audible at dinner, commenced at once, and\nDicky was particularly lively. We were then requested to darken the\nroom, and the light which had been round us vanished, and the\nsounds ceased. Presently my chair began to move, and I saw light\ncoming as it were through the door. At once my chair was withdrawn\nfrom me, and placed on the table ; from which position it toppled\nover to the floor again, whilst I was shot to the end of the room under\na side table, and three articles were put upon the table, viz., a carved\nivory napkin-ring from under a glass shade in the drawing room, a\ncarte de visite from the same room, and a chamois horn from the\nentrance hall. We all felt cold, and the influence was very strong.\nWe made a break now for tea, and when we returned Dicky again\nfetched a compass from the drawing-room.2\nTuesday, March 4th.\u2014Seance at Douglas House.\u2014A very loud\nknock on the table came as I was describing Mrs. Jencken's knocks.\nIt was a distinct imitation of hers, but not quite so loud. Dr. Speer\nhad got a magnet, which he put on the table, as an experiment. I do\nnot know how far that influenced the noise, which was very loud.\nWe had joined hands, contrary to our usual habit, and when a\nlight was struck (on the heavy blow coming) we found on the table a\nlittle silver tray with an orange and rose upon it\u2014the orange for me,\nI was coughing, and the rose for Mrs. Speer. Knocks sounded all\nover the room. [Note that Dr. Speer makes the orange a biscuit.] 3\nclosed doors, and was thrown at Mr. M., hurting him much.

Still greater levitation of the table. We\nhad almost to stand to keep our hands on it ; one leg was placed on the arm\nof my chair five times.

It was very metallic and clear. Im-\nperator spoke in answer to questions at some length. [Here the\nbringing in of two objects is noted by Dr. Speer only.]1\nSunday, March 15<\/t.\u2014We sat (Dr. S. and I) below stairs, and had\nmany knocks. The room shook, and the knocks occurred just the\nsame when our hands were removed and our feet placed on the table.\nWe had several messages, one purporting to come from Dr. Speer's\nlittle sister, C.P.S.S. Imperator came. He spoke with difficulty, and\nsaid that many spirits were round us. The noise on the table, chair,\nbookcase, and harmonium stool was very remarkable, continuing all\nthe time that I was entranced. Before the trance passed, a very hard\nknock was given on the table.2\nMarch \\\u00a7th, 1873.\u2014Douglas House.\u2014Dr. Speer and I sat alone in\nthe room below. The spirit above described [as making loud metallic\nraps] came and knocked very violently. Dr. S. had in his hand a\nsmall steel hammer, used in sounding the chest, and with it he struck\nviolent blows on the table, which were responded to by still louder\nknocks from the spirit. The knocks were of the same intense and\nmetallic character as before. The force exercised must have been very\ngreat.\nWe were finally told to go upstairs and sit in the seance-room.\nMrs. Speer joined the circle, and little Pauline came and rapped in the\ncupboard of the bookcase. The raps were clear and the same as we\nhave heard from her before. She gave her name. Dr. S. asked for a\nmessage. She said, \" I wrote,\" alluding to a previous evening when\nthere had been a great noise in the cupboard. Dr. S. looked in the\ncupboard, and found his marked piece of paper covered on one side\nwith \" Dieu vous garde.\u2014C. P. S. Sperr \" (sic).\n[This mis-spelling is noticeable in connection with the question how\nfar the mis-spelling of names, when given by raps or direct writing,\naffects the question of identity. Here we have a control which returns\nfrequently, and shows knowledge of the brief earth-life, and the full\nname of the little sister of Dr. Speer's, whom it claims to be.

So again, of two Greek names mis-spelt in direct\nwriting, one was thoroughly familiar to Mr. Moses, who was much\ndisgusted at the blunder. The inference, as stated by the controlling\nintelligences themselves, seems to be that when a name is rapped out\nor given in direct writing its production is of the nature of a physical\nphenomenon, which may be more or less successfully performed, and is\nnot necessarily performed by the spirit itself whose name is given. The\nmere fact that a name is given by direct writing is thus no proof of\nidentity ; and neither is a blunder in spelling it any disproof.\u2014\nF.W.H.M.] 1\nSunday, March 23rd, 1873.\u2014Dr. S. and I sat in the lower room. We\nhad the usual sounds, especially the metallic knock very loud. A new\nspirit manifested, who gave the name of the Spirit of Art. There was\nalso a noise in mid-air, apparently between Dr. S. and myself, as of the\ntwanging of a stringed instrument. There was no such instrument in\nthe room, and I am at a loss how to account for it. A spirit also\nimitated the drumming of a tune. The knocks were at times exceed\ningly loud.2\nMonday, March 24<\/t, 1870.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and I sat in the\nstudy. We had the usual knocks, and Imperator answered questions.\nI had magnetised a sheet of paper, and put it under the table.\nImperator, speaking through me, told Dr. and Mrs. Speer to hold\nmy hands and he would give me a \"pleasing test.\" Accordingly,\nwhen I came out of trance I found my hands grasped. This con\ntinued until a light was called for by four raps, when we found\nthe paper covered by minute writing. The annexed is as near a\nfacsimile as I can make. [A message of about ten lines of general\nadvice is here copied. This sitting is noticeable from an evidential\npoint of view, from the mutually supplementary accounts of Mr. Moses\nand Dr. Speer. Dr. Speer's statement : \" I myself kicked the pencil away\nfrom the paper,\" apparently means \" in order to make sure that, hands\nbeing held, no writing should be done with the feet.\"\u2014F.W.H.M.] 3\n1 March 19th.\u2014Seance. Tremendous raps, imitating and exceeding those\nmade by myself with a percussion hammer. These sounds occurred both hi\nmy study and breakfast-room. C.P.S.S. [the infant sister of Dr. Speer, from\nwhom frequent messages were alleged to come] gave a message from the\ncupboard\u2014S.T.S.\n- March 23rd. \u2014Seance on ground floor. Great blows struck on table ;\nknocks and sounds of every kind. Gravel thrown through closed window ;\nsome stringed instrument was heard playing in mid-air.

Stainion Moses. 305\nWednesday, April 2nd, 1873.\u2014The anniversary of my first seance.\nI have now kept an accurate record of events for a year. ... A\nshort time after sitting, Dicky and Rector manifested loudly, and\nJ. N. L. came. She said [by raps] she wished to introduce her brother,\nwho gave the name of John Lydgate ; said he was a monk who lived\nabout 1420, at Bury St. Edmunds, at a Benedictine monastery ; that\nhe got his education at Oxford and travelled abroad ; that he kept a\nschool of poetry, and published the History of Thebes and the Siege of\nTroy. Affinity had brought him to me.\nThis information has since been verified in the most remarkable\nmanner by Mr. Noyes, who writes me that John Lydgate was exactly\nwhat he professes to be, and that he studied at Oxford, Paris, and\nPadua. The Siege of Troy was a poetical romance of 28,000 lines.\nWe have not before had so circumstantial a description.1\nApril \\\u00a7th, 1873.\u2014Mr. Deane, organist of Trinity Church, East\nbourne, joined our circle. We had several loud knocks on the table,\nand creaks and taps, but no communication. At one particularly\nloud crack from the metallic spirit who has given the name of John\nDee, Dr. Speer saw in the half-light a shadowy arm making impact on\nthe table. It appeared to come from my elbow. My arms at the\ntime were folded on the table. Mr. Deane confirmed by reference all\nand one on the harmonium. The best and minutest spirit-writing (direct)\nyet obtained, and signed by four spirits, viz. , Imperator, Rector, Doctor, and\nPrudens. N.B.\u2014The paper was carefully examined by us all immediately\nbefore extinguishing the light, and I myself kicked the pencil away from the\npaper. The writing was undermost.\u2014S.T.S.\n1 April 2nd.\u2014Seance. Mrs. De M. , Messrs. N. and Percival joined the\ncircle. Janet Nares Lydgate gave her name for the first time, and brought\nher brother, who died in 1490. He gave minute details of his earth-life, all\nof which were found to be absolutely correct by three of the sitters during\nthe following days and after examination of records. Raps were heard all\nover the large dining-table. A large stone was brought in (through locked\ndoors) from my study. Hands held the whole time.\u2014S.T.S.\nApril 2nd.\u2014This evening Mrs. De Morgan, Mr. Percival, and Mr. N.\njoined our outer circle. Manifestations soon commenced. Rector shook\nthe room, and walked round the circle with a heavy step. Very many sounds\nand raps were heard, all different. We remarked the spirits had promised\nto come, and seemed very numerous. They rapped out, \" We are.\" J.N.L.\nintroduced her brother to the circle ; he told us he had lived in the reign of\nHenry V., had passed into spirit life in 1420, was a monk at Bury St.\nEdmunds, was of the Order of the Benedictines, kept a school, and had been\nattracted to the medium by affinity and love of education. He had studied\nat Oxford and abroad, and had translated The Siege of Troy. J.N.L.\nthen informed us she was in the second sphere, had passed away young.\nImperator came with his soft thud on the table, telling us by raps to join\nhands. In a few minutes, through the table, message was given, \" We have\n\f306 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nthe particulars given to us by Dr. John Dee and Dr. James Nares,\nwho is Charley's guardian. The particulars were principally written\nthrough my hand by Doctor. 2\nApril 30th, 1873.\u2014Seance at Miss Douglas', 81, South Audley-\nstreet. Present : Mr. and Mrs. Wm.

Crookes.\nWe sat in a well-lighted room\u2014a bright fire, a shaded reading-lamp,\nand two candles, which latter were finally extinguished, the light from\nother sources being ample. The table was covered with a cloth, and\nthe fireplace was at Mr. Crookes' back. The room was crowded\nwith furniture. We had not sat very long before the table became\nuneasy. Small raps were heard, which gradually increased in power,\nthough they never reached anything like the intensity of those to\nwhich I am accustomed. By the time that the raps had become con-\nbrought stone. Wait.\" Presently the medium was greatly convulsed, and\nsuddenly a large stone was rolled violently across the table and fell on\nMr. Percival's knee. The stone had been brought from the hall through a\nlocked door, every hand at the table being held during the process. Mr.\nPercival had been anxious to have a proof of \" matter passing through\nmatter,\" and this indeed was a solid one, as the stone was very large and\nheavy. \u2014M.S.\n-April 19th.\u2014Seance at Eastbourne, with Mr. Deane.

Stainton Moses. 307\nfirmed Mr. Home judged that he might experiment with the accordion.\nHe took it up in his right hand and held it under the table. Soon it\nwas played, and questions answered by notes struck upon it. Finally\nit played \" Home, sweet Home \" very sweetly. At one time Mr.\nHome's hand was withdrawn from under the table, and he allowed it\nto go where it was impelled, still holding the accordion. It drew\nsteadily towards the reading-lamp, and in full light we saw it playing,\nexpanding and contracting steadily. Mr. Home held it by the\nbottom, the keys being downwards. After this it was replaced under\nthe table, still in Mr. Home's hand, and Serjeant Cox was told to look\nunder the table. There he saw the hand\u2014a full-sized man's apparently\u2014\nplaying the accordion. About that he is absolutely certain. It was\nlight enough to be quite visible. \" Ye banks and braes of Bonny\nDoon \" was partly played, and we were all touched by hands. One\nwas a little baby hand\u2014small, delicate, and very soft. It patted my\nknee very freely, and anticipated my mental questions. Miss Douglas'\nbracelet was moved on her arm close to my eyes. Questions were\nanswered upon it, and at one time the raps upon it were loud enough\nto be heard all over the room. Hands came up under the cloth and\ntouched us, and questions were answered on the accordion both by\nraps and by the notes.\nThe lyre sound, which is familiar to us, was heard very distinctly,\neven when the accordion was away from the table.\nBy degrees Mr. Home's hands and arms began to twitch and move\ninvoluntarily. I should say that he has been partly paralysed, drags\none of his legs, moves with difficulty, stoops, and can endure very little\nphysical exertion. As he passed into the trance state he drew power\nfrom the circle by extending his arms to them and mesmerising himself.\nAll these acts were involuntary. He gradually passed into the trance\nstate, and rose from the table, erect, and a different man from what he\nwas. He walked firmly, dashed out his arms and legs with great\npower, and passed round to Mr. Crookes. He mesmerised him, and\nappeared to draw power from him. He then went to the fireplace,\nremoved the guard, and sat down on the hearthrug. There he seemed\nto hold a conversation by signs with a spirit. He repeatedly bowed,\nand finally set to work to mesmerise his head again. He ruffled his\nbushy hair until it stood out like a mop, and then deliberately lay down\nand put his head in the bright wood fire. The hair was in the blaze,\nand must, under ordinary circumstances, have been singed off. His\nhead was in the grate, and his neck on a level with the top bar. This\nwas repeated several times. He also put his hand into the fire,\nsmoothed away the wood and coal, and picked out a live coal, which he\nheld in his hand for a few seconds, but replaced soon, saying the power\nwas not sufficient. He tried to give a hot coal to Mr. Crookes, but\n\f308 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nwas unable to do it. He then came to all of us to satisfy us that there\nwas no smell of fire on his hair. There was absolutely none. \" The\nsmell of fire had not passed on him.\" In the trance state he passed\nabout the room amongst the furniture without touching any. He\nmoved the lamp to the mantelpiece. He spoke in a soft, subdued voice,\ncalled himself \" Dan,\" and said he had a work to do in London.\nDuring the evening we never heard who the spirits were, but I was told\nthat friends of mine were present.\n[Mr. Crookes, to whom I (F.W.H.M.) have shown this account,\ncomments as follows :\u2014,\nMarch 9th, 1893.\nI have a distinct recollection of the seance here described, and can corro\nborate Mr. Stainton Moses' account. I was not well placed for seeing the\nfirst part of the \" fire test \" here recorded. I knew, from experience, that\nwhen Home was in a trance much movement or conversation on the part of\nthe others present was likely to interfere with the progress of phenomena.\nMy back was to the fire, and I did not at first turn round to see what he\nwas doing. Being told what was taking place, I looked and saw Home in\nthe act of raising his head from the fire. Probably this was the last occasion\nof the \" several times \" it was repeated, as I have no recollection of seeing\nit more than once. On my expressing great disappointment at having missed\nthis test, Mr. Home told me to leave my scat and come with him to the tire.\nHe asked me if I should be afraid to take a live coal [ember] from his hand.\nI said, No, I would take it if he would give it to me. He then put his hand\namong the hot coals [embers], and deliberately picked out the brightest bit\nand held it in his hand for a few seconds. He appeared to deliberate for\na time, and then returned it to the grate, saying the power was too weak,\nand he was afraid I might be hurt. During this time I was kneeling on the\nhearthrug, and am unable to explain how it was he was not severely burnt.\nThe fire was of wood, Miss Douglas never burning coal in her reception-\nrooms. At the commencement of the evening a log of wood had been put\non, and this had been smouldering throughout the evening. My recollection\nof the fire is that it was not a particularly bright one.\nI do not believe in the possibility of the ordinary skin of the hand being\nso prepared as to enable hot coals to be handled with impunity. Schoolboys'\nbooks and mediaeval tales describe how this can be done with alum or certain\nother ingredients. It is possible that the skin may be so hardened and\nthickened by such preparations that superficial charring might take place\nwithout the pain becoming great, but the surface of the skin would certainly\nsuffer severely. After Homo had recovered from the trance I examined his\nhand with care to see if there were any signs of burning or of previous pre\nparation. I could detect no trace of injury to the skin, which was soft and\ndelicate like a woman's. Neither were there signs of any preparation having\nbeen previously applied.\nI have often seen conjurers and others handle red-hot coals and iron, but\nthere were always palpable signs of burning. A negro was once brought to\nmy lalwratory, who professed to be able to handle red-hot iron with impunity.\nI was asked to test his pretensions, and I did so carefully. There was no\n\fThe Experiences of W.

Present : Mrs. Home, Ser\njeant Cox, Mr. and Mrs. W. Crookes, Miss Douglas, and myself.\u2014\nWe had been told at the last seance to sit in the dining-room. Miss\nDouglas had forgotten, and the fire was newly lit and the room\nunprepared. We sat round the table for fifty minutes with no result.\nDuring all that time I felt power drawn from me, and was partially\nentranced.

The\naccordion played a strange, weird melody, unlike anything earthly I\never heard. The table rocked about like a ship at sea\u2014rocked,\ngroaned, and finally separated at the joint. Nothing, however, was\n\f310 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nmade of this, and the table was joined again. A chair just behind Mr.\nHome began to move, and was considerably moved round. We could\nall see it move, but stealthily, and when the intent gaze was not fixed\non it. We found invariably that direct gaze would paralyse the move\nment at once. . . . Suddenly Mr. Home passed into trance, and\nspoke in his natural voice, but of himself in the third person. He\nspoke of a spirit near (Hamilton Dundas), who had been lost in the\nPresident. Miss Douglas knew him.\nMr. Home now rose from his chair, and . . . went into the\ninner dining-room, taking the accordion with him, and placing it on\nthe dinner-waggon. [Carving-table.\u2014E. Crookes.] The firelight was\nlowered ; the reading-lamp was put out of the room ; the gas behind\nthe window at the end of the room was lowered, and we sat in gloom ;\nthe window at the end showing out in bold relief. During the evening\nMr. Home stood near the fireplace, and kept us informed of his\nposition. \" Now Dan is here ; now Dan is touching the, ifec., tfcc.\" We\nall saw a hand descend from the top of the curtain and play the\naccordion. It was a large hand, and its reflection on the window\nblind was strong. After this a head showed in similar way. When\nMrs. Crookes was told to go into the room and occupy the chair\nmarked in the plan, a form was materialised as far as the middle. It\nfloated near the folding doors, and advanced towards Mrs. Crookes, who\nscreamed, and it vanished.\n[Mrs. Crookes, to whom I (F.W.H.M.) have shown this account,\nmakes the following comments :\u2014\nMarch 9th, 1893.\nThis is an accurate account as far as it goes of one of the most interest\ning seances I ever had with Mr. Home, and I have on several occasions\nrecounted the incidents to my friends. When Mr. Home took me by the\nhand and led me into the back dining-room he placed me in a chair at the side\nof the window and carving-table (not dinner-waggon), and facing the party\nin the other room. The window had ground glass in it, no blind, and the\ngas behind was bright enough to show everything in the room distinctly.\nMr. Home then left me and stood between the two rooms. The accordion\nwas immediately taken from his hand by a cloudy appearance, which soon\nseemed to condense into a distinct human form, clothed in a filmy drapery,\nstanding near Mr. Home between the two rooms. The accordion began to\nplay (I do not remember whether on this occasion there was any recognised\nmelody), and the figure gradually advanced towards me till it almost touched\nme, playing continuously. It was semi-transparent, and I could see the\nsitters through it all the time. Mr. Home remained near the sliding doors.\nAs the figure approached I felt an intense cold, getting stronger as it got\nnearer, and as it was giving me the accordion I could not help screaming.\nThe figure immediately seemed to sink into the floor to the waist, leaving\nonly the head and shoulders visible, still playing the accordion, which\nwas then about a foot off the floor. Mr. Home and my husband came to me\n\fThe Experiences of TP. Stainton Moses. 311\nat once, and I have no clear recollection of what then occurred, except that\nthe accordion did not cease playing immediately.\nMr. Serjeant Cox was rather angry at my want of nerve, and exclaimed :\n\" Mrs. Crookes, you have spoilt the finest manifestation we have ever had.'^\nI have always regretted that my want of presence of mind brought the-\nphenomena to so abrupt a termination. Ellen Crookes.]\nMay 9th.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. in study.\u2014A very-\ninteresting seance. We joined hands, and in that position had loud\nknocks from Philosophus, but no movement of table. Dicky came and\nbrought very gently an ivory piece of puzzle from the drawing-room.\nAt my request he fetched another. After this I felt something-\ncrawling over my right hand (which Mrs. S. held) and could not make\nout what it was. When a light was struck we found it to be a marker\nfrom Mrs. Speer's bedroom. It had crawled over my hand, and was\nplaced directly in front of her, with the legend, \" God is our refuge and\nstrength,\" right before her eyes. It was folded and arranged very\nneatly. During the whole time we grasped hands. A piece of'\nmignonette in my button-hole was taken out a^id passed over my face\nand hair, and over Mrs. Speer's face. As we concluded the seance a\npillar of light, very bright and diffused, descended on the centre of the\ntable and passed round the circle, vanishing near the ceiling. It was\nlike a flash of light at first.1\nWednesday, May 14th.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014\nThe usual manifestations, rapping, tipping, and floating of table. No\nspirit lights, but the lyre sound, as we have named it. The sound had\nnever occurred except in the lower room and in the dining-room, where\nthere were musical instruments\u2014a piano and a musical clock\u2014on\nwhich it could be imitated, and I had formed the idea that it was\nnecessary to have such means of forming the sound. Here, however,\nit came very much more distinctly than I had ever heard it before,\nclose to our ears, and moving about apparently in mid-air. It seemed\nlike the plucking of a string or strings. There was no attempt at a\ntune, but the sound was clear, and varied in tone and pitch. It was\nrepeated several times over, and continued more or less for 20 minutes\nor more. Two articles were brought from Mrs. Speer's bedroom. The\nseance did not last more than three-quarters of an hour.2\nSunday Evening, May 18th, 1873.\u2014Douglas House.

It was like otto of roses, very\npowerful. As it passed round the circle Dr. and Mrs. Speer and I\nsaw a figure carrying it apparently. I also saw a figure in the middle\nof the table when the lyre sound was heard there. Rector manifested\nvery forcibly.1\n1 May 18th.\u2014Seance with Mr. W. Harrison in our dining-room. Rector\nwith us the whole evening, displaying great power and shaking the\nwhole room. Grocyn came again. Cards were brought into the room from\nthe drawing-room. Cold columns of air laden with rose scent circulated\naround us. At 3.30 in the morning the handles of our bedroom were\nviolently shaken.\u2014S.T.S.\n[Mrs. Speer has incidentally given me a curious description of this\nnocturnal sound. I had asked her whether the servants at Douglas House or\nelsewhere had ever commented on the musical and other noises. Mrs. Speer\nreplies (October 26th, 1893):\u2014\"In the Isle of Man we had a furnished\nhouse, and took our own servants. At Ventnor we had a flat to ourselves\nand sat very little there. At Shanklin we had, for three years, a house of\nour own, where the most remarkable stances occurred. It was here\nthat Mentor used to make such beautiful scent from the flowers, scenting the\nhouse and perfuming flowers that we were wearing. While speaking of\nscent, I may tell you that one summer we shut up our London house and took\nall the servants to Shanklin. We had occasion to ask someone to enter the\nhouse. The lady wrote saying the spirits were evidently taking care of it,\nas it was filled with beautiful scent\u2014no one in it. As a rule our servants\nslept at the top of our house, and they made no remarks concerning noises,\nexcept on one occasion, when Dr. S. and Mr. S. M. had been sitting in a\nlower room, opening into the garden, and near the servants' apartments.\nThe manifestations had been very strong, and after the gentlemen left the\nroom the servants said they heard so much pounding in the room that\nthey felt frightened and went to bed as quickly as possible. We were told\nafterwards that so much power had been generated that the spirits had to\nmake the noise to get rid of it. A similar circumstance occurred to me\nand Dr. S. one night. Soon after we had retired to bed the handle of\nour door was violently shaken. I thought a burglar had arrived ; he, who\ndid not hear well, said, 'Perhaps it was nothing.' A moment afterwards\nthe door leading into the dressing-room was also shaken loudly. On looking\noutside there was no one to be seen. We were afterwards told that a spirit\nhad bean attracted by the spiritual light over the house, and had used up\npower that had been left by shaking the doors. The spirits did once give\nthree loud raps at my bedroom door to call me down to a seance, Mr. S. M.\nbeing downstairs. And mental questions have been answered by raps on the\nwall, while I was in one room and Mr. Moses in another.\" This last remark\nrelates to another question ; as to phenomena occurring to Mrs. Speer in a\nroom apart from Mr. Moses.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nMay 27th.\u2014Seance at Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and L\u2014\nLyre sound, scent while hands were held. A large materialised hand\nwas passed over Mrs. Speer's up-turned face, as she was waiting for the\n\fThe Experiences of W.

A candlestick was brought from the dining-room, and shell\nfell straight down from the ceiling behind me on the back of my arm\nchair. The table rolled about in every direction. Showers of liquid\nverbena scent, and another nameless scent, fell down upon us. Sometimes\nit was poured on one of my hands alone. Columns of very cold scented air\npassed round the room. A cross was brought to me of silver enamel.\nDirect writing under table. At the close of seance John Deo gave two\ntremendous blows on fhe table.\nJune 21st.\u2014Seance very satisfactory. Grocyn and his friend the Welsh\nHarper again manifested in a most extraordinary manner, taking in the whole\nrange of the gamut upon their invisible instruments. Three crosses were\nbrought with the message (by raps): \"One for each.\" Scent was again\nrepeatedly showered down. Between thirty and forty spirit lights appeared,\nmany of them as large as large oranges. They began near the floor, then\nascended, and at last by request came within our circle, so that we might have\ntouched them. One came down (by request) on the table, and gave\n9 three loud raps, as though it had been done with the bottom\nof a lamp. The appearance of several of them may be thus\nrepresented. The band which I saw is stated by the others to have\nbeen in reality the finger of a hand crossing the lamp, which was like\nbright moonlight. Many of the lights were amorphous, or rather\nformless. They succeeded each other with great rapidity.\nJune 23rd.\u2014Seance. We had this day fitted up a cabinet by opening the\ndoor of the bath-room, and hanging in front of it a heavy curtain with\na square aperture. Mr. M. sat in this cabinet upon a reclining chair. Large\nlights soon appeared, and did so about fifty times. They emerged from the\naperture, and came into the room, casting reflections upon objects. Some\nwere so large and bright as to show the whole of the lintels and doorposts.\nThey came very close to the table upon which our hands were placed, and\non which table there came most unexpectedly the little raps of C.P.S.S.,\nwith her French message : \" Dieu vous garde.\"\u2014S.T.S.\n\f314 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nFriday, June 27th. \u2014 Dr. and Mrs. S., Mr. H., and self. \u2014 We\nsat first in the dining-room. The knocks began, almost directly.\nThe musical sound of Grocyn and the scent came, and a stone\nwas brought from my house in Clifton-road, a distance of half-a-\nmile. Imperator spoke very briefly, and told us to go upstairs. I had\na very distressing headache, and the atmospheric conditions were not\ngood. I sat in the cabinet, and the other three on the sofa outside.\nLights soon came, whilst I was in deep trance. They are described\nto me as of pale, soft light, which was surrounded apparently with\ndrapery. Mr. H. described it to me as a luminous crystal with\na hand holding it. Mentor, on being asked whether it were\nhis hand, assented, and showed a gigantic finger before the light.\nThere were about thirty lights, and some of them were very large\nThey flashed by with a comet-like motion at times, and then again\nstood at the opening, gradually fading away.\nThey generally seemed to radiate from a solid centre of luminosity\nand to be shrouded in some soft drapery. Others were apparently\nsolid, like luminous ice. After the lights had been shown Mentor con\ntrolled me (first time), and I walked out through the opening and sat\ndown at the table, talking in a brisk, cheery voice, quite unlike\nImperator's. The control did not last long, and I woke refreshed and\nwith my headache gone.1\nSaturday, June 28th.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014Musical sounds,\nscent, knocks and tilts.

Scent thrown\nover everyone, loud knocks, stone brought into the room. I happened to\nput my hand out into the middle of the table, and felt another hand.\nN.B.\u2014The medium and his chair had been removed from the table.\nImperator came and requested us to go upstairs and try for lights as before,\nMr. M. sitting in the cabinet. They came almost immediately, of various\nshapes and sizes, some very large. They came into the room and illumined\nthe doorposts distinctly ; on one something like a large finger seemed to rest.\nQo=o6 0 M\u00ae\nThe above represent the outlines of these lights. They were all of a pale\nbluish-green, or rather greenish-blue, tint. Many of them had a perfectly\ndistinct hard outline and a bright nucleus. Mr. Harrison says that such\nlights could by no possibility be imitated [Mr. Harrison was an electrician],\nand imagines that they were produced by hands holding crystals with\ndrapery falling on them. At the close Mentor brought the medium out of\nthe cabinet and gave us a short address.\u2014S.T.S.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 315\nit close to Dr. and Mrs. Speer as they sat at the table. It was bright\nand of large size. Rector also manifested.1\nSunday, June 29lh.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014The lyre-sound of\nGrocyn was the most pronounced I have yet heard. He answered\nquestions freely with it and played a duet, varying it to represent\nthe sound made by bells. He told me that there were seven\nmusical spirits concerned in manifesting, but we could only dis\ntinguish three distinct sounds. One was like the very small string\nof the harp, the other was like the very deepest bass of the\nvioloncello, rich, full, and very powerful. It sounded freely in\nour midst. Scent was showered on us, and three books were brought\nfrom one of the cupboards of the book-case and laid on the table, my\nchair having been previously withdrawn to the end of the room. They\nwere all books belonging to Dr. Speer which had been lately in use.\nThe table was a good deal tilted. Many raps and sounds were made,\nand especially Mentor knocked, first on the table, which was quite out\nof my reach ; and then immediately on the harmonium. I could see\nhim passing backwards and forwards. Indeed, the room was full of\ndiffused light\u2014I never saw more\u2014in the form of foggy luminous mist.\nLittle points of light flashed out now and again, but no distinct spirit-\nlights were made. 2\nMonday, July 1st, 1873.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014The day was so\noppressive and hot that we had not thought of sitting, but I suggested\ntrying what could be done under very unfavourable circumstances.\nGrocyn soon manifested, with very loud thrumming, of deeper tone\nthan we ever had before. It was as if some power were thrumming\nthe deep string of the double-bass. With this were intermingled other\nsounds shading to the high note which we associate with the Welsh\nharper. The sounds were persistent and very loud. The deep bass thrilled\nthe air and imparted a tremulous motion to the table. Scent came,\nand I was controlled both by Mentor and Imperator, who said that\nthey had wished to try what could be done under such bad conditions.\nSe'ance at 20, Mornington-road. Tuesday, July 2nd.\u2014Mr. and Mrs.\nWilliam and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Crookes, Miss Douglas, Serjeant\nCox, and myself. Mr. D. D.

The sounds were as if a violoncello had been played on the top of\na big drum, and the strings plucked. Three other musical sounds were\nheard. Loud knocks on the table and harmonium alternately. Scent as\nusual.\u2014S.T.S.\ns June 30th.\u2014Short seance by impression (weather very bad). Grocyn's\nsound as extraordinary as ever. Scent showered down several times.

If a powerful double-bass were\nthrummed on a big drum, I doubt whether it could make such a sound.\nThey were almost continuous. The Welsh harper came, and we had a\nnew sound, which was vastly like a squeaking whistle. This may have\nbeen attributable to the fact that the power was ill-regulated and\nerratic. Scent. Imperator controlled very briefly. He spoke of some\nvery interesting discussions which I am holding with him [by auto\nmatic writing].1\nSunday Evening, July Gth.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014Grocyn's\nsounds were clear, bell-like, and refined. Occasionally he made a sound\nas of a loose or broken string, very curious and loud. The whistle\ndeveloped, and was less harsh and unpleasant. No scent, but Mentor\nmade a few small lights whilst I was awake. Knocks in cupboard.2\nWednesday Evening, July 9th.\u2014Dr. S. and self, in study.\u2014We sat\nalone, Mrs. Speer being out. The seance was very remarkable. Grocyn\ncommenced as soon as we sat down. His sounds were portentously\nloud, at times causing the table to vibrate throughout. In the\nair was the sound as of a tambourine and a harsh shrill whistle\nalmost like a bird's note. Knocks on the table like small objects falling\nand rolling about. Knocks on harmonium, cupboard, and table\nsimultaneously. Table lifted, harmonium stool moved and brought out,\nmy chair rapidly pulled away from the table. Books brought from the\nharmonium, one pulled out from the book-case, a small picture brought\nto the table. All placed on Dr. Speer's left hand. Scent unlike any\nthing we had before. Message : \" We show our power. Good-night,\"\ngiven in Mentor's knocks.\nAfter the seance Dr. S. and I walked up and down in the dining-\nroom, I smoking a cigar. The smell of scent became palpable through the\nodour of the tobacco. I casually said : \" Now, if they would put it on\n1Jtdy 5th.-\u2014Seance. M.A. unwell. Power erratic. Grocyn came as\nusual. J.

Immediately-\nwet scent fell on the pad, and this phenomenon was repeated a dozen\ntimes, I should think. The little bird-whistle also followed us and\nsounded repeatedly, near the ceiling, apparently. The sound was much\nless than it had been in the dark room. The dining-room was well\nlighted, and lowering the gas did not seem to make any difference.1\nSaturday, July 12th.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. Speer, Dr.\nThomson, of Clifton, and myself.\u2014We sat in the dining-room, and\nobtained the usual phenomena\u2014scent, the musical sounds, raps, tilts, <fec.\nWe tried bringing the small table out from the study, but the raps\ncame on the large dining-table at once ; and we were told to move to\nit. We sat for the lights in the cabinet upstairs, and some large ones\nappeared, of a similar nature to those which I have described before.\nMentor and Imperator both controlled, and spoke to Dr. Thomson. The\ncontrol was short. Mentor [i.e., Mr. Moses controlled by Mentor] came\nout from the cabinet and walked into the circle upstairs. Scent came\nupstairs for the first time.2\nSunday, July 13<\/t.\u2014Dr. and Mrs. S. and self, in study.-\u2014Grocyn's\nsounds very loud. Scent. Lights formed behind me, and Imperator\nentranced me. Dr. Speer describes the lights as being very diffused,\nand similar to those shown from the cabinet, but not so brilliant.\nImperator spoke sadly of the difficulty of controlling me, and of the\ndiscussion which I have had with him now for a long time. I have\nargued out with him the question of his identity, and of the pretensions\nhe makes, as well as of the general outcome of Spiritualism. The tone\n1 July 9th.\u2014Seance. Mr. M. and self sat alone in my study. All the\nusual phenomena. Grocyn, the bird, scent, &c. , presented themselves in a\nvery short time, and with greater intensity than ever, the violoncello or\nharp sounds actually sending powerful thrills up our hands to the shoulder,\nand even through the body. The bird-whistle came with great power, and\nvery close. The scent fell like rain. The harmonium bend was moved out\nand a number of books were brought from it one after another and placed on\nmy left hand. A frame, containing one of C.'s certificates, was also placed\nacross my hand, and a large book\u2014Vol. 2 of Count Bcaulus\u2014was finally\nplaced on the pile already formed on the table. Great thumps were heard\nalmost simultaneously on the cupboard door and at the farthest end of the\nharmonium. On returning to the lighted dining-room, scent (verbena) was\nseveral times, and by desire, thrown on a blotting pad ! \\ !\u2014S.T.S.\n2 July 12th.\u2014Dr. Thomson, of Bristol, joined our seance. The study\ntable was placed in the dining-room, but the phenomena were very slight.\nWe left it and sat round the large dining-table. Grocyn came as usual.\nHeliotrope scent was thrown over each in turn ; and a large number of splendid\nlights, apparently held by hands, were seen in the cabinet.

The seance throughout was good. There\nwas a deal of light in the room, diffused ; C.P.S.S. was plain to me,\nand rapped on the table with the peculiar dropping rap. Raps\ncommenced almost as soon as we sat down, and the scent came. (We\nhad three kinds during the evening.) Grocyn's sounds were louder\nthan I ever heard them in the dining-room, though still not so loud as\nthey are in the study. They varied from the deepest bass to the\nhighest treble. The whistle came again, apparently up in the air near\nthe ceiling. Imperator came, and spoke at length in answer to\nPercival's questions. He promised to endeavour to put himself in\ncommunication with another medium, so as to give me corroborative\nevidence as far as possible: He replied also to questions about the\nspheres and other points. We then sat for lights upstairs, and had a.\nnumber. I was in the deepest trance. Dr. S. describes them as not\nso brilliant as usual, but clear, and with a bright nucleus. Some were\nshown with a hand holding them, the hand large, and the fingers\npointing upwards. Mentor controlled afterwards, and walked out as\nusual, talking easily, but in a totally different way to Imperator. He\nsaid the conditions of atmosphere and medium had been unfavourable.\nScent was again showered through the aperture of the cabinet.1\nJuly 15th.\u2014Seance in the study at Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs.\nSpeer and myself.\u2014Imperator, in consequence of my persistent dis\nbelief in his pretensions, had retired, and had threatened to withdraw\nthe power. Scent came in showers ; but no other manifestation was\ngiven except a few knocks. The scent was literally rained down on\nus. Tt was a very beautiful scent, like sandal-wood, at first. After\nwards there came a scent of a totally different kind. The room was\nso permeated with the odour that it remained till the next day. Scent\nfell before we began to sit, and at intervals during the day we had\nperceived it about my head.2\n1 July lUh.\u2014Seance. Mr. Percival joined us. Grocyn as usual, with\nvioloncello, harp, and tambourine ; sounds of a most distinctive and unmis\ntakable character. Mr. P. greatly astonished. The whistle heard. C.P.S.S.\ncame. Jasmine scent abundantly showered down both in the dining-room\nand bedroom. Large lights (held by large hands) seen emerging from the\ncabinet. Medium in deep trance as usual during lights. Flowers, from\ncentrepiece thrown about freely.\u2014S.T.S.\n2 Sunday, Jidy 20th.\u2014 Seanco with Mr. M., Mr. Harrison, and self. Mrs. S.\nin bed.

Stainton Moses. 319\nAugust 9th.\u2014We resumed our sitting, and Grocyn again mani\nfested very beautifully. Mentor showered scent, and I witnessed the\nformation of some eight or nine very beautiful spirit-lights. They\nformed quite close to me and near my left hand, about a foot from the\nfloor, floating upwards till they reached the level of the table and\nbecame visible to Dr. Speer. They were expressly made at my side,\ninstead of, as usual, at my back, so that I might see them. They\nseemed to develop from a very bright speck, about the size of a pea,\nuntil they attained the size of a soda water tumbler, and showed a soft\nluminosity like pale moonlight. They seemed to be covered with\ndrapery and to be held by a hand. They faded slowly out, remaining\nvisible about thirty or forty seconds, or perhaps a minute. The largest\nwould be about eight inches long.\nImperator came for a short control, and said that Mentor had made\nthe lights for me to see. They dared not do so in town when I was at\nwork, and it was not safe to make them except when I was without\nother demands on me. They were typical of the light the spirits shed,\nand had a spiritual meaning, as all spiritual phenomena had. Ho\n(irdinary knocks were heard (as I believe) on another small table and on a chair\nnear it. When asked to knock on the table, knocks of the sharpest kind\ncame on the table and then on the H6or. It was as if large glass marbles\nhad been thrown on the table, had bounded off on the floor, and then rolled\naway. Till a light was struck it was almost impossible not to believe that\nsuch had been the case. Two scents came ; one (by request) saturated a\npocket-handkerchief belonging to Mrs. S. Adieux. No lights.\u2014S.T.S.\n\f320 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nspoke very gravely and mournfully of the state of Mrs. Colt, who\nlies in London seriously ill with typhoid fever. Several com\nmunications have been made to me on that subject. One night\nat Enniskillen I was kept awake all night by loud raps. \" 111 \"\nwas all the communication I could get. Afterwards, at dinner\non the next day, when Dr. S. was present, raps came again. \" HI \"\nwas spelled, and when I asked who, \" B. C. \" was given, the initials of\nMrs. Colt's name. (On many occasions I have felt sympathetically ill,\nand have been told that the cause was the same.) Iniperator spoke\nvery mournfully and said that she was grievously ill. They did all\nthey could, but could not get near her. He said that seven spirits\nwere watching Mrs. Speer at Shanklin.\nAugust 10th.\u2014Dr. S. and self at Garrison [Ireland].\u2014The manifes\ntations commenced with Grocyn's lyre-sound, which was very clear and\nmelodious. Scent came, and then the lights\u2014some sixteen of them,\none after another, on both sides of me. They were large and clear and\nformed near the level of my knee, rising gradually above the table.\nAfterwards Mentor entranced me and spoke for more than half-an-\nhour to Dr. Speer. He describes his mode of speech as abrupt and\nthe tone as a hoarse whisper ; all unnecessary words left out. He\nexplained that he would bring a light on the table and knock with it.\nThis he did several times in succession, finally showing his hand in\nfront of the last. Dr. S. describes it as a well-formed hand. One of\nthe attendant spirits being noisy, Dr. S. said he feared the noise would\nawaken the inmates of the inn. Mentor said he would send him away.\nHe knocked three times and said, \" He is gone.\" He did not appear\nagain. This spirit resembles Rector very much, and is the personal\nattendant of Mentor, as Rector is of Imperator. He shakes the floor\nvery much like Rector. During this and the previous night loud\nknockings were heard in my room, and Dr. Speer was kept awake a\nlong time, three or four hours, by them. Mentor wished to put the\nlight in my hand, but failed in the attempt. On one occasion the\nadvent of scent was preluded by a prolonged whistle.1\n1 Detailed record of stances hdd at Garrison, Loch Melvin, N.

These knocks soon assumed the dropping\ncharacter in the most marked manner. A novice would have been positive that\nsmall objects had been thrown on the table (vide seance of July 20th). Knocks\nheard in other parts of the room. Scent (sandal-wood) was freely scattered,\nand on my asking for more we heard a sound like a prolonged wh sh,\nand then a quantity was actually squirted in my face. Suddenly a large\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 321\nAugust 1 \\th.\u2014Dr. S. and I, as before.\u2014Dr. S. had written an account\nof the last seance according to Mentor's direction, and we agreed to lay\nit on the table and to ask Mentor to sign it with his name. The mani\nfestations commenced by raps, succeeded by Grocyn's musical sound.\nThen came the lights as before, a dozen or more. They were precisely\nsimilar to what I have before described. I was then deeply entranced,\nand depend for the account of what then occurred entirely on Dr.\nSpeer. My consciousness is utterly lost. Mentor speaks in a hoarse\nwhisper, very short and sententious. Before I was entranced the\nlights were placed on the paper which we wished him to sign. After\nI was entranced Mentor brought the light down five or six times upon\nthe paper. He then said that he would illuminate the medium's face.\nHe did so, passing the light over it backwards and forwards. The\neyes were closed, and the face quite passive. He then explained the\nprocess of making the lights\u2014which Dr. Speer does not remember\u2014\u2022\nsaid that the light was surrounded by drapery, and to prove it he\nbrushed Dr. Speer's hand, which was on the table, backwards and\nforwards with fine drapery very distinctly materialised. This was\nrepeated five or six times, attention being directed to the character of\nthe light and the fineness of the drapery. On being requested, he\nplaced the light close to Dr. Speer's face, first of all telling him to\nlean over and place his hands on the table, within the sphere of\ninfluence. He was to shut his eyes, and to open them when told.\nWhen he did so, the light was within an inch of his face, very bright,\nlight, fully formed, came from under the edge of the table opposite\nto me, to the left of Mr. M. It rose above the edge of the table\nand vanished ; it was followed by several more. We asked if\nthe light could be brought and placed on the table between Mr.\nM. and self. The next light came up, rose above the table, and\nadvanced to its centre, in obedience to our request. Lights now rose up on\nMr. M.'s right hand ; some came close to his face. In all about fifteen great\nlights showed themselves, varying from the size of an orange to that of a\nshaddock. Grocyn's harp was now heard in the most distinct manner. The\nsounds were absolutely identical with those of a stringed instrument, without\na trace of the wooden character. Loud raps of three kinds occurred simul\ntaneously, and ere long Mr. M. was entranced and Mentor came and\naddressed me (through him) in his short, sententious manner. I thanked\nhim in our joint names for his wonderfully beautiful manifestations, at\nwhich he seemed much gratified. He then told me to draw back from the\ntable and he would try and place the light in the medium's hand. We con\ntinued talking, when a large light rose up from under the table and came to\nthe middle of it. It was followed by another. I asked if these were actually\nin the medium's hand. He said \"No\u2014he could not achieve it. But,\"\nsaid he, \"I will knock with the light in front of you.\" Almost immediately\na light came up as before, and advanced close to me upon the table. ' ' You\n\f322 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nand as largo as the globe of a moderator lamp. This was twice\nrepeated. He then told Dr. Speer to rub his hands together and on\nhis coat, and then to place them on the table. Soon a large bright\nlight came, held by a hand which was, as before, within the drapery ;\nbut before the light was another hand, which was worked about before\nthe light, so as to show it clearly. Dr. S. was again told to rub his\nhands on his coat and to place them on the table. When he had done\nso Mentor rapped on them with his hand holding the lamp. He then\nsaid that he was summoned away, but before he went he would\nendeavour to affix his mark to the paper which had been prepared. He\ndid so, the pencil being very plainly heard moving over the paper. The\nsign is facsimiled below.\nThe circle and interlaced triangles always accompany his signature. 1\nsee! You see I\" quoth Mentor. \"Yes, I see.\" \"Now listen, I knock.\"\nThe light rose slowly about three inches from the table on which it rested and\nstruck three distinct blows. Mentor repeated this six or seven times. He\nthen said, \"Now I show you my hand.\" A large, very bright light then\ncame up as before, casting a great reflection on the oilcloth, came up as\nbefore in front of me ; inside of it appeared the hand of Mentor, as distinct\nas it can well be conceived. \" You see ! You see !\" said he. \"That is my\nhand ; now I move my fingers,\" and he continued to move his fingers about\nfreely, just in front of my face. 1 thanked him for his consideration, and\nhe said he would show greater wonders still. I should say that before the\nlast light appeared he had told me to draw up and replace my hand. He\ntalked more about what we might expect if the favourable circumstances con\ntinued. He checked his lieutenant, who was stamping about the room in\ntoo demonstrative a manner ; gave me a special dose of scent ; told me to tran\nscribe accurately all I had seen and heard ; told me to make the medium\nwash his face in cold water before I related anything to him, and be sure\nand tell him everything. He laid great stress on this, and exhorted me\nstrongly. Wished me good-night and departed. \u2014S.T.S.\n1 August llth.\u2014Sat again at a quarter to ten. Raps began .almost imme\ndiately, and of the same character as on the preceding evening. I had placed\nthe written record of the previous seance (August 10th), together with a\npencil, in front of me. Grocyn again came. His sounds were perfect. Soon\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 323\nAugust \\ 2th.\u2014Dr. Speerand self, at G\u00bbrrison.\u2014We commenced by\nrubbing our hands, and raps at once occurred. Grocyn clear, and the\nwhistle, but not loud. Lights clear and large. Grocyn's sound led\nDr. S. to say it was like King David's harp. Grocyn at once called\nfor the alphabet and said, \" I know him.\" Dr. S. said : \" Extra\nordinary ! \" \"Not at all,\" said Grocyn. Imperator entranced me and\nsaid that the raps which had disturbed Dr. S. had been caused by the\nefforts of the band to prevent some undeveloped spirits from manifest\ning. We had been to an old churchyard where there were some\ncurious tombs, and some spirits had attached themselves in eagerness\nto manifest. He also said that I ought not to go to sleep in the day.\nI had taken a nap after dinner. He explained that the lights were\nmade from a germ of magnetism which was brought. This germ was\ninvisible to the natural eye, and continued so until it was surrounded\nby an envelope of something which was taken from the circle and\nmedium. This was covered with spiral drapery. Several of the lights\na large light came up from under the table, and came upon it. Knowing\nthat Mentor was present, I asked him to bring the light and illumine the\npaper, which he did at once, and repeated the operation three or four times.\nLight after light followed as before, when again loud raps all over the table,\nand Mr. M. became entranced. Mentor now spoke through him. I told\nhim what I had done, asked if he was satisfied, to which he replied\n\" Yes,\" and he would now show mo more. I asked for his sign-manual of\napproval to my record, upon which he at once brought a large light, and\nplaced it on it, so that I could see the writing. He said he would try and\ndo what I wished. He then said that he would illumine the medium's face.\nHe brought a large bright light, and passed it in front of his face, which I\ncould see. He then explained the process of making the lights, and told me\nthat the folds I saw around them hanging down were really drapery, which\nhe would prove to me. He then brought the light close to the back of my\nhand, and brushed it backwards and forwards with as distinct a materialised\ndrapery as can well be conceived. This feat he repeated first on one hand\nand then on the other, five or six times, at the same time directing my\nattention to the character of the light and the tangibility of the drapery. I\nthen asked if he could place a light close to my face. He assented,\ntold me to rub my hands briskly, lean forward, and close my eyes until\ntold to open them. I did so, and on opening them I saw within\napparently an inch or so of my face a large and very\nbright light of this shape, as large, indeed, as the globo\nof a moderator lamp. ||| J This was also repeated with\nequal success. He again told me to rub my hands on\nmy coat, and to extend them. Soon another large light came in front of me,\nheld, as on the previous evening, by a hand. On this occasion the hand ap\npeared to be outside the light, as it moved the fingers about freely ; and also\nremoved itself some inches from the light towards me and back again severa\ntimes, as though the light were held in the left hand, and the right hand placed\nin front of it at various distances. He again told me to rub my hands and\n\f324. The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\\\nwere made quite close to me. For all information during the trance\nstate I am indebted to Dr. Speer.\n[A specimen of Mr. Moses' letters to Mrs. Speer may here be given to\nshow the way in which he mixes up accounts of the phenomena with topics\nof private emotion :\u2014,\n\" You will have heard of our little seances at Garrison. They must have\nbeen very wonderful. I was, as usual, deeply entranced during the most\ninteresting parts. But I saw a great deal that was very wonderful indeed,\nand we got information about the mode of making the light that was very\ncurious. At the last seance Imperator introduced S., and gave us a message\nfrom him, promising that more would come in time. I have had very little\nwriting, but I expect I shall not get very much whilst I am moving about.\nWe were constantly wishing that you had been with us at Garrison. You\nwould have enjoyed the readiness with which Mentor manifested and the\neagerness with which he tried to show how he did everything. He brushed\nDr. Speer's hands with the drapery in which his light was shrouded, and\neven rapped on his hands as they were laid on the table. His hand was as.\nfully materialised and as natural as mine.\n\"Indeed, both his hands must have been materialised, for he put one\nbefore the light which was held in his other hand. It is all very wonderful\nand very convincing. He spoke with great contempt of London atmosphere,\nand of me as a medium under conditions of hard work. I expect that great\nresults would spring from conditions such as those which we had at Garrison,\nbut they are not attainable.\n\"Since I commenced this letter I have had a very long communication\nfrom Doctor, who has been absent for some time. He speaks a good deal\nof our friend, says she is ' grievously sick,' and that the direction of her\nmind to Spiritualism, which she associates with me, enables communications\nto bo made about her state. Doctor says he has no power of predicting the\nultimate result, but says she is in danger, as we call it, of being entirely\nseparated from the body, to which only the strong bond which binds her\nto her children yet unites her. Ho then says somewhat of our shortsighted\nness about what we call death. He says, in effect, God knows what we can't\nknow, and does all for the best. He then goes on to point out at very great\nlength the necessity of my praying most earnestly, heartily, and unceasingly,\nlisten. A light came and placed itself over my hand, and Mentor said ho\nwould knock with his hand on my hand, which he did, bringing the bottom\nof the light and his own hand most distinctly on the back of mine. He then\nsaid he must go to other work, but would try and write his signature. I\nthen heard the pencil writing, the sound being most distinct. He repeated\nhis admonition of the preceding evening, and departed, leaving a specimen\nof direct spirit caligraphy.\nIn the above account I have omitted to mention the manner in which\nMentor asked me to notice how he would renew the light. He withdrew\nhis hand gradually, and the light became fainter and fainter, till almost im\nperceptible. He then drew his hand in close proximity to the light, which\nappeared to grow brighter as the hand came m contact with it. I may add\nthat a small portion of the forearm was also visible.\u2014S.T.S.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses., 325-\nnot of any more specific petition than that the angel ministers may be able\nto reach her to soothe her pain in sickness, or in case of death to receive the\nspirit and to usher it into its new sphere. It is an exceedingly solemn\nexhortation. They say (Imperator said so, too, the other night) that they\ncan't get near on account of opposing influences. If I were nearer they\ncould, and my prayers might help more than I can imagine. They speak\nmost solemnly. I commend their advice to you, for I am sure that such\npetitions as you would put up would be at least as efficacious as any that I\ncould utter. If by such means we are enabled to soothe one pain, or to\nconvey to the sufferer's mind one feeling of rest, it becomes a sacred duty\nto use all endeavours. And none can tell how ' the slender nerve that\nmoves the muscles of Omnipotence ' may be able to bring down the sooth\ning and blessed influences of the holy angels, nor how far that influence\nmay extend. Only that our prayers are so selfish, I believe they would do\nfar more. The simpler they are the better ; the more comprehensive the\nmore powerful.\" ]\nSeptember Glh, 1873.\u2014Seance at Shanklin, Isle of Wight. Dr. and\nMrs. S., and self.\u2014Scent\u2014sandal-wood\u2014in profusion. Raps of various\nkinds. Grocyn. Lights made by Mentor. Control by Imperator and\nMentor. This being the first time that the circle had met since we\nseparated in July, the phenomena did not occur so strongly as usual.\nThe musical sound was very clear, and the lights, some six or seven in\nnumber, were of the usual type. The scent was very plentiful, and\nwas showered from the ceiling as usual. Imperator spoke somewhat of\nour lost friend (B.C.), and said she had not yet awoke.\nSunday, September Ith.\u2014Same place and circle.\u2014Raps and com\nmunications from A. W. and C.P.S.S. Scent. Lights, of a totally\ndifferent description. One, which remained visible for fully five\nminutes, was apparently a solid sphere of light about two inches in\ndiameter and six in length. It did not seem to be covered with\ndrapery, and shone with a clear, pale light. The great peculiarity was\nthe length of time it remained without renewal. Other lights have\nfaded very rapidly, lasting from ten seconds up to perhaps a minute.\nI believe I have considerably understated the time which this continued.\nAt request it touched us all, and was hard and cold. Several others\nfollowed. Three objects were brought into the room, one from the\ndining-room, one from Mrs. Speer's bedroom, and one from another\nroom in the house. A spirit, \" Harmony,\" came and rapped out in\nclear little taps : \" She is well ; still asleep.\" This spirit is one who\nhas never been incarnated on this earth. Imperator and Mentor\ncontrolled, the latter brushing Mrs. Speer's face and hands with drapery\nvery strongly materialised. Grocyn's sounds very clear. We put\ndown a piece of paper under the table, and had on it a message from\nA. W. and C.P.S.S. By mistake the same piece was put down again,\n\f326 The Experiences of W.

Grocyn's sounds were very good, clear and\nless wooden than of old. Mentor controlled very briefly and requested\nthe room to be made darker for the future. A bright moon was\nshining. Paper put under the table, as before, was found to contain a\nmessage from Imperator. There was no pencil with the paper, but two\nlay on the table during the evening.2\nTuesday, September 9th.\u2014Same conditions.\u2014Plentiful scent as\nbefore. Sixteen little pearls were put on the table, six having been\npreviously given during the day. Mrs. Speer and I were writing at\nthe same table, and a pearl was put on my letter as I was writing.\nAfter that I saw a spirit standing by Mrs. Speer, and was told that it\nwas Mentor, who had put a pearl on Mrs. Speer's desk. After that four\nothers came. They seemed to drop on the table, just as I have seen\nthem with Mrs. A h. [A private lady known to Mr. Moses and to\nmyself, whose experiences have never been published.\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nWe have in all twenty-two now. They are small seed pearls, each\nperforated. Mentor showed some wonderful lights. One was so large\nand brilliant that it lit up all our faces. It was like a draped tent\nwith bright light within it. The drapery brushed Dr. and Mrs. Speer's\nhands. Many of them were large, weird and ghost-like. Grocyn\nmanifested beautifully, and said on his harp that he could not play a\ntune through me, but that he was about Charlie, and Mendelssohn\nwould make him a great musician. We then were told to break, and\non returning to the room before it was darkened my little box with\nthe two pearls which Mrs. A h's spirits gave me slid gently\ninto my hand. It startled me very much. The box had been taken\naway and to my great grief I could get no tidings of it. Mrs. A.\ntold me they had been taken to smooth communications with our\nfriend Sunshine, and that they would be returned. Mentor brought\n1 September 7tlt.\u2014A splendid seance. Grocyn and Mentor.

This is one of the most startling evidences I have had.\nImperator brought us news of Sunshine, as Harmony could not come ;\nand said she slept still. All was well with her. He delivered a very\nlong and solemn charge, followed by a beautiful prayer. It was an\nexceedingly impressive speech. After the control I was very tired and\nexhausted. The seance only lasted one and a quarter hours, but was\nvery exhausting.1\nSeptember \\0lh, 1873.\u2014Shanklin, same conditions. \u2014Scent very\nabundant. Grocyn played very beautifully, doing exactly what we\nasked, even to playing octaves and thirds at Dr. Speer's request. Small\nlights. Imperator controlled for a short time and said that the condi\ntions were not good.2\nSeptember \\lth, 1873.\u2014Same place and circle.\u2014Very copious scent,\nvery sweet. Verbena, being asked for, was given. Waves of cool air,\nladen with scent, fanned us. Dr. Speer changed his place, and a\ngroaning noise in the table was made until he went back. Then we\nwere told that the places of the circle must not be changed. At first\nthe lights were a failure until the circle rubbed hands violently ; then\nthree of the brightest lights we have had came. The lights were large\nand draped in long drapery, and the light was brilliant enough to show\na forearm, bare to the elbow. The hand was quite plain, and the arm\nswarthy and rather thin, delicately shaped. It appeared three times.\nMentor afterwards said that in time he could materialise his body if I\n\u2022were put in a cabinet. Mentor spoke briefly. Imperator did not come\nat all. The lights in shape were such as this, but with the drapery\nsixteen or eighteen inches in length. Mentor wrote.3\n1 September 9th.\u2014Seance. Very good. Pearls brought in daylight.

Dr. and Mrs. S., and self.\u2014The\nphenomena commenced on our rubbing hands, which we did vigorously.\nImmediately, during the Invocation with which we began, a round light\nwas seen close to me, so close that I did not see it. Dr. S. saw it and\ncalled attention to it, when it went out at once. The lights rapidly\ndeveloped to an extraordinary pitch. They flashed about backwards\nand forwards with great rapidity, darting close to our faces and brushing\nthem with drapery. The solid cylinder was visible for full five\nminutes and was very brilliant. The drapery seemed to change colour\nat times, and to become black, or so dark as to conceal part of the light.\nThe solid cylinder seemed to be about eight inches long and two inches\nin diameter. Mentor controlled, and spoke at length. He brought a\ngreat quantity of scent, which he threw about, and some of it\nunfortunately went into Mrs. Speer's eye, causing us to break abruptly.\nIt was explained that the scent was brought to improve the atmo\nspheric conditions. It must have been very plentifully scattered, for\neverything was spotted with it, and was evidently very pungent and\nstrong. 1\nSunday, September 14th, 1873.\u2014Same circle and place.\u2014Raps\nfrom Mentor, who showed a number of lights, some of which were\ncomparative failures, the nucleus only being visible. This nucleus\nMentor has explained that he brings with him, and in unfavourable\nconditions he is not able to surround it with the luminosity which\nhe gets from the circle.

This is\nthe first time I have had opportunity of examining the drapery, and\neven now I have not handled it.\nGrocyn's sounds were more beautiful than I have ever heard them,\nI think ; clear, resonant, and bell-like.

A cylindrical light appeared at once, remained\nfor some minutes, came again, and moved about in every direction\nand at all heights with great rapidity. Other lights appeared, of\ncurious shapes. Scent thrown in great\nquantities\u2014so much was thrown at Mrs. S.'s\neye as to produce excruciating agony and con\ngestion of the eye, with almost blindness for 24\nhours.\u2014S.T.S.\n\fThe Experiences of W.

He answered (through\nhis harp) questions about Erasmus. Mentor fanned us repeatedly. Three\nsplendid lights appeared ; an arm was seen ; drapery repeatedly thrown over\nus.

I was occupied in my room about the proposed\ntime of our meeting, when several loud raps came on the door. On opening\nit no one was there, so I concluded the friends wished my presence in the\nseance-room. I at once joined the medium and Dr. S. On sitting down I\nsaw a bright figure standing behind Mr. S.M. We were told it was Mentor.\nHe then came between us, bringing cool air full of the scent of roses, which he\nwafted over our hands and faces. G. manifested, making more beautiful\nsounds than usual ; he answered our questions on his musical instrument,\nwhich sounded like a harp. He said he knew Erasmus, that he was seventeen\nyears of age when he came under his instructions ; he also knew Melancthon\nand Luther, of whom he did not express much approval. Mentor then\nshowed us lights, not equal to those we had previously had, but he was able\nto brush our hands with the drapery surrounding them, which felt very fine\nand soft, like India muslin. Then G. gave five twangs on his harp for the\nalphabet, spelling out the word, \" Break.\"\nOn returning to the room more beautiful scent was brought, and a little\nsprinkled on our hands. Mentor many times during the seance fanned me with\nthe scent-laden air. He then showed us two or three very large lights. One\nmust have measured with its drapery quite two feet in height ; he brought\nit close to my face, and brushed my hands many times with the drapery ; he\nalso touched my hand, and his hand felt as human as my own. Mentor\nthen controlled the medium, and expressed great sorrow for having\naccidentally hurt me at a previous seance. The lights were not good, as Mr.\nS.M. was ill, and the atmosphere was not right, and this interfered with\ntheir development. The medium then said he saw a fresh spirit standing by\nCatharine. She advanced to the table and rapped clearly. We were in\nformed it was the \" Maid of Kent,\" who had been allowed to come to the\ncircle for her good. We promised to pray for her. This announcement was\n\f330 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nOn September 28th we sat again. In the afternoon we had all\nbeen to Kensal Green Cemetery. We had all the usual phenomena,\nand in addition a spirit came which had annexed itself to me in the\nafternoon, and rapped very clearly, asking for a prayer. Raps all over\nthe room. Grocyn carried his sound right away from the circle. At\nnight I was kept awake by the Kensal Green spirit, who knocked\nmost violently. A board near me was considerably moved from the\nwall, as they wished to put it on the table.\nMonday, September 29<A.\u2014Douglas House.\u2014A very irregular, dis\nturbed seance. I was very far from well, tired and worn out with the\nnoise and worry of school. Nothing occurred for a long time, and we\nmade a short break. When we returned very little still occurred, until\nsharp raps came, quite outside of the circle. It was one of the same\nspirits who had annoyed me lately. It could not come on the table\nuntil we asked it, but knocked about outside. At last it came much\nmore gently on the table and asked for prayer. A very curious and\nquite new sound was made in the air, between Mrs. S. and myself ; a\nwhirring noise, sighing like the wind among the trees. I have since\nheard it in my bedroom. Grocyn manifested, but feebly. We had\nsome scent also. I noticed before it came that the air was pervaded\nby a damp, unplejisant odour. The whirring noise got so violent near\nto my right ear that I broke up the sitting. It was like a solid\nsubstance violently whirled round. The spirit would give no name\nbut \"S.\"\nSunday, October 5th, 1873.\u2014Douglas House. Our circle and Mr.\nreceived by many very jubilant raps. Imperator then controlled the\nmedium, and after saying, \"Good evening, friends,\" and blessing us, spoke\nfor a few minutes with difficulty. He said it would not be well to keep the\ncontrol, as the conditions were not good ; regretted the accident to my eyes,\nand said Doctor would give the medium some rules it would be well for all\nto follow. \"AVe groped,\" he said, \"in the dark even as they did. With\nmore perfect conditions the manifestations would surprise us. \" Our friend\n(to whom reference has been made) was still resting.

May the blessing of the Supreme be with\nyou.\" After Imperator left the medium. Mentor brought more scent, and\npresented flowers to each of the circle.

When we went up into the cabinet upstairs, Mentor\nmade some very clear lights, one of which endured over four minutes.\nI had been very anxious to try the duration of the light, because\nan imitation of such lights is made by phosphorised oil ; but lights\nso made are of very brief duration. I believe that a favourable\ntrial would show that Mentor's light would last seven or eight\nminutes.\nOctober 14th, 1873.\u2014Douglas House. Dr. and Mrs. S. and self.\u2014We\nsat in the study. Nothing occurred for some time. We remarked the\nunusual absence, and almost while we were speaking a little Parian\nstatuette was put upon the table. It was brought from the front bed\nroom, which I usually occupy when staying in the house. It was\nfollowed after an interval by a silver fruit-knife, which was brought\nfrom a closed workbox of Mrs. Speer's in the dining-room. We were\nthen left in peace, and wondered where Grocyn was. A spirit came\ntapping, and I asked that Grocyn might be fetched. It was rapped\nout: \"We are doing so.\" Mrs. S., who was calling the alphabet,\nstopped, imagining, as we all did, that the sentence was finished. How\never, the alphabet was called for, and \" mething else \" spelt. We could\nnot conceive what was meant till it occurred to us to put the \"so\" on to\nit, and we found the sentence to be : \" We are doing something else.\"\n\"We were told to form hands, and something fell on the table, which\nturned out to be a snuff-box from Dr. Speer's dressing-room. Before\n,it came he said that he smelt Tonquin bean, which had been in\nthe box. A curious snapping noise was heard in the air ; we had\nscent-laden breeze, and then Grocyn came. Dr. S. had procured,\nunknown to me, a book (Drummond's Life ofErasmus), from which he\nselected test questions. Grocyn had before told us that he had become\nacquainted with Erasmus at the age of seventeen. This, we had\nthought, meant that E. became G.'s pupil at that time. We thought\nthat this contradicted the book, and Dr. S. quoted the book against\nGrocyn. G. indignantly twanged out \" Imperfect,\" and proceeded to\nexplain that he made E.'s acquaintance first when he went to Padua,\nthat E. came to England in 1798 and remained one and a-half years.\nHe also spelt the year of his birth, 1767, making him thirty-one when\nhe came to England. Dr. S. said, \" No, thirty.\" Grocyn, however,\ncontradicted very sharply. The twangs had a curious intensity, just\nas expressive as the excited tone of a disputant. Asked by Dr. S.\nwhether he knew the name of Chalcelydes, he promptly said \" No.\"\nz\n\f332 The Experiences of TP. Stainton Moses.\nDr. S. said : \" He was your tutor.\" \" No.\" \" But he was.\" \" No.\"\n\" Do you know Domitian ? \" \"No.\" \"Polonius?\" \"No.\" Calling\nfor the alphabet he twanged out : \" Demetrius Chalcondyles,\" and\nafterwards \"Politian.\"\nThese turned out to be the correct names. We referred to the book\nafterwards and found that Dr. S. had mistaken or forgotten the names.\nThe fact of Erasmus' staying one and a-half years we none of us\nknew, and that Grocyn studied at Paris is not mentioned in the book. It\nwas a very curious piece of evidence as to identity. Some of the facts\nwere unknown to any of us. Some, e.g., names and dates, were wrongly\nread and given, and were corrected promptly, the communicating spirit\nshowing just the same impatience as a man would who was examined\nas to his life and heard false statements made. The twangs were of\ngreat intensity, and the spirit showed a complete acquaintance with\nGrocyn's life, which is a very strong argument for identity. One\nwould think a personator would not have got so indignant. He got\nvery wroth indeed. It was altogether curious evidence for identity as\nagainst unconscious cerebration. The dropping sound of Seneca was\nvery loud indeed, and frequently repeated both on the table and\nharmonium stool.1\nEnd of Citations from Mb. Moses' Notes.\n1 Seance on October 14ifc.\u2014Mrs. S., Mr. M., and self.\u2014For some time\nnothing occurred, but then raps were heard in various places\u2014on the floor, Mr.\nM.'s chair, on the cupboard, in the air. Presently a small marble statuette\nwas brought from the spare bedroom upstairs, through the locked door,\nand thrown on the table. Ere long a silver clasped fruit-knife was similarly\nbrought from a workbox in the dining-room. Shortly afterwards I per\nceived an aroma as of a Tonquin bean, and (we had been previously told to\njoin hands) a snuff-box which I had placed upon the chimney-piece of my\ndressing-room upstairs was thrown on the table. After this there was a\npause ; we expressed astonishment at not hearing Grocyn, and asked if he\ncould be fetched. \" We are doing so,\" was the reply ; but we jumped pre\nmaturely at our conclusion, for on resuming alphabet we were much puzzled\nby the words \" \u2014mething else,\" the phrase standing thus, \"We are doing\nsomething else.\" This, in reality, preceded the appearance of the snuff-box,\nand doubtless referred to it. After another pause Grocyn came most dis\ntinctly. I at once entered into conversation with him respecting Drum-\nmond's Life of Erasmus and the mention of his own name, &c., in that\nwork. I asked for the initial of the country he (Grocyn) had studied at, and\nit was given, \"Italy, University Padua.\" I asked if he knew the names\nof Dionysius Calcedonys, and of Polonius ; answer negative. I remon\nstrated, having written those names down the day before from Drummond's\nwork. He then asked for alphabet, and gave the following names, which, on\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 333\nI here close for the present the series of quotations from Mr.\nMoses' records. We have traversed just a year from the date\u2014\nNovember, 1872\u2014when the continuous series of these records begins.\nAnd the reader has been introduced to nearly all the classes of\nphenomena, which continue in varying intensity for some six or seven\nyears longer. It will not be necessary to follow them to the end in\nequal detail. But, on the other hand, in the next instalment of\nevidence we must deal with Mr. Moses' automatic writings as well,\nand we must endeavour to give some such general view as may throw\nlight on the difficult question of the nature and identity of the\nintelligences at work. Can we ascribe all the phenomena to some\noperation of Mr. Moses' own subliminal self 1 or were other intelligences\nengaged 1 and, if so, did they in any sense correspond to the persons\nunder whose names they announced themselves 1\nBut although anything like a comprehensive survey of the\nphenomena must thus be deferred for a further paper, some clearness\nmay meantime be gained by a brief preliminary classification,\u2014which\nmay also indicate the kind of difficulties which each possible explana\ntion of the records will have to meet.\nI. In the first place, as already implied, it is manifest that all the\nphenomena do in some sort cohere together, and form parts of a single\nreferring to Drummond's work, were found to be perfectly correct :\nDemetrius Chalcondyles, and Politian. He said he had studied at Paris ;\nthat Erasmus remained a year and a-half at Oxford, and arrived there at the\nage of thirty-eight. All this was found (on reference) to be perfectly correct,\nalthough no one had any knowledge of the latter facts, and the medium had\nnever seen the work of Drummond. The singular part of the scene con\nsisted in the extraordinary evidence of personal feeling made by Grocyn\nthrough the medium of his harp. The sounds were typical of approval,\ndisapproval, anger, impatience, and on one occasion a powerful string\nsound changed instantly into a parchment sound. After a pause two\nmost violent blows fell on the table, so that we instinctively extended our\nhands to seek the fallen objects. Nothing was to be felt. Mrs. S. being\nsomewhat startled, we suggested moderation. The' sounds were transferred\nto the harmonium, rolling from that upon the stool, then on the floor, and\nunder the table towards my chair. This occurred upwards of fifteen times,\nand would have led anyone not accustomed to these manifestations to expect\nto find a corresponding number of hard bodies on the floor. Needless to say,\nnothing was found.\nGrocyn's information forms, 1 conceive, a most important contribution\nto the much vexed question of personal identity.\u2014S.T.S.\n[This and similar biographies will be the subject]bf discussion later.\n\u2014F.W.H.M.]\nZ 2\n\f334 The Experiences of TP. Stainton Moses.\nand prolonged effort, whose constantly avowed aim is the promulgation\nof important truth. The authors of the automatic writing assert in\nall possible ways that they are the authors of the physical phenomena\nas well. Each series presupposes and refers to the other. The trance-\naddresses given at the seances are continued by the messages written in\nprivacy. The phenomena of the seances are predicted in the automatic\nscript, and similar phenomena sometimes occur to Mr. Moses when\nalone. Nay, the actual writing itself is common to both series. The\n\" controls \" who write by Mr. Moses' hand as he sits alone produce in\nthe seance-room \"direct writing,\"\u2014inscribing their names on blank\npaper without the intervention of any human hand. The signatures of\nthe automatic and the direct script are practically identical ;\u2014the only\ndifference being that the direct script looks as though written with\ngreater effort. Whatever element, then, either of weakness or of\nstrength is to be found in any part of Mr. Moses' evidence, that\nstrength or weakness affects all the evidence alike.\nII. The relation between what we should call objective and what\nwe should call subjective phenomena is in fact much more complex\nthan is implied in mere community of origin. This matter is treated\nof in the automatic script, and our discussion must be deferred until\nwe have those statements before us. Meantime it is well to point out\nthat the phenomena alleged go far beyond mere \"telekinesis,\"\u2014that\npower of moving objects at a small distance from the body which, as\nwas suggested in a previous paper, may conceivably be a power\ninexplicably inherent in man in somewhat the same way as the power\nto move his own limbs is inexplicably inherent. In these records we\nfind asserted what we can only describe as a transcendental chemistry ;\n\u2014a power of producing light without heat, like the glow-worm ; a power\nof overcoming the force of cohesion, of disaggregating matter and re-\naggregating it in the same or different forms ;\u2014-and even a power of\nsimulating in this re-aggregated matter that initiative and self-adaptive-\nness to which we give the name of life.\nIII. One more comment on the phenomena as a whole will not be\nsuperfluous. To the ordinary reader these marvels will inevitably\nappear arbitrary and incoherent. He will think that one might as\nwell have copied the so-called \" phenomena \" straight from the Arabian\nNights ; have asserted that Mr. Moses was made half of flesh and\nhalf of marble ; or that he flew on a wishing-carpet ; or that the\ngenie burst out of the bottle in a pillar of smoke. There is, however,\nsomething more of method in this apparent madness, although it is\na method which we can as yet only observe and not explain.\nThe fact is that the phenomena alleged to occur at seances may be\ndivided roughly into three classes :\u2014\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 335\n1.\u2014The first and by far the largest class consists of tricks whose\nmechanism is perfectly well known,\u2014as well known as the way\nin which the ordinary avowed conjurer produces the rabbit from\nthe hat. These tricks, indeed, are generally on a lower level\nthan those of the conjurer at a fair ; but in spite of repeated\nexposures they serve, when dished up with the appropriate\n\" patter,\" to deceive the great mass of wonder-seekers bent on\nthe supernatural.\n2.\u2014The second class consists of phenomena somewhat similar to\nthose of the first class, but not at present reproducible by\nordinary conjurers. If these are genuine, then we may call the\nfirst class imitations of them. If they are fraudulent, they\nindicate that here and there a so-called \" medium \" has pro\nfessional secrets of his own.\n3.\u2014The third class consists of a few rarely attested phenomena,\nof which Home's fire-test is an example, which are not only not\ncompletely imitated, but are not imitated with any kind of\nplausibility, by even the most accomplished conjurers. Here\nwe have to assume either genuine phenomena, or some kind of\nhallucination induced in the observers in some not readily\nimitable way.\nNow, in no one of these classes is the range of alleged phenomena\nvery wide ; and the phenomena in each class have a certain analogy\nto the rest. Such an analogy can of course be explained in\ntwo ways. Either all these phenomena are conjuring tricks, of which\nsome are better and some are worse ; or some of the phenomena are\nreal, and the rest are imitations, which aim less successfully at the\nsame effects. At this moment, however, I am not discussing the\nquestion of fraud, but merely showing that the phenomena, true or\nfalse, are constantly and independently repeated, and have not,\ntherefore, the arbitrariness and unexpectedness which characterise the\nmarvels of the Arabian Nights. The simplest way of showing this\nwill be to set aside all performances of paid mediums, and taking only\nsuch non-venal phenomena as have been printed in our Proceedings\nand Journal as possessing a primafacie claim to confidence, to exhibit\n\f336 The Experiences of W.

In minor cases also recorded in Proceedings and Journal\nthe phenomena have been much the same.\nI repeat that this general concordance of phenomena does not in\nitself prove anything except that the phenomena are not alleged at\nrandom. In the same way the general concordance of automatic\nteachings does not in itself prove anything except that the subliminal\nself thinks by preference in certain directions. But in each case, in\nthat of the \" physical \" and in that of the \" intellectual \" manifestations,\nthese general tendencies are likely, in some direction or other, to point\nthe way towards an ultimate explanation.\n1 I have added M. de Gasparin's phenomena, not yet printed in Procetdingt\nS.P.R., but mentioned by Mrs. Sidgwick in her article on \"Spiritualism\" in\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica ; and some incidents recorded by Professor Barrett\nin the Dublin University Magazine for December, 1877, with some of Home's\nphenomena not specified in the articles on him in S.P.R. Journal. The other\nphenomena referred to will be found as follows :\u2014Bristowe, Proc., Vol. VII., p. 383 :\nDariex, Vol. VII., p. 194: Davis, Vol. VII., p. 173: \"Mr. H.,\" Vol. VII., p. 189:\nD. D. Home, Journal Vol. IV., pp. 141, 249; Mr. 0,'s friend, .Proc.Vol. IX., p. 121.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 337\nAnd now for a few words on the origin of these phenomena, if\nthey were not in fact the supernormal occurrences which they pretend\nto be.\nCollective hallucination,\u2014the first idea which will present itself to\nthose who realise the strength here of the testimony to character,\n\u2014seems excluded by the number of permanent traces which the\nphenomena left behind them. If objects are brought during the\nseance out of rooms which Mr. Moses had never avowedly entered, and\nare actually found and remain in the seance-room afterwards, there has\nbeen more than a hallucinatory percept ;\u2014a transposition of matter, by\nnormal or supernormal means, has actually been effected. Evidence of\nthis kind abounds in the records in question.\nShall we say, then, that the phenomena never occurred at all?\nthat the records are from first to last absolutely false, and concocted to\ndeceive the world, with no basis whatever ? This view might have\nbeen upheld had the circle been always restricted to Mr. Moses and\nthe Speer family. But it was not so restricted. Some dozen other\npersons, who cannot plausibly be held to be all in the fraud, witnessed\nthe phenomena. It is true that some of these witnesses are now dead\nor inaccessible. But Serjeant Cox left a printed statement ; Dr.\nThomson, of Clifton, proved his belief by continued collaboration ;\nMr. Percival, Mrs. Garratt, Miss Collins, and Mrs. Honeywood are still\nliving, and cannot with any plausibility be treated as accomplices. Mr.\nPercival's evidence, in particular, is that of an outside and occasional\nmember of the group, who is honourably known in academic and official\nlife, and who would have had everything to lose and nothing to gain by\ncomplicity in such a fraud. He and Serjeant Cox and Mrs. Honeywood\nand the rest may of course have been dupes ; but at least their testimony\nshows that something sufficiently like Mrs. Speer's published record to\nenable them to subscribe to its general accuracy did actually occur.1\nPrinted testimony from Mr. Percival has already been quoted, and\nwill be quoted again in a further paper. He was, moreover, a principal\nredactor of such trance-utterances as were given in his presence ; and\nthus Mrs. Speer's records printed in Light are largely due to him. As\nan intimate friend he was kept well informed of the progress of the\nphenomena throughout ; and it was, in fact, from him mainly that\nEdmund Gurney and I received convincing verbal corroboration of Mr.\nMoses' statements after our early interviews with Mr. Moses himself.\n1 Just as this paper passes through the press two important MS, booksof the late\nMiss Birkett, who died in 1881, have been found and sent to me. They contain con\ntemporary notes of various seances between 1874-1880 at which Miss Birkett was\npresent (which notes, so far as I have yet studied them, appear fully corroborative\nof Mrs. Speer's accounts), and add some interesting matter. These notes will be con\nsidered in the next paper. Mrs. Garratt has also kindly Bent me contemporary note\nof a few seances,\u2014also concordant, to be mentioned hereafter.\n\f338 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nThe testimony of an occasional member of the circle has been sent\nto me as follows :\u2014\nChadbury, Evesham, Worcestershire.\nDecember 6th, 1893.\nI was witness to the following phenomena, which took place at some of\nthe seances held at the house of Dr. and Mrs. Speer, under the mediumship\nof Mr. S. Moses. Some of the raps were very loud, others clear, small and\nrapid. The musical sounds were varied. I can describe one as soft and like\nan Eolian harp passing through the air, another like the chord of a violon\ncello pulled very strongly and reverberating through the large dining-table.\nA small stone cross was brought to me, delicious scents pervaded the\natmosphere, and floating lights were visible in many parts of the room.\nHelen C. Collins.\nAnother friend of Dr. Speer's, well known to myself, is Dr. Rooke,\na practising physician, of 7, Bays Hill-villas, Cheltenham. Dr. Rooke\nwrites to Mrs. Speer, November 23rd, 1893 :\u2014\n\"As regards communications I had from Dr. Speer in. re Spiritualism, I\nhad a good many, taken altogether, and spread over the whole time from his\nfirst becoming interested in the subject. I well recollect that he and Mr.\nMoses spent a Sunday afternoon at my house, shortly after their Isle of Man\nexperiences, and the account they gave me of the disturbance of articles in one\nof their bedrooms and the symmetrical way in which heterogeneous objects\nhad been arranged on the bed, the room having been previously locked, and\nthey having taken precautions against tricks on the part of any servant, and\nI think also articles being also apparently brought through closed doors.\nThen again, after several letters on the matter I had from Dr. S., he came\ndown to Cheltenham and stayed some days with us (you were not with\nhim), in which we talked the whole matter over repeatedly. He described\nyour stances at your own house and the various physical phenomena which you\nhave lately published an account of. I well recollect his laying stress on the\nponderous shaking of the furniture and floor of the room which one of your\nspiritual visitors was in the habit of producing. He, like myself, was far\nmore interested m abnormal physical phenomena than in any trance mani\nfestations or spirit-teachings through the mouth of any medium. \"\nDr. Rooke encloses a letter from Dr. Speer, which is worth quoting,\nas the only letter which I have seen in which Dr. Speer describes the\nphenomena to a friend outside the special group. It is dated 13,\nAlexandra-road [Douglas House], N.W., July 13th, 1874.\n\" We have had two new spirits, one, ' Kabyla,' an old Indian, passed\nthousands of years ago ; he has brought a new light, and materialised some\nbeautiful fine spirit drapery (upon his first attempt), which he swept over\nour hands. We had last night an admirable specimen of zither playing,\nfor a length of time. The performer (we don't know his name yet) actually\nperformed what is called a free prelude; that is to say, a short unbarred\ncomposition. The whole thing was most marvellous, for there is no zither\nin our house, and it is an instrument that cannot be mistaken. Indeed, on\nhis departure, Grocyn, who dropped in immediately after for a chat, produced\nhis own sounds, and the contrast was of the most decided character.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 339\n\" Tho other evening a new comer slipped in, and stank us out of the room\n\"by throwing down from the ceiling a large quantity of Sp. Pulegii. Every\nthing that it touched was impregnated for 24 hours. The dining-room cloth\nand my own nether habiliments had to be exposed to view in the back\ngarden ; and on the following morning our dining-room floor and passage had\nto be freely fumigated with pastilles. That spirit has not been invited to join\nus again.\"\nDr. Speer was by no means given (Mrs. Speer tells me) to prosely-\ntism ; and having met with some sneers when he alluded to these\nphenomena in the presence of scientific friends he formed the habit of\nsaying little about them. I can, however, add here a letter from an\nintimate friend of Dr. and Mrs. Speer, to whom the phenomena\nwere communicated during their progress :\u2014\n96, Great Portland-street, London, W.\nNovember 23rd, 1893.\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014I have no hesitation, but a ready willingness, in replying\nto your request in the letter of yesterday, that 1 add my testimony to those\nof the late Stainton Moses' friends who are in a position to offer an opinion\non the value attaching to the chief witnesses who were privileged to be\npresent at the series of experimental psychology with that famous sensitive,\nviz., Dr. and Mrs. Speer.\nI had the honour to be accounted by them as a friend, and knew them\nboth in their home, and the late Dr. Speer as a club friend as well. We\noften talked over those well-attested experiments, and I was frequently\nshown the place and nature of their conduct and of the truly \" staggering\"\nphenomena which were continually being evolved. The smallest details,\nwith substantial permanent effects, such as direct writing and production\nof objects unknown previously to the persons present, were entered into in\nreply to my sceptical inquiries and suggestions ; and Dr. Speer, with\nwhom I claimed common possession of \"agnostic\" views, yielded me the\nopportunity of measuring his capacity as a logical thinker free from pre\nconceived opinions touching the matter in hand. He used to acknowledge\nhis difficulty in accepting the \"logic of facts,\" but the inevitable working\nof an open mind left him no alternative. The effect of such a contact of our\nminds led me to accept his testimony as unquestionable and possessing the\nvalue of absolute and verifiable facts.\nWith regard to Mrs. Speer, that lady, responding to my desire for\ninformation at the source, helped me in every way to the best of her ability.\nHer method was to put before me the facts, to show me some of the records,\nto describe the conditions under which the seances were conducted, to\nexhibit the material results, and with the patience of an experimentabst in\nthe pursuit of scientific investigation.\nI cannot but think that those two witnesses, each in their own way, and\nsupplementing each other, were imbued with the desire to seek out the\ntreasures of knowledge and make use of the opportunities so fortunately\nthrown in their path.\nHealthier minds, pursuing their special object with greater success and\nsounder judgment, I never met.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nJ. Feed. Collingwood.\n\f340 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nWho, then, was implicated in the fraud, if fraud there were ? Mr.\nMoses himself must, of course, have been primarily concerned. Bui\ncan we say that he performed the tricks in an unconscious state?\nOr, whatever his own state may have been, can we say that he\nperformed the tricks alone ? or with accomplices other than the Speers 1\nor with only one of the Speers to help him ? or must the whole Speer\nfamily be involved ?\nAnd first as to the hypothesis which would throw the blame on Mr.\nMoses' \" subliminal self.\" Mr. Moses, by his own account, fell into\ntrances, both during the seances, in his friends' presence, and also\noccasionally when alone in his rooms, as his automatic writings show.\nAnd besides these unmistakable trances, he was (as he himself told\nme) once at least for some days in a state of exaltation, which did\nnot, indeed, prevent him from going through his routine school-work\nwithout attracting comment, but which so far abstracted him from\nordinary life that acts then performed would not necessarily have been\nremembered afterwards. This was in direct connection with long\nreligious messages which were then being written through his hand,\nand which deeply moved him. And on one other occasion at least,\nhereafter to be mentioned, he became entranced for a few seconds in\nthe course of ordinary talk, and uttered a sentence of which he had\nno subsequent memory.\nThese facts should certainly make us receive with hesitation such\naccounts as Mr. Moses gives of physical phenomena occurring when he\nwas alone. Thus, when on one occasion he mentions in his note-book\nthat his coat, ifec., had been disarranged during the night, we may well\nsuppose that he himself may have unconsciously moved them. The\nsame remark would apply to any easily producible phenomenon which\noccurred during the seances, when he was in a trance in the dark.\nOn the other hand, we are told (and the existence of copious notes\nof his trance-addresses confirms the statement) that frequently when\nhe was perceived by his fellow-sitters to bo in a trance, they lit a\ncandle to take down his utterances\u2014and could then, of course, see\nhim as he sat at the table with them\u2014while raps, apparently in various\nparts of the room, continued as usual. On other occasions, no doubt,\nhe was entranced while musical sounds were heard, and scent fell, and\nglobes of light sailed about the room. But these tricks, if tricks they\nwere, were not such as a somnambulist could improvise, and then wake\nup and forget them. No conjurer is so gifted as to find gold fish and\ntubes of water under his trick-shirt unless he has previously put them\nthere. Nor would bladders of phosphorised oil occur spontaneously in\nMr. Moses' pockets, accompanied with a strong smell of otto of roses.\nThe tricks, in fact, would have had to be carefully and continuously\nprepared and maintained ; and to say of a busy, active schoolmaster,\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 34>I\nmost of whose time was passed in his class-room or on the top of an\nomnibus, that he was always packing himself with guitars, phosphorus,\nlarge stones, Chinese chessmen, and small objects from the bedrooms of\nhis female friends, in a state of distraction, comes too near the indig\nnant reclamations of the wives of materialising mediums, who maintain\nthat false beards and dirty muslin are secreted about their husbands'\npersons by spirit-power.\nNo, if fraud there were, Mr. Moses may no doubt have been pre\ndisposed to such fraud by some peculiarity of temperament, but the\nfraud was committed, I cannot doubt, with the knowledge and\ncomplicity of every stratum of his being.1\nBut, in the next place, can we suppose that Mr. Moses, granting\nhim the use of all his faculties and full preparation, could by his own\nact alone have imposed upon the other sitters 1\nOn this point, unfortunately, the very completeness of the\nconfidence which the Speers felt in their friend's probity has interfered\nwith the preservation of the kind of record which we desire. The\nwhole party were interested in watching the phenomena, and not in\nwatching each other, and the casual way in which even so important an\nevidential point as the existence of a light in the seance-room is\nalluded to shows how subordinate the conditions of the phenomena\nsoon came to be in comparison with the phenomena themselves. Soon\n1 Though perhaps somewhat out of place, two testimonials to Mr. Moses may here\nbe inserted, which have been printed by Mr. Speer in his memoir above referred to.\nThe first, from Maughold Parishioners, on his resigning that cure, runs as follows :\u2014\n\" 'Rkv. and Dear Sir,\u2014We, the undersigned parishionersof Maughold, are much\nconcerned to learn that it is your intention shortly to resign the position which you\nhave for some years past so usefully and honourably occupied amongstus. We beg to\nassure you that your labours have been greatly appreciated in the parish. The longer\nwe have known you, and the more we have seen of your work, the greater has our\nregard for you increased. The congregations at both the churches under your charge\nare very different in numbers to what they were some time ago. The schools hare\nbeen better looked after ; the aged and infirm have been visited and comforted ; and\nthe poor have been cheered and helped by your kindness and liberality. By your\ncourteous demeanour, by your friendly intercourse, and by your attention to the duties\nof the parish generally, you have greatly endeared yourself to us all ; and not least to\nour respected and venerable Vicar, whose hands we are well satisfied you have done\nall you possibly could to strengthen. We cannot but feel that your loss will be a very\nserious one to the parish, and we should be glad if you could aee your way to remain\ning some time longer with us. By reconsidering your determination, and consenting\nto remain, you would place us under a deep debt of gratitude and obligation.'\n\" Here follow the signatures of the Rector and Churchwardens, also of fifty-four\nof the principal inhabitants of the district.\"\u2014Spirit Teaching!, Memorial Edition,\n1894, p. viL '\nAgain, on page ix. we find notice of another collective expression of esteem.\n\" On resigning his post through ill-health, the Council of University College\npassed a resolution conveying to Stainton Moses their best thanks for his long and\nvaluable service to the school, and a special letter of affectionate regret was also sent\nto him, signed by twenty-eight of his colleagues.\"\n\f342 The Experiences of W. Slainton Moses.\n>\ncame to be, I say, for Mrs. Speer and her son unite in saying that in\nthe earlier days Dr. Speer was really on the alert as to \" test\nconditions \" ;\u2014Mr. Charlton Speer remembering, for instance, that his\nfather had the legs of the large dining-table unscrewed, and the leaves\nseparated, when the first raps were heard, in order to satisfy himself\nthat no tricks had been played with that respectable piece of furniture.\nBut we have here largely to depend upon recollections, such as those\ncontained in the following letters :\u2014\nVentnor.\nNovember 29<\/i, 1893.\nI wish to state that the most convincing evidences of spirit-power always\ntook place when hands were held.\nOther manifestations occurred often in light, such as raps, raising of\ntable, scent, musical sounds, and showers of pearls. Lights also appeared\nall over the room, coming and going by request, and rapping also by request\nin different parts of the room.\nA book was once brought in light out of one room and put into Mr.\n8. M.'s hands, while Dr. Speer was sitting at his side in another room.\nI saw a knife jump out of the butter dish and fall on to the table in light.\nOn one occasion the medium fell on to the floor in a deep trance, while\nGrocyn was making most startling musical sounds, and at the same time\nCatharine was rapping loudly to attract our attention, as she wished to give\na message to tell us to help Mr. S. M.\nTwo cameos were carved in light while we were dining, and message\ngiven, through raps, to tell us where to find them. This was a very common\noccurrence, as frequent raps and messages would be given while dining in\nlight.\nAt one seance as many as seven different sounds were going on at the\nsame time in different parts of the room. It would have been quite\nimpossible for any one person to have made them.\nMaria Speer.\nGlenhurst, The Common, Sutton, Surrey.\nNovember 27th, 1893.\nReferring to your letter of November 17th, in which you ask for more\nproof of the fact that Mr. Stainton Moses could not personally have\nperformed the manifestations which occurred through his mediumship, I can\nonly say that when I joined the circle it had been holding its investigations\nfor several years, and that the minds of the original sitters had been quite\nconvinced that it was out of the power of any of their members to have\nproduced the phenomena by trickery or conjuring. When they first sat\neverything that happened was subjected to a rigid scrutiny, and test con\nditions were imposed with completely satisfactory results. However, during\nthe time that I sat with the circle I may draw your attention to the follow\ning points :\u2014\n(1) That we sometimes had a light during the progress of the mani\nfestations.\n(2) That the phenomena were not confined to any one part of the room,\nbut took place indifferently near the medium and some distance\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 343\nremoved from him ; also that sounds were heard at various heights\nextending from the floor to the ceiling, and the lights, as often as\nnot, were first seen approaching from the opposite side of the room\nto that on which the medium sat.\n(3) That the phenomena occurred just as freely in one room as in\nanother, and were in nowise affected by the seance being held in\nother houses, and other places many miles removed from London.\nThis does away with the somewhat humorous theory of mechanical\ncontrivances.\n(4) That when the medium was in a state of trance we always lit a candle\nin order to take notes of what the controlling spirit had to say.\nDuring the control the medium's hands and face could therefore bo\nplainly seen, and even then raps could be heard in other parts of the\nroom.\n(5) We often tried, without success, to imitate the various raps, thus\nshowing that the sounds produced (by the outside intelligences) did\nnot depend for the quality of their tone upon the nature of the\nsubstance of the table, or whatever other object was apparently\nused in their manufacture.\nCharlton T. Speeb.\nMr. Percival, for whose return from abroad I have waited, before\nprinting off the end of this paper, sends me the following letter :\u2014\nSproughton Manor, Ipswich.\nDecember 25th, 1893.\nMy Dear Myers,\u2014I was an intimate friend of the late W. Stainton\nMoses for nearly 20 years, and I regard him aa one of the most truthful and\nupright men I have ever known. I attended a considerable number of\nseances at Douglas House, and I am convinced that it was physically\nimpossible for him to have produced such a manifestation as the \" shaking\nof the floor \" of the seance room, which frequently occurred. I also believe\nthat manifestations such as raps and lights were often produced while he was\nin a state of deep trance. With regard to the seances described in your\npaper, at which I myself was present, I can fully endorse the records of the\nother sitters ; I took notes at the time, which I still possess, and they have\nbeen used by Mrs. Speer. I always considered W. Stainton Moses to be a\nman of unusual ability, and I believe he would have succeeded in almost any\nline of life which he might have taken up. His mind was perfectly free\nfrom delusions of any kind, so far as I can judge, and in all the affairs of\ndaily life he was eminently practical and conscientious.\u2014Yours very sincerely,\nF. W. Percival.\nThese letters, although of course not equal in evidential value to the\ncontemporary notes, appear to me to be concordant with those notes, in\nwhich, as will already have been observed, sittings in full or half-light\nand sittings with hands held are occasionally mentioned, and mentioned\nin an incidental fashion which suggests that there has been no special\neffort made to pick out the most evidential occurrences.\n\f344 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nFurther than this, I repeat, we cannot now go ; and the looseness\nof the record on these points may serve to enforce the lesson that all\nrecords of supernormal occurrences, however intimate the group among\nwhom they occur may be, should be kept with as much as possible of\nthe precision usual in ordinary physical experimentation. There is no\nsaying what point may afterwards be raised, what doubt expressed,\nwhich a few words in the contemporaneous record would have cleared\nup altogether.\nAnd now, assuming, as I think many readers will do, that Mr.\nMoses could not have performed all these supposed tricks unaided,\ncan we suggest any accomplice other than the Speers themselves 1\nCould he, for instance, have suborned their servants 1\nBut the phenomena occurred not only in Dr. Speer's house, or in\nhouses rented by him, but in the houses of other friends (Dr. Thomson,\nMrs. Honeywood, Serjeant Cox) and in ordinary sea-side lodgings\n(Southend, Shanklin, tfec.), and especially at a little inn at Garrison, an\nIrish village, to which Dr. Speer and Mr. Moses had gone for some\nfishing. It would have been hard to transport either accomplices or\napparatus to all these places in turn.\nAnd now another point suggests itself. What was the attitude of\nthe younger Speers, the son and daughter, who were children when the\nmanifestations began, but were admitted to the seances about 1877,\nwhen the phenomena were already on the decline 1 Can we suppose\nthat Mr. Moses was in league with their parents to deceive them, or\nwere they also members of the supposed plot ? I have already cited a\nbrief letter in which Mr. Charlton Speer gives reasons for believing\nthat he was not deceived by Mr. Moses. I subjoin a longer account\nfrom him, and a brief note from Miss Speer, who is an invalid. It\nwill, I think, be felt that Mr. Charlton Speer cannot be separated\nfrom his parents in the matter. Honest or otherwise, his position is\nthe same as theirs.\nMy Dear Mr. Myers,\u2014You have asked for some of my personal\nrecollections of seances with Mr. Stainton Moses, at which I was present. I\nwill endeavour to place before you a few experiences which may be of\ninterest ; and though very much that I remember would merely be a\nrepetition of Mrs. Stanhope Speer's Records lately published in Light, yet\ncertain things did strike me very strongly at the time, as being valuable tests\nof the genuineness of the manifestations ; and these perhaps might have been\nmore strongly insisted upon in the Records, had they been prepared for the\nperusal of a sceptical, or at any rate an unconvinced, public. The habitual\nreaders of Light having presumably advanced somewhat beyond the\nelementary, but all-important, stage of mere belief in the reality of spirit\nmanifestations, would probably not set so much store upon the simple details\nof tests, uninteresting in themselves, but asked for and given as conclusive\nproofs of the spiritual origin of these same manifestations. It is some of these\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Hoses. 345\noccurrences, taking place under test conditions, that I propose to describe to\nyou. It is important to note that at these seances no less than ten different\nkinds of manifestations took place with more or less frequency. On occasions\nwhen we had fewer varieties we were usually told that the conditions were\nnot good. When they were favourable the manifestations were more\nnumerous, the raps more distinct, the lights brighter, and the musical\nsounds clearer. The various occurrences may be briefly enumerated as\nfollows:\u2014\n1. Great variety of raps, often given simultaneously, and ranging in force\nfrom the tapping of a finger-nail to the tread of a foot sufficiently heavy to\nshake the room. Each spirit always had its own distinctive rap, many of\nthem so peculiar as to be immediately recognised ; and these sounds often\ntook place in sufficient light for the sitters to see each other's features and\u2014I\nsuppose more important\u2014hands. Raps also were frequently heard on the\ndoor, sideboard, and walls, all removed some distance from the table at\nwhich we sat. These raps could not possibly havo been produced by any\nhuman agency ; of that I satisfied myself in every conceivable way.\n2. Raps which answered questions coherently and with the greatest\ndistinctness ; also gave messages, sometimes of considerable length, through\nthe medium of the alphabet. At these times all the raps ceased except the\none identified with the communicating spirit, and perfect quiet prevailed until\nthe message was delivered. We could nearly always tell at once with which\nspirit we were talking, owing to the perfectly distinct individuality of each\ndifferent rap. Some of the higher spirits never\u2014in my time\u2014manifested by\nraps at all, but announced their presence by a note of music, or the flash of a\nlight ; but among those who did manifest in the usual way it would be difficult\nto forget Rector's heavy, ponderous, but muffled tread, which shook the whole\nroom with its weight, while it appeared to move slowly round the circle.\n3. Numerous lights were generally visible to all the sitters. These lights\nwere of two different kinds\u2014objective and subjective ; the former were\nusually like small illuminated globes, which shone brightly and steadily, often\nmoved rapidly about the room, and were visible to all the sitters. A curious\nfact in connection with these lights always struck me, viz., that looking on to\nthe top of the table one could see a light slowly ascending from the floor,\nand to all appearance passing out through the top of the table, the table itself\napparently not affording any obstacle to one's view of the light. It is a little\ndifficult to explain exactly what I mean, but had the top of the table been\ncomposed of plain glass, the effect of the ascending light as it appeared to\none's organs of vision would have been pretty much the same as it was, seen\nthrough the solid mahogany. Even then, to make the parallel complete, it\nwould be necessary to have a hole in the glass top of the table.through which\nthe light could emerge. The subjective lights were described as being large\nmasses of luminous vapour, floating round the room and assuming a variety\nof shapes. However, Dr. Speor and myself being of entirely unmediumistic\ntemperaments, we were only able to see the objective lights, but Mr. Stainton\nMoses, Mrs. Speer, and other occasional sitters frequently saw and described\nthose which were merely subjective. Another curious point in relation to the\nobjective lights was that however brightly they might shine they never\n\u2014unlike an ordinary lamp\u2014threw any radiance around them or illuminated\n\f346 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nthe smallest portion of the surrounding darkness\u2014when it was dark\u2014 in the\nslightest degree.\n4. Scents of various descriptions were always brought to the circle \u2014the\nmost common being musk, verbena, new-mown hay, and one unfamiliar odour\nwhich we were told was called spirit-scent. Sometimes breezes heavy with,\nperfume swept round the circle, at other times quantities of liquid musk, \u00abfcc.,\nwould be poured on the hands of the sitters and, by request, on our\nhandkerchiefs. At the close of a seance scent was often found to be oozing;\nout of the medium's head, and the more it was wiped away, the stronger\nand more plentiful it became.\n5. The musical sounds,which were many and of great variety,formed a very-\nimportant item in the list of phenomena which occurred in our presence.\nHaving myself had a thorough musical education, I was able to estimate, at\nits true value, the importance of these particular manifestations, and was\nnaturally well able to judge of the possibility or impossibility of their\nbeing produced by natural means, or through human agency. These sounds\nmay, roughly speaking, be divided into two classes : those which obviously-\nproceeded from an instrument\u2014a harmonium\u2014in the room, whilst the hands\nof all the sitters were joined round the table ; and those which were pro\nduced in a room iviihout an instrument of any kind whatever therein.\nThese latter were of course the most wonderful. As regards the musical\nsounds produced in the room in which there was no instrument, they were\nabout four in number. First, there were what we called the \" fairy bells.\"\nThese resembled the tones produced by striking musical glasses with a small\nhammer. The notes thus given forth were clear, crisp, and melodious. No.\ndefinite tune was ever played, but the sounds were always harmonious, and,\non being requested by me or any other member of the circle, the \" bells \"\nwould always run up or down a scale, in perfect tune. It was difficult to\njudge where the sound of these \"fairy bells\" came from, but I often\napplied my ear to the top of the table, and the music seemed to be somehow\nin the wood\u2014not underneath it ; as on listening under the table, the music\nwould appear to be above. Next we had quite a different sound\u2014that of a\nstringed instrument more nearly akin to a violoncello than anything else I\nhave ever heard. It was, however, more powerful and sonorous, and might\nperhaps be produced by placing a 'cello on the top of a drum or anything\nelse likely to increase the vibration. This instrument was only heard in\nsingle notes, and was used entirely by one spirit, who employed it usually for\nanswering questions, in the same way that others did by raps. The third\nsound was an exact imitation of an ordinary hand-bell, which would\nbe rung sharply by way of indicating the presence of the particular spirit\nwith whom it was associated. We naturally took care to ascertain that there\nwas no bell of any kind in the room ; even if there had been, it would have\nbeen a matter of some difficulty to have rung it round the walls, and even up\nto the ceiling, as this particular sound proceeded indifferently from all parts\nof the room. Lastly, we had a sound that it is exceedingly difficult to offer\nan adequate description of. The best idea of it I can give is to ask you to\nimagine the soft tone of a clarionet gradually increasing in intensity, until\nit rivalled the sound of a trumpet, then by degrees diminishing to the\noriginal subdued note of the clarionet, until it eventually died away\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 34,7\nin a long-drawn-out melancholy wail. This sound was ascribed to\n\"Odorifer.\"\nThis is a very inefficient description of this really extraordinary sound,\nbut as I have in the whole course of my experience never heard anything\nelse at all like it, it is impossible to give to thoso who have not heard it a\nmore accurate idea of what it was like. Like the two previous sounds I have\ndescribed, it was always associated with one spirit.\nIt is a noteworthy fact that in no case did the controlling agencies pro\nduce more than single notes, or at best isolated passages. This they\naccounted for as owing to the peculiarly unmusical organisation of the\nmedium. At any rate, the production of these sounds was wonderful enough\nin itself, as over and over again I thoroughly satisfied myself that there were\nno materials in the room which could in any way assist in making any kind of\nmusical tones, and the clarionet and trumpet sound was one that I should\nbe utterly at a loss to imitate in any way, whatever materials might be at my\ndisposal. Before I joined the circle several other musical instruments were\nfrequently imitated, and all were heard with greater variety, both of manipula\ntion and tone ; but as I am now only giving you a brief epitome of what\nactually happened under my own observation, I refrain from alluding to\noccurrences which took place when I was not present.\n6. Direct writing was often given, sometimes on a sheet of paper placed\nin the centre of the table and equidistant from all the sitters ; at other\ntimes one of us would place our hands on a piece of paper previously dated\nand initialled, and usually a message was found written upon it at the con\nclusion of the seance. We always placed a pencil upon the paper, but\nsometimes we only provided a small piece of lead, the results being the same\nin both cases. Usually the writing took the form of answering questions\nwhich we had asked, but sometimes short independent communications were\ngiven, also messages of greeting.\n7. Movements of heavy bodies such as tables and chairs were by no\nmeans infrequent. Sometimes the table would be tilted up at a considerable\nangle. At other times the chairs of one or more of the sitters would be pushed\nmore or less forcibly away from the table, until they touched the wall be\nhind\u2014or the table would move away from the sitters on one side and be pro\npelled irresistibly against those on the other, compelling them to move their\nchairs in order to avoid the advance of so heavy a piece of furniture. The\ndining-table in question at which we usually sat was an extremely weighty\none, and was made from solid Honduras mahogany, but at times it was\nmoved with much greater ease than the combined efforts of all the sitters\ncould accomplish\u2014and these combined efforts were powerless to prevent its\nmoving in a certain direction, if the unseen force willed it to do so. We\nfrequently tested the strength of the force by trying to check the onward\nmovements of the table, but without success.\n8. The passage of matter through matter was sometimes strikingly\ndemonstrated by the bringing from other rooms of various articles through\nclosed and bolted doors. Photographs, picture-frames, books, and other\nobjects were frequently so brought, both from rooms on the same floor and\nfrom those above as well. How they came through the closed doors I\n2 A\n\f348 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\ncannot say, except by some process of de-materialisation ; but come they\ncertainly did, apparently none the worse for that process, whatever it might\nhave been.\n9. The direct spirit voice, as opposed to the voice of a spirit speaking\nthrough the medium while in a state of trance, we very seldom heard, and\nnever with any clearness or distinctness. But occasionally it was attempted,\nand by listening carefully wc could distinguish one or two broken sentences\nwhich were hissed out in a sort of husky whisper. These sounds generally\nseemed to be in the air above us, but they were produced with evident\ndifficulty, and there being so many other methods of communication, tho\ndirect voice but seldom was essayed.\n10. The inspirational addresses given by various spirits through Mr. S. M.\nwhen in an entranced condition have been so thoroughly dealt with by Mrs.\nSpcer in her \"Records,\" that I can add nothing as regards the matter\nthus expounded. Touching the manner of these addresses\u2014one or more\nof which we had at almost every seance,-\u2014I can only say that they were\ndelivered in a dignified, temperate, clear, and convincing tone, and that\nthough tho voice proceeded from the medium it was always immediately\napparent that the personality addressing us was not that of the medium.\nThe voice was different, and the ideas were not always in accordance with\nthose held at the time by the medium. An important fact, too, was that,\nalthough many spirits exercised this power of control, the voice which spoke\nwas always different\u2014and in the case of those spirits which controlled\nregularly, we got to know perfectly well which intelligence was communicating\nby the tone of voice and the method of enunciation.\nSo far, in this enumeration of the various phenomena, I have been speak\ning generally of the manifestations which usually occurred at most of our\nsittings ; but, in conclusion, I will give you two particular instances, one of\ndirect writing and one of identity, both of which I think are interesting,\nand which certainly impressed me considerably.\nOn one occasion we were told to cease for a time, and resume the stance\nlater on. I asked the communicating intelligences if they would, during the\ninterval, give me a sample of direct writing under test conditions. An\naffirmative reply having been given, I procured a piece of my own note-\npaper and, unknown to the other members of the circle, I dated and initialled\nit, and put a private mark as well in a corner of the sheet. The others\nhaving retired from the dining-room to the drawing-room, I placed my piece\nof paper with a pencil under a table in the study, and having thoroughly\nsearched the room, I barred the shutters, bolted and locked the door, and\nput the key in my pocket. I leant against the door, or for a change sat on\nthe doormat, until I re-entered the room ;\u2014 when to my great satisfaction I\nfound a message clearly written on the paper. As we had not been sitting in\nthe study, and as I can positively aver that no one entered the room after I\nhad left it until I myself unlocked the door, I have always considered this\nparticular instance of direct spirit writing a most satisfactory and conclusive\ntest.\nThe other occurrence that I consider specially worthy of mention took\nplace as follows :\u2014We were sitting one night as usual, and I had in front of\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 349\nme, with my hand resting upon it, a piece of note-paper with a pencil close\nby. Suddenly the medium\u2014Mr. Stainton Moses,\u2014who was sitting exactly\nopposite me, exclaimed, ' ' There is a very bright column of light behind you.\"\nSoon afterwards he said that the column of light had developed into a spirit-\nform. I asked him if the face was familiar to him, and he replied in the\nnegative, at the same time describing the head and features. When the\nseance was concluded I examined my sheet of paper which my hand had\nnever left, and found written on it a message and signature. The name was\nthat of a distinguished musician who died in the early part of the present\ncentury. I purposely refrain from specifying him, as the use of great names\nvery frequently leads to results quite different from those intended. However,\nnow comes the most extraordinary part of the affair. I asked Mr. Stainton\nMoses\u2014without of course showing him the written message\u2014whether he\nthought he could recognise the spirit he saw behind my chair if he saw a\nportrait of him. He said he thought he could, sol gave him several albums\ncontaining likenesses of friends dead and alive, and also portraits of various\ncelebrities. I remained in another part of the room, and did not watch him,\nnor even knew when he was looking at the right album. On coming to the\nphotograph of the composer in question, he at once said without hesitation,\n\"That is the face of the spirit I saw behind you.\" Then for the first time\nI showed him the message and signature. I regarded the whole incident as\na very fair proof of spirit-identity, and I think that most people would\nconsider the occurrence one of interest.\nI feel that this letter has grown to an unconscionable length, and I must\napologise for the bald manner in which many of the statements made therein\nhave been set forth. I have been considerably pressed for time, and can only\nhope that the manifold crudities of language may, to a certain extent, be\ncompensated for by the fact that the whole is an impartial and unprejudiced\naccount of some of the remarkable phenomena to which I was a witness,\nand the genuineness of which I am ready at any time to vouch for.\n(Signed) Charlton T. Speer.\nNovember 5th, 1893.\nAshley Villa, Ventnor.\nOctober 30th, 1893.\nI wish to state that I am a daughter of Mrs. Stanhope Speer, and was\npresent at many of the seances recorded in Light by my mother, and; further,\nthat the facts therein stated are in my recollection, and are true, and that\nthe phenomena actually took place.\nConstance Rosalie Sfeer.\nI must now leave the reader to judge whether, if these phenomena\nwere fraudulent, the Speer family can be acquitted of complicity in the\nfraud. If we were dealing with a number of known cheats, or of quite\nunknown persons, we should, I think, certainly pronounce the whole\ngroup equally concerned. And here, where the witnesses are all of\nequally good repute, I do not myself feel able to draw any dividing line\nbetween one and another of them.\n2 a 2\n\f350 The Experiences of W. Stainton Moses.\nIt is not, indeed, clear in what way the Speer family could have\nbenefited by such a course of deception. With regard to Mr. Moses\nhimself, there was undoubtedly what might be regarded as a consider\nable, though a mixed, gain. There were some annoyances and anxieties\nwhich his note-books show him to have felt severely, but to which I\nneed not here refer. On the other hand, there was the glory of being\nregarded by the Spiritualist body in England and America as a leader\ngifted with supernormal powers.\nA prospect somewhat of this type has often been enough to tempt\nto fraud. Yet, having seen something of the way in which such\nimpostors deal with their real or manufactured evidence, and of the\nway in which Mr. Moses dealt with his, it has often struck me that his\nmode of producing it was very unlike theirs. It happens that I have\nhad repeated discussions with Mr. Moses as to his method of putting\nhis phenomena before the world, which, as it seemed to me, was\ntoo scrappy and incidental to do them full justice. I had myself\nseen the pile of note-books ; and I urged him to print them at once\nin as full a form as possible. He delayed and demurred, saying that\nthey were too private for publication. I then urged him at least to\nreprint Spirit Identity in an exacter form, and with additional corro\nborations. This he used to promise to do ; and he said that he would\nask me to help in some such task when the time came. But he still\ndelayed ;\u2014delayed until the year before his death. Then he began\nto print Mrs. Speer's notes of seances, and some of his own, in Light ;\nand he prepared a tract called The Identity of Spirit, which I hope to\nprint in a further article, and which gives the gist of Spirit Identity\nin a more exact form. This type-written tract is marked \"Only\npartially revised.\"\nNow, it seems to me that Mr. Moses' conduct throughout was ex\nplicable on the view of him taken by his friends ; namely, that he was\na reserved, sensitive, somewhat proud man, who disliked being discussed\nas a \"medium,\" or baring his inner life to the public, and who wished\nonly to utter just so much of his own experiences as might give him\nthe authority on these subjects which he felt that he had a right to\nclaim.\nIf these note-books had not, in fact, existed ;\u2014if he had had no\nreal testimony to fall back upon ;\u2014reserve would of course have been a\ncheat's natural resource. But since the books do exist, and are full\nof what purports to be evidence, how is it that, if he had elabo\nrately got up all that evidence, he was so reluctant to bring it out ?\nHaving blacked himself all over so thoroughly for his part of Othello,\nwhy was he so coy about removing more than his gloves 1\nIf, then, I attempt to sketch the inner history of these trans\nactions on the hypothesis of fraud, the best scheme that I can offer\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 351\nfor the use of the perspicacious critic will stand somewhat as\nfollows.\n\" Beneath the semblance of probity,\"\u2014let him say\u2014\" the mask of\nsanity, Mr. Moses concealed an unscrupulous love of leadership and\nnotoriety, a morbid passion for mystifying mankind. Unable to gratify\nthis craving in the humdrum life of a parish clergyman, he found in the\ncraze of Spiritualism a congenial field. He must at some time,\u2014possibly\nin his retirement on Mount Athos,\u2014have quietly acquired considerable\nconjuring skill. He was able, for instance, to persuade Serjeant\nCox that he moved a large dining-table and raised it partially from\nthe floor in full daylight, without any apparent contact. His deal\nings with phosphorus also went beyond the ordinary chemical reper\ntory ;\u2014unless, indeed, we credit the ' spirit-lights ' to his more\nscientific confederate. For he seems to have felt from an early period\nthe need of accomplices to assist his contrivances and spread his\nrenown. His thoughts naturally turned 'first to the physician who\nhad just brought him through a dangerous illness,\u2014a gentleman of\ntrained scientific capacity, but whose materialistic views had probably\nblunted his sense of right and wrong, and disposed him to find\namusement in laughing in his sleeve at mankind. On the other\nhand, Mrs. Speer's serious and religious temperament was useful in\nits own way, for she would readily suggest to herself some high\nmoral purpose for the sake of which a lifetime of fraud might\nblamelessly be embraced. Mr. Charlton Speer again, as a pure artist,\nwould care little about bourgeois truth and honour. The next need\nwas a dupe of good character to take notes and to admire. The choice\nof an Oxford graduate secured adequate philosophy and grammar ; while\na position in the Civil Service might be thought likely to have fostered\na spirit of complaisant credulity. What was now needed was wide\nadvertisement ; and the means chosen, if indirect, were none the less\nsubtle. Books out of print are often the most sought after ; nor\nperhaps could a savour of tempting rarity have been better given to\nthe fictitious experiences than by consigning their truncated record to\na moribund magazine. Thus launched on the world, the conspirators\ndivided their parts as their special gifts suggested. Mrs. Speer's line\nwas of course the womanly and the religious. She corresponded with\nMr. Moses on serious and intimate matters, so as to give him the\nopportunity in his replies of alluding to his bogus phenomena as\nthough they formed an ever-present element in his inner life. For this\ncorrespondence,\u2014of which only fragments have as yet seen the light,\u2014\na fraudulent use will doubtless be some day found. Mrs. Speer helped\nalso in Spirit Teachings, and perhaps contributed that semblance of\nhigh moral tone which serves to screen the essential insidiousness of\nthe work as a whole. The task of the scientific husband was delimited\n\f352 The Experiences of TP. Stainton Moses.\nwith an astute reserve. The sum and output of Dr. Speer's twenty\nyears of fraud was to be embedded in a couple of penny note-books,\nwhich he was slyly to keep to himself. He could reckon pretty\nconfidently, indeed, upon their being ultimately revealed with\ntriumphant pedantry by someone whom he had never set eyes on, at\nan indefinite date after his death. Meantime, with the characteristic\nsecretiveness of the impostor, Mr. Moses accumulated in his locked\ndrawers the documents on which his pretensions reposed. The present\nthus amply enjoyed, all that remained was to plan for the development\nof future fame. The gang had naturally maintained intimate friendships\nwith persons of known position and character. It was a stroke of\nconsistencyto bequeath the unpublished manuscripts to gentlemen of this\ntype ; even with the risk that such executors might treat the records\nin a spirit of masterly inaction. Some nincompoop with nothing\nbetter to do was sure to beg for permission to study and arrange the\nprecious stuff ; and some up-to-date Editor of the New Journalism was\nequally certain to jump at the copy for his high-toned print.\"\n\"If you want any more,\" as the adage runs, \"you may sing it\nyourself.\"\nBut the private confidence which prompts a tone of irony when the\nprobity of trusted friends is thus under discussion, will not be, and\nought not to be, communicable in its fulness to other minds. I ask no\nimmunity for Mr. Moses and his group from that jealous scrutiny to\nwhich every claim to supernormal powers should of right be subjected.\nNo one concerned in this story will resent the most searching ques\ntions, the most extreme hypotheses. And, indeed, even for those who\nmay be willing to accept these records as a transcript of actual fact,\nthe period of question, of hypothesis, has yet only just begun. What\nwas there verily, we must go on to demand, behind this bewildering\nmanifestation 1 What power, and with what purpose, was working in\nwhat unknown way 1 Yerane te fades, verus mihi nuntius ad\/era t\nThere must yet be many a pondering of the trustworthiness, the\nsignificance, of this incursion upon the private counsels and sequestered\ncommonwealth of men. And when all is done there will remain a\nmystery which neither our belief shall comprehend nor our incredulity\nunravel.\n\fThe Experiences of W. Stainton Moses. 353\nNOTE.\nIt is expressly stated in each part of these Proceedings that the\nresponsibility for both facts and opinions rests solely with the author of\neach article. Since, however, it seeras possible that the publication of so\ngreat a mass of documents, of very pronounced character, as are already\nincluded, or are to be included, in Air. F. W. H. Myers' papers on the\nExperiences ofMr. Stainton Moses, may be misinterpreted as implying an\nadoption on the part of the Council which authorises their publication,\nof something like the point of viewfrom which Mr. Moses' records were\nwritten, afew words of explanation may here be useful.\nTwo main points are involved in these Records ; (1) the supernormal\ncharacter of the alleged plienomena ; (2) the specific interpretation which\nMr. Moses gives to them. With regard to thefirstpoint, the Council are of\nopinion tlutt, taking into consideration the character of the records of\nwhich a part is here published, the conditions under which the recorded\nphenomena occurred, and the general circumstances of Mr. Moses' life,\nthe supposition that the phenomena are to be explained by deception on\nthe part ofMr. Moses, whether in a normal or an abnormal state, is in\na very high degree improbable ; and that therefore the records constitute an\nimportant part of the evidence which it is the duty of the Society to\ncollect and to put before the world, without necessarily pronouncing a\ndecisive conclusion as to its validity. On the question whether the\nimprobability of deception is greater or less than the improbability that\nthe events actually occurred as recorded the members of the Council\nindividually entertain diverse views, and they do not feel called upon\nto express any opinion collectively.\nWith regard to the second point, the Council would remind the\nreader that where, as in these records, actual observation is obviously,\nand indeed avowedly, mingled with imported theory, the distinction\nbetweenfact and inferencefromfact must be kept in view throughout.\nMuch matter of importance remains to be printed; and afinaljudg\nment can hardly beformed until the whole case shall be under review.\nFrederic W. H. Myers, 1 Hm &M s p R\nFrank Podmore, J\n\f354 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nINDIAN MAGIC AND THE TESTIMONY OF CONJURERS.\nBy Richard Hodgson, LL.D.\nIn the Nohh American Review for January, 1893, appeared an\narticle entitled \"High Caste Indian Magic,\" over the name of the\nwell-known professor of conjuring, Mr. Harry Kellar. In this article\nMr. Kellar gives an account of various marvels which he declares that\nhe personally witnessed in India, and he states that \" the high caste\nfakirs, or magicians, of Northern India have probably discovered natural\nlaws of which we in the West are ignorant. That they succeed in over\ncoming forces of nature which to us seem insurmountable, my obser\nvation satisfies me beyond doubt.\" This dictum raises an interesting\ngeneral question as to the value of conjurers' descriptions of perform\nances of the kind described,\u2014besides the question as to the value of\nMr. Kellar's testimony in particular. I propose to deal briefly with\nthese two questions. The previous publications on this subject by Mr.\nKellar that have fallen under my notice are three short articles which\nappeared in Leisure Hours for March, April, and May, 1892, and a\nbook published in 1886, entitled : A Magician's Tour Up and Down\nand Round About the Earth, being the Life and Adventures of the\nAmerican Nostradamus, Harry Kellar. Edited by his faithful\n\" Familiar,\" \" Satan Junior.\" According to this book, which I shall\nspeak of as Mr. Kellar's, his first visit to the \"far East\" was in the\nyear 1877. About July 4th, 1876, Mr. Kellar \"decided to visit\nAustralia and the far East.\" In 1876 and 1877 we find him in\nAustralia, which he left in 1877. Singapore, Johore, Java, Shanghai,\nHong Kong, Rangoon, and various other places were visited, and Mr.\nKellar finally opened in Calcutta on December 30th, 1877. The\nplaces visited in order are given,\u2014Calcutta, Allahabad, Lucknow,\nDelhi. Mr. Kellar is also said to have visited Agra, Cawnpore,\nJeypore, and Benares, and \" all the prominent towns of the Punjab.\"\nHe opened in Bombay on February 14th, 1878, and from Bombay\nmoved northward to Bagdad. He did not return to India till 1882.\nHow happens it, then, that Mr. Kellar describes an experience\nwhich he had at Secunderabad in 1878,\u2014when there is no mention\nwhatever in his book of any visit to Secunderabad? And Secun\nderabad was a very long way off from any of the places mentioned as\nhaving been visited by Mr. Kellar, and in a totally different direction.\nA visit to Secunderabad would have required several days at least.\nNot only so, but Mr. Kellar describes a scene which he says he\n\fIndian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers. 355\nwitnessed \"at the palace of Sir Salar Jung, the Nizam of Secun\nderabad.\" Now, there is no Nizam of Secunderabad. There is a-\nNizam of Hyderabad, and Nawab Sir Salar Jung Bahadur was\nMinister of Hyderabad. Secunderabad is a city in the Nizam's\ndominions. In his book Mr. Kellar is described as having appeared\nin Calcutta before the Nizam of Secunderaliad and also Sir Salar Jung,\nPrime Minister of the Nizam. It is, of course, not surprising that\nMr. Kellar should make a mistake about the titles of these\n\" notables,\" unless he actually visited the Nizam's dominions. The\nsurprising thing is, if he visited Secunderabad in 1878, as he now\nstates, and witnessed what he regarded as a remarkable incident\nthere, that no mention of such a visit should appear in his book.\nAnd such a visit would have been a complete deviation from the line\nof his route as described in his book. He has possibly confused\nSecunderabad and Hyderabad with Allahabad.\nIt appears clearly from Mr. Kellar's book that two or three years\nof scattered, hasty travel would cover his experience of \" India and the\nfar East.\" Yet he begins his article by the following passage :\u2014\n\" Fifteen years spent in India and the far East have convinced me that the\nhigh caste fakirs, or magicians, of Northern India have probably discovered\nnatural laws of which we in the West are ignorant.\"\nAt the very outset, then, Mr. Kellar claims a familiarity with\n\" India and the far East \" which he does not possess. But this is by\nno means the most serious fault that we have to find with Mr. Kellar's\nstatements. It appears, from the account in his book, that it was not\ntill 1877 that he visited India, and that during the winter of 1875-6\nhe was journeying backwards and forwards between England and\nAmerica, and giving performances in the latter country. How, then,\nat this time could he be also in Calcutta? He says in his recent\narticle :\u2014\n\" On the occasion of the visit of the Prince of Wales to Calcutta during\nthe winter of 1875-6, I saw a marvel of levitation performed in the presenco\nof the Prince and of some fifty thousand spectators.\"\nThe Prince of Wales was in Calcutta during the winter of 1875-6,\nbut if Mr. Kellar declares that he also was there at that time, as he\ndoes\u2014well, we have a conjurer's testimony to a very remarkable\nperformance, more marvellous than the feat of levitation which he\ndescribes himself as having witnessed at the Maidam. The reader may,\nhowever, be willing to pass over discrepancies of this kind, and to\nassume that although Mr. Kellar's memory of dates and persons is not\nvery good, he may nevertheless have witnessed some such scene as he\ndescribes, in a different year, and when the Prince of Wales was not\npresent. Let us, therefore, take another incident from the recent\narticle for the purpose of seeing how much confidence we can place in\n\f356 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nMr. Kellar's descriptions of a conjuring trick which he fails to\nunderstand. He says : \u2014\n' ' I saw a performance by the whirling fakirs in the Chandee Choke, the\nCheapside of Calcutta. There were a score of Englishmen in the party,\nwhich had gathered by arrangement, and we were escorted to a long empty\nroom in the Chandee Choke, which was apparently an unoccupied store-room.\nThere was no back door, and the only two windows in the room\u2014which\nwere at either side of the entrance\u2014looked on the street. There was no one\npresent when we arrived, and we examined the room carefully, testing the\nwalls, ceiling and floor for secret doors, traps, wires, &c., and came to the\nconclusion that in those respects, at least, all was as it should be. We then\ndrew a chalk line one-third of the way down the room from the door, beyond\nwhich we were to remain as audience, while four fakirs, who appeared at\nthat moment from the street, were to give us an exhibition of their magical\npowers in the other two-thirds of the apartment, which was destitute of\neither doors or windows, and, so far as we could inform ourselves, absolutely\nwithout means of communication with the adjoining buildings or with the\nopen air.\n\" The old fakir took a chafing-dish and set it about ten feet from the chalk\nline on his side, casting upon its glowing coals a white powder, which gave\nout a strong scent of tuberoses, very agreeable to the senses. A fine white\nvapour aroso from the burning powder and filled the corners of the ceiling,\ndraping the dull panelling with a flying wreath or two, but still permitting\na clear view of the end wall. At a point some six or eight feet beyond the\nchafing-dish the old man and his three assistants began dancing slowly ; they\ngave utterance to no sound, but whirled faster and faster, with a rhythmic\nmotion, their robes flowing out on either side and blending the four forms\ninto a composite group, of which the tall master was the central figure.\nSuddenly, to our great astonishment, we became aware that there was only\none form visible, that of the old man. The swift whirl of his dance was\ngradually relaxed, and in a minute or two he became motionless, salaamed,\nadvanced in front of the chafing-dish, bowed again, and pointed with a\ndignified gesture to the rear of the apartment. We all looked eagerly in the\ndirection of his gesture ; there was not a living creature, nor indeed an\nobject of any kind, visible beyond the line except himself. With another\nsalaam he returned to his original position in the rear of the chafing-dish,\nand began with reverse motion the dance of a moment before. Holding out\nhis arms on each side of him as if the better to balance himself, he now sang,\nin a low, monotonous tone, a chant, the words of which impressed themselves\nupon my memory and sounded like this :\u2014\nAl YA OR EKTO DO !\n\" In some inexplicable way the monotonous drone of this chant, which\nfell not unmusically from his lips, seemed to join with the vapours which\ncurled about the scene to bewitch our fancies, or at all events to produce a\ncondition of dreamy delight. If this was hypnotism, so be it ; but\nwhether or not the existence of this charmed condition can be ascribed to\nhypnotic influences, I never felt my senses more completely at my command ;\nand with my eyes fixed intently upon his whirling figure I became aware\nthat he seemed to be throwing off from himself portions of his body ; one\n\fIndian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers. 357\narm here, the other there, a leg here, and so on, the illusion being perfect,\nif illusion it was, and the end of the room where he had begun to dance\nalone becoming gradually filled with figures like his own, only younger, each\nwhirling with the same chant in the same direction. Suddenly the dance\nagain died away, the chant was hushed, and when we looked again there was\nbut one performer visible, the old fakir, who advanced in front of the\nchafing-dish and asked for backsheesh. He received it liberally, and we again\nmade an examination of the room, but could discover no explanation of the\ndisappearance of his companions.\"\nNow, it certainly looks as if Mr. Kellar was trying here to describe\nan incident which appears as follows in an article by him in Leisure\nSours for March, 1892, where he writes :\u2014\n\"At Calcutta I attended a performance of three fakirs, which was given in\na large room. At one end, where they had drawn a dividing line, none of\nthe spectators were allowed. The three fakirs began dancing and whisking\naround like dervishes, with a dizzy rapidity. This continued for a few\nmoments, when I suddenly discovered that there were four dancers instead\nof three. Then the number increased still further until there were a dozen\nmen dancing, twisting and gyrating. Then, seemingly, the dancers came\nnearer together, until they appeared to be all massed in one big dancer, who\nfinally ceased whirling and stood there alone. As I have just explained, the\nspectators were not allowed to examine that end of the room where the\nfakirs performed their feat, so I could not make any personal inspection of\nthe walls. It did not seem possible, however, from where I sat, that there\ncould have been any reflection from the sides or rear ; but I was evidently\ndeceived by some clever optical delusion.\"\nA comparison of these accounts will probably be interesting to the\nreader, whether he concludes that they refer to the same incident or\nnot, and there is other evidence to show that the feats witnessed by Mr.\nKellar in India have grown largely in his imagination with the lapse\nof time. Compare the statements in his recent article with the\nfollowing passage from Leisure Hours, March, 1892 :\u2014\n\" Some of the purely Oriental wonders were unique and unaccountable\u2014\nnotably the levitation of a human being in mid-air without any visible means\nof support, and apparently defying the laws of gravity ; the cutting of a\nman to pieces and building him up again as good as ever ; the changing of a\nrupee held in the hand of a spectator into a writhing, lively cobra ; wonder\nful feats of hypnotism or simulation of death ; the making of birds and\nanimals of common clay and subsequently imbuing them with life, so that they\nappeared real ; the production of the deadlycobra from most impossible places;\nthe whirling dervishes, changing from one to many and then back to one\nagain ; causing iron to float in water, and a ball to spin around the head without\nany apparent attachment to the body. These and many other wonders belong\nexclusively to the crafty Hindu, and have never yet been explained by\nEuropeans. They are simply tricks, but very clever and ingenious, and the\nsecrets are carefully guarded.\"\nAnd compare this again with his statements in 1886. On turning\n\f358 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nto the book from which I have already quoted, I find a chapter (XVI.}\nentitled \" The Jugglers of India.\" The first paragraph reads as\nfollows :\u2014\n\" Naturally, on his first visit to India, Kellar was curious to see something\nof the famous jugglers, of whom travellers have told such marvellous tales.\nHe went out of his way to meet any famous performer who could only be\nreached in that manner, and the result was that between the time he landed\nat Calcutta and the time he embarked at Bombay, ho had witnessed about\neverything of note in the juggling line that the country afforded. The\nopinion he formed, after seeing all they could show him, was that, apart\nfrom their skill as snake charmers, in the basket trick, and one or two other\nillusions, the ability of the entire fraternity of Indian jugglers is beneath\ncontempt.\"\nHe then describes the mango trick, a snake charming trick, the\nbasket trick, the bowl of water trick, the coloured sugars trick, and the\ndry sand trick. The last sentence of the chapter reads :\u2014\" The tricks\nalready described are the only ones Kellar saw in India which are\nworth mentioning.\"\nHow comes it, then, that if this was Mr. Kellar's opinion in 1886,\nhe should give descriptions in his recent article of incidents which he\nstates he witnessed in India prior to that time, incidents which he now\nsays \"baffled my deepest scrutiny, and remained the inexplicable\nsubject of my lasting wonder and admiration \" 1 Surely Mr. Kellar\nis romancing ! Against the Kellar of 1893 we may quote the Kellar\nof 1886 :\u2014\n\"Many of the wonders attributed to Oriental jugglers have never existed\nanywhere outside of the imaginations of those who tell them. The writers\nwho declare that they have seen such impossible feats performed as\nthrowing a ball of twine in the air to form a sort of Jack-and-the-bean-stalk,\nup which the juggler climbed out of sight, pulling the string after him, and\nthat the pistol shot of a companion brought the aerial climber to the\nearth in fragments, which, when brought together, became a living,\nuninjured man again, must have had their brains steeped in hasheesh.\"\nLet us now turn to what Mr. Kellar has to say about the notorious\nmedium Eglinton :\u2014\n\"My first experience with the phenomenon of levitation was in January,\n1882, during the course of an engagement I was filling at the Chowringhee\nTheatre Royal in Calcutta. Mr. Eglinton, a professed spiritual medium,\nwas giving se'ances in Calcutta at the time, and as I opeidy avowed my\nability to expose the frauds of all so-called mediums, I was taken to one of\nthem, which occurred in a brilliantly lighted apartment. I will not describe\nit otherwise than to say that it so puzzled and interested me that I gladly\naccepted the invitation an evening or two afterwards to be present with\nseveral others at a dark seance given by Mr. Eglinton.\n\" It was now that the feat of levitation was apparently performed, in the\npresenco of these spectators. The only furniture in the room was a plain\n\fIndian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers. 359\nteakwood table, a zither, some chairs, two musical boxes, and a scroll of\npaper. A circle having been formed, I was placed on Mr. Eglinton's left\nand seized his left hand firmly in my right. Immediately on the extinction\nof the lights, I felt him rise slowly in the air, and as I retained firm hold of\nhis hand, I was pulled to my feet, and subsequently compelled to jump on a\nchair and then on the table, in order to retain my hold of him. That his\nbody did ascend into the air on that occasion with an apparently utter\ndisregard of the law of gravity, there can be no doubt. The musical boxes,\nplaying briskly, then appeared to float through the air above our heads,\nsmall green lights appearing and disappearing here and there without\nvisible cause, and the zither playing near the ceiling or immediately over\nour heads. . . . What most excited my wonder was the fact, for I may\nspeak of it as a fact without qualification, that when Mr. Eglinton rose from\nmy side, and, by the hold he had on my right hand, pulled me up after him,\nmy own body appeared for the time being to have been rendered non-\nsusceptible to gravity.\"\nHow, if Mr. Kellar weighed nothing, he should have been compelled\nto jump, it is somewhat difficult to understand. A more detailed\naccount of these incidents is given in Mr. Kellar's book, pp. 167-173,\nwhere we find :\u2014\n\"He sought for means to reproduce, by natural means, all that Mr.\nEglinton had done, except the levitation. He succeeded after much study\nand many experiments. Of course he makes no claim to performing the\ntricks by the same means that Mr. Eglinton used. It may be that he uses\nthe same method, and it may be otherwise. He simply knows that he pro\nduces the same results. . . . Regarding the levitation feat, my master\nhas never been able to reach a satisfactory explanation. What puzzles him\nmost is how he could have been pulled up by Mr. Eglinton without feeling\nhis own weight on his hand and arm. He seemed to lose gravity. Whether\nthe occurrence was actual, and not a mere mental illusion, he is not prepared\nto say. It assuredly was a wonderful and unaccountable performance.\"\nThe reader will notice that the alleged levitation occurred in the\ndarkness, and will probably infer that Eglinton used the same means\nof rising as Mr. Kellar afterwards did, viz., the chair and the table.\nThis was my own conclusion concerning the alleged levitation of\nEglinton at a dark seance given in a room of a friend of my own at St.\nJohn's College, Cambridge, England, in the year 1880. Friends of\nmine were holding Eglinton at the time, and I was present at the\nsitting myself. It was unanimously agreed, I believe, by all who were\npresent, that there was no evidence whatever to show that Eglinton\nrose by other than ordinary means. Eglinton, moreover, is a detected\ntrickster. At one of his so-called \" materialisation \" seances, pieces of\nmuslin and beard were cut from the supposed \" spirit,\" and these\nfitted the muslin and beard afterwards found in Eglinton's port\nmanteau. He also co-operated with Madame Blavatsky in the\nproduction of a spurious marvel, was detected in fraud at Munich, and\n\f360 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nwas discovered surreptitiously writing at one of his so-called \" inde\npendent slate-writing\" seances. (Proceedings of the Societyfor Psychical\nResearch, Vol. IV., pp. 350-2.) Mr. Kellar's first experience with\nEglinton in 1882 was in \"independent slate-writing,\" and he was\ncompletely deceived. He afterwards, apparently, changed his opinion,\nand concluded that he could account for what happened \" by natural\nmeans.\" As a student of accounts of this class of alleged phenomena,\nit is obvious to me, from Mr. Kellar's description given in his book,\nthat he was ignorant at the time of his first experience with Eglinton\nof some of the common methods of producing alleged \" independent\nslate-writing \" by trickery. Later on Mr. Kellar publicly professed to\nbe able to \" duplicate any performance given by mediums, of whatever\nnature, after he has seen it done three times.\" This suggests that Mr.\nKellar's real opinion about Eglinton's performances is that they were\nall tricks, and I am not aware that Mr. Kellar has withdrawn the\nchallenge thus given to mediums.\nI have said enough to show that Mr. Kellar's article is written\nfrom the point of view of the romantic story-teller who allows his\nimagination full play, rather than from that of a careful recorder of\nthe circumstances of a trick-performance, and some of his fundamental\nstatements as to times, places, and his own conclusions are flatly\nnegatived by the statements in his previously published book.\nWe may now ask how much importance is to be attributed to a\nconjurer's testimony concerning marvellous performances of the kind\nunder review. It is, of course, not to be doubted that a conjurer, or a\nperson familiar with the devices of conjurers, is more likely to discover\nthe modus operandi of a trick than the ordinary uninitiated\nobserver,\u2014and even if he fails to discover the trick, he may by virtue\nof his knowledge of various trick-devices, write a better record than\nanother person who is not superior to him in other respects. It does\nnot, however, follow from this that his description of a trick which\nhas baffled him will be specially reliable. The conjurer may not be a\nparticularly keen observer of circumstances not already familiar to\nhim as belonging to the conjuring class ; his memory may be untrained\nin the reproduction of circumstances which he did observe at the time;\nand he may be entirely unaccustomed to the making of precise records\nof such a series of events. A conjurer does not seem to have any\nspecial capacity qud conjurer in these directions. And a tendency\nwhich besets the ordinary observer is likely to operate still more\npowerfully with an expert in prestidigitation. The very fact of his\nhaving been deceived will in many cases contribute towards the\nmarvellousness of his record, especially if he is over-confident of his\nability to detect trickery. For a similar reason, he is more apt to\nsuppose that the phenomenon, if unintelligible to him, was inexplic\n\fIndian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers. 361\nable \" by natural means.\" Mr. Kellar seems to have taken this\nconfiding attitude when he witnessed Eglinton's performances in\n1882. I was much struck myself when in India by the complete\nmystification produced in some Hindu jugglers by several tricks of a\nEuropean gentleman who was an amateur conjurer. At the time I\nwas not familiar with conjuring methods, but reasoned out the modus\noperandi in these particular tricks which caused the amazement of the\nnative experts because they were unfamiliar with that class of perform\nance. Not only do I see no sufficient ground for supposing a priori that\na conjurer will make specially accurate records of a trick which he has\nfailed to understand, but a comparison of several records made by\nconjurers of \" independent slate-writing performances \" with those of\nother intelligent non-conjuring observers, all of the witnesses being\nalike ignorant of the modus operandi, affords a posteriori proof that\nconjurers are not specially competent recorders. Mr. Kellar's descrip\ntion of his slate-writing sitting with Eglinton is an instance. It.\nmay be laid down as a rule almost without exception that the account\nof a trick by a person ignorant of the method used in its production\nwill involve a misdescription of its fundamental conditions. And this\nmisdescription is frequently so marked that no clue is afforded to\nthe student for the actual explanation. These statements apply not to\nthe ordinary observer alone, but also to the baffled conjurer, whose\ntestimony is vitiated by the same liability to mal-observation and lapse\nof memory so fruitful in the reports by ordinary observers of \"occult\"\nphenomena.\nIf, then, a conjurer says that he was unable to discover any trick in\nan alleged \"occult\" phenomenon, his statement to that effect is entitled\nto more value than that of a person unfamiliar with conjuring. There\nis something about that phenomenon which is probably exceptional.\nIt may, however, be a form of trick which is simply unlike any of those\nalready familiar to the conjurer. Eglinton's slate-writing trick, for\nexample, deceived Mr. Kellar in 1882. It would not, however, I believe,\ndeceive him now. But supposing that the conjurer fails to discover a\ntrick, what is the value of his opinion that no trick was possible? This\ndepends entirely upon the individual man, and not upon his conjuring\nknowledge. We must consider his general capacity, his ability to\nobserve and recollect the detailed circumstances of the performance,\nhis knowledge of the sciences, mental as well as physical, his tendency\nto believe in supernormal phenomena without sufficient evidence.* If\nhe is too confident in his own powers, he will be likely to assume that\n* I have asked many-persons for an explanation of one of Mr. Davey's tricks\u2014\nwriting between slates screwed and tied together\u2014and only one person, Professor S.\nP. Langley, solved the problem. Among those who failed were two conjurers, one of\nthem being Mr. Kellar.\n\f362 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nthe performance was not a trick merely because he was unable to dis\ncover the trick. Now, with all due respect to Mr. Kellar's power as a\nconjurer\u2014and he stands high in some branches of his profession\u2014I do\nnot regard his opinion as entitled to much weight beyond those special\nmatters with which he is familiar. And I think that my statement\nis sufficiently vindicated by Mr. Kellar's assurance in the first place\nthat he could easily expose the frauds of \" spiritistic mediums,\" and\nthen his apparent readiness to jump at the conclusion that Eglinton's\nperformance at the slate-writing seance \"was in no way the result\nof trickery or sleight-of-hand.\" When we come to consider the narra\ntions which Mr. Kellar now gives of his experiences, putting aside the\ndiscrepancies of dates, &c., which I have pointed out\u2014and which\nseem to indicate that Mr. Kellar is entitled to less confidence as a\nnarrator than is the ordinary historian\u2014it is plain that he is com\npletely unaware of the ravages which time makes in one's recollections.\nWhat should we think of an astronomer who proposed, several years\nafter the evont, to draw from memory accurate charts of the sun's\nflames during a total eclipse? What would Mr. Kellar think of a\nwitness to his own performances who, being, let us say, unable to\ndivine Mr. Kellar's methods, should attempt years afterwards to narrate\nwhat he witnessed 1 Some of Mr. Kellar's operations, which were\nperhaps actually seen at the time, but their significance not understood,\nhave been transposed in their order or have dropped out of memory.\nPossibly other events have taken their place in recollection\u2014and Mr.\nKellar would find it absolutely impossible to reproduce his performance\nunder the conditions as these are erroneously remembered by the\nwitness. Most persons appear to think that their memory of a series\nof events, if clear and vivid, is necessarily trustworthy. They regard\ntheir recollection as a photograph, the lines of which may indeed\nbecome blurred, and fade out, but do not change their distinctive posi\ntions. This view of recollection, as regards the events which we are\n,considering, is totally erroneous. To continue our analogy, the\nmemory photograph may change in many of its really most important\nelements, and yet be a clear and vivid photograph. The memory-\nfaculty is not adequate for the reproduction of the details of the events\nin question as they occurred. And I have no doubt that Mr. Kellar's\ndescriptions of the incidents which he was unable to explain are just as\nfaulty as the descriptions of his own performances would be if given\nyears afterwards by a witness who was unfamiliar with Mr. Kellar's\nmethods.\nI may add here a few words about my own conclusions concerning\nHindu jugglers, without claiming even so much experience in India\nas was actually enjoyed by Mr. Kellar. All that I saw was conjuring,\nand every detail, I believe, became known to me, either by purchase or\n\fIndian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers. 363\nby discovery. I did not, however, see some of the performances which\nMr. Kellar describes. Possibly I saw only what he designates as the\nlow caste fakirs, and not any of the high caste fakirs. I venture to\nsuggest about these that the high caste fakirs, if such exist, may bear\nsomewhat of the same relation to the low caste fakirs as the high\nclass professionals here, such as Kellar and Hermann, bear to the\nperformers in dime museums. In the next place I would remind the\nreader that the Hindu race has differentiated very widely in many\nrespects from the Western branches of the Aryan stock,\u2014and it\nwould not be an extreme hypothesis to suppose that certain modes of\ndeception have been developed by them on lines which are unfamiliar\nto the Western races. This differentiation is shown in other directions,\nfrom philosophical speculations down to trick puzzles in cane and wire.\nThey may, indeed, have discovered some \" laws \" of which we in the\nWest are at present ignorant. I certainly do not affirm that this\nis impossible, though in the course of my investigations in India\nconcerning the marvellous phenomena alleged to have occurred in con\nnection with Madame Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society I\ncould find no evidence for the existence of anything but ordinary\ntrickery. The performances of all the \" jugglers \" whom I saw were\nunquestionably conjuring tricks, and I sought in vain for an eye\nwitness, European or native, of the famous rope exploit of which we\nhave heard so much in travellers' tales. About three years ago a story\nspread that this supposed trick was explicable by \"hypnotism.\" It\nwas alleged that certain travellers had proved this by means of a\nkodak. The kodak showed no such scenes,\u2014rope taut as though fixed\nto an inevitable point in the air, disappearing boy, man following with\na knife,\u2014bloody limbs and trunk and head falling,\u2014reintegration of\nthe boy's organism, &c. This story turned out, by the confession of its\nauthor, to be a \"yarn,\" as was obvious to myself when it first\nappeared,\u2014not only from the indications of the drawings given with\nthe story, but because the famous \" mango \" or tree-growing trick was\nexplained in the same way\u2014viz., by hypnotic suggestion ; whereas I\nwas well aware that the latter was a simple conjuring trick, every\ndetail of which was known to me. Even Colonel Olcott, faithful\nfollower of Madame Blavatsky, and recipient of so many favours from\nthe (imaginary) adepts or Mahatmas, told me, after several years'\nresidence in India, that he had never witnessed the rope-climbing\nperformance. It was he who made the statement to me, on what\nauthority I do not remember, that the explanation was \" hypnotic\nsuggestion,\" and he related in connection with his opinion the story of\na native who was looking on at this performance from a little distance\noff, up a tree, whence he had a good view but could not distinguish\nthe conjurer's words. He saw the conjurer do nothing more mysterious\n2 B\n\f364 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nthan to cut up a large vegetable of the pumpkin order, and fit the\nfragments together, whereas the spectators close at hand averred that\nthey had witnessed the various stages of the \" rope-climbing \" trick.\nSo runs the story. Now, it is, of course, perfectly easy to induce in a,\nhypnotic subject the belief that he is witnessing or has witnessed a.\nperformance like that under consideration, but I do not know of any\nexperiments that in the least degree indicate the feasibility of\nhypnotising a whole group of persons without their knowledge. It is,\nnevertheless, possible that the original story of this famous trick,\nas well as several later versions, may have been due to hypnotic-\nsuggestion. Colonel Henry Yule, in his notes to The book of Ser\nMarco Polo, has given various references to the accounts of this\nperformance,\u2014by Ibn Batuta, the Moor, in the fourteenth century ;\nby Edward Melton, an Anglo-Dutch traveller, in the seventeenth cen\ntury ; by Francis Valentyn (whose account Colonel Yule apparently\nthinks is borrowed from Melton's) ; and by the Emperor Jahangueir,\nin the seventeenth century.\nAfter describing the trick, Ibn Batuta writes :\u2014\n\" All this astonished me beyond measure, and I had an attack of\npalpitation like that which overcame me once before in the presence of the\nSultan of India, when he showed me something of the same kind. They gave-\nme a cordial, however, which cured the attack. The Kazi Afkharuddin was\nnext to me, and quoth he, ' Wallah ! 'tis my opinion there has been-\nneither going up nor coming down, neither marring nor mending ; 'tis all\nhocus pocus ! ' \"\nOn referring to this previous incident mentioned by Ibn Batuta, I\nfind that it was a case of apparent levitation, where one of several\njugglers rose in the air and took a sitting posture in the air above the\nhead of the witness. Ibn Batuta states that he was alarmed, and\nfinally lost consciousness, that he was restored to consciousness, and\nthat he still saw the juggler in the air above him, and that the juggler\nshortly after resumed his normal position. These two accounts by\nIbn Batuta certainly seem to indicate that his experience was due to\nhypnotic suggestion. Experts in practical hypnotism are well aware\nthat there is a light stage of the hypnotic trance where the subject is\nsusceptible to illusive suggestions, but from which he frequently lapses\ninto a deeper stage, that of coma, if not kept active, so to speak, by\ncontinual inquiries or suggestions. It is not at all unlikely that Ibn\nBatuta's loss of consciousness in his first experience was an instance of\nthis tendency to lapse into the deeper state of hypnotic trance. The\nremark of the Kazi Afkharuddin which he quotes in the account of his\nlater experience appears to indicate that this person, at all events, was\nnot a good hypnotic subject. His official position perhaps warranted\nhim in speaking out an opinion of the performance which might indeed\n\fIndian Magic and the Testimony of Conjurers. 365\nhave been shared by many others who dared not venture to criticise\nthe conjurer. My readers will doubtless remember the old fairy tale of\nthe Emperor of China's magic robes and the little child. Afkharuddin\napparently witnessed nothing at all extraordinary, and asserted this in\nsuch plain and impressive language that Ibn Batuta recorded the fact.\nI do not claim an extensive knowledge of accounts of this rope per\nformance, but I have not yet met with any authentic records by joint\nwitnesses of its occurrence, and possibly the tale of it depends upon a\nfew accounts by isolated travellers who were more or less susceptible\nto hypnotic suggestion, and who were not all so fortunate as Ibn\nBatuta in finding that not every person present was affected as he\nwas.\nThe Emperor Jahangueir describes a series of remarkable tricks,\nperformed by seven Bengal jugglers. He enumerates twenty-eight in\ndetail. The reader will rightly infer that his account is full of mis\ndescriptions of various kinds. These will probably be extraordinary\nin the case before us, since the Emperor Jahangueir must be regarded\nas liable not only to the ordinary forms of mal-observation and lapse\nof memory, but also to further deficiencies due to the age in which he\nlived,\u2014which may be briefly characterised as comparatively ignorant\nand superstitious. For explanation of some of the incidents mis-\ndescribed there are obvious clues for persons familiar with modern\nconjuring operations. Other incidents may be explained if we suppose\nthat acquisitions which we regard as recently achieved were known to\nthe Bengalese operators,\u2014but in all these cases we must amend the\naccounts of Jahangueir by supplying additional details. Other\nincidents remain apparently inexplicable, as appears to me (perhaps\nnot to others who may know more than myself about these matters), if\nwe regard Jahangueir's descriptions as correct. And this is just the\nvery point that I wish to emphasise more than any other. His\ndescriptions must be regarded as largely erroneous. Take the descrip\ntions by uninitiated witnesses\u2014I have heard them frequently\u2014of\nMr. Kellar's flower-growing trick, or the wine and water trick, or the\nPsycho. They are absurdly inaccurate from the nature of the case,\ninasmuch as the witnesses failed to see through the tricks. In the\nsame category I place Mr. Kellar's descriptions of the Hindu tricks\n(those which he actually saw) which he failed to understand.\nI conclude, therefore, that, in spite of the strong assertions of a\ndistinguished conjurer, we have before us no real evidence to the\nmanifestation by Indian jugglers or fakirs of any marvels beyond the\npower of trickery to produce. Such a conclusion, if correct, is of\nimportance to our general inquiries, which can only make progress by\na constant sifting of all kinds of testimony, a constant delimitation\nof false from true in accordance with canons which ought to be made\n2 b 2\n\f3G6 Mr. Richard Hodgson.\nmore exact and effective by every fresh application. And I add one\nword of moral,\u2014a caution, namely, against accepting too readily the\nuncorroborated dicta of eminent men, whatever their source, and\nwhatever their tendency. The conjurer's mere assertion that certain\nmarvels are not explicable by trickery is worth just as much as the\nsavant's mere assertion that they must be so explicable,\u2014just as much,\nand no more.\nThere is no royal road to sound opinions on such matters generally ;\nthere is nothing for it save to examine each narrative on its own merits,\nand with close individual care ; the mind meanwhile prepared for either\nfate,\u2014whether to prick some bubble of pretension into empty falsity,\nor to discover beneath some unpromising envelope a germ of inex\nplicable truth.\n\fSupplement ] 3G7\nReview.\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEW.\n1. The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies. A Study in Folk-\nLore and Psychical Research. The Text by Robert Kirk, M.A.,\nMinister of Aberfoyle, A.D. 1091. The Comment by Andrew Lang,\nM.A., A.D. 1893. London : David Nittt.\n2. Comparative Psychical Research. By Andrew Lang. Contemporary Review,\nSeptember, 1893.\nMr. Robert Kirk was \"a man of good family, a student, and, as his\nbook shows, an innocent and learned person.\" He wrote of Elves and\nFairies, with full belief in their existence, and minute knowledge as to their\nhabits and qualities, mental and bodily, if we may use the word body of these\n\" vehicles so spungious, thin, and defecat.\" His style occasionally reminds\nus of Sir Thomas Browne. Sir Thomas himself might have said of the\nshooters of the fairy arrow-heads : \"They are not as infallible Benjamites,\nhitting at a Hair's breadth ; nor are they wholly unvanquishable, at least in\nAppearance.\" The book is of curious interest, and we are grateful to Mr.\nLang and Mr. Nutt for making a rare work accessible in so pleasant a form\nas that which clothes the Bibliotheqiie de Carabas.\nMr. Lang prefixes a long and interesting introduction, in which he dis\ncusses, with the wealth of illustration which he has at his command, the\npsychical problems suggested by the book. This introduction, and also his\narticle on Comparative Psychical Research, have a direct bearing on the work\nof the Society for Psychical Research. Both will be read with great interest\nby members of the Society ; and some discussion of the moral which they\nconvey may not be out of place in the Society's Proceedings.\nThe main theme of the two essays is that the historical branch of\nPsychical Research has been neglected. Mr. Lang points out that in legends\nand popular beliefs, in stories of witches, fairies, hauntings, magic, and so\nforth, among peoples of all degrees of civilisation, there is a great deal\nwhich finds a close parallel in the records of spiritualism, hypnotism,\ntelepathy, and other modern forms of supernormal phenomena. He argues\nthat, the results being similar, the causes are probably similar also. There\nmay be a \" residuum of fact\" behind the phenomena ; or there may be only\ncertain world-wide tendencies inherent in the human mind, which make men\nof very different races and periods believe and invent similar fictions\u2014just na\nspiders have an instinct which makes them spin similar webs. In any case,\nhe urges, the comparative method applied to Psychical Research should help\n\f3G8 {Supplement.\nRevieiv.\nto discover the residuum of fact if there be one ; and, whether fact be\ndiscovered or not, it should serve to elucidate a most remarkable province of\npsychology.\nThis branch of inquiry has not been so completely neglected as Mr.\nLang supposes. \"As far as the writer has read the Society's Proceedings,\"\nhe writes, \"it 'takes no keep,' as Malory says, of these affairs in their\nhistorical aspect \" ;\u2014and again\u2014\"The Psychical Society, as far as the writer\nis aware, has not examined officially tho old accounts of the phenomena\nwhich it investigates at present.\" He may be excused, perhaps, for not being\nfamiliar with the 1,300 pages of Phantasms of the Living ; but he will find at\np. 172 of the first volume of that work a most interesting and masterly ex\namination, by Edmund Gurney, of the evidence for Witchcraft and Magic.\nThis examination is founded, the author says, \"on a careful search through\nabout two hundred and sixty books on the subject (including, I think, most\nof the principal ones of tho Kith, 17th, and 18th centuries), and a large number\nof contemporary records of trials.\" The conclusion at which Gurney arrives\nis that \"there is a total absence of respectable evidence, and an almost\ntotal absence of any first-hand evidence at all, for those phencmcna of\nmagic and witchcraft which cannot bo accounted for as the results of\ndiseased imagination, hysteria, hypnotism, and occasionally, perhaps, of\ntelepathy.\"\nThe results of this careful and laborious study do not encourage further\nexcursions in the same country. There is ample material for the chapter in\nthe \"History of Human Error\" which Mr. Lang desires. It will be a\nvoluminous chapter ; while the \"residuum of fact\" may probably be con\ntained in very few paragraphs. It is with this \" residuum of fact \" that\nPsychical Research is mainly concerned, at any rate for the present ; and\nit is clear that for the establishment of facts we must rely almost entirely on\ncontemporary and recent evidence.\nThe grounds for this conclusion are two-fold. In the first place, a careful\nscrutiny and sifting of evidence, such as is now thought necessary, was almost\nunknown among the older recorders. This is plain to anyone who reads Mr.\nGurney's note on Witchcraft, and might be illustrated abundantly from the\nSecret Commonwealth. 1 This destroys the value of a large part of the evidence.\nIn the second place, even in the case of such evidence as primd facie will\nsatisfy the high standard of modern requirements, there Ls no means of\ntesting it in the manner which is familiar to readers of the Journal and\nProceedings of the Society. In accounts of occurrences one, two, three, or\nmore centuries ago it is impossible to verify dates, to establish coincidences,\nto examine witnesses, and to obtain corroborative evidence. Experience of\ncontemporary cases shows that,'_without such examination and corroboration,\nreports of extraordinary occurrences, even when at first hand, are of im\nperfect evidential value.\nI am inclined to think, too, that Mr. Lang has laid rather too much stress\n1 For example, Kirk states, without any expression of doubt, and without think\ning it necessary to state his evidence, that \" Walter Grahame, someTime living in the\nParoch wherein now I am shot a Hair with his eyes, having praised\nits swiftness (such was the Infection of ane evill Eye).\" He adds that this was \" un-\nusuall.\"\n\f.Supplement.l 3G9\nReview.\nupon the coincidences between the old and the new, the civilised and the\nuncivilised. It would be a serious task to catalogue the beliefs which do\nnot find a parallel in modern records ; but they far outnumber those that\ndo. To give one example only, second sight may have its parallel in telepathy,\nbut the \"odd solemnity\" by which the \"Priviledges of the whole Mistery\"\nwere acquired is not practised or believed to be efficacious by the moderns.\n\" He must run a Tedder of Hair (which bound a Corps to the Bior) in a Helix\nabout his Midle from End to End ; then bow his Head downwards, as did\nElijah, 1. Kings 18. 42, and look back through his Legs untill he sie a Funerall\n.advance till the People cross two Marches.\" The attitude is more uncomfort\nable than that in which Peter Ibbetson \" dreamed true \"; and, moreover, not\nwithout risk\u2014for \"if the Wind change Points while the Hair Tedder is ty'd\nabout him, he is in Peril of his Lyfe.\" Darwin used to say that no experi\nment is too absurd to try, but we may doubt whether Mr. Lang would\nclesire his historical inquirer to make practical investigations into this and\nother similar neglected branches of art.\nThe whole mass of folk-lore, myth, magic, and all the beliefs of an uncritical\nage are compounded of many elements. Mr. Lang's conclusion as to the Fairy\nbelief is that it is \"a complex matter, from which tradition, with its memory\nof earth-dwellers, is not wholly absent, while more is due to a survival of the\npre-Christian Hades, and to the belief in local spirits\u2014 the Vuis of\nMelanesia, the Nereids of ancient and modern Greece, the Lares of Rome,\nthe fateful Mcene and Hathors\u2014old imaginings of a world not yet 'dis\npeopled of its dreams.' \" Thus, even in a belief which appears to be so far\nremoved from reality as this, Mr. Lang admits that there may be some element\nof fact. A similar analysis may be applied to other kinds of belief. The\nprimary object of Psychical Research is to separate the element of fact, and\nfor this purpose, as I have said, only contemporary evidence can serve.\nIt is this possible element of fact which Mr. Lang appears to neglect\nwhen he sums up his results by saying\u2014\" our only conclusion is that the\npsychological conditions which begat the ancient narratives px-oduce the new\nlegends.\" Why, then, if the psychological conditions are unchanged, are\nthere many old legends which have no analogues among the new ? Mr. Lang\ngives no answer to the question. In fact, he does not ask it, because he only\ncollects likenesses and not differences, and therefore the differences and\nomissions do not strike him. The answer, I think, is that the legends are\nbegotten not by psychological conditions alone, but by psychological con\nditions together with a certain substratum of fact. The psychological con\nditions have changed, as civilisation has advanced, in the direction of moro\nstringent criticism of evidence. The result is that the legends with the\nleast substratum of fact have died out, while those which have a greater\nsubstratum of fact still survive in some form. This consideration, if valid,\nmay encourage an examination of modem beliefs, with the object of finding\nthe underlying facts ; but, for the reasons given above, such an examination\nmust be carried on by scrutiny of contemporary evidence, and by experi\nments. Comparison with the old stories will give very little result.\nH.
