Note alfo, that the fuperior planets 'b , !{., and\n^ are never faid to apply unto any, unlefs they are retro-,\ngrade ; but the lefler or inferior (as it is among men) makes*\ntheir application unto them.\nSeparation is when two planets are departed from each\nother 6 minutes ; as the O in 10 deg. 10 min. of z:z, and\nthe 5 in 10 deg. 10 min. of the fame fign, this now is a\nperfeft fynod or conjundiion, but when the D lhall come to be\n10 deg. and 16 min. of XCC\", which is 6 min. diftant, then\nIhe may be faid to be feparated from the \u00a9, yet they can-\nnot be faid to be totally feparated, until they be clear from\neach others rays of half their orbs.\nProhibition ; of which there are two forts. The firft is\nwhen two planets are applying one to the other ; but be-\n'\nfore they can come to a partial afpeft, another planet, fwift-\ner in motion, interpofeth his rays, and prohibites or hinders\nthe application ; as for example, Tj being in 10 deg. of v,\nand ^ in 6 deg. of n, and the \u00a9 in 5 deg. of n, here $\napplies unto b by a , but the \u00a9 being in 5 deg. of n,\nand fwifter in motion than $ , prohibits $ , and comes to\nthe of b before him. The fecond kind of prohibition is,\nwhen one fignificator is applying to another by body cr\nafpedf, becomes retrograde, and fo makes no application\nuntil one of thofe planets are feparated out of thofe figns\nthey were in, or apply to other planets. Example, fuppofe\n^ in 6 deg, of u, and If. 1 deg. of fy, here d' applies\n\f,1\n\u00ab : I\n( 49 )\n;to a 5^\u00ab of %, but before he comes to his true il(, falls re-i\nrtrograde, and fo is prohibited, and this fort of prohibition iaij\nrtermed refrenaiion. _ _\n.\nTranjlation of Light and Nature, is when a lighter planet i j\ncfeparates from a more weighty one, and prefently joins tojj\nianother more heavy or ponderous, as $ in 26 deg. of\n? in 27 deg. and 'll in 29 deg. of the fame fign ; here ?\nIfeparates from a (5 of ^ , and applies immediately to a (5 ^\nlof 'll, and fo tranflates the light and virtue of $ untoi\nihim : it is performed as well by afpedl as body, after the !\nifame manner. 1\nColleSlion of Light is when two planets are not in afpedl oneJ\nwith another, but both call their afpedls to a more ponderousn\ntor weighty planet than themfelves, and they both received s\nIhim in fome of their efhitial dignities. \\\nReception, is when planets are in each other\u2019s dignities^jj\nihoufe, exaltation, triplicity and term ;\nas If. in y , and ? |\niin X ; here If. and ? are in reception by houfe, and know ij\nJthat this is the bell fort of reception. -j\nSecondly, by exaltation, as ? in $ in K> and this;)\niis a good reception alfo. \u2022 \\\nThirdly, it may be by triplicity, as ? in v, and the O\niin Vf ; and this is good, though not fo excellent as the J\niformer.\n|\nFourthly, by term, thus d' in 16 deg. of n, and ? 24!\ndeg. of \u00abY' ; here S and ? are in reception by term ;\nand\n|\nmote, this is the meanell of receptions, yet half a loaf is bet- {\nUer- than no bread. ;\nPeregrination.

The Quefited is the perfon or thing enquired *\nIfter, as for exmaple, in varying a figure according to the\nnatter or thing propounded : -fnppofe a man enquire concern- i\nng his brother, or fome fmall journey ; the firll houfe (as be- |\nore) his lord and th^ D are for the Querent ; but the third\noui'e, with the lord thereof, and planets therein, (if any)\n;re for the brother, brethren, or fmall journey.

When in a queftion, either the very beginning, or\ntatter end of a fign afeend, it is not fafe to give judgment,\nj\nfor if the beginning of a fign afeends, the queftion is im- ^\noroper'y propounded ; if t.He latter end thereof afeend, the\nQuerent has either been tampering with others about the\nmatter, or the queftion is forged.\n3dly, When the moon is in a Combujla, the combuft way,\ner void of courfe, the matter propounded goes unluckily on;\ntherefore at iuch times, let the artirt defer his judgment.\n4th!y, The moon, or lord of the afeendant,, in oppoficioti\n\f'\n( S6 )\nthe lord of the feventh houfe (which fignifies the artift)\n|\nthe Qqerent may then be concluded a knave, or fool, or j\nboth, and comes to abufe both the art and artift, at which)\ntime, Jay to tftem (as 1 ufually do) \" Friend, I find, .\n\u201c fffc. that the matter propounded is not ferious, and there-\n\u201c fore, if you will trouble me for yoiir pleafure, firft fatisfy ;\n\u201c me for my pains,\u201d and they will immediately retire.\nAnd Note, That if the 7th houfe be afflifted, or its lord\nretrograde or combuft, (except the matter propounded re-\nlateth thereto) the aftrologer doth (by giving judgment\nat fuch times) difgrace both the art and himfelf ; and if he\nadventureth to judge, the more difcrcdit he is liable to,\nwhich is the meaning of Ptolomy\u2019s words, ^antis in errori-\nbns verfatiir Aftrologus cum locus feptimus ac ejus Dominus aff.icl-\n5\nierunt.

When the teftimonies in your figure are equal, the\nmatter propounded ought not to be judged, by reafon the\ns\nartift then knows not which way the fcales may turn, therc-\nJ fore ought to defer judgment till a more proper time.\nI\nSthly, Some authors hold the queftion to be radical, when\nj\nthe lord of the afcendant, and lord of the hour, are of one\ni\nnature and triplicity, which is thus known ; fuppofe af- \/\nI\ncend at the time of the queftion, and $ happen to be lord\ni of the hour, here the queftion will be found radical, be-\n'\ncaufe the G who is lord of the afcendant and $ , are of one\nnature, nsisc. hot and dry; or if at the fame time, Jupiter\nhappen to be lord of the hour, the queftion will then be radi-\ncal, in regard 'll. is of the fame triplicity with the G , and\nj\nfo of the reft.\nOf the PoJJlbility, or Impojflbility ofthe matter propounded,\nWhatfoevcr is propounded, carrieth in the face thereof.\n\fboth a negative, and an affirmative, that is to fay, it mav^\nI either be brought to pafs by a wiffied conclufion or not, fori\n: all things under the Sun are contingent. {\nill. Matters are brought to pafs divers ways, (viz.)\n\u2022 when the planets fignifying the perfon propounding ;\nand\n:the perfon or thing enquired after, are going to Conjunc-\nition, Sextile or Trine, to each other in good places of the\nI figure, and fometimes by tranflation or colleftion of light\n;\nlor by the dwelling in houfes or dignities.\nadly. When the fignincators apply to a Conjun<5lion in\nlan angle, the bufinefs may be brought to pafs ; if the fig-\nmificator of the thing promifed, be fortified, and apply to\nihe lord of the aicendant, the matter or thing will be\ntbr.Tught to pafs.\nNow as I have (hewed the poffibility of bringing things\nlo pafs ; it is requifite 1 (hew the impo(ubility, which is\n(known from thefe following aphorifms.\nill, If the fignificators of the querent and quefited are not\nbeholding each other, it is an argument the thing enquir-\ned after will not be brought to perfection.\nzdly. When the fignificators (hall behold each other from\nihateful places of the figure, or (liall be in a or \u00a7 of the\nanfortunes, it is feldom known that upon fuch politions, any\nithing be brought to a good conclufion.\n3d!y, When the fignificators a.-e combufi, cadent, or void\nof reception, it is a miracle if they -bring anv thing to per-\nifeClion, when either the infortunes, or cauUa draconis, (hall\nlocated in the houfe fignifying the thing enquired after,\nihe bufinefs will be brought to an unprofperous end.\nOfthe perfon or matter impeding or furthering the htfnefs.\nWhen in your figure you find an obftruClion or further-\nlance of your bufinefs, obferve the planet impediting or ad-\njjuvant, and the houfe or houfes where he or (he governs\n;\nfend fay the ktt or furtherance (hall come from fuch a per-\ni(bn or thing, fignilied by the houle or houfes he or (he doth,\ngovern\n;\nExample.\n\fof the 3d, fay a brother or klnfman will be the occafion of\nthe good or evil portended in the bufinefs ; if he be lord of\nthe 2d, fay that money or want thereof, will either help or .\nhinder it ; he that underftands this rule, cannot be to feek\nin the refolution of any queftion, and he that underftands it\nnot, is not fit to judge any thing of this nature.\nTo knovj %vhen, or in ivhat time, a hufinefs may be performed.\nTake the diftance between the two fignificators, either\nby body or afpeft, and turn it into time thus\n:\nIf the fignificators are in moveable figns, and fwift in\nmotion, look how many degrees of diftance you have, for\nib many days it will be ; if flow in motion, fo many weeks\n;\nif in common figns, and flow in niotion, it will be fo many\nmonths, if fwift, fo many weeks ; if they be in fixt figns,\nand flow in motion, it will be fo many years, if fwift fo\nmany months as you have diftance.\nNote, Angles are equivalent to moveable figns ; fucceed-\nents to common or corporal ; cadent to fixed ; the ufe\nwhereof, is this, when you find the diftance of the fignifica-\ntors, and in angles, you may be the more pofitive of the\nfpeedy performance of the bufinefs, when you fee the great\nprobability of the performance of bufinefs, and the fignifica-\ntors immediately applying to a Conjunftion or good af-\npedl ;\nthen for the true time of pierformance, oblerve the\n'\nday of the faid Conjundlion or afpedl ; this is an excellent\nrule, not vulgar with aftrologers, that.. 1 have often found\ntrue by experience. '\nI\nOf the Moles and Marks of the ^erent and ^eftcd, and hew\nto find them.\nThe knowledge of moles or marks are a good way to\nverify your figure, and prove it radical, for if the moles,\nWr. correfpond with the fcheme or figure erefled, the ar-\nlift may with fafety, proceed to judgment. The rules follow\n:\n1 . Having eredled your figure, confider tlie fign afcend-\ning, and on the member reprefented thereby, tell the Que-\nrent he hath .a mole, mark or (kar:\nEKample,,.\n\fExample. i\nSuppofe r afcend, and $ the lord thereof above the\n|\nearth, the querent hath a mole or mark on his face; if \u00ab ,\n|\nX)n his neck or throat, i5c.\n|\n2 . Obferve what fign the lord of the afcendant is in, for i\nDU that member the Querent hath another mole. Confider I\nnlfo the lord of the 6th, with the cufp thereof, for in thofe\n|\nmembers the Querent is alfo marked : likewife, obferve the\nplace of the moon, for the Querent hatk another mole, and I\nr.he more certain, if Ihe be affliifted ; if the planet and^ fign\n|\nifignifying the mark or mol? be mafculine, the mark, ijjc. is i\non the right fide of the body ; if feminine, on the left : if\nihe fignificator of the mole, IsSc. be above the earth, the\nmark or mole, ^r. is then vifible to the eye and on the\n:he forepart of the body ;\nbut if he be under the earth,\nlit is not then to be feen, but is on the back-part of the bo-\nBy. If few degrees afcend on the horefcope, or defcend on\n5he 6th, or if the lord of the afcendant, lord of the 6th houfe,\nand the moon be in the beginning of figns, then judge the\n\u2022moles, to be in the upper part of that member repre-\nflented. If they or either of them, be in the middle of figns,\nihen the marks or moles, are in the middle of the member ;\nbut if they be in latter degrees of the figns, you may be con-\nitident, that the moles, i3c. are on the lower parts of the\nmember.\nNote, If an infortune be In the afcendant of any queftion\nihe face of the querent is ufually blemilhed ; for the face\nis always fignified by the firft houfe, let any fign whatfbever\nafcend ; and this 1 have very often experimented.\nThefe rules have the fame fignification upon the body of\nttheQuefited; as for example, Suppofeone Ihouldenquireofa\nMweetheart or wife, &c. the yth houfe will be her firft, the\nttwelfth her fixth, and according as the figns and their lords ^\nare pofited, fo judge as you did for the querent, as to marks\na\u2019iid moles ; and indeed upon any other account.\n\fTHE\nART OF RESOLVING H\nj\nHORARY Q^U E S T I O N S..\n.1\n;\n\u00bb ^\nI\nJ\n1\n'\n.\n'\nI\nT is an obfervation mod true, that all people endued j\nwith reafon, are felicitous to know their feature eftate {\nland condition ; but a? fome perfons find it impofli{)le to pro- ;\n)cure the exaft time of their birth, aftrology fupplies that J\nidefefl, by the doftrine of Horary Queftions. So that from\nla queftion ferioufly propounded, alraoft as much fatisfaftion j\nmay be given the querent, upon many fubjedts of enquiry,\nas if his nativity were adtually known. For as the nativity\nis the time of the birth of the body, the horary queftion is\nthe time of the birth of the mind; and there are few per-\nfons living but what are in fome way or other fubjeft to\nhorary doubts, which being ferioufly propounded in the\nI\nfhape of a queftion, may be fatisfaftorily refolved. This\n! dodrine feems to be founded upon that miraculous fympa-\nI\nthy in nature, which is admirably raanifefted between the ^\ni\nmoon and the fea; by which, that amazing body of water |\n'\nis conftantly drawn after her, though no man fees, or can\n;\nconceive how. In thefe fympathies there can be no doubt ^\nj\nbut the vegetive foul of the world invifibly carries and\n;\nunites a fpecific virtue from the heavens between one thing, ;\n'\nand another, every where working thofe fecret effedls, which\n;\nno mortal can fail to admire. And in the prefent cafe, who i\n:\nis to determine what this foul cannot effedl between the\n'\nheavenly bodies and the animal fpirit of man, working fuch i\nfympathies, as that a queftion of Importance to our welfare\n: cannot ftart from the mind, but in a point of time when the ,\nplanets and figns governing the perfon\u2019s birth, are afling\n\f( )\n;pon the very rubjefl that engages his thoughts and atten-\nton. And hence the birth of the queftion, like the nati-\niity of a child, carries the ftory of the whole matter in hand,\nipon its forehead. And hence arifes that Ikill in natural\nrredidtions, by which the artiJl is enabled to demonllrate\ntie particulars of the ct'ent required ; and this as well by\nne liars of heaven, as Abiather the priell was of old en-\nibied to do by the liars of the Ephod.\nBut, however, the predidlions that are made from the\nuellionary way, are by no means fo perfect and correft as\nhofe deduced from nativities, and therefore I recommend\n111 judgments on futurity to be made from nativities, when\n;iey can be prqcured, rather than from horary queftions.\n3ut at the fame time I am very confident that the omni-\nxient Creator is not at all wanting for any pollible care in\nis contrivance of the works of nature, for the fupply of all\nur moderate wants and enquiries. And if it be effential\n:o man\u2019s welfare to be forewarned of the time and the judg-\nment, as Solomon declares it is, and that the wife manjhall\n\\nvw it \u2022, then it is plain that God has alForded means to\nibtain this knowledge w'ithout a miracle ; and this means\nciay furely be by the liars of heaven, refponding cur horary\niiuelllons, and experience continually affirms day by day\nthat it is fo. Not that I believe the' trivial concerns and\niccidents of mankind, as feme writers have pretended, as if\nglove loll or hidden in fport and wantonnels, Ihould be fo\nx'atched and attended by the heavenly intelligencers, that\nrhey mull needs point out where this'piece of leather were\nCO be found ; or that queftions propounded out of mere cu-\niiofuy or diverfion, are to be refolved by them. No, God\u2019s\n|\/orks are ferious, and not to be made the fport and ridi-\nlule of the gay and inconfiderate. For although the hea-\nTcnly contrivance may aptly refpond our ferious and im-\nBOrtant concerns, as when David anxioully defired to know\nwhether he Jhould go up into any if the cities ofJudah, and which\n'fthem? yet that they Ihould as aptly fatisfy our intempe-\nlate defires, and be fubfervient to our frolicks, is too ridi-\nlulous to imagine. There is no doubt but the heavens are\n* Ecclef. viii. 12. and v. 6.\nable\n\f( 62 )\nable to fliew us more learning than we mortals, in this ftate\nof frailty and corruption, can ever attain to underftand\n;\nand it is a great bounty of God that we know fo much)*^\n,\nas we do ;\ntherefore it highly becomes very wife and\ngood man,to glorify the maker of all things for the little know-\nledge he can and doth attain, and to be careful how he\nfports even with the leaft among his gracious works.\nAll enquiries that are ferious, and that come under the\ndenomination, of an horary queftion, muft neceflarily relate\n'\neither to things pojl, prefent , or to come ; or to concerns that\nOHce nowo dt'Cy or mciy he hcceuj'tei j and the anfwer to\nfuch queftions mult be either or araVew\/fl\/. The ef-\nfential anfwer is always one of the three things following,\nto wit, that the matter concerning which the enquir)\u2019 is\nmade, is, firft, to be, or not to be-, fecond, either good, or bad ;\nand third, either true ox falfe. Therefore, if the queltion '\nI\nbe real, and the matter rightly ftated, the true anfwer,\n*\nwhich is always Ihort, will be eafily difcovered by the fol-\nlowing rules. The accidental anfwer, is that vvhich apper-\ni\ntains to the accidents of the bufinefs in hand ; and is always\n! defined by nuhc'c, ^xben, ho^x, or ^jjhy.\n^\nAnd whoever at-\ntempts to extend his judgment beyond thefe limits, ftrains\n; art beyond its bounds, and forces it to fpeak that which it\ni is totally incapable of, and by this means many pretenders\nj\nto Aftrology fail egregioufly in their undertakings. To\n! avoid this, let the following queries be attended to :\nquestions proper for the FIRST HOUSE.\nWhether the ^erent may enjoy Health, long Life, vfTc.\n1 In the refolutlon of this queftion, you muft obferye the\n'\nfign afeending, the lord thereof, and the Moon, and if you\ni find them free from the ill afpefts of Saturn and Mars, or\n\u2022,\nthe lords of the fixth, eighth, fourth, and twelfth houfes,\n;\nand they free from combuftion,. and fwift in motion, theiC\ni are certain tellimonies of a long life, provided the laid fig-\n^\ni nificators bj not afiiiaed by the prefence of violent fixed\n1 ,\nliar?\n;\n\f\u2022\niftars; but if the lord- of the afcendant be combuft, retro- j\nlerade, or in fquare or oppofition to the infortunes, or lord\n<of the fourth, eighth, fixth, or twelfth, and this in an evil\n|\n\u2022place of heaven, you may truly judge that the querent is 1\nihckly and (hort lived; efpecially if !{. , \u00a9 , and $ be weak and 1\nlafliifted; the manner and time thereof fltall be demonftrated\ntin the judgment of the eighth houfe. I\nOf the Good or E-vil attending the ^erent during Life.\n_\n1\n. When fortunate planets are in the afcendant or the prin-\n|\nicipal places of the figure, they denote much good unto the I\niquerent, during the future part of his life, provided they be n\nlin good afpeft of the Moon, and ihe applying W thofe af-\nipedfs ; but if Ihe be fcparating, it fhews what is paft, ac-\nj cording to the nature of the alpefk, be -it either good or\nlevil ; as forinflance, if Saturn be in the afcendant, and af-\ntflift the Moon or Lord of the afeendaru, the querent will\n-ibe melancholy and penfive, and fubjeflto vexations and\nItroubles from aged men, &c. If Mars, he will be choleric,\nand ofien be opprefled by thieves and .knaves, and many\n: times fufFers by treachery of kindred, or by pretended\n:friend(h!p; if the S be there, he is feldom free from fcan-\n. dal and difgrace. .\nHave great regard to the houfes thefe afHifling planets\ni govern, for from thence is known by what means the que-\n\"rent fhall be fortunate or unhappy.\nih'hat time the Natme or Querent may expert a Change.\nWhen a ferious queftion of this nature is propounded,\nhaving credited a figure, I draw it into a fpeculum (as in a\nnativity) and diredil the fignificators to their feveral pro-\n. mittors. Then having the true diftance of each fignifica-\n' tor, from his promittor, I convert the degrees and minutes\ninto time, as in a nativity, and according to the effects of\ndireftions, I ufually judge thereof; but this method ison-\nI\nly neceflary when a nativity cannot be obtained, and the\n:\nqueftion of weighty concernment, and not upon light and\n.> ordinary bufinefs.\nBut in queftions of indllFerency, or of trivial concern-;\nE oient, you may obferve the jdegrees of diftance between |\nthe,\n\fthe fignificators by body or afpedts, and judge certain\nenough.\n^\nWhat Part of the ^erenPi Life is like to he hef. ^\nTo refolve this queftion, you muft note what part of the\nfigure the fortunate liars are in, and according to their po-\nlition judge thereof.\nIf fortunate planets be in the afcendant, in the twelfth,\nor eleventh houfe, the querent will be moll happy and for-\ntunate in his infancy or younger years ; if in the tenth,\nninth, or eighth, the good fortune will happen in the fecond\npart of his age ; if in the feventh, lixth, or fifth houfe, it\nwill happen after his middle age ; if in the fourth, third,\nand fecond, his latter age will be moll happy.\nSome authors (and thofe of good credit too) hold, that\nin this manner of judgment, we ought to allow to every ^\nhoufe the fortunate planets are diftant from the afcendant *\n\\\nfive years, and accordingly judge of the time of the querents\nhappy and fortunate Hate.\nI\nAnd when in a quellion you find the fignificators of life\n' are llrong, and fignify long life, you may add one year to\nI\nevery houfe, for it is then more than probable the querent\n! may live more than 6o years.\nI\nTtrward nuhat Part of the World may the ^iuerent direS his\nj\nCourfe to prefper.\nI\nNote, that the whole heaven is divided into four quar-\nI\nters, viz, Ea(l, Well, North, and South.

Advertifmetits concerning the Firf Houfe.\nThat which is chiefly to be confldered herein, is to take\nnotice under w^at planets both the querent and quefited are\nI\ngoverned: in all queftions and demands whatfoever, the\nI\ndegrees afeending on the cufp of the firfl: Houfe, doth ufu-\n:\nally perfonate the native or queient, and doth properly\ncon-\n\f( *33 )\niiconcern the cafualties belonging unto their body; but the\nilord thereofv efpecially if in his own terms, lhall concern\nihis aftiqns, as having to do with others, except fometimes\n:by accident a planet happens to be ftrong in the afcendant\nAM the birth, or be almuten of the figure, and then the native\n;or querent will participate of the nature of that planet,\nwhich unto people of years may be known by their qua-\n.lities, trades, or profefiions, (they continuing therein)\n^without having their nativities, but a child or youth can-\nunot well be capable of Eiedlions, except his nativity may\nibe had, and fo by the rules beforegoing find under what\njplanet he is governed ; for a Mars-youth, or a Mars-man\nrdoth not always bear a Mars-fhape ;\nnor yet a Venus-man a\n' Venus-lhape ; for the figns whereof they are lords doth ufu-\niaily dtferibe their perfons (except fometimes by accident as\n;afcrera;d, neither can the Ibape of any man or woman dif-\nI cover under what planet they are governed ; for we know\n1 there is a great difference in (hapea between the figns and\nitheir lords deferibed. And oft-times neither the fign af-\n)ce,nding, nor lord thereof perfonate or deferibe what qual-\niicies are predominant in the native ;\nfor that planet which\nI is almuten of the figure many times doth do it. As in-\n: fiance, in the geniture of Henry the Eighth, King of Eng-\n. land, fet forth by the learned Cardan, in which nativity we\nfind the fign JiJi to afeend, whereof $ is lord, yet neither\n'\nthe fign afeending, of its lord doth perlonate, or deferibe his\nfitape, qualities or natural inclinations ;\nfor he was clearly\nunder d , and martially inclined, the reafon thereof is be-\ncaufe d is almuten of his figure, as having moll effential\n\u2018\ndignities in the afcendant, rhid heaven and place of the lu-\nminaries, yet nothwithftanding he might, and did fome\nwhat participate of the nature of O, 5 and ? ; for \u00a7 is\ni in the Houfc of \u00a9, and the O in his terms, \u00a7 is all'o in\n^ to $ , and Ihe in platick A to the afcendant, and the\nluminaries in angles, all which might well fignify the lofti-\nnefs of his fancy and Ipirit ; but in cafe of Eieflion we can\n\u2022 allot but or e planet to the querent, and one to the quefited,\nwhich mull be thofe that have the greatcll predominacy\n' over them, according to their lliape qualities or profeliions.\nGenerally\n\f( ^34 )\nGenerally I have obferved that in what planets terms the\ndegrees afcending are in, or the lord thereof, efpecially if\nii almuten of the figure, fuch will be the natives or 'querents\n1\nqualities, or natural inclinations, and he lhall naturally ei-\nther by trade, office or profeflion, defire to follow, or em- ,\nploy himfelf, in fuch a way which is fuitable to luch a'\nplanet, wherefore in this way of Elcftions I rather adhere\nunto the qualities, trade, office cr employment of the que-\n.rent, and efpecially of the quefited if of age (than unto\n\u2019\ntheir bodily fhape) for oft-times when either nx or T af-\ncends at the time of birth or queftion, the native or que-\n!'\nrent fhall not refemble the fhape of a Mars-man or woman,\nbut rather correfpond with the afcendant or planet ftrong\nin the afcendant, or almuten of the figure ;\nfor although\n; the native or 'querents perfon may be folar or faturnine,\n||\nyet by the rules beforegoing he may be martially inclined,\nI' and under $ , or according unto the nature of any other\n!' planet under which he is governed; were It not fo, each\ntrade or profeffion would have m^enbut of one fhape, and fo\nall men governed under any planet the like ;\nbut we fee dai-\nly to the contrary; for there are of all fhapes under any\n'\nplanet governed, and likewile in every trade or profeffion\nwhatfoever ;\nwherefore except the native or querents per-\nfon reprefenting any planet doth correfpond in qualities,\n;\ntrade and profeffion, it will not ferve in cafe of eleftions.\nI have found by experience, that young men being put\n'\nunto fuch trades or profeflions which they were not natural-\n!! ly add:\u00a3led unto, or did delight in, they feldom or ne-\n|j\nver do ferve cut their times; and if they do endure their,\n!'\nbondage, and fet up their trade, is ten to one if they thrive,\nI. or long continue therein ; for they will be apt to alter thei\ncalling according unto the nature of that planet which mofl\npredominacy over them generally, in rcfolving any quef-\nI\ntions efpecially in cledlicns, the afcendant muft be obtained\n'\neither from the nativity, or frem feme accident of body, or\n, from the tim.e when the queient doth propound the quef-\n! tion : and then if the figure beiadical, we need not trouble\nf\nourfclves any further, but only by the rules beforegoing to\nj\nfind under what phar.et the querent is governed, v\/h\u2019ch rrutl\n\f( 135 ) !\nube either the lord of the afcendant, or planet ftrong in the\n^\nnafcendant, or almucen of the figure, which by obferving the\n'\ni; querents fhapc, temper and profeflion may eafily be difco- ^\nlivered. But as to the quefitei there is no other way (except\nj their nativity might be had) but only by their fex, fliape,\n1 temper, employment, trade, or profeffion, to find what\n^planet is agreeable thereunto ; and if their bodily (hape and\nprofeflion doth accord it is the better ; it matters not of\nnvhat relation they are to the querent, for kindred, brothers,\nineio-hbours, &c. may be under feveral planets governed, fo\n. that to take the lord of the third in cafe of dealing with a\n\u2018 kinfman, neighbour, or brother will not ferve, except the\nt lord thereof doth accord in bodily ihape and qualities, and\nfo of the reft.
