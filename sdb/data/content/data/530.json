[April 24,\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE GENERAL MEETING ON\nFriOOy, April 24, 1885.\nThe thirteenth General Meeting of the Society was held at the\nRooms ot the Society of British Artists, Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, on\nFriday, April 24, 1885.\nPROFESSOR BALFOUR STEWART, F.R.S., PRESIDENT, IN TilE CIIAIR.\nThe President made the following address :-\nII.\nYou will permit me on this occasion to allude to the great loss\nwhich our Society has sustained in the resignation by Professor\nSidgwick of the office of President.\nI cannot i:nagine one better fitted than our late President to develop\ninto vigorous action a struggling body such as ours, and we must all\nfeel deeply grateful to him for his successful accomplishment of this\nobject.\nHe has procured the recognition by men of education of a society\nwhose advent was at first scmewhat coldly welcomed by the fraternity\nof knowledge.\nUnder these circumstanceseverything depended on the choice of guar-\ndians for'the infant Society.Had itbeen injudiciouslyledit wouldcertainly\nha.ve proved a failure, and have thus strengthened the widespread belief\nthat no good result iH to be obtained by discussing subjects of a certain\nclass. But things have happily turned out far otherwise, and the recogni-\ntion which our Society enjoys to-day is greatly due to its guidance by a.\nPresident and officers who, through a happy mixture of boldness and\nprudence, carried ene.\u00b7getically into action, have succeeded in bringing it\ninto its present position. Professor Sidgwick'sbenefits to the Society were\nnot merely those of a wise and energetic guidance of its affairs. He was\nunsparing in e....ery sense where he felt that the interests of the Society\nrequired support, and he is not only our first and honoured President\nbut one of our chief benefactors.\nSuccess of this nature cannot be equalled or even approached. But\nit is not, therefore, with a feeling of despair that I commence this\nevening the duties of the office with which I have been honoured,\nknowing that gratitude to my predecessor should prompt me to give\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] Pre8ident'8 Addre88. 65\nhim what reliet I ca.n, and to do what I can for the benefit of a Society\nwhich has strong claims upon all who are desirous to promote know-\nledge.\nIt may not be out of place to bring before you a few statistics ofour\nprogress.\nA preliminary conference was con.ened by Professor Barrett (whom\nwe honour as our founder) on the 5th and 6th of January, 1882. At\nthis meeting a Committee of sixteen were appointed, to which a few\nadditions were afterwards made.\nThe Society was next formally constituted in accordance with the\nreport of the Conference Committee at an adjourned meeting of the\nConference held on 20th February, 1882, the Committee being consti-\ntuted as the Council ofthe new Society under the presidency' of Professor\nlIenry Sidgwick.\nAt the first meeting of the Council, held on the 3rd March, 1882, a\nnumber of proposals for election were brought forward, and at its\nsecond meeting on the 17th March, 20 Members and 11 Associates were\nelected.\nAt the end of 1882 the total number of the Society was 150; at\nthe end of 1883 it was 288; at the end of 1884 it was 520; while at\nthe present moment the total number is 586.\nIf these results are very encouraging as regards numbers it is a\nsource of equal gratification to think that men of the highest standing\nin all departments of knowledge have consented to join our ranks; and\nyou have been already informed by Professor Barrett that a kindred\nSocietyhas recently been started in America under very favourable cir-\ncumstances, embracing, likewise, amongst its members men of the\nhighest attainments and standing.\nIn reply to the question, what has the Society done 1 I may state\nthat since its commencement it has issued seven parts of Proceeding.,\nof which a total number exceeding 12,000 has been distributed to\nMembers and others, placed in public libraries, sent for review, and sold\nthrough the ordinary channels. An eighth part will be published very\nshortly.\nEarly in 1884 a Joomal was commenced, which has been continued\nmonthly for private circulation amongst members.\nIn the autumn of last year a Report of the Committee on Theo-\nsophical Phenomena was issued for private circulation only.\nA large number of slips has also been printed comprising a\nselection of the evidence collected in the various departments of\ninquiry.\nAll these schemes could not have been carried out by means of the\nordinary income of the Society, and their successful accomplishment is\ndue to the fact that we have Members who are willing not only to\nJ!\nDigitized by Google\n\f66 President!s Address. [April 24,\ndevote their time and energy, but likewise their private means, to the\nadvancement of our interests.\nThe cost of the slips of printed matter and of the Theosophical\nReport was bome by our late President. The printing of the slips\nis now suspended, it being intended to publish selections from the\nevidence in the JOfIIf'n(JZ of our Society. Professor Sidgwick has mea.n-\nwhile agreed to be editor of the Journal, nor while devoting his time in\nthis way to the service of the Society has he discontinued his former\nliberality, but rather transferred it into this new channel.\nThe library of the Society consists of more than 800 volumes,\nof which about 250 are French and German works. A great many of\nthe English books have been presented through the kind liberality of\nMembers and friends.\nI have read with much interest in the pages of our Journal a.\ncorrespondence between our Secretary, Mr. Gurney, and Professor\nNewcomb, the distinguished President of the American Psychical\nSociety. .\nIt would appear from this correspondence that there is a perfect\na.greement as to the great importance of studying experimentally the\nsubject of thought-transference.\nTo my mind the evidence already adduced is such as to render\nhighly probable the occasional presence amongst us of something which\nwe may call thought-transference or more generally telepathy; but it is\nsurely our duty as a Society to cOntinue to accumulate evidence until\nthe existence of such a power cannot be controverted. We have not\nbeen remiss in this respect, and it will be found from the pages of our\nProceedings that the main strength of our Society has been given to\nprove tho existence of telepathy, in the belief that such a fact well\nestablished will not only possess an independent value of its own, but\nwill serve as an ndmirable basis for further operations.\nBut our Society has not only its staffofobserversand experimenters,\nit has likewise its literary staff, whose duty it is to collect and\nJlCrutinise the existing evidence on the various subjects embraced in\nPsychical Research. Now, it would appear to me to be the one\nunpardonable offence if this Literary Committee were to decline to\ninvite, to listen to, to examine, or to register the contemporaneous\nevidence on any branch of psychical inquiry.\nIt is no doubt quite ,--onceivable that after a quantity of evidence\non some subject has been collected, the result of its discussion should\nprove that there is nothing in it worth inquiring into, at least nothing\nnew. But a definite settlement, even of a negative character, is not\nwithout its value, and this can only be obtained as the result of an\nexhaustive discussion. On the other hand it is conceivable that the\nresult of such a discussion ma.y be the establishment of new facts\nDigitized by Google\n\f1886.] Presid8nf, .A.ddreu. 67\neminently worthy of record, and the next generation of our Society\nwould greatly blame the present if we declined to bring together.\nexamine,and register the contemporaneous evidence, so as to fit it, ifnot\nfor our own final discussion, at least for that of those who shall come\nafter UL\nBut perhaps the best justification of the labours of the Literary\nCommittee is to be found in what they have already done. As regards\napparitions at the moment of death, I will quote the following state-\nment by Mr. Gurney: \" We have,\" he tells us, II collected more than\na hundred first-hand cases of apparitions closely coinciding with the\ntime of death of the person seen; and it is only in a. sma.ll minority of\nsuch cases that our informants, according to their own account, ha.ve\nhad any other ha.llucination than the apparition in question.\" The\ngreat importance of this statement will be manifest to a.ll.\nIthas, however, been objected that the evidence brought forward\nby this Committee is 110 mixture of the strong and the weak ; and some\nhave even hinted that the effective strength of such eridence is that of\nthe weakest portions of it. As I know from experience that this\nmixed character is 110 stumbling block to many, I will take the present\nopportunity of repeating what cannot be too widely known-that the\nLiterary Committee are themselves very well a\\Vare of this difference\nbetween the various items of evidence which they have brought\ntogether. Some of these are regarded by them as peculiarly of an\nevidentialna.ture adapted to force conviction into the minds of those who\nare sceptica.l. Other items again, while deficient in this respect, may yet\nbe of importance in bringing out the laws which regulate these strange\nphenomena.. For example, the question, Do apparitions of the dying\nactually occur 7 is to be replied to by quoting evidence of one kind\nwhile the question as to the exact meaning of these appearances, and\ntheirpossible relation to telepathy, is to be replied to by evidence of\nanother kind less important, perhaps, in its value as regards those who\nare unconvinced. Similar rules apply to all branches of knowledge.\nThe thanks of our Society are due to Mr. Myers for the pains he\nhas taken in classifying the various items, aud it is, indeed, abundantly\nobvious that without such 110 preliminary process the full value of the\nevidence could not possibly become known.\nI have dwelt at some length on this subject because of its import-\nance, and because the public are, perhaps, apt to attach too exclusive a.\nvalue to the experimental part of our work. I have fully recognised\nthe claima of the experimental part; we need in it far wider assistance\n-especia.lly in the way of systematic trials of thought-transference in\nprivate-than we have yet received. But none the less, I think, must\nthe codification of the current evidence be looked upon as a pressing\nand paramount duty.\n5' 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f68 PreBidlnt', .A.ddre88. [April 24,\nWe may be told in the kindest manner that there are regions which\nit is utterly hopeless to approach-groups of recurrent phenomena so\nwrapped about with the garments of confusion that we cannot possibly\ndisentangle them so as to find whether there is anything new in them\nor not.\nOur reply to such remarks should not be doubtful. It ought, I\nimagine, to consist in a prompt refusal to believe in the existence of\nany such region or of any such phenomena. Is it not at once the\nprivilege and the duty of the human intellect to gain, as time goes on, a.\nclearer and still clearer insight into the principles which underlie 0.11\nterrestrial occurrences 7 The ultimate explanation of certain classes of\nthese may, no doubt, be different from what we imagined on our setting\nout. This, however, is not the question.\nThe point is, rather, whether there exist around us groups of recur-\nrent terrestrial phenomena which it is utterly hopeless to grapple with.\nSurely there is only one proper way of replying to this suggestion, and\nthat is by making the attempt. Everything is possible to courage and\nprudence, coupled with perseverance. Such qualities will enable us to\novercome the preliminary Dragon which guards the entrance to these\ninteres~ regions, and our united efforts will ultimately result in\nobtaining for us the golden apples of truth.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] PnantaItM of tn, DIad. 69\nIII.\nNOTES ON THE EVIDENOE, COLLECTED BY THE SOOIETY,\nFOR PHANTASMS OF THE DEAD.\nBy MBa. H. SIDGWICl[.\nIn the following paper I propose to consider the evidence which the\nSociety has hitherto collected for Phantasms of the Dead, including\nunder this term all kinds of impressions on human minds which there\nseems any reason to refer to the action, in some way or other, of deceased\npersons.\u00b7\nMost of those to whom this paper is addressed probably belong to\nsome Christian denomination, and to them the continued existence\nof the soul after death is, of course, no new theory invented to\naccount for such phenomena as we are discussing, or requiring such\nphenomena to support it. But few will have any difficulty in agreeing\nwith me that (I) the possibility of receiving communications from the\ndead, here and now, would not follow as a necessary consequence from\nthe immortality of the soul; (2) that if communication of what I\nmay call an objective kind-distinguishable, I mean, from our own\nthoughts and emotions-is possible to all those of the departed\nwho desire it, we should naturally expect it to occur more fre-\nquently than the most sanguine can suppose that it actually does;\nand (3) that its possibility, while not in contradiction with any\nof the known facts of physical science, is certainly not supported,\nor in any way suggested, by any of these facts. However firmly,\ntherefore, we may believe in the continued existence of dead\nhuman beings. we cannot regard the supposition of their action on the\nminds of the living as if it were merely the reference of an effect to a.\n17era MUla known to be adequate to produce it. We must treat it as\nwe should treat the hypothesis, in any department of physical\ninvestigation, of an entirely new agent, for the existence of which we\nhave no evidence outside the phenomenon which it is introduced to\nexplain. If this be so, it will, I think, be admitted that we should be\nviolating an established rule of scientific method if we introduced such\n\u2022 This evidence does not of C01llll8 include appearances at the moment or\ndeath, or a few ho1ll'll afterwards, since these, &8 my readers will remember,\nhave been classed with Phantasms of the Living.\nDigitized by Google\n\f70 [April 24,\na hypothesis except in the last resort, when all other modes of\nexplanation seem clearly to fall.\nExactly at what point of improbability this failure of other\nexplanations is to be regarded as established, cannot, I think, be\ndefined-at any rate, I feel quite unable to define it. But I may per-\nhaps say that, in my opinion, it is a point which can hardly be reached\nin the case of any narrative of a single event considered by itself: if\nwe had only a single ghoswtory to deal with, I can hardly conceive the\nkind or amount of evidence which would lead me to prefer the\nhypothesis of ghostly agency to all other possible explanations. The\nexistence, therefore, of phantasms of the dead can only be established, if\nat all, by the accumulation of improbabilities in which we become\ninvolved by rejecting a large mass of apparently strong testimony to\nfacts which, as recounted, would seem to admit of no other satisfactory\nexplanation: and in testing the value of this testimony we are bound,\nI think, to strain to the utmost all possible suppositions of recognised\ncauses, before we can regard the narrative in question as even tending\nto prove the Gperation of this novel agency.\nOf course, if its operation should ever be rationally established,\nby the cumulative process that I have described, it will then become\nreasonable to reconsider our evidence from the new point of view thus\nreached ; and to refer to this cause, when once proved to exist, many of\nthe phenomena which, in the first instance, it was right to put aside\nas otherwise explicable. I have made these preliminary remarks,\nlest the explanations I shall endeavour to apply to some of the cases\nbefore us should seem unreasonably far-fetched to such of my readers\nas may already believe in phantasms of the dead, or are trembling on\nthe verge of belief.\nThe Society now possesses, as the residue of a much larger number, So\ncollection of about 370 narratives,-that seemed to deserve some con\u00b7\nsideration-of phenomena, not clearly physical, and which believers in\nghosts would be apt to refer to the agency of deceased human beings.\nThese narratives are printed on slips for consideration and criticism,\nand they constitute, probably, a fairly representative collection\nof the kind of evidence that we are likely to obtain on the\nsubject.\nI shall not, of course, attempt here to go through each case in detail\nand explain my reasons for the view I have formed about it, but shall\nmerely give the general results of a careful examination of them, with\nsome examples. The slips themselves are at 14, Dean's Yard, open to\nthe inspection of any member of the Society ; and to anyone who is\nsufticiently interested in the question to wish to examine into it for\nthemselves, I could furnish, if desired, a list of the narratives classified\naccording to my view of them, for comparison withltbeir own results.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] Pkanta8m8 of tM Dead. 71\nIn the first partof thispaper I aba.ll explainand illustrate the different\ngrounds on which I think that the greater number of the cases in the\nSociety's collection should be set aside at the present stage of our inves-\ntigation, as having no important evidential force, for the purpose of\nproving the existence of phantasms of the dead. In the second part\nI shall examine the residue, consisting of some twenty-five* narratives,\nin detail, with a view of ascertaining what psychical theories, if any,\nthey seem to point to. This residue, though comparatively small and\nnot suggestive of any satisfactory view as to the conditions of com-\nmunication with the other world, nor, indeed, by any means conclusive\nas to the possibility of such communication, is still, in my opinion,\nquite sufficiently important to deserve serious consideration, and to\njustify the pains that have been taken in collecting and sifting it.\nThe possible non-ghostly explanations of what pass as ghostly pheno-\nmena may be conveniently classified with reference to the various sorts\nof error by which the evidence to such phenomena is liable to be\naffected. I should state these as (1) hoaxing, (2) exaggeration or\ninadequate description, (3) illusion, (4) mistaken identity, (5) ballucina.\ntion.\nI. To begin with hoaxing. Probably most sceptical persons, who\nhave not examined the evidence actually collected, would suppose that\nthis is likely to be a very fruitful source of fallacious n&lTll.tives, either\n(1) through the narrator hoaxing the collector, or (2) from his having\nhimself been made the victim of a practical joke. I think, however, that\nanyone who has read the evidence will at once discard the first of these\nalternatives, at any rate so far as the great mass of the first-hand\nnarratives is concerned.t In most of these cases enough is known of\nthe narrators to make it highly improbable that they are intentionally\ndeceiving the investigator; and even were this not so, the stories are\nmostly so tame and dull in comparison with the thrilling narratives\nwhich from time to time appear in the magazines, that I can hardly\nimagine a hoaxer feeling any pride in having got them accepted as\n\u2022 I purposely give the number vaguely because there is of course no clear\naDd unmistakable line betweenstories that should be placed in the first class and\nthoee that belong to the second. Dift'erent people would take dift'erent views of\nBOIDe of them, and I should myself probably estimate them slightly dift'erently at\ndift'erent times. Moreover, it is not impossible that further evidence may expose\nfatal weakuessee in one or two of those I have selected, and on the other hand\nit is probable that some of those which I have for the present set aside as in\nvarious ways insufficiently evidenced, may by additional evidence be raised into\ntile firat-elass.\ntIt should be observed thatthecollectioncontainsasmall numberofanonymous\nstories. printed, as I understand. ouly in the hope of obtaining further informa-\ntion about them through members of the Society who may see them. It is not\nimprobable that one or two of these may tum ont to be pure inventions.\nDigitized by Google\n\f72 Phantillsm8 of the Dead. [Apri124,\ngenuine. This last remark applies also, generally speaking, to the sup-\nposition tha.t the phenomena described are the result of practical jokes\nperpetrated on the narrator. I think, however, that there are a few\nwhich can plausibly be explained as the result of trickery. In some of\nthese, the ghost only does what, according to the narrative, would be\nclearly within the scope of human personation; and in one, though the\napparition can hardly have been a living being of any sort, the immo-\nbility and persistence of the figure, and the behaviour of one of the\nactol'8 in the scene seem to me to suggest a practical joke. But I do not\nthink that the number of cases in which this explanation is applicable\ncan be more than half-a-dozen-atlea.st if we excludethe narratives which\nI am disposed to set aside on other grounds.\nII. But it.is obvious that without the slightest:intention to deceive,\nthe stories may contain unintentional exaggeration, or may omit\nimportant details which would give us &. clue to some non-psychical\nexplanation. We have no means of excluding this possibility in any\ncase, and we can only form a judgment as to the probability of its\nhaving been realisod in the same way as we are constantly forming\njudgments in ordinary life. We know roughly in common life what\nsort of things we may believe on the testimony of any ordinarily truth\nful person, and what sort of things are liable to be forgotten, imagined,\nmisinterpreted, or badly observed; and the weight that we attach to\nwhat people tell us is in accordance with this knowledge.\nWe have, of course, to do the same thing :with \"ghost stories,\"\ntaking care, moreover, to allow full weight or the witness's state of\nmind at the time and other attendant circumstances. This is a general\nremark applying to all the narratives, but some rules for dealing with\nspecial classes of cases may, I think, be laid down under this head.\nAll stories at second-hand (and a fortiori those that are more re-\nmote) in which it is fundamentally important to know accurately\nthe details, should be regarded as of low value, so far as the evidence\ndirectly supplied by them is concerned; because it is well known that\nfew people can repeat quite accurately in detail what they have been\ntold, and because there is a special tendency to distortion in narratives\nof the kind we are dealing with (just as there is in scandalous stories),\nowing to the fact that certain elements of the story, in the present case\nthe marvellous ones, are usually more striking to the imagination, and\ntherefore more likely to remain in the memory than the qualifying\ncircumstances. Besides, no description can reproduce to the mind's\neye with certainty the actual scene--no description can include every\ndetail: the very best may be compared to a photograph-correct as far\nas it goes, but incomplete. And thus when the hearer repeats the story\n-unless he does it with absolute verbal accuracy-he is liable to\ndescribe &. mental :picture of the scene differing from the original in\nDigitized by Goo\n\flti85.] Pllantrum8 oj the Dead. 73\njust the details which would have enabled us to interpret the occurrence\ncorrectly. Hence, in my opinion, a second-hand story, even when\nreported by a good witness, can rarely' amount for us to more than this :\nthat in B's opinion A believed, .on good grounds, that he had seen a\nghost. This, if we have reason to respect the veracity and judgment\nof A and B, is doubtless an important fact, but it is less important than\nit would be if we could ourselves criticise the grounds on which A's\nconclusion was based, and could compare his axperience in detail with\nthat of others.\nOn somewhat similar grounds but little definite weight can be\nattached to stories which are told with too little care or detail to enable\nus to judge what reasons there were at the time for supposing the\nphenomenon described to be a \"psychical\" one. And, again, the value\nof a narrative diminishes steadily as the interval between the event and\nthe record of it increases-not only because the details fade owing to\ndefective memory, but because they are liahle to be confused and sup-\nplemented by subsequent suggestiOD& Hence it is much to be desired\nthat anyone who has what he regards as a \"psychical\" experience\nshould write it down at once with as much detail as possible.\nI may here observe that there are certain narratives where the\nnature of the phenomenon described seems to preclude the possibility of\nobtaining evidence of a \"psychical\" cause. For instance, we have\nseveral accounts of' horses being frightened in places supposed to be\nhaunted, where their riders or drivers see nothing. Horses are nervous\nanimals, and it is difficult to exhaust the possible causes of their alann.\nMoreover, they are good readers of both conscious and unconscious\nmuscular indications-otherwise what is called a good hand in a rider\nwould not be so important as it is-and thus nervousness of the horse's\nmaster, perhaps conscious of the reputation of the haunted spot, may\nsometimes be imparted to the horse. Even when it is a human being\nwho has a feeling of dread or horror, or of something being wrong, or of\nan unseen presence (a not unfrequent occurrence apparently in so\u00b7ca.lled\nhaunted houses), it is very difficult to obtain sufficient evidence that\nthis feeling was quite peculiar. One might, per\/tap8, be sure of it in\none's own case if one ever experienced it, but one could not expect to\nconvince other people.\nOn the whole, the evidence appears to me to be, at present, too weak,\nor otherwise seriously defective, on such grounds as I have been dis-\ncussing, in about one-third of the printed stories, which I, therefore, set\naside for the present. In those that remain we have to consider\nwhether any known physical explanations will apply, even, as I have\nsaid, with some straining.\nIII. Illusion, or misinterpretation of what is perceived by the\nsenses is an explanation, which is, perhaps, possible in a considerable\nDigitized by Google\n\f74 PIlanttmIUI of tll8 Dead. [April 24,\nnumber of cases. Most of us have experienced illusions in some degree\nthough usually if the misinterpreted phenomenon is of more than\nmomentary duration, we almost immediately correct our impressions.\nIt must, however, be noted that short-sighted people have to\ninterpret much smaller indications, and are consequently more\nliable to visual illusions than persons whose sight is good. This\nmakes it very important to know whether our witneBBes have good sight\nor not. I would venture to suggest to the Committee that somewhat\nmore information should, if poBBible, be obtained on this point.\nespecially as short sight and other defects of vision are, of course.\nextremely common. I am told by a short-sighted friend that illusions\nwill sometimes last with her till she is quite close to the misinterpreted\nobject, and that, owing to the blurring of the images, she is liable to be\nmistaken both as to the size and shape of what she sees-taking, for\ninstance, a man on the road in front of her for a man on a pony, or for\ntwo or three men walking close together abreast. In a bad light we\nare all somewhat in the position of short-sighted people, obliged to\ninfer from small indications what it is we see, and moreover some\npersons with good sight in ordinary light become short-sighted in a bad\nlight.\nOf course, in most cases, whether we are short-sighted or not, the\ntrue interpretation of what we see is ultimately forced upon us, but it is\neasy to imagine circumstances in which this would not happen, ana it is\nthen that what is really an ordinary natural phenomenon is liable to\nassume the appearance of inexplicable mystery.\nI do not think that our collection includes, among the narratives of\napparitions seen once by a single person, any that can be fairly explained\nas ocular illusions; but in examining the rarer cases of those seen by two\npersons together, or successively in the same place, I have found some\nin which this explanation seems admissible. Two persons seeing some-\nthing rather indistinctly from the same point of view may sometimes\nhelp each other to interpret it alike; and a figure frequently indistinctly\nseen in a particular spot, especially if in a particular light, may be due\nto some constantly recurring E'trect of light and shade, or arrangementof\ntrees or other objects, sufficiently like what it is taken for\u00b7 to deceive.\nPerhaps about 16 of the narratives may, with some straining, be\nexplained in this way. One or two specimens may be given. The\nollowing (G. 10)* is one:-\nIn 1845, my late husband, William Man TOWD88nd, and self, were\nresiding in a pretty cottage half-way between Thame and Aylesbury, had\n\u2022 The number in brackets appended to each story quoted, is its number\namong the ..

I\nhad done 80 before, but had to croll a landing, go through an empty room\ninto the room ourservant, a woman about 30 years old,was sleeping in, as we\nonly had one window that looked over that yard. I may say, we neither\nof us had any fear of anything and did not believe in ghosts, or anything of\nthat lOrt,and I preferred goingabout my own house in the dark to taking the\ntrouble of carrying a candle at any time, as I always knew where to find what\nI wanted.\nI called to my dear old dog, tried to soothehim, he answered with a whine,\nbutI heard his chain rattle as he went in, did as I told.him, and we heard no\n80und of him again.\nMyservant slept, did not know I had been in her room. I turned to go\nback to my own room and in paBIling the landing window just outside my own\ndoor I lifted the blind, always liking to look out into the sky ; it was, as I\nlaid, between 3 and 4:, and in October, and we had been having heavy\ndews at night, and it seemed a greyquiet IOrt of morning, no moon, no stars,\nall very still, yet I could see distinctly. We had a night-light burning and my\nhusband was Bitting up in bed. I had stayed \"t the back window looking out\nlOme time and thought what a strange lightit was, 10 I held the blind only a\nlittle on one side to get a better look at the front, but dropped it and started,\nmade an exclamation, and my husband heard me and asked what it was ; at\nfirst I did not answer, did not, in fact, choose to believe what I saw ; he\nIprang to the window, did just as I had done; we asked each other, what\ncan it be, or rather, who can it be.

I did not. Did he, I\nasked, or had he ever seen anyone at all like it 7 No. In speaking of it\nafterwards to each other, asyou may be sure we oftendid, we always called it\nScrooge, from Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol, so no one knew whom we\nmeant.

Once Mrs. Townsend was greatly startled by a tremendous crash, which\nMr. TOWDll8nd did not hearat all.]\nThirty-eight years seem to have elapsed after this experience before\nit was written down, and in that time the definiteness of the figure,\nand the exactness of correspondence between it and the old farmer may\nhave, perhaps, grown in recollection. Besides, considering what an\ninadequate thing a description is, exactness of correspondence such as\nis here meant can never come to very much. I suppose no one feels\nthat he could at once recognise an escaped burglar from the police\ndescription of him. All he would know would be that certain persons\nwere excluded by the description while certain others were not. But\nto go back to our ghost; some of its characteristics, namely, its being\nrooted to the spot and in a. fixed attitude, and its disappearance by ap-\nparently sinking into the ground, suggest an effect of light, e.g., of a\nrising or setting moon shining through the house on to a shrub or\nplant. If Mr. Townsend had but gone down to the garden as he\nwished, he would, doubtless, have ascertained definitely whether what\nis here suggested,or any other physical explanation, was or was not possi-\nble; and had the occurrence been recent, an examination of the house\nand garden might even yet have been worth making. But as the story\nstands, it can hardly be thought unreasonable to regard the above ex-\nplanation as more probable than any \"psychical\" one.\nI will here add a narrative (G. 117) of a kind quite unique in our\ncollection, and which I am inclined to think may be explained as a.\ncase of collective illusion, though, if so, the illusion was so remarkable\non account of its persistence and repetition, as almost to suggest a.\nborderland between illusion and hallucination.\nIt has been received directly from the elder of the two ladies who\nwitnessed the phenomenon; the younger sister has read it through and\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] P\"anta8m8 oj the Dead. 77\nappended a brief comment to the account. The maid cannot now be\ntraced.\n\" I daresay it is ten or twelve years since this happened. One night in\nNovember my sister C. and myself, with the maid, had been to evening\nservice in our village church. There was thick fog ; the moon was full, but\nit made a BOrt of steam in the fog, instead of shining brightly.\n\" As we walked we met a man : he was whistling, and we heard his whistle\nand his footsteps long before we saw him ; he passtld us on C.'s side, whistling\nstill. Shortly after he had gone, I was surprised to see another man at C.'a.\naide, who had come there without making a BOund; he was a much &horte\\'\nman than the first. C. apparently did not see him ; I was walking beside\nher, and I pulled her sleeve, whispering \u2022 Let that man pass.' C. was\nwalking on the outside of the three, next the carriage road. As I spoke, the\nman disappearEd-it seemed, into C.'s dreBB; neither C. nor the maid had\nseen him, and he had made no BOund. In another moment we were all\nbewildered at the sight around us; it was as if we were in a crowded street;\ninnumerable figures were round us; men, ,,'omen, children, and dogs, all\nwere moving briskly about, BOme singly, others in groups, all without &\nBOund; they appeared mist-like. There was a broad strip of grass on our\nright, and a narrow strip on our left; the figures were hidden directly they\ngot on either of these dark strips, or when thtly passed into ourselves; but\n&8 we walked on they came from every quarter. Some seemed to rise out of\nthe graBB on either side of us; others seemed to pass through us, and come\nout on the other side. The figures all seemed short, dwarf-like, except o'lte,\nof whom I write after. The women were dressed in bygone fashion, high\nbonnets, big cloaks or shawls, and large 1l0unces on their dreBBes, such as I\nremember my mother wearing when I was a child. We three were never\nmistaken as to the identity of the di1l'erent shapes; if one saw a man, aU\nsaw a man ; if one saw a woman, all\" saw the woman; and BO on. Over-\nhead it was perfectly free of them; they were all walking on the ground, as\nwe oUl\"lleh-es were. We saw two men (at di1l'erent intervals) that had sparks\nall round their faces; they appeared to grin. As we saw the second of\nthese, looking hideous, close to us, one of my companions said \u2022I can't pass\nthat,' and I answered, \u2022Look at the sky, you don't see them then.'\n\"There was one man taller than all the rest (he looked '!)ery tall), who\ntook great strides, though perfectly noiseleBB; he wore a kind of cape ; he\nwas the only one who walked beside us, and he was on the carriage road ;\nthe rest all went on in an aimleBB kind of way, losing themselves in thtt\ngr&BB, and BO on; but this one never changed his step or swerved.\n\" As we walked on, and he kept near us, we cast frightened glances at\nhim, and kept bidding each other in a whisper to look at him, though he\nnever turned his head to look towards us. ,,-e approached our own gate,\nwhere we should turn in, and then we had a long drive to walk up before we\nshould reach the house. I think that by the time we reached our gate all the\nfigures had disappeared except this one tall man. He had quite a di1l'erent\nlook to any of the others, looked more horrible altogether. Hia way of\nwalking was quite di1l'erent to the rest, and he was, I should think, twice as\ntall or more than any of the others. He looked as if he had a purpose ; the\nrest seemed quite di1l'erent.

The fact that the small figures disappeared\ndirectly they got on either of the dark strips of grass, affords, I think,\na strong reason for regarding them as illusions; for it is difficult to see\nwhy a hallucination, veridical or otherwise, should be affected so much\nby the background, while on the other hand, an illusion caused, as I have\nsuggested, by irregularities in the density of the fog, would depend on\nthe background almost entirely. If the phenomenon was really a\nCI psychical\" one it is peculiarly unlucky that the one fact of this kind,\nrecorded in a collection of 370 narratives, should have occurred in\na fog.\nSo far I have dealt only with visual illusions, but auditory illusions\nare, I think, commoner. We interpret sounds from smaller indications\nthan sights, and more mistakes are possible about them. If we see a\nfigure, we cannot be mistaken as to the direction in which we see it,\nand the relation to other objects, called in optics parallax, I:onstantly\nenables us to estimate its distance, and consequently its size. Whereas\nin sounds we may easily be wrong about direction, and as to distance,\nand consequently absolute loudness, we have, I think, no guide at all,\nunless we know independently what the source of sound is. Anyone\nmay experimentally verify this, if he will carefully observe his first\nuncorrected impressions as to the source of unexpected sounds. This\ndifficulty in the exact localisation of unknown sources of sounds is\na very serious obstacle to discovering their possible physical causes, and\nmakes it;, I think, on the whole, unwarrantable to assume that\nmysterious sounds not showing intelligence are physically inexplicable,\nmerely because not yet physically explained.\nThere are, however, three considerations, which, in a more legiti-\nmate way, suggest a CI psychical\" origin for such sounds, and though I\ndo not think that as at present exemplified in the collection before us,\nthese considerations are very weighty, it would he a mistake, in view of\nfurther investigations, to put them altogether out of court. (I) The\nsounds sometimes seem to show signs of intelligent agency, or of corre-\nspondence with external and physically independent circumstances. For\ninstance, raps seem to vary in answer to questionR asked, or the sounds\nare for the first time heard in seeming connection with a very recent\ndeath. We have not, I think, at present any very strong evidence for\n\f80 Pllanta8tn8 oj the Dead. [April 24,\nsuch psychical signs as these, but if the origin of the sounds be really\nnon-physical it is in this way that there is, probably, most likelihood of\nproving it.* (2) In houses where there seems to be good evidence for\nthe occurrence of visual apparitions, mysterious sounds also occur, and\nif it can be shown that sounds and sights have in these cases some\ncommon psychical origin, this will, of course, afford a primdjacie\nground for attributing similar sounds to a similar origin when they\noccur by themselves. (3) Many of the sounds in question appear to\nthose who hear them to resemble sounds usually made by human\nbeings, such as footsteps, rustling of dresses, moving of furniture over-\nhead, the crash of falling china, the smack of a whip on door or\nfurniture, raps and blows on walls and doors, cries, groans, sobs, sighs.\nwhisperings and inarticulate voices. I think, however, that little\nimportance can be attached to this consideration. For none of the\nsounds I ha.ve enumerated seem to mo at all unmistakable in character.\nFor instance, the chief characteristic of footsteps is their periodicity.\nAny recurring tap having about the same period might easily be\nmistaken for them, and if it gradually increased or diminished in loud-\nness it would suggest a person approaching or receding.t And again,\nit is well known that draughts of air under certain circumstances will\nproduce the illusion of whispering.\nIt is clear from our evidence that, in many cases, considerable\ntrouble has been taken to find any physical cause for the mysterious\nnoises without success-the inhabitants having often before them the.\nsceptic's favourite explanation of rats quite as clearly as we have. On\nthe other hand, obvious causes are no doubt sometimes over-looked, or\ntheir effect under-tlStimated. In one case, for instance, (312) we learn\nfrom the owner of a house that the partition-wall between it and\nthe next house, is probably not so completely impervious to sounds as\n\u2022 Careful observations on this point should be made by those residing in\nhouses where mysterious noises occur. It is satisfactory to know that this is\nbeing done by General Campbell, the narrator of No. 351, and we may hope for\nvaluable evidence from him.\nt In some caaes there seems good ground for thinking that sounds of this\nnature were correctly localised though unexplained. The following is an extract\nfrom a recent narration of experiences wMch occurred, unfortunately, 30\nyears ago. It has been shown to me by the Committee in manuscript, and has\nnot yet been printedamong the slips :-\" Almost every night I used to hear these\nfootsteps, and used sometimes to sit on the stairs holding the bannisters on each\nside with my hands. Nothing corporeal could have passed me; but the foot-\nsteps distinctly passed me. Two stairs in the bottom flight were in the habit\nof creaking when trodden upon; and when I heard the steps coming I used to\ncount, and the creak came always regularly on these two stairs. It was like a\nheavy unshod foot.\" In this case, and in others, the footsteps have sometimes\nbeen followed about the house.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] PnanttUmIJ oj tAe Dead. 81\nour informant, who had occupied the former house for some years,\nbelieved it to be.\nI do not give any specimen of these narratives of houses haunted\nby noises only, because one has already appeared in the Procuding.\nof the Society. (Part VI., p. 144.)*\nThere are, I think, about 30 of the stories which come under the\nhead of merely unexplained sounds, and about the same number\nwhere there is good evidence for unexplained sounds, and also evidence\nfor other phenomena, but where the latter evidence does not seem to\nme important for our present purpose. Here I should remark that\nevidence for the ghostly nature of other phenomena, e.g., apparitions,\nis not, in my view, materially strengthened by the fact that there are\nmysterious noises at the same time or place, because the existence of\nthe sounds, and the consequent idea that a house is haunted, may, for\naught we know, produce a state of mind conducive to hallucinations.\nIt is noticeable that in some accounts of haunted houses, the figure seen\nvaries with the seer, being seen a.t different times and places and,\nperhaps, only once by each person. For instance, in one narrative\n(168), one person is said to have seen a figure in white on the stairs;\nanother person,when in bed,a man in a shootingjacket; and a third, also\nin bed, a woman and a baby. Does not this suggest a casual combina-\ntion of dreams and either illusions or the merely subjective\nhallucinations of which I shall presently speak, to which importance\nwas attached because the house had already acquired a reputation of\nbeing haunted f I will give here,as an illustration, a case (G. 324) where\nthe evidence for the phenomena described seems very good, though\nthey occurred 32 years ago, and where it is, perhaps, possible\nthat real but unexplained sounds, resembling human footsteps, in some\nway caused a purely subjective hallucination:\nFrom Mrs. Watson (written by her daughter), 42, Old Elvet, Durham,\nFebruary 24th, 1884.\nI am writing at my mother's dictation, her recollection of the circum-\nstance which occurred at Armitage during the summer of 1852.

February, 1884.\nIt Us nearly 30 years since the following account was given to me, in the\nhouse where it occurred, by my sister, Mrs. Swann, who then resided in a de-\ntached house in the village of Armitage, in Staffordshire. The house is\nsurrounded by a garden having back as well as front entrance j the back\nentrance led into the kitchen, from whence a back stair, enclosed, led to the\nupper rooms. Mrs. Swann was alone in the kitchen engaged at a table\nstanding against the enclosure. No door opened, but she was startled by\nhearing the 80und of footsteps as of one ascending the enclosed stair. She\nimmediately opened the door at the foot of the stairs, and being broad day-\night saw a figure ascending, which she at Ol1ce recognised as that of her\nfather, who had been dead severnl years. She recognised the figUl'e by the\nhand placed behind, as was his custom when alive and walking ; and she\nrecognised the face when he turned at the top and looked back. On reach-\ning the top of the stairs the figure turned round, looked at her for a brief\nspace, then seemed to pass along the passage. Her husband and sister (now\nMrs. Watson) were in another part of the house, the dining-room; they\nboth heard the sound 88 of footstept', and, as by an impulse, b:>th quickly\nascended the front stairs, looked through the house, but saw nothing. I may\nadd that the occurrence took place just before Mrs. Watson's marriage, per-\nhaps two months or 80, and that I heard of it when I went to Armitage to\nperform the ceremony.

It may be asked, am I, or was I, superstitious 7 I say,\nNo, emphatically.\nTo conclude, and as I have several times aaid before, and as I again say,\nI gave a start, and said, Bleaa me 1 how can this be 7 not an optical delusion,\nnot it. What then 7 Nothing but a slight mystery, and I was confident I\ncould easily aolve it. Never was I more mistaken, for from that day to this\nI still remain in profound ignorance as to what was tho cause or meaning of\nwhat I saw.\nMr. F. A. Whaite, writing to Mr. Gurney from Whaite's Fine Art\nGallery, Bridge Street, Manchester, October 16th, 1883, says:-\n.. You ask Mr. Stone if he ever mentioned the circumstance mentioned in\nyour note of the 14th inat.\"(i.e., the above account.) \"Hedidnameitto\nme and my parents $e same day; and I believe it was the truth, for he was\n80 excited about it at the time.\"\nThis occurrence may, I think, be possibly accounted for by\nsupposing that the man our informant talked to was a living man, and\nthat he was mistaken as to which of his father's customers had died\nfour years before. This explanation may seem far-fetched, but any\nother, whether\" psychical\" or not, is very difficult. It clearly cannot\nhave been an illusion or a trick, and a hallucination or a ghost behaving\nas this one did-touched, heard, seen, and talked to for several minutes,\nin broad daylight, in a public street, and presumably seen by all the\npaasers-by-would be unique among the hallucinations and ghosts\nof our collections.\nV. I now come to the discussion of a more important and difficult\npart of the subject than any which has yet been before us-namely.\nhallucination. The difficulty which at once meets us arises from the\nfact that genuine phantasms of the dead such as we are discussing\nwould themselves generally take the form of hallucinations of the senses\n-that is, they would not (at least in my opinion, but I shall discuss\nthis question somewhat more fully further on) form part of the external\nphysical world o.round us. It is true that'ghosts are alleged sometimes\nto produce a physical effect on the external world; but this supposition\nopens up a new field of difficulty, since it rea.lly does bring us into\nprim4facie collison with the physical sciences; and on the whole it has\nseemed to me best to leave the small group of stories, in which\nphysical. as distinct from psychical, phenomena. are definitely alleged\nDigitized by Google\n\f86 Phanta8m8 of the Dead. [April 24,\nto have occurred, to be treated in connection with the records of\nphysical phenomena, reported to have been experimentally obtained at\nspiritualistic seances.\nThe phenomena with which the mass of the narratives are concerned\n-if we omit mere feelings and impressions to which I can attach little\nweight-are almost a.ll, at best, indistinguishable from ha.llucinations.\nThe question then is how are we to distinguish them from ha.llucinations\nwhich are not what is called veridical. !'here is nothing, so far as we at\npresent know, either in the phenomena themselves, or in the condition\nof the percipient, by which they may be distinguished. For careful\ninquiry shows that solitary, and seemingly non-veridical, ha.llucinations\nof persons whom there is no reason to think otherwise than healthy in\nbody and mind, do occur. Clearly, then, we should not be justified in\nassuming a hallucin..tion to be veridical without some special extema.l\nreason for doing so, or, in other words, some confirmatory coincidence.\nWhen the phantasm is that of a living person, information about that\nperson may aft'ord us the required reason. But in the case of phantasms\nof the dead, we are cut oft' from the possibility of any information about\nthe supposed agent, and are reduced to seek for some other kind of\nconfirmation. Several kinds of confirmation are possible, and of these\nfive seem to me to be more or leBB exemplified by the part of our present\ncollection to which I attach most importance.\nOf ha.llucinations without any such confirmation, we have, I\nthink, about forty, and about as many more where the confirmatory\nevidence required does not seem to me strong enough.\nThe first kind of confirmation which I will consider occurs when\ntwo people have a hallucination simultaneously. It certainly seemB\nin the highest degree improbable that two people should independently\nhave similar subjectively caused hallucinations; but for those who, like\nmyself, are disposed to regard tlwugkt-trans\/erence or telepatl~y as estab-\nlished, the fact that two persons apparently see the same apparition at\nthe same time, does not prove that it is extema.Ily caused in both cases.\nWe must admit the poBBibility that A. having a hallucination, may\nby thought-transference convey the impreBBion to B, and cause B to\nhave a ha.llucination too ; and even perhaps that A may cause a halluci-\nnation to B by some telepathically conveyed impreBBion, though his own\nmental disturbance does not extema.lise itself in the same way. At\nany rate we know as yet too little about ha.llucinations and the\nconditionsunder which they occur, to say that this cannot be so. These\nsuppositions may seem extravagant; but according to the general\nprinciple with which I started, it seems to me that I am bound to press\nthe hypothesis of telepathy as far as it will go, no less than the other\nhypotheses-exaggeration, illusion, mistaken identity, &c. And it should\nbe observed that it is not necessary to suppose that the two ha.llucina-\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] Phantasm& of the Dead. 87\ntions, even when believed to be similar, are so in every detail. No one\ntakes in every detail of an object seen, especially when seen for so short\na time as these hallucinations usually last, and A's description may\neasily seem to recall to B's mind points which he did not actually observe\nhimself, though he did not observe the contrary. The positive evidence\nin favour of this hypothesis is not as yet large in amount, or conclusive\nin quality. But there are cases among the collected narratives of\nphantasms of the living, which seem more easily explained on this h~\nthesis than on any other, and whichtherefore supportit as far as they go.\nFor example (L.1531) a lady tells us that her brother and his wife, both\nnow dead, once asked her whether she had been thinking of them in\nany special way on a certain night some months previously. It ap-\npeared that they had both seen her standing at the foot of their bed.\nShe could not remember anything on her part which suggested a cause\nfor this phenomenon. Another very interesting case of a similar kind\nwas printed in the Proceedings, Vol. I., p. 145. Then again there is a\ncurious story (L. 323) in which the:mother of a dying woman appears\nto the nurse at the bedside. There is no evidence of what our Com-\nmittee call \"agency\" on the part of the mother, and she was quite\nunknown to the percipient. It seems here plausible to suppose that\nthe sick person was in some way the agent causing the hallucination.\nthough we do not know what was her own experience at the time.\nIf this hypothesis, as to the nature of collective hallucinations, be\nregarded as tenable, then all the stories where there is no other ground\nfor assuming an external cause may possibly be cases of thought-\ntransference between living persons, and cannot be regarded as affording\narguments for the possibility of communication with the dead or of\napparitions directly connected with them. There are, I think, about\n20 such stories in the collection. 'lhe following may be given as a\nspecimen (G. 405, printed also as 610), the impression of the little\norphan's dream being supposed transferred to the warden. The story\nwas originally printed in July, 1883, in an account of the Orphanage\nwhere it occurred, entitled \"The Orphanage and Home, Aberlour,\nCraigellachie,\" &c. (pp. 44, 45), and we have since obtained confirmation\nof it from the Warden.\nIn 1875, a man died leaving a widow and six orphan children. The three\neldest were admitted into the Orphanage. Three years afterwards the widow\ndied, and friends succeeded in getting funds to send the rest here, the\nyoungest being about four years of age. At this time the Orphanage con-\ntained nearly 30 inmates,for the smaller ones of whom the Warden did every-\nthing that was required. There was not a spare room in the house, and\nvisitors to the Orphanage had to be lodged in the parsonage. About six\nmonths after the arrival of the younger children referred to above, two\nvisitors uuexpectedly arrived late in the evening-too la.te to get a. bed aired\nDigitized by Goo\n\f88 Phantasms if the Dead. [April 24,\nat the parsonage; it was therefore arranged that they should have the\nWarden's room, he agreeing to take a bed in the little ones' dormitory,\nwhich contained 10 beds, nine occupied. No other change except this was\nmade in the usual order of things.\nIn the morning, at breakfast, the Warden made the following state-\nment :-As near as I can tell I fell asleep about 11 o'clock, and slept very\nsoundly for some time. I suddenly woke without any apparent reason, and\nfelt an impulse to turn round, my face being towards the wall, from the\nchildren. Beforo turning, I looked up and saw a soft light in the room.\nThe gas was burnmg low in the hall, and the dormitory door being open, I\nthought it probable that the light came from that source. It was soon\nevident, however, that such was not the case. I turned round, and then a\nwonderful vision met my gaze. Over the second bed from mine, and on\nthe same side of the room, there was floating a small cloud of light, forming\na halo of the brightnesa of the moon on an ordinary moonlight night.\nI sat upright in bed, looked at this strange appearance, took up my watch\nand found the hands pointing to five minutes to 1. Everything was quiet,\nand all the children sleeping soundly. In the bed, over which the light\nseemed to float, slept the youngest of the six children mentioned above.\nI asked myself, .. Am I dreaming 1\" No! I was wide awake. I was\nseized with a strong impulse to rise and touch the substance, or whatever it\nmight be (for it was about five feet high), and was getting up when something\nseemed to hold me back. I am certain I hoard nothing, yet I felt and per-\nfectly understood the words-\" No, lie down, it won't hurt you.\" I at once\ndid what I felt I was told to do. I fell asleep shortly afterwards and rose at\nhalf-past 5, that being my usual time.\nAt G o'clock I began dressing the children, beginning at the bed\nfurthest from the one in which 1 slept. Presently I came to the bed over\nwhich I had seen the light hovering. I took the little boy out, placed him on\nmy knee, and put on some of his clothes. The child had been talking with\nthe others, suddenly he was silent. And then, lookin~ me hard in the face\nwith an extraordinary expreBllion, he said, .. Oh, Mr. J upp, my mother came\nto me last night. Did you see her 1\" For a moment I could not answer\nthe child. I then thought it better to paas it off, and said, \" Come, we must\nmake haste, or we shall be late for breakfast.\"\nThe child never afterwards referred to the matter, we are told, nor has\nit since ever been mentioned to him. The Warden says it is a mystery to\nhim ; he simply states the fact and there leaves the matter, being perfectly\nsatisfied that be was mistaken in no one particular.\nLetter from Mias Venning.\nBritish Museum,\n4th November.\nMy friend, Mr. Farrer, Rector of Bigbury, Kingsbridge, vouches for the\ntruth of the story.

It\nwas dusk ; and wh8;Jl half-way up the first flight of stairs, I distinctly felt a.\npreuure and a rustling of a dress at my side as if a woman had brushed past\nme. There was no one there. On the second flight the preuure was\nrepeated, but more unmistakably. The occurrence made me so nervous\nthat, having put the bOy to bed, I decided to remain with him until my\nhusband came in. I accordingly lay down on the bed, facing him.\nSuddenly the boy started up. \"Oh, mother, there is a lady standing\nbehind you,\" at the same moment I felt a preasure which I knew to be that\nof my friend. I dared not look round.\nWhen my husband returned, I heard from him for the first time that my\nfriend had died three days before.\nIn the above two cases the percipients had simultaneous, but nol;\nsimilar impressions.

I took an opportunity, when my younger\nsister and I were alone, to &8k her whatthat was that ahe and Lizzie had seen.\nShe said ahe was awoke by a feeling of oppre88ion, as though ahe\n~ould not breathe, and on opening her eyes, in the dim light of the room\n(the blind was down, but there was a gas lamp in front of the house, which\ngave some light to the room), she saw a veiled figure bending over Lizzie,\nand ahe put her arm round her, &8 she thought it had come to take her away.\nMy father and his family shortly after moved into another house, my\nsisters still occupyu.g a room togp.ther.

Sometimes simply the\nfact of the death is learnt from the phantasm, as in the following case,\nwhere the hallucina.tion is auditory (G. 357). It was received by the\nCommittee from the Rev. C. C.

Itis not easyto imagine any reason for this-anyreason\nwhy the supposed agent should intentionally or unintentionally impress\nthe percipient at that moment rather than another, or why the perci-\npient should be at that moment peculiarly impressible. And yet, if the\nDigitized by Google\n\f92 PhanttUfM of the Dead. [April 24,\ncoincidence be due to chance only, it is curious the.t we should have two\ncases of it among so few. It is, perhaps, possible that the immediate\nreceipt of the news may have caused the apparition to assume in\nmemory a definiteness wbich it had not in reality, though, if recognition\nbe distinctly recollected, it would be rather a strange trick for memory\nto play; and lIr. Tandy tells us that in his case his recognition of\nCanon Robinson-an intimate friend-was very definite indeed.\nAnother case of an apparition of a dead person whose death was\nunknown to the percipient is the following (G. 417), which has not\nyet been printed. The writer is Colonel ---, a well-known Irish\ngentleman, but we are not allowed to publish his name. He writes\nfrom Arthur's on March 1st, 1885 :-\nSome 16 years since Mrs. -- said to me, \"We have some people\nstaying here all next week. Do you know any person I could get to sing\nwith the girls 'I\" I suggested that my gunmaker, Mr. X., bad a daughter\nwith a fino voice, who was training as a public singer, and that if she, ?tlrs.\n--, liked I would write to X. and ask if he would allow her to come down\nand spend a week with us. On my wife's approval I wrote, and Miss X.\ncame down for a week, and then left. As far as I know, Mrs. -- never saw\nheragain. Shortly after I called on X., thanked him for allowing his daughter\nto come to us, and said we were all much pleased with her. X. replied: \"I\nfear you have spoilt her, for she says she never passed 10 happy a week in her\nlife.\" Miss X. did not come out as a singer, but shortly after married Mr.\nZ., and none of us ever saw her again.\nSix or seven years passed away, and Mra. --, who bad been long ill,\nwas dying, in fact ahe did die the following day. 1 was sitting at the foot of\nher bed talking over some busineBB matters that she was anxious to arrange,\nbeing perfectly composed and in thorough po8B688ion of her sell8ea ; in fact\nshe was right, and my solicitor, who advised that the step she wanted to be\ntaken was not neceasary, was wrong. She changed the aubject and said:\n., Do you hear those voicea ainging 1\" 1 replied that I did not; and she\nsaid: \"I have heard them several times to-day, and I am sure they are the\nangela welcoming me to Heaven; but,\" she added, \"it is atrange, there ia\nonevoice amongat them I am sure I know, and cannot remember whose voice\nit is.\" Suddenly she atopped and said, pointing straight over my head,\n\" Why there she is in the comer of the room; it is Julia X. ; she is coming\non ; she is leaning over you ; ahe bas her hands up ; ahe is praying; do\nlook ; she is going.\" I turned but could see nothing. Mrs. -- then said,\n\"She is gone.\" All theae thinga I imagined to be the phantasiea of a dying\nperson.\nTwo days afterwards, taking up the Times newspaper, I saw recorded\nthe death of Julia Z., wife of Mr. Z. I was so astounded that in a day or\n80 after the funeral I went up to -- and asked Mr. X. if Mrs. Z., biB\ndaughter, was dead. He said, \"Yea, poor thing, ahe died of puerperal\nfever. On the day ahe died she began singing in the moming, and sang and\nu.ng until she died.\"\nLast year I saw mentioned that lome person or persoll8 were collecting\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] PhanUum& of the Dead. 93\nremarkable ghoat atories, and I wrote to Mr. Z.,- telling him shortly what I\nhave now written at length.

Unfortunately\nI was obliged to leave London, and have never seenMI-.

Cases like this one, in sufficient numbers,\nwould, of course, go a. long way towards\u00b7 proving it, at any rate if it\ncould be shown that dying persons do-not, under similar circumstances,\nsee apparitions of persons alive and well at the time.\nThe apparition described in the following narrative (G. 32), abridged\nfrom Temple Bar for December, 1882, conveys information of a different\nkind. The writer is the Rev. Gerrard Lewis, of st. Paul's Vicarage,\nllargate, who, in a letter to Mr. Podmore, dated December 30th, 1882,\nsays:-\nI have nothing to add to my \" truo ghost story\" in Temple Bar. I ahould\nnot like theyoung man'a name to be published, but will give it you in confi-\ndence. As to dates, he died on Thursday, September 19th, 1866. I saw\nhiaappea.rance on Sunday, September 22nd, and officiated at his funeral on\nWedneaday, September 25th.\nMy wife's mother had in her service a coachman named P., with one aon,\nJames Henry P., who had been brought up by friends at a diatance, and was\napprenticed to a trade in London. His father had only twice casually\nmentioned him to me, and he had almost entirely slipped out of my mind,\nfor, with a large aeaaide pariah on my hands, of which I was curate, my time\nand attention were fully taken up with matters nearer home. I mention\nthis, leat in the course of the following story my readers should chance to\nthink that a deep impression, previously made on my own mind, had pre-\ndiapoaed me to see what I saw, and afterwards to regard it in a supernatural\nlight. I cannot, therefore, too emphatically repeat that I knew next to\nDigitized by Google\n\f94 Phantasms of tile Dead.

I had to p8.111 the hoUle of P. I remarked indeed\nthat all his window blinds were drawn carefully down, aa if to screen his\nfurniture, of which his wife waa inordinately proud, from the despoiling blaze\nof the afternoon sun. I Imiled inwardly at the thought. I then left the\nroad, stepped on to the aide pavement, and looked over the area rails, into\nthe front court below. A young man, dreaaed in dark clothes, and without\na hat, and apparently about 20 years of age, waa standing at the door beneath\nthe front stePI. On the instant, from hill liken811 to my friend P., Ieemed\nto recognise his IOn. We both stood and looked very hard at each other.\nSuddenly, however, he advanced to that part of the area which waa imme-\ndiately below where J waa standing, fixed on me a wide, dilated, winkl811\nIOrt of stare, and halted. The delire to speak waa evidently legible on hill\nface, though nothing audible escaped from his lips. But his eyes lpoke;\nevery feature in hill countenance lpoke, spoke, as it were, a silent language,\nin which reproach and pain seemed equally intermingled. At first I waa\nstartled; then I began to feel angry. \"Why,\" I aaid to myself, \"does he\nlook at me in that manner 1\" At laet, annoyance prevailing over surprile,\nI turned away with the half-muttered thought: \"He certainly knows me by\nsight aa a friend of his father, and yet haa not the civility to salute me. I\nwill call on the first opportunity and aak his reason for such behaviour.\" 1\nthen pursued my way and thought no more of what had just occurred.\nOn Wednesday it was my turn to officiate at the local cemetery. On\nmy aaking who was to be buried, I was told that it waa a young man from\nmy quarter of the town, who had died of consumption. I cannot give\" the\nreason, but immediately I felt startled and ill at ease. It was not that I\nhad the least suspicion that anything extraordinary waa about to happen. I\nhad quite forgotten young P. The feeling which I think waa uppermost in\nmy mind waa annoyance at the fact that anyone should have died of such a\nslow disease in my parish, but without my knowledge. I asked without\ndelay for the registrar's certificate. My eyes fell 011 the words, \"James\nHenry P., aged 21 years.\" I could scarcely believe my own senses.\nI lost but little time before calling on P. and his wife. I found the\nlatter at home, and what ahe had to lILy only made me more uncomfortable\nstill. James Henry P: bore such a close resemblance to his father that all\nwho IILW him remarked on the striking likeneB8. In addition to thill, during\nthe laat three months of hill life, which he spent under hill father's roof, he\nhad often wondered that I did not come to see him. His longing for an\ninterview with me had been JOost intense; and every time he IILW me pass\nthe house without going in he had both felt and expr8lled a keen dillLp-\npointment. In fact, he died terribly in earnest, wishing in vain to the last\nthat I would come. That thought pierced me through and through. I had\nnot gone to him but he had come to me. And yet I would have gone, if I\nhad but known. I blame the doctor for not telling me; I blame the\nparents for not sending for me; and with that awful look he gave me in my\nremembrance, I blame myself, though I cannot tell why.\nDigitized by Google\n\f188b.J Phanta8m8 0\/ the Dead. 95\nJames Henry P. had died on the ThlU'llday before the Sunday on which I\nhad seen him. He had died, too, in the front room, on a level with the\narea, into which its window opened. He had also lain there till the Wed-\nnesday following, awaiting burial. His corpse then was lying in that very\nroom on that very Sunday, and at the very moment, too, when I had seen\nhis living likeness, as it were, in the area outside. Nobody, I found, had\npassed through the area that day ; the door there had been locked and\nunused all the Sunday. The very milkman, the only person who called, had\ncome by the front steps to the house; and P. and his wife were the only\ninmates at the time.\nThe fact pretty definitely communicated in this case by the\napparition, was the young man's longing, before his death, to see the\npercipient.\nMr. Podmore has recently seen Mr. Lewis, and also Mrs. Lewis, who\nheard of the experience at the time, and confirms all that Mr. Lewis\nsays. Mr. Lewis maintains that the likeness of the apparition to the\nelder P. was unmistakable, but there seem to be differences of\nopinion as to the degree of resemblance between the young man and\nhis father. Mr. Podmore has also seen the outside of the house, and.\nafter talking it all over he does not think it likely that it was a real\nman that Mr. Lewis saw. Another explanation had occurred to me.\nnamely, that the apparition was due, not to the agency of the\ndead man, but to that of old P., or his wife, whose thought of\nthe son in connection with Mr. Lewis would be intensified by seemg\nhim pass. Some little evidence, apart from this narrative, suggesting\nthe possibility of such an explanation could be adduced, and as the\nblinds of the house are Venetian, a person inside might have seen\nthrough them without being seen. But Mr. Lewis does not think it at\nall likely that the P.'s did see him, as Mrs. P. expressed some surprise\nwhen he told her, after the funeral, that he had passed on that day.\nMr. Lewis has had no other visual hallucination, veridical or other-\nwise.\nIn the case I shall next consider, the information is given in a.\ndream, and as has beenoften said, the evidence afforded by dreams must\nalways be very inferior to that afforded by waking experiences, because\nof the immflllse frequency of dreams, and the large proportioll of them\nwhich are obviously unveridica.l. In the case before us, however, there\nis apparently some coincidence between the dream and the facts in two\nunlikely and independent points. Mr. D., the na.rrator, does llot wish\nhis name to be published, but Mr. Gurney has seen hilJl, and talked\nover the subject with him. He narrates as follows (G. 406) ;-\nI am the owner of a very old mechanical business in Glasgow, with for 20\nyears past a branch in London, where I have resided for that period, and in\nboth of which places my professional reputation is of the highest order.\nDigitized by Google\n\fPltanfasms of the Dead. [April 24,\nSome 35 years ago I took into my employment a tender, delicate-looking\nboy, Robert Mackenzie,who, after some three or four years' service, suddenly\nleft, as I found out afterwards, through the selfish advice of older hands, who\npractised this frightening away systematically to keep wages from being\nlowered, a common device, I believe,among workmen in limited trades. Pasa\u00b7\ning the gate of the great workhouse (&ottid poorhouse) in the Parliamentary\nRoad. afew years afterwards,my eye W8.11 caught by a youth of some 18 years of\nage ravenously devouring a piece of dry bread on the public street. and bearing\nall the appearance of being in a chronic state of starvation. Fancying I\nknew his fentures, I asked if his name wero not Mackenzie. He at once\nbecame much excited, addressed me by name, and informed me that he had\nno employment; that his father and mother, who formerly supported him,\nwere now both inmates of the\" poorhouse,\" to which he himself had no claim\nfor admission, being young and without any bodily disqualification for work,\nand that he was literally homeless and starving. The matron, he informed\nme, gave him daily a piece of dry bread, but durst not, under the rules, give\nhim regular maintenance. In an agony of grief he deplored his ever leaving\nme under evil advice, and on my unexpectedly offering to take him back he\nburst into a transport of thanks, such as I cannot dellcribe. Suffice it to say\nthat he resumed his work, and that, under the circumstances, I did every-\nthing in my power to facilitate his progress. All this was mere matter of\ncourse; but the distinction between it and the common relations of master\nand servant was this, that on every occasion of my entering the workshop he\nnever, so far as possible, took off his eyes from following my movements.\nLet me look towards him at any moment, there was the pale, sympathetic\nface with the large and wistful eyes, literally yearning towards me as Smike's\ndid towards Nicholas Nickleby. I seemed to be \", the 'polar star of his\nexistence,\" and this intensity of gratitude never appeared to lessen in\ndegree through lapse of time. Beyond this he never: venturcd to express\nhis feelings. His manhood, as it were, his.individuality and self-asaertion,\nBeemed to have been crushed out of him by privations. I was apparently\nhis sole thought and consideration, saving the more common concerns of\ndaily life.\nIn 1862 I settled in London, and have never been in Glasgow since.\nRobert Mackenzie, and my workmen generally, gradually lost their\nindividuality in my recollection. About 10 to 12 years ago my employes\nhad their annualsoirOe and ball. This was always held, year after year, on\na Friday evening. Mackenzie, ever shy and distant, as usual, refused to\nmingle in the festivities, and begged of my foreman to be permitted to serve\nat the buffct. All went off well, and the Saturday was held (more workmen)\nas a succeeding day of festival. All this, however, I only learned after what\nI am now about to relate. On the Tuesday morning following, immediately\nbefore 8 a.m., in my house on Campden Hill, I had the following manifesta-\ntion, I cannot call it a dream; but let me use the common phraaeology. I\ndreamt, but with no vagueness as in common dreams, no blurring of outline\nor rapid passages from one thing disconnectedly to another, that I was seated\nat a desk, engaged in a business conversation with an unknown gentleman,\nwho stood on my right hand. Towards me, in front, advanced Robert\nMackenzie, and, feeling annoyed, I addressed him with some asperity,\n\f1885.J PlulIItusma of tl,e Dead. 97\nasking him if he did n\u2022\u2022t see that I was engaged. He retired a short distance\nwith exceeding reluctance, turned again to approach me, as if most desirous\nfor an immediate colloquy, when I spoke to him still more sharply as to his\nwant ofmanners. On this, the person with whom I was conversing took\nhis leave, and Mackenzie once more came forward. \"What is all this,\nRobert I\" I asked, somewhat angrily. \"Did you not see I was engaged? \"\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied; \"but I must speak with you at once.\" \"What\nabout?\" I said; \"what is it that can be 80 important 1\" \" I wish to tell\nyou, sir,\" he answered, ., that I am accused of doing a thing I did not do,\nand that I want ?!fI\" to know it, and to tell you 110, and th\"t you are to\nforgive me for what I am blamed for, because I am innocent.\" Then,\" I\ndid not do the tlllng they say 1 did.\" I said, \u2022\u2022 What ?\" getting sameanswer.\nI then naturally asked, \"But llow can I fOnP-ve you if you do not tell me\nwhat you are accused of 1\" I can never forget the emphatic manner of his\nanswer, in the Scottish dialect, .. Ye'll sune ken\" (you'll lOOn know). Thia\nquestion and the answer were repeated at least twice-I am certain the\nanswer was repeated thrice, in the most fen\u00b7id tone. On that I awoke, and\nwas in that state of surprise and bewilderment which such a remarkable\ndream, qud mere dream, might induce, and was wondering what it all meant,\nwhen my wife burst into my bedroom, lUuch excited, and holding an open\nletter in her hand, exclaimed, .. Oh, James, here's a terrible end to the\nworkmen's ball, Robert Mackenzie has committed suicide!\" With now a.\nfull conviction of t,he meaning of the vision, I at once quietly and firmly said\u2022\n.. No, he has not committed suicide.\" \"How can you possibly know that?\"\n.. Because he has just been here to tell me.\"\nI have purposely not mentioned' in its proper place, so as not to break\nthe narrative, that on looking at Mackenzie I was struck by the peculiar\nappearance of his counteuance. It was of an indescribable bluish-pale\ncolour, and on his forehead appeared spots which seemed like blots of sweat.\nFor this I could not account, but by the following post my manager informed\nme that he was wrong in writing me IJf suicide. That, on Saturday nigh~\n:Mackenzie, on going home, had lifted a small black bottle containing aqlUl\nforti. (wlllch he used for staining the woOd of birdcages, made for amuse-\nment), believing this to be whisky, and pouring out a wineglassful, had drunk\nit off at a gulp, dying on the Sunday in great agony. Here, then, was the\nsolution of his being innocent of what he was accused of-suicide, seeing\nthat he had inadvertently drunk aqlwfortil, a deadly poison. Still pondering\nupon the peculiar colour of his countenance, it struck me to consultlOme\nauthorities on the symptoms of poisoning by aqua fctrlil, and in Mr. J. H.\nWalsh's\" Domestic Medicine and Surgery,\" p. 172, I found these words\nunder symptoms of poiloning by sulphuric acid. . \"the skin\ncovered with a cold Iweat; countenance livid and expressive of dreadful\nluffering.\". \u2022 \"AqlW fortis produces the same effect as\nsulphuric, the only difference being that the externalstaius, if any, are yellow\ninltead of brown.\" This refers to indication of sulphuric acid, \"generally\noutside of the mouth, in the shape of brown spots.\" Having no deslre to\naccommodate my facts to this scientific description, I give the quotations\nfreely, ouly, at the same time, ltating that previously to reading the passage\nin Mr. Walsh's book, I had not the slightest knowledge of these symlltoms.\nH\nDigitized by Google\n\f98 Phal1ta8ms oj tile Dead. [AprilU,\nand I consider that they agree fairly and sufficiently with what I saw, viz.,\na livid face covered with a remarkable sweat, and having spots (particularly\non the forehead), which, in my dream, I thought great bIota of perspiration.\nIt seems not a little striking that I bad no previous knowledge of these\nsymptoms, and yet should take note of them.\nI have little remark to make beyond this, that, in speaking of this matter,\nto me very affecting and solemn, I have been quite disgusted by sceptics\ntreating it as a hallucination, in so far as that my dream must have been on\nthe Wednesday morning, being that after the receipt of my manager's letter\ninforming me of the supposed suicide. This explanation is too absurd tu\nrequire a serious answer. My manager first heard of the death on the\nMonday -wrote me on that day as above-and on the Tuesday wrote again\nexplaining the true facts. The dream was on the Tuesday morning, imme-\ndiately before the 8 a.m. post delivery, hence the tllrice emphatic \"Ye'll\nsune ken.\" I attribute the whole to Mackenzie's yeanling gratitude for\nbeing rescued from a deplorable state of starvation, and his earnest desire to\nstand well in my opinion. I have coloured nothing, and leave my readera\nto draw their own conclusions.\nD.\nThe following is Mrs. D.'s corl'ohoration :-\nIn regard to the remarkable dream my husband had when Robert\nMackenzie's death took place through inadvertently drinking some aq'l(J\nJorti3, I beg to inform you of what took place as far as I am concerned.\nOn the Tuesday morning after the occurrence, I was downstairs early,\nand at 8 o'clock was handed a letter, just received from the postman, and\naddre88ed to Mr. D. Seeing it was from our manager in Glasgow, I opened\nit, and was much grieved to find that it was to tell us that Robert Mackenzie\nbad committed suicide. I ran upstairs to Mr. D.'s bedroom with the letter\nin my hand, and in much excitement. I found him apparently justcoming\nout of sleep, and hastily cried out to him, exactly as he has described to\nyou. I need not go over the words, which have often been repeated amongst\nus since, and I can confirm his narrative regarding them, &8 given to you, in\nevery particular. The whole affair gave us a great shock, and put an end to\nthe workmen's ball. for some four or five years. Mr. D.'s dream was a\nfrequent subject of conversation at the time. I knew Mackenzie ,,\u00b7ell. He\nwas a pale, large-eyed, and earnest-looking young maIl, with a great regard\nfor Mr. D., through circumstances. The next day's post brought us the\nactual facts.\nJ. D.\nThe two points of coincidence here are the fact that Mackenzie was\naccused of something wrongly, and a certain degree of resemblance\nbetween his appearance in the dream and his appearance as, according\nto Walsh's \"Domestic Medicine,\" it should have been, after taking the\npoison which killed him. The coincidence is certainly curious, though\nit wight, of course, have been stronger. It would be very interesting\nto know-though at this distance of time impossible, I fear, to ascertain,\n-whether at the time of the dream it was known to any living man\nthat Mackenzie had not committed suicide.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] , Phantaln'8 of the Dead. 99\nThese cases are a~l I find in the collection with this particular kind\nof confirmation to distinguish them from subjective hallucinations. It\nwill be obser\\\"ed that, with the exception of the narrative concerning\nthe nephew who died in Australia, where there was an interval of some\nsix weeks between the death and the apparition, they have a common\ncharacteristic, namely, that the communication occurs within\" a few\ndays of the death, but it would be absurd to try to infer a general\nrule from so few instances.\nIn dealing, however, with these phantasms manifesting themselves\nvery shortly after death, it should be noticed that in the collection of\nphantasms of the living, cases have been included in which the mani-\nfestation occurs a few hours after death. For this there are two\ngrounds, namely, that the exact moment of the cessation of life is, it\nmust be assumed, to some extent uncertain, and that there is some\nreason to think that a telepathic impression may remain latent for a\ntime and force itself into consciousness only when quiet, or solitude, or\nsome other condition favourable to its development supervenes. If,\nhowever, the dead can communicate with us, it is possible that these\nsupposed delayed communications from the living are really communica.-\ntions directly from the dead. I think we should also notice that\nappearances of those who have recently died, to friends aware of their\ndeath, seem to be not uncommon, and frequently these appearances\nhave atl\"orded great consolation to the survivors. If the dead can com-\nmunicate with us, these appearances, too, may be real messages from\nthem, though we have no means of distinguishing them from subjective\nhallucinations.\nI have na.med among the kinds of confirmation we have to dcal with,\nthat a.trorded by apparent intention consistently carried out by the spirit.\nBut it is a rather remarkable fact that we have exceedingly little\nevidence in our collection clearly tending in this direction. We have\nsuch evidence to some extent in the dream of Mackenzie, already\nquoted, where the spirit may naturally have desired to comince Mr. D.\nthat he had not committed suicide. The only other case we have, I\nthink, is our single instance of the old-fashioned ghost who threatens\nto haunt her husband till he does what she desires, and who\ncarries the threat into execution. But though the threa.t was not made\nto the husband himself, so far as we know, it is yet impossible to feel\nsure that the apparition was not simply a morbid etl\"ect of his state of\ngrief and worry, which ceased when the disputed question was settled\nand the worry consequently at an end. The narrative (G. (25) is in the\nwords of the married daughter alluded to.\nA young couple were engaged. Her father withdrew his consent, the\nmother on her death-bed made its renewal her laat request. The fathllr.\ninstead of getting over his sorrow, seemed more and more bowed down with\nI[ 2\n\f100 Pha\"tll8m8 0\/ the Dead. [Apri12.J,\nan ever-increasing sense of \"horror.\" One day he told his married\ndaughter and her husband that his wife haunted him every morning at 4,\nthe hour when she died, always talking of the young couple. They asked\nhim what clothes the apparition wore, and he said, \"The last dreBS I gave.\nand a cap of your making.\" On their way home, the married daughter\ntold her husband that it was when in that dreBS and cap that her mother had\nsaid to her, \"If I die before your father renews his consent, I shall haunt.\nllim till he does.\" She was then in perfect health. Thia was never told to\nthe father, but he was urged to renew hia consent. For some months he\ncould only escape the viaitations by having someone aU!(lk~ with him in the\nroom. From the day he consented again to the marriage hia wife's visits\nceased.\nMr. Sid~ick has had an interview with the narrator of this curious\noccurrence, who tells him that she has no doubt that her mother had\nmade a dying request that he would give consent to the marriage;\nbut feels sure frow the way he spoke of the matter that she had not\nsaid anything about\" haunting\" to him ; he clearly did not know that\nhis consent would put a stop to it, nor did he apparently ever connect\nits cessation with her sister's marriage, which followed immediately on\nhis consent.\nIn the remaining divisions we shall only have cases of haunted\nhouses, or what the Committee have called \"fixed local ghosts,\" excf'pt\none where the' supposed ghost seems to have followed the family. In\ndiscussing these, I shall use the expression, tlte B'UpposedglWBt, or shortly,\nlIte gll.OBt, without intending either to affirm or tQ deny the existf'nce of a\ncontinuous entity manifesting itself in the apparitions, or even to imply\nthat there is necessarily any cause for them external to the percipient,\nor, in fact, to express any view whatever as to the origin of the alleged\nphenomena. I shall use it merely as a convenient name for the\nunknQ\"'1l cause or causes of a series of apparitions or other phenomf!na.\nof the kind, colmected by similarity or locality, or otherwise; or for the\nphenomena themselves.\nI now proceed to the third kind of confirmation of which the type\nis the subsequent recognition bythe percipient of the portrait of the sup-\nposed ghost. We have two cases of thisinthecollection, but for different\nreasons, which I will mention in their place, they neither of them appear\nto me to be of a conclusive kind.\nOne case has already been published in the Proceed\u00a3ngB ef the\nSociety (Vol. I., p. 106) in the first report of the Committef! on\nHauntedHouses. Mr. X.Z. is there describedas recognisingthe supposed\nghost four years after he saw it, in a portrait of the man with whom,\non other grounds, he had connected the apparition. These grounds\nwere that the man in question waa said to wear a costume resembling\nthat of the apparition, and to have committed murder and suicide on\nthe spot where he appeared, and on the same day of the year.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J Phantasms oj the Dead. 101\nThe narrative was written in 1882, 30 years after the appearance, but\nagainst this must be set the fact that (as I understand) a third-hand\naccount has been obtained substantially agreeing with it, originating in\nthe account given by Mr. X. Z., much nearer to the event, and whiCh\nforms, therefore, a to some extent independent check on the accuracy\nof lIr. X. Z.'s recollection. A more serious weakness in the evidence\nlies, I think, in the interval between the apparition and the recogniton\nof the portrait. Four years seem a long time to keep viTidly in one's\nmind a face seen only once, for a few moments, at a distance of 35 feet,\nthough no doubt under exciting circumstances likely to impress it on the\nmemory. 'Vith regard to the other evidence connecting the supposed ghost\nand the suicide, the dressing-gown and the site of the death were tra-\nditional only (the death occurred more than 50 years before the appari-\ntion) ; the date of the death Mr. X.Z. ascertained, he tells us, from the\nparish register. But in estima.ting the evidence afforded by the observance\nof an anniversary, we must take into account that this is, 1 think, the\nonly instance of such observance which we have at first-hand in all our\ncollection-el..cept two, which on other grounds I am inclined to regard\nas possibly explicable by personation.\nIn the next case, (G. 28), the portrait was seen on the day after the\napparition, but it does not seem to have been recognised without a little\nprompting. The percipient, who will not allow either her name or the\naddress of the house to be published, is known to Mr. C. C. Massey and\nMr. Podmore. The account here given was written out in her presence\nafter a prolonged and careful exanlination of her evidence, and is\ncertified by her to be correct.\nAbout the year 1872 my husband and I spent one night in the house of\nmy aunt, in one of the suburbs of London. The house being a very small\none, my cousin gave me up her room, and my husband had to sleep upstairs\nwith the son. Before she left me my cousin insisted, why, I could not under-\nstand, on leaving the gas alight-and did, in fact, leave a faint glimmer. In\nthe middle of the night I awoke in a. cold sweat, and saw, in the dim light,\na man standing close to my bedside. Thinking it wa.a my husband I called\nhim by name, and a.a far a.a my recollection serves, I put out my hand. lying\nstill in bed, to tum up the gas. The figure had disappeared; and I jumped\nout of bed, found the door locked, and searched the room through to no\npurpolle. I then felt a little nervous, but thinking that I must have been\ndreaming, I got into bed and went to sleep again. Twice more that night I\nwa.a woke up by the same cause ; I found myself each time, as before,\nshivering and in a cold sweat, and saw the same figure standing by me. I\nnow clearly saw the features and general appearance. It wa.a apparently a\ntall, well-built, rather good-looking man, in a. frock coat, and with a long\nreddish beard. After the third appearance I lefs the ga.a turned fully on, amI\nthen got to sleep without further disturbance.\nIn the morning I spoke at brea.kfa.at time of my nocturnal disturbance,\nDigitized b gle\n\f102 Phantasms 0\/' tile Dead.

A very fair specimen of them was printed in full in\nthe Proceedings of the Society, Part VI., p. 141. A lady sees one\nmorning leaning over her in bed, in a certain attitude, a muffled figure\nof a woman, which cannot, according t() her account, have been a real\n,voman since she saw it gradually becoming transparent and vanishing.\nShe is certain that she spoke to no one in the house about it, and to no\none outside who could have communicated with her brother; but a fort-\nnight later he tells her at breakfast that he has seen the .muffled figure\nof a woman leaning over him in bed in the same attitude.\nThe following narrative is an account of a very interesting case of\nthe same kind, only it is more recent, and the figure that appeared was\nmore definite. The different accounts are signed by the percipients, whom\nMr. Gurney has seen and with whom he has thoroughly discussed the\nevidence. They are not willing that their names, or that of the house\nwhere the phenomena occurred, should be published, but they have\ncommunicated it privately to Mr. Gurney, who hopes to obtain in time\nmore information about its preyiou8 history and the experience of other\ninhabitants.

In the\nfollowing August, one evening about 8.30, I had occasion to go into the\ndrawing-room to get something out of the cupboard, when, on turning\nround, I saw the same face in the bay-window, in front of the shutters,\nwhich were closed. I again saw only the upp8r part of the figure, which\nseemed to be in a somewhat crouching posture.

I jumpedup,and ad-\nvanced, thinking it was an 80Cluaintance from a few yards oft'. This impression,\nhowever, only lasted for a second; the face disappeared, but recalling it, I\nperceived atonco that it was certainly not that of the gentleman whom I had\nfor a second thought of. The resemblance was only that they were both\ndark. The face was pale and melancholy, and the hair very dark. I at onco\nwent to Mrs. W. in the dining-room, and asked if anyone had called.\nSho said, \" No \" ; and I then told her what I h\"d seen. I then for the first\ntime heard from her what she had soen, and our descriptions completely\nagreed. We had even both noticed that the hair was parted in the middle,\nand that a good deal of shlrt-front showed.\nA few weeks later, about 11 p.m., Mrs. W. and I were playing beziquu\nin the dining-room. Mr. W. was out, and the servants had gone to bed.\nThedoor of the room was open, and I was facing it. I suddenly had an\nimpre88ion thatsomeone was looking at me, and I looked up. There was tlle\nsame face, and the upper half of the figure, peeping round into the room\nfrom the hall. I said, \" There's the man again!\" Mrs. W. rnshed to thl'\ndoor, but there was no one in the hall or p&.,sage; the front door was locked,\nand the green baize door which communicated with the back part of the\nbouse was shut. The figure had been on the side of the dining-room door,\nnearest to the front door, and could not have got to the green baize door\nwithout passing well in our sight. We were a good deal frightened, and we\nmentioned the occurrence to Mr. W. on his return.

I told my father and Mrs.\nW. of thiaas BOOn aa I saw them.\nLater in the autumn, I waa sitting alone in the dining-room one evening,\nwith the door open. Mrs. W. had been upstairs, and 1 heard her coming\ndqwo.

I was not at all frightened,\nalthough I begall to believe that it could not have been the housemaid that\nI had. seen; still the hour of the day was not one to luggeat ghostly thoughts,\nand the figure Itself had nothing lupernatural about it, being limply that of\na servant in a light cotton drep (a white ground, with a Ipriggy pattern all\nover it), and with white cap on. Of coune, being behind it, I had not leell\nthe face. The whole figure had the general appearance of the housemaid,\nso tlmt she had been the one 1 had thought of. It was not in the leaat like\nthe cook, who dr_ed in much darker cottona, and was besides a very littlo\nwoman, while the figure I saw was of medium height.\nI determined not to tell my cousin about this, as 1 was going out for the\nday, and I thought ahe might get nervous in thinking about it alone, and\nafterwards I forgot about it till seeing it a ICCOnd time imprel!led it upon my\nmind.\nIt was about the same tinle in the morning, about two or tluee weeks\nafterwards, as far as I can remember, that ha,ing, as I thought, heard 1\\\naingle knock at the Itreet door, and wishing to Blleak to the housemaid as Bhe\nreturned fronl anlwering it, I ltood in the dining-room, JUBt inlide the half-\nopen door, waiting to catch her &I Ihe paaaed back to the kitchen, but\natanding a little behind the door 80 that I Bhould not be seen if anybody\nahould come into the house when ahe anBWered the deor.

On neither occaaion did I hear any 80und of walking, but this did\nnot lurprise me, although the figure was not two yards from me, because the\nhousemaid had a very quiet walk indeed, quite remarkably so. As I heard\nno door open or Ihut, and no figure returned after waitillg two or three\nminutea, I put out my head and looked in the hall. Nobody was there.

She immediately came\nout of a bedroom door to my left on the second 1l0or, whereupon I said to\nher, \"But you were going upstairs just now, how is it that you are here 1\"\nShe answered, \"No, I was in this bedroom,\" pointing to the one she came\nfrom, \"all the time.\" I then said, ..

The figure then disappeared by the aame door\nas on the former occasion, which, as before, was found locked! Lady\nBecher was not much alanned, but felt that something unusual had occurred,\nand at dinner mentioned the event to the General and his BOn, when tho\nGeneral repeated what had occurred to him on the former occaaion.

I think it was in the.winter of 1871. an apparition, in the exact\nlikeneBl of a fair woman draped from head to foot in white, glided slowly\nthrough the library of my house and into my bedroom. The face at the\ntime I did not see, as the figure preceded me to my bedroom. She appeared\nt&ll and rather slight. On her entering my room, I immediately followed and\nclosed tho door after me, with the object of discovering who the person WM\nthat was playing some sort of trick, but I could find no one in the room, after\nsearching it thoroughly. I, however, kept the circumstance perfectly secret.\nIt. might have been two or three years after this last event that I heard screams\nfrom all mydaughters, and, as itappeared after, from their maid as well; this\nwas about 10o'clock at night, and about the same hour I had seen the appari-\ntion previously. One of my daughters the next morning rushed to tell me\nof the fright they had had, but before she had time to explain t,he cause I\nat once dared her to talk of Rny such nonsense as ghosts, as they might be\nsure apparitions were only in the imagination of nervous people. I did not,\nhowever, tell her of what I had seen. From that time to the time my last\ndaughter was married, it was never alluded to between us, and I did not\nknow till then, when my daughter was leaving the house for her marringe\njourney, that either of my daughters had again seen the apparition. A few\nminutes before she left the house, she desired to speak to me privately, and\nwhen she gave me the full particulars of the female apparition which she\nhad seen repeatedly, I then acknowledged that the same figure had on seven\nor eight occasions appeared in my bedroom and twice in the library, and\nthat on one occasion it lifted up the mosquito curtains and looked closely\ninto my face. On tJUs occasion I became rather startled, as it was so sudden,\nand I uaed not very polite language, when it dropped the curtain and glided\nslowly away. It never appeared to walk, but to glide. It is now nearly\nDigitized by Google\n\f112 Plum\/am'8 qf tile Dead. [April 24,\ntwo years since I have witnessed it for a certainty, as the last time, I believe,\nI was merely dreaming of it. So impressed has the face become in my\nimagination that I believe I could distinguish it among thousands,-pale,\nrather handsome, oblongfeatures, and about 35. My daughter once heard her\nsister's name called two or three times, but there was no one in the room or\nnear to account for the voice.\nHad it not been for the scene at my daughter's marriage it would never\nhave been spoken of (at least, by me); but when she stated in the presence\nof others that she was glad to leave the houlle, and hoped never to sleep in\nit again, I very reluctantly told some of the friends present; but this took\nplace eight-and-a-half years after the first time any of us had seen the\napparition.-I am, sir, yours truly,\nJOHN D. BARRY.\nP.S.-My great reason now for keeping the matter secret is that the\nproperty I inhabit might not be depreciated, as the - - are a most\nnervous and superstitious people.\nI should add that the figure appeared to all three of my daughters and\ntheir maid at one time, and on the return of my daughter (the eldest), with\nher husband, she again saw it, and her husband likewise acknowledged\nthat he saw something, but could not describe it as he had just awoke.\nIt has never been seen by any of us except on the particular flat where\nthe sitting-rooms and bedrooms are.\nThe following account is from one 'of Mr. Harry'S daughters,-\nMrs. Knight. It will be seen that the details are not in complete\na.greement with his recollection of what his daughter had told him, but\nthis only illustrates what I have already said about second\u00b7hand infomla-\ntion. The two accounts agree in the important point that a female\nfigure draped in white has been ~n by several persons in the house,\nand independently by at least two of them; It was apparently seen too\nindistinctly by the second witness for any clear recognition of the\nfeatures, or she would hardly have taken it for her sister; unless,\nindeed, she means us to understand tha.t the face really was exactly\nlike her sister's, in which case it must have been unlike that of the\nfigure seen by her father, and which he believes he could distinguish\namong thousands. I hope we may ultimately obtain the endence of\nMr. Harry's other daughters as well\nMay 6th, 1885.\nIn the year 1871, about May, we moved into --, the family con-\nsisting of my father, two sisters, and myself.

I said, \"Wasn't that Louie 1\" My sister\nreplied, \"Yes, I wonder why she did not come up.\" She then went to the\ntop of the ladder and called her, but there was no answer. Then I remarked,\n\"That is the second time I have seen Louie in this house. I hops nothing\nis going to happen to her.\" Later in the evening I said to mysiater, \"Did you\ncome up to the roof to-night '1 \" \" Oh, no!\" she said, \"I wasn't near there. I\nwas downstairs all the time.\" Then I remarked, .. Well, something is going\nto happen to you, f&r we have scen your ghost twice following,\" but she\nonly laughed.\nI told my father of it, but he was very angry and said there were\nno such things as ghosts, and that we were never to speak of such things for\nfear of frightening the servants.\nI lived in that house for eight years and never saw it again. Thc last ten\nmonths I was alone with my father, and slept in a room quite away from\nanybody, but I never saw anything again nor had any fear. It was only on\nhearing from my father, after I was married, that he had seen it once or\ntwice, that I was afraid to go to the house, and I do not think anything would\ninduce me to go there again.\nMy father is afraid of nothing, but I know that he often sees this shadow,\nand yet does not believe it is anything supernatural, only he allows that he\ncannot account for it. IfI had seen it alone I should have thought I was out\nof health or imaginative, but as therewere two people each time it could not\nhave been imagination. S. E. KNIGHT.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mrs. Knight adds :-\nThe figure rose from the bed with its arms outstretched, as if beseeching\nor asking for something. I also noticed that it had its arms stretched out in\nthe same manner the second time I saw it. It vanished into the wall at the\nback of the bed as we approached it. It was a white shadowy figure of a\nyoung woman. The face looked pretty, but very sad. I couldn't say how it\nwas dreued, it all looked white and ffimay, as if you could pass through it.\nItis quite as clear in my memory now as at the time I saw it. I daresay you\nhave heard from my father that once he saw it in grey instead of white, and\nhe said it looked to have grown smaller.\nAnother narrative of appearances last year, in a house in Sussex,\nhas not yet been printed by the Committee, because they hope to ob-\ntain some further evidence about it shortly, but it has been shown to\nme in manuscript, and as it relates to a curious variety of these appari-\ntiOll8 I will give a brief account of it. We have, I believe, four first,.\nhand accounts from different percipients, none of whom had previously\nheard what the ghost was like. They saw in the night, by a wardrobe\nin a particular room, a column of light vaguely shaped like a woman,\nwhich in some cases moved without changing its shape or attitude,from\nthe wardrobe to the fireplace, and then slowly back again, and from the\nfireplace to the window, there disappearing all at once. The servant,\nhaving heard of the ghost, slept in the room with a view to seeing it,\nand succeeded on various occasions, but to her it appeared more like\n& ba.ll of light with a sort of halo round it. She saw it once in the\nDigitized by Google\n\f114 Pliania8f'M of tke Dead. [Apri12J,\nevening as she passed the door of the room, and called others to see it,\nbut when they got there it had disappeared. This seems to have been\nthe only occasion on which it was seen by anyone not in bed. One of\nthe percipients has endeavoured to account for the appearance as a\nrellection from the looking-glass, a light shining in at the window, &c.\u2022\nbut does n:>t seem to have succeeded in doing so satisfactorily. Rumour\nin the village says the house is haunted, and that a woman murdered\nher mother there, hut such village gossip cannot, I think, be taken 8S\nof any value without very careful investigation, since it may quite\npossibly have its origin in the very circumstances which it is supposed\nto explain and confirm.\nI have now, I think, exhausted the cases where we have first-hand\ntestimony from two or more witnesses who, without knowing what the\napparition was supposed to be like, seem to have seen much the same\nthing. But there are other cases which ought not, I think, to be left\nout of account, where we have first-hand evidence of appearances to one\npercipient, and second-hand accounts of others, only heard of by the\nnarrator of the first-hand account after his own experience. The\nfollowing is an instance (G. 629). Names may not be published, and\nfurther information cannot be obtainLod, which is ruucb to be regretted,\nas the story might become very interesting, and afford us useful informa-\ntion. It was received by Mr. Myers from a friend who writes on\nJanuary 15th, 1884.\nThe following was written to me by a relative. She learnt from an old\ngardener that there is a story ccnnected with the house, but what the story\nis she could not find out.\n\"I have had an odd sensation in summer, early in the morning, that there\nwas a woman in t.h.e room, but 1 could not look up till she had gone. 1 con-\nsidered this to be a sptlCies of nightulare, till last August. 1 was, 88 before,\nlying awake, when the IIIlme feeling came over me ; this time far more\nstrongly. 1 heard a dress rustIe, IUld felt a short, dark woman was coming\ntowards my bed. She put her hand on my shoulder, and looked over at\nmy face ; then the spell was o~ and I could turn round.\n1 was awake, I know, and was just noticing that the wardrobe door wasleft\na little open. I felt I could not stay in this room after this, and so moved\ninto another. 1 told my maid what I had seen, saying it must be nightmare,\nwhen she said, 'Why, that is what B. used to say. A ahort, sallow\nwoman uaed to come into his room, and pass by him to the window.' This\nB. was our la'to man-servant, and his room was over mine.\nI took an opportunity of asking him, and he said he knew he was awake,\nand got up to look, but after a few times he got used to it. '\n'Ve are seldom at home in August. I tlO'IO remember when we came here,\n17 years ago, being told the house was haunted, but never believed it or\nthought of it again.\nThe sensation was so dreadful, and yet I felt she (tIle apparition) meant\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J Phantasms of the Dead. 115\nno harm, more as if she were looking kindly at me. Her face seemed in\ndarkness, and yet I could see it. You will laugh, because it was all at mv\nback. I am curious to know if anyone will believe in a nC1t-seeing sight. 1\nsaw her in the back of my head; my face was to the wall. I felt I could not\nmove.\nThis is a correct version of my experiences on the morning of August\n11th,I883.\"\nHere it will be observed, unlike the other C&8es I have quoted, the\nsensation of seeing is produced without any possible intervention of\nthe eyes.\nThe following (G. 383) is another instance. It is an account of the\napparent hauntings of a house at Hammersmith, by Mrs. W. B.\n&---d, and was written in the summer of 1883.\n'''lien we went to live in our house at Hammersmith, we had never heard\na word of its being hsunted, nor had we any sort of feeling that it was a.\nghostly house or anything of the sort, nor had we ever in any other house\nexperienced any phenomena of the kind. Almost immediately after taking\npossession, all the members of the household complained of hearing noises\nin the lower part of the house-windows would be violently shaken every\nnight between 2 and 4 o'clock, and steps were heard apparently going about\nthe house. I myself frequently had doors opened for me before entering s.\nroom, as if a hsnd had hastily turned the handle and thrown it open. Then\noccasionally we used to hear sounds as of someone sobbing and sighing (deep\nlong sighs at all times of the day). I used to hear these sounds in my bed-\nroom, and on the little st.'\\ircase leading to it, and my husband would hear it\nin the dining-room underneath. Sometimes I would hear a sound of stitch-\ning in the room out of my bedroom, as if some very hard and coarse worlc\nwere being done, and then asound as of sc.mething being dragged acr088 the\n:floor. I got to hsve a feeling which was most uncomfortable, at times, as of\nbeing tootcJl\u20acd. These sort of things went on for about five years, when, in\nOctober, 1875, about 3 o'clock one afternoon I was sitting with three of my\nchildren in the dining-room, reading to them. I wanted to speak to the\nparlour-maid, and I rang the bell for her when the door opened, and on look-\ning up I saw a figure of a woman\u00b7 come in and walk up to the side of the\ntable, stand there a second or two, and then turn to go out again, but before\nreaching the door shelleemed to diBBolve away. She was agrey, short-looking\nwoman, apparently dre88ed in grey muslin. I hardly saw the face, which\nlleemed scarcely to be defined at all. None of the children saw her, and I\ndid not mention the circumstance to them nor to the servants, lest they should\nget frightened and leave. I only told my husband. I was in perfect health\nat the time.\nDuring the next two months, a figure, described exactly like the one I\nhad seen, was seen by two different servants, during the absence of the\nfamily. One of them saw itin the afternoon in daylight, and the other at 10\no'clock at night; one saw it on the little staircase, and one in the day nursery.\nNeither of these lIervants had by any po88ibility heard of my hsving seen\nanything of the sort. They were both in good health, and, having been\nwith me Bome time, had long grown accustomed to the noises; but one of\n1 2\n\f116 Phanttmn8 of tile Dead.

Her father ran to her, when abe said, .. Oh! I\nawoke and BIloW a little wicked-looking old grey woman standing at the foot of\nthe bed, looking at me with a horrid face. and then suddenly she went down\nthrough the Boor with a loud noise, and I screamed out.\" The child was in\ngood health, and hadnever heard any talk of the apparition.\nIn the autumn of 1876 I was awoke one night, and felt an icy \"'ind blow-\ning through my room, and heard loud lObs ; the curtains of the bed were\npulled back. and my hair was pulled. Another night I was awo~e by &\nbrilliant light in my room and the same cold wind. Previously to this, my\nhusband, on one occasion, heard his name distinctly called in his studIO, as\nhe sat at work. Since all this (1876) only occasional rappings have been\nheard, and I have not felt that feeling of being watched, which Wled to come\nover me when sitting in my room, the feeling which I had for years before I\nsaw any apparition.\nThe following are letters written later by Mrs. R--d.\nMarch 11th, 1884.\nDEAR IlK. GtrRNEY,-As to the night that I told you of last September,\nI was, as far as I can remember, awoke by the dog barking about 12 o'clock.\nThe barking stopped, but I heard what sounded like steps downstairs. Very\nlOOn the old noises began in our littlA library: jumping about, the window\nrattling, the whole place shaking, till my windows rattled too. The dog\nwhined inceaaantly, and the banging and jumping seemed to grow more and\nmoreboisterous. I got up and made lOme noise with the furniture in my room.\nlighted my candles, and went on to the landing to listen if there were noises\nin the other part of the house, but all was perfectly quiet there, though in\nthe little room downstairs the dog seemed to grow more and more distreaaed.\nand the noises continued more violently than ever. I listened to them till 3\no'clock, and as there seemed no chance of their stopping, I left my room and\npaaaed the rest of the night in Helen's. The dog evidently was still afraid of\nthe room when the morning came. I called to him to go into it with me, and\nhecrouched down with his tail between his legs,and seemed to fear entering it_\nThat was all that disturbed me, but I found it enough, as I was alone in\ntIle houle with only Helen and the maid.-Youra sincerely, C.

It will be observed that mysterious noises\noccupy a prominent place in this narrative, which has not been the case\nin any that I have yet spoken of except the one given in the\nProceeding8, Part VI.\nTo the present group of cases belong two more which will be printed\nwhen a little more evidence has been obtained. I will give a brief account\nof them on account of their great interest. In the first, the o.ppesrances\nhave taken place, so far as we know, only since the present occupants\ncame to the house in April, 1882. They have occurred mainly in the\nsummer, and have been very frequent. The figure seen is that of a\nlady in widow's garb, holding a hand and handkerchief up to her brow\nand apparently weeping; the face is concealed. It moves about, and has\nbeen seen in various parts of the house and garden, but most frequently\nis first seen by the original percipient on the stairs, and has constantly\nbeen followeddownto thedrawing.room,where it sits down in a particular\ncomer of a particular sofa.-or if the percipient sits in that place her-\nself, the apparition stands behind. At first this lady only saw it, and\nfor some time said nothing about it, but after atime a young brother of\neight years old saw independently what he described as a lady in black\ncrying in the drawing-room. Three other persons saw independently\nwhat seems to haVE!been the same figure, and since thenother members of\nthe family have seen it, though some who have tried to do so havefailed.\nIt has once been seen by two together, and on another occasion by one\nonly, though others were present. This, and its apparently disappearing\nthrough a closed door, preclude the idea of its being any real person.\nThe house where this occurs is only about 25 years old, and its history is\ncompletely known. The figure seen is believed to resemble a lady who\nformerly lived there, and whose life there was unhappy, but who did not\ndie there. She was not known to the percipients, and as the apparition\nnever, I believe, shows its face, the likeness inferred from photographs\nmust remain somewhat conjectural.\nThe other unprinted case :relates to an old Elizabethan manor\nhouse. It is well-known as a haunted house, and various exaggerated\naccounts of the ghost may be met with. According to some accounts\ntha.t reached the Committee, the ghost is continually appearing, but\nusually ooly shows its back, which is fortunate since the face is so\nhorrible that anyone seeing it is frightened almost into fits and\ninsists on leaving the house! The true history, so far as the Com-\nmittee yet have it, is less sensationa.l and seems in brief to\nbe as follows. The house was, from the summer of 1861 to\nthe spring of 1863, occupied by a Mr. and Mrs. H. Before he rented\nDigitized by Google\n\f118 P\"anttwn8 01 the Dead. [April 24,\nit Mr. H. had heard many reports of its being haunted, but these were\nof a general character; he heard no description of any appearance.\nWe know also from other sources tha~ the house had previously this\nreputation. The H.'s cORstantly heard noises for which they were\nunable to account; and their little dog behaved somewhat oddly at night,\nrefusing, contrary to ib usual habits, to leave its basket on any provo-\ncation. One night Mr. H. saw an old woman in a dark gown, grey\n.shawl, and poke bonnet standing at the foot of the bed. She vanished,\nand he got up and examined thp, room, satisfying himself thatit was no\nillusion. He never spoke of this, while lhey remained in the house, to\nanyone except a. siswr-in-law whom he bound over to secrecy, and he\nis certainshe kept the secret. During his tenancy an old nurse, after\nsleeping one night in the house, refused ever to do so again, but would\ngive no reason. After they left they persuaded her to tell them why\nahe had acted thus, and it then appeared that ahe had seen a figure\nwhich she described exactly as Mr. H. did his, though she had never\nheard of his experience. The nurse is dead and we have her account\nat second-hand only.\nThe next tenants are believed to have had experiences, but they have\nnot yet been got at, and after 1864 the house remained empty for some\ntime.\nFrom 1867 to 1875 it was inhabited by a clergyman and his family.\nIn the autumn of 1867 the clergyman, Mr. B., whileunpackingin a dress-\ning-room opening on to the landing, saw passing the door a lady in blue\nwith her hair down her back, who could not possibly be anyone in the\nhouse. In July, 1868, a similar figure was seen by a lady in nearly the\nsame place. She saw it very clearly, including fo.ce and bare feet. It\nwent into the dressing-room and there disappeared. Of these\ntwo appearances we ha.ve accounts at first-hand, but they were\nprobably not independent in the sense in which I have used the\nword, as I believe the lady knew what Mr. B. had seen. There are,\nbesides, accounts at second-hand of two appearances to a housemaid of\na figure apparently not exactly resembling Mr. B.'s ; and also at second-\nhand of two appearances to a gentleman staying in the house, who\ndescribed the figure somewhat differently again. These four last-\nmentioned appearances also occurred in 1868. It is not clear whether\nthere have been other appearances to servants or not. The B.'s left\nthe house in 18i:>. It was then somewhat repaired and altered, and\nfrom 1876 till now has been occupied by another family who have seen\nand heard nothing at all remarkable.\nWe have here the remarkable feature that the haunting, which\ncontinued for at least seven years, and through the occupancy of at\nleast three families, seems to have changed its character in a. marked\ndegree.\nDigitized by Google\n\f1884.] PllflnUl8ms of tAe Dead. 119\nI may add that the ghost is said to be the spirit of a young lady\nmurdered in the middle of the last century for her jewels. But the\nstory of this murder is very hazy, and has its origin, I believe, in a\nletter received from America, after the appearances .to the B. family.\nThis letter professed to come from a person who had learnt the story\nfrom the last surviving member of the murderer's family, and received\nfrom her 110 secret plan showing the spot where the treasure was hid.\nFrom internal evidence, I should judge it to be a hoax.\nI will now give some cases where the appearances were not strictly\nindependent, but where it would seem that the previous knowledge\npossessed by some of the percipients as to the form of the ghost can\nhardly haye operated through expectation in producing it, since their\nfirst impression W8.s that they saw 110 living human being.\nThe account of an apparition, supposed from a resemblance of figure\nto be possibly that of Miss A., printed in the ProcudingB, Vol. I.,p. 108,\nis 110 case of this. It is 110 reccrd, as will be remembered, of a shadowy\nfemale figure seen several times.\nA somewhat similar ca.se is the following (G. 77), obtained through\nMr. Hensleigh Wedgwood. The house is in Ireland, but neither its\nname nor that of the percipients may be published. The first account\nis from Miss C., the goyemess.\nOn the 18th of April (Thursday), 1867, about 7.40 p.m., I was going to\nmy room, which I at that time shared with one of my pupils, when just as I\nbad reached the top of the stairs I plainly saw the figure of a female\ndreSBed in black, with a large white collar or kerchief, very dark\nhair, and pale face. I only saw the side face. She moved slowly\nand went into my room, the door of which was open. I thought\nit waa Marie, the French maid, going to see about A.'s clothes, but\nthe next moment I saw that the figure was too tall and walked better. I\nthen fancied it was some visitor who bad arrived unexpectedly (Mrs. S. bad\ndone 80 a few days previously), and had gone into the wrong bedroom, and\nas I had only been at F. H. a short time, I felt rather shy at speaking to\nstrangers, so waited where I was a minate or two expecting to see the lady\ncome out, but I never lost sight of the door. At last I went in, and there\nwas no one in the room. I looked everywhere, and even feltthe backofthe\nhanging side of the wardrobe to see whether there was any concealed door\nleading into the next room. This idea would not have occurred to me bad I\nbeen able in any way to ac.:ount for the lady's disappearance. She could\nnot have gone by the window, aa the room was on the second storey. Going\ndownstairs, I met the cook and another maid, and asked themif any stranger\nhad arrived, and was answered in the negative. I bad never heard of any\nstrange appearances in the house, and could not accountfor what I bad seen\nthat evening.\nSome years after, inDecember,1874, aa I wasgoing to bed, about 10 o'clock\n(thehouaehadbeenslightlyaltered), I sawmostdistinctly a lady in black leaning\nover the fire in the room occupied by the eldest daughter. She waa shading\nDigitized by Google\n\f120 PlIanta8ma of tke Dead. [April 24,\nher eyes with her hand, and seemed looking for something by tile fender; her\nother hand was on the chimney-piece. I walked slowly towards the room,\nand said, \"Take care, C., you will burn your face, it is .0 near the flame.\"\nAs there was no answer I spoke again, I suppose louder, for at that moment\nC., whom I supposed the lady to be,came out of her suter', \"oom and asked\nwhat I was talking about and why I was in such a fright about her burning\nher face.\u00b7 There was no one in her room and no one could have passed me\nunobserved, as I was standing close to the door.\nAnothertime, late one evening in September, I was sitting in the school-\nroom with the door open, when I saw the figure again, standing on the f~\nside of the stove in the lower hall. I at once got up to see who it was, but\nit had vanished. I think it seemed to go up one step of the stairs,butam not\nBure, as this was the only time I felt rather nervous when seeing it, and that,\nperhaps, from thinking it was someone who had no busine88 in the house, or\nthat someone was playing me a trick. Each time I have seen \"the black\nlady\" she has been dre88ed in what appearedto be black serge or caallmere-\nsomething soft and in heavy folds-with the same large white collar or\nkerchief on her neck. Whatever it was, I feel as certain of having seen it\nas that I am now writing thisaccount of it, and it may be as well to mention\nthat I am by no means a nervous person-quite the contrary.\nIn answer to the inquiry how she knows the dates of the appearances,\nMiss C. tells us that she \"has kept a diary for many years, putting down\nslwrt remarks of remarkable and interesting events, seeing the \u2022 Black Lady'\namongst the rest.\"\nShe adds that she .. had not heard anything of the house being supposed\nto be haunted when she saw the 'Black Lady , in the spring of 1867. It\nwas not till some months afterwards that she heard the story of MiSB M.,and\nthe report that she was seen a at times walking about the house and garden.\"\nAs regards the story of MiSB M., Mi88 C. sn.ys :-\" Part of this house.\nnearly all of it, was burnt down in 1752. The room in which MiSB M. slept,\nand in which, some sn.y, the fire originated, seems to have been near what is\nnow the drawing-room and front hall. Some old people in the neighbourhood,\ndead now for some years, reported that they had heard long ago that MiBB\nM.'s door was locked by the servants, as she was subject either to fits or to\nwalking in her sleep; that she attempted to escape by the window, which\nwas not a great height from the ground, but that the sash fell down on tho\nhand, cutting off three fingers and causing her to fall back into the burning\nroom. The house was rebuilt in 1762.\"\nMiSB A. M.'s Account.\nJ I'M 26th, 1883.\nI do not know much of the history of our ghost; all I have heard is, that she\nis said to be a lady who was subject tofits ; ahe was under the charge of servants\n<IDly, and one night she was locked up in a room by herself, the house was\nburnt down at that side, and she was burnt to death. In trying to save her-\nself by getting out of the window she smashed two of her fingers.\nI do not remember when she was first seen, or who was the first to see\nher, but two of my sisters saw her, when they were quite young, at different\ntimes. One of them was coming out of the nursery, which is at one end of\na paa88ge, and she saw this lady standing in the doorway of the room at tho\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J P\/la\"tasms 0\/ tile Dead. 121\nopposite end. My sister was much frightened, and called out that there was\na woman with a white face looking at her; when some one came, the woman\nhad disappeared. I forget how she appeared to the other child, I think she\nII&W her sitting in a chair in a room she had just come into. We did not ask\nthe child much about it for fear of impressing it on her memory and frighten-\ning her. My eldest sister was one evening standing in her room, and on turn-\ning to the door, there was the ghost standing in the doorway. She disap-\npeared almost directly.\nMy mother twice, that I know of, saw her, both times on the stairs. The\nfirst time, thinking it WILlI one of us, she called but got no answer; she called\nseveral times but got no answer. She says the person turned round and\nlooked at her, but my mother, who does not see very well, still thought it .\nwas one of us, and getting angry at not being answered, pursue,d her up the\nstairs. The female went into a very small room at the top and shut the\ndoor. My mother went in after her but no one WILlI there. The other time\nthe lady passed my mother on the stairs; she thought she was one of the ser-\nvants, which it was afterwards proved she was not. My mother is not at all of\nan imaginative disposition. One of my sisters and myself also saw her at\nthe same time one evening. We were sitting in the school-room rather late;\nthere isa hall outside the school-room with a large stove in it. We had no\nlight but the firelight, the door was wide open, and I was standing facing the\nha.ll, and I saw standing behind the stove the same apparition. She appeared\n80 tall that it did not seem ILII if she could be standing on the ground. I\nsaid to my sister, \"Look round,\" which she did. We both looked at her for\na second or two, and then the fire went down; we poked it up but saw nothing\nagain.\nEvery one who saw her gives the same description of her, that she is\na woman about middle height, dressed in black, with a shawl over her head.\nWhen we saw her in the hall she had herside face towards us, so we could\nnot see her well. .\nI also saw a very curious reflection once. I was sitting in my sister's\nroom, and was leaning back looking up, when I saw on the ceiling the\nshadow of a head and a hand that appeared as if it had only three fingers.\nThinking it was my sister's shadow I thought what a curious shadow her\nknitting made, and looked down to see what she was doing with it ; on looking\nup the reflection WILlI gone. We then found that both our shadows were on\nthe ftoor. I did not know until afwr I had seen this that the lady had lost\ntwo of her fingers when trying to get out of the window.\nI omitted to say that there was no egress from the little room my mother\nfollowed the lady into excepting the one by which my mother went in.\nIn answer to inquiries, Miss A. M. writes, on December 1st, 1882:-\nWe none of us except Miss C. put down the dates of any time we saw the\nghost, and I hardly remember any of them.\nI saw thereftection in May,1877.

It was in June, 1880 ; I had been out for a walk [to\nlook at a dance at a neighbouring house] with my youngest sister, and one of\nthe maids. (Before we left we llad told them not to sit up for us.) When we\ngot back it was about 120'clock, but it was a very light night. I went to the\nwindow first that wo were going to get in by, and looked through the gl&88\nand saw a lady standing at thebottom of the st.airs,I thought it was my mother\nat first. She then walked slowly acro88 the hall, and I opened the window,\nand there was no one there. I could not see her face; she was all in black.\nThat is all I can remember.\nThe evidence of other percipients cannot be obtained at first-hand.\nI do not wish to lay much stress on this case because there is some\ndifference in the descriptions given of the figure. All, how-\never, agree that they saw a lady dressed in black. The curious\nshadow seen on the ceiling cannot, I think, as described, be regarded as\nimportant, as it is not shown that it had no ordinary, though\nfleeting, cause. Of the accounts at first-hand only Miss C.'s and Miss\nI. M.'s describe appearances taken at first for a real person. Miss A.M.\nseems to have surmised at once tha.t she saw the ghost.\nThe next narrative (G. 110) relates to an old house in London, but\nthe names are here also to be kept private. Noises again take a rather\nprominent place in this account, which has considerable interest, though\nit is perhaps a little doubtful whether the nurse had no expectation I)f\nseemg the ghost; she was certainly in a nervous state.\nThe first part of the account was written down by Mr. Podmore,\nand afterwards corrected by Mrs. H. The seco nd part is from Mrs.\nG., her married daughter. The third part is from the nurse. The\nhistory of the house is not known.\nThe scene of tho occurrences mentioned below is a large house in London.\nThe house, which is an old one, has been tenanted by its present occupanta\nfor about 12 years. Previously to this it hud the reputation of being\nhaunted; Mrs. H. had heard rumours to that effect from the former\noccupants.\nMrs. H., the lady of tho house, has herself seen nothing abnormal in\nthe house, but she has, of course, heard the account given by succc88ive\nservants, and the facts stated below may be taken to be substantially\naccurate.\nNoises as of footsteps were heard not unfrequently in the dusk and at\nnight along one of the rooms in the building; these noises would appear to\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] PnuntfJ8n'8 oj tke Dead. 123\npass quiteclose to the aervant who heard them, but nothing would ever be\nseen. Other atrange noises, .. if ,omeone were digging, would be conatantly\nheard in a parlour on the ground Hoor of the house. These noisea would be\nheard by two or three persons at a time; and either at night or in the day-\ntime. Aa there are rooma on all aidea of thia parlour belonging to the\nhouse, these sounds could not have been caused by anyone outside the\nbuilding itself ; and no natural origin could be aaaigned for them within the\nbuilding.\nOn several occasions, perhaps a dozen in all,'during the 12 years in which\nthe H. family had lived in tho house, the servants had been frightened by\nseeing a woman'a figure. They all gave the same deaeription of the figure:\na pale woman in black, with an evil face. The figure would only be aeen\nmomentarily; indeed in moat casea the witneaaes appear to have been too\nmuch frightened to wait for it to disappear. As Mrs. H. feared, not\nunreasonably, that aome injury might be done to her property if the house\nacquired generally the reputation of being haunted, ahe had neverquestioned\nthe girIa closely on what they had seen, being afraid to show too much\ninterest in the matter. She had always laughed off their fears, and\nendeavoured to make them forget all about it. For the same reason ahe\ncould not allow us to cross-question the witneaaes ourselves. 'Ve were forced.\ntherefore, to be content with the following details, with which she and Mila\nH. aupplied us.\nThe figure was first aeen about 11 years ago, by Sarah C., a young aervant-\ngirl of about 18. She was coming downatairs in the daytime. when she met\nthe figure, and was so frightened by it that ahe jumped sideways through\nthe figure and over the stair-rail. dropping a distance of from four to six\nfeet on the other side.\nOn another occasion it was seen by one of the servants going downataira\nto the kitchen. and she, thinking it to be a visitor, who had missed her way.\nfollowed it, and found no one there.\nThe figure was also seen by the cook on one of the upper landings, in full\ngaslight, and disappeared before the cook came up to it.\nThree or four years back, two aervants were together in a long room at\nthe top of the house, in the daytime. One of them saw a woman's figure\nstanding by a chest of drawers at the far end of the room. She called her\ncompanion's attention to it, saying. \"Who is that 1\" but when they looked\nagain the figure had gone. There was no poaaibility of retreat for a human\nbeing so placed.\nThe figure was last aeen a few weeks ago, by a girl now in the house.\nShe was very much frightened, and could give no particulars.\nMrs. H. and her daughter fancy they have detected some connection\nbetween the appearance of this figure, and the subsequent deatll of children.\nwho have been lying ill at the time.\nMias H. took us all over the house, and we saw each spot where the\nfigure had been aeen.\nFrom Mrs. G. (Nee H.)\nThe incident I have been asked to relate happened as follows :-\nThere were two rooms divided by a fireplace; on the left hand of this\nwas adoorway connecting the rooms; on the right, a partitionof glaaa to within\nDigitized by Google\n\f124 Phantasms qf the Dead. [April 24.\ntwo feet or 80 of the ground, and wood below. This partition divided the\nroom I was in from a steep staircase into the kitchen below, which staircase\nopened into the other room with a door that stood open agaill8t the wall. In\nthe further room opposite the staircase was a doorway into a garden, on the\nright side of this, in the same corner, a door leading by a passage to the street.\nThe time was about six o'clock on a winter's evening, Gas was burning\nbrightly in both rooms. I entered the room by a door on your right hand as\nyou faced the fireplace, and at the opposite end to it. Thus, as I turned to\npass into the second rOOIll, the glass partition was in front of me.\nThrough this glass partition I saw a woman advancing towards me from\nthe opposite end of the further room. She was tall, dark, and pale, dre88ed\nin black, indoor dre88 ; her head was sideways, resting quite upon her right\nshoulder as if her neck was dislocated, Her hair was plainly and smoothly\ndre88ed acro88 the sides of her face. She came swiftly towards me, and was\nso distinct that I didnot suppose but that she was 80Ille stranger got into the\nplace. When she came to the stairs she suddenly stood still an ill8tant, and\nthen disappeared perpendicularly, like one who falls through a trap-door. I\nat once ran to the partition, and looked down the stairs, but nothing could\nbe seen, nothing had been heard. I ran down to the kitchen, but the people\nthere had not seen or heard anything.. Both rooms were empty. There was\nonly a child with me about six years old, who had seen nothing,\nA month or so after, I was sitting in a room in the same house one after-\nnoon, when a cupboard standing agaill8t a wood partition between the room\nand a passage was rapped as if some one were hammering all over: it. I\nopened the door, thinking it was some one in the passage, but while I stood\nin the doorway commanding both the room and passage, the knocks were as\nloud as ever. I felt so nervous that I went to the nursery and fetched a.\nchild about five or six years old, to come and play in the room with me.\nShe was amusing herself with some toys, and I was reading, when she\nstopped, and looked intently at the partition just above the cupboard. It\nwas painted a plain colour; there was no picture, or light or shadow where\nshe was looking. I asked the child what she was looking at. .. At the\nface,\" she replied. \"Never mind,\" I said, .. go on with your play,\" and 80\nshe did, but very soon stopped again. She came up to me, and looking at\nthe same place, she said, \"Oh, the face.\" \"Some one looking out of\nwindow,\" I replied, inconsequently, as the window was behind us. .. Oh,\nno,\" she said, .. it wants you, Mias Alice, it wants you.\" I saw nothing, but\npicked up the child, and took refuge in the nursery.\nFrom the Nurse.\nFe\/wua1'1J 13th, 1883.\nI never feel nervous about my nursing capacity, or the recovery of my\npationts, except I am nursing in the place where I am writing this.\nThe house is old, and like most old houses has its haunted room, in\naddition to a subterranoanpassagc, which was blocked up 50 years ago, and\nfrom which, it is reported, strange sounds have come, like the blows from a\nmallet, and the sound of somebody digging. I have never heard anything\nof the sort, but this much I know for a fact, that often when taking my notes\nor watching quietly by my patient, with a good fire, and a light burning, I\nDigitized by Goo\n\f1885.] Phanta&m8 of Me Dead. 125\nhave suddenly felt as if a cool wind was blowing about me so that I could not\nhelp shivering, and as if fingers were lightly touching my shoulders, and\nmore than once feeling positive that somebody passed quickly through the\nroom. Now I have never experienced these strange sensations when nursing\nin any other house, but I always feel when called here to nurse that I am\nabout to do battle for the life of my patient, with a foe whose exact power I\ndo not understand,and have always striven to defeatan influence which I felt\nwas evil, by soliciting the protection of One Who is Almighty.\nAbout four years ago I came here to nurse a little girl, five years of age,\nsuft'ering with whooping coughand inflAmmation of the lungs.\nMy patient was isolated as much as po88ible, as there were other children\nin the house. The room in which I was to nurse seemed in all respects\nsuitable for nursing-large, lofty, properly heated and ventilated. There\nwas only one arrangement I did not like, and that I did not notice until I saw\nmy little patient more than once look anxiously towards it, being a large\nwindow or partition, partly of glaBS, which had beenrecentlyadded to make the\nroom lighter. The door, also partly of glaBS, was at the side oithe partition\nand opened directly on to the stairs. One day, shortly after my arrival, I\n\"'as informed that the baby, only a few months old, was dangerously ill. The\ndoctor did not think it would recover: Consequently the person who had\ncharge of my patient while I was oft' duty could not be spared, so when night\ncame I was rather tired. After giving my patient her medicine, making her\ncomfortable and attending to the fire, I rested for a short time on a spare bed\nwhich was in the room. When I arose I looked at my watch ; it was just 10\nminutes to 1. At that moment the child, who had been sleeping quietly,\nsat up, looked wildly at the partition, gave one piercing scream, then hid her\nface in the bed clothes. I dared not look at the partition, but turningmy head\nwent quickly to the child saying, \" Did anything hurt or frighten you 1\" She\nwould neither answer nor look up. I then heard a sound on the stairs, as if\nsomebody was going down without boots on, thud, thud; 80 I called out\n\" Who's there 1 Do speak, you have frightened us. Is it you, Mrs.-- 1\"\nmeaning the person who waited on us. Not receiving an answer I waited\nawhile, then softly opened the door and looked out. All was quiet; the gsa\nwas burning on the lower landing. By itslight I saw a woman standing at\nthe foot of the stairs. Her face was turned up towards me. It was perfectly\ncolourle88, the eyes and mouth were closed ; her hairwas ofa drabbish colour\nand her neck appeared to be slightly twisted. I drew back instantly, for the\nface I had seen shocked me ; it resembled the face ofa corpse. Fora moment\nI thought, is it poBBible that anybody would attempt to frighten us! I\nlooked again-the woman had disappeared.\nThere was a bellcommunicatingwith tho housekeeper's l'oom. I rang it\nviolently, waited a few minutes, then heard the well-known footstep of Mrs.\n--. on the stairs. As she came into the room, she said, \"Is anything the\nmatter, nurse 1\" Before I could answer, she said, .. The dear baby's gone.\nShe died just 10 minutes to 1.\" \"Well,\" I remarked, \"tllat is strange.\"\nThen I told her what had occurred, and concluded by asking her if she had\nheard orseen either of the servants about the house. \"Oh, it's not tIle\ngirls,\" she said. \"They are all in bed,except the nurse that has been with the\nbaby.

One nurse that was here declared that her\npatient's medicine and spoon were thrown across the room, and I myself once\nwent through the nursery and saw a woman in a dark dreBS looking into one\nof the drawers. I went into the next room and said to the nurse, 'Who's\nthat person at the drawers 7' She answered, 'You must be mistaken,\nthere isn't anybody in the nursery.' I went back to see and the woman had\ndisappeared. Yes, it's strange, but it's true, before trouble, sickness or\ndeath, that woman is always seen, but there,\" she said, \"it does not do to\ntalk about such things. You know what people are, and there wouldn't be 0.\nservant got that would stay in the house if they knew all.\" Then looking at\nmy patient she said, \" I think she seems worse than when I last saw her.\"\n\"Well,\" I said, \"sho has been dreadfully frightened,\" and I thought, but did\nnot say, ifshe illes, it will bo as much from fright as any other callse. A few\ndays after, I was called away to a. very important case. My little patient\nlived ouly two or three days after my departure. More than once since then\nI have asked myself this question, \" Was she frightened to death 1\"\nThe following (G. 468) is a.gain an account of apparent haunting in\nan old house in London-l 5, St. Swithin's Lane. The events took place\nin 1854 and onwards. Mr. Gurney has seen Mrs. and Miss Vatas-\nSimpson and discussed their experiences with them personally. I\nbegin with the recollections of Miss Vatas-Simpson (written in October,\n1884), whom Mr. Gurney describes as a sensible a.nd clear-headed\nperson, and who has never had any other hallucination, veridical or\notherwise.\nFrom Miss Mary E. Vatll.8-Simpson.\nI remember well (when a little girl, with a sister and brothers younger\nthan myself) an old lady who proved the greatest trouble we cllildren had,\nfirst because she was a mystery, and secondly because she got us into trouble\nwith our father. It happened in this way. Ours was an old house, the clining-\nroom at the top, three windows front, a fireplace each end, two doors\nopposite the windows-one leading into my eldest sister's bedroom and the\nother on to the landing at the top of the stairs, which stairs were narrow,\nwith enormous bannisters turning at every few stairs into a great square\npost, on which we used to delight to perch ourselves to see what was going\non below, particularly if the servants let anyone into the drawing-room, which\nwas under the dining-room.\nOne day I was sitting thus on a post, when I saw a tiny old lady walk\nslowly into the room, all alone. This is what surprised me, for this reason.\nThere was across the stairs an ornamental iron gate, which shut off my father's\noffices from the offices of the lower part of the house. Persons calling had\nto ring to gain admiBSion, as they would do at a front door. This old lady\nI saw come from the stairs above the gate, but on leaning over I saw the gate\nwas shut and no one there. After a little whispered conversation with my\nbrother Walter, who was sitting astride on the post above me, we thought\nwe would see who she was. So we went gently into the room, quite\nexpecting to Bee her ; but we were clisappointed, she was not there. I came\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.] PhanwmII cif tM Dead. 127\nskipping lightly out of the drawing-room, knowing we had no buaine8B there,\nwhen I screamed with astonishment, for out of a door always kept locked, at\nthe foot of the very stairs on which we had been sitting, came our old L-wy.\nI ran into the drawing-room to tell Walter, and when I reached the top of the\nstairs again, 1 saw her below the gate, going slowly downstairs. She\nwas just out of our sight when my father rushed upstairs, and was veryangry\nindeed with us for the noise we made.\nA few days after this we were a.ll playing at a very favourite game--chairs\nput into form to represent a carriage, in which we sat and covered our heads\nwith a blue and white cotton table-cover for a roof. My brother Garry hurt\nme. I threw off our cover, and just inside the half-opened door stood the\nold lady, dreBBed like she was before--black shabby dre8B, rather large bonnet,\nand a good deal of velvet on her kind of hanging mantle. I thought she\nmust have made a mistake and come up too far for father's office. Seeing a\nhalf-smile on her face I walked towards her, when she went out of the\ndoor quite slowly and turned towards my sister's bedroom. I quickly ran\ninto the dining-room, intending tocatch her to-day by the door between the\ntwo rooms; but I did not see her. Rushed through my sister's room, on to\nthe landing, down the stairs-when I saw, two or three turns of the stairs\nlower down, Walter was running after the old lady, who went very quickly,\nkeeping close to the wa.ll all down the lta.irca.se. Once again my father came\nout of his office and told Walter he would whip him if he heard another\nlound. We asked the lervants who this old lady was. They looked at each\nother and said \"only an old lady who came to lee mamma.\" Though we\noften saw her and were not a bit afraid of her, yet no one leemed to believe\nus; BO though we children often talked about her to each other, we did not\nmention her in public. This we did do: One of us took to riding outside our\nCYriage on purpos~ to watch our Itrange old lady. For she always looked\na great dea.l-or seemed to our youthful eyes to do so-and we rul thought\nshe would do something horrid to us the first time Ihe caught us under the\ntable-cloth. We even kept a large ruler close to us on purpose to throw at\nher if she touched us. She was very real indeed to us, and I seem to see her\nquite vividly now when I reca.ll it a.ll to my mind.\n(Signed) MARy E. VATAS-SIMPSON.\n'Vhat follows is from Mrs. Vatas-Simpson's Dia.ry.\nThis is very strange. What can it mean 1 The servants say that they\nsee queer things moving about, and that they hear peculiar noises. One\nservant has left us in consequence. To-day I was told by a neighbour that\nthe people who lived here before we came could not remain, because there\nwere always noises and BOunds about the house at night, and that even his\nlittle children were disturbed by them. At la.st they became so very unbear-\nable he was obliged to go elsewhere. One hardly knows whether to believe\nsuch reports or to laugh at them. At present we have had no nocturnal\nvisitors, and I sha.ll not tell my dear ones, to cause apprehension of ghosts\nand hobgoblins.\n* * * * * \u2022\nThere must be BOme foundation for the rumours regarding the BOunds,\nnoises, and appearances in this old house. It has stood here since the Fire\nof London. The lower part of the house is very extensive; and then, under-\nDigitized by Google\n\f128 Pllantasrm of the Deaa.

I try to turn a deaf ear to all this, and\nto combat the fears such revelations inspire in the household, but am\nunsuccessful with the servants, as they leave me in consequence. My husband\nsays the sounds are produced by the contrary winds careering through the\ngratings, and perhaps they are.\nA severe illness has kept my pen idle for several weeks. Notso, however,\nevents. To-day, L. told me that when the children are playing upstairs an old\nwoman will persist in standing in the doorway, looking in very disconsolately.\nShe believes in the reality of the occurrence; says that it is an annoyance;\nwould I give orders to the servants to keep ourgate on thestaircase locked 1-\nthe iron gate that shuts in the private portion of the house from that which\nis below, making it thus quite impossible to pass up the stairs from the offices\nbelow.\n*\nSo late, so tired and weary. Every night now L. and I have to sit up\nlong, dreary hours to wait my husband coming home, for we are afraid to go\nto bed till he returns. There is no feeling of security with only women in\nthis big, grim, and hollow-sounding house, and though we are both free\nfrom all superstitious fears, and far from timid, we cannot but be sensible\nof our unprotected helplessness, left alone, as we are, till the night wanes\ninto morning.\nTo-night, and for se\\\"eral nights now, we have had our courage put to the\ntest, and most decidedly it has not been found wanting. . The first\nevening, about 11 o'clock, sitting with the drawing-room door open, a man's\nface was clearly seen abo\"e the balustrade, while the old-fashioned size and\nthe carvings of the supports hid his form from our view. Instantly we both\njumped up, and as instantly started forward. Both thought that he had come\nup by mistake, or purposely, perhaps, to see SOmeone in the house. Ere we\ncould speak he was gone.\nThe servants, not having gone to bed, were summoned, told to go and\nfasten the iron gate, and reprimandedfor their negligence in forgetting to do\nso. The gas was alight, illuminating the house from the ground-floor to the\nvery roof of the house. We stood upon the landing. The servants went down,\nprotesting that they had locked and fastened securely the gate : and so they\nhad-it was securely fast.\nThen I went for the key, and dOWllstairs, and satisfied myself of the fact,\nand also went below to satisfy myself that all doors and every place below\nwere firmly secured for the night.\nNow, then, how did that man get in 1-or rather, how did he get out?\nIt is possible he might have been concealed during the evening, and so\nhave been on the stairs-but where could he go, instantaneously as he had\nbeen followed, and by both of us, neither of us suspecting anything more\nthan that he had obtained entrance through the forgetfulncssof the servants,\nand nothing doubting but that he would wait to be spoken to 1 Where could\n\f1885.J PhantfJ8m8 oj tllfJ Dead. 129\nhe go ?-for in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, the spot where he had\nappeared was vacant.\nWell, when my husband came home I told him. He treated it as a good\njoke, laughed at our bewilderment, and said we must all have been asleep\nand dreaming. He has such a supreme contempt for any supposition of\nthe supernatural. Has no belief in spiritual visions, in \"ghosts,\" or visiona\nof the night. He is far too practical, and only derides my credulity. At.\npresent I have been able to keep all suspicion of these things from the\nhousehold.\n* * * * * *\nTwice lately, sitting up during the night hours, my L. and I have been\ndisturbed by that same appearance on the stairs, and each time have done\nour best to disco\"er the mystery. The face is pale to sickliness, and the eye\nsteady and mournful. The figure is shrouded in a sort of dark, shadowy\nindistinctness, and his departure is sudden and noiseless. The first time he\ncame we slowly advanced to him, side by side, quite silently, and with fiml\ndecision of manner, intending to show him our determination to enforce an\ninterview, and ask explanation for his intrusion. All! he is gone.\nThe second time I was reading an interesting book. L. looked up from her\nemployment and, seeing him, touched me gently (we were close together).\nwhen both of us made a sudden dart forward, only to find the spot vacant.\nwhich had, one instant previously, been occupied by his face and figure. It.\nis impossible that we can be mistaken or deceived. No, no, we are not.\nThere is no misapprehension, because no fear quells our courage j no\ncowardice prevents the full action of our powers of perception j no alaml\nfrustrates our intention of grappling with him ifwe can, or of pursuing him,\nor of holding him if we can come up with him. We are on our guard against.\nsurprise, and our nerves steady, prepared to make a decided unequivocal\nefl'ort to find out who and what this nocturnal intruder may be.\nBut nothing avails j he is not here j he is not anywhere near. Looking\nkeenly at him one moment, the next he has fled, quick as a flash of lightning.\nBut he wcu standing there j we both saw him, positively and undoubtedly.\n* * * * * *\nIt is useless to contend against facta. Nervous terrors and timorous\nimaginations have nothing whatever to do in suggesting the various\nappearances and the indescribable sounds which pervade tlle rooms, the\ncomers, and the recesses of this great house. Superstition might indeed\nlupply one person with food for miracles or for belief in deception and\nwitchcraft j but when there are several witnesses of all ages there must be a.\nfoundation of truth, and, at all events, each and every one could not be\ndeceived. If all that is going on here is a strange delusion, then all would\nnot be affected at the same moment. If it is but a mere sensation or impres-\nsion, then it would only be conceived by one mind, not by all. If it were\ncapable of detection, then so many persons gathered together would surely\nfind out that it was imposture and deception.\nBesides, there is nothing done to annoy anyone of us j no attempt is\nmade to frighten or even to surprise us. There seems no system or organisa-\ntion in all these mysteries. In addition to the little old woman who goes\nabout the upper floor, and the man who comes occasionally upon the stairs.\nK\nDigitized by Google\n\f130 P1IAntaBm8 of the Dead. [April 24,\nthere are other sights and sounds, and other nocturnal disturbances. Very\noften a babe is heard wailing and crying in the kitchen, generally in the\nevening. We heard these piteous wailings when we first came here to live,\nand then imagined that a babe was really within hearing; but when, after\nthe lapse of many months, the sounds were still those of a new-born babe,\nno stronger in tone or di1l'erent in expreBBion, then we began to wonder, and\nto strive to penetrate the mystery, and are constrained to believe that no\nliving infant caU8eB those sounds.\nThen again,close to my bedroom door, in a receBB, there are notes of the\nmost mournful singing the ear can hear-real notes-soft and sad, but clear\nand thrilling. Then, in an instant, the notes are prolonged, and change\ninto short, sharp screams of agony. Then total silence.\nAll this takes place in the very interior of the house-in parts where\nthere is no outside wall, but where the wall, thick and maBBive, divides one\nroom from another.\nIncredulous as my husband has always been when I have complained of\nour incomprehensible and Bpectral visitants, yet last night he was penetrated\nwith the belief that there must be truth in our representations, at all events.\nSo deeply is he impreBBed by the solemn aB8urance of his own scrutiny that\na vision did really appear to him, that doubting, unbelieving, and sceptic as\nhe is, he confeBBes himself thrilled and pervaded with unwonted sensations\nof awe and excitement. I mUBt write it down. It all happened in this way :-\nAfter all outer doors were shut and busineBB hours over, my husband had\nfor several evenings past devoted his leisure to writing, and to sorting the\npiles of letters and papers which had accumulated during his illneBB. Corre-\nspondence was behindhand ; so shutting himself up in his own private office,\nhe directed all his thoughts, energy, and attention to reducing the number of\nletters unanswered, and arranging papers and documents in their several\nplaces. His orders were peremptory to the servants to allow no one to\ndisturb him, and I took my part in securing to him that perfect freedom\nfrom interruption, BO absolutely needed in such an occupation.\nThis evening the Bilence in the houBe was almoBt oppreBBive. My husband\nhad not once come up to the drawing-room since he left it after dinner. It\nwas now 11 o'clock, and the hour for the Bervants to retire for the night,\nexcept when we had company. I Bat with the door open that evening. I have\na habit ofdoing this when I am alone. The large landing and the outletgiveB\nmore freedom and air. The door of the kitchen iB in close proximity-an\nouter door-and alwaYB kept shut. OppoBite the drawing-room door, acroBB\nthe landing, is the Btaircase, the balustrade of the stairB forming one Bide of\nthe landing. All at once there was a great tramping upon the office-floor\nbelow; the door of the private office was flung open with much violence. My\nllUsband, in angry tones, called to the servant, and demanded \"how they\ndare permit a stranger to come to him at that time of night 1\" Which servant\nhad disobeyed him 1\nNo one had done so.\n\" Don't deny it. Who is the woman 1 When did she come, and what\ndoes she want 1 I Bee no one at this hour of the night.

It was in vain that\nthe servants protested they had let no one in ; and had seen no one pass up\nor down the stairs, that every door and window was fastened and secure.\nAstonishment kept my husband mute; he stood still, lost to all outward\nimpreBSions for some time, like one in a dream. Then, with a sort of\nshudder he moved away from the door of his office, from whence he had not\nstirred, and told the servants to go to bed; he would find out on the morrow\nwho had taken the liberty of intruding, or perhaps, the person would call\nagain in the morning.\nThis was to them, but as soon as we were alone he told me all that had\noccurred. . \u2022 \u2022 . . . Absorbed in deep thought, searching amongst\nhis papers for one of great importance, he raised his head from them, and\nsaw, just within his office doorway, a little old lady standing. Even though\nan unwelcome intruder, his politeneBS did not fail; so rising directly he ad-\ndressed her. Finding that she neither spoke nor moved, but only looked at\nhim, he advanced a little, speaking again. This forward movement made no\nalteration; still she wa.a mute, still not a finger stirred, the eyes still fixed\nupon him with a soft, sweet expression, the face very pallid. After allowing\nsufficient time for a reply (even if the old lady should be short of breath\nfrom coming upstairs), and still receiving none, he approached nearer, when\nshe moved gradually and softly a little farther into the room, yet scarcely\nnearer to him, for the room is very spacious. Again he altered his position\nwhile she remained motionleBS, thus bringing himself into closer contact with\nher; still she was motionleBS.\nMaking now a quick step towards her, determined to ascertain the cause\nof her sileBce-Io ! she was gone! To lUs amazement he lost all trace of her\nin one moment. It was then we must have heard the commotion below.\n. . After telling me thus far, my husband paused in his narrative.\nAgain he was wrapt in deep meditation. His face was agitated, his lips\nquivered; evidently he was mastering strong emotion. Rousing himself\nfrom the reverie which I had allowed to remain unbroken, he continued to\nrelate the incidents of the visit, and his own conclusions upon it.\nWell, he said he didn't know whether his office door was open while she\nwaa there ; he knew that he had, shut it, and did not recollect opening it\nwhen he missed her from the room. The gas was giving a full blaze of light,\nand no shadow of darkness rested anywhere to deceive him. The whole place\nwaa illumined.\nNo suspicion entered his mind of anything like visionary object or\napparitions ; his whole attention was rivetted upon his letters and papers,\nand his only idea was that this old lady was in some great trouble, had come\nto him for advice, and that her age and probable distreBS might be the excuse\nfor her untimely visit. It was with such considerations that he first\naddreBSed her as he would any lady who came to him upon office busineBS,\nbut afterwards, when he became annoyed by her silence, he permitted his\nirritation to be visible both in voice and manner.\nHis description of her appearance is this,:-\" A little old lady, with a very\npale face, and her hands clasped before her, a cap round her face, and a dark\nbonnet, with strings tied under her chin.\" When I asked him what dreBS,\nK 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f132 Phanta8m8 oj the Dead. [Apri124,\nthen he is atfault. He only sawa dark fonn. Well, he cannot say, he was only\nlookingat her face. It must have been a dark dress, he believes-it looked\ndark. She moved with a gentle, gliding motion j looked at him mostintentlyj\ndid not move her hands. His face is quite troubled, and he is much excited.\nSays that he feels bewildered and embarrassed, and is most unwilling to\nadmit the reality of the vision.\nI believe that he would not have nanled it at all could he have anticipated\nthe tennination of the scene. As it is, no explanation can do away with the\nfact, and it is useless to deny whathe has once admitted. Either way, he is\nin a dilemma, from which he cannot escape. He SUlllS it all up by saying,\n\" I have told you exactly what took place. I know what I saw, and am quite\naware that it cannot be explained. As it is, so let it rest.\" He will never\nagain laugh at us for our absurd notions and experiences of \"ghosts,\" I am\nquite certain. He is touched in a way that he himself cannot comprehend.\nHe does not like it-his own feelings puzzle hilll. It will be a long time\nbefore he loses the novel inlpreasion aroused in his mind by that visit of\u00b7 our\nlittle old lady, who seems to wander about our house whenever and whereso-\never she pleases.\nIn the above narrative I only wish to lay stress on the appearance\nof the little old lady. The man on the stairs, who seems to have ap-\npeared always in the same place and to ha'\"e been seen from the same\npoint of \"iew, may possibly have been an illusion; and the sounds, as\nMrs. Simpson suggests, may have been due to wind.\nIt should be noted that though Miss Mary Vatas-Simpson has not\nat any other time seen apparitions, the family seem to have a special\nfaculty for doing so. Mrs. Vatas-Simpson and another of her daughters\nhave seen them in two or three houses besides this one, but quite\ndifferent in each house. Mrs. Vatas-Simpson has also, it would seem,\nsome power of receiving telepathic communications (as one would,\nperhaps, expect to be the case with a person who sees ghosts, supposing\nthese to be a form of communication with the dead), for she has given\nus an account of several veridical dreams about a son absent in\nAustralia, between whom and herself there was a very close sym-\npathy.\nIn the narrative I will next quote (G. 108), it will be seen that the\nghost, which has a. very well marked character, apparently followed\nthe principal percipient from one house to another.\nThe committee are not a.llowed to give names, and the initials\nused are not the right ones. Mr. Podmore says: \" Miss A. T., a younger\nsister of the principal percipient, Miss T., related to me the incidents\ndescribed below in great detail, and after questioning her at some\nlength, I drew up the following account in her presence, reading over\nto her each paragraph as it was written. Miss A. T. has not actually\nseen the figure herself, but she has heard the particulars of each\nappearance from the witnesses of it, when the details were still fresh\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J Pkanta8m8 of tke Dead. 133\nin their memory, and she has repeatedly heard the whole matter dis\ncussed in family conclave, when the disturbances were still going on.\nMoreover, she has herself heard some of the strange noises described.\nThe account has since been read through by Miss T. herself, and\nthough she declines to give us any further particulars, she admits that\nthis account is 'fairly correct.' Though the narrative, therefore, faUd in\nvalue somewhat below a first-band account it is very far superior to an\nordinary second-band ghost story, and may, I think, be taken as almost\nentirely correct.\nMrs. T. and the unmarried brother mentioned in the narrative\nare both dead. The family, it should be added, have again removed,\nbuttbe ghost has not, apparently, followed them.\"\nIn 1870 the T-- family took a house in West Brompton on lease for\nseven years. They entered the house in the spring of that year. This house,\nit would appear, is now, and has been since 1877, in the occupancy of Captain\nF--. Captain F-- has been asked by a friend of the T-- family\nwhether anything unusual has occurred in the house du~ his tenancy, and\nhe bas replied in the negative. There would seem, however, to be some\nreason for doubting the accuracy of this statement.\nNothing remarkable occurred during the fi1'st 18 months of the T--\nfamily occupying the house. In the autumn of 1871, when Mrs. T-- and\nMiss T-- were going upstairs to bed, leaving the hall in total darkness,\nMiss T--, who was then on one of the upper landings, thought she heard\nher brother entering the house, and looked over the bannisters. She saw a\ngrey figure leave the dining-room, cross the hall, and disappear down the\nkitchen stairs. Miss T-- told nobody of what she had seen. This was the\nfirst time that anything abnormal was seen in the house.\nDuring their tenancy of the house this same figure was seen repeatedly\nby at least five independent witnesses,* Miss T-- being the one who saw it\nmost frequently. The figure was very taIl, dressed in grey drapery. The\ndrapery also partially enveloped' the head, though allowing the features to be\nseen. The\" grey\" was a light grey-perhaps such a colour as a white object\nwould assume in partial darkness. The hands, it would seem, hung down\nand were clasped in front of the figure. The expression of the face was very\n<l8lm and peaceful-a good face. There was no hair on the face, and it was\nonly from the unusual height of the figure that it was supposed to be that of\na man.\nThere was nothing indistinct about the outline of the figure. The drapery\nwas shapeless-that is, it had no definite shape, such as that of a dressing:\ngown, or a monk's gown, -but the lines of it were firm and clear. But the\nwhole figure was shadowy and unsubstantial-looking. It was never seen save\nin the dark, and would appear, therefore, to have been faintly luminous, for\nit was seen in all parts of the house, and sometimes in rooms almost entirely\ndark. The figure was seen chiefly in Miss T--'s room, or on the landing\nnear; but it was also seen on the bath-room steps, on the stairs, in the\n* It does D:lt seem quite clear that the figure wa.'1 always identical.\nDigitized by Google\n\f134 Phantasms of the Dead. [Apri124,\ndining\u00b7room, and in other bedrooms. The figure never moved its head or\nhanda, and never spoke or made, apparently, any Bound (with one exception\nto be noted below).\nSometimes Mias T-- would see it when in bed, and Bhe would then\nfrequently put her head under the clothes to avoid it. But if she saw it\nwhen she was about the houBe she would always look at it wltil the figure\nvanished. But she is quite unable to say whether she looked at it for\nminutes or seconds. It would finally vanish quite suddenly. Occaaionally,\nhowtlver, it would glide away into another room. The figure never walked;\nit glided. There was never any BOund accompanying its movements.\nThe figure was next Been by an old nurse, Mrs. N--, who met it on\nthe stairs (1 in the autumn of the same year, 1871). She looked at\nthe figure until it vanished. She also told nobody at the time of what she\nhad seen.\nSome time afterwards a friend of the family was staying in tlle house.\nShe complained, on the morning after her arrival, that she had been kept\nawake by the noise of furniture, &c., being moved about in the rooms above\nher. These rooms were occupied, and no one else had heard the noises com-\nplained of. But the occurrence led to a general family diacuasion. Unac-\ncountable noises had been often heard before in the house, and Mias T--\nand Mrs. N-- then mentioned, for the first time, the figure which they\nhad seen.\nMr. T--, the brother, also saw the figure frequently; on one OCC&Bion\nit was in the hall, when he opened the front door. On another when re-\nturning from his club late one night, he saw the figure from the street, stand-\ning at the drawing-room window.\nMias T-- frequently saw the figure in her room standingat her bedside,\nand on the landing near her room. Sometimes she woke in tlle night, and\nfound it at her bedside.\nN--, the cook, complained angrily to his wife that one of the other\nservants would Bometimes come into his room at night. He had, at that\ntime, not heard of the figure being seen, but he Bubsequently connected\nthese appearances with the figure.\nR-- T--, then a little boy of seven, was sleeping in the same room\nas Miss T--. He complained one mornulg that he had had a \"horri<l\nnight\" I he had been awake, and had seen L- (MisB T--) standing at\nhis bedside in her night-dreBB, \"only it wasn't L-.\" Of course, nothing\nhad ever been told the child about the figure which had been seen. It is not\nclear whether any peculiar feelings accompanied the appearance of the figure;\nbut Mias T-- when in her room, frequently expreBBed a feeling which she\nsays is quite indescribable. This feeling she always attributed to the pre-\nsence of a figure in the room, though she was unable on Buch OCC&Biona to\nsee it.\nMias T-- would very often hear footsteps and Bighs in her room, as if\nsomeone were walking about and sighing. The most unaccountable noises\nwere heard all over the house throughout the whole of these seven yeara-\nmost frequently in the autumn. Footsteps, knocks at the door, bella rung\nin the daytime, &c., &c. There were also noises as ifa heavy weight, sucb\nas a bundle of clothes, had been dropped from a great beigbt on to one of\nDigitized by Google\n\f188ts.] PhantaB1M of the Dead. 135\nthe landinga-the sound was loud, but muftled. These noises, except the\nbell-ringing, were heard almost invariably at night.\nSometimes two or three people heard the noises, or were woke up by them.\nAt other times only one person would hear them. On one New Year's Eve,\nwhen Miss T-- and N-- were alone in the house, N-- came up from\nthe kitchen to the dining-room where Mill T-- W88 sitting, to see what\nwas the matter. He had heard loud noiaea, 88 of furniture being dragged\nabout in the dining-room. Miss T-- had heard nothing, and the house\nseen.ed perfectly quiet.\nOn another occasion Mill T-- heard tlle same noise, as of furniture\nbeing moved, &c., in the room above hers, which was occupied by her\nbrother, Mr. T--. She weilt up to see what was the matter, and knocked\nat his door, but h. was fast asleep. These noises, as of furniture being moved\nabout-always in the room above-were of frequent occurrence.\nThis house formerly belonged to a Mr. G--, an artist, who has now sold\nit. He was very anxious for Mrs. T-- to buy it. A few months after the\nT-- family had been in the house, and before they had experienced any-\nthing unusual, Mr. G-- came to Bee Mrs. T-- and asked her if Bhe was\nquite comfortable in the house. AB she rented the house unfurnished, the\nquestion Btruck her as odd, and Bhe remarked upon it at the time.\nIn the autumn of 1877 the T-- family removed to another house in tile\nsame neighbourhood, where they remained until April, 1880. Miaa T--\nwas abroad during the winters of 1877 and 1878 ; but was in the houBe during\nthe Bummer months of the latter year. She tinally returned in tile Bpring of\n1879. Itis to be noted that the T--'B had never mentioned the Bubject\nof visions and disturbances to even tIleir most intimate friends whilst they\nwere still in the first house, but on leaving tile houBe, believing themselves\nto be free from their persecutors, tIley mentioned the Bubject freely. In the\nspring of 1879 Miaa T-- heard the sa.me noise as before-footstepB and\nsighs-but fainter. They gradually, however, increased in intenBity until\nthey became as bad as ever. She did not mention the subject. The noiBeB,\nhowever, in tile autumn were heard by all tile household-including Miaa A.\nT--, my informant, who being only a child, had not heard tIlem in the\nother houBe. They were even more loud and frequent than hitherto, and\ntheircbaracterhad somewhat changed. FootstepB were heard as before;\ndoors were banged, where no doors or only locked doors were; tIlere was a\nnoise as of a metal tea tray being rolled downstairs.\nThere was, also, frequently a Bound of a person breathing heavily, and\nwalking about, heard in the bedrooms. Knocks two or three times repeated\nwere also heard at the doors.\nA married brother was staying in tile houBe witll his wife and little girl of\nthree years. Onenight theyall three heard tile soundas of a person walking\nupand down the room and breathing loudly. Mrs. T-- struck a light and\nlit the gas, when tile noises ceased. They recommenced, however, when the\ngas was turned out.\nOne night in September, 1879, when H-- T--, a boy of thirteen, had\nbeen ill for many months, and was sleeping in tile back dining-room, with\nMrs. T-- in the sa.me room to attend upon him, they both heard a noise\nas of a door opening into a third room on the dining-room floor being\nDigitized by Google\n\f136 Pllantasma of the Dead. [Apri124,\nopened, and the window of that room being thrown open. The door then\nbanged, and a match was heard to be struck outside. All the household were\nupstairs in bed, and the boy became ill with fright. Mrs. T-- had to\nattend at once to him and 80 did not open the door. In the morning the\nwindow was found bolted, and the door of the back room locked.\nThis noise, as of a match being struck, was afterwards heard several\ntimes, both in the middle of the day and night, and by several persons. Also\nill different parts of the house ; but always outside a door.\nFrom this time, until the date of the boy's death, a fortnight or three\nweeks afterwards, the noises were louder than at any other time, and\ndisturbed the boy's rest at night.\nOn Christmas Day, 1879, Miss T--, going to early service, saw the\nfigure standing just below her, at the top of the bath-room stairs. She saw\nthe figure again that afternoon at the foot of her bed, when she had gone up\nin the dusk without a light. She saw the figure again, more tIu.n once\nbefore she left the house. On one occasion, when sleeping in the salue room\nwith Mrs. T--, Miss T-- woke and saw the figure standing between the\nbeds, near the foot. There was a noise as of a parcel being dropped on the\nfioor, and the figure vanished. The noise woke Mrs. T--, who wanted to\nknow what was the matter.\nA child of three years (the same as before mentioned) woke up one night\nwith a scream, saying that something had come to take her a.way. After this\noccasion the child refused to be left alone, as long as she stayed in the house.\nA housemaid met the figure standing on the stairs one evening, and ran\ndown ingreat fear to tell the otherservants.\nA nurse, on another occasion, saw a figure which she supposed at the time\nto be that of her mistreBS, leaving the bedroom at night.\nIt is to be noted that during these nine years Mrs. T.-- and Miss A.\nT--, and two younger children, who were constantly living in the house,\nnever saw the figure. Nor did any other members of the family, except\nthose mentioned, though an elder brother stayed until 1875 with hiB family\nin the first house, and a cousin lived with them for 18 months in the second\nhouse.\nIt will be observed that in the cases I have quoted or mentioned the\nghost has not been traced beyond a single occupancy of the house, except\nin the oneinstance where its character seemed to change with the tenants\nto whom it appeared. It is true that in other cases there are vague\nreports of previous haunting, but:nothing that can be relied on. Nothing\ncan be inferredfrom this, however, as, except in the case of the weeping\nghost in widow's garb, where we seem pretty clearly to have heard\nabout the beginning of the haunting, there is no more evidence of the\nghost's previous Lon-appearance than there is of its appearance.\nThere is in certain cases evidence of the apparently complete cessa-\ntion of haunting, but here again it is difficult to draw any certain in-\nference, because the analogy of experimental thought-tranaferencewould\ncertainlylead us to expect that the faculty for seeing ghosts should varyin\ndifferent people and at different times, so that the apparent absence of\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J Phanta8m8 0\/ the Dead. 137\nthe ghost might arise simply from the a.bsence of anyone capable of\nseeing it, and because the long and irregular intervals that are liable to\noccur between manifestations make it difficult to determine what length\nof interval warrants us in concluding that there will be no more. It is\nworth while, however, in this connection, to give a narrative (G. 317) of\na ghost traced back through a considerably longer period than any\nother yet, I think, in the collection. I give it with some hesitation, as we\nhave it only at second-hand, and it, and in a less degree the narrative last\nquoted, and one given as an example of collective hallucination,\nare the only ones that I shall give in this paper where none of the most\nimJ)Ortant evidence is at first-hand, but it seems to be carefully\ntold, and, I should think, may safely be trusted for its main statements.\nIt is much to be regretted that after taking the trouble to make the\ninvestigation Mr. Hill did not take the additional trouble to record the\nresults in writing. The narrative is given to us by the Rev. Chas. O.\nStarbuck, Andover, Mass., U.S.A., a Congregational minister, and de-\nscribed by Mr. Alfred R. Nichols, of 32, Lawrence Hall, Oambridge,\nMass., as\" a man of much scholarship and absolute trustworthiness.\"\nI wish to give an account of what I call \"a well authenticated apparition.\"\nI wish to give it, not because it is any better attested than a hundred others,\nnor because it is in the least startling, for a quieter ghost never was; but\nbecause there is so little in it that is unique, and it is therefore an excellent\ntype of the better sort of such accounts, and because the facts are such as\ncannot poBSibly be strained into an explanation that treats them as the effects\nof one or two excited imaginations, and also because their entire want of\npurpose or dramatic effect makes them more credible, and lastly, because they\nrest on so eminent and unimpeachable all authority. They were communi-\ncated to me in all their details, and in repeated conversations, by the late\nHon. Richard Hill, of the Island of Jamaica. Mr. Hill iwas a gentleman\nof eminent character and worth, a privy councillor of the island, but much\nmore distinguished as the most eminent naturalist of the West Indies.\nCharles Kingsley, in his chn.rming book on the West Indics, speaks of Mr.\nHill as a man whom it was an honour to know, and regrets that not visiting\nJamaica he had not had the opportunity to enjoy his acquaintance. He died\nabout six years ago in the fulne88 of years and honours, and in the fulne88\nof a Christian faith.\nMr. Hill, somewhere, I believe, about 1840, took a house in Spanishtown,\nthe capital of Jamaica. The house was of brick, and was thought by Mr. Hill,\nwho was a great antiquary, to have been built before 1655,ata time when St.\nJ ago de 10. Vega was still a Spanish city. There was nothing remarkable\nabout the dwelling beyond any other house suited for the use of a family\nin good circumstances. Mr. Hill, it appears, moved into it quite unaware\nthat there was anything connected with it above the common. Nor, in the\nseries of facts which he related to me, are there more than one or two which\nof themselves amount to anything. It is the combination alone which gives\nthem importance.\nMr. Hill, I may remark, was a bachelor, and his widowed sister, Mrs.\nDigitized by Google\n\f138 Pluznta8m8 of the Dead. [April 24,\nHarrison, lived with him and kept house for him. The shutters of his bed-\nroom were each in two pieces. One night it chanced that the upper pieces\nhad been leftopen, and the rain had beaten in. In the morning he complained\nto his sister, who promised that the neglect should not occur again. The\nDext evening he was lying in bed awake, while a faint light came into the\nroom from a hall lamp that shone through the transom. While lying thus\nhe saw the door opened, and a woman enter the room, crou the floor to the\nwindow, and, as it seemed to him, look up at it. Her face was mumed, and\nher whole garb peculiar, but, in the faint light, he supposed her to be Ann,\nhis sister's confidential servant. He took it for granted that having just\nbethought herself of the shutters, she had come in, unaware that he was in\nthe room, to make sure that they were duly fastened. The woman then\nturned and went out, but as she was leaving the room Mr. Hill called\n\"Ann!\" She gave no answer, and closed the door. Supposing that she\nwas startled at finding that he was in bed, he thought nothing of it. In the\nmorning he casually remarked to his sister that Ann had been in his room\nthe night before, and had been thrown quite out of countenance by discover-\ning that he was in bed and awake. \" Oh !\" said his sister, \"Ann would\nhave known better than to go into your room at such an hour.\" She then\nsummoned Ann, who confirmed her mistreu's statement, but intimated,\nwith a mysterious look, that she could give an opinion as to who the\nintruder was. Mr. Hill then learned that whispers were current in the\nhousehold to the effect that there was something more than natural in\nthe new house. On what these surmises were founded will presently\nappear.\nMrs. Harrison herself had thus far not soen the strange visitor, and her\nlittle experience with her would not have amounted to much taken by itself.\nHer bedroom opened into the dining-room, into which a door also opened\nfrom the hall, or from some other room, upon two orthree steps. TIlls door\nwas at the head of Mrs. Harrison's bed, divided from it by the partition. One\nnight Mrs. Harrison heard it open, and someone come down into the dining-\nroom. She was startled, but presently concluded that a chance breeze had\nblown the door open and deceived her oar by counterfeiting the sound of\nfootsteps. The next night, however, the door was unmistakably opened by\nsomeone who came down the steps and began pacing round and round the\ndining-table. Mrs. Harrison was now thoroughly frightened, although what\nhad happened acquired significance only from its fitting in so perfectly wit!.\nwhat took place at other times.\nThe second time Mr. Hill saw his former visitor he had been asleep,\nand awakened with a start, such as we sometimos give when another is\nPzing at us. He found her standing at the foot of the bed, and apparently\nlooking fixedlydown at him, although the mumer which she appeared to wear\nconcealed her face. He asked her who she was, and what she wanted. She\nmade no answer, but turned and went out.\nPutting together his own remembrances and the description of others\nwho had seen her, he came to the conclusion that she wore the garb which\nwas in use in the colony in the reign of George the First, that is about 116\nyears earlier.\nHe only knew of her coming once again into his bedroom. There was\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J Plulntrmns qf tke Dead. .139\nan old negro woman, to whom, in the intermediate period of apprenticeship\nbetween slavery and full freedom, which prevailed in the island between 1834\nand 1838, he had, as stipendiary magistrate, placed in charge of the interesta\nof the half-emancipated negroes, had opportunity to show peculiar kindness.\nThe old woman's gratitude, like a true negro's, knew no bounds. When-\never she came into Spanishtown from her little place a few miles out, she\nwould be sure to visit her benefactor, bringing some little present-a few\ncocoanuts, a few yams, or a bunch of bananas. And once, when he was\nabsent from town, her gratitude took the grotesque form of insisting on\nbeing allowed to spread her mat at night in his bedroom and sleep there.\nMrs. Harrison humoured her; but in the night the door opened, and thia\nmysterious lady came in. It must be that the old woman had never been\ntold of her, or else even her gratitude would never have given her the\ncourage to sleep in a haunted spot. However thia may be, she at once\nsurmised a ghost, and rushing out in great affright, dragged her mat to the\nstable, md spent the rest of the night there.\nAt another time a new servant-girl had just come. When night fell, she\nwas told to spread her mat in the veranda. Chairs were standing about here\nand there in it, as they had been used through the day. But in the dead of\nthe night the servant-maid heard them swung back, one by one, against the\nwall, andsome one begin to pace back and forth along the porch. Like a\ntrue negro, she too, surmised a ghost, and rushing into the bedroom of\nanother maidservant, squeezed herself into bed with her as well as she could.\nIn the morning she tremulously asked Mrs. Harrison: .. Missis, do 'perrita\nwalk thia house? \" Whether she soon left, I cannot say, but my impression\nia that myfriend was obliged to submit to pretty frequent changes of servants\nabout this time, though I cannot be sure that I was so informed.\nAnother person, a former servant, had more nerve. This was a respect-\nable and estimable mulatto woman who had had the charge of Mrs. Harrison's\nlittle girl in her infancy. Shecame once to pay a visit to herformermistresa\nand her little foster child, and at night she spread her mat for rest in an\nunfurnished chamber, through the windows of which the full tropical moon-\nlight poured in. The next morning she said to Mrs. Harrison: \"Misais, did\nyou come into my room last night 1\" Mrs. Harrison, at once imagining\nwhat had happened, replied evasively, wishing to lead the nurse to believe\nthat she had. But she was not to be deceived. .. Oh, no,\" she said, \"it\nwas not you. You do not wear --,\" mentioning a kind of slipper,\ndragging at the heel, the name of which I cannot recall, but which is now\nworn only by the women of the common people, and which, I fancy, is going\nout of use even among them, having probably, like so many styles,\ndescended to them from a higher rank. The nurse then went on to say that\nin the night the door of her sleeping-room opened, and thia same lady\n(whom, having seen in the full moonlight, she was able to describe), came\nin, and began to march round and round her milt, apparently looking down\nfixedly at her, although I do not think that at this time, or any other time,\nher muftler even permitted her face to be seen. The worthy nurse was\nterribly frightened, but being a woman of great nerve she held her ground,\nand after a while her unwelcome visitant went out.\nOne day, before or after this (for I am unable to give the sequence of\nDigitized by Google\n\f140 Pllantasms of the Dead. [April 24,\nthese incidents), Mrs. Harrison, being indisposed, sent out a female servant\nto bring her a cup of tea or something of the sort from the kitchen, which,\nas usual there, was a little distance away-acrou a paved yard. The servant\nmet this lady midway, and supposing her to be some stranger, and probably\nsurprised to find one dreBBed so strangely wandering about the servants,\nquarters, asked her what she wanted. She turned, and with some sharp-\nneBB retorted: II What is that to you 1\" This was tlle only time she is ever\nknown to have spoken. ABBuming her to have been from ilie oilier side, it\nwould seem as ifnot even death could extinguish the slave-holding pride of\nan old colonist. Search was made for her, after the servant had returned to\nmake report to her mistreBB, but she was not to be found.\nOne day Mrs. Harrison was receiving a call from anoilier lady in tlle\ndrawing-room, which on one side opened on the veranda. Mrs. Harrison's\nlittle daughter and ilie little daughter of her visitor were in one of the\nwindows looking out upon the veranda while their mothers were talking.\nSuddenly ilie children uttered an exclamation, and the ladies, looking up,\nsaw this same strange visitor paBBing the window at which their daughters\nwere sitting. She appeared to be coming from the street, and to be going\ntowards ilie other end of the veranda, at which there was only a window.\nAll four looked into the gallery after her, but shewas gone.\nBy iliis time Mr. Hill began til be greatly interested in his mysterious\nguest, or hosteBB, as we mny choose to take it. He therefore determined to\nsound his landlord, a young gentleman to whom the house had passed from\nan uncle. As I believe his name to have been Osborne, I shall call him so.\n10 Mr. Osborne,\" said his tenant one day, \"iliere is an interesting\npeculiarity about your house, as to which I wish to question you. I hope\nyou will answer me frankly, for, in my mind, it adds ten pounds a year to\nthe value of ilie house, so you need not be afraid I am going to beat you\ndown in the rent.\" He then described iliese various appearances, and\nadded: \"Now what I want to ask you is, was this visitor known here in\nyour uncle's time 1\" \"Since you iliink so well of her, Mr. Hill,\" answered\nhis landlord, \"I will be fra.nk I wiili you. She was well known here in my\nuncle's time.\" Mr. Hill next, being or becoming acquainted wiili a ladywho\nhad been in her youth a frequent visitor at the house, asked her what she\nknew of this mysterious stranger. This friend informed him that tho\nunbidden guest was as familiar then as she had been since be had become a\nten..'lnt. He then prosecuted his inquiries through the little city of 7,000\npe{\\ple, and was able to trace her back to about 1806, at which time, he was\n&B8ured by his informants, no one knew how much longer she had been\naccustomed to frequent the house. At that time, he was told, the bouse\nwa'S conveyed by its owner, a Mrs. Deane, or some such name, to a pur-\nchaser. As the parties to the sale were sitting in the drawing-room, about\nto sign the necessary documents, this same lady was seen, as once after-\nwards, to pass along the veranda in front of the drawing.room windows.\nOne of the compa.ny, noticing her quaint, unaccustomed attire, asked Mrs.\nDeane who that old-fashioned visitor of hers was. \"Oh,\" said she care-\nleBBly, .. it is a neighbour of ours who comes in occasionally,\" and the\nmatter paBBed.\nI may remark that, although this personage sometimes appeared to come\nDigitized by Google\n\f1885.J Pkanta8m8 of file Dead. 141\nfrom the street, or to go towards it, Mr. Hill's inquiries brought no informa-\ntion that she had ever been seen outside of his house and court-yard. This,\nin a IIIllIill city of 7,OOOinhabitants, the great bulk of whom were negroes,\ncuts off the supposition that she could have harboured elsewhere, and re-\nIIOrted at all times of day and night to a neighbouring house. This would\nbe an incredible explanation even if it only applied to a year or two. Applied\nto a space of time outnumbering a generation, and extending back beyond a\ntime within the memory of anyone knoWJl to Mr. Hill that was acquainted\nwith the house, the explanation becomes simply preposterous.\nIn 1848 the interior of the house was completely remodelled, and she was\nnever seen again. It was not that any hidden passages were blocked up, for\nthe house had nothing mysterious about it except its mysterious visitor.\nBut inside it was no longer the same dwelling. It appeared, as Mr.\nHill said, as if she had permission to abide so long as things were as they\nhad been.\nHad such an inexplicable manifestation occurred to one alone, or to more\nthan one whose minds were full of the story, or in one part of the house, or\nonly at night, or for a few months, a plausible explanation would be easier.\nBut, as the account shows, she was seen at all times of the day and of the\nnight, in various parts of the house and in the court-yard, by persons who\nhad heard of her and by persons who had never heard of her; by persons\nwho, when they saw her, at once imagined her to be a ghost, and by persons\nwho never suspected but that she was a li\"ing woman; while, of the latter,\nIIOme came to believe her a spirit, and lOme remained wholly unaware that\nshe was suspected to be anything of the kind. This last point alone is not\ncovered by anything that occurred during Mr. Hill's occupancy of the house,\nalthough it is reasonably well attested.\nI may remark that Mr. Hill, having African blood in his veins, may be\npresumed to have inherited with it a certain share of superstition; yet he\nwas an eminently well educated man, schooled in England, and accustomed,\nthrough a long life, to the close observation and weighing of facts, both as a\nmagistrate and IL8 a naturalist. Before I had ever heard of the existence of\nCharles Darwin from anyone else, Mr. Hill mentioned him to me as an able\nyoung correspondent of his, and quoted with just gratification a sentence of\na recent letter from Darwin to him: \"You are an observer after my oWJl\nheart.\" And in the previous narrative all that is really involved is his\nveracity, which is unimpeached. The facts were, for the moat part, such as\noccurred to others, and tlle combination of them is, of course, open to allY\none to make for himself. He affected no mystery, and made no confidence\nof it, but freely communicated all the particulars to anyone of bis numerous\nvisitors who showed any dtlBire to ascertain them. I may remark that, rich\nas Jamaica and the other Antilles preawnablyare in ghostly legends, Mr.\nHill, during my wng acquaintance with him, never adverted to one of them.\nThe spirit of the precise antiquary always prevailed in him over that of the\nstory teller. And in his individual experience, with one exception,*I ne,'er\nlearned that anything had ever happened which bore the stamp of a visit\nfrom beyond the grave.\n\u2022 This one exception was the appearance of a friend apparently at the moment\nof death.\nDigitized by Google\n\f142 Phanta8m8 oj' the Dead. [Apri124,\nThere are in the collection perhaps half-a-dozen other well-attested\nnarratives of similar apparitions in the same house to different persons.\nwho cannot easily be supposed to have been in a state of excited\nexpectation; but, for various reasons, they do not seem to me quite\non a par, from an evidential point of view, with those above given;\nthough they certainly ought not to be left out of account in estimating\nthe whole evidence. It is, of course, quite possible by supposing a\nsufficient amount of unconscious inaccuracy-varied occasionally by\nconscious or semi-conscious inventiveness-on the part of our witnesses,\nto explain away all these narratives, and any number of similar ones\nthat may be hereafter collected. And, as I have already said, we\nhave no exact measure by which to compare the improbability of the\nrequired amount of inaccuracy or inventiveness with the improbability\ninvolved in supposing the narratives to be substantially true. Hence\nI can only say that having made every effort - as my papt'r\nwill, I hope, have shown-to exercise a reasonable scepticism, I yet\ndo not. feel equal to the degree of unbelief in human testimony necessary\nto avoid accepting at least provisionally the conclusion that there are, in a\ncertain sense, haunted houses, i.e., that there are houses in which\nsimilar quasi-human apparitions have occurred at different times to\ndifferent inhabitants, under circumstances which eXJlude the hypothesis\nof suggestion or expectation. If this general conclusion be accepted,\nthe evidence for the authenticity of the particular narratives here given\nappears to me sufficiently good to justify us in regarding them pro-\nvisionally as accounts, in the main accurate, of actual experiences, and,\naccordingly, I propose to review and compare these experiences care-\nfully, in order to ascertain what positive or\" negative characteristics\nthey have in common, and what explanation, if any, their common\ncharacteristics suggest.\nIn the first place, we find no foundation for the very general idea\nthat ghosts haunt old houses only or even m'J.inly.\nSecondly, as I have already said, the evidence for appearances on\ncertain anniversaries rests, so far as this collecti?n is concerned, on one\natory only.\nThirdly, the evidence connecting such appearances with some crime\nor tragedy is extremely slight. }{r. X. Z. believes he identified his\nghost with a person who committed murder and suicide; the other\nghost, recognised from his portrait, had died of delirium tremem; but I\nhave adduced reasons for some slight doubt as to the unmistakable\nrecognition in both these cases. A native woman had been murdel'Pd near\nwhere the ayah appeared to Sir Arthur and Lady Becher. The ghost\nsupposed to be that of Miss A. vaguely resembled in figure a lady who had\nlived unhappily and died mysteriously in the house, and the weeping\nlady in widow's garb resembles in figure :I. former unhappy inmate.

In nine cases we have not only heard no rumour of a tragedy,\nbut no attempt is made to conjecture ;vhose ghost it is that is seen. In\nthe four remaining ones there is a report of a violent death, but 80\nvague and hazy as to suggest that it has arisen subsequently to the\nappearance, owing to the supposed necessity of accounting for it in\nsome such way. As regards identification, moreover, it must be\nobserved that in many cases-seven Clut of the eighteen I have discussed\n-there is not enough seen of the face to make certain recognition at all\npossible. In this connection there is a curious point to be noticed. In\nthese eighteen narratives we have no first-hand account of a ghost\nappearing undoubtedly in the dreSll of a distinctly bygone age. Mr.\nX. Z.'s ghost would apparently have been entitled to such a dress, but\nboth as a man and as a ghost he affected a dressing-gown, which is a\nvague costume. The blue lady in the old manor house appeared with\nher hair dressed in Hogarth fashion to one percipient, but we have his\naccount at second-hand only, and both the percipients whose accounts\nwe have at first-hand saw her with her hair down her back. Vague\ncostumes, not specially appropriate to any particular period, are some-\nwhat the most numerous in the eighteen selected cases, though in seven\nor eight of them the dress seems to have been such as would not at all\nhave surprised the percipients if worn by a living person in the day-\ntime. And tllese remarks apply not only to these eighteen narratives,\nbut with comparatively few exceptions to the whole collection. It is\ntherefore the more remarkable that among all the fixed local glw8t8\ndescribed in the collection, who, by their costume, would seem to be\nconnected with the more or less recently dead, we have no single case at\nfirst-hand, and I think only two dubious onas at second-hand, of an\napparition of anyone known to any of the percipients during life.\nFourthly, there is a total absence of any apparent object or\nintelligent action on the part of the ghost. If its visits have an object,\nit entirely fails to explain it. It does not communicate important facts.\nIt does not point out lost wills or hidden treasure. It does not even\nspeak, except in the instance mentioned by Mr. Hill, where the ghost\nreplied, \"What is that to you 7\" to an inquiry; but for this incident\nthere is at best third-hand evidence, and it may have been a mistake.\nIts very movements are of the simplest description in all the cases\nthat I have selected on evidential grounds.*\n\u2022 There is among the narratives which I have thought in BOme respects\ninsufficieutly evidenced, a case of a ghost alleged to ha\\'e been seen by one\nperson only, pointing out a missing will; and I will quote here an account\nof an apparition (G. 474) which went through very unusually dramatic\naction. I have not included it among the evidentially first\u00b7class instances\nof haun.ted hoUSel, because with the amount of detail given I am unable to\ndetermine whether the figure seen by different percipients was similar and\nseen independently.

They are seen in all kinds of light, from broad daylight to the\nfaint light of dawn-from bright gaslight to the light of a dying fire.\nSometimes they seem to be self-luminous, and sometimes to bring with\nthem, as it were, an apparition of light (like Mr. X. Z.'s ghost), 80 that\nthe whole place appears lighted up, though there is no real light there.\nThe ghost of the man who died of delirium tremens seemed to disappear\nowing to the gas being turned up; and on the other hand, some\napparitions, like ordinary external objects, can no longer be seen when\nthe light goes out. There is even one case where the ghost is described\nas having been apparently seen in the back of the percipient's head.\nSixthly, as to sounds, again no rule can be laid down. In some\ncases there are unaccounted-for sounds in houses where ghosts are seen,\nand in others no sounds beyond what may be noticed anywhere seem to\nhave been observed. 'Vhere there are mysterious sounds they have\nfor the most part no obvious connection with the apparitions. The\napparition itself rarely appears to make any noise. To hear its footsteps,\nfor instance, seems to be unusual. Sometimes an apparition seems to be\nheralded by a noise__ sound causing the percipient to look in the\ndirection in which they see the ghost, but it is difficult to say\nwhether these noises are not real, and their connection with the\nghost accidental.*\nis good. The percipient on this particular occasion was Miss N.Vat&s\u00b7Simpson,\na sister of the lady who as a child saw the little old woman in the house in\nSt. Swithin's Lane.\n\"When my mother was ill, and I sat up during the night with her, I heard\nsome one trying the lock of our door, which I had locked. I thought it was W.\ncome home la.te, as usual, so I went up close to the door and whispered through,\n, Do not come in ; mother's asleep.' I \"'ent back to the fire, and I do not know\nwhat made me do it, but I gave a great jump, a.nd on looking round found we\nwere no longer alone-a short, stout, elderly man was midway between the bed\nand the door. He went and stood near the bed, but not closf'l, and while I\nlooked I seemed to know he could do no harm. He stood looking a long time.\nHe clasped and unclasped his hands frequently. Upon the little finger of his\nleft hand he wore a wedding ring, and he turned it round and round in his hand\nas he stood, and his lips moved, though I could not hear a sound.

The ghost is usually either seen on looking round, as 0.\nhuman being might be, or seems to come in at the door. Some-\ntimes it forms gradually out of what at first seems a cloud-like\nappearance. 1 do not think there are any cases of its appearing suddenly\nin a spot which the percipient was actually looking at and perceived to\nbe vacant before. It disappears suddenly in this way sometimes, and\nsometimes if the percipient looks away for a moment, it is gone. Some-\ntimes it vanishes in a cloud-like manner, sometimes, retaining its form, it\nbecomes gradually more and more transparent till it is gone. Frequently\nit disappears through the door, either with or without apparently\nopening it, or goes into a room where there is no other exit, and\nwhere it is not found.\nEighthly, as to the seers of ghosts we can again lay down no rules.\nThe power is not limited by sex, age, or professi~n. It does not, so far\nas has yet been ascertained, depend on any obvious conditions of health,\ntemperament, intellect, or emotion. It is not even certain that it is\npossessed\u00b7by some persons and not by others, although there are reasons\nfor thinking this probable. If several persons are together when the\nghost appears it will sometimes be seen by all and sometimes not, and\nfailure to see it is not always merely the result of not directing\nthe attention towards it. Perhaps the truth may be that we all have\npotentially the power of seeing such things, but that it requires a special\nstate of mind, or body in us, to coincide with some external cause,\nand that that coincidence rarely, and in the case of most individuals,\nnever, occurs.\nAnd this brings us to the question, What external cause or causes\noperate 1 Assuming provisionally that there are haunted houses, in\nthe sense in which I have used the words, what theory can we form to\nexplain them 1\nI must confess myself quite unable to form any satisfactory theory ;\n-any theory which makes us feel that if it be truo, the phencmena are\njust what we should expect. I have doubted even whether it is yet of\nany use attempting to theorise, but I think the investigation has,\nperhaps, arrived at a point at which it is worth while to formulate\nsuch hypotheses as seem to derive any support whatever from the eYi-\ntion. One of these is an account ofa ghost that open8 a locked door, and comes\ninto the room giving a horrid little laugh. But the narrator had not seen\nthe apparition heraelf-only been told after she had heard the laugh,and found\nher door open, that others had experienced the !l8.m\" phenomena, but that in\ntheir case they seemed to be produced by a man in grey.

[April 24.\ndence before us, in order that further observations and inquiries may\nbe partly directed to proving or disprovingthem. I will,therefore, proceed\nbriefly to state and diacuBB the only four theories that have occurred\nto me.\nThe two which I will take first in order assume that the apparitions\nare due to the ~ncy or presence of the spirits of deceased men.\nThere is first the popular view, that the apparition is something\nbelonging to the external world-that like ordinary matter it\noccupies and moves through space, and would be in the room\nwhether the percipient were there to see it or not. This hypothesis\ninvolves us in many difficulties, of which one serious one-that of\naccounting for the clothes of the ghost-has often been urged,\nand never, I think, satisfactorily answered. Nevertheless, I am\nbound to admit that there is some little evidence tending to suggest\nthis theory. For instance, in the account, of which I have given an\nabstract, of the weeping lady who has appeared so frequently in a\ncertain house, the following passage occurs: \"They went after it [the\nfigure] together into the drawing-room; it then came out and went down\nthe aforesaid passage [leading to the kitchen], but was the\nnext minute seen by another MiBB D. . . . come up the outside\nsteps from the kitchen. On this particular day Captain Do's married\ndaughter happened to be at an upstairs window . . \u2022 . and inde-\npendently saw the figure continue her course across the lawn and into\nthe orchard.\" A considerable amount of clear evidence to the appear-\nance of ghosts to independent observers in successive points in\nspace, would certainly afford a strong argument for their having a\ndefinite relation to space; but in estimatingevidence of this kind it would\nbe necessary to know how far the observer's attention had been drawn to\nthe point in question. If it had been a real woman whom the MiBB Do's\nwere observing, we should have inferred, with perfect certainty, from\nour knowledge that she could not be in two places at once, that she\nhad been succeBBively, in a certain order, in the places where she was\nseen by the three observers. If they had noted the moments at which\nthey saw her, and comparing notes afterwards, found that according to\nthese notes they had all seen her at the same time, or in some other\norder to that inferred, we should still feel absolute confidence in our\ninference, and should conclude that there must be something wrong\nabout the watches or the notes. From association of ideas, it would be\nperfectly natural to make the same inference in the case of a ghost\nwhich looks exactly like a woman. But in the case of the ghost the\ninference would not be legitimate, because, unless the particular theory\nof ghosts which we are discuBBing be true, there is no reason, so far as\nwe know, why it should not appear in two or more places at once.\nHence in the case of the ghost a well founded assurance that the appear-\nDigitized by Google\n\f1886.] Phanta8m8 of ths Dead. 147\nanees were successive would require a careful observation of the times,\nwhich, so far a.s I know, ha.s never been made. On the whole, there-\nfore, I must dismiss the popular theory, a.s not having, in my opinion,\neven a primafacie ground for serious consideration.\nThe theory that I will next examine seems to me decidedly more\nplausible, from its analogy to the con~lusion to which I am brought by\nthe examination of the evidence for phanta.sms of the living. This\ntheory is that the apparition ha.s no real relation to the external world,\nbnt is a hallucination caused in some way by some communication,\nwithout the intervention of the senses, between the disembodied spirit\nand the percipient, its form depending on the mind either of the spirit\nor of the percipient, or of both. In the case of haunted houses,\nhowever, a difficulty meets us that we do not encounter, or at least,\nrarely encounter, in applying a similar hypothesis to explain phantasms\nof the living, or phanta.sms of the dead other than fixed local ghosts.\nIn these cases we have generally to suppose a simple f'appore\nbetween mind and mind, but in a haunted house we have a f'appore\ncomplicated by its apparent dependence on locality. It seems necessary\nto make the improbable assumption, that the spirit is interested in an\nentirely special way ill a particular house, (though possibly this interest\nmay be of a subconscious kind), and that his interest in it puts him into\nconnection with another mind, occupied with it in the way that that of a\nliving persoll actually there must consciously, or unconsciously be ; while\nhe does not get into similar communication with the Same, or with\nother persons elsewhere.\nIf notwithstanding these difficulties, it be true that haunting\nis due in any way to the agency of deceased persons, and\nconveys a definite idea of them to the percipients through the resem-\nblance to them of the apparition, then by patiently continuing our\ninvestigations we may expect, sooner or later,to obtain a sufficient\namount of evidence to connect clearly the commencement of hauntings\nwith the death of particular persons, and to establish clearly the likeness\nof the apparition to those persons. The fact that almost everybody is\nnow photographed ought to be of material assistance in obtaining\nevidence of this latter kind.\nMy third theory dispenses with the agency of disembodied spirits,\nbut involves us in other and perhaps equally great improbabilities. It\nis that the first appearance is a purely subjective hallucination\nand that the subsequent similar appearances both to the original\npercipient and to others, are the result of the first appearance;\nunconscious expectancy causing them in the case of the original\npercipient, and some sort of telepathic communication from the original\npercipient in the ca.se of others. In fact, it assumes that a tendency\nto a particular hallucination is in a way infectious. If this theory be\nL 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f148 Phantasms 0\/ the Dead. [April 24,\ntrue I should expect to find that the apparently independent\nappearances after the first, depended on the percipient's having had some\nsort of intercourse with some one who bad seen the ghost oofore, and\nthat any decided discontinuity of occupancy would stop .the haunting.\nI should also expect to find, as we do in one of the cases I have quoted,\nthat sometimes the supposed ghost would follow the family from one\nabode to another, appearing to haunt them rather than any particular\nhouse.\nThe fourth theory that I shall mention is one which I can\nhardly expect to appear plausible, and which, therefore, I only\nintroduce because I think that it corresponds best to a certain part of\nthe evidence i-and, as I have already said, considering the altogether\ntentative way in which we are inevitably dealing with this obscure\nsuhject, it is as well to express definitely every hypothesis which an\nimpartial consideration of the facts suggests. It is that there is some-\nthing in the actual building itself-some subtle physical influence-\nwhich produces ill the brain that effect which, in its tum, becomes the\ncause of a hallucination. It is certainly difficult on this hypothesis\nalone to suppose that the hallucinations of different people would be\nsimilar, but we might account for this by a combination of this\nhypothesis and the last. The idea is suggested by the clI.I!e of which I\nhave given an abstract, where the haunting continued through more\nthan one occupancy, but changed its charact~r.i and if there be any\ntruth in the theory, I should expect in timfl to obtain a good deal more\nevidence of this kind, combined with evidence that the same persons do\nDot as a rule encounter ghosts elsewhere. I should also expect evidence\nto be forthcoming supporting the popular idea that repairs and altera-\ntions of the building sometimes cause the haunting to cease.*\nAs I have said, the evidence before us is quite inadequate to enable\nus to decide among these theories, or e,,\u00b7en to say that anyone of\nthem is strongly supported by it. The only thing to be done, therefore,\nis to obtain more evidence, both for the occurrence of the phenomena\n\u2022 In an earlier part of this paper, I mentioned CMeS of haunted houses where\nthe appalitions are various, and might therefore all of them be merely SUbjective\n1Ialillcinations, sometimes, perhaps, caused by expectancy. It is, ef course, also\npoSllible to explain these cases by the hypothesis we are now discussing. Another\nclass of cases is, perhaps, worth mentioning in this connection. 'Ye have in the\ncollection two cases of what was belieYed by the narrators to be a quite peculiar\nfeeling of discomfort, in 1Iouses where concealed, and long since de<lOmposed\nbodies were subsequently found.

The investigation is likely to be a long and laborious\none, for the difficulties of tracing .back such unrecorded history are\noften very great, and sometimes insuperable; and even if we could learn\nall the facts bearing on the question in any particular case, we should\nstill very likely find it difficult to draw the right conclusion, owing to\nthe rare and irregular appearances of most ghosts, and the consequent\ndifficulty of determining definitely the times at which haunting begins\nor ends. Nevertheless, without such investigation we cannot hope to\nlearn the true explanation of the phenomena; and the evidence already\ncollected seems to warrant us in thinking that it is worth undertaking,\nand not likely to be fruitless. In the meanwhile, it is to be hoped that\nall who take an intelligent interest in the subject, and have the good\nfortune to live in haunted houses themselves, and to see ghosts, will help\nin the search for the truth, by finding out all they can, both about their\nown experiences and those of others, and ahout the history of the\nhouses they live in.\nAnd I should like to sayhere that it would be o. greatpity if anyone\nthought that hallucinations, when not veridical, were indications of\nanything seriously amiss with the brain. This is entirely unsupported\nby the evidence collected by the Society. Hallucinations are, no\ndoubt, sometimes symptoms of disturbance produced by overwork or\nother causes, but so are headaches, and no one is either ashamed of a\nheadache, orparticularlyalarmed by it. Moreover, if the theory that the\nghosts of haunted houses have their origin in unvcridical hallucinations\nbe true, one thing that would follow would be that seeing such things\nis not necessarily a sign of bad health. For we know that among our\nwitnesses to such phenomena we have persons not only remarkably\nsensible and practical, but remarkably strong and healthy.\nIf we now attempt to S'lm up the evide.nce afforded by the Society's\ncollection, for phantasms of the dead,* it seems to stand as follows :-\nFirstly.-Thcre are a large nu:nber of instances recorded of appear-\nances of the dead shortly after theirdeath, butgenerally there is nothing\nby which we can distinguish thesefrom simple subjective hallucinations.\nIn a few cases, however, information conveyed seems to afford the re-\nquired test, but these are at present too few, I think, for us to feel\nsure that the coincidence may not have been due to chance.\nSecondly.-There are cases of single appearances at an interval of\nmonths or years after death, but at present none which we have adequate\ngrounds for attributing to the agency of the dead.\n* I must again remind my readers that I am not dealing with the evidence\nfor communications at the time of death, which is, in my opinion, very strong.\nBy \"phantasms of the dead,\" I mean communications at least twelve hours\nafter death.\n\f150 PhanttUmB of tM Dead. [1885.\nThirdly.-There are numerous cases of seemingly similar appari-\ntions seen in particular houses,without apparently any possibility of the\nsimilarity being the result of suggestion or expectation; but the evidence\noonnecting such haunting with any definite dead person is,on the whole,\nvery small; and the evidence for the operation of any intelligent agency\nin the haunting, at present absolutely nil; and until we can discover\nmore about the laws that seem to govern such haunting, we\nare hardly justified in forming any theory as to its cause, except as a\nprovisional hypothesis.\nAs regards present conclusions, the result of the investigation will,\nI fear, appear to many very unsatisfactory. But I do not myself\nthink that we ought to expect so quickly to come to a conclusion ;\nand my emmiw.tion of the evidence has at any ra.t<.. convinced\nme that the inquiry, though likely, as I have said, to be\nlong and difficult, is worth pursuing with patience and energy.\nNOTE.-On the very eve of going to press, Mr. Gurney has received\nthe following letter from Mr. Webley, the \"lfr.

The imaginary object becomes (so to speak)\nattached to some point de repere--some visible point or mark, at or near\nthe place where it is seen-and is thus made to follow the course of any\noptical illusions to which the said point or mark is subjected. But this\ndependence on an external stimulus does not affect the fact that the\nactual sensory element in the hallucination is in these, as in all other\ncases, created and imposed by the brain.\nThere are, however, a large number of hallucinations which we must\nsuppose to be centrally initiated, as well as centrally created. Cases are\nconsidered where the hypothesis that the hallucination depends on an\nexternal stimulus, if possible, is yet very doubtful; for instance, where\nthe imaginary object is seen in free space j or where it appears to\nmove independently of the eye. But there are many other cases\nwhere the said hypothesis is plainly excluded j and where the excita-\ntion or initiation, if it does not take place in the brain, can only be\nDigitized by Google\n\f152 HallucinatWm.\ndue to some morbid disturbance in the sense-organs themselves. A\nvariety of instances are adduced where the assumption of such a morbid\ndi:;turbance would be gratuitous or impossible; as, especially, in\nauditory hallucinations; in hallucinations which conform to the course\nof some more general delusion; in hallucinations which are voluntarily\noriginated; and in the so-called \"psychic\" hallucinations, of which a\nnew explanation is offered. A further argument for the central initia-\ntion is drawn from the fact that repose of the sense-organs seems a con-\ndition favourable to hallucin~tions.\nThis discussion as to the excitation of hallucinations is followed by\na discussion as to their creation-the cerebral process which is involved\nin their ha,\\-;ng this or that particular (and often elaborate) form.\n'Vhere in the brain does this process take place 1-in the particular\nsensory centre concerned 1 or in some higher tract 1 Reasons are gi,en\nfor considering that both places of creation are available; that the\nsimpler sorta of hallucination, which are often also recurrent, may\ntake shape at the sensory centres themselves; but that the more\nelaborate and variable sorts must be traced to the higher origin; and\nthat when the higher tracts are first concerned, the production of\nthe hallucination is due to a downward escape of current to the\nsensory centre.\nFinally, an argument for the higher origin is drawn from the special\nclass of veridical Iwllucinations; the nature of which often leads us to\nconclude that those tracts of the percipient's brain which are the\nphysical seat of ideas and memories were the first to be abnormally\naffected.\n1. Definition.\nIs it possible to t.reat hallucinations as a single class of phenomena,\nmarked out by definite characteristics 1 The popular answer would no\ndoubt be Yes-that the distinguishing characteristic is some sort of\nfalse belief. But this is an error : in many of the best known cases\nof hallucination-that of Nicolai for instance-the percipient has\nheld, with respect to the figures that he saw'or the voices that he\nheard, not a false but a true belief, to wit, that they did not correspond\nto any external reality. The only sort of hallucination which is\nnecessarily characterised by false belief is the purely non-sensory sort\n-as where a person has a fixed idea that everyone is plotting against\nhim, or that he is being secretly mesmerised from a distance. Of\nhallucinations of the senses, belief in their reality, though a frequent,\nis by no means an essential feature; a tendency to deceive is all that\nwe can safely predicate of them.\nIf we seek for some further quality which shall be distinctive of\nboth sensory and non-sensory hallucinations, the most hopeful sugges-\n\fHallucinations. 153\ntion would seem to be that both sorts are idiosyncratic and tmslwred.\nHowever false a belief may be, we do not call it a hallucination if it\nhas \"been in the air,\" and has arisen in a natural way in a plurality\nof minds. This is just what an idee fixe of the kind above-mentioned\nnever does: A may imagine that the world is plotting against him i hut\nB, if he spontaneously evolves a similar notion, will imagine that the\nworld is plotting not against A, but against himself. Instances, how-\never, are not wanting where the idee fixe of an insane person has\ngraduMly infected an associate i* and as contact between mind and\nmind is, after all, the \" natural way\" of spreading ideas, we can make\nno scientific distinction between these cases and those where, e.g., the\nleader of a sect has instilled delusive notions into a number of\n(teclmically) sane followers. But again, hallucinations of the senses are\nalso occasionally shared by s'3veral persons. 1\\Iost of the alleged\ninstances of this phenomenon are, no doubt, merely cases of collective\nillusion-an agreement in the misinterpretation of sensory signs pro-\nduced by a real external object i but, as the result of wide inquiries, I\nhave encountered several instances of genuine and spontaneous\ncollecti1,,'e ',allucination. If, then, sensory and non-sensory hallucina,.\ntions agree in being as a rule unshared, they agree also in presenting\nmarked exceptions to the rule i which exceptions, in the sensory species,\nare of a peculiarly inexplicable kind. The conclusion does not seem\nfavourable to our chance of obtaining a neat general definition which\nwill embrace the two species i and, in abandoning the search for one, I\ncan only point, with envy, to the convenient way in which French\nwriters are enabled not to combine but to keep them apart, byappro-\npriating to the non-sensory class the words delire and conception\ndelirante.\nLet us then try to fix the character of lwlll\u00a3ci1wtions of the senses\nindependently. The most comprehensive view is that all our instinc-\ntive judgments of visual, auditory,and tactile phenomena are hallucina-\ntions, inasmuch as what is really nothing more than an affection\nof ourselves is instantly interpreted by us as an external object.\nIn immediate perception, what we thus objectify is present\nsensation i in mental pictures, what we objectify is remembered\nor represented sensation. This is the view which has been worked\nout very ingeniously, and for psychological purposes very effec-\ntively, by M. Taine it but it is better adapted to a. general theory of\nsensation than to a theory of hallucinations as such. To adopt it here\n* See Dr. G. H. Savage's Note on the \"Contagiousness of Delusions,\" in\nthe Journal of lIfental Scieme, January, 1881, p. 563 ;and the paper on \" Folie\na Deux,\" by Dr. llarandon de Montyel, in the AII\/I. MUico\u00b7PIt!lch., 6th series,\nVol. V., p. 28.\nt De l'Intelligence, Vol. r., p. 408, &c.\nDigitized by Google\n\f154 Hallucinatiolls.\n'Would .drive us to describe the diseased Nicolai-when he saw phantoms\nin the room, buthad his mind specially directed to the fact that they\n'Were internally caused-as leBB hallucinated than a healthy person in\nthe unreHective exercise of normal vision. I prefer to keep to the\nordinary language which would describe Nicolai's phantoms as the 1\"(>.&.1\nspecific case of hallucination. And I should consider their distinctive\neha.racteristic to be something quit-e apart from the question whether or\nnot they were actually mistaken for real figures-namely, their marked\nresemblance to real figures, and the consequent necessity for the\nexercise of memory and reflection to prevent so mistaking them. The\ndefinition of a sensory hallucination would thus be a percept wMcl~ lacks,\nbut whicl, can only by distinct rtiflection b~ recognised as lacking,\nthe o~jective basis wltich it suggests-where objective basis is to be taken\nas a short way of naming the possibility of being shared by all persons\nwith normal senses.* It may be objected that this definition would\ninclude illusions. The objection could be obviated at the cost of a little\nclumsiness; but it seems sufficient to observe that illusions are merely\nthe sprinkling of fragments of genuine hallucination on a background\nof true perception. And the definition seems otherwise satisfactory.\nFor while it clearly separates hallucinations from true perceptions, it\nequally clearly separates them from the phenomena with which they\nhave been perpetually identified-the remembered images or mental\npictures which are not perceptions at all.t It serves, for instance, to\ndistinguish,on the lines of common sense and common la.nguage, between\nthe images of \"day-dreams\" and those of night-drea.ms. In both\ncases vivid images arise, to which no objective reality corresponds; and\n* I have indeed referred above to collective hallucinations; but they may\nfairly be excluded here, not merely becanse they are very exceptional, but\nbecaUlie it is a nice question for Idealism to determine how far, or in what sense,\nthey lack an objective basis. To put an extreme case: suppose all the seeing\nworld, save one individual, had a visual percept, the object of which neverthe-\nless eluded all physical tests. Would the solitary individual be jnstilied in saying\nthat all the others were victims of a subjective delusion! And it he said so\nwould they agree with him!\nt M. Taine's definition and mode of treatment become unsatisfactory\nhere. Rega.rding perceptions as in essence hallucinations, he naturally regards\nmental images_ince they are the shadowy representatives of former percep-\ntions_ hallucinations of an. embryon.ic BOrt. This metaphor commits him to\n.ho\\ving how the embryo mRoY develop into the full product-which will happen\nif the mental image be then and there extemalised,as is often the case in\ndelirium. The result of this transformation is inevitably ajalae hallucination;\nand a special connection is thus suggested between mental images and one par-\nticular sort of percept, namely the incorrect sort. But in ordinary experience,\nmental images are of course far more closely and constantly connected with\ncorrect percepts, M. Taine's trlUJ hallucinations, whose relics and representatives\nthey are, than with falae hallucinations, into which not one in a. million of\nthem is ever transformed.\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucinatiOliB. 155\nin neither case is any distinct process of reflection applied to the dis-\ncovery of this fact. But the self-evoked waking-vision is excluded from\nthe class of hallucinations, as above defined, by the point that its lack of\nobjective basis can be and is recognised without any such process of\nreflection. We have not, like Nicolai, to consider and remember, before\nwe can decide that the friends whose faces we picture are not really in\nthe room. Wefeel that our mind is active and not merely receptive-\nthat it is the mind's eye and not the bodily sense which is at work;\nwithoutattending to this fact, we have it as part of our whole conscious\nstate. Dreams on the other hand are, as a rule, pure cases of\nhallucination, forcing themselves 011 us whether we will or no, and with\nan impression of objective reality which is uncontradicted by any\nknowledge, reflective or instinctive, that they are the creatures of our\nbrain.\nBut, though our definition may be sufficient for mere purposes of\nclassification, it takes us but a very little way towards understanding\nthe real nature of thephenomena. It says nothing of their origin and,\nthough it distinguishes them from mere normal acts of imagination or\nmemory, it leaves quite undetermined the faculty or faculties actually\nconcerned in them. And when we pass on to these further points, we\nfind ourselves in a most perplelted field,where doctors seem:to be as much\nat variance as philosophers. The debate, most ardently carried on in\nFrance, has produced a multitude of views j but not one of the rival\ntheorists seems ever to have convinced any of the others. Still progress\nhas been made, to this extent at any rate, that it is now comparatively\neasy to see where the disputed points lie, and to attack them with\nprecision.\n2. Tl1.8 Dual Nature of Hallucinations.\nItwas,of course,evident from the first tha.t there was a certain duality\nof nature in hallucinations. In popula.r language, the 'mind and the sense\nwere both plainly involved: the hallucinated person not only\nimagined such and such a thing, but imagined that he saw such and\nsuch a thing. But in the early days of the controversy, the attempts\n...t analysing the ideational and the senS01\"\/J elements were of a very\ncrude sort. The state of hallucination used to be treated as one in\nwhich ideas and memories-while remaining ideas and memories and\nnot sensations-owing to exceptional vividness took on the character\nof sensations. It was not clearly realised or remembered that sensa-\ntions have no existence except as 'mental facts j and that, so far as a.\nmental fact takes on the character of a sensation, it is a. sensation.\nThis was clearly stated, as a matter of personal experience, by Burdach\nand Miiller; in the French discussions, the merit of bringing out the\nDigitized by Google\n\f156 Hallucination8.\npoint with new force and emphasis belongs to Baillarger.* He showed\nthat when the hallucinated person says \"I see so and so,\" \"I hear so\nand so,\" the words are literally true. If the person g~.s on to say\n\" You ought also to see or hear it,\" he is of course wrong; but when\nhe says that lUJ tees or hears it, his statement is to be taken without\nreserve. To l,iUl, the experience is not something like or related to the\nexperience of perceiving a red external object: it is identical with that\nexperience. To the psychology of our day this may seem a tolerably\nevident truth. Still it is easy to realise the difficulty that was long felt\nin admitting that any experience that was dissociated from the normal\nfunctions of the sense-organs could be completely sensory in character.\nPopular thought fails to see that the physical question which for\npractical purposes is all-important-whether the object is or is not really\nthere-is psychically irrelevant; and a man who has bl'en staring at\nthe sun will, as a rule, think it ll'.ss accurate to say that he Bees a\nluminous disc wherever he looks than to say that he jancieB it. The\nbest corrective to such a prejudice is Delbreuf's experiment, which\nit will be convenient briefly to set forth, for the sake of subsequent\nreference.\nTwo small slits are made in a shutter, and one of them is filled\nwith a piece of red glass. The opposite wall is therefore lit by 0.\nmixture of white and red light. A stick is now placed across the red\nslit; its shadow is of course cast on the wall; the part of the wall\noccupied by the shadow, though illuminated only by tvltite rays from the\nother slit, appears-owing to the optical law of contrast-o. bright\ngreen. t Let this shadow now be looked at through a narrow tube,.\n\u2022 In the long and rather barren debates which took place in the Societe\nl\\ICdico-psychologique during 18ii5 and 1856, Baillarger, no doubt, insisted too\nstrongly on an absolute gulf between percepts (true or false) and the ordinary\nimages of fancy or memory. But his opponents madca far Blore serious mistake\nb so far ideJ.tifying the two 8.8 not to pel'Ceive a difference of kind, at the point\nwhere the sensory element in the mental fact reaches Kuch abnormal strength as\nto suggest the real presence of the object. Gricsinger's statement (Ment. Patl!.\nmw TIIU., p. 89) and Wundt's(Phys. Psych., Vol. II., p. 353) \"cem too un-\nguarded in the same respect. As long ago as 1832, the late Dr. Symonds, of\nBristol, drew exactly the right distinction between images and hallucinations.\n(Lecture reprinted in lI\/i8ccllanics, p. 241).\nt Wundt (phys. Psych., Vul. I., p. 463) has described some experiments, on\nthe analogy of which it seems to me that this first result shonld be explained.\nI at any rate cannot concur with Delbamfs explanation of it, which M. Binet\nadopts. According to them, it is due to two things: to the fact that the rays\nwbich pass from the shadow to t.he spectator's eye are really grey; and to the\nBpectator's knowledge of the further fact t.bat the only colour which, seen\ntbrough red light, looks grey, is green. They bold then tbat the sensation,\nthuugh of grey, excites through association an image of green. To this there\nseem to be three objections. (1) Not one person in 2Opossesses the supposed\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucinations. 157\nwhich prevents any part of the wall external to the shadow from being\nseen. Nothing red is now in the spectator's view, so that there can be\nno effect of contrast: the red glass may even be removed; none but\nwhite rays are passing to his eye from the shadow; yet its colour\nremains green. And in this case the chances are that, unless previously\nwl'.rncd, he will tell the exact truth; he will admit, and e,,-en persist,\nthat what he sees is green. He will scout the idea that the green is a.\nmere memory of what he saw before he applied the tube; he will assert\nthat it is presented to him as an immediate fact. And such is assuredly\nthe state of the case; but it is a state which, from the moment that\nhe has put the tube to his eye, is kept up purely as a hallucination, and\nwithout regard to the facts of the external world. The delusion is of\ncourse instantly dispelled by the removal of the tube-when he perceives\nthat the only light in the room IS white, and that the shadow is grfJy ;\nbut for all that he will probabiy never doubt again that a genuine\nhallucination of the senses is something more than\" mere fancy.\"\nIt is impossible to be too particular on this point: for higlt\nauthorities, even in the present day, are found to contest it. \\Vhen a\nperson who habitually speaks the truth, and who is not colour-blind,\nlooks at an object and says \"1\\{y sensation is green,\" they contradict\nhim, and tell him that however much he BeeB green, his sensation is\ngrey. Whether this be a mere misuse of language, or (as it seems to\nme) a misconception of facts, it at any rate renders impossible any\nagreement as to the theory of hallucinations. For it ignores the very\npoint of Baillarger's contention-that images sufficiently vivid to be\nconfounded with sensory percepts l\/-ave become sensory percepts.\nWhen once the trnth of this contention is perceived, it is also\nperceived that the previous speculations had been largely directed to a.\nwrong issue; and that the du.al character of a false perception is aftt>r\nall, no other than that of a true perception. A hallucination, like an\nordinary percept, is composed of present sensations, and of images\nwhich are the relics of past sensations. If I see the figure of a man,\nthen-alike if there be a man there and if there be no man there-my\npiece of knowledge. (2) E\"en for one who does possess it, the moments in his\nlife during which he has had experience of the fact that green seen through rell\nlight looks grey, are surely not sufficiently striking or numerous to have\nestablished an instinctive and inseparable association between the sensation of\ngrey, occurring in a place where red light prevails, and the idea of green. (3)\nEven if this inseparable association could be conceived pO(Vjible, one fails to see\nwhy the result should be the transformation, in the spectator's consciousnes.~, of\nthe idea green into (what at any rate seems to him to be) the 8cII$ation green;\nthat being the very sensation which, in the supposed moments of experience, has\nbeen conspicuous by its absence. On Delhrouf's theory, the lawn seen through\nred gws ought not only to excite the idea. of green (which it perhaps may do),\nbut to look green.\nDigitized by Google\n\f158 Halluci\"atitm8.\nexperience consists of certain visual sensations, compounded with a\nvariety of muscular and tactile images, which represent to me properties\nof resistance, weight, and distance; and also with more remote and\ncomplex images, which enable me to refer the object to the class man,\nand to compare this specimen of the class with others whose appearance\nI can recall. If Baillarger did not carry out his view of hallucinations\nto this length, the whole development exists by implication in the term\nby which he described them~81Jcl\/.0-8enBorial. The particular word\nwas, perhaps, an unfortunate one; since it suggests (as M. Binet has\npointed out) that the psychical element is related to the sensorial some-\nwhat as the soul to the body; and so, either that psychical events are\nindependent of physical conditions, or that sensations are not psychical\nevents. Icko-BfJ1UIational would avoid this difficulty; but the obverse\nterm which M. Binet proposes-cerebro-BenBorial-is on the whole\nto be preferred. For this brings us at once to the plty,ical ground\nwhere alone the next part of the inquiry can be profitably pursued-\nthe inquiry into origin. From the standpoint of to-day, one readily\nperceives how much more definite and tangible the problems were cer-\ntain to become, as soon as they were translated into physiological terms.\nSo far as the controversy had been conducted on a purely psychological\nbasis, it had been singularly barren. In the vague unlocalised use, \"the\nsenses\" and other ever-recurring terms become sources of dread to thE\"\nreader. But as soon as it is asked, where is the local seat of the\nabnormal occurrence 1 and on what particular physical conditions does\nit depend 1 lines of experiment and observation at once suggest them-\nselves, and the phenomena fall into distinct groups.\n3. TM question ofCentral or PeripllMal Origin: tlte difference between\nCreation and Excitation.\nIn its first form, the question is one between central and periphsral\norigin. Do hallucinations originate in the brain-in the central\nmechanism of perception1 or in some immediate condition of the eye,\nor of the ear, or of other parts 1or is there possibly some joint mode of\norigin 1\n}t'or a long time the hypothesis of anexclusively central origin was\nmuch in the ascendan~ But this was greatly because-as already\nnoted-Esquirol and the older writers did not recognise the sensory\nelement as truly and literally sensation, but regarded the whole ex-\nperience as simply a very vivid idea or memory. If the central origin\nis to be established it must be by something better than arbitrary\npsychological distinctions. Hibbert and Ferriar, going to the other\nextreme, contended that the memory WQ.S 0. retinal one ; if a man ,ees\nwhat is not there, they held, it can only be by a direct recrudescence of\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucinationa. 159\npastfeeling in his retina. U But,\"urged Esquirol, u the blind can have\nhallucinations of vision; the deaf can have hallucinations of hearing;\nhow can these originate in the peripheral organs 1\" The obvious answer,\nthat this did not necessarily thrust the point of origin back as far as the\ncerebrum, does not seem to have heen forthcoming; and the opposite\nparty preferred to fall back on definite experiment. They pointed out,\nfor instance, that visual hallucinations often vanish when the eyes are\nclosed; or (as Brewstertirst observed) that they may be doubled by\npressing one eyeball But though there was enough here to suggest\nthat the external organs participated in the process, there was no proof\nthat they originated it, even in these particular cases ; while for other\ncases the observations did not hold. An immense advance was made by\nBaillarger, who maintained the central origin by really scientific argu-\nments. He pointed out (1) that the external organ may often be\naffected by loca.l irritants - inflammation, blows, pressure,\ngalvanism-without the production of any more pronounced\nform of hallucination than flashes, or hummings; that is to say, the\nperipheral stimulation fails to develop hallucination, even under the\nmost favourable conditions: (2) that there is a frequent correspondence\nof hallucinations of different senses-a man who sees the devil also\nhears his voice, and smells sulphur-and that it is impossible to refer\nthis correspondence to abnormalities of the eye, ear, and nose, occur\nring by accident at the same moment : (3) that hallucinations often\nrefer to dominant ideas-a religious monomaniac will see imaginary\nsaints and angels, not imaginary trees and houses. Hence, argued\nBaillarger, u the point of departure of hallucinations\" is always u the\nintelligence\"-the imagination and memory-which sets the sensory\nmachinery in motion. He na.1vely admitted that how this action of an\nimmaterial principle on the physical apparatus takes place passes all\nconception ; but it might he forgiven to a medical man, writing forty\nyears ago, if he had not fully realised \"brain as an organ of mind,\"\nand so did not see that what he took for a special puzzle in the theory\nof hallucinations, is simply the fundamental puzzle involved in every\nmental act. Passing him this, we may say that his treatment of the\nquestion entitles him to the credit of the Becond great discovery about\nhallucinations. He had already made clear their genuinely sensory\nquality ; he no.v made equally clear the fact that the mind (or its\nphysical correlate) is their creator-that they are brain-products pro-\njected from within outwards.\nThis is a most important truth ; but it is very far from being the\nwhole truth. Baillarger BIloW no via media between the theory which\nhe rejected-that the nerves of sense convey to the brain impressions\nwhich are there perceived as the phantasmal object-and the theory\nwhich he propounded, that u the intelligence\" (i.e., for us, the brain, as\nDigitized by Google\n\f160 Halluc;lIatUJII8.\nthe seat of memories and images) of its own accord, and without any im-\npulse from the periphery, excites the sensory apparatus. It seems\nne,\u00b7er to have struck him that there may be cases where the sense-organ\nsupplies the excitant, though the brain is the creator-that irritation\npassing from without inwards may be a means of setting in motion the\ncreative activity. He took into account certain states of the organ-e.g.,\nfatigue produced by previous exercise-as increasing the susceptibility\nto excitation from \"the intelligence,\" and so as conditions favourable to\nhallucin!l.tion ; but he got no further.\nThe facts of hallucination absolutely refuse to lend themselves to\nthis indiscriminate treatment. Following the path of experiment, we\nare almost immediately confronted with tlVO classes of phenomena, and\ntlVO modes of excitation. We need not go, indeed, beyond the ele-\nmentary instances already mentioned. Delbceuf's experiment, where\ngreen was seen by an eye on which only white rays were falling,\nfairly illustrates Baillarger's doctrine-the green being produced not by\nan outer affection of the eye, but by an inner affection of the brain.\nBut in the case of 1\\ person who has been staring at the sun, the \"after\nimage\" or hallucination can be clearly traced to 0. continuing local effect\nin that small area of the retina which has just been ahnormallyexcited;\nand it will continue to present itself wherever the eye may turn, until\nrest has restored this area to its normal condition. A still simpler\nform of change in the external organ is 0. blow on the eye; and the\nresulting\" sparks\" are genuine though embryonic hallucinations.\nSuch cases as these last are, however, hardly typical; for in them the\nbrain is not truly creative; it merely gives the inevitable response to\nthe stimuli that reach it from below. They are moreover normal ex_\nperiences, in the sense that they would occur similarly to all persons\nwith normal eyes. Let us then take another instance, where the mind's\ncreative role is fully apparent, while at the same time the primary exci-\ntation is clearly not central. Certain hallucinations-as is well known\n-are 1militeral, i.e., are. perceived when (say) the right eye or ear is act-\ning, but cease when that action is obstructed, though the left eye or ear\nis still free. Now this is in itself could not be taken, as some take it,.\nfor a proof that the exciting cause was not central; it might be a\nlel'ion affecting one side of the brain. But very commonly, in these\ncases, a. distinct lesion is found in the particular eye or ear on whose\nactivity the hallucination depends; t and it is then natural to conclude\nthat the hallucination was the result of the lesion, and that the one-\n\u00b7Dr. Regis in L'ElldpllUlc, 1881, p. 51; Prof. Ball in L'Encephalc,\n882, p.5.\nf Dr. Regis in L'EUlxpllale, 1881, p. 46; 1\\1.

The\njustice of the conclusion has been proved in many cases by the\nfact that the hallucination has ceased when the local lesion\nhas been cured. Other cases which strongly suggest a morbid\ncondition of the external organ are those where tho imaginary\nfigure moves in accordance with tho movements of the eye.\nThe visual hallucinations of the blind, and the auditory hallucinations of\nthe deaf, would also naturally be referred to the same class-the seat of\nexcitation being then, not necessarily the external organ itself, but\nsome point on the nervous path from the organ to the brain. In the\ncase, for instance, of a partly-atrophied nerve, the morbid excitation\nwould be at the most external point where vital function continued.*'\nIt should be noted, in passing, that a distinct lesion, e.g., atrophy of the\nglobe of 01UI eye, may give rise to bilateral hallucinations (Vienna\n.4.Bylum Report, 1858), or to unilateral hallucinations of the BOUnd eye-\nthe latter being no doubt affected directly by the brain.\n4. External E:r:citation of Hallucinations.\nBut we may now proceed a step further. The excitation may be\nexternal not only in the sense of coming from the external organ, but\nin the seuse of coming from the external world. It may be due not to\nany abnormality of the eye or the nerve, but to the ordinary stimulus\nof light-rays from real objects. M. Binet is the first who has given the\ncomplete evidence for this fact, accompanied by a scientific explanation\nof it it and in so doing, he has made a contribution to the learning of\nthe subject second in importance only to that of Baillarger.\nM. Binet's experiments were conducted on five hypnotised girls at\nthe Salpetriere, who could be made to see anything that was suggested\nto them i and also on an insane woman at St. Anne, who had a stand-\ning visual hallucination of her own. The t:xperiments may be divided\ninto two sets-those conducted with, and those conducted without,\nspecie.! optical apparatus. The results of both sets confirmed the rule\nfirst enunciated by M. Fere-that \"the imaginary object is perceived\n* Delusions due to visceral disturbances are often quote(l as cases of\nhallucination excited from parts below the brain. Thus a woman dying of\nperitonitis declares that an ecclesiastical conclave is being held inside her\n(Eequirol, Maladiu 1f.fentalu, Vol. I., p. 211). But here there is a prior and\nindependent basis of distinct sensation; 80 that the experience would at most\nbe an illusion. And it is hardly even that; for one cannot say that the\nfalse object is senaorially presented at all; no one knows what a conclave in\nsuch a locality would actually feel like; the conclave is merely a dIlire-an\nimagination suggested by sensation, but which does not :itself take a 8eD8OJy\nform.\nt In the 1lew, PhilO8OplJilJue, April and May, 1884.\nDigitized by Google\n- - ------\n\f162 Hallucillatiolls.\nunder the same conditions as a real one\"; but to this M. Binet adds\nthe further conclusion, that a sensation derived from a real external\nsource occupying the same position in space as the imaginary object\nseemed to occupy, was an indispensable factor of the hallucination. The\nresults obtained without special apparatus do not appear to me at all to\njustify this conclusion. They were (1) suppression of the imaginary\nobject by closure of the eyes; (2) suppn>,ssion of the imaginary object\nby the interposition of an opaque screen between the eye and the place\nwhere the object seemed to be; (3) doubling of the imaginary object\nby lateral pressure of one eyeball. M. Binet argues that the suppres-\nsion in the first two cases, and the doubling in the third, depended on the\nsuppression and the doubling of a real sensation, physically induced by\nrays from the direction in which the object was seen. But the fact that\nexternal objects are hidden from view by the interposition of our own\neyelids or any other opaque obstacle, has become to us a piece of abso-\nlutely instinctive knowledge; and we should surely expect that an object\nwhich was but the spontaneous projection of a morbid brain, might still\nbe suppressed by movements and sensations which had for a lifetime been\nintimately associated with the suppression of objects. And as regards\nthe doubling by pressure of the eyeball, it can be perfectly explained on\nBaillarger's principles-by supposing that an excitation which has been\ncentrally initiated SPl-ea.dS outwards to the peripheral expansion of the\noptic nerve.\nWhen, however, we turn to the other group of experiments, the case\nis very different. The instruments used were a prism, a spy-glass, and a\nmirror. It would occupy too much space to describe the results in\ndetail. It is enough to say that the prism applied to one eye\ndoubled the imaginary object; * that the spy-glass removed or\napproximated it according as the object-glass or eye-piece was applied\nto the patient's eye; that the mirror reflected the object and gave\na symmetrical image of it; and that the optical effect, as regards\nangles of deviation and reflexion and all the details of the illusion,\nwas in every case precisely what it would have been had the object\nbeen real instead of imaginary. Here then we are fairly driven out-\nside the patient's own organism; it seems impossible to deny that some\npoint of external space at or near the seat of the imagined object plays Itt\nreal part in the phenomenon.t To this point M. Binet gives the name of\n\u2022 The observation was first made by M_ Fero; see Le Progres Medical,\n1881, p. 1040_\nt One reservation must be made. It is just conceivable that the changetl\nwrought on the imaginary percept were due, not to the optical iustruments, but\nto thought-transference. For 1\\1. Binet aud his assilltants of course knew them-\nselves, in each case, the particular optical effect to be expected. An experi-\nmenter who has not expressly recognised the reality or the possibility of thought-\nDigitized by Goo\n\fHallllCiJlatioM. 163\npoi'\" ck r~ere i and he regards it as producing a nucleus of sense.-\ntion to which the hallucination accretes itself. When the point ck\nr6pere is in such a position as to be reflected by the mirror, then the im-\naginary object is reflected, and not otherwise i the object is, so to speak,\nattached to its point de repere, and will follow the course of any optical\nillusions to which its sensory nucleus is subjected. According to this\nview, the only truly sensory part of the phenomenon is supplied by the\npoint ck repere j all the rest is a II hypertrophied image\" imposed on it\nby the mind.\nThese conclusions are entirely foreign to any former theory of\nhallucination. None of the contending parties, not even the early\nchampions of a purely peripheral origin, had ever dreamt of excitants\noutside the eye itself. Oddly 6Jlough, M. Binet seems hardly aware of\nhis own originality. He remarks that the general view now is that\nhallucinations are always the product of real sensation; and he dhidea\nthem into two classes,-those where the sensation is initiated in the\nsensory organ by an external object(\" ltallucinationB it eause objeetive \") ;\nand those where it is initiated by 110 morbid local irritation of the sensory\norgan itself (\" lwllucinationB it cause Bubjeetive \"). As practically the\ninventor of the former class, M. Binet is really the first person who has\nh:J.d a rightto this II general view.\" But his modesty connects itself with\na serious historical error. For he still retains Baillatger\u00b7s term-psyclw-\nBenBorial-and actually refers to Baillarger as baving meant the same\nby that term as he himself does. With Ba.illarger-as we have seen-\nthe II sensorial JI element was imposed or evoked by II the intelligence,\"\nnot supplied to it; and was not an unnoticed peg for the hallucination,\nbut its very fulness and substance. Baillarger explicitly lays down, as\none of the prime conditions for hallucination, a II suspension of external\nimpressioll8 \"; and gives as the definition of a psycho-sensorial hallucina-\ntion \"a sensory perception independent of all external excitation\nof the sense organs,\" including excitation morbidly initiated in\nthe organs themselves.* The opposition is really complete. Of\nall the optical illusions described by M. Binet, the only one\nwhich Baillarger's doctrine would explain is the doubling of the\ntransference would never think of so arranging his experiment that he himself\nshould not know, till after the resnlt, which instrument was in use or what was\nita position; nor indeed is it easy to imagine how such a condition conld in\npractice be carried out. The point seems worth suggesting, as it would be most\ninteresting if a state of hallncination turned out to be one in which the\n\"subject\" is specially susceptible to \"transferred impressions.\"\n\u2022 Baillarger, Du Hallucinatioll8, pp. 426, 469, and 470. A similar\nmisreading of Baillarger, contained in a single sentence, is the one point from\nwhich [ dissent in the extremely clear and concille chapter on the subject in Mr.\nSnlly's IUu8wru.\nM 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f164 Hallucillations.\nobject by pressure on the side of the eyeball; for this alone could be\naccounted for by supposing the retina to be excited from the brain. The\nnovelty of l\\I. Binet's own results is that they force us to regard the\nexternal impression as not only present but indispensable, at any rate\nat the moment when the optical instruments produce their characteristic\neffects.\nBut while admiring the manner in which M. Binet has marshalled\nhis facts, and recognising that they have led him to a most interesting\ndiscovery, I cannot accept his conclusions beyond a certain point. He\napplies conceptions drawn from his special departmcnt of observation to\nthe whole field, and considers that hallucinations are exhausted by the\ntwo classes just defined-i.e., that there is no such thing as central\ninitiation. Now E:ven for the cases \"i~ cause objectire,\" to which the\nnovel experimental results belong, it is important to observe that though\nthe excitation comes from outside, the lurlllC.cinatwn--the object as\nactually perceived-is still (1\\8 Baillarger taught) a pure product of the\nmind. Everything about it, including its false air of reality, is brain-\ncreated j and the occasioning or evoking cause has no place in it. But\nif this be so-and M. Binet himself has practically admitted it-we\ncannot consent to call the external excitation of the organ sensation.\nM. Binet so treats it throughout-as a sensation atrophied, indeed, and\nclothed upon with hypertrophical and delusive images j but still as\nsensation--as a psychical element in the result. Now in considering\nDelbreuf's experiment above, we objected to the notion that the spectator\nhad a sensation of grey which he clothed with an il1Ulge of green. The\nphysical rays that met his eye were such as normally produce the\nsensation of grey j that is the only way in which the word grey can be\nbrought into the account j psychically, no colour but green was present.\nJust the same ohjection applies to saying of the hypnotic \"suhject \" that\nhe is receiving from part of the table-cloth a \" sensation\" of white,\nwhich he clothes with an image of a brown butterfly j or of the patient\nin delirium tremens, that ho is receiving from the wall-paper \"sensa-\ntions \" of drab which he clothes with images of black mice. In neithe.\ncase is there a \" perturbation of sensorial functions\" in ~:L Binet's sense.\nThe sensorial elements, the brown and the black, spring from a new\nactivity within j they are not the outcome of functions exercised on\nthe table-cloth or the wall-paper-not a perverted transcript of white\nand drab.\nHolding fast to this view, we can still perfectly well\nexplain M. Binet's results, even in tho hypnotic cl\\8es on which\nhe chiefly relies. If the point de repere is not at, but close to\nthe spot where the imaginary o~ject appears (as seems to\nhave been the case in some of the experiments), there is no difficulty.\nThe point de rl'pere is then itself part of what is all along perceived ;\n\fHallucittatio1ll. 165\nand in any effects produced on it by optical apparatus, it will carry the\nneighbouring object with it by auociation. If, howtlver, the actual\narea covered by the object is sufficiently distinguished from its surround-\nings to act itself as point de repere, and no other possible points de repere\nexist in the field of vision,* the case is different, but can still be\nexplained. It will not be disputed that a slightly longer time is neces-\nsary for the formation of the image of a suggested object and the\nconversion of this image into a percept, than for the experience of\nsensation from an object actually before the eyes. When therefore the\noperator points to a particular place on, the white table-cloth, and says\n\"There is II. brown butterfly,\" we may suppose that in the patient's\nconsciousness a real sensation of white precedes by an instant the\nimposed sensation of brown. So when the cardboard on which a non-\nexistent portrait has just boon seen is again brought before the patient's\neyes, it is almost certain that the recognition of it as the same piece of\nwhite cardboard (known by its points de repere) precedes by an instant\nthe hallucinatory process and the re.imposition of the portrait. That\nthere is this instant of true sensation seems to be shown, indeed, by one\nof M. BiRet's own experiments. The patient having been made to see\nan imaginary portrait on a blank piece of cardboard, this was suddenly\nco,'ered by a sheet of paper. The patient said that the portrait di8ap-\npearedfor a moment, but then reappeared on the paper with complete\ndistinctness. We may thus fairly conclude that an area which was\nactually seen before the hallucination was induc('d in the first instance,\nwill also be actually seen for a moment when vision is redirected to it\n(or its reflexion), after the prism or spy-glass has been brought into play.\nDuring that moment, it will of course be seen under the new illusive\noptical conditions; and association may again cause the object which\nsupplants it to follow suit. There can be no objection, however, to\nsupposing that the supplanted area continues further to lJTovoke the\nhallucination, in the same Rense that the white rays provoked the green\npercept ill Delbreuf's experiment. The rays which are lost to sensation\ncontinue to excite the sensorium physically; and what 1\\1. Binet says of\nthe sensation only needs to be transferred to the pltysical excitntion-\nwhich will have definite peculiarities, corresponding to the distinguish-\ning marks of the area whence it comes. DouMe this excitation by a.\nprism, or reflect it from another quarter, and the percept which it\n\u2022 I cannot quite make out whether these conditions were ever exactly\nrealised. In the case where an ima.ginary portrait had been evoked on a piece\nof cardboard, and this piece was Ilubsequently picked out by the patient from\namong a number of similar ones, I ~:ather that there was BOrne recognisable mark\nexternal to the area of the portrait. It i~ said th1.t lateral pressure doubled the\nimage, even when the eyes were \"fixed on the uniform surface of the wall.\"\nBut this particular optical effect, as we have already noticed, does not imply the\npresence of poitiU de Tcpere at all.\nDigitized by Google\n\f166 Hallucination\u2022.\nprovokes may naturally be doubled or seen in the new direction. So, if\nboth eyes were employed in Delbreuf's experiment, might the green\npercept be artificially doubled.\nI am aware that this substitution of the physical for the psychical\nterm may appear very unimportant and even pedantic; but in truth it\nis not so. For it is really his psychical expression of the external\nstimulus in these cases that has led M. Binet to regard hallucinations\nas simply a monstrous form of illttBion, and to enunciate a general\nformula for them which-for all its attractive and original air-seems\nradically unsound. He considers them tlte patlwlogical----aB 0pp086d to\ntlte norntal-form of external perception. As in normal perception, we\nhave a visual sensation which we associa.te with t1\"1te images, so, he\nholds, in hallucinations we have a visual sensation which we associate\nwithfalae images. The looseness of this analogy is surely obvious, and\nthe apparent symmetry of the two cases quite unreal. In normal\nvision, the true images which (accordiDg to M. Binet's own account) we\nprimarily associate with the visual sensation, are not visual, but\nmuscular and tactile images, whereby we attach the ideas of weight,\nsolidity, and distance to what we see. The process through which we\nget the perception of a real external ohject is thus primarily an associa-\ntion between psychical elements belonging to differenl. semes-a visual\nsensation, which the brain receives, and non-visual images, which the\nbrain supplies; and if we convert the non-viAual images into sensations\nby touchiDg or pressing the object, we get a verifica.tion of its external\nreality. Now, if M. Binet's formula. is to hold, and ha.llucinations are\nthe pathological forn) of external perception, we ought to find that they\nare produced when for the trtte imag(ls of normal perception we substi-\ntute faue images. Is this the case 1 Suppose a hypDotic patient to be\nimpressed with the idea that a piece of white paper is 1\\ red rose:\nwould it be a right account of his hallucination to say that he\nreceives a \"isual sensation, and then associates with it false\nmuscular and tactile images 1 Certainly not: what he does is\nto \",.6 wron!l to begin with, to see false form and false colour-things\nquite distinct in character from ideas of weight, solidity and distance,\nand which might exist in the absence of any such ideas. It is true that\nwhen he has this visual experience, habit leads him to go on and connect\nit with false images of weight, solidity and distance; but that is a\nsecondary result. Hallucination does not depend on the falsity of those\nimages j and, indeed, the test of touching aud pressing would often fail\nto demoDstratc their falsity, owing to the frequent sympathy of several\nsenses in hallucination. The essential fact is immediate, and consists\nsimply in llaving a visual experience tvlticl, ot!ter8 cannot .!tare-in\nseeing what is invisible to a normal eye. 'fhis becomes clearer still, if\nwe make the imaginary object correspond to a real object in everything\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucination&. 161\nexcept colour. Let the patient be led to believe that a green stick of\nsealing-wax is a red stick; then, whatever tests be adopted, he will\nshare with normal persons every sensation except the visual; but none\nthe less will the process of hlillucination be complete. This process,\nthen, is no way parallel to that of normal perception. It is not, as\nthat was, an association between psychical elements belonging to\ndifferent senses; and its sensory part, the essence of which is r!dne8s,\nis not-as in the normal perception of a red object--receiwd by the\nbrain, but is imp088d by it. By what right can processes 80 different\nbe represented as co-ordinate-as the healthy and the morbid exercise\nof the same function 1\n5. Casu wI\"\"! External Excitation is Doubtful.\nSo far I have considered M. Binet's theory only in relation to his\nown cases-'\\'\\\"here it was easy to concede the fact of excitation from\nwithout, whatever be our view of its share in the phenomena. It\nremains to consider the numerous cases-the large majority of the\nwhole body of hallucinations-where this excitation is itself doubtful,\nor more than doubtful. Let us take the doubtful cases first.\nIn the optical experiments it was, of course, convenient that the\nhiillucination should be projected on 0. flat opaque surface; and on such\na surface the objective points de repere may be easily found. But it is\nquite as easy to make the patient Ree objects in free spo.ce-say, out\nin the middle of the room ; and such is the common form of spontaneous\nhallucinations, both of ss.ne and insane persons, where human figures\nare seen. The eyes are then focussed, not on the real objects from\nwhich points de repere would luive to be supplied, but on the figure\nitself; which may be much nearer than the wall behind it, and may\nthus require a very different adjustment of the eyes. And here lies\na difficulty for the hypothesis that the hallucination depends on some\ndefinite external excitation of the retina. For the real objects which\nare the supposed excitants, though in the line of sight, are not within\nthe range of clear vision for eyes adjusted to the imaginary object.\nCan the points de repere be supposed to excite a percept whose position\nis such that, for it to be clearly visible, they themselves must cease\nto be 80 1 It is a good deal to require of them. Still, M. Binet's\nexperiment with the insane patient is a very striking one. This woman,\nCelestine by name, had an imaginary attendant called Guiteau.\nGuiteau lent himself to scientific tests, and was doubled by a prism and\nreflected by a mirror in the most orthodox fashion. This undoubtedly\nimplied points de repere-probably situated near, and not on, the area\nwhich Guiteau concealed. One would like, however, to know exactly\nhow his figure was situated in relation to its background. The distance\nDigitized by Google\n\f168 Hallucination\u2022\u2022\nbetween the two may have been ir.considerable; and in that case the\nfact of the doubling and the reflection would not prove the pointB de\nrepere to have been an essential condition of the hallucination. For,\nwhen the patient is made to look attentively at the figure, as a\npreliminary to the optical tests, the very fixity of the gaze may then\nand there establish the points de repere which will enable those tests\nto succeed. It would be interesting to know whether Guiteau would\nbe l'eflected when he was not being specially stared at, supposing that\nthere was a mirror in an appropriate position.*\nThe supposed necessity of the external excitation might be other-\nwise tested thus. Suppose Oelestine to be placed in a white spherical\nchamber, lit from a point directly above her head. Here there would\nbe no points de repere-no special points of external excitation with\nwhich an imaginary objectcould be connected. The only excitant to the\neye would be perfectly uniforDl white light; and this excitant would\n\u2022 In the ca.se of the hypnotic co subjects,\" a certain peculiarity in the fixed\nregard, such a& might establish poi\"ta de Tepere, is strongly suggested by the\nfollo~ing fact. In some C&8es, after a screen had been interposed between the\npatient's eyes and the imaginary object, she continued to see not only that\nobject (say, a mouse), but a real object (II&Y, a hat) on which it had been placed.\nThus the hat &88umed the property-shared by the imaginary mouse, but\nuushared by any other real objects~f remaining as a percept in spite of an\nopaque barrier.\nAs regards reftexion, the following C&8e from the Society'S collection is of\ninterest; it is from Mr. Adrian Stokes, M.R.C.S., of Sidmouth:-\nco When I W&8 living in Bedford Street North, Liverpool, in the year 1857\n(I think), my wife roused me from sleep suddenly and said, \u2022Oh! Adrian,\nthere's Agnes!' I started up, crying, \u2022Where! \\Vhere !' but, of course,\nthere W&8 no Agnes. My wife then told me that she had awoke, and had seen\nthe form of her only sister, Ab\n'11es, sitting on the ottoman at the foot of the bed.\nOn seeing this foml she felt frightened; but then, recalling her courage, she\nthought if the figure were real she would be able to see it reflected in the mirror\nof tile wardrobe, which she had in full view &8 she lay in bed. Directing her\neyes, therefore, to the mirror, there she saw, by the light of the fire that was\nburning brightly in the grate, the full reflection of the form seated on the\nottoman, looking at It bunch of keys which she appeared to hold in her hand.\nUnder the startling effect caused by this sight, she called me to look at it, but,\nbefore I W&8 awake, the form and its reftexion had vanished. It W&8 not a\ndream, my wife is certain.\nP.S.-When my wife saw her sister sitting at the foot of our bed looking\nat the bunch of keys, she (the sister) W&8 clad in the ordinary indoor dress of the\ntime. I remember the start of surprise with which I awoke and exclaimed.\nMy wife has never, that I know of, experienced any hallucination or delirium;\nand is a woman of excellent sense and judgment. She never saw any other\nvision but that one.\"\nHere, however, the expectant imagination of the percipient may have been\nadequate to conjure up the reflected figure, and the ca.se does not therefore\nsupport M. Binet's theory.\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucinations. 169\nremain identical, in whate,\"er direction the eye turned. Consequently,\nif the external excitation he a necessary factor in the production of\nGuiteau, he ought, if seen at all, to be seen wherever Celp.stine looked;\nthere would be nothing to attach him to any particular spot. It is rash\nto prophesy; but I strongly suspect that he would prove more amenable,\nand that Celestine would retain her power of turning her back on him.\nSuch, in my view, would be the natural result: a figure spontaneously\nprojected by the brain would be located as an independent object, and\nlooked at or not at pleasure. It would be intel'E'.sting to know, further,\nif Guiteau is ever seen in the dark. But it should be observed that\nlight may favour and darkness hinder the projection of a phantasm,\nowing to the different effect of the one r.nd the other on the genera.l\nphysiological state. The presence of light might thus be a necessity,\nquite apart from any distinguishable points de repere. In the same way\nthe presence of light is occasionally found to be a condition of a.uditory\nhallucinations;* which even M. Binet would find it hard to compound\nout of a \" sensation\" of light and an \" image\" of sound.\nBut the difficulty of regarding external points of excitation as a\nnecessary condition becomes even greater when the hallucina.tion is &\nmoving one. As to these cases, M. Binet ca.n only say that the poi1le\nde repe,-e keeps changing; that is, as the imaginary figure passes along\nthe side of the room, in front of a multitude of different object&-\npictures, paper, furniture, &c.-the very various excitations from these\nseveral objects act in tum as the basis of the same delusive image. We\nmay surely hesitate to accept such an assertion, till some sort of proof\nof it is offered; and it is hard to conceive of what nature the proof could\nbe. The case of course differs altogether from that where the imaginary\nfigure follows the movements of the eye, owing to some morbid atfection\nof that organ which acts as a real moving substratum for it. Instead of\nthe figure's following the eye, the eye is now following the figure in its\nseemingly indlilpendent course. What is there to produce or to guide\nthe selection of ever-new points de repere 1 To what external cause can\n?tI. Binet ascribe the perpetual substitution of one of them for another'\nOn my view-that the figure may be centrally initiated, no less than\ncentrally oreated-none of these difficulties occur. Such a figure may\n* Ba.U, L~ons Bur lea Maladies llIenealea, p. 116. See olso the very interest-\ning case given by Profelt8Or F. Jolly in the Archiv fiir Psychiatric, VoL VI.,p.\n495. His paper is on the production of auditory hallucinations by tIe applica-\ntion of an electric current in the neighbourhood of the ear. In one case, he\nshows good reason for attributing the hallucination, not to a stimulation of the\nauditory nerve, but to a transference to the auditory centre of the stimulus\ngiven to fibres of the fifth nerve.

The same sort of\narguu:.ent applies to the case where the percipient is haunted by a figure\nwhich, however, can be seen only in one direction.* Thus Baillarger\ndescribes a doctor who could not tum without finding a little black cow\nat his side. The mind may locate its puppet according to its own\nvagaries; and this experience is yery like a sensory embodiment of the\nwell-known delusion that somebody is always behind one.\nG. Cas\" wllere External Excitation is Ab8ent.\nSo much,then, for M. Binet's hallucinations\" acause objectire.\" We\ntum nowto the vast bodyof caseswhere excitation from the outer world is\nplainlyabsent. This class includes phantasms seen in the dark, and proba-\nblythe yast majority ofauditoryhallucinations,which haveso far been dis-\nregarded. To bring these under M. Binet's theory, it has to be assumed\nthat in every case they are initiated by sonle morbid or abnormal\ncondi~ion of the eye or the ear. The assumption is, to say the least, a.\nvery violent one. We ha\\'e duly noted the cases where hallucinations\nhave been undoubtedly due to injury of the external organ; but this\ndoes not establish, or even strongly suggest, the existence of a. similar\ncondition in cases where it defies detection.t As a. rule, where the\n\u2022 Ball, L\/:fOM8ur lea lIIaladiea 1Ifentalea, p. 73 ; Baillarger, Des Halilldna-\ntiOM, p. 312. Another type of tho moving hallucination is presented by Bayle's\ncase (ReVile Ml.dicale, 182;3, Vol. I. p. 34), where a spider used first to appear\nlife-size, and then gradually to expand till it filled the whole rooUl.\nt The sweepingmethod seems as nmcll in favour now as at the earlier stages\nof the controversy. As M. Binet has stated his case in a masterly way, I need\nnot encnmber the course of the argument by perpetual references to cognate\nstatements. But there is one mode of presenting the rival views which seems so\nestablished in the recent I<'rench literature that it will be well to reproduce it\nhere in a succinct fonn. Writersoiauthority (Prof. Ball in L'EncRpltalc, 1882,\np. 6, and in Maladies Mentales, p. lIl, &c., and Dr. Regis in his classical paper\non unilateral hallucinations in L'Ellcephale, 1881, p. 44), seem never to ha,'e\nconceived the theory of a purely central origin in any other light than as the\n\"projection of an idea outwards \"-0. doctrine wWch they regard as now\nabandoned, and which they refer to only in its most antiquated shape. They\nstart by treating the \"mixed\" or \"psycho-sensorial\" theory as if its point and\npurpose had been to assert that the body counts for something in hallucinations\n--in opposition to the fonner crudely\" psychical\" theory, which made\" the\nimagination\" act independently of any bodily affection. Tiley then point to\ncases where hallucinations have plainly been due to a lesion or morbid irritation\nof the se1l8ory apparatus; and they adopt this morbid condition as the bodily\nelement or physical basis of the phenomenon-that which gives it its mixed\nchlU'aeter and makes it psycho-,en\"orial instead of psychical. Thence they\nAllllert, as n.n indispen'5&ble condition of every hallucination, that the imagination\nnlust be set to work by some .. abnonnall'6lll1&tion\" derived from SOlDe point of\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucinatioll8. IiI\nabnormal condition has been made out, hallucinations have not been its\nonly result. The ulceration of the cornea which initiates visual\nhallucinations has begun by afftlCting the vision ofreal objects. Illusions,\nor false perceptions of colour, often precede the appearance of more\ndistinct phantasms.* So, in cases of more transient abnormality-such\nas the well-known illunon. \"'!Ipn'J,go:Jiqu.es-other signs precede the\nhallucination. The observer, whose eyes are heavy with sleep, begins\nby seeing luminous points and streaks, which shift and change in\nremarkable ways; and it is from these as nuclei that the subsequent\npictures de,-elop. Similarly one of the seers of \"Faces in the Dark\"\n(St. Janl.es's Gazette, February 10th, 15th, and 20th, 1882) described\nthe frequent vision of a shower of goldfln spangles, which changed into\na flock of sheep. Now, since our physiological knowledge leaves 110\ndoubt that the points, streaks and spangles are due to the condition of\nthe retina., it is reasonable in such cases to regard this condition as\ninitiating the hallucination. But it is not equally reasonable to con-\nclude that the process must be the same for cases where the points,\nstreaks and spangles are absent. I do not forget that even a normal\neye is subject to affections which escape attention, until a special effort\nis made to realise them. But wherever the hallucination can be\ngradually traced in its development from more rudimentary sensations,\nthese last are very distinct and exceptional things, unknown in the\nexperience of most of us, and the vision itself is commonly of a changing\nkind-the features developing rapidly out of one another; often also of\na swarming kind-detailed landscapes, elal)orate kaleidoscopic patterns,\nactual lesion. This is both confnsed and confusing. Hallucinations, as we ha'\u00b7e\nBeen, are psycho.sensorial in virtue of their nat\"I\"e, not of their origin-because\nthey present distinct sensory qualities-are things actually aeen and actually\nheard-not because this or that starting\u00b7point can be assigned them. As for\ntheir physical basis, that can be nothing else than a concurrent state of morbid\nactivity at certain cerebral cantres. In some cases this activity is no doubt due\nto lesion at lIome point along the sensory track; in others, as I here contend, it\nmay originate at the centres thelD8elves Bnd may be independent of any excita-\ntion pre\\ious to or other than itself. Whether right or wrong, this contention\nwill certainly not be refuted by confoundingit with the antiquated \"psychical\"\n\\iew, which took no count either of a physical basis or of sensory qualities. As\nfor the \"projection of an idea outwards,\" that of course is an expression of the\nimmediatefact of hallucination, apart from\"the question of the excitant. Why\nshould it be abandoned! Is it not at any rate as well suited to its purpose as\nthe only piece of information that Prof. Ball offers UII in its stead-namely,\nthat hallucinations are the creation of a brain predisposed to create them!\nThe advocacy of the .. cerebral origin\" must, of course, not be taken to\nimply that the condition of the brain is isolated from that of the rest of the body.\nThe abnormal excitability of the brain may be intimately connected with morbid\nconditions elKAwhere: all that is contended is that no immediate sensory stimu-\nlant is needed II.!! a definite basis or peg for hallucinations.\n\u2022 Dr. Max Simon in the Lyo\" Meciical, YoI. xx.\"{V., p. 439.\nDigitized by Google\n\fnallucillation8.\nshowers of flowers, lines of writing on a luminous ground, and so on.*\nNow, compare such experiences with ordinary cases of \"ghost-seeing\"\nin the dark. .A man wakes in the night, and sees a luminous\nfigure at the foot of his bed. Here the hallucination comes sud-\ndenly, single and complete, to a person whose eyes are open\nand unfatigued; it is not preceded by any peculiar affection of vision,\nis not developed out of anything, and does not move, or swarm,\nor develop fresh features; nor does it fulfil M. Binet's test of\nha.llucinations due to the state of the externa.l organ, by moving as the\neye moves.t Such visions are commonly explained-and often, no\ndoubt, with justice-as due to nervousness or expectancy. But ner\\'ous-\nness and expectancy surely act by exciting the mind, not by congesting\nthe retina; they work on the imagination, and their physica.l seat is not\nin the eye, but in the brain. Why, then, should not the brain initiate~\nt,he ha.llucination 1 Why may not \" \"isions of the dark,\" which vary so\ngreatly both in themselves and in the genera.l conditions of their appear-\nance, vary a.lso in their seat of origin 1\nThe auditory cases are even plainer. For it is only exceptionally\nthat the waking ear, like the waking eye, is subjected to marked and\ncontinuous stimulation from without, such as might serve, on M. Binet's\nview, asa basis for a prolonged ha.llucination. It is not even subject to\nLorder-land ellperiences analogous to the illu8ions ltypnagogiqttes. The\nonly alternative, therefore, to supposing the phenomena to be centra.lly\ninitiated, is to suppose some abnormality in the external organ itself.\nSuch an abnormality has often been detected ; and even where not\nabsolutely detected, it may sometimes be inferred from other symptoms.\n~'hus, an enlarged carotid canal, or a stoppage which produces an\nunwonted pressure on the vessels, will first make itself felt by hum-\nmings and buzzings; hallucination then sets in, and imaginary voices\nare heard, and these then we should naturally trace to the local irrita-\ntion that produced the former sounds. But why are we to treat in the\nS8Jlle way cases where there are no hummings and buzzings, and no\n\u2022 Galton, Illqlliric8 into HUlllall Feumlty, pp. 159-163; llaury, Lc Somlllcil\net lcs Ret'cs, p. 331.\nt 1\\1.

The experience\nis often remarkably distinct, causing the hearer to start and tum round.\nIt is not at all connected with conditions that produce blood-pressure,\nsuch as lying with one ear closely pressed on the pillow; it comes in :L\nsudden and detached way, and apparently at quite accidental moments.\nAgain, among the insane a well-known form of hallucination occurs in\nthe form of dialogue; tho patient returns a.nswers to the voices that\nhaunt him, and is answered in tum. Are we to suppose here an\nintennittent abnormality of the ear, which always sets in by chance at\nthe very moment when the imaginary speaker'S replies fall due 7 Itmay\nbe added that even where a distinct morbid cause can be traced, it is as\noften RS not a central cause. After a long course of alcohol, a man\nbegins to hear voices; but alcohol, while admittedly affecting brain,\ntissue, has no recognised tendency to affect the ear.\nA further argument for the central initiation of many hallucinations\nof the more distinctly morbid sort may be drawn from the course which\nthe morbid process takes. The first stage is often not a sensory halluci-\nnation at all; it is a mere delusion; the patient thinks that plots are\nbeing concocted against him. After a time his secret enemies begin to\nreveal themselves, a.nd he hears tbeir abusive and threatening language.\nWe surely cannot ascribe the sensory experience here to a lesion of the\near which happens to occur independently, but regularly, at this parti-\ncular stage; it follows, on the other hand, in the most natural way, if\nwe regard it as imposed from within, as soon as the disease has gone\nfar enough for the mind to clothe its imaginary fears in a more vivid\nform. Specially conclusive in this respect are the cases where voices\nbegin to address the patient in the most internal way, without sound,\nand only after a time talk in a distinctly audible character.* But the\nmost interesting of all th~ cases in point are those where one type of\nhallucination assails one side of the body and another the other. t They\nconfirm what was said above-that the mere fRct of a hallucination\nbeing unilateral, or peculiar to one side of the body, though\nsuggesting a defect in the external organ, is by no means a proof\nof it.: The double sensory experience follows with exactness thA\ncourse of the delusions. The patient first suffers from melancholy\nand discouragement; this develops into a belief that he is surrounded\n\u2022 Griesinger's 11[ellt. Path. alUi TAtr., p. 89. The bearing of this fact on\nthe theory of central origin has been noted by Mr. 8n11y, Illu8ion8, p. 119.\nt See Dr. Magnan's account in the Archit'u de Neurologic, Vol. VI., p. 336.\nt Cf. Dr. A.

To\nthis unhappy stage succeeds in due course onE' of exaltation and self-\nesteem; the patient believes himself to be the Son of God. And now\nencouraging and eulogistic voices present themselves on the left side.\n\"The good and the evil genii form a sort of Manicheism which governs\nhim.\" Here the imagination, as its operations became more complex,\nand established an opposition of character between its creatures, took\nadvantage (so to speak) of the {act that the body has two opposite sides ;\nit located friends and foes just as they might be located in a picture or\nplay which represented an impending contest. It cannot surely be\nmaintained that by accident the right ear began to be locally affected,\njust at the time when the development of the plot necessitated the\nentrance of the friendly power upon the scene. Another case involves\nthe sense of touch. A man, after praying for a year that his actions\nmight be divinely guided, heard a voice say, \"I will save thy soul \"; and\nfrom that time forward he felt his left or his right ear touched by an\ninvisible attendant, according as he was doing right or wrong.* Did\nthe auditory hallucination concide by chance with the commencement\nof local irritation in the pinna 'I Dr. Magnan adds three examples of\nalcoholism, where abuse and threats were heard on one side, praise and\nconsolation on the other. In these cases there were crises of fury, in\nwhich hallucinations of all the senses took place, involving both sides\nalike, and masking the more ordinary condition. On the decline of these\ncrises, the opposed auditory llallucinations recommenced. It seems\nimpossible to resist Dr. Magnan's view, that the poison, distributed\nthrough the whole brain, provokes at times a general crisis; but that\nwhen t.his subsides, it localises its action at the weakest spot. Should\nthis happen to be the auditory centre on one side, a single unilateral\nhallucination would be the result; but if both centres remain affected.\nthe projection may assume the complex two-sided form.\nBut the strongest cases of all in favour of a purely central initiation\nyet remain-the cases of hallucination 'Voluntarily originated.\nWigan's instance has often been quoted, of the painter who, after care-\nfully studying a sitter's appearance, could project it visibly into space,\nand paint the portra.it not from the original but from the phantasm.\nHe ended by confounding the phantasmal figures with real ones, and\nbecame inSane.

Binet\nwill surely not maintain that in these cases the person first\nestablishes, by an effort of will, some sort of periphero.l excitation, and\nthat this then re-e.cts by provoking the hallucination. Such a circuitous\nronte might with equal reason be imagined for any simple act of repre-\nsentation or memory.t\nThe only other group of phenomena that we need notice is\none that all writers since Baillarger seem to have agreed to treat\nas a quite nnique type. It is a class of which frequent examples\nhave been observed among religious mystics and persons who\nbelieve themselves to be in direct communication with spiritual guides.\nSuch persons describe a voice which is yet soundless, which utters the\n\"language of the soul\" inside them, and which they hear by means of\n\"a sixth sense,\" and without any apparent participation of the ear.\nOwing to the absence of a definable sensory quality, Ba.illilorger\ndistingui6hed this cla.ss as p'ycltic hallucinations, in opposition to\npsycltio-8e1lMWiali and M. Binet himself is inclined to treat them as\nexceptional, and to grant them an origin from within. As one who\nholds that that is equally the origin of a large number of the undoubted\nstate. I should thus ascribe the phenomenon to a concentration ofattention on\nactual visual sensations, which fell by habit into the familiar lines. It would\nbe interestiag to know whether, after the spangles had appeared, it was possible\nto cJuck their development into sheep.\n\u2022 ,A\"naluMedico\u00b7psych., 6th series,VoL VII.,p379; Ball, ~[aladie8 MImtaiu,\np.98.

These\" pyschic\"\nhallucinations appear to me as the first stage of a graduated series-the\nembryonic instance of the investiture of an image or representation\nwith a sensory or presentative character. In proportion 11.8 the sensorial\nelement in hallucination is attenuated and dim, or full and distinct,\nwill the perception appear internal or external; and these cases are\nsimply the most internal sort, between which and the most external\nsort there exist many degrees of partial externalisation.* This view has\nsurely e,-erything to recommend it. We can but take the patient's own\naccount-that he has a distinct impression of words; and that this\nimpression has an actuality which clearly separates it from the mere\nimage or memory of words. How can this separation be conceived,\nexcept by recognising the presence of a genuine, though faint, sensorial\nelement 1 Of what exactly this element may consist, is another\nquestion. Dr. Max Simon (in the L1Jo1& Medical, Vol. XXXV., pp. 435,\n486) has made the very plausible suggestion that what is felt is a\nmuscular impulse to form the words, rather than the sound of them-\nan impulse exhibited in its extreme form in the irresistible continuous\nvociferation of mania. On this account Dr. Simon even refuses to\nregard the experience as hallucination at all. Here, however, I cannot\nfollow him. For, however much a motor-current or impUlsion towards\nspeech be involved, the patient's sensation is of something other and\nmore than this. For him, tlie words are not suggested or initiated, but\nactually and completely produced; in his description of the product we\ndo not encounter terms of impulse or movement, any more than terms\nof sound. Here we surely trace the characteristic delusive element:\nwhat a nornlal person would recognise as purely subjective experience\nhas assumed an objective reality. In what then does the experience\nfall short of hallucination 1 If we adopt Dr. Simon's view, so far as\nto regard it as hallucination of the muscular sense, it Lecomps of\ninterest to note that it does not admit of any parallel of a visual sort ;\nfor no order of visible objects can at all rival language in the closeness\nand directness of its association with a particular set of muscular\n\u2022 Our friend, the Rev. P. H.

And this very fact-this abscnce of any si.ghtkss halluci-\nnations to compare with these soundless ones-is perhaps the reason\nwhy the latter have passed as an isolated non-sensory class, with a\nseparate mode of origin. I am concerned to substitute my own view\nof them; for to admit a genuine sensory element in the most \"internal\"\nspecies of hallucination-which all agree to be centrally initiated-will\npractically be to admit a similar initiation for other psycho-sensorial\nhallucinations.\nAnd this leads me to a concluding word of criticism on 1\\1. Binet's\nhypothesis. We have seen that it is violent; may we not add that it\nis gratuitous 1 He has himself most rightly insisted on the fact that\nimages and sensations are not separated by an impassable gulf, but;.\nmerge into one another; and he will allow that in many hallucinations,\nthe image-however evoked-gets charged with the whole fulness and\nvividness of sensation. But then how can it he treated Bimply as an\nimage, superposed on a quite different sensation 1 To recur once more\nto Delbooufs experiment, or to the brown butterfly and the black mice.\nM. Binet will admit that som,ewl~re in the brain activities correspond-\ning to green, to brown, to black, are going on: he is not the writer to\nmake \"the imagination\" bob in among physical facts like a deus e:c\nmac\/tina. By what right, theu, are these activities to be confined to\nideational tracts, and excluded from all access to a true 8en8ory centre 1\nWhat tem?tation is there to strain facts and theories in order to make\nout that the central initiation of sensation is impossible1 The\nhypnotic \"subject\" will smack his lips over the sweetness of sugar\nwhen there is nothing in his mouth-will sniff with delight at 0. piece\nof wood when told it is a rose: may not the brain do for sight and\nhearing what it does for taste and smell1 M. Binet seems really to\nhave been led off the track by his own brilliant experiments with\nprisms and mirrors. Even in those cases, as he admits, t\u00b7he whole work\nof creation is done by the brain. Even for him the gist of the\nexperienc!3 is not the atrophiPd external \" sensation,\" but the\nhypertrophied, brain-imp06ed \"image.\" We do but ask him to\nconcede that the \"image,\" which can here do so much, can else-\nwhere do a very little more and, while charging itself with full sensa-\ntion from within, can dispense with the atrophied contribution from\noutside. Why should it not 1 There is nothing to lead one to suppose\nthat images would assume the unwonted vividness of sensations\nspecially at moments when the external organs of sense are occupied\nwith oUm\" sensations j rather the reverse. Is not the sort of day-drea.m\nwhich comes nearest to hallucination favoured by repose of the sense-\norgans 7 When we want to call up the vivid image of a scene, to make\nit as real-as sensorial-as possible, do we not close our eyes 1 And\nwhat are the seasons of life in which genuine hallucinations are\nN\nDigitized by Google\n\fli8 Hallucinatwm.\ncommonest 1 Are they not seasons of sleep 'I Are not dreams by far\nthe most familiar instances of the projection hy the mind of images\nthat are mistaken for realities 1 It is just because they are so familiar,\nand waking-hallucinations comparatively so rare, that we are in danger\nof overlooking the essential similarity of the phenomena, and the light\nwhich the former class can throw on the latter. Indeed, if waking-\nhallucinations are to be taken as the pathological form of any normal\nfunction, much might be said for taking them as the pathological form\nof dreaming; and we might present the waking-dreams of haschisch-\npoisoning as a sort of intermediate link. The normal dream disappears\nwhen sleep departs; having been able to impose its imagos as realities\nonly because in sleep our sensory faculties are to a great extent be-\nnumbed, and images cannot therefore be compared with actual presen-\ntations Thus the normal dream cannot survive the corrective which\nthe contact of the waking-senses with the external world supplies; it\nfades like a candle at sunrise; and its images, if they survive, survive\nas images and nothing more, emptied of all robust sensory quality.\nThe hallucination, or pathological dream, on the other hand, does not\nrequire to be thus guarded from comparison with real presentations ;\nits \"hypertrophied images\" are able to resist the normal corrective,\nfor they are often as fully charged with sensory quality as the extel1\\aJ\nrealities which compete with them. But though we may thus regard\nhallucinations as a pathological form of dream, what is here more in\npoint is the converse view-that dreams are a healthy form of halluci-\nnation. For it cannot but appear less likely that excitation of the\nexternal organs is a necessary basis for hallucinations. if hallucinations\nturn out to be most common at precisely those times when the external\norgans are least excited.\n6. T1Ul qtte8tion of Cerebral Localisation.\nWe may now proceed to an altogether different question-namely,\nat what part or parts of the brain the creative process takes place, and\nin what it can be conceived to consist. The distinction that has 80\nlong occupied us, between celltral and peripheral initiation, may hence-\nforth be dismissed; for wherever initiaud, hallucinations are assuredly\ncreaua by the brain from its own resources. An initiating stimulus\nmay probably come from any point on the line from the external organ\nto the central terminus, along which a nervous current passes in our\nnormal perception of objects. But that stimulus will clearly not\ndetermine what the imaginary object shall be, or invest it with any of\nits qualities: it will merely set the creative machinery in motion; and\nthe same stimulus-the same in1lammation of the eye or ear-may set\nthe machinery in motion a hundred times, and each time evoke a\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucillatiom. 179\ndifferent hallucination. Where, then, and what, is this creative\nmachinery 7 It would be out of place here to attempt any minute\na.ccount of the various theories, which have for the most part rested on\nanatomical observations; and the more so, that their details are still8ub\njudice. But in a more general way the problem can be stated, and even\nI think to some extent determined.\nIf we begin at the beginning, we find agreement among the -\na.uthorities up to a certain point. All are agreed in recognising 8Q1M\npart or parts of the brain in which the nerves passing from the various\nsense-organs terminate, and where the impressions conveyed by the\nnerves produce the changes which are the physical basis of sensa-\ntion, or-in the Ol'dinary crude but convenient language-where\n\" impressions are transformed into sensations.\" As to the locality and\nextent of these parts, there is a conflict of views, which may be to some\nextent reconciled if we regard the process as taking place in several\nstages. Some (Luys, Ritti, Fournie) believe the principal scene of action\nto be the large central masses called the optic thalami; others (SchrOder\nvan del' Kolk, ~eynert, Kandinsky) would place the centres lower down\n-that of vision, for instance, in the corpora quadrigemina ; others a.ga.in\n(Hitzig, Ferrier, Tamburini) locate them higher up, in the cortex itself ;\nand Goltz assigns them so diffused. an area that the word centre\nbecomes scarcely appropriate. But all are agreed, I imagine, that\nthey are distinct from the tracts associated with the most highly-\ndeveloped phenomena of consciousness-complete perception, idea-\ntion, memory, and volition; and even if the idea of local separation\nshould come to be modified in the direction indicated by Goltz, the\ndistinctions would be re-interpreted as differences of less and more\ncomplex activities. The authorities agree further in connecting the\n\"sensory centres\" in a special way with hallucinations. It could not,\nindeed, be otherwise when once the full sensory character of the\nphenomena is recognised; for that character can only be the psychical\nexpression of changes at the sensory centres. Any particular activity\nof these centres which reaches a certain intensity will affect us as a\nparticula.r sensation; whether excited (1) normally, from the sense-\norgan; or (2) pathologically, by local irritation of the sens6-0l'gan of\nalong the line of nerve from it to the centre; or (3) pathologically, but\nspontaneously, in the centre itself. In the first case the sensation will\nbe a true one, i.e., will correspond with 0. real external object; in the\nsecond and third cases it will not; but as sensation, it will be the same\nin all three.\nNow for one view of the creation of hallucination!!. these\ndata are sufficient. We haye only to suppose that, in cases\n(2) and (3), the agitation at the sensory centre falls readily\ninto certain lines and combinations, so as not only to produce a large\nN 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f180 Hallucination8.\nvariety of sensations-colours, if it be the visual centre, sounds, if it\nbe the auditory one-but to arrange these elements in various definite\ngroups. Everything will now proceed precisely as if these effects had\nbeen due to the presence of a real object. The excitation will pursue\nits ordinary upward course to the highest parts of the brain, and will\nlead to intelligent perception of the sensory group as an object; while\nby a yet further process (which will probably take place only in the\nmost complete or \"external\" form of hallucinations), a refluent\ncurrent will pass downwards to the external organ, and the perception\nwill be referred to the eye or ear, just as though its object were really\nacting on those organs from outside.\u00b7 There then is the full.fledged\nhallucination; and its creative machinery, according to this view, lies\nwholly in the sensory centre.\nBut there is another \"iew. We have noted tltree ways in which the\nmachinery may be set in motion; but there is a\/ou1\u00b7tlt possible way.\nThe excitation may come downwards from the higher part of the brain\n-from tho seats of ideation and memory. And clearly this sort of\nexcitation will have a dominance of its own. It will have its oU'n\npsychical counterpart-an idea or a memory; and when it sets the\nsensory machinery in motion, that machinery will not now produce or\ncombine a group of sensations determined by its own activity; but will\nmerely embody, or as we might say execute, the idea or memory\nimposed on it. Here, then, the only machinery which is in any sense\ncreative is situated in the higher ideational tracts. And if we wish\n\u2022 Kraft\"t-Ebing, Die Sillllll8cleliriell, p. 11; Despine, Etutlc ScielitijiqlllJ 811r\nle Somnambllli811lIJ, p. 328; Tamburini in the Rrvue Sciclltijique, 1881, p. 139_\nThe mere subjecth'e fact of this reference to the external organ would not\nprove (as Tamburini seems to 8R8ume) that the organ had been actually excited\nby the refluent current. But, in the case of vision, we have at. any rate a fair\namount of proof. I\"irst, there is the fact already noted, that pressure on the\nRide of oue eyeball doubles the phantom. It seems difficult to refer this result\nto a880Ciation-the doubling of ordinary objects by such pressure being an\ninfrequent and little noticed experience. ~econdly, we have a case of hcmiopi(~\nhallucination recorded by Dr. Pick, of Prague, where only the upper halves of\nimaginary figures were seen; and where it was ascertainell t\\1at the upper half\nof the retina (to which of collrse the lower half of the figure wou1<1 have corre\u00b7\nsponded) was anopic. Further, it has been noted by H\u2022 .Meyer of \" hypnagogic\nillusions,\" and by Gruithuisen of hallucinations which consist in the lIurvhing\nof dream-images into waking moments, that they cau give rise to after-images .-\ntllis, however, might perhaps not imply more than the brief continuance of\nllxcitation at the cmtral cells.\nWundt (PhY8. P'.'Icll., Yol. II., p. 336) seems to tbink that this centrifugal\nretinal stimulation is excluded in the cases where the phantom does not mOI-e\nwith the movement of the eye. But, there being a physical procel8 correspond-\ning to the idea of a stationary phantom, why may not that process extend to\nthe whole carrying out of the idea, 80 as to include the turning on or off of the\nretinal stimulation according as the phantom iii looked at or away from! '\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucinatu\u00bbl8. 181\nto identify the exact starting-point of the hallucination, as such, we\nmust fix it at the point of contact between the ideational and the\nsensory activities. As long as the nervous activity is con-\nfined to the ideational tracts, though there is creation, there\nis no hallucination; that word is never usad to describe the\nmere image or memory of an object. It is only when the activity\nescapes downwards, with such force as strongly to stimulate the cells at\nthe lower centre, that sensation floods the image, and we get the delusi\"e\npercept or hallucination. The force of this downward current may\nexhibit all degrees. It is probable that even for the barest idea or\nmemory of an object there is some slight downward esca.pe, with a\ncorresponding slight reverberation of the sensory centre ; and where, as\nin rare morbid cases,* the escape is wholly barred, all power of calling\nup visual images is lost. With every increase in the\nforce of the escape, there will be a rise of sensory quality,\nand a nearer appr:oach to absolute hallucination; and every\nstage will thus be accounted for, from the picture \"in the mind's\neye\" to the phantom completely extemalised in space. But whatever\nthe degree of the delusion, its local origin is the place where the current,\n80 to speak, bursts the sluice-gates which physically represent the dis-\ntinction between ideas and percepts.\nHere, then, are the two possibilities: (1) that hallucinations are\nproduced by an independent activity of the specific sensory cells-the\nsensations which arise there being perceived as ohjects when the ner-\nvous current passes on centripetally to the higher parts of the brain;\n(2) that the part played by the specific sensory cells t is only a\nresponse to what may be called ideational excitation, propagated\ncentrifugally from the higher tracts where the image has been formed.\nIn attempting to decide between these possibilities, we shall get\nlittle assistance from direct pathological and physiological observa.-\ntiOD& These have been mainly directed to an end rather the\nconverse of ours-to utilising the facts of hallucination for fixing\nthe locality of the centres, by inspection of the brains of persons\nwho have been in life markedly hallucinated.

J. Micklet considers-as the result of a number of very careful\nnecropsies-that in cases of hallucination \"thalamic disease plays a less\nimportant part than cortical.\" But on the other hand, he did not find\nthat the lesions were definitely associated with the spots in the cortex\nwhich Ferrier and the advocates of restricted cortical localisation mark\nout as the \\isual and the auditory centres; while lesions at these\nspots-the angular gyrus and the first temporo-sphenoidal convolution-\nseem to be found in cases where no hallucination has been observed.t\nThis want of correspondence will seem less surprising if we remember\nthe vast number of casual hallucinations where notlling that could be\ncalled a lesion exists; and also that the more persistent hallucinations\nof the insane belong, as 0. rule, to the earlier period of irritation,\nrather than to the later one when marked lesion has supervened, and\ndementia is creeping on.\u00a7 Even if we take subsequent cortical lesion\nas 0. sign that the weak spot existed from the first in the highest part of\nthe brain, this would be no proof that the specific sensory centre is\ncortical. If lesions are not bound to be locally restricted, much less\nare irritations; and there is nothing to refute the supposition above\nmade, that, when the hallucination occurs, 0. current has passed down-\nwards to the lower centre--the mischief in the cortex having been\nprimarily an excitant of ideational activities only, and the hallucination\nbeing due (as Dr. Mickle well expresses it) to \"a tumultuous disorderly\nreaction of disturbed ideational centres upon sensorial.\" The same\nmay be said of the artificial irritation of the \" cortical centres\" during\nlife. Ferrier regards the movements which result when an ele.ctrical\nstimulus is applied to these areas, as an indication that visual or\nauditory sensations (i.e., hallucinations) have been evoked. We may\nquite accept this interpretation, but still suppose that the primary seat\nof the sensa~ion was not the spot where the stimulus was applied, but\na lower centre on the path along which the irritation passed.U\n\" Gazette de&Hupitallx, Dec., 1880, p. 46.\nt Jourllal of 1Ilclltal Scicltce, Oct., 1881, p. 382.\nt Journal oj lIfClltal Science, Oct., 1881, p. 381, and Jan., 1882, p. 29.\n~ Luys, Gazette dca Hupitctllx, 1881, p. 2i6; Despine, Ann. lIItdico-psyclt.,\n6th series, Vol. VI., p. 3i5; Tamburiniin the RcvlIc Sciclltifiqu6, Vol. XXVII.,\np. 141.\nII It may be remarked, by the way, that what bas been here said &8 to tbe\nrelation of hallucinatioll8 to cerebral localisation will apply, mutatis mlltandis,\nto blindllC8S.

Thus the fact that\nblindness follows certain cortical lesions does not by any means establish tbe\nlocation of the principal sensory centres in the cortex. And as it happens, some\nof the facts of blindness seem absolutely adverse to that location-I mean the\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucilJation8. 183\nWe are thus thrown Lack on less direct arguments, derived from the\nnature of the hallucinations thelnselves. And I think the mistake has\nagain been in imagining that one or other of two alternatives must be\nexclusively adopted-that either the lower or the higher origin of\nhallucinations is the universal one. All, I think, that can be fairly\nsaid, is that, while the first mode of origin is a probable one for some\ncases, the second mode is a certain one for others. Hallucinations pro-\nduced at tlte will of the percipient must first take shape above the\nsenilory centres. For it is indisputable that tho idea of the object to\u00b7be\nprojt'cted-the picture, face, sentence, or whatever it may be-must\nprecede its sensory embodiment as a thing actually seen or heard; and\nthe idea, as well as the volition, is an affair of the higher tracts; :MM.\nLuys and Ritti will certainly not locate either of them in the optic\nthalami. But if the advocates of the first mode have thus ignored an\nimportant class of cases, the advocates of the second have erred';by adopt-\ning a quasi-metaphysical standpoint. Thus Dr. Despine, who has given\nan extremely clear account of the centrifugal process (Annale, Medico-\npl!Jclwlogique\" 6th series, Vol.VI.,p. 371),a.rgues that for a hallucination\nto arise, we first need an idea-It an object wlticlt doe, 1wt exi,t\"; and\nif in a way it is endowed with existence, this, as 80 purely constructive\nact, can only emanate from the seat of the highest psychical activities.\nThere is some originality in extracting a physiological conclusion from\nthe relation of the mind to the non-existent. But at this rate the image\nof the sun's disc on the wall would originate in a constructive act of\nthe mind: it is as much \"an object that does not exist\" as the most\nelaborate phantasm. 'fhe non\u00b7existence of an object outside the\norgani!im is quite irrelevant to the course of nervous events inside; and\nwhether we regard a psychic act, for any gil-en case, as comtructiv6 or\nreceptive, depends simply on whether the nervous excitation is spon-\nphenomena of so-called \"psychical blindness,\"where cortical lesion.has produced\n1088 of memory and of the higher functions of perception, while Be1l8atiol&\n(according to Munk's view) remains intact, and may gradually give rise to new\nperceptions and new memories. The observations of Munk and Goltz as to the\nsurvival of vision, though not of intelligent vision, after extensive cortical injury,\naeem distinctly fa,\u00b7ourable to the theory of the lower position of the specific\nsensory centres. Nor need that theory conflict with the most extreme dew as\nto the absence of circumscribed areas in the cortex. Goltz himself would not\ndeny that B07ne place or places on the pathfl of the optic and the auditory nerve\nare specially connected with the fact that tho fltimulation of the one correspondfl\nl\\ith 8igltt, amI ot the other with sound. It cannot be maintained that this\nPIIychical distinction has no local repre.~ntative ; for such a contention would\nlogically lead to denying, e.g., that the corpora qUadrigemina in the lower\nanimals have any particular relation to ~ision. Thns, whatever be the final\ni88ue of the vexed question of cortical areas of perception, a local distinction of\ngenuine centres of 81l1l8ation 80mewhere in the brain seems as certain as the\ndistinction of the external organs themselves.\nDigitized by Google\n\f184 Hallucinati0n8.\ntaneous, or is received from below. Now this may be applied, as we\nhave seen, to the lower centres of sensation as reasonably as to the\nhigher tracts of perceptive ideation; the former Dlay construct as truly\nas the latter; that is to say, the configurations and activities of their\ncells may produce de6nite groupings of the sensory elements.\nAnd for simple and recurrent forms of hallucination, much may be\nsaid in favour of this lower origin. It is in accordance with all that\nwe know or conjecture as to nerve-tissue, that certain configurations\nand modifications of cells would be rendered easy by exercise; and thus\nthe changes to which any morbid excitement gives rise might naturally\nbe the same as have often before been brought about bynormal stimulation\nfrom the retina or the ear. The elements would fall readily, so to\nspeak, into the accustomed pattern. An object which has been\nfrequently or recently before the eyes---a. word or phrase that has been\nperpetually in the ear-these may certainly be held capable of leaving\norganic traces of their presence, and so of establishing a sort of\nlower memory. That this lower memory should act automatically,\nand independently of the will, seems natural enough when\nwe remember how large a part even of the higher memory\nis also automatic: an unsought word, suddenly reverberating in\nthe sensorium, is on a. par with the images that emerge into\nconsciousness without our being able to connect them witll our previous\ntrain of ideas. Now it is remarkable how large a number of hallucina.-\ntions are of this primitive type. I mentioned above that. among the\nsane, the commonest of all cases is to hear the name called; and even\nwith the insane, the vocabulary of the imaginary voices often consists\nof only a few threatening or abusive words.* So of optical hallucinations.\nWith the sane, a large number consist in the casual vision-an after-\nimage, as we might say-of a near relative or familiar associate. More\npersisten~ cases are still frequently of 0. single object. I have mentioned\nthe doctor and the black cow; similarly a lady, when in bad health,\nalways saw a cat on the staircase.t And among the insane, a single\nimaginary attendant is equally common: our friend \"Guiteau\" above\nwas an instance. Wherever such simple cases are not C01l1lected with\nany special cielire, or ~ny fixed set of ideas, they may, I think, be fairly\n(though of course not certainly) attributed to an activity following the\nlines of certain established tracts in the sensorium. We might compare\nthis locality to a kaleidoscope, which when shaken is capable of turning\nout a certain limited number of combinations.t\n\u2022 On this subject, see Dr. V. Parant in the An1l. Medj,co-psyclt., 6th \/!eries,\nVol. VII., p. 384. These embryonic hallucinations often develop into more com-\nplex form; see Ball, A-faJadiuMentalu, p. 67.\nt Blandford, IlIsanity and ita Treatment, p. 155.\nt Charcot (LIl Progrts Jltdical, 1878, p. 38) has noted a curious form of\nDigitized by Google\n\fHallucillatiOtl8. 185\nBut, on the other hand, the astonishing variety and complexity of\nother casAs-whether visual appearlLnces or verbal sequences-seem\nabsolutely to drive us to a higher seat of manufacture; for they demand\na. countless store of elementa, and limitless powers of ideal combination.\nThe pa.tient listens to long discourses, or holds conversations with his\ninvisible friends; and what is heard is no echo of former phra.ses, but\nis in every way a piece of new experience. So, too, the number and\nvariety of visual hallucinations which may occur to a single person,\nsometimes even within the space of a few minutes, is astonishing. The\nshapes and features of Dr. Bostock's apparitions were always completely\nnew to him; the seers of \"Faces in the Dark\" who had in the course\nof their lives seen many thousand phantasmal faces, had never seen one\nthat they recognised; Nicolai, who was never otherwise than\nperfectly sane and who eventually recovered, continually saw\ntroops of phantoms, most of them of an aspect quite new to\nhim; and in insanity such a phenomenon is common enough.\nEven in the casual hallucinatious of the sane, what is seen is less com-\nmonly a. mere revival of an object which the eyes have previously\nencountered than an unrecognised person. Here, then, we have an\nimmense amount of high creative work-of what in psychical terms we\nshould call par excellence the work of the imagination; and this is work\nwhichwe have good grounds for supposing that the highest cortical tracts,\nand they alone, are capable of performing. From our experience of the\nnumber and mobility of the ideas and images that the mind in 0. normal\nstate can summon up and combine, we know that the cells of the\nhighest cerebral areas are practically unlimited in their powers\nof configuration and association; but we have no right to assume\nthe same inexhaustible possibilities as existing independently in\nany specific sensory centre-we might almost as well expect 0.\nkaleidoscope t.., present us with an ever-fresh series of elaborate land-\nscapes. And over and above all this, we can point to the constant\nconnection between the delusions, the conception8 delirantes of the\ninsane and their sensory hallucinations,\u00b7 which makes it almost im-\nunilateral hallucination, which occurs sometime!! to hysterical patients on the\nside on which they are hemianrosthetic-animals, passing rapidly in a row from\nbehind forwards, which usually disappear when the eyes are turned directly to\nthem. Examined by the ophthalmoscope, the eyes of these patients appear\nabsolutely normal. Charcot attributes amblyopy and achromatopsy, occurring\nin the same personA (as well as in non-hysterical cases of hemianresthesia), to\nlesion at a point which he calls the carre\/our leW\/itij in the hinder part of the\ninternal capsule; and I assume that he would refer the hallucination to the\nsame point.

The conclusion seems to be that for many\nhallucinations the mode of origin can be no other than what I have\ncalled the centrifugal.\nI have throughout tried to express what I have called the centri-\nfugal theory in such terms that it might be accepted even by those who\nlocate the sensory centres themselves not below, but in, the cortex.\nAccording to these physiologists, the whole double transformation oi\nphysical impressions into visual or auditory sensations, and of these\nsensations into complete pcrceptions and mnemonic images, would be\npractica.!ly referred to one place. It must be admitted that t.his view seems\nattimes connectedwiththewant of aduepsychological distinctionbetween\nsensation and perception. But even suppo$ing a specific centre of\nsensation to be thus equally the seat of psychic functions higher than\nsensation, it would still be none the less liable to be stimula.ted by parts\nof the cortex external to itself; and the nature of many hallucinations\nwould still indicate that they depend on this stimulation, and not on a\nmere spontaneous quickening of morbid activity in the centre itself.\nFor instance, a girl is violently distressed by seeing her home in\n,flames, and for days afterwards sees fire wherever she looks.* One\nmust surely trace the ha.!lucination to the distrlll;8, and so to an\n\"escape of current\" from the seat of ideas and imal)'tls other than\nvisual ones. Again, in the cases described above where the\nhallucinations faithfully reflect the changes of the whole moral\nand intellectual bias, the local excitement in the sensory centre\nwould still be traceable to an abnormally strong irradiation\nfrom the regions where the highest co-ordinations take place\n-these regions being themselves, CJ; Itypotltesi, already in a\nstate of pathological activity. The other hypothesis would be that\nthe mere hyper-excitability at the centre itself made it impossible for\nimages to arise without getting hurried on, so to speak, into sensations\nhy the violence d the nervous vibrations. This seems to be what\n'Vundt has in view when he speaks of hallucinations as originating, not\nin an actual irritation, but ill a heightened irritability, of the sensory\ncentres. But then, what should cause images belonging to olle\nparticular order of ideas-the diseased order-to be picked out for this\nfa.te in preference to any others 1 The hyper-excitable centre in itself,\nas an arena of images, could have no ground for such a partial selection\namong the crowd of them which emerge during every hour of waking\nlife.

The unique a.greement between\nthe sensory hallucinations and the more general moral and intellectual\ndisorder must have its particular physical counterpart; and for this \" a.\nstrong downward escape of current\" is at any rate a sufficiently compre-\nhensible metaphor.*\n7.- V'eridical Hallucinations.\nThere is one topic which I call1lot altogether pass o,\u00b7er here, as it has\na distinct bearing on the centrifugal origin of hallucinations. There is a\nclass of phenomena, not yet recognised by science, and for which the\nevidence has never yet been presented with anything like convincing\nfulness; but which-I do not think it rash to say-will be accepted as\ngenuine by a large number of persons who quite realise the strength of\nthe a priori presumption against it, whenever the quantity and quality\nof the evidence shall be adequately realised; and which is accepted\nalready by a coru;iderabifl numbcr of such persons as, at any rate,\nhaving a strong prima facie claim to attention. Readers of these\nProceedings will hardly need to be told that I refer to the\ntelepat\/'ic class-hallucinations of sight,. sound or touch, which\nsuggest the presence of an absent person, and which occur simul-\ntaneously with some exceptional crisis in that person's life or,\nmost frequently of all, with his death. Visual and auditory phan-\ntasms occurring at such moments may be conveniently termed VeT\"i-\ndical hallucinations; for while they are completely delusive as far as\nthe percipient's senses are concerned-while they completely conform to\nour definition, \" sensory percepts which lack the objective basis which\n\u2022 KandinsJ..-y (in the Archivfiir PsgcMatric, 1881), agreeing with Meynert,\ndenies this centrifugal influence, and regards the contribution of the highe!\u00b7\n(front) part of the cortex to hallucinatious as something quite different-i.e., tlu:\nremissio\" ofan inMbitoryfUliction normally exercised by this part on the apecific\n8ellllOry regions. But he fails to make out even a plausible case. Hia argument\nthat the higher part cannot initiate hallucinations restsonno better ground than\nlIis own inability, when auffering from hallucinations, to transform mental\npictures into hallucinations at will ; and on the further experience-which was\ndecidedly exceptional-that his haUucinations did not correspond in any marked\nway witll his more general mental delusions. Again, if one asks in what the\neffect of the supposed inhibitory function would normally be shown, it must\naurely be in preventing ordinary mental images from taking on the more vivid\ncharacters of hallucination,. No,v Kandinsky hirnself admits that in normal\nacts of imagination the cortical sensory region is stimulated from the higher part\nof the cortex; hence he seems im\u00b7olved in the difficulty of conceiving stimula\u00b7\ntion and inhibition to proceed at the same moment from the same quarter. Nor,\nagain, does he make any attempt to show why the supposed inhibitory function,\nif it is normally operative, does not equally inhibit the normal stimulation de\u00b7\nrived from the periphery, i.e., normal perception of objects.\nDigitized by Google\n\f188 Hallucinations.\nthey suggest\"-they nevertheless have n. definite correspondence with\ncertain o~jective facts, namely, the exceptional condition of the absent\nperson. Such cases, if genuine, militate very strongly against M. Binet'8\ntheory that excitation from the external sensory apparatus is a sine qud\nnon of hallucinations. For here the occurrence of the hallucination\ndepends on the distant event; tllat is what fixes it t.o take place at II.\nparticular time; and an occurrence thus conditioned cannot be supposed\nto be conditioned also by the accidental presence of real phenomena.\ncapable of supplying points de repere, or by an accidental morbid dis-\nturbance of the organ or the nerve. Andif the brain be admitted to be the\nprimary physical seat of the phenomena, there are, further, good reasons\nf01\" supposing that it!! highest tracts are those first affected, and so that\nthe hallucina.tion is centrifugal. The chief reasons a.re two. (1) The\nphantasm is often bodied forth with elements of a more or less fanciful\nkind-dream-imn.gery, so to speak, embroidered on II. groundwork of\nfact; and these clements seem clearly to be the percipient's own contri-\nbution, and not part of what he receives. (2) Cases occur where actunl\nintercourse between the two persons concerned has long ceased; and\nwhere the supersensuous communication can only be supposed to be\ninitiated by the quickening of long-buried memories and of dim tracts of\nemotional association. The hallucination in these cases would thereforc\nbe a complete example of the projection of an idea from within\noutwards; the sensorium reverberates to n. tremor which must start ill\nthe inmost penetralia of cerebral process.\n[NoTE.-I would specially point out that the argument in the last para-\ngraph does not extend beyond the limits of the percipient's organism. It\ninvulves no physical expreBBion of the fact of the transmission. If A is dying\nat a distance, and B sees his form, it is rarely that one can suppose any\npsychical event in A's mind to be identical with any psycltical event provo-\ncative of the hallucination in B's mind. That being so, there will be no\nsimple and immediate concorda.nce of nervous vibration in the two brains;\nand that being so, there is no very obvious means of translating into physical\nterms the causal connection between A's experience and B's. The C8.Be thus\ndiffers from .. thought-transference\" of the ordinary experimental type,\nwhere the image actually present in the one minc:lis reproduced in the other;\nwhere, therefore, a physical concordance does exist, and something of the\nnat.ure of a \" bl\"\"doin\u00b7wave\" can be conceived.

This\nseems rather to 8BBume that the standing puzzle of the relation between\ncerebral and psychical events ill the illd,,,idual, B, can only be stated in one\ncrude form-viz., that the former aro prior and prodlICe the latter. For ordi-\nnary purposes such an expreuion is convenient ; but the convenience has\nits dangers. Still, as the converse proposition would be equally dangerou8,\na en,;!: remains which we cannot evade. Since we cannot doubt that\nB's unwonted experience has its appropriate cerebral correlate, we have to\nadmit that the energy of B's brain is directed in a way in which\nit would not be directed but for something that has happened to\nA. In this physical e1l'ect it is impouible to 8BBume that an external\nphysical antecedent is not involved; and the relation of th\" antecedent to\nthe e1l'ect is, as I have pointed out, very hard to conceive, when the neural\ntremors in A's bmin are so unlike the neural tremors in B's brain as they\nmust be when A's mind is occupied with his immediate surroundings 01'\nwith the idea of death, and B'a mind is occupied with a sudden and un-\naccountable impreuion or vision of A. I can only suggest that the\naction of brain on brain is not bound to conform to the simplest type\nof two tuning-forks; and that a considerable community of experience\n(elIpecWly in emotional relatiol1ll) between two pel'8OnB may involvo\nnervous records sufficiently similar to retain for one another some sort\nof revivable affinity, even when the experience has lost its vividneu\nfor conscious memory.

Another person makes 0.\nguess as to what the choice has been. This experiment-a choice by\none party, a guess by another-is pp,rformed N times. The number of\nsuccessful guesses exceeds the numher which is the most probable on\nthe supposition of mere chance, viz., 1Il, where m=Nu (in the above-\nmentioned cases respectively iN and ~\"..v), hy a considemble number n,\nwhere n=.Vv. There follow a second and a third similar series of trials\nin which the number of successes exceeds the number most probable on\nthe hypothesis of mere chance, viz., N'u' Nquq, by ,,: t~q respectively.\nAs the number of these series is increased, there occur some in which\nthe numher of successes falls below the most probable number. What\nprobability in favour of the existence of some agency other than chance\nis afforded by (I) a single series such as the first, in which the successes\nare in excess; (2) a set of series such as the first two or three, in all\nof which the successes are in excess; (3) a chequerecl set of series in\nsome of which the successes are in exce!'lS, ill others in defect 7\nThese problems may, for our purpose, be replaced by the following:\nOut of an urn known to contain an infinite number of white and black\nballs in the proportion u : l-u have been dmwn N balls whereof N\n(u + v) are white; and again N' balls whereof N' (u + v~ are white;\nand so on. v is sometimes negative. What is the probability in favour of\nagency other than chance deducible (1) from the first series; (2) from\na set of series in which 11 is positive; (3) from a chequered set of series T\nThe evaluation of such a posteriori probabilities involves three\nDigitized by Google\n\fTI,e Calculu8 oj Probabilitie8. 191\noperations which may be distinguished in analysis, though implicated\nin practice. The first (I.) is to determine what junction the required\nprobability is of two scts of variables; namely, (c priori probabilities not\ngiven by (01' deducible from) direct statistical experience, and\" objective\"\nprobabilities (to use the phrase of Cournot), which are deriyed from\nstatistical experience. The second operation (II.) is the treatment of\nthe (c priori probabilities; the discovery, assumption, or ignoration of\nthose unknown quantities. The third operation (III.) is the evaluation\nof the objective probabilities. These three operations are taken as the\nprinciple of division for this study; as a principle of subdivision, the\nthree problems aboye stated.\nI. There is apt to appear something arhitrary in the form of the\nfunction expressing an (~posteriori probability. 'Vhen Donkin, for\nexample, constructs a scheme expressing the probability that chessmen,\nfound standing on a board in a certain position, or that neighbouring*\nstars, haye ~ot been so arrnnged by mere chance, one does not feel very\nconfident that tlte formula, not merely a formula, is assigned by him.\nIt should be observed, however, first that an identical value may be\nreached in different ways; very much as a multiple integral may be\nexpressed in different forms. Secondly, and more importantly, there is IL\ncharacteristic defectt of the calculus of probability, which leads us to\nexpect a real discrepancy in the methods of perfol'ming our first\noperation. I allude to the fact that we are often unable to utilise all\nour datum, to calculate t,he relatiye probabilities (in favour of mere\nchance or some additional agency) for the particular eyent observed, but\nonly for a class to which that event belongs. And there is something\narhitrary in the selection of this class. An examplet of this peculiarity\nwill presently appear.\n(1) For the solution of our first problem two schemata present\nthemselves, each recommended by high authority; the first perhaps\nmore frequently employed in problems of the general sort to which ours\nbelongs, the second, I think, more appropriate to our particular problem.\nAccording to the (a) first solution we regard the observed event-the\ndrawing of N (u+v) white balls-as having resulted from some real\nconstitution or proportion of the balls in the urn, some \"possibility,\"\nin the phrase of Laplace. By inverse probability, upon the principle of\nBaya'!, we determine the probability that this constitution, or possibility,\nor cause of the observed event, was some ratio higher than u.\nLet q, (x) be the a priori probability that the sought ratio should have\nheen the particular ratio N' Let j (x) be the objective probability\nthat, if x : (N~x) were the real distribution of the balls, then exactly\n\u2022 Phil. jfag., series IV., Vol. I., pp. 463-466.\nt Of, Venn, Logic oj Chance, chap. viii., sections 17\u00b723. t See p. 193.\n\f192 TI,e Calculu8 of Probabilitics.\nm+n white balls would he drawn in N trials. Then the probability\nthat the observed event has resulted from some possibility above u, is\nexpressed by,; cp (x) xf(x), summed from 111 to },~ di1)ided lnJ the same\nexpression summed from 0 to },-.\nThis, as I understand, is the method pUJ\u00b7sued by Laplace in investi-\ngating the probability that the difference in the ratio of male to femalo\nbirths, as observed in Paris and in London (respectively H and I~), is\ndue to a real difference between the two localities. (\" Theor. Analytique\ndes Prob.,\" Book II., Art. 29); mutatis mutandis, that is, it being\nobserved first that Laplace's m is derived only from a finite set of\nobservations (say at London), whereas ours is del\u00b7ived deductively from\nan infinite set of observations, the experience of games of chance and\neven more* widely diffused experiences, from the beginning of time.\nAnd secondly, in comparing our formula with Laplace's method, we\nmust allow for his characteristic neglect of it priori probabilities.\nLaplace's reasoning is abridged by Mr. Todhunter, in his \"HistoI\u00b7Y of\nProbabilities,\" Arts. 902, 1018. Laplace is followed by Demorgan, in\nthe treatise on Probabilities published in the \"Encyclopied. Metrop.,\"\nat section 14:>, which the author entitles, \"Determination of the\nPI\u00b7esumption that Increased Frequency of an vent Ehas a Particular\nCause.\" The same method is employed hy Cournot in his masterly\ndiscussion of it posteriori Prohabilities (in the eighth chapter of\n\"Exposition de 10. Theorie des Chances\"). The reader who may wish to\nsee the identical (or as neal\u00b7ly as possible the same) problem which we\nhave in hand, discussed 1Iy a first-rate authOl\u00b7ity, is referred to Cournot,\nsection 99; whel\u00b7e it is to be observed that our case is that notp.<l by\nCournot when his ml (our N) is \"tres petit par rapport a. m\" (his 11\u00a3\ncorresponding to our infinite set of observations afforded by games of\nchance, &c.).\nBut however well estlthlished the preceding formula as an organon\nof statistics (b), the following schema, sa,,\u00b7ouring more of Ber-\nnouilli than of Bayes, is perhaps more 11Ppropriate to the particular\nproblem ill hanel. Let a be the it pri01\"'i probability that chance alone\nshould have been the regime under which the observed event occurred.\nLet p be the oqjective prohability that, clmnce being the regime, a\ndeviation from u in the direction of success at least as great as v should\noccur. Let (3 be the apriori probability that there should have been\nsome additional agency. Let')' be the (not in general objective) pro-\nbahility that, such additional agency existing, the observed e,,-ent should\noccur. Then the required a l)osteriori probability in favour of the\nadditional agency is Q~ ; where a=I-{3.\nI-'')I+ap\n* I have dwelt upon this sort of experience elsewhere: Mind, April, 1884.\nHerlllathcna, 1884.\n\fThe Oalculu8 fit' p,.oba6ilitiea. 193\nSuch, as I understand, is the method pursued by Laplace in his\ninvestigation (\"Theor.Analyt.,\" Book II.,Art. 25) whether the difference\nbetween barometrical observation at different hours of the day is due to\ncause or chance alone. Laplace is followed by Demorgan in his section\n139 entitled \"On the Question whether Observed Discrepancies are\nConsequences of a General Law, or Accidental Fluctuations.\" Such also\nis the method employed by Herschel (Essay on Quetelet) in determining\nthe probability that the difference between the numbers of male and\nfemale births is not accidental, and that the connection between the\nbinary stars is physical.\nIt may be objected, perhaps, to both these methods that they do not\nutilise all our knowledge; for that, as regards the second method, we\nare given the particular deviation from u, namely, 11, while we take\naccount only of the fact that the deviation belongs to the class extending\nfrom 11 to I-u. In the first method, indeed, we take our stand upon\nthe particular event, the deviation of exactly 11. But, on the other\nhand, we do not take account of our exact knowledge of u. The answer\nwould have been the same if we had been given only that this fraction\nwas somewhere between zero and what we now know to be its exact value.\nThis difficulty may be partially cleared up by the following illustra-\ntion (borrowed from Laplace). Suppose we know that there are a.\nthousand tickets in a certain lottery, whereof a hundred are red and the\nrest white, and that each has a certain number inscribed. If a red ball\nis drawn, though it has a particular number inscribed on it, yet we\ncannot utilise that knowledge in the absence of any knowledge whether\nthe agency, other than chance, would prefer one number to another.\nWe may have to put down the (objective) probability that chance alone\nexisting the red ball would have been drawn as itT' But now let it be\nknown that the particular number was prophesied, or is, and might have\nbeen found out to be, the prize-bearing ticket; then, indeed, we obtain a\nhoM whereby to bring to bear our knowledge of the differelltial chan.e,\nthat is Ithrn. In our problem, with reference, for example, to the second\nmethod above exhibited, we can assign certainly the differential pro-\nbability that the exact deviation 11 should result from chance alone.\nBut we cannot similarly differentiate our vague knowledge about the\nother agency. We may assign, certainly, the form of such an argument,\nbut when we come to our second operation we shall find that it is an\nempty form. This foredoomed form might be fJ'y~+ apt where, corre-\nsponding to the notation above employed, pI is the (yery small) pro-\nbability that the particular deviation 11 should occur under the regime of\nchance; yl, is the probability (pruullrwhly 0\/ the lIame order 0\/magnitude)\nthat, an additional agency existing, the exact deviation 11 should have\noccurred; a and fj are as before.\no\nDigitized by Google\n\f194 TI.e Oalculu8 of Probabilities.\nThe only interpretation which I can put on Professor Lodge's reasoll-\ning upon the problem now in hand (in the Proceedings of the S.P.R.,\nPart VII.), is that it is an attempt in some way to evade the difficulty\nhere noticed. But the originality of his reasoning renders it difficult\nfor the book-taught student to understand it.\n(2) Still under the heading de\\'oted to the first operation, we\ncome now to our seeond problem. It seems a sufficient (though\nfor reasons already intimated it is an imperfect) statement to posit the\nsame formula I\\S in the second method of the preceding problem\n( viz., ....!!:L..), substituting for the p of that formula the continued\n\/fy+ap\nproduct p 1\/ p\", &c., expressing the probability that under the regime of\nchance all the observed results m+tt, m+n', &c., would have diverged in\nthe same direction from the most probable result, m by n n', &c.\n(Had the datum been that the observed results had diverged on one\nside or the other, it would have been proper to take each p as express-\ning that degree of divergence on one side or tlte otlter.) The import\nof \" is analogously modified.\nIt will be noticed that this formula differs from that offered by\n}Ir. Gurney in Part VII. of these Proceedings. But,!l.S above\nintimated, it docs not follow that, because two formulre are different,\nboth cannot be right. They may be equally serviceable and equally\nimperfect. In the present case Mr. Gumey's formula appears to be\nquite as accurate !l.S ours,* but not, !l.S will presently be pointed out,\nsubstantially more serviceable.\n(3) The third problem may he reduced to the second (or first), by\ngrouping the given series so as to constitute a set, in all of which the\nsuccesses are in excess. This method, doubtless, does not utilise all our\ninformation. But it is convenient; and it might be difficult to frame\na more useful formula without special knowledge of the subject-matter.\nMuch would turn upon the probability that the agency other than\nchance, if existing, would have been attended by the observed chequered\nresult. If it were known or suspected to he a fitful agency, not much\npresumption against it would 1)e created by defective set\u00b7ies.\nII. For the methods appropriate to the second operation the reader\nis referred to the paper on a priori probabiliti.es in the PltilosopMcal\nMagazine, September, 1884, and to the authorities therein cited. It is\npointed out in the article referred to that an accurate knowledge of the\nvalues under consideration can often be dispensed with, and that an\ninaccurate knowledge is often derivable from experience; partly by a\ncopious simple induction, and partly hy inference f,\u00b7om the success which\nhas attended the hypothetical values which have been usually assigned\n\u2022 Poisl!On (RC8crcltC8, Art. 64) indicates the difference between these two\nprocedures, without expressing a preference.\nDigitized by Google\n\fThe Oll\/CII\/U8 (:I Probabilities. 195\nto these quantities. To apply these principles to the problems in hand.\n(1) For the first problem and the (a) first method the a priori facility\nfunction cp (x) can, to a large extent, be ignored, when N is large; as\nCoumot has well exhibited in the eighth chapter of the work already\nreferred to. I would further contend that there is some empirical\nground for treating the function as a constant (as is usual in inverse\nreasoning founded on Bayes' theorem and the cognate theory of errors\nof observation). Accordingly the sought ap08teriori probability reduces\nto the objective probability :s f (a:) between proper limits, divided by\nthe sanle, summed between extreme limits.\nAs to the second fomlula offered above under (b) R.~ for addi-\n..,+ap\ntional agency, it is consonant, I submit, to experience to put ! both\nfor 4 and fJ. To put that same value for y, appears, while not contradicted\nby, yet less agt'eeable to, experience. In fact, we know of some kinds\nof agencies which, if they exist, are extremely likely to make themselves\nfelt (e.g., imposture). Accordingly Mill, discussing a similar problem\n(\" Logic,\" Book III., chap. xviii., section 6), says: \"The law of\nnature, if real, would certainly produce the series of coincidences.\"\nAnd so Poisson, in a passage above referred to, supposes '.. une cause\ncapable de Ie [the observed event] produire necessairement.\" But\nit really is not very important what particular value we assign to\none of these apriori constants, provided that we are careful not to build\nupon any particularity which does not rest upon our rough though solid\nground of experience. In the present case all that we really know\nabout y is that it is substantial, not in general indefinitely small. But\nwe must not build any conclusion on itsfractional charaeter, seeing that\nit may very well be in the neighbourhood of unity. The importance of\nthis remark will appear when we come to the second problem. In the\npresent case, since neither 4 nor fJ nor y is very small, if p is very\nsmall the above written expression for the a 1)08teMaM probability in\nfavour of additional agency reduces by Taylor's theorem to I--=--- ;yxp.\nThus the objective probability p may be taken as a rough measure of\nthe sought a posteriori probability in favour of mere chance. This\nreasoning is authorised by Donkin and even by Boole, who is so\nmightily scrupulous ahout the undetermined constants of probabilities\n(see the authorities cited in the paper on a priari Probabilities in\nPhilo8opitical Magazine). The conclusion is agreeable to the summary\npractice of Laplace and Herschel. They have not thought it worth\nwhile to construct a scaffolding of unknown constants which would\nhave to be taken down again.\nThe third formula u ~l 1 attempts to utilise our knowledge of\n,..Y+4P\nthe particular deviation n, and the particular, most probable value from\no 2\nDigitized by Google\n\f196 The Oalculw of Probabilities.\nwhich it is a deviation, viz., m, pt, is the objective probability that this\nparticular deviation should occur in the regim,tJ of chance. pi we knowi\nbut what is yl 1 It is a magnitude prel1U;mably of tl1.6 BalM order as pl.\nAccordingly the above expression is thoroughly indeterminate. It will\nbe remembered that this formula is here criticised not as being identical\nwith the rule given by Professor Lodge, but as that tc. which the\nprinciple he employs might seem to lead. His l:ule, however obtained,\nis so far a good rule as (in common with an indefinite number of rules\nthat might be constructed) it always varia in tl1.6 saIM direction as the\nrule sanctioned by Laplace, Demorgan, Herschel, and the other masters\nof the science of probabilities. What is here termed 1) always increases\nwith the increase, and decreases with the decrease of Professor\nLodge's ~ (Proceedings, Part VII., p. 261, top). But 'it happens that\nq .\nProfessor Lodge's rule does less than justice to the argument in favour\nof agency other than chance.\n(2) We come now to the second problem, concerning which, under\nthe heading of the second operation, there need hardly be added\nanything. As under (1) we see (or will see presently) that p is the\neffective measure of the probability-the a posteriori probability--of\nmere chance, so under (2) the real grip of proof consists in pxp'x, &c.\nIf we replace ! which Mr. Gurney assigns as \"the probability of\nobtaining at least that degree of success-if chance +6\" act, by\nour y, his \"final value\" will become\n:.e -;-;c--:----\nx+( ~rXMs'''qn(l' x)\nSo far as there is reason to think (with Mill) that \"the law of nature,\nif real, would certainly produce the series of coincidences,\" Mr. Gurney\nseeIns to underrate the probability in favour of a cause other than chance,\nby assigning to ! a value (2) which, being raised to the nth power,\nunduly swells t1!denominator. If eachp or the average-the geometric\nmean--of the p'. were !, Mr. Gunley's fonnula would be void of any\nprobative content. But this is contrary to common sense. It is\ncontrary to this elementary principle of statistics: that, if an event may\nindifferently happen one way or another, be either p11\" or \"linus, and\nit repeatedly happens one way, then there must be a cause other\nthan chance for that repetition.* According to this new rule it is no\n\u2022 It is evidently owing to a mere lapsua plllflla: on the part of Mr. Gurney\nthat this consequence can be fastened upon him. For at p. 256 he implies the\nprinciple for which we are here contending. It may be as well to repeat that\nmy contention is not against Mr. Gurney's reasoning, which is excellent: but\n.pmst his &88lU1lptioQ of the premiss: that, \"if chance +'\"act, the pl'obability\nDigitized by Google\n\fTi,e Oalctll148 of Probabilities. 197\nargument in favour of causation * that all the planets move in the same\ndirection. It would be no proof of asymmetry in a coin that it ever so\noften turned up in succession heads. Doubtless you never could prove\nby repeated throws the existence of such a peculiar kind of asymmetry,\nsuch a wabbling load, that it would be (for each throw) \"as likely to\nbring the degree of success up to that point\" which is observed, that is\nto give heads, as\" not to do 80,\" that is to give tails. Pure chance\nwould always be as probable an hypothesis as that. In a word, Mr.\nGurney's solution underrates the evidence in the case where the\ndivergence from the most probable value is small or not known to be\nlarge, but is repeatedly in the same direction. In the general case\nwhere p is very small his solution does not differ substantially from\nours. His 2p is as good as our !p, may be regarded as of the same\n. y\norder of magrutude.\nIt should be observed that this criticism relates to the second, not\nthe first operation, as performed by Mr. Gurney. His scaffolding is\nmore elaborate, if not more serviceable, than ours. But in the building\nhe uses some materials which, though solid enough for ordinary purposes,\nyet will not bear certain strains. It is to be observed, also, that\nMr. Gurney's \"at least that degree of success\" has here Loon inter-\npreted as at least that degree of divergence from the most probable\npoint in an assigned, say tlt.e plus, direction. If we interpret (violently)\nhis q as probability of obtaining that degree of divergence in eitlter\ndirection, we shall be involved in still greater difficulties.\n(3) As to our third problem, it has been already resolved into the\nother two.\nIII. We come now to the third, the calculative portion of our work.\n(1) As an example of the application of first principles without the\nintervention of approximative fonnulre, let us take the experiment\ncited by Mr. Gurney at p. 251 of Part VII. of these Pro(\"('edings,\nwhere the \"name thought of\" was DOREMOND, and the \"letters\nof a certain degree of success being attained may be put down &I! ,. Theground\nof my contention is that we are;71ot :entirely ignorant of the probability in\nquestion. For we have the datum that it is greater than the probability that\nchance alone would attain the certain degree of SUllce88. }'or it is absurd to\nsuppose that chance + 0. favouring cause is less likely to obtain a certain\ndegree of sueee88 than chance alone.

It is clear that, when p is in the neighbourhood of 6, Mr. Gurney's\nassumption sacrifices much of the cumulative force which properly belongs to P.\n\u2022 Of. Laplace, E88Ui PhilosophilJlI6.\nDigitized by Goo\n\f198 TIle Oalculu8 ql Probabilitie8.\nproduced\" were EPJYEIOD. Here, out of eight guesses, there are\nfour successes; if success consist in guessing either the very letter\nthought of, or either of its nearest alphabetical neighbours, in short any\none of an assigned consecuth'e triplet. The probability that a letter\ntaken at randolll should fall within any assigned triplet is i. Accord-\ningly (on the supposition that chance is the only agency), the\nprobabilities of obtaining in the course of eight trials no successes, one\nsuccess, two successes, &c., are given by the firat, second, third, &c.,\nterms respectively of the binomial (i+i)8. The probability of obtaining\nat least four successes is equal to the sum of the fifth, and re~aining\nterms; that is\nor '011. The probability, then, in favour of an agency other than\nchance is about '99.\nWhen larger numbers are involved, approxima.tive formulre become\nnecessary. According to principles familiar to those who have Ijtudied\nthe calculus of probabilities, the o~jective probability involved in either\nformula \u00ab(I) or (b) is approximately*\ni [1-2 IT e-t2dt] , 1DII~,.e T=r 1'~:-:N_\"'7\n',\/ 0 2\" (1-11)\nThe approximation requires that n~ should not exceed X, and that .N\nshould be large. This then, according to the reasoning employed in our\nsecond part, is the measure of the a posteriori probability in favour of\nchance alone.\nFor example, in the first instance given by Mr. Gurney, at p. 241 of\nthe December number of this Jourrw,l, N is 2927, u is 1, and 'V is\n'l~h. As the condition required for the validity of the approximation\nis just or very nearly fulfilled, the answer is, if I do the sum correctly,\nabout '93 as the probability of an agency other than chance; no \\'ery\ncrushing probability, as statistical evidence goes. In Mr. Gurney's\nnext insta.nce, N is 1833, u still t, v is T~iilJ. Whence in favour of\nadditional agency a very respectable probability, '997.\n(2) and (3). As an illustration of the second problem (including the\nOnlitting a certain tenn outside the sign of integration (see Todhunter,\n!lee. 997) as here practically, if not in general theoretically, neglectible.

The argument becomes a fortiori.\nDigitized by Google\n\fTIle Oulculu8 0\/ Prohahilitie8. 199\nthird), let us suppose that the series just instanced breaks up into four\nseries, each presenting an excess of successes, with about the same v-\nan arrangement to which the experiments of M.
