He later became a research associate of the Natural History Museum, London, and a scientific fellow of the Zoological Society of London. He is much published in the fields of zoology and psychical research. Two amphibian genera&nbsp;have been named after him (Poyntonia and Poyntonophrynus), along with four amphibian species.

He matriculated at Michaelhouse School, Natal, in 1948 and subsequently majored in botany and zoology at the University of Natal. After gaining a master\u2019s degree in zoology he studied music at the University of Cape Town where he won a prize for composition. He returned to zoology&nbsp;as a lecturer&nbsp;at the University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, having gained&nbsp;a PhD&nbsp;on the amphibian fauna of southern Africa.&nbsp; Subsequently he was invited to the University of the Witwatersrand as a senior lecturer in zoology. After three years he resigned to take up research in parapsychology.\n\nIn 1971, a lecturing appointment at the University of Natal, Durban, permitted continuation of this work while teaching medical biology. He also resumed taxonomic and zoogeographical research in the Department of Biological Sciences of Natal University, where he taught biogeography, other environmental subjects, and philosophy of science. The position of associate professor was awarded in 1981, later an&nbsp;ad hominem professorship in 1987. He married a colleague in the department, Margaret Wyllys Black, in 1980.1\n\nAt the end of 1991 he retired from the University of Natal as an emeritus professor of biology and moved to London in 1992. He received the Order of Meritorious Service from the South African State President in 1992.\n\nHe published extensively in the fields of biology and zoology, and&nbsp;is recognized internationally as a leading African zoologist.2&nbsp;A selection of his publications includes articles in Nature,3 The South African Journal of Science,4 The African Journal of Herpetology,5 Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa6 and The Annals of the Natal Museum.7  Psychical Research\n\nPoynton\u2019s interest in psi started with encounters with dowsing for water which is widely practised in South Africa.&nbsp;He concluded from his informal researches that information gained by dowsing could not have been accessed by physical or geological means, and that details of depth of available water and yield could come only through non-physical or extrasensory perception.\n\nDowsing&nbsp;set him thinking about the possibility of the mind operating&nbsp;independently of matter. This in turn led to an interest in what he believed to be outstanding evidence from the literature on out-of-body experiences (OBE). As a result of an invitation to a senior lectureship in the department of zoology, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (1965), he joined the South African Society for Psychical Research,&nbsp;centred at Wits,&nbsp;where he met Michael Whiteman when he was invited to give lectures. He was impressed that Whiteman\u2019s ontology, \u2018based on the potentiality\/actualization thinking of Heisenberg and others, provided the basis for understanding OBE, in that a clear distinction was made between the physical domain and non-physical domains; OBE is not experience in a physical world but some non-physical world, which might resemble the physical but is ontologically different from it.\u20198\n\nFull-time research in parapsychology followed his resignation from the university in 1968, and a grant from the Parapsychology Foundation of New York enabled him to carry out research among the Zulu people of Natal.\n\nWhen back at the University of Natal, Poynton in 1987 formed&nbsp;the Natal Branch of the South African Society for Psychical Research, combining this activity with an interest in Buddhist philosophy and practice. He also gave winter school courses in parapsychology on the Durban and Pietermaritzburg campuses of the university. He served on the council of the South African Society for Psychical Research, and on moving to London joined the council of the Society for Psychical Research, serving as honorary secretary from 1997 to 2004, then as president until 2007, and again between 2015 and 2018.\n\nWhiteman\u2019s treatment of non-physical states and out-of-body experiences led Poynton to a study of Emanuel Swedenborg, known for his detailed descriptions of other-world states. Whiteman\u2019s experiences match those of Swedenborg in major respects, and Swedenborg\u2019s accounts seem more easily comprehended following Whiteman\u2019s analysis of non-physical states. Poynton\u2019s chapter article (see below) and his Psi Encyclopedia entry on Swedenborg aimed to link Swedenborg\u2019s work with psi research.  Views on Life\n\nPoynton describes his general views as follows:   \n\nI have an underlying view of life that one\u2019s existence on earth is for some purpose, which the individual has to try to discover, and to fulfil to the best of his\/her ability. Cultivating an individual\u2019s interests helps to clarify and serve one\u2019s life-purpose. My life-long interest has been in African wildlife and in classical music, added to later by an interest in psychical phenomena and in mysticism. A critical view of the dogmatic materialism promoted both by current science and by current philosophy culminated in an interest in the philosophy of science. To cultivate and serve this wide range of interests became the purpose I see in my life.9\n\nPoynton often speaks of his admiration for his long-standing friend Michael Whiteman (1906-2007) and his mystical approach to life; he devoted a book to Whiteman\u2019s outstanding contributions to psi, physics, philosophy and religion,10 as well as several articles (see Michael Whiteman in Psi Encyclopedia). Whiteman\u2019s extensive diaries came into Poynton\u2019s possession following his death; these are now in the SPR archives in Cambridge University Library.11\n\nPoynton has published four novels (and one in press),&nbsp;which take issue with the dominating materialist culture of contemporary society.  Works\n\nThis list includes a selection of his many publications within the field of psychical research. In addition to the items below, Poynton published regular columns in the Paranormal Review between 2004-2007 and 2015-2018 in his capacity as SPR president.
