It must be remembered that our primary aim is to\nbe a Scientific Society, to conduct our researches and to\nrecord our results in an accurate and scientific manner, so\nas to set an example of careful work in regions where it has\nbeen the exception rather than the rule, and to be a trust\nworthy guide to the generation of workers who shall follow.\nTo be scientific does not mean to be infallible, but it means\nbeing clear and honest, and as exact as we know how to be.\nIn difficult investigations pioneers have always made some\nmistakes, they have no immediate criterion or infallible\ntouchstone to distinguish the more true from the less true, but\nif they record their results with anxious care and scrupulous\nhonesty and painstaking precision, their mistakes are only less\nvaluable to the next generation than their partially true\ngeneralisations ; and sometimes it turns out, after a century or\nA\n\f2 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nso, that mistakes made by early pioneers were no such thorough\nerrors as had been thought, that they had an element of\ntruth in them all the time, as if discoverers were endowed\nwith a kind of prophetic insight whereby they dimly glimpsed\ntheories and truths which it would take several generations\nof workers to disencumber and bring clearly to light.\nSuppose, however, that their errors were real ones, the\nrecord of their work is just as important to future navigators\nas it is to have the rocks and shoals of a channel mapped\nout and buoyed. It is work which must be done. The\ngreat ship passing straight to its destination is enabled to\nattain this directness and speed by the combined labours of\na multitude of workers, some obscure and forgotten, some\ndistinguished and remembered, but none of whom were able\nto realise the stately passage of the great ship through the\nchannels marked out for it, and by aid of mechanism which\nthey had taken a part in designing or constructing. So it is\nwith every great erection ; and the Forth Bridge stands upon\npiers sunk below the water-mark by the painful and long\ncontinued labours of Italian workmen in \"caissons\" full of com\npressed and heated air.\nThe study of specifically Natural knowledge was fostered\nand promoted by the recognition in the reign of Charles II.\nof a body of enthusiasts who, during the disturbed but hopeful\nera of the Commonwealth, had met together to discuss problems\nof scientific interest ; and to-day the Royal Society is among\nthe dignified institutions of our land, taking all branches of\nNatural Philosophy and Natural History\u2014the Physical Sciences\nand the Biological Sciences\u2014under its wing.\nUs it does not recognise, but then neither does it recognise\nMental and Moral Philosophy, or Ethics, or Psychology, or\nHistory, or any part of a great region of knowledge which has\nhitherto been regarded as outside the pale of the Natural\nSciences.\nIt is for us to introduce our subjects within that pale, if it\nturns out that there they properly belong ; and if not, it is for\nus to do pioneer work and begin the establishment of another\nSociety or group of Societies for recognition and promotion of\nwork in the mental, the psychological, the psychical direction,\nuntil the day for unification shall arrive.\n\fXLvi.] 3\nPresidential Address.\nHalf knowledge sees divisions and emphasises barriers,\ndelights in classification into genera and species, affixes labels,\nand studies things in groups. And all this work is of the\nutmost practical value and is essentially necessary. That the\nday will come when barriers shall be broken down, when\nspecies shall be found to shade off into one another, when\ncontinuity and not classification shall be the dominant feature,\nmay be anticipated by all, but we have no power of hastening\nthe day except by taking our place in the workshop and\ndoing our assigned quota ; still less have we any advantage in\npretending that the day of unification has arrived while as\nyet its dawn is still in the future.\nReturning to my thesis I say our primary aim is to be a\nscientific Society, doing pioneering and foundation work in a\nnew and not yet incorporated tract on which future genera\ntions may build, and making as few mistakes as we can\nreasonably contrive by the exercise of great care.\nWe are not a literary society, though we have had men of\nletters among our guides and leaders ; and we are not a\nreligious society, though some of our members take an\ninterest in our subject because it seems to them to have a\nbearing on their religious convictions or hopes. I will say\na few words on both these points. First, our relations to\nliterature.\nThe name of Francis Bacon is a household word in the\nhistory of English scientific ideas. I do not mean in the recent,\nand as it seems to me comic, aspect, that he wrote everything\nthat was written in the Elizabethan era (a matter to which I\nwish to make no reference one way or the other, for it is\ncompletely off my path), but before that hare was started his\nname was weighty and familiar in the history of English\nscientific ideas. It is instructive to ask why. Was he a man\nof Science ? No. Did he make discoveries ? No. Do scien\ntific men trace back their ancestry to him ? No. To Isaac\nNewton they trace it back, to Gilbert, to Roger Bacon,\nspeaking for those in England ; but of Francis Bacon they\nknow next to nothing. Outside England all the world traces\nits scientific ancestry to Newton, to Descartes, to Galileo, to\nKepler ; but of Francis Bacon scientific men outside England\nhave scarcely heard, save as a man of letters. Yet the pro\n\f4 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\ngress of science owes much to him. All unconsciously scientific\nmen owe to him a great debt. Why ?\nBecause he perceived afar off the oncoming of the scientific\nwave, and because he was able, in language to which men would\nlisten, to herald and welcome its advance.\nScientifically he was an amateur ; but he was an enthusiast\nwho with splendid eloquence, with the fire of genius, and with\ngreat forensic skill, was able to impress his generation, and not\nhis own generation alone, with some idea of the dignity and\ntrue place of science, and to make it possible for the early\npioneers of the Royal Society to pursue their labours unim\npeded by persecution and to gain some sort of recognition even\nfrom general and aristocratic Society.\nFor remember that the term \" science \" was not always\nrespectable. To early ears it sounded almost as the term\nwitchcraft or magic sounded, it was a thing from which to\nwarn young people ; it led to atheism and to many other\nabominations. It was an unholy prying into the secrets of\nNature which were meant to be hid from our eyes, it was\na thing against which the Church resolutely set its face, a\nthing for which it was ready if need were to torture or to burn\nthose unlucky men of scientific genius who were born before\ntheir time. I mean no one Church in particular : I mean\nthe religious world generally. Science was a thing allied to\nheresy, a thing to hold aloof from, to shudder at, and to\nattribute to the devil. All which treatment that great and\neminent pioneer, Roger Bacon, experienced at our beloved\nUniversity of Oxford ; because the time was not yet ripe.\nHow came it that in the days of the Stuarts the atmosphere was\nso different from that prevalent in the days of the Plantagenets ?\nDoubtless the age of Elizabeth, the patriotism aroused by the\nArmada and by the great discoveries in geography, had had their\nvivifying effect ; and the same sort of originality of thought\nwhich did not scruple to arraign a king for high treason like\nwise ventured to set orthodoxy at defiance, and to experiment\nupon and investigate openly all manner of natural facts. But I\nwish to maintain, or at least to suggest, that the result was\nlargely due to the influence of the writings of Francis Bacon.\nHe had accustomed scholars and literary men to the possibili\nties and prerogatives of scientific enquiry, he had emphasised\n\fXLv1.] 5\nPresidential Address.\nthe importance and the dignity of experiment, and it is to his\nwritings that the rapid spread of scientific ideas, discovered\nas always by a few, became acceptable to and spread among\nthe many.\nDo not let us suppose, however, that the recognition of\nscience was immediate and universal. Dislike of it, and\nmistrust of the spread of scientific enquiry, persisted well\ninto the Victorian era, and is not wholly extinct to this\nday.\nI am not at the moment speaking of investigation into\naffairs of the mind\u2014that is unpopular and mistrusted still, and\nstill good people are found who will attribute anything un\nusual to the devil, and warn young people from it,\u2014but I refer\nto some slight trace of lingering prejudice against the orthodox\nsciences of Chemistry and Physics and Biology. They have\nachieved their foothold, they are regarded with respect, people\ndo not disdain to make money by means of them when the\nopportunity is forthcoming, but they are not really liked. They\nare only admitted to our Schools on sufferance, as an inferior\ngrade of study suited to the backward and the ignorant ;\nthey are not regarded with affection and enthusiasm, as revela\ntions of Divine working, to be reverently studied, nor as\nsubjects in which the youth of a nation may be wholesomely\nand solidly trained.\nVery well, still more is the time not quite ripe for our sub\nject ; pioneers must expect hard knocks, the mind of a people\ncan change only slowly ; and until the mind of a people is\nchanged, new truths born before their time must suffer the\nfate of other untimely births ; and the prophet who preaches\nthem must expect to be mistaken for a useless fanatic, of\nwhom every age has always had too many, and must be con\ntent to be literally or metaphorically put to death, as part of\nthe process of the regeneration of the world.\nThe dislike and mistrust and disbelief in the validity or\nlegitimacy of psychical enquiry is familiar. The dislike of\nthe Natural Sciences is almost defunct. It survives un\ndoubtedly ; they are not liked but they are tolerated : and I\nam bound to say that part of the surviving dislike is due not\nalone to heredity and imbibed ideas, but to the hasty and\nintolerant and exuberant and splay-footed attitude of some\n\f6 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nmen of science, who, knowing themselves to be reformers, feel\ning that they have a grain of seed-corn to plant and water,\ncannot be content to go about their business in a calm and\nconciliatory spirit, but must seek to hurry things on by a rough\nshod method of progression, which may indeed attain its ends,\nbut gives some pain in the process, and perhaps achieves results\nless admirable than those which might have been attained by\nthe exercise of a little patience, a little more perception of the\npoint of view of others, a little more imagination, a little more\nof that recognition of the insignificance of trifles and of the\ntransitory character of full-blown fashions which is called a\nsense of humour, a little more cultivation of the historic sense.\nIn a word a little more general education.\nI am digressing again. I was pointing out the importance\nof Francis Bacon as a man of letters in the history of the\ndevelopment of the national recognition of the natural sciences\nin England.\nHas it struck you, it has often struck me, that in the history\nof the psychical sciences we too have had a Bacon, and one\nnot long departed from us ? Is it possible that in the two\nvolumes, which to-day or to-morrow may be emerging from\nthe press, we have a book which posterity will regard as a\nNovum Orijanon ? History does not repeat itself, and I would\nnot draw the parallel too close. It may be that posterity will\nregard Myers as much more than that, as a philosophic pioneer\nwho has not only secured recognition for, but has himself\nformulated some of the philosophic unification of, a mass of\nobscure mental and barely recognised human faculty, and has\nthrown a light on the meaning of personality which may sur\nvive the test of time. It may be so, but that is for no one\nliving to say. Posterity alone, by aid of the experience and\nfurther knowledge which time brings, is able to make a\njudgment of real value on such a topic as that.\nMeanwhile it is for us to see that time does bring this greater\nknowledge and experience. For time alow: is impotent. Mil\nlions of years passed on this planet, during which the amount\nof knowledge acquired was small or nil. Up to the sixteenth\ncentury, even, scientific progress was at the least slow. Becently\nit has been rapid\u2014none too rapid, but rapid. The rate of\nadvance depends upon the activities and energies of each\n\fPresidential Address. 7\ngeneration and upon the organisation and machinery which it\nhas inherited from its immediate forebears.\nThe pioneers who created the S.P.R. have left it in trust\nwith us to hand it on to future generations an efficient and\npowerful machine for the spread of scientific truth, and for the\nadvancement of scientific knowledge in a direction overgrown\nwith thickets of popular superstition, intermixed with sandy\nand barren areas of resolute incredulity. We have to steer\nour narrow way between the Scylla of stony minds with no\nopening in our direction, and the Charybdis of easy and\nomnivorous acceptance of every straw and waif whether of\ntruth or falsehood that may course with the currents of popular\nsuperstition.\nRealising this to be our duty, and perceiving that we have\na long period of danger and difficulty before us, it has become\nevident to persons of clear vision that the Society must be\nestablished on a sound and permanent basis, and must endeavour\nto initiate an attitude of regarding the psychical sciences as\naffording the same sort of scope to a career, the same sort of\nopportunities of earning a livelihood, as do the longer recognised\nsciences,\u2014those which are more specifically denominated\n\" natural,\" because of the way they fit into our idea of the\nscheme of nature as by us at present recognised, or at any\nrate because they deal with facts to which we have gradually\ngrown accustomed.\nAny young man who wishes to make money should be\nwarned off the pursuit of pure science at the outset. People\nwho enter the field with that object in view will do neither\nthemselves nor science any good. A certain amount of enthu\nsiasm and pioneering proclivity is essential, but fortunately that\nhas never yet been wanting in our race ; witness the hardships\nwillingly entered upon, and the risks run, in Arctic or Antarctic\nexploration, for nothing more than a living wage. A living\nwage is however to many a necessity. It has always been\nrecognised that those who labour at the altar should live by\nthe altar ; and a minimum of provision for bread and homely\nneeds ought to be at the disposal of a Society like this where\nwith to enable a person of ability and enthusiasm to undertake\nthe prosecution of our researches in a definite and continuous\nand so to speak professional manner. Hitherto we have\n\f8 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\ndepended on the spontaneous and somewhat spasmodic work\nof amateurs, often of wealthy amateurs, before whose\nminds such questions as salary never even momentarily\npass. We shall always have need of services such as\ntheirs. In the more orthodox sciences, in Physics for instance,\nit has been notorious that throughout last century the\nbest work has often been done by people who having the\nmeans of living otherwise secured to them were able to\ndevote their time, and often considerable means too, to the\nprosecution of research. There has been no rule either way.\nSome of the leaders have been paid a small salary, like Faraday :\nothers have had independent means, like Joule. Always I\nsay we shall depend upon and be grateful for the spontaneous\nwork and help of people of means, but we must not depend\nsolely upon that, else will young people of genius be diverted\nby sheer force of circumstance into other channels, and our\nnascent science will lose the benefit of their powers and con\ntinuous work.\nI have had the pleasure of communicating, to the Annual\nGeneral Meeting of the Society this afternoon, the fact that a\nfew friends who desire to remain anonymous have started an\nendowment fund in order to achieve this object, in order to\nset the Society upon a sound financial basis, and in order to\nprovide the material means of attacking the problems which\nthe future may bring before us. Member A has given us \u00a3750,\nmember B \u00a3250, the Society has transferred \u00a31000 from\nthe legacy of Dr. Arthur Myers, and a trust deed has been\ndrawn up and approved by the Council, whereby the Society\naccepts these donations and others which we hope may be\nforthcoming,1 and determines to accumulate them until the\nsum of \u00a38000 at least has been reached, or until a certain\nspecified time elapses, whichever event happens first. Ab\nsoon as a minimum capital sum of \u00a38000 has been attained,\nit will be permissible to offer a Research Scholarship in\nPsychical Science, to which a holder irrespective of sex or\nnationality may be appointed for one year, and from year to\nyear as may seem good, his or her time to be devoted to the\nwork of psychical investigation.\nIf we had more means more might be done ; a uuich-\n1 A legacy of \u00a33805 has since been left to the Society by Mr. A. N. Aksakoff.\n\fXLv].] 9\nPresidential Address.\nneeded laboratory, with special appliances such as I fore\nshadowed some years ago, might be erected ; but this is to be\nthe beginning. This is not an appeal to people to increase\nor supplement their subscriptions, such as was recently issued,\nin order to meet our ordinary working expenses and enable\nus to employ an Organising Secretary and to take what I\nthink you will agree with me in calling improved offices.\nThe need for ordinary subscriptions and new members con\ntinues, and it should be clearly represented to all persons\ninterested in our work that we should welcome them if\nthey will join the Society, and that we apply no test save\nthe test of sympathy and sanity. But the movement I now\nreport has new and additional objects : it is the establishment\nof an endowment fund to place the Society on a sound\nand permanent basis and enable it before long to begin\nprosecuting its work with greater ardour, and especially with\ngreater regularity.\nWe cannot always depend on spontaneous cases alone.\nThey are most important and are often extremely valuable\ninstances of a spontaneous and purposeful exercise of the\nfaculty we are investigating, and it would be a great mistake\nto suppose that we have had enough of them. It is essential\nthat we be kept informed of recent well-attested cases, especially\nof apparitions at or near the time of death ; but we shall not\nmake progress in understanding the laws of the phenomena\nand in disentangling their deeper meaning if we confine our\nselves to observation alone. We must experiment, we must\nendeavour to produce and examine phenomena as it were in\na laboratory and submit them to minute investigation.\nFor instance there is the question of so-called spirit\nphotography, there are asserted levitations and apiiorts and\nphysical movements, none of which have been subjected to\nadequate scientific examination ; many such cases have been\nexamined and found fraudulent, and there is great difficulty\nin obtaining the phenomena under prescribed and crucial con\nditions ; but until these things have been submitted to long-\ncontinued scientific scrutiny they will make no undisputed\nimpression, they will be either improperly accepted or im\nproperly rejected, and will continue in that nebulous hazy\nregion, the region of popular superstition, from which it is the\n\f10 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nbusiness of this Society to rescue them : raising them on to\nthe dry land of science, or submerging them as impostures\nin the waters of oblivion. And I may say parenthetically\nthat we do not care one iota which alternative fate is in\nstore for them : we only want the truth.\nNow I know that some few of our members are impatient\nof such an investigation and decline to see any need for it.\nThey feel that if they have evidence enough to justify their\nown belief, further enquiry is superfluous.\nThese have not the scientific spirit, they do not under\nstand the meaning of \" law.\" A fact isolated and alone,\njoined by no link to the general body of knowledge, is almost\nvalueless. If what they believe is really a fact, they may\ndepend upon it that it has its place in the cosmic scheme,\na place which can be detected by human intelligence ; and\nits whole bearing and meaning can gradually be made out.\nA still smaller class of persons may of course take the\npurely selfish view that what they have already learnt is\nsufficient for them, and they will help us no further. To\nsuch I do not speak, except to point out to thein that\ntheir attitude is selfish. Real knowledge, like real wealth\nof any kind, cannot be wrapped up thus, it pines for re\nproduction, for increase : \" how am I straightened till it be\naccomplished \" ; the missionary spirit, in some form or other,\nis inseparably associated with all true and worthy know\nledge. Think of a man who, having made a discovery in\nAstronomy,\u2014seen a new planet, or worked out a new\nlaw,\u2014should keep it to himself and gloat over it in private.\nIt would be inhuman and detestable miserliness ; even in\na thing like that of no manifest importance to mankind.\nThe only excuse would be if he lived so much in advance\nof his time that, like Galileo with his newly invented and\napplied telescope, he received nothing but rebuffs and\npersecution for the publication of his discoveries. But even\nso, it is his business to brave this and tell out what\nhe knows ; still more is it his business so to act upon\nthe mind of his generation as to convert it gradually to the\ntruth, and lead his fellows to accept what now they reject.\nThose who believe themselves the repositories of any form\nof divine truth should realise their responsibility. They are\n\fXLvi.] 11\nPresidential Address.\nbound in honour to take such steps as may wisely cause\nits perception and recognition by the mass of mankind.\nThey are not bound to harangue the crowd from the nearest\nplatform : that might be the very way to retard progress\nand throw back the acceptance of their doctrine. The course\nto pursue may be much more indirect than that. The\nway may be hard and long, but to the possessor of worldly\nmeans it is far easier than to another. If the proper\nadministration of his means can conduce to the progress of\nscience, and to the acceptance by the mass of mankind of\nimportant and vivifying knowledge of which they are now\nignorant, then surely the path lies plain.\nThe inauguration of this endowment fund, of which I\nannounce a nucleus to-day, makes it possible and easy for\npersons without leisure, but with means and enlightenment,\nto assist their fellows by ensuring a continuation and ex\ntension of investigation into the more unconscious and less\nrecognised mental operations.\nBut still it will be asked, Why investigate further when\nwe are already convinced ? of telepathy for instance,\u2014it may\nbe said,\u2014you yourself are convinced of that. Why do you\nwant us to conduct experiments in that ? Hypnotism again :\nAn excellent paper was read a few weeks ago to the Society\non certain aspects of hypnotism ; but hypnotism is an accepted\nmedical fact. Why waste time in making further experiments\non its manner and its bearing ?\nAlas, here again the effect of the lack of scientific educa\ntion in the schools of England is painfully prominent. Effective\nknowledge concerning anything can only be the result of\nlong-continued investigation, and belief in the possibility of\na fact is only the very first step. Until there is some\nsort of tentative belief in the reasonable possibility of a\nfact there is no investigation,\u2014the scientific priest and Levite\nhave other business, and pass by on the other side. And\nsmall blame to them : they cannot stop to investigate every\nthing that may be lying by the roadside. If they had\nbeen sure that it was a fellow creature in legitimate dis\ntress they would have acted differently. Belief of a tentative\nkind will ensure investigation, not by all but by some of\nthe scientific travellers along the road ; but investigation is\n\f12 [PAKT\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nthe prelude to action, and action is a long process. Some\none must attend to the whole case and see it through.\nOthers, more pressed for time, may find it easier to sub\nscribe their two pence to an endowment fund, and so give\nindirect but valuable assistance.\nBut once more the question is reiterated, Why investigate\nthat of which we are sure ? Why seek to confirm that\nof which we already have conviction ? Why value well-\nevidenced narratives for instance of apparitions at times of\ndeath or catastrophe, when so many have already been\ncollected in Phantasms of the Living, and when careful\nscrutiny by Mrs. Sidgwick proved that they could not be\nthe result of chance coincidence ? 1 There is a quite definite\nanswer to this question, which I wish to commend to the\nconsideration of those who feel this difficulty or ask this sort of\nquestion.\nThe business of science is not belief but investigation.\nBelief is both the prelude to and the outcome of knowledge.\nIf a fact or a theory has had a prima facie case made out\nfor it, subsequent investigation is necessary to examine and\nextend it.\nThe object of investigation is the ascertainment of law,\nand to this process there is no end. What, for instance, is\nthe object of observing and recording earthquakes, and\narranging delicate instruments to detect the slightest indica\ntion of earth tremor ? Every one knows that earthquakes\nexist, there is no scepticism to overcome in their case ;\neven people who have never experienced them are quite\nready to believe in their occurrence. Investigation into earth\nquakes and the whole of the motile occurrences in the\nearth's crust, is not in the least for the purpose of con\nfirming faith, but solely for the better understanding of the\nconditions and nature of the phenomena ; in other words,\nfor the ascertainment of law.\nSo it is in every branch of science. At first among new\nphenomena careful observation of fact is necessary, as when\nTycho Brahe made measurements of the motion of the planets\nand accumulated a store of careful observations. Then came\n1 See the Report of Professor Kidgwick's Committee, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. x.\np. 394.\n\fXLVX] 13\nPresidential Address.\nthe era of hypothesis, and Kepler waded through guess after\nguess, testing them pertinaciously to see if any one of them\nwould fit all the facts : the result of his strenuous life-\nwork being the three great laws which for all time bear\nhis name. And then came the majestic deductive epoch of\nNewton, welding the whole into one comprehensive system ;\nsubsequently to be enriched and extended by the labours\nof Lagrange and Laplace ; after which the current of\nscientific enquiry was diverted for a time into other less\nadequately explored channels.\nFor not at all times is everything equally ripe for\nenquiry. There is a phase, or it may be a fashion, even in\nscience. I spoke of geographical exploration as the feature of\nElizabeth's time. Astronomical enquiry succeeded it. Optics\nand Chemistry were the dominating sciences of the early\npart of the nineteenth century, Heat and Geology of the\nmiddle, Electricity and Biology of the later portion. Not yet\nhas our branch of psychology had its phase of popularity ; nor\nam I anxious that it should be universally fashionable. It\nis a subject of special interest, and therefore perhaps of\nspecial danger. In that respect it is like other studies of\nthe operations of mind, like a scientific enumeration of the\nphenomena of religion for instance, like the study of any\nthing which in its early stages looks mysterious and\nincomprehensible. Training and some admixture of other\nstudies are necessary for its healthy investigation. The day\nwill come when the science will put off its foggy aspect,\nbewildering to the novice, and become easier for the less\nwell-balanced and more ordinarily-equipped explorer. At\npresent it is like a mountain shrouded in mist whose sides\noffer but little secure foothold, where climbing, though possible,\nis difficult and dangerous.\nAs a Society we exist to curb rash and inexperienced\nnovices, and to support trusted and experienced climbers by\nroping ourselves together so that we may advance safely\nand in unison, guarding ourselves from foolhardy enterprises, but\nfacing such legitimate difficulties as lie in our path, and\nresolved that, weather and uncontrollable circumstances per\nmitting, our exploration shall continue, and the truth, whatever\nit may be, be ascertained.\n\f14 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nThe assuring ourselves as to facts is one of our duties,\nand it is better to hesitate too long over a truth than to\nwelcome an error, for a false gleam may lead us far astray\nunless it is soon detected.\nAnother of our duties is the making and testing of hypo\ntheses, so as gradually to make a map of the district and\nbe able to explain it to future travellers. We have to\ncombine the labours of Tycho with those of Kepler, and\nthus prepare the way for a future Newton ; who has not\nyet appeared above the psychical horizon.\nHis advent must depend upon how far we of this and\nthe next few generations are faithful to our trust, how far\nwe work ourselves, and by our pecuniary means enable\nothers to work ; and I call upon those who are simul\ntaneously blessed with this world's goods and likewise inspired\nwith confidence in the truth and value of mental and\nspiritual knowledge, to bethink themselves whether, either in\ntheir lifetime or in their wills, they cannot contribute to\nthe world's progress in a beneficent way, so as to enable\nhumanity to rise to a greater height of aspiration and even\nof religion ; as they will if they are enabled to start with\na substantial foundation of solid scientific fact on which to\nerect their edifice of faith.\nIf it be said, but why should investigation be expensive ?\nI would ask you to look round and think what is expended\non the investigation of the orthodox sciences. Before Columbus'\nvoyage could be undertaken, the Courts of Europe had to be\nappealed to for funds. Before astronomical discoveries can be\nmade, large observatories and costly telescopes have to be\nprovided ; and not one only, but many, so that by collabora\ntion of observers in many parts of the world the truth may\nbe ascertained.\nLook at the expense of biological and ethnological explora\ntion to-day. Think of the highly equipped physical laboratories,\none of which is maintained at every College or University in\nthe civilised world. And of chemical laboratories,\u2014remember\nthat every large commercial chemical manufacturing firm in\nGermany maintains a band of trained and competent chemists,\nalways investigating, in the hope of a new compound or a\nnew process or some little profitable improvement.\n\fxlvi.] 15\nPresidential Address.\nMoney is not scarce, and if people realised the interest of\nscience to the human race it would be poured out far more\nlavishly than it is at present. Certain small special sums are\nnow provided for the investigation of disease. The origin of\nMalaria has been traced, and this disease has some chance of\nbeing exterminated, so that the tropical belt of the earth may\nbecome open to white habitation. Cancer is being pursued to its\nlair, without success so far; but funds for researches such as these\nare bound to be forthcoming. I read in the papers only this\nweek a magnificent donation for the purpose of investigating\ncancer, a large portion of a million, attributed to Mr. Rocke\nfeller, founder of Chicago University.\nThat is the scale on which to do things with effect. When\npractical benefits can be definitely foreseen, people feel justified\nin spending money even on Science ; though as a rule that\nand education are things on which they are specially economical.\nMunicipal extravagance in any such things as those is sternly\nchecked, though in other directions it is permitted.\nAnd why should not psychical investigation lead to practical\nresults ? Are we satisfied with our treatment of criminals ?\nAre we as civilised people content to grow a perennial\nclass of habitual criminals, and to keep them in check only\nby devices appropriate to savages ; hunting them, flogging\nthem, locking them up, exterminating them ? Any savage\nrace in the history of the world could do as much as that :\nand if they know no better they are bound to do it for their\nown protection. Society cannot let its malefactors run wild, any\nmore than it can release its lunatics. Till it understands these\nthings it must lock them up, but the sooner it understands\nthem the better ; an attempt at comprehension is being made by\ncriminologists in Italy, France,1 and elsewhere. Force is no remedy:\nintelligent treatment is. Who can doubt but that a study of\nobscure mental facts will lead to a theory of the habitual\ncriminal, to the tracing of his malady as surely as malaria has\nbeen traced to the mosquito ? And once we understand the evil\nthe remedy will follow. Already hypnotic treatment, or treat\nment by suggestion, occurs to one. The fact of imprisonment\nought to lend itself to brilliant attempts at reform. It is a\n1 E.g.

It ought to be a similar advantage to have\ncriminals herded together in gaols, and lunatics in asylums.\nIt is unwise and unscientific to leave prisoners merely to the\ndiscipline of warders and to the preaching of chaplains. That\nis not the way to attack a disease of the body politic. I\nhave no full-blown treatment to suggest, but I foresee that\nthere will be one in the future. Society will not be content\nalways to pursue these methods of barbarism ; the resources\nof civilisation are not really exhausted, though for centuries\nthey have appeared to be. The criminal demands careful\nstudy on the psychical side, and remedy or palliation will be\na direct outcome of one aspect of our researches. The influence\nof the unconscious or subliminal self, the power of suggestion,\nthe influence of one mind over another, the phenomena of\nso-called ' possession,' these are not academic or scientific facts\nalone : they have a deep practical bearing, and sooner or\nlater it must be put to the proof.\nOne of the things I want to impress upon all Members and\nAssociates and beg them to spread, wherever they have any\ninfluence, among persons who being supernormally gifted may\nexpect to experience facts and sensations worth recording, is\nthat too much care cannot be expended in getting the state\nments exact. Exact in every particular, especially as regards\nthe matter of time. In recording a vision or an audition or\nsome other impression corresponding to some event elsewhere,\nthere is a horrible tendency to try to coax the facts to fit\nsome half-fledged preconceived theory and to make the coinci\ndence in point of time exact.\nSuch distortions of truth are misleading and useless. What\nwe want to know is exactly how the things occurred, not how\nthe impressionist would have liked them to occur, or how he\nthinks they ought to have occurred. If people attach any\nimportance to their own predilection concerning events in\nthe Universe, they can set them forth in a footnote for the\nguidance of any one who hereafter may think of starting a\nUniverse on his own account : but such speculations are of\nno interest to us who wish to study and understand the\n\fXLvi.] 11\nPresidential Address.\nUniverse as it is. If the event preceded the impression, by\nall means let us know it, and perhaps some one may be able\nto detect some meaning in the time-interval, when a great\nnumber of similar instances are compared hereafter. If the\nimpression preceded the event, by all means let us know that\ntoo, and never let the observation be suppressed from a\nridiculous idea that such anticipation is impossible. Nor let\nus exclude attested physical phenomena from a historical\nrecord, on any similar ground of impossibility. We want to\nlearn what is possible, not to have our minds made up before\nhand and distort or blink the facts to suit.\nIf the correspondence in time is exact, then let future\nstudents be able to ascertain that also from the record ; but\nlet not the recorder make any remark about \" allowing for\ndifference of longitude \" or anything of that kind, unless\nindeed he is an astronomer or some one who thoroughly under\nstands all about \" time.\" Arithmetic of that sort can be left\nto those who subsequently disentangle and criticise the\nresults. The observer may of course amuse himself in that\nand other ways privately, but nothing of it should appear in\nthe record. That should be accurate and cold-blooded and\nprecise. Sentences indicating contemporary emotion, in so far\nas that is part of the facts to be recorded, are entirely in place ;\nbut ejaculations of subsequent emotion, speculation as to the\ncause, or moralisation as to the meaning, are out of place.\nIt may be said that these do no harm, and can easily be\nignored by a future student ; and that is so in one sense, but\ntheir atmosphere is rather apt to spoil the record, to put the\nrecorder into an unscientific frame of mind, and, even when\nthey have biassed him no whit, to suggest to a subsequent\nreader that they may have biassed him, and so discount\nunfairly the value of his record.\nWith respect to the important subject of possible pre\ndiction, on which our ideas as to the ultimate nature of\ntime will so largely depend, every precaution should be\ntaken to put far from us the temptation or the possibility\nof improving the original record after the fact to which it\nrefers has occurred, if it ever does occur ; and to remember\nthat though we have done nothing of the sort, and are in all\nrespects honest, and known to be honest and truthful, yet the\nB\n\f18 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\ncontrary may be surmised by posterity or by strangers or\nforeigners who did not know us ; and even our friends may\nfancy that we did more than we were aware of, in some\naccess of somnambulic or automatic trance. Automatic writers\nfor instance must be assumed open to this suspicion, unless\nthey take proper precautions and deposit copies of their\nwritings in some inaccessible and responsible custody ; because\nthe essence of their phenomena is that the hand writes what\nthey themselves are not aware of, and so it is an easy\nstep for cautious critics to maintain that it may also have\nwritten when they were not aware of it.\nThe establishment of cases of real prediction, not mere\ninference, is so vital and crucial a test of something not\nyet recognised by science that it is worth every effort to\nmake its evidence secure.\nAnother thing on which I should value experiments is\nthe detection of slight traces of telepathic power in quite\nnormal persons, in the average man for instance, or rather\nmore likely perhaps, in the average child. The power of\nreceiving telepathic impressions may be a rare faculty exist\ning only in a few individuals and in them fully developed ;\nbut it is equally possible, and, if one may say so, more likely,\nthat what we see in them is but an intensification of a power\nwhich exists in every one as a germ or nucleus. If such should\nbe the fact, it behoves us to know it ; and its recognition\nwould do more to spread a general belief in the fact of tele\npathy\u2014a belief by no means as yet universally or even\nwidely spread\u2014than almost anything else.\nThe method that has been suggested is to offer to a\npercipient the choice of one out of two things, and to see\nwhether in multitudes of events the predetermination of a\nbystander as to which shall be chosen, exerts any influence\nwhatever on the result. Many devices can be made for\ncarrying this out, but experiments of greater interest and\nnovelty will be made if the devices are left to individual\ningenuity and experience. Leisure, and patience, and system,\nand industry, are the requisites : and if I do not myself\npractise what I preach, in this and other particulars, it is\nbecause whatever I may lack of the others I am at present\nconspicuously lacking in the first of these essentials.\n\fXLvi.] 19\nPresidential Address.\nThere are many topics on which I might speak : one is\nthe recent advance in our knowledge of the nature of the\natom of matter, and the discovery of facts which one would\nthink must have some bearing,\u2014some to me at present quite\nunknown bearing,\u2014on the theory of what are called\nphysical phenomena ; but I am speaking on this subject\nin the summer at Oxford in the Romanes lecture,\u2014I\nmean the subject of the nature of matter, not its bearing\nupon our researches, for on the latter I have at present\nno useful ideas,\u2014so I will not mention it further here and\nnow, except to call the attention of all educated persons to\nthe intense interest of this most recent purely scientific subject.\nOn another topic I might say a few words, viz., on the\nambiguity clinging round the phrase \" action at a distance,\"\nin connection with telepathy. Physicists deny action at a\ndistance, at least most of them do. I do for one. At\nthe same time I admit telepathy. Therefore it is sup\nposed I necessarily assume that telepathy must be con\nducted by an etherial process analogous to the transmission\nof waves. That is however a non-sequitur. The phrase\n\" action at a distance \" is a technical one. It signifies that\nno physical force is exerted save through a medium. There\nmust either be a projectile from A to B, or a continuous\nmedium of some kind extending from A to B, if A exerts\nforce upon B, or otherwise influences it by a physical\nprocess.\nBut what about a psychical process ? There is no such\nword in physics ; the term is in that connection meaning\nless. A physicist can make no assertion on it one. way\nor the other. If A mesmerises B, or if A makes an\napparition of himself appear to B, or if A conveys a tele\npathic impression to B ; is a medium necessary then ? As\na physicist I do not know : these are not processes I\nunderstand. They may not be physical processes at all.\nTake it further : A thinks of B, or A prays to B, or\nA worships B ;\u2014is a medium necessary for these things ?\nAbsolute ignorance ! The question is probably meaningless\nand absurd. Spiritual and psychical events do not enter\ninto the scheme of Physics, and when a physicist denies\n\" action at a distance \" he is speaking of things he is\n\f20 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\ncompetent to deal with,\u2014of light and sound and electricity\nand magnetism and cohesion and gravitation. He is not,\nor should not be, denying anything psychical or spiritual at\nall. All the physical things, he asserts, necessitate a medium ;\nbut beyond that he is silent. If telepathy is an etherial\nprocess, as soon as it is proved to be an etherial process,\nit will come into the realm of physics ; but till then it\nstays outside.\nThere are rash speculators who presume to say that\nspiritual and psychical and physical are all one. To me\nit seems that the instinct for simplification has run away\nwith them, that they are trespassing out of bounds and\npreaching what they do not know, eking out a precarious\nignorance with cheap dogmatism.\nI find I have omitted to say anything on one topic\nat which I hinted in an earlier portion of my Address,\nviz., the bearing of our enquiry on religion. It is a large\nsubject and one too nearly trenching on the region of emotion\nto be altogether suitable for the consideration of a scientific\nSociety. Yet every science has its practical applications,\nand though they are not part of the science, they are\nits legitimate outcome, and the value of the science to\nhumanity must be measured in the last resort by the use\nwhich humanity can make of it. To the enthusiast, science\nfor the sake of knowledge, without ulterior ends, may be\nenough,\u2014and if there were none of this spirit in the\nworld we should be poorer than we are ;\u2014but for the bulk\nof mankind this is too high or too arid a creed, and people\nin general must see just enough outcome to have faith\nthat there may be yet more.\nThat our researches will ultimately have some bearing,\nsome meaning, for the science of Theology, I do not doubt.\nWhat that bearing may be I cannot tell. I have indicated\nin an article in the Hibbert Journal for January part of\nwhat I feel on the subject, and I have gone as far in\nthat article as I feel entitled to go. We seek to unravel\nthe nature and hidden powers of man ; and a fuller under\nstanding of the attributes of humanity cannot but have\nsome influence on our theory of Divinity itself.\n\fXLVi.] 21\nPresidential Address.\nIf any scientific Society is worthy of encouragement and\nsupport it should surely be this. If there is any object\nworthy the patient and continued attention of humanity, it\nis surely these great and pressing problems of whence, what,\nand whither, that have occupied the attention of Prophet\nand Philosopher since time was. The discovery of a new\nstar, or of a marking on Mars, or of a new element, or\nof a new extinct animal or plant, is interesting : surely the\ndiscovery of a new human faculty is interesting too. Already\nthe discovery of \" telepathy \" constitutes the first-fruits of\nthis Society's work, and it has laid the way open to the\ndiscovery of much more. Its aim is nothing less than the\ninvestigation and better comprehension of human faculty,\nhuman personality, and human destiny.\n\f22 [part\nProfessor William James.\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEWS.\nHuman Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death, By Frederic\nW. H. Myers. 2 vols. 8vo. (Longmans, Green & Co., London,\nNew York, and Bombay. 1903.)\nL\nSuch large portions of the text of these bulky volumes, which are\nthe legacy of Myers's literary life, have already appeared in these\nProceedings, and their author's general conceptions are so familiar\nto my readers, that I feel free to omit from this notice all detailed\naccount of the book's contents and composition. For aught I know\nsuch an account may be given by my fellow-reviewers. The contents\nare so intricate and the ideas so many that the great danger is\nthat of not seeing the forest for the trees, and of not appre\nhending with distinctness the steps of Myers's reasoning. It seems\nto me wisest, therefore, to employ the opportunity accorded me\nin analysing his argument into its essential features, following, as\nI do so, a logical rather than a textual order.\nWhat would entitle Myers, if he were successful in what he\nattempted, to be regarded as the founder of a new science is that con\nception of the Subliminal Self, by which he colligated and co-ordinated\na mass of phenomena which had never before been considered\ntogether, and thus made a sort of objective continuum of what,\nbefore him, had appeared so pure a disconnectedness that the\nordinary scientific mind had either disdained to look at it, or pro\nnounced it mostly fictitious. Two years ago I wrote in these Pro\nceedings that Myers had endowed psychology with a new problem\u2014\nThe exploration of the subliminal region being destined to figure here\nafter in that branch of learning as \" Myers's problem.\" Reading these\n\fXLvi.] Review of Human Personality. 23\nvolumes, we gain a definite idea of how far he himself had pushed\nforward the topographical survey of that region.\nConservatives in anthropologic science will immediately say that\nMyers used the concept of the \" subliminal \" far too broadly, and\nthat the only safe demarcation of the term is that of the neuro\npathologists. These observers for the most part now recognise a\nsubliminal region frankly, but they recognise it only as a dissociated\npart of the normal personality. Experiences forgotten by the upper\nconsciousness may here still lead a parasitic existence, and in an\ninferior, dreamlike way may interfere with normal processes. For\nthese critics the subliminal is synonymous with the forgotten and\nforms a region of disintegration exclusively.\nMost neurologists either ignore those other \"evolutive,\" \"superior,\"\nor \" supernormal \" phenomena, in which Myers's chief interest lay, or\nscout them wholesale as deceptions. The few who admit them are\nmore likely to see in them another department of experience\naltogether than to treat them as having continuous connection with\nthe ordinary phenomena of mental dissociation.\nThose who simply ignore them (for whatever reason) may them\nselves be ignored here as belated students. However acutely awaie\none may be of thje sources of fallacy in reports of the marvellous, I\nfail to see how the records quoted in these volumes, and in vastly\ngreater profusion in Gurney's Phantasms of the Living and the other\nS.P.R. publications, can rightfully be met by a wholesale and in-\ndiscriminating turn possumus. Any one with a healthy sense for\nevidence, a sense not methodically blunted by the sectarianism of\n'\u2022 Science,\" ought now, it seems to me, to feel that exalted sensi\nbilities and memories, veridical phantasms, haunted houses, trances\nwith supernormal faculty, and even experimental thought-transference,\nare natural kinds of phenomenon which ought, just like other\nnatural events, to be followed up with scientific curiosity.\nHypnotic phenomena form the centre of perspective for Myers's\nmap of the subliminal region. In the first place, the system of\nfaculty of a subject under hypnosis is quite different from his waking\nsystem of faculty. While portions of the usual waking system are\ninhibited, other portions are sometimes supernormally energised in\nhypnosis, producing not only hallucinations, but after-results in the\nway of sense-discrimination and control of organic function, to which\nthe waking consciousness is unable to attain. We are thus led to\nthe notion of two different currents of mental life, one deeper, and\nthe other shallower, of which either is best appealed to while the\n\f24 [part\nProfessor William James.\nother is in abeyance. That these currents may not only alternate\nbut may co-exist with each other is proved by Gurney's, Binet's, and\nJanet's discovery of Subjects who, receiving suggestions during\nhypnosis and forgetting them when wakened, nevertheless then\nwrote them out automatically and unconsciously as soon as a pencil\nwas placed in their hands.\nAllying the curative phenomena of hypnosis with the great\nreparative powers of sleep, and its enhancements of faculty with the\nenhancements of faculty to which dreaming and natural somnam\nbulism occasionally give rise, Myers postulates a region of sleeping\nconsciousness present at all times in all of us, a region moreover\nwhich in certain respects has an advantage over the waking levels of\nthe mind. This subliminal region is usually closed off from the\nordinary waking consciousness, but under special conditions of appeai,\nwhich vary with the idiosyncrasy of the individual, it may break in\nwith effects which reveal its presence to us. The popular word\n\" suggestion \" is only a name for a successful appeal to this sub\nliminal consciousness.\nThe appeal, in hypnotic subjects, is made through the ordinary\nconsciousness in the first instance ; and into that consciousness the\neffects, when they are \"post-hypnotic,\" return in {he form of \"auto\nmatisms,\" sensory or motor. In other words, hallucinations or\nunmotived impulses to act, which in some cases are upheavals from\nthe subliminal into the supraliminal region, may be so in all cases.\nThe two regions thus form environments for each other, with\npossibilities of interaction, though under ordinary conditions their\nintercourse is small.\nSo far Myers would seem to be on perfectly solid ground. There\nis a subliminal region of life which opens fitfully into the supraliminal\nregion. The only doubt is as to whether it be general in human\nbeings, or whether it be not limited to a few hypnotic and. hysteric\nsubjects.\nThe subliminal region being thus established as an actuality, the\nnext question is as to its farther limits, where it exists. My sub\nliminal, for instance, has my ordinary consciousness for one of its\nenvironments, but has it additional environments on the remoter\nside 1 Has it direct relations of intercourse, for example, with the\nconsciousness, subliminal or supraliminal, of other men ?\nSome of the phenomena of hypnotism or mesmerism suggest that\nthis is actually the case. I refer to the reports (several of them\nirreproachably recorded) of hypnotism at a distance, of obedience to\n\fReview of Human Personality. 25\nunspoken orders, and of \" community of sensation \" between hypnotiser\nand subject, of which Sections 568 to 571 of Myers's Volume I. give\nsome account Remote influences, to which the supraliminal region is\nclosed, may thus occasionally pass into the subliminal region, showing\nthat this latter communicates not only with the supraliminal mind\nof the subject himself, but with the mind of other persons, and\npossibly with a still wider world.\nHow wide this world may possibly be is suggested by all the\nvarious reports of thought-transference and clairvoyance in the hyp\nnotic state. And if we now pass beyond conditions of artificial\nhypnosis, and take into account states of abstraction like those pro\nduced in some persons by crystal gazing and by automatic writing,\nand the \"trances\" of certain somnambulists and mediums, with the\nclairvoyant faculty reported to be found therein, we find ourselves\nobliged (if we credit the reports) to assume that the subliminal life\nhas windows of outlook and doors of ingress which bring it (iu some\npersons at least) into a commerce, of which the channels entirely\nescape our observation, with an indefinitely extended region of the\nworld of truth.\nThe jump which Myers makes here is that of generalising his\nconclusions. The \"conservative\" critic who does not deny the\nfacts in tolo would most probably call them pathological freaks of\nidiosyncrasy. He would protest against their being treated as revela\ntions of the constitution of human nature at large. Myers, on the\nother hand, regards them as such revelations, and considers that\nthe subjects show their \" idiosyncrasy \" rather in lying as open as\nthey do to our observation, than in having the kind of human con\nstitution which the observations disclose.\nHe is thus led to the general conception of a subliminal life\nbelonging to human nature in general, and having its own indefinitely\nwide environment, distinct from that with which our bodily senses\ncarry on their commerce. Set over against this subliminal life, and\nin strong contrast with it, we find the normal consciousness, dealing\nprimarily through the senses with the material world, and in pos\nsession of faculties of attention, and in particular of memory, which\nare pitifully small in comparison with those which the subliminal\nconsciousness wields. The normal consciousness is thus only a\nportion of our nature, adapted primarily to \" terrene \" conditions.\nThose more directly intuitive faculties which it lacks, and of which\nwe get glimpses in individuals whose subliminal lies exceptionally\nopen, can hardly be vestiges, degenerations of something which our\n\f26 [part\nProfessor William James.\nancestors once possessed. We should rather regard them as germs\nof something not yet evolved for methodical use in our natural\nenvironment, but possibly even now carrying on a set of active\nfunctions in their own wider \" cosmic \" environment.\nThe \"supernormal\" becomes thus for Myers synonymous with the\n\"evolutive\" as contrasted with the \" dissolutive\" with which the\nordinary neurologist would prefer to connect it. The supernormal\nfaculties of the subliminal take us into the cosmic environment ; and\nfor Myers this cosmic environment takes on more and more. as the\nvolumes proceed, the character of a \" spiritual world.\" From its inter\ncourse with this spiritual world the subliminal self of each of us may\ndraw strength, and communicate it to the supraliminal life. The\n\"energising of life\" seems, in fact, to be one of its functions. The\nreparativeness of sleep, the curative effects of self-suggestion, the\n\" uprushing \" inspirations of genius, the regenerative influences of\nprayer and of religious self-surrender, the strength of belief which\nmystical experiences give, are all ascribed by Myers to the \" dynamo-\ngeny \" of the spiritual world, upon which we are enabled to make\ndrafts of power by virtue of our connection with our subliminal.\nHe dreams of a methodical evolution and extension, as our know\nledge of the channels shall improve, of our resources in this direction.\nMyers's theory, so far, is simple enough. It only postulates an\nindefinite inward extension of our being, cut off from common con\nsciousness by a screen or diaphragm not absolutely impervious but\nliable to leakage and to occasional rupture. The \" scientific \" critic\ncan only say it is a pity that so vast and vaguely defined a hypo-_\nthesis should be reared upon a set of facts so few and so imperfectly\nascertained.\nThe vagueness of the hypothesis at this point chiefly consists in the\nill-defined relations of the subliminal with its \"cosmic\" environment.\nIs this latter the Absolute Soul of the World, with which all our\nsubliminals may be supposed to be substantially continuous? Or\nare the various subliminals discontinuous 1\u2014and is their intercourse\ntransacted across an isolating interval 1\nAs the work proceeds, Myers tends more and more towards\nthe latter conception : the \" spiritual world \" becomes a \" world of\nspirits \" which interact.\nThis follows naturally from the consideration, to which he next\nproceeds, of veridical phantasms and mediumistic messages. At first\nsight \"ghosts,\" etc., (if admitted to be actual phenomena) would\nseem to require a physical rather than a mental hypothesis for their\n\fXLvI.] 27\nReview of Human Personality.\nexplanation ; and mediumistic messages, if taken at their face value,\nsuggest that the \"controlling\" spirit intrudes into the very organism\nof the medium rather than that it merely actuates the medium's\nsubliminal mind. The plot thickens very much hereabouts, and\nobliges one to ask more definitely whether the environment of the\nsubliminal be mental exclusively or whether it may not also be\nphysical. Myers is shy of putting forth psychophysical hypotheses,\nbut in his conceptions of \" phantasmogenetic invasion \" of space and\nof \" telergy \" and \" telekinesis,\" we find that he is forced to abandon\npurely mental territory. Subliminal selves, affecting one another in\ntheir quality of purely psychic entities, are not the sole factors that\nneed be considered in our explanations. Space and their physical\nrelations to space are also required.\nLet me indicate very briefly what are the essential points in\nMyers's handling of this new range of experiences.\nIn the first place, take the so-called \"veridical phantasms of the\nliving.\" Assuming them to be established by the evidence, the\nrecords show that the mind of the percipient must be at least one of\nthe factors of their production. If they were purely physical or\n\" astral \" presences, why should they wear earthly clothes, and carry\nearthly accessories 1 and when the percipient is in the midst of com\npanions, why should they so seldom appear to them ?\nEvidently the phantasm, whatever may be its remoter starting-\npoint, involves, as a mere immediate bit of experience, the psycho\nphysical process called \" hallucination \" on the part of the percipient\nhimself.\nSecondly, since there are well recorded cases where a living person,\nA, made his phantasm appear to B by simply willing that it should\ndo so, and since in many of the other cases of phantasms of the\nliving, the person who appeared probably wished to appear where he\ndid appear, it seems fair to interpret these appearances generally as\nhallucinations produced by the action of one mind upon another,\nsomewhat after the pattern of the hallucinations which a hypnotiser\nmakes his subject experience so easily by suggesting that he shall\nhave them, either during the hypnosis or after waking up. \"Tele\npathy \" is the name which Myers gave to the immediate influence of\none subliminal upon another. The records seem to prove that\ntelepathy either may or may not be a transfer of ready-made content\nfrom one mind to another. Sometimes the influencing mind appears\nto act only as a suggestive stimulus, and the results on the mind\ninfluenced show every variation from a vague emotional mood to an\n\f28 [part\nProfessor William James.\nelaborated perception full of accessories, or to an automatically\nimpulsive act.\nActivity of the influencing mind at a distance from its body is at any\nrate proved, according to Myers, by these phantasms of the living\nand by other telepathic phenomena.\nIt is round this conception of action at a distance, to which Myers\napplies the term of \" psychical invasion,\" that his theory now turns\ntowards its ulterior developments.\nThe fact that a phantasm may appear to a whole collection of\npersons at once, or to an indifferent companion of the person, rather\nthan to the person himself of whom the phantasm's original might\nreasonably be supposed to be thinking, suggests that our soul's invasive\npowers apply to outer space as well as to other minds. Myers cites\nexamples of these, as of all other special types of case which his\nargument requires, and considers that the probability of this space-\ninvasion by the subliminal powers of the living is strengthened by\ntwo additional kinds of fact. First we have cases of apparent\n\" bilocation \" of mind and organism, as when a living person appears\nto view his own body from a remote position, or to see his own\n\" double \" as a phantasm ; and second, we have an impressive array\nof oases which make for \"travelling\" clairvoyance, (\" telsesthesia,\" as\nMyers calls it) whether in dream, in crystal gazing, or in the mesmeric\ntrance. Myers indulges in no hypothesis whatever as to the modus\noperandi of this space-invasion by our subliminal. At any rate\nit seems to bring space in as a portion of the subliminal's environ\nment. The subliminal has relations with space as well as with other\nminds.\nSo far the powers of living persons have been considered exclusively.\nBut phantasms of the slowly or suddenly dying shade by continuity\nof time-relation into phantasms of the recently dead, and these in turn\nshade into phantasms of the long dead, i.e. into narratives of the\nhaunted-house type, of which the mass recorded is decidedly imposing.\nThe order of theoretic construction, if we go back to the beginning,\nis thus somewhat as follows :\u2014From hyperesthesia in the hypnotic\nstate we pass gradually into telepathy between the subject and the\noperator ; from this to phantasmogenetic telepathy between living men\nat a distance from one another ; from this to space-invasions, whether\nphantasmogenetic or clairvoyant, by the subliminal of living persons ;\nand finally from this to similar invasions (phautasmogenetic, at any\nrate) by the dead. We thus reach the hypothesis of spirit survival.\nPrimarily, we reach this only in the somewhat idiotic form of \" ghosts,\"\n\fReview of Human Personality. 29\nfor up to this point we have been considering only what Myers calls\nautomatisms of the sensory order.\nBut motor automatisms carry us a good deal further towards a\n\"world of spirits.\" Sensory automatisms seem to be essentially\nfugacious. Rarely is their content elaborately developed or pro\nlonged. It is quite otherwise with automatic writing and speech,\nfor here the messages are consecutive, and bring explicit pro\nfessions of origin and purpose along with them. This may obtain\nwhen the subject who offers them is awake as well as when he is\nentranced.\nThe whole topic of \"spirit messages\" is thus opened up to our\nreflection. Although Myers died before he could write out his review\nof the evidence for spirit messages in detail, he all along shows that\nhe deemed it sufficient : some such messages, at any rate, he held\nto have been proved authentic. With this our \"cosmic\" environment,\nas he believed in it, comes into full view. Our subliminals surround\none another and act upon one another, as well as upon space ; and\nspirits of the departed (which may themselves be constituted as\nwe are, and have something like a subliminal condition of their own)\nmay also act upon us and upon space, and receive our action too.\nWhen the action is transient, it is probably merely an impact upon\nour subliminal, of which we need not necessarily suspect the source.\nWhen it is more protracted or \" invasive,\" space gets affected, and we\neither see a ghost or feel a presence ; and it is an open question, in\nsuch effects as these upon our consciousness, how far our subliminal\nmind exclusively receives the operation of the invader, and how far\nhe may act directly on our physical nervous system. Prolonged\n\"possession\" or \"control\" of the organism seems to involve the\nprofoundest sort of operation which is possible ; and Myers is willing\nhere to admit that the foreign spirit may directly actuate the\nmedium's nervous system.\nThat spirits of departed men should actuate these living bodies\nof ours directly, shows a form of physical influence to which Myers\ngives the name of telekinesis, and of which still other instances would\nbe the raps, the table-movings without contact, and the other\n\"physical phenomena of mediumship,\" as they are commonly termed.\nMyers discusses these phenomena warily, using delicate methods of\ngradual approach (see especially the exquisitely ingenious \" Scheme\nof Vital Faculty,\" which ought to have been prominently printed\nas the concluding chapter of the whole book, but which appears in\nconspicuously among the Appendices as Section 926 A, Vol. Ii.,\n\f30 [part\nProfessor William James.\npp. 505-554). On the whole he seems well disposed to treat the\nevidence for physical phenomena as adequate.\nAnd now his whole theory lies before us. It is a vast synthesis,\nbut a coherent one, notwithstanding the vagueness of some of the\nterms that figure in it. No one of the dots by which his map is\nplotted out, no one of the \" corners \" required by his triangulation,\nis purely hypothetical. He offers empirical evidence for the concrete\nexistence of every element which his scheme postulates and works\nwith. In logical form the theory is thus a scientific construction of\na very high order, against which one can urge only two general kinds\nof objection. One can say first that the stepping-stones themselves,\nthe corners, are too frail, that the types of fact invoked need much\nadditional corroboration ; or one can say, even if the kinds of facts\nwere admitted to be solid where they have been observed, that Myers\nhas ascribed a universality and an extension to them for which he has\nno warrant, that he has drawn his rules from the exceptional cases,\nand made his spiritual universe too continuous.\nDisregarding these criticisms for the moment, I am impelled to\n\u25a0say a word about this matter of Myers's \" scientific \" ability. Reading\nhim afresh in these two volumes, I find myself filled with an admir\nation which almost surprises me. The work, whatever weaknesses it\nmay have, strikes me as at least a masterpiece of co-ordination and\nunification. The voluminous arsenal of \"cases\" of which the author's\nmemory disposes might make the most erudite naturalist or historian\n\u25a0envy him, and his delicate power of serially assorting his facts, so\nas to find always just the case he needs to fit into a gap in the\n\u25a0scheme, is wholly admirable. He shows indeed a genius not unlike\nthat of Charles Darwin for discovering shadings and transitions, and\ngrading down discontinuities in his argument.\nThree circumstances, probably, have worked against the general\npublic recognition of Myers's scientific powers. These have been,\nfirst, the nature of the material he worked in ; second, his literary\n.fluency ; and third, his emotional interest in immortality. The two\nJatter characteristics, combining their effects, have given to certain\npassages in the present volumes a tone so lyrical that it may well\nmake them distasteful to the ordinary scientific reader. For propa\ngandist purposes the existence of these passages is, I think, to be\nregretted. Myers could well have afforded (having shown his undis\nputed lyrical power elsewhere) to be dryer in this argument, and by\nbeing so he would have doubtless turned certain possible disciples,\naow lost to him, into respectful listeners. But he so habitually saw\n\fxlvi.] 3 1\nReview of Human Personality.\nthe meanest subliminal phenomena in the light of that transterrene\nworld with which they might remotely be connected, that they\nbecame glorified in his mind into experiences in themselves majestic.\nAll his materials were objects of love to him, and the richly latinized\nand hellenized vocabulary in which he spoke of them shows how they\naffected his imagination.\nFrom this point of view I think we need not regret a feature of\nthese volumes which to some persons may have seemed pathetic.\nMyers, namely, was cut off by death before he could write his direct\ndiscussion of the evidence for spirit-return. But that discussion is a\nmatter of dry-as-dust detail which may well be left to the pages of\nour Proceedings and Journal, and to workers who are not such\nuniversal geniuses. He has fully expressed in this book his general\nposition on the subject ; and being so lyrical a fountain in the direction\nof immortality, he could hardly have embarked on the evidence\nwithout alienating still more a class of students whose sympathy may\non the whole be precious. Even though the cap-stone of the work,\nas he projected it, be lacking, still the essential Myers is in it, for it\nis as the organiser and co-ordinator, far more than as the critic of\nthis or that particular set of observations, that posterity will best\nremember him.\nAs regards the truth of his theory, as contra-distinguished from\nits formal merits as a constructive effort, it is certainly too early\nfor any one to pass dogmatic judgment. Most readers, even those\nwho admire the scheme as a whole, will doubtless shrink from\nyielding their credence to it unreservedly. It will seem like skating\nover ice too thin for any intellect less nimble than Myers's to place\nits feet on boldly. The types of case which he uses as stepping\nstones are some of them, at present, either in quality or quantity,\ndecidedly weak supports for the weight which the theory would rest\nupon them, and it remains at least possible that future records may\nnot remedy this frailty.\nThe reproach that he has over-generalized the exceptional is also\none which, in the present state of our knowledge, cannot be decidedly\nrebutted. He may extend the subliminal too far when he sup\nposes that all of us possess it, and that works of genius generally\nhave their source in it. He may extend \" phantasms \" too far\nwhen he fills a whole cosmic environment with spirits able to en\ngender them. As between the individual subliminal and the cosmic\nenvironment, he may also not have drawn the boundary correctly.\nThere may well be more of the \"dissolutive\" subliminal and less of the\n\f32 [part\nProfessor William James.\n\" spirit \" than he supposes, in some of his palmary phenomena. But\nhowever it may have to be contracted in one case, or extended in\nanother, the subliminal region, as Myers conceived it, will remain\na vera causa in psychology, explanatory, either of the whole or of a\npart, of the great mass of occult occurrences so far as they are\nauthentic. \" Automatisms \" are indeed what he first said they were,\nmessages from the subliminal to the supraliminal regions.\nThe imperfection which I feel most acutely in Myers's survey of\nthe subliminal life is its failure adequately to account for its being\nso impartially the home both of evolutive and of dissolutive pheno\nmena. The parasitic ideas of psycho-neurosis, and the fictitious\npersonations of planchette-writing and mediumship reside there side\nby side with the inspirations of genius, with the faculties of telepathy\nand tela'sthesia, and with the susceptibility of genuine spirit-control.\nMyers felt the paradoxical character of such cohabitation, and, as\nusual, was ready with a suggestion for attenuating the difficulty.\n\" It may be expected,\" he writes, \" that supernormal vital pheno\nmena will manifest themselves as far as possible through the same\nchannels as abnormal or morbid vital phenomena, when the same\ncentres or the same synergies are used. ... If there be within\nus a secondary self aiming at manifestation by physiological means,\nit seems probable that its readiest path of externalisation\u2014its\nreadiest outlet of visible action\u2014may often lie along some track\nwhich has already been shown to be a line of low resistance by the\ndisintegrating processes of disease, ... lie along some plane of\ncleavage which the morbid dissociations of our psychical synergies\nhave already shown themselves disposed to follow \" (Vol. Ii., p. 84).\nBut this conception is deficient in clearness. Are there three\nzones of subliminal life, of which the innermost is dissolutive, the\nmiddle one superior (the zone of genius, telepathy, etc.), and the\noutermost svmeme and receptive directly of the impact of the spirit-\nworld ? And can the two latter zones reach the supraliminal\nconsciousness only by passing through the interior and inferior\nzone, and consequently using its channels and mixing its morbid\neffects with their own ? Or is the subliminal superior throughout\nwhen considered in itself, and are the curious parasitisms of hysteria\nand alternate personality, and the curious uncritical passivity to\nthe absurdest suggestions which we observe in hypnosis to be\nexplained by defective brain-action exclusively, without bringing\nin the subliminal mind ? Is it the brain, in short, which vitiates\nand mixes results, or is it the interior zone of the subliminal\n\fxlvi.] 33\nReview of Human Personality.\nmind ? I make no attempt to solve the question.1 It is practi\ncally as well as theoretically a vital one, for there can be no doubt\nwhatever that the great obstacle to the reception of a Weltanschauung\nlike Myers's is that the superior phenomena which it believes in\nare so enveloped and smothered in the mass of their degenerative\ncongeners and accompaniments that they beget a collective impres\nsion of disgust, and that only the strongest of mental stomachs can\npick them over and seek the gold amongst the rubbish.\nMeanwhile it must not be forgotten, if one finds Myers's map\nunsatisfactory, that no regular psychologist has ever tried his hand\nat the problem. Psychologists admit a subliminal life to exist in\nhypnosis and in hysteria, and they use a case like that of Janet's\n\"Adrienne\" to explain the manner in which \"secondary personalities\"\nmay become organised. But the existence all about us of thousands\nand of tens of thousands of persons, not perceptibly hysteric or un\nhealthy, who are mediumistic to the degree at any rate of being\nautomatic writers, and whose mediumism results in these grotesque\nimpersonations, this, I say, is a phenomenon of human life which\nthey do not even attempt to connect with any of the other facts of\nNature. Add the fact that the mediumship often gives supernormal\ninformation, and it becomes evident that the phenomenon cannot\nconsist of pure eccentricity and isolation. There is method in it ;\nit must have a context of some sort and belong to a region where\nother things can be found also. It cries aloud for serious investiga\ntion. Myers's map is the only scientifically serious investigation that\nhas yet been offered. It is to be hoped that those whom it dis\nsatisfies may not merely reject it, but also make some effort to\nprovide something better.\nI cannot conclude without paying my tribute to the innumerable\nfelicities of suggestion with which Human Personality abounds.\nMyers's urbanity of style, and his genius for analogy were never\nmore profusely displayed, or in so many directions. Bold as his\ntheory is, it is one of its merits that it should be so sober in the\nway of either physical or metaphysical hypothesis. What \"spirits\"\nare, or what their relations are to \" space,\" he never tries to say,\nbut uses the terms like a Naturforsche1; as mere designations for\nfactors of phenomena. The book on the whole must be considered\na worthy monument to his memory.\nWilliam Jamks.\n1 For Mr. Myers's treatment of the question, see especially Vol. I., pp.\n72-75.\u2014Editor.\nc\n\f34 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nII.\nMr. Myers' great conception of the subliminal self has been\nadopted, explained, parodied, and paraded, by several writers,\nusually in the garbled and misleading form that man has a dual\nnature or duplex soul, that sometimes the more usual, and some\ntimes the less usual aspect of his personality comes to the front\nand influences his actions and thoughts. In the form of a contest\nbetween two rival principles, this idea is extremely old ; and in\nthe form of a divided soul or bifurcated personality, a version of\nthe conception has been elaborated by Mr. Thomson Jay Hudson\nin an ambitious book extensively read in America called The Law\nof Psychic Phenomena,1 wherein it is sought to explain everything,\nfrom the Christian miracles downwards, by a crudely stated\nhypothesis of duplex personality or a double soul : an idea which\nseems to have been borrowed, without acknowledgment, from Mr.\nMyers' papers in the Proceedings, and spoiled in the borrowing.\nAnd in a recent number of the Nineteenth Century Mr. Mallock,\ngetting hold apparently of this version of Mr. Hudson's, has skil\nfully set it forth as if it were an explanation or summary of Mr.\nMyers' own theory ; and has pointed a flippant finger of scorn at\nthe triviality of the evidence, and at the futility of a life-work\nwhich has this conclusion for its result. Few essays which bear\na .superficial resemblance to the truth could readily be more mis\nleading or less illuminating than this article of Mr. Mallock's, and\nI am content to caution any student not to accept that ostensible\nsummary as giving any adequate or true idea of Mr. Myers'\ncomprehensive treatise.\nThe doctrine which Mr. Myers arrived at after years of study\nis that each individual as we perceive him is but a small fraction\nof a larger whole, is as it were the foliage of a tree which has its\nmain trunk and its roots in another order of existence ; but that\non this dark inconspicuous and permanent basis, now one and now\n1Reviewed in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. ix.. p. 230.\n\fXLvi.] 35\nReview of Human Personality.\nanother system of leaves bud, grow, display themselves, wither,\nand decay, while the great trunk and roots persist through many\nsuch temporary appearances, not independently of the sensible\nmanifestations, nor unassisted by them, but supporting them, dominat\ning them, reproducing them, assimilating their nourishment in the form\nof the elaborated sap called experience, and thereby growing\ncontinually into a more perfect and larger whole. Many metaphors\ncould be suggested, but this is the one which occurs to me now,\nand it carries us a certain distance.\nAs the tree periodically buds and blossoms into an aerial life, so\nwe bud and blossom in a terrestrial life, clothing ourselves with\nmaterial particles for a time, assimilating and utilising the sunshine\nand the dew, realising the existence and the neighbourhood of\nother organisms in a like stage of development, and joyfully\navailing ourselves of the consequences that flow from proximity\nand contemporaneous specialised existence.\nThe mystery of incarnation and of gradual development, of the\npersistence of existence beyond bodily death and decay, and even\nsome glimmerings of the possible meaning of the vague dream of\nso-called re-incarnation, all become in some sort intelligible on a\nbasis of this kind\u2014the basis of a full and never wholly manifested\npersistent self, from which periodically sprouts a terrestrial mani\nfestation, though never twice the same. Each terrestrial appearance\nflourishes and assimilates mental and moral nutriment for a time,\nand the result of each is incorporated in the constant and growing\nmemory of the underlying, supporting, but inconspicuously mani\nfesting, and at present barely recognised, fundamental self.\nAnd whereas we, the visible manifestations, exposed to sun and air,\ncan signal to each other and receive impressions through rays of\nlight and sound and heat, our transcendental portions with roots in\nanother order of being must be supposed capable of communication\ntoo; they are individualised but not isolated, being welded into\nthe framework of things in such way as to receive nutriment from\nsubterranean moisture and from dying relics of the past, even from\nthings which to the aerial portion seem useless or noxious; and they\nmay thus send up to the leaves strange streamings of sap laden with\nthe common wealth of mother earth.\nThe metaphor constantly breaks down, as all metaphors must\nsooner or later ; for some purposes it would seem better that the\ntree should be inverted; and the adjective \"subliminal\" contains\nno reference to what is beueath, except in the sense of foundation\n\f36 [PART\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nand support; in every other aspect the subliminal is probably the\nmore real and more noble, more comprehensive, more intelligent,\nself, of which the supraliminal development is but a natural and\nhealthy and partial manifestation.\nThe products of the subliminal are to be regarded as \"higher,''\nin a definite sense, than those of the supraliminal. The supra\nliminal is that which is the outcome of terrestrial evolution, and\nso is able to manifest itself in a planetary manner ; the subliminal\nhas a cosmic existence, which may play a part in terrestrial evolution\nhereafter, but at present only shows signs of doing so, as, for instance,\nin the supernormal uprushes which are known as the inspirations of\ngenius; signs which may be taken as anticipatory of the course of\nevolution in the future.\nIn this way sleep, death, genius, insanity, hysteria, hypnotism,\nautomatism, clairvoyance, and all other disintegrations, abnormalities,\nand supernormalities of personality, fall into a consistent compre\nhensive scheme; and it is the object of the book to elaborate\nthis hypothesis and to unify all these strange features of human\npersonality, features which have so long afforded an exercise\nalternately to resolute credulity and to blatant scepticism, and have\nso perennially perplexed mankind.\nIt may be that in this my brief summary and metaphorical repre\nsentation of the chief theoretical conclusion or unifying principle of\nthe book I too am guilty of a parody ; but I am writing for\nmembers of the Society, who will surely take the trouble to read the\nbook itself and not be put off with any brief account or compressed\nrecord of the work of what they know to have been an industrious\nlifetime. The book has been editorially prepared by a student for\nstudents, and is provided with syllabuses giving a conspectus of the\ncontents of each chapter, which may be valuable for reference and\nstudy after the chapter has been read. It is also provided with a\nglossary of terms and a copious index. For the student the book is\nwell adapted ; for the general reader its arrangement is troublesome,\nbecause each chapter and almost each section of each chapter has a\ndetached appendix as long as itself placed further on in the book ;\nand in order to read continuously constant turning over pages is\nnecessary. If the illustrative cases had been incorporated with the\ntext, it would have been easy for those pressed for time to skim\nthem, whereas the tendency now is to skip them altogether from\ntheir proper place, and read them, if at all, subsequently in an\nindigestible mass.\n\fXLvI.] 37\nReview of Human Personality.\nAnother feature of the book, against which many persons have\nrebelled, is the comparative smallness of the type and over-\ntransparency of the paper : necessitated probably by the bulk of\nmaterial, which otherwise would have run into three volumes.\nOn these trivial heads I say no more. ,\nThe book begins with an explanatory and properly prosaic Intro\nduction, and closes with a more poetic Epilogue.\nSuccessive chapters deal with the following subjects :\nFirst. Disintegration of personality, such as Multiple personality,\nand other hysterical and pathological cases.\nSecond. Genius, which is one of the most illuminating and brilliant\nchapters in the book, where the man of genius so far from being\nregarded as afflicted with any form of nascent insanity is regarded\nas the standard or norm of the race\u2014a product of a higher stage of\nevolution than the average man has yet attained.\nClearly a genius is one who can draw more than others on his\ncentral and sustaining subliminal organisation, one who can breathe\nout products obtained not from sun and air alone, but from roots\ndriven deep into the heart of the universe : one whose existence is\nnot planetary merely, but cosmic, and in whom subliminal uprushes\nof fructifying sap are frequent.\nThe next chapter deals with sleep, or the state wheu the supra\nliminal activities are dormant : when the sun has ceased to awaken\nfull activities, when the whole self is more massed together and\npartially withdrawn from its active planetary existence ; and when\nby dreams and visions some reminiscence of a wider though dimmer\npurview can sometimes be retained for a time and carried over into\nthe waking or terrestrially conscious existence.\nThis leads up to the chapter which deals with the artificial or\nexperimental induction of this state, the chapter on Hypnotism ; a\nprocess whereby the deeper strata of personality can be reached, and\nsuggestion and other influences implanted, which may subsequently\nbear fruit in waking life. One may liken this to gardening opera\ntions, such as grafting and manuring and other systems of treatment,\napplied not to the leaves or flowers of a tree direct, but to its\nbranches and roots ; operations which nevertheless influence those\nleaves and flowers in a subsequent and unmistakable manner.\nThe chapter on Sensory Automatism deals with those conditions\nof hallucination of the senses under which clairvoyance or pseudo-\nsense-impressions of various kinds are generated : furnishing avenues\nwhereby telepathy, crystal vision, and other perceptions, not received\n\f38 [part\nSii- Oliver Lodge.\nthrough the normal organs of sense but by some ill-understood\nsubliminal reaction, become possible.\nAnd chapter viii. in the second volume, on Motor Automatism,\nexpands this same region into the muscular or efferent output of\nthe same kind of faculty ;\u2014resulting in automatic writing, and\nother physical manifestations of subliminal activity, whether of the\nnature of inhibition or of propulsion, up to such strenuously active\nbut subliminally guided lives, as for instance those of Socrates and\nJoan of Arc. Between these two is interpolated a chapter on\nPhantasms of the Dead : those hallucinatory appearances or visions\nof departed persons, which are here treated as an example of\nsensory automatism on the part of the percipient, excited however\nin many cases veridically by external influence, and capable of\nconveying real information.\nAnd the chapter on Motor Automatism is similarly followed by\na chapter on the developed form of the same, viz. a chapter headed\n\" Trance, Possession, Ecstasy,\" in which certain well-known cases of\nveridical trance utterance are partially included, though with many\nserious omissions, due to the recent occurrence of some of the\ncases, so that insufficient time had been afforded for their complete\ndigestion and for a final decision as to their place and purport.\nThis, together with sensory and motor automatisms, may be regarded\nas the part of the subject-matter which has attracted most popular\nattention, and the part which when stated by itself seems to excite\nnothing but scepticism on the one hand and superstition on the\nother. It was Mr. Myers' plan to so gradually build or lead up\nto these strange phenomena that when reached they should be\nrealised as a fitting and natural consequence of what had gone\nbefore, leaving them no longer as an inaccessible or aerial structure\nwithout foundation, but as the upper storey of a large and lofty\nbuilding through which a fairly sound staircase had been constructed.\nMyers' life-work either achieves this unification or it does not.\nIf it does, this book, as I suggested last January in my Presidential\nAddress to the Society, will stand as a Novum Organon in psychical\nscience. If it does not, it may mean either that the attempt is\nimpossible, or that it still remains for some future pioneer to\nachieve that which for the present generation has turned out too\ndifficult.\nMyers himself took a modest, but I think hopeful, view of his\nlabours. He must have felt, at any rate his friends felt for him, that\nby the industry of himself and Gurney and the other founders of the\n\fxlvi.] Review of Hurtian Personality. 39\nSociety, he had, amassed and ready to his hands, a fund of material to\ndraw upon, such as no philosopher or psychologist had ever had before ;\nand although he himself would have seriously deprecated any com\nparison with the sages of the past, some of us felt that, building on\ntheir foundation, utilising their work, and fortified with such a vast\nmass of modern information, aided also by his classical learning and\nby a great natural scientific insight, with the opportunity of con\nsulting many scientific men, some hostile, some sympathetic to his\nresearches, and with the nineteenth century of science behind him,\ngifted also with considerable leisure, persistent enthusiasm, and\nindustry, he was a man supremely fitted to push back the barriers\nof ignorance in this region farther than had been accomplished before,\nand to give to the human race an insight into the hidden faculties\nand destiny of man such as not even the gigantic genius of Plato,\nnor the profound insight of Kant had been able to bestow.\nIt is not a matter on which an opinion of mine would be of\nvalue, nor would I be understood as expressing one, but the glorious\nsense of having accomplished a work worthy of the serious atten\ntion of humanity has blossomed in an Epilogue where the cosmic\nimport and religious significance of the whole vista of human faculty\nis eloquently set forth. And this specially written epilogue is happily\ncompleted and supplemented by his one Presidential Address to the\nSociety, an address which will be in the memory of many readers;\nand this is further supplemented by two short essays, one on the\n\"Decline of Dogmatism,\" wherein the ultimate upshot of the\nmessages which claim to come from another order of existence are\nbriefly summarised, and another on \" Prayer and Supplication,\"\nregarded from the illuminating point of view of the telepathic law.\nFrom this last I extract the following quotation :\u2014\n\"In the law of telepathy, developing into the law of spiritual\nintercommunication between incarnate and discarnate spirits, we see\ndimly adumbrated before our eyes the highest law with which our\nhuman science can conceivably have to deal. The discovery of\ntelepathy opens before us a potential communication between all life.\nAnd if, as our present evidence indicates, this telepathic intercourse\ncan subsist between embodied and disembodied souls, that law must\nneeds lie at the very centre of cosmic evolution. It will be evolu\ntionary, as depending on a faculty now in actual course of develop\nment. It will be cosmic ; for it may\u2014it almost must\u2014by analogy\nsubsist not on this planet only, but wherever in the universe dis\ncarnate and incarnate spirits may be intermingled or juxtaposed.\"\nOne other portion of the book must be mentioned, for it was a\n\f40 [part\nSir Oliver Lodge.\nlaborious attempt at a synthesis or conspectus of the whole, viz.,\nhis \" Scheme of Vital Faculty \"\u2014sadly buried by the arrangement of\nthe book between pages 505 and 555 of the second volume\u2014a scheme\nwherein the usual orthodox view of the tripartite nature of man is\nutilised, and each vital faculty is displayed under the aspect appro\npriate to the three heads, somatic, psychic, and pneumatic ; or, as he\nstyles them, supraliminal, subliminal, and spiritual. The scheme was\nthe result of a great deal of thought, but it is open to question in\nmany points of detail, and Myers would have been the last to insist\nthat each subject is classified precisely in the most appropriate manner,\nor that it always fits the niche provided for it. At the same time\nit would be well for future students to realise that Myers had a\nreason for his system of classification, and that though it may be\nchanged, it is worthy of being changed not lightly, but after due\nconsideration.\nHow far such a scheme as this soars above the range of the\northodox science of to-day is apparent from the fact that few of the\nfaculties catalogued and classified in it, beyond those in the first\ncategory, are as yet generally recognised as existing at all. A few\nfrom the second or middle category are coming into recognition\u2014\nsuch as suggestion, hyperesthesia, psycho-therapeutics, and telepathy\u2014\nbut the greater part even of this second list is still only on the\noutskirts of recognised knowledge ; while in Myers' view it is the\nthird and at present wholly ultra-scientific category which lies in\nthe path of future knowledge and development, and constitutes the\nmost pregnant portion of his message to mankind.\nIt is not to be claimed for a moment that these volumes will\nconvince a reader of the survival of personality beyond bodily death,\nif he was previously hostile to or otherwise fortified against such\nan idea. Perhaps they will convince nobody : I see no reason\nwhy they should. The main object of the book is not edification\nand finality, but stimulation to enquiry ; and convictions of any\nvalue are seldom attained by mere reading : they can only be\nformed by soaking one's mind in a subject for years, by \" con\ntinually thinking unto it,\" as Newton said. As the outcome of such\na process it became Myers' undoubted belief that intelligence and\nhuman personality persist beyond bodily death ; and that, between\nthe two states or conditions of being, intercommunication though\nextremely difficult was not altogether impossible. But this conclusion\nof his has been popularly seized and over-emphasised till to many\ncontemporaries it seems that an easy credulity on this point was his\n\fXLvl] 41\nReview of Human Personality.\ncharacteristic attitude. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nEasy credulity does not lead to a life-long labour and evolution of\na comprehensive scheme such as this. To those who have not been\nthrough it, the assured conviction which was the outcome of his\nlong training may seem like easy credulity ; just as the physicist is\noften twitted for believing in the reality of an \" ether,\" which to\nthe onlooker is a mere hypothesis\u2014a blank form to be filled up\narbitrarily at pleasure, and with no more reality than the figment of\na dream.\nThis is one of those cases, and there are several, where the\nonlooker does not see most of the game, where the man in the\nstreet with all his conspicuous ability is not an ultimate authority,\nand where the profound gibes of the clubs, or of a monthly maga\nzine, are not the conclusion of the whole matter.\nFor people who are immersed in such an atmosphere it is difficult\nto realise the strenuously-acquired full-bodied certitude, or the\nclear-visioned perception and what one can hardly help calling,\nin some sense, knowledge, whether it be concerning the \" ether \"\nor concerning the problem of what is known as human \" im\nmortality,\" which may be possessed by a specifically trained man\nof science. That is the position in which the author of these two\nvolumes seems to me definitely to have acquired the right to range\nhimself ; and in this estimate of his position I believe that scientific\nposterity will acclaim agreement. It is by the name of Man of\nScience that I wish to hail our late chief and leader, Frederic Myers.\nOliver Lodge.\n\f42 [PART\nProfessor Th. Floumoy.\nIII.\nL'ouvrage posthume de Fr\u00e9d. Myers constitue un monument si\nvaste et d'une telle richesse qu'il serait t\u00e9m\u00e9raire de le juger sur une\npremi\u00e8re et h\u00e2tive lecture. Ce n'est pas au lendemain de sa publi\ncation que l'on peut en appr\u00e9cier tous les d\u00e9tails et mesurer sa\nport\u00e9e r\u00e9elle : il y faut un certain temps d'accoutumance, de\nr\u00e9flexion, et, pour dire le mot, de digestion subliminale. Aussi me\nbornerai-je ici \u00e0 quelques remarques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, qui n'ont que la valeur\nd'impressions purement personnelles, d\u00e9nu\u00e9es de toute pr\u00e9tention au\ncomplet ou au d\u00e9finitif.\n(I.) Le premier point qui me frappe dans cet ouvrage est sa ten\ndance mixte, \u00e0 la fois scientifique et religieuse. Le but prochain de\nMyers est d'instituer une science, nouvelle, consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9mon\nstration exp\u00e9rimentale de l'existence et de la survivance de l'\u00e2me ;\nmais c'est en vue d'un but lointain, sup\u00e9rieur, \u00e0 savoir la fondation\nd'une nouvelle religion, dont le contenu, quintessence de ce qu'il y a\nde mieux dans le triple courant du christianisme, du bouddhisme,\net de la sagesse antique, reposera cette fois sur la connaissance et\nnon plus, comme par le pass\u00e9, sur la simple croyance. En soi cette\nentreprise n'est pas neuve, puisque l'id\u00e9e d'une synth\u00e8se religieuse\nd\u00e9finitive, bas\u00e9e sur l'exp\u00e9rimentation scientifique au lieu de la foi,\nappartient en commun \u00e0 toutes les sectes modernes de th\u00e9osophie et\nde spiritisme. Ce qui fait la puissante originalit\u00e9 de Myers, c'est la\nfa\u00e7on dont il en a tent\u00e9 et poursuivi la r\u00e9alisation, c'est l'\u00e9tendue\nde ses connaissances, la hardiesse de ses hypoth\u00e8ses alli\u00e9e \u00e0 6on sens\np\u00e9n\u00e9trant des m\u00e9thodes rigoureuses, en un mot la profondeur et la\nsolidit\u00e9 de son g\u00e9nie scientifique, qui ne le c\u00e8dent en rien \u00e0 celles\nde son enthousiasme religieux. Que l'on compare son ouvrage \u00e0\nceux d'Allan Kardec ou de tels autres \u00e9crivains fran\u00e7ais r\u00e9cents de\nla m\u00eame \u00e9cole : l'intention premi\u00e8re et la tournure d'esprit, je dirai\nla mentalit\u00e9 fondamentale, est identique, mais il y a la m\u00eame\ndiff\u00e9rence dans l'ex\u00e9cution qu'entre la hutte du sauvage et l'\u00e9difice\nd'un grand architecte, et l'on s'\u00e9tonne qu'il n'y ait que l'\u00e9cart de\n\fXLvi.] Beview of Human Personality. 43\nquelques ann\u00e9es ou de quelques lieues entre des \u0153uvres qui sem\nblent s\u00e9par\u00e9es par des milliers de si\u00e8cles.\nMais pour en revenir \u00e0 cette mentalit\u00e9 m\u00eame, qui aspire \u00e0 l'indis\nsoluble fusion de la Science et de la Religion, celle-ci reposant sur\ncelle-l\u00e0, j'avoue qu'elle me laisse perplexe. Je me sens disqualifi\u00e9\npour l'appr\u00e9cier. Personnellement en effet, je me suis trop\nprofond\u00e9ment p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9 aux jours de ma jeunesse de la distinction\nkantienne entre le \" Glauben \" et le \" Wissen \" (sans doute parce\nqu'elle r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 ma nature cong\u00e9nitale) pour pouvoir m'en\naffranchir aujourd'hui et me couler dans le moule oppos\u00e9. J'ai beau\navoir depuis longtemps oubli\u00e9 le d\u00e9tail des cat\u00e9gories et le syst\u00e8me\ncompliqu\u00e9 du philosophe de K\u00f4nigsberg, mon cerveau ou ma con\nscience subliminale n'en conservent pas moins, comme un pli\nind\u00e9l\u00e9bile, son inspiration fonci\u00e8re d'une h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 irr\u00e9ductible\nentre le croire, attitude essentiellement personnelle et morale, fond\u00e9e\nsur des sentiments de valeur, \u00e0 l'endroit des supr\u00eames r\u00e9alit\u00e9s inac\ncessibles \u00e0 la raison discursive,\u2014et le savoir, organisation des ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8nes dans les formes indiff\u00e9rentes, amorales, impersonnelles, de la\npens\u00e9e scientifique. Je ne pr\u00e9tends pas que cette sorte de dualisme\nsoit pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable en soi \u00e0 la position unitaire si brillamment repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e\npar Myers ; je dis seulement que, relevant de deux types psycholo\ngiques ou de deux mentalit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes, chacun de ces points de\nvue est bien difficile \u00e0 comprendre, et impossible \u00e0 juger \u00e9quitable-\nment, par ceux qui n'y sont pas adapt\u00e9s.\nLes natures comme Myers \u00e9prouvent \u00e9videmment un profond\nmalaise tant qu'elles n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 transformer les postulats de\nleur raison pratique (pour parler comme Kant)\u2014la vie future, l'exis\ntence de Dieu, la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du Devoir, la communion finale des \u00e2mes,\nl'efficacit\u00e9 de la pri\u00e8re, etc.\u2014en v\u00e9rit\u00e9s d'ordre scientifique, objective\nment d\u00e9montrables \u00e0 l'\u00e9gal de la rotation de la terre ou de la loi\nde Mariotte. C'est un malaise inverse, mais pareillement profond,\nque j'\u00e9prouve de mon c\u00f4t\u00e9 en voyant suspendre ces m\u00eames croyances,\nvitales et essentielles pour moi, au fil t\u00e9nu d'une recherche de patho\nlogie, d'une enqu\u00eate statistique ou d'une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9dium. Il me\nsemble que c'est porter atteinte aux ressorts les plus intimes de mon\n\u00eatre, que de les exposer ainsi \u00e0 tous les risques, en les rendant\nsolidaires d'interpr\u00e9tations ou de r\u00e9sultats scientifiques tenus aujour\nd'hui pour acquis, et demain peut-\u00eatre renvers\u00e9s. Des go\u00fbts et des\ncouleurs on ne peut discuter, et pas davantage de la confiance\nqu'inspirent \u00e0 l'individu les diverses voies qu'on lui propose pour\natteindre le R\u00e9el, saisir la V\u00e9rit\u00e9, asseoir sa vie morale ou sa foi\n\f44 [PAKT\nProfessor Th. Flournoy.\nreligieuse. Il est bien entendu, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, que tout ceci ne ren\nferme aucune esp\u00e8ce de critique ou de bl\u00e2me \u00e0 l'endroit de Myers.\nJe constate simplement que je ne suis pas fait comme lui, voil\u00e0\ntout ; mais je songe d'autant moins \u00e0 lui jeter la pierre, que\nj'ai rencontr\u00e9 autour de moi une foule de gens partageant (sans le\nconna\u00eetre) sa mani\u00e8re de sentir, sa soif inextinguible de certitude\nscientifique en mati\u00e8re religieuse, son ardent besoin d'une d\u00e9mon\nstration exp\u00e9rimentale et tangible de la vie future, etc. Et comme\nen d\u00e9finitive l'essentiel est que tout le monde soit content, je sou\nhaite que l'avenir lui donue raison, pour le bonheur de tant dames\ntourment\u00e9es \u00e0 qui la garantie de la science, appliqu\u00e9e comme un\npoin\u00e7on sur leurs aspirations intimes, rendrait aussit\u00f4t la joie et la\npaix\u2014sans aucun inconv\u00e9nient d'ailleurs pour ceux que ne tiennent\npas, ou ne se fient pas, \u00e0 cette estampille officielle.\n(II.) Les croyances et l'attitude religieuses visent au bout du\ncompte le fond des choses, l'\u00e9nigme supr\u00eame, le dernier mot de\nl'univers et de la vie. Pour placer ces fonctions de notre \u00eatre\nmoral sous la juridiction de la science exp\u00e9rimentale et appeler celle-ci\n\u00e0 prononcer en dernier ressort sur de pareilles questions, il faut\navoir en elle une confiance quasi-absolue, et ne pas s'embarrasser\ndes petites querelles que les philosophes lui ont faites sur sa port\u00e9e\nv\u00e9ritable. Aussi n'y a-t-il pas \u00e0 s'\u00e9tonner si l'un des traits carac\nt\u00e9ristiques de Myers est son indiff\u00e9rence pour les probl\u00e8mes de\nm\u00e9taphysique, ou de critique de la connaissance, agit\u00e9s par les pen\nseurs de ces derniers si\u00e8cles. Toutes les difficult\u00e9s du commerce de\nl'\u00e2me et du corps, les questions relatives au r\u00e9alisme et \u00e0 l'id\u00e9al\nisme, \u00e0 l'existence du monde mat\u00e9riel, aux conditions et limites de\nvalidit\u00e9 de notre connaissance, etc., Myers les passe r\u00e9solument sous\nsilence. L'histoire de la philosophie moderne n'existe pas pour lui.\nAmateur passionn\u00e9 de l'antiquit\u00e9 classique, il en cite volontiers les\npenseurs, surtout si ce furent des po\u00e8tes, mais c'est vainement qu'on\nchercherait sous sa plume les noms de Descartes ou de Spinoza, de\nHume ou de Berkeley, de Spencer ou de Ilenouvier. Leibnitz y est\nr\u00e9duit \u00e0 partager avec Hamilton une maigre note au bas de la page,\net Kant lui-m\u00eame n'apparait gu\u00e8re, au cours de ces deux volumes,\nque comme historiographe de Swedenborg. Myers ignore jusqu'\u00e0\nSchopenhauer, dont le \"Versuch iiber Geistersehen \" avec la th\u00e9orie\ndu \" Traumorgan \" aurait pourtant pu lui fournir d'int\u00e9ressants\npoints d'attache pour sa doctrine des facult\u00e9s subliminales. Il faut\nd'ailleurs lui rendre cette justice que s'il fait ainsi table rase de\ntoute la grande tradition philosophique occidentale, il ne recourt\n\fxlvl] 45\nReview of Hximan Personality.\ngu\u00e8re davantage \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature spirite ou occultiste de notre temps,\nsauf pour lui emprunter certaines observations de faits. C'est donc\nbien au pied de la lettre, et avec une parfaite cons\u00e9quence, qu'il se\ndonne pour le repr\u00e9sentant de la \" psychologie pal\u00e9olithique \" et\nque, sautant \u00e0 pieds joints par dessus toutes les fortes t\u00eates philo\nsophiques de notre civilisation (\u00e0 l'exception du seul Swedenborg),\nil va chercher ses vrais pr\u00e9curseurs dans \"les humbles penseurs de\nl'\u00e2ge de la pierre, les adeptes de la sorcellerie et du chamanisme.\"\nTels sont bien les anc\u00eatres dont il s'est donn\u00e9 pour t\u00e2che de\nremettre en honneur les conceptions oubli\u00e9es, en leur apportant\nl'appoint inattendu et triomphant de tout le tr\u00e9sor d'hypoth\u00e8ses ou\nde faits accumul\u00e9s par nos sciences exp\u00e9rimentales contemporaines.\nCar pour celles-ci, il les conna\u00eet admirablement, et il excelle \u00e0 les\nfaire servir \u00e0 ses desseins, en leur empruntant, avec une habilet\u00e9\nconsomm\u00e9e tout ce qui peut venir \u00e0 l'appui de ses vues, depuis les\nmenues observations de la psychopathologie jusqu'aux th\u00e9ories biolo\ngiques de l'\u00e9volution et aux petits d\u00e9mons de Clerk Maxwell jouant\navec les atomes.\nIci encore, il ne faut pas croire qu'en constatant ce go\u00fbt exclusif\nde Myers pour les sciences positives et son magnifique d\u00e9dain pour\nles probl\u00e8mes de la philosophie moderne, je songe \u00e0 lui en faire le\nmoindre reproche. Bien au contraire ; cette allure d\u00e9gag\u00e9e, cet\naffranchissement de tout pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 d'\u00e9cole, cette matter of-fadness si l'on\nme pa*se le terme, me plaisent infiniment. Il y a quelque chose de\npiquant et de bienfaisant <\u00e0 voir un syst\u00e8me carr\u00e9ment spiritualiste\nsortir\u2014par la simple vertu des m\u00e9thodes empiriques et de la\nlogique du bon sens, mais mani\u00e9es par un homme de g\u00e9nie\u2014sortir,\ndis-je, de ces m\u00eames sciences naturelles et m\u00e9dicales d'o\u00f9 tant de\nbruyants vulgarisateurs ont cru pouvoir tirer des synth\u00e8ses mat\u00e9ria\nlistes et hostiles aux croyances s\u00e9culaires de l'humanit\u00e9. Et si\nl'\u0153uvre de Myers a pour r\u00e9sultat final de faire un victorieux con\ntrepoids \u00e0 celle des B\u00fbchner, Haeckel et consorts, en les battant\npar leurs propres armes\u2014c'est \u00e0 dire sur le pur terrain du raisonne\nment exp\u00e9rimental, sans recourir aux subtilit\u00e9s de l'\u00e9pist\u00e9mologie,\u2014\nelle aura pleinement rempli sa t\u00e2che dans l'histoire de la pens\u00e9e\nhumaine, et nul ne lui trouvera \u00e0 redire d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 droit au but\nen d\u00e9daignant les d\u00e9tours traditionnels de la critique philosophique.\n(III.) Ceci m'am\u00e8ne \u00e0 parler du noyau plus particuli\u00e8rement\nscientifique de l'ouvrage de Myers, en laissant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sa philosophie\nreligieuse (que je trouve d'ailleurs tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e et pour laquelle\nj'\u00e9prouve la plus sympathique admiration). Abstraction faite des\n\f46 [part\nProfessor Th. Flournoy.\nAppendices, Glossaire, et autres pi\u00e8ces d'appui indispensables et du\nplus grand int\u00e9r\u00eat pour le lecteur, ce noyau consiste en huit\nchapitres formant deux groupes bien distincts. Les quatre premiers\nen effet (Disintegrations of Personality ; Genius ; Sleep ; Hypnotism)\ntraitent de faits couramment reconnus par la science contemporaine,\nmais auxquels Myers apporte une interpr\u00e9tation originale par sa\ndoctrine proprement psychologique sur la constitution de la per\nsonnalit\u00e9 humaine. Les quatre derniers chapitres au contraire, qui\nlui servent plus sp\u00e9cialement de fondement pour sa d\u00e9monstration de\nl'ind\u00e9pendance et de la survivance de l'\u00e2me, se meuvent dans des\nsph\u00e8res qui sont encore vues d'un fort mauvais \u0153il par la plupart\ndes savants en renom. Il convient donc de suivre l'auteur sur ces\ndeux terrains s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\nAppliqu\u00e9e au premier domaine, la th\u00e9orie myersienne de la Con\nscience Subliminale (assez connue pour que je me dispense de la\nr\u00e9sumer ici) me parait extr\u00eamement remarquable, et digne d'une\ns\u00e9rieuse attention de la part des psychologues (m\u00eame officiels et\nuniversitaires), par la merveilleuse souplesse avec laquelle elle se\nplie aux groupes de faits les plus divers, la clart\u00e9 dont elle les\nillumine aussit\u00f4t, l'enchainement et les relations inattendues qu'elle\nintroduit entre eux, l'ordre syst\u00e9matique en un mot et l'intelligence\nqui, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 elle, jaillissent tout \u00e0 coup de cette masse jusque-l\u00e0\nchaotique et obscure de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes plus ou moins \u00e9tranges. Sans\ndoute, sur bien des points elle d\u00e9passe notablement les donn\u00e9es\nrigoureuses de l'observation, et parfois elle peut sembler aventureuse\nou mystique dans sa mani\u00e8re de relier, de compl\u00e9ter et d'interpr\u00e9ter\nles ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes directement v\u00e9rifiables. Mais c'est l\u00e0 un trait in\n\u00e9vitable de toute th\u00e9orie par opposition \u00e0 la simple notation des faits\nbruts ; et la hardiesse d'une hypoth\u00e8se doit lui \u00eatre compt\u00e9e comme\nune qualit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que comme un d\u00e9faut, quand les seules cons\u00e9\nquences de cette hardiesse sont un \u00e9largissement de notre horizon,\nune intelligence plus compl\u00e8te et plus satisfaisante des donn\u00e9es\nempiriques, un \u00e9lan sup\u00e9rieur communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e et \u00e0 la\nrecherche. Or sous ces divers rapports la th\u00e9orie de Myers pr\u00e9sente\ndeux ou trois marques d'excellence qui me semblent la mettre actuelle\nment hors de pair (sans pr\u00e9judice des am\u00e9liorations qu'elle pourra\nsubir ult\u00e9rieurement).\n(1\u00b0.) D'abord elle embrasse sous elle, comme un point de vue\nsup\u00e9rieur et plus compr\u00e9hensif, une foule de th\u00e9ories analogues mais\nmoins \u00e9labor\u00e9es et ne cadrant chacune qu'avec un certain ordre\nrestreint de faits. Le polypsychisme de Durand de Gros, le double\n\fxlvl] Review of Human Personality. 47\nmoi de Dessoir, la d\u00e9sagr\u00e9gation mentale de Janet, les \u00e9tats hypno\u00efdes\nde Breuer et Freud, l'\u00eatre subconscient de Gyel, d'innombrables\ndoctrines allemandes de l'inconscient et de non moins innombrables\nth\u00e9ories fran\u00e7aises du somnambulisme et de l'hypnose, tout cela\nsemble n'\u00eatre en somme que des \u00e9bauches pr\u00e9liminaires, des frag\nments, ou des \u00e9chos d\u00e9form\u00e9s, de la doctrine m\u00eame de Myers. Les\nhistoriens futurs pourront s'\u00e9vertuer \u00e0 faire le d\u00e9part, dans ces\ncommunes analogies, entre ce que le psychologue anglais doit \u00e0 ses\ndevanciers ou \u00e0 ses contemporains moins brillants que lui, et ce que\nmaints de ces derniers lui ont au contraire emprunt\u00e9, sciemment ou\nnon, de son vivant; ce fait reste \u00e9vident \u00e0 mes yeux, que si l'id\u00e9e\nde la Conscience Subliminale (par opposition au Moi simple des\nspiritualistes classiques et \u00e0 la c\u00e9r\u00e9bration inconsciente des physio\nlogistes \u00e9troits) flotte dans l'air depuis une ou deux g\u00e9n\u00e9rations et\na perc\u00e9 simultan\u00e9ment, sous des formes diverses, dans l'esprit d'une\nfoule de chercheurs, c'est cependant bien le g\u00e9nie de Myers, qui a\ndonn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette id\u00e9e son expression actuellement la plus parfaite et\nla plus fouill\u00e9e.\n(2\u00b0.) Une preuve indirecte de la valeur et de la f\u00e9condit\u00e9 de la\ndoctrine de Myers, c'est le tr\u00e9sor de comparaisons heureuses et de\nformules bien frapp\u00e9es qu'elle lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es, et qui, encore trop\nignor\u00e9es des sp\u00e9cialistes toujours lents \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration\nles travaux des amateurs, jouiront certainement d'une faveur crois\nsante \u00e0 mesure que son \u0153uvre sera mieux connue. Je ne parle pas\nseulement des ing\u00e9nieux n\u00e9ologismes, dont plusieurs sont d\u00e9j\u00e0\ndevenus courants, incorpor\u00e9s par Myers au vocabulaire psychologique,\nmais aussi des explications \u00e9tonnamment simples et pr\u00e9cises que sa\nth\u00e9orie lui fournit pour des choses o\u00f9 tant de ma\u00eetres illustres\npataugent encore \u00e0 l'envi. Par exemple : l'hyst\u00e9rie, attribu\u00e9e par\nMyers \u00e0 \" an undue permeability of the psychical diaphragm \"\nentrainant un \u00e9tat de confusion dans les \u00e9changes entre la per\nsonnalit\u00e9 ordinaire et ses couches subconscientes plus ou moins\nmaladives; le g\u00e9nie, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9 par l'inspiration, c'est \u00e0 dire \"a\nsubliminal uprush of helpful faculty \" ; la suggestion, \u00e0 la fois\n\u00e9clair\u00e9e et circonscrite par cette d\u00e9finition, qui est un vrai chef\nd'oeuvre, \"a successful appeal to the subliminal self,\" etc. Tout\ncela, objectera-t-on peut-\u00eatre, ce sont des mots ou des images,\nnon des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s. Soit, mais comparez donc ces mots et ces images\naux autres assemblages d'images et de mots dont se paient les\nauteurs en vogue, et vous verrez vite de quel c\u00f4t\u00e9 se trouvent au\nplus haut degr\u00e9 la clart\u00e9 jointe \u00e0 la profondeur, l'exactitude dans\n\f48 [part\nProfessor Th. Flournoy.\nl'expression concise des faits en m\u00eame temps que l'approche d'une\nexplication r\u00e9elle et satisfaisante. Il n'y a qu'\u00e0 prendre par exemple\nles plus r\u00e9centes th\u00e9ories fran\u00e7aises de l'hyst\u00e9rie1 pour \u00eatre frapp\u00e9\nde voir combien toutes\u2014\u00e0 l'exception de celle de Janet, tr\u00e8s proche\nparente de celle de Myers et psychologique comme elle\u2014laissent au\nfond \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer, en d\u00e9pit de leurs fr\u00e9quentes pr\u00e9tentions physio\nlogiques, et sont encore rudimentaires \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la conception que la\ndoctrine de la conscience subliminale permet d\u00e9j\u00e0 de se faire de cette\nn\u00e9vrose. C'est bien autre chose encore quand on aborde l'hypno\ntisme et la suggestion, et qu'on voit tant d'auteurs se perdre en\ndiscussions oiseuses, faute de conna\u00eetre les id\u00e9es et les d\u00e9finitions si\nclaires de Myers.\n(3\u00b0.) Sa th\u00e9orie l'emporte sur toutes ses cong\u00e9n\u00e8res, \u00e0 ma con\nnaissance, par son ampleur et le champ qu'elle laisse ouvert \u00e0 des\npossibilit\u00e9s \u00e9ventuelles non encore r\u00e9alis\u00e9es ; en sorte que, m\u00eame \u00e0\nceux qui ne lui attribueraient aucune v\u00e9rit\u00e9 en soi, elle offre du\nmoins les avantages inappr\u00e9ciables d'un sch\u00e9ma suffisamment exten\nsible pour embrasser, \u00e0 l'occasion, nombre de faits nouveaux qui ne\ntrouvent point de place dans les th\u00e9ories scientifiques courantes et\nqui y d\u00e9tonent comme des intrus dont on ne sait que faire.

Mais\npoint n'est besoin d'aller si loin et d'inventer des circonstances\nencore imaginaires : il suffit de feuilleter la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale la\nplus r\u00e9cente pour y trouver, sous la plume d'auteurs fort peu suspects\nde mysticisme, deux exemples tout frais de ce que je veux dire.\nD'une part, des psychiatres fran\u00e7ais viennent de publier quelques\ncas d'ali\u00e9n\u00e9s ayant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, peu de jours avant leur fin, une\nam\u00e9lioration aussi subite qu'inexplicable, en m\u00eame temps que le\npressentiment net de leur mort prochaine.

Il me suffit de constater que, red\u00e9couverts\nces derniers temps par des savants de la nuance la plus positive, ils\ntrouvent ais\u00e9ment leur explication dans la th\u00e9orie des facult\u00e9s sub\nliminales de Myers, tandis qu'ils d\u00e9passent et heurtent la physiologie\ntraditionnelle pour le moins autant que l'anesth\u00e9sie sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e le faisait\nil y a soixante ans ; et si les corps officiels aujourd'hui ne s'insurgent\nplus, comme alors, contre des nouveaut\u00e9s aussi incroyables, c'est que\nceux-l\u00e0 m\u00eame qui affichent encore en paroles un souverain m\u00e9pris\npour la psychologie subliminale, sont \u00e0 leur insu d\u00e9j\u00e0 tout p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9s\nde cette derni\u00e8re, qu'ils ont respir\u00e9e avec l'air du temps, et peuvent\npar cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre compt\u00e9s comme des disciples malgr\u00e9 eux de la\ndoctrine de Myers.\nSi j'ajoute enfin que cette th\u00e9orie, quoique \u00e9labor\u00e9e sp\u00e9cialement\nsous la pression des faits anormaux ou morbides, s'applique \u00e9gale\nment \u00e0 la psychologie normale et permet d'en \u00e9lucider beaucoup de\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes quotidiens (le jeu des souvenirs, etc.) mieux que dans\nbien d'autres doctrines classiques, j'en aurais assez dit pour justifier\nle cas que je fais de l'\u0153uvre proprement scientifique de Myers. Il\nest grand temps que pathologistes et psychologues prennent enfin\ncontact avec elle, et que, mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 leurs pr\u00e9ventions vieillottes\ncontre tout ce qui vient des amateurs de \" psychical research \"\nindistinctement, ils se d\u00e9cident \u00e0 \u00e9tudier s\u00e9rieusement la doctrine de\nla Conscience Subliminale chez son plus illustre repr\u00e9sentant ; non\npas certes pour l'accepter aveugl\u00e9ment, mais afin de l'utiliser dans\nce qu'elle a d'excellent et de profond\u00e9ment vrai, de l'amender en\nses points faibles, et de l'adapter toujours mieux \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9\ndes ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes.\n(IV.) Pour ce qui est maintenant des quatre derniers chapitres\n(Sensory automatism ; Phantasms of the dead ; Motor automatism ; Trance,\npossession, and ecstasy), ils roulent sur des sujets br\u00fblants, qui seront\nprobablement longtemps encore une pomme de discorde parmi les\nD\n\f50 [part\nProfessor Th.

Les faits que Myers a r\u00e9colt\u00e9s ou observ\u00e9s lui-m\u00eame\nl'ont abondamment convaincu de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 fonci\u00e8re de l'antique\ncroyance spirite, dont le seul \u00e9nonc\u00e9 a coutume de donner des crises\n\u00e9pileptiques \u00e0 la plupart de nos penseurs modernes, \u00e0 moins qu'ils\nne se contentent de se voiler la face ou de hausser les \u00e9paules. Tout\nbien r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, je ne partage pas leur sentiment d'horreur ou de piti\u00e9 ;\nle spiritisme, d'ailleurs tr\u00e8s complexe et savamment \u00e9labor\u00e9 de Myers,\nne me parait point devoir \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement rejet\u00e9 d'embl\u00e9e pour\nl'unique raison qu'il est aux antipodes de nos habitudes scientifiques\nactuelles. En fait, notre psychologie, m\u00eame physiologique, repose\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 sur une absurdit\u00e9 telle qu'on n'en saurait concevoir de pire :\nje veux parler de l'union des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de conscience et des ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8nes c\u00e9r\u00e9braux. Qu'on la formule empiriquement comme un\ncommerce r\u00e9ciproque, ou une liaison fonctionnelle quelconque, ou un\nsimple parall\u00e9lisme, elle est de toute fa\u00e7on inintelligible, et ne cesse\npas de l'\u00eatre lorsqu'on se r\u00e9fugie dans les creuses m\u00e9taphores du\nmonisme, la th\u00e9orie du double aspect, de l'unit\u00e9 \u00e0 deux faces, du\nmiroitement subjectif du neurocyme, etc. En sorte que cela n'aggra\nvera gu\u00e8re la situation d'admettre, si les faits le riclament, que cette\ninconcevable union n'est pas \u00e0 l'abri du divorce, et que ces m\u00eames\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de conscience, que l'exp\u00e9rience ordinaire nous montre\nmyst\u00e9rieusement li\u00e9s \u00e0 des centres nerveux, peuvent s'en s\u00e9parer\nmomentan\u00e9ment ou d\u00e9finitivement sous forme de synth\u00e8ses mn\u00e9siques,\nde personnalit\u00e9s psychiques, d'\u00e2mes survivantes, d'esprits d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9s,\npeu importe le nom qu'on leur donne.\nSi les faits le riclament.

La\nmienne, apr\u00e8s avoir lu ces deux volumes, se trouve au m\u00eame point\nqu'avant, c'est \u00e0 dire d'une prudence et d'une sagesse tellement\nbanales que j'ose \u00e0 peine la formuler. Qu'il s'agisse de la t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie\n(entendue au sens de Myers, comme influence purement psychique,\nsans le secours de vibrations interc\u00e9r\u00e9brales), de la clairvoyance\n(t\u00e9lesth\u00e9sie), de la pr\u00e9cognition qui bouleverse nos id\u00e9es courantes sur\nle temps, de la possession enfin ou envahissement de l'organisme d'un\nmedium par les d\u00e9sincarn\u00e9s, j'estime : (1\u00b0) que les preuves et raisonne\nments avanc\u00e9s par Myers en faveur de ces ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes supranormaux\nconstituent, par leur nombre et leur poids, un dossier trop formidable\npour qu'on puisse d\u00e9sormais l'ignorer, \u00e0 moins de se boucher volon\ntairement les yeux; et que ce serait une folle niaiserie que de pr\u00e9\ntendre encore l'\u00e9carter en bloc sous le fallacieux pr\u00e9texte que ces sujets\n\fXLvi.] 51\nReview of Human Personality.\nne sont pas susceptibles d'\u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9s d'une mani\u00e8re scientifique.\n(2\u00b0) Que les conclusions de Myers ne ressortent pas de ce dossier avec\nune \u00e9vidence telle, une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 si in\u00e9luctable, qu'on puisse dores\net d\u00e9j\u00e0 les consid\u00e9rer comme hors de contestation. On me fera\ngr\u00e2ce, j'esp\u00e8re, des objections et discussions de d\u00e9tail ; il y faudrait un\nvolume, et je suis d'ailleurs incomp\u00e9tent sur la pi\u00e8ce principale du\ndossier, celle que Myers consid\u00e9rait lui-m\u00eame comme d\u00e9cisive et o\u00f9 il\nvoyait le couronnement de son \u00e9difice. Je veux naturellement parler\ndes ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de Mme Piper (et j'ajoute de Mme Thompson,\nqu'il est vraiment bien singulier de voir enti\u00e8rement pass\u00e9e sous\nsilence au cours de ces quatorze cents pages, quand on sait la place\nque ses s\u00e9ances ont tenue dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de la vie de\nMyers et dans la formation de ses convictions sur l'authenticit\u00e9 du\ncommerce spirite1).

Th. Flournoy.\n\fXLvi.] 53\nReview of Human Personality.\nIV.\nIt is hard to know the best point of view from which to approach\nMyers's great work in writing for the Society for Psychical Research,\nin whose publications so large a part of Human Personality has\nalready appeared, and to so many of whose members these pages\nwill still bring with them the memory of the thrill of word and\ngesture with which their author used to vivify them as he poured\nthem forth at our meetings in impetuous eloquence. It seems best,\non the whole, that for our members the earlier portion of the book\nshould be taken as known, and that no time should be spent on\nany criticism of the theory of the Subliminal Self, with which we\nare now so familiar. The evidential portion too may be taken for\ngranted, the more so as what evidence is now for the first time\npublished is not so extensive or so novel in character as to call\nfor special discussion.\nMyers's aim throughout was above all ethical ; his life's task was\nto give such a scientific proof of a future life as should provide a\ndominating motive for the conduct of this life : and it is by this\nstandard alone that he would have wished to be judged. I propose\ntherefore to devote myself almost entirely to the later chapters in\nwhich he sums up his conclusions from this point of view, and to\nindicate exactly how far I find myself convinced, and where I have\nto leave him, being unable to follow the argument with him to his\nend. The whole question must be for every one of us eminently\na personal one, and apologies are hardly called for if I endeavour to\nplace a personal view on record where no general concord is to be\nexpected for many years to come.\nUnfortunately the portion of the book which is in this respect\nthe most vital is precisely that which its author's death left in\ncomplete, and we lack the final revision of the ultimate synthesis\nwhich we seek with the deepest interest from a mind so acute, so\nlogical, and so strenuous. We have indeed much to be grateful\nfor. In dealing with evidence which is at once disparate and\n\f54 [PART\nDr. Walter Leaf.\nvoluminous, the mere arrangement is not the least laborious, as it is\nperhaps the most responsible portion of the writer's task ; and it\nis one for which Myers's special gifts admirably qualified him. The\npatience, the penetration, and the lucidity which he has brought\nto bear on it are above all praise, and his argument is marshalled\nand organised by a master's hand. Only the last deductions are\nleft unfinished, and even here the argument is from the first so\ndirected to a plain end that one can never doubt as to Myers's real\nopinion on any vital matter. Yet one may well hesitate to raise\nobjections to which he may seem to have given too little weight;\none may always fancy that so finished a dialectician had his answers\nin reserve, and might have found them a place in a completed work.\nWe have however a right to remember that, for all his real\ngenius for scientific conceptions, Myers could not really approach\nthis great subject with scientific detachment. He nowhere conceals\nhis overwhelming desire that, in the highest interests of the human\nrace, human personality should be proved to survive bodily death.\nThe burning conviction that he holds in his hands this irrefutable\nproof fires his words with the enthusiasm of the prophet, while his\ndesire to appeal to the reason of his contemporaries often imposes\non him the stern restraint of the scientific treatise. The struggle\nbetween the two impulses is visible on every page of the book,\nand the skill with which they are fused is characteristic and\nadmirable. But if Myers did not attain to detachment, neither\ncan any critic hope to do the same ; the matter is too vital for\nevery man. However surely the evidence be established, it is still\nso dark in interpretation that every one will read in it that which\nhe most wants to read. Let me therefore honestly say at once\nthat I want to find in it something which Myers did not want,\nand that I find it accordingly.\nWith this confession let me express at once the effect which\nMyers's work produces upon me. It greatly weakens my sense of\npersonality, to such an extent that I am rather less than more\nwilling to believe that my personality will survive death, at least\nin any sense which can make such a belief a dominant motive for\nthis life's work. This result is clearly not what Myers would have\nwished; and yet it seems to me to be the natural outcome of all\nhis evidence. I follow him in the greater part at least of what he\nclaims for the \"subliminal Self\" of the living; and then I have\nto ask, \" can this subliminal self be called a part of my personality,\nin any sense in which such a belief will influence my life 1 \" My\n\fXLvl] 55\nReview of Human Personality.\nsubliminal self is something of which I am not conscious. It does not\nappear to be governed exclusively by the moral laws which I take\nas my guide, or by the physical laws which control my body, and,\nthrough my brain, my consciousness. I am barely aware, through\nthe experience of others, of its existence, and know nothing of the\nlaws by which it can affect what I call \"me,\" or \"I\" can affect\nit. It appears, so far as I can learn anything about it, to move\nin another world, which approaches marvellously near to the Infinite or\nthe Absolute or the World Spirit or whatever we like to call it;\nat all events in a region where what we call Personality becomes\nvoid of all meaning.\nPersonality as conceived by the ordinary man\u2014and this is the\nview which, for the present at least, is of real moral significance\u2014\nhas both a positive and a negative aspect. On the one hand it is\nbased fundamentally on the continuous stream of memory, which\ncarries with it too our hopes and aspirations for the future. On the\nnegative side it is equally defined by its limitations\u2014primarily by\nits clear separation from the other similar streams of memory which\nwe conceive as co-existent, and call the personalities of other men.\nNormally we think \" of our personality as limited by our physical\nframe and its capacity for sense impressions, and cut off from other\npersonalities by a line as hard and fast as that which divides our\nbodies from the rest of material nature. It is difficult for a man\nto think of his personality apart from his body; and it is no doubt\nthis difficulty which leads to the conception of what St. Paul calls\nthe \" spiritual body \" of the Resurrection. This spiritual body\nwould I suppose in modern phrase be called a surviving personality,\na boundary, that is, which shall in a future life keep our earthly\nmemories together in a continuous stream with our discarnate\nmemories, free from solution and absorption by any surrounding\nspiritual medium. And it is at any rate the existence of such a\nspiritual body that Myers sets himself to prove.\nAnd yet it seems to me that the whole effect of his book is to\nshake and weaken every property of personality. He sets out with\na striking chapter on Disintegrations of Personality, which at once\nshatters the natural, if somewhat crude idea of a man's self as a\nsingle stream of continuous memory in a single body. The stream\nis not continuous\u2014it is subject to interruptions as capricious as\nthey may be extensive. It is not single, for several streams,\ndistinct and in some cases independent, may exist in the same\nbody during its material life.\n\f56 [part\nDr. Walter Leaf.\nHe then in subsequent chapters goes on to abolish the limitations\nwhich form the other elements in our conception of self. He conceives\na secondary state in which the \"spirit\" can leave the body, and\nnot only travel afar but actually modify spatial relations at a\ndistance, so as to impress the sense-organs of other conscious\npersons. It may enter into their thoughts. It may even be inde\npendent of time, and become precognitive. It can in short take\nupon it some at least of the capacities which we usually associate\nwith the \"Absolute.\" And all of this\u2014most of all the production\nof \" collective hallucinations,\" for which the theory of space-modifica\ntion seems to me to be a rather crude and unsatisfying hypothesis\n\u2014to my mind reduces the notion of personality almost to vanish\ning point. Once more, it seems to take us into a region where\npersonality becomes meaningless, because it loses its limitations, and,\nwith its limitations, its unity.\nAnd if this is the case with the incarnate spirit, how much more\nmust we hesitate before we can ascribe to the discarnate the necessary\nboundaries which are required to constitute a personality. Of the\ndiscarnate spirit we only know for certain that if it does exist, it\nis without the most obvious bond which constituted it a separate\nunity. So far as there can be said to be any probabilities in such\na matter, it would seem probable that the spirit emancipated from\nthe body would extend those powers of the \"secondary self \" which\nappear to us as transcendental, and would enter into closer communion\nwith kindred spirits, till the bounds of personality grew vaguer or\neven vanished.\nThis is however a question of evidence, if evidence can be obtained.\nAnd the ultimate object of Myers's work is to bring forward such\nevidence and interpret it. Let me say first that the evidence\nwhich he brings is relevant and of the highest importance. It\nseems to me to prove much, but not all that he claims. And I\nsay at once that it does seem to me to prove that something of\nus does survive death. It seems to me to show that after the\ndeath of the body there remains a more or less coherent complex\nof memories which is accessible to the subliminal self of certain\nliving persons. What I do not as yet see is that this complex\nhas such coherence as can enable us to consider it a personality,\nor that it is bound up with such continuing vital processes as may\njustify us in holding that life in the spiritual world is continuous\nwith life in this. The evidence seems to point rather to an\nalternative which at least is consistent with analogy, and demands\n\fxlvi.] Review of Human Personality; 57\nto be fully considered\u2014that as the physical body only gradually\ndissolves into its elements after death, so the spiritual retains for\na time a certain coherence which is no proof of life. Under\ncertain circumstances the physical body may be preserved in a\nway which enables us to tell, it may be centuries after, how the\nliving man appeared externally in the world. It is possible that\nthe same may be the case with the spiritual. There may be a\nprocess of dissolution, varying perhaps greatly under conditions of\nwhich we know nothing; and it may be possible for peculiarly\ngifted living spirits to behold the gradually disintegrating spirit,\nand bring us word, with more or less completeness, of what the\nspiritual man was during life.\nEven if we go no farther than this, we have made a gigantic\nstep. At all events the great abyss has been bridged, and with\na foot on the other shore we have the possibilities of unknown\nrealms to explore. Even if we hesitate to follow, we cannot blame\na man like Myers who, with courage and hope, would lead us\ninto the new world. But we must claim for ourselves the right\nto be heard if we carefully examine our first footing before we\ntake a second step.\nIt is practically on the evidence of Mrs. Piper that the whole\ncase is founded. Our reports of her trance-communications are so\nfull that all other evidence sinks unto unimportance compared to\nthem, and can only be regarded as confirmatory and of the second\ndegree. Even the note-books of Stainton Moses, as Myers freely\nadmits, full as they are, do not offer anything like the same\nstrength of testimony. It is then to Mrs. Piper that we must\nturn, and more particularly to the sittings of her second period,\nwhen she was under the control known as \"George Pelham.\"\nLet us see then what are the claims which Myers founds on these.\nThey are so daring and startling that it is best to state them\nin his own words, which are clear and fearless enough.1\n\" The claim then is that the automatist, in the first place, falls\ninto a trance, during which his spirit partially ' quits his body ' ;\u2014\nenters at any rate into a state in which the spiritual world is\nmore or less open to his perception ; and in which also\u2014and this\nis the novelty\u2014it so far ceases to occupy the organism as to\nleave room for an invading spirit to use it in somewhat the same\nfashion as the owner is accustomed to use it.\n\" The brain being thus left temporarily and partially uncontrolled,\n1Vol. n. p. 190.\n\f58 [part\nBr. Walter Leaf.\na disembodied spirit sometimes, but not always, succeeds in occupy\ning it ; and occupies it with varying degrees of control. In some\ncases (Mrs. Piper) two or more spirits may simultaneously control\ndifferent portions of the same organism.\"\nThus we have two distinct hypotheses\u2014first, that the spirit of\nthe sensitive has access, more or less, to the secrets of the in\nvisible world ; and secondly, that other spirits can take possession\nof the vacant organism, and reveal themselves through it, by\nspeech or writing, or both together. What a complication results\nmay be conceived. \" We must continually bear in mind the\nimpossibility of distinguishing the different elements that may enter\ninto so complex a phenomenon. . . . The transparency which\nrenders the one possession possible facilitates also the other. This\nmay be one reason for the admixture seen in most trance-utterances\u2014\nof elements which come from the sensitive's own mind with elements\ninspired from without. . . . Further, we cannot draw a clear line\nbetween the influence of the organism itself\u2014as already moulded\nby its own indwelling spirit\u2014and the continuing influence of\nthat spirit, not altogether separated from the organism. . . . The\nresult may be a kind of mixed telepathy between the sitter, the\nsensitive's spirit, and the extraneous spirit.\"1\nLet us see if, for this appalling complication, we cannot substitute\na theory more consistent with facts ahead}' observed, and simple\nenough to allow of some hope of interpretation. Let us then admit\nthat Mrs. Piper passes into a secondary state in which her power\nof perception of the spiritual world is largely increased. Let us now\nsuppose that in this spiritual world her secondary self finds memory\ngroups surviving\u2014possibly undergoing the process of dissolution, but\nstill surviving and retaining a certain amount of coherence, and thus\nrepresenting with more or less completeness the inner life of known\npersons who have passed away. Will not the known tendency of\nher secondary self to dramatic presentation lead to such communica\ntions as those which have been so fully and so carefully reported ?\nThis question is in fact forced upon us by the principle of con\ntinuity which Myers rightly takes as his guide, and which is\nnotably exemplified in the development of Mrs. Piper herself. Her\nfirst control, as we all know, was \"Dr. Phinuit.\" Myers still clings\nto the belief that Phinuit may possibly be regarded \"as an intelli\ngence extraneous to Mrs. Piper\u2014as in fact a discarnate spirit.\"2\nBut he is conscious of the enormous difficulties in the way of such\n1VoL ii. p. 249. 'Vol. ii. p. 240.\n\fxlvl] Review of Human Personality. 59\na belief, in view of Phinuit's untrue, and indeed absurd, statements\nrespecting his life on earth ; and he admits that \" many may think\nit most probable that the Phinuit control was nothing more than a\nsecondary personality of Mrs. Piper.\" This is in fact the only theory\nwhich, at least in the present state of our knowledge, we have any\nright to hold.\nIn her third stage Mrs. Piper is controlled by \"Imperator,\"\n\"Rector,\" and others, who profess to have been when on earth\ncertain illustrious, but not divine personages. They profess also to\nbe identical with Stainton Moses' controls, who gave their real\nnames to him ; these were never published, but were known to\nMyers himself. It was therefore an obvious test that they should\ngive through Mrs. Piper the names which they had given to Stainton\nMoses. This simple test they completely failed to fulfil.1 Thus in\nthe third stage the evidence for external personality breaks down as\nit did in the first. If Imperator and his assistants are really dis-\ncarnate personalities, they are lying spirits. But in the meantime\nwe are bound to regard them as further dramatis personae of Mrs.\nPiper's fertile subliminal self.\nThere remains her second period, when she was under the control\nof \"George Pelham,\" who claimed to be the spirit of a known\nperson recently deceased. We notice the progressive advance from\nthe vulgar \"Phinuit,\" through the cultivated \"G.P.\" to the exalted\n\" Imperator \" ; and if we are to follow any principle of continuity,\nwe must not assume for \" G.P.\" any different origin from the\nother two. The evidence may possibly be overwhelming enough\nto force us to do so ; but then we must abandon the principle of\ncontinuity.\nIs then the evidence so overwhelming ? Is it enough to force us\nto acknowledge that the controls of the second period are what\nthey profess to be\u2014the still living spirits of those who have recently\npassed away, and are making themselves known to their friends on\nearth ? I have already indicated my own answer to this question.\nThe evidence is very striking and very strong. It proves, I think,\nthat memories of the dead survive, and are under special con\nditions accessible to us. But I do not see that it proves the\nsurvival of what we call the living spirit, the personality\u2014a unit of\nconsciousness, limited and self-contained, a centre of will and vital\nforce, carrying on into another world the aspirations and the affec\ntions of this.\n1 Proceedings, Vol. im., pp. 408-9.\n\f60 [part\nDr. Walter Leaf.\nThose who took part in Mrs. Piper's earlier sittings came gene\nrally to the conclusion that she had by some subliminal faculty\naccess to a store of memories belonging to the sitters and their\nfriends, but not consciously present in their minds. As some one\nthen put it, the effect was as though she had been able to rummage\nthrough a waste-paper basket full of their old letters, often\ntorn and blurred, containing much that was unintelligible, but often\naffording an unmistakable, though forgotten, piece of fact. The main\n\u25a0question for us in 1890 was whether these broken memories belonged\nonly to the living, or whether there was not some similar store\nhouse for the dead as well. The result of the later evidence seems\nto me to be that we must now accept the latter proposition as true.\nFurther than this I do not think that it carries us.\nA full discussion of the \" G.P.\" communications would mean a\nreview of Hodgson's and Hyslop's reports, rather than of Human\nPersonality. But no reader of them can have failed to be struck\nby their fragmentary, obscure and generally muddled character.\nProfessor Hyslop speaks frankly of the \"discarnate spirit,\" as\n\" exhibiting various degrees of clearness and confusion, merging now\nand then into delirium, automatism, or complete syncope.\"1 No\nbetter illustration of this can be found than the ingenious series\nof experiments by which he illustrates the nature of the communica\ntions by telegraphic messages between living persons.2 These clearly\nshow, by the artificial restrictions required, how far the spirits\nfall below the intelligence of the normal rational man.\nThis undeniable and puzzling confusion is explained by Myers as\ndue to the novel conditions under which a mind is using a brain\nwhich does not belong to it.3 Such a supposition hardly seems\nto meet the case. The most obvious puzzle is that the communicating\nspirits seem to have the greatest difficulty in getting at what\nshould be the primary means of identification \u2014their own names.\nThis is hard to understand if the difficulty is one of means of\ncommunication only ; it clearly points to some imperfect com\nprehension at the origin of the message. It becomes intelligible\nenough on the alternate hypothesis, that the messages are in fact\nbeing given at second hand. If we imagine ourselves as endeavour\ning to construct a dramatic presentation of a human being from\nwhat we can find in an old diary belonging to him, we see at\nonce that his own name might be one of the hardest things to\n1 Proceedings, Vol. xvi. p. 284. 2 Ibid. pp. 537-623.\n3 Vol. II. p. 254.\n\fXLvi.] 61\nReview of Human Personality.\nmake out. And I conceive that the secondary personality of Mrs.\nPiper may be in somewhat the same position\u2014having access to a\ncluster of earthly memories where the name of the owner is not\nexplicitly presented, and must be slowly extricated, not by the\nagency of the owner himself, but by a process of inference\u2014\nlargely aided, no doubt, by the recipients of the communications.\nAnd further, the general mental attitude of the communicants\nseems distinctly to point to the cluster of memories as disinte\ngrating\u2014full of the gaps and vaguenesses which we should expect\nto find as the forerunners of ultimate dissolution.\nThat is the conclusion to which Human Personality has brought\nme. Myers himself would, I fear, have regarded it as a complete\nnegation of his hopes, and a practical rejection of his life's work.\nTo me it is not so. To me \" personality \" presents itself mainly as\na limitation\u2014as the barrier which inexorably cuts me off from those\nwho are nearest and dearest to me, so that they can never \"know\nhalf the reasons why I smile or sigh.\" To a large part of the\nhuman race personality means something crippled by surroundings,\nor smirched with sin, or distorted by hereditary taint, as it seems\nto us, beyond hope of cure. It is a hope and not a fear that the\ndissolution of the body may mean the dissolution of this spiritual\ncrust as well; that one day the infinite which is within us all may\nhave freer play, and mingle in unconstrained communion with other\nspiritual elements equally purged of earthly dross, through channels\ninfinitely clearer and more translucent than the imperfect and un\nsatisfying organs of the mortal frame.\nAnd this hope Myers, by the life's work which he has summed up\nin Human Personality, has enormously strengthened. He has shown\nthat even in this life we have, through the subliminal self, a contact\nwith the infinite which is more than a mere guess\u2014that however\nimperfectly and sporadically, man has glimpses of a faculty trans\ncending the powers of sense. And he has carried the link across\nthe grave. This is after all the great step, beside which the rest\nsinks into insignificance. When once that is taken, anything else\nmay follow. Myers's further conclusions may prove in the end to be\nright; or man may through the ages work out a scheme of the\nspiritual world as far transcending Myers as Myers transcends the\nHottentot. But this will not one whit diminish the debt we owe\nto him. Walter Leaf.\n\f62 [part\nAndrew Lang.\n\"THE NINETEENTH CENTURY\" AND MR. FREDERIC\nMYERS.\nBy Andrew Lang.\nIn The Nineteenth Century\u2014and After, for April 1903, appeared two\narticles on Human Personality, the book by Mr. Frederic Myers.\nAt a Highland inn, being destitute of more serious literature, I read\nthese essays. It did not appear to me that they were quite worthy\nof the genius of our leading Comteist, Mr. Frederic Harrison ; and\nof one of our most eminent scientific men, theologians, and investiga\ntors of Mrs. Gallup, Mr. W. H. Mallock. The essay of Mr. Harrison\nwas a sportive apologue. Free, as he is, from degrading supersti\ntion, Mr. Harrison playfully informed the town that, after \"dipping\ninto \" Mr. Myers's book for about ninety minutes, he dreamed\nthat he died, after an apoplectic seizure. Absit omen ! Mr.\nHarrison must be cautious as to what he reads, avoiding what he\ndisagrees with. He then described his posthumous adventures.\nWhile remaining Mr. Frederic Harrison, he felt great difficulty in\nretaining a firm hold of his consciousness of personal existence. The\nAurora Borealis and (I think) other cosmic phenomena, sniggered at\nhis efforts, and Mr. Harrison found himself tittering in sympathy.\n\" Was I even a Gas, or a Force ? \" Mr. Harrison asked himself with\nnatural anxiety. We are not concerned to answer these queries,\nnor to decide whether Mr. Harrison was a Force, or merely a Gas,\nnor even whether a Gas is a Force, as the domestic meter may\nseem to suggest. \"Was not my dream,\" he exclaims complacently,\n\" infinitely more sublime, more beautiful, more wonderful, than\nthat of any S.P.R. ? \"\nWho can reply 1 No S.P.R. known to us has any vision of its\nown ; we cannot compare such a non-existent dream with the Somnia\nPythagorea of Mr. Harrison, when he asked himself whether he was\nnot, perhaps, a Gas, or a Force, perhaps.\nThe apologue of Mr. Harrison, composed after \"dipping into\" a\nbook by Mr. Myers, a man of not inconsiderable intellect and\n\fxlvi.] \" The Nineteenth Century\" and Mr. Myers. 63\nindustry, seemed an odd apparition, and a trifle out-of-date, in the\nNineteenth Century\u2014and After. After the Nineteenth Century, are we\nto be discussing Mr. Harrison's taste in dreams?\nHaving read the badinage of Mr. Harrison, I turned to the more\nsolid arguments of Mr. Mallock. Now I find him deep in the\nornamental title-pages of books of the Elizabethan age, looking for\nemblems of the Hanged Hog (or Bacon), and encountering\nthe Porcupine, collared and fettered Or, which, I learn, was the\ncrest of Sir Philip Sidney. Again he is in the forefront of\nthe science of our time, instructing the veteran Lord Kelvin,\nwho appears to require some hints as to the Suction of the\nCosmic Egg. Next Mr. Mallock reveals to the reading public\nthe Doctrine of Mrs. Gallup, and examines a Baconian cypher\nwith the acumen of a Poe or a Phellips ; and anon he dazzles, or\nadmonishes, as the novelist of Society. It was to be expected that\nsuch a man would have taken Psychical Research, like all the rest\nof knowledge, for his province ; while a tie yet more endearing\nseemed to exist between the sympathies of Mr. Mallock and those\nof Mr. Myers. Among the fair and intellectual daughters of\nColumbia there are two whose claims to distinction are not freely\naccepted by the wise and learned. One, Mrs. Gallup, has discovered\nthat Bacon wrote most of Elizabethan literature and did into prose part\nof Pope's translation of the Iliad. She has unriddled the cypher in\nwhich Bacon not only reveals his literary secret, but displays an engag\ning ignorance of history, law, and even of his own family circle. In\nthe most chivalrous manner, and with a mind truly open, Mr.\nMallock advocated the desirableness of studying Mrs. Gallup's system,\nthough, to the pedantic specialist, it seems to be demonstrably con\nspicuous nonsense. Mr. Myers was an even more ardent believer\nin those claims to communicate with the dead, which Mrs. Piper, of\nBoston, U.S. (as I understand), does not make, the lady leaving the\nquestion to be settled by the learned.\nNobody can believe everything, and it was too much to expect\nthat an investigator of Mrs. Gallup should also be a student of Mrs.\nPiper. Still, one thought that Mr. Mallock would sympathize with\nMr. Myers. He does not, and he even attributes intellectual dis\nhonesty to that writer. This is an antiquated method in con\ntroversy, and I do not dispute the intellectual honesty of Mr.\nMallock. Heaven forbid ! Still, when I read his article it appeared\nto me that he had not perused his author very carefully, and that\nhe first attributed to Mr. Myers, and then refuted, certain ideas which\n\f64 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nMr. Myers did not, in my opinion, entertain : a practice very\ncommon among critics.\nI therefore wrote to the editor of the Nineteenth Century\u2014 and After,\nsaying that if no stronger champion were in the field I would\ngladly cross swords with Mr. Mallock. As the editor had given\nplenty of room to a discussion about Bacon's claim to the throne\nof England, and to the authorship of Shakespeare's plays, I deemed\nthat he might spare a few pages to my attempt to expiscate Mr.\nMyers's ideas. The editor consented ; two or three letters passed\nbetween us. I sent in the following paper, and he rejected it\nalmost by return of post. I then asked whether I might publish\nhis letters with my paper, and he,\u2014I think not unnaturally,\u2014refused\nhis permission. About the contents of these letters my lips are\nsealed. The S.P.R., however, will observe that the labour of\nhalf the lifetime of a learned and industrious man appears to be\ndeemed less worthy of discussion than the cypher of Mrs. Gallup.\nBut the fault may be my own ; my paper may be unworthy of\nthe topic about which I treat, and I make no claims to the scientific\neminence of Mr. Mallock, though conceivably I know as much as\nhe does about psychical research. The rejected paper follows, with\nonly verbal alterations.\nIn trying to review Mr. Mallock's review of Human Personality by\nthe late Mr. Frederic Myers, I attempt a task difficult and ungrate\nful. It is ungrateful because I wish that Mr. Myers had left theories,\nespecially metaphysical and \" metetherial \" theories, out of his work;\nand it is difficult, because I am not at all certain that the theories\nare understood either by Mr. Mallock or by myself. Indeed, if the\ntheories are bad, they are perhaps a good deal worse than Mr.\nMallock has proved them to be. It is also my misfortune to regard\nmetaphysics with the extreme distrust and dislike which the general\npublic, and most men of science, freely bestow on \" Metapsychics.\"\nBut if I am no psychologist or metaphysician, as Mr. Mallock is,\nProfessor William James is a psychologist of acknowledged eminence.\nIt is, therefore, worth remarking that while Mr. Mallock regards\nMr. Myers's theory \" as being not only fantastic in respect of its\ngeneral character, but also as gratuitously inapplicable to the facts\nwhich he invokes it to explain,\" Professor Jamec, without actually\naccepting the theory, treats it in a much more respectful manner.\nHe does not like the terms \"supraliminal\" and \"subliminal,\" and\nMr. Myers himself gave us alternatives, \" extra-marginal \" and \" intra\n\fxlvi.] \" The Nineteenth Century\" and Mr. Myers. 65\nmarginal,\" which seem less open to objection. But Mr. James, like\nMr. Myers himself, regards the theory as a mere provisional pioneer\ning hypothesis. Mr. Myers says that he does not \" claim to attain to a\nscientific standard.\" If a science he has, it is \" in its dim and poor\nbeginnings,\" as chemistry was \" when a few monks groped among\nthe properties of the nobler metals.\" (Vol. I., p. 2.) Professor James\nsays that Mr. Myers took \" a lot of scattered phenomena ... he\nmade series of them, filled in the transitions by delicate hypotheses\nor analogies, and bound them together in a system by his bold\ninclusive conception of the Subliminal Self. . . . What is the precise\nconstitution of the Subliminal ? Such is the problem which deserves\nto figure in our Science hereafter as the problem of Myers,\" who\nhas also added, says Professor James, not without levity, \"many\nways of putting the Subliminal on tap.\"1 Sir Oliver Lodge also\nclaims for Myers that \"he has laid a foundation ... on ground\nmore solid than has ever been available before,\" 2 which is not saying\nmuch !\nIf we listen to these eminent men of science, Mr. Myers's effort\ncan scarcely be so \" fantastic,\" and \" gratuitously inapplicable to the\nfacts which he invokes it to explain,\" as Mr. Mallock avers. Au\nthority, to be sure, goes for very little in such matters; still the\nopinions of two specialists in psychology and other sciences cannot\nwholly be disdained. \" Analogies \" and \" delicate hypotheses \" are,\nas a rule, worth very little (despite Mr. Mallock's own use of them),\nand Mr. Myers was clearly aware of the fact. He was groping in\nwhat he calls \"the Subliminal,\" as Friar Bacon may have groped in\n\"the nobler qualities of metals.\" He was guessing with a purpose,\nnamely to form a kind of thread on which to string series of facts,\nor of what he believed to be facts. The question is not so much\nwhether he solved \"Myers's problem,\" but whether he stated his\nproblem without too much of the inconsistency and self-contradiction\nwhich almost invariably beset the makers of \" delicate hypotheses,\"\neven in such fields as anthropology and history. But if Mr. Myers's\ntheory turns out to be self-contradictory and fantastic, that does not\ndamage the value of his great collection of facts, any more than Mr.\nFrazer's chain of hypotheses, if here and there to some critics un\nacceptable, injures the merit of the vast collections in his Golden Bough.\nMr. Mallock writes : \" Mr. Myers asserts that the subliminal self\nis not the unconscious part of the supraliminal, but is a separate\nProceedings S.P.S., Vol. XVII., pp. 15-18.\n*Op. cit., Vol. XVII., p. 4.\nE\n\f66 [pakt\nAndrew Lang.\nconscious entity, and that the supraliminal is a separate entity also.\nThe latter is as mortal and as dependent on the physical organism\nas any man of science can say it is ; but the former stands on a\ntotally different footing. The organism depends on it, not it on the\norganism, and for it alone Mr. Myers claims immortality\" (p. 629).\nDoes Mr. Myers really mean, or say, all this 1 1 He writes \" I do\nnot . . . assume that there are two correlative and parallel selves\nexisting always within each of us. Rather I mean by the subliminal\nSelf that part of the Self which is commonly subliminal.\" (Vol. I.,\np. 15.) What is \"a Self,\" and what is meant by \"a part of a\nSelf\"? I have no clear idea: such phrases seem mere counters\nrepresenting notions of no fixed value. But here Mr. Myers certainly\ndoes not speak of \"two separate conscious entities,\" one mortal, the\nother immortal. He denies that he makes the assumption which Mr.\nMailock attributes to him. But he goes on to say that \" no Self of\nwhich we can here have cognisance is in reality more than a frag\nment of a larger Self,-\u2014revealed in a fashion at once shifting and\nlimited through an organisation not so framed as to afford it full\nmanifestation.\"\nAll this does not agree with Mr. Mallock's statement of Mr. Myers's\ntheory. Mr. Myers is not saying that we know here two separate\nconscious entities or selves, one deathly, one exempt from death.\nHe says that we know no such entities, but merely have glimpses\nof fragments of \"a larger Self\" which we cannot know. That larger\nSelf, I take it, is not the Subliminal Self, as more or less known to\nscience. If we cannot possibly know it, perhaps the less we say about\nit the better; however, man is a guess-making animal.\n1Mr. Myers, in a footnote (Vol. I., p. 14) writes: \"We may attempt, indeed,\ndeeper distinctions, and speak of the empirical self on the one hand, and the sur\nviving or the transcendental self on the other hand.\" But he does not say\nthat the surviving self is exclusive of the empirical self, and he constantly\ngives examples of the alleged survival of the empirical self in the alleged\nsurviving self. In Vol. I., p. 12, he writes: \"The 'conscious self of each of\nus, as we call it,\u2014the empirical, the supraliminal self, as I should prefer to say\u2014\ndoes not comprise the whole of the consciousness or of the faculty within us.\nThere exists a more comprehensive consciousness, a profounder faculty, which\nfor the most part remains potential only so far as regards the life of earth,\nbutfrom which the consciousness and the faculty of earth-life are mere selections,\nand which reasserts itself in its plenitude after the liberating change of death.\"\nThe \"supraliminal\" is a \"mere selection\" from the \"subliminal.\" The passage\nquoted demonstrates that Mr. Mallock has misconceived, and therefore mis\nstated Mr. Myers's theory, and, I repeat, he gave no references for his\naverments on this important head.\n\fxlvi.] \" The Nineteenth Century \" and Mr. Myers. 67\nAs Mr. Myers denies that he believes in \" two separate conscious\nentities\" in each man, and denies that in this world we know the\nwhole of any Self whatever, one argument of Mr. Mallock's seems of\ndoubtful validity. It is a telling argument, as it stands. \"The\nsupposed subliminal self,\" he says, \" as operated on by the hypnotiser,\ninstead of exhibiting any special independence or superiority, dis\ntinguishes itself mainly by its docile and credulous slavery to the\nsuggestions of any chance operator. It is tricked by statements\nwhich would hardly deceive an idiot\" (p. 638).\nIndeed I understand that idiots, of all people, are least amenable\nto the hypnotist.\nMr. Mallock goes on to say that, according to Mr. Myers, this\nultra-idiotic subliminal self \"will do almost anything that the\nhypnotiser tells it to do, except what is morally wrong. Here it\nshows its innate spiritual purity. ...\"\nIf Mr. Myers really means all this, he has clearly lost hold of\nhis own theory. For his theory is that in no way can we, while\n\"here,\" get knowledge of the whole of \"the larger self,\" or even\nof any other self : we cannot, therefore, disengage by hypnotism\nthe whole of the subliminal self. Consequently \" the hypnotic\nstratum,\" as Mr. Myers calls it, which is so easily \" tricked \" by\nthe operator, is not all the \"larger,\" or even \"the subliminal self.\"\nThat self, b}' Mr. Myers's definition, it cannot be. The self mani\nfested in the hypnotic condition is not the subliminal self, or the\nsoul, or the immortal somewhat, neat, for we can never get it\nneat ! It is only one \" fragment \" (or aspect, or faculty, as I should\nprefer to say) of a larger self, \"revealed in a fashion at once\nshifting and limited.\" This being so, and the hypnotic self being,\nin Mr. Myers's opinion, on the moral level of the workaday self,\nMr. Mallock says \" it is hard to imagine a clearer admission than\nthis, that the two selves are the same self in different conditions,\nand not, as Mr. Myers imagines, two independent beings.\"\nBut Mr. Myers has denied that he conceives any two selves\nknown to, or knowable by, us, here, as \"two independent beings.\"\nI have never understood him, as Mr. Mallock does\u2014apparently\u2014\nto hold that, when observing a patient in any hypnotic stage\nwhatever, we observe the \"supposed subliminal self\" at work as\n\"an independent being,\" in full untrammelled power. I understand\nhim to mean that a fragment or a potentiality of a self is, in the\nhypnotic state, able to exert itself in different degrees,\u2014degrees\n\"shifting and limited,\"\u2014upon our organisms. That self is able,\n\f68 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nmore or less, to trick the body into supposing that soap is chocolate,\nfor example, or into raising a blister where a postage stamp has\nbeen applied to the skin. Therein lies all of its \"supposed inde\npendence or superiority,\" as far as evinced in certain hypnotic\nstages.1 In other cases it appears sometimes to control the tendency\nto drink, for example. For all that I know, perhaps a sober man\nmay be capable of conversion into a drunkard, by suggestion. Mr.\nMyers seems to think not, but I am unaware that the experiment\nhas been tried. Whether improvements of conduct under sugges\ntion are without \" moral value \" (as in Mr. Mallock's view) I do\nnot know ; but, even if non-moral, such improvements would be\npractically welcome. If, indeed, there is no Free Will (as I under\nstand Mr. Mallock to argue, but I may misunderstand him), I don't\nsee where morality comes in, anyhow, but that is a question which\ndoes not interest me.\nSo far, I really conceive that Mr. Mallock may have glided into\nan ignoratio elenchi. Mr. Myers does not hold (I take it) that we\nliving men know, or can know, two separate conscious entities,\none of which is immortal : nor does Mr. Myers think that this\nsuperior entity is known by us completely, or is fully on view, in\npatients under hypnotism. That were absurd. Mr. Myers does\nnot, I repeat, maintain that in hypnotism or any other condition,\n' do we get at the full-blown subliminal self, or at the \" larger\nself.\"\nIf the subliminal self, as known in hypnotism, is in one aspect\nrather an ass, it is much worse, Mr. Myers shows, in various\nautomatisms. Planchette, and a table (in table-tilting), are often\nsilly, occasionally profane or obscene, more rarely are credited with\nknowledge not normally acquired. As a rule, the rubbish of the\nsubliminal stratum comes to the top in automatic writing. We get\nsubliminal nonsense, or chaff, or profanity ; as well as subliminal\nsagacity, just as in dreams we get nonsense, usually ; clairvoyance\nvery seldom, even on Mr. Myers's showing. The reason is that\nthe subliminal self, as hnowable by us here, is not \" a separate conscious\nentity \" of a vastly superior character, but is only a flickering set\nof glimpses of all kinds, from idiocy to inspiration. At least I\nhave always understood Mr. Myers in this sense, while taking him\nto mean that, in the inspired sorts of glimpses, we may detect\nbrief fragmentary visions of his \" larger self.\"\n1 In other stages and conditions other powere are supposed to be displayed.\nBut it is not supposed that the subliminal self is \"all there\" at large.\n\fxlvi.] \" The Nineteenth Century \" and Mr. Myers. 69\nOn another point the critic seems to me to misunderstand his\nauthor. \"For it alone,\" says Mr. Mallock (meaning his \"superior\nconscious entity\"), \"Mr. Myers claims immortality.\" It appears\nmore accurate to say that he claims for \"the larger self\" per\nsistence or survival, after death. Immortality is another matter.\nBut does Mr. Myers say that the supraliminal ordinary self\u2014the\ninferior of Mr. Mallock's pair of conscious entities\u2014is mortal, or\nis extinguished by death 1 Mr. Mallock avers that he does : if\nhe does, Mr. Myers rejects much of what he himself accepts as\nevidence. The only supraliminal \"self\" that can be conceived of\nas surviving death is the continuous chain of human memories and\nassociations. Now if these do not survive, immortality had no\ninterest for Mr. Myers. He wanted to renew his old friendships,\nvelerum hand immemor amorum. His phantasms of the dead mani\nfestly remember their earthly homes, friends, and kinships, so do\nhis spirits which talk through Mrs. Piper & Co., though they\nhave forgotten any Greek they ever had to an astonishing degree.\n\"G.P.,\" that famed spirit, \"felt bad in his head\"; a thoroughly\nsupraliminal sensation, just as a man whose leg has been amputated\nfeels pain in that leg. All these memories\u2014all things, in fact,\nthat Mr. Myers's spirits do or say\u2014are survivals of the supra\nliminal consciousness. How, then, can Mr. Mallock aver that,\nin Mr. Myers's theory, the supraliminal self is independent,\nand is mortal ? If Mr. Myers has said so, he is not worth\nthinking about at all : he is to be placed far below the rather\nhumble level assigned to him as a reasoner by Mr. Mallock. The\ncommon phantasm of the dead, in Mr. Myers's opinion, is \"not\nall there \" ; the soul of the dead man is not wholly occupied, like\nthe spectral minister of the Kirk, in tramping round the country\nnear Lessudden (Vol. II., pp. 396, 397). Only a casual side-stream of\nhis consciousness is occupied with Tweed-side, but that side-stream\nis as supraliminal as trout. Thus the supraliminal self must survive,\ndespite Mr. Mallock, in the theory of Mr. Myers. If it did not,\nthe personality of each of us could not survive at all, to the joy\nof Mr. Frederic Harrison.\nMr. Mallock remarks that Mr. Myers, in his chapter on Sleep,\n\"insists again that the subliminal self is a separate self-existing\npersonality \" (p. 630). If so, Mr. Myers contradicts himself, for he has\nwritten \"I find it permissible and convenient to speak of subliminal\nselves, or of a subliminal self. ... I mean by the subliminal self\nth\/it part of the self which is commonly subliminal,\" being no more\n\f70 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nthan \"a fragment of a larger self.\" Now, unlike Mr. Mallock, I\ncannot find in Mr. Myers's chapter on Sleep any statement that the\nsubliminal self is \" a separate self-existing personality.\" An exact\nreference to this statement is not given by Mr. Mallock, nor can I\nfind the passage. I do find Mr. Myers saying that \" we shall have\ntwo phases of personality developing into separate purposes and separate\ndirections from a parent stew,\" \" the waking personality,\" and \" the\nsleeping personality\" (Vol. I., pp. 151-152). It is true that, elsewhere\nin this passage, Mr. Myers speaks of \" the soul,\" but I do not\nunderstand him to mean that \" the soul \" is identical with the\nsubliminal self, as known to us.\nBut what especially puzzles me is that Mr. Mallock, after\nasserting that Mr. Myers insists that \"the subliminal self is a\nseparate, self-existing personality,\" offers the references which he\ndoes give to \"the classes of facts which prove this most con\nclusively.\" They are \"Sections 413 and 421 A\" (Vol. I., p. 130,\np. 379). In one of these cases a woman remembers in sleep events\nproductive of a mental shock, which she does not remember when\nawake. In the other case a man discovers in a dream the place\nwhere a friend has dropped a watch. Mr. Myers conjectures that\nthe loser's \"subliminal self\" saw the watch fall, which merely means\nthat consciousness of the incident did not also present itself to the\nloser's ordinary mind; such cases are common, the correct memory\narising later in a dream. In this instance the loser's subliminal\nself may have wired on the fact to the friend by telepathy, or,\nsays Mr. Myers, there may be another explanation. I do not see,\nas Mr. Mallock does, that Mr. Myers here asserts that the sub\nliminal self is \"a separate self-existing personality,\" any more than\nany psychologist does when he speaks of the \"separate\" or\n\"secondary personalities\" of hysterical patients, FeUida or HeUene\nSmith. These are not conceived of as \"self-existing entities,\" but\nas mere phases of the personality of F\u00e9lida or of Hellene.\nTo me it appears that matters of terminology cause the mis\napprehensions of Mr. Myers's meaning which are entertained either\nby Mr. Mallock or by myself. I do not conceive Mr. Myers to\nmean that \"soul\" and \"subliminal self\" are synonymous terms.\nMr. Mallock speaks of \"the subliminal soul,\" which appears to\nimply the existence (in Mr. Myers's theory) of a supraliminal soul,\nbut did Mr. Myers ever speak of a supraliminal soul 1 In his\nGlossary, to my chagrin, \" soul \" does not appear, nor does \" spirit.\"\nBut (Vol. I., p. 119) \"soul\" seems to mean something in man, to\n\fxlvi.] \" The Nineteenth Century \" and Mr. Myers. 7 1\nwhich a spirit in the universe is, for purposes of argument,\nassumed to be \"accessible and responsive,\" and soul or spirit, or\nboth, are active in vision, \"hypnotic rejuvenation,\" automatisms, and\nso forth. But \" soul \" is not identical, as I understand my author,\nwith \" subliminal self,\" as known to us.\nNeither Mr. Mallock nor myself is much to be blamed if ono or\nboth of us misapprehend Mr. Myers's meaning. For my part I\nthink that he meant \"soul is not absent from the constitution of the\nsubliminal self, as ether is not absent from the constitution of\napple dumpling. But apple dumpling is not ether, and the\nsubliminal self is not the soul.\" That is, the subliminal self, as at\npresent known to psychologists, is not the soul, which, to us here,\nis not knowable.\nThe general reader will not study Mr. Myers's book, but he has\nperused Mr. Mallock's article. I am anxious that the authority of\nso great a philosophic name should not (without further examina\ntion) convince the general reader that Mr. Myers was so abjectly\nmuddle-headed as Mr. Mallock would induce us to believe. If the\ngeneral reader has favoured me with his esteemed attention so far,\nI hope that he will feel so hopelessly perplexed that he will try to\nhammer out Mr. Myers's meaning for himself, or will dismiss the\nsubject from his meditations altogether, which I take to be\nhis better course. Into Mr. Mallock's criticism of Mr. Myers's\n\" synthesis \" I cannot pretend to go. I do not profess to under\nstand why, if \"ether\" is \"material,\" \"metether\"1 should be\n\"spiritual\" (Vol. I., p. 215). The whole thing merely comes\nto this, that Mr. Myers believed in spirit as well as matter, and\nthat most men of science (but not all) do not. The words\n\" matter \" and \" spirit \" seem to me but cheques drawn on an airy\ncapital without metallic basis. But I do not think, as Mr. Mallock\ndoes, that Mr. Myers \"juggled with his own convictions,\" or was\n\"dishonest\" when he wrote \" metetherial \" in place of \" metetheric.\"\nI take no sense of difference between the two new words. It is as\nabsurd, I think, to talk of the \"metetherial\" as of the \"metetheric\ngrace of God.\" Both phrases are absurd. To myself Mr. Myers\nappeared unusually honest; one could, and I think that I actually\ndid, shake or destroy his belief in a case, for example, of supposed\n1\"Metetheric\" apparently includes the meaning, \"not etheric,\" as \"meta\nphysics\" includes the meaning, \"not physics.\" Like Mr. Mallock I suppose\nthe ether (if it exists) to be material, but I must disclaim all knowledge\nabout ether, matter, and spirit.\n\f72 [part\nAndrew Lang.\ncommunication from a spirit, to which he had attached considerable\nvalue. I also notice that the most extraordinary of modern\n\" ghost stories,\" which appeared in Mr. Myers's work in the\nProceedings of the S.P.R., is not included in his book.1 Perhaps\nhe saw reason to distrust this narrative. He was always ready,\nbeyond most writers whom I have known, to accept criticism with\ncandour and good humour.\nMr. Matlock, preoccupied with Mr. Myers's theory, does not\ncriticise his alleged \"facts\" with any fulness. The facts, not Mr.\nMyers's interpretations of them, are to my mind the important part\nof the book. For example, Mr. Mallock mentions various categories\nof waking hallucinations of the sane and healthy. Some cases, as\nMr. Myers quotes Mr. Gurney (and Mr. Mallock quotes Mr.\nLawrence Oliphant) might be (rather fancifully) ascribed to move\nments leaving \" some impress \" on things in general \" like the\nlines in which the voice records itself on the moving disc of a\nphonograph,\" and the person, perhaps long dead, who caused the\noriginal movement, might \"be reproduced in the consciousness of\npersons sufficiently sensitive.\" This would imply no survival of the\naforesaid person, any more than a dead man's voice, echoed from a\nphonograph, would prove his survival.\nMr. Mallock says \"the majority of ghosts can perhaps be disposed\nof in these ways, without the necessity of iuvoking any theory\nwhich does not accord in character with current scientific concep\ntions.\" But that things at large are phonographs and spectrographs,\n(as if the road, trees, hedges, and so on at Lessudden retained and\nreproduced, for Miss Scott of Lessudden and others, the spectre of\na dead minister on his \"daidling bit,2\") is not \"a current scientific\nconception,\" surely ! -Moreover the phantasms of the dead (on the\nevidence), usually \" take notice \" (like babies) of attempts to approach\nthem. The spook of the minister, pursued by Miss M. W. Scott,\n\" turned round and faced her,\" twice (Vol. II., p. 397). As I know\nthe lady and the place, the adventure interests me, and such cases\nare not infrequent, if I ma}' trust persons of honour and distinction\nwho have been \" percipients.\" Now mere spectrograph^ reflections\nwould not give these signs of consciousness. However, my point is\nthat, if science did entertain this spectrographic theory, then science\nwould not merely deny and say \"pooh!\" to \"ghost stories,\" but\nwould admit the facts (if well attested), having secured an expla\nnation. In the same humour, Mr. Mallock does not reject, en masse<\n1 Proceedings, Vol. XI., pp. 547-554. 2 Sauntering spot.\n\fXLvi.] 73\n\" The Nineteenth Century \" and Mr. Myers.\nMr. Myers's fieath-wraiths, and other hallucinations, nor dispose of\nthem by the cheap theory of \"It happened to be B's hour to see\na hallucination of A, when it happened to be A's hour to die \" He\ndoes not reject them, but says, \"had Mr. Myers only lived to see\nthe development of wireless telegraphy, he would have realised how\nunnecessary and how childish was the spiritualistic hypothesis\nwhereby he seeks to explain the fact that a telepathic message is\ncapable of being conveyed to several recipients simultaneously.\"\nMr. Myers. died in January, 1901, and, in April, 1901, I ventured\nto begin a romance of wireless telegraphy. The topic was not\nrevealed to man between January and April, 1901. Mr. Myers's\ncomments ou Sir William Crookes's suggestion of a theory by which\ntelepathy is propagated by \" ether-waves of even smaller amplitude\nand greater frequency than those which carry the X rays,\" are\nquite as germane to the matter as the latest exploits of Mr. Marconi.\nAny one can read Mr. Myers's objections to Sir William Crookes's\nsuggestion (Vol. I., pp. 245, 246). To me they appear telling, though\nI have no theory, especially no \" spiritualistic \" theory, of my own.\nIt does seem clear that, if we accept any of Mr. Myers's cases\neither of \" precognition,\" or of phantasms of the dead of a departed\ngeneration, the phenomena cannot be explained by the widest\nlicence of an assumption based on the analogy of wireless telegraphy,\nand postulating similar \"waves\" from living brain to living brain.\n\"An etheric telepathy, and other cognate perceptions of distant\nthings\" (distant in space, Mr. Mallock probably means), is a hypo\nthesis which cannot explain, (even if it state a vera causa, about\nwhich we know nothing), the classes of phenomena to which I\nallude The hypothesis rests on the sand of analogy, and does not\ncover all the alleged facts.\nNow, in my opinion, theorizing here is but a human weakness ;\nwe need many years devoted to collecting and criticising statements\nof alleged facts. The merit of Mr. Myers and his friends is to\nhave done in collection and criticism of statements hitherto ignored,\nso much work, that scientific men of Mr. Mallock's eminence may\nadmit the \" sober likelihood \" of facts previously scouted, but now\nexplained (by aid of analogy), as the result of processes in the\nliving organism. To myself, explanations based on analogy appear\nof next to no value ; the scientific police \" has a clue \" of the most\nvaporous nature. But Mr. Myers's own explanation, at present,\nseems rather poetry than science. The theory, on the other hand,\nto which Mr. Mallock inclines is at least as old as Lavaterus (circ.\n\f74 [part\nAndrew Lang.\n1580) and Izaak Walton. The hypothesis of Mr. Myers is of neo\nlithic antiquity, and its modern forms, as held by Hegel and Karl\ndu Prel, are so closely akin to Mr. Myers's that I am surprised to\nfind him citing du Prel but once, and Hegel (as far as the index\nshows) not at all.1\nThe success of Mr. Myers and his associates has lain in procuring\na slight amount of attention for facts in human nature accepted by\nHegel, but hitherto dismissed, as a rule, without examination.\nWhatever may be the future (or non-future), of the human person\nality, that personality may come to be more closely studied : science\nmay no longer, like the fabled ostrich, hide her head in the sand.\nTo me the \"Gospel\" of Mr. Myers may be expressed in the words,\n\" Do look into things ! \" He aimed at the sky, but he has, I hope,\nhit this tree. If we cease to argue about such themes as perplexed\nMilton's fallen angels in hell, if we merely study and make experi\nments in human nature, following a path hitherto barred against\ntrespassers, we may learn that we are other than a vain people\nsupposes.\nDiffering from Mr. Myers on a hundred points, holding Mrs. Piper\nalmost as cheap as I do Mrs. Gallup (but not quite), I yet think\nthat many qualities and portions of Mr. Myers's work deserve\nrecognition more generous than Mr. Mallock has given them. Even\nif he did \" see distant gates of Eden gleam\" (a childish and fan\ntastic hallucination), even if he did not, like Mr. Mallock's Virginia\nSt. John, go about giggling at the idea of an Intelligent First\nCause, he worked manfully, courageously,\u2014I say honestly,\u2014at an\nuphill task.\nIt is a matter of detail, and I could only make my point by long\ncitations, but I do not agree with Mr. Mallock that the cases of\nH\u00e9lene Smith, Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood, Mrs. Piper, and the Rev.\nStainton Moses, offer \"the best examples\" of \"veridical phantasms\nof the dead,\" among other phenomena. Indeed I find no \" veridical\nphantasms of the dead\" among the records of these gifted persons.\nPossibly Mr. Mallock has not studied Professor Flournoy's two books\nabout H\u00e9lene Smith 3 The examples which Mr. Mallock does adduce,\nof other phenomena, are not given at their strongest ; indeed some\nare hardly given at all. The odd case of Colonel Gurwood (Vol. II.,\n1 Du Prel: Philosophy of Mysticimi, translated by Mr. Massey. Hegel: Philo-\nKophie den Geistes, Werke, Vol. VII., Berlin, 1845. Mr. Wallace's translation of\n1894 is published by the Clarendon Press (cf. my Making of Religion,\npp. 33-36, Longmans, 1898).\n\fxlvi.] \" The Nineteenth Century\" and Mr. Myers. 75\npp. 161-167) is not offered as a proof of the survival of that gallant\nofficer\u2014with a headache\u2014but as an instance of \"the growing diffi\nculty which the theory of forgotten memories \" (in the living) \"here\ninvolves.\" By the collection of many such records, Mr. Myers thinks\nthat we might reach, or approach, \" some general conclusion as to\nthe source from which these retrocognitive facts come\u2014if in any cases\nforgotten memory fails to explain them \" (Vol. II., p. 167). These are\nimpartial remarks, though, for his own personal part, Mr. Myers\nput his trust in some \" records \" which to me seem valueless, and,\nlike Dr. Hodgson (a sceptical man), came to believe that he had\nproofs of actual \" possession.\"\nSo far I give my reply to Mr. Mallock exactly as it was written\nfor the Editor of The Nineteenth Century and After. I now add, by\nway of reinforcement, other examples, as 1 conceive, of Mr. Mallock's\nmisfortune in misunderstanding and misstating the ideas which he\nopposes.\nThe gist of Mr. Mallock's argument is, that \"the two selves are\nthe same self in different conditions, and not, as Mr. Myers imagines,\ntwo independent entities.\" But Mr. Mallock, though often insisting\non this alleged imagination of Mr. Myers, never once gives a refer\nence to Mr. Myers's book for the opinion. I must repeat that, if I\nunderstand Mr. Myers, he did not occupy the position which Mr.\nMallock attacks. Mr. Mallock climbs a kopje gallantly, with fixed\nbayonets and hoorays; he plants his banner victoriously on the top.\nBut that is easy, for the kopje was not held. Mr. Myers, like Mr.\nMallock, believes that \" the two selves are the same self in different\nconditions,\" and not that \"they are two independent beings.\" Mr.\nMallock, at first, seems to understand that this is Mr. Myers's notion,\nfor he writes\u2014in his second page\u2014\"The supraliminal self is\" (that\nis, in Mr. Myers's theory), \" something thrown up above the surface\nby the self which is submerged below.\" If so, how can Mr. Mallock\nkeep averring that Mr. Myers regards the supraliminal self as \"an\nindependent being\"? The so-called \"supraliminal self,\" in Mr.\nMyers's hypothesis, is only the one self revealing itself in the con\nditions of explicit, ordinary, every-day consciousness. The hypnotic\nself, again, is only the one self under hypnotic conditions of various\nkinds and degrees : it is not the one self utterly untrammelled, as\nMr. Mallock seems to think that Mr. Myers held it to be. On the\nsame page (629) Mr. Mallock asserts both that Mr. Myers holds the\nsupraliminal self to be an emanation of the submerged self, \"some\n\f76 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nthing thrown up by\" that, and also that he holds the supraliminal\nself to be \"a separate entity.\" Some one is guilty of a contradiction\nin terms, and I do not think that Mr. Myers is the erring logician.\nMr. Mallock drops, I conceive, into another error. We have\nnoted that, in his opinion, Mr. Myers, had he lived to see the\ndevelopment of wireless telegraphy (which to a considerable extent\nhe did), \" would have realised how unnecessary and how childish\nwas the spiritualistic hypothesis whereby he seeks to explain the\nfact that a telepathic message is capable of being conveyed to\nseveral percipients simultaneously\" (p. 641). Mr. Myers's hypothesis\nof telepathy, involving several percipients, is here said by Mr.\nMallock to be \"spiritualistic.\" But (p. 632) Mr. Mallock had\nremarked, \" telepathy in itself is not, Mr. Myers says, a fact more\nspiritual or hyperphysical than light, nor does it point of itself\nto an intelligence independent of matter,\" except in certain cases,\nfor which he provides a \"spiritualistic\" and \"childish\" and \"un\nnecessary \" explanation. Now, where does Mr. Myers say that\ntelepathy \"is not more spiritual or hyperphysical than light?\" He\nsays just the contrary in Vol. I., p. 24, and Vol. II., p. 195.\nAs usual, no reference is given by Mr. Mallock. In Volume I.,\npp. 245, 246, Mr. Myers argues against the theory that a \"system\nof undulations \" (as in light) \" can explain the alleged facts \" (cf. II.,\n141-145). I cannot find that Mr. Myers (while not presuming to\ndeny that ether and undulations may be concerned in telepathy)\never says what Mr. Mallock makes him say, that telepathy \" is not,\nin itself, a fact more spiritual or hyperphysical than light.\"\nIn short, Mr. Mallock appears to me too often to credit Mr.\nMyers with opinions which he did not hold, to give no references,\nand to attack positions which are not held. As to telepathy, Mr.\nMallock does not appear to deny the phenomenon, but to incline\nto explain it, if it exists, by the analogy of \" wireless telepathy.\"\nMr. Myers had considered, as we see, Sir William Crookes's\nsuggestion in that kind (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XII., pp. 348-352),\nand, among other objections, urged that \" it is hard to understand\nhow A can emit a pattern of vibrations which, radiating equally in\nall directions, shall affect not only his distant friend B, but also\nthe strangers C and D who happen to be standing near B, and\naffect no other persons, so far as we know, in the world \" (Vol. I.,\np. 246).\nMr. Mallock appears to see nothing in all this. The syntonisa-\ntion of the cerebral coherers of A, B, C, and D offers no difficulty\n\fxlVl.] \" The Nineteenth Century \" and Mr. Myers. 7 7\nto his expert mind. Not knowing aught about these matters, I\nmust refer the question to Sir Oliver Lodge, who has gone pretty\ndeep into these things. Men are not Marconi machines, and, in\nmy ignorance, I must pause before arguing as if they were, for that,\nI repeat, would be a mere argument from analogy.\nFor the rest, I am not defending Mr. Myers's hypotheses\u2014that\nof \" possession \" I reject\u2014I am only anxious that they should be\nunderstood before they are rejected. In history it is well to quote\nthe exact words of a document : in science it appears to be enough\nto write that \" Mr. Myers says \" this or that, in the terms of the\nscientist himself, and without references to the text of the author.\nDaily experience proves that profitable criticisms cannot be produced\nin this way. I need hardly add that, though I think Mr. Mallock\nmisunderstood, I am sure that he never dreamed of misrepresenting\nMr. Myera.\n\f78 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\nREPLY TO MR PODMORE'S CRITICISM.\nBy Professor James H. Hyslop.\nIn this reply to Mr. Podmore's review in Proceedings, Part xlv., of\nmy report on the trance phenomena of Mrs. Piper, I shall not say\none word in defence of the spiritistic hypothesis. I do not think\nthat the defence of this theory is half so important at this stage\nof our investigations as an intelligent and consistent conformity to\nscientific method, as it must be applied to any mass of facts what\never. This requires the detailed application of some single hypothesis\nto all the facts of a record and the exclusion of all adjunctive\nsuppositions which do not naturally articulate with each other in\ndealing with the concrete totality involved, but which represent some\nprobability in their conjunction, as well as inherent applicability to\nthe facts.\nThere are two considerations to be noticed. They are the\nquestions of accuracy in dealing with the record and of the appli\ncation of general principles evidentially sustained in the case. The\nfirst is a question of fact, and the second a question of method. I\ntake these in their order.\n1. Mr. Podmore says: \" The. first seance in Professor Hyslop's\nseries, according to his own original estimate of it is 'absolutely'\nworthless as evidence.\" Now, if the reader of Mr. Podmore's review\nwill turn up his own reference to my report and also look at p. 26\nof the same, he will find that I did not say that the first sitting\n\"is absolutely worthless,\" or that I regarded it in the light which\nMr. Podmore's garbled quotation would imply. I said a very\ndifferent thing. I said that I had \"treated it and would treat it\nalone as absolutely worthless.\" But I was careful to indicate that I\nwas treating it as a part of a whole requiring the same hypothesis\nto explain it. The statements which follow this quotation do not\ncommit me to any view that the reader may adopt, but show that\nI hold to my present opinion in spite of difficulties which I recog\nnised and appreciated in the minds of those who did not and could\n\fxltl] Reply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism. 79\nnot measure the facts as I could. I did not alter my opinion of\nits weakness evidentially until I discovered a number of true things\nin it, some of them synthetic, which I had at first supposed false.\nThese gave it a value and unity with other sittings that it did not\nseem to have at first.\n2. In the allusion to the \"communicator's\" question, \"Do you\nhear her sing,\" Mr. Podmore does not seem to see why I called it\nan automatism and apparently refuses to recognise it as such. I\nagree that \" to the uninstructed reader it was not more out of place\nthan other remarks interjected in the course of the trance writings,\"\nmany of which in the dramatic play of personality were treated as\nautomatisms. But I was speaking to the instructed reader, the\npsychopathologist, and to those who admitted the trance condition\nas Mr. Podmore does, who would recognise on any theory whatever,\nexcept conscious fraud, that as an irrelevant statement it must be\ntreated as an automatism. Moreover, I did not, as charged, recog\nnise the question as relevant, but on the contrary, just because it\nwas irrelevant, recognised that it was an automatism. The\npsychological reasons for this judgment are patent to the student of\nabnormal mental phenomena.\n3. In regard to the confusion about the names \"Alice\" and\n'\u2022 Annie \" several things are to be said, (a) Mr. Podmore does not\nstate what true \" valuable information \" the trance intelligence could\nhave easily gained under the circumstances. If guessing is as easy as\nhe implies, will he please to tell some evidential true fact following\nfrom the suggestion which he insinuates, (b) What has the supposed\nfact that the incident is \"quite in Phinuit's old style\" to do with\nthe case? Does Mr. Podmore suppose that Phinuit is wholly dis\nposed of by a verdict of non-proven in regard to his identity 1 I\nhad explicitly provided in my discussion for this very matter\n(pp. 254-255) and may abbreviate it by referring to what I have said\nin the reply to Mr. Carrington on the same point (Part xlv. p. 365).\n(c) The remark by Mr. Podmore is wholly irrelevant to the question\nof interpreting the record and confuses the reader with implica\ntions about the evidential issue which is not here concerned, because\nmy question, \" Is it Alice ? \" may have two interpretations other\nthan the one suggested by the bracketted doubt about the writing\nwhich was inserted afterwards, and in fact, as shown by the next\nquestion, was intended as a ruse to make the medium think that\nAlice was correct, and there was no excuse for the correction on\nany theory of suggestion.\n\f80 Professor James H. Hyslop.\n4. Regarding the confusion of D for NK in the name Frank, I\nmay say : (a) The reading was primarily Dr. Hodgson's, as explained\nin my report (pp. 14-15, and 301), and not mine, and his first im\npression was allowed to stand, although the resemblance to NK is\ndefinite and clear enough. We decided the doubt in this as in\nall similar cases against the evidential interpretation, (b) Does Mr.\nPodmore think this is a prejudiced way to treat the subject? (c)\nThe name is distinctly FRAD, except the symbol for D or NK, the\nA being a very clear capital. Now how does Mr. Podmore account\nfor such a name on the hypothesis of either guessing, suggestion,\nor inference 1\n5. Mr. Podmore says : \" The messages for the most part bear no\nlabel of origin.\" (\u00ab) If he means some of the messages which he\nmentions without explaining their context, his statement, which\nallows for some of them having this label, will not be open to criti\ncism. If he means, as is most apparent from his allusions being\ngeneral, the messages in the whole report, his statement is either\nmisleading or false, and the facts of the record, which are not so\ndependent on \" internal evidence \" (an elastic expression) as Mr.\nPodmore implies, support a very definite \"label of origin\" in most\ncases. A man does not have to announce his name every time he\ntalks through a telephone, though he may have to do so generally\nat first. There may be plenty of conclusive indications on any\ntheory whatever, fraud, guessing, or secondary personality, of the\norigin intended, and this suffices for the psychological question in an\ninductive problem. Mr. Podmore is so enamoured of the importance\nof proper names that he apparently cannot see or appreciate this\nfact, which I suspect, however, he would see easily enough if fraud\nwere in the question, (b) The proof of my assertions is found all\nthe way through Appendix iv. of my Report, which apparently Mr.\nPodmore has not examined. In the experiments there described\nand discussed, it should be noticed that I did not permit any \" label\nof origin \" to be communicated. Only with one exception did I\nallow any name or relationship of the communicator, or fragmentary\nintimation of them to be sent. I pursued this policy purposely to\nanticipate and answer just such reflections as Mr. Podmore indulges\nin his review, and there were instances where the correct origin was\ndiscovered when the message very effectively concealed it.\n6. Mr. Podmore says : \" Names are thrown out haphazard, to be\ntaken up and identified or left, as the sitter wills,\" and then he gives\none example of his assertion, and that one not an illustration of\n\fxlvi.] 81\nBeply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism.\neither the guessing or chance coincidence that he suggests ! (a) The\nstatement conveys to the reader the suggestion, especially since he\nmakes the statement general, that we are dealing throughout with\nphenomena like those of the ordinary guessing mediums, when as\na fact Mr. Podmore admits both the trance and an unusual intelligence\nconnected with it. There is just enough semblance occasionally in\nthe giving of names in the Piper case to deceive the unscientific man,\nbut that is all. I have had a great many experiences with guessing\nmediums, and the haphazard throwing out of names has never shown\nsystematically the peculiar marks of the Piper case. There is in\nthe latter instance very generally, when the name is not given at\none shot, some phonetic analogy around which the approximations\nto the correct name play, many of them not naturally suggested to\nany guessing intelligence. A man who had the slightest acquaint\nance with the phonetics of guessing and experimental fishing would\nnot confuse the Piper case with the \"ordinary professional clair\nvoyant,\" even on the supposition of fraud. (6) Mr. Podmore would\nhave done well to note and mention the experiments on this point\nin Appendix v., where phonetics played a part in the results, (c)\nThe example given, which has no resemblance to the general pro\ncedure in the sittings and indicated in the record, does not bear out\nthe very natural implication of Mr. Podmore's remark, namely, that\nthe \" billet \" was found in Dr. Hodgson : for the record (p. 330)\nshows that it was not so found either in fact or according to the\nspontaneous correction of the \"controls\" after its possible appli\ncability to Dr. Hodgson had been assumed the day before. (d)\nAfter admitting the existence of a trance intelligence in the Piper\ncase Mr. Podmore ought to have remarked that his instance was\nnot an example of the \" ordinary professional clairvoyant,\" instead\nof allowing the reader to suppose that he was thinking of conscious\nfrauds.\n7. 1n the catalogue of proper names which occur in the first\nsitting, Mr. Podmore says, mentioning that of Elizabeth, \" It should\nbe added that the lady introduced as Elizabeth was known in life\nas Eliza.\" This language is not clear in its implications, as a most\nimportant point is omitted. (a) It suggests that I had positively\nidentified Elizabeth with Eliza, apparently on the resemblance of\nnames, as Mr. Podmore is here omitting reference to context in\nspeaking of proper names. I did not so identify them, (b) Mr.\nPodmore classes it as correct. I did not say that it was correct,\nand the record does not justify any assurance on this point. I\nF\n\f82 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\nindicated this fact, (c) I explicitly spoke of the name as a \" possible \"\nreference to my mother's sister, and I did so, not primarily on the\nground of any resemblance between Elizabeth and Eliza, but expressly\non the ground that the \"communicator\" definitely referred to my\nmother's sister in close connection with the name Elizabeth, though\nin the order of statement the reference could have been to the name\nof Mary, and if the reader will examine the record in its psychological\ncharacter he will find a natural explanation of even this discrepancy.\nMr. Podmore omits to say anything about the synthetic feature of\nthe case on which I had founded the \"possible,\" and only the\n\" possible,\" reference to my mother's sister. (d) Further, I said\nmerely that it contained \"only this approximation to the truth,\"\nnaming the \"possible\" meaning of the name. All this should be\nrecognised in any discussion or remarks about the application of\nchance to the first sitting.\n8. A little further on, in giving a list of correct names mentioned\nat the second sitting, Mr. Podmore explicitly identifies the name\nEliza with that of Elizabeth, as mentioned in the first sitting. This\nis a guess by Mr. Podmore and is wrong. There is not a word in\nthe record or in my statements to suggest this identification. I\nhad explicitly distinguished them by saying that Elizabeth was\npossibly intended for my mother's sister, whose name was Eliza,\nand that the Eliza of the second sitting was my father's sister. I\ndid not know until more than two weeks later (cf. note p. 350) that\nmy mother had a sister by the name of Eliza, and it was my aunt\nthat suspected the meaning of the reference to Elizabeth. Mr. Pod-\nmore's mistake comes from his habit of attaching undue importance\nto proper names and ignoring the synthetic and contextual features\nof the \"communications.\"\n9. Mr. Podmore says that my full name was given at the second\nsitting, although this was given only in piecemeal, according to his\nstatement, (a) This statement of Mr. Podmore is not correct, and\nthere is not a word in the record to support it. (b) Only a part of\nmy christian name was given at the beginning of the sitting and no\nreference to my surname made afterward at that sitting. (c) The\nexplicit statement in the record (p. 322) is that \"Hyslop\" referred\nto my father and not to myself. The \"communicator\" definitely\nclaimed to be my father as Mrs. Piper came out of the trance, and\nmy note assumed and discussed only that interpretation of the\nname. (d) The reader will see from the facts just stated, including\nthe context, that the name was not \"ejaculated without context,\n\fxlvj.] Reply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism. 83\nleaving the sitter to find his own application,\" as is asserted by Mr.\nPodmore. This failure to observe contextual incidents is all the\nmore inexcusable when taken in connection with his own remark,\n(e) The name was not the only \" definite true statement \" made at\nthe second sitting. There were several of a very pertinent sort and\nwith as much weight in the recognition of personal identity as many\nthat sufficed to suggest and confirm it in the experiments recorded\nin Appendix iv. (\/) The intimation that \"the medium had an\nopportunity of passing in review the events of the first sitting\" is\neither a suggestio falsi, contradicting Mr. Podmore's own readiness\nto exclude fraud from the case (p. 376), or it is an irresponsible\ngenerality without specific illustration or proof. It does not dis\ntinguish between Mrs. Piper's conscious reflection in her normal state\non what was observed by her before and after the trance and normally\nconscious knowledge of the \" communications \" which might be inferred\nfrom Mr. Podmore's statement, but which she has no external means\nof obtaining and which all the facts seem to disprove or contradict.\nNeither does it distinguish between either of these and supernormal\nsubliminal action. Now as Mr. Podmore had intimated that there\nwas nothing of a supernormal character in my record in his remark\nthat \" normal channels of information were wide enough to have\nconveyed everything in the later stances which was true and relevant \"\n(p. 376), the only rational interpretation of his language regarding\nthe review of the events at the sitting is that he meant to suppose\nthe possibility of fraud, and unless you specify the kind of fraud\nthat you mean, the reader is justified in supposing that you mean\nconscious fraud. Subliminal fraud I had considered and discussed\n(pp. 153, 292). There should be no admission of the trance if you\nare going to use such language as \" passing in review the events of\nthe first sitting,\" as it conveys a wholly false implication in the case.\nIt is using the imputation of \"possible\" conscious fraud without\nmaking oneself responsible for evidence that it is a fact, after con\nfessing earlier (p. 376) that there was no evidence in Mrs. Piper's\npast history that she practised the ordinary fraud.\n10. In Mr. Podmore's summary marked (C) he mentions some inci\ndents in the record and then says: \"In the detailed notes (p. 314)\nthe passage is interpreted as coming from the father. But in the\nreport (p. 28) it is apparently assigned to the uncle.\" Let me\nremark : (a) The passage to which Mr. Podmore alludes is not\nspecifically quoted nor specifically alluded to on page 28 of the\nReport, (b) 1 do not \"in the detailed notes (p. 314)\" specifically\n\f84 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\nrefer the passage to my father directly. I made a purely hypothetical\nstatement and it was made with reference to the possibility of\ntreating my brother Charles as an intermediary, though the \"com\nmunication\" be supposed to be thus indirectly from my father,\n(c) I do not specifically refer the passage to my uncle on page 28,\nand there is not even an appearance of it, unless you assume that\nI must indicate all omissions made for the sake of brevity and\nincluding non-evidential matter. I left the reader to observe where\nmy uncle began, not even specifying page references to the passage\npurporting to come from my uncle, as it had no importance for the\nsummary at this point. There is no such definite contradiction in\nmy interpretation as is apparently implied by Mr. Podmore's obser\nvation, (d) I distinctly said on page 28 that I passed by all that\nmight have come from my uncle to summarise my father's messages,\nand so gave no clue to what I identified and what I did not iden\ntify with the uncle's \"communications.\"\n11. In Mr. Podmore's summary (D) he says: \"Then follows general\ntalk about the loneliness and grief of Eliza, after the sitter had\nintimated by his question that Eliza was still living.\" A slight\ncorrection is necessary in this statement, (a) Not one word is said\nin this \" general talk \" about the \" loneliness \" of Eliza either before\nor after the question which I asked. The idea has to be imported\ninto the statement from my note (p. 363). (b) The answer to my\nquestion is not a case of \"intimation,\" or suggestion, as understood\nin the phenomena of secondary personality, but is rather amenable\nto guessing, (c) If this passage is to be described as \"general talk,\"\nwhat should be said of the specific and very pertinent incidents in\nthe reference to \" music, flowers, walks, drives,\" and \" she thought\nshe saw me in her sleep \" in close connection with the apparent\nallusion to my father ?\n12. In summary (A\") Mr. Podmore repeats the error made previ\nously in regard to the \"ejaculation of the sitter's surname without\ncontext.\"\n13. Mr. Podmore says that the statement, \"Give me my hat and\nlet me go,\" made in the second sitting, is \" claimed as characteristic.\"\n(a) This is not correct. I made no such statement in the record.\n(b) I explicitly excluded this statement by \" my father \" from the\nlist of phrases which I claimed to be \" characteristic \" (p. 89). (c) It\nwas the connection in which it was said, not the fact of it, that\ngave the statement interest, and it was made also in the first sitting\nin a similar psychological situation and very suggestive connection.\n\fXLvi.] 85\nReply to Mr. Podmorc's Criticism.\n(d) It was my brother that discovered and indicated the pertinence\nof the statement.\n14. As to Mr. Podmore's statements about the Cooper incidents\nthere are a few things to notice. (a) The correspondence with Dr.\nCooper was not \"purely conjectural,\" and I did not say it was. I\nstated that it was probable, which I so put cautiously as against\nfairly definite evidence, my stepmother's memory, that it was a fact.\n(A) The imputation in Mr. Podmore's statement, \" It is true that in\nany case writing is not talking,\" is not justified by the record. The\ntalks were a fact supported by specific mention of my stepmother of\nthe time and incidents connected with them : the fact of writing was\nnot so supported. I mentioned the friendship and talking in my\nnote on the incident, both certain facts, as evidence independently\nof my stepmother's testimony that the correspondence was probable,\nas well as indications of correctness in the \"communications.\"\n(c) The \"communicator\" made no reference whatever to a photo of\neither this Dr. Joseph Cooper or Mr. Samuel Cooper, the latter of\nwhom had been suggested by myself. Mr. Podmore's statement implies\nthat this mention was made in reference to Dr. Cooper, (d) I did\nnot make the slightest reference in my notes or elsewhere to any\nsuch photo. Mr. Podmore's conception of the incident exists only in\nhis imagination, (e) The actual \"communications\" about the photo,\nin connection with the name of Cooper, as any intelligent reader of\nthe record may see for himself, do not lend the slightest support to\nMr. Podmore's supposition that the mention of it referred to either\nof the Coopers. The form of statement in this connection explicitly\nindicates a previous allusion to it when I was present and out of\nall connection with the Coopers and before I had suggested the\nname (pp. 52, 397). (\/) Mr. Podmore actually quotes the statement\nof the \" communicator \" and does not remark this reference. (g) The\nimplication in Mr. Podmore's statement, \" that Dr. Cooper did not\nlive West, but, unfortunately, East,\" is wholly misleading. It implies\nmost apparently that the interpretation on which the statement is\nfounded is the necessary one regarding the message. This is not the\nfact and I so intimated it. The \"communicator\" did not say that\nCooper \" lived West,\" but \" old friend in the West.\" How would\nMr. Podmore, on his interpretation, make the falsity of the state\nment rational on the hypothesis of fraud or guessing ? You have to\nput on it the interpretation which I said was possible in order to\nmake the assumption of fraud rational, and I stated this interpre\ntation, as my original note shows, to indicate that I was willing to\n\f86 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\ntest the \"communications\" by the hypothesis of fraud. (A) The\ninterpretation of the note (p. 386) which was a correction of the\nearlier note and whose most apparent meaning refers to the correct\nness of the allusion \" in the West,\" if it implied the fact of Dr.\nCooper's living there, flatly contradicts Mr. Podmore's interpretation\nof the message.1 (\u00bb) Mr. Podmore omits one of the most important\nfacts of the Cooper incident and which with its synthetic or con\ntextual relation to others in the same connection is a circumstance\nof some interest. It was the statement regarding the temporal\nrelation between the death of Dr. Cooper and that of my father.\n15. Mr. Podmore quotes (p. 388) a statement of mine relative to\nthe evidential nature of a passage in the \" communications \" of my\nuncle, James M'Clellan, and names references in the record in which\nmy statement was not made and which would most naturally imply\nto the reader that my statement was made in the connection indi\ncated, when it was not. (a) My statement was made on page 109,\nand Mr. Podmore's references were 111, 470, 535, representing a\ntotally different context and one that would conceal the incidents on\nwhich my statement was based. (&) In alluding to the mistake\nregarding the identity of John M'Clellan, the incidents of whom I\nhad summarised separately from those of James M'Clellan, Mr.\nPodmore rather intimates, in his remark about a supposed suspicious\ncircumstance, that my statement respecting the pertinent and eviden\ntial character of the incidents from James M'Clellan is not justified.\nIf Mr. Podmore had actually mentioned the correct and decidedly\nevidential incidents in the \"communications\" of this James M'Clellan\nhis strictures might have been treated as less objectionable as\nregards the facts. But to mention this one lone exception and error\nas if it were the whole case is very like concealing the truth from\nthe reader. Besides Mr. Podmore positively indicates that the\n1I shall confess frankly to a sin in this note coriecting the earlier one. Mr.\nPodmore, however, has not remarked it, although I had indicated in various\nplaces the proper interpretation of the incident. I confess, on reading it now,\nthat the note coriecting the earlier one is quite misleading, and should have\nbeen expanded a little or modified to make clear what I had in mind. At the\ntime it was written, and this was while the report was going through the\npress, I was anxious to abbreviate and had the Cooper incident as a whole in\nmind, and inserted it here because I was maiuly bent on changing the allusion\nto \"mediumistic tricks.\" I am very glad that I can call attention to this\npiece of carelessness. It is quite probable also that in writing the note I had\nin mind the Cooper Memorial School which was situated in the West from my\nfather's home.\n\fxlvi.J Reply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism. 87\nmistake is \" suspicious,\" and this without evidence for the insinuation\nof fraud in his allusion to the county history which I had con\nsidered in making up my judgment, a fact not told the reader\nby Mr. Podmore, and without the consideration of the incidents of\nthe lost finger and the name Hathaway together with the omission\nof all reference to the only other fact than the name, the ensign\ncommission, that could be obtained in that history and that was uot\nmentioned by the \"communicator.\" I had mentioned every circum\nstance and fact by which Mr. Podmore's hypothesis could be tried\nand it was clear to every intelligent reader that this county history\nwas not the source of the knowledge conveyed. Cf. Journal S.P.R.,\nVol. X., p. 219.\n16. In regard to the name Carruthers, which is not fully ex\nplained by Mr. Podmore, I have not to complain of an error of\nfact so definitely as in other cases, but only to say that his apparent\nrepresentation of the incident seems to insinuate that I did not\ntreat the failure to get that name as an objection to the hypothesis\nthat I was testing, and that I should have treated it as he does.\nIn the statistical summary where I was treating all \"factors,\" or\n\" single incidents,\" individually and without relation to context, I\nclassed this name as a positive error. But it is context and\nsynthetic character and relation that may serve for positive identi\nfication on any theory whatever, even when a large amount of\nmistake and confusion occurs. On Mr. Podmore's own supposition,\nwhether of \"possible\" or actual fraud, I would have maintained the\nsame opinion of the meaning, other things being the same, of that\nfailure in the \" ordinary clairvoyant's \" performances, though I should\nbe very much puzzled to know why any conscious fraud would\nmake such an unnecessary mistake. Mr. Podmore might have\nindicated what 1 said about this name and the \" communications \"\nof this uncle on pp. 90, 94, and 223. It would also have been\nwell to have remarked what I said in the footnote on p. 240\nregarding the possible mistake of Charles for Carruthers.\n17. In allusion to \"normal channels of information,\" on p. 376,\nsuch as inference and suggestion, Mr. Podmore says : \" To this\nquestion Professor Hyslop has not addressed himself at all.\" This\nis not true. I very carefully \" addressed \" myself to these theories\nand rejected them as nonsense. The reader may consult the follow\ning references as proof that I explicitly did so, in my Report,\npp. 16-17, 124, and especially 247-248. As Mr. Podmore gives no\nevidence in his review that he had examined what I said between\n\f88 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslup.\npp. 124 and 296, he may be able to plead ignorance of my state\nments.\nThese mistakes have a humorous aspect for me after Mr. Pod-\nmore's animadversions on the manner in which I treated mistakes\nand fragmentary messages in my Report. I have always been\ntaught to believe that Mr. Podmore could state facts as clearly,\nas correctly, and as accurately as people usually suppose that dis-\ncarnate spirits ought to communicate through Mrs. Piper's organism.\nBut after all, these numerous mistakes and errors mentioned above\nand committed by Mr. Podmore, who might have been in a rational\nstate of mind when quoting my Report and writing his review of\nit, a condition in which the spiritistic hypothesis, as I stated\nit, does not suppose the communicator to be, I confess that, if I\ncannot use fragmentary messages and mistakes as evidence of per.\nsonal identity I must doubt the very existence of the Mr. Podmore\nthat I have believed in, and may be required to believe that\nsome fraudulent writer of very ordinary intelligence has been\npersonating him with less cleverness than the review of my Report\nsupposes was necessary or adequate to explain the messages in\nthat record. It may be that spirits ought to do better, but it is\ntime to be charitable toward them as a \"possibility.\"\nII.\nI come next to Mr. Podmore's method of treating the record and the\nassumptions which he makes without producing evidence that they apply.\n1. There are various statements and intimations in Mr. Podmore's\nreview, which the reader may remark for himself, such as the\n'' possibility \" that information was or \" might be \" obtained from\noutside sources by at least the medium ; the \" possibility \" that\nchance coincidence, guessing, inference, and suggestion \"might\"\nexplain much ; the manner of reversing the emphasis which my\nReport placed upon explanatory as compared with evidential\nproblems there discussed, and especially the limitation of his review\nand argument to the earlier sittings and assumptions of \" possible \"\nfraud in connection with the later sittings, though his attitude even\nhere is not consistent, as he is content with a general and un\nsupported assertion about the application of inference and suggestion\nto the later seances\u2014these statements and intimations which most\napparently show that Mr. Podmore assumed that I was trying to\ndemonstrate the spiritistic theory, or primarily to convince the reader\n\fXLvI.] 89\nReply to Mr. Podmore s Criticism.\nof its truth by dumbfounding the imagination in the exclusion of\nthe \" possibility \" of fraud, when I distinctly renounced all intention\nof doing this. They go to show this contention, because all\ndemonstration, in the proper sense of absolute proof, implies the\nexclusion of alternative possibilities of explanation, as rationally\nsustained to some extent at least. An inductive problem does not\nexclude the recognition of alternative \"possibilities,\" but insists that the\nentertainment of them shall be accompanied by as much consistent evidence\nthat they are facts in the particular case as is presented for the hypothesis\nadopted. This conception of the problem is fundamental to the\nposition consciously taken in my Report and defined for the very\npurpose of remaining at the inductive point of view until further\nevidence was obtained, either for refuting Dr. Hodgson and myself,\nor for better chances to convince the reader.\nHow careful I was to define the problem that I was investigating\nand discussing, as both explanatory and evidential, with the emphasis\nin my Report on the explanatory character of the hypothesis\ndefended, can be seen by consulting the following references to that\nReport and the Journal (pp. 4, footnote, 86, 90, 124, 244-247, 290-294,\nand especially 295-296 : Journal S.P.R., Vol. x , pp. 213-215). I\nagree that a hypothesis must have evidence, but it must also explain\nand be applicable psychologically to the whole case in court and\nconsistently adapted to details without imaginary and unsupported\nadjunctive suppositions. Now as my explicit statements showed\nthat I was not trying to demonstrate the spiritistic theory, or to\nconvince the reader, but only testing a hypothesis formed on other\nrecords and applied to mine with less evidential value, Mr. Podmore\nought to have seen that it was as much his duty to give evidence\nof his hypotheses of inference and suggestion as he thinks it was\nmine to prove spiritism. If I had professed to demonstrate the\nspiritistic theory, the mention of alternative \"possibilities\" not con\nsidered by me might have had some respect given them, but as I\nprofessedly was dealing with an inductive problem, Mr. Podmore\nmust accept that issue in reviewing the Report, and not demand\nthat I shall look at the problem in his way, without applying his\n\" possible \" hypotheses to the record evidentially and in detail.\nBut instead of evidence and detailed application of his theory, he\nsimply asserts that his various hypotheses are \"not excluded,\" that\nthey are \"possible,\" that they \"might\" explain certain incidents.\nOf all the words of tongue or pen\nThe saddest are these : it might have been.\n\f90 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\nI do not understand that scientific work consists or is exhausted in\nthe collection and publication of \" might be's.\"\nThe reader will now anticipate how I mean to treat Mr. Podmore's\nplaying with the hypotheses of fraud. I simply repeat what I said\nin my Report on this matter (pp. 5-10). I absolutely refuse to\ndiscuss the supposition of it seriously until the issue is squarely faced\nas I defined it for myself and as the history of the Piper case\ndefines it inductively. I explicitly gave my reasons for taking this\nposition (pp. 5-10 : cf. pp. 298, .344-346). The last page and a half\nof my Report (pp. 295-296) also had the same issue in mind. When\nMr. Podmore is prepared to give definite evidence that fraud of\nany kind is a probable fact in the case, I can take his treatment of\nthe subject with some scientific seriousness.\nMr. Podmore's position regarding fraud is this. The first sitting\nwas a failure, and the second sitting was very poor at least, if not\nan equal failure. The later sittings are so separated by intervals\nof time and opportunity to coHect information regarding the sitter\nthat their evidential claims are vitiated. His statements on pp.\n376 and 388 have no rational meaning except on the assumption\nthat he has conscious detective fraud in mind : for he alludes to\n\" knowledge normally acquired by the medium, either in her waking\nstate from things heard and read,\" etc., to information \" possibly \"\nobtainable \" from registers, tombstones, old newspapers, directories,\nor any other sources,\" and to the \"suspicious mistake\" which he\nimagines \" might \" be due to consulting an old county history.\nNow I shall frankly admit the plausibility of this claim or insinua\ntion by Mr. Podmore that fraud is a factor in my record to be con\nsidered, but on the following conditions : (a) If he will show that no\nadequate attempts have been made in the past previous to my sittings\nto exclude fraud on Mrs. Piper's part and to show that it was both\nforeign to her habits and unnecessary to produce the results, (b) If\nhe will apply the hypothesis of fraud to the whole case in detail and\ngive specific evidence for the truth of the adjunctive suppositions\nnecessary to account for these details, including trivialities, mistakes,\nconfusions, automatic writing, the dramatic play of personality, the\napparent difference of clearness in the \" communicators,\" the absence\nof definite time relations in the \" communications,\" and all the\npsychological peculiarities generally in the case, as well as the\nomissions of what the hypothesis of fraud would most naturally lead\nus to expect would be given most easily and without unnecessary\nexpense and trouble in collecting the information, (c) If he will\n\fxlvi.] Reply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism. 91\nabandon the admission that there is any \" trance intelligence \" con\nnected with the Piper phenomena, and show that there is no evidence\nto support the belief that her trance is genuine. (d) If he will prove,\nwhat his method of treating my \"Report in reality assumes\u2014namely\nthat the Piper and similar phenomena are not to be treated as a\nwhole after reasonable evidence that fraud is not practised, but\nde novo with each new sitting or sitter, and with the liberty to articulate\ntheories as you please whether consistent with each other or not.\n(e) If he will show that the explanatory problem does not enter into\nthe scientific treatment of the case as a whole, but only his conception\nof the evidential incidents. (\/) If, remembering that this is an\ninductive problem, he will produce specific evidence that there is\nreason to believe that \"registers, tombstones, old newspapers, direc\ntories,\" and similar sources of information, did actually supply any\none connected with the Piper case with the information contained in\nthe incidents of the \" communications \" on which I definitely formed\nmy reasons for applying the spiritistic hypothesis to my record.\n(g) If he will show, after his admission in the review and elsewhere\nthat there is a supernormal faculty indicated in the Piper case, that\nthere is no reason to assume this faculty operative when the a priori\nand imaginary \"possibility\" of fraud is not excluded from it all the\ntime and from all incidents in the same way, and wherein it is rational\nfor Mrs. Piper, without the collusion of others, to carry on so vast\na system of detective agencies as must be assumed to account for\nthe peculiarity of many of the details, with the attendant trouble\nand expense and so little result, according to the opinion of Mr.\nPodmore, when it would have been so easy and inexpensive to get\nfar better results, and to avoid mistakes and confusions. When Mr.\nPodmore has done all these, it will be time to take his reflections as\nseriously as he does himself.\nBut how does Mr. Podmore proceed ] He makes an allusion to\n\" knowledge normally acquired by the medium,\" and then goes on\nto indicate that the result can be explained by inference from my\nstatements and suggestions to Mrs. Piper in the trance state, and so\nexpresses himself as to include this trance state in the conception of\n\" normal.\" Now the trance is not a \" normal \" condition, and Mr.\nPodmore's ambiguous way of speaking has the advantage of suggest\ning conscious fraud to the reader, while he shelters himself against\nthe accusation that he intends this by taking refuge behind the\nadmission of the trance, and the hypotheses of inference and sugges\ntion. Then after intimating that \" these normal channels of\n\f92 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\ninformation were possibly wide enough to have conveyed everything\nin the later seances which was true and relevant,\" he returns near\nthe close of his review to the idea of detective fraud, and even\nsays that any possible information obtainable from \" registers, tomb\nstones,\" etc., \" is to be attributed to such sources.\" This is abandoning\nthe hypothesis of inference and suggestion from my statements at\nthe sitting. If you are going to assume the \" possibility \" of con\nscious fraud, you should explain the latter results by it, and if you\nare going to explain them by subliminal inferences from suggestions,\netc., you must not hint at conscious fraud of the detective type,\nespecially after you have admitted that in the previous history of\nthe case it had been excluded, and that in my case \" we may perhaps\nexclude it,\" as his treatment of the first two sittings and explanation\nof results in others by subliminal inference and suggestion alone,\nand the admission of the trance, show that he does, and must con\nsistently exclude it. Now, if inference and suggestion can explain\neverything after these two sittings, why did not Mr. Podmore apply\nthese hypotheses evidentially, as my consideration and rejection of\nthem explicitly required him to do, to such incidents as the brown-\nhandled knife with which my father pared his finger nails, the\nmedicines, hyomei and strychnine, black skull cap, the name of Lucy\nM'Clellan, the name of James M'Clellan, the name Hathaway,\nthe allusion to Swedenborg, and our talk about him, to hallucination,\nto the experiment with the young woman in connection with her\ndream, the organ incident in connection with the name of Harper\nCrawford, the reference to the mortgage, the reference to taxes, the\nmention of the talk with the principal of the school about my\nbrother George, and to the anxieties of my father, my aunt Nannie,\nand myself, in connection with this brother, the allusion to war,\nand the mental anxiety associated with the injury to my father's\nleg. the horse Tom, and my brother's disposal of him, the name\nJerry, the allusion to an organ and the \" communicator's \" desire\nto \" hear \" my sister Lida sing, the fact of my uncle, James\nM'Clellan, despising the name Jim, the name and relationship of\nthis uncle's brother John, the prediction of this brother's death, and\nthe message of that death afterwards, the incident of the lost finger\nin the case of John M'Clellan, the sunstroke and the name David\nconnected with it, the allusion to the chimney, and its having been\ntaken down, the allusion to a school in connection with the name\nCooper, the relative time of this Cooper's death as compared with\nmy father's, the dog Peter which George had, the tokens, the\n\fXLvi.] Reply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism. 93\nmention of excitement on the occaaion of my cousin's visit, the\nnames Jennie and Lucy mentioned together, my father's moving\nwest, and the visit to my brother just before this move, and many\nothers which it would unnecessarily swell this list to mention ? I have\ngiven this large list for the reader to decide for himself how utterly\npreposterous Mr. Podmore's unsupported assertion is. You may account\nfor them by detective fraud if you like, but this is not inference,\nchance coincidence, or suggestion. The fact is that Mr. Podmore, in\nmaking his assertion, confuses the conditions of fraud with those for\ninference and suggestion, when the two theories do not consist with\neach other in application to the same facts.\n(2) In spite of the fact that Mr. Podmore, on p. 376, says that\nwe \" may perhaps exclude fraud,\" remarking at the same time that\nwe cannot equally \" exclude chance coincidence, skilful inference,\nand the reproduction of information casually acquired,\" a few pages\nlater (p. 380), coming to the same situation, he says of fraud, \" clearly\nthat possibility is not one which we can altogether exclude.\" This\nposition he apparently reserves as a vantage ground in case the\nother assumptions are laughed out of court. Then he proceeds to\ndiscuss the first and second sittings in a manner to suppose the\n\" possibility \" of conscious fraud, chance coincidence, and inference\nfrom suggestion, etc. Now the application of all these hypotheses\nto the same data is either superfluous or contradictory. He assumes\nthat, in the first sitting, I had excluded the opportunity for conscious\nfraud, and that chance will account for all that occurred in that\nsitting. He limits his treatment of facts, however, to the proper\nnames in that sitting, and neglects all the incidents which had in\nfluenced my mind to consider it as psychologically connected with\nlater sittings, and to treat it as \" slightly evidential \" of the super\nnormal, though not of spirits when taken alone. Now there are\ntwo things which rather discredit the easy application of chance, even\nto this sitting. The first is the group of facts associated with my\nbrother Charles, namely, the relationship to me, the reference to\nhis fever, to his \" bad throat,\" to his decease many years ago, to\nhis passing away in the winter, and to the remembrance of seeing\nsnow on the ground. The mention of typhoid fever was wrong, but\nthis was spontaneously corrected in a later sitting without any sug\ngestion from me that he was wrong. Besides, there were several\nother true incidents mentioned by this \" communicator \" apparently,\nbut those just given, as there was no fishing or suggestion, are beyond\nchance, however you may prefer to account for them. The second\n\f94 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslo\/p.\nfact is that the proper names in this sitting are grouped in a way\nto suggest that chance is not the supposition to account for them.\nFive names coming close together, and associated with the \" com\nmunicator,\" whom I would not recognise, were all irrelevant to me,\nand all the relevant names in the main correct, near the close of\nthe sitting, applied to me.\nNow, when it comes to the second sitting, Mr. Podmore tries the\nhypothesis of guessing and inference to account for what he wrongly\nsupposes, against my definite statement to the contrary, to have\nbeen intended for my full name, and in the remark that \" the medium\nhad had the opportunity of passing in review the events of the first\nsitting, and the names of likely sitters,\" virtually implies the dis\nposition to conscious fraud on her part affecting the trance utterances,\nso that we have a hypothesis which makes guessing and inference\nabsurd, as these applied to the case assume previous ignorance of\nthe sitter. Now in his reference to the first sitting, Mr. Podmore\nsays that \" the precautions taken against the discovery of his (my)\nidentity seem to have been pretty complete.\" He does not seem\nto have remarked that I had a sitting with Mrs. Piper in 1892,\nthe record of which is published in my report before him (p. 297).\nTo many persons it would seem impossible after that to exclude\nthe \"possibility\" of conscious fraud, and those who believe in\nlarge supernormal powers the fact would settle the probability of my\nidentity at the outset. In fact, I dispute Mr. Podmore's statement\nfrom the standpoint of \" possible \" fraud which he flirts with. 1\ntook the precaution of wearing the mask mainly, as I indicated\nexplicitly (p. 12), to be able to say so and answer the first objection\nof the scientific plebs, among whom Mr. Podmore is apparently\nwilling to be classed, and not to exclude the \" possibility \" of fraud.\nThere are all sorts of ways in which I can \" imagine \" that Mrs.\nPiper \" could \" have ascertained my identity at the first sitting, or\nhave known that it was I that had the engagement. My treatment\nof fraud showed clearly enough that I so considered the matter, and\nmy full notes indicated the same (pp. 11, 298-299, 344-346). I make\nbold to say that, personally, I had no objections at the time to\nMrs. Piper's knowing who I was, as I had previously been convinced\nthat fraud was not the hypothesis to account for the facts in the\ncase, and went solely to test the hypothesis which Mr. Podmore\nconsiders \" possibly \" sufficient to explain all the true and relevant\nincidents in later sittings. I explicitly said so (p. 12). I think\nthat every intelligent man will agree with the judgment that the\n\fxlvi.] Eeply to Mr. Fodmore's Criticism. 95\nresults absolutely prove that chance coincidence, skilful inference,\nand suggestion are excluded from the account in the explanation of\nthe facts. I can appreciate this claim for a few of the sittings,\neven when I do not agree with it, but it was certainly incumbent\non Mr. Podmore, after his minute examination of the first two\nsittings, to test his suppositions, that he should show how the same\nhypothesis could apply to the specific and complicated incidents of\nlater sittings, and not content himself with a mere assertion. The\nsituation was one for Mr. Podmore to press the \" possibility \" of\nconscious fraud, if he wished to worry the spiritistic believer, since\nhe could make the most of the time over which the sittings were\ndistributed, and not to commit himself to so absurd a proposition\nas inference, chance coincidence, and suggestion for matter so pal\npably impossible on those hypotheses as the later sittings.\n(3) Mr. Podmore's serious and elaborate discussion of the statis\ntical summary, particularly in his limitation of the illustrations to\nthe sittings which he chose, shows that he either does not under\nstand the problem we are investigating, or did not notice what I\nhad said about the summary in the most explicit manner (pp. 116-118).\nI regard the statistical treatment of the problem involved in the\nPiper case as sheer nonsense, and indicated as much in the discus\nsion of it, intimating that I had made the table for the \"statisti\ncally inclined person.\" The problem before me was a psychological\nnot a mathematical one. No one would think of applying mathematics\nor statistical methods of this kind to the evidence in a murder case.\nBut it was necessary to throw a delusive sop to some of our experi\nmental psychologists who have a great friendliness for figures. If\nall the \" incidents \" had contained but one '\u2022 factor \" in an isolated\nsituation, there might be some apparent plausibility and excuse for\nstatistics. But even this would be pertinent only in the consideration\nof chance coincidence, and not to any other theory. \" Skilful in\nference and reproduction of information casually acquired \" are not\nsuitable hypotheses to be tested in any such way. Much less would\nthe statistical method apply to synthetic \" incidents \" such as those\non which I laid the whole stress of the argument. One complex\n\"incident\" might outweigh a hundred mistakes or false statements\nof the single kind.\nLet me take up special points in the review of the statistical\nsummary, (a) The hypotheses of chance and fraud are absolutely\nincompatible with each other when applied to the same data. Fraud\nimplies knowledge of some sort and chance excludes it. You appeal\n\f96 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\nto fraud only when you tacitly admit the striking and intelligent\ncharacter of your fact, and to chance when this is not so. If Mr.\nPodmore had confined his statistical study to the first sitting in the\nrecord, there might have been some plausible excuse for what he says\nof chance as applied to it. But his proper procedure was, according\nto his admission, that \" the precautions taken against the discovery of\nhis (my) identity seem to have been pretty complete \" in the first\nstance, to apply chance coincidence to this first sitting ; and unless\nthe same security against my identification is not admitted in the\nsecond sitting, to exclude it from that, if he wants to apply fraud in\nconnection with it, as he says that even the \" possibility \" of con\nscious fraud has not been excluded from it. That either or both\nconscious and unconscious fraud is applied to this second sitting is\nevidenced by what is said about my full name, and the \" possibility \"\nof this sort of thing is said to increase with the later experiments.\nYet in his application of the statistical summary which deals with\nthe matter as a whole, not in detail or in single incidents, he applies\nchance, not only to the second sitting in the first series, but also\nto the first sitting in Dr. Hodgson's series in my behalf more than\na month later. Now, considering that inference\u2014whether consciously\nmade from data obtained by \" passing in review the events of the\nfirst sitting,\" or subliminally made from data, however acquired,\nadmitting as Mr. Podmore does, that Mrs. Piper's trance intelli\ngence is unique\u2014is a fraud of some kind, we see that Mr. Podmore's\nendeavour is to apply fraud and chance to the same data. Carthago\nest delenda, whether the policy is consistent or not, seems to be Mr.\nPodmore's motto, (b) If Mr. Podmore had remarked the fact which\nI stated in my report, that I had the same security against identifi\ncation, so far as the mask was concerned, and independently of\ndetective agencies, at the second as at the first of my sittings, he\nmight have claimed some immunity in the application of chance to\nit. But he would be obliged to exclude fraud of all sorts from it,\nwhether conscious or subliminal. Granting, however, that the cir\ncumstances admit this application of chance, the case of Dr. Hodgson's\nsitting would still remain unequivocally against him, according to\nhis supposition that the \" possibility \" of fraud increases with the\nnumber and postponement of the experiments, and the statement\nthat \"skilful inference\" by this \"unique intelligence\" explains\n\" everything in the later seances that was true and relevant.\" (<\u2022)\nMr. Podmore ought to have seen that I was consistent and correct\nin the exclusion of chance from consideration when it is remarked\n\fxlvi.] 97\nReply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism.\nas the evidence of the record shows, that I had intimated as much\n\"possibility\" of fraud in my first sitting as in others, that I had\nconsidered guessing, fishing, inference, and suggestion, and rejected\nthem on evidence, and that I insisted on my treating the Piper case\nas a whole. (d) Mr. Podmore bases his treatment of these sittings\nin their statistical aspect, applying chance to the \" factors,\" not to\nthe \" incidents,\" that is, to the mathematical, not to the psychological\nview of the question. He expressly isolates the proper names in\nthese sittings from all contextual considerations and incidents, and\ndoes not even mention the fact of contextual relation in his summary\nof the facts, and treats the proper names as if they were the im\nportant feature, when I explicitly said that I attached no superior\nvalue to them (pp. 21, 173). He simply omits to remark for the\nreader the synthetic \" incidents \" such as I have mentioned above as\nassociated with my brother Charles in the first sitting, as good as\nany that led to identification in Appendix IV., and the unity between\nthe whole series, to which I called attention, and on which I had\nbased my opinion of the suggestiveness of the two sittings, (e) The\ndifficulties which Mr. Podmore encounters in the comparison of his\nreckoning in the statistical summary with mine are fully explained\nin the footnote (p. 115) which he apparently has not remarked. I\nleave this to the reader. The case is not based on the \" factors,\"\nbut on synthetic \" incidents,\" and I was careful to explain why I\neven mentioned the \"factors,\" to which I attached and attach no\nimportance other than that indicated. It is not the mere counting\nof correct and false \" factors,\" or \" incidents \" even, that determines\nthis problem, but the question of psychological unity and relevance\nin regard to the personal identity of the persons, either actually\npresent or masquerading as such in secondary personality, that deter\nmines the way the facts should be treated.\n4. Mr. Podmore says : \" The intelligence which inspires those\nmessages, whatever its precise nature, is certainly complex, and of\nan unusual, if not unique kind.\" This is said apparently with other\nrecords of the same case in view; for he begins the paragraph with\nthe statement: \"In considering generally from the evidential stand\npoint the utterances of Mrs. Piper's later seances,\" etc., in which the\nimplication is reasonably distinct that he includes in his \" evidential\nstandpoint\" at least the whole of the Imperator regime, so far as\npublished, and none of the detailed records even of this have yet been\npublished for any one's inspection. Let me note the following, (a)\nIf you are going to isolate my record from previous accounts of the\nG\n\f98 [part\nProfessor James H. Hyslop.\nPiper case in discussing the spiritistic hypothesis, the same must be\ndone in regard to every other. You cannot isolate it, as Mr. Pod-\nmore does, in order to disqualify spiritism and then connect it with\nthe larger whole to prove or illustrate an \" unusual if not unique \"\nintelligence. (b) If \"later stances\" include mine, this \"unusual if\nnot unique \" intelligence is admitted there and it is either not con\nsistent or not necessary to play with \" possible \" fraud, inference and\nsuggestion, as is done. These are very simple affairs in the \" ordinary\nprofessional clairvoyants.\" It is because they are not unusual or\nunique that the appeal to them has so much force with the public\nand with the scientific mind. But once grant a unique intelligence\nnot defined, and a supernormal faculty as proved in the Piper case\nat large, which is admitted by Mr. Podmore, and assume also, as he\ndoes, that the trance condition, in connection with which this super\nnormal faculty is usually found, prevailed at my sittings, and you\nforfeit the right to suggest without producing evidence suspicions\nand \"possibilities\" on the ordinary grounds, (c) What is the use,\nafter granting such an intelligence, and after showing reasonable\nevidence that the ordinary methods of mediums are not employed by\nMrs. Piper, of talking about fraud, etc., in abstracto, as if our only\nduty was to perpetually test the ordinary hypotheses ? When you\nhave once shown that there are facts which these do not explain,\nand therefore that the unity of the case includes the less evidential\nsituations, and that all reasonable criteria for the exclusion of the\nordinary methods of fraud, etc., have been satisfied, we then, in every\nother scientific investigation, proceed to examine and discuss the\ncase as a whole, and in the Piper phenomena the psychological\nanalysis of the record has its place. When we have once found\nthat our machine works rightly under test conditions, we do not go\non testing it perpetually in the same way. We put it to its proper\nwork. \" Das bestandige Wetzen der Messer ist langweilig wenn man\nNichts zu schneiden vorhat.\"\n5. Mr. Podmore evidently attaches much importance to proper\nnames. This is indicated by the stress laid by him on the failure to\nget them at all in some instances and on getting them imperfectly in\nothers. Here is where I think he entirely misses the problem as I\ndenned it for myself and as I think the spiritistic theory requires it\nto be conceived. Proper names are not the most important evidence\nfor a spiritistic theory. They are too easily explicable by fraud to\nhave any primary significance in evidential matters. In the\npsychological question they have only two considerations of interest\n\fXLvi.] 99\nReply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism.\nin favour of getting them at all. Firstly, they are corroborative of\nother and better testimony, and so afford a cumulative value.\nSecondly, they present the definite clue to the segregation of person\nalities involved in the \"communications,\" on any theory whatsoever,\nand to the discovery of the person whose identity may be concerned\nwhen the sitter does not know the facts. The real evidential crux\nconsists in those synthetic \"incidents\" which have a direct psycho\nlogical bearing upon the personal identity of a deceased person and\nagainst the probability of that selective telepathy from the memory\nof the living, for which there is as yet no adequate scientific evidence.\nProper names cannot supply this quaesitum. That they are not this\nand that they are not absolutely necessary to prove personal identity\nis apparent from the experiments recorded in Appendix iv. of my\nReport. When this is read with due care, it will be observed that I\nrefused to permit the names and relationship of communicators to be\nidentified to be sent to receivers of the message, except in one instance\nand that for a purpose, so that both names and relationships had no\nplace in the identification of personality. The result might be studied\nwith some interest to Mr. Podmore and his point of view.\n6. Mr. Podmore takes serious exception to my use of confused and\nfragmentary messages as evidence of personal identity. I laid stress\non them purposely, because there is no excuse for this character in\nthem on any of the hypotheses which Mr. Podmore makes so much\nof. They are against fraud, chance, inference and suggestion, especi\nally in the form in which they usually occur. If he had studied\nAppendix iv, as I intended every scientific reader to do, he would\nhave found there a definite anticipation and answer to the difficulty\nwhich troubles him. I had purposely constructed these incoherent\nand fragmentary messages to test the very question which Mr. Pod\nmore raises. Pp. 586-590 show occasional instances in which\nfragmentary messages succeeded well and the most specific and clear\nmessages failed. The same phenomenon is observable in this record\nbetween pp. 608 and 623 inclusive. I called special attention to this\nfact on p. 268 of my report, and italicised one very interesting\ninstance bearing upon the point at issue, namely, \"Question 7,\np. 619.\" It must be remembered that these experiments represented\ncommunications, most of them telegraphic, between living persons\nwhere we knew both ends of the line.\n7. I must note a number of important omissions by Mr. Podmore\nwhich affect the accuracy of his representation of my Report,\n(a) He does not tell the reader that I took precisely the same view\n\f100 [part\nProfessor Janus H. Hyslop.\nof the proper names in the first sitting, considered individually\n(pp. 21, 173), that he takes in a criticism which seems to imply\nthat I had not done so. (b) In regard to such reconstructions as\nthe incident of \" the trip to the lake after leaving the camp,\" he\ndoes not tell the reader that I condemned them as emphatically as\nhe does, and I did so right in connection with what he quotes.\n(c) He omits to tell the reader that I explicitly rejected the state\nment about the curved-handled cane with the initials in the end as\nnon-evidential and as having \"little or no importance\" (p. 61). I\nclassed the incident as false in the statistical summary, though it\nmay not be strictly so, but because I could not call it either true\nor indeterminate in the proper sense of the terms as defined.\n(d) Mr. Podmore omits all reference to and discussion of the syn\nthetic incidents on which I specifically laid the whole stress of my\nargument as the primary psychological question in the spiritistic\nhypothesis (pp. 158-176), and confines his attention generally to the\nsimple, false, and confused incidents which I had expressly repudiated\nas unimportant and non evidential, without telling the reader that\nI had recognised this apparent objection, and then claims that he\nhas fairly represented the whole. (e) He does not even allude to\nthe dramatic play of personality and my discussion of it, though he\nadmits the fact of Mrs. Piper's trance intelligence. This dramatic\nplay is a psychological phenomenon of some importance on any\ntheory whatsoever, whether of the spiritistic or non-spiritistic sort,\nand must be made intelligible as a functional and integral part of\nthe whole, and must be as explicable by chance, inference, and sug\ngestion as the apparently evidential incidents, if you do not expressly\nadd the supposition of peculiarly fiendish form of secondary person\nality to these processes. (\/) He omits all reference to my discussion\nof \" Mistakes and Confusions \" and the reasons for treating them as\nI did. They too must be rationally accounted for on the hypotheses\nwhich Mr. Podmore proposes, if they are to have any standing in\ncourt. The problem is not a mere matter of counting the true and\nfalse statements of Mrs. Piper's trance intelligence or of other\nmediums, but it is a problem of explaining the correct and incorrect\nstatements and confusions by the same general theory with the\nproper adjuncts from normal and abnormal psychology, which may\nbe fairly assumed in the case.\nIn conclusion I have only to say that, as I think no intelligent\nreader of my record will accept chance coincidence, inference, and\nsuggestion without conscious detective fraud as an adequate explana\n\fxlvi.] Reply to Mr. Podmore's Criticism. 101\ntion of the later sittings and incidents, Mr. Podmore would have\ndone better to have pressed the supposition of fraud as the only\nrational escape from spiritism or some omniscient telepathy. I\nshould not argue against the hypothesis of conscious and detective\nfraud. It is better not to have any theory at all than to propose\nsuch preposterous and unsupported suppositions as Mr. Podmore\nentertains. We are not obliged to have explanations. It is open\nto us to say that we do not know, or that we are not convinced, or\nthat the case is not proven.\n\f\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nPART XLVII.\nJanuary, 1904.\nPROCEEDINGS OF GENERAL MEETINGS.\nThe 120th General Meeting of the Society was held in the Hall\nat 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on Thursday, June 18th,\n190:!, at 4.30 p.m.; the President, Sir Oliver Lodge, in the\nchair.\nAddresses on Mr. Myers' \" Human Personality and its Survival\nof Bodily Death\" were delivered by Mr. Andrew Lang, Dr.\nWalter Leaf, and the President.

Very little of the matter thus omitted\nwas connected with the main trend of the communications\nintended for the sitter immediately concerned ; most of it\nhad no reference to or interest for the person attending\nthe sitting, and consisted chiefly of remarks casually and\nparenthetically interposed by Nelly (Mrs. Thompson's usual\n\" control \"), and to have retained them in their proper place\nin the record would only have interrupted and confused the\nmain narrative.\nI propose to rescue these omitted passages from an oblivion\nthat in my opinion they do not deserve ; and I shall also\nmake use of some material taken from some unpublished\nrecords of sittings, and also of certain impressions received\nby Mrs. Thompson when in a normal state, or, at least, when\nshe was not in trance.\nDr. Hodgson has expressed the opinion that, on the occasions\nwhen he was present at sittings with Mrs. Thompson, she was\nsimulating a state of trance. He has confined his expression\nof opinion to the six sittings which he attended, and has not\nsaid that he thinks that the trance is always fraudulently\nassumed ; nor, indeed, do I understand that such is his real\nbelief. I am not at all surprised that Mrs. Thompson's trance\nshould not have impressed Dr. Hodgson as genuine. So easy,\nand sudden, so entirely unannounced, as a rule, is the transi\ntion from the medium's waking to her entranced state, and,\nexcept on rare occasions, so free from any, at least apparent,\nphysical discomfort, and so alert her attention and behaviour\nduring the trance that to one accustomed to Mrs. Piper's\ntrance Mrs. Thompson might well appear to be shamming.1\n1 In his recent work, Hypnotism : Its History, Practice and Thtory, Dr. J. Milne\nBramwell maintains that, in some cases where only the very slightest hypnosis has\nbeen induced, and even where no certain trace of it has been detected, suggestion\nyields therapeutic results as striking as in the case of patients who have been\n\f10C [PAKT\nJ. G. Piddivgton.\nBut not only to one accustomed to the deep and dramatic\nform of trance displayed by Mrs. Piper might Mrs. Thompson's\ntrance be unconvincing, but also to one who, having had but\nlittle experience of mediumistic trances, was biassed by pre\nconceived notions of what a trance ought to be. Thus after\nmy first sitting I wrote to Mr. Myers as follows :\n\" As to the genuineness of her trance I have not enough\nexperience to pronounce an opinion of any value. . . . The\nmerely external characteristics of the trance could certainly\nbe simulated by anybody.\" Later on I was convinced of the\ngenuineness of the trance partly by the content of the trance-\ncommunications and partly by the fact that during the not\nbrief period of my acquaintance with Mrs. Thompson I have\nnever detected what on reflection I felt could be regarded as\na suspicions overlapping of her normal by her trance memory.\nI do not intend to discuss here the genuineness of Mrs.\nThompson's trance ; but, as reference has been made to the\nquestion, it may be of interest to quote a letter addressed\nto me by Professor James in answer to my enquiries about\nan experiment which I knew that he had made with a view\nto testing whether Mrs. Thompson when entranced was in\nsensible to pain. Professor James writes as follows :\n\" Our conception of ' trance ' is anything but definite, and\nI know of no test of genuineness.\n\" Anaesthesia may not be a sure sign of it ; and if it were\na sign it might, within limits, be easily feigned.\n\" Failure of pupils to react to light has been used to prove\nthe genuineness of hypnotic trance, and so have other neural\noddities. They certainly would prove an unfeigned and abnormal\nstate. The altered speech and the amnesia 1 are what are\n\u25a0understood by medium trance. Insensibility to violent pain being\nwith difficulty simulable, it would, if found, be presumptive proof\nthat the altered personality and amnesia were also unsimulated.\ndeeply hypnotised. Thus the view that the exercise of supernormal faculty need\nnot be accompanied by either profound or even slight trance would fall into\nline with Dr. Bramwell's observations if, with Myers, we attribute both response\nto curative suggestions, and supernormal faculties generally to the activities of\nthe subliminal consciousness.\n1 It will appear later that complete amnesia does not obtain in Mrs. Thompson's\nca\u00abe.\n\fXLvIi.] 107\nPhenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance.\n\" I subjected Mrs. T[hompson] to no violent pain, merely\npricked her lips and hands with a pin, without warning. Her\ndemeanour might have been feigned, but I doubt or disbelieve\nit. It tallies with the demeanour of Flournoy's case, and\ncombines with the general impression of sincerity which I\nreceive from Mrs. T[hompson].\"\nI have never attempted any pain test with Mrs Thompson ;\nand indeed in any case if she were shown to be not insensible\nto violent pain when in trance, it would only prove that\nanesthesia was absent, and not that the trance was feigned.\nThere is, however, besides Professor W. James' experiment,\none other item of evidence which goes to show that Mrs.\nThompson's trance may be accompanied by anesthesia, and\nthe case is none the less interesting because the anaesthesia\nwould seem to have been accompanied by the exercise of super\nnormal faculty. I am indebted to Mr. Norman Reeve, L.D.S.\n(London) of Bennett's Hill, Birmingham, for the account which\nfollows. Although posted on May 10th, 1899, and so dated,\nit was written on May 9th within half-an-hour of the incident\nwith which it deals, and was addressed to the lady who is\nnow his wife, together with a covering letter in which Mr.\nReeve wrote:\u2014\" I shall deal at some length with the visit on\nMonday to show that Mrs. Thompson and her sister were\nstrangers to me.\" In a letter addressed to me on November\n12th, 190;,, Mr. Beeve writes:\u2014\"I have enclosed the letters\nand envelopes accompanying [the account] with postmarks\nMay 10, 1899. You will see by the tone of the narrative\nthat the effect on me was neither slight nor transient.\"\nMr. Reeve's Narrative:\nMay \\0th, 1899.\nOn Monday morning [i.e. May 8th, 1899] I had an appointment\nwith Mrs. Arter from 1.30 till 3\u2014at 3 o'clock one with Annie Reeve.\nAt 1 o'clock a telegram came from Mrs. Arter saying she regretted\nshe was unable to come. At 1.15 two strangers called, sisters I\nafterwards found out; one of them, a Mrs. Thompson, wanted some\nwork done, and had come in quite by chance. I took them into\nthe surgery . . . Mrs. Thompson . . . placed herself in my hands,\nasked me to decide what was necessary to stop a couple of her teeth\nwith. Gold was required for one and a cement for the other; this\n\f108 [pakt\nJ. G. Piddington.\nI told her would be the best. . . . Mrs. Thompson . . . said although\nshe had had no breakfast she would have the gold filling put in\nthere and then. I proceeded at once with the work . . . after I had\nbeen working about a quarter of an hour I noticed that Mrs.\nThompson's eyes had become fixed, that she was entirely oblivious\nof anything that was going on. I asked if anything was the matter,\nand was she well? She pulled herself together and assured me\nshe was all right, and by 1.45 I had finished the operation. ... I\nmade another appointment for Tuesday at 11, and they left at 1.50\nby my surgery clock. At 2.50 my cousin Annie came in.\nThe next morning [i.e. Tuesday, May 9th, 1899] Mrs. Thompson\ncame in alone. The first words she said as she entered the room\nwere, \" Oh, Mr. Reeve, I did so want to ask you yesterday : have\nyou any relation named Annie Reeve 1 \" I told her if she had asked\nlast Friday I should have said no, but since I had seen and heard\nof her for the first time. \" Well,\" she said, \" I used to go to school\nwith an Annie Reeve, and yesterday as I sat in your chair her figure\nappeared before me as plainly as I see you now. . . . I was . . .\nabsolutely dumfounded, but within two minutes I had so far recovered\nas to be determined to sift the matter absolutely to the bottom. . . .\n\" Do you think,\" she said, \" if I described the clothes she wore, you\nwould recognise her from the description ? \" I answered that from\npeculiar circumstances I could tell every garment she had on from\n\"top to toe, from head to foot\" ; for, as you know, after our discussion\nat Solihull on Saturday I should take notice of everything she wore\nwhen I saw her on Monday. \"Well, she said,\" \"the form that\nappeared to me in this room was dressed in a tailor-made jacket, loose\nfitting, open at the front, wearing a stand-up collar, and a necktie tied\nin a sailor knot.\" I had by this time ceased to be astonished, and\ntold her that although she had described the garments fairly well,\nshe had not given the jacket its proper title. She said that it had\nno other description as far as she knew. I then told her it was a\nsack-back jacket. She then said as \"she had only seen the figure\nfrom the front she was unable to see to tell the cut at the back.\"\nHer next question was : when did I see Annie Reeve last 1 and\nI was obliged to admit that the very next person who entered the\nroom after she had left was Annie Reeve herself. Mrs. Thompson\nwent out at 1.50; Annie Reeve came in at 2.50.\n1 Mrs. Thompson then explained why she did not speak of her experience at the\ntime, i.e. on the Monday. Her reason is borne out by statements contained in Mr.\nReeve's full account, which have been omitted on account of their private character.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mr*. Thompson's Trance. 109\nShe asked for corroboration on my part, and I opened my appoint\nment-book and showed her \"Miss Reeve\u20143 o'clock.\"\nI proceeded with the rest of the work for her in the ordinary way,\nand after I had finished we had half-an-hour's chat. She then told\nme it was nothing new to her to have these metaphysical ex\nperiences. . . .\n(Signed) Norman Reeve.\nAir. Reeve had originally sent an account of the episode to\nMr. Myers. It could not, however, be found among his papers,\nand I, not thinking that Mr. Reeve would have preserved any\ncontemporaneous note of the incident, asked Mrs. Thompson to\nwrite me out her recollections of it. Her reply was as\nfollows :\u2014\nNov. 3rd, 1903.\n1n reply to your letter of to-day's date, I have not the account\nof my visit to the dentist, Norman Reeve, L.D.S., Bennett's Hill,\nBirmingham, but I have done my best to write out my account of\nthis affair. I think it is a great pity the letter from Mr. Reeve\ncannot be found, as it was written within a few days (or weeks at\nmost) of the whole thing happening, and a business man like Mr.\nReeve might not care to be bothered to write another. However,\nI will write out as best I can all that took place. It is more than\nstrange that the stopping of this very tooth has come out during\nthese last three weeks, and, as I thought of running down to Birming\nham for a night, I was going to call and have it replaced if he [i.e.\nMr. Reeve] is still at Bennett's Hill ; but now I think it would be\nwiser for me to keep away, if you intend to investigate the case, as\nI have no desire to be the one to refresh Mr. Reeve's mind. I think\nit would be better for someone else to call. I am afraid my account\nis rather jumbled.\nMrs. Thompson's Account.\nWritten from memory, November 3rd, 1903.\nI cannot remember the date, but probably 4 years ago I went to\nBirmingham to visit my sister, and wrote a letter the day or so\nbefore to my usual dentist making an appointment. This letter was\nreturned to me \"Gone, left no address.\" When I arrived in Bir\nmingham my sister met me, and I suggested, as I had a troublesome\n\f110 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\ntooth I must at once have stopped, we should go and find a dentist.\nWe walked across New Street to Bennett's Hill. (The rooms of\nnearly all the dentists are in this street, or were, years ago.) Two\nor three doors up on the right-hand side we spied a brass-plate with\nMr. Reeve's name, etc. I said : \" Oh ! this will do ; ' L.D.S. London '\ncan surely settle my tooth,\" and we went inside.\nI also attended the next day, and I am not sure if the following\ntook place the first or second visit, but I think the first. When\nthe dentist began to work upon the tooth it hurt very much,1 but\nI thought I must try to imagine I had no pain. I suppose he went\non just the same, but I felt nothing until I was roused by his hand\non my shoulder, and heard him say: \"What's the matter?\" I\ntold him I had been making myself proof against feeling any pain,4\nand he laughed and said : \" I wondered what was the matter with\nyou, as I know I was hurting you, and you were so still.\"\nWhat really happened was this :\u2014Directly I became insensible to\nthe pain I saw a young lady dressed (I remember this very well)\nin a tailor-made grey coat and skirt, and a linen collar.\nThe name, Annie Reeve, came into my mind, as when I went to\nboarding-school at Much Wenlock my first half-term was Annie\nReeve's last half-term ; and I felt certain this was the Annie Reeve\nI had known at school, though I had never seen or heard of the girl\nexcept just that half-term 14 years before, and did not recognise the\nface. I asked Mr. Reeve if he had a relative A. R., and so on ; and\nif she was still living and [if her] name [was] still A. Reeve. He\nsaid : \" Yes, she is my cousin, and was the last patient I attended to\nbefore3 you came in, and was dressed exactly as you describe.\" Mr.\nR. looked it up in his book and showed me the entry ; and no\n1Mr. Reeve writes on November 10th, 1903:\u2014\"I tilled a left upper central\ntooth with gold for Mrs. T. At first the patient appeared very sensitive to\nthe pain occasioned by cutting away the dentine, but quite suddenly appeared\noblivious of everything going on, so much so that when the operation was\nfinished I had to gently shake her.\"\n2 Mrs. Verrall has described to me how under similar circumstances at her\ndentist's she has been able by an effort of will to render herself insensible to\npain. The parrots who defend their want of interest or belief in psychic\nfaculties with a \"But what's the use of it all?\" might have to learn a new\ncry if this kind of self-induced anaesthesia became common.\n3 This should really be \"the next patient I attended to after you left\nyesterday.\" It will be noticed that the story has not improved with keeping,\nbut the reverse, as I believe is often the case.

R. in or out of the dentist's rooms, and if I met her to-day I\nshould not know her, and I thought it was the name Reeve which\nsuggested to me the name A. R. as that of the girl in grey. It was\nnot because I recognised her in any normal way. After all this\nlong rigmarole the points are :\u2014\nDoes Mr. R. remember writing to me for Mr. Myers? and if so,\ndoes he remember what he said about my not feeling the pain ? and\nalso does he remember the tailor-made dress and linen collar? and,\nlast but not least, does he remember me and my trumpery tooth-\nstopping ?\n(Signed) R. Thompson.\nI shall throughout this paper assume the bona fides\nof Mrs. Thompson's trance, and at the same time I shall\nabstain from discussing the source of the trance communica\ntions, and confine myself to describing what took place and\nto explaining, in certain instances, my reasons for thinking\nthat there is evidence for the acquisition of knowledge in\nsome supernormal manner. But as the record of any observer,\nhowever desirous to be scrupulously accurate and fair, may\nbe affected by the view that he may take of the phenomena\nwhich he is observing, I think I ought to state what my\nview of these phenomena is.\nNo theory of them satisfies me.\nThus negatively only can I state my view. And I can\nperhaps best indicate my position by confessing that after\nrepeated revisions of what I had written, I have given up\nthe attempt to define my opinions in despair. I do not halt\nbetween two opinions, but I shilly-shally between many : so\nmuch so that I hesitate to dignify such vacillation with the\nname of \" suspense of judgment.\"\nThough, as I have said, not avoiding critical discussion\nof particular incidents, my paper is chiefly devoted to an\nattempted classification of the phenomena. Such a method is\nboth way| : they check exuberance, but also ' rationalisation.' I submitted\nMrs. Thompson's account to Mr. Reeve, before he discovered his contemporaneous\nnotes, and he both confirmed and repeated Mrs. Thompson's error. The con\ntemporary account makes it quite clear that Miss Reeve's visit did not precede\nbut followed Mrs. Thompson's by an hour.\n\f112 [PAHT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nnaturally open to the objection that I may have twisted,\nmisinterpreted, or selected my material to suit conclusions\nwhich I wished to reach. I can only say that I have not\ndone so consciously, and that I pursued my study of the\nrecords with no theoretic axe to grind. The more thorough\nmy acquaintance with the facts grew, the more convinced\nbecame my belief in their authenticity ; and what had once\nstruck me as awkward and suspicious inconsistencies, now, as\na result of a careful sifting of the evidence (and not, I\nventure to hope, because I have talked myself round into a\ncredulous acquiescence), do so no longer. That from this\nprocess of classification an unforced and reasonable con\nsistency has emerged\u2014such as would not have emerged\nhad the phenomena been fraudulent\u2014is the underlying, though\noften unexpressed argument of this paper. I am perhaps\nopen to attack for not publishing in full the evidence with\nwhich I deal. In defence of this omission I would urge\nthat, though I do not by any means consider that there is\nyet a sufficient mass of evidence, or evidence of sufficiently\nvarious origin, to place the existence of supernormal faculty\nbeyond cavil or doubt, yet there is enough, both generally\nand in Mrs. Thompson's particular case, to create a strong\npresumption in its favour, and to justify an attack being\nmade on the problem from a different standpoint from hereto\nfore.\nFinally, I would repeat that I have been specially on my\nguard against selecting evidence in favour of any particular\ntheory of the phenomena, and against suppressing any evidence\nwhich might be held to tell against the integrity of the\nmedium.\nThe first I heard of Mrs. Thompson was through Mr.\nMyers, who wrote to ask if some sentences read by her in\na crystal had any meaning for me. At that time I did not\neven know of the existence of Mrs. Thompson, and I have no\nreason to doubt, and every reason to believe her statement\nthat she was then equally unaware of my existence.\nI give below Mrs. Thompson's own account of the inci\ndent, prepared for Mr. Myers at his request. (I should\nexplain that at the time when this incident occurred my\nsurname was Smith.)\n\fxlvii] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 113\nIt opens with the copy of a letter addressed by Mrs.\nThompson to Mr. Myers on November 8th, 1898:\n\"About 11.15 this morning I heard a little voice tell me to\nlook in the crystal. I say a little voice, but I could better\ndescribe it as a very weak adult voice, which was quite\nstrange to me; and as I was very busy sewing, I must say I\nrather resented the suggestion of spending my time crystal-\ngazing.\nThe voice insisted\u2014at least, I may say, commanded me. It\nsaid : ' Put away that work and take for my friend a message.'\nI did so, and taking up the crystal I saw perfectly the\nfollowing; altogether I was from 11.25 to 12.35 getting the\nwhole of the letters. They were in large ' block ' capitals,\nwithout any attempt at division into words.\n[The letters, transcribed in the order in which they ap\npeared\u2014though this was without division into words or\nspacing\u2014formed the following sentences :]\n'You cough like Noel Smith's acquaintance, that queer old\nbuffer doctor J. G. Walker. I am still eccentric, and keep\nmy eye on eccentric folk. His feet are better than mine,\nbut not his boots, eh Siwel.'\"\nI sent above to Mr. F. W. H. Myers, who with me\nthought the whole thing a stupid senseless message.\nWhen Mr. Myers was having a talk with Nelly on Novem\nber 10th, she said to him: \"Mr. J. G. Smith of Sloane\nStreet will know about that muddled message, which is from\na clergyman named Lewis.\"\nThat Mr. Myers had such a friend or that such a man as\nJ. G. Smith lived in Sloane Street was quite unknown to me.\nMr. Myers had such a friend, and wrote and sent on the\nmessage. This is the reply from Mr. J. G. Smith :\n\"I understand this is a confused message from a clergyman\nnamed Lewis\u2014(is it E. H. Lewis, or H. E. Lewis, or is eh\nsimply 'eh'?) and has some reference to me.\nProbably on Monday the 7th of November, or possibly on\nTuesday the 8th, about 11 a.m. my wife went to see a Dr.\nde Noe Walker. ... He is not her, or my, regular doctor,\nbut she consults him occasionally, but I have never seen him,\nthough I have heard a great deal about him from my wife and\nother people.\nHe is an exceedingly clever but eccentric homoeopathic doctor.\n\f11 + J. G. Piddington. [part\nHe was strongly recommended to my wife's brother-in-law,\nwho in turn recommended him to my wife\nAlthough he could have had one of the finest practices in\nLondon, he will only see a few people, mostly poor gover\nnesses, etc., to whom he charges no fee, and a few people\nwhom he charges 10s. a visit simply as a protection. . . .\nHis house is a veritable museum of pictures, statuettes, etc.,\nmostly Italian. . . . His house is also a regular ' Zoo ' of\ncats and birds, who are his first thought in life. When my\nwife went to see him at the beginning of this week she met\nhim in the street feeding his birds. Whereupon he said :\n' You go inside. I'll attend to you when I've fed my birds.'\nHe wears no socks, wears a red flannel shirt a la Garibaldi,\nover which he sometimes throws a curious kind of cloak. He\nwears no boots, but some peculiar kind of slipper.\nI need hardly add that he is as eccentric as a man can\nwell be. You will note that in order to read De No\u00e9 Walker\ninto the text one must substitute De Noe for Noel, and join\nto it the Walker which occurs further down the sentence.\n[And the initials J. G. must be transposed and conjoined with\nthe surname Smith.]\nMy wife knows nothing special about his cough.\n' Queer old buffer ' and ' eccentric ' suit admirably ; the refer\nence to feet and boots is perhaps to be explained by what I\nhave said above.\nI know no clergyman named Lewis, but perhaps Dr. De\nNoe Walker may have known one. I shouldn't dare to go and\nask him, . . . but next time my wife goes to see him I\nwill ask her to make enquiries.\nThe doctor is not an acquaintance of mine, though it can be\nsaid that I am acquainted with him.\"\nDr. Walker died before I screwed up my courage to ask\nhim if he had known an eccentric clergyman of the name of\nLewis. (If any member of the S.P.R. can supply the desired\ninformation, will he kindly communicate it to me ?) Assum\ning that the coincidences between the crystal-message, Nelly's\nexplanatory comment on that message, and the real facts are\nnot accidental (and I for one cannot regard them as such),\ntwo solutions only suggest themselves to me: (1) That in\nsome ordinary way Mrs. Thompson got to know of my wife's\nvisits to Dr. Walker, and reproduced this information in the\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 115\ncrystal-message ; (2) that the information was conveyed to\nher in some supernormal way through the crystal.\nThe former alternative seems to me improbable. I think\nit most unlikely that Mrs. Thompson could have learnt of any\nconnection between myself and Dr. Walker. I can't give my\nreasons; I even doubt if I could define them clearly to\nmyself, let alone make them clear to other people, but anyhow\nthat is my opinion.\nBut suppose that this odd scrap of information had reached\nMrs. Thompson accidentally, it is vastly more probable that\nshe would have learnt, not of my indirect connection with Dr.\nWalker, but of my wife's immediate connection with him.\nIs it possible that she learnt the facts correctly in her\nnormal state, and then muddled them in the crystal-vision\nversion ? Possible, but not very probable, I think, for Nelly,\nwho is aware of the crystal-vision, though she put Mr. Myers\non the right tack for obtaining verification, doesn't clear up\nthe muddle, and Nelly seems, as I shall show later, to have\nno difficulty in reproducing fully and clearly in the trance\nfacts known to Mrs. Thompson.\nBut Mrs. Thompson may have concocted this muddled\ncrystal-message with deliberate cunning, and with a view to\ndivert suspicions which might have been felt if the real facts\nhad been given with perfect accuracy. Well, if any one\nlikes to adopt that theory, I can't disprove it ; only I would\nrecall some words written by Professor William James about\nMrs. Piper (see Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 656): \"If it be sug\ngested that all this was but a refinement of cunning, for that\nsuch skilfully distributed reticences are what bring most credit\nto a medium, I must deny the proposition in toto. I have\nseen and heard enough of sittings to be sure that a medium's\ntrump-cards are promptitude and completeness in her revela\ntions. It is a mistake in general (however it may occasionally,\nas now, be cited in her favour) to keep back anything she\nknows.\"\nI should much prefer to believe that the correspondences\nwere due to chance than that the crystal-message was a\ncunning concoction of Mrs. Thompson's.\nWhatever the source of the crystal-message, and whatever\nits evidential worth, it has an interesting bearing on the first\n\fJ. G. Piddington. [part\nsitting which I had with Mrs. Thompson, for I cannot doubt\nthat a great proportion of the true statements made about me\nand my affairs and belongings at my first sitting were but\namplifications of, or deductions from, or happy guesses based on\nthis crystal-message.\n(2) Amplification of, and Deductions from, Knowledge\nalready in the possession of the medium or of the\nTrance-Personality.\nIf my interpretation of the oracular crystal-message is right,\nthe somebody or something responsible for it certainly knew\nfive things: (1) My surname; (2) my initials; (3) that I lived\nin Sloane Street ; (4) that there was some connection between\nme and Dr. de Noe Walker ; and (5) certain facts about Dr.\nWalker.\nThe date of the crystal-message was November 8th, 1898.\nNearly a year later, on October 28th, 1899, I met Mrs.\nThompson for the first time, going, with Mr. Feilding, to her\nhouse under an assumed name. I am not satisfied, for reasons\ninto which it is not necessary to enter, that the means taken\nto conceal my identity were effective ; but whether they were\nor not, it does not affect my argument that the greater part\nof what Nelly said about me at my first sitting can be re\ngarded as a mere expansion of the facts given in the crystal-\nmessage, or of facts which, though not actually expressed in\nthe crystal-message, may without impropriety be treated as\nlatent in the mind of the author of the crystal-message.\nThe stance of October 28th, 1899, opened in this way:\nNelly : \" Some one belonging to you has got neuralgia ; not\nyourself. I see white 'buses going in front of you all the\ntime. I get the influence of a lady with neuralgia. I think\nthere is a George in your personality. ... Is your name\nTod Sloane ? . . . You have a wife, but I can't see any\nchildren.\"\nNelly then suddenly addressed me as \" Mr. Smith,\" which,\nas 1 have said, was at that time my name ; and when neither\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 117\nMr. Feilding nor myself gave any indication that the name\nwas right, the medium wrote on a piece of paper the letters\n\"HTIMS,\" i.e. the name Smith backwards. I assume that at\nthis point\u2014it does not matter by what means\u2014the trance\npersonality had come to connect me with the Mr. Smith of\nthe crystal-vision.\nI will take these opening sentences of the trance-utterance\nseriatim.\n\" Some one belonging to you has got neuralgia : not\nyourself.\"\n\" I get the influence of a lady with neuralgia.\"\nThe only point of contact between Dr. de Noe\" Walker\nand myself was the fact that my wife was consulting him\non account of neuralgia.\nThe author of the crystal-message was aware of there being\nsome connection between the doctor and myself; and though\nwhat the connection was is not explained, it would seem on\nthe face of it likely that any one who discovered that there\nwas a connection at all would have discovered that the connection\nwas through my wife, and that she was being treated by Dr.\nWalker, and if so much was known, it is but a very little\nstep farther to assume that the particular complaint for which\nshe was being treated might also have been learnt.\n\" I see white 'buses going in front of you all the\ntime.\"\n\" Is your name Tod Sloan ? \"\nAt a sitting held on November 10th, 1898, Nelly had\nexplained to Mr. Myers that Mr. J. G. Smith of Sloane\nStreet would know about the muddled crystal-message. The\nwhite 'buses are an association of ideas with Sloane Street,\nobvious enough to any Londoner ; though it will be noted that,\nthough clearly latent in the trance-consciousness, the words\n\"Sloane Street\" were not actually mentioned. Obvious too\nis the association between Sloane Street (unexpressed) and\nTod Sloan ; though what are we to think of a little spirit\nsirl's familiarity with turf celebrities of the hour ? Nelly,\nI fancy, afterwards felt that the allusion to Tod Sloan was\nrather too incongruous, and needed some apology ; for two or\nthree months later she said to me : \" Do you know any one\nnamed Sloan ? You're the man I called Sloan. I expect\n\f118 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nthat was mother's subliminal called you that.\" (Of. \" Benson\n& Bensons Limited,\" p. 224).\n\" I think there is a George in your personality.\"\nMy initials J. G. and my then surname had been given,\nthough in a disjointed fashion, in the crystal-message, and\nalso had been clearly given by Nelly on November 10th,\n1898. The initial G. was correctly interpreted, much as in\nanother case where the initials E. H., which had been within\nthe medium's range of vision, were rightly read as Edward\nHorace by Mrs. Cartwright (see p. 178).\n\" You have a wife, but I can't see any children.\"\nMy comment on the reference to the lady with neuralgia\napplies equally to this sentence. The author of the crystal-\nmessage must, in my view, have been aware of the existence\nof my wife ; but need not have known that I had any\nchildren. As a matter of fact I have one child ; to whom\nNelly, since Mrs. Thompson made her acquaintance, has often\nreferred.\nThen came the first reference to \" Dorothy,\" on which I\ncomment elsewhere (see pp. 214-220). This allusion cannot be\ntraced to anything contained in the crystal-message. Nelly\nsubsequently attributed it to the momentary intrusion of\nanother spirit ; and in any case I am obliged to consider that\nshe turned at this point to some fresh source of information.\nI then gave to the medium an old coin that had been iu\nthe possession of my father for some years, and Nelly said\nit had been worn by a man of whom she proceeded to give\na personal description, and about whom she made in all six\nstatements ; four of which were correct, while two were possibly\nso.1 Still, these details were neither numerous nor distinctive\nenough to permit me to say that their correspondence with\nfacts was beyond chance. Then followed a prediction about\nmy wife's health, as if Nelly were harking back to the nucleus\nof knowledge on which the crystal-message was based. Not\nthat the prediction came true ; but Nelly, having at her disposal\n1 One of these four statements was to this effect : \" He has a dead Annie\nbelonging to him.\" For over three years I had regarded this as incorrect ;\nand it was only in September, 1903, that I learnt from a very old friend\nof my father's, who had known him from childhood, that my father had\nhad a sister Annie, who died more than 50 years ago (see pp. 152-3).\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 119\nthe fact of my wife's ill-health, could not resist the temptation\nof manufacturing a prophecy out of it. (See pp. 246-250.)\nA few more statements were addressed to me by Nelly,\nbut not one of them was right, and none were traceable to\nthe same source (whatever that may have been) as the crystal-\nmessage. With the exception, then, of the mention of Dorothy,\nand of the things given in connection with the coin, which latter,\nthough not without interest, must on the whole be dismissed\nas not sufficiently definite, it will be seen that the successful\nhits were such as might without any straining of probabilities\nhave been made by an intelligent being already possessed of\nthe information displayed or presupposed in the crystal-message.\nIn other words, it is not necessary, as far as an important\nproportion of the veridical communications is concerned, to\nassume that at the sdance of October 28th, 1899, any new\nsource of knowledge was tapped ; a sufficient explanation is\nthat knowledge held in reserve or latent was now brought\nforward, and that inferences were drawn from knowledge\nalready manifested.\nAs an instance of what I should call a happy guess rather\nthan a logical deduction, I quote the following:\nAt one sitting Mr. Feilding and a lady were present together.\nThey did not arrive together, but it would have been obvious\nto an observant person from their manner of greeting that\nthey were friends, and probably intimate friends. Mr.\nFeilding is a Roman Catholic, and this fact, if not known\nto Mrs. Thompson, might easily have been known to her.\nNelly almost at once observed: \"That lady and Mr. Feilding\nbelong to one another.\" And later on : \" And that lady smells\nof incense, too.\" The lady was a Roman Catholic, and it might\nbe imagined that the medium either by means of her normal or\na hyperresthetic sense of smell detected an odour of incense\nwhich might have been clinging to the lady's clothes. This is, of\ncourse, a possible explanation, in spite of the fact that the lady\nhad not been inside a church for ten days at least; but com\nparison of this with a similar case makes it more probable that\nthe allusion to incense was merely a symbolical way of saying\nthat the lady was a Eoman Catholic, for the same phrase was\nused by Nelly on another occasion when there could have\ni\n\f120 . J. G. Piddington. [part\nbeen no question of the medium's senses . being brought into\nplay.\nThe occasion was Dr. Max Dessoir's sitting on April 19th,\n1900. Speaking of a lady who she said was associated with a\nlocket handed to the medium by Dr. Dessoir, Nelly remarked :\n\" The lady used to be at school in a foreign country. Of course\nthat's silly. There's a little chapel inside the school. A' smell of\nincense.\" The statements of fact are wrong ; the lady was not\nat school in a foreign country, but in England, and there was\nno chapel inside the school, and there was no significance in\nthe reference to incense.1 It seems clear to me that all three\nstatements were deductions from the obvious fact that the\nsitter was a foreigner. The data were : this man, the sitter,\nis a foreigner, and he presents a locket. The train of\ninferential reasoning would have been somewhat as follows :\nThe object being a locket, the dead or living owner must\nbe a woman ; as it is presented by a foreigner, it is pretty\ncertain that the woman was also a foreigner ; and if a foreigner,\nthe chances are in favour of her being a Koman Catholic, and\nthat she was educated abroad, and very possibly at a convent-\nschool, and attached to the convent-school was probably a\nchapel ; and in the chapel incense would have been used.\nNelly recognises that the inference that the lady was edu\ncated abroad is so obvious as to be silly ; but she either does\nnot recognise or does not admit that the reference to incense\nis, if not quite so obvious, at least so obvious on reflection as\nto be \"silly\" too.\nA student of the phenomena of Mrs. Thompson or of Mrs.\nPiper would do well to exercise a little time and ingenuity in\ngoing carefully through the records of a few sittings, with a\nview to tracing how many of the statements contained in them,\nno matter whether true or false, can be referred to one or more\nparent stems. The point which I am making is not, of course,\n1 Since the above was written Mrs. Thompson, in the course of a conversa\ntion with me, made use of an expression very similar to Nelly's. Speaking\neither of a person or a place (I cannot remember which) she said she felt\nthere was a smell of incense about him (or it), and a\/terimrlh explained\nthat by that she meant the person (or place) was Koman Catholic. It\nwill be noticed that she used the symbolical expression first, as if it came\nthe more naturally to her.\n\fXLvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 121\noriginal, and has often been made before ; but it has not been\nenough insisted on, and I fear a careless reader is inclined to\nscan the record of a sitting and gather an impression from the\ngeneral effect produced on him by seeing a number of state\nments marked as correct or incorrect : counting up the \" W.'s \"\nand the \" R's,\" and by a simple sum in addition arriving at\nwhat he imagines to be the evidential value of a sitting. The\nmanner in which we are bound for the sake of convenience\nand preciseness to affix to each separate statement an affirma\ntive or negative comment no doubt tends to encourage such a\nsystem of reckoning ; but if any one really wishes to assess at\ntheir proper worth the strings of details forming the trance-\nutterances, he must not consider each detail by itself, but with\nan eye to their sequence and interdependence.\nThe chief difficulty is to decide how far inference can be\ncarried. Let us suppose that a middle-aged person attends a\nparticular sitting, and that the medium adjudges his age\nrightly to be about 45. An easy inference will be that the\nsitter's mother must be an elderly and quite probably an old\nlady ; likewise his father. That is inference the first. In\nference the second, let us suppose, might be (a) that the\nsitter's mother has or had grey or white hair, or wore a wig ;\n(b) that the sitter's father is or was bald or had white hair.\nOf course, neither of these inferences might prove to be true,\nfor both parents might have died young, or they might have\nor have had exceptionally luxuriant and healthy hair ; but in\na great proportion of cases they would be correct.\nThese, of course, are very simple examples ; but with some\ningenuity it ought not to be difficult to plan far more intri\ncate and less obvious deductions.\nLet us suppose, for instance, that our middle-aged sitter of\n45 attends a sitting in England in the year 1900, and is\nplainly an Englishman. He was born then in 1855, when\nhis father was, say, 30 years of age. In 1851 the father\nwould have been 26. The medium hazards a guess: \"I seem\nto see your father in a huge building of glass. There are\ncrowds of people. And now I see him looking at lots of\nthings, so interested in them ; and he's talking to a lady\nin a poke-bonnet who's leaning on his arm. And\u2014Oh ! yes,\nit's just like Hyde Park,\" etc., etc.\n\f122 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nThe middle-aged sitter, who doesn't seize the allusion to\nthe Great Exhibition of 1851, is not at all impressed until\non reading over the notes of the sitting to an elderly aunt he\nis reminded by her of the great interest which \"your dear\nfather took in the Great Exhibition. I remember so well his\ntalking to me about it. I was quite young in those days.\nAnd when he and your mother were engaged he used to take\nher there every Saturday afternoon.\" And aunt and nephew\nare both mightily impressed, though neither will admit it, be\ncause one thinks such trafficking with mediums not conformable\nwith strict piety, and the other because, as a man of the world,\nhe is unwilling to avow any belief in such things.\nNow, is my suppositious communication far-fetched? Cannot\nparallels to it be found passim in the records of trance-utterances?\nNot, indeed, that I wish for one moment to suggest, because\none may in certain instances be able to discover a train of\nreasoning that could have furnished a medium with a portion\nof his communications, that therefore the process was conscious\nor even that any such process was brought into play at all.\nAll I wish to urge is that any statements made by a medium\nin trance which can be accounted for in this normal way, even\nif they do not entirely lose their weight, must at least cease to\nrank as evidence for supernormal faculty.\nI am not losing sight of the cumulative force of a large\nnumber of details in themselves non-distinctive ; but even when\nthis factor enters into the problem, mere accumulation alone is\nnot enough to exclude chance, as much will depend on the\ncharacter of the details. If all the details, however numerous,\ncan be traced back to one basic fact within the ken of the\nmedium's normal or trance-consciousness, or perhaps to two or\nthree such facts, their cumulative force may not be entirely\ndestroyed, but it is at least considerably diminished.\nThere is another type of statement which may be explained\nas an inference from antecedent knowledge, though at first sight\nonly attributable to chance or supernormal power, which I will\nillustrate from my own sittings. The following statements were\nmade by Nelly about a lady whom she subsequently identified\nas my mother.\n(a) \" She used to be fond of doing white embroidery : cut\nlittle holes, and then sew them round. That makes like\n\fxlvil] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 123\nMadeira work. They use it for making babies' pinafores,\ndresses, and embroidery.\"\n(b) \" She had a funny little thing about five inches long\nlike a needle-case, only like a carved ivory umbrella. You\nscrewed the handle out, and you could put needles inside.\"\n(c) \" She has got a real Indian shawl in the possession of her\ndaughter still. Is Paisley Indian ? It's a bright-coloured shawl.\"\nAs regards (a), my mother, who was very clever with her\nneedle, did Madeira work, and did it well ; but, so far as my\ninformation goes, she was not particularly fond of it.\nWith regard to (b), my mother possessed a wooden needle-\ncase with a bone (not ivory) handle shaped like an umbrella.\nIt was about 5 inches long, and the handle unscrewed.\nWith regard to (c), there is in the possession of one of my\nsisters a white Chinese shawl that had belonged to my mother.\nBefore being in a position to comment on these three state\nments, I had to consult some members of my family. At the\ntime of the sitting the only statement which I thought\nmight have something in it was that about the needle-case. I\nseemed to have a hazy recollection of having seen such an\narticle in my mother's workbox, though on reflection I was\nlater inclined to accuse myself of having yielded to Nelly's\nsuggestion.\nWhat one may know subconsciously only Heaven knows ;\nbut consciously I did not know that my mother had pos\nsessed such a thing as a white shawl, and that one of my\nsisters had it still. There was not, however, a complete corre\nspondence between Nelly's statement and the actual facts.\nAs to the Madeira work, I had never known that any\nthing except an island, a wine, and a cake bore the name\nMadeira ; nor did Nelly's description given in answer to my\nenquiry enlighten me much. Now that I know what Madeira\nwork is, I think it possible that as a child I saw my mother\nengaged on it.\nNo doubt, especially at the first blush, these three coin\ncidences taken in combination are impressive, and for the\npurpose of my argument it would perhaps have been wiser\nto have chosen a less extreme example of what I conceive\nmay be the results of successful inference. Yet there is a\ncertain advantage in selecting for discussion what may per\n\f124 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nhaps be regarded as the utmost limit of ingenious deduction ;\nfor if it can be shown to be not outside the bounds of normal\nprocesses of thought, it follows that to less salient instances a\nsimilar treatment can be legitimately and confidently applied.\nApart from the fact that Nelly later on admitted that she\nhad suspected that the lady about whom she had been speak\ning was my mother, it is clear from the general tone of\nthe communications that throughout Nelly had in her mind\na person whose career on earth dated back a considerable\ntime, and one who belonged, roughly speaking, to the mid-\nVictorian epoch. Now the question is, to how many women\nwhose youth or middle age belonged to this period could the\nthree statements quoted above apply ? It appears to me that\nthey might be applied with a very fair chance of success to a\nvery large number of my mother's contemporaries.\nThe shawl, the needle-case, and the Madeira work : they\nseem to me almost as redolent of the mid-Victorian lady as\nwax flowers under a glass-case standing on a woolly mat\nare of the lodging-house-keeper of blessed memory.1 I was\nasking a friend and contemporary of my mother's the other\nday about Madeira work, and she said : \" Oh ! we all used to\ndo Madeira work in those days.\" And then the shawl. Look\nin the pages of Punch or at the illustrations of an Anthony\nTrollope novel and the ladies all seem to be wearing shawls\nat all times of the day, and under all kinds of circumstances,\nand I know some ladies of the old school even now who seem\nas unhappy apart from their shawls as a man from his pipe.\nI understand that such shawls, in spite of their modest appear\nance, were often made of some relatively costly material : which\nwould explain why, apart from associations, they might be\npreserved by a daughter of the wearer.2\n1 For an earlier period, cf. Pride and Prejudice, ch. viii. :\u2014' \" All young ladies\naccomplished ! My dear Charles, what do mean ? \"\n\" Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover skreens, and net\npurses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, . . .\"'\n2 After reading the above, Mrs. Sidgwick sent me the following comment:\u2014\n\"40 or 50 years ago Indian Cashmere shawls were much more common than\nnow, and were often very valuable, being heavily embroidered. The patterns\nof these shawls were imitated in Paisley shawls. I should think that many\ndaughters have their mothers' Indian shawls. I have one that was my\nmother's.\"\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 125\nAs for the ivory umbrella-shaped needle-case, I should class\nthis under the same heading as the Madeira work and the\nshawl : namely, under the heading of typical possessions or\noccupations of the mid-Victorian lady.1 There are fashions in\nneedle-cases as there are in everything else. A particularly\nfascinating or artistic novelty will have a great and relatively\nprolonged vogue. Needle-cases, workboxes, smelling-bottles,\nscissor-cases, pin-cushions, writing-desks, ink-stands, pencil-\nholders, blotting-pads, cigar-cases, cigar-cutters, cigarette-holders,\nmatch-boxes, and the thousand-and-one knick-knacks which men\nand women possess\u2014of each and all of these some ideal pat\ntern may be laid up in heaven, but the earthly artificer is\nevery year or so fashioning some novel image of the ideal\nneedle-case, let us say ; and an experienced manufacturer or\nretailer of fancy-goods ought, I should surmise, to be able to\ndate within- a year or two any particular specimen. But\nbecause a specialist might be capable of assigning to the \"objects\nof his trade the approximate date of their first appearance in\nthe market, is it reasonable to endow a medium with equal\ntechnical knowledge ? To answer with a bald affirmative would\nbe ridiculous ; but if the subconscious memory has been rightly\ndefined as \" half lumber-room and half King's treasury,\" stowed\naway in its lumber-room may well be many such trumpery\ndetails ; and if the lumber-room be a woman's, they may not\nlie in so inaccessible a corner as in a man's. Most women',\nso it seems to me, display an extraordinary power of observing\nand recollecting details about material objects. Listen to a\nman and a woman describing their reminiscences of their\nchildish or youthful days, and while the man will talk about\nwhat he has done or thought, the woman will speak of things\nwhich she has possessed or loved, and if she recalls an inci\ndent, as often as not she associates it with some material\nobject: a brooch, a watch, a picture, or what not. It would\nbe interesting to compare the trance-utterances of a male and\nfemale medium together ; for, if the subliminal memory plays\nany such part as I am here suggesting, references to personal\npossessions ought to be more numerous in the utterances of\nthe woman.\n1 Mrs. Verrall, likewise, writes :\u2014\" We had as children, about 1865, a similar\nneedle-case.\"\n\f12G [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\n(3) Mrs. Thompson's \"Controls\" and the Dramatic Business\nof the Trance.\nSo far as my experience goes, Nelly plays by far the\nmost important rdle in Mrs. Thompson's trances. Of the\nother regular control, Mrs. Cartwright, I have seen but little.\nMr. Myers had a high opinion of Mrs. Cartwright's powers,\nand was, I believe, glad when she took Nelly's place. The\nresults of her rare interventions at the sittings which I\nattended were not so successful as to make me regret their\nrarity. She seemed to me a good deal more interested, when\nshe did control directly, in uttering sesquipedalian words than\nin doing her best to communicate evidential facts.\nMrs. Cartwright is supposed to be the spirit of a lady\nwho was (not Mrs. Thompson's school-mistress, but) the\nproprietress of the school where Mrs. Thompson was educated.\nAs represented in the trance, she is the typical school-dame\nof caricature ; and indeed the Cartwright impersonation has\nnever impressed me favourably. It seems to me lacking in\nthe spontaneity of the Nelly and the \" Mr. D.\" controls ; and\nto be not unlike the sort of stereotyped caricature that\nschool-boys, and, I imagine, school-girls too, make of their\npastors and masters. I have known cases where, when once a\ntrue mimic has shown the way, a whole number of boys or\nundergraduates will, though incapable themselves of original\nmimicry, reproduce a rather wooden but on the whole\namusing and recognisable caricature of some unfortunate peda\ngogue.\nNow the Cartwright impersonation struck me as having\nmuch in common with this kind of conventional caricature ;\nand I felt as if the medium might be reproducing in her\ntrance a cut and dried delineation of her old mistress with\nwhich she had been familiar at school. Any one who is\nacquainted with the sort of stock caricature which I mean\nwill understand me when I say that one knew beforehand\nalmost the exact words which would be put into the mouth\nof the caricatured personage under any given circumstances.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 127\nIn the same way I felt about the Cartwright control that her\nmode of expressing herself on any given topic was inevitable.\nYet in spite of creating this effect of being a mechanical puppet,\nthis trance-personality aroused in me such feelings as one would\nsuppose could only result from intercourse with a human being.\nFoolish as such a confession may seem, I must in justice\nto the qualities of this control admit that she irritated me\nto so great an extent with her verbosity and pomposity that\nI was heartily thankful when she didn't put in an appearance,\nor when she disappeared after a short space of time. Her\nconversation was as distasteful to me as that of the most in\ndubitably alive of living bores ; and the dislike was, I grieve\nto say, mutual. There is, of course, a contradiction here: on\nthe one hand she produced the impression of the most\nmechanical of secondary personalities, while, on the other, she\nproduced the irritation which only a living individual ought\nto. I cannot explain the discongruity : I can but record it.\nYet if Nelly is not a mere secondary personality, no more\ncan Mrs. Cartwright be : for Nelly has no doubts about the\nreality of Mrs. Cartwright, and, so to speak, vouches for her,\njust as in Mrs. Piper's case G. P. vouches for Phinuit. The\npair of them must stand or fall together. And after all one\nmust recognise that it is a common enough experience in this\nworld to come across persons unfortunately and undoubtedly\nreal who strike one as mere puppets in their behaviour and\nin their mannerisms ; and this wooden type is to be found\nas often as not among prim old-maidish ladies who think it\nunbecoming\u2014indelicate, in fact-\u2014to let themselves go and be\nnatural spontaneous human beings.\nWhatever view one may take of Mrs. Cartwright as a person\nality, it is perfectly clear that she is working behind the scenes\nall the time. That she is no mere nonentity in the trance-\ndrama, to be brought on the stage only to create a diversion,\nwill be seen from the following quotations:\nSitting of November 29tk, 1899.\nIn answer to an enquiry which I made about materialisations,\nNelly said : \" Whenever a spirit materialises it is quite a\nspontaneous thing.\" And then added, \" Mrs. Cartwright dictated\nthat bit, and also about Alice James.\"\n\f128 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nOne might have fancied that the explanatory comment on\nmaterialisations was attributed to Mrs. Cartwright because, in\nusing language incongruous with the ordinary language of a\nchild, there was a desire on the part of the trance-consciousness\nto correct a momentary slip : but no such motive could have\nprompted the assigning of the statement concerning \" Alice\nJames\" to Mrs. Cartwright, and, as will appear, this was no\nsolitary instance, but a regular characteristic of the trance-drama.\nEarlier in the sitting I had handed to the medium a letter\nwritten by Mrs. William James ; and in connection with it\nNelly had among other things said : \" Alice James writes\nletters ; I've got to tell that.\" She had meant evideutly that\nMrs. Cartwright had told her to tell that.\nSitting of December 1st, 1899.\nAbout a lady connected with an object handed to the medium\nNelly said : \" She had one or two unsuccessful trips for her\nhealth. This is what Mrs. Cartwright says.\"\nThis is the only reference to Mrs. Cartwright throughout this\nsitting; and it occurs just when Nelly has made use of rather\n\" grown-up \" phraseology. \" Unsuccessful trips for her health \"\nis not at all in Nelly's style. If I might venture on a parody,\nNelly's way of expressing the same idea would have been\nsomething of this kind :\n\" You know Margate, Mr. Piddington. Well, the lady\nassociated with the hair used to go to Margate when she was\nill ; only it wasn't Margate, but a place like Margate.\"\nSupposing the statement had been expressed both in Mrs.\nCartwright's words, and also in the language which I imagine\nNelly would have used, I believe that the difference in the\nmode of expression would not have been due to a difference\nin the source of the information, and not altogether\u2014though\nperhaps partly\u2014to the difference in the stages of intellectual\ndevelopment represented by Mrs. Cartwright and Nelly re\nspectively, but chiefly to the Cartwright personality being able\nto receive general ideas, and to Nelly having to have general\nideas translated to her by means of charade-pictures into\nconcrete particular ideas. A close study of the trance-utterances\nhas convinced me that some difference in the mental processes\nof these, the two chief controls, is constantly exhibited, and with\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson'* Trance. 129\nan undesigned consistency so subtle that it is impossible to\nattribute it to deliberate artifice. Although this is the only\ninstance in this sitting where Mrs. Cartwright's participation\nis directly intimated, there is one other passage where Nelly\nrepresents herself as receiving information through another,\nthough unspecified, intelligence.\nNelly had been making various attempts to pronounce the\nname of the sitter, Dr. van Eeden, but had not got very near\nit. Then suddenly she remarked : \" Do you know van Eeden ?\nSomebody said that : somebody slipped in and said that, I\nthink.\"\nSimilarly, in Dr. van Eeden's next sitting, Nelly, in com\npliance with a request that she should try to tell the name\nof the favourite place of Dr. van Eeden's father-in-law, said :\u2014\n\"Am-felt\u2014Hamfelt\u2014Handfelt\u2014,\" and then after going off' on\nanother tack renewed her attempts at the name :\u2014\n\" I am trying to find the name. It's like Shovelt. It's\ndifficult. They have to say the word and tell Mrs. Cartwright\nand she tells me.\"\nThe \" they \" was intended no doubt to refer to the Dutch\nfriends and relations of Dr. van Eeden from whom communi\ncations were purporting to come.\nTwice in the sitting of January 23rd, 1900, the notes of\nwhich were taken by Mrs. Benson, Nelly quotes Mrs. Cartwright\nas her authority for two statements. The passage runs as\nfollows, and is worth giving in full because it illustrates very\nclearly Nelly's emphatic and apparently motiveless (motiveless,\nI mean, unless it really indicates the conveyance of knowledge\nto the trance-personality by some involved and not direct method)\nattribution to Mrs. Cartwright of certain of her assertions :\u2014\n\" Mother's brooch. This was her brooch, and belonged to\nmore than one generation. A lady\u2014two children died. Her\nown hair, and two dead children's hair made into a brooch.\nThe lady seems to be the third generation. Grandmother\u2014\nmother\u2014grandchildren. Mrs. Cartwright said ' Mother's brooch.'\nSome one telling me to say it was her mother's.\"\nAll the points here mentioned were true, but why does Nelly\nquote Mrs. Cartwright, or an undesignated \" some one,\" as her\nauthority for only one of these several correct statements ?\nNelly continues :\u2014\" The person who wrapped it up (i e. the\n\f130 [part\nJ. 6. Piddington.\nbrooch, which had been wrapped in a sealed envelope) was not\nwell when they wrapped it up. Inanition. Delicate\u2014not well\nat all\u2014wants nourishment. Mrs. Cartwright used the word. I\ndon't know.\"\nThe word meant is no doubt \" inanition,\" which would be\nout of place in Nelly's vocabulary. She uses it like a parrot,\nand though she translates it correctly, she appears to be un\ncertain whether her interpretation is right or not. The diagnosis\nwas quite accurate.\nThe sitting of February 6th, 1900, furnishes several good\ninstances of Nelly's dependence on Mrs. Cartwright's coaching.\nSpeaking of my mother she said :\u2014\" Without being religious\nshe was very fond of her Bible.\" (\" Religious \" in Nelly's\nsense means what is called \" goody-goody.\") \" The Bible to\nher was a comfort. She derived a certain amount of pleasure\nfrom perusing it.\"\nThis last stilted phrase made me prick up my ears, and I\nasked :\u2014\" Did Mrs. Oartwright say that ? \" and Nelly assented.\nBut when I have rightly suspected from the peculiar turn of\na phrase that Mrs. Cartwright is responsible for it, it has not\nalways been the affectation of the phraseology that has led me\nto detect the authorship, but often the manner in which Nelly\nhas the air of repeating words that she does not understand,\nor with which she is unfamiliar. She brings these phrases out\njust like a child who, having been entrusted with a message,\ndelivers it slowly and painfully in the precise words in which\nit was given.\nThen, again, later in the same sitting, Nelly, describing the\ncharacter of a relative of mine, delivered herself of the follow\ning :\u2014\" He was a harum-scarum, seek-your-luck man ; not in\na bad sense ; not a man who appreciated any form of civilisation.\"\nThe last phrase Nelly admitted in reply to my question was\nMrs. Cartwright's. Nelly's translation (or what I believe to\nbe her translation of something told her by Mrs. Cartwright),\nas in the case just referred to, came first, and the original on\nwhich it was based is given afterwards, as if Nelly is not quite\nsure of having conveyed the true meaning. In this instance\nthe \" original \" is correct and the \" translation \" wrong ; in the\nstatement about my mother and her Bible Nelly's translation\nis truer than Mrs. Cartwright's original.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena vn Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 131\nIn the case where the symptoms of the lady who wrapped\nup the brooch are mentioned, Mrs. Cartwright's \" inanition \" and\nNelly's rendering\u2014\" wants nourishment \"\u2014are about equally\nnear the mark.\nA little later, speaking again of the man who \" did not\nappreciate any form of civilisation,\" Nelly said :\u2014\" When he\nwent to school he didn't like the monotony of the ordinary\nscholastic routine.\" This pedantic expression I also rightly put\ndown to Mrs. Cartwright's account.1\nJust before this Nelly had been talking about a clergyman\nwho was said to have played a considerable part in my mother's\nlife. \" He was a friend : he seemed to do her some service.\nMrs. Cartwright says, ' Render her a considerable amount of\nassistance,' and she didn't forget it.\"\nNote the mixture of Mrs. Cartwright \" tout pur \" and of\nNelly's colloquial \" and she didn't forget it.\" Had Mrs. Cart\nwright completed the sentence, it would have run like this :\n\" He rendered her a considerable amount of assistance, of which\nshe preserved a life-long and most grateful recollection.\"\nDuring this sitting my mother was represented as communi\ncating through Nelly, and once Nelly professes to repeat her\nactual words. The words thus repeated are the words of a\ngrown-up person, and yet not such as Mrs. Cartwright\nwould have used to express the same idea. My mother is\nsupposed to be referring to the man who \"did not appreciate\nany form of civilisation,\" and Nelly reports as follows :\u2014\" Oh I\ndear, the lady says ' he was an unorthodox person.' \"\nThe interest of this expression to me is that I have myself\nheard this precise phrase in the sense of \" unconventional \" used\nof this precise person by a sister of my mother. Nelly does\nnot father this phrase on to Mrs. Cartwright, as in other cases\nwhere she has employed a phrase not in keeping with her\nusual simple style, but appropriately on to another spirit and\nwith, at least for me, most telling effect.\nMrs. Cartwright would never have said : \" Oh ! dear, he was\n1The way in which these passages are strung together may create the\nimpression that I was responsible for suggesting to the trance-personality\nthis particular bit of by-play.

I draw attention elsewhere (see p. 212) to a\n\u25a0case where Nelly appears to have remained in ignorance for\nsome time of a fact known to Mrs. Cartwright, and I have also\n\u2022described (see p. 173) a tiff between the two ; and it only remains\nfor me here to put on record two grammatical slips made by\nthat otherwise immaculate stylist, Mrs. Cartwright ; and both,\nI regret to say, occurred at the sitting which had been enlivened\nby the tiff, and at which Nelly, who was very sore, complained\nthat Mrs. Cartwright had criticised her culture :\u2014\" Mrs. Cart\nwright says I'm illiterate.\"\nNelly's grammar, it is true, is not above reproach, but, in\nspite of her choice diction, no more is Mrs. Cartwright's. I\nhad handed to the medium a cap, and Nelly failed to give\nmore than one, though that a very essential, fact about its\nowner, so Mrs. Cartwright undertook to come to the rescue, and\n\u2022expressed her intention as follows :\u2014\" With regard to that cap,\nSir, I'm not prepared with any information about it ; but I will\n(sic] be able to fathom it out for you. It may be even now\none or two months before I can give details about it, but I\nshall eventually do all that you desire.\"\nNote the \" I will be able.\" This is not the language of a\npurist. But a more palpable error occurred in the same sitting.\nI was the only person present, and Nelly had been giving facts\nabout Archbishop Benson, although I had not handed to the\nmedium any object associated with him. Mrs. Cartwright broke\nin in reproving tones :\u2014\n\" I'm afraid that child (i.e. Nelly) has been strolling out of\nher usual path, and not attending to the usual round. I refer\n\u2022to the Archbishop, you know. It was not given when the\n\fxLvn.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 133\nrelative of the person, or any article belonging to the person\nwas present. It is only us [sic] higher spirits who do not\nhave to make use of material objects in order to obtain\ninformation. You must not allow her to talk of trivial subjects,\nbut send her back to us. Things that you make use of as\nevidence seem rather debasing to us.\"\nI have quoted more of the passage than was necessary to\nshow the grammatical error involved in using \" us spirits \"\nin the nominative, as it is an admirable illustration of Mrs.\nCartwright's high-falutin' and consequential style. If it\nshould be argued that these occasional grammatical lapses are\ndue to what Dr. Hodgson calls a defect in the machine, I\nwould reply that though Nelly's speech is slangy and incorrect\n\u2014in keeping with her character, for she is half Puck, half\ngamin, though entirely lovable\u2014not only is Mrs. Thompson's\nlanguage vastly more refined and accurate than Nelly's, but\nthe \" Mr. D.\" control, who has occasionally spoken with great\nfluency and ease in my presence, talks as good English as one\ncan wish to hear.\nThe occasional mistakes of Mrs. Cartwright are not at all\ndifficult to reconcile with the theory that she is the spirit\nof a middle-class woman of imperfect education (it should be\nborne in mind that she was not a teacher, but the proprietress\nof a school), who piqued herself upon her superior command\nof language ; but it is not quite so easy to explain them if\nshe is a secondary personality ; for if \" Mr. D.\" can be made\nto speak correctly, why not Mrs. Cartwright also ?\nSitting of February 1st, 1900.\nThere had been a break in the trance of long duration,\nover an hour and a half in fact. Shortly before the medium\nwas re-entranced she said she thought Mrs. Cartwright might\nbe coming to control. Later on Mrs. Cartwright did control ;\nbut she was preceded by the control whom I call here \" Mr.\nD.\" This control spoke only a dozen words, and disappeared.\nNelly then came on the scene for a moment to say that\nMr. D. had made a mistake, and added that Mrs. Cartwright\nwould explain better than herself what had happened. Mrs.\nCartwright's explanation was that she could not explain Mr.\nD.'s sudden and confused intrusion ; and then the matter\n\f134 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\ndropped. But the episode was an interesting one to witness,\nfor the change of controls was effected very rapidly and with\ncomplete ease, only a moment's silence between the going\naway of one and the arrival of the next ; the medium displayed\nno symptoms of physical discomfort, and the alterations of\npersonality, occurring as they did within the space of a minute\nor two, brought out into strong relief the distinctive features\nof these the three principal controls. Mr. D.'s intrusion was\nmost lifelike and natural, his behaviour and slight discomposure\nweie just like those of a person who has entered a room by\nmistake and found a stranger in it.\nBut Mrs. Cartwright is not the only spirit whom Nelly\nrepresents as being, as it were, behind the scenes during the\nprogress of the trance phenomena and assisting in the play.\nThroughout the whole series of sittings, even where it is not\ncategorically stated, Nelly evidently means it to be inferred\nthat she is often in direct communication with other spirits,\nas, for instance, the friends of the sitters. The directness of\nthe intercourse seems to vary ; at one instant she appears\nto be quoting their actual words, and at another to be drawing\nfacts out of them without their knowledge or approval. Dr.\nvan Eeden failed to appreciate this complex phase of the\nphenomena, and was led to give expression to an opinion\nwhich is I believe unfounded. He writes (see Proceedings,\nPart XLIV., p. 84):\n\" I feel sure that genuine direct information is far rarer\nthan the medium believes, and in good faith would have us\nbelieve.\" [I take it that \" the medium \" here means \" the\nmedium in trance,\" i.e. the trance-personality.] \" I hold that\na certain amount of unconscious play-acting is nearly always\ngoing on.\"\nAnd again (ibid., p. 82), \"I could follow the process and\nperceive when the genuine phenomena stopped and the uncon\nscious play-acting began. In hardly perceptible gradations\nthe medium takes upon herself the role of the spirit, completes\nthe information, gives the required finish, and fills in the gaps\nby emendation and arrangement.\"\nThis is in my view a misreading of the situation. Play\nacting of a sort there may be : though to apply such a term\nto genuine phenomena is not very illuminating.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 135\nNelly does not try to pass herself off as another communi\ncating spirit, nor to represent as coming directly from another\nspirit information which she has herself acquired telepathically\nor clairvoyantly, let us say, or at any rate in some way\nother than by direct and mutually conscious intercourse with\nanother spirit. Indeed she sometimes is at pains to guard\nagainst any misconception of this kind arising, and after\nhaving jumbled up messages from a spirit with other facts\nlearnt by herself she will carefully differentiate the one from\nthe other, and at the same time intimate that the more\nauthentic of the two are the facts derived directly from the\nspirit.\nIt is true that if Nelly's exact words are not caught,\nit might appear sometimes as if she were trying to pass\nherself off as another spirit ; but there is, I am convinced,\nno intent to deceive here, the confusion is due to the com\npulsion she feels to get things \" off her chest.\" I use\nthis slang phrase advisedly, because I think it hits off the\nsituation. She either comes to a sitting primed with facts\nwhich she feels she must divulge before she has time to\nforget them, or else a sentence reaches her couched in the\nfirst person singular, and she repeats it just as she\nreceives it except for transposing it into the third person,\nor gives it in the first person with the prefix \" he \" or \" she\nsays.\" Her chief anxiety is to give statements of fact, aud\nother considerations are only secondary. But to any one\nfamiliar with Nelly's style it is nearly always clear when she\nis purporting to be in direct communication with a spirit\nand when not ; though very occasionally there are indications\nthat Nelly is herself unaware of the source of her knowledge.\nIn support of what I here maintain I append some quota\ntions, by no means all that might be cited, but selected\nspecimens. These quotations will also serve to illustrate the\ndifferent methods by which Nelly claims to obtain information.\nSittinrj of December 4th, 1899.\nDr. van Eeden asks for details about his father-in-law.\nNelly at once makes a statement, which perhaps had some\nsignificance. Thereupon Dr. van Eeden asks, \" How do you\nknow i \" and Nelly replies, \" He says ' My son is a doctor.' \"\nK\n\f136 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nShe then goes off on to another topic, but Dr. van Eeden\nbrings her back to the subject of his father-in-law again, and\nmore statements are given as coming from him, or rather it\nis to be so inferred from the style in which they are made.\nThen Nelly says, \" He has somebody belonging to him ill now,\nnot very ill, has to lie down and be careful.\"\nDr. van Eeden :\u2014\" How do you know ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" I see a picture of a lady lying down ; she ought\nto be in bed. She's not well at all.\"\nHere it will be noticed that Nelly does not claim to have\nderived the (correct) fact about the invalid lady directly from\nDr. van Eeden's father-in-law, but from a (clairvoyant) picture.\nYet a few sentences later she names him as her authority for\nanother (also correct) statement, and again goes on to complain\nthat he does not pronounce a foreign name which she is\ntrying to get sufficiently clearly for her to catch it.\nSitting of December 4th, 1899. (Evening.)\nNelly describes the symptoms of a friend of Dr. van Eeden's,\nand adds, \" This is a description. I can ask him.\"\n\" A description \" in Nelly's lingo means that she is seeing\na picture in contradistinction to receiving information direct\nfrom a spirit. She then gives further details about the same\nperson, some true and some false, and Dr. van Eeden asks her\nif the spirit is himself speaking to her. \" Yes,\" replies Nelly,\n\" but yet I can't say he does. He speaks to some one who\ntells me.\"\nIn connection still with the same spirit more facts were\nbeing given, Nelly speaking slowly as if repeating the words of\nan informant. This led Mrs. Verrall, who was recording, to\nsay, \" He is speaking now, is he not ? \" Nelly assents, but\nnevertheless she was using the third person, not the first.\nSitting of January 18th, 1900 (Mr. Wilson's First Sitting).\nThe trance was twice broken. In the first part the chief\nsubject of the communications, Miss Clegg, is not represented\nas being present ; at the beginning of the second part she is\nsaid to have come to Nelly in the interval and told Nelly to\nask for her ring to be given to the medium. In the third\n\fxlvii.J Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 137\nshe is supposed to be communicating not directly, but through\nthe intermediary of Nelly.\nSitting of January 23rd, 1900 (Mrs. Benson's Second Sitting).\nAt no time throughout this sitting is any spirit represented\nas communicating either directly or through Nelly, but at the\nclose of it Nelly remarks: \"When I can find the young man\nhe will tell me all about it. He's very interested, but not\nquite convinced, rather guarded. In his heart rather religious\nscruples about me talking.\"\nNelly here is careful to point out unasked that on this occa\nsion the \" young man \" (i.e. a deceased son of Mrs. Benson's\nwho had been mentioned at her first sitting) is not himself\ntaking any part in the trance-communications ; yet she ap\nparently claims to have met him in the spirit-world, and\nexpects to meet him again.\nSitting of January 25th, 1900.\nAt this, Mr. \"Wilson's\" second sitting, Miss Clegg was again\nthe chief subject of the communications, but not until the end\nis she represented as being within close enough range of Nelly\nto allow of the direct transmission of messages. At one point\nNelly says : \" She isn't a lady who takes notice when I tell\nher I'm talking ; \" and then somewhat later she makes a state\nment which is in superficial contradiction at least with the\nlast : \" I couldn't find the lady anywhere. I could only find a\nbrother of this gentleman (i.e. Mr. Wilson) who died, etc.\"\nAnd then she turns to the sitter and says : \" Will you come\nand talk secrets ? Perhaps the lady will come in a minute.\"\nTowards the end the lady seems to get into closer relation with\nNelly, for after saying, \" Somehow or another I think that lady\nsent a message,\" Nelly proceeds to deliver four messages for\nMr. Wilson, and although it is not definitely stated that Miss\nClegg's words are being repeated textually, yet the messages\nare worded in a way which not only suggest, but I have no\ndoubt were intended to suggest, that they emanated consciously\nfrom the spirit.\n\f138 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nSitting of February 1st, 1900.\n1 was the only person present at this sitting. The medium\nwas entranced very quickly, and before I had time to hand\nany object to her, Nelly spontaneously started off on subjects\nconnected with Mrs. Benson\u2014spontaneously, that is, in the sense\nthat I had not suggested the topic to her, though possibly it\nwas suggested to her by Mrs. Thompson having shown me before\ntrance began an entry in her diary recording a communication\nmade to her by Nelly about Archbishop Benson. Possibly,\nhowever, this is an example of Nelly's anxiety to unburden\nherself of an accumulated store of facts before they have time\nto fade from her memory ; for she remarks early in the sitting,\n\" I have been working hard, finding out about all these people.\"\nThen, after a very brief digression, she reverts to Mrs. Benson's\nbelongings :\n\" I've still got the ecclesiastical on my mind. There's an\necclesiastical standing by you (i.e. by J. G. P.). He has got a\nnight-shirt on\u2014a respectable night-shirt\u2014loose, blue sleeves ;\nno, balloon sleeves\u2014ribbon tied round\u2014full all round. Broad\nface.\"\n\" Is he really there ? \" I ask, \" or do you see a picture of\nhim ? \"\n\" He's showing himself so that I can describe him. He's\nrather unapproachable. I can't ask him anything.\" ...\" He's\nnot a talking gentleman. He's asking for you.\" (This second\nassociation of Archbishop Benson with myself is quite mean\ningless, and I think it possible that it is to be explained by a\nmomentary forgetfulness on Nelly's part that I and not Mrs.\nBenson was the sitter. Cf. p. 213.)\nThen follows another description of the spirit's dress ; and\nafter this he is said to be asking for some information about\nsome one named Christopher; but in the middle of the refer\nences to Christopher Nelly interjects this odd remark ; \" He's\nalmost like a queen. He's talking to the. Queen like a great\nman.\" I call it odd, because almost in the same breath Nelly\ndescribes a past event in the life of the spirit and what he is at\nthe moment engaged upon in the spirit-world, both equally in\nthe present tense. It is a fine chronological jumble, but at the\nsame time an instructive one, for it bears witness to the com\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance 139\nplexity of the processes employed by the control and tells in\nfavour of the spontaneity of the phenomena.\nThe two processes which I believe were in operation\u2014perhaps\nin simultaneous, and anyhow in rapidly successive operation\u2014\nwere converse, direct or telepathic, or both, between the trance-\npersonality and a spirit, and clairvoyant perception of facts\nabout this spirit. I do not mean that I hold that to be the\nreal explanation of the phenomena, but I do hold that the thing\npresents itself to the trance-personality somewhat as I describe,\nand that whether spirits be involved in the matter or no, know\nledge reaches the consciousness of the entranced medium in the\nmanner stated or adumbrated in the trance-utterances, and that\nthere is nothing to show that there is any play-acting on the\npart of the trance-personality, and, on the contrary, much\u2014\nespecially in the artless consistency of the allusions to . the\nmodus operandi\u2014to disprove it.\nAt the conclusion of the references to \" Christopher,\" Nelly,\nalluding to the spirit from whom the Christopher messages\npurported to come, said : \" He doesn't like me to talk. He\nhas got religion in his heart and won't talk to me. He says\nhe's tolerant to all men. . . .\" (Here came an interjected\nremark about an object connected in no way with Mrs. Ben\nson.) \" He nearly said he had many cranks to deal with\nin his lifetime. I don't like him to be so consequential.\"\nAfter this Nelly went off to entirely different topics ; and\nsubsequently Mrs. Cartwright expressed her disapproval of\nNelly having attempted to talk of matters concerning Mrs.\nBenson when she was not present ; as if she wished to indi\ncate that Nelly had been exceeding her powers in trying to\nget within range of spirits belonging to Mrs. Benson's sur\nroundings, when the conditions were not favourable. In any\nevent it is obvious that Nelly was in a confused state of mind\nas to whether she was holding converse or not with the spirit\nabout whom she was speaking. First she says he is showing\nhimself in order that she can describe his personal appear\nance, then that he is rather unapproachable, and that she\ncan't ask him anything, next that he is asking a question and\nsending a message, and that he doesn't like to talk, and, not\nwithstanding, finally reports observations which he apparently\naddresses to her.\n\f140 [PAltT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nIt is best to record these puzzling and complicated state\nments without seeking to explain or reconcile the contradictions.\nI would offer only one reflection, namely that, whatever diffi\nculties these complexities may raise on the assumption that\nthe phenomena are either what they are represented to be, or\nare at any rate supernormal, as great difficulties arise on the\nassumption that the phenomena are fraudulent ; for, though an\nimpostor might introduce complexities through a momentary\nfailure to carry through with perfect consistency either an\nelaborate or a simple scheme of mystification, neither from cal\nculated artifice nor from want of skill would so erratic a\nportrayal of the methods of spirit communication be likely to\nresult as we are offered in the foregoing instance.\nSitting of February 6th, 1900.\nAt the end of this sitting another method by which Nelly\nobtains information is disclosed. I alone was present, but, as\nat the previous stance, Nelly referred to Mrs. Benson's affairs\namong others.\nJust before the trance concluded she said : \" Canon, then\nBishop Bowlby, he came and talked through mother. You\nknow that old gentleman, Mr. Benson, he was an extreme friend\nof his. He told mother. He has been talking to mother.\"\n(For comments on other aspects of this episode, see p. 174.)\nHere the source of Nelly's information seems to be the medium\nherself, rather than Bishop Bowlby, for Mrs. Thompson, when\nshe awoke, repeated what Nelly had said, with the exception\nof one assertion, namely, that the prelate \" was very pompous,\"\na fact which she would hardly be expected to have learnt from\nthe man himself.\nAs this again sounds intolerably \" anthropomorphic,\" I once\nmore guard myself against a charge of accepting the phenomena\nat their face value, and emphasise the fact that my aim here\nis to render a roughly systematised account of the trance-drama\nas depicted in the trance-utterances.\nSitting of April IWi, 1900.\nDr. Dessoir was the sitter on this occasion, but interspersed\namong communications addressed to him were frequent refer\nences to my own affairs. My mother, too, was represented as\n\fXLVIi.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 141\ntaking an active part on the other side in the effort to com\nmunicate. She suggests to Nelly that she should ask Dr.\nDessoir for a certain object, and Nelly adds : \" I don't under\nstand, but somehow the old lady belonging to you is interested\nin finding out things for this gentleman.\"\nAnd then again later she is said to have been talking to\n\" Mr. D.,\" \" but she didn't think him such an angel as we do.\"\nYet later on, when the medium was holding an object that\nhad belonged to my mother, Nelly complains that she seems\n\" rather indistinct,\" adding, however, as if in explanation, \" she\ncouldn't talk very distinctly before she died.\" This, I believe,\nwas not the ease ; but it may have been a conjecture of Nelly's\nto account for the inaudibility of the spirit's conversation, for\nshe creates the impression of reporting scraps of information\nwhich are being told her by the spirit, and which she has\ngreat difficulty in catching. Here, as elsewhere,, it is clear\nthat when spirits are represented as \" present,\" or within ear\nshot, or within visible range of Nelly, their proximity fluctuates\nspasmodically and capriciously ; they flit into focus and out\nagain like figures in a cinematograph.\nSitting of May 1st, 1900.\nThis was Mrs. Benson's third sitting, and though, as described\nabove, Archbishop Benson had formerly been supposed to have\nbeen within near enough range for Nelly to describe his ap\npearance, and to repeat messages sent by him, on this occasion\nit is expressly and spontaneously denied by Nelly that he is\npresent.\n\" The person belonging to it isn't here a bit. I see a bright\ncolour, though confused.\"\nAt the end of the sitting a dramatic scene occurred (see\np. 212), in which Nelly displays great agitation in conse\nquence of discovering\u2014what Mrs. Cartwright already knew\u2014\nthe identity of \" the clergyman who wears the night-shirt over\nhis clothes.\"\nFollowing on the long delayed discovery came another passage\nof considerable dramatic vividness :\u2014\nNelly :\u2014\" What is this ? He wants to say\u2014Mrs. CartWright's\nsaying it out loud. She can't say it out loud. Write it \"\n\f142 [I'ART\nJ. G. Piddmgton.\n(these two last words seemed to be addressed by way of advice\nby |Nelly to Mrs. Cartwright.) (The medium here took a pencil\nand paper and wrote, apparently under the stress of much\nagitation, as follows:\u2014\n\" He desires me to convey to you his intention to tell you\nof his private life apart from his public one. If possible alone,\nMay 30th.\")\nNelly :\u2014\" He doesn't want you {i.e. Mr. Myers) to hear, or\nany one : he is very certain. Mrs. Cartwright fetched him out.\nHe doesn't want any one to be there. Mrs. Cartwright has\nmade him promise that. Very important. May 30th. The\nGrey Lady wants to take me home.\"\nThus it will be seen that throughout this sitting the spirit\nabout whom facts are being given never comes within Nelly's\nrange at all.\nShe sees him only as a bright colour in the distance. Mrs.\nCartwright, however, gets into closer relations ; she \" fetched\nhim out,\" and is the bearer of a message from him, which she\nconveys not by speech, but by writing. Nelly repeats verbally\nthe substance of the message, and then announces that \" the\nGrey Lady \" (a spirit who plays a subordinate part in the\ntrance-drama, see p. 147) has come \"to take her home.\"\nSitting of May 30th, 1900.\nIt might have been expected on any hypothesis of the pheno\nmena after this very definite and impressively made appointment\nthat on May 30th the Archbishop would have been represented,\nat the least, as in direct and easy communication with Nelly,\nand had he controlled directly no surprise could have been felt.\nYet as a matter of fact neither of these two things took place.\nMrs. Benson sat with Mrs. Thompson alone, acting both as\nsitter and recorder, in order to satisfy the desire for privacy\nexpressed at the last seance. There were good things in the\nsitting, but it was neither better nor worse, or at any rate\nnot markedly so, than the other sittings attended by Mrs.\nBenson. Nothing of a specially intimate character was men\ntioned, and the best thing given was obtained not from the\nspirit concerned, but, so it seems, by means of a clairvoyant\nimpression received by Nelly from Mrs. Benson's daughter.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson'* Trance. 143\nApart from this particular instance, throughout the sitting\nthere is a disorderly amalgam of communications, based at one\nmoment on information supplied from the soi-disant Archbishop,\nand at the next on telepathic or clairvoyant impressions.\nThe stance opened in this way :\nNelly :\u2014\" This was the day when time gentleman said he\nwanted to come and talk. . . . Now I've got to ask that\ngentleman to tell you things. There is an Alice the old\ngentleman is very fond of.\" [Wrong.] He wants to know if\nyou are lonely, if you are all lonely. What's that weakly\nlady with you ? She is getting stronger ; it's like nerves.\"\n[This allusion has significance, but had been made before.]\nWas General Buller when you saw him ? \" [Mrs. Benson\nknows General Sir K. Buller.]\n(Here Mrs. Benson handed a ring containing hair to the\nmedium.)\nNelly :\u2014\" Two generations\u2014two gentlemen. [Wrong.] . . .\n\" The old gentleman has met his dead brother. [The brother\nwas dead.]\n\" He had a carriage accident in a country place.\" [Wrong.]\nThen, after some other details, \" The old gentleman says he\nisn't as interested as you are. He's very happy, perfectly happy\nwithout communications, and he doesn't think you need so\nmuch of his evidence. . . .\n\" I see the old books of his in the study. No earthly use\nhaving them ; no use your keeping and worrying with them.\"\n[Mrs. Benson notes :\u2014\" Our house is full of books we have kept.\nWe scarcely know what to do with them, and yet don't like\nto part with them.\"]\nAnd so in this fashion the communications continue for some\ntime, with an occasional message from \" the old gentleman,\" but\nnowhere is any personal note struck, such as might well have\nbeen looked for under the circumstances. Then the seance\nconcludes thus :\u2014\n\" He (i.e. the Archbishop) blames me\u2014the things he wants\nto say. He says one of the boys is going to publish a new\nbook in the autumn. It will bring him more success than\nanything he has published before, but if he can't get it published\nin the autumn, he must wait till May; not winter. The old\ngentleman is very spiritual : really in a higher world than I\n\f144 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nam. Just as difficult for him to tell me as it is for me to tell\nyou. He is quite a stranger to me. What do you think he\nis a clergyman for ? He is not come of a clergyman's family.\"\nKegarded solely from the point of view of drama, the com\nmunications at this sitting constitute the flattest anticlimax.\nThe spirit who announced with so much precision and empresse-\nmcnt his intention of communicating seems to have grown\nlukewarm in the matter, and Nelly on her part appears to\nmake no special effort to carry out the intention expressed at\nthe former sitting, and to prefer picking up scraps of information\nby some other method than by holding converse with a remote\nspirit.\nSitting of June oth, 1900.\nA promise had been given by Nelly that a friend of Dr.\nvan Eeden's, who had committed suicide, should control directly\nat this sitting.\nMr. Myers and Mr. F. N. Hales were present with Dr. van\nEeden at the beginning, and when they left the room Nelly\nsaid to Dr. van Eeden :\u2014\" I want you by myself. I do not\nlike them to know all these things. ... It is not that he\n(i.e. the suicide) did not want to come himself, but the strange\ngentleman upset him.\" She then proceeded to give facts about\nthe suicide and messages from him, and in conclusion said :\u2014\" I\ndo not want to put you off, but next Thursday I promise yon\nthat he will speak. I want you all by myself.\"\nSilting of June 7th, 1900.\nI must refer the reader to Proceedings, Part XLIV., pp. 100-\n111, for the report of this sitting, as a summary could not\nfurnish an intelligible account of the dramatic play and of the\nalternations in the controls. I imagine that Dr. van Eeden's\ncharge of unconscious play-acting was based principally on what\ntook place at this sitting. The action and the utterance pro\nceeded too rapidly to allow Dr. van Eeden time to take down\na verbatim record, but, judging from the record which he was\nable to make, I cannot understand why he supposes that there\nis a tendency in Mrs. Thompson's case to exaggerate the extent\nand duration of the direct control of a communicating spirit.\nSo far as I can see, there is no attempt on the part of the Nelly\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 145\ncontrol to personate the suicide. The communications, con\nsistently with what can be observed elsewhere in Mrs.\nThompson's trance, fall under three heads : (a) impressions about\nthe spirit, the source of which is not explained ; (b) messages\npurporting to be given by the spirit to Nelly : (c) direct control\nby the spirit ; and no one who has studied the characteristic\nform of Mrs. Thompson's trance-utterances could be in doubt\nas to when one control was supposed to have ceased and when\nthe other was supposed to take up the thread.\nSitting of July \\bth, 1900.\nMr. and Mrs. Percival's first sitting. Mr. Myers recording.\nMrs. Cartwright was the only direct control, though the\nPercivals' son was, so to speak, in close touch with the control,\nand sending messages and information through her. She had\ncorrectly stated that the boy had died from measles, and that\nhe \"had spots over him like measles\"; \"his face looked\nred \" ; and added the reflection :\u2014\" He thinks it was funny\nto describe a spirit with a red blotchy face.\"\nThroughout the sitting many glimpses are afforded of what\nis supposed to be going on on the other side.\nMrs. Cartwright opened with the words :\u2014\" Mr. Piddington\nis just as dictatorial to me as I was in old days to the\nchildren \" ; which may have been intended as an explanation\nof the infrequency of her appearances at sittings where I was\nrecorder.\nA book that had belonged to W. Stainton Moses was handed\nto the medium, but nothing came of this except that the\nmedium's hand wrote \" William Stainton,\" and that subse\nquently Mrs. Cartwright said that she saw little chance of\ngetting at Moses, who was in a different part of the spiritual\nworld. She also denied all knowledge of the Imperator group.\nMr. Myers asked what had first interested Mrs. Cartwright\nin the subject of spirit communication, and she replied as\nfollows :\u2014\" I abhorred the subject of Spiritualism when on\nearth. Yet I could not help thinking about it, and I made up\nmy mind that the first thing I would do on the other side\nwas to see whether there was any truth in it, and then, if\npossible, come back and tell people it was all nonsense.\"\n\fH6 [PAKT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nMrs. Cartwright's meaning is clear enough, but her manner\nof expressing it suggests that she must have had more than\na drop of Irish blood in her veins.1\nMr. Myers then congratulated her on the improvement in\nher own control, \" which,\" he says, \" is to-day more flowing\nand natural than ever before,\" and she admits that she can\nnow control more easily.\nThen Mr. Myers asked if more than two sittings a week\nwere advisable. Mrs. Cartwright answers that she herself does\nnot think that there would be any harm in increasing the\nnumber, but she must refer the question to Edmund Gurney\nand Mr. D., \"who are giving orders now.\" (See p. 299.)\nShe goes away to consult them, and on her return breaks\ninto a conversation between Mr. Myers and the sitters, apolo\ngises for the interruption, and says :\u2014\" I can hear the confused\nmurmur of voices. I am interrupting. I have consulted Mr.\nD. He thinks that besides two sittings there might be a\ntrance each week at home, when objects brought might be\nconsidered.\"\nThen, as if her return to the atmosphere of the seance-room\nreminded her of what had been going on before she went\naway, she remarks :\u2014\" The boy (i.e. E. H. Percival) is a jolly\nlittle chap. He can't understand why he is wanted to talk\nabout himself. ' Mother and auntie,' he says, ' know much\nmore than I do about myself.' \"\nYet it is a noticeable fact\u2014an example of the undesigned\nand subtle consistency of the trance phenomena\u2014that when\nsome months later E. H. Percival controlled directly, the\nmedium exhibited symptoms corresponding to those that the\nboy himself had in his last illness ; the breathing was laboured,\ncurious noises were made in the lungs, there was constant\nrestlessness accompanied by coughing, and the control spoke of\nhis dislike of being poulticed. So long, therefore, as the boy was\nonly represented as conversing with Nelly, he cannot under\nstand why the symptoms of his last illness should be mentioned ;\n1 Of. F. U. S. Schiller's Humanitm, p. 288 :\u2014\" Even if a ghost returned\nto announce to us the complete extinction of the soul at death, we could\nnot credit so Hibernian an assertion.\" Mr. Schiller wrote, I believe, in\nignorance of Mrs. Cartwright's ' Hibernian assertion,' as did I in ignorance\nof his suppositious post-mortem Irish bull.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompsons Trance. 147\nbut as soon as he controls the medium, physical symptoms\nanalogous to those from which he suffered before death are\nnot only manifested in the medium's organism, but form the\nsubject of the trance-utterance.\nMr. Myers then asked whether she can see any spirit\nhigher than the governing group, mentioning as one of\nthat group. \" No,\" she replied, \" while I am doing this work\nI am excluded from the power of even visualising spirits\nhigher than these. Names are hard to recall in the trance.\nIf you had not said ' ' I should not have known the\nname of Nelly's ' Grey Lady.' \"\nThe \" Grey Lady \" is Nelly's name for a well-known authoress\nwho is supposed to take an active interest in the direction of\nMrs. Thompson's trance-phenomena ; she has already been re\nferred to as waiting to take Nelly \" home \" at the end of a\ntrance. (See p. 142.)\nEarlier in the sitting Mr. Myers had asked who were\ngoing to control Mrs. Thompson later on. Mrs. Cartwright\nsaid :\u2014\" X. Y. will control. She tried yesterday ; she could\nnot do it gently ; she threw the sensitive on the floor, but\ndid not hurt her. She was selected by spirits before she\ndied for this purpose ; she was prepared even in the old\ndays.\"\nI do not give the name of the spirit here mentioned by\nMrs. Cartwright, because, if this spirit did purport to control\nsome other medium than Mrs. Thompson, such a development\nwould be interesting in view of Mrs. Cartwright's assertions :\nthe more so because the lady mentioned was not the kind of\nperson likely to suggest itself to the rather conventional fancy\nof the ordinary entranced medium.\nThis is not the only occasion on which a tyro in the art\nof controlling has been said to have thrown the medium down\nas a consequence of clumsy and inexperienced exertions. Mrs.\nThompson has several times told me that when alone at home\nshe has been thrown, sometimes with considerable violence,\non to the floor. She herself and Nelly also attributed this\nto the ineffectual attempts of a certain spirit to gain control\nof the medium. On one occasion, although I did not actually\nwitness Mrs. Thompson fall to the ground, I saw her lying on\nthe floor with the leg of a chair poised on her forehead,\n\f148 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nwhere it had raised a biggish bump. I examined this bump\nvery carefully ; it was evidently freshly caused, of that there\nwas no doubt, as the lump increased in size and in redness\nafter I first examined it. Mrs. Thompson was deeply entranced,\nand though she showed signs of a good deal of physical dis\ncomfort, she did not appear to be aware of the bruise on her\nforehead. Nearly an hour passed before I parted from her,\nby which time the bruise had almost disappeared. Not even\nwhen she awoke from the trance did she seem to suffer\npain from it, but rather from a general sense of malaise.\nWhen she awoke from the trance after the fall I was anxious\nto prevent her from going into trance again, but she seemed\ncompelled to relapse, and quite contrary to her usual custom,\nwhich is to sit perfectly quietly in any sort of chair, she\nsank on to the floor, and for some time seemed as if\nabout to be possessed by the same maladroit spirit as before ;\nbut gradually the agitated movements subsided and gave way\nto the placid control of Nelly. The odd part about it was that\nNelly seemed in doubt as to who it was that had made the\nineffectual attempt to control and caused the rather distressing\nsymptoms. She was at first inclined to lay the blame on\nthe spirit who had been supposed to have thrown Mrs. Thomp\nson to the ground when she was alone at home ; but afterwards\nshe was inclined to withdraw this statement and to substitute\nthe name of another spirit, who has occasionally controlled,\nthough, as far as I am aware, without causing any bodily\ndiscomfort to the medium.\nSitliny of January 3rd, 1901.\nE. H. Percival had been speaking directly, and at intervals\nNelly was telling facts about him. At the first sitting which\nMr. and Mrs. Percival had attended a plain red cap had\nbeen given to the medium that had been E. H. Percival's\nschool cap ; but it was not presented at this sitting. Nelly\nsaid :\u2014\" He was very fond of cricketing, and he wore a red\nand black striped jacket ; striped blazer. He says it was a\nblazer, not a jacket. (Then in a tone of mixed indignation\nand contempt) ' Jacket,' he says ; ' It was a blazer.' \" [Correct.]\nIt would be difficult to portray with a happier or a lighter\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 149\ntouch the importance which the schoolboy attaches to the use\nof recognised terms, especially in matters of clothing, and his\nbristling up when a mere girl misnames an object which has\nonly one possible designation for him.\nSitting of April l$th, 1900.\nThis sitting supplies another instance of the parenthetical\nway in which Nelly intimates the modus operandi of the\ntrance. Referring to a lady whom she connects with Dr.\nMax Dessoir, she says :\u2014\" Dead lady. I can see her. I don't\nknow what's the matter with her. ... It almost makes\nmy heart stop. (Here the medium puts her hand over the\nheart as if in pain.) She is like here quite distinctly. She\ndoesn't believe I am really talking to you. She very much\nobjects to one talking to her.\"\nBesides illustrating Nelly's method of acquiring information,\nthis passage also contains two interesting points.\n(1) Although the spirit is clearly represented as not at close\nrange, the medium displays symptoms of experiencing a sympa\nthetic physical pain akin to what the spirit herself is supposed\no have suffered.\nIf such sensitiveness is exhibited when there is no pretence\nof direct obsession, it can hardly be surprising to find symptoms\nof bodily disease far more strongly reproduced when a spirit\nis supposed to be in actual possession of a medium's organism.\n(2) Here as elsewhere (cf. pp. 137, 138, 139, 146), Nelly\nintimates that scepticism is not confined to this side of the\nveil, and that in her efforts to forward the cause of psychical\nresearch she has to incur the invidious charge of being a\nPaul Pry. If my memory serves me well, Phinuit likewise\nhas complained of the odium into which his inquisitiveness\ninto the affairs of strangers has brought him.\nI did not have any regular sittings with Mrs. Thompson\nfor the purpose of getting communications on my own account ;\nbut in the course of three sittings I handed to the medium\nobjects which had belonged to my mother. Until Nelly had\ndiscovered the identity of the owner of these objects, I most\ncarefully refrained, at least consciously, from giving any hint\nthat I was any more interested in these objects than in others\n\f15(1 [PAKT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nbelonging to other people which I was handing to the medium\nat the same sittings. The most noticeable point about the\nthings, which were given in connection with my mother, was\nthat the best things were given just at the moments when\nmy mother was represented as being within very near range\nof Nelly.\nOn the first of the three occasions, my mother was not\nmentioned at all ; only my father, of whom a slight, though,\nas far as it went, correct personal description was given, and\nsome other details (see pp. 118, 152-3).\nOn the second occasion, it was not suggested that my\nmother was within speaking range of Nelly, and apparently\nsuch facts as were given were obtained by means of clair\nvoyant pictures. Still the most striking passage occurred\nimmediately before Nelly attributed a statement to an un\nspecified \" some one,\" whose words she heard and repeated.\nOn the analogy of what took place on the two subsequent\noccasions, it would not be inconsistent to regard this \" some\none \" as my mother. The passage ran as follows :\u2014\n\" A Mary belonging to this lady. Mary or Marian\u2014a\ndaughter. And an Uncle John, who everybody has got.\nDon't lose Margaret's hair. I heard some one say : ' Move\nthe hair belonging to Margaret.' \"\nThe overheard sentence indirectly conveys a correct state\nment of fact, and conveys it in a way which can, I think,\nwithout a strain be regarded as Nelly's rendering of a\nsentence which might very naturally have been spoken by my\nmother under the circumstances.\nI had handed to the medium a lock of my mother's hair,\nwhich was part of a larger quantity which had been in the\npossession and keeping of my mother's daughter and my\nsister Margaret for many years. My sister had given me a\nportion of the hair some year or two before this. Nowhere\nis it suggested or stated that the dead lady's name was Mar\ngaret, and though Nelly did not seem to understand what\nwas meant by the words, \" Move the hair belonging to\nMargaret,\" it is noticeable that Nelly did not, as might have\nbeen expected, draw the inference from these words that\nMargaret was the name of the dead lady.\nThe advice to remove or not to lose the hair was\n\fXLvII.] Pfienomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 151\nquite appropriate, for the trance was coming to an end,\nand I was collecting the various objects and odds and ends\nthat I had brought to the sitting, and the tiny lock of hair\nmight very easily have been overlooked. I quoted the mention\nof the two names given in connection with my mother imme\ndiately before the reference to the hair, because they are both\nright, and, with the name Margaret, make three, albeit common,\nnames given close together, which, on the supposition that my\nmother was really communicating, I should have expected to\nhave heard mentioned. Marian (not Mary) was a step-daughter,\nalways, however, spoken off as a daughter ; and the Uncle John,\n\" who,\" as Nelly, with the instinct of the psychical researcher,\nremarked, \" everybody has got,\" is my mother's only brother\nand my only uncle, that is, my only uncle except for two\nuncles by marriage, of whom I have hardly seen anything\nat all.\nAt the next sitting at which mention was made of my\nmother, only twice do the words used by Nelly suggest that\nmy mother was in direct converse with her ; and on each occa\nsion the facts given were good.\n\" There was an Annie and a John belonging to her, not\nJack. She seemed to be deliberate over it, as if it were John.\"\nAt first sight it would seem as if this repetition of a John\nin connection with the same person was inept and meaning\nless. As a matter of fact, it is not so at all. Four members\nof my mother's immediate family bore the name of John ; her\nfather, husband, brother, and son. She would naturally neither\nspeak nor think of her father by his Christian name. Her\nhusband was never called by his first name, John, but by his\nsecond Christian name ; her brother, the \" Uncle John \" men\ntioned above, was and is always called John, and never Jack ;\nI, her son, am and always have been called Jack, and never\nJohn. Although therefore Nelly does not seem to understand\nwhy any care should be taken to distinguish carefully between\nJohn and Jack, there was, as a matter of fact, need for\ncareful discrimination.\nAfter the words : \" She seemed to be deliberate over it, as\nif it were John,\" Nelly continued without a break : \" The\nAnnie was not like a daughter. She seems to be one that\nshe used to help. She made her a shawl once. Not help in\nL\n\f152 [PART\nJ. 6. Piddington.\nmonetary ways, but she helped her and knitted for her, and\nshe bought Annie an old-fashioned pedestal work-table.\"\nThis statement, made in February, 1900, I was not able\nto verify until the end of September, 1903. I could not re\nmember any friend of my mother's whose Christian name was\nAnnie, and enquiries among my relations did not help to throw\nany light on the matter. In the summer of 1903 I received\na letter from an old friend of my mother's, from whom I do\nnot remember having received a letter before ; though she may\nperhaps have written me a letter of congratulation in 1894 ; but\nin any case I had seen her only two or three times since my\nearly childhood, and her existence was so little in my con\nscious thoughts that though at some time or other I must have\nlearnt that her name was Annie, the mention of the name\nby Nelly never suggested this lady to my mind. When, how\never, I noticed the signature of the letter, I recalled the\nreference by Nelly to an Annie connected with my mother,\nand so I went to see this old friend of my mother's. She\ntold me that my mother had \" been exceedingly good and\nkind \" to her, and helped her in many ways. She had once,\nand once only, knitted a shawl for her. She used to help her\nwith making clothes for her little children; and especially in\n\u25a0devising and cutting out patterns for their dresses. She never\ngave or bought her an old-fashioned pedestal work-table ; but\nhaving come into possession of some furniture (whether by\npurchase or inheritance, I cannot say) on the death of a\nrelation of my father's, and not needing it all herself, she\ngave Annie some of it. This furniture was probably very old-\nfashioned even then.\nThe correspondence is close, and interesting because, though\nout of my subconscious memory might have been got the name\n\" Annie \" as that of the friend of my mother, I think it very\nunlikely that at any time in my existence had I heard of the\ngift of a shawl, or of the help that my mother gave to\n\" Annie.\"\nI think that such coincidence as there is between Nelly's\nstatements about this Annie and the real facts is the more\nstriking because there were two Annies mentioned by Nelly\nin my sittings, one said to be connected with my father, and\nthe other with my mother. Not only at the time of the\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance.\nsitting was I, but for more than three years and a half after\nit I remained under the impression that the name was without\nsigni6cance in either connection. The day after I discovered\nabout my mother's friend Annie, from an entirely different\nsource, 1 learnt that my father had had a sister named Annie,\nwho died more than fifty years ago.\nI had never, to the best of my knowledge, heard her men\ntioned, nor did I know of her existence. My ignorance on\nthis point may seem curious, but my father outlived all the\nimmediate relations of his own generation by some twenty\nyears, and but rarely referred to them. He had, for instance,\nan only brother, to whom he was deeply attached ; yet I never\nheard him mention him, or even refer to his existence.\nNelly continues to give facts about my mother, but she\ndoes not purport to recite her actual words except once, and\nthen, as I have already described, with telling effect. She is\nspeaking about a living relation of my mother's when she\nexclaims :\u2014\" Oh ! dear, the lady says ' he was an unorthodox\nperson.' \"\nThere is a note of amused despair at the unconventionality\nof the relation's character which strikes me as most lifelike.\nNelly scored a double success, first in hitting off so neatly a\nprominent characteristic of the individual in question, and then\nin putting the phrase into the mouth of my mother. I am\nwell aware not only how difficult it is to convey to strangers\nthe force of little intimate touches of this kind, but also how\neasily one may be led into reading into turns of phrase a special\nappropriateness when really they are commonplace enough ;\nyet neither of these considerations ought to deter me from\nadmitting with frankness when some small personal point has\nproduced on me a strong impression.\nThis sentence alone seems to have been directly inspired\nby my mother, for when a little later on Nelly, making the\ndiscovery that the lady about whom she had been speaking\nwas my mother, I asked :\u2014\" Where is she ? \" I got the reply :\n\u2014\" She doesn't seem to be in England.\" \" No,\" I said, \" I\nmean in what sphere ? \" \" It's no good me pretending I know.\nI can't see her ; I only see pictures.\"\nAt only one other sitting were communications supposed to\ncome from or about my mother. Though she was said to be\n\f154 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nassisting Nelly in discovering facts about the sitter, twice only\nis the impression conveyed that she is conversing directly with\nher, and then only once were the messages of an evidential\ncharacter. They were not so striking, or rather they did not\nstrike me so much, as the others which I have just cited ; yet\nthey were the best things said in the sitting. I will not, how\never, quote them, because they would need a good deal of\nexplanation, and the point which I wish to make is that the com\nmunications which either purported, or which were so worded\nas to lead me to infer that they purported, to come directly\nfrom the communicating spirit, were more evidential and im\npressed me as more authentic than those which were merely\nthe outcome of Nelly's own researches.\nSitting of December 20th, 1900.\nThis was the first of the screen sittings (see p. 163) at\nwhich I was present, and the second that had been tried. The\nstrange conditions not only annoyed Nelly, but also affected\nher powers adversely. Whether the medium would have gradu\nally accustomed herself to them, or whether they would have\npermanently hampered the full exercise of her abnormal\nperceptive faculties, must remain an open question. I was told\nby various critics that in thus rendering the conditions more\nsevere I was putting an undue strain on Mrs. Thompson's\nmediumship, which, remarkable as it might be, would by reason\nof the slightness of her trance prove unequal to the new test.\nHad a prolonged enquiry shown a lower percentage of success\nin screen sittings as compared with others where the sitters\nwere not hidden from the medium's view, and if similar experi\nments with other mediums produced similarly inferior results,\nat any rate we should learn something about the conditions\nwhich influence the exercise of trance-mediumship, instead of as\nat present remaining without one glimmer of light to guide us\nin such investigations. And I take it that while we do not at\npresent possess a sufficient mass of evidence to place beyond\ndoubt the fact of exercise of supernormal faculty, yet there is\nenough presumptive evidence to justify us in varying the con\nditions (even though by doing so we diminish the stream of\npurely \" evidential \" facts) in the hope of lighting upon some\nlaw of the phenomena.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Tlumtpson's Trance. 155\nAfter the experience gained at the half-dozen screen sittings\nI am by no means sure that the concealment of the sitter\nwould have necessarily resulted in the eclipse or partial eclipse\nof Mrs. Thompson's powers. None of these sittings, it is true,\ncould be accounted successful, but they were not entire failures,\nand such falling off as there was from the general standard\nought not probably to be attributed wholly to the new conditions\nbut in part to other disturbing influences. And even where\nthe deterioration was plainly due to the concealment of the\nsitter, I am disposed to think that the reason must be looked\nfor more in the subjective effect produced on the medium\nthan in the objective separation of the sitter from the medium.\nIn spite, however, and perhaps in consequence of the com\nparative non-success of this sitting, it furnishes several hints of\nthe various modes of communication resorted to by Nelly,\ngiven as usual in asides :\u2014\n\"All these are pictures only; not from the lady herself.\" . . .\n\"Some knitted bedroom slippers. There's such a lot of\npictures of things.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Can't you get at the people themselves ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" Not yet ; they can't understand how to get at\nthings.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Are they trying now ? \"\nNelly.\u2014\"Yes, for they've tried before this time.\"\n...\" Do you think Mrs. Benson writes poetry ? [ can\nonly see that old gentleman. Why did you (i.e. J. G. P,)\ntalk about Mrs. Benson ? \"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"I didn't.\"\nNelly :\u2014\" Well, I can hear somebody talking about Mrs.\nBenson.\"\n(Mrs. Benson was as a matter of fact the sitter, though she\nhad up to this point been hidden from the medium, but as\nshe had inadvertently whispered a few words to me, and since,\nas a former sitter, she might have been recognised by her\nwalk, or breathing, or by some other such clue, one is not\nbound to conclude that there was anything supernormal in\nNelly's allusion.)\n\"... I wish you'd tell Mrs. Benson to come and see me.\"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"Why?\"\nNelly :\u2014\" I only want to tell her that something made them\n\f156 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nvery thirsty when coming in the train from Ober-Amergau.\nSomebody belonging to Mrs. Benson, who took care of them\nwhen they went there, told me that.\" ...\" I can only see\nMrs. Benson now. To begin with the beginning. First comes\nthe old lady belonging\u2014You do mix it up, you know.\" (This\nremark was not apparently addressed to me, but sotto voce to\nspirits.) . . .\n(On the removal of the screen.) \" You can use the screen\nuntil I've found out six more people. You see, I scored off\nyou. It's more harder work. I can never find spirits when\nI've got anything earthly to find. I can only see pictures.\nI don't mean that you are earthly, darling Mrs. Benson ; but\nyou understand.\" . . .\n\" I didn't find anything or anybody. I shall only talk\nnonsense if I go on.\"\nThis distinction between seeing pictures and direct converse\nwith a spirit is again brought out in the sitting of January 3rd,\n1901. Nelly, referring to the Percival control, says:\u2014\"He's\ngone away, and there's a picture only.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Won't he come back ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" He'll come back soon. He's talking so much to Mr.\nMoses. He's a kind of little Moses\u2014a disciple of Moses.\"\nFrom the record of the sitting of January 8th, 1901, I take\nthe following illustrations of the trance-mechanism :\u2014\n\" I can see King's Cross written up in front of my eyes ; not\nmy mother's eyes. You see the difference ? \"\n(Referring to the Geoffrey Scott control) \" He's trying to find\nout [certain information]. My mother's very disagreeable. I'm\nonly looking after her while Geoffrey's gone away. ... He\ncan't remember what he said he'd write last night ; but he can't\nremember it now. He has got to impress it on Mother's brain,\nand Tm using half Mother's brain.\"\nThe locus classicvs on the fitful variations in the continuity of\nthe trance and normal consciousness is to be found in the sitting\nof January 29th, 1901. It is worth quoting in full, because it\nshows that Nelly recognises and admits not only various sources\nof information, but also variation in the authenticity of her own\nutterances.\n\" Sometimes I can really be my mother. Sometimes I can\nreally think with my mother's thoughts into other people's\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 157\nhearts, and sometimes I am really myself, not a bit my mother, a\nspirit talking to spirits. When I'm really a spirit talking, every\nthing in mother is quiet, like an empty house. When I'm a bit\nof my mother, it's like as if I was in an inhabited house, though\nI can't see the inhabitant. When I'm inside mother and she's\nnot right away I seem to hear things said and thought, and\ndon't know whether it's my mother or something else. ' I\nhaven't the power to discriminate,' Mr. Sidgwick says that of\nit. He can hear me quite well now.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Ask him about ' Trevelyan's transferred.' \"\nNelly :\u2014\" No, I can't make him understand. I should only\nguess.\"\nThis avowal was unprovoked by any enquiry on my part, and\nits frankness may be compared with other instances where Nelly\nhas been at some pains to prevent equal confidence being placed\nin all her statements indiscriminately.\n(4) The Kelations between Mrs. Thompson's Normal\nConsciousness and the Trance-Consciousness.\nThe most marked difference between Mrs. Thompson awake\nand Mrs. Thompson entranced lies perhaps in the modification\nof the speech. There is an alteration in the manner and also\nin the facial play, but both are less clearly defined, and liable to\nconsiderable variation, so much so that at times it would be very\nhard, if not impossible, to say whether the Nelly manner and\nexpression of face or Mrs. Thompson's ordinary manner and\nexpression preponderated. But between the diction of Mrs.\nThompson and the diction of Nelly there is so great a\ndivergence that it cannot ever be open to doubt as to which\nof the two is supposed to be speaking. Mrs. Cartwright quite\nrightly described Nelly as illiterate, and Nelly recognises and\nregrets her inability to express herself better : \" I wish I could\nspeak more learned like,\" she once said. Mrs. Thompson, on the\nother hand, is, I need hardly say, nothing of the kind. She\nexpresses herself both in speech and writing, particularly in the\nlatter, with intelligence and with rather more than ordinary\n\f158 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nprecision, and, if not with the grammatical accuracy of a purist,\nat least with no more frequent violations of the King's English\nthan we may any of us be guilty of from time to time. Nelly's\nblunders are, on the contrary, committed wholesale, and they are\nnot merely the careless slips of a person who knows better, but\nthorough-going downright barbarisms\u2014the barbarisms of the\nnursery, not of the street, however. This feature of the Nelly\npersonality seems to me equally puzzling on any hypothesis.\nAt the same time it would be unprofitable to discuss all the\nextremely hypothetical points involved, and I content myself\nwith directing attention to the existence of a problem.\nInstead of reproducing in my notes Nelly's mispronunciations\nand other grammatical eccentricities, I as often as not sub\nstituted for them the proper form of spelling or construction,\nexcept where it seemed possible that some importance might\nattach to the misuse of a word or phrase. It will be under\nstood that when a recorder has all his work cut out to keep\npace with the trance-utterances, he does not wish to add to\nthe difficulty of his task by having to represent peculiarities of\nspeech by means of phonetic spelling. The written records\ngive, therefore, a rather too favourable idea of the correctness\nof Nelly's speech. Still, I very often did have time to report\nNelly not only textually, but phonetically too. I quote some\nof the worst specimens of her phraseology in order to make\nclear how the illiterate Nelly differs from the educated Mrs.\nThompson.\n\" That makes like Madeira work.\"\n\" I telled you that before.\" (Yet the same afternoon the\ncorrect form, \" I told you,\" had been used\u2014that is, supposing\nthat the recorder, Mrs. Verrall, who, however, usually noted\nNelly's ' baby-language,' had not amended Nelly's grammar.)\n\" He writed with you about mesmerism.\"\n\" Cappychising \" for \" catechising,\" \" muggling \" for \" mud\ndling,\" and such like childish coinages are frequent.\n\" It's more harder work.\"\n\" Somebody in Mrs. Piper's house they said.\"\n'' She has got a very ill mother.\"\n\" X. writed it.\"\n\"Ask this lady what she writed in the train with this\npencil.\"\n\fxlvil] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 159\n\"He said he writed it, and told the lady about it.\" (\"Writed\"\nbut \"told,\" not \"telled.\" Yet the correct form \"wrote\" is also\nused by Nelly, and always by the Percival control.)\n\"She only thinked it.\"\n\" Tell Margaret to write to Mr. Myers and cheer him up like,\ncheer him up.\"\n\"She wasn't a sort of consumptive die; much quicker.\"\n\" I went, but it was a ' muggled went.' \"\nThese last two instances ought not perhaps to be regarded as\ngrammatical errors, but rather as a characteristic mode of speech,\nand one not altogether foreign to Mrs. Thompson herself. Such\nan expression, too, as the one quoted above : \" Somebody in Mrs.\nPiper's house they said\": is due probably to the broken style\nof utterance, and were one dealing with Thucydides instead of\nNelly the halting construction would be dignified or white\nwashed with the name of anacoluthon. Yet many and less\nglaring errors in Nelly's speech cannot be got round in this\nway, and it is quite certain not only that it would be impos\nsible for the normal Mrs. Thompson to use such forms as \" more\nharder,\" \" writed it,\" and so on, but that generally Nelly's speech\nfalls very far below the level of Mrs. Thompson's. Mrs. Cart-\nwright's speech neither falls below nor rises above the level of\nMrs. Thompson's. Her parlance is sui generis, and cannot fortu\nnately be compared with Mrs. Thompson's. It might be termed\npedantic were it not that pedantry usually connotes an ostenta\ntious display of accurate knowledge ; the ostentation is there, but\nthe accuracy is not, as I have elsewhere shown (see pp. 132-3),\nunless, indeed, Mrs. Cartwright's English, pure and undefiled at\nits source, has been contaminated in the process of passing\nthrough the speech centres of the less scholarly medium.\nI once had a conversation of some twenty minutes' or half-\nhour's duration with the \" Mr. D.\" control, and though I\npurposely recorded only a fragment of what was said on this\noccasion, I was much struck with the accuracy and refinement\nof the speech, and nothing said by this control on other occa\nsions in my hearing has contradicted or diminished the impression\nwhich I then received.\nThere was not enough direct speech uttered by the Percival\ncontrol to justify any detailed comparison being drawn between\nit and the speech of the other controls or that of the medium ;\n\f160 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nbut so far as it went, it struck me as being quite in keeping\nwith the character of the personality which this control was\nsupposed to represent. My contemporaneous note made on its\nfirst manifestation ran thus :\u2014\" The part from ' Oh ! I can't\nbreath,' to ' my Oxford box ' [i.e. the utterances of the Percival\ncontrol] was not spoken in Nelly's voice, nor with her manner.\nThe speech was much slower and more refined.\"\nI refer elsewhere to the character of the Sidgwick control\n(see pp. 236-7), which was remarkably life-like. The direct\nutterance, however, contained one ungrammatical phrase which\nit would appear necessary to assign to the medium's own habits\nof speech : \" Alice will know that it's me that's written it.\"\nGenerally, though not perhaps invariably, Nelly must be\ncredited with knowing anything that is known to Mrs. Thomp\nson ; and the range of common knowledge includes not only\ndomestic matters or matters in which Mrs. Thompson takes a\nspecial interest, but all such general knowledge as may reason\nably be supposed to be part of the intellectual outfit of a\nperson of average education.\nNelly refers to mundane affairs, past and present, with easy\nassurance, and has only once (see pp. 117-8) within my ex\nperience thought herself called upon to explain how a spirit who,\none must not say, left this earth, but, one may say, who died at\nthe age of a few months is as glibly au courant of the affairs of\nthis mortal life as if she read her daily newspaper. She nick\nnames (behind his back) Dr. van Eeden \" Brother Boer \": Dr.\nvan Eeden's father-in-law is described as having worn \"a hat like\nTennyson,\" and knowledge of recent Dutch history is shown.\nMy mother is said to have \" had a lot of people belonging\nto her when alive who did a lot of talking, like Parliamentary ;\nonly they didn't act much ; they helped to make the laws,\nbut were not officials like Chamberlain, but like John Jones,\nM.P., only not Cabinet Ministers.\" A congress was said to\nhave been attended by Dr. van Eeden, and the place where it\nwas held is thus particularised :\u2014\" You know the ' North Pole,'\nP6le du Nord, where people sing and dance. Turning out\nof the street in which was the ' North Pole ' was the big hall\nwhere the Congress was held.\" She repeats scraps of Mr.\nThompson's conversation, and also of that of Mrs. Thompson. In\nconnection with an object handed to the medium she says :\u2014\" I\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 161\nseem to have a feeling of Bruges\u2014where the lace is\u2014where\nOstend is.\" \"How do you know it's Ostend?\" I ask. \"Oh!\"\nreplies Nelly, \" I see little wooden houses.\"\nIn one instance Nelly's memory fails where probably Mrs.\nThompson's would not have. She is trying to get hold of the\nname \" Guernsey,\" and defines it in this roundabout manner.\n\" It's very near, near England. Where does Mr. Marsden\n[assumed name] live when not at Cheltenham ? Marsden Park?\nI can't remember the name of the place ; only the hotel\nwhere they all stayed,\" and then gives the name of the hotel\ncorrectly. Mrs. Thompson had some time before this stayed\nat the hotel named, and visited, with Mr. Marsden, Marsden\nPark ; but though Nelly cannot recall the name of Mr. Mars-\nden's place for the moment, it is clear that she implies that\nshe once had known it. The reference to Guernsey occurred\nin connection with an incident which exemplifies another aspect\nof the relations hetween the waking and the trance con\nsciousness.\nAt the sitting held on the afternoon of January 5th, 1900,\nNelly remarked :\u2014\" Have you seen a shipwreck ? Because I\ncan see it. It is mixed up with Mr. Marsden. He is not in\nit, but he has something to do with it. Mr. Marsden is very\nill with bronchitis : that's why he hasn't written to you [i.e.\nJ. G. P.]. It had got letters on the shipwreck. It's very near,\"\netc., and the passage ends as already quoted.\nThe early editions of the evening newspapers of January\n5th, 1900, contained accounts of the shipwreck of the G.W.R.\nS.S. Ibex off the coast of Guernsey, and I myself had already\nseen the announcements on the posters. I do not remember\nif the steamer's name was given ; if not it would account for\nNelly confining herself to saying that \" it had got letters on\nthe shipwreck.\"\nI, however, made no remark to Mrs. Thompson when the\ntrance was over, and awaited developments. Our next meeting\nwas on January 10th, and at the conclusion of the sitting held\non that day Mrs. Thompson spontaneously told me that she had\nlearnt from Nelly that she (Nelly) had spoken about the ship\nwreck, and she expressed her annoyance at Nelly's stupidity,\nbecause she had read the news of the shipwreck on the news\npaper posters on her way to my house on January 5th. It\n\f162 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nwould, in my view, be absurd to charge Mrs. Thompson with\nhaving knowingly introduced into the trance-utterances this\nreference to the Guernsey shipwreck ; I entertain too high an\nopinion of her intelligence to be able to suppose that she, who\nhas every reason to be well acquainted with the methods of\nour Society, entertains so low an opinion of our intelligence as\nto imagine that she could pass off as supernormally acquired this\nitem of news which the very simplest enquiry would have shown\nto have been within the range of her normal consciousness. A\nnearly parallel case is cited below (see pp. 179-180), a case\nwhich I equally and for the same reasons find it impossible\nto regard as suspicious. The interest of these two cases lies\nrather in the fact that they suggest that Nelly is not always\naware of the real source of her information, or as Nelly herself\ndefines the position, \" When I'm inside Mother and she's not\nright away I seem to hear things said and thought and don't\nknow whether it's my mother or something else.\" Now it is\nnoticeable that these two instances of the reproduction in trance\nof specific pieces of information possessed by the medium in\nher normal state both occurred at sittings which were very\npoor in results, and at which Mrs. Thompson was in a state\nof continual restlessness and was obviously ill at ease ; a con\ndition which appears to answer to what Nelly terms, \" When\nI'm inside Mother and she's not right away.\"\nAt this same sitting on January 5th, 1900, the following\nincident happened :\u2014There had been an interval of about 1 0\nminutes during which I had gone into the next room. Soon\nafter I came back into the seance-room Mrs. Thompson relapsed\ninto trance, and I then found that I had mislaid my pencil.\nI exclaimed, \" Where did I put my pencil ? \" to be met with\nNelly's instant and correct rejoinder : \" In the next room.\" I\nhad mislaid the pencil in the interval between the trances,\nand not during the time that Nelly was controlling. Her\nanswer may of course have been based upon a mere conjecture,\nor she may have derived her information telepathically from\na part of my consciousness which may have remembered what\nI had done with the pencil : an explanation not quite so\ngratuitous as it may seem, for I have on several occasions\nbeen convinced that Nelly has during the course of a sitting\nread my unspoken thoughts, not obvious thoughts which might\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 163\nhave been easily conjectured by any one present who was\nfollowing the proceedings, but thoughts not suggested by what\nwas being said or done at the time. Or, again, Nelly may\nhave drawn on Mrs. Thompson's conscious or subconscious\nknowledge of the whereabouts of my pencil, or Mrs. Thompson\nmay not have been in trance at all and made a silly slip.\nThe last explanation is the only one that does not recommend\nitself to me.\nThough this last episode would lead one to assume that\nNelly keeps an eye on what is going on just before and after\ntrance, an incident that occurred at the sitting on January\n18th, 1900, shows that she is sometimes unobservant of matters\nwhich one might have supposed could not have escaped her.\nMr. \" Wilson \" and I had left the seance-room together\nduring an interval in the trance in order to talk over what\nhad been said. On our return we found the medium re-\nentranced and Nelly talking gaily and volubly to nobody. I\nclass this incident under the relations of the trance and normal\nconsciousnesses because it is evident that, up to the moment of\npassing into trance, Mrs. Thompson must have been aware\nof our absence from the room and of the consequent inutility\nof the trance-utterance beginning before our return.\nAt a few sittings the sitter did not enter the stance-room until\ntrance had begun, and was both on and after entering hidden from\nthe medium by means of a screen, and enjoined to keep strict\nsilence. At one of this series a lady whom I will call Mrs.\nScott was to be the sitter; and I had previously arranged\nwith her, for reasons to be explained presently, that when she\ncame to the S.P.B. Rooms at 19 Buckingham Street, where\nthe sitting was to be held, she should walk into the Library\nwith a heavy tread and slam the door after her, so that Mrs.\nThompson, who would be in the next room, might hear her\nmovements. Mrs. Scott carried out these suggestions, and also\nwhen she came into the stance-room after trance had begun\nshe pursued the same tactics. The Library, it should be under\nstood, was separated from the stance-room by a short passage\nor lobby. Mrs. Scott had had several sittings with Mrs.\nThompson before this, as had also another lady, whom for\nthe purposes of narrating this incident I will call Mrs. Taylor.\nI had noticed that Mrs. Scott was unusually tranquil and\n\f164 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nnoiseless in all her movements ; whereas Mrs. Taylor's move\nments were marked by a certain energy and impetuousness.\nAccordingly it occurred to me to try an experiment by way\nof testing how far indications afforded to the waking Mrs.\nThompson would be utilised by the entranced Mrs. Thompson.\nThe object then of Airs. Scott's assumed gait was to copy that of\nMrs. Taylor. The result of these insidious manoeuvres was\ninteresting.\nAfter Mrs. Scott had made her noisy entry into the Library,\nand before she entered the seance-room, Nelly said :\u2014\n\" I want to write to Mrs. Taylor. I want to tell her lots\n\u2022of secrets.\" But no sooner were these words out of Nelly's\nmouth than another control began to speak, whom I at once\nrecognised as the control who purports to be the son of Mrs.\nScott. Mrs. Scott then entered the s&nce-room. The Scott\ncontrol had ceased speaking before she entered, and Nelly,\nafter what may have been a passing allusion to a relation of\nMrs. Benson's, returned to the subject of Mrs. Taylor's affairs,\nthough without actually stating, and perhaps without even\nwishing to imply, that Mrs. Taylor herself was present. Mean\nwhile in the intervals of Nelly's silence the Scott control\nkept intervening, and Nelly gave messages about or for both\nMrs. Taylor and Mrs. Scott more or less alternatively. Mrs.\nThompson then half awoke, and Mrs. Scott and I retired\ninto the next room. When I returned, alone, to the seance-\nroom I found the medium in the middle of writing the\nfollowing sentence :\u2014\" I am my mother's boy. I am Geoffrey\nHamilton [Christian names, as surname, fictitious] Scott. She\n.has gone. I know my . . .\"\nWhen the Geoffrey Scott control had plainly shown that\nthe identity of the sitter was discovered, the screen was re\nmoved, and consequently Mrs. Scott exposed to the medium's\nview. Thereupon the following occurred :\u2014\nNelly :\u2014\" If Mrs. Scott were to come and talk to me\nproperly.\"\n(Mrs. Scott then spoke to Nelly.)\n\" You were really there all the time ? What was it made\nme know it was Mrs. Scott ? Geoffrey's locket told me. It's\n\u2022in a box, with the glass broken.\"\nNelly claimed to havfe known that Mrs. Scott was behind\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 165\nthe screen ; but though I think she was gradually feeling her\nway towards this discovery, she did not definitely announce it.\nShe does not, it is true, actually assert that she had stated\nwho the sitter was ; only that she knew that it was Mrs.\nScott, which might be taken to mean that she had had an\nunderlying suspicion that Mrs. Scott was present, and this I\nthink there is some evidence to show that she did have, or\nperhaps I ought rather to say that she was hesitating between\nMrs. Scott and Mrs. Taylor, inclining, though, if anything, more\nto the latter than the former. But, however this may be, it is\nrather strange that she should attribute her alleged knowledge\nto a locket that had been handed to the medium early in the\nsitting rather than to what one would have fancied would have\nbeen the more obvious source, namely, the appearance of the\nScott control, and this control's written and verbal statements.\nYet here again there is another puzzling point, for, although the\nScott control had manifested on several previous occasions, at\nthis sitting Nelly did not recognise who the control was\nuntil the full name was written just after the break in the\ntrance. This control was muttering rather inaudibly, and it did\nnot at first give its name.\nNelly repeated one of the indistinct and incomplete sentences\nspoken by the soi-disant Geoffrey Scott with the preface,\n\" Somebody says.\" Then later, although I knew who the con\ntrol was supposed to represent, as I wanted the name to be\ngiven, I asked who the control was. Nelly said : \" I shall go\nand find out.\" It was at this point that there was a break\nin the trance, and immediately after its resumption the Scott\ncontrol gave its name in full, and Nelly showed that she had\nfound out who it was.\nAfter this was written Nelly began to grizzle, and said\ntearfully :\u2014\n\"You've begun to cheat me again. I want Mrs. Scott.\nGeoffrey wants his mother.\"\nWhen Mrs. Thompson woke from the trance I asked her who\nshe thought was going to be the sitter. She replied :\u2014\" I\nthought it was Mrs. Taylor, because the door banged, and also\nbefore I came I thought it was going to be Mrs. Taylor.\" Then,\nturning to the sitter, she added :\u2014\" Banging the door was not a\nbit like you, Mrs. Scott.\"\n\f16(5 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nThis unfair experiment, all the more unfair when the con\nditions had already been rendered sufficiently trying by interpos\ning a screen, was, however, justified by its results, for it goes to\nsupport the view that the different controls are not merely so\nmany different dramatisations introduced like the puppets of a\nventriloquist's show merely to vary what might otherwise degene\nrate into a monotonous show, but that in some sense they are\nseparate entities, whether creatures of the medium's brain or\nexternal intelligences, possessed of different memories and em\nploying also, perhaps, different methods of communication and of\nacquiring knowledge. And it also furnished an example of Mrs.\nThompson's ingenuousness, in so much as she did not attempt to\nconceal the deductions that she had drawn from the sitter's\nmanner of entering the room.\nIt seems clear that in the case under discussion the Nelly\ncontrol was misled either by Mrs. Thompson's incorrect anticipa\ntions as to who the sitter would be, or by Mrs. Scott's imitation\nof Mrs. Taylor's way of walking, or perhaps by both. But the\nScott control, which it must be remembered manifested before\nthe entrance of Mrs. Scott, was not misled. One stratum of the\nmedium's consciousness, or one spirit, made a mistake because it\ndepended for its information on the normal consciousness of the\nmedium ; another stratum, or another spirit, not depending on\nany such source and acquiring information in some more authen\ntic manner, and uninfluenced by the error of its fellow-stratum or\nfellow-spirit, rightly foresaw the identity of the coming sitter;\nand the trance-personality or the spirit who guessed or knew the\ntruth was, of the two concerned, the one who the more appro\npriately should have done so. On the spiritistic theory it is\nsimple enough to explain why one spirit should be unaware of\nthe presence of an individual bound to it by no emotional tie,\nand why the spirit of a dead son should more readily detect his\nmother's presence or proximity.\nI believe that Nelly has sometimes spoken of things which the\nnormal Mrs. Thompson would not have mentioned to me. It is,\nof course, difficult to say what a person will or will not be\nreticent about, but some of the more marked instances of Nelly's\nartless ipanehement occurred in the earlier sittings when Mrs.\nThompson and I were comparative strangers to one another. I\ndo not mean to suggest that Nelly was very much of an enfant\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 167\nterrible, but she told some tales out of school for which a child\nless privileged and one not removed from the sphere of material\npunishment would, I fancy, have had to suffer.\nStill, I should be doing an injustice to Nelly if I gave the im\npression that she is habitually guilty of grave indiscretions. Her\nindiscretions were never blazing, but innocent enough, and where\nother people's concerns were in question she has always proved\nherself the very soul of delicacy and reserve, I mean in the sense\nthat she was always most careful to refrain from talking about\nthe intimate affairs of former sitters in the presence of strangers,\nthough both about Mrs. Benson's relations and my own she has\nexpressed opinions the reverse of complimentary and in a style\nquite foreign to Mrs. Thompson's courteous nature.\nIt will be obvious that under this section many other incidents\nof the sittings should properly fall, but many such relevant\npassages have been narrated and discussed in other sections of\nthis paper, and, as it would be tedious to go over old ground\nsimply to treat of the questions involved from a slightly different\nstandpoint, I must leave it to the reader to elicit for himself the\nsignificance of such other phenomena as bear upon the relation\nbetween the waking and the trance-consciousness of the medium.\n(5) Mrs. Thompson's Recollections on Waking from Trance.\nOf late years Dr. Hodgson has made a practice of recording\nthe words spoken by Mrs. Piper during the time that she is\nwaking from trance : and so gradual is the process in Mrs.\nPiper's case that Dr. Hodgson has been able to distinguish\ntwo stages which he calls \"Subliminal 1\" and \"Subliminal 2.\"\nIt has also been remarked in the Piper records how often\nan important name or statement has been shot out as the\nmedium was returning to normal consciousness. I have found\nno parallel to this type of phenomenon in Mrs. Thompson's\ntrance-utterances. Her egress from trance is as sudden as\nher entry into it. Using the word almost, if not positively,\nin its literal sense, one second Nelly is speaking and the next\nMrs. Thompson is, if not wide awake, at least awake and\ntalking in her natural voice and manner.\nH\n\f168 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nSo far as my experience goes, the rule is for Nelly to wind\nup the seance even if other controls have been talking ; and the\napproaching end of the trauce is nearly always heralded by Nelly\nannouncing her departure and bidding good-bye. Sometimes the\nleave-taking is prolonged, but as a rule lasts only a minute or\nso. When it is prolonged, this seems to me to have been\ndue to one of two reasons :\u2014either Nelly appears to be\nunable to disentangle herself, so to speak, from the medium's\norganism, or else she is unwilling to go because she wants\nto enjoy a little human gossip. But when she does depart the\nseverance is instantaneous and complete, and accomplished in\nnearly every case without any sign of disturbance or pertur\nbation, bodily or mental. There are no contortions, no groan\ning and travailing ; and so, if we are to follow Dr. Hodgson\nin his estimate of the character of Mrs. Thompson's trance, we\nmust conclude that she has missed this obvious opportunity\nfor the display of effective and easily simulable pantomime.\nBut though her trance presents no analogies to Mrs. Piper's\nin this particular respect, still her waking memory is often\naffected by what has occurred during trance, and I accordingly\npropose to put together all the instances that are to be found\nin the sittings under discussion where this infiltration of the\nnormal consciousness is exhibited.\nDr. van Eeden's sitting on November 2\u00a7th, 1899.\nOn awaking from trance Mrs. Thompson spontaneously\nremarked that she had been in the Jewish sphere : \" Only\nJews there. Be sure to tell Mr. Myers.\" She added that\nshe had been there once before, but forgot to mention it,\nand that a lady in this sphere had said to her : \" You\nforgot to say what 1 told you on your last visit here, that you\nhad been very good to my relative.\" (The message Mr. Myers\nfound quite intelligible : a Jewish friend of his had recently\nhad a good sitting.)\nHere the medium's post-trance recollections of her experiences\nduring trance were independent of the trance communications,\nwhich had nothing whatever to do with Jews. Nelly had\nstated in the course of the sitting that her mother had gone\n\fXLvII.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 109\naway with Mrs. Cartwright and another control to ' her own\nhouse,' that is, the sphere inhabited by these controls ; and\nunless we are to suppose that after this visit Mrs. Cartwright,\nVergil-like, conducted Mrs. Thompson to the Jewish sphere,\nthere is a contradiction between the trance-dream and the\npost-trance memories.\nDr. van Eeden's second sitting on December 1st, 1899.\nNelly's last words were :\u2014\" Why ! That's ' Talks like a\nDutchman.' \" I asked Mrs. Thompson when she awoke, which\nshe did almost as the last word was uttered, what she had\nheard last as she came out of trance. Her reply was :\u2014\n\" She's talking Double-Dutch, or something like that.\"\nDr. van Eeden's fourth sitting on December ith, 1899.\nOn awaking the medium said she felt as if at the top of\na high building. In the course of this sitting the following\nwords had been spoken :\u2014\" You went up a lot of steps round\nand round, and both stood at the top looking. He was very\nfond of talking and thinking about stars\u2014astrology.\" It is\nimmaterial whether these words were to the point or not : what\nis material is that the medium received and retained a sym\npathetic physical sensation resulting from an impression ex\nperienced during the trance.\nMrs. Benson's first sitting on December 18th, 1899.\nThis was one of the occasions referred to above when Nelly\nseemed to find a difficulty in going away. As there appeared\nno chance of any further reference being made to Mrs. Benson's\naffairs I reminded Nelly of a promise that she had given to\ntry to see what Mr. Myers was doing at a given moment\nduring his absence abroad.\nNelly then said :\u2014\" He looks to me as if he was going\nthrough some papers that he ought to have left alone and not\nbothered about. They were a species of work., but not ex\namination papers. He's in a room with a slippery floor\u2014not\nmuch carpet. ' Orthodox ' was one word on Mr. Myers' papers,\nand ' sincerity.' It s like printed paper\u2014not writing ; yet it's\non writing paper.\"\n\f170 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nThe trance soon came to an end ; and I told Mrs. Thompson\nthat Nelly had had a vision of Mr. Myers, but did not tell\nher any details. She thereupon said :\u2014\" I saw him reading\nthe Times in an armchair with plain red back. I didn't\nactually see Times, but I sensed it was the Times because of\nthe size. The walls were in panels, windows down to the\nground-\u2014a very lofty room. He was wearing his glasses to\nread.\"\nMr. Myers commented as follows on these statements:\u2014\n\" True description of reading room at Hotel Royal, San Remo,\nwhere I used to read the Times, but not very distinctive\nperhaps.\"\nNo one of the things said either by Nelly or by Mrs.\nThompson, either about Mr. Myers' occupation or about the\nroom, was sufficiently distinctive in my opinion to warrant\nattributing any such correspondence as there might or may\nhave been to anything more than guess-work : the interest\nlies rather in the differences observable in the two versions\ngiven by Nelly and Mrs. Thompson respectively.\nMrs. Thompson supplements Nelly's account, and in no par\nticular duplicates it, though she contradicts it in one particular:\nnamely, the subject of Mr. Myers' reading. I have omitted\na passage which followed immediately on Nelly's description\nof her vision of Mr. Myers and immediately preceded the\nawakening from trance, because it relates to an incident\nbelonging to the vie intimc of Mr. Myers' family. It was just\nthe kind of incident that Nelly would delight to seize upon;\nbut, whether from a discreet reticence or not, Mrs. Thompson\nmade no reference to it ; so either she shared only a part of\nNelly's perception, or displayed a reserve natural to herself,\nbut foreign to Nelly. I incline to the second alternative, for I\nhave on several occasions noticed that Nelly has not hesitated\nto divulge matters which I feel confident the normal Airs.\nThompson would have kept to herself.\nSitti?iff of January 16th, 1900.\nThis sitting was remarkable as affording what at least to me\nappeared to be one of the most clinching tests of Mrs. Thomp\nson's supernormal powers. A series of communications had pur\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 171\nported to come, for the most part directly, from the spirit whom\nI call Mr. D. I had never heard the D. control, and had\nnot the least notion at that time who it was supposed to\nrepresent. I merely knew that there was such a control, and\nthat the communications made by him or relating to him were\nsaid to be specially good.\nThe sitters on January 16th were Mr. Lionel Earle and a\nlady, whose name I did not and do not know. Neither were\nin any way connected with Mr. D.\nEarly in the sitting (which, so far as the sitters were\nconcerned, was a thoroughly bad one) Nelly said :\u2014\" Mr. D.\nhas told Mother a secret. Ask Mother when she wakes up.\"\nThere was a break in the trance, and Mrs. Thompson, with\nout any question being put to her, said :\u2014\" I feel rather muddled.\nI did see Mr. D., and he said \" (certain words).\nShortly afterwards the trance came on again, and then,\nwhen it was finally over, Mrs. Thompson stated that Mr. D.\nhad a certain nervous habit, and said that she had learnt\nthis fact from Mr. D. directly, who had shown himself to her\nand exhibited the nervous habit several times in order to im\npress it on her memory. Mr. D. had further told her that\n\" Xelly was not right about the first message.\" He \" said\nthat the first message had not been delivered correctly, but\nthat it wasn't worth the trouble of correcting it.\"\nI applied to a former sitter whom the D. communications\nimmediately concerned for verification of the statements con\ntained in the two messages. He replied that, although the\nfirst message seemed to have been muddled in transmission, he\nthought he understood what had been intended. The second\nmessage he declared was absolutely correct, and he asserted\nthat in his opinion, and for reasons which he explained to me,\nand which struck me as well-grounded, Mrs. Thompson could\nnot by any ordinary methods have been cognisant of the fact\ncontained in the second message.\nBut I am not so much concerned with the evidential worth\nof the messages as with the curious aspects of the medium's\nconsciousness exemplified in the method of their delivery.\nNelly announces that Mr. D. has told her mother a secret,\nwhich she will repeat when she awakes. Mrs. Thompson\ndelivers the message when she wakes for the first time, and\n\f172 [part\nJ. G. Piddivgton.\nwhen trance comes on again and Nelly recommences speaking\nshe does not enquire if the message has been given, or evince\nany curiosity about it ; nor does she announce, as in the first\ninstance, the delivery of a second' message. Mrs. Thompson,\nwhen she wakes from the trance for the second and final\ntime, describes her interview in the spirit-world with Mr. D.,\nand how she became acquainted with the fact of his having\npossessed a certain nervous habit. She then added\u2014and this\nis the curious point\u2014that \" Nelly was not right about the first\nmessage \" ; Mr. I). \" said that the first message had not been\ndelivered correctly.\"\nThere is a strange confusion here, for Nelly had nothing\nto do with delivering the first message ; it was delivered by\nMrs. Thompson herself when she awoke from trance.\nIt may be that, although Mrs. Thompson actually voiced\nthe first message, Nelly was instrumental in impressing it\nupon the mind of her mother at the moment of waking. If\nthis was the modus operandi it would explain the remark\nattributed to Mr. D. ; though it would still remain to be ex\nplained how it was that Mrs. Thompson did not detect the\ndiscrepancy.\nAgainst this explanation must be set the fact that the\nfirst message referred specifically to Nelly by name, and had\nNelly known the purport of it, to judge from the interest\nwhich she has displayed on other occasions when any refer\nence has been made to herself, she would not have passed the\nmatter over in silence during the second part of the seance.\nAs an alternative explanation, one might suppose that the\ncommunicating spirit, Mr. D., was unaware of the method of\ntransmission, and imagined that Nelly's intermediary was\nessencial.\nConjectural hypotheses in this style might be extended in\ndefinitely and lead to nothing profitable : I set no store by\nmy own suggestions, and I make them more for the purpose\nof laying stress on the fact of there being a difficulty than\nin the hope of solving it.\nIt could be argued that the confusion was a slip on the\npart of the medium, who was off her guard for a moment, and\nhad overlooked the fact that she was pretending for the occa\nsion to be in direct communication with the spirit-world ; but\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 173\nthis does not appeal to me as a likely solution, and the per\nplexity appears to be such as we might reasonably expect to\npresent itself in a case of multiple personality like Mrs. Thomp\nson's, where the shifting of the two predominant centres of\nconsciousness is effected with so much ease and rapidity.\nSitthig of February 1st, 1900.\nAt this sitting Nelly, as usual, controlled at first. Suddenly\nin the middle of the sitting another control appeared, spoke a\ndozen words, and promptly gave way to Nelly again. Nelly at\nonce said that Mrs. Cartwright would come to explain the\nmomentary and irrelevant intrusion of the unfamiliar control.\nFrom that point to the end of the sitting Mrs. Cartwright and\nNelly spoke in turns, and a most amusing scene ensued, Mrs.\nCartwright casting reflections on Nelly's way of doing her work,\nand Nelly bobbing in and out to mimic Mrs. Cartwright's\npompous and platitudinous manner and diction, and to complain\nof her dictatorial airs.\nNelly, as usual, wound up the sitting, and put in a parting\nshot :\u2014\" Mrs. Cartwright thinks I'm illiterate. ' She always\nthought life not worth living, if you weren't obeyed.' Mrs.\nCartwright says I'm to come before I talk ' insipid nonsense '\n(mimicking Mrs. Cartwright's voice and accent). Her compli\nments come thick and fast.\"\nMrs. Thompson remarked on waking :\u2014\" I've been back to my\nold school at Wenlock, where Airs. Cartwright was. I saw Mrs.\nCartwright.\"\nWe may assume with confidence that there was a casual con\nnection between the medium's trance-dream and the trance-\nutterances ; but which was cause and which effect may be open\nto discussion, though it seems more probable that the business\nof the trance-drama suggested the dream than vice versd.\nSitting of February 6th, 1900.\nThis was one of two sittings where I was present alone ; the\nbulk of the communications concerned myself, but longish refer\nence was made to Mrs. Benson, and Nelly also described a pere\ngrination to Dr. van Eeden's home, and spoke briefly of matters\nconnected with \"Mr. Wilson.\"\n\f174 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nActually the last words spoken by Nelly were a prediction of\nthe date of my next sitting, but this was immediately preceded\nby the following:\u2014\n\" Canon, then Bishop, Bowlby\u2014he came and talked through\nmother. You know that old gentleman Mr. Benson ; he was an\nextreme friend of his. He told mother. He has been talking to\nmother. He was very well known. He was a friend of grand-\nmama Middleton. He was very pompous. Mother used to\nthrow chocolate-creams about at his confirmation class.\"\nA few seconds after coming out of trance Mrs. Thompson\nsaid :\u2014\" I've been among the eminent divines. Canon Bowlby\ntold me I threw chocolate-creams during confirmation class, and\nthat ' he knew Benson ' (repeating the last three words carefully).\nI saw the Rev. W. T. Taylor, Rector of Oldbury, and the other\nwas Linskell, Rector of Beaudesert, in Warwickshire.\"\nAlthough here, as in the last instance, the subject of the\nclosing sentences of the trance-utterances and of Mrs. Thompson's\nwaking recollections was allied, there is this difference between\nthe two cases.\nIn the first the medium's trance-dream corresponded with the\ntrance-drama only in a general way, namely, only to the extent\nthat she found herself back at her old school and in the company\nof her old school proprietress when Mrs. Cartwright had been\nplaying a prominent rdle in the trance-drama ; in this second\ninstance the correspondence was detailed, and, allowing for the\ncharacteristic variation in the versions of Nelly and of Mrs.\nThompson, the trance-utterance and the post-trance memory\npertained to the same incident. Again, in the one case Nelly\nseemed to be unaware of Mrs. Thompson's trance-dream and\nto gather no information from it, while in the other she not only\nknew of it, but profited by it to the extent of acquiring a new\nfact, namely, the existence of some connection between Bishop\nBowlby and Archbishop Benson.\nI note in passing an important and extremely characteristic\ndistinction between Nelly's version and Mrs. Thompson's. Nelly\nsaid that Archbishop Benson was \" an extreme friend \" of Bishop\nBowlby's, whereas Mrs. Thompson makes use of a much less\nstrong expression, namely, \" he knew Benson.\" Nelly's state\nment was untrue ; Mrs. Thompson's was perfectly correct. Ex\naggerated forms of expression are much indulged in by Nelly,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 175\nand many of her statements would have been nearer the mark if\nshe had exercised a greater reserve in her language.\nAfter the trance of April 19th, 1900, Mrs. Thompson had no\nrecollection of any dreams. At a few other sittings I failed to\nremember to ask Mrs. Thompson if she recollected any experience\nduring the trance, or, if I did ask her, she gave a negative reply\nwhich I omitted to record. The interest and possible importance\nof these post-trance memories did not at first strike me, or I\nshould have been careful to interrogate the medium regularly.\nDr. van Eeden's Seventh Sitting of June, 7th 1900.\nIn the middle of this sitting Nelly announced that she was\ngoing away for two minutes. Thereupon Mrs. Thompson awoke\nand said:\u2014\" I smell some sort of anaesthetic stuff like chloroform.\nI can taste it in my mouth. I was dreaming about being chloro\nformed, and your trying to wake me up.\"\nBefore this point what purported to be the spirit of a dead\nfriend of Dr. van Eeden's who had made an unsuccessful attempt\nto commit suicide had been trying to control the medium, though\nwith only partial and momentary success. When the trance\nwas resumed after this break the control seemed to Dr. van\nEeden to become complete.\nDr. van Eeden (see Proceedings, Part XLIV., p. 110) comments\non Mrs. Thompson's waking sensation as follows :\u2014\" This is very\nremarkable, the taste being probably that of iodoform, which was\nused in healing the wound in the throat of my dead friend.\nMrs. Thompson, in reply to inquiry, said that she did not know\nthe smell of iodoform.\"\nDr. van Eeden notes also that since the previous sitting\ntwo days before Mrs. Thompson had had a peculiar cough\nquite unusual to her that was like the suicide's cough. And\nMr. Myers further noted that Mrs. Thompson had told him\nthat this huskiness began when she first saw Dr. van Eeden\non his second visit to England, and had continued throughout\nhis stay, and went off half an hour after his departure (see\nibid., p. 108).\nFor convenience' sake I have classed these two and also subse\nquent instances of physical sensations persisting after trance\nunder the same head as post-trance memories. But this classi\n\f176 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nfication is perhaps superficial. The physical sensations would\nappear to follow \" possession \" by a soi-disant discarnate spirit\nwho in life had suffered from corresponding symptoms, whereas\nthe post-trance memories either bear only a general affinity to\nthe subject matter of the trance-communications or, as in one\ncase, have nothing in common with them.\nThe case where the medium on waking felt as if she were at\nthe top of a high building seems to fall into an intermediate class\nhalf way between physical sensibility and a purely subjective\nimpression aroused by memory.\nSitting of January 3rd, 1901.\nEdward Horace Percival, son of Mrs. Percival, one of the\nsitters on this occasion, purported to control during some time.\nHe had died from an attack of measles, and, as was stated at a\nformer sitting, his breathing had been difficult during the illness.\nHe controlled on two occasions, and each time the medium's\nbreathing during trance was laboured, and she coughed or\nwheezed a good deal. On January 3rd, 1901, Mrs. Thompson\nawoke from the trance groaning and muttering, and said :\u2014\" I'm\nwide awake. I'm only muttering. I could hear myself mutter\ning. Oh ' dear, I'm asthmatical.\" Shortly afterwards she wrote\na message while awake which purported to come from Edward\nHorace Percival. This was one of the only two occasions on\nwhich I witnessed any control other than Nelly bring a seance\nto a termination.\nSitting of January 11th, 1901.\nIn the first part of this sitting Edward Horace Percival con\ntrolled for a short time, and while Nelly was speaking messages\nwere being written automatically by Mrs. Thompson's hand and\nin her natural handwriting, of which it was evidently implied\nthat he was the author. There was a break in the middle of the\nsitting which had been immediately preceded, not by the Percival\ncontrol but, by the Nelly control. During the interval the\nsitters, Mr. and Mrs. Percival, who had been hidden from Mrs.\nThompson's view by a screen, retired into another room. Mrs.\nThompson, hearing some one coughing in the next room, re\nmarked :\u2014\" It's some one with a funeral cough, isn't it ? \" Then,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 177\nafter speaking of an impression which she had had the night\nbefore, she said :\u2014\" I feel asthmatical\u2014a sort of tightness\u2014\na difficulty in breathing and cough \" ; and during the whole\ninterval, which lasted eight minutes, she exhibited in a slightly\nmodified form the symptoms of Edward Horace Percival when\ncontrolling.\nAfter the sitters had left, and without any break in the\ntrance occurring, first a control which purported to be Pro\nfessor Sidgwick appeared for the first time, and then the control\nwhom I call Mr. D. spoke and wrote for about half an hour, and\nbrought the sitting to a close without Nelly reappearing.\nWhen Mrs. Thompson awoke she said :\u2014\" I'm sure that was\nMr. D.\"\nI asked why. \" Because I feel so different,'' she replied. I\nthen asked if she remembered anything, to which came the\nanswer :\u2014\" No. Oh ! yes, I do. I remember hearing Professor\nSidgwick stuttering, and I thought to myself he might have\ndropped the stutter when he got to heaven. He was dressed in\njust ordinary clothes.\"\nSitting of January 21st, 1901.\nThe sitters were Mr. and Mrs. G. F. Raggett, and so far as\nthey were concerned the seance was an entire failure. After\nthey had left, the Sidgwick control spoke for a short time and,\nat the conclusion of a sentence which had been got out with a\nseemingly great effort, Mrs. Thompson awoke suddenly, and in\nreply to my question said she had no recollections, but was\n\" happier now.\" Nelly reappeared for an instant, and then the\ntrance was finally over.\nSitting of July 16th, 1901.\nMr. and Mrs. Percival attended this sitting. Mrs. Cartwright\ncontrolled throughout, and though the communications were\nalmost exclusively concerned with the Percivals' son he did not\ncontrol.\nThe first object presented to the medium was a boy's cap, the\nlining of which bore the name of the shop at which it had been\npurchased, \" Hookham & Co., Oxford.\" Mrs. Cartwright said :\u2014\u25a0\n\" I am taken to Oxford.\"\nAlmost immediately Mrs. Thompson awoke and said that while\n\f178 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nasleep she had seen herself writing \" Oxford.\" She had not\nreally done so, nor, indeed, so far as the rather scanty record of\nthe sitting goes to show, was any automatic script executed\nduring this seance.\nParenthetically I would note the artless way in which Mrs.\nThompson on waking from trance was stupid enough (if she will\npardon me the phrase) to draw attention to the fact that an\nobject handed to her contained a clue of which undoubtedly the\ntrance-personality made use, no matter whether consciously or\nunconsciously. This is hardly the behaviour of an impostor ;\nbut treat it as a genuine phenomenon, and it at once falls into\nline with other recognised phases of multiple personality, which\nnot infrequently manifests an overlapping of two generally dis\ncontinuous strata of consciousness.\nThe cap was obviously a boy's cap, and obviously also a school\ncap ; and Nelly drew the correct inference that the wearer of the\ncap had been at Oxford, not as an undergraduate, but as a\nschool boy.\nBut the cap afforded even another and more definite piece of\ninformation, namely, the name of the wearer, for clearly marked\nin ink on a tape affixed to the inside, and right in the centre of\nthe inside, and in large bold letters, was the name, \" E. H\nPercival.\"\nThis, too, Mrs. Cartwright gave early in the sitting, though in\nthe form Edward Horace Percival, a correct interpretation of the\ninitials.\nIt was not till more than a year after the sitting that it was\nnoticed that the cap bore these indications ; but Mrs. Thompson\ncould not have counted on such an oversight, or even if she had,\nshe would hardly have run the risk of drawing attention to the\nsource of her information by a reference on waking to one of the\nwords in the cap. Although at the sitting of July 16th, 1900,\nthe Christian names Edward Horace were given in their correct\norder, and in the order indicated by the inscription in the cap,\nand though Mrs. Cartwright spoke of him by the name Edward,\non subsequent occasions the names occur in the automatic script\nin the reversed order, Horace Edward, and Nelly speaks always\nof Horace, though Edward was the name by which the boy was\ncalled at least during the greater part of his life by his family\nand friends.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 179\nThis failure to give the names in the proper order at later\nsittings may have been due to a lapse of memory on the part\nof the medium, but it is at any rate worth noting that the names\nwere not correctly given and then transposed by the same trance-\npersonality, but that Mrs. Cartwright gives them in the right\nand Nelly in the wrong sequence. The Percival control writes\nhis names in the wrong order.\nSitting of January 1st, 1901.\nThis sitting was a very poor one as far as the sitter, Miss\nBates, was concerned, though in the course of it Nelly described\ntwo of her peregrinations.\nNelly gave a long account of an incident which had occurred\nin Paris, and in which four persons, including Miss Bates, were\nmixed up. After the sitting Miss Bates pointed out to me\nthat Mrs. Thompson had probably learnt of the incident\nthrough a certain lady, Mrs. S., well known to her. On\nwaking Mrs. Thompson exclaimed :\u2014\" I've got a splitting\nheadache.\" Throughout the whole seance Nelly had been\nextremely cross and restless.\nTwo days later, I having made not the slightest allusion\nto the matter, Mrs. Thompson, before going into trance on\nJanuary 3rd, 1901, asked me whether Nelly had repeated\nany gossip to Miss Bates about the four people in question,\nbecause directly she saw Miss Bates after the trance when the\nscreen was removed, she felt a conviction that Nelly had been\ntalking about a matter which Mrs. S. (the lady mentioned above)\nhad related to her. I then, without telling Mrs. Thompson\nwhat Nelly had said, asked her to give me Mrs. S.'s version\nof the affair : which she did. It corresponded fairly closely\nwith the version given by Nelly, due allowance being made for\nthe natural difference between a child's and a grown-up woman's\nversion of a piece of rather silly grown-up gossip.\nIn short, as Miss Bates rightly conjectured, the incident\ndescribed by Nelly was perfectly well known to Mrs. Thompson.\nIt would be ludicrous to hold that reproduction in the trance\nof knowledge consciously possessed by the medium is indicative\nof fraud. What primd facie is more suspicious is the medium's\nknowledge of what had been spoken about in the trance. But\n\f180 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nMrs. Thompson's suspicion that Nelly had been repeating a\nstory known to herself is not an isolated phenomenon, as we\nhave already seen, but can be paralleled by the instance just\nquoted where, when not entranced, she remembered seeing herself\nwriting the word Oxford which had been within her visual\nrange when entranced and which Nelly had previously uttered.\nInstances have been or will be quoted (see pp. 161, 224-5,\n272) where Mrs. Thompson showed knowledge of what had\ntaken place in the trance : though in some of these cases she\nclaims to have received her information from Nelly. Complete\namnesia then is not a characteristic of Mrs. Thompson's trance,\nand in this she differs from Mrs. Piper.\nNow if Mrs. Thompson is an impostor, it is fair to assume\nthat she wishes to imitate, if not to rival, the phenomena\nof Mrs. Piper. Why then should she here have failed to\nmodel her performance on this classical case, and to imitate\nthis essential characteristic of Mrs. Piper's trance ? There\nare, of course, many and important resemblances between the\ntwo ; but there are also some important differences. Thus,\nwhile Dr. Hodgson believes as the result of his long, acute\nand searching investigation that Mrs. Piper \" is entirely ignorant\nof what occurs during trance,\" the same cannot be said of Mrs.\nThompson. Again \" Phinuit is, or pretends to be equally un\naware of the knowledge possessed by Mrs. Piper, and of the\nincidents which happen to her in her ordinary life.\" Nelly\nneither is, nor pretends to be similarly ignorant. But, it might\nbe argued, Mrs. Thompson's knowledge of what has occurred\nduring trance is only very rarely manifested, and she occasionally\ndrops the pretence of complete amnesia deliberately in order to\ncover the cases in which she has done so inadvertently. There\nwould, I admit, be cause for such a suspicion if it were not that,\nunlike Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Thompson has on several occasions shown\nthat trance is not an essential condition for the exercise of her\nsupernormal faculties. I shall give the evidence for this state\nment later on (see pp. 182-196), and in the meanwhile I shall\ncontent myself with showing the bearing which this fact has\non the point under discussion.\nIf there is good evidence to show that Mrs. Thompson in\nher normal state can possess herself of knowledge which could\nnot have reached her in an ordinary way, then there is nothing\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 181\ninconsistent in her claim to occasional acquaintance with what\nhas passed during the trance.\nIt is simpler to imagine that the source of this acquaintance\nis Nelly, no matter whether Nelly be a secondary consciousness\nor a spirit ; but there are of course less shadowy personalities on\nwhom she might draw telepathically, namely, the sitter, the\nrecorder or any one who has read the record of a sitting.\nSitting of December 20th, 1900.\nAs she was in the act of waking from trance, Mrs.\nThompson grasped at some books lying on a writing-table\nby which she was sitting, and said in a rather excited and\nstartled way :\u2014\" I saw a hand on the top of these books.\"\nNeither my hand nor the hand of the sitter had been on the\ntable, nor had anything occurred during the trance to suggest\nthe idea of a hand.\nSitting of January 8th, 1901.\nAt intervals during this sitting Geoffrey Scott was con\ntrolling, and the medium was rather restless. The end of\nthe trance was abrupt and sudden. Nelly was speaking\nand the Scott control speaking or writing short unfinished\nsentences in quick succession, and in the middle of a written\nsentence the medium began to wake. She was shuddering\nand muttering, and, as she was at the point of regaining con\nsciousness, she said, \"Feef\" (pronouncing these three letters\njust as Nelly usually pronounces the first syllable of the\nword \" fearfully \"). \" I hate it\u2014this treatment \" (very em\nphatically). Then when quite awake, she added :\u2014\" I felt\nsuch a bang. I thought some one knocked me. I seemed\nto be looking somewhere, and then some one seemed to shove\ntheir elbow into me and knock me away.''\nI ought, perhaps, to have treated this as a third exception\nto the general rule throughout this series of sittings that\nNelly brings a seance to an end ; but I hesitated to do so,\nbecause the words \" Feef\u2014I hate it\u2014this treatment \" cannot\nbe attributed to the Scott control, and ought, perhaps, to be\nascribed to Nelly. If, however, they were really spoken by\nthe barely conscious Mrs. Thompson, then the Scott control\n\f182 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nwas the last to manifest before the medium came to ; and it\nwould then be rather singular that these three exceptions\noccurred at successive sittings, namely, at those held on\nJanuary 1st, 3rd, and 8th, 1901.\nBeyond the fact that the medium seemed disturbed through\nout the trance, and that Mrs. Thompson seemed a little agitated\nwhen she woke up, she was not thrown from her chair, nor\ndid she sustain any physical injury as on another occasion\nwhich 1 have described elsewhere (see pp. 147-8), when Nellr\nattributed, and, as I think, wrongly attributed, the mishap to\nthe unsuccessful and unskilful efforts of Geoffrey Scott to\ncontrol.\n(6) The Exercise of Supernormal Faculty by Mrs. Thompson\nwhen not Entranced.\nAn instance of a veridical crystal-vision obtained by Mrs.\nThompson when not in trance has already been recited (see\npp. 112-114), and I now proceed to give another and in my\nopinion much more remarkable instance of her acquisition,\u2014\nI do not say when in a normal state, but, at least, when not\nin trance,\u2014of information which could not have reached her\napparently by any recognised channel. As both these cases\noccurred when Mrs. Thompson was alone at home, it is,\nof course, impossible to express any opinion as to her con\ndition at the time ; but later other similar cases will be\ndescribed which took place in my presence, and on these\noccasions Mrs. Thompson was to all outward seeming wide\nawake ; indeed much more so than many other people ever\nappear to be, even at the best of times.\nIncident of May 24\/A, 1900.\nOn May 24th, 1900, Mrs. Thompson gave a sitting at my\nhouse. Mr. Myers acted as recorder and I was not present,\nand had not attended any sitting since April 19th. After\nthe sitting, Mrs. Thompson came upstairs to the drawing-room\nto have tea, and, before tea was served, she told me the story\n\fxlvji.] Plwnomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 183\nwhich is given below in her own words, except for a few\nalterations introduced by myself in order to conceal the\nidentity of a person mentioned by Mrs. Thompson.\nMrs. Thompson's Account.\nMay 2ith, 1900.\nOn Monday, May 7th, 1900, about 7.30 in the evening, I\nhappened to be sitting quite alone in the dining-room, and\nthinking of the possibility of my \" subliminal \" communicating\nwith that of another person\u2014no one in particular. I was not\nfor one moment unconscious. All at once 1 felt some one\nwas standing near, and quickly opened my eyes, and was very\nsurprised to see\u2014clairvoyantly, of course\u2014Mr. J. G. Piddington.\nI was very keen to try the experiment : so at once spoke\nto him aloud. He looked so natural and life-like I did not\nfeel in the least alarmed.\nI commenced :\u2014\n\"Please tell me of something I may afterwards verify to\nprove I am really speaking to you.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" I have had a beastly row with \" [naming\na specified person].\nR. T. :\u2014\"What about?\" (No answer to this.)\n\/. G. P. :\u2014\" He says he did not intend to annoy me, but\nI said he had been very successful in doing so, whether he\nintended to or not.\"\nAfter saying this he disappeared, and I began to wonder\nif there was any truth in what I had heard from\u2014what\nappeared to me to be\u2014Mr. Piddington. I did not like to write\nand to ask him if it was so. On May 24th, I had an oppor\ntunity of telling him, and was very surprised to hear it was\nthe truth.\nI also told him I had guessed at the subject of the \" beastly\nrow.\" My conjecture was quite accurate.\n(Signed) Rosalie Thompson.\nP.S.\u2014People often ask me how I talk with Nelly : just as\nI talked with Mr. Piddington on May 7th. I seem to see and\nfeel what they are saying. The lips appear to move, but they\nmake no audible sound. Yet unless \/ speak aloud they do\nnot seem to understand me. I have tried Nelly when she\nN\n\f184 [part\nJ. G. Piddivgton.\nappears to me by asking mental questions, but she does not\nunderstand unless I speak aloud and very clearly.\nR. T.\nWriting to Mr. Myers on May 30th, 1900, I expressed\nmyself as follows :\u2014\nI entirely endorse Mrs. Thompson's account. I made her\ndescribe the incident in full before saying whether the story-\ncorresponded in any way with actual facts.\nOne point I think Mrs. Thompson has omitted from her\naccount. I feel nearly certain that she described herself as\nhaving been aware that the quarrel was conducted by corres\npondence, as was the case, and not vim voce. The corres\npondence took place between April 28th and May 1st. Mrs.\nThompson's experience was on May 7th. ... I think it highly\nimprobable that Mrs. Thompson could have had any knowledge\nof the \" beastly row \" in an ordinary way, and of the fact that\nmy correspondent professed to have had no desire to annoy\nme, and of my observation thereon, impossible. I do not\nremember, and have no means of recalling, what I was doing\nabout 7.30 p.m. on May 7th\u2014probably dressing for dinner.\nIt was this experience of Mrs. Thompson's which compelled\nmy belief in her supernormal powers. At the time I saw no\nway of getting round it and I see no way now. But to my\ngreat regret I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose all\nthe circumstances. The case must accordingly lose much of\nits evidential value, and I therefore cannot hope that it will\nproduce on others the same conviction that it has on myself.\nThe quarrel, as has been already explained, was conducted\nentirely by correspondence. My correspondent is a person whom\nMrs. Thompson has never seen. He lives in the country, and\nthough he has, since the date of this incident, heard of Mrs.\nThompson he has never seen her, and takes no interest in her\nor her phenomena, and indeed is, I gather, mildly hostile to\npsychical research. From him Mrs. Thompson most certainly\ndid not obtain the facts. Could she have got them from me\nor through her acquaintance with me, or by picking up\ninformation on one of her visits to my house ?\nThe facts connected with the quarrel were known to only\nthree or four persons, of whom only one except myself, namely,\nmy wife, was or is known to Mrs. Thompson. My wife did not\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 185\nmention the subject to Mrs. Thompson : and it is not a subject\nwhich I should ever have thought of mentioning to her. The\nperson with whom I quarrelled wrote me two letters. These\ntwo letters were kept among a mass of others in a room at\nthe top of my house into which Mrs. Thompson has never been :\nshe has never even been on the floor on which the room is.\nMy correspondent's statement that he had not intended to\nannoy me was contained in a letter addressed to my wife. She\nread this letter to me at breakfast one morning, and almost\nimmediately afterwards destroyed it. I believe the actual words\nthat I said to my wife when she read the phrase from the letter\nwere :\u2014 Then he succeeded admirably without intending to.\"\nIt will be remarked that Mrs. Thompson guessed at the\nsubject of the quarrel after the vision had passed, and guessed\nit correctly. Had Mrs. Thompson got no further than the fact\nand the subject of the quarrel, I should not have thought so\nmuch of it. Possibly even if she had been very lucky she might\nhave guessed the sort of person with whom I was at loggerheads ;\nand though I should have been surprised, I should not have\nbeen deeply impressed. But the two other details\u2014my corre\nspondent's disclaimer of intent to annoy and my observation\nthereon\u2014I know she could not have learned and I do not\nbelieve she could have guessed.\nI am only too conscious of how this case suffers from the\nreticence with which the circumstances compel me to treat it.\nBut even had I been able without offending contra bonus mores to\npublish the full details without reserve or modification, I could\nnot expect it to create on others the deep impression that it\ndid on me. I can satisfy myself and yet fail to satisfy others of\nthe inaccessibility to Mrs. Thompson of all normal sources from\nwhich knowledge of the facts could have been drawn.\nBut it is not only the veridicality of the vision, but also\nthe form of it which deserves attention.\nWith eyes open and experiencing no conscious lapse of con\nsciousness Mrs. Thompson sees and cross-examines a phantasm\nof the living. The phantasm refuses to answer one question,\nami after it has vanished the percipient guesses\u2014consciously\nguesses\u2014makes a shot at\u2014the answer, and guesses right. Was\nthis mere dramatisation ? or do we here get a hint of a com\nbination of processes which may play a great part in clairvoyant\n\f186 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nphenomena ? that is, a combined exercise of supernormal faculty\nand of normal inference either from facts previously known or\nfrom knowledge just supernormally received ?\nIt seems to me now, and it seemed to me at the time, that it\nis just possible that when once Mrs. Thompson had learnt that\nI had had \" a beastly row \" and that that row had been between\nmyself and a certain person, she might by a lucky shot have hit\non the subject of the row.\nIs there, though, something more than this ? I fancy there\nmay be. Something, namely, that confirms the correctness of\nthe deduction normally arrived at. Thus I imagine that though\nMrs. Thompson may have through the exercise of her ordinary\nmental faculties have guessed at the subject of my quarrel, some\nother faculty was called into play to confirm the truth of the\ninference : and whatever that other suppositional faculty is, I\nconceive that it is akin to telepathy and supernormal.\nIncident of October 21st, 1902.\nCopy of a letter addressed by me to Sir Oliver Lodge on\nOctober 21st, at 7.15 p.m., and read by him on October 22nd,\n1902, and endorsed to that effect:\u2014\nI am making a note of something that occurred this after\nnoon with Mrs. Thompson in the form of a letter to yon,\nso that if anything further happens, there will be evidence to\nshow what my recollections and impressions were this\nevening.\nI met Mrs. Thompson by appointment at 20 Hanover\nSquare, downstairs in the front hall, at 5 p.m. this afternoon.\nI came down from the S.P.R. rooms to meet her, and found\nher, as arranged, awaiting me in the hall. At any rate then\nshe had not had a chance of seeing any letters written by or\nto Mr. Thomas. (You will see the bearing of this remark\nlater on.) We then went to get some tea, and she talked\non various subjects. Just as she was bidding me good-bye\nshe suddenly said :\u2014\n\" What about Kiel 1 \"\nI said :\u2014\" What do you mean ? \"\n\" When you were talking about going abroad soon I some\nhow got an impression of Kiel.\"\n\"Well, anything else?\"\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 187\n\"So then I began to visualize, and I got a picture of an\n(lold) gipsy woman with a (?red) shawl over her head (or\nround her head).\"\n\"Anything more i\"\n\" No ; but does it mean anything 1 \"\n\"Yes, it has some meaning, but I am not going to tell\nyou anything more. If you get any further impressions, let\nme know. Anyhow, write it down as soon as you get home,\nand send it to me. When, b3'-the-way, did you first get the\nimpression 1 \"\n\" Oh ! when we were talking of Polly's varicose veins.\" (I\nhad asked Mrs. Thompson to meet me in order to obtain\nfrom her some information bearing on a statement made by\nNelly about a lady who suffered from varicose veins.)\nThen we parted.\nBefore meeting Mrs. Thompson I had wondered whether\nshe would have had an impression of Mr. Thomas's anxieties,\nwhich are connected with some friends living at Kiel, and,\nalthough I did not actually say the word \"Kiel\" to myself,\nKiel was definitely connected with my passing fancy.\nA friend of Mr. Thomas's has lately been consulting a\nfortune-teller at Kiel. I don't remember Mr. Thomas describ\ning the fortune-teller as a gipsy (though he may have done so),\nand I feel fairly certain that he never mentioned her wearing\na shawl over her head.\nI don't know if Mrs. Thompson knows of Mr. Thomas's\nconnection with Kiel. \/ have never been there, and have no\nassociation of any kind with the place, though a few days\nago my wife and I were discussing its exact geographical\nposition.\nJust before I met Mrs. Thompson, Mr. Thomas had written\nthe name of a member of the S.P.R. on a scrap of paper as a\nmemorandum for me. Wishing to make a note of something\nsaid by Mrs. Thompson, I took this scrap of paper out of\nmy pocket, and wrote the note on it. Mrs. Thompson then\nwished to write some names down for me, and took the\nscrap of paper from me in order to do so. I stopped her\nfrom writing on it, as it was too small, and gave her\ninstead another piece of paper. She may have seen and\nrecognised Mr. Thomas's handwriting, which was, however,\non the underside, and not on the side on which I had been\n\f188 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nwriting ; and if she knew of Mr. Thomas's connection with\nKiel, this may have suggested the impression.\nBut if so why did she connect we with Kiel ? . . .\nMrs. Thompson, on her return home, wrote me the following\nletter :\u2014\nOctober 21st, \/02.\nWhy did you say this afternoon when I mentioned about\nKiel, \" I shall not tell you anything, you must go home and\nwrite an account of what you saw and post it to me 1 \"\nYou said : \"I am probably going abroad shortly, so have\nmuch work on hand at present.\" Immediately \" Kiel \" seemed\nto flash before me, and then I saw an old-looking, but middle-\naged, gipsy woman telling fortunes with a plaid round her, and\nI think this in some way fell over her head.\nI have tried since but can get nothing more, it only seemed\na flash. I have never been in Kiel, and know nothing of\nthe place or its people. I think I may sometimes eat Kiel\nbutter !\nThe following note was written by Mr. X. W. Thomas, and\nis dated October 23rd :\u2014\u25a0\nAfter hearing J. G. P.'s letter to Dr. Lodge and Mrs.\nThompson's to J. G. P., I note the following points :\nI was told by Fran Prof. B[ ] that Frau S. (the for\ntune-teller) had said she learnt her fortune-telling from a (! old)\ngipsy woman when she was 16. When I saw Frau S. she\nwore a red dress, but no shawl or plaid.\nFrau S. is about 40, and does not look at all like a gipsy.\nN. W. Thomas.\nOn November 5th, 1902, Mr. N. W. Thomas wrote:\u2014\nFraulein M. B. writes that she went to Frau S. [i.e. the\nfortune-teller] at the end of last week, and found her wrapped\nin a coloured shawl (over her head, too, I gather).\nOn October 23rd, 1902, Mr. K W. Thomas informed me\nthat he felt sure that Mrs. Thompson knew nothing of his\nconnection with Kiel. Mrs. Thompson knew that I visit\nBrussels, Berlin, Paris, and Berne occasionally, but she could\nhave no reason whatever to suppose that I was going to Kiel,\nas I have never been, and am not likely to go there.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 189\nAt the time of this incident I knew that Fraulein B. was\nseeing a fortune-teller at Kiel, and that Mr. Thomas was inter\nested in the fortune-telling, and was having proper records\nkept of the fortune-teller's utterances ; but, as stated in my\nletter to Sir 0. Lodge, I probably knew nothing of her having\nlearnt her art from a gipsy, nor of her wearing a red or any\nsort of shawl round her head.\nIncident of October 17th, 1902.\nOn the afternoon of October 17th, 1902, Mrs. Thompson\nhad called at 20 Hanover Square; I do not now remember\nfor what purpose. Just as she was going away she said\nto me :\u2014\n\" Has Mrs. Finch been up in a balloon ? The night after\nthe account appeared in the morning papers of the airship\naccident I woke up thinking that Mrs. Finch was in the\nballoon.\"\nMrs. Finch is an Australian lady living in Paris, and is\nknown to Mrs. Thompson and myself. Although she is one\nof the last people in the world whom I should have thought\nlikely to make a balloon ascent, I wrote to Professor Charles\nRichet, who knows her well, to ask if there was any meaning\nin Mrs. Thompson's dream.\nIt appears from M. Richet's reply that Mrs. Finch did\nmake a balloon ascent in July, 1902 ; though she luckily was\nnot involved in the fatal accident to M. Severo's airship as\nMrs. Thompson had dreamt. Mrs. Finch's participation in a\nballoon ascent in July, 1902, was spoken of not only in the\nParis papers but also in the English papers. One French\npaper at least, Le Temps, gave her name and nationality, and\npossibly, even probably, the English papers copied both items.\nMrs. Thompson may, of course, have seen a mention of a\nballoon ascent in which an Australian lady took part at Paris,\nor she may have actually seen it stated that Mrs. Finch\nmade an ascent, but, if so, she had no recollection on\nOctober 17th, 1902, of having done so. An incident of this\nkind can never be evidential, as it is impossible to exclude\nthe chance of Mrs. Thompson having at some time acquired\nthe facts in a normal way. But convinced as I am that\nMrs. Thompson has far too clear a grasp of what constitutes\n\f190 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\ngood evidence to waste her time over concocting halting little\nstories of this kind, I cannot regard this dream impression as\nother than a perfectly genuine experience, though inconclusive\nof supernormal faculty. Treating it then as genuine, I suppose\nthat the orthodox view of it would be something of this\nkind :\u2014\nMrs. Thompson had read in the English or French news\npapers in July, 1902, of Mrs. Finch's exploit. (If Mrs.\nFinch's name was not given in any paper seen by Mrs.\nThompson, then it can be supposed that Mrs. Thompson read\nan account in which Mrs. Finch was merely described as \"an\nAustralian lady \" ; and that probably, not knowing of more\nthan one Australian lady living in Paris, she subconsciously\nconnected the balloonist with Mrs. Finch.) Three months\nlater, when all conscious recollection of Mrs. Finch's balloon\nascent has faded completely away, she reads of the Severo\nairship accident. This suggests the dream, and in the dream-\nstate the submerged memory of Mrs. Finch's balloon ascent\nis revived, and a characteristically confused dream results.\nSome such explanation as that is the \" correct \" one, I\nshould say : it is the line I should advise a candidate for our\nResearch Scholarship to take if he were asked for his comments\non this incident. But I am by no means sure that it is the\ntrue explanation.\nI reject any explanation which supposes fraud on Mrs. Thomp\nson's part, not only on general grounds but also for reasons which\nresult from an examination of what fraud would involve in this\ninstance. Fraud would mean that Mrs. Thompson knew of Mrs.\nFinch's balloon excursion : had the self-restraint to hold this\npiece of knowledge in reserve and to wait until another\nevent of aeronautic interest occurred in order to hash\nup the two together in a form which might perhaps\nappeal by its subtlety to the jaded appetite of some psychical\nresearcher.\nI cannot believe that so intricate a <rame could be thought\nby any medium to be worth the candle. But that consideration\napart, no one would have been better aware than Mrs.\nThompson that the S.P.R. could be relied on to enquire if\nany knowledge displayed by a medium could have been\nnormally acquired, that in this case the simplest enquiry\n\fxlvii.J Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 191\nwould have disclosed a possible source of her knowledge, and\nthat, this possible source once learnt, her pretended dream-\nimpression would be bereft of all evidential value. Against\nany possible value, too, that she might hope to see attached\nby a few observers to this incident she must have recognised\nthat there would have to be set the suspicion of others of\nher having concocted the whole thing.\nI reject, then, any explanation which involves fraud ; and\nwhile T do not reject what I have called the orthodox inter\npretation, though it involves several suppositions, which, if\nnot unlikely taken separately, are at least not highly probable\nwhen taken cumulatively, I am more inclined to adopt the\nfollowing hypothesis :\u2014namely, that knowledge of Mrs. Finch's\nballoon ascent had been acquired supernormally by Mrs.\nThompson either at or near the time when it took place,\nor at any rate previously to her dream, and had lain dormant\nin her subconsciousness until awakened by a natural association\nof ideas set in motion on her reading about the accident to\nthe airship, and not even then emerging into her full conscious\nness, but emerging only in a hypnopompic dream, and then\nagain only with the confusion typical of dreams.\nI have perhaps treated what at first sight may have the\nappearance of a very trifling matter at undue length ; but\nin the case of mediums for the genuineness of whose phenomena\nthere is good evidence, I think there is justification for ex\namining closely some of their less full-blown manifestations,\ntheir casual by-products as it were, on the chance that we\nmay therefrom gather some hint of the obscure laws at work\nmore readily than from the more well-defined phenomena.\nAnd if I have rightly traced the mental processes which\nengendered Mrs. Thompson's dream we have here in simple\nform a case analogous to some of the more complex phenomena\nof her trance.\nThus here knowledge of Mrs. Finch's balloon adventure\nreaches Mrs. Thompson's subliminal, but does not filter into\nher supraliminal until after she has read about the air-ship\naccident. This awakening in the supraliminal consciousness\nof so closely allied a train of thought appears to have given\nthe subliminal a chance to transmit its knowledge to the\nsupraliminal stratum, not, however, immediately, but on the\n\f192 [PAKT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nfirst favourable opportunity, namely, the moment between\nsleeping and waking. Exhausted with its effort, let us sup\npose, or uninfluenced by the suggestion of the seance room,\nthe subliminal is content to convey its message in an un\nadorned form ; Mrs. Thompson merely thinks that Mrs. Finch\nwas in the balloon.\nIn what I term Nelly's \" peregrinations,\" to be dealt with\nin the next section, there is the same apparently supernormal\nacquisition of knowledge about friends or acopiaintances at a\ndistance, the same impenetrability of the supraliminal. Only\nin these cases no favourable opportunity occurs for the sub\nliminal to communicate its knowledge to the supraliminal.\nThe subliminal, however, gets its chance to impart its news\nduring the trance, and conveys it, not as a simple thought,\nimpressed on the brain at the moment of waking, but with\nappropriate dramatic detail.\nThe case where Mrs. Thompson when not in trance seemed\nto herself to be holding converse with my \" astral form \" I\nshould regard as intermediate between the dream about Mrs.\nFinch and the \" peregrinations \" of Nelly. For in it we\nseem to see the two divisions of the consciousness in syn\nchronous and no longer disparate activity ; the supraliminal\nnot in abeyance as in trance, but able to retain a clear\nmemory of the subliminal's proceedings ; the subliminal in\nfull tela'sthetic vigour, capable of a partial dramatisation, and\nyet unable to impose on the alert and sceptical supraliminal\nthe complete stage-business of the spiritistic seance.\nIncident of January \\Ath, 1903.\nMrs. Thompson called at the Rooms of the Society on the\nafternoon of Wednesday, January 14th, 190o, just as some\nthought-transference experiments were being brought to a\nclose. I asked her to try two experiments with the subjects\nwith whom we had just been working, and under the same\nconditions ; namely, percipient in one room and agent in\nanother. She consented, and two experiments were made,\nMrs. Thompson being agent in one and percipient in the\nother. Neither was successful.\nWe chatted for a moment or so after this : other people\njoining in the conversation. As she was preparing to go,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 193\nand almost in the act of saying good-bye, and as she was in\nthe act of leaving the room, she turned to me laughing and\npointing to my overcoat which was lying over the back of a\nchair in the neighbourhood of the door, said :\u2014\" I'm going to\npsychometrize your coat. There was some trouble about paying\nfor it : some bad notes.\"\nWhile speaking these words, in spite of her having used\nthe term \" psychometrize,'' she neither touched the coat nor\ndid she move nearer to it. She was thoroughly wide awake,\nnot in the least dreamy or trancified, but there was a\nsymptom which I did not remark on the other occasions on\nwhich when not in trance she described clairvoyant impressions\nand which I think I may safely say was not then displayed.\nAs she spoke the few words quoted above, a tinge\u2014a smack\u2014\na dash\u2014I don't exactly know what to call it\u2014of the Nelly\nmanner came over her; there was the curious unmistakable\nand characteristic pulling down of one side of the face, which\nalways accompanies the Nelly impersonation, and the half\nlisp, half simper which is the distinguishing mark of Nelly's\nutterance. The mollification of the voice and manner was\nmomentary, but, though I doubt if a stranger would have\nremarked it, quite unmistakable to any one familiar with\nMrs. Thompson's trance-state.\nAs to the statement about my great-coat, the coincidence\nbetween it and the real facts is not exact, but too close to\nattribute with confidence to chance.\nI had purchased the coat ready-made at a shop where 1\nhad not dealt before and was consequently unknown. As I\nwas starting on a journey the next day, I wanted it to be\ndelivered the same evening. I offered in payment a cheque,\nwhich I made out in the shop. The sum named in the\ncheque contained a numeral of two syllables, and this numeral\nI failed to spell correctly. Feeling doubtful of my orthography\nI applied to the shopman for information, which he gave me\nwith a condescending though pitying smile. But my failure\nto spell a very simple word had evidently aroused his sus\npicions, and a consultation with the shop-manager ensued,\nwhich resulted in my being told with many polite expressions\nof regret that it would be impossible to let me have the\ncoat the same night. I insisted that I must have it the\n\f194 [part\n\/. G. Piddington.\nsame night, whereupon another and longer consultation with\nthe manager took place, and I was eventually informed that\nthey much regretted, etc., etc., but the coat could not be\ndelivered to me till the following day, which meant, of\ncourse, until there had been time to see if my cheque was\ngood. I then said that I quite understood their hesitation\nand the cause of it, gave a reference and got my coat the\nsame evening.\nI was rather amused by the incident and told my wife\nabout it when I got home, and if I told any one else, it was\nnot at any rate any one from whom Mrs. Thompson is likely\nto have heard of it. And indeed it seems clear that Mrs.\nThompson had not been told of this very trivial episode, for\nin so far as it had any interest, the interest depended on\nthe details, and if Mrs. Thompson had heard the story at\nall and reproduced it, the reproduction would have shown\ntraces of the original narrative, whereas the statement made\nby Mrs. Thompson on January 14th, 1903, is not only not\nin exact correspondence with the facts, but is as bald as it\nwell could be.\nMrs. Thompson spoke of \" bad notes,\" meaning presumably\nbad bank notes, whereas I paid by cheque. Without insisting\non the point, which is a very small one, I think it just\nworth remarking that the mention of notes instead of a\ncheque or cash goes in favour of Mrs. Thompson having\ngleaned her information supernormally. Bad bank notes are\nexcessively rare in England, and accordingly the chances of a\ncasual reference to bad bank notes having been offered in\npayment proving relevant must be very remote. If a shot\nwas going to be made at all, the trouble would be more\nreasonably assigned to a bad cheque, which is not an un\ncommon thing.\nIncident of March 1st, 1900.\nProfessor C. Moutonnier, formerly Professor at the Ecolc\ndcs hatitcs Etudes Commcrcialcs a Paris, sent to Mr. Myers the\nfollowing account of how he made the acquaintance of Mrs.\nThompson, and also a record of a sitting which he had with\nher. It will be seen that Professor Moutonnier is under the\nimpression that Mrs. Thompson did not lose consciousness when\n\fXLvli.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson'* Trance. 105\non March 1 3th, 1900, she met him for the second time in\nthe gardens at Monte Carlo. But I think there can be little\ndoubt that she was really in trance, and if she was, it only\nshows how very slightly marked are the external differences\nbetween her normal and her trance state.\nThe record of this romantic open-air seance ought strictly\nnot to come under the head of the \" Exercise of supernormal\nfaculty when not in trance,' but I include it here both for\nits intrinsic interest, and for convenience of reference, so as\nnot to separate the introductory episode from its interesting\nsequel.\nWith regard to her first meeting with Professor Moutonnier,\nMrs. Thompson writes :\u2014\" I shall never forget the strange\nimpulse which made me attack the old folks sitting on the\nseat with their little dog.\"\nHyeres (Var) Villa \"Val Fleuri,\" March 3lst, 1900.\nDear Sir,\nI am most happy to comply with your request, and to give you\na detailed and true account of ray meeting with Mrs. Thompson,\nand the phenomenon I obtained through her mediumship. It was,\nindeed, the most remarkable case I ever witnessed, and I hope it\nmay bring some new light to your investigations.\nHow I became acquainted with Mrs. Thompson.\nOn February the 10th, I received from Prof. C. Richet an invi\ntation to attend some psychical experiments which were to take place\nat his chateau at Carqueiranne, together with Professors Myers and\nJames. The names of the mediums he did not mention to me.\nSuch a great treat I considered most highly, and anticipated the\nbenefit I would be able to derive from the researches of three\nwell-known scientists. But, unfortunately, a second letter answering\nmine came a few days after, informing me that the Professor was\nprevented from coming to Carqueiranne, and I had to give up the\nhope I had been indulging in so much.\nI was then on a visit at my daughter's at Monte Carlo, with my\nfamily, quite unaware of Mrs. Thompson being at the same place,\nas I did not know her, either by name or sight.\nOn the 1st of March, between 10 and 11 a.m., I was sitting on\na bench with my wife, in one of the most retired spots of the gardens\nfacing the Casino, where they keep the chamois, and few people go\n\f196 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nby. While we were chatting together and commenting the events\nof the day, I saw coming up to us three persons, a gentleman ac\ncompanied by a lady and a little girl, eleven years old. The lady\naddressed us in English (without knowing our nationality) as old\nfriends, and in such a familiar way as only those already acquainted\nwith the subject could take any interest in her conversation. She\ntold us, ex abrupto, and without being questioned, that she came\nfrom a chateau at Carqueiranne belonging to Professor Richet, where\nshe had been staying for some time with the Professors Myers and\nJames, and where Professor Richet was to meet them for some\npsychical research, but was afterwards prevented from attending.\nOn my asking her whether she would consider the fact as a mere\nchance, or attribute it to some unknown cause, she answered that\nshe had been guided to me by her little spirit-girl, notwithstanding\nthat her husband insisted going by another alley ; and that, as soon\nas she perceived us, she saw written before her eyes the word\n\" Carqueiranne,\" which gave birth to the whole story I just related.\nGreat was her surprise when I told her we were intimate friends\nof Professor Richet, and greater still my joy on learning that she\nwas one of the two mediums I was to meet at Carqueiranne. We\ntook leave of Mrs. Thompson and her family after having made an\nappointment for a regular seance.\nA Stance with Mrs. Thompson.\nOur next meeting took place on the 13th of March, at the same\nspot and the same hour, 11 A.M., by a beautiful sunny day, and in\nthe most romantic resort one could dream of.\nWere present : Mrs. Thompson (the medium), and her husband, my\nwife and self, and my grand-daughter, Violet Fenton, aged seventeen.\nAfter about a quarter of an hour chatting on different topics, Mrs.\nThompson\u2014without1 losing consciousness\u2014was all of a sudden taken\nhold of by her spirit-girl, who spoke through her in the following\nmanner and terms, written down word by word as uttered from the\nlips of the medium :\u2014\n1. \" Tlie lady who is standing back of you says that you have\na ring of hers, and you should give it to me.\n2. \" She mentions that Long Henry wants to send a message\nto the one who was a little girl.\n1 [In the original Mrs. Thompson had here inserted and initialled the word\n\"apparently.\"\u2014J.

I handed\nit to her ; she put it on her forehead, but said she could not\nget anything from it.\n5. Hairy was Mr. Teuton's Christian name. Henry's health\nhad always been very poor, and his tallness caused him to stoop\na little. He was taken very ill, two years ago, and resorted to\nhis native country, Holland, where he died amidst his relatives.\n6. When we last saw him in Paris\u2014at luncheon\u2014he wore a\nblack cut-away coat and a black necktie.\n7. Both my daughter and her husband died leaving a girl\u2014\nthen six years old, their only child.\n8. The person alluded to by Long Henry is myself. I was then\na professor at the jZcole des hautes Etudes commerciales at Paris.\n9. After my daughter's death we found many little boxes, where\nshe kept her jewels. I, of course, was ignorant of the fact, but\nmy other daughter, her sister (mentioned by the medium as being\nthe painting lady, and who is in reality an artist painter) very\nlikely knew all about it.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson'is Trance. 199\n10. On the very day of the stance I had on my shirt, hidden\nunder my neck-tie, and invisible to any one, a diamond stud\nbelonging to my son-in-law. I must say that I was quite un\naware having it on that day. Harry was rather a dignified and\nvery ambitious man.\n11. Like all Americans when at leisure, he used to take an\neasy position. He was very fond of sticks and had kept one\nof the funniest you can imagine in a trunk in Paris that belonged\nto him.\n12. He died from a neglected cold that settled in his lungs\nafter an illness of eighteen months.\n13. He was only 41 years old when he died, and he had\nindeed a great future before him ; being very intelligent, active\nand ambitious.\n14. He died first and his little girl, my grand-daughter, was\nthen very delicate and weak.\n15. I could not answer this question, as no one but his wife\nwas at his bedside, when he breathed his last.\n16. This place had been selected by the medium.\n17. I had in the left inside pocket of my coat wrapped in\npaper and in an envelope a lock of my daughter's hair and a few\nwords written on a note signed by the name of l' Marie \" (her\nChristian name). 1 handed the envelope containing the hair\nto the medium, who put it on her forehead, holding it for some\ntime.\n18. My daughter's hair was of a chestnut color.\n19. My daughter Marie caught the influenza from her sister\nand was taken away in the course of five days by the dreadful\nplague, February, '92, in the prime of her life, at the age of 29.\nIt was her death that caused me to become a spiritualist.\n20. The stud was Harry's and the hair Marie's, as said before.\n21. The person mentioned by the name of George is the Chris\ntian name of my other son-in law, Mr. Healy (the husband of\nthe painting lady) who lives at Chicago and is still there.\n22. I do not know how to account for this.\n23. Never did my daughter's hair go out of my possession.\n24. Harry may have had a seal, as he was very fond of wearing\nlittle trinkets ; but I do not remember having seen any, nor did\nI find any after his death.\n25. The fuiir, as said before, was my daughter's.\nAs will be seen from the above message and the explanatory notes,\no\n\f-200 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nit is obvious that an outside influence was at work to give to the\nmedium all these minute and private details on family matters only\nknown to us and some of which none of us three were thinking of\nat the moment of the sitting. Who then prompted her [to give]\nthe names of my children\u2014Hairy, George (who is in Chicago), Marie,\nand most wonderfully \"Long Henry\"\u2014and all the particulars con\nnected with their private life ? Psychometry, clairvoyance, mind-reading,\ntelepathy say the men of science ; but I would rather call it spirit\ninfluence, a tie of union between all the worlds of the universe.\nThis is a true and genuine account of the phenomena obtained\nthrough the mediumship of Mrs. R. Thompson.\nI hereby certify that neither I nor my wile, nor my grand-daughter\nhad ever seen or heard the name of Mrs. Thompson, nor did any\nof us ever suspect her existence. We were perfect strangers one\nto the other, till the day we first met her, on the 1st of March\u2014and\nsince nothing in our conversation could have given her the least\nhint to enable her to discover anything connected with my family.\nBefore closing this long letter, I must say that Long Henry was\nconversant with the modern tongues, and understood and spoke\nEnglish as well as any of us. Moreover, I state that the message\nwas given in a child-like way, and with the genuine accent and pro\nnunciation of a child.\nAny other information you may need on this subject I will be\nglad to give you.\nWith kindest regards, believe me, Dear Sir, yours truly,\nC. Moutonnikr, Prof.\n(7) The Peregrinations of Nelly.\nMrs. Thompson's trance exhibits a good many instances of a\nvery distinctive phenomenon, akin to what is called \" clair\nvoyance a distance,\" or \" travelling clairvoyance.\" But I shall\nnot employ the term \" clairvoyance in, distance\" because it begs\nboth the distance and the clairvoyance, and has acquired a\ntechnical meaning, and also because clairvoyance is frequently\nused in two or three different senses.\nI prefer then to class these phenomena under a non\ntechnical heading, and call them simply \" the peregrinations of\nNelly.\" It may be objected that this title assumes that Nelly\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 201\nperegrinates. I, however, do not mean to assume that, but\nmerely wish, for convenience' sake, to label certain recurrent\nphases of Mrs. Thompson's psychical manifestations by a term\ndescriptive of their superficial aspect.\nAlthough by using this term I do not commit myself to any\nparticular interpretation of the facts, I have no hesitation in\nasserting my belief that these peregrinations do really repre\nsent to the trance-personality a method of obtaining information\nquite distinct from the other processes which Nelly calls\n\" talking to spirits,\" \" seeing pictures,\" or \" getting things out\nof Mother's stomach.\"\nThese other processes are in operation during the trance: but\nthe peregrinations are represented as having taken place pre\nvious to the trance, the knowledge resulting from them being\nheld over for disclosure at a subsequent sitting.\nSome of these voyages of discovery have been already\nrecorded in Proceedings, Part XLIV, pp. 112-115, and are all\nconnected with Dr. van Eeden. One which should have been\nincluded in this series was omitted by mistake, and I will\nbegin with it.\nIt occurred at the sitting of December 20th, 1900, and was\npreceded by a description of a joint visit of Nelly and Elsie (a\nspirit friend of Nelly's) to Mrs. Piper, which is recorded below,\nand also by a true description of an incident relating to my\nlittle girl, which Nelly may have learnt about during a pere\ngrination to my house, but which I have not included in this\nseries, because she did not actually say that she had thus\nacquired the information. Mrs. Benson was the sitter, and\nthere was nothing to suggest Dr. van Eeden.\nNelly :\u2014\" I went to see Brother Boer : that's what Mother\ncalls him : ' Whiskers.' This was truthfully me, not Elsie, on\nTuesday the 18th instant. (Sic; and spoken as if repeating\na lesson.) There's somebody very ill in his house\u2014in his\ncolonisation\u2014very ill.\"\nJ. G.

It's no test to spell the name ; because everybody\nknows it. Sam's mother's very ill ; but that's not the person\nthat's drawn up.\"\nI sent a transcript of this to Dr. van Eeden. I can give\nonly the substance of his reply, as unfortunately I have lost or\nmislaid the original. Luckily the main point does not depend\non memory, and can be checked by reference to documentary\nevidence. Dr. van Eeden found a coincidence in the fact that\nsome days before December 20th, though not on December 18th,\na woman in his colony at Bussum had given birth to a child.\nWhen I discovered that the letter containing this statement\nwas missing I wrote to Dr. van Eeden asking him if he re\ncollected the incident, and also for details as to the number\nof men and women in his colony. His answer, dated Septem\nber 29th, 1903, runs as follows:\u2014\n... I remember her (Nelly's) statement very well, and the\ncoincidence with the birth of a child at Walden. There were\nalways between 30 and 40 persons at Walden, men, women, and\nchildren, and never less than three married women. I have never\nspoken about Walden and its population to Mrs. Thompson, as tar\nas I remember now, because I always avoided the subject. But\nNelly has shown knowledge concerning it on several occasions.\nI then asked for the date of the birth of the child, and\nwriting on October 6th, 1903, Dr. van Eeden stated that it\nwas December 9th, 1900.\nIf this case stood by itself, I should not have thought the\nproblematical coincidence worth narrating; but it is not an\nisolated instance of apparent perception by Nelly of what took\nplace at Walden, and therefore in spite of the error about the\ndate and the lack of definiteness in her description of the\nillness, it deserves consideration.\nThe chief difficulty is the discrepancy between the date\nnamed by Nelly and the date of the woman's illness. Nelly\nas a rule is vague in the matter of dates, which she arrives at\ngenerally by saying that something happened the same day as\nor a day or two before or after some incident in Mrs. Thompson's\nexperience. To the best of my recollection this is one of the\nonly two occasions on which she gave a day of the month (see\np. 252), and she brought it out as a child does who is using a\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 203\nterm which it knows sounds well, but of the meaning of which it\nis not quite sure. If we regard the coincidence as due to\nsupernormal knowledge, it is possible to explain the dis\ncrepancy by supposing that either as a result of a peregrina\ntion or telepathically Nelly on December 18th first learnt of\na past fact, namely, the illness.\nAgain, if there is anything here calling for an explanation\non supernormal lines, I would note that Nelly's description of\nthe woman's illness is such as might have been given by a\nchild, who, ignorant of the significance of the symptoms which\nshe had witnessed, failed to draw the inference which an\nadult would have drawn.\nBetween December 9th, the date of the confinement, and\nDecember 20th, the date of Nelly's account of her peregrina\ntion, Mrs. Thompson had given two sittings to Mrs. Verrall on\nDec. 14th and 1 7th ; but at neither was anything said about\na visit to Dr. van Eeden. Nelly's silence on December 14th\nand 17 th is in favour of the supposition that she acquired\nher knowledge of the illness after it occurred, and after the\nsitting of December 17 th.\nAt a sitting held on January 1st, 1901, immediately the\ntrance began, and before the sitter had entered the room, Nelly\nsaid to me :\u2014\n\" Who is that coughing, coughing, coughing in the night\u2014last\nnight\u2014a nasty sounding cough 1 I couldn't sleep in your house.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Was it last night ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" I think so, but it was the night I tried to sleep\nat your house.\"\n\/. 0. P. :\u2014\" Did you see anything or anybody ? \"\nNelly.\u2014 \"I don't know, but I am sure it was Mr. PMding-\nton's house. Where's Monro at your house? Have you got his\nbox there ? There's a MiinrS box at your house. All boxes\nhave a strap round. It was a leather portmanteau box with\na strap round, and some white trousers, like football or cricket\ntrousers, perhaps sleeping things in it. I can see them dis\ntinctly.\"\nThe facte were these. On the nights of the 29th-30th\nand 30th-31st December, 1900, I had been disturbed and\nkept awake for an hour or two by the coughing of one of my\n\f204 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nservants who was sleeping in the room above mine. On\nDecember 81st I spoke to my wife about it, and advised her\nto send the servant to see the doctor. The cough probably\ncontinued for a night or two after this, but I was not dis\nturbed on the night of December 31st-January 1st. Coughs are\ncommon of course in December and January, and though Nelly\ndid not say that I was disturbed by the coughing, it is worth\nnoting that I have to the best of my recollection been disturbed\nat night by another person's cough only once since the date of\nthis sitting ; in other words, on only three or four nights out\nof about 900 nights would a reference to some one coughing\nin my house at night have had a special significance for me.\nI may add that since Nelly mentioned this coughing I have\nborne in mind to note down any other occasions on which I\nhave been disturbed by coughing at night.\nI had not seen Mrs. Thompson for eleven days before the\nday on which the sitting was held at which Nelly mentioned\nthe coughing, and I certainly did not speak to Mrs. Thompson\nbefore the trance about the servant's cough ; so she did not\nlearn of the incident from me. Mrs. Thompson also had not\nbeen to my house for several months, and the sitting of\nJanuary 1st, 1901, was not held there, and so she could\nnot have noticed that one of my servants was suffering\nfrom a cold. It is not quite clear whether Nelly intended\nto convey that she had learnt of the existence of a \"Monro\nbox \" at my house at the same time that she heard\nthe coughing, but I think that this was what she meant. The\nbare fact of there being such a box in my box-room was\ntrue, though I had no conscious knowledge or recollection of\nit. The other details are probably wrong, except that there\nwas a strap round the portmanteau. In the box-room, which\nis an out-building, and into which Mrs. Thompson has never\nbeen, was at the time of the sitting a portmanteau belonging to\nMiss Munro, a sister of my wife's. Attached to it was a laljel\nbearing the name and address of the owner. I do not think\nthat at any rate at this time Mrs. Thompson knew my wife's\nmaiden name, and if she had heard it she would have heard\nit pronounced \" Munro,\" and not \" Monro \" as Nelly pronounced\nit. The box was a small portmanteau, a flimsily-built foreign-\nmade thing, of some cardboard kind of material, not leather,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 205\nand it did not contain trousers or anything of the sort, and it\nIjelonged not to a man but to a woman.\nImmediately after this Nelly went on to describe another\nperegrination, in this case involving possession of a medium in\ntrance.\nIn the account which follows I have substituted fictitious\nnames for the real ones, but all the people concerned were\nfriends of Mr. Myers', are all known to me and all are mem\nbers of the S.P.R. The lady whom Nelly purported to have\ncontrolled is not a professional medium.\nMr. Myers had written to me as follows :\u2014\nValescure, Dec. 23\/00.\n\" Miss Rawson is here. ... A sitting yesterday, Dec : 22.\nAt 2.40 French time {i.e. 2.30 English) a soi-disant Mrs.\nThompson possessed Miss R. I don't want to ask Mrs. T.\nabout it\u2014perhaps when you sit next (Jan. 1) you can find\nout whether anything occurred that day to Mrs. T. She\ncame only for a minute and feebly. I will not tell you the\nother sitters for evidence sake.\"\nBefore the sitting of January 1st, 1901 began I asked Mrs.\nThompson how she had spent the afternoon of December 22nd,\n1900. I did not of course say why I asked the question,\nnor did I let her know that I was putting the question on\nMr. Myers' behalf.\nIn reply to my question Mrs. Thompson said :\u2014\" I was in\nthe house the whole of Saturday afternoon, December 22nd,\ntalking to a lady. I slept for an hour, probably between 2.45\nand 3.45, in an arm-chair in front of the fire in the dining-\nroom. I remember nothing, and did not dream, so far as I am\naware. I don't think I was asleep as early as 2.30.\" (This\nin reply to my suggestion that she might perhaps have had a\ndream, and that possibly she had fallen asleep as early as\n2.30.)\nWhen the trance was over, I explained to Mrs. Thompson\nwhy I had asked the question, and although she then knew\nthat to bring about a very pretty coincidence she ought to\nhave been asleep by 2.30, she wrote me the same evening to\nthe effect that on further consideration she felt sure that she\nhad not gone to sleep before 3 o'clock.\n\f206 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nDuring the trance, and immediately after the statement about\nthe coughing and the \"Monro box,\" (see p. 203), Nelly said:\u2014\n\"Where's Millie? Mr. Myers' Millie? Millie llawson?\nShe knows all about me, because she says I went to her house\nthe other day.\"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"What day?\"\nNelly:\u2014\"Don't remember.\"\n\/. 6. P. :\u2014\"Where is she?\"\nNelly :\u2014\" I don't know. She has got a very ill mother.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014 \"Do you remember going to her house?\"\nNelly:\u2014\"Yes.\"\nJ. G. P.\u2014\"What do you remember?\"\nNelly:\u2014\"It was like this. She said 'Come along, Nelly,\nand tell me all about it.' She invited me to go to see her.\nShe has got a very ill mother. She isn't dead; don't think\nshe's dead\u2014don't think that. She only thinked it: that's as\ngood as an invitation. Tell her I'll go and see her for Mr.\nMyers' sake, not for her's. I went, but it was a muggled\nwent. I wish you believed me.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Why ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" Because I once said I wouldn't go to any one\nbut Mother: but I did this time to oblige Mr. Myers. You\nknow the old lady was lying down at the time. . . . Yet\nMrs. Evie seemed to be there. Don't think I mean Mrs.\nMyers. I mean the one (then follows a personal description).\nIt was the day they forgot to send the turkey.\"\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Who is 'they'?\"\nNelly :\u2014\" Mother knows about it. Don't put down about\nthe turkey : Mother won't like it. I'll think of something else\nto remember the day by.\"\n\/. G. P. :\u2014\"No, the turkey will do very well.\"\nNelly :\u2014\" Now, I'm happy ; I've told . you all the secrets\nthat were on my mind.\"\nThen towards the end of the sitting Nelly recurred to the\nsubject again as follows:\u2014\"I did go to Millie Rawson. Yes,\nI did. She seems to be abroad. Mrs. Rawson isn't in that\nsame bed that she used to be. Miss Rawson likes to talk to\nMr. Myers, and rap the table at him. Not at him, with him.\nShe always says I have light hair. Elsie has light hair, and\nI have got dark and curly hair. That's the truth.\"\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 207\nThe following is a copy of an extract from the notes taken\nat the sitting of December 22nd, 1900, with Miss Rawson:\u2014\n\" Mrs. Thompson came with great difficulty at 2.40 p.m.\n(Paris time). ' I have come as you asked me.' \"\nNelly fixed the date of her visit to Miss Rawson by saying\nthat it was \" the day they forgot to send the turkey.\" I have\nin my possession a statement signed by a lady and gentleman\nwho were staying with Mrs. Thompson at the time, and also\na statement signed by Mrs. Thompson's cook to the effect that\nthe \" day they forgot to send the turkey \" was Saturday,\nDecember 22nd.\nThere was therefore a coincidence in the dates. There is also\na suggestive resemblance between Nelly's words : \" I went, but\nit was a muggled went \" ; \" tell her I'll go and see her for\nMr. Myers' sake \" ; \"I once said 1 wouldn't go to any one but\nMother, but I did this time to oblige Mr. Myers \" ; and the\nindependent descriptions of what occurred during Miss Rawson's\ntrance, namely : \" She came only for a minute and feebly,\" and\n\" Mrs. Thompson came with great difficulty,\" and the words\nspoken by the soi-disant Mrs. Thompson, \" I have come as you\nasked me.\"\nOn the other hand Nelly says she controlled Miss Rawson,\nwhereas Miss Rawson is supposed to have been controlled by\nMrs. Thompson. Nelly says the lady whom she called \" Mrs.\nEvie \" was present, which was true, but though I ditl not\nactually know it to have been the case, I might have surmised\nit from something in Mr. Myers' letter to me. She seems to\nimply that Mr. Myers was present, which I knew, but she says\nMrs. Rawson was present, when in reality Mrs. Rawson was\ndead, and I had known she was dead, though at the time of\nthe sitting I did not feel sufficiently sure on the point to\ncontradict Nelly when she told me not to think that Mrs.\nRawson was dead ; Nelly's words seem to imply\u2014what proved\nto be the case\u2014that Mrs. Myers was not present, a point on\nwhich I had no information. Two other sitters who were\npresent at Miss Rawson's sitting, and of whose participation in\nthe sitting I was unaware, Nelly did not mention.\nThe death of Mr. Myers, which took place less than four\nweeks after the sitting, prevented me from learning from the\nmost authoritative source whether he had given Mrs. Thompson\n\f208 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nany reason to suppose that somewhere about December 22nd\nhe would have a sitting with Miss Rawson, and whether he\nhad expressed to Mrs. Thompson a wish to try for correspon\ndences between her and Miss Rawson's trance utterances.\nIn October, 1903, Mrs. Thompson was kind enough to let\nme examine all the letters written to her by Mr. Myers\nduring the year 1900, and up to date of his death, and in\nnone of these letters is there any reference to Miss Rawson,\nor to his having met her, or to his having had sittings with\nher, or to bis having any prospect of having sittings with her.\nNaturally I did not give Mrs. Thompson the remotest hint of\nmy reasons for wishing to examine the letters written to her\nby Mr. Myers during a certain period. Her ready acquies\ncence is only one more proof of her good nature and intelli\ngent appreciation of the need for strict methods of inquiry.\nAfter I bad read through the correspondence, and explained\nmatters to her, she assured me that she had no recollection\nof Mr. Myers having ever told her either that he had had\nsittings, or was hoping to have sittings about December 1900,\nor at any time with Miss Iiawson. I learn further, from a\ngood source, that Miss Kawson was not expecting to meet\nMr. Myers in the South of France. (See also p. 302.)\nBut these peregrinations do not always have such inter\nesting results. Of two that I am now going to relate one\nwas abortive and the other inconclusive.\nAt a sitting held on December 20th, 1900, Nelly said:\u2014\n\"Tell Dr. Hodgson I know all about that Mis. Piper thing\nthat he sent to my mother. I went to Mrs. Piper's house\nwith the impression of that. And somebody in Mrs. Piper's\nhouse they said\u2014'Well, talk through Mrs. Piper.' I didn't\nreally talk through her, but Elsie to please me pretended to\nbe me. I didn't talk to her because I'd promised Mother\nnever to talk through any one but her. Elsie said:\u2014'Here's\nMrs. Thompson's Nelly come.' You see, Mrs. Benson, Elsie\nand I are regular little cheats. We're not really cheats, only\nwe cheated that time. It wasn't really me. Elsie went and\nsaid that, and Mrs. Piper thought it was me. We're very much\nalike.\"\nWhat Nelly calls \" that Piper thing \" was not really a\n\" Piper thing \" at all, but an object, about which Dr. Hodgson\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 209\nknew nothing, sent over by him to Mr. Myers for the purpose\nof an experiment with Mrs. Thompson. Nelly, in spite of her\nclaim, has failed to give any correct information about this\nobject.\nDr. Hodgson says that there is no trace in the records of\nMrs. Piper's sittings of any such incident as Nelly describes.\nPerhaps Elsie told Nelly a tarradiddle ; an impious suggestion\nto make about a spirit, but if spirits can cheat, there is no\nsaying what crimes they mayn't commit.\nThe next instance is non-evidential, but I quote it because\nit foims one of the series under discussion, and, in order to\nform a proper estimate of the value of these particular pheno\nmena, all must be taken into account, and also in order to\nillustrate the \" automatic romance,\" as Miss Brainstem calls it,\nof the trance.\nNelly opened the sitting of January 11th, 1901, in this\nway:\u2014\n\"Mr. Piddington, will you buy me a white rabbit? No, not\na white rabbit, because it would get dirty : a not-white rabbit\nto put on that mantelpiece. You can get one at the sweet\nshop at the corner of Sloane Street.\"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"What were you doing in Sloane Street, Nelly?\"\nNelly:\u2014\"I went there to go to your house and try to find\nsomething out about your house. But I didn't get there. I\nstopped and looked at the rabbits in the shop.\"\nThere were rabbits in the window of a sweet shop at the\ncorner of Sloane Street at this time and have been ever since,\nat least up to July 1903, and the chances are that there were\nfor a long time before the date of this sitting, as this shop\nseems to make a speciality of toy rabbits. We are therefore\nat liberty to assume that at some time or other Mrs. Thomp\nson had noticed the rabbits. But the point to which 1 want\nto draw attention is the extremely happy touch with which\nthis little episode is treated. All the other voyages of dis\ncovery lead, or were represented as leading, to some definite\nresult. This one is frustrated. The attractions of a sweet\nshop proved too much for Nelly, and science was deprived perhaps\nof some addition to the store of evidence for the existence of\nBupernonnal faculty in consequence. The whole thing is so\nartistically done, the episode lightly introduced and as lightly\n\f210 [part\nJ. G. Piddingtcm.\ndropped. It fits in properly as one of a series of similar\nexcursions, and at the same time delightfully exemplifies the\nvividness and artlessness of the child-control.\nThis by-play, which abounds in the trance utterances of Mrs.\nThompson, produces on me at the time a most vivid impression\nof the reality of the Nelly control : an effect which, however\nmuch weakened by subsequent reflection, is never entirely dissi\npated. I dare say as narrated in black and white the things read\ncommonplace enough ; but they are not in the least common\nplace as they issue from the lips of the medium, when the\nspontaneity with which they are uttered is surprising.\n(8) Ignorance displayed by the Trance-Personality of\nmatters which were or might have been within\nthe cognizance of the medium.\nIn every single instance it stands to reason that the\nignorance displayed by the trance-personality may have been\nmere pretence, assumed to create effect ; but believing, as I\ndo, that the phenomena of Mrs. Thompson's trance are genuine,\nI regard them as evidence of discontinuity of memory between\nNelly and Mrs. Thompson, and as such worthy of record\nand study.\nAt the same time it seems to me possible that in some\ncases the ignorance is assumed by the trance-personality either\nfrom a kind of intellectual tic, or from playfulness, or from\na lazy liking for sticking to an appellation when once used,\nor from an instinct for referring to people by nicknames.\nSitting of October 28th, 1899.\nAt this sitting I handed to Mrs. Thompson a cigar-cutter,\nthe cover or holder of which was made of gun -metal. Mr.\nFeilding who was taking notes refers to it in them as a\npencil ; but he was sitting at some distance from the medium\nand so did not get a close view of it. The medium, however,\nhad it in her hands for some time, and Nelly throughout\nspoke of it also as a pencil. For any one who was handling\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 211\nit, and at the same time able to see it at close quarters,,\nit would have been difficult to mistake it for a pencil.\nAt the same sitting Nelly referred to Mr. Podmore in a\ngeneral way. Mr. Feilding then asked Nelly if she could say\nwhat Mr. Podmore was doing yesterday. Nelly answered :\u2014\n\" I see him in a big sort of bank, selling money.\" Mrs.\nThompson and Mr. Podmore live not far apart, and had\nNelly named his real occupation, her statement would have\nhad no evidential value. Whether at this time Mrs. Thompson\nknew Mr. Podmore's profession or not I cannot say ; but I\nshould think that she probably did ; and if she did not, it is\nhard to understand why, if she is a fraud, she should have\nrisked making a shot at it when with very little trouble\nshe could have got certain information.\nSitting of November 29th, 1899.\nTowards the end of this sitting Nelly said to Dr. van\nEeden :\u2014\" I promise faithfully to give you plenty of details\non Friday.\" (Before the trance Mrs. Thompson had arranged\nto give a second sitting on the following Friday. Note the\nmatter-of-fact way in which Nelly as usual assumes acquaintance\nwith Mrs. Thompson's affairs.) Then turning to me she\nadded :\u2014\" Don't let your mother or lady at your house be\npresent at the sitting. It would make Mother nervous.\"\nI think the probabilities are that at this period Mrs.\nThompson knew that \" the lady at my house \" was not my\nmother, but my wife : but whether that was so or not,\nNelly, long after my wife had made Mrs. Thompson's ac\nquaintance, continued to refer to her either as \" the lady in\nyour surroundings \" or as \" the lady at your house,\" or as\n\" your little girl's mother,\" or as \" the lady with neuralgia in\nyour surroundings,\" or vaguely as \" she,\" or in fact by any\ncircumlocution rather than as \" your wife.\" Only once, to\nthe best of my belief, has she ever made use of a direct\nand natural designation in speaking of my wife.\nMrs. Veriall has described (see Proceedings, Part XLIV,\np. 194) a similar though more complicated example of this\ncurious avoidance by Nelly of the obvious way of styling\npeople ; but in my case there is no reason to suppose that\nNelly failed to put two and two together, and to recognise\n\f212 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\n\" the lady at my house,\" etc. as my wife. In Mrs. Verrall's\ncase it seems possible that when she spoke of \" the Willgar\ngentleman \" or of \" Arthur,\" she failed to grasp that the\nperson to whom these appellations referred was Mrs. Verrall's\nhusband.\nIn Mrs. Benson's sittings Nelly spoke of Archbishop Benson\nto Mrs. Benson first as \" your husband,\" later as \" Mr. Bishop,\"\nor as \" the old gentleman,\" or \" the old gentleman with the\nspectacles.\" Not only up to a certain point where Mrs.\nCartwright referred to him clearly as \" the Archbishop \" but\nafterwards Nelly seemed to be unaware of the title used by\nMrs. Cartwright, and continued to use the same terms as\nbefore or others, such as \" that old gentleman, Mr. Benson,\"\nor \" Mr. Truro.\" Finally, to her great chagrin, Nelly dis\ncovered that \" Mrs. Benson is in the peerage,\" and that \" Mrs.\nCartwright knows \" who \" the clergyman who wears the night\nshirt over his clothes\" is, and in a state of great agitation\nannounces that she is not happy any more {i.e. because when\nfacts given in the trance are to be found also in works of\nreference, their evidential value is lost or diminished), and\nthat \" it's no good any more.\" \" Bishop\u2014Bishop\u2014the Bishop\nwho preached at St. Paul's Cathedral, Bishop Canterbury. I\nnever knew before ; Mrs. Cartwright says it's in the book.\"\n(i.e. in the peerage).\nEven then she did not use the word \"Archbishop,\" but\n\" Bishop Canterbury \" ; and though Mrs. Benson had two more\nsittings after Nelly announced her discovery of the Arch\nbishop's identity, she never referred to him by his proper\ntitle, but always by one of the circumlocutions with which\nshe had grown familiar, or added new ones such as :\u2014\" that\ngentleman,\" \" the Bishop gentleman,\" or \" the sleeve gentle\nman.\"\nI agree with Mrs. Verrall in thinking that the deliberate\nmaintenance of these devices could serve no obvious purpose,\nand their only result would be, one would think, to confuse\nthe medium, who, if she is fraudulent, must have quite\nenough to do to keep all the threads of her puppets from\ngetting entangled, without introducing further and unnecessary\ncomplications into an already sufficiently complicated game.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 213\nSitting of February 6th, 1900.\nI handed to the medium at this sitting a double sheet of\nilluminated script done in the manner of the 14th and 15th\ncentury. The text was in English and perfectly easy to read ;\nyet Nelly said of it:\u2014\"It's all in foreign languages; nobody could\nread it.\" At a later sitting I handed a coin to the medium,\nsaying as I did so :\u2014\" This belonged to my mother.\" \" Ah !\nYes,\" replied Nelly, \" this is the lady connected with the Ger\nman prayers.\" \" Why will you say German ? \" I protested,\n\" It's English.\" So then Nelly conceded the point, excusing her\nmistake on the plea that \" It's written in Old English letters ;\nthat looks like German.\"\nSitting of April 19th, 1900.\nThere had been an interval of six weeks between this and\nthe last sitting, and Nelly seemed to have forgotten who I\nwas. Speaking about a locket which had been handed to her\nby Dr. Max Dessoir she casually asked :\u2014\" What is that round\nthe neck, Mr. Myers ? \" \" I'm not Mr. Myers,\" I objected, to\nbe met with the retort:\u2014\"\/ like Mr. Myers ever so much\nbetter than you, but Mother doesn't. How do you explain\nthat ? \"\nBut in spite of my reminder she almost immediately showed\nagain that she failed to remember me ; so I tried to recall\nmyself to her memory, and this time with success, for Nelly\ngreeted me with the remark :\u2014\" Oh ! yes ; you're the one with\nDorothy \" ; a mark of recognition not perhaps flattering, but\nquite conclusive : for at my first sitting Nelly had said that\nshe got \" an influence connected with the lady at your house\ncalled Dorothy.\" In spite of my denial of there being any\nperson so named connected with my wife, Nelly stuck to her\nstatement, and the next day I discovered that the name of a\nhospital nurse who had come to attend my wife the day\nbefore the sitting was Dorothy. That the name was not a\nmere random shot was shown by subsequent and more precise\nstatements made by Nelly about Dorothy. (See pp. 214-220.)\nIf Mrs. Thompson's trances are fraudulent, I do not see\nwhat was to be gained by pretending that she did not recognise\nme ; nor can I think that it was a momentary slip of memory\n\f214 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nllue to her greater familiarity with Mr. Myers as a sitter or\nrecorder, for the mistake was made twice, and I should\nimagine that it was of primary importance to a fraudulent\nmedium to fix well in her mind the identity of her sitters ;\nwhereas the same circumspection need not be so essential to a\nsecondary personality or a spirit.\nNelly always referred to the screen used to hide the sitters\nduring a certain number of sittings as \" the umbrella \" ; but\nthis I fancy was meant as a term of reproach, and was only\none of \" Fanny's little ways.\"\nA much more curious point is that for a short time after\nhis death Nelly denied with obstinacy that Mr. Myers was\ndead ; though the fact was of course known to Mrs. Thompson,\nand although the Sidgwick control was represented as perfectly\ncognisant of it.\n(9) An Incident illustkative of the Gradual Emergence\nok Facts in the Tkance-Uttekances.\nMy first sitting with Mrs. Thompson was, as I have said,\non October 28th, 1899, when I went to her house under\nan assumed name with Mr. Feilding.\nI was addressed by Nelly in the course of the sitting by\nmy real name ; but I was not and am not satisfied that Mrs.\nThompson might not have been able (for reasons into which I\nneed not enter) to make a very good guess as to who I was\nwithout the aid of her \" enlarged consciousness.\" I also think\nthat a good deal of what was told me at this sitting was\nnothing more than amplifications of, or inferences from, the\n\"Noel Walker\" crystal-message. (See above, pp. 112-119.)\nBut this sitting contained one item of information which was\nafterwards in later sittings more fully developed : and this I\nfind it impossible to consider as deduced from the crystal-\nmessage, and its possession by Mrs. Thompson can best be\naccounted for by supposing that it reached her through some\nsupernormal channel.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 215\nWhile the medium was holding in her hands a match-box\nof mine, and also a cap and tie that had belonged to a\ndeceased friend of Mr. Feilding's, Nelly said :\u2014\" I get an\ninfluence, connected with the lady at your house, called\nDorothy. Dorothy also comes with the tie.\" Towards the\nend of the sitting the medium took bold of the cap and tie\nagain, and Nelly said :\u2014\n\"There is a Dorothy or a William in connection with\nthem. I can't attach the cap to either Mr. Feilding or to\nyou. It seems as if given by somebody else.\"\nI told Nelly at the same time that the name Dorothy had\nno meaning either for me or for the lady at my house ; and\nas the name Dorothy was also said to be connected with the\ncap and tie which had nothing whatever to do with me, I\ntook it to be merely a name shot out at random like others\nat the same sitting.\nAs a matter of fact, however, the evening before this\nsitting took place a hospital-nurse named Sister Dorothy had\ncome to attend upon my wife. My supraliminal memory was\ncertainly not in possession of the nurse's name, though perhaps\nmy subliminal memory was, as on reflection I felt almost sure\nthat the doctor, who had engaged the nurse for me, had some\ndays previously spoken of her to me as \" Sister Dorothy.\"\nIt was not till the morning after the sitting when I was\ngoing through the notes that it occurred to me to enquire\nwhat the nurse's name was. I think I should not\u00ab have\ntroubled to bother about the name had not Nelly, when I\ntold her at the sitting that she was mistaken about Dorothy,\ninsisted that she was right. This struck me as curious, and\nas not the kind of tactics that a fishing trance-personality\nwould have pursued in face of my denial. Having then dis\ncovered that there was a Dorothy connected with my wife,\nI waited in the hope of getting some further reference to her.\nThe next sitting which I attended was on November 29th,\n1899. No mention was made of Dorothy; but this was\nnatural enough, because the communications were addressed\nchiefly to a new sitter, Dr. van Eeden, and were not concerned\nwith me in any way.\nTwo days later Dr. van Eeden had a second sitting. It\nwas held at my house for the first time, and this seems to\np\n\f21(J [part\n\/. G. Piddington.\nhave reminded Nelly of Dorothy ; for just before the trance\nended she said to me :\u2014\n\" Have you got a Dorothy in this house ? Some one is\ncalling Do-ro-thy. A live lady is calling Dorothy. She\nwasn't a foreigner\u2014an ordinary lady\u2014a very musical voice\ncalling Dorothy. Dorothy would be a good medium for\nphysical phenomena. Peter could do knocks through her.\"\nAt this date the nurse was no longer at my house. I can\ntrace no meaning in the musical voice calling \" Do-ro-thy \" ;\nmy wife always called her \" Nurse \" tout court.\nThe next sitting at which I was present was on December\n18th, 1899. Towards the close of it I asked Nelly for more\nnews about Dorothy.\nNelly was annoyed and testily replied :\u2014\n\" Oh, don't bother me about Dorothy. She's a very unim\nportant person ; only a kind of servant.\"\n\" Well,\" I said, \" if she is so unimportant, why did you\nget a message about her ? \"\n\" Because,\" answered Nelly, without the least hesitation,\n\" because she has a little dead brother, whoo wanted to send\na message. We call him Bob\u2014Bobby. He's got something\nwrong with him in the neck and ear, and it made his head\na little bit sideways.\"\nI wrote to Sister Dorothy to enquire if there were any\ntruth in this statement. Her reply was to this effect : that\nshe had no dead brother named Bobby, but she remembers\na little boy in her hospital of that name, rather a pet of\nhers, who had a diseased bone in his neck. The neck was\nkept between sandbags, and this in time made his ears sore.\nThe identification is not of course entirely satisfactory,\nbecause Nelly described Bobby as Sister Dorothy's dead\nbrother. But Nelly has at various times explained that she\nhas to guess at relationships. She seems to be roughly\ncognisant of the relations existing between two individuals,\nand from such general impressions to infer the relationship.\nBut, granting for a moment Nelly's account to be the true\none, it would be easy to account for the error in question.\nLet us suppose that a little spirit-child, Bobby, was cog\nnisant of Sister Dorothy's presence in my house. He tells\nNelly during the seance on November 29: \"A lady con\n\fxlvil] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 217\nuected with that gentleman has got Sister Dorothy at her\nhouse.\" Nelly repeats this information in a parrot-like way :\nmisunderstands the use of the term \" Sister,\" and imagines\nthat because Bobby talks of \" Sister Dorothy \" Bobby must\nbe Dorothy's brother.\nThe next sitting was held on January 5th, 1900, and\nduring the seance proper no reference was made to Dorothy.\nAfter the trance was over, and while Mrs. Thompson\nwas having tea with my wife and myself, she unexpectedly\nrelapsed into trance, and Nelly began to chatter away about\nmatters quite unconnected with those dealt with at the\nregular sitting. I took the opportunity to ask for something\nfurther about Dorothy. Nelly said :\u2014\" She has left that\nsituation and gone to another one. It is a place where\nthere are four children.\" [See below.]\nNelly was most disdainful about my interest in Dorothy\non this occasion, too : she evidently thought that one ought\nto be inquisitive only about one's deceased great-grandmother :\nan attitude all the more curious because she usually has the\ninstincts of the true psychical researcher well developed, and\ndisplays a keen grasp of what is good evidence and what\nis not.\nAt the next sitting, which was on January 10th, 1900,\nshe had evidently made up her mind to nip any tiresome\nenquiries in the bud, for, without my making any reference\nto the distasteful subject, she said :\u2014\" Don't ask me about\nDorothy.\" But, undismayed by her aversion, I ventured to\npoint out to her the importance of obtaining more informa\ntion about Bobby and Dorothy, and urged her to try to\nfind Bobby in order to learn more about him. This she\npromised to do, though with a bad grace, and I fear she\ndid not pursue her mission con amorc.\nNothing was said about Dorothy at the next sitting on\nJanuary 12th, 1900, nor at the two subsequent meetings.\nOn January 23rd, 1900, I was not present at the seance\nuntil just at the end, when I again brought forward the\nsubject with the words :\u2014\" Will you give me more things\nabout Dorothy ? \" \" Dorothy,\" said Nelly, \" looks rather like\na hospital nurse. She has a bonnet with white lace on it.\nShe is now at a house where some one is speaking French.\"\n\f218 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nI wrote to Sister Dorothy, and she replied :\u2014\" I think\nmost of the people I've been with can \" [i.e. speak French].\n\" I do not possess any bonnet with lace on it.\"\nShe wears, however, a hospital-nurse's cap with long white\nstrings. I imagine that the uniform of no hospital-nurse\nincludes a bonnet trimmed with lace, white or of any\nother colour, and it is curious that this unlikely detail of\ndress should have been assigned to Sister Dorothy just after\nher profession had been rightly named : curious, because not\nonly has Mrs. Thompson a most observant eye for dress,\nbut Nelly also shares her interest in frocks and frills.\nNothing further is directly stated of Dorothy, but after a\nlapse of nearly two months she is referred to indirectly again.\nAs I have already described (see ' p. 213) Nelly failed\nto recognise me at the sitting held on April 19th, 1900 :\nand so I had to try to recall myself to her memory. In\nthis I was successful, for, when I had finished my explana\ntions as to who I was, Nelly said in an off-hand way :\u2014\n\" Oh ! yes : you're the one with Dorothy.\" I had flattered\nmyself that I had other claims on Nelly's recollection than\nthis, but apparently I had not, for the time at least. Nelly\ncan be uncompromisingly frank.\nLater on in the same sitting, which was for the special\nbenefit of Dr. Max Dessoir, Nelly began to speak about my\nmother, and to give me messages from her. Among other\nthings my mother was represented as sending her love to\n\" a particular young man belonging to you named Paul.\" I\nwas bidden to tell Paul that he would be better. I there\nupon said to Nelly :\u2014\" Ask my mother who Paul is \" ; for\nthe name Paul had no meaning for me. Nelly replied :\u2014\n\" Your own special friend. He has got a sister named Mari\u00ab,\nand that Dorothy seems to belong to that Paul.\"\nI think that during the progress of the sitting I had no\nglimmering who Paul might be, but on reading over my\nnotes, I saw at once that all the references to \" Paul \" would\nbecome at once intelligible if applied to my wife ; in spite\nof the fact that \" Paul \" is spoken of throughout in the\nmasculine gender, 1 have not the least doubt that my wife,\nwhose name is Pauline (her name must have been known to\nMrs. Thompson), was intended. Some ten days later Mr.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 219\nMyers sent me a message from Nelly to say that \" Paul is\na lady, a friend of Mr. Piddington's, and she belongs to the\nlady that had the prayers that looked like German writing \" :\ni.e. to my mother.\nDorothy, therefore, is linked in the mind of the trance-\npersonality with my wife and myself six months after the\nfirst casual reference to her ; although as far as we were con\ncerned she would have passed out of our minds when her\nshort visit was ended.\nIt would be difficult to find a better illustration of the\noozing out of details in trance-utterance. Mrs. Benson's\nsittings provided some good examples of this gradual leakage,\nbut in that case the details which emerged were known to\nthe sitter, whereas in this case some of them were not.\nI must supposed to have known the name of the nurse,\nand 1 knew that Dorothy was \" only a kind of servant \" ;\nand I had known all along, even when I didn't consciously\nknow her name, that a hospital-nurse was at my house. Yet\nthis last point\u2014the one thing that I had known from the\nbeginning\u2014was the very last item of information to emerge.\nIf Nelly's knowledge was acquired telepathically from me,\nit is to be noted that it took close on two months before\nshe succeeded in tapping my brains of this the most\nmaterial fact in the series of statements. But the telepathic\nhypothesis has to be strained considerably before it will\ncover all the difficulties in this case. For one thing, unless\none supposes that throughout the medium was tapping the\nbrain of Sister Dorothy, whom she had never seen, never\ndid see, and within whose vicinity she, to the best of my\nbelief, never came\u2014unless, I say, one resorts to such a\nstrained hypothesis as that\u2014one is obliged to assume that\nthe medium drew her facts first from one source, and then\nfrom another. I knew nothing about Bobby, and nothing of\nthe nurse's movements after she left my house ; these facts\nmust therefore be supposed to have been derived from tbe\nnurse. Yet Nelly, who is ready enough at all times to\nvolunteer the statement that she is \" getting things out of\npeople's stomachs\"\u2014which is her definition of the telepathic\ntheory\u2014would not offer that explanation here. The source\nof her information she maintained was a spirit-boy, who had\n\f220 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\napparently dropped in as it were at a sitting, attracted thereto\nby the presence of some one at whose house his \" Sister\nDorothy \" was staying.\nA remarkable point, too, is Nelly's apparent holding over\nof knowledge within her possession. Thus at my first sitting\nthe name Dorothy only is given. Yet, when three weeks\nlater I asked her to explain what had led to her mention of\nDorothy, her answer gives the impression that all along she\nhad known about Bobby, and that Dorothy was \" only a kind of\nservant,\" but had suppressed these details because she thought\nthey were of no interest.\nVery curious also is the casual way in which knowledge\nof Sister Dorothy's movements is indicated. On January 5th,\n1900, Nelly says: \"She has left that situation and gone\nto another one. It is a place where there are four children.\"\nThe use of the term, \" that situation,\" seems to imply that\nshe knew that she had already not only left my house but\nalso been to another house since, and left that as well. This\nwas really the case, though I did not know it. In the house\nwhere Sister Dorothy was on January 5th, there were six,\nnot four, children. It was not till a week later that she\nwent to a house where there were four children. It is\nconceivable that on January 5th Sister Dorothy knew, or\nsome one knew, that she was to go to a family where there\nwere four children ; but this point I have not been able\nto clear up, as, just when I was about to make enquiries, the\nnurse went out to South Africa in March, 1900, and I have\nsince lost sight of her.\nAgain, on January 23rd, 1900, Nelly said:\u2014\"She is now\nat a house where someone is speaking French.\" If this is\ntaken to mean, as I think it fairly may be, that she had then\nmade still another move since January !\",th, the fact was\ntrue, though the statement about some one speaking French\nhas not been verified.\nAltogether the incident is a most complicated and per\nplexing one : hard to account for in my view by telepathy\nalone. The way in which the details dribbled out suggests\nthe haphazard interchange of information between intelligences\nlike ourselves rather than the successful ferreting out of facts\nby means of the purposeful exercise of a telepathic faculty.\n\fXLVii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 221\n(10) Nelly's Associations of Ideas.\nAn interesting feature of Mrs. Thompson's trance-phenomena\nis the way in which proper names come out. Punning associa\ntions of ideas seem to help Nelly on to the right track more than\nanything else. Mrs. Verrall has given one instance of what 1\nmean in her paper published in Proceedings, Part XLIV., p. 208.\nI quote the passage:\u2014\n\" Merrifield was said to be the name of a lady in my family.\nThe name was given at first thus : ' Merrifield, Merriman, Merry\nthought, Merrifield.' . . . Later Nelly said :\u2014' Mrs. Merry\nthought, that's not quite right; it's like the name of a garden':\nand after in vain trying to give me the name exactly, she said :\u2014\n' I will tell you how names come to us. It's like a picture ; I\nsee school children enjoying themselves. You can't say Merry-\nmans, because that's not a name, nor Merrypeople.' Nelly, later\non, spoke of my mother as ' Mrs. Happyfield,' or ' Mrs. Merri\nfield,' with indifference.\"\nThe real name was Merrifield, and it should be noted that the\ncorrect form of the name was given by Nelly at the very first\nattempt, but that in spite of this she appears not to have been\naware of her success. She knew apparently that she had got\nBomewhere near the mark, but not that she had hit the bull's-\neye. A picture was presented to her which she recognised as\ncontaining a correct clue to the general type of name, but she\nwas not confident that she had translated the symbolic picture\nwith precise accuracy.\nThe sittings with which I am dealing in this paper afford\nseveral instances of a similar kind to the above, and in every\ninstance this mental trick is exhibited exclusively by Nelly,\nand not at all by the other controls.\nAt a sitting held on February 1st, 1900, Nelly was trying to\nget the name of the deceased lady called in the record of ' Mr.\nWilson's \" sittings Miss Clegg. The real name was a rare one,\nand Nelly never actually succeeded in getting it, though she\neventually got pretty near it. After making two attempts at\n\f222 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nthe name, she remarked :\u2014\" Funny the way I get names. I get\nan association with flowers or trees or places, or all kinds of\nthings.\"\nG. P. :\u2014\" How do you know when it's right 1 \"\nNelly :\u2014\" There's a feeling of satisfaction when the right asso\nciation is found, which tells me it's right.\"\nAs an explanation this is not very illuminating, but it is\ninteresting as exemplifying Nelly's ignorance of the processes\nby which she acquires information. I am sure that this\nignorance is not assumed, as conceivably it might be in order\nto avoid interrogatories about the mechanism of the trance-com\nmunications which it might tax the ingenuity of the trance-\npersonality to meet, and that whatever may be the pretensions\nof the other controls to understand the laws underlying the\nphenomena, Nelly at least does her work more or less blindly\nand automatically. More than this, I believe she regards the\nwhole thing as a game or puzzle which it is good fuii to solve.\nNelly is no glum archangel ; she never displays any consciousness\nof being engaged on a serious mission, nor indulges in prayer, pious\nejaculations, or sanctimonious discourse ; and is, in fact, a down\nright, unsentimental, debonair being. She is prepared to play\nthe game under what she considers the proper rules ; but if these\nare overstepped, as in the \"screen sittings\" (see p. 16.'!), she pro\ntests and is inclined to sulk. But to return to the subject of\nher associations of ideas.\nAt Dr. van Eeden's first sitting no attempt was made to give\nhis name. At the second sitting Nelly's first words were, \"What\nwas 'Vam'?\" Then later on she made several unsuccessful\nattempts to pronounce the name, thus : \" Was Vanden ! can't say\nit. Vandenen ? Begins like van in the street ; then enden.\nBegins with E\u2014Endenen\u2014not like Hendon, but Endenen.\"\nFinally at the end of the sitting she gave the name clearly,\nthough with the English pronunciation :\u2014\" Do you know van\nEeden ? \"\nAt the next sitting she seems pleased to have coined a little\npun, by means of which she can be sure of fixing the strange\nname in her memory :\u2014\" I know your name is Air. Bosom\u2014\nBostim. . . . You are Mr. Gardener Eden (or Garden of\nEden).\"\nIt is possible that there was more in this pun than meets the\n\fxlvji.] Phenomena in Mrs. Tfiompson's Trance. 223\neye, and that it was not simply an aid to memory, but was also\nintended to convey a new fact. Bosom and Bostim were evident\nattempts at Bus'sum, where Dr. van Eeden farms land ; and Nelly\nmay have meant that as Adam delved in the Garden of Eden, so\ndid Dr. van Eeden at Bussum ; or rather, perhaps, she had no\ndefinite intention of suggesting this, but the facts came to her\nin this allegorical fashion.\nDr. van Eeden's second sitting furnishes another very similar\ninstance. Mrs. Thompson was holding some hair that belonged\nto a Dutch lady. Meanwhile Nelly, who had already given\nseveral relevant facts in connection with it, said :\u2014\" Do you\nknow Linden ? I associate the hair with ' Unter den Linden '\u2014\nnot with, the place, but with the name Linden.\" Van Lynden is\nthe surname of intimate friends of the husband of the lady to\nwhom the hair belonged, though this was unknown to Dr. van\nEeden at the time. But what I want to bring out now is not\nthe relevancy of the name, but the practical illustration here\nfurnished of Nelly's account of how she gets names by association\nwith trees or places.\nA critic whose acquaintance with Mrs. Thompson's trance\nphenomena was acquired solely through a perusal of the\nrecords might perhaps think that this disconnected way of\nshooting out names was more ingenious than ingenuous in that\nit gave the medium more than one chance of hitting the\nmark ; for instance, in the case of the name Linden, had it\nnot happened that the husband of the owner of the hair\nhad friends of that name, pertinency might still have been\nclaimed for it on the ground that the owner of the hair, or\none of her family, had recently been staying in Berlin, or\nhad some connection with one of the half-dozen places called\nLinden, or had an ancestor who had fought at the battle of\nHohenlinden.\nFrom the main contention that proper names, shot out at\nrandom, have a better chance of applicability than when\nconnoted of some definite person or thing, no one would dis\nsent; but if the records of the sittings should create the\nimpression that either Mrs. Thompson fraudulently or the\ntrance-personality deliberately throws out proper names discon\nnectedly for the purpose of \" fishing,\" then the written records,\nas muBt often be the case, are misleading.\n\f224 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nMrs. Benson, who had a series of sittings with Mrs.\nThompson, had her first sitting on December 18th, 1899.\nThe surname Benson was mentioned for the first time on\nJanuary 5th, 1900, in an entirely wrong connection, and\nwhen the sitter was a lady unknown to and unassociated with\nMrs. Benson. On January 12th, 1900, when Dr. Tuckey\nwas the sitter, Nelly began to speak about Mrs. Benson, and\nwent on to say :\u2014\" There's a place in Birmingham where\nMother often goes : it's Bensons Limited.\"\nAgain, at the close of one of Mr. \" Wilson's \" sittings on\nJanuary 18th, 1900, when 1 asked if she had anything new\nto tell about \" Martin,\" who had been mentioned at Mrs.\nBenson's first sitting, Nelly replied :\u2014\" The old lady like\nBensons Limited. It's where Mother goes to have dinner\u2014\nin Birmingham\u2014in Cow Street\u2014no, Bull Street. It's like\nSlater's.\" She did not, however, on either occasion explain\nthat by means of that association of ideas she had either\ngot hold of the name or retained it in her memory ; nor\ndid she on the occasion of Mrs. Benson's second sitting on\nJanuary 2.\"!rd, 1900, when she apostrophised her in the\nfollowing terms :\u2014\" My darling Mrs. Benson, I don't call\nyou Limited.\" Here the mnemonic process is not drawn\nattention to, but can be readily traced. But again, as in\nthe case of \" Mr. Gardener Eden,\" the association of ideas\nmay have recommended itself as specially appropriate because\nit put Nelly on the track of something besides the mere\nname of the sitter. There was a very definite connection\nbetween Mrs. Benson and Birmingham, for her husband, the\nlate Archbishop, was a native of that town.\nBut there is another point of interest in connection with\n\" Bensons Limited.\" Mrs. Benson's identity was supposed to\nbe unknown to Mrs. Thompson both before and after the\nsecond sitting. On some date, however, between the second\nsitting and February 6th, 1900, Mrs. Crackanthorpe hap\npened to mention to me quite casually, in the course of\nconversation, that Mrs. Thompson had told her that Mrs.\nBenson was having some sittings. So when I next saw\nMrs. Thompson on February 6th, 1900, I asked her before\ntrance if she remembered the name of the lady with white\nhair who had sat with her twice recently. Mrs. Thompson\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 225\ncould not think of the name at once, but finally said \" Mrs.\nBenson.\" I then asked how she had thought of the name,\nand she replied that she had recalled it by thinking of\nBensons Limited, a Birmingham restaurant. I deal elsewhere\n(see pp. 271-3) with the question involved in Mrs. Thompson's\nknowledge of the name of one of the sitters supposed to be\nunknown to her, and now draw attention only to the\nemployment of exactly the same association of ideas by Mrs.\nThompson awake and Mrs. Thompson entranced. Bull Street,\nit will be noticed, was first called Cow Street ; yet Slater's\napparently presented no difficulty.\nOn February 1st, 1900, nine days after Mrs. Benson's\nsecond sitting, I had a sitting with Mrs. Thompson by\nmyself. Before the sitting began Mrs. Thompson showed me\nan entry made in her diary under the date of January 31st,\n1900, which ran as follows:\u2014\"Nelly says the lady with\nwhite hair [i.e. Mrs. Benson] has an old gentleman, the one\nwith spectacles ; and Grandpapa Middleton went to school\nwith him.\" Then directly trance began Nelly said :\u2014\" You\nmean Mr. Bishop : the gentleman with the spectacles. That's\nwhy I told her to bring his spectacles. I traced that old\ngentleman back to school, and I found him talking to\nGrandpapa. He lived at (pause). You know Mrs. R 's\nson. Mrs. R is Mother's next-door neighbour. Mrs.\nB 's son has gone as physical science master to Marl\nborough. I hear Mrs. R telling Mother that. Then\nlike that is the name of the place where Mr. Bishop lived.\nA Church School, a very high ecclesiastical school. Then I\ntraced him to school. Grandfather Middleton was a smaller\nboy than Mr. Bishop. . . . Have you got King Edward YI.'s\nschool ? \"\nThe special point which I want to bring out here is the\nreference to Marlborough. Nelly's \" Mr. Bishop \" is undoubtedly\nmeant for Archbishop Benson. Dr. Benson was not connected\nwith Marlborough, but he was Headmaster of Wellington :\nand the association between the names of the two greatest\nEnglish soldiers is obvious, or at least it ought to be, though I\nmust admit I failed to seize it until it was pointed out to me.\nNelly did not say that the Archbishop lived at Marlborough,\nbut \" like that is the name of the place where \" he lived.\n\f226 [part\n.\/. G. Piddington.\nThe whole sequence of ideas in this passage is worth study.\nNelly's discovery that her Grandfather had been at the same\nschool as Mrs. Benson's husband starts her on the topic of\nschool generally. She finds that the Archbishop's connection\nwith school did not terminate with his school-days ; and that\nhe lived at another school. She can't quite get hold of the\nname of this other school, but recognises that a school of\nwhich she has heard, through her mother's next-door neighbour,\ncontains a clue to the name.\nIt is passages of this kind which I think as much as\nanything else have convinced me of Mrs. Thompson's absolute\nbona fides. Until some ev idence is forthcoming to show that\nan admittedly fraudulent medium can successfully reproduce a\nsubtle mimicry of recognised subconscious processes, such as\nI believe we here see exemplified in Mrs. Thompson's trance, 1\nshall prefer to consider that such reproduction is impracticable.\nOne of the tasks winch our Society has before it is to try to\nfind another Davey who will mimic the trance-phenomena of\nMrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson. I am inclined to think that\na large amount of success might be obtained by a clever\nimpostor, in so far as the giving of correct facts about the\nsitter or the sitter's belongings was concerned, but what I\ngreatly question is whether, while the impostor's attention was\ndevoted to picking up hints from such indications as his sitter\nmight afford, and dramatising these in appropriate fashion, he\nwould not be too much preoccupied to introduce and maintain\na consistent and convincing travesty of these characteristic\ntraits of subconscious action.\nAt another of Mrs. Benson's sittings, on May 30th, 1900,\nanother type of association of ideas was displayed.\nEarly in the sitting General Buller was mentioned : though\nthe fact that he was known to Mrs. Benson was not actually\nstated. Later on the name of Mrs. Benson's dead son, Martin,\nwhich had already been frequently mentioned, was written :\nthen Nelly said :\u2014\" 1 seem to get Sir George White\u2014White.''\nShe then wrote \" White \" after the \" Martin \" : or rather it\nshould be said that \" White \" was written, for Nelly asserts\nthat she is never responsible for any of the automatic writing\n(see pp. 231-2, 243). The significance of this was that the\nsecond name of Martin Benson was White.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 227\nThen a little later Nelly added :\u2014\" You know Mr. \"White\u2014\nmilitary man\u2014far more anxious to convert you.\" The only\napparent point in the allusion to \" Mr. \"White\u2014military man,\"\nlies in the fact that the only member of the Benson family\nwho was ever connected with the army was Captain White\nBenson, after whom the late Archbishop and his son, Martin\nBenson, were named. It is true that this fact is stated in\nthe Archbishop's Life, which had been published some months\nljefore this sitting took place, but I am not quoting the state\nments made by Nelly as indicative of supernormal knowledge,\nbut as illustrations of the sequence of ideas characteristic of\nthe Nelly control.\nAn instance almost exactly analogous to \" Merrifield Merry-\nmans Happyfield \" occurred in another series of sittings\nattended by Mr. and Mrs. Percival. Their son was mentioned\nat their first sitting, and reference made to his school-\nlife, and to the fact of the school being situated at Oxford,\nbut the actual name of the school was not mentioned. At\ntheir third sitting Nelly said :\u2014\" I know where Springfield\nis. I don't know what I'm saying. Yes, that's what I mean.\"\nAnd then later :\u2014\" Springfield, Oxford. Or is it Highfield ?\nIt's either Highfield or Springfield College, Oxford. It's the\ntruth.\" The real name of the school was Summer Fields ; and\none can easily understand how a, so to speak, charade-picture,\nsymbolising Summer Fields, might be wrongly interpreted as\nSpringfield ; though, unless the picture presented to Nelly\nwere of a meadow on rising ground, it is not so easy to see\nwhy the name Highfield should have been guessed.\nAt a sitting at which I alone was present on February\n6th, 1900, I handed to the medium several objects belonging\nto former sitters, and afterwards gave her some hair of my\nmother's, though without, so far as I am aware, allowing\nany indication to escape me that the object had any particular\ninterest for me personally ; all Mrs. Thompson could have\nnormally known about the lock of hair was that it had been\nhanded to her at a former sitting, and on that occasion too\nit had been presented among other objects belonging to other\npeople ; and I may add that I had given Mrs. Thompson to\nunderstand that I should not \" sit \" for communications my\nself. After the hair I gave some illuminated script that had\n\f228 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nbeen painted by my mother, and while the medium was\nhandling this, Nelly said :\u2014\" You know Leo Myers. There's a\nLeo belonging to this lady.\" The only Leo that could be\ndescribed as belonging to my mother is my own daughter,\nwho is called Leo. Mrs. Thompson may have known that\nthis was her name, though I doubt it, and it must be borne\nin mind that, to the best of my belief, I gave her no hint\nthat I was personally interested in the illuminated script, while\nthe character of other facts given by Nelly in connection with\nobjects that had belonged to my mother must also be considered.\n(See pp. 122-5, 149-154.) Not one single thing of those which\nMrs. Thompson could have got up about me, my family, and\nbelongings did Nelly say ; and what she did say I have not the\nleast hesitation in asserting she could not at such short\nnotice as the circumstances allowed,\u2014or indeed, I firmly\nbelieve, under any ordinarily conceivable circumstances,\u2014have\nlearnt by normal methods of enquiry. But putting aside the\nquestion of whether the mention of the name Leo is of evi\ndential worth, the way in which the name is led up to, by\nfirst of all mentioning another Leo known to Mrs. Thompson,\nand, if one may put it in that way, known through her to\nNelly, is quite in keeping with what has been described\nabove.\nThe same sitting, that of February 6th, furnished another\ninstance of a like kind. Nelly said that a \" Rev. John \" had\nbeen a great friend of my mother's, and had done her some\nservice for which she retained a grateful remembrance. I\ndid not, when this was said, recognise any meaning in it, and\nI have not since been able to verify this statement ; but\nhoping to get preciser details, I asked ;\u2014\" What was the Kev.\nJohn's name ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" It was Harper.\"\nG. P. :\u2014\" How did you get the name ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" It was like the picture of a man playing a harp,\nand as you can't say Harpist I say Harper.\"\nJust before the reference to the Rev. John, Nelly had\nbeen speaking about a man whom she subsequently identified\nas my mother's brother, my uncle. She began by saying :\u2014\n\" About a relation of her's (i.e. of my mother's) that has been\nill in a foreign country.\"\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 229\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" When ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" Some weeks before the snow came. A long way\noff'\u2014a gentleman not well\u2014not very ill\u2014not an ordinary\ncountry. You know ' Maid of Athens ' : that sort of country,\nnot European, not on the Europe map ; where they ride\nhorses without saddles on. I don't mean just where the\ngentleman is, but near about : not South Africa. ... It was\na colony, not a foreign country. . . . Has he got sheep all\nround him ? It's summer time, not winter. His name was\nQueensland.\"\nMy uncle does live in a colony, though the name of the\ncolony is not Queensland. (\"His name is Queensland \" clearly\nmeant that Queensland is the name of the place where he\nlives.) He lives in the Island of Mauritius, where, to the best\nof my information, it is not the custom to ride horses without\nsaddles on, nor do sheep form a distinctive or common\nfeature of the landscape. The order in which the various\ndetads about my uncle's alleged place of residence emerges is,\nin view of what has been said above about Nelly's associa\ntions of ideas, extremely suggestive ; and I believe it is pos\nsible to trace the origin of the erroneous details. Three\nintelligences are supposed to be engaged in the communi\ncations : Nelly, Mrs. Cartwright, and my mother. When\nI say \" are supposed \" I do not mean that it is directly\nasserted, for the participation of Mrs. Cartwright and of my\nmother is rather to be inferred from internal evidence and\nby analogy with the \" business \" of the trance phenomena\ngenerally ; but the impression created is that my mother is\ncontributing facts which Mrs. Cartwright conveys and, when\nnecessary, translates to Nelly.\nNow, with regard to the statements about the country\nwhere my uncle lives, the first fact given is that he is \" in\na foreign country \" ; the foreign country is next said to be\n\" a long way off,\" and \" not an ordinary foreign country.\"\nThen follow the words :\u2014\" ' Maid of Athens,' that sort of\ncountry, not European, not on the Europe map \" : which I\ntake to mean that, although Athens is in Europe, the country\nis not European, but Oriental in character, like Greece.\nAt this point, according to my surmise, the trance-person\nalities felt that it was desirable to arrive at a more precise\n\f230 [part\n0. Piddington.\ndefinition of the foreign country, and 1 conjecture that Mrs.\nCartwright by means of a charade-picture tried to convey to\nNelly the notion of a colony. If for this purpose she, so to\nspeak, threw upon the screen a conventional picture of the\nEnglish colonist in a flannel shirt, and wealing a slouch hat,\nand bestriding a bare-backed horse, the source of Nelly's next\nphrase\u2014\" where they ride horses without saddles on \"\u2014can be\naccounted for.\nAfter these words come one or two sentences applicable to\nmy uncle, but without bearing on the country where he lives.\nThen Nelly recurs to the subject again and says :\u2014\" It was a\ncolony\u2014not a foreign country \" ; again goes oft' to another\ntopic, and finally says :\u2014\" Has he got sheep all round him ?\nIt's summer time not winter. His name was Queensland.\"\nI venture to suggest that what was true and what was false\nin these statements was derived from one and the same source,\nand that the error arose from misinterpretation of a symbolic\npicture, and not because the sources of information on which\nNelly was drawing were unauthentic.\n1 conceive that Mrs. Cartwright realised when Nelly had\nsaid \" where they ride horses without saddles on \" that she\nhad failed to grasp the intention of the picture which had\nbeen employed to represent a colonist, and had put too\nspecial a construction on it. So another attempt was made\nto convey to Nelly the notion of a colony : this time by some\npictorial representation of a land of the Queens beyond the\nseas. The attempt proved successful, and Nelly was enabled\nto give the correct information \" It was a colony, not a\nforeign country.\" Then afterwards Nelly, not feeling perfectly\nsatisfied with this, the correct interpretation, and combining\nwhat I imagine were the two separate pictures by which\nMrs. Cartwright sought to impart the idea of the word\n\" colony,\" hazarded another guess, and thus hit on the notion\nof Queensland and the sheep. The sheep may have been\ndragged in by a natural association of ideas when once the\nname Queensland was hit upon, or perhaps they were in\nthe original picture of which the typical colonial squatter\nformed the prominent feature.\nMy language here has been particularly \" anthropomorphic,''\nbut it must be understood that I describe what took place,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 231\nor what I imagine took place, in the trance in these objective\nterms merely as a matter of convenience and without pre\njudice. My attempt to trace some of the processes underlying\nthe operations of the trance consciousness will no doubt appear\nto many rather fantastical. At any rate I have not tried\nto read preconceived theories into the facts ; it is the facts\nthemselves which have suggested to me the theories.\n(11) The Automatic Writing.\nAt the first sitting which I had with Mrs. Thompson I saw\none word written during the trance ; it was not till more than\ntwo years later that I witnessed any automatic writing again.\nThen there was a good deal of it. One curious point about the\nscript is that Nelly will not accept any responsibility for it. She\nhas said so again and again, usually at the end of a sitting during\ninformal chats; but twice she has put in a disclaimer in the\nregular course of a sitting.\nThus on January 3rd, 1901, the following occurred. Nelly\nsaid :\u2014\" You don't think Mr. Myers is so ill ; he's much worse.\"\n\" Yes,\" I replied, \" but you wrote to the contrary.\" \" I don't\ncare what I've written,\" retorted Nelly ; \" don't put it down to\nme.\" I had as a matter of fact used a somewhat too strong\nexpression, for nothing had been written which actually contra\ndicted Nelly's statement ; still that is not the point, but rather\nNelly's readiness to hold cheap, or at least to accept no responsi\nbility for, what the medium's hand writes.\nThis comes out more clearly in the next quotation, which is\nfrom the sitting of January 8th, 1901. \"It's not me that\nwrites. It's always somebody else that's writing. Not me,\neven if I tell you so.\" Nothing can be more definite than this ;\nand the concluding words seem to suggest that Nelly herself is\nnot always clear about the source of the automatic script.\nThe one word written at my first sitting with Mrs. Thompson\nwas my own name, spelt backwards. During the whole of this\nsitting there was no suggestion that any one but Nelly was com\nmunicating. The name was written immediately after Nelly\nQ\n\f232 [PAKT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nhad addressed me for the first time by my name. I had gone\nunder an assumed name, and when my real name was uttered\nneither Mr. Feilding, who was present, nor myself gave any\nindication that the name spoken was right. If Nelly was not,\nas she pretends, responsible for the writing, what part of Mrs.\nThompson's consciousness, one may ask, was ? And why, unless\nthe phenomenon is genuine, should such a gratuitous complica\ntion be introduced as the pretence that the Nelly control has\nnothing to do with the automatic script ?\nA proper name was on one other occasion given backwards,\nthough not written but spelt out. Nelly spelt it out, and when\nI asked her how she got the letters, she said that they had been\ngiven her by another spirit, who has occasionally controlled Mrs.\nThompson.\nThe control whom I have previously referred to as Mr. D.\nwrote with great fluency, just as he spoke with great fluency.\nBut there was nothing characteristic about his script ; it was in\nMrs. Thompson's ordinary handwriting. The Percival control\nalso wrote ; and though his script was generally almost indis\ntinguishable from Mrs. Thompson's ordinary hand, it here and\nthere showed traces of slight modifications\u2014modifications which\nsuggest an approximation to a half-formed school-boy type of\nhand. Yet there was no such similarity to the boy's own hand\nwriting as to strike his parents, neither of whom can be said to\nerr on the side of over-scepticism.\nE. H. Fercival, in common with another occasional control,\nsigns his messages in a different hand from that in which the\nbody of the message is written. But in neither case does there\nappear to be any definite and unmistakable resemblance to the\nsignatures of either, as either wrote it when living.\nAfter the sitting of January 3rd, 1901, was over, and\nwhen Mrs. Thompson had been awake for some time and had\nbeen engaged in conversation with the sitter, Mrs. Percival, she\nwent suddenly to the writing table, seized a pencil, and wrote\nvery hurriedly a message which purported to come from the\nPercival control. The message in itself was not in the least\nevidential, but the writing differed from the previous Percival\nscript in that the school-boy hand predominated over Mrs.\nThompson's, and not vice vend, as in the script produced during\ntrance. But it cannot be said that Mrs. Thompson's automatic\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 233\nscript presents any specially interesting features as a general\nrule. It is not the chief method of communication as in Mrs.\nPiper's case. Still to this rule there is one exception, and that\n;i most important one.\nI have referred parenthetically in the course of this paper to\nthe existence of a control which purports to represent the late\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick, whom Mrs. Thompson had met several\ntimes. This control communicated directly by the voice, but\nalso by means of writing. The matter in neither case is of much\nevidential value ; the manner both of speech and of writing is.\nhowever, of great interest.\nI shall refer to the content of the communications only in so\nfar as such reference may be necessary to elucidate points which\nwill arise in connection with the script. It will doubtless be to\nmany a disappointment that better evidential matter is not to be\nfound in the communications of this control, from whom much\nmight have been expected. But, on the assumption that the\nsource of these communications is really what it is represented\nto be in the trance-messages, I am by no means sure that we\nought to expect evidence of a specially effective character. A\nlittle reflection will show that a new problem has arisen in\npsychical research. A communicating spirit who has in life\nbeen a prominent member of our Society must find it a more\ndifficult task to prove his identity through mediumistic utterance\nor writing than a layman, using \" layman \" in the sense of an\nindividual who has not taken a conspicuous part in psychical or\nSpiritualistic work.\nMediums, and for that matter all who take any interest\nin our subjects, if they do not actually possess, must be\nassumed to possess, knowledge of the careers of deceased\nleaders of the psychical and spiritualistic movements. Since\nMr. Myers' death, for instance, a stream of communications,\nwhich purport to emanate from him, has been pouring in\nfrom various sources. With two exceptions, I know of\nno series of messages which could not have been based\nupon common knowledge or upon information contained in\nobituary notices, or which could not be regarded as deduced\nfrom such knowledge, or which did not repeat facts given\nin his own writings or in the publications of the Society, or\nfacts which could easily have been derived through con\n\f234 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nversation with some member of his large circle of friends\nor acquaintances.\nOr again, if our President and Mrs. Verrall will forgive\nthe liberty which I am taking, I can illustrate the new\nproblem that we have to face in another way. Both Sir\nOliver Lodge and Mrs. Verrall have contributed to the\nSociety long papers on the phenomena of Mrs. Piper and\nof Mrs. Thompson, which contain a large number of\ndetails about their own personal affairs, about their family\nlife, and about their relations, and not only their immediate\nrelations, but also their remote or collateral kinsfolk. When\ntheir time comes\u2014and long may it be deferred\u2014to com\nmunicate from the other side, it is obvious that every message\npurporting to come from either of them which merely repeats\nfacts already published in their own writings, or which can\nbe shown to be based on these facts, will have to be discarded\nas evidentially worthless. And I say it in all seriousness\u2014\nthough the dictum sounds rather comic\u2014extra patience will\nhave to be accorded to the Psychical Researcher who is\nattempting to prove his identity. One can well imagine the\nannoyance and almost despair which might fall on such a\ncommunicator should he, after having succeeded in getting\nthrough a clear statement of fact, be met with the rejoinder\nfrom this side that his effort is of no avail, because what he\nhas said has appeared, let us say, in the Proceedins\/s.\nEven during his lifetime a psychical researcher is not\nentirely exempt from the disadvantages resulting from the\npublication of his private affairs. Thus, for instance, Nelly\nhas more than once referred to members of Mrs. Verrall's\nfamily, who have been mentioned in the Journal or Proceedings:\nnot, however, making any pretence to have learnt of their\nexistence in any supernormal way, but rather taking it for\ngranted that I, of course, knew that these people were mentioned\nin our publications. In this way she spoke on several occa\nsions of Mrs. Verrall's sister by her Christian name, tout\ncourt, and I hadn't the least notion whom she meant, and\nthought that the name was just thrown in hap-hazard. Many\nmonths passed before I discovered who was meant, and,\nwhen I mentioned my discovery to Nelly, her first anxiety\nwas to warn me against attaching any importance to her\n\fXLvIL] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 235\nknowledge of the name : \" Every one knows who Flora is,\" she\nremarked.\nRecent phenomena obtained by Mrs. Verrall and others seem\nto suggest that the difficulties in the way of giving good proofs\nof identity are beginning to be recognised ' on the other side,'\nand that an attempt is being made to furnish evidence of\nintelligent discarnate action by the communication of concordant\nmessages through different living persons.\nBut to return to the subject of the Sidgwick script. It will\nnow be clear why I propose to devote myself exclusively to\na description of the automatic writing, without taking into\naccount the content of the script or of the spoken communi\ncations.\nProfessor Sidgwick died in the summer of 1900. I was\nto begin ti new series of sittings with Mrs. Thompson towards\nthe end of December, 1900. After consultation with Mr.\nMyers I decided to invite Professor Sidgwick's sister, Mrs.\nBenson, to a sitting with a view to attracting communications\nfrom her brother. She accordingly attended the first sitting\nof the new series on December 20th, 1900. This was also\nthe second sitting at which a screen was interposed between\nthe medium and the sitter, and the strangeness of the condi\ntions was perhaps responsible for the poor results. Mrs.\nBenson brought with her to the sitting a paper-knife that\nhad belonged to her brother, and two letters of his inside a\ncovering gummed envelope. Only the vaguest references were\nmade to the owner of these objects, and his identity was\nnot discovered.\nThree more sittings were held after this one, and yet not\na word was said about Professor Sidgwick. At last, on\nJanuary 11th, 1901 (see also pp. 297-8), the first reference\nwas made quite unexpectedly at a sitting attended by Mr.\nand Mrs. Percival. Before the sitters entered the seance\nroom, I asked Nelly to try to bring Edmund Gurney, as I\nwanted to have a talk with this control, which has occasionally\nmanifested through Mrs. Thompson. Nelly said that I had\nbetter wait until the sitters were gone. A good deal of script\nwas done at this sitting purporting to come from the Percival\ncontrol. Across this script and intermingled with it were\nwritten in a different handwriting, though in a handwriting\n\f236 [paut\nJ. G. Piddington.\nshowing no trace of resemblance to that of Professor Sidgwick,\nthe words \" Trin y Henry Sidg.\" The first five letters\nseem like an attempt at \" Trinity,\" and suggest that a reference\nwas intended to Trinity College, Cambridge. On another page\nof the sheet of foolscap paper on which the automatic writing\nwas being done, and underneath some of the Percival script,\nand quite by itself and disconnected, was the word \" paper-\ncutter.\" This was written I should say in Mrs. Thompson's\nnatural hand, though it is a very scribbly sample of it. No\npaper-cutter had been presented to the medium at this sitting,\nand it is therefore fair to conclude that the appearance on\nthe same sheet of paper of an obvious attempt at the name\n\" Henry Sidgwick \" and of the word \" paper-cutter \" was not\naccidental.\nIn the course of the sitting I gave the medium a sealed\nenvelope prepared by Mrs. Percival ; whereupon Nelly said :\u2014\n\" I don't want any Henry Sidgwicks, because he said he\nwants to tell about it.\" And then in reply to a question\nfrom me :\u2014\" What made me say Henry Sidgwick is because\nhe's nearer to me than Mr. Gurney.\"\n(Curiously enough, the very next moment the Percival\ncontrol reappeared, and in his third sentence said :\u2014\" It was\nMr. Gurney who took charge of me \" ; meaning, I have no\ndoubt, that Mr. Gurney had helped him to come to ' com\nmunicate. Cf. pp. 300-1.)\nWhen the sitters had left I asked Nelly if Mr. Gurney\nwas present. Nelly made the cryptic answer :\u2014\" About the\ntrio.\" \" Who are the trio ? \" I asked. \" Henry Sidgwick,\nEdmund Gurney, and Mr. Myers,\" replied Nelly. \" Henry\nSidgwick is here.\" The Sidgwick control then made its first\nappearance, and, though the words spoken were few, the voice,\nmanner and style of utterance were extraordinarily lifelike :\nso much so indeed that, had I been ignorant of Professor\nSidgwick's death and had happened to hear the voice without\nbeing able to tell whence it was issuing, I think I should\nhave unhesitatingly ascribed it to him.\nThe next sitting was on January 21st, 1901, and directly\ntrance came on and before the sitters entered the room,\nNelly began :\u2014\" Where's Henry Sidgwick ? He's coming to\ntalk after the sitting.\" As soon as the sitters left the\n\f\f\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompsons Trance. 237\nSidgwick control made an ineffectual effort to speak. Nelly\nthen came to the rescue and gave the following message :\u2014\n\" Mr. Piddington, he can't talk. He wants to write himself,\nwhen you're not thinking of him. . . . She will write it at\n4.30.\" \"Who,\" I asked, \"will write it? The medium?\"\n\" Yes,\" said Nelly. The Sidgwick control then took Nelly's\nplace; and again the impersonation was most extraordinarily\nlifelike. The only two occasions on which I have been\nimotionni, or have experienced the slightest feeling of uncan-\nniness during a spiritualistic seance, or have felt myself in\ndanger of being carried away, was during these two mani\nfestations of the Sidgwick control. I felt that I was indeed\nspeaking with, and hearing the voice of, the man I had\nknown ; and the vividness of the original impression has not\nfaded with time.\nAfter Nelly had explained that her mother was to be\nprepared to receive an automatically-written message the same\nafternoon at 4.30, the Sidgwick control spoke as follows:\u2014\n\" He's not with me.\" (The \" He \" undoubtedly meant Mr.\nMyers. This sentence and the next were spoken with great\nemotion.)\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Is he resting ? \"\nH. S. :\u2014\" He's not within range at all. . . . Alice will\nknow that it's me [sic] that's written it. She'll recognise it.\n\u25a0She'll know it's my writing.

You always\nthought me old and shabby, but I'm shabbier now.\"\nThe final sentence was apparently got out with immense\neffort, and then the personation stopped with a snap. It was\njust like the swift and unexpected withdrawal of a magic-\nlantern slide.\nWhile these words were being spoken the script marked\n(A) was being written, the pencil being held by the medium,\niis I noted at the time, between her first and second fingers.\n1 read this script thus:\u2014\n\" I don't think Myers is here, or (?) we (?) should see\nhim before the 8th. As E. G. told me [Mr. D.] was waiting (?)\nfor him.\"\n\f238 J. 0. Piddington. [part\nThe last four words are plainly in Mrs. Thompson's natural\nhandwriting. As to the rest of the writing Miss Alice Johnson,\nwho (as Mrs. Thompson knew) had been Mrs. Sidgwick's private\nsecretary for many years, and therefore had every opportunity\nof becoming thoroughly familiar with Professor Sidgwick's\nhandwriting, and whose cautious and critical temperament is\nknown to members of the Society, reports as follows :\u2014\n\" ' I don't think Myers is here ' is very like, especially\n'Myers is.' Then it tails off.\"\nIt will be seen that the hand and the voice are in part\nexpressing the same thought, though in slightly different\nlanguage. The voice says, \" He's not with me,\" while the\nhand is writing, \" I don't think Myers is here.\" Another\ninstance of this automatism within an automatism occurred in\nthe next sitting.\nIn order to make the allusions in the spoken and written\ncommunications intelligible, it should be explained (1) that\nthe sitting of January 21st, 1901, took place a few days\nafter Mr. Myers' death, and (2) that \"Alice\" is no doubt\nintended to refer to Miss Alice Johnson. The interpretation\nof the remainder of the message is open to discussion. The\nwords \" You always thought me old and shabby, but I'm shabbier\nnow,\" may conceivably be an attempt to give the contents of\na sealed envelope.\nWith the evidential side of the question, however, I am\nnot here concerned ; what I want to draw attention to is\nfirst, that this short specimen of the script was written under\nmy eyes in an ordinary manner (except that the pencil was\nheld in an unusual and one would have thought uncomfortable\nfashion), not deliberately nor with studied effort ; and secondly,\nthat the trance-personality is confident of having produced a\nsuccessful imitation of the handwriting of Professor Sidgwick.\nThe morning after I received the script marked (B) from\nMrs. Thompson, accompanied by the following note :\u2014\n\" I am ashamed to say that I was not at home till 5 p.m.,\nbut I promptly sat down and lost consciousness after a few\nminutes and wrote enclosed. It is rather a strange writing.\nI have never seen Prof. Sidgwick's, but I think it would be\nvery interesting (though perhaps not evidential) to compare it.\"\nWhen the trance was over in the morning of January 21st,\n\f\f\f\f(Script C.)\n5 i~\n1* ^\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 239\n1901, I communicated to Mrs. Thompson the intention of the\nSidgwick control to write through her hand when she was\nalone at home.\nThe script (marked B) reads as follows:\u2014\n\" Late\u2014late-\u2014late hour. Tell me why. Late\u2014late hour.\nLate\u2014late\u2014late hour.\nMyers is elsewhere, I think.

The first ' Thursday,' ' had better agree,'\n' probably,' ' H. S.,' ' certainly ' and ' Trevelyan,' seem to me\nalmost exactly as he would have written them. Almost the\nwhole from ' Myers is elsewhere ' to ' Trevelyan's transferred '\nis wonderfully like.\"\nThe next sitting was on January 29th, 1901. I had gone\nout of the room for a few minutes in order to tell the\nsitters to go away, as Mrs. Thompson thought she would not\ngo into trance a second time. On my return 1 found her\nentranced, and on the point of completing the following\nsentences (v. script marked C) :\u2014\n\" I am sure I can give if they find my diary. Fred\nknows and helps. H. S. Yes, but why did you H. Sidgwick\ntell Myers he isn't here. I read his letter to the Council.\"\nI have given the words as they appear in the script, but judg\ning from the variations in the pencilling the signature \" H.\nSidgwick \" really came after \" my diary.\" \" Why did you tell\n\f240 [pakt\nJ. G. Piddington.\nMyers he isn't here ?\" obviously means \"Why did you say Myers\nisn't here ? \", Nelly having several times declared her conviction\nthat Mr. Myers was not really dead.\nOn the completion of the automatic writing Nelly said :\u2014\n\" Mr. Sidgwick has been writing. He was talking to me and\nwriting at the same time, and said, ' Why did you keep on say\ning Myers isn't here ? ' and he couldn't help writing it. [For\na somewhat similar phenomenon, v. Proceedings, XXXIII.,\npp. 420-1.] Then he said, ' I read the letter to the Council,\nand everybody thought \" Good \" (or \" Great \") Heavens ! Myers\nwriting and Sidgwick reading . . .' (Here I failed to catch the\nremainder of the sentence, and suggested a paraphrase, which,\nhowever, Nelly did not accept.) No. He sort of said, ' Humph !\nbut I read the letter straight off to the Council.' He said it was\na letter from the abroad country, and my mother was abroad too,\nso she couldn't know about it. How many struggled to read it\nfirst ? Then he read it quite well. He wants to tell you it's\noutside the possibility of Mother knowing. . . .\"\nThe incident here referred to really took place as described,\nbut I have to repeat that this is not the occasion to discuss the\nevidential value of the communications. The point to notice\nis, first, this the second instance of an automatism within an\nautomatism, \" But why did you tell Myers he isn't here ? \"\nand, secondly, Nelly's amplification, and correct amplification,\nof the episode only outlined in the script, namely, the reading\nof the letter at the Council (cf. p. 246).\nOn January 30th, 1901, the day after this sitting, Mrs.\nThompson was at home engaged in writing a letter to a friend.\nBut I had better quote her own account contained in a letter\naddressed to me the same day :\u2014\n\" I sat down to write a letter to a friend. The table was\nstrewn with papers, etc., and I suppose I went into trance. Any\nway I was alone, and as the writing is muddled up with the\nletter, I thought it would be best to send you my letter just as\nI found it when I awoke.\"\nThe letter which Mrs. Thompson enclosed broke off in the\nmiddle of the second page in the middle of a sentence. Then\ncame a scrawl in ink, and below the scrawl the word \"Pencil \"\nwritten in ink. The script proper written in pencil then begins,\nand runs as follows (see script D.):\u2014\n\fy\nr\/\n\f\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 241\n\"May I come? Trevelyan's Trevelyl^ans [sic], 1.30, May 7th\n[or perhaps \"the\"], \/75 H.S. S. [or J.] [?] change letter [or\n\" better \"] to Miss J.\n\" Myers North must be here again on Thursday.\"\n[Here was a line drawn from page two to page three of the\nsheet of note-paper, as if to show the sequence in which the\nremaining part of the writing was to be read.]\n\" He will not now change, may be opening, am inclined to\nsay so.\"\nThen came two signatures. The first that of H. Sidgwick (?),\nthe second that of F. W. H. Myers.\nIn the first signature the initial letters H. S. aie clearly and\nboldly formed, but they are followed by a cramped and un\ndecipherable scribble. This scribble may possibly be an unsuc\ncessful attempt to write the last seven letters of the name\nSidgwick, but I think they represent an attempt at the initials\n\" F. W. H. M.,\" and that the Sidgwick signature is confined, as\nin some other instances in the script, to the initials H. S. The\nsecond signature, \" F. W. H. Myers,\" appears underneath the first\nand right in the extreme right-hand corner of the paper in an\nentirely different handwriting. It is badly and weakly written,\nand would not, I imagine, be considered a good imitation of Mr.\nMyers' ordinary signature ; but it is extraordinarily like some\nspecimens of Mr. Myers' signatures as he wrote them in the last\nfew weeks of his life. I have unfortunately destroyed the letters\nwhich I received from Mr. Myers during the period of his last\nillness, but I have a most clear and vivid recollection of the\nincreasing deterioration in his handwriting, and particularly in\nthe signature.\nAbove the sentence beginning \" He will not now change \" was\nwritten the following :\u2014\n\" Myers says certainly go Myers says better go go out of\ntown not now not now the day not here.\"\nThis ends the Sidgwick script. Mrs. Verrall had a sitting\nthe day after this last specimen was written, but though\nNelly gave messages from Professor Sidgwick and conveyed\nexplanations from him about the last piece of automatic script,\nhe neither directly spoke nor wrote.\nMiss Alice Johnson's estimate of the resemblance of the\nscript to Professor Sidgwick's handwriting has already been\n\f-242 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nquoted. Mrs. Sidgwick, in a letter addressed to Sir Oliver\nLodge, speaks of \" the unmistakable likeness of the hand\nwriting \" ; and Mrs. Benson in a letter addressed to me after\nexamining the various sheets containing the script, says of\nthem :\u2014\" The more I look at them, the more I am struck\nwith the likeness.\"\nI showed specimens of the script to one or two people who\nwere well acquainted with Professor Sidgwick's handwriting,\nwithout of course giving any hint of what answer I was ex\npecting, and asked them to cast just a cursory glance at\nthem, and then say whose handwriting it was. In each case\nthe answer came without hesitation, to the effect that it was\nProfessor Sidgwick's writing. I give reproductions of specimens\nof his pencil writing (taken from a book of rough notes on\nmany different subjects, and marked 1, 2, 3, 4), also some\nreproductions of his signature, taken from letters, in order\nthat the reader may compare the automatic script with\nthem. As evidence for identity the script, remarkable\nthough it is, seems to me worth little or nothing. I am\nnot much of a dreamer, and at best am not a vivid one,\nand I am about as poor a visualiser as could be found, yet\nin my dreams I have more than once dreamt that I\nhave received letters from a friend or acquaintance, and in\nthe dream-letter the characteristic handwriting of my dream-\ncorrespondent has been depicted to the life. If so poor\na visualiser as myself can in sleep summon up so clear a\npicture of another's handwriting, it is reasonable to suppose\nthat Mrs. Thompson in trance enjoys at least an equal\ncapacity, and there seems to me to lie but a small step between\nsuch capacity for visualisation and the power of making a\ngraphic reproduction of the visual image.\nIt is true that Mrs. Thompson says that she has never\nseen Professor Sidgwick's handwriting ; and I entirely accept\nthat statement if it is taken to mean (and Mrs. Thompson.\nI should say, meant no more than this by it) that she has\nno conscious recollection of having seen it. But it is possible\nthat either at Mr. Myers' house, or at some other house at\nCambridge, some specimen may have come within her range\nof vision.\nNelly said to Mrs. Verrall on January .\",lst, 1901 :\u2014\n\f\f\f\f\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 24#\n\" Mother looked on his photograph (i.e. a signed photograph\nof Mr. Sidgwick) to see if the signature were the same, and\ndid not think the ' Sidgwick,' written full, like. She's not\ngot any writing of his.\"\nThe possibility of forgery must suggest itself to every\nmind ; but only in my opinion to be instantly dismissed\nafter a careful study of the documents, after consideration of\nthe fact of at least some portion of the script having been\nproduced currente calamo before a witness, and then with the\npencil held in an unusual fashion, and also on general grounds.\nSitting of June 2nd, 1900.\nIn spite of Nelly's denial of responsibility for any of the\nautomatic script, there is one instance where it is extremely\ndifficult to suppose that she was not the author of it.\nAt this sitting a lady had entered the seance-room towards\nthe end of the trance ; and after Nelly had made one or\ntwo slight references to her, the following sentences were\nwritten :\u2014\" Don't ask me any more questions. I hate the\nblue blouse.\" The lady in question was wearing a blue\nblouse. Now, throughout this sitting there was not the\nslightest indication that any control other than Nelly was\nconcerned in the communications ; and, even apart from that\nfact, the context indisputably shows that the \" I \" must refer\nto Nelly. The phraseology, too, is characteristic of her, and\nnot at all of the other controls. Nor could this exception\nbe explained away as an automatism in accord with other\nautomatisms displayed elsewhere in the course of these\nphenomena, for, where it has sometimes happened that a\ncontrol has unconsciously resorted to automatic writing, the\nwriting has been produced simultaneously with the expression\nby means of direct speech of similar sentiments. The\nsimplest explanation of the exception here to the general rule\nlaid down by Nelly is that she wrote, instead of spoke, her\nfeelings in order to avoid giving offence. Still the fact\nremains that this instance invalidates Nelly's definite pro\nnouncement :\u2014\" It's not me that writes. It's always somebody\nelse that's writing. Not me, even if I tell you so.\"\n\f244 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nSitting of January 1st, 1901.\nMiss Bates was the sitter on this occasion, and, directly\nshe entered the room, Nelly implied that the Geoffrey Scott\ncontrol was waiting and anxious to communicate. Now,\nalthough Miss Bates did not come to the sitting with the\nintention of getting communications from or about the Scott\ncontrol, still it is not inconceivable that there was a certain\nsignificance in his appearance on the scene, for she had not\nlong before been staying with Mrs. Scott, and had, I believe,\ntalked over with her the communications purporting to come\nfrom this control. Not that I am inclined to attach any\nweight to the coincidence, such as it is, for it was a defect,\nin my opinion, of a large number of the sittings with\nThompson that the sitters were chosen from far too circum\nscribed a circle : so circumscribed that statements about one\nindividual family or set of people had a good chance of\nproving to have some applicability, more or less remote, to\nmore than one sitter. Still the coincidence existed, and it is\ntherefore only fair to mention it. I had handed to the\nmedium a silk muffler belonging to a brother of Miss Bates;\nwhereupon Nelly said :\u2014\" Haven't you got the book ? a little\nwet book belonging to this ? a little book that has been wet?\"\nThis book had already been mentioned before in connection\nwith the Geoffrey Scott control, and consequently I under\nstood to whom Nelly's next remark was meant to refer :\u2014\n\" Never mind. Give him a pencil and let him write. \/\n\u25a0can tell you the things, and he wants to write himself.\"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"Who is he?\"\nNelly :\u2014\" The young man belonging to this (i.e. the muffler).\nIt doesn't seem a stranger. It seems as if he wants to\nwrite. He wants to write, and \/ want to talk.\"\nThe medium then began to write a message evidently\nintended to proceed from the Scott control. Nelly did not\non this occasion speak while the writing was being done, but\nwaited until it was completed.\nThen the Scott control spoke directly : to be followed\nimmediately by Nelly again, who appeared to be rather cross\nat his intrusion. After the Scott control had used the direct\nvoice, Nelly recognised who he was : though it will be\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mm. Thompson's Trance. 245\nobserved that before the completion of the script she seemed\nto be unaware of who the spirit was.\nIf one is justified in holding that Nelly represents her\nown experiences as they represent themselves to her, that is,\nif the alleged phenomena of the trance are genuine and not\npretence, one must conclude that a spirit is \" near \" enough\nto employ both direct writing and direct speech as a method\nof communication, and yet not near enough for another and\npresumably simultaneously controlling spirit to recognise ; or, if\nthese controls are no more than secondary personalities, that\nof two separate personalities in simultaneous or almost simul\ntaneous activity, personality A. can be aware of the activity\nof personality \u00a3., while yet unable or unwilling to recognise\nthe identity of its fellow-personality. If the whole thing is\nhumbug, what stupid humbug it is !\nSitting of January '3rd, 190L\n\u2022\" If the last episode might strike a sceptic as stupid humbug,\none which is to be found in this sitting would on the contrary\nhave to be rated as decidedly ingenious, and as a happy\nimitation of authentic automatism. The Percival control had\nwritten a sentence or two, and had also used the direct voice.\nNelly also had been speaking. I was engaged in taking\nsome objects out of a case which had belonged to Edward\nHorace Percival before presenting it to the medium, when\nNelly broke in with :\n\" Take his photo, out too. I know what he's like. He\nhas been here writing. (In this case Nelly was able to\nrecognise a spirit who had been writing.) Take your secrets\nwith you. He was writing because Mr. Stainton Moses\nsaid:\u2014'Write, lad, and I'll help thee.'\"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"He spoke also.\"\nNelly :\u2014\" I didn't know he spoke.\"\nThe medium then wrote :\u2014\" Kog Percy (or Perciv) Aun my\nmot.\"\nJ. 6. P.:\u2014\"What is written?\"\nNelly : \" He wrote and said : ' My mother has my photo\ngraph.' P'raps that's nothing.\"\nIt will be seen that the words, \" My mother has my\n\f246 [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nphotograph,\" had not been written, only \"My mot,\" and\nNelly apparently completed the sentence (cf. p. 240). The\nletters \" Aun \" probably were the first three letters of the\nword Aunt. E. H. Percival's aunt was present at the sitting, and\nbefore the sitters had entered the room the following had been\nwritten :\u2014\" Aunt and my mother want to come together.\"\nIt is altogether a very complex phenomenon, for Nelly knows\nthat the control has been writing, while ignorant of his having\nalso spoken, and states that he has written a sentence of\nwhich, as a matter of fact, only one word and a half actually\nwas completed.\nAccording to my notes Nelly is made to use the abbreviation\n\" photo.\", whereas she is made to report the Percival control\nas using the word \" photograph.\" I cannot absolutely guarantee\nthe exactitude of my record on this point, but I feel fairly\nconfident that the full word was employed on one occasion,\nand the abbreviated form on the other. If this really was\nso, it is but another illustration of the consistent and apparently\nundesigned maintenance of characteristic shades of difference\nin the speech of the various controls.\n(12) Prophecies.\nNelly, like the controls of most mediums, revels in pre\ndictions. A statement put in the form of a prediction has\nthis great advantage over statements which are referred to\nthe present or past that, unless the prophet is indiscreet\nenough to define the period within which fulfilment is to take\nplace, there is, if not all eternity ahead, at least many years\nin which to await verification.\nThe dominant note of a large proportion of Nelly's pro\nphecies is their gloom, their appalling gloom. I have noted\nin all 25 predictions in the series of sittings under discussion,\nand out of these eleven are of a lugubrious character. Some\nare neither cheerful nor the reverse ; the most inspiriting one\nthat I can find is to this effect, namely, that some one\n\fxlvh.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 247\nwho is dead would have been better off (i.e. would have\ncome in for money) had he lived. Nelly takes the most\ndismal views of people's health. On several occasions she\nhas shown anxiety to number my days ; not that I've ever\nallowed her to get so far, because happily I have foreseen\nwhat was coining (I have learnt to recognise the sympathetic\nvoice and manner with which she prophesies evil things),\nand stopped her in time. I will show a similar consideration for\nthose whose unhappy future Nelly has presaged by refraining\nfrom quoting their names ; but I will cite the predictions in\nfull for fear of being thought to have overstated the case.\nOf A. she said on January 10th, 1900, and she had\nalready said the same thing before :\u25a0\u2014\u25a0\" I don't think [A] will\nbe better at all. He will have to go away from [his present\nplace of residence]. ... He went to Brighton, and won't\nbe better when he comes back.\"\nSo far I am glad to say A. is better.\nOf B. Nelly said on January 16th, 1900:\u2014\"Something\nis going to happen to her. Somebody belonging to her is\ngoing to be seriously ill, a lady, an elderly lady.\"\nB. has no elderly lady in her immediate surroundings, and\nso no elderly lady belonging to her has been seriously ill.\nFor the sister of a lady from whom communications pur\nported to come death by accident was predicted. \" This lady\nhas a sister alive, and she will die just the same way. Her\nleg was bleeding so, like internal exhaustion.\" This was given\non February 6th, 1900, and the lady's sister has escaped\nher fate so far.\nOf C, to whom Nelly frequently alluded in desponding terms,\nshe said on December 20th, 1900:\u2014\"You know [O] says\nhe's cured. He isn't, it's all nonsense ; he'll break out worse\nthan ever.\" Since this prediction, with, I believe, the excep\ntion of one slight and short relapse, O.'s health, which Mrs.\nThompson knew to be very bad at the time, has maintained\na steady improvement, and he has not broken out worse than\never.\nOn October 28th, 1899, Nelly predicted of D. that she\nwas \" going to be very ill : a downright prostration ; ill\nenough not to be able to do anything or take any interest\nin anything.\" Nothing of the kind happened.\nR\n\f24$ [PART\nJ. G. Piddington.\nSome months before D. had been ill, and the illness\nresulted in a certain amount of prostration ; but apart from\nthe fact that Nelly's words, if applied to D.'s past state of\nhealth, would be too strong, the cause of D.'s illness was a\nspecific disease, and not merely general ill-health. Had Nelly\npredicted that D. would suffer from this specific disease, one\nmight have been justified in supposing that, in spite of the\nwrong time-relation, this was an instance of supernormally\nacquired knowledge.\nBut this was not the end of poor D.'s troubles. Not only\nwas she to be ill, but her illness was to be caused by a domestic\ntrouble :\u2014\" I think she will have a shock in the near future\u2014\nby Christmas\u2014caused by something to happen in her family:\nnot a death or monetary loss, but some family matter. The\nshock will quite prostrate her, but the illness will not !\u00ab\ndangerous. There is an M.P. who belongs to her family, and\nsome one between her and the M.P. will be the object of the\nshock. Cecil is the name, or anyhow some name beginning\nwith a C.\"\nD. experienced no shock by Christmas, nor after it. She\nwas not prostrated, and no member of her family is a M.P.\nIn the course of one of Mrs. Benson's sittings on Decem-\nber 18th, 1899, E., between whom and Mrs. Benson there\nis no connection, was favoured with a gloomy forecast, shot\nout in the most casual and abrupt manner.\n\" A great shock,\" exclaimed Nelly, \" coming to E.,\" and no\nmore was said about E. at that sitting.\nSome months before this sitting E. had received what might\nundoubtedly be termed \" a great shock \" from seeing a\nfriend killed before his eyes, as the result of a terrible acci\ndent. Eighteen months after the prediction E.'s mother died,\nafter a short illness, but as E.'s mother was in her 68th\nyear when she died, it is a debatable point whether her\ndeath, though preceded by only a short illness, could be\nregarded as a great shock. And in any case the words used\nby Nelly are too vague, and shocks great and small too\nfrequent in this transitory life to allow of any success being\nclaimed for the prediction.\nAt the same sitting Nelly said to F. :\u2014\" Have you got a lot\nof cotton-wool ? like rolls of cotton-wool. Perhaps it's coming.\n\fxi.vii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 249\nPackets of cotton-wool. Going to be used for some one who\nis ill in hed.\"\nF.'s wife had some six months previously undergone a\nslight operation, for which large quantities of cotton-wool had\nbeen employed.\nNelly, it will be noticed, does not refer this event with\ncertainty to the future, and so, if her statement is referred\nto the past, it has some significance ; but operations are >\nundergone by a not inconsiderable proportion of the popula\ntion, and cotton-wool is employed, I suppose, in many of\nthem, and as the patient was not indicated, such coincidence\nas there is is worth next to nothing.\nNo sooner were the words about rolls of cotton-wool out\nof her mouth than there was borne in upon Nelly's boding\nmind some vague presentiment of black fate brooding over\nMrs. Thompson's head.\n\" You'll see, something dreadful is going to happen to\nMother. I see black all round her head. As long as it's not\nVictor, it doesn't matter. Something to come after Christmas.\"\nMrs. Thompson must be acquitted of having taken steps\nto bring about a fulfilment of this prophecy, for to the best\nof my knowledge nothing dreadful happened to her. Her son\nVictor had chicken-pox about January 12th, but the attack\nwas not dangerous, and so his illness could not have been\ndescribed as \" something dreadful.\"\nAbout G., whom Mrs. Thompson knew to be seriously ill,\nNelly uttered the following prophecy on January 12th,\n1900:\u2014\"Do you think G. is going to have a fit? Looking\nblue : he seems to be put on a leather sofa\u2014not in a\nstation\u2014dark American leather\u2014very dark\u2014shiny. I can't\nhear any trains, I can't see any familiar faces.\"\nThe ascription of this event to the future is somewhat\nhesitating, and had G. had a fit under the circumstances\ndescribed, and could the fact have been shown to have been\noutside Mrs. Thompson's cognisance, some weight might have\nbeen accorded to Nelly's statement. But to the best of my\nbelief G. had no experience either before or after January\n12th, 1900, which in any way tallied with Nelly's impression.\nOn April 19th, 1900, H. was told that he \"is going to\nhave a terrible disappointment. He won't get something he\n\f250 [PART\nJ. G. Piddingtov.\nhas set his heart upon.\" More than three years have passed\nsince April 1900, hut so far the prophecy remains unfulfilled.\nOn January 18th, 1900, the following cheering statement\nwas addressed by Nelly to Mr. \" Wilson,\" who had recently\nbeen in great trouble :\u2014\" You mustn't be sad in your heart.\nYou've got a much greater trouble ahead of you than you\nthink.\" This may, of course, prove true, but so far it has\nnot.\nThis ends my list of Nelly's gloomy forebodings, and so\nfar for not one of them can success be claimed. One is almost\ntempted to deduce from them a law (\" Nelly's law \"), that if\nanything unpleasant is foretold it is sure not to come off.\nI may be accused of treating this part of the subject with\nundue flippancy. If my flippancy will only induce a flippant\nattitude in the victims of pessimistic prophecies, its object\nwill have been attained.\nRecord predictions with the utmost care, date them, and\nget them countersigned by responsible persons; place the\nrecord in a sealed envelope, and deposit it in a bank ; do\nanything with them you like, except allow yourself to be\ninfluenced by them. The bad effects that predictions can pro\nduce on nervous people are too obvious to need insisting on.\nA man sound in body and mind might listen unmoved to a\nprediction of the date and cause of his own death, mock at\nit, and disregard it. But illness comes and upsets the healthy\nbodily and mental balance, and what then 1 The prediction\nwhich sounded so absurd a few months back has now become\nrather disturbing, until at last it grips the man's imagination\nand thus may well secure its fulfilment.\nOr, another possibility, X. is told that he will be involved\nin a bad carriage accident. Some time after he is out\ndriving, the horses are frightened by a passing motor-car,\nthe prediction suddenly flashes across X.'s mind, his nerve\nis momentarily shaken by the recollection, he loses his head\nfor an instant, and an accident results, which, but for the\nparalysing effects of the prediction, would have never occurred.\nThe danger may not now appear very serious ; but we can\nalready note how gravely Spiritualists and others who believe\nin the reality of psychic phenomena treat previsions ; and as\ntime goes on, and as credence in telepathy and in other\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 251\nsimilar matters grows, the utterances of mediums will be\nmore highly prized, and no matter whether better evidence\nis forthcoming or not for previsions, prevision-stocks will\nimprove in sympathy with the general tone of the market.\nHad I now under my eyes the most abundant arid posi\ntive proof of the existence of a precognitive faculty, I should\nnot tone down my caution by a word ; for proof of the\npossibility of prevision could not alter the fact that it is\nonly a stray prophecy here and there that \" comes off \" out\nof Heaven knows how vast a total.\nBut to pass on to Nelly's other predictions:\u2014\nOn November 29th, 1899, Nelly said to Dr. van Eeden:\u2014\n\" This gentleman thinks he is going back on a certain day ;\nbut there will be some commotion, which will make him\nchange the date of departure\u2014either one day earlier or\nlater.\"\nThe date of Dr. van Eeden's departure was not fixed at\nthe time of this sitting, but he left England several days\nlater than he had intended originally. Thus the main point\nof the prediction was fulfilled, but, as usual, the details lacked\nfulfilment; for there was no commotion, and the departure\nwas neither delayed nor advanced by one day, but delayed\nby several days.\nA somewhat similar prediction was uttered on February\ntith, 1900, concerning Mr. Myers, who was then abroad\n\" Mr. Myers,\" said Nelly, \" won't come home before the\nsecond week in April.\"\nMr. Myers' note on this is as follow :\u2014\" I then felt certain\nof returning March 31st, or April 2nd at latest. My wife's\nillness delayed me till April 17th.\" Nelly's actual words\ncould apply correctly to April 17th; but their more natural\nmeaning is that Mr. Myers would return in the course of\nthe second week in April : which he did not do.\nBut whatever interpretation is put upon the words, neither\nthis prediction, nor that about Dr. van Eeden's return home,\nstrikes me as at all remarkable. Travellers' plans are so often\nupset, and the dates of departures and returns so frequently\nmodified that it would be a safe shot to make in a large\nproportion of cases, especially where people are travelling for\npleasure or health, and are not bound down by the restric\n\f252 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\ntions of return tickets of short validity, that the return home\nwould not take place quite so soon as was expected.\nA definite date is assigned in another prediction which\nfollowed close on the heels of the last. Towards the close of\nthe sitting of February 6th, 1900, the last, as Mrs. Thompson\nknew, which she would be able to give for some time, Nelly said\nto me:\u2014\"I shall see you on the 4th of April.\" (See p. 202.)\nBut the next sitting which I had with Mrs. Thompson was\non April 19th. Mrs. Thompson was at home on April 4th,\nand, \" that the prophecy might be fulfilled which was spoken\nby the mouth of \" Nelly, could have offered me a sitting on\nthat day, which I, having forgotten all about the prediction,\nshould have guilelessly accepted. As a matter of fact, having,\nas I said, forgotten the prophecy entirely, I went on April 5th\nto Hampstead on the chance of finding Mrs. Thompson at\nhome. I met her in the street on her way to keep an\nengagement, and there was no sitting. I am glad that I\ndid not go on April 4th, or my subliminal would have been\naccused of having by an unworthy underhand trick attempted\nto score a success for Nelly.\nAs it was, the subliminal behaviour of Mrs. Thompson and\nmyself was beyond reproach.\nAnother prediction of Nelly's Mrs. Thompson could have\nfulfilled had she wished to, instead of which she prevented\nits fulfilment. The prediction concerned a particular dress\nwhich was to be worn by Mrs. Thompson's daughter. Mrs.\nThompson gave away the dress and so her daughter never\nwore it.\nOn December 18th, 1899, Nelly said in the course of\none of Mrs. Benson's sittings which was held at my house :\u2014\n\" What has Mrs. Finch to do with this room ? There is\nsomething which muddles up Mrs. Finch with this room\"\n.\/. O. P. :\u2014\" I mentioned to your mother that Mrs. Finch\nwas coming.\"\nNelly :\u2014\" No, not that. It's like a feeling of Mrs. Finch\nwith a cloak on with fur inside.\"\nLater Nelly referred again to the same subject, this time\nputting her statement into the form of a prediction.\n\" Mrs. Finch will come here with a fur cloak. Mother\nhasn't got one. Bed colour outside.\"\n\fxlvii.] Pfienomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 253\nOn the occasion of her second visit to my house Mrs.\nFinch wore a fur cloak, but the colour outside was not red,\nbut brown. In any case, even had the prediction been verified,\nit would have been worth little or nothing, because as Mrs.\nThompson was acquainted with Mrs. Finch, she might have\nknown that she possessed a fur cloak of the kind described,\nand also because fur cloaks are worn by many people in the\nwinter, and I suppose a good many are red outside. But\nNelly's statement goes some way to show that Mrs. Thompson\ndoes not devise prophetic utterances from facts within her\nconscious knowledge. Indeed, I think this is sufficiently\nclear already from the gloomy anticipations which Nelly ex\npressed about the health of two persons known to Mrs.\nThompson. They were both in a bad state of health, as\nMrs. Thompson knew quite well, but, so far as I can form\nan opinion, there does not appear to me to have been any\nreason to regard their condition despondently, nor do I believe\nthat Mrs. Thompson was in possession of any special information\nwhich would have led her to form a less hopeful view of\ntheir prospects of recovery than I for instance did. Mrs.\nThompson often spoke to me in a perfectly open and natural\nway about the two invalids, and never, so far as I remember,\ndid she express opinions about their state of health which\ncoincided with those expressed by the trance-personality. To\nthe approaching dissolution of another individual known to\nmyself and also to Mrs. Thompson Nelly often alludes. This\nindividual is in average good health, and not \" at all old, is\nif anything in an improved state of health now, and I cannot\nimagine why Nelly looks forward to his approaching end with\nso much apparent certitude. It may be that this tendency\nto kill off people is a \" note \" of automatic romance. I think\nI have noticed in my own dream-fancyings a tendency to\nkill off my friends and acquaintances with an indelicate pre\ncipitancy quite unwarranted by their actual physical condition.\nThough, as I have said, Mrs. Thompson in trance does not\nas a rule devise prophetic utterances from facts normally\nknown to her, there are two apparent exceptions : though\neven of these one only came true.\nBoth referred to the Psychological Congress held at Paris in\n1900, which Mrs. Thompson attended, and at the time the\n\f254 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\npredictions were given, I think she knew she either was\ngoing to attend it or was likely to. The two sitters concerned\nwere Dr. van Eeden and Dr. Max Dessoir; and although I\nsee no reason for supposing that Mrs. Thompson was aware\nof the identity of either, yet before trance began she must\nhave recognised by their accent that both were foreigners,\nand it would be a natural enough assumption that any foreign\ngentleman who came to have a sitting with her would very\nlikely be, if not one of our corresponding members, at least\nsome one with an interest in psychology, and as such likely\nto attend the Congress in Paris.\nTo Dr. van Eeden Nelly said on December 1st, 1899:\u2014\"You\nare going to see my mother in Paris next year. You will be\nwearing a lighter-coloured felt hat at Paris than you are wearing\nnow. But if you remember this prophecy, you must not go and\nbuy one on purpose.\" Dr. van Eeden did meet Mrs. Thompson\nat the Congress the next year, but he followed Nelly's wise\nadvice, and did not go and buy a lighter-coloured hat.\nTo Dr. Max Dessoir Nelly said on April 19th, 1900 \u2014\n\" When he sees me the next time he won't recognise me. I\nshall see him at Professor Richet's. Flnno\u2014and Professor\nRichet will be altogether. Professor Richet, Mr. Myers, and\nyou (i.e. Dr. Dessoir), and ' Whiskers,' and Flumeroy.\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"Flournoy?\"\nNelly :\u2014\" No, not Flournoy.'\nJ. G. P. :\u2014\" Flammarion ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" Not Flammarion\u2014will be at Richet's.\"\nAs a matter of fact Dr. Dessoir was not at the Paris Congress\nand even if he had been, and had Mrs. Thompson met him there\nat Professor Richet's house in the company of Mr. Myers, the\nprediction would, of course, have been worth nothing.\nI cannot attach much greater importance to another prediction\nof Nelly's which did indeed come true, and which at first sight\nis rather striking. A very effective prediction I should term it\nbut a little reflection, together with some mauvaise volonti\ndepreciates its charms. It has already been recorded in Pro\nceedings, Part XLIV., p. 95. Nelly said to Dr. van Eeden at\nthe close of his second sitting:\u2014\"Don't have any of that red\nsauce with fish at Cambridge. It won't suit you.\"\nAt the time Mrs. Thompson knew that she was going to meet\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 255\nDr. van Eeden at Cambridge in the course of a day or two at\nMrs. Verrall's. It is a natural assumption that fish will form\none of the courses at dinner, and fish sauces are usually either\nred, white, yellow, or green, and of the four, white and red, I\nshould say, are the commoner. When Mrs. Thompson and Dr.\nvan Eeden dined at Mrs. Verrall's the fish sauce was red. Nelly\nrather cunningly remarked at a sitting held after the dinner :\u2014\n\" It is funny you had red sauce with white fish. At Mother's\nhouse you would have had white sauce.\"\nWhen Dr. van Eeden asked Nelly why she had advised him\nnot to take the sauce, she replied :\u2014\" Well, don't you feel\nthirsty ? \" Dr. van Eeden denied the suggestion, and then\nNelly at once asked :\u2014\" Are you a vegetable man ( \" Dr. van\nEeden is a vegetarian, and this was no doubt what Nelly wished\nto convey. Dr. van Eeden considers that the likeliest explana\ntion of the apparently irrelevant juxtaposition of the references\nto the unsuitability of the red fish-sauce and to his vegetarianism\nis to be found in the fact of the sauce having been coloured with\ncochineal, a process repugnant to strict vegetarian principles.\nBut if sauce coloured with cochineal is an unsuitable diet for\na vegetarian, a fortiori the fish would be too. Dr. van Eeden's\nexegesis appears to me too subtle, and it is easier, I think, to\nsuppose that the original reference to the fish-sauce and its\nunsuitability was only Nelly's roundabout way of saying:\u2014\n\" You're a vegetarian, and you're going to stay at a house where\nyou won't get a vegetarian diet ; \" in other words, the red fish-\nsauce was used symbolically. The actual words used should be\nnoted. They were :\u2014\" That red sauce with fish.\" The accent\nseems to be on the sauce, but it would be quite in keeping with\nNelly's phraseology to take the words to mean no more than\n\"fish with red sauce.\"\nMy conclusion, then, is that Nelly's warning to Dr. van Eeden\nneed not, and indeed should not, be treated as precognitive, but\n.simply as a specimen of the dramatic utilisation of knowledge\n.supernormally acquired from the sitter.\nThree more unsuccessful prophecies remain to be recorded.\nOn January \">th, 1900, Nelly said to Mrs. X.:\u2014\"It seems\nto me you will go abroad in the spring. I don't know what it\nwould be for you would go abroad.\"\nMrs. X.:\u2014\" Far abroad ? \"\n\f256 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nNelly :\u2014\" Yes, it would be just the Continent.\"\nMany people go abroad to the Continent in the spring and at\nother seasons of the year ; so, even had the prediction come true,\nit would not have been remarkable ; but Mrs. X. was disobliging\nenough not to do so, nor at the time of the sitting did she think\nthere was any likelihood of her doing so, so Nelly's remark could\nnot be put down to her having read some project latent in Mrs.\nX.'s mind. Her husband was fighting in South Africa at the\ntime, and if she were to take a journey abroad at all she may\nwell have fancied that her destination would be South Africa.\nHence, I imagine, the question, \" Far abroad ? \" : to which Nelly\nought of course to have replied if she had any respect for pro\nfessional precedent :\u2014\" Oh, yes ; far, far abroad ; I see you on a\nbig ship, etc., etc.\"\nThe next prophecy was given in what seemed to be the\nmost gratuitous manner. On January 10th, 1900, Nelly said\ncasually :\u2014\" You know so and so (naming a well-known per\nsonage). They call her F. in private. I'm going to talk to\nher one of these days. She isn't hard in her heart.\" And\nthen almost directly afterwards :\u2014\" What I saw was [the great\npersonage's] photo.\u2014then the letter F.\"\nThe medium was holding a letter signed F. which had been\ngiven her at the previous sitting, and given in such a way that\nshe could have seen the signature. The personage's name\nalso began with F., and this appears to have been the only\nfoundation, not only for the association of ideas, but also for\nthe prediction, which, though it may of course come true one\nof these days, has not come true so far, and is not, I think,\never likely to.\nThen again on April 19th, 1900, Dr. Max Dessoir was\ntold that \" he will have cause for rushing up against van\nRenterghem, both in body and opinions.\" Nelly had intro\nduced the subject by saying, \" I want to say that name\nvan Renterghem. I don't want to call this gentleman (i.e.\nDr. Dessoir) by that name.\" This prediction is similar in\ncharacter to two predictions already mentioned, in which\nNelly told first Dr. van Eeden and later Dr. Dessoir that\nthey would meet her or her mother at the Paris Congress\nof Psychology, and a similar explanation of the train of\nreasoning which gave rise to these two predictions can be\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 257\napplied here. Dr. van Renterghem, a well-known physician\nat Amsterdam, who both practises and has written about\nhypnotism, had been associated by Nelly with Dr. van Eeden,\nand rightly so. Before associating Dr. Dessoir with Dr. van\nEenterghem, Nelly had recognised Dr. Dessoir as a hypnotist.\nMindful, it may be, of the frequency of controversy between\nbrothers of the same craft, Nelly hazards the not unlikely\nguess that two fellow hypnotists would \" rush up against one\nanother both in body and opinions,\" a forceful expression\nnot entirely unsuitable to many a fray where doctors\ndisagree. Happily, in this case, our two distinguished\nforeign members have hitherto failed to live up to the pre\ndiction.\nOn December 20th, 1900, Nelly predicted who would be\nthe sitter at the next sitting. \" I'm going to see you with that\nspectacled gentleman the next time. I don't know who it is.\nPut it down for the truth.\"\nI put it down for the truth, and took no measures either\nto help or to impede the truth coming true.\nUnhappily, instead of a spectacled gentleman, the next sitter\nwas a lady wearing pince-nez. Nelly pointed out the failure\nherself :\u2014\" The gentleman with the spectacles\u2014I told you he\nwas coming. You see it isn't a gentleman with spectacles\non.\" She was not in the least disconcerted, ( nor did she try\nto explain away the non-success of her prediction. In fact the\nfailure of her predictions does not seem to worry her ; I\nsuppose she has the good sense to set no great store by them.\nAnd yet, as my last two instances will show, some of her\nprophecies are veridical.\nThus on February 1st, 1900, Nelly remarked en por,ss\u00ab\u00ab\u00a3 :\u2014\n\" Why's Colin Campbell written on your head ? He's coming.\nI've got to talk to him one of these days.\"\nMr. Myers, when he saw the record of this sitting, wrote\nthe following comment : \" I have a friend of that name whom\nI have since independently thought of asking to a seance.\" By\nthe words \" since independently \" Mr. Myers evidently meant\n\" since the prediction was given, and before I saw the record.\"\nIt is true that Colin Campbell is connected by Nelly with\nme, and not with Mr. Myers; but if Mr. Myers' friend had\nhad a sitting with Mrs. Thompson about this time, it is pro\n\f258 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nbable that I should have been present as recorder. I cannot\nprove, of course, that Airs. Thompson did not know that Mr.\nMyers knew Mr. Colin Campbell. She may have known it\nand done no more than make a lucky guess. Xor must\nwe assume that, because Mr. Myers did not consciously\nremember having thought of Mr. Colin Campbell as a\npossible sitter until after Nelly's statement had been made,\nsubconsciously he hail not already contemplated asking him\nto come to a sitting. iStill, if we regard the incident as\nindicative of supernormal faculty of some kind, we cannot\nanyhow class it as a case of true prevision, for Mr. Colin\nCampbell never did attend a sitting, and, so far as I am aware,\nhe was not even invited.\nBut whatever doubts I have about this case, I have no\nhesitation in dismissing guess-work or normal processes of\nobtaining information as inadequate to explain the final\ninstance on my list. Towards the end of a sitting held on\nJanuary 3rd, 1901, nothing having occurred to suggest the\nremark, Nelly said :\u2014\n\" Will you give my love to her\u2014Mr. Ernest Bennett\u2014you\nknow who I mean. I'm talking to you (i.e. J. G. P.)\u2014not\nabout the book. He's going to tell you a lot of things.\n(This was repeated.)\n\" What made me think of it (this in answer to a question\nasked by J. G. P.) was 1 saw a lot of people dressed up like\nghosts, and then I could hear you and Mr. Bennett laughing\u2014\nand then\u2014and then you seem to have indigestion after.\"\nJ. G. P.:\u2014\"Is it future or past?\"\nNelly:\u2014\"After; it's what you've got to come to.\"\nNow the facts which seem to me to correspond with\nNelly's words too closely to be explained by chance coinci\ndence were these.\nThe sitting ended about 5 p.m., and after it 1 went\nstraight home. Being overtired, and as a consequence of the\nover-fatigue suffering from indigestion, I lay down on my\nbed in order to rest. I had been resting some twenty\nminutes or so when Mr. Ernest Bennett called to see me. I\nhad no idea, he was going to call, nor did I know any par\nticular reason why he should. I asked him to come and talk\nto me in my bedroom, so that I might remain lying down.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 25?)\nI mention this detail in order to show that the attack of\nindigestion was of a sufficiently definite character to make\nme receive a caller in my bedroom. Of course, as soon as\nI was told that Mr. Bennett had called, Nelly's prediction\ncaiue into my mind ; but I was careful to avoid leading the\nconversation in any way which might bring about a fulfil\nment. Mr. Bennett at once explained the object of his visit,\nwhich was to tell me of his experiences at a haunted house\nin the West of England. I had been investigating the case,\nand I knew that Mr. Bennett was also interested in it, and\nthat he proposed to go and stay in the haunted house on the\nfirst convenient opportunity. I could not at the time\nremember with certainty whether I had known that he had\nvisited, or was shortly going to visit the house : my impression\nwas that I was unaware of his having actually carried out his\nprojected visit. I am inclined to think that this impression\nwas correct, because, when Mr. Bennett called at my house,\nI had not any notion what he could be coming to talk about :\nand also when Nelly spoke about Mr. Bennett and people\ndressing up as ghosts it suggested nothing to my mind.\nA good many different phenomena were said to have taken\nplace at the haunted house in question. I was inclined at the\ntime to set down the tales of haunting to hallucinations pro\nduced by fright on young people of highly nervous tempera\nments, and had not thought of attributing them to practical\njoking. Mr. Bennett, in the course of narrating his experi\nences, expressed the opinion that one of the alleged phenomena\nwas due to a servant's practical joke.\nIt is true that we had a good laugh over this and other\nmatters : but I think Mrs. Thompson either knew or knew of\nMr. Ernest Bennett, and if so, I cannot attach much importance\nto Nelly having said : \" Then 1 could hear you and Mr.\nBennett laughing.\" Mr. Bennett will, I hope, forgive me, if\nI say that, as a rule, where he is, there too is laughter, and\noften \" laughter holding both her sides.\"\nSo, too, it may not have needed any supernormal faculty to\nsurmise that I should suffer from indigestion within an hour\nor so of the sitting ; but it was not said that Mr. Bennett would\n\" tell me a lot of things \" within the next hour or two, and\nour conversation and my fit of indigestion were foretold as\n\f2G0 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nnearly contemporaneous events, to happen at some quite\nundefined future time.\nAgain, Mr. Bennett and myself being both psychical re\nsearchers, it may be urged that there was nothing extra\nordinary in prophesying that at some future time he\nwould \" tell me a lot of things,\" and that among the lot of\nthings ghosts and practical joking would be referred to. Or\nagain, it may be objected that Nelly did not categorically say\nthat Mr. Bennett would talk about people dressing up as\nghosts, and that all she said was :\u2014\" I saw a lot of people\ndressed up like ghosts, and then I could hear you and Mr.\nBennett laughing.\" That is true enough, but though each\nseparate statement made by Nelly can be whittled away in\nsome such fashion, we have not to consider only each com\nponent statement separately, but also the whole compound\nstatement. And here, for my own part, I feel compelled\nto have recourse to an explanation involving some form of\nsupernormal faculty.\nThe manner in which the message emerged rather suggests\nthat the source of Nelly's knowledge was telepathic. First\nshe seems to be in communication with Mr. Bennett. She\ndiscovers that he is going to \" tell me a lot of things,\" and\nthat the subject of his communication is ghosts, and that it\nis provocative of mirth. All these three facts were almost\ncertainly in Mr. Bennett's thoughts at the time of the sitting.\n\" And then you seem to have indigestion.\" Here she appears\nto enlarge her survey of the eventuality by drawing on my own\nknowledge of my physical condition, or perhaps by her own\nperception of it. The words, \" and then \"\u2014repeated\u2014may\nperhaps indicate a fresh source of information. A telepathic\n\u25a0explanation will suffice ; but I own that I felt at the time\nthat Nelly was not by any complicated process deducing the\nfuture from present knowledge, but really watching and\ndescribing an event in the future as it presented itself dc\ntoute pidce before her eyes.\n\fXLvil.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 261\n(13) A Pet Subject of Nelly's.\nThere is one string on which Nelly harps with such per\nsistency that I grew to listen for the familiar twang at each\nsitting. Babies\u2014babies who died at, or before, or soon after\nbirth, are a subject of irresistible attraction to Nelly. What\none may ask can be the reason of this cliche' ? It can hardly\nbe for the sake of scoring an easy hit, for Nelly has a very\nclear notion of what is evidentially telling, and more than once,\nafter making some obvious statement, she has pulled herself up\nand spontaneously deprecated any value being allowed to it.\nNor does it seem probable that this tendency to saddle sitters\nwith dead little brothers or sisters or children is a method of\n\" fishing,\" for even if the sitter owns to the fact, how can\nthe admission afford any further clue likely to be of assistance,\nor what pregnant inference can be drawn from it ?\nIt may be that the explanation must be looked for in the\nparticular circumstances of the life-history of the real Nelly,\nMrs. Thompson's daughter Nelly died when only a few months\nold, and her own brief span of earth-life may perhaps account\nfor her interest in \"the fate of the unbaptised.\" This hypothesis\nwill hold good whichever view is taken of the nature of the\nNelly control: for if Nelly be no more than the heroine of a\nwork of trance-fiction, she is a life-like creation, and to invent\nfor her this sympathetic interest in those who had suffered a like\nfate to that of her own prototype would be a faithful touch no\nwhit, I suppose, beyond the powers of secondary personality.\nOr, again, it may be a \" note \" of trance-communications ; for\nthough I cannot pretend to have analysed the Piper records\nad hoc, 1 think I am justified in saying that with Phinuit, too,\ninfantum animae are a favourite topic, though, by the way,\nhe and Nelly are far from representing them as Jlcntes in limine\nprima.\nWhatever be the true explanation, considering the very\nlarge proportion of families which must number among their\ndead some member whose lease of life lapsed after a few short\n\f262 J. 0. Piddington.\nhours or weeks, the references made by Nelly to deaths in\nbabyhood met with relatively only small success.\nSir Oliver Lodge (see Proceedings, Vol. VI., p. 450) has\nnoticed that Phinuit \" seems to be under some compulsion not\nto be silent,\" and he thinks that a good deal of his conversation\nis introduced as a stop-gap. Possibly under this head should\nfall many of Phinuit's references to dead babies. Nelly, so far\nas my observation goes, does not exhibit any signs of being under\nany compulsion to talk ; at the end of a sitting when the serious\nwork is over she will chatter like a magpie, but during the\nserious business of the seance she does not appear to be under\nany necessity to speak without intermission. .Sometimes she\nwill go away for a few minutes ; at others, maintain silence\nfor a minute or two. So I do not fancy that Nelly inter\npolates statements about babies in order to mark time.\nThroughout spiritualistic trance-communications may be\nobserved a uniformly latitudinarian strain : an emphatic pro\ntest against theological bigotry and dogmatism of all kinds\nirrespective of any particular creed or sect. I suppose that\nnothing has been more abhorrent to the modern conscience\nthan certain eschatological teachings about the fate of unbaptised\nchildren : and it is conceivable that the insistence both of\nPhinuit and of Nelly upon the presence of babies in the same\nspheres of existence which the adult dead inhabit should be\ntraced to a common desire to protest against this damnable\ndogma.\nSitting of November 29th, 1899.\nThis was Dr. van Eeden's first sitting, but the trance-utter\nances were not entirely confined to his affairs : references being\nalso made to Professor William James, and to a former sitter\ncalled by Nelly \" Paymond's mother.\" Raymond was the dead\nson, and about him Nelly had at former sittings given many\ncorrect details. On this occasion she added a few more, one\nof which ultimately proved to be true, although the mother\nwas not able to verify it at the time, and in fact had never\nknown it. In the course of the additional statements about\nKaymond the following occurred :\u2014\" Paymond said there was\na little baby belonging to ' them ' that wasn't grown up, and\nit has not got a name at all.\"\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 263\nWith regard to this point Kaymond's mother wrote to me\non Februaiy 11th, 1900:\u2014\"This is very puzzling, and I can\nonly think of the fact that my mother died in premature child\nbirth more than 20 years ago. Nelly has each time claimed\nmy mother's care as being given to my little boy.\"\nBut obviously so indirect a correspondence as this cannot\npossibly count.\nSitting of December 1st, 1899.\nDr. van Eeden had handed to the medium a box containing\nthe hair of a dead gentleman. The box had been in the\npossession of his widow for several years. Several correct\nstatements were made about both the husband and the wife,\nthough there was a certain amount of confusion, facts being\npredicated of the man which would have been true of the\nwoman and vice versd. There was a break in the trance, and\nthe second part of the sitting Nelly opened with these words :\u2014\n\" What was that dead baby associated with the hair-lady ? It\nwas not properly born.\" Dr. van Eeden said :\u2014\" I don't know \" ;\nand for the moment Nelly dropped the subject. But a few\nminutes later she reverted to it saying to Dr. van Eeden :\u2014\" I\nwish you would think about the dead baby. The hair-lady\nhas the entire management of the dead baby.\"\nThe \"hair-lady\" was not dead, and so could not have the\nmanagement of a dead baby, even had there been a dead baby\nto manage, and, so far as Dr. van Eeden could discover, there\nwas no dead baby which could be said to be associated with\neither the lady or her husband.\nThe first reference to the baby formed the introductory words\nof the second part of the sitting, so in this instance there was\nno need for \"gagging,\" for, if Nelly ever does \"gag\" in the\nPhinuit manner, she would hardly do so immediately on\nresuming after a recuperative interval, but by way of pulling\nherself together for a fresh effort : bavarder pour mieux parler.\nSiiting of January 5th, 1900.\nFour persons were present at the beginning of this sitting,\nbut the principal sitter was a lady whom I call Miss Gordon.\nIn the course of it Nelly said to Miss Gordon :\u2014\" This all\ns\n\f264 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\ncomes through a little girl who died long ago\u2014your sister.\nShe is now grown up.\"\nMiss Gordon never had a baby sister, or a sister who died\nyoung. A brother died two hours after birth.\nSitting of January 18th, 1900.\nMr. \" Wilson \" was the sitter on this occasion. Early in the\nsitting Nelly gave a personal description of a girl, which Mr.\nWilson regarded as \" a very good description \" of a girl cousin\nof a dead lady to whom had belonged a stocking which he\nhad just presented to the medium. This identification is sup\nported by the fact that throughout Mr. Wilson's sittings many\nother references were made which can be aptly applied to the\ncousin. Following directly on the personal description came\nthese words :\u2014\" She seems to be taking charge of a little boy,\na tiny brother or baby who died a long time ago.\" \" The\nbaby looks up to her not as a mother, but as to an elder\nsister.\"\nNow the \" she \" would at first sight seem to refer to the\ncousin whose personal appearance had just before been sketched,\nbut, although Nelly had not up to this point mentioned the\nlady called in the published report of these sittings Miss Clegg,\nboth Mr. Wilson and myself understood the \" she \" to refer to\na new character ; and anyhow it was clear from what was\nsaid later that the dead baby was not associated in Nelly's\nmind with the cousin, but with Miss Clegg. This second re\nference made just before a break in the trance ran as follows :\u2014\n\" She (i.e. Miss Clegg) has got a dead baby with her. I've got\none of Mother's dead babies at our house. Mother doesn't\nthink it was a little live boy, but it was.\" And later she\nadded :\u2014\" You wouldn't mind me saying that there is a dead\nbaby in connection with the stocking.\" It will be noticed that\nthe \" little boy, a tiny brother or baby \" has become a mere\n\" dead baby \" of undefined sex. In reality a sister of Miss\nClegg's had died in babyhood.\nSitting of January 25th, 1900.\nThis was Mr. Wilson's second sitting. No further reference\nwas made to the baby associated with Miss Clegg, but Nelly\n\filvil] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 265\nsaid :\u2014\" I couldn't find the lady {i.e. Miss Clegg) anywhere. I\ncould only find a brother of this gentleman {i.e. Mr. Wilson1)\nwho died when he was quite a tiny microbe baby.\" A\nbrother of Mr. Wilson's had died within a few hours after its\nbirth.\nSitting of May 30th, 1900.\nIn the course of this sitting Nelly said to Mrs. Benson :\n\" When I died, a little baby\u2014little baby boy died belonging to\nyou. He died when he was a tiny boy. He loves you just\nthe same.\"\nThis statement is not correct.\nSitting of June 2nd, 1900.\nTowards the end of this, Dr. van Eeden's fifth sitting, a lady\nstaying in the house where the seance was held entered the\nroom, coming in from behind the medium. According to her\nown assertion Mrs. Thompson had not previously met her\nabout the house. Before coming into what would appear to be\nthe medium's range of vision Nelly said :\u2014\" I can see her : she\nhas a light drab-coloured skirt. She has a brother in our\nhouse. (Here the lady signified her dissent.) I am quite\nsure about it. He has died perhaps as a baby.\"\nThis, I must admit, is in the true Phinuitesque manner.\nSitting of June 1th, 1900.\nAt this, Dr. van Eeden's sixth sitting, he asked Nelly for\nmore information about this lady's little brother, and the\nanswer came again in the typical Phinuit style :\u2014\" It was a\ngrown up man saying ' This is my sister.' \"\n(14) Nelly on Physical Phenomena.\nMrs. Piper has never, I believe, claimed to produce\nphysical phenomena: and among a certain school of psychical\nresearchers this failure to sound \" toute la lyre \" of mediumship\n\f2Gb' [PAKT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nhas been counted unto her for righteousness. Having a\nsneaking affection for physical phenomena, I am glad that\nNelly has the courage of her opinions and boldly proclaims\ntheir feasibility, and further lays claim to having produced\nsuch things herself.\nSo in this matter too we note a distinction between the\nphenomena of Mrs. Piper and those of Mrs. Thompson ; and\nit is a distinction which Mrs. Thompson, were she an im\npostor, and well acquainted as she is with the attitude of\nmany members of this Society towards physical phenomena,\nwould have taken good care not to have invented, and certainly\nnot to have emphasised.\nSitting of November 29th, 1899.\nNelly :\u2014\" That gentleman [i.e. Dr. van Eeden] has been to a\nmaterialising seance.\"\nDr. van Eeden :\u2014\" When ? \"\nNelly :\u2014\" A short time ago. There is a strong influence of\nsomebody cheating all the time : taking off clothes and so on :\nfraudulent throughout.\"\nThis statement was not applicable to Dr. van Eeden ;\nthough it would have been to myself, the recorder.\nI then asked Nelly to tell me what she thought about\nmaterialisations : were they occasionally genuine ? In reply\nshe gave this message from Mrs. Cartwright :\u2014\" Whenever a\nspirit materialises it is quite a spontaneous thing.\"\nNelly proceeded to explain this by saying :\u2014\" It can't be\ndone to order once a week \" ; and added, \" Mrs. Cartwright\ndictated that bit \" (meaning the dictum about materialisation\nbeing a spontaneous thing), \"and also about Alice James\"\n(referring to a previous incident in the sitting).\nVery soon after this Dr. van Eeden asks Nelly if she can\nappear to people in dreams, and gets the reply :\u2014\" I never\ntried except with Mother. I'm going to materialise one day\nfor Father to show him the colour of my hair : black curly\nhair, not light like Mother's.\"\n\" Mr. Thurstan's sister came and talked at Mother's house.\nShe was materialised.\" (This was quoted as an instance of\na non-fraudulent materialisation.)\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 267\n\" Mrs. Corner once was properly materialised\u2014about three\nyears ago\u2014at a lady's house.\"\nSitting of January 11th, 1901.\n\" Mr. Gurney went and talked to Miss Rawson. He\ndoesn't even mind knocking a table for her.\"\nUnfortunately I have not had access to all the records of\nMiss Rawson's trances, which, moreover, have not, I believe,\nbeen very methodically kept, and I cannot therefore speak\nwith complete certainty, but from the best information that\nI have been able to obtain it appears that a soi-disant Edmund\nGurney does play some part in Miss Rawson's trance-phenomena,\nthough it is not certain that this control has ever purported\nto communicate by means of raps in her case. For a fuller\ndiscussion see pp. 301-2.\nSitting of January 12th, 1900.\nA propos of Mrs. Benson Nelly said :\u2014\" There's a place in\nBirmingham where Mother often goes : it's ' Bensons Limited.'\nI knocked and shook a table in that shop before I knew Mr.\nMyers.\"\n(15) The \"Susanna Parkes \" Case.\nI offer no apology for including in this report another incident\nwhich cannot be treated as evidential, because my main aim\nthroughout has been not so much to bring forward ' evidential '\nfacts as by applying the test of classification to see how far\nthe phenomena present a consistent character, such as we\nshould expect to result from an examination of genuine, and\nnot from an examination of spurious phenomena.\nThe incident in question belongs to a class which lends\nitself readily to the ridicule of the man who prides himself\nupon his common-sense. I have a good deal of sympathy\n\f268 [part\nJ. 0. Piddington.\nwith that type of person, perhaps more because he is such\na refreshing contrast to the man who seems to pride himself\nupon the want of it than from any deep admiration for his\nintellectual penetration. There is a certain danger, too, in\nallowing weight to a type of phenomenon which can not only\nbe aped by the dishonest with the greatest ease, but which can\nalso be used to explain away many a suspicious circumstance.\nYet, if the objections of the common-sense man had always\nbeen listened to, there would have been no psychical research.\nI venture therefore to proceed, after warning the man of\ncommon common-sense off this section.\nThe facts of the case were reported in writing to Mr.\nMyers by Mr. Thompson as long ago as November 2 7 th,\n1899: a point of some importance; for, had nothing been\nheard of the matter before the publication of Dr. Hodgson's\nreport on his six sittings with Mrs. Thompson, or before, at\nany rate, it was known that he was not satisfied of her bona\nfides, it would have been a reasonable suggestion that the\nfollowing story had been concocted for the purpose of throw\ning a favourable light on those circumstances of Mrs. Barker's\nsittings which aroused Ur. Hodgson's suspicions.\nI append Mr. Thompson's report, which is dated November\n27th, 1899:\u2014\nRe Control Susanna Parkrs.\nOn Monday, 26th June, 1899, Mrs. Thompson was suddenly con\ntrolled by what purported to be an old lady. Certainly Mrs.\nThompson's face was very drawn, and she looked quite different\nwhilst influenced to speak to any time previously. I quite felt at\nthe time it was an old person speaking : her voice and manner\nwere just those of an old-fashioned country person. I put the\nfollowing questions :\u2014\n1. Who are you?\nWith great difficulty the control said : \" Susanna Parkes.\"\n2. Where did you live when on earth ?\n\" Birmingham.\"\n3. How old were you when you died ?\n\" Sixty-nine.\"\n4. What ailment caused your death ?\n\" Great sufferer, great sufferer.\"\n(I could not get any other reply than this.)\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 269\n5. Are you any relation of our old friend Miss Parkes ? I cannot\nthink of any one else of that name.\n\"Yes, I am her mother. She is my only child Mary.\"\n6. Have you any message for Mary? though I fear now, through\nage, she would not understand a message, if you sent one to her.\nShe has lost her memory.\n\"I have no message. I was buried at All Saints' Church.\"\nDirectly she had finished saying this Mrs. Thompson awoke. I\ntold her what had taken place, read my notes aloud, and asked\nher if she knew these facts : the very old lad}', Miss Parkes, being\nmore a friend of Mrs. Thompson's than of mine.\nShe replied:\u2014 \"I do not know anything of Miss Parkes' rela\ntives, except that she had a blind father. I only knew Miss\nParkes in 1886, and she was nearly seventy then. I know she\nwas an only child, and that she had no living relatives ; that when\nher parents were alive they lived in Birmingham ; but I never\nremember her speaking of the place where her mother was buried\nor of her age.\"\nMiss Parkes lives still in Birmingham, but is too old to be\nquestioned, so we let the matter drop until one day in September,\n1899, Mrs. Thompson found a very old diary of 1855 in a play-\ncloset amongst the children's toys, etc. She found out it had been\ngiven in December, 1888, to one of the children by Miss Parkes:\nthe child having visited the old lady, it had been given him to\nplay with. Mrs. Thompson opened the diary, and the first thing\nshe saw was an entry of Miss Parkes' mother's death.\nYou will notice the old lady who controlled Mrs. Thompson\ngave no details except what was written down.\nMrs. Thompson says she is positive she had never seen or known\nof the existence of that diary ; it being folded up in a case similar\nto a Banker's pass book, in darkish red leather, and was certainly\nnot an ordinary every-day looking thing.\nMrs. Thompson and myself were the only people who knew of\nthe Susanna Parkes incident, but Mrs. Thompson wishes me to write\nout these details as being of interest with regard to the question :\n\" Are names and facts which have been written easier for a spirit\nto see than when they only exist in one's memory?\"\nI am rather inclined to think they are. Of course this does not\nalter the fact that the controls or spirits very often give accounts of\nthings neither written or in one's memory : prophecies of the future,\nfor instance.\n\f270 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nWith this report Mr. Thompson sent the leaf from the\nalmanack containing the entry of the death. The date of the\nalmanack is 1855, and the entry made under the date of\nFebruary 13th, runs as follows:\u2014\n\"Friday, 13th, 1857. My Mother died at 1 in the morning after\n9 months' suffering and was hurried [sic] at All Saints' Church the\n15, aged 69. Susanna Parkes.\"\nIt will he seen that Mr. Thompson was not quite right in\nstating that the control gave no details except such as were\nwritten in the almanack. In the trance the name of Susanna\nParkes' daughter was given as Mary, the latter was said to be an\nonly daughter, and the place where the former lived was\ngiven as Birmingham. But these details, which were not con\ntained in the entry in the almanack, were probably all known\nto Mrs. Thompson, or if not known, could have been guessed.\nMrs. Thompson knew that Miss Parkes was an only child,\nand that her parents lived in Birmingham, and it is safe\nto assume that she knew Miss Parkes' Christian name to be\nMary.\nWhatever view is taken of the character of the control in\nthis case, it would be difficult to deny that the subject-matter\nof the communication was drawn from, or based on, or sug\ngested by, the entry in the almanack.\nI asked Nelly about this incident at the sitting of Novem\nber 29th, 1899, and Nelly gave the following explanation:\n\u2014that \" Auntie Parkes was really controlling her mother ;\nthat the spirits did not get at the information contained in\nthe almanack, but Susanna Parkes was led to give the same\ninformation as in the almanack ' by association.' \"\nThis comment is not illuminating, and it in some degree\nclashes with a remark made by Mrs. Cartwright in the course\nof Mrs. Barker's second sitting (see Proceedings, Part XLIV.,\np. 151): \"The worst is we read the contents of a letter with\nout getting the message of the spirit.\"\nYet this case is not entirely unparalleled : the familiar ex\nperience of thinking of a person while a letter from this\nperson is lying in your letter-box has some points in common\nwith it ; and sometimes under these circumstances even the\ncontents of the unopened letter appear to enter the mind of\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 271\nthe addressee. For instances of this\u2014instances, however, so far\nvery rare\u2014see Human Personality, Vol. I., sections 42 1H and\nJ, and 656B of the Appendices.\nIf there is such a faculty as clairvoyance, and by clairvoy\nance I mean supernormal acquisition of knowledge under\ncircumstances where telepathy from the mind of a living or\ndead being is excluded, belief in such a phenomenon as the\none under consideration does not present so great difficulty\nas it must if telepathy is the only process by which a mind\ncan receive impressions otherwise than through the organs of\nsense. Unfortunately the evidence for clairvoyance is weak,\nand so it seems the wiser course to content ourselves with\nrecording cases of this kind, and to wait patiently in the hope\nof fresh evidence pointing in the same direction.\nYet the mere contiguity of a thing\u2014of a material thing\u2014\ndoes appear to facilitate the reception of (presumably) telepathic\nmessages ; for otherwise why is it the almost universal, or at\nleast the favourite, custom of mediums to hold an object con\nnected with the person, whether living or dead, about whom\ncommunications are sought for ? And the psychometrist too\nseems unable to get to work at all without handling a material\n\u25a0object.\nIn the case of an entranced medium, or of a clairvoyant\nor psychometrist, it is possible to suppose that the handling\nof an object has a subjective effect on the imagination of\nthe sensitive, and in this way helps towards a successful\nresult; but such an explanation would hardly hold water in\nthis case, since Mrs. Thompson was unaware of the existence\nof the almanack. If the almanack had anything to do with\nthe trance-utterance (and it is well-nigh impossible to imagine\nthat it had not) the effect produced by it must be put\ndown to its contiguity, or perhaps one should say to the fact\nof the medium having been in its vicinity.\n(16) \"Suspicious Circumstances.\"\nI have already mentioned (see p. 224) that Mrs. Thompson\nonce displayed knowledge of the name of one of her sitters, Mrs.\nBenson, who at the time was supposed to be unknown to her.\n\f272 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nAt Mrs. Benson's first sitting, on December 18th, 1899, her\nname was not mentioned ; but by the time that her second\nsitting (January 23rd, 1900) was held Nelly had talked about\nher by name frequently. In the first few days of February,\n1900, I happened to be calling on Mrs. Crackanthorpe, a lady\nwhom Mrs. Thompson knows well. She mentioned to me quite\ncasually in the course of conversation that Mrs. Thompson had\ntold her that she had teen giving sittings to a Mrs. Benson.\nSo on the earliest opportunity I asked Mrs. Thompson if she\nremembered the name of the lady with white hair who had had\ntwo sittings with her lately. Mrs. Thompson could not recall\nthe name at once, but finally said \" Mrs. Benson,\" and when I\nfurther asked her how she had succeeded in recalling the name,\nshe said she had done so by thinking of \" Bensons Limited,\" a\nrestaurant in Birmingham (see p. 225). In reply to my further\nquestions she went on to explain that she had learnt the name\nthrough Mr. Thompson, who had been told it by Nelly. Mr.\nThompson had asked Nelly for communications on his own\naccount, and on Nelly excusing herself on the plea of having a\nlot of work to do for other sitters, he had playfully taunted her\nwith being too much taken up with \" all these grand people \"\nand refusing to take any trouble for her own father. To this\nNelly had replied :\u2014\" Oh ! it's only Mrs. Benson : she isn't a\ngrand person ; she's only an old lady with grey hair.\"\nAfter the trance Mr. Thompson had given an account to his\nwife of what Nelly had said.\nNow, it is quite evident that, if Nelly knows either the name\nof or any other fact about a sitter, there is nothing to prevent\nher from communicating her information to Mrs. Thompson,\neither directly in some clairvoyant manner, or by using Mr.\nThompson as an intermediary. As a matter of fact I do not\nbelieve that this is a general practice of Nelly's, but if she\nacted in this way once she may do it always. I have quoted\nvarious instances of Mrs. Thompson acquiring information from\nNelly when at home about things that have occurred at sittings;\nand these instances show that Mrs. Thompson's explanation of\nher knowledge of Mrs. Benson's name involved the dragging in\nof no new type of psychical experience, and that it was no\nhastily vamped up excuse invented on the spur of the moment\nto cover a slip on her part. I may add that her whole manner\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 273\nduring our conversation was perfectly easy and natural, and not\nin the least that of a person who has been cornered. Nor did\nshe pretend for one moment that she did not know Mrs. Benson's\nname ; it was clear that she knew she knew it, and that her only\nhesitation was caused by a momentary inability to recall the\nactual name. But, it may be asked, why did not Mrs. Thompson\nherself spontaneously tell me that she had learnt the name, as on\nother occasions she had told me of information imparted to her\nby Nelly ?\nApart from the question of whether it would have seemed to\nMrs. Thompson a matter of importance to let me know that she\nknew that Nelly had said that a sitter's name was so and so, I\ndoubt if I gave her much opportunity for avowing her knowledge,\nfor I questioned her on the subject on the first occasion that I\nsaw her after I had seen Mrs. Crackanthorpe, that is on February\n6th, 1900, and I put my questions before trance began, and as\nsoon as we had both settled down to prepare for the oncoming of\nthe trance after the ordinary greetings were over.\nIf Mrs. Thompson had learnt of the identity of her sitter in\nsome underhand way, it would stand to reason that she would\ntake care to conceal her knowledge. Yet what do we actually\nfind her doing ? Letting out the fact that she knows a name\nwhich she would be supposed not to have known, and letting it\nout, not to some one who would be safe not to come in contact\nwith her investigators, but to a lady whom she knew I knew, a\nlady, too, who was a member of our Society, and the wife of a\nmember of our Council.\nThere were other circumstances connected with Mrs. Benson's\nsittings which I propose to deal with here under the head\nof \" suspicious circumstances,\" though the term is inept, or at\nleast must, to have any aptitude at all, be understood in a Pick\nwickian sense, for the circumstances do not really, or ought not\nto, cast suspicion on Mrs. Thompson. I am by no means sure\nthat they ought not rather to be discussed under a heading\nentitled \" Stupidities of Investigators,\" and followed by com\nments by Mrs. Thompson herself. The circumstances were these.\nThe first object handed to Mrs. Thompson at Mrs. Benson's\nfirst sitting was a ring, and this ring, I greatly regret to say,\nI failed to observe was inscribed inside with the full names\nof a dead son of Mrs. Benson : Martin White Benson.\n\f274 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nAfter this it is perhaps almost superfluous to add the\nfollowing :\u2014On the occasion of the second sitting (January\n23rd, 1900) Mrs. Benson and I were talking in my dining-\nroom, where the seance was to be held, before the arrival of\nMrs. Thompson. The dining-room opens into the hall, and\nthe door of the dining-room happened to be slightly ajar.\nNeither Mrs. Benson nor I heard the bell ring or the front\ndoor open, and at the moment when the servant was opening\nthe door in order to show Mrs. Thompson into the room, I\naddressed Mrs. Benson by name. A few seconds, however,\nelapsed before Mrs. Thompson entered the room. I do not\nthink that she could have normally heard me utter the name,\nbut hyperiesthetic audition cannot, of course, be excluded.\nMy carelessness having thus twice provided Mrs. Thompson\nwith a possible clue to the identity of her sitter, and that\nsitter happening to be the widow of the late Archbishop of\nCanterbury, and herself a well-known woman, and also Mr.\nArthur Benson's Lift of the Archbishop having appeared before\nthe first sitting took place, I need scarcely say that it is\npractically impossible to treat any statements made by the\nmedium in trance relating to the past history of Mrs. Benson\nand her family as evidence for supernormal faculty. Yet I\ncannot regret that these sittings were continued, for not only\ndid they furnish some points of great psychological interest,\nreferred to in previous sections, but also some exceptionally good\nevidence for supernormal faculty. This latter I propose to\ngive in detail, not only for its intrinsic interest, but also in\norder to forestall what might under the peculiar circumstances\nbe a natural conclusion, namely, that normal causes would\nsuffice to explain all the phenomena of Mrs. Benson's sittings.\nI fully appreciate how vexatious it must be to mediums\n\" when,\" as Mrs. Thompson has herself expressed it, (see the\nJournal, S.P.R. for November, 1901) \"statements made\nby them in trance have been deprived of their proper evidential\nvalue through laxity in the conditions.\"\nYet at the same time I would add in self-defence that I\ndoubt if any one can realise without prolonged experience how\ndifficult a matter it is to guard against each and every pos\nsible kind of laxity in the conditions of a seance, and how\neasy it may be for an experimenter or observer while fully\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 275\non the alert for the less obvious sources of error to overlook\nthe most obvious. Our insistence on the great allowance to\nbe made for malobservation has, more than anything else,\nbrought on us the remonstrances of Spiritualists ; but such\nremonstrances would, I think, have been less vigorously ex\npressed if they had but realised that it is our own personal\nand sad experiences which have largely contributed to our\nrecognition of the untrustworthiness of human observation.\nSuch attention as the work of the S.P.R. has met with from\ncritical minds is perhaps due to a large extent to our frank\nrecognition of our own fallibility.\nExtract from Mrs. Benson's second sitting held on\nJanuary 2'6rd, 1900.\n(A sealed packet handed to the medium. Mrs. Benson writes in\nreference to this incident as follows :\u2014\" I gave the sealed packet,\nsealed by my daughter ill at the time at home, to the medium.\nAt her wish I broke the seal and gave it her back.

Do you leave Mrs. Thompson at 4.30 ? \" So I then asked\nMrs. T. when she had this conviction, and she said at 2.12, when\nshe had looked at the clock that she might be in time ; so the\ntimes corresponded.

I quite agreed\nwith this view. Note by Mrs. Benson.]\n\f278 [part\n\/. G. Piddington.\nAs the details of these various incidents are rather difficult\nto follow, I append Mrs. Benson's own account of and com\nmentary on them :\u2014\n. . . The condition of my daughter's health is characteristically\ndescribed in very unmedical language. At the time of my second\nsitting, January 23rd, 1900, my daughter was recovering from an\nattack of pneumonia, which Mrs Thompson described, speaking of\nthe patient as my daughter. Later on, on being given a packet\nsealed up by my daughter, she went on describing symptoms,\ntouching on the point that food was of much importance, and added\nthat it was windy the night before the packet was sealed. I had\nnot remembered this, though I must have known it; and my\ndaughter corroborated it by the fact that her shutters were barred\nfor the first time during a fortnight's illness. At the sitting on\nMay 1st, 1900, in connection with another sealed packet from mj-\ndaughter, she described the general state of her health, and after\nspeaking of her as being delicate, nervous, and obliged to lie down,\nadded she \" doesn't want to be limp : ought not to be an invalid,\nbut take sufficient rest to do her good \" : all of which were char\nacteristic, as well as true, touches about my daughter's general\nhealth. She also made one or two fairly accurate statements about\nmy daughter's dress, etc.\nThere are further facts, some known to me, others not known\nor forgotten, which still more evidently the medium could not have\nreceived through normal channels : e.g. that one emerald of my\nengagement ring had once come out ; that we had kept an unneces\nsarily large number of old books. Two other incidents of this kind\nare of special interest. On May 30th, when I arrived, Mrs.\nThompson told me that she had been careful to be punctual, as\nshe knew 1 had to leave at 4.30. I asked her when she knew\nthis, and she said at 2.12. I had, previously to coming up to\nLondon, had no engagement till 5 o'clock, but a lady with whom\nI was lunching said at the end of lunch, \"Do come back to tea\u2014\ndo you leave Mrs. Thompson at 4.30 1 \" \" Nelly \" alluded to this\nduring the sitting. . . .\nBut the things of most evidential value are those concerned with\nmatters which I myself did not know.\n(1) One is the point about the shop where we got our potatoes\nat Winchester. I do not suppose I ever knew it, but Mrs. Thomp\nson described it as double-fronted and served by one man and two\nwomen, adding other details unverified. I found, however, on\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 279\nasking a servant who had been with us at Winchester that it\nstood at a corner with a window each way, and was served by\none man and two women.\n(2) My daughter sent up twice a sealed packet, putting in each\npacket things which she did not show me. I undid each packet\nand handed the things, wrapped up, to the medium, but did not\nmyself see them, and should not have recognised them.\nEach time Mrs. Thompson described (see above) with considerable\naccuracy my daughter's condition, adding the first time the details\nabout the windy night. She then stated (making very few incorrect\nstatements at the same time) that the brooch belonged to more than\none generation, that my daughter was the third, that it contained\nthe hair of a lady and of two of her children who had died ;\nthat \" there was a workbox\u2014rosewood workbox\u2014little silk places\nwhere you keep silks and ribbons \" ; the truth being that the\nbrooch contained the hair of my mother and my brothers and\nsister, two of whom had died as children; that it had been given\nto my daughter by her old nurse, who had also been our nurse ;\nthat it came out of an old rosewood box, half workbox, half\ndressing-case, lined with red silk, which had been given to my\nelder daughter by her god-mother. The brooch had never been\nworn; the box had passed straight to my second daughter; I could\nnot have seen either of these things for years and had forgotten\ntheir existence.\n('\u25a0I) The second sealed packet contained a garnet ring and a silver\nbangle, given to my daughter by a friend who had a sister Edith.\nMy daughter had worn the bangle often, though some years ago.\nAgain I did not recognise the things, but Mrs. Thompson stated,\n\"A sort of sister Edith belonging to it, and a lot more trinkets\nbesides this. This lady had only a few. There are two things\nhere : one has been worn by the lady who sent it, the other she\nhasn't worn\u2014as if it had been lying by.\" All these points are\ntrue, except that my daughter had worn the ring once.\n(4) A still more curious point is that at the sitting of May 30th,\n1900, Mrs. Thompson suddenly said, \"Your daughter is thinking\nabout giving a wedding present to somebody. She seems to be\nvery careful with her money. (A little laugh.) Oh, I can see her\nlooking at her money and thinking about the wedding present.\"\nOn returning home I found my daughter had been going very\ncarefully over her accounts ; she did not understand the allusion\nto the wedding present until she remembered having considered a\nT\n\f280 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nmemorandum of a wedding present already given jointly with me,\nher share in which she had not yet paid.\nMrs. Benson further remarks that the facts of which she\nherself had no knowledge, and which the medium could not\nhave known in any normal manner, \" were perhaps more clearly\ngiven than any other, and more free from confused and in\naccurate detail.\"\nA large number of the statements about Mrs. Benson's\nfamily which it is possible to assume Mrs. Thompson could\nhave known or learnt in a normal way were given with much\nconfusion. We are accordingly faced with the problem : How\nis it that the facts which, it would appear, could not have\nbeen learnt normally, were given more clearly than the facts\nwhich were normally ascertainable ? A solution is not rendered\neasier when we take into account that the most telling of the\nformer class\u2014namely, the statements made when the medium\nwas handed the two sealed packets\u2014were given definitely in\nconnection with certain objects, and were particularly relevant\nto the past history of the objects themselves, or to their past\nor present owners ; whereas the latter class of facts, as often\nas not, were not given in connection with any particular\nobjects, but were scattered over ten sittings, at six of which\nMrs. Benson herself was not present, and when no object\nconnected with her was in the room.\nMrs. Benson has expressed, in a letter addressed to Sir\nOliver Lodge, the effect produced on her by her sittings with\nMrs. Thompson. I am glad to be able to reproduce this letter\nhere, because it embodies the opinion of a keen observer, and\nalso because it gives expression to a view of Mrs. Thompson\nupon which in my opinion too much emphasis cannot be\nplaced : namely, her abnormal power of normal observation, if\nI may so express it. Mrs. Benson seems to limit this ex\naggerated perceptive faculty to Mrs. Thompson's trance-state,\nbut that may be due to a concise style of writing. Anyhow\nI would put no such limitation on Mrs. Thompson's powers\nof observation. \" A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles,\" \" sharp\nas a needle,\" \" 'cute as nails,\" \" see through a brick wall \" :\nall such proverbialisms I would apply without hesitation to\nMrs. Thompson in her normal state, and with a few ex\nceptions, where Nelly has not accepted the broadest of hints,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 281\nto her trance-state. Women are proverbially swift at seizing\nwhat the duller man would treat as impalpable indications ;\nbut after making every allowance for her sex, I still think\nthat Mrs. Thompson displays this perceptive faculty in a\nsuperlative degree. At the same time I do not think however\nhighly developed her normal powers of observation and\ninference may be that they will explain all her phenomena.\nI most emphatically disclaim any such assertion, but I do\nmaintain that a very large discount must be made before any\nof her phenomena are attributed to supernormal faculty.\nI cannot help wondering whether this peculiarity of Mrs.\nThompson may not be typical of mediums in general. It has\nnot been noted, and is, I believe, markedly absent in the\ncase of Mrs. Piper ; but that does not necessarily negative\nmy suggestion. This heightened power of normal observation,\nwhich Mrs. Thompson displays both in and out of trance,\nmay in Mrs. Piper's case be confined to her entranced state ;\nand if this is the case, it would be only one more indication\nof the complete disseverance of the normal from the trance\nconsciousness of Mrs. Piper, and of the lack of any such\nhard and fast cleavage in the case of Mrs. Thompson. Yet\nfundamentally the mental process in either case may be\nidentical, although the occasion of its display may not be.\nMrs. Benson, writing privately to Sir Oliver Lodge in answer\nto some questions, says :\u2014\n\"October 28<A [1903].\n\"... I should like to explain a little my position toward Mrs.\nThompson. I enjoyed the sittings with her extremely, and certainly\nhad some very interesting experiences\u2014especially one of clairvoy\nance at the last sitting. But nothing occurred which tended to\nalter the view with which I began the sittings\u2014that the phenomena\ndid not need to be accounted for by an external intelligence.\n\"I told Mr. Myers this from the first, and it almost seemed to\nme towards the end of the sittings that Mrs. Thompson herself tended\nto drop the 'Nelly' theory.1 As you say, we had many interesting\n1 1 understand that Mrs. Benson's meaning is not that Mrs. Thompson in\nher normal state was disposed to drop the ' Nelly ' theory, but that in the later\nsittings Nelly retreated more or more into the background, and the medium\ntended to act as her own spokesman without a go-between. I myself have\nobserved no such tendency ; though Nelly is ready enough at any time to\nsuggest or admit that her information may have been derived from her\n\f2S2 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nthings ; but none of them were accompanied by any of the fine\nshades and nuances of which you speak\u2014nothing occurred which led\nme to feel that vivid touch of personality which is the touch of all\nrecognition\u2014wherever she strayed beyond my ken, it was always\nwildly inappropriate. Her power seemed to me to lie in telepathic\ngrasp\u2014with me, and also with my daughter whom she had never\nseen, and whom I had never called by that name.\n\" I always thought she was in good faith, as far as her will and\nconsciousness were concerned, but more and more I felt that the\npsychical part of her was so much more developed than any other\nthat she perceived indications almost as a highly-trained animal\ndoes, far beyond and outside the regions I had access to\u2014and in\nthis subliminal consciousness a certain amount of acting might go\non, for which one could not hold her responsible, but which required\nto be met by extreme carefulness. Therefore the fact of having sup\nplied her most unfortunately at the very beginning with a consider\nable clue which her subliminal could follow out with extraordinary\ncleverness, seems to me to nullify the trustworthiness of her\nabnormal powers to a very great degree.\n\" I should value more than I can say some more sittings with\nher, because I should like to try some safeguards that I had in my\nmind after the last sitting. I know that this is extremely impro\nbable, but I only say it to show you how far removed I am from\ndoubting her supraliminal good faith.\"\nThe second ease involving \" suspicious circumstances \" is rather\ncomplicated, and as I am compelled to conceal the identity of\nmother's brain. The normal Mrs. Thompson has au equally open miiul\nwith regard to the source of her trance-utterances, and holds no passionate\nconviction as to the nature of the Nelly control. When Mrs. Piper ex\npressed an opinion about her own phenomena it was generally agreed that\nshe was one of the last persons qualified to form an estimate of her\nown case. I would not go as far as tins in the case of Mrs. Thompson,\nfor not only has she a clear grasp of some of the problems involved, but in\nview of the fact that complete amnesia does not always follow her trance, and\nthat she has psychical experiences of an apparently supernormal kind without\nlapsing from ordinary consciousness, her subjective feelings ought not to be\nentirely disregarded. Yet I find that Mrs. Thompson's opinion about her\nfamiliar control fluctuates ; at one time she seems overborne by a conviction\nof the separate existence of Nelly, and at another half disposed to think that\nNelly is no more than her own subliminal : a state of indecision faithfully\nreflected in my own mind, though I sometimes incline towards a third alter\nnative : namely, that Nelly is \" a bit of both.\"\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 283\nthe persons concerned by adopting pseudonyms, and by sub\nstituting fictitious though analogous details for the real ones,\nthe difficulty of clear exposition is rendered all the harder.\nIn making these necessary changes I have been most careful\nto avoid selecting analogies which might allow a more favour\nable construction to be placed on the incident than the original\nrecord warrants, and in one instance from inability to hit\nupon a completely representative parallel I have adopted one\nwhich does not give Mrs. Thompson the benefit of the doubt.\nI was aware that Mrs. Thompson was well acquainted with\nthe relations and history of a certain individual whom I shall\ncall Mr. Wilfred Strong. It accordingly occurred to me that\nan interesting experiment would be to bring as a sitter to\nMrs. Thompson some intimate friend of the dead man, if one\ncould be found who, as far as could be ascertained after careful\nenquiry, should be entirely unknown to the medium ; the object\nof the experiment being to see whether appropriate communica\ntions would be given, and, if so, how such knowledge of Mr.\nStrong as might be shown by Mrs. Thompson in trance would\ncompare with knowledge which I knew, or had reason to\nsuppose that Mrs. Thompson normally possessed about him.\nI knew at the time that under no circumstances would it\nbe possible to publish for evidential purposes whatever might\nbe the results of the sitting, and I tried it solely for my\nown edification.\nIt may seem in now citing the results of this sitting\nunder the heading ' suspicious circumstances ' to lay myself\nopen to a charge of taking a mean advantage of a lady who\nwas deserving of considerate and fair dealing. As a matter\nof fact I had at the time of the seance no insidious inten\ntions. It must be understood that the carelessness of the\nconditions which obtained at this sitting is not typical of the\nconditions of the other sittings where evidential phenomena\nwere sought. The laxity was not precisely intentional, but\nthe stance was allowed to become rather a ' go as you\nplease ' affair, as unless Mr. Strong's identity was discovered\nby the medium the chief object of the experiment would\nnot have been attained.\nSo far as I could then ascertain\u2014and nothing has occurred\nsince to modify my opinion\u2014the sitter whom I selected, and\n\f284 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nwhom I shall call Miss Gordon, satisfied in every respect the\nrequirements of the case.\nTo the sitting Miss Gordon brought three objects connected\nwith Mr. Strong : (a) A single sheet of uotepaper, on which\nwere eleven words in Mr. Strong's handwriting. No proper\nname was on the sheet of paper. The words were these :\u2014\n\" From the conductor to his little fairy god-sister. September\n189\u2014.\"\n(b) A letter written by Mr. Strong to Miss Gordon, and\ncovering four sides of notepaper. It was handed open to tbe\nmedium, but folded in two : the fourth (last) page being outer\nmost. On the lower half of the last page were the words :\n\" off the grass, and when in doubt ask a policeman. Always\nyour devoted brother F. Edinburgh, October 1.\"\n(c) A half length photograph of Mr. Strong. There was no\nsignature on the pbotograph, but on the back was the name\nand address of the photographer, \" Tomlin, London and Scar\nborough.\" It was handed to the medium in a large open\nenvelope.\nIn connection with object (a), which was the first to be\nhanded to the medium, five statements were made ; two of\nwhich were right, one probably right, and two probably wrong.\nThe two right statements might have been inferred from the\nwriting and the words on the paper. The one statement\nwhich was probably right was not very distinctive.\nAfter making the five statements referred to above in con\nnection with (a) Nelly asked to be given another letter \" from\nthe same brother.\" Mr. Strong was in reality a brother-in-\nlaw of Miss Gordon's. On the single sheet of paper (a)\noccurred the words, \" to his little fairy god-sister.\" If the\nmedium read these words' she may have inferred from them\nthat the writer was a brother of the sitter ; but I think it\nwill be admitted that such an inference is not the natural\none, and that the natural inference would rather be that the\nterm was a playful one, and that accordingly the writer and\nthe sitter were not related.\nIn connection with object (b) the following statements were\nmade, though interspersed among them were remarks addressed\nto other persons who were present during the early part of\nthe seance :\u2014\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 285\n\" Who was Frank ? not quite Frank. ... It wasn't\nFrank : more Francis : but that's not quite right. I'm talk\ning of the lady's brother.\"\n[The letter was signed \" brother F.\" Mr. Strong's name\nwas Wilfred ; but he was usually called and signed himself\nFred. The Frank and Francis are apparently guesses suggested\nby the letter F.]\n\" It says something about ' tell a policeman.' I can see\n' policeman ' written there. No, you have got to ' ask a\npoliceman ' : that is what he says when he writes.\"\n[The words \" off the grass, and when in doubt ask a\npoliceman \" were on the fourth page, and it is impossible to\nassert that they were not within the medium's range of vision.]\nA break in the trance took place at this point. During\nthe interval the letter was hidden. On resuming the seance\nNelly said :\u2014\n\" I want something to hold belonging to brother Ferdy.\"\n[Ferdy is apparently another attempt to interpret the\ninitial F. Though Nelly seems to be making shots, the fact\nof her making several shots suggests that she was not satis\nfied with any one. I do not think that any indication was\ngiven from which the medium could have gathered that the\nshots were incorrect.]\nIn connection with object (c) twenty statements in all\nwere made. Of these twenty statements six were right, two\nwere probably right, and of the rest nine were wrong, one\nprobably wrong, and two doubtful. Of the right statements\ntwo were of facts certainiy known to Mrs. Thompson ; one\nof a fact almost certainly known ; one very possibly known ;\nand two could have been, and in my opinion were, derived\nfrom the photograph handed to the medium.\nOf the two statements which were probably right, one was\npossibly known and the other very possibly known to the\nmedium.\nOf the nine wrong statements five would have been cer\ntainly known to be wrong by the normal Mrs. Thompson.\nThe remaining four the normal Mrs. Thompson may or may\nnot have known to be wrong, and the same remark applies\nto the one probably wrong statement, and also to the two\ndoubtful statements.\n\f286 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nAfter ten statements out of the twenty had been made in\nconnection with the photograph, Nelly asked me to go out of\nthe room. In my absence she made only two statements that\nseem to be meant to apply to the photograph : one of these\ntwo was a wrong statement, and a statement which the\nnormal Mrs. Thompson would have known to be wrong of Mr.\nStrong ; and the other was to this effect : \" I seem to get the\nname of Benson.\"\nThere was no connection whatever between Mrs. Benson\nand Miss Gordon. Mrs. Benson's first sitting had taken place\ntwo or three weeks before Miss Gordon's sitting, but this was\nthe first mention of her name. During my absence from the\nroom Miss Gordon thinks that Mrs. Thompson had ample\nopportunity for looking at the photograph while she was taking\nnotes, and I agree with her, for after my return Nelly gave\na perfectly accurate description of Mr. Strong's personal ap\npearance, and gave the name and address of the photographer.\nThe personal description and the name and address of the\nphotographer I have included in the list of right statements,\ncounting them as two.\nJust as Mrs. Cartwright did in the case of Mrs. Barker's\nsitting of August 8th, 1900 (see Proceedings, Part XLIV., p. 154),\nand just as the medium herself did in the case of one of Mrs.\nPereival's sittings (see above, pp. 177-8), so here Nelly drew\nattention in what it is possible to regard either as an ingenuous or\nas a disingenuous way to the source of her information. Thus\nwith reference to Mr. Strong's photograph, she remarked, before\ngiving his personal description and the name and address of\nthe photographer:\u2014\n\" The photograph seems to help me more than the letter,\nbut I will get it all distinct.\" ...\" Did I look at that\nphotograph ? Because I see it distinctly. No, it's the gentle\nman himself that I see.\"\nIt is absolutely certain that the normal Mrs. Thompson\nwould have recognised the photograph as a portrait of Mr.\nStrong at the first glimpse. At the time of the sitting I\nthought it probable that his handwriting would equally have\nbeen known to her, but I have since had reason to alter my\nopinion, and I now consider that she probably had no normal\nmeans of recognising the identity of the writer of the letters\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 287\npresented to her until the photograph came within her range\nof vision.\nIf therefore we suppose that Mrs. Thompson was not in\ntrance at all, and deliberately looked at the portrait, it follows\nthat she purposely introduced a relatively large proportion of\nwhat she knew to be incorrect statements about Mr. Strong.\nThis course, one must imagine, recommended itself to her as\none likely to divert suspicion, and one must also suppose that\nshe suspected that a trap had been laid for her. But not only\nare the correct statements outnumbered by the incorrect, but\nexcepting the personal description of Mr. Strong and the name\nand address of the photographer, the incorrect facts also out\nweigh the correct oues in detiniteness. Again, if on this occasion\nMrs. Thompson was shamming trance, I can only say that there\nwas no perceptible difference between this trance and her other\ntrances, and unless one supposes that her trance is always\nassumed and that consequently various observers, such as Mr.\nMyers, Dr. van Eeden, Mrs. Verrall, Mr. \" Wilson \" and others,\nhave been misled into thinking that Mrs. Thompson in trance\ndisplays knowledge that she could not normally have possessed,\nit must follow that Mrs. Thompson can imitate knowingly and\nconsciously her genuine unconscious trance.\nAt the time I regarded this sitting of Miss Gordon's as\nsuspicious, but I was even then inclined, and I am now, to\nreturn a verdict of \" Not proven.\" There is absolutely no\nproof of fraud ; that is the one positive statement that can\nbe made with confidence about the matter. My own belief\nnow is that Mrs. Thompson was in trance, and that the\ntrance-personality saw the words written on the paper which\nwas first handed to the medium, saw the lower half of the\nfourth page of the letter, and saw the photograph. Mrs.\nThompson uses her normal faculties during trance : she can\nget her handkerchief out of her skirt pocket (a sufficiently\ncomplicated business requiring skill and concentration, if one\nmay judge from the manoeuvres which this act demands in\nthe case of other ladies) ; I have seen her get up in the middle\nof a trance and open the door when some one knocked ; I have\nseen her search about for a pencil with which to write, and\ngenerally behave like a person with most of his faculties about\nhim. 1 therefore find nothing incongruous in her using her eye\n\f2S8 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nsight to read writing and to look at a photograph. The whole\nquestion resolves itself into this : Does Mrs. Thompson, in\naddition to exercising her normal senses, display such know\nledge as to compel belief in her possession of supernormal\nfaculty ? The problem is not : Does Mrs. Thompson ever\nexercise her normal faculties when in trance 1\nThere is one small point which goes in favour of the trance\nhaving been genuine on this occasion.\nThe paper first handed to the medium contained the words :\u2014\n\" From the conductor.\" After the photograph had been in\nthe medium's hands a long time Nelly speaking of the one\nman with whom she connected all three objects said :\u2014\n\" The young gentleman was very musical. I want to play\nthe piano and compose as I go on ; because he would rather\ndo that than play other people's music.\" Mr. Strong was not\nmusical, did not play the piano, and consequently did not\nimprovise. Nelly seems to have inferred from the word \" con\nductor \" that Mr. Strong was a musician : an inference quite\nin keeping with Nelly's style. As a matter of fact the word\nconductor had no musical significance. I believe that Mrs.\nThompson would almost certainly have known if Mr. Strong\nhad had musical abilities.\nAs has already been remarked, Nelly's utterances were not\nconfined to Miss Gordon, but she addressed remarks to two\nother people who were present at the beginning of the\nsitting, and she also described one of her \" peregrination^.\"\nThe peregrination in question was not one of the most strik\ning : yet it has a certain value as forming one of a series in\nwhich none were entirely unsuccessful. Nor are the remarks\naddressed to the two other sitters particularly striking, yet one\nof them is rather good, and if it is not to be explained as\ndue to normal knowledge or to chance, it introduces a further\nobstacle against believing that the trance was fraudulently\nassumed ; for it is almost impossible to suppose that Mrs.\nThompson goes hopping into and out of trance, and is at one\nmoment genuine and the next not.\nTo one of the sitters, Mrs. Z., Nelly said :\u2014\n\" What is this old Theodore doing ? He wants to help\nyou. You're very sorry in your heart about something I won't\nsay before all these people.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena . in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 289\nMrs. Z. :\u2014\" Yes, you may.\"\nNelly :\u2014\" Old Theodore wants to help : not young Theodore.\nYou want to go somewhere. He says you are to go.\"\nMrs. Z.:\u2014\"Who was old Theodore?\"\nNelhj :\u2014\" He was an old gentleman, when you were young.\nI think he was a doctor. He was very much mixed up in\nbringing you up.\"\nWith regard to this statement Mrs. Z. wrote :\u2014\" About two\nyears ago I knew a \" young Theodore.\" His father who had\nbeen dead some little time I had never known. He was a\ndoctor of letters and master of a well-known college. This is\ninteresting to me, though there is a wrong statement here and\nthere.\"\nRecently Mrs. Z. wrote me as follows :\u2014\" I think\u2014as\nmuch as one can be certain of anything where human minds\nare concerned\u2014I can safely say positively that Mrs. Thompson\ncould not have discovered by normal means the incident of\n' Theodore.' ' Theodore's ' father's name was also ' Theodore.' \"\nAt this point in the sitting Nelly was speaking so rapidly,\nand changing the subject so frequently, that I was unable to\nrecord all she said. Mrs. Z. thinks that another correct state\nment was made about \"young Theodore,\" which has not been\nnoted.\nIn the sittings under review, and in Mrs. VerraU's sittings,\nthe name Theodore has only twice been mentioned by Nelly,\nand so far as I am aware it has not been mentioned in other\nsittings. Nelly rightly connected a Theodore with Mrs. Verrall,\nand here she rightly connects two Theodores\u2014a father and\na son\u2014with Mrs. Z. Three times, then, the uncommon Chris\ntian name of Theodore is given by Nelly, and each time hits\nthe mark. Mrs. VerraU's Theodore is not the same person as\neither of Mrs. Z.'s Theodores, nor a member of . the same\nfamily\nA few days after this sitting I again handed the letter (6)\nto Mrs. Thompson when in trance. Mrs. Sidgwick and my\nwife were present. I placed the open letter in a plain envelope\nunder a thick cloak which Mrs. Sidgwick held tightly over\nMrs. Thompson's lap. The medium was allowed to finger the\nletter, but it was quite impossible for her to have read a\nsingle word of it. Nelly at once recognised the letter, a feat\n\f200 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\ndemanding no great aeuteness. I think anybody could, under\nthe circumstances, have recognised it by the shape, size, folding\nand feel of the paper.\nNelly then said :\u2014\" It has been in a good many hands, 1\nbelieve. Have you got the photo belonging to this ? I had\nthis once before. Put ' policeman ' down. ' When you're in\ndoubt ask a policeman.' \"\nAn apparent reference is then made to Mr. Stroug's death,\nand after going off on another tack suggested, it would seem,\nby the initial \" F,\" with which the letter was signed, Nelly\nsaid :\u2014\" Fred. I shan't say it till I'm obliged. [This was\nthe first time that Mr. Strong's nickname was correctly given.]\nSomething makes me say Derby, not the town, but there's a\nDerby association with this letter, rather like a peer, but not\nquite that.\" Then followed a statement which, if referred to\nMr. Strong, was sufficiently, though not absolutely accurate,\nand it was said that \" belonging to ' Fred's ' relations was a\nWalter\u2014Walter Stanley, or Stanley Walter.\"\nNow with regard to these statements, there are three points\nto notice which, though I do not pretend that they tell\nstrongly yet, tell somewhat in favour of the genuineness of\nthe phenomena.\n( 1 ) \" When you're in doubt ask a policeman.\" At the\nformer sitting when the letter was within the range of vision\nof the medium, these words were given as : \" tell a police\nman.\"\n. . . No, you have got to \" ask a policeman.\" At this sitting\nwhen the letter was not within the medium's range of vision,\nthe original phrase as it occurred in the letter\u2014\" when in doubt\nask a policeman \"\u2014is given with the addition of the word\n\" you're.\" One might have expected that the full phrase\nwould have been quoted when the letter could have been seen\nby the medium, and that when she had to rely on her\nmemory only the shorter form would have been given.\n(2) There was a \"Derby association\" with the letter, for\nthe envelope that had originally contained it, but which had\nnot been within Mrs. Thompson's range of vision at either\nsitting, bore an address in which the word Derby occurred,\nnot as the name of the town, but as the name of the Terrace\nin which Miss Gordon had at one time resided.\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 291\n(3) Neither Walter Stanley nor Stanley Walter was a rela\ntion of Mr. Strong, but he had had a great friend of the surname\nStanley, though the Christian name was not Walter. The\nfamily name of the Earl of Derby is Stanley, and Nelly\nwould seem to have been put on the track of this fact by\nmeans of this association of ideas.\n(17) Marked Failures in the case of Sitters with whom\nMrs. Thompson was personally acquainted.\nIn- five cases I was completely and beyond all possible\nmanner of doubt satisfied that the medium could not by\nnormal means have been acquainted with the identity of the\nsitters. In two of these cases\u2014those of \" Mr. Wilson \" and\nDr. van Eeden\u2014the sittings were successful. In the three\nother cases the results were very poor : but in two out of\nthese three there were circumstances which may, in my\nopinion, have been unfavourable to success, and possibly also\nin the third.\nI must not be understood to imply that in other cases I\nthink that Mrs. Thompson knew who her sitters were, but\nonly that I do not feel the same absolute assurance to the\ncontrary.\nBut one of the most remarkable facts about the medium-\nship of Mrs. Thompson, so far as it has come under my\nobservation, is her failure to give successful sittings to people\nabout whom she must have known a good deal, and about\nwhom she could have worked up more, and about whom her\nenlarged consciousness ought to have been able to tell even\nmore still.\nIn the first place there were my own sittings. With cer\ntain exceptions, dealt with on pp. 116-119, hardly one single fact\nwhich Mrs. Thompson did know, or could have been supposed\nto know about me and my belongings, was given in the trance :\nand the true facts which were given related almost entirely to\nmy mother, who died twenty years before I met Mrs. Thomp\n\f2!)2 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nson ; and of these facts she could not, 1 believe, have got up\nby enquiry a single one ; and some of them she could not\nhave learnt from myself, as I did not know them. And\nfurther, the communications were connected with a period of\nmy mother's life about which I had only vague knowledge, and\ngenerally with matters which were not occupying my conscious\nthoughts, until my mind was by reason of the trance-utterances\nnaturally directed thereto. The things which I consciously\nwas thinking about were not even touched on.\nIt is rather Irish to class Mrs. Thompson's success in my\nease under the head of failures, but I do so in order to direct\nattention to her avoidance of topics which were within her\nnormal range of knowledge.\nMy wife, who shared a sitting with Mrs. Sidgwick, was told\nhardly one single relevant fact; indeed, I am not sure that\nthere was one. Naturally it would have been perfectly easy\nfor Mrs. Thompson to have got up plenty of information about\nmy wife. Instead of there being the very slightest trace of\nher having done so, there was not even any reproduction of\nwhat was normally known to her.\nJust the same occurred with Mrs. Sidgwick, except that\nthere was one reference to a relation of hers whom Mrs.\nThompson has met.\nIn the joint sitting at which Mrs. Sidgwick and my wife\nwere present, there is not a single statement which can with\nconfidence be said to be right, and such as had possibly some\nsignificance are the sort of things which would be likely to\nhave some significance for nine people out of ten. Nelly\nopened the trance with the remark : \" I'm not going to be\ngood to-day. Mother's body doesn't feel clear and clean \" ; and\nshe certainly fulfilled that prediction.\nDr. Tuckey also had a bad sitting, though not quite so\nbad as the one just mentioned, for one fact was mentioned\nby Nelly in the course of it which Dr. Tuckey ultimately found\nwas true, though at the time he stated that it was wrong :\nand one other fact was stated of a relation of his which\nthough marked by himself as incorrect, I have from personal\n\u25a0observation subsequently discovered to be true.\nOnly one fact was asserted of Dr. Tuckey himself, and that\n\u2022was to the effect that he had \" drawing cords in his inside \" :\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 293\nwhatever that may mean ; and when Nelly said that a clergy\nman was associated with Dr. Tuckey's father (from whom the\ncommunications purported to come), she was careful to add\nthat though she had mentioned the clergyman it was not because\nbefore the trance Dr. Tuckey had spoken about a brother of\nhis who is in Holy Orders : in other words, she drew attention\nto the fact that the allusion to a clergyman must not be\nconsidered evidential.\nThe fact noted as wrong at the time which was verified\nthree months later was this :\nNelly :\u2014\" I want to say a lot of things. Something about\nchloroform, not giving it but taking it. . . . It was a sen\nsation of the gentleman associated with this (i.e. a wooden\nstethoscope that had belonged to Dr. Tuckey's father) having\nchloroform himself.\"\nMore than three months after the sitting Dr. Tuckey wrote\nto me to say that he had recollected that at one time his father\nwas in the habit of taking a drachm of chloroform to induce\nsleep, and that his sister remembered that her father discon\ntinued the habit at her \" earnest solicitation.\"\nThe other statement which Dr. Tuckey dismissed as wrong,\nand which I afterwards verified as correct, was to this effect :\u2014\n\" Somebody belonging to the old gentleman (i.e. Dr. Tuckey's\nfather) who has a nervous twitch in the left eye : now and\nthen, not always.\"\nI do not of course maintain that two such hits as these\nare beyond chance, especially as they were isolated hits\namong a good many misses : but either on the hypothesis of\nfraud or of what I would term the seleetive-contesserative-\ntelepathy theory, it is hard to explain why something better\nthan this was not produced.\nAnd the same remarks would apply to the sitting of\nDecember 20th, 1900, to which Mrs. Benson brought objects\nthat had belonged to her dead brother, Professor Sidgwick.\n\f294 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\n(18) Cross-Correspondences between the Trance-Utterances\nand Script of Mrs. Thompson and those of other Mediums.\nUnder the \" Peregrinations of Nelly,\" reference has been\nmade to two instances where Nelly has claimed to have\ninfluenced the phenomena of two other mediums : Mrs. Piper\nand \" Miss Rawson.\" In one case the claim was not sub\nstantiated, in the other there was an undoubted correspondence.\nThese incidents were treated as peregrinations because Nelly\nprofessed to have visited and directly controlled the mediums ;\nbut there are a few other instances of apparent concordance\nbetween the trance-utterances of Mrs. Thompson and those of\nMiss Rawson and the automatic writing of the lady whom I\ncall Mrs. Scott, of which the prima facie explanation is either\nthat Mrs. Thompson in trance becomes aware of the content of\ntheir automatic speech or script, or that one and the same\ncontrol has conveyed similar communications through two\ndifferent mediums. No \" psychical excursion \" on the part of\nNelly seems involved. So far was I (except in one case)\nfrom suspecting that these correspondences had occurred, that\nit was more or less by accident that I discovered them in the\nsummer and autumn of 1903.\nOf Miss Kawson's trance-utterances no adequate record has\nunfortunately been kept. Miss Rawson is not a professional\nmedium, nor has she consented, like Mrs. Thompson, to submit\nher phenomena to any strict investigation. She sits only with\na small circle of relations and intimate friends, and as the\nmembers of this circle have long been convinced of the extra-\nmundane source of her communications, the records of her\nutterances have been made more for edification than for a\nscientific purpose ; and as the seances were held in the dark,\nstill further allowance must be made for the deficiencies of\nthe records.\nMrs. Scott is a member of the Society who has for some\nyears past done a good deal of automatic writing, and between\nher script and Mrs. Yerrall's there have been some interesting\nand fairly numerous correspondences. I am very glad to say\nthat she is now keeuing a careful record of what she writes,\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 295\nbut at the time that the correspondences occurred between\nher script and Nelly's utterances she was not sufficiently con\nfident of her powers, nor sufficiently alive to the value of her\nphenomena to trouble about noting them systematically.\nI give first some similar trance-utterances by Miss Rawson,\nwho was then in the south of France, and Mrs. Thompson.\nMiss Rawson.\n(1) Dec. 22, 1900.\nA control speaking for and of\nH.

Myers.\nTwo points should be borne in mind in comparing these\nextracts : the first that the three sittings of January 1 1 th,\n21st, and 29th, 1901, from which the extracts have been\ntaken, were the only sittings given by Mrs. Thompson during\nthe period of eighteen days covered by these dates, and those\nof January 11th, 23rd, and 26th, 1901, were the only sittings\nof Miss Eawson between January 11th and 29th. In other\nwords, these sittings have not been selected from two series of\na dozen or more sittings.\nThe second point is that the extracts from the scanty\nrecords of Miss Rawson's sittings do not represent, as might\nbe thought, an infinitesimal portion of a large number of utter\nances purporting to come from the late Professor Sidgwick. The\nrecords, as I say, are scanty, and more may have been said\nby the Sidgwick control, and by other controls about him,\nthan has been preserved ; but the extracts quoted above\nrepresent a considerable proportion of the total record.\nThus the passage quoted from Miss Rawson's trance-utterances\nof January 11th constitutes the whole record of this sitting,\nwith the exception of two lines, which state that a regular\n(3) Jan. 26, 1901.\nA control speaking of F. W. H.\nMyers :\n\" He has sent a message to\nthe other side (Mrs. T.) but\ncame here himself.\"\n[The notes of the sitting give\nthe words, \" Mrs. T.,\" meaning\nMrs. Thompson, in brackets : in\nexplanation, as the recorder in\nformed me, of the phrase, \" the\nother side.\"\nBefore these words were\nspoken, a soidisant Myers con\ntrol had communicated.]\n\fXLVli.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 297\ncontrol of Miss Kawson's introduced the Sidgwick control with\nthese words :\u2014\" The spirit of an elderly man is here, very\nanxious to speak.\" Again, the passage quoted from the sitting\nof January 23rd, constitutes all the record of Miss Rawson's\ntrance-utterances on this date, except seven lines, in which in\nreply to a question from the sitters, the Sidgwick control\nexplains what the functions of the \" circle above \" are.\nMiss Rawson's seance on January 26th, began with direct\nspeech from a Myers control, which consisted entirely of non-\nevidential matter, and then followed a few words from\nanother control, who spoke about Mr. Myers. Nothing in\nthe utterance of either control contains any verifiable state\nment, except the part which I have quoted.\nI cannot state with confidence whether the sitting of\nDecember 22nd, 1900, contained the first reference in Miss\nRawson's trance-utterances to Professor Sidgwick, but I am\ninformed by the recorder (a member of the Society well\nknown to me, whose name I do not reveal, only because in\nso doing I should disclose the identity of Miss Rawson to\nmany people) that January 11th, 1901, was the occasion of\nthe first appearance of a direct Sidgwick control : a control,\nhe tells me, extraordinary life-like.\nIt will be remembered that Mrs. Benson had been invited\nto a sitting with Mrs. Thompson on December 20th, 1900,\nwith a view to attracting communications from or about Mr.\nSidgwick ; but his name was not even mentioned, and practi\ncally not a single statement was made in connection with\nobjects that had belonged to him which can be unhesitatingly\nset down as relevant. On any theory of the phenomena this\nsilence seems strange, nor was the silence broken, so far as\nMrs. Thompson's trance-utterances are concerned, until January\n11th, 1901 (although there had been sittings on January 1st,\n3rd, and 8th), except that at sittings previous to December\n20th, 1900, at which Mr. Myers was present, a few passing\nreferences to Mr. Sidgwick of an unverifiable nature had been\nmade by one of the controls to the effect, for example, that\nhe was quick at learning the \" language of the other side,\"\nand that he soon would be able to communicate. Even if we\nsuppose that the delay in the appearance of the control was\ndue to Mrs. Thompson's secondary self not feeling confident of\n\f298 [PAUT\nJ. G. Piddington.\nhaving worked up a sufficiently plausible personation, and that\nthe reference to Mr. Sidgwick by Miss Rawson in trance on\nDecember 22nd, was due to Mr. Myers having told her of what\nhad been said about him at Mrs. Thompson's sittings, there yet\nremains to explain not only the coincidence between the state\nments of the two mediums on January 11th, 1901, but also the\nfact that a Sidgwick control manifested itself on the same day,\nJanuary 11th, 1901, during the trance of Mrs. Thompson in\nLondon and during the trance of Miss Rawson in the South\nof France, and that up to a given point of time, namely\nJanuary 11th, 1901, messages only purported to come from Mr.\nSidgwick, to be followed by the simultaneous development of\na direct Sidgwick control through both mediums. There does\nnot appear to be much significance in the content of the\nmessages. The fact of Mrs. Sidgwick having gone abroad was\nprobably known to both ladies. She was not, however, then\nengaged on a Life of her husband, but was getting ready for\npublication some of his posthumous works. Still, she had had\nunder consideration the eventual preparation of a Life. More\nover, though the references to the writing of the Life are\nnot in themselves evidential, the independent reference to the\nsame subject in the trance-utterance of two mediums on the\nsame day is not without interest. In Miss Rawson's case it\nappears to have been, if not the only, at any rate the chief\nsubject of the trance-utterance. In the case of Mrs. Thompson\nthe utterance of the direct Sidgwick control was confined to\nanswering questions put by myself ; but Mr. D., who followed\nthe Sidgwick control, conveyed two messages which he gave\nme to understand were volunteered by the soi-disant Henry\nSidgwick ; namely the one quoted above about \" Eleanor's\nwriting his Life!' and another to this effect : \" He wants to\nknow if Robin has gone with Eleanor\u2014his wife, you know \" ;\n\" gone \" meaning obviously \" gone abroad.\" Of the two volun\nteered messages, therefore, one was directly and the other\nindirectly concerned with the same subject as was the only\nrecorded utterance of the Sidgwick control through Miss\nRawson. If the utterances of these two mediums are only\nthe outcome of self-suggestion, I find it difficult to understand\nwhat prompted them both to hit on this particular topic, a\ntopic which, so far as I cau judge, was not very likely to\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena- in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 299\ncommend itself to either, whether from an evidential, an\nemotional, or a dramatic point of view.\nThe coincidence between the extracts from the sittings of\nJanuary 21st and of January 23rd is plain. As Miss Kawson's\nsitting on January 23rd was the first after Mrs. Thompson's on\nJanuary 21st, it will be seen that the same spirit takes the\nearliest opportunity to repeat through a second medium a\nstatement very similar to that already made through a first.\nIn my transcript of the Sidgwick script I have put a query\nagainst the word \" waiting \" : but I may remark that I had\nthus deciphered the word more than three years before I saw\nor knew of the existence of the notes of Miss Rawson's sittings.\nSuch coincidence then as there may be I have not manu\nfactured ; nor has the recorder of Miss Rawson's utterances,\nfor he had not seen my record until I saw his. The\nexpression \" the circle above \" strikes one as odd ; but Mr.\nMyers used to refer to Mr. 1)., Mr. Gurney, and others as\n\" the governing group \" in Mrs. Thompson's case, and in this\ngroup Mr. I), played a prominent rdle ; so if we take \" the\ncircle above \" as an equivalent to \" the governing group,\" there\nis a correspondence between the two statements : \" The circle\nabove has been waiting for him \" and \" Mr. D. was waiting for\nhim.\" But I do not really think that between these two\nphrases there is a real agreement. The natural meaning of\nthe \" circle above has been waiting for him, and will with\ngreat joy welcome him \" is that \" the circle above, of which\nI, Henry Sidgwick, am one, has been and still is waiting to\ngreet Myers \" ; whereas \" Mr. D. was waiting for him \" implies\nthat Mr. D, is no longer waiting because he has now met him.\nWith regard to the correspondence between the utterances\nand script of January 26 th, 1901, and those of January 29 th\nand 30th, 1901, I would observe: that, though the statement\nmade by the Sidgwick control through Miss Eawson, \" He\n(i.e. Myers) has sent a message to the other side (i.e. Mrs.\nThompson) \" is not strictly borne out by the facts, it can be\nreconciled with the facts in a natural way.\nThus, one of Miss Eawson's controls on January 26th, says\nthat Mr. Myers \" has sent a message to Mrs. Thompson.\" No\nmessage purporting to come from Mr. Myers was, however, given\nthrough Mrs. Thompson till January 29th; but be it observed\n\f300 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nJanuary 29th was the first occasion after January 21st (and\ntherefore also after January 26th) on which Mrs. Thompson\nwent into trance. Mr. Sidgwick may therefore he supposed to\nhave seized on January 29th the first opportunity to deliver\na message given him by Mr. Myers before January 26th; the\ncontrol of Miss Rawson, in speaking of the message as having\nbeen sent, may be supposed either to have meant only that\nMr. Myers had then on January 26th entrusted a message to\nMr. Sidgwick for future delivery and not to have meant to\nstate positively that it had been delivered : or this control\nmay, unaware of no opportunity having occurred for the\ndelivery of the message through Mrs. Thompson, be supposed\nto have taken the will for the deed and concluded that the\nmessage had already been delivered.\nThe utterances most closely resembling one another are\nthose given on January 11th. Besides this it is difficult to see\nwhat common train of phantasy could have led two mediums\nto agree in confining their references to one spirit (Mr.\nSidgwick) to messages about and from him from other spirits\nfor more than four months after his death, and then to agree in\nrepresenting this spirit as directly controlling them on one and\nthe same day ; whereas they let a post-mortem interval of but\n9 days in one case and 13 days in another elapse before\nanother spirit (Mr. Myers) communicates directly : (for the\nsignature F. W. H. Myers in Mrs. Thompson's script of January\n^,0th must be regarded as intended to imply the direct\npersonal operation of Mr. Myers).\nOr, again, what led both to agree in representing that up to a\ncertain date a spirit A. has not met a spirit B. in the spirit\nworld, and after that led one medium (Miss Rawson) to repre\nsent B. as directly speaking, and the other (Mrs. Thompson) to\nstate that A. has met B. and to represent B. as writing directly ?\nThe words \" Myers North, etc.,\" followed by the signature\nF. W. H. Myers, involve a contradiction, for they were un\ndoubtedly intended to convey that Mr. Myers' consciousness\nwas pre-occupied elsewhere (i.e. in the north of England), and\nthat therefore he could not manifest then through Mrs. Thomp\nson, and yet the next minute the signature of the absent spirit\nis written. Superficially, at least, there is a confusion here, yet\nthe case is not unparalleled, and not inconsistent with similar\n\fxlvii.] Phenomena in Mrs. Thompson's Trance. 301\n(see pp. 164-5, 244-5 ; and cf. p. 236) incongruities observable\nelsewhere in Mrs. Thompson's trance-drama\u2014e.g. in the case of\nNelly and Geoffrey Scott. But if I am right in my interpreta\ntion of the order in which the script of January 30th should be\nread, it would appear that when once the Myers' signature has\nbeen written the Sidgwick control is aware of his presence.\nSitting of January 11th, 1901.\nNelly :\u2014\" Mr. Gurney went and talked to Miss Kawson. He\ndoesn't even mind knocking a table for her.\"\nSo far as I can discover only two references occur about\nthis time to Edmund Gurney in the records of Miss Eawson's\ntrance-phenomena. On December 23rd, 1900, i.e. nearly\n3 weeks before Nelly's statement was made, one of Miss\nRawson's controls said : \" Gurney is here,\" and \" Edmund\nGurney is here now ; he is too high to speak.\" On February\n7th, 1901, nearly four weeks after Nelly's statement, Miss\nRawson in trance saw the form of Edmund Gurney, who\ncenversed with her by waving his hand as she repeated the\nletters of the alphabet, and afterwards directly controlled her.\nObviously the value of such coincidence as there is depends\nupon whether Mrs. Thompson knew that a Gurney control\noccasionally manifested through Miss Rawson.\nA letter which I received from Miss Rawson, dated\nOctober 20th, 1903, which was written in answer to my\nrequest for information on the points involved, makes it clear\nthat it would not have been by any means a safe statement\nto make at random that a Gurney control had been mani\nfesting through Miss Rawson, and incidentally it also makes it\npractically certain that Mrs. Thompson did not know that\nMr. Myers had had some sittings with Miss Rawson in\nDecember, 1900 (see pp. 207-8).\nMiss Rawson's letter is as follows :\u2014\nAs far as I can remember, Edmund Gurney has been to us several\ntimes for many years, but only ever when Mr. Myers was \"sitting\"\nwith us, and no notes were taken, as Mr. Myers considered every\nthing said to him by Mr. Gurney as most confidential, and asked us\nnever to speak about it to any one ; but I know that Mr. Myers\nhimself was absolutely satisfied. I believe \u25a0 the last tiicn we ever had\n\f302 [part\nJ. G. Piddington.\nanything from Mr. Gurney was in December 1900, [This is not the\ncase, as I have seen records of sittings with Miss Rawson, in which\na Gurney control appeared on two occasions, in February 1901 ; but\nit is noticeable that on each of these two occasions his utterances\nwere confined to speaking about Mr. Myers.\u2014J.

Myers would be at Valescure, as we went\nout there quite suddenly. . . .\nI cannot remember if Edmund Gurney ever tilted the table, but.\n1 almost think so.\nStanding by itself this incident would be worth little or\nnothing ; but it must not be considered apart from the other\ncorrespondences described above and in the section on Nelly's\nperegrinations, and especially not apart from other coincidental\nstatements made about Mr. Gurney at the sitting of January\n11th, 1901, which I now proceed to quote.\nMrs. Thompson and Mrs. Scott.\nSitting of January 8th, 1901.

I had written it, of course, before your\nletter came ; but I do not as a rule like speaking of any messages\nreceived in this way, as they can be of little use as evidence. Some\ntime ago I had a very urgent message from both Mr. Gurney and\nmy son, telling me the latter could not \"sit\" [i.e. control at a sitting]\nwith you ; but I felt it best to disregard it. I am glad I did, for\nit is interesting that it should have been verified in this way.\nMrs. Scott wrote to me on July 17th, 1903, as follows:\nI am sorry to say that I do not keep a journal, and I have no\nrecord of the script you speak of. I wish it had more evidential\nvalue. I remember at the time thinking the message too valueless\nto be worth sending you, and I left it in the book I was reading until\nyour letter came asking for it. I have only my own recollections to\ngive you now, which, of course, are worth little ; but I give them as\nyou may have my letter written at the time [i.e. the letter, quoted\nabove, of January 12th, 1901] to compare them with. I had been in\nLondon a few days before. I think you came to see me, and we\nhad a sitting with Mrs. Thompson together\u2014an unsuccessful one\ncomparatively. [Mrs. Scott's recollections I can confirm.\u2014J. G. P.]\nOn the day I received the message I went out hunting, starting\n\f304 [PAliT\nJ. G.

I had a strong\nimpulse to write almost directly, and I took a scrap of paper and\ntried the experiment without leaving my chair. The result was the\nmessage I sent you. Seeing that there was nothing \" evidential \" in\nit, and feeling great repugnance to sending you any suggestions about\nwork which you must feel were an impertinence unless they were\nattested as coming from a source beyond myself, I slipped the paper\nbetween the pages of the book I was reading, and meant to take\nno further notice of it. Besides the message it was scribbled over,\nas almost all my script is, with half messages and words, purporting\nto come from my son ; and was destroyed when the copy was\nmade.\nThis happened before tea : which fixes the time as before 4.30 p.m.\nAt 9 p.m. your letter came with the coffee after dinner. I did not\ndate the copy, I suppose because I give its history in the letter I\nwrote enclosing it. I feel sure I must have written, because the in\ncident impressed me. I knew the first quiet moment had been taken\nadvantage of, and it seemed to me even more interesting than if the\ntime had corresponded to Mrs. Thompson's trance : which it obviously\ndid not do.\nI do not know if Mrs. Thompson knew normally of my writing\npurporting to come from E. G. I do not know what Mr. Myers\nmay have told her about me. But in one of my sittings with her\nshe gave me in trance a long message purporting to be from E. G.;\nindeed she was \" controlled \" by him.\n. . . The chief fact about the message which impressed me was\nthat a message had purported to be for you (which was a new ex\nperience), and that \" Nelly \" had told you before it came that there\nwould be one. [\"Mr. Gurney did\" (not will) \"write a message\"\nwere Nelly's actual words.] Also this was a solitary experience to\nthe best of my belief. I have not had any other message sent direct\nto you ; and I had no reason to expect one.\nI am leaving out of account Nelly's statement that \" Geoffrey\ndid write and explain to his mother after she went home the\nreason why he was so vexed,\" because though it appears to\nI I venture to direct the attention of a certain Continental school of psycho-\nphysiologists to the fact that we produce here in England a fox-hunting type\nof automatic writer.

The sitting was bad, and the Geoffrey Scott\ncontrol appeared to be vexed, and as Nelly was apparently\naware that Mrs. Scott received automatic messages from her\nson, she might readily have surmised that he would explain\nthe cause of his vexation to his mother.\nBut I cannot regard Nelly's statement, \" Mr. Gurney did\nwrite a long message. Mrs. Scott received a long message\nfor you from Mr. Gurney \" as due to a lucky guess. It is true\nthat at the time that Nelly spoke, and spoke in the past\ntense, the message had not been written by Mrs. Scott ; but,\nas I have suggested in the foregoing instance, Nelly may have\ntaken the intention for the deed, or the message may have\nbeen already \" delivered,\" and have been lying latent in Mrs.\nScott's subconsciousness until a favourable opportunity occurred\nfor it to emerge.\nOr again ; it will be noticed that after Nelly had said that\nMr. Gurney had sent a message to me through Mrs. Scott, I\nasked the Mr. D. control if Edmund Gurney knew about the\nscreening of the sitter from the medium, and got the reply :\n\" He doesn't understand ; but I'll tell him and he'll write.\"\n(I should explain here that Nelly's statement that Mr.\nGurney had written me a message through Mrs. Scott did\nnot suggest the question that I put to Mr. D. I much\ndoubt if when I asked the question I remembered anything\nabout Nelly's statement. At the very beginning of the sit\nting I had asked Nelly to fetch Edmund Gurney. I had\nnever seen this control, and the only reason why I wanted it\nto appear was in order to give a message to it entrusted to\nme by another person.)\nNow the message written by Mrs. Scott, which purported\nto come from Edmund Gurney for me, began in this way :\u2014\n\" I wish you to tell Piddington that I see his point ; but\nthere is danger of losing the light.\"\nTins reads like an answer to my question addressed to Mr.\nD : \" Does Edmund Gurney know about the screen ? \", and\nunless it was an answer to this question about the screen,\nthe words have no significance for me, as I had not submitted\nany other point to the Gurney control. Mrs. Scott knew\nnothing of my having put this question, nor of my having\n\f30(5 [l\\YltT\nJ. G.

Even now Mrs. Scott\ndoes not know about my question and Mr. D.'s reply.\nAt first sight, if the opening words of Mrs. Scott's message\nare taken to refer to what passed between Mr. D. and\nmyself at the sitting of January 11th, it seems inconsistent\nwith the view that Nelly's words can also be referred to the\nsame message, and also to the hypothesis that Nelly may\nhave been justified in speaking of the Gurney message in\nthe past tense ; but I think it conceivable that the script\nwritten by Mrs. Scott on January 12th, the day after the\nsitting, may represent an amalgam of a message received by\nher subconsciousness some time before Nelly's statement was\nmade, and remaining latent, with a second message impressed on\nher mind after Mr. 1). had said that he would tell Edmund\nGurney about the screen, and that he (E. G.) would write.\nI knew that Mrs. Scott did automatic writing, but I did\nnot know that some of it was supposed to come from the\nlate Mr. Gurney. I had never seen any of her script, and\nnothing was further from my thoughts than that she should\nsend me a message purporting to come from Edmund Gurney,\nor any one else, for that matter.\nSince January 12th, 1901, up to the present date (October\n16th, 1903), Mrs. Scott has not written, or at least has not sent\nme, any other message addressed to me either by Edmund\nGurney or any other control. The message written by Mrs. Scott\non January 12th, 1901, consisted of 16o words, and, judging\nfrom the average length of Mrs. Scott's and others' automatic\nscript, it was perhaps correctly described as a \" long \" message.\nI have now recorded every instance 1 that has occurred in\n1 The E. H. Percival control claimed to have tried to send a message (auto\nmatically written) through his aunt, but as he at the same time said that he\nwas aware of having failed, I have not thought it necessary to include this\ninstance. It was true, anil I believe unknown to Mrs. Thompson, that the\naunt writes automatic script which purports to come from her nephew. On\none other occasion Nelly arranged a test experiment ! She wrote down a mes\nsage and told me to keep it hidden, and said that on a certain day E. H. Percival\nwould write the same message through his aunt. The aunt obtained a few\nwords, but they did not tally with what Nelly had written.\n\fxlvii ] Phenomena in Mrs. Tfiompson's Trance. 307\nthe series of sittings under consideration where acquain\ntance has been claimed with phenomena occurring through\nmediums other than Mrs. Thompson, and in only one case\u2014\nNelly and Elsie's visit to Mrs. Piper\u2014is there no corre\nspondence.\nThe resemblances quoted above are far from complete ;\nthey are suggestive rather than indicative of supernormal\nagency ; yet I cannot ascribe them to chance. If they are\nnot supernormal, I would attribute them to the minds of\nboth automatists having developed from similar data in their\ncommon possession similar fantasies, accordant with the general\ntrend of ideas that runs through spiritistic manifestations.\nBut at least I claim for them serious study, for could we be\nfortunate enough (and I am rather sanguine that we may . be)\nto multiply analogous and more clinching instances of the\nsame phenomenon, it would open up one of the most promis\ning lines for observation, and even perhaps for experimentation.\n\f308 [part\nJohn Honeyman.\nII.\nON CERTAIN UNUSUAL PSYCHOLOGICAL\nPHENOMENA.\nBy John Honeyman, R.S.A.\nThe following account of certain hallucinations or illusions\nwill be valuable to many psychologists, both because the\nappearances themselves were characterised by several unusual\nfeatures, and also because the subject affected was free from\nany physiological or morbid condition likely to affect his\nnatural powers of observation or his intellectual equilibrium.\nHe was thus able to recognise the nature of the appearances\nand calmly to note the various points of interest in the\nappearances themselves and the circumstances connected with\nthem.\nThe subject, whom we shall call Mr. A., was a gentleman\nnearly 70 years of age, whose left eye, destroyed by glaucoma\nabout thirty years previously, was excised about three years and a\nhalf ago and whose right eye, slightly myopic, was defective.\nIt would be interesting to know in connection with what is\nto follow what was the exact nature of the defect in the right\neye, but various oculists of eminence, who had been consulted,\ndiffered in their opinion, and we may therefore take it that\nthe case was somewhat complicated. The media of the eye\nremained perfectly clear, the extent of the field of vision was\nnormal and remained unrestricted. The eye was defective, chiefly\nin the visual axis, where, within an area defined by an angle\nof about 30\u00b0, the sight was obscured as if by a thick mist\n(relative scotoma), while outside this limit the obscuration was\nnot nearly so dense. We may add that the tension of the eye\n\fxlvIi.] 309\nOn Certain Psychological Phenomena.\n(about 2T) was successfully kept in check and about normal\nby the use of eserine.\nIn April, 1900, Mr. A., walking on a country road, saw on\nhis left a new rubble wall brightly illuminated by the sun,\nand to his amazement he saw it perfectly distinctly. He could\nsee every separate stone and the mortar joints surrounding it,\nthe smooth faces of the water-worn boulders, and the texture\nof stones broken to form a face. In particular he was struck\nwith the frequent recurrence of broken granite stones, in which\nhe could distinctly see the hornblend, the felspar, and the\nquartz and mica reflecting the sun's rays. Indeed, he thought\nhe had never been able to see a wall so minutely before while\npassing it. He did seem to be passing it quite in a natural\nway, but presently coming to a part of the road where he\nknew there was no wall, but only an iron railing on a low\nparapet, and finding the wall still there and no railing visible,\nit occurred to him that he might see this wall just as well if\nhe shut his eyes altogether, and on doing so he found this to\nbe the case : the wall was still there, with the sun shining\non it as brightly as ever.\nFinding that his available sight was greatly interfered with\nby the intrusion of this subjective sight, he had to give up his\nintention of going further and return home. The wall shortly\nafterwards disappeared, but a great variety of other images\nappeared at frequent intervals throughout the day. These all\nshowed two characteristics, brightness (amounting almost to\nluminosity), and distinctness\u2014not the slightest trace of the\nhaze affecting the natural sight being observable. The image\nmost frequently recurring (though with infinite variations) was\na surface decorated with groups of flowers. Sometimes these\nflowers were painted, sometimes embroidered, but in every case\nthe minutest details were distinctly seen, even to the stitches\nof the embroidery. Minor changes were constantly occurring ;\nfor example, the different groups were sometimes connected\nwith one another by cords of various designs ; at first of silk,\na cord would gradually change to plush, with all the colours\nof the rainbow shining brightly on it ; then it would be trans\nformed to gold or silver and assume the form of a serpent\ncovered with gold scales. Then suddenly dozens of these\nserpents would be seen, with heads erect and jewels flashing\n\f310 [part\nJohn Muneyman.\nfrom their eyes. They were standing out in relief, perhaps for\nabout a third of their length, but gradually the mouth opened\nwide and the eye cavity became empty, and the whole thing\nwas seen to be merely a thin skin of metal.\nIn such cases the drawing of the empty head was, like\neverything else, perfect, and so was the perspective of the\nprotruding coils. Sometimes these serpents were pure white\nwith round red spots all over them at regular intervals, and\nat other times white with black spots, but they were never\ncoloured \" proper.\" Occasionally a human head gradually\nemerged from a flower and developed to life size, and then\nthe rest of the picture vanished. In that case the head was\nperfectly natural in colour and in every other respect\u2014it was\nsimply impossible to distinguish it from an actual living\nhead ; it had every appearance of being substantial and\ntangible. After a brief interval it gradually changed ; at first\na perfectly proportioned and beautiful head, sometimes male\nand sometimes female\u2014\" never the head of any one Mr. A.\nhad ever seen \"\u2014it began to get withered and contorted and\nwrinkled, and finally, as a rule, disappeared as if smothered\nin the innumerable frills of a cap, which kindly hid it from\nview.\nSuch appearances continued at intervals for several days,\nand did not recur, except on one or two isolated occasions,\ntill June, 1901, when Mr. A. was again visited by experiences\nsimilar to those of the previous year, extending over several\nconsecutive days. The appearances were generally similar to\nthose already described, only the designs were frequently\nmore elaborate and elegant, and the harmonious combinations\nof brilliant colours more remarkable. There was one new\ntype of image, however, which must be noted, namely, the\ncomplete human form, which appeared repeatedly under the\nfollowing circumstances.\nOn the first occasion, when hurrying along a quiet street\ntowards a railway station, Mr. A. suddenly checked his pace\nand said to his companion, \" Don't keep me so close to her,\nrather get in front. I was nearly on her skirt.\" He was\ntold that there was no one in front of him and no woman\nvisible at the time on the same pavement. What Mr. A.\nsaw as distinctly as anything he had ever seen in his life\n\fXLviii] On Certain Psychological Phenomena. HI!\n(if not more so) was the figure of a female walking closely\nin front of him, so that he could hardly step out without\ntreading on her skirt. The skirt was of red cloth with\ngroups of white lines (a broad line with two very thin lines\non each side of it) crossing each other at frequent intervals,\nas in a tartan, and over this was a black silk jacket or short\ncloak. The dress was beautifully illuminated with sunlight\nand moved naturally in response to the motion of the figure,\nwhile the light silk jacket was occasionally lifted as if by the\nbreeze. Mr. A. made a motion of putting the skirt out of\nhis way with his umbrella, but of course, as he knew, there\nwas nothing there. Having occasion to cross to the shady\nside of the street, Mr. A. lost sight of the figure for a few\nmoments, but it soon reappeared right in front of him, with\nthe sun still shining on it ; but this time she had changed\nher skirt and wore a rich silk tartan, the prevailing colour\nof which was green. She was seen not very distinctly in the\nbooking-office, and finally disappeared for the day when the\nplatform was reached. This kind of apparition, with differences\nin detail, chiefly in the colour and texture of the clothing,\nhut sometimes also in the fashion of her garments, was seen\nseveral times.\nSubsequently, in November, 1902, on a return of this type\nof hallucination, Mr. A. noticed that the size, which was\nless than natural when the eye was turned towards the\nground, increased as the eye was directed upwards. On this\noccasion the appearance of the female figure was very similar\nin attire, as far as the form was concerned, hut entirely\ndifferent in colour and texture from what it was on the first\noccasion ; besides, when first observed, there was not one\nfigure, as before, but three, and all of them were apparently\nclothed in very rich and lustrous red silk, without any white\nlines upon it, the tone of colour of the figure on the right\nlw?ing several shades darker than those on the left, and it\nmay be milled that, although the day was cloudy, the figures\nwere lighted up by brilliant sunshine, as before. In a few\nminutes after observing the vision, the figure on the extreme\nleft vanished, leaving two only, and for a time these two\nremained, and a change occurred on the dresses, each of them\nbeing divided perpendicularly by a difference in the tone of\nx\n\f312 [PAKT\nJohn Honeyman.\nthe colour, one half\u2014the half on Uie left\u2014being considerably\nlighter than the half on the right. Shortly afterwards the\ncolour of the dress of the figure on the left changed to a\nbluish-purple, and very shortly' after that, that figure also\nvanished and there remained only one figure. After a brief\ninterval the dress of that figure also changed somewhat, and\nwas crossed by lines of white, dividing it into squares of\nabout two inches each way. On that occasion, on entering\nthe house, the other variety of images appeared with very\nmuch the same character as those already described, the\ngroundwork of the images being apparently a very delicately-\ntinted purplish silk texture with a trellis-work of white lines,\non which hung the groups of flowers of rich and varied\ncolouring, and occasionally both the serpent forms with rubies\nfor eyes, and the human heads, which, however, seemed\nmore evanescent, changing rapidly and generally ending in\ngrotesques.\nA circumstance connected with the two kinds of hallucina\ntion exhibited in this case must be noted as very remarkable,\nnamely, the limitation of both varieties within what can only\nbe described as the visual field of the left eye. Hut this\ndifference between the two manifestations was noticeable.\nIn the case of the first variety, the whole visual area was\noccupied by the illuminated trellis-work, which had the\nappearance of being fixed as on a wall. In this respect the\nhallucinations exactly resembled images of external objects\noccupying the right visual field, in that they appeared\nstationary when the position of the field was altered. For\nexample, if the head was turned on its axis from left to\nlight or vice versa, the central subjective image would retain\nits position, and those to the left of it also retaining their position\nwere successively lost as the field moved round, while to\nthe right fresh images appeared, precisely as in ordinary\ncircumstances objects of a similar description do, as, for\nexample, if we look at an iron railing. In the case of the\nsecond variety, the figure always moved along with what\nshould have been the eye. This difference\u2014the apparent\nstability of the one set of subjective images and the mobility\nof the other\u2014leads up quite naturally to the extraordinary\nphenomenon that while the mobile figure always kept out\n\fxlvii.] On Certain Psychological Phenomena. 313\nof A.'s reach, the apparently stationary images-\u2014-the fields\nand fences and walls and trees in a landscape seen by A.\nas he travelled either slowly on foot or rapidly in a train\u2014\ninvariably maintained their proper relationship and per\nspective, changing their relative positions as the objects in\na landscape appear to do. The extraordinary and apparently\ninexplicable thing here is that the images so acting in\nobedience to the laws of perspective had, in fact, no existence,\nexcept within the brain or mind of the observer. We have\nthus one hallucination based on another, the second being\nmuch the more wonderful of the two, as where thfs pheno\nmenon was observed, there were neither green fields, walls,\nnor trees. Perhaps the most remarkable thing in the above\nconnection is that, although both kinds of hallucinations were\nentirely independent of external things, and therefore unre\nstricted by any obstruction calculated to produce the usual\nlimitation of the field, that limitation was still scrupulously\nrespected. The one field overlapped the other, but only to\nthe usual extent.\nThe first observation which the foregoing narrative suggests\nis that the sympathetic action of the two eyes through their\ninnumerable nerves is not so intimate as is generally supposed ;\nfor here we have at the same instant one eye helplessly subject\nto hallucination and the other proof against it, and constantly\nretaining its objective vision. The fact that there is actually no\neye in Mr. A.'s case but only the nervous mechanism of what was\nonce an eye, seems to make it all the more likely that the\nsympathetic influence of the existing eye should prevail, but\nin effect we find that while the physiological conditions affect\nthe sensory nerves on the right side, they have no influence\non the left, either sympathetic or otherwise If we are to\nassume with Professor James, that no visualisation is possible\nwithout the excitation of sensory centres in the cortex, we\nmust, to explain the phenomena exhibited in this case, believe\nthat there exists in connection with the eye a centre of\nhallucination ; but no such centre has been localised by any\nof those who have devoted most attention to this special\nsubject, and if it had been, it is difficult to imagine how any\nstimulus could be conveyed to it through the physical mechanism\nof an organ which had no existence. It is quite evident that\nX2 ' i ..-\n\f314 [part\nJohn Honeyman.\nif we suppose and get to believe in the existence of such a\ncentre, where hallucinations of all kinds in all their complicated\ndetails are manufactured and ready for use, whenever certain\nconditions come into play, we get rid of an immense difficulty,\nwhich, notwithstanding the patient researches of the past half\ncentury, still remains and must do so for ever\u2014or at least\ntill the mystery of Life is solved. In this case, even had\nsuch a hallucinatory centre existed, it is to be observed that\nthe subjective and objective centres were entirely dissociated.\nThe hallucination could not possibly be suggested by anything\nwithin sight of Mr. A., or even by the memory of anything\nhe had ever seen. What he could see at the time was only\nan occasional lamp-post, and a muddy street in the dull light\nof a rainy day. But what he saw at the same moment\nconsisted of the delicately tinted silken robes of a female\nflashing in brightest sunshine.\nThe truth seems to be that subjective visualisation is quite\nindependent of physical mechanism, while still in some degree\naffected by physical conditions. The mind cannot possibly\npresent to itself images of things which have no existence,\nthrough the medium of the senses. Attempts to demonstrate\nthe contrary have failed and must inevitably fail. Such\nmanifestations are entirely spontaneous : they are the creation\nof the mind, and hardly a trace of suggestion is to be found.\nIt may here be observed in passing that this would reasonably\nlead to the inference that hallucinations and dreams have the\nsame ultimate cause, and are indeed practically identical\nphenomena, any difference being due to the interference with\nthe ordinary evolution of perception by a state of dream\nconsciousness.\nIt thus appears that not only do we find nothing in the\ncircumstances related to suggest the existence of a hallucinatory\ncentre, but the fact that the hallucinations observed occupying\nthe left visual field were much more distinct than the objective\nimages in the right field seems rather to favour the view that,\nwhereas the form and colour of objective images are conveyed\nto the mind most distinctly where the brain processes are in\nfull development and vigour, the subjective inventions of the\nmind are most distinctly seen where the physical conditions\nare quite the opposite, where the brain processes are completely\n\fxlvii.] On Certain Psychological Phenomena. 315\ninactive. And hence we may legitimately infer that if the\nmind were entirely freed from its corporeal environment, it\nwould be in the highest degree fitted for the enjoyment of\nhallucinations.\nThe most elaborate systems of nervous distribution and\ncerebral receptivity can never produce sight. The living mind\nalone can do so, using the exquisite physical mechanism at its\ndisposal to modify or define the appearance of external objects,\nnot intuitively but by progressive experience.\nBut it is quite evident that for visions of its own creation,\nsuch physical aids are not required, for without the visualisation\nthe subjective image has no existence, and the creation and\nsimultaneous visualisation are absolutely independent of physical\napparatus, while still in a manner inexplicable, and yet\ninfluenced by physiological or pathological conditions.\nThis view is quite consistent with Parish's theory of dis\nsociated consciousness so far as illusions regarding external\nobjects are concerned, but no further. For we can quite well\nconceive that a current of energy, diverted from its normal\ncourse into an unusual group of distributing nerves, must lead\nto totally unexpected and abnormal results. This is due\nto the mind being misled by the abnormal action of the\nmaterial apparatus, on whose fidelity it has been accustomed\nto rely, but in the case of hallucinations it is not a mere\ndistortion of some object transmitted by the retina to the\nmind diverted from its proper course, as Parish suggests, but\na distinct image visualised apparently without the . aid of any\nphysical mechanism whatever. In fact we may say that\nthe intensity of the visuality in a case of hallucination increases\njust as the energy of supposed material agencies decreases in\npower; thus we have the dreams in ordinary sleep, and in\nthe complete hypnotic state visions more remarkable.\nEven the case before us seems to favour this, for the\nreason why the subjective images seen in daylight are so\nremarkably distinct and bright probably is that the organ\nof vision is entirely absent.\nIf as Parish admits {Hallucinations and Illusions ; by Edmund\nParish : English translation, London, Walter Scott, Ltd., p. 148)\na perception is possible without an objective basis, the fact\ngreatly strengthens the view that in the case of pure hal\n\f316 [part\nJohn Homyman.\nlucinatioiis the mind takes the initiative and acts and visualises\nits subjective images without the intervention of the sensory\nsystem at all.1\nFurther, if it be granted that the elaborate researches of\nBinet and others, who have specially devoted themselves to\nthe study of the mechanism of the brain, have established\nthe fact that there exist cerebral centres communicating directly\nwith the organs of sight, hearing, etc., by countless nerves\nadapted to the purpose and even that there are separate\ncentres for the retention of every different kind of sensation,\nit must after all be left to the imagination to discover how\nthe complex mechanism can be made to serve the ordinary\npurposes of the human intellect by any combination of physical\nmeans ; for example, to enable the mind to perceive an\nexternal object, by transmitting through the retina a correct\nimage. It could not be recognised unless the visual centre\nwere put into immediate communication with the visual\nmemory centre and so on.\nAnd even if we grant that the perfect working of this\nphysical mechanism is possible, it can hardly be so if it is\nin any measure thrown out of gear. In view of the infinite\ncomplexity of the nerve system suggested here, Hoppe's theory\nthat visuality is produced by a physical substance being pro\njected from the retina through the nerve tracks to the\nsensory centres of the cortex seems hardly worthy of con\nsideration and in fact is disproved by the condition in Mr. A.'s\ncase.\nHoppe's words are:\u2014\n\" This hallucination matter, which is either hallucina\ntion itself or the raw material of hallucination, must,\nas it is something physical, occupy some place and\nthis place is assigned to it in the retina itself.\" (See\nHallucinations and Mv&ions, by Edmund Parish, Eng. trans,\np. 172.)\nNow in A.'s case no retina existed, and if Hoppe's localisa\ntion be correct, no such physical substance existed either. On\n1 For discussions of this point, see the chapter on ' ' Hallucinations \" in\nPhantasms of the Living, (Vol. I., Chap. X.,) and the section on the \" Physiology\nof Hallucinations \" in the \" Report on the Census of Hallucinations \" (Proceeding*\nS.P.R. Vol. X., pp. 134-148).\u2014Ed.\n\fxlvil] 317\nOn Certain Psychological Phenomena.\nthe other hand, the more intelligible theory of Parish\u2014the\ntheory of dissociation\u2014as to the cause of hallucinations appears\nto be inadequate and indeed inconsistent with observed facts,\nfor if dissociation occurs through the haphazard increase or\ndiminution of tension in certain groups of elements, the\nresult would be, not the production of a recognisable image,\nbut an inextricable confusion of images, and the hypothetical\ntheory could not possibly account for the phenomena referred\nto towards the beginning of the narrative (p. 313 ante) where\none hallucination apparently is superimposed on another with\nperfect and invariable consistency.\nI have used the term hypothetical, as it seems to be\nappropriate in this case : and hence another reason for re\njecting Parish's theory of dissociation, for stimulus cannot\nexist without a cause and in this case no physical cause\ncan be found. Under normal conditions, the existing cause\nof visual sensations is from without, through the medium of\nthe retina ; but in this case where there is no retina the\nstimulus, if such exists, must obviously come from within.\nThe theory of sight through physical agencies is intelligible,\nbut it must be remembered that the proper use of that\nagency has to be learned : it is not intuitive. But the\nacquisition of the power correctly to visualise a hallucination\nrequires no such education : it is therefore intuitive\u2014if we\ncan use such a term, and if its use be ever legitimate it\nseems to be in a case such as this, because it is evident\nthat in the case of hallucination, conception, visualisation and\nperception occur simultaneously. This is a distinction of\nconsiderable importance in any attempt to trace its origin.\nAs we have already seen, there is no evidence of any\nsympathetic co-operation between the right eye and the\nremaining nerve connections of the left. This complete\nabsence of any evidence of sympathetic action (in connection\nwith vision at least) must be regarded as one of the most\ninteresting peculiarities of the case.\nIt is as if we had two entirely independent sides in the\nsame individual\u2014the visual field on the left side, when\noccupied at all, invariably filled with images purely sub\njective, while that on the right is simultaneously and invariably\nfilled with objective images, except when under the influence\n\f318 [part\nJohn Honcyman.\nof sleep. There is one phenomenon which could not be\nobserved except in such a case as this, where we may\nregard the two fields as entirely separate from each other,\nand that is the struggle for supremacy where the two fields\noverlap. Here the right side, even though abnormally dim,\nhas invariably the best of it ; external objects are seen,\nthough faintly, through the more luminous and perfect repre\nsentation of the subjective images. On no occasion has\nhallucination occupied the right visual field, except to the\npoint already indicated, where it is overlapped, but not\nobliterated, by a part of the hallucination of the left side.\nIt has always been possible to see external objects through\nthe hallucination even at that point. This is another signi\nficant indication that these independent sensations spring from\ntwo totally distinct sources.\nOur case undoubtedly exhibits two kinds of perception,\nessentially different, never showing the least tendency to com\nbine, but each maintaining its prerogative within its own\nnatural province, even within the limited area where the\nboundaries overlap. But whereas any opaque substance, such\nas a thin sheet of metal, held in front of the right eye\nput an end to the vision there, such obstruction on the left\nside made no difference whatever, and the vision was as bright\nwhen both eyes were shut as when open. Or, again, if the\nobstruction were placed in front of and with its edge on\nthe centre of the nose, it at once cut off the images on the\nleft section of the right visual field, but it had no effect\nwhatever on the corresponding right section of the field ;\nimages there remained as distinct as ever, as might have been\nexpected.\nThe intuitive perception of what never existed cannot be\nproduced by any physiological process. It may possibly in\nsome measure be modified by individual idiosyncrasies or\npathological conditions, but it is a purely psychical phenomenon.\nEven James seems to admit that hallucinations are beyond\nthe hitherto recognised limits of mental science ; when quoting\nthe dictum of Locke, he says :\n\" Locke's main doctrine remains eternally true, however\nhazy some of his language may have been, that, though\nthere may be a great number of considerations wherein\n\fxlvIi.] 319\nOn Certain Psychological Phenomena.\nthings may be compared one with another, and so a\nmultitude of relations, yet they all terminate in, and\nare concerned about, those simple ideas either of sensa\ntion or reflection, which I think to be the whole\nmaterials of all our knowledge. The simple ideas we\nreceive from sensation and reflection are the boundaries\nof our thoughts, beyond which the mind, whatever efforts\nit would make, is not able to advance one jot; nor\ncan it make any discoveries when it would pry into the\nnature and hidden causes of those ideas.\" (See Principle\nof Psychology, by William James, Vol. II., p. 6.)\nIt does not however follow that because mental science\nwith Locke's limitations cannot fathom the mystery of halluci\nnations, the mind itself is unable to do so, or even that it\ncannot create what it is unable to explain. The pure, spon\ntaneous invention would, we should think, be an easier\nachievement than the successful manipulation of the compli\ncated physical machinery slightly out of gear, which Parish\nsupposes to be at its disposal for the purpose. But as we\nhave seen, Parish himself admits the possibility of perception\nwithout physical basis, and the experience of Mr. A. seems\nstrongly to confirm this view.\nIt may here be noticed that during tiie existence of\nhallucination the will appears to be entirely inoperative, for\nas Mr. A. pursued his way along the lonely street with his\nphantom female before him, he wished with all his strength\nof will that she would get behind him or vanish, but she did\nneither till she thought proper herself and then without any\nconscious wish on his part. This would seem to indicate\nthat while objective vision is subject to physical conditions,\nsubjective vision is not only independent of these, but is also\nindependent of at least one important element of mind,\nnamely, the will, which was exercised in vain, either to stop\nhallucination or to modify it to the extent that the images\nseen, and especially the visages seen, should bear some\nresemblance to others which Mr. A. had seen before. In no\ninstance was the wish gratified or the will otherwise able\nto assert itself throughout the whole series of hallucinations.\nOf course one instance will not establish a fact any more\nthan one witness, but these circumstances seem well worthy\n\f320 [PART\nJohn ffoneyman.\nof notice, as the opportunities for making such observations\nare of rare occurrence.\nIt may perhaps be thought that the state of matters dis\nclosed in this case tends to confirm Professor James' theory of\nthe duality of the mind, but a still greater than James has\nsaid that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways :\nand in view of the interdependence and necessary co-operation\nof the mind's various constituents\u2014irrespective of sight\u2014in\nthe production of even one conception, even a modern psycho\nlogist may be prepared to admit that it would be impossible\nalways to prevent conflict along the frontier line of the two\nprovinces, and that you could not anticipate as a result an\nevenly balanced mind. But why stop at duality ? All\nanalogy and the whole organisation of things animate and\ninanimate should lead us to anticipate that the constitution\nof the mind should lie exceedingly complex, with a variety\nand subtlety of detail which must for ever defy analysis and\nremain, like the omnipresent source of all, for ever\nunsearchable.\nNo doubt the fact that the mind, by an effort of the will\nand the aid of memory, can recall perceptions with such\nexactness that the hand may accurately portray them, although\nthe mind remains unable to visualise them, seems rather to\nfavour Parish's view that certain physiological conditions are\nnecessary to account for visualisation. But on the other\nhand, if the mind aided by these forces cannot visualise\nperceptions founded on actual sensations transmitted by the\nordinary channels of communication with external things, how\nmuch less can it achieve this result\u2014the excitation of the\nhypothetical stimulus of the sensory nerves\u2014without the aid\nof either memory or the will (which at least in some cases of\nhallucination appears to be dormant) ! The supposition that it\ndoes, brings us face to face with the alternative that instead of\nthe mind creating hallucinations, they are created by only\none element of mind, viz., the imagination, capable of inde\npendent action and localised in a certain set of nerve\ncentres. In short, that what we designate mind is not a\ndistinct entity, but a complex confederation, the component\nparts of which, though closely related, have each, not merely\na separate function, but also a separate habitat within the\n\fXLVM.] 321\nOn Certain Psyehological Phenomena.\nbrain's periphery. But even if we were to go this length,\nthe impenetrable mystery of how the imagination gets hold\nof its various subjective images and applies the corresponding\nstimulus to the particular nerve track, shunting it oft' at\nthe proper switch to a process of irradiation, capable of pro\nducing the desired effect, although not the course intended\nby the imagination ;\u2014all this, we say, would remain a mystery,\nunsolved and insoluble.\nThe most important conclusion to which the narrative\nrelated above points, appears to be that the sources from\nwhich objective vision and hallucinatory vision spring are\n\u2022essentially different and independent. The first is initiated\nby external stimuli, acting on the sensory mechanism of the\nbrain, resulting in a definite sensation which the individual\nperceives, and which we call sight, while the second cannot\nJ,e called a sensation, as the sensory physical apparatus cannot\nbe influenced by what has no existence, and there appears\nto be no chance of the intervention of the ordinary processes\nof sensation, as the hallucination is not only perceived but\nconceived at the same instant, while the machinery of sensa\ntion is simultaneously fully occupied by objective excitations,\nand where there is no energy there can be no physical\naction. The source of hallucinatory vision therefore must\nbe within, and must be regarded as a purely spiritual\nprocess.\nNote.\n[The following note on Mr. A.'s case has kindly been\ncontributed by a Member of our Society and well-known oculist,\nMr. J. Mackenzie Davidson, M.B., CM., (Aberd).]\nMr. John Honeyman's communication on certain unusual\nPsychological Phenomena is very interesting, the more so since\nthe observations are so accurately recorded. The salient point\nthat strikes one is that while the phenomena are purely\nsubjective, yet in certain respects, eg. in the change of size of\nthe images seen, they varied as if the visual impressions had\nbeen produced by external objects.\nIt must he remembered that what is seen, in the sense of\nthe mind forming a conception of the size, shape, and colour\n\f?>22 John Homyman.\nof objects, is due to a variety of impulses co-ordinated to produce\nthe final mental impression. To illustrate this there is no-\nbetter way than to produce on the eyes a good after-image,\n\u2014say of the incandescent filament of an electric lamp,\nviewed at a distance of a foot : and if then the after-image is\nreproduced on a screen held a foot from the eyes, the apparent\nsize of the after-image will be exactly the same size as the\noriginal object (the filament) which produced it. But if the\nscreen be gradually taken further away, the after-image will\nincrease in size, and if one looks at the sky or any distant\nobject, the image will have increased enormously, lit this way\nthe after-image can be made to appear J inch long or 20 feet\nlong according to the position of the eyeballs. In this case\nthe impression produced on the retinae is of a fixed size and\nunalterable, and the impression on the centre for vision of\nthe retinae must also be unalterable ; but, and this is the\npoint of importance, the mental conception of the actual size\nby the higher visual centre is modified by the position of the\naxes of the eyeballs, whether they are convergent or parallel.\nIt is therefore conceivable that the phenomena recorded in\nMr. Honeyman's paper may be partly explained by the position\nof the eyes and head, etc., for it is recorded \" Mr. A. noticed\nthat the size, which was less than natural when the eye was\nturned towards the ground, increased as the eye was directed\nupwards.\" This is exactly what would happen with an after\nimage.\n.Ias.

F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nJanuary 29th, 1904.\nMy first duty is to thank you most heartily for the honour\nyou have conferred upon me to-day. When I recall the names\nof the illustrious men who have preceded me in this chair, I\ncan only ask your indulgence for the deficiencies of which I am\nvery conscious and express the hope that our Society may not\nsuffer from having chosen as its President one from a remote\ndistance, and who can lay no claim to the eminence of his\npredecessors.\nIt has not been the custom formally to move a vote of\nthanks to our out-going President, but I am sure you would\ndesire me to voice the grateful appreciation, which we all\nsincerely feel, of the great services which Sir Oliver Lodge has\nrendered to the Society during his three years' tenure of office.\nIn his presence I cannot express all I would like to say, but\nthis much perhaps he will permit, that during his Presidency,\nhis influence and high position in the ranks of science have\nbeen of inestimable value to the Society, whilst his simple and\nunaffected courage has been a noble stimulus to us all.\nY\n\f324 [part\nAddress by the President,\nHere too, perhaps, you will allow me to say how much we\nowe to the ungrudging and arduous labour of our Hon. Sec. Mr.\nPiddington, and to the skill and care with which our Hon.\nTreasurer Mr. H. A. Smith has, almost from the foundation of\nthe Society, conducted its finances, and to the legal advice and\nassistance, in the incorporation of the Society and other matters,\nwhich Mr. Smith and Mr. S. C. Scott have freely given to us.\nThough I am quite sure they would deprecate any allusion to\ntheir services, yet I know you will join with me in expressing\nour most grateful and cordial thanks to each and all of these\ngentlemen.\nThis month we enter upon the 23rd year of our existence, and\nin spite of the irreparable losses we have suffered in the past\nthrough the removal from this life of those who seemed to be\nthe very pillars on which the Society rested,\u2014Gurney, Sidgwick,\nMyers,\u2014losses which naturally gave rise to many gloomy fore\nbodings\u2014nevertheless we have no reason for despondency, on\nthe contrary the present flourishing condition of our Society far\nexceeds that which even I, the most sanguine of its founders,\ncould have anticipated. Both numerically and financially we\nare stronger than we have at any time been; the number of\nour Members and Associates throughout the United Kingdom,\nafter eliminating all losses through death, etc., is 832 ; in\naddition we have 530 Members and Associates in the American\nBranch, and on the Continent kindred societies are springing up.\nAs you will see by the printed statement of accounts, our\nfinancial condition is also satisfactory, and we have in addition,\nthanks to a generous legacy, a considerable reserve fund, which\nwe hope the liberality of our members will increase. The\nCouncil have placed this reserve fund in the hands of Trustees\nand have determined to appropriate the interest of it, when\nit reaches the sum of \u00a38000, to the purpose of experimental\nresearch in such subjects as fall within the scope of our Society.\nIt is true that no original research of any value can ever\nbe made to order. The progress of knowledge in psychical\nscience, as elsewhere, must in the end rest upon the self-\nsacrificing and intelligent work of those in whom a keen interest\nfor a particular branch of enquiry has been excited, and whose\nenthusiasm is not stimulated by, nor can it be repaid in, coin\n\fxlviii.] Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. 325\nof the realm. But the investigator has to live, and to enable\nhim to do so whilst he is conducting any hopeful enquiry,\nsanctioned by the Council, a modest sum will be appropriated\nto him as a grant in aid.\nWe hope to receive from time to time applications from\ncompetent enquirers of either sex who will undertake special\nlines of investigation. It might also be desirable, though here\nI speak my own opinion only, to follow the examples of the\nolder scientific societies and award medals or premiums for any\ngood piece of original work. There is an immense field for\ninvestigation ; psychical research is almost virgin ground as far\nas strict scientific enquiry is concerned, and though the worker\nis not likely in this generation to meet with much encouragement\nfrom the world at large, and still less any benefit to himself,\nhe may be sure his toil will not be in vain. I would therefore\nearnestly appeal to any members or friends of our Society to\ngive us what help they can ; if personal assistance is not possible,\ntheir contributions to the completion of our research fund will\nbe gratefully welcomed.1\nAnd this brings me to a point to which for a moment it\nis desirable to refer. The work of the Society has hitherto\nbeen in comparatively few hands, and the centre of gravity\nof the Society inevitably falls in that place (such as Cambridge)\nwhere the most active workers are or have been found. This\nhas led some of our members to feel perhaps a little aggrieved\nthat the centre is not within their own precincts, that they\nare not more in touch with the work of the Society, and that\nmatters of great interest may be occupying attention at head\nquarters and yet no information may reach them. If this\nrepresents any general feeling, is not the remedy to be found\nin wider and more earnest co-operation in our work on the\npart of the members generally ? The Journal of the Society\nwas established to encourage this and to be an organ of com\nmunication between the members. I should be glad to see\nit more freely used for this purpose, and for the speedy publica\ntion of any first-hand evidence that our members may possess ;\n1 In consequence of this appeal two members of the Society wrote to me that\nthey would contribute \u00a350 each if eighteen others would do the same so as to\nmake up \u00a31000 in the present year ; \u00a3113 3s. has since been received, and perhaps\nsome readers may feel moved to contribute towards the completion of the sum.\n\f826 Address by Uie President,\nand also for the prompt communication of information from\nheadquarters which would be of interest to members generally.\nI hope, therefore, without any departure from the caution and\nreserve, which are so necessary in dealing with the phenomena\nthat engage our attention, we may be able to have a more\nfrequent interchange of thought and opinion between the Council\nand the body of our members, and I shall be glad if I can be\nof any service in promoting this.\nAs regards wider co-operation in our work, I would venture\nto suggest local group* should be formed, meeting weekly or\nmonthly for investigation or discussion.1 If you ask me what\nwork can be done by these local groups, a beginning might be\nmade in the determination of two problems, which though\nthey may be simple and dull, are nevertheless of considerable\nimportance, and which can only be settled by wide-spread\nassistance.\nOne of these problems may be stated thus :\n(1) Assuming the existence of telepathy, is the transference\nof thought from one person to another independently of the\nrecognised channels of sensation, a faculty in some slight\ndegree possessed by all, or is it confined only to a few ? Prof.\nRichet and others have made experiments on this question, but\nit is still an open one. It is very easy to devise methods of\nexperiments between two persons, choosing the simplest form,\nsuch as tossing a coin, and noting whether the right guesses\nin, say every 100 trials, somewhat exceed the number which\nchance alone would indicate. But patience is necessary in all\ninvestigations to make the result of any value, and also pre\ncautions with which no doubt you are familiar, such as the\navoidance of facial or other indications. There are other ques\ntions in connection with telepathy which need elucidation to\nwhich I will refer presently.\nThe other problem is :\n(2) To what extent is motor-automatism common among\nmankind ? By motor automatism is meant the purposive\nmovement of one's voluntary muscles without any intention or\nconscious effort on our part. The simplest and most sensitive\n1 No member of the Society has done more in this direction than Colonel\nTaylor, U.K., and I hope his example and admirable method of investigation\nwill be widely followed.\n\fxlvIIi.] Professor W. F. Barrett, F.K.S.\ntest is to hold a forked twig in your hand after the manner\nof a dowser, and see if the twig curls up of its own accord\nwhen you walk round your garden, or go in search of some\nhidden object. Some one or more members of your investi\ngating circle will probably succeed, in spite of their incredulity.\nNow it is important to know (1st) the percentage of success\namong all our friends, and (2nd) whether other phenomena of\nmotor automatism occur with the same individual, such as the\nmovement of the pendule explorateur, automatic writing, etc.,\nand (3rd) whether these movements are merely fortuitous, or\nwhether they are veridical, that is to say, do they give us\ntruth-telling information of something the individual could not\nhave ascertained by the use of his ordinary perceptive powers ?\nNow these problems require the willing co-operation of a\nnumber of intelligent investigators, but they do not require\ncostly apparatus nor any particular training beyond that of\ncareful observation ; nor are these experiments in the least\ninjurious to the operator, nor likely to excite any opposition\neven from a hyper-sensitive conscience. It is true they may seem\ntrivial and tiresome: if any person think so, I am afraid they\nwould think the details of all scientific investigation trivial\nand tiresome. The work of a bricklayer or a hodman in\nbuilding a house would seem to be very monotonous, if we\ndid not regard the end in view.\nI am sometimes asked what our Society has already achieved,\nwhat has it done to justify its existence ? The reply to this\nis found in the eighteen closely printed volumes of our\nProceedings, and the eleven volumes of our Journal, containing\nan immense mass of evidence, the record of carefully sifted\nobservations or of stringent experiments. These form a store\nhouse of material which we have every reason to believe will\nbecome increasingly valuable to students both of psychology\nand philosophy in the not distant future. Unquestionably a\nchange of opinion is gradually coming about through the work\nof our Society. The widespread and unreasoning prejudice\nwhich 25 years ago existed against all psychical enquiry is\nbreaking down. This is seen in the list of distinguished men\nwho have become members of our society, and here I desire to\n\f328 [part\nAddress by the President,\nwelcome one of our great English savants, a man of European\nreputation, who has recently joined our ranks, and this coinci-\ndently with his election to the high position of joint Hon.\nSecretary to the Royal Society.\nBut although there is a more open mind on the part of\nscience towards psychical research, it must be confessed it is still\nlooked at somewhat askance by the leaders and organs of official\nscience. It is worth a moment's attention to consider why this\nshould be. No one asserts that the knowledge we are seeking\nto obtain is unimportant, for as the learned Dr. Glanville said\n200 years ago about similar subjects to those we are studying,\n\" These things relate to our biggest interests ; if established\nthey secure some of the outworks of religion.\" Nor, so far as\nI know, does any one assert we are hasty and incautious, or\nunscientific in our method of investigation. No doubt one\nreason for the present attitude of official science towards us\nhas been the prevalence and paralysing influence of a material\nistic philosophy, which denies the possibility of mind without\na material brain, or of any means of access from other minds\nto our mind except through the recognised channels of\nsensation. Both these propositions are of course denied by\nour religious teachers, who assert that a spiritual world does\nexist, and that the inspired writings were given supersensuously\nto man. Nevertheless as a body, though with some\nnotable exceptions, even they do not welcome us with open\narms. The common ground and official view of both science and\nreligion is that all extension to our existing knowledge in their\nrespective departments can only come through the channels\nrecognised by each ; in the one case the channel is bounded\nby the five senses, and in the other case it is that sanctioned\nby authority. We must all admit that even unconsciously\nauthority has a large share in moulding our convictions and\ndetermining our conduct, in fact we cannot emancipate our\nselves from its subtle influence. As a rule this is beneficial,\nunless it can be shown that authority is untrustworthy; but\nthe attempt to prove that it is so is sure to be an un\ngracious and difficult task, and almost certain to bring odium\nto bear upon those who, if they eventually prove to be right,\nare in a subsequent generation hailed as benefactors of the race.\nSome years ago that most learned man, the late Prof, von\n\fXLvIIi.] 329\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nHelmholtz, visited Dublin. I had then recently published a\npaper giving for the first time \u25a0prima facie evidence of some\nthing new to science, called thought-transference, now known\nas telepathy. Helmholtz, who was a great physiologist as well\nas physicist, had some conversation with me on the subject,\nand he ended by saying : \" I cannot believe it. Neither the\ntestimony of all the Fellows of the Royal Society, nor even the\nevidence of my own senses, would lead me to believe in the\ntransmission of thought from one person to another independently\nof the recognised channels of sensation. It is clearly im\npossible.\" The respect that is due to so great a man renders it\nnecessary to show in a few words why this statement (one that\nused to be common enough) is wholly indefensible. First, the\nphenomena in question, and all the phenomena within the scope\nof our Society, are not contradictions, but merely extensions of\nour existing knowledge ; they may be strange and inexplicable,\nbut that merely indicates that the evidence in support of the\nnew facts must be recognised as adequate. As Laplace long\nago said in his Theory of Probabilities : \" We are so far\nfrom knowing all the agents of nature, and their various\nmodes of action, that it would not be philosophical to deny\nany phenomena merely because in the actual state of our\nknowledge they are inexplicable. This only ought we to do\n\u2014in proportion to the difficulty there seems to be in ad\nmitting the facts should be the scrupulous attention we bestow\non their examination.\"1 That this is the true spirit may be\nseen from the recent discoveries in connection with Radium.\nThese facts appeared even to contradict some of our previous\nknowledge. We always thought of an atom, as Lucretius did,\n\"strong in solid singleness,\" as the most immutable and im\nmortal thing in the physical universe. Now it appears to be\ncapable of disintegration and transmutation, and the views of the\nalchemists are beginning to revive : soon we may be looking\nfor the \" philosopher's stone \"\u2014the substance that by its\npresence enables the transmutation of other heavy atoms to\ncome about. Thus does the whirligig of time bring its revenges.\nBut to return. There is another fallacy in the scientific view\nexpressed by Helmholtz. He said, as many do, that nothing\ncould make him believe in such phenomena. But belief is not\n1 Laplace, Thioric Analytiqvz (Its Probability, Introd., p. 43.\n\f330 [part\nAddress by the President,\na voluntary act of the mind, it cannot be given or withheld\nat pleasure ; it is, obviously, an involuntary state, which follows\nif our judgment considers the evidence adduced both adequate\nand conclusive. We can, of course, as many do, refuse to listen\nto the evidence ; and it is worth noticing that in all our minds\nthere is a tendency to repel the intrusion of any ideas unrelated\nto our usual habits of thought, and which therefore involve an\nuncomfortable dislocation of our mind : so that attention to\nevidence of this character is a difficult act of self-conquest.\nHence every new departure in thought has to encounter great\nmental inertia, and wisely so, as preventing hasty and foolish\naberrations of mind. But when attention is given, and the\nevidence considered adequate, it is sheer nonsense to say you\nwon't believe it.\nIs there then any other ground why science should uot\nungrudgingly recognise the evidence so amply given in our\nProceedings ? I have recently made enquiries among some of\nmy scientific friends who stand aloof from us, to know what\nis their reason for so doing. Of course life is short, the claim\nof each particular branch of scientific investigation becomes\nincreasingly exacting, and but few have time to consider the\nevidence. That is obvious, but why do they shrug their\nshoulders when you mention, say, telepathy, or the faculty of\ndowsing ? Their attitude reminds me of an anecdote told by\nthat remarkable woman, Miss Caroline Fox, and which I think\nis mentioned in the memorials of her life. The charming\nresidence of Miss Fox in Cornwall was the meeting ground of\nmany famous men of the last generation. On one occasion that\ngreat Irishman, Sir W. Rowan Hamilton, there met Sir G.\nAiry, the then Astronomer-Royal. Hamilton had just pub\nlished his famous mathematical discovery of quaternions, and\nwas, I believe, explaining it to Airy. After a short time\nAiry said, \" I cannot see it at all.\" Hamilton replied, \" I have\nbeen investigating the matter closely for many months, and I\nam certain of its truth.\" \" Oh,\" rejoined Airy, \" I have been\nthinking over it for the last two or three minutes, and there\nis nothing in it.\" This is why some of our scientific friends\nshrug their shoulders at our researches. They feel competent,\nafter a few minutes' consideration, to reject conclusions which\nmay have cost us years of investigation.\n\fXLv1II.] 331\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nIn fact, nine-tenths of the positive opinions we are accus\ntomed to hear about psychical research are given judicially.\nThat is, the objector speaks of his conclusions as positively as\nif it were his office to know the truth, and implies that any\nopposition is a thing for him to judge of. \" He is annihilated,\"\nas Professor De Morgan pointed out some time ago, \" by being\nreduced, no matter how courteously, from judge to counsel.\nBut this is what must be done. The jurisdiction must be\ndenied. The great art is not to pull him off the bench without\nceremony, but to pull the bench from under him, without his\nexactly seeing how he came to tumble, and without proceeding\nto sit upon it yourself.\"\nEnquiry among my scientific friends has shown me that the\nroot of much, perhaps most, of the scientific scepticism towards\nour work is not because the phenomena are startling or inex\nplicable, but because they cannot be repeated at pleasure ; hence\nso very few scientific men have the opportunity of verifying\nthe observations some of us have made. They do not doubt\nour good faith, but they think we may have been mistaken in\nour conclusions, and until we can reproduce the phenomena\nbefore them, they feel justified in distrusting our results. This\nmight well give ground for suspense of judgment, but surely\nnot for any hostile attitude. It is, of course, most desirable\nto be able to repeat our experiments at pleasure, but the very\nnature of our enquiry precludes this. We do not refuse to\nbelieve in the fall of meteoric stones unless we can see one\nfalling. We may require a good deal of well-attested evidence\nfor their fall, but, once the fact is established, the stringency\nof the evidence demanded immediately relaxes. Now, unques\ntionably there are at present more capable witnesses who can\nspeak from personal and careful enquiry as to the fact of\ntelepathy, or of what is called spiritualistic phenomena, than\nthere are persons living who can testify to having seen the\nactual fall from space of meteoric stones.\nThe fact is, our scientific friends do not realise the profound\ndifference that exists between the conditions of a physical and\nof a psychical experiment. We know what conditions are\nrequisite in the former case, we do not know what they are in\n\f332 [part\nAddress by Vie President,\nthe latter, and hence the difficulty of all psychical investigation\nand the uncertainty of the reproduction of any given phenomenon.\nA moment's consideration shows that the demand made upon\nus by science for the demonstration at any moment of a par\nticular psychical phenomenon is inconsistent with the very\nobject of our enquiry. Psychical experiments depend on the\nmental state of the subject ; you may tell a person to do\nsomething, but whether he does it or not depends on the\nperson addressed. Physical experiments are independent of our\nvolition ; a magnet attracts iron, or sets itself in the magnetic\nmeridian, irrespective of our mental condition. This obvious\ndifference between the two sets of phenomena is constantly\noverlooked. Physical science excludes from its survey the\nelement of personality, with which we have to deal and\nover which we have little or no control. It regards all phe\nnomena as strictly impersonal, and finds abundant field for\ninvestigation within the narrow limits it has marked out for\nitself: these things it regards as real, the rest as shadowy.\nThe truth is, of course, exactly the reverse. The reality of\nwhich we are conscious is our self, our personality. It is the\nphenomena of external nature which are shadowy ; shadows cast\nby some reality of which our senses tell us absolutely nothing.\nThere is, however, no reason why the methods so successfully\npursued by science should not also be pursued in the study of\nthe complex and shifting phenomena of human personality.\nNow this is precisely the object of our Society\u2014the accurate\ninvestigation of that wide range of obscure but wonderful powers\nincluded within the mysterious thing we call ourself. Albeit\nwe are but at the beginning of a task so vast that it may, in\ntime to come, make all the discoveries of physical science seem\ntrivial, all its labours seem insignificant in comparison with\nthe stupendous problems that are before us.\nWe need, therefore, much more experimental evidence in every\ndepartment of our work. So long ago as 1876, in a paper\nread before the British Association in that year, I stated that\nbefore science could attack with any hope of success the in\nvestigation of alleged spiritualistic phenomena, we must know\nwhether definite ideas can unconsciously be communicated from\none person to another: whether such a thing as thought-\ntransference does really exist. Evidence was adduced in favour\n\fXLvIIi.] 333\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nof this hypothesis. We have done much since then, but much\nremains to be done before telepathy can take its place as an\naccepted axiom of scientific knowledge.\nI referred at the beginning of my address to some problems\nin connection with telepathy that await solution. Permit me\nfor a few moments to return to this.\nThere is one question in regard to telepathy and similar\npsychical phenomena, which is likely to remain an outstand\ning difficulty. By what process can one mind affect another\nat a distance ? Physical science teaches us that there is\nno such thing as \"action at a distance.\" Energy at a distance\nreaches us either by the translation of matter through space,\nlike a flying bullet, which carries the energy ; or by the\nintermediary action of some medium, like the transmission of\nsound-bearing waves through the air, or of luminiferous waves\nthrough the ether, the energy being handed on from wave\nto wave. We may talk of brain waves, but that is only\nunscientific talk, we know of nothing of the kind. Neither\ndo we know how gravitation acts across space : by what means\nsuch tremendous forces as bind the solar system together are\neither exerted or transmitted we know absolutely nothing.\nWe don't talk of gravitation waves, we wait for further know\nledge on this mysterious problem ; and in like manner we\nmust patiently wait for more light on the mode of transmission\nof thought through space. It may well be that thought tran\nscends both matter and space, and has no relation to either.\nThat mass, space, and time, may only be but the mental\nsymbols we form of our present material system, and have\nno ultimate reality in themselves.\n^.nother question is as follows : May not the uncertainty\nand difficulty of our experiments in thought-transference partly\narise from the fact that we are not going to work the right\nway ? We try to obtain evidence of the transmission of a\nword or idea through some conscious and voluntary act on\nthe part of the percipient. We wait for a verbal or written\nresponse. Is not this a mistake ? Ought we not rather to\nseek for evidence of thought-transference in the region of the\nsub-conscious life ? I believe in the case of both the agent\n\f334 [part\nAddress by the President,\nand percipient the conscious will plays only a secondary part.\nThis is also true I think in all cases of suggestion, and of\nthe therapeutic effect of suggestion. It is notably seen in\nthe cures wrought by what is known as Christian Science.\nI happen to have had occasion to study these somewhat\ncarefully of late, and undoubtedly remarkable cures are effected,\nit may be by suggestion, but without the usual suggestive treat\nment ; the only formula is the \" Allness of God,\" and the\n\" non-existence of disease.\" But the healing processes are set\ngoing by a purely sub-conscious act. And so in telepathy,\nwe need to hand over the whole matter to the subliminal\nactivities. The difficulty is how to do this. Hypnosis is\none way. And in the ordinary waking state, the agent, who\nmakes the suggestion, or transmits the idea, would I believe\ndo so more effectively if, after the intention had soaked into\nhis mind, he left it alone, so far as any conscious effort was\nconcerned. And the percipient should be as passive as\npossible, make no effort to guess the word, but allow the\nperception to reveal itself through some involuntary action.\nAutomatic writing would be the most effective, but that is\nnot very common ; the twisting of the forked dowsing twig\nmight be utilised, indicating the letters of the alphabet by\nits motion ; or in other ways. In the historical researches I\nhave made on the so-called divining rod, I found it was used\nin this very manner two centuries ago. In fact what we\nneed to learn is the language of the subliminal life, how it\nspeaks to us, how we can speak to it. The voluntary action\nof the muscles in speech or gesture is the language of our\nconscious life ; the involuntary action of our muscles, and\nemotional disturbance, appear to be the language of the sub\nconscious life.\nThen another point should be noticed, the frequent lagging\nof the impression in the percipient. 1 observed this again\nand again in my first experiments in thought-transference 25\nyears ago. The correct reply to a previous experiment would\nsometimes come in answer to a later and different experi\nment. I have noticed the same thing also in dowsing, with\nsome dowsers the motion of the twig lags behind the moment\nof the impression ; it turns after the dowser has passed a\nlittle beyond the right spot. We have precisely similar phe\n\fxlviii.] Professor W. F. Barrett, F.E.S.\nnomena in physical science. The magnetic state of iron lags\na little behind the magnetising force it is subjected to ; this\nis known as hysteresis, from a Greek word signifying to lag\nbehind. So I believe there is a psychical as well as a physical\nhysteresis, and if so, it should be reckoned with in our experi\nments. It is improbable that any psychical action, even of\ntelepathy, occurs without some preceding change in the nerve\ntissues ; in technical phraseology neurosis must always precede\npsychosis ; and then this change must rise till it is of suffi\ncient magnitude to create the reflex that moves the muscles.\nAnd all this involves time, which may be greater or less,\nand so account for the occasional lag we observe.\nOther questions suggest themselves. Is it the idea or the\nword, the emotion or the expression of the emotion, that is\ntransmitted in telepathy ? Probably the idea. If so it affords\na hint towards the interchange of thought amongst the race\nin spite of differences of language. Language is but a clumsy\ninstrument of thought, and quite incommensurate to it ; its\narbitrary signs show it to be but the rudiments of a system\nwhich the evolutionary progress of the race may lead us to\nhope will be more perfect in the future. How much more\naccurately should we be able to transmit complex ideas and\nsubtle emotions if thought could evoke thought without the\nmechanism of speech. This may now be the case in the\nstate of life in the unseen. The sanctity and privacy of our\nminds will, however, require to be protected from unwelcome\nintrusion, and this, so far as our conscious life is concerned,\nwill doubtless be within our own power to effect, so long\nas we retain control over our self-hood, our true personality.1\nThen, again, may not animals share with man this telepathic\npower ? They have in some directions keener perceptive facul\nties than man, and there is evidence that they are strongly\naffected by what we call apparitions. It may be that animals,\nand insects like the ant and the bee, do communicate with\neach other by some process analogous to telepathy. It is worth\ntrying to find out whether say, a favourite dog can respond\nto a telepathic impact from his master. In centuries to come\n1In that remarkable book published some 70 years ago, Isaac Taylor's\nPhysical Theory of Another Life, Chap, viii., will be found a prevision of\ntelepathy and of some of the ideas contained in the foregoing paragraph.\n\f336 [part\nAddress by the President,\nit is just possible that through some such interchange of feelings\nwe may get into closer communion with all sentient things.\nThere is one argument in favour of the existence of some\nthing analogous to thought-transference, which\u2014so far as I\nknow\u2014has not been used, and it is, I think, a legitimate\nargument, for it is based upon the underlying unity that\nexists throughout Nature. The theory of gravitation teaches\nus that every grain of sand on every seashore in this world,\nevery particle of salt in every salt cellar, is for ever pulling\nevery grain of sand or salt, not only on this earth, but\non every planet, or star, in the whole Universe. And vice\nversa, for there is a reciprocal influence ever going on between\nthese myriads of remote things. Nay, more, such is the\nsolidarity of the Universe that an interchange of radiation,\nas well of attraction, is ever taking place between things on\nthis earth, and also between our planet and every member\nof the solar system. No fact in physical science is more\ncertain than this. May not this \" theory of exchanges,\"\nthis mobile equilibrium, extend to the psychical as well as\nthe physical universe ? Tennyson, with poetic prescience, asks\nin Aylmer's Field :\n\" Star to star vibrates light, may soul to soul\nStrike thro' a finer element of her own?\"\nCertainly it seems very probable that every centre of conscious\nness is likely to react telepathically upon every other centre.1\n1 Since this address was delivered my attention has been drawn to Mrs.\nBrowning's striking sonnet on \" Life,\" wherein the same idea is elaborated ;\npoets are certainly wonderful pioneers of thought ; before telepathy was\nthought of Mrs. Browning wrote :\n\" Each creature holds an insular point in space ;\nYet what man stirs a finger, breathes a sound,\nBut all the multitudinous beings round\nIn all the countless worlds, with time and place\nFor their conditions, down to the central base,\nThrill, haply, in vibration and rebound,\nLife answering life across the vast profound,\nIn full antiphony, by a common grace ?\nI think this sudden joyaunce which illumes\nA child's mouth sleeping, unaware may run\nFrom some soul newly loosened from earth's tombs :\nI think this passionate sigh, which half begun\nI stifle back, may reach and stir the plumes\nOf God's calm angel standing in the sun.\"\n\fxlvIIi.] 337\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.M.S.\nIt is hard to believe that the play of vital forces should be\nmore restricted than that of the physical forces; that radio\nactivities should be confined to inanimate matter. If this\nunconscious radiation and reaction is going on between mind\nand mind, then observed cases of telepathy would simply mean\nthe awakening of consciousness to the fact in certain minds.\nWhy some and not all minds, and why so fitfully the conscious\nperception should be aroused, are problems we must leave to the\nfuture, they are quite consistent with what we find everywhere\nin nature. For my own part, I am disposed to think this inter\nchange is common to the race, and is the chief reason why\nall men are insensibly moulded by their environment. Only,\nas I said just now, I believe the telepathic exchange emanates\nfrom and affects the sub-conscious part of our personality. It\nis potentially conscious, and may, and probably will eventually\nbecome an integral part of our self-consciousness.\nWe know as a matter of fact that a vast number of im\npressions are constantly being made upon us, of which we take\nno heed ; they do not interest us, or they are not strong enough\nto arouse consciousness. But the impressions are there, they\nleave a mark upon us though we are not aware of it, and\nthey may float to the surface, or be evoked at some future time.\nOne of the most certain and striking results of the investigations\nmade by our Society is that the content of our sub-conscious\nlife is far greater than that of our conscious life. Our minds\nare like a photographic plate, sensitive to all sorts of im-\n' pressions, but our ego develops only a few of these impressions,\nthese are our conscious perceptions, the rest are latent, awaiting\ndevelopment, which may come in sleep, hypnosis, or trance, or\nby the shock of death, or after death.\nBut even here and now this sub-conscious radio-activity of\nthought may already play some part in the growing sense of\nsympathy and humanity we find in the race. And what a\nchange would be wrought if it were suddenly to become an\nelement of consciousness among mankind. To realise the brother\nhood of the race would not then be a pious aspiration or a\nstrenuous effort, but the reality of all others most vividly before\nus ; involuntarily sharers in one another's pleasures and pains,\nthe welfare of our fellow-men would be the factor in our lives\nwhich would dominate all our conduct. What would be the\n\f338 [part\nAddress by the President,\nuse of a luxurious club and Parisian cooks if the privation and\nsuffering of the destitute were telepathically part and parcel\nof our lives ? Slowly the race does seem to be awakening to\nthe sense of a larger self, which embraces the many in the One,\nto\n\"A heart that beats\nIn all ita pulses with the common heart\nOf humankind, which the same things make glad,\nThe same make sorry.\"\nThe instinct of true religion, like the insight of the true poet,\narrives at some great verity without the process of reasoning or\nthe need of proof. Thus it has been with the belief in prayer\nand in the efficacy of prayer. Scepticism scoffs at a mystery\nwhich involves the direct action of mind on mind and the still\ngreater mystery of the movement of the Infinite by the finite,\u2014\nbut faith remains unshaken. For us wayfaring men, however,\nreason needs some help in climbing the steeps attained by faith.\nAnd is not this help afforded by the steps slowly being cut\nin the upward path by means of psychical research ? What\nis telepathy but the proof of the reasonableness of prayer ?\nNo longer need our reason rest content with the plausible ex\nplanation that prayer can do no more than evoke a subjective\nresponse in the suppliant, that it is inconceivable how the Infinite\nand the finite mind, the One manifest in the many, can have\nany community of thought. On the contrary, if telepathy be\nindisputable, if our creaturely minds can, without voice or sensa\ntion, impress each other, the Infinite mind is likely thus to have\nrevealed itself in all ages to responsive human hearts. Some may\nhave the spiritual ear, the open vision, but to all of us there\ncomes at times the echo of that larger Life which is slowly\nexpressing itself in humanity as the ages gradually unfold. In\nfact the teaching of science has ever been that we are not\nisolated in, or from, the great Cosmos ; the light of suns and\nstars reaches us, the mysterious force of gravitation binds the\nwhole material universe into an organic whole, the minutest\nmolecule and the most distant orb are bathed in one and the self\nsame medium. But surely beyond and above all these material\nlinks is the solidarity of Mind. As the essential significance\nand unity of a honeycomb is not in the cells of wax, but in\nthe common life and purpose of the builders of those cells, so the\n\fXLvIIi.] 339\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.B.S.\ntrue significance of nature is not in the material world but in\nthe Mind that gives to it a meaning, and that underlies and\nunites, that transcends and creates, the phenomenal world through\nwhich for a moment each of us is passing. \" The things which\nare seen are temporal, but the things which are unseen are\neternal.\"\nI will now turn for a few minutes to another branch of our\nresearches, which has special interest for me as it was this\nsubject that first aroused my interest in experimental psycho\nlogy and to which I gave many months of experiment long\nbefore our Society was founded. I refer to Hypnotism.\nThere are no doubt many present who remember the outcry\nthat was once raised against the investigation of hypnotism, then\ncalled mesmerism. Constant attacks were made by the medical\nand scientific world on the one hand, and by the religious world\non the other, upon the early workers at this subject. They were\ndenounced as impostors, shunned as pariahs, and unceremoniously\npitched out of the synagogues both of science and religion ; and\nthis within my own memory. Physiological and medical science\ncan only hang its head in shame when it looks back upon that\nperiod. What do we find to-day\u2014the subject of hypnotism and\nits therapeutic value recognised ! It has now become an integral\npart of scientific teaching and investigation in several medical\nschools, more especially on the Continent. I think our Society\nmay fairly lay claim to have contributed to this change of view,\nand the work of our members, Edmund Gurney, and Doctors\nArthur Myers, Milne Bramwell and Lloyd Tuckey, has added\nmuch to the knowledge of a subject the importance of which it\nis difficult to overrate. It is also worthy of note how the former\nneglect of this subject by science relegated it to the ignorant\nand the charlatan, and its practice to mysterious and often\nmischievous public amusements. These are now less common ;\nand though the public apprehension of the dangerous abuse of\nhypnotism is grossly exaggerated, for it is less open to abuse\nthan chloroform, I, for one, am strongly of opinion that we,\nas a Society, should discourage, and (as in many Continental\ncountries) get the legislature to forbid the practice of hypnotism\nexcept under proper medical supervision.\nz\n\f340 [part\nAddress by the President,\nNow I think it is the duty of our Society to cherish the\nmemory of these courageous seekers after truth, who were the\npioneers in this and other branches of psychical research. The\nsplendid and self-sacrificing labours of those distinguished\nphysicians, Doctors Elliotson and Esdaile, in the fields of\nhypnotic therapeutics and painless surgery under hypnosis should\nnever be forgotten, any more than the later work of Dr. Braid\nof Manchester. Dr. Elliotson, though at the head of his pro\nfession, sacrificed everything for the advancement of this branch\nof knowledge. The mesmeric hospital in London, and the\nsimilar hospital founded in Calcutta by an enlightened Governor-\nGeneral and placed under the care of Dr. Esdaile, did remarkable\nwork, too little known at the present day. I am therefore glad\nto see in Dr. Milne Bramwell's inagmim opus on hypnotism\nthat he draws special attention to the labours of Elliotson,\nEsdaile and Braid. And it is to be regretted how completely\nthese pioneers are ignored in the works on suggestive thera\npeutics by Dr. Bernheim, Dr. Liebeault, Dr. Schofield, and some\nothers.\nLeaving this part of our subject, now within the purview of\nscience, let us pass to the extreme or advanced wing of\npsychical research ; to that part of our work on which con\nsiderable differences of opinion exist even within our Society.\nI refer to spiritualistic phenomena. With regard to these we\nmust all agree that indiscriminate condemnation on the one\nhand, and ignorant credulity on the other, are the two most\nmischievous elements with which we are confronted in connec\ntion with this subject. It is because we, as a Society, feel\nthat in the fearless pursuit of truth it is the paramount duty\nof science to lead the way, that the scornful attitude of the\nscientific world towards even the investigation of these phe\nnomena is so much to be deprecated. Hence, as in the case\nof those who were the pioneers in the study of hypnotism, we\nought not to forget the small band of investigators who\nbefore our time had the courage, after patient enquiry, to\nannounce their belief in what, for want of any better theory,\nthey called spiritualistic phenomena. No doubt we can pick\nholes in their method of investigation, but they were just as\n\fXLvIIi.] 341\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nhonest, just as earnest seekers after truth, as we claim to be,\nand they deserve more credit than we can lay claim to, for\nthey had to encounter greater opposition and vituperation.\nThe superior person then, as now, smiled at the credulity of\nthose better informed than himself. I suppose we are all apt\nto fancy our own power of discernment and of sound judgment\nto be somewhat better than our neighbours'. But after all is\nit not the common-sense, the care, the patience, and the\namount of uninterrupted attention we bestow upon any\npsychical phenomena we are investigating, that gives value to\nthe opinion at which we arrive, and not the particular clever\nness or scepticism of the observer ? The lesson we all need to\nlearn is that what even the humblest of men affirm from their\nown experience, is always worth listening to, but what even\nthe cleverest of men, in their ignorance, deny is never worth a\nmoment's attention.\nThe acute and powerful intellect of Professor De Morgan,\nthe great exposer of scientific humbug, long ago said, and he\nhad the courage publicly to state, that however much the\nSpiritualists might be ridiculed, they were undoubtedly on the\ntrack that has led to all advancement in knowledge, for they\nhad the spirit and method of the old times, when paths had to\nbe cut through the uncleared forests in which we can now\neasily walk.1 Their spirit was that of universal examination\nunchecked by the fear of being detected in the investigation\nof nonsense. This was the spirit that animated the Floren\ntine Academicians and the first Fellows of the Koyal Society\n250 years ago; they set to work to prove all things that they\nmight hold fast to that which was good. And their method\nwas that of all scientific research, viz., to start a theory and\nsee how it worked. Without a theory \" facts are a mob, not an\narmy.\" Meteorology at the present moment is buried under a\nvast mob of observations for want of ingenuity in devising\ntheories ; any working hypothesis is better than none at all.\nAnd so I agree with De Morgan that the most sane and\nscientific method in psychical research is not to be afraid of pro\npounding a theory because it may seem extraordinary, but\nhave courage to do so and see if it works. The theory of\nthought-transference led to the accumulation of evidence which\n1 See Preface of From Mailer to Spirit, p. xviii.\n7.2\n\f342 [part\nAddress by the President,\nbids fair, sooner or later, to place telepathy among the estab\nlished truths of science.\nThe amusing feature in the progress of knowledge is that,\nusually, critics who resist as long as they can a new theory are\napt afterwards, when the theory becomes widely accepted, to use\nit indiscriminately, as if it covered all obscure phenomena ; and\nso it becomes a kind of fetish in their thoughts. We are all\nfamiliar with the imposture theory, with the coincidence theory,\nand with the telepathic theory ; each excellent in their way,\nbut most foolish and unscientific if we allow any one of them\nto obscure our vision or paralyse our investigation. What is\nto be reprobated, as De Morgan said, \" is not the wariness\nwhich widens and lengthens enquiry, but the assumption which\nprevents and narrows it.\"\nInstances are well known of the most acute and careful\nenquirers, trained psychical detectives we might call them, who\nhaving begun with a priori reasoning and resolute scepticism,\nwhen they have thrown aside their preconceived assumptions,\nand given the necessary time and patience to the investigation\nof one particular case, have gone over to the spiritualistic camp.\nThey may be right or wrong in their present opinion, but we\nmust all admit they have far better reasons for forming a\njudgment than any of us can have. If they are right it\nfollows that the particular case they have investigated is not\nlikely to be a solitary one, but typical of similar cases with us\nas well as with them.\nPray do not suppose I hold a brief on behalf of spiritualism\neither as a practice or a religion. On the contrary, to my\nmind few things are more dismal than the common run\nof spiritualistic stances. Sometimes they revolt one's feelings,\nand always they are a weariness to the flesh. Perhaps\nthe manifold experiences I have had have been unfortu\nnate, and I freely admit my remarks apply more particularly\nto sittings with professional mediums, where what are called\nphysical manifestations take place, which always seem to be on\na lower plane, even where the possibility of fraud has been\ncarefully excluded. Nevertheless, if we can get at truth, what\ndoes it matter whether we draw it from a well or drag it\nfrom a bog ?\nIt is impossible, however, not to feel some sympathy with\n\fxlvIIi.] 343\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nthe common objection of the doubter that the phenomena are of\nso paltry a character. But we cannot prescribe to nature, we\ncannot get rid of the leprosy of doubt by choosing rivers of\nour own to wash in. And so we must be content with what\nwe find. After all, from a scientific point of view, nothing can\nbe paltry or mean that manfests life.\nBacteriologists spend their days searching for evidence of the\nlowest forms of life. And surely any evidence of personality that\ngives us the faintest, rudest sign that life still persists though\nthe clothing of the body be gone, is worth infinite trouble to\nattain. Though it may be\n\"Only a signal shown and a voice from out of the darkness,\"\nit is not paltry. In fine, it is this natural human longing\nthat renders a dispassionate consideration of the facts, a calm\nand critical weighing of the evidence, so difficult and yet so\nimperative.\nWe must, however, bear in mind, as was pointed out by the\npresent Prime Minister in the remarkable address he delivered\nfrom this chair, that if science had first attempted to include\nin its survey not only physical but psychical phenomena it\nmight for centuries have lost itself in dark and difficult\nregions, and the work of science to-day would then have been\nless, not more complete.1 This is very true, the foundations of\nour faith in the undeviating order of nature had to be laid\nby the investigation of the laws of matter and motion and by\nthe discovery of the orderly evolution of life. What science\nhas now established is that the universe is a cosmos, not a\nchaos, that amidst the mutability of all things there is no\ncapriciousness, no disorder ; that in the interpretation of nature,\nhowever entangled or obscure the phenomena may be, we shall\nnever be put to intellectual confusion.\nNow, if instead of investigating the normal phenomena of\nthe world in which we live, science had first grappled with\nsupernormal phenomena, it would not have reached so soon\nits present assured belief in a reign of law. We believe that\nfuller knowledge of the obscure phenomena we are investigat\ning will in time come to us, as it has in other branches of\n1 Proceedings S.P.R., vol. x., p. 5.\n\f344 [l'AUT\nAddress by the President,\nscience, but the appearances are so elusive, the causes so\ncomplex, the results of work sometimes so disheartening, that\nwe need the steadying influence of the habit of thought\nengendered by science to enable us patiently and hopefully to\npursue our way.\nPossibly historical research amongst the most ancient records\nmay give us fragments of unsuspected information ; for it is very\nprobable that many, if not all the psychical phenomena we\nare now investigating were known, and the knowledge jealously\nguarded, in ages long past. The very high civilisation which\nis now known to have existed thousands of years before Christ\nin the earliest Egyptian dynasties, makes it almost inconceiv\nable to imagine that subjects of such transcendent interest to\nmankind were not then part of the learning of the few, part\nof \" the wisdom of Egypt.\" The seizure of this knowledge by\nthe priestly caste and its restriction to themselves, with\npenalties to all intruders, was the natural sequence of the\nlower civilisation that followed. Thus psychical phenomena\nbecame veiled in mystery, and ultimately degraded to a mis\nchievous superstition. Mystic rites were added to impress the\nmultitude ; finally divination, enchantment, augury, and necro\nmancy became methods of wielding a mysterious power held\nby the few. But such practices \" wearied the people's intellect,\ndestroyed their enterprise and distorted their conscience.\" 1 The\nindustry and politics of the people became paralysed by giving\nheed to an oracle, or to gibbering spirits, rather than to\nreason and strenuous endeavour. The great Hebrew prophets,\nthe statesmen of their day, saw this clearly and had the\ncourage to denounce such practices in unmistakable terms ;\nwarning the people that by using these things as an infallible\nguide, or as a religion, they were being misled, and reason\nwas being dethroned from her seat. And so the burden of\ntheir speech was, \" Thy spells and enchantments with which\nthou hast wearied thyself have led thee astray.\"2 Hence these\npractices were prohibited, as a careful study of the whole\nsubject shows, because they enervated the nation, and tended\nto obscure the Divine idea; to weaken the supreme faith in,\nand reverent worship of, the one omnipotent Being the Hebrew\n1 Prof. G. A. Smith in his brilliant and scholarly work on Isaiah, vol. 2., p. 199.\n2Cf. latter half of Isaiah, 47 ch.\n\fxlvIIi.] 345\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.B.S.\nnation was set apart to proclaim. With no assured know\nledge of the great world-order we now possess, these elusive\noccult phenomena confused both the intellectual and moral\nsense, and so they were wisely thrust aside. But the danger\nat the present day is very different. Instead of a universe\npeopled with unseen personalities, the science of to-day has\ngone to the other extreme, and as Mr. Myers once eloquently\nsaid, we are now taught to believe \" the Universe to be a\nsoulless interaction of atoms, and life a paltry misery closed\nin the grave.\" Were the Hebrew prophets now amongst us,\nsurely their voice would not be raised in condemnation of\nthe attempts we are making to show that the order of\nNature contains an even vaster procession of phenomena than\nare now embraced within the limits of recognised science,\nand that behind the appearances with which science deals\nthere are more enduring and transcendent realities.\nI have ventured upon this digression in the hope that I\nmay remove the misgivings with which a part of our work\nis regarded by some leaders of religious opinion, who from\ntime to time have been in communication with me. Perhaps\nI may also alid that the aversion which some feel towards\nany enquiry into spiritualistic phenomena arises I think from\na misapprehension. With what is spiritual, with religion,\nthese phenomena have nothing in common. They may afford\nus a rational belief in the existence of life without a visible\nbody, of thought without material protoplasm, and so become\nthe handmaid of faith. But they belong to a wholly different\norder from that of religious faith. Our concern is solely with\nthe evidence for certain phenomena ; and as Professor Karl\nPearson has said, \" Wherever there is the slightest possibility\nfor the mind of men to know, there is a legitimate problem\nfor science.\" Hence all appearances, whether of microbes or\nof men, are legitimate subjects of investigation. Because they\nhappen to be fitful, or phenomena occurring in an unseen\nenvironment, does not render the investigation improper or\nunscientific, though it makes it considerably more difficult.\nNow the investigations we have published undeniably\nestablish the fact, that human personality embraces a far larger\n\f346 [part\nAddress by the President,\nscope than science has hitherto recognised. That it partakes\nof a two-fold life, on one side a self-consciousness which is\nawakened by, and related to time and space, to sense and\noutward things ; on the other side a deeper, slumbering, but\npotential consciousness, the record of every unheeded past\nimpression, possessing higher receptive and perceptive powers\nthan our normal self-consciousness, a self that, I believe,\nlinks our individual life to the ocean of life, and to the\nSource of all life. It is a remarkable fact that long ago\nthe philosopher Kant instinctively stated the same truth.\nHe says : \" [It is possible that] the human soul even in\nthis life stands in indissoluble community with all im\nmaterial natures of the spirit world, it mutually acts upon\nthem and receives from them impressions, of which, how\never, as man, it is unconscious as long as all goes well.\" 1\nThis, of course, was Swedenborg's view. He frequently tells\nus, \" Man is so constituted that he is at the same lime in the\nspiritual world and in the natural world.\" Plotinus, who lived in\nthe third century, held a similar belief, this was in fact the view\nof the Neo-Platonists and of the later mystics generally.2 In\nconnection with this subject may I commend to you the\nperusal of Dr. Du Prel's Philosophy of Mysticism, which has been\ntranslated with loving labour by one of the earliest and best\nfriends of our Society, Mr. C. C. Massey : perhaps the most\nvaluable part of the work being the suggestive introduction\nwhich Mr. Massey has himself added.3\n1 \" Es wird kiinftig, ich weiss nicht wo oder wann, nocb bewiesen werden, dass\ndie menschliche Seele auch in diesen Leben in eincr unaufloslich verknilpften\nGemeinschaft mit alien immateriellen Naturen der Geisterwelt stehe, dass sie\nwechselweise in diese wirke und von ihnen Eindriicke empfange, deren sie sich\nals Mensch nicht bewusst ist, so lange alles wohl steht.\" (Kant's Sammlliche\nWerke, Hartenstein's Edition, 1867, vol. ii., p. 341.)\n2 Vaughan's \"Hours with the Mystics,\" vol. i., contains an excellent sum\nmary of the views of the Neo-Platonists. Philo Judreus writing from Alexandria\na few years B.C. says, \"This alliance with an upper world, of which we are\nconscious, would be impossible, were not the soul of man an indivisible portion\nof the divine and blessed spirit.\" See also Thomas Taylor's translation of some\nof the works of Plotinus.\n3 Here perhaps I may add one line expressive of my own indebtedness to\nand affectionate regard for my dear friend C. C. Massey, whose knowledge of\nall that relates to the higher problems before our Society is more profound\nthan that of any one I know.\n\fxlvIIi.] 347\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nThere is one interesting point in connection with spiritualistic\nphenomena which is worth a little attention. As we are all\naware, the production of these phenomena appears to be in\nseparably connected with some special person whom we call\n\" mediumistic.\" This fact affords perennial amusement to the\nman in the street. But from a purely scientific standpoint\nthere is nothing remarkable in this. Kecent discoveries have\nrevealed the fact that a comparatively few substances possess\nwhat is called radio-active power. Unlike ordinary forms of\nmatter, these radio-active bodies possess an inherent and peculiar\nstructure of their own. There is therefore nothing absurd in sup\nposing that there may be a comparatively few persons who have\na peculiar and remarkable mental structure differing from the\nrest of mankind. Moreover, the pathologist or alienist does not\nrefuse to investigate epilepsy or monomania because restricted\nto a limited number of human beings.\nFurthermore, physical science gives us abundant analogies of\nthe necessity of some intermediary between the unseen and the\nseen. Waves in the luminiferous ether require a material\nmedium to absorb them before they can be perceived by our\nsenses. The intermediary may be a photographic plate, a\nfluorescent screen, the retina, a black surface, or an electric\nresonator, according to the length of those waves. But some\nmedium formed of ponderable matter is absolutely necessary\nto render the actinic, luminous, thermal, or electrical effects of\nthese waves perceptible to our senses. And the more or less\nperfect rendering of the invisible waves depends on the more\nor less perfect synchronism between the unseen motions of the\nether and the response of the material medium that absorbs and\nmanifests them.\nThus we find certain definite physical media are necessary\nto enable operations to become perceptible which otherwise\nremain imperceptible. Through these media energy traversing\nthe unseen is thereby arrested, and, passing through ponderable\nmatter, is able to affect our senses and arouse consciousness.\nNow, the nexus between the seen and the unseen may be\nphysical or psychical, but it is always a specialised substance,\nor living organism. In some cases the receiver is a body in\na state of unstable equilibrium, a sensitive material\u2014like one\nof Sir Oliver Lodge's receivers for wireless telegraphy\u2014and in\n\f348 [pakt\nAddress by the President,\nthat case its behaviour and idiosyncrasies need to be studied\nbeforehand. It is doubtless a peculiar psychical state, of the\nnature of which we know nothing, that enables certain persons\nwhom we call mediums to act as receivers, or resonators, through\nwhich an unseen intelligence can manifest itself to us. And\nthis receptive state is probably a sensitive condition easily\naffected by its mental environment.\nWe should not go to a photographer who took no trouble\nto protect his plates from careless exposure before putting them\nin the camera. And I do not know why we should expect\nanything but a confused result from a so-called medium (or\nautomatist, as Myers suggested they should be called) if the\nmental state of those present reacts unfavourably upon the\nsensitive. Infinite patience and laborious care in observation\nwe must have (as in all difficult investigation), but what good\nresults from any scientific research could we expect if we started\nwith the presumption that there was nothing to investigate but\nimposture ?\nIn connection with this subject of mediumship, it seems to\nme very probable that a medium, an intermediary of some sort,\nis not only required on our side in the seen, but is also required\non the other side in the unseen. In all communication of\nthought from one person to another a double translation is\nnecessary. Thought, in some inscrutable way, acts upon the\nmedium of our brain, and becomes expressed in written or\nspoken words. These words, after passing through space, have\nagain to be translated back to thought through the medium of\nanother brain. That is to say, there is a descent from thought\nto gross matter on one side, a transmission through space, and\nan ascent from gross matter to thought on the other side.\nNow, the so-called medium, or automatist, acts as our brain,\ntranslating for us the impressions made upon it and which it\nreceives across space from the unseen. But there must be a\ncorresponding descent of thought on the other side to such a\ntelepathic form that it can act upon the material particles of\nthe brain of our medium. It may be even more difficult to\nfind a spirit medium there than here. No doubt wisely so, for\nthe invasion of our consciousness here might otherwise be so\nfrequent and troublesome as to paralyse the conduct of our\nlife. It is possible therefore that much of the difficulty and\n\fXLvIIi.] 349\nProfessor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nconfusion of the manifestations which are recorded in our Pro\nceedings, and in the very valuable contribution which Mr.\nPiddington has just given us of sittings with Mrs. Thompson, are\ndue to inevitable difficulties in translation on both sides ? 1\nFurthermore, if my view be correct, that the self-conscious\npart of our personality plays but a subordinate part in any\ntelepathic transmission, whether from incarnate or discarnate\nminds, we shall realise how enormously complex the problem\nbecomes. So that the real person whom we knew on earth\nmay find the difficulty of self-manifestion too great to over\ncome, and only a fitful fragment of their thoughts can thus\nreach us.\nThere is, however, another view of the matter which to me\nseems very probable. The transition from this life to the next\nmay in some respects resemble our ordinary awakening from\nsleep. The discarnate soul not improbably regards the circum\nstances of his past life \" in this dream-world of ours,\" as we\nnow regard a dream upon awakening. If, even immediately\nupon awakening, we try to recall all the incidents of a\nmore or less vivid dream, we find how difficult it is to\ndo so, how fragmentary the whole appears ; and yet in\nsome way we are conscious the dream was a far more\ncoherent and real thing than we can express in our waking\nmoments. Is it not a frequent and provoking experience that\nwhilst some trivial features recur to us, the dream as a whole\nis elusive, and as time passes on even the most vivid dream\nis gone beyond recall ? May it not be that something analogous\nto this awaits us when we find ourselves amid the transcendent\nrealities of the unseen universe ? The deep impress of the\npresent life will doubtless be left on our personality, but its\ndetails may be difficult to bring into consciousness, and we may\n1 Miss Jane Barlow, who has made a close study of these communications,\nwrites to me on this point: \"The almost unimaginable difficulty in com\nmunicating may account for many of the failures, mistakes, and absurdities\nwe notice. I think we are apt to lay too much stress on the want of memory.\nApart from purely evidential considerations, there seems a tendency to regard\nit as a larger and more essential element of Personality than it really is. In\nmy own case, for instance, any trivial cause\u2014a headache, a cold, or a little\nflurry\u2014scatters my memory for proper names.

Hence, whilst in my opinion psychical\nresearch does show us that intelligence can exist in the unseen,\nand personality can survive the shock of death, we must not\nconfuse mere, and perhaps temporary, survival after death with\nthat higher and more expanded life which we desire and mean\nby immortality, and the attainment of which, whatever may be\nour creed, is only to be won through the \" process of the\nCross.\" For it is by self-surrender, the surrender, that is, of\nall that fetters \" What we feel within ourselves is highest,\"\nthat we enter the pathway of self-realisation.

Lloyd Tuckey, 412\nComments by Dr. Robert Jones, 413\nIntroduction.\nBefore giving an account of this remarkable and almost unique\ncase of Multiple Personality, I propose to call attention to a\nfew details of the mechanism of the Nervous System, some\nunderstanding of which is essential for a clear grasp of the\nmain object which I have in view.\nMy object is to demonstrate that the mind or personality\nwhich we call the \" Ego,\" the grand sum total of our character\nand individuality, is capable of disintegration into minor\npersonalities, good and bad, dependent on the condition of the\nbody that sustains them.\nIt follows, therefore, that temporary or permanent brain\nconditions may have an important bearing on the great question\nof individual responsibility.\n\fXLIX.] 353\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nWe have within us three Nervous Systems. The lowest is\nthe Sympathetic system. It consists of two chains of ganglia\ninside the body, in front of the spine : also three principal\nganglion masses, one for the heart, another for the digestive\norgans, and a third lower down. The sympathetic nervous\nsystem controls all our inner organs, but it specially governs\nthe circulation of the blood, down to the smallest blood-vessel,\nand so controls the supply of nutriment to each organ. It\nresembles the Commissariat Department of an Army.\nThe second nervous system consists of the spinal nerves,\nwhich are concerned with the movements of the body and\nlimbs. This represents the Combatant Force of the Army.\nThe sensory nerves are like Scouts, while the motor nerves\nand muscles represent the Fighting Battalions.\nThe third nervous system is the Brain, which reaches its\nhighest development in man, after rising in gradations from\nthe fish and amphibian types through the reptiles and birds\nup to the mammals. It is the Cerebrum, or upper brain,\nthat we may take to represent the Intelligence Department,\nwith the General and his Staff, in a large Army Corps. Just\nas these higher Officers depend for their existence on the\nCommissariat, so the Brain depends for its healthy action on\nthe Sympathetic nervous system. It is this system in disorder\nwhich I describe here.\nSo closely are these Nervous systems interwoven that each\ndepends on the other, and any disunion or want of harmony\nbetween them upsets the whole organism.\nThe surface of the Brain has been mapped out by Ferrier\nand others into areas for the various functions of sight, touch,\ntaste, smell, hearing, and motion. This outer surface, called\nthe Cortex, for the depth of about an eighth to a quarter of\nan inch is of a grey colour, and contains the nerve cells\nwhich form the organic basis of Mind. Under the microscope\nthere are seen five distinct layers of nerve cells in the cortex\nboth of man and of other mammals. These develop gradually\nfrom within outwards, from which one would infer that the\ninner or deeper layers are related to the voluntary protective\ninstincts of the lower animal life. Such is actually the case,\nand it has been shown by Dr. G. A. Watson that in lower\nanimals, such as the rabbit and hedgehog, the more superficial\n\f354 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nlayers are much less developed proportionately than the\ndeeper ones. Dr. Watson also showed that in the lower\nanimals the superficial layer (which from the peculiar shape\nof the cells in it is called the Pyramidal layer) becomes\nthicker as the animal rises in intelligence ; and in man, where\nintellect prevails over instinct, the Pyramidal layer is highly\ndeveloped, and considerably thicker than in any of the lower\nanimals. The extensive researches of Dr. J. S. Bolton have\nfurther shown that in man the thicknesB or depth of this\npyramidal layer bears a distinct relationship to intelligence.\nHe found that in idiots, who from birth never enjoyed reason,\nthis layer was relatively very shallow ; while in the demented\nthere is a decay or dissolution of the pyramidal layer.\nNow, healthy brain action, or Mentation, can only occur if\nthe brain receives a proper supply of blood, both in quantity\nand quality. The quantity is, as I have said, regulated by\nthe Sympathetic nerves. But the quality may be bad, as in\npoisoning by gout, alcohol, morphia, impure air, or mal\nnutrition.\nThose whose functions are judicial ought fully to estimate\nthese statements as facts, not theories. The brain, if poisoned\nby excessive alcoholism, is damaged, and such damage prevents\nthe proper functioning of the individual's original Ego, and\nleads to the formation of a new personality, associated with\ndamaged structure and of lower type, more nearly approaching\nthe brute creation. Our daily observations are thus scientifically\nexplained.\nThe Brain is nourished by the Blood, and receives its\nsupply chiefly from the carotid arteries in front, but also\nfrom the vertebral arteries behind. These large arteries\ndivide and subdivide into smaller branches and twigs (as an\noak tree divides into branches and twigs), penetrating into\nthe brain. The finest arteries or capillaries in the brain will\nonly allow the blood corpuscles to pass along in single file,\nsince they are only about ao1oo of an inch in diameter; but\ndoubtless there is a still finer circulation which our microscopes\nhave not yet been able to reveal.\nBearing in mind this simile of the branches and twigs of\na tree, one can easily imagine how paralysis or loss of function\nof any particular brain area may occur if the branch or artery\n\fXLIX.] 355\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nsupplying that area is blocked from any cause. Thus we\nfind in disease that a clot may shut off the area of speech,\nor the area of movement of a leg or arm, or both. These are\ninstances of permanent destruction or paralysis.\nThe Sympathetic nerves are vaso-motor, and have the power\nof either contracting or dilating the arteries. Thus in blushing,\nthe capillaries dilate. We may also notice in some nervous\npeople peculiar flushes or blotches come and go, usually about\nthe neck or face. Dilatation of the arteries of the brain pro\nduces headache and throbbing ; or if it occurs in the psychic\narea, delirium or mania. A very common, I might say popular,\ndisease is sick headache or megrim. Here the carotid or other\nlarge arteries are in a state of spasm or . contraction, partly\nshutting off the blood supply to the brain, perhaps for hours.\nThe face then becomes cold and pale, and temporary blindness\nand nausea also occur.\nIn other disturbances of the sympathetic nerves we have\n\" dead fingers,\" chilblains, and frost bites from arterial spasm.\nThere is a disease, called after Reynaud, in which by the\ncontraction of the arteries the fingers become blue or purple,\nand if it continues, gangrene may result from arrest of the\ncirculation.\nIf then we can trace the effects of the vaso-motor action\nof the Sympathetic nervous system in coarse structures like\nthe skin,\u2014when it occurs in a delicate organ like the brain,\nand in its most highly developed and sensitive part, we must\nexpect a great variety of mental symptoms.\nHlSTOKY OF THE CASE.\nThe patient, Mary Barnes, who is the subject of this\npaper, was, when I first saw her, aged 12\u00a3 years, having\nbeen born in October, 1882. She always appeared healthy\nin mind and body, and was a well-developed child. Her\nmother is a remarkably healthy woman : her father also is\nhealthy and well built : the other three children are in\nevery way fine specimens.\nIn April, 1895, she caught a chill and developed influenza,\n\f356 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nand was in bed for ten days. She then went out, for the\nfirst time after her illness, on Easter Monday ; but the\nweather was cold and a relapse ensued, and she had to return\nto her bed the next day. On the Saturday she complained\nof extreme headache, which, though at first relieved by pressure,\nbecame worse, until she screamed with the pain, and as the\nsymptoms were aggravated by light and sound, she had to be\nkept in a dark room. She became very weak, was feverish,\nand had \" tache c^r^brale.\" In the second week there was\nless pain, and the attacks became intermittent, and \" shaking\nfits,\" not rigors, occurred. During the second week she grew\nso weak that she had to be fed with a spoon, and often was\nunable to swallow. For two days she was supposed to be\ndying; and once she was thought to be dead, and a woman\nwas sent for to lay her out. This death-like collapse, which\noccurred again on two more occasions, would seem to have\nbeen a phase of one of the abnormal personalities.\nIn the light of subsequent events, and knowing what we\ndo of similar cases of trance, we may suppose that she really\nwas near to dying.\nIn the third week the paiu ceased, but she was still\nsensitive to light, and therefore kept in the dark. In addition,\nshe appeared to be blind, and at times was able to recognise\nher parents only by their voices, or by touch, feeling their\nfaces or even their ears.\n(i) During this third week delirium developed, lasting about\na fortnight. As explained below, I call this condition Bl.\nThe chief characteristic was intense fear of every one,\nincluding her parents ; she called people \" snakes,\" and\nsaid she felt them biting her. Her facial expression was\nterrible. In her ravings she knew no one, and often hid her\nface in the pillow when any one approached. It was not an\nimaginative delirium of the delusional type, nor were there\nhallucinations (erroneous mental impressions without external\ncause), but illusions (misinterpretation of external objects).\nThus, if she saw a fold in the sheet, or touched a hand, she\nat once screamed out \" snakes,\" and tried to get away from it.\nShe showed extraordinary strength in these attacks, which\nwas in curious contrast to her dying condition of a few days\nprevious. She also developed jerking or choreic movements\n\fXLIX.] 357\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nof the legs and arms, and at times general rigidity with\nopisthotonos,1 accompanied by lividity, and even coma. She\nmight have ten to twenty attacks a day. The marvel was\nhow her strength lasted out. This mania, we afterwards dis\ncovered, was characteristic of the abnormal personality, BI.\n(ii) In the fifth week all these symptoms subsided, but her\nmanner changed into that which I afterwards called B2.\nHer intelligence was good and all headache had disappeared,\nso that she was thought to be recovering. She was still in\nbed, as she could not stand, but otherwise had full use\nand control of her muscles. She now, however, took to\nnicknaming all her friends.\nShe called her father\u2014Tom.\nher mother\u2014Mary Ann.\nher sister F.\u2014The gigger (supposed to be giggler).\nthe nurse\u2014Susan Jane.\nher sister A.\u2014Sally.\nher brother F.\u2014George.\nDr. H.\u2014The Jim.\nDr. T.\u2014The Sam.\nThis curious stage was led up to in the first instance by\nthe following incident :\u2014One day whilst reading, or playing\nwith dolls, she began shaking, then, pushing everything away\nfrom her so as to clear a space, said, \"It is coming,\" and\nafter turning a somersault on the bed, sat up and called out\n\"Hullo!\" while those around her noticed an altered facial\nexpression. She would address her family and others by the\nabove nicknames, and talked in a babyish manner, clipping\nher words. She also had a childish, simple, almost silly\nmanner, giggling when spoken to.\nIt was quite apparent that this babyish mood marked the\nemergence of a new personality, for her memory of past events\nwas completely obliterated, nor did she know the names of\nordinary objects. The \" fit \" passed off in about half an hour.\nHer expression would alter, and she frowned and seemed\nvery angry. There would also be sighing and difficult\nrespiration for about a minute, when suddenly she would look\n1 Opisthotonos occurs in lockjaw and some convulsive seizures. The muscular\nrigidity is so great that the patient rests on the heels and the back of the head,\nthe body being arched.\n\f358 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson,\nup with her own natural facial expression and go on as if\nnothing had happened. These fits recurred several times a\nday with increasing frequency, and lasted from ten minutes to\nan hour. There were no premonitory symptoms beyond those\ndescribed. As days and weeks wore on, the normal state was\nof shorter duration ; and indeed so prolonged was the\nabnormal, that I visited her almost daily for ten weeks before\nI saw her in her normal condition.\nFor the sake of simplicity I will here give further particulars\nof this abnormal phase. The patient became childish, clipped\nher words, and had no knowledge of ordinary names, nor of\nher ordinary surroundings. Thus she did not know the\nmeaning of the word \"legs,\" and if you explained, she would\nsay, \" Legs, what legs ? What dat mean ? Dese sings ? Dese\nlong sings?\" and so on. When I said, \"I want you to walk,\"\nshe replied, \" Walk ? What dat, what walk mean ? \" I said,\n\" Get on your feet,\" pointing to them. \" Get on them things ?\nThose feet ? What feet ? Walk, mean get on those things ?\nCan't do it !\" So I lifted her on to her feet, but she could\nnot stand. Her feet gave way, turning outwards. But some\nthings she appeared to know ; thus, she would call a drawing\nslate \" a jawing skate,\" and yet if I touched her nose and\nasked what it was called, she either might not know or would\ncall it her ear. But if I said it was the nose, she would\nargue before she understood. Similarly she called her mouth\nher nose, and her chin her mouth, and her ears were her\neyes. This habit of misnaming things disappeared in a month\nor two ; probably she heard the right names from those about\nher, for in this abnormal condition she would be quite lively\nand bright, though restless. She would turn over books,\nlooking for N's and O's. P she called H, and E, B. She\nalso reversed colours, seeing the complementary colour. Black\nshe called white, green red, and vice versa. She wrote her\nwords backwards, beginning at the tail of each word, and\nwriting it from right to left, but to the right of the word\npreceding it, so that she had to calculate what space would\nbe wanted for each word, which she did with very fair correct\nness, as may be seen from the specimen reproduced (Plate I.).\nThis writing was done with ease and ordinary rapidity, and\nthe total effect of it does not differ from ordinary writing.\n\fXLIX.] 359\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nShe also wrote figures backwards. She could not at first\nwrite to dictation nor originate a word, behaving as if the\nword-centre in the brain were switched off from the writing-\ncentre. She could only tcopy,\u2014the writing-centre communi\ncating with the word-visual-centre.\nBut as weeks rolled on and as her education improved, she\nacquired the power of writing from her own ideas or to\ndictation. This may suggest that in the abnormal state her\nstore-house of word-memories was not empty, but that she lacked\nthe power of association of names with objects. At the same\ntime as this new personality appeared, that is in the fifth\nweek of her illness, catalepsy occurred. The cataleptic fits\ncame on no matter whether she was in the normal or\nabnormal mental condition.\nAs the abnormal personality B2 was a psychic condition,\nwhile the catalepsy was a condition of the muscles, the two\nconditions are clearly not to be regarded as identical. Any\nexcitement, such as a knock at the door, or even the noise of\nmy carriage entering the street, would provoke a cataleptic\nattack. The feet and legs first became rigid, usually extended,\nseldom flexed. Or it might be first one leg and then an arm.\nThe rigidity usually travelled to all the muscles of the body,\nexcept the face and neck. Sometimes she would be fixed up\nlike a ball, so that she could be lifted all of a piece by one\nlimb. Or an arm might become fixed in the attitude of\nfeeding when such an act was in process. I have seen both\narms and hands fixed, holding the cup and spoon, which\ncould not be released. She called the attacks \" brackets,\" and\nthey were evidently painful and frightened her, and during\nthem she dreaded being touched. In five to ten minutes\nthe muscles relaxed spontaneously, and then she was much\nexhausted. These cataleptic fits were very constant for about\nsix weeks to two months, and then became less frequent, so\nthat weeks might pass without an attack. Finally after two\nyears they disappeared.\nIt was not until July 20th, 1895, that I saw her in the\nnormal condition. Her father had brought her to my house\nin a bath chair, as she could not stand. She seemed com\npletely lost, and understood nothing. These vacant periods\nwere very common, and may have been either phases in the\n\f360 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nconditions just described, or forerunners of another abnormal\nsub-stage, in which she was quite an idiot. I now incline to\nthe latter view.\nDuring her visit to my house she suddenly returned to the\nnormal. Her appearance then was that of a modest, pleasant-\nfaced girl. She said \" Good morning, sir,\" and talked quietly\nand rationally for about five minutes. She told me she knew\nnothing of the attacks or of what she said or saw in them.\nShe said she had only seen me once before (this was one day\nwhen she was passing from the normal to the abnormal as I\nentered her bed-room), though she knew from the others that\nI went to see her. Then just as suddenly her expression\nand manner changed. She looked angry and frowned, pouting\nand wearing a much annoyed expression. After that her\nfeatures relaxed ; she smiled and again assumed the vacant\nchildish look, and began talking baby talk. She said Mary\nBarnes (giving her proper name) had gone, and she hated\nMary Barnes, because people liked Mary Barnes better than\nherself. While normal she had risen from her seat and stood\nin an ordinary way ; but as soon as the new personality came\non she lost the support of her ankles, and her father had to\nprevent her falling to the ground.\nLet me now review the first three months of her illness.\nI propose to call her normal state (Mary Barnes) A. The\nabnormal condition I call B. But there were ten abnormal\nstates, more or less different from one another. These I will\ncall B1, B2, to B10.\nThe illness began with influenza, essentially an acute nerve\ndisease : it passed on to meningitis. The highest brain cells\nwe may assume were damaged, perhaps from the toxin, perhaps\nin their nutrition, or from both causes. My first impulse was\nto call it a case of Hystero-epilepsy, which loose term covers\na great variety of conditions, but affords no explanation of\nany of them.\nA medical confrere suggested that she had at some time been\nhypnotised, but this was not the case, and, as I shall show later,\nattempts to hypnotise her entirely failed. Yet her condition\nresembled that of somnambulism or hypnosis ; for her normal\nstate A knows nothing of the abnormal B, while the abnormal\nB has a faint glimmer of the existence of A and of what she\n\fXLIX.] 361\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\ndoes. I observed later that though at first no abnormal stage\nknew anything of any other abnormal stage, yet after a time,\nprobably through hearing conversations, one sub-stage would\nlearn a little of another sub-stage (see, e.g. in Appendix I.,\np. 392, a letter written by B9 on November 22nd, 1896, re\nferring to an incident that had . happened to B2).\nYet, in spite of the failure of the attempts to hypnotise\nher, her father could often by suggestion bring her from the\nabnormal to the normal. By caressing her and addressing her\nby name in a coaxing manner, he would bring her to her normal\nself, though she always relapsed quickly, perhaps in ten minutes\nor perhaps in three minutes. As months rolled on, it became\nmore difficult and finally impossible to effect these brief re\ncoveries.\nB1 was a condition of acute mania, accompanied by intense\nfear, amounting to terror, with illusions of snakes, psychical\nblindness, and great thirst and craving for oranges and lemonade.\nThese symptoms enabled us to diagnose it, not as ordinary\nmania, but, from its sudden recurrence and disappearance, as\na distinct phase of alternating personality.1\nB2 was a stage in which she became a simple child,\nrequiring education in every-day details, and also reversing\nideas or conditions, as in writing, perceiving colours, etc.\nWhen addressed by her proper name, she said it was not\nher name, nor could we find a name to please her ; she said\nshe had no name \u2014she was \" a thing.\" So we called her\nin this stage \" a thing,\" or \" good thing,\" and she always\nresponded to it.2\n1 In acute mania there is overactivity of the pyramidal layer, with con\ngestion of the capillaries.\n2 In this condition spasm of the anterior cerebral artery would deprive the\nprefrontal area of nourishment ; also the motor area of the foot, which was\nalways paralysed. The prefrontal, as the highest psychic and association area,\nmight thus misinterpret all external impressions. Some might explain it as a\nderangement of the mind, reversing objects and misapplying names. The\nmemory of words and names existed, but, if I may so put it, the labels had\ngot mixed. Perhaps the inaction of the prefrontal area would account for\nall the phenomena. Another explanation might be that the more recently\neducated pyramidal cells were shut off by deprivation of blood supply and\nthe deeper layers which had been educated up to the age of four or five\nleft intact, for she now resembled a young child in every way.\n\f362 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\n(iii) On July 24th, 1895, she passed out of B2 into\na third abnormal stage B3, which her parents named \" Old\nNick,\" because she was very passionate and bit her clothes.\nAfter the anger passed off she was very sorry and would say\nit is \" a naughty man,\" and that he only comes for a minute\nand would not bite \" them things,\" touching her face and hands.\nB3 differed from \"a thing\" or B2 in being more educated, for\n\" Nick \" could read and write and had better physical health\nthan the other personalities. B3 was a frequent visitor, staying\nfor several weeks at a time, and I will later give a more complete\naccount of her doings in this stage.\n(iv.) In the B4 substage, which occurred first in August,\n1895, she was a deaf mute. During the attacks she took no\nnotice of loud noises close to her ear: and communicated by\ntalking on her fingers, which method she understood slightly\nin the normal state. This B4 state came on after a prolonged\ncatalepsy, but passed off quite suddenly, changing to B2. But\nin September she was again deaf and dumb for a fortnight.1\nShe changed back from B4 to B2, \" a thing.\"\nOne Sunday in October, 1895, when she was rolling on the\nfloor as B2, crying with toothache, I resolved to extract the\ntooth under chloroform. The late Dr. Althaus had come out\nto see her. After I had extracted the molar, she was\npleased to be relieved of the pain. Her father now brought\nher round to the normal A. She was greatly surprised at\nthe blood and gap in her jaw and asked how it was, as she\nnever as Mary Barnes had felt any toothache and knew\nnothing of the chloroform or extraction.\nSo A was unconscious of B's physical suffering.\n(v) The Bo substage appeared only on one occasion, Novem\nber 2 6th, 1 8 9 5, and lasted until December 2 0th. In this condition\nshe had attacks of paralysis in the legs, became deaf and dumb for\nabout an hour at a time, and lost all memory of events which\nhad occurred more than three days before. She said she had\n\" only been here three days \" and was \" only three days old.\"\nAs I had not seen her for three days, she consequently did\nnot know me. She also reversed things. She called the flame\nof the fire or gas black, black white, and a fat pug thin. She\n1 The spasm of branches of the middle cerebral artery would shut off the blood\nsupply to the centres of speech and hearing.\n\fxlix.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 363\nspelt backwards but wrote forwards. Otherwise she understood\neverything in the house and gave no trouble. She complained\nof pain in the left temple, which suggests spasm of the middle\ncerebral artery.\nOn December 20th her condition changed very suddenly.\nThough just previously paralysed in the legs, she jumped up\nand ran upstairs to her bed. Here she commenced turning\nquickly round and round on her back and shoulders with her\nlegs in the air. She also had a peculiar way of resting on\nher head and trying to walk up the wall. She executed all\nthese movements on her bed, and so peculiar and rapid were\nthey that they resembled an acrobatic performance. Then\ncame the fear of snakes and thirst and we recognised the sub-\nstage B1. This was its first appearance since the meningitis\nin May, 1895. This BI substage of mania lasted three weeks,\ntill January 13th, 1896. There was an exact repetition of\nthe May symptoms, and she remembered exactly all the events\nof May when she had the fever and influenza, while she knew\nnothing of subsequent events. She also complained of headache,\nand asked for the cold water coil which she had had then.\nIn her extreme thirst she would eat any number of oranges in\na ravenous fashion, one after the other, though at no other\nperiod has she cared to eat oranges. She also asked for the\nnurse who attended her in her first illness and whom she had\nnot seen since. After about a fortnight these symptoms passed\noff and she was able to go out in a bath chair, but her mind\nwas still a blank as far as the events of the past seven months\nwere concerned.\nOne curious phenomenon occurred on the evening of January\n12th, 1896. Her memory went back to April, 1895, to the\nearly stage of the influenza, when she had pains in her head,\nbut not the severe symptoms. She said she was Mary\nBarnes\u2014for in mid-April the dual personality had not been\nrecognised. It was an exact repetition of the symptoms, for\nwhen she was ill in April she did not show the normal\nintelligence of Mary Barnes. At 3 a.m. on the following\nmorning she became normal for about an hour, all symptoms\nof influenza disappearing, and again between 8 and 9 a.m.,\nafter which she changed to B2, and, except for a few\nnormal intervals, remained so for three weeks until February\n\f364 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\n7th, 1896. On January 28th, 1896, she wrote as B2 a letter\nto her father (see Appendix I,, p. 387). The letter was\nchildish and the words were spelt phonetically. It is how\never written forwards, for as the result of education B2 now\nwrote forwards usually. On January 22nd, 1896, she was\nshown to the Clinical Society and seen by Drs. Jones, Savill,\nMickle, Bramwell, Althaus, Lloyd Tuckey, and Mr. Barrett. She\nwas then B2, but her father twice brought her to the normal.\nGreat efforts were made to hypnotise her, even with the help of\nchloroform, but all efforts failed and she became much exhausted,\nsighing deeply and flushing, as in hysteria. On March 6th,\n1896, she had an attack of mania\u2014substage B1. It came on\nvery suddenly, when she was in the B2 condition. About 8 p.m.\nshe had said to her father that she felt very ill and wanted\nto go upstairs, and although she then occupied the front bedroom,\nshe ran into the back room which she had occupied in May.\n1895, when she had the first attack of delirium.\nI saw the whole attack. She was jumping on her hands\nand knees on the bed, calling out \" snakes,\" \" nakes,\" and was\ngreatly terrified. The pupils were widely dilated, the face flushed,\nthe pulse very ,rapid and feeble, together with breathlessness and\nconstantly great exhaustion. She would bury her head in the\npillow as if to avoid the snakes ; or at other times, kneel and\nsay her prayers. If we touched her, she called us \" great big\nnakes.\" I tried to fix her gaze, but it frightened her and\nshe put her hand over my eyes saying, \" take them away.\"\nShe devoured oranges like an animal, biting off the peel and\nthrowing it away. The fruit she swallowed greedily in lumps,\ncalling out \" more, more.\" Suddenly the excitement ceased and\nshe sat on the bed, placed on the pillow in front of her a small\nbox, and on the box a book and an orange. She imagined\nherself a fisherwoman, for she called out \" Fish ! fish ! fish \u25a0\nShrimps \u00a3d. each,\" and putting the pillow with its load on her\nhead, called out \" Who'll buy my fish ? \" Then she threw down\n\" the fish \" and tried to walk up the wall, resting first on her\nback, then on her shoulders and finally on her head.\nI tried to rouse her by making as much noise as I could\nclose to her head with a large key and a tin tray. It frightened\nher and she grabbed the key and threw it away. Next I\nshouted to her to wake up : she said she was awake, but took\n\fxlix.] A Case . of Multiple Personality. 365\nvery little notice of anything going on about her. Another\nsudden change and she looked round the room with an air\nof curiosity and said \" This is not my room,\" and as she could\nnot walk, crawled on her hands and knees into the front bed\nroom and climbed on to the bed. As soon as she got on\nthe bed in the front room she changed to the B2 of June,\n1895. She lost the wild maniacal look for the simple childish\nface. She saw me looking round the door and said \" Hullo,\nthere is the new gentleman,\" which was my appellation in\nJune, 1895, nine months earlier. She said she had seen me\nthat morning for the first time. She, however, had not\nseen me that morning, and was probably referring to some\nremote memory of one of my visits in June, 1895, for\nshe said I then had on a black waistcoat with green spots.\nIn reality that June I had on a white waistcoat with red spots,\nthe complementary colours of what she imagined. She was\nvery amiable and asked for a pencil and paper and began\nwriting backwards, as in June, 1895. She called her mouth,\neyes, and her nose, eyes. She said she had no mouth. Though\nvery much exhausted during the B1 state of mania, she seemed\nquite fresh after she changed to the B2 personality. The next\nmorning she knew nothing of the mania and continued in the\nB2 stage. On April 4th she had a violent epileptic convulsion,\nwhich was followed by one or two slighter fits at long intervals.\n(vi) On May 6th the sixth personality appeared. \"We called\nher \" pretty dear \" or \" good creature \" in this stage, as she\nwas a very sweet amiable child, though very ignorant. She had\nto be taught to spell, read and write. She denied ever having\nseen me before. She was rather like B2 (\" a thing \"), but more\ntractable. B2 sometimes showed a mischievous disposition, e.g.,.\nbreaking window panes or putting mustard in her younger\nsister's eye. B6 on the contrary is very kind. Another point\nof distinction was shown later on in that B6 learned a little\nFrench from her father, while neither B2 nor A could learn\nFrench.\nB6 was rather an important personality, for now the normal\nA became a very rare visitor, putting in an appearance perhaps\nonly once a week, while B6 became more permanent, until\nfinally after two years it remained constant and all other per\nsonalities disappeared. Usually B6 has no motor paralysis,\n\f36G [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nand is domesticated and helps her mother. B6 is rather a\nsubdivided personality, for as \" good creature \" she can walk,\nbut as \" pretty dear \" she cannot. \" Pretty dear \" occasionally\nloses the use of her hands.\n(vii) In another six days, on May 12th, the 7th 'personality\nappeared. She called herself \" Adjuice Uneza.\" She only came\nonce and lasted ten days to a fortnight, meanwhile alternating\nwith B2 and gradually fading. The special features of B7\nwere that she had a clear memory of small events of her early\nchildhood, while all memory of and since her illness was obliter\nated. Thus she spoke of going on a tram to the London Hospital\nto see her father, a thing which she really had done in April,\n1885, when two and a half years old, and remembered her\nmother being ill with diphtheria when she was under two. She\nalso remembered the first part of the influenza and also a visit\nto L , but nothing of the relapse or meningitis which\nfollowed in April and May, 1895. B7 could not stand\nor walk.1\nOn May 31st her father brought her to my house as B2 :\nan hour later B7 appeared suddenly and was unable to walk.\nHer father brought her back to my house in a bath chair, and\non her second visit she had no memory of having been in my\nhouse an hour before. When B7 appeared her mind was quite\na blank as to recent events. Thus she did not remember me\nfor some time.\n(viii) On June 20th another severe fit of convulsions occurred,\nin which she never bit her tongue, though violent during them\nand much dazed on recovery. The following morning, June\n21st, she woke up greatly confused and knew no one. She\nsaid she was only born last night and so how could she know\nanything ? However, she knew her father as \" Tom,\" and her\nmother as \" Mary Ann.\" She was very like B5 (which appeared\non November 26th, 1895), but could not be the same, as there\nwas an entire absence of associated memories. This state lasted\nfor about three days and never appeared again. It may have\n1 We know that in some cases of senile decay the memory of early childhood\nstands out clearly. Does not the substage B7 somewhat correspond to this ? I\nwould suggest that from arterial spasm the more superficial cortical layers are\nweakened or paralysed, while the deeper layers with earlier memories are\nstimulated.\n\fxlix.J A Case of Multiple Personality. 367\nbeen no more than a post-epileptic confusion or it may have\nbeen another personality, B8. \u2022\nA prolonged observation of the case has led me to feel sure\nthat A or Mary Barnes, the normal child, knows nothing of\nwhat happens in any of the abnormal states. Whereas in\nsome of the abnormal states, as in B2, there is a faint\nglimmer of knowledge of the normal A. This knowledge of\nthe normal does not begin at once after the transition,\nbut develops later. June, 1896, was a trying month, for\nshe constantly shifted about from one personality to another,\nperhaps three or four times a day, once manifesting three per\nsonalities in five minutes. They also seemed modified at times.\nOn July 8th, B3 or \" Nick \" returned quite suddenly ; she could\nthen as B3 walk or read or write. It was the first time\nshe had been able to walk properly since May 31st. \"Nick\"'\nwas healthier than any other sub-stage. The normal A, Mary\nBarnes, only came momentarily to the surface ; \" Nick \" stayed\nten weeks and showed very interesting phases. As \" Nick \"\nshe went in July, 1896, to the seaside and stayed there about\nfive weeks, getting much stronger on her legs, though this\ntemporary improvement was followed by motor paralysis for\nfive or six weeks. \" Nick \" said that she had never seen the\nsea before this visit, although, as a child, Mary Barnes had\nstayed at the seaside.\nOn August 14th, when at the seaside, her mother was ill\nin bed. Her father cuddled her and called her by name, and\nthus brought her back to the normal state, when she ex\npressed surprise at seeing her mother in bed, and exclaimed,\n\" What ! dear mother ; not out of bed yet ' \" This is a striking\nfact, for in the abnormal B3 stage, as \" Nick,\" she had been\nnursing her mother very attentively, and also had showed great\ndistress at her mother's illness. The next day she returned\nhome, being still \" Nick \" on the journey. When home her\nfather brought her to the normal A : Mary Barnes was greatly\nsurprised to find herself at home, having been unconscious of\nthe journey. Also whilst normal she remembered the normal\nstage of the previous day and seeing her mother in bed. She\nreturned to the seaside in a week, and it was noticed that the\nnormal A, now so rare a visitor, began to come more frequently,\nand that when going down a particular road. So her parents\n2 b\n\f368 . Dr. Albert Wilson. [part\nbegan to suggest to \" Nick \" that Mary Barnes should come as\nsoon as they reached this road. This \" Nick \" resented, and\nlooking cross would walk on so as not to hear ; but in two or\nthree minutes she would run back with her arms out to embrace\nher father, so .pleased to be back again in the normal state,\nclothed and in her right mind. In August, 1896, she bathed\nin the sea. As a child she had done so before : but now as\n\" Nick \" she bathed for the first time.\nSub-stage B3 or \" Nick \" continued from July 8th to Sep\ntember 20th. On Sunday, September 20th, \"Nick\" left at\n2 p.m. during her dinner. The new state was a variation of B6\nand was called \" Tom's Darling,\" Tom being her father's nick\nname in nearly all, if not all, abnormal stages : this being about\nthe only common link, in fact, between the many sub-stages.\nIn this new state as I saw her on the 21st, she had no name;\neverything was upside down, she could not read or write or\nwalk. She was very ignorant of ordinary things and did not\nremember her visit to the seaside. It often happened when a\nnew sub-stage appeared that the mind was an absolute blank\nat first. On the 23rd she called herself, in answer to ques\ntions, \"Tom's Darling.\" On September 26th \"Nick\" returned\nfor half an hour and got her mother's tea ready. A few days\nafter, when \" Tom's Darling,\" B6, she described to me the\nincident of September 20th; she said \"in the middle of dinner\non Sunday ' Old Nit ' went away and ' Tom's Darling ' came.\n' Nick ' was very kind and left me half the dinner.\" \" Nick \"\nate a very good dinner until the change ; but the new person\nality would not finish the dinner, being dazed and mentally\nblank with altered facial expression ; she also lost the use of\nher feet, after having been able to walk for two months. \" Tom's\nDarling\" said the fire was in the bedroom before, so the Tom's\ndarling personality evidently must have appeared at some previous\ntime, and we believe she was a modification of B6, \" Good\nthing \" or \" Good creature.\" It appeared that two or three\nsub-personalities sometimes merged into one, as in this instance.\n(ix) On October 10th \"Tom's Darling \" gradually left and a new\npersonality arrived, B9. The transition seemed to occupy the\nwhole day and was not, as usual, accompanied by any sudden\nphysical disturbance. She had, however, fits of temper, chasing\nher younger sister about, and trying to beat her with a stick.\n\fxlix.] A Case, of Multiple Personality. 369:\nShe talked like a baby, could not walk properly and ' could\nonly manoeuvre about with a chair. She also tried to hit\nevery one with a strap, watching her opportunity, and\nattempted to lock herself into the room. She spoke of things\nwhich had happened in her illness of April, 1895: so she\nmust have been here before, and as her \u2022 parents remember\nsimilar incidents lasting off and on for some days, it is clear\nthat this was not the first development of B9. Her mind\nwas a blank. She said she had no name and did not know\nme. She wrote and spelt backwards like B2. This state\nlasted in 1896 for about a week.\nKnowing how they worried \" Tom Uodd \" (her father), she\ntried to give up her naughty ways. She could speak a little\nFrench, but did not know how she had learnt it. It so happens\nthat only B6 and not even A, Mary Barnes, knew French. She\ntalked of when she was here before, and said she was in\nbed and that \"Jim.\" as she called a particular doctor, used\nto come and see her, thus recalling events which had happened\nin April, 1895. We evidently had not recognised this person\nality in the early mental tumult. Another doctor, whom she\ncalled \"Sam,\" and whom she very much disliked, also came to\nher memory. She happened at this time to see him in the\nstreet and in temper shook her fist at him, which at once\nbrought on an attack of catalepsy. She knew nothing of any\nevents in her life previous to October 10th, 1896, except\nsuch as had happened in April, 1895, during her acute\nmeningitis (?)\nShe at first would read backwards from right to left, making\nnonsense ; but her father soon taught her to read in the proper\nway. Although she regained at times the power of walking,\nshe might be temporarily attacked by paralysis, not only of\nthe legs but of the arms.\nA new feature occurred\u2014a tendency to kleptomania, which\nshe defended on the principles of common and modern socialism ;\n\" if people don't give you things, why, nick it ; quite right\ntoo ! \" One day when in the village she took an apple at\na shop door, but seeing a policeman she went back and re\nplaced it. She was always threatening to steal, but after a\ntime, on being told it was wrong, was sorry. During this sub-\nstage B9, \"Nick,\" or B3, appeared for a day in October 16th.\n\f370 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nAfter \" Nick \" left, though confused, she seemed to know that\nshe had been in a different condition. This might be aided\nby the free amount of talking around her. The same evening\nshe walked up to my house as B3 or \" Nick.\" She wished\nto show me a present, a toy wigwam, which had been given\nher an hour before. Suddenly B9, the retrograde state, arrived.\nHer face altered, and she would have fallen from the chair\nbut for help, as she had lost the power in her legs. The\ntoy fell from her hands, and when the first dazed condition\nhad passed off, I picked it up and tried to interest her in it,\nbut she did not care for it, and said she had never seen it\nbefore. When the former state B3 returned, she again was\ninterested in the toy. The next day she was B9, and so\nremained for another fortnight. If asked her name she said\nshe had no name. She was frightened by thunderstorms, and\nafter one had an attack of catalepsy. Yet B3, \"Nick,\" likes\nthunderstorms.\nOn October 31st she awoke in the B1 or maniacal state. She\nwas dazed and knew no one. She had intense headache, beating\nher head and screaming with the pain. She jumped about the\nbed, and was violent, even breaking things. There was also\ncatalepsy. In one severe attack the feet and legs were drawn\nup behind over the back, and the arms over the shoulders, so\nthat she caught hold of her toes with her fingers. She screamed\nwith the pain, but we could not loosen her. Strange to say\nshe slept well. One peculiar feature was the approximation\nof Bl to B9. The numbering of the sub-stages is not correct\naccording to their appearance in time. We had not recognised\nB9 till autumn, 1896 ; but it had in reality existed in April,\n1895, just before Bl appeared in the same month. So the\nsequence was like the repetition of a cycle, yet not an orderly\nsuccessive repetition. From B1 she changed to B2, and in\nthe B2 state she had toothache, and for the second time I\ngave her chloroform and drew the offending molar. Previously\nas B2 she took chloroform well, but this time there was\nrespiratory spasm and collapse, requiring artificial respiration.\nThere was some discharge excited from the motor centres as\n\u2022evinced by muscular spasms and general rigidity and opistho\ntonos, the patient rising on her heels when we tried to hold\nher on the couch. The great effort produced collapse, when\n\fXLIX.] 371\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nshe fell back livid and respiration ceased. She soon recovered\nwith the help of artificial respiration and was quickly\nconscious.\nAs confirming the theory of the repetition of former cycles,\nshe passed gradually from B1 to B2 during November 19th\nor 20th. She called herself \"A thing,\" and had the same\nchildish way as previously described, and also the same\nmemories. For the space of about a fortnight she was very\nill and unsettled, changing without apparent rhyme or reason\nfrom B1 to B2 or B9, occasionally becoming cataleptic and\nadopting all sorts of attitudes and manifesting cutaneous\nhyperesthesia, the slightest tickling causing pain. The normal\nA appeared occasionally for about five minutes at a time, and\nthen disappeared. When calm, the patient could now walk\nor sit for two or three hours at needlework, drawing, reading\nor writing. She talked baby talk like B2, and called herself\n\" nothing \" like B2. Then the destructive fits would come\non (B9) and she called herself \" the dreadful wicked creature.\"\nApparently she regretted doing wrong, but could not help it,\nthough she knew at the time the evil thereof. Are we not\nall built on the same lines ? As \" wicked creature,\" B9, she\nwould hit any one near her, or push them aside if in her\nway. She was also destructive, especially putting articles\nlike slippers in the fire. At a later period when in this con\ndition she tried to put her little sister on the fire, and\nwould have succeeded if her mother had not entered the\nroom. Does not this show how mental lapses may remove\nconsciousness of surroundings and responsibility ? From\nNovember 1st to December 10th, 1896, she was generally\nB2, \"good thing,\" or B9 ; from December 10th to 29th, she\nwas B6.\n(x) In the evening of December 29th, 1896, she gradually\nchanged. She sat on the hearth-rug, was cross and stupid,\nand finally her mind became a blank. This condition,\nwhich I have called sub-stage B10, developed in the course\nof the next two or three days till she became a blind\nimbecile. There was now no excitement, only apathy. She\nsat quiet by the hour, absolutely blind, with a vacant,\nstupid expression. She understood nothing, and at times\nappeared to be deaf. Her speech was incoherent, and she\n\f372 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nused very few words. She called out : \" Mutter,\" \" Tom \" (her\nfather), and also \" Picters.\" There seemed to be paralysis of\nthe ocular muscles, as the eyes protruded and stared, and the\npupils were widely dilated. She was guided only by touch\nand sound. If I handed her a piece of paper the rustle\nguided her, and she grabbed at it. Sometimes she would\nsit for hours rolling beads on a tray.\nOn January 3rd, 1897, about 2 p.m., she was observed\nto be drawing with a pencil. As she was drawing correctly,\nit was thought that sight had returned. But it was not so.\nIt is remarkable that while Mary Barnes, the normal A,\nnever could draw at all, this blind personality, B10, could\ndraw perfectly. Was this a hereditary ancestral faculty\nsuddenly called into exercise, or an unknown latent power ?\nShe used to draw the fashion plates or pictures which one\nsees in the illustrated papers. They were very well done,\neven to small details of laces and patterns, etc. At a\nlater stage she began colour-drawing with crayons. She\nwas absolutely blind, as was proved by placing books\nbetween her eyes and the paper, which made no difference\neither to the rapidity or accuracy of her performance. We\nalso proved that she was guided by touch. If the drawing\nwas pulled away, she would put out her left finger and ask\nfor it to be placed on the part she had been drawing by\ncalling out the name, say the veil or nose. Then if her\nfinger was so placed, she would resume. Later she became\nso sensitive that she could herself detect by touch where\nthe pencil marks were, and if the paper was shifted could\nbegin again correctly.1\nIn fact, ten weeks after the blindness came on she was able\nto copy by touch. Her general intelligence was then improved,\nthough the blindness continued. If one drew a pencil line\ni Anatomically we must divide sight into two elements, sensory and psychic.\nIn this stage, BIO, the area of sensory vision was quite paralysed. Extreme\naction of the sympathetic would cause dilatation of the pupil, and if it also con\nstricted the circulation in the area supplied by the posterior cerebral artery, it\nwould shut off the corpora quadrigemina and the lower part of the occipital lobe\nand calcarine areas, .which are connected with sensory vision. Whereas, since\nshe could draw, she must have been guided in so doing by her psychic visual\ncentre, which is situated in the occipital area, this being supplied by the middle\ncerebral artery. (See Plate IX.)\n\fxlix.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 373\nacross her picture, she would detect it by touch and rub it\nout. It was very strange to see her feeling the copy with\nthe left fingers and drawing with the right. She copied\nwriting in the same way. She could feel the red ink lines\nruled on foolscap. Sometimes we thought she could see, for\nin drawing in colours she would hold the crayons so close to\nthe eye that they would sometimes touch the cornea, which\nat this stage was completely insensitive.\nShe would also write verses and names from memory, as if\nthe word memory centre was restored to her. Yet she had no\nmemory of past events or of spelling. One day when she\nseemed brighter and I said to her write \" L-A-U-Y, Lady,\"\nshe wrote \" Lady,\" and said, \" It is not L-A-D-Y, it is Lady.\"\nShe could write her name in a block, but mentally did not\ndisconnect or isolate the letters. In other words, she could\nnot spell. One day in January she completely and suddenly\nregained her sight for about two minutes. She called to her\nsister, \"I can see you.\" Her sister said, \"What am I doing?\"\nshe replied correctly, \" You are combing your hair.\" Her\nintelligence with regard to her surroundings improved, but she\nwas practically an idiot. If I called to her loudly \" Wake\nup,\" she laughed vacantly and replied, \"Is awake.\" If I\nsaid, \" You are asleep,\" she replied with apparent indifference,\n\" Not sleep.\" She, however, did not know what hands and\nfeet were.\nOn January 16th, 1897, the normal A appeared three or\nfour times for about two minutes at a time. She could see,\nbut could not walk, though normal. Once she said she felt so\nwell and comfortable. Is that not incomprehensible ? Another\ntime she told her mother she felt \" sometimes to be dying\nand to go right away.\" This was said in an abnormal state,\nand appeared to refer to the changing period, either from\nnormal to abnormal, or vice versa.\nShe has always called me \" the voice \" when in this\n\" imbecile \" state : perhaps because I shouted at her. She\nwrote me several letters signed C Tom's Lamb.\" On January\n25th, when she was unable to stand, I commanded her very\nfirmly and persistently to do so, and with success. After\nthis the power gradually returned after an absence of three\nto four weeks. '....'..,, . .\n\f374 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nTowards the end of January, 1897, after four weeks' blind\nness, she began to improve, not only in intelligence, but also\nin sight. She was very short-sighted, but could see colours\nand pictures at a distance of three inches. She could not\nsee about a room, and had to feel where she was going. This\nwe proved by several games at hide and seek, which did not\nplease her when she was tricked. She was sufficiently blind\nto walk against the wall. Ophthalmoscopically the eye is and\nwas normal. Mr. Tweedy kindly examined her eyes, and\nwrote the following report of them :\nFeb. 8th, [1897].\nI have examined Miss [Barnes's] eyes. The media are clear, the\ndiscs and fundus healthy ; the refraction of the eyes is also prac\ntically normal, there being merely a slight degree of myopia in the\nleft eye. The eye-lids were widely open and seemed spasmodically\nretracted, as in cases of ex-ophthalmic goitre. The child seemed\nunable to see anything at more than 2 feet away, but she could\nread words of the smallest print (No. 1 Jaeger) at about 3 inches\nfrom the eye. There is, however, nothing in the eye to explain\nthe peculiar nature of her sight.\nJ. Tweedy.\nWhen using the ophthalmoscope, if the light appeared to\nfocus on the yellow spot, the normal A, Mary Barnes, returned,\nbut only momentarily. \" A \" still came occasionally, and saw\nand walked quite well. B10 was still very ignorant,\u2014for\ninstance, not knowing what a horse or dog was. Nor was she\nanxious to learn, usually answering \" nothink \" to any question.\nShe knew the parts of her face, but not her legs or arms.\nShe was, however, very amiable, and had a good memory for\nthings happening daily. In February she was able to go about\nthe house, though supervision was necessary. B10 differed\nfrom all other sub-stages, in that she did not know her way\nabout the house. This is a special point which distinguishes\nB10 from the other personalities. She had to learn not only\nthe position of the rooms, but also the position of the\nfurniture. Before she learned this she was once stopped from\nwalking down the cellar stairs, which she thought were on\nlevel ground.\nHer method of counting was unique. Her numerals were\nlimited to 1-2, 1-2, 1-2. She counted in pennies, which she\ncalled \" brownies,\" up to a shilling, or a shilling and so many\n\fXLIX.] 375\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\n\" brownies.\" I asked her how much is twice six. She worked\nit out on paper thus:\nand then said a shilling. If I asked her how much is twice\neight, she would work out the answer as a shilling and four\n\" brownies.\" It was a little complicated.\nOnce when I asked her very quickly to count her fingers,\nshe, automatically touching each finger, said 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; but\nquickly corrected herself and said, \"No, that's wrong; 1, 2;\n1, 2; 1, 2.\" Seeing that it did not fit, she began again,\n\" 1, 2,\" then a pause, repeating \"3,\" adding, \"three, what's\nthat?\" then she added \"four,\" and, surprised at herself, said\n\"five.\" Apparently the automatic sub -consciousness was\naroused. But if one gave her four biscuits, she would count\nthem \" 1, 2, 1, 2.\"\nA curious link with her past memory occurred in the fol\nlowing incident : She was very constipated, and asked that\n\" the voice \" (that is, myself) would give her something, but\nnot salts. As B10 she had no knowledge of salts, but she\nhad had salts about a year earlier, I cannot say in what\npersonality. I hoped to show her in this state to the\nClinical Society, but she had altered to B6 or B2, it was\nnot quite clear which. This was on February 26th, 1897.\nBut in the middle of March she returned to the imbecile\nstate B10, and was even worse than before ; for she\nwas paralysed, blind, deaf and dumb. She kept on mut\ntering \" do, do, do.\" The only way to feed her was to\ntouch her with a tray ; she would then feel for and\npick up the food : sometimes she would feel for her mouth\nand guide it in. At other times she would miss her mouth\nand get the food over her shoulder, which made her very cross.\nWe find the same feature in disseminated sclerosis, where\nthere in an interrupted communication between the nerve\nroots in the bulb and the motor centres which ought to act\nin harmony. In such cases vision plays an important pare.\nHere such aid was absent. The parents used to place her\nleft hand to the mouth, and with the right she would feel the\nway along her fore arm. In three or four days she began\n1 . 2\n1 . 2\n1 . 2\n1 . 2\n\f376 [part\nBr. Albert Wilson.\ndrawing again, her touch for guiding and copying being more\nacute than before (see Plates IV., V., and VI. for reproduc\ntions of drawings made during this period). On March 25th\nshe left off drawing and took to sewing, working till she\nwas exhausted. She then altered during the next days. For\ntwo days her jaws were tightly closed ; then she became limp,\nand had no power in any part. In whatever pose any limb\nwas placed, so it remained. Often she could not swallow, and\nsometimes she was comatose. This resembled her state during\nthe second week of the influenza, when she was laid out as\ndead. When she was in one of these exhausted conditions\non April 4th, the nurse was in the next room and heard her\ncall out, \" What am I in bed for ? \" Nurse ran to her, and\nthe patient said again, \" What am I in bed for ? Don't you\nknow I am Nick ? \"\nNick had left six and a half months before, on September\n20th, 1896, at 2 P.M., in the middle of the family dinner\ndownstairs. It was now about two in the afternoon, and also\nSunday, and the family were at dinner downstairs. She smelt\nthe dinner, and thought it was the same dinner she had left on\nSeptember 20th. It was a curious coincidence that both days\nhappened to be Sundays, and the hour the same. She wanted\nto go down to finish her dinner, and said to her parents,\n\" You have been quick in getting my nightgown on. What\nam I in bed for ? I am quite well.\" She had been so criti\ncally ill, half an hour before that, though she was very hungry,\nthey only gave her very little food. In the afternoon she got\nup, dressed, and walked about, but was weak, not having been\nable to stand for three weeks (since March 14th).\nTwo or three features in this incident are very striking.\nThus in one personality, B10, she is exhausted and collapsed,\nwith no appetite, hardly able to swallow, and unable to stand.\nThe instant that the new personality B3 is switched on, the\nexhaustion disappears : she is very hungry, and can walk.\nAgain, whereas B10 could draw beautifully, B3 as \"Nick\" did\nnot possess the art, and could only make ugly scrawls, and\neven these were rather forced from her (see Plate VII., Fig. 1).\nWe always found that the memory of one personality con\ntinued from the last appearance of that same personality.\nThere was thus a continuity of the same personality ; but\n\fXLIX.] 377\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\neach one was ignorant of every other one. To test this, her\nfather brought out the wigwam toy when she became \" Nick.\"\nShe at once recognised it. It will be remembered that she\nhad it at my house on October 16th, 1896, and changed her\npersonality while playing with it, at the same time throwing\nit down. She now said, \" Oh yes, I remember now ; I have\nbeen here once since I went to sleep on the Sunday, and I\nwent to sleep again at Dr. Wilson's.\" The former date was\nSunday, September 20th, and the return (at my house) was on\nOctober 16th, 1896.\nOn May 13th, 1897, she changed from \"Nick \"or B3, to\nB6 or \"good creature.\" She remembered meeting me in the\nstreet on her way from church, and gave the details. It re\nferred to my meeting her on December 27th, 1896, when she\nwas B6. She said now, that to-day was Monday and that yester\nday she went to church alone and met me as she came home.\nEvidently that was the last time she had been B6 or \"good\ncreature.\" I thought there was a mistake on her part, as\nSunday was December' 29th ; but there was no mistake, and the\nincident as she described it was correct. We found that she\nremembered nothing after Sunday evening, December 29th,\nwhen she had been put to bed early, as she was poorly. A\nchange in personality was developing. This personality could\nonly draw imperfectly, and could not equal the performance of\nthe blind stage (see Plate VII., Fig. 2). After she had drawn a\npicture we brought her to the normal A, when she expressed\nsurprise, and said she never knew she could draw. \" Nick \"\nwould not try to draw, except once or twice.\nAs B6, the \"good creature,\" she went to the Jubilee Proces\nsion in June, 1897, and took an intelligent interest in it.\nOne of my assistants, Dr. Taylor, of Perth, who knew her well\nduring the first year, before B6 appeared, saw her there, but\nshe never remembered having seen him before.\n, Though the date was June 27th, she maintained that it\nwas only about a month since Christmas, the reason being\nthat it was Christmas time when she was last in this B6\npersonality, and she had now been about five weeks in the\nsame personality. This shows again how each sub-stage is con\ntinuous with the same and ignores the intervening events.\nShe also said that she could not understand there being Mowers\n\f378 [part\nDr. Albert Wihon.\nin January, so near Christmas, and why people would say it\nwas June ; that she had never seen the sea, but had heard\nabout it, and would like to go there. She never had been B6\nat the seaside. She deeply resented an effort made at this\ntime to get her into a hospital for observation, and as a con\nsequence became very ill and changed to a state of dementia.\nShe declared she was quite well, and resented the idea of the\nhospital.\nFour days later (on June 30th) she changed to \"Nick\" or\nB3, about tea time. She at once asked why the lamps were\nnot lit, because when \"Nick\" left on May 13th it was 9.30\np.m., and the lamps were lit. She also said that her father\ncalled Mary Barnes, and so she went to sleep (on May 13th),\nand woke up to-day (June 30 th). She seemed usually to have\nthe idea, when one personality left, that she had gone to sleep :\nbut when she went to sleep on May 13th it was 9.30 p.m.,\nand her father was having his supper. She said when she\nwoke up there was a different tea on the table, and Tom\n(her father) was gone.\nShe continued as B3 or \" Nick \" through August, and went\nto the same seaside resort as before. She was the same per\nsonality as when at the sea the year before, and now learned\nto swim.\nOn August 22nd she changed without any physical disturb\nance to the normal A, and then to \" good creature,\" or B6.\nShe then referred to having seen me with my assistant, Dr.\nTaylor, and spoke as if this had occurred the previous night,\nwhereas in reality it was on June 25th, on which date B6\nhad been in evidence. But the memory of her visit to the sea\nside this month was entirely obliterated. She said that she\nhad never bathed for fear of being drowned.\nShe argued that she was only two years old (about the\nlength of time B6 had been present), and could not under\nstand people saying she was 15. She only remembered two\nChristmas days.\nIn November she had another attack of mania (B1) which\nlasted a fortnight. Then she became \" good creature \" again,\nand remained so until March 24th, 1898, when she altered to\nthe demented state B9. B9 lasted three or four weeks, when\nshe again became B6 or \" good creature.\" We could not now\n\fXLIX.] 379\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\ninduce A to return. If her father tried she became uncon\nscious and fell down : so we feel we have said good-bye to the\nnormal \" A \" or Mary Barnes, and ever since she has been\n\" good creature \"or B6. She is intelligent, and has learned\ntypewriting, and is making her own way.\nSumming up the relationship of the different stages to one\nanother, we may say that B2 represents a rough child, almost\na waif, of 3 or 4 years old. B6 seems like the same child,\nmore advanced in intelligence and refinement, though young\nfor her age. B4 and B8 are like first cousins. B5 and B7\nalso seem closely related, but complementary to one another,\nas B7 remembers very remote incidents and Bo only very\nrecent ones. B9 is, I think, an offshoot of Bl. B3 and\nB10 stand by themselves.\nAbout 1900 I met Mary Barnes with her father. Her\nmanner was childish, like that of B6. When I asked her if\nher name was Mary Barnes, she said she supposed so, as her\nfather said that was her name, and at the present time\n(February, 1904) she continues to say that she is Mary\nBarnes.\nShe is now to all appearances a healthy normal young woman.\nShe is quite intelligent, and all her ideas are refined ; but on\nexamination one finds her memory is very bad, and though she\nremembers as far back as 1898, nearly all her previous life\nis a blank, including the years before her illness. I tested her\nmemory as to various events which happened in the abnormal\nstages other than B6, and she had apparently no recollection\nof them ; whereas events which happened in the B6 stage\nshe now remembers. Thus she clearly remembers having seen\nDr. Tuckey when she was B6 : but she does not remember\nDr. R. Jones, or Dr. Savill, Dr. Mickle, Dr. Bramwell, Mr.\nBarrett, Mr. Tweedy, Dr. (now Sir) T. Barlow, who saw her\nwhen she was B2, and B3, and B9. Also she knows a\nlittle French, which is as it should be, since B6 was the only\npersonality besides B9 who knew any French. She does not\nremember the acute illness which started the alternations of\npersonality ; nor does she remember her childhood before then.\nHer father said in 1900 that she did not know her old\nschoolfellows, and her memory of school was a confused\n\f3S0 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nblank: Of course, many impressions of her childhood have\nnow been revived by intercourse and associations since she\nbecame B6 ; but this, after all, only serves to make her\nmemory of the past even more confused.\nTheory of Cerebral Changes connected with\nChanges of Personality.\nWhilst many theories have been suggested to explain the\npsychical aspect of multiple personality, I am anxious to put\nforward some evidence of a pathological disturbance of the\nSympathetic nervous system, which may throw some light on\nits physical aspect. To comprehend this subject we must\nconsider some of the facts of brain evolution and development.\nThe most recent and reliable data we have are due to the\nresearches of Dr. Bolton and Dr. G. A. Watson. Some of their\nwork is at present unpublished, but I have permission to use\ntheir results for this paper.\nI must first explain that a typical section through the cortex\nof the brain shows us five distinct layers of different kinds of\ncells, as indicated in Plate VIII. These layers are only\nfrom I to \\ of an inch thick. So they literally resemble\nthe rind or bark of a tree, hence the term \" cortex.\" Under\nthe microscope one sees in them cells of varying shapes giving\noff fibres. At one time these cells used to be compared to\nelectric batteries, where an impulse passes to a cell by a\nwire, and the cell discharges force through another wire.\nThe simile remains sufficiently good for purposes of popular\ndemonstration.\nIt has been shown that the general evolution of the\ncortex is from within outwards, the inner or deeper layers\nbeing the first to be developed, both in the vertebrates\nas a whole, and also in the individual. Dr. Watson, who\nhas especially studied mammals in this respect, finds that\nin them the deepest, i.e., the polymorph, layer is highly developed.\nThe higher pyramidal layer (so called from the shape of its\ncells), which relates to intellect, is comparatively undeveloped ;\nit contains few cells ; they are irregularly distributed, and many\n\fxlix.] A Case, of Multiple Personality. 381\nof them are of the embryonic type, suggesting possibilities not\nyet achieved^ In the Rabbit, the layer is specially poor; in\nCaraivora, it is more highly evolved, and in monkeys still\nmore so (see diagram of sections through the cortex of man\nand of the rabbit, Plate VIII.). i\nIn Man the polymorph layer is much the same as in the\nlower animals, showing that we are no better equipped than,\nthey for a merely animal existence,\u2014this layer being concerned\nwith the instincts for self-preservation, and so on. In extreme\ndements, who had lost all their normal instincts, Dr. Bolton\nfound that the polymorph layer was in process of decay.\nOn the other hand, in passing from the lower animals to\nman, Dr. Watson found a progressive evolution in the pyramidal\nlayer, which is related to intellectual development. Dr. Bolton\nfound this layer very thin and shallow in imbeciles and the\nfirst to decay in dements. It represents the higher intellectual\ncontrol over the lower strata, which are devoted to the instincts\nand the senses. But in the human brain, on the more superficial\nor outer part of this layer, as if suggesting future evolution,\nthere are many rudimentary or half-developed cells of what\nis called the embryonic type. Dr. Watson considers that this\nindicates that the human brain has not yet reached its highest\ndevelopment, and is capable of higher evolution, the longer\nthe human race persists. To his opinion I would add the\nclause : provided our social and educational conditions are\nimproved, especially by putting a check on the drinking habits\nso prevalent now in all classes, and so potent a cause of nerve\ndegeneration. But whilst offering possibilities of higher educa\ntion or development, these embryonic cells are likewise the first\nto decay, being more or less unstable.\nNow if we suppose the same general principle of growth\nthat governs the whole cortex to apply also to the pyramidal\nlayer, it will contain, say, 10 strata of cells, of which Nos. 1^\n2, and 3 (counting from within outwards or below upwards)\nare more ancestral or ancient than Nos. 8, 9, and 10, and\ntherefore more stable. Against this, some will argue that at\nbirth all strata are laid down simultaneously. But functionally\n8, 9, and 10 are delayed, for they contain many of these\nembryonic cells, which are not apparent in Nos. 1, 2, and 3,\nand which in some people continue embryonic in type, per\n\f382 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nmanently. Also in incipient dementia and in an alcoholic\ncase which I examined, where brain power was failing, it was\nthe top layers, 10, 9, and 8, which were disappearing. In the\nalcoholic case, these external cells of the pyramidal layer had\nbeen destroyed. At the same time the patient had become\ndepraved. Her higher mental ideation or true Ego had dis\nappeared. She had stepped down from her original personality\nto a much lower grade.\nThis is an extreme case, but it suggests a physical explanation\nof mental deterioration and altered personality, with loss of\nresponsibility.\nApplying these facts to the case of the B6 personality, then,\nI would consider that the influenza toxin or the meningitis\nhad damaged the extreme surface or top of the pyramidal layer,\nand so prevented the higher mental development which occurs\nbetween puberty and adolescence. The case now resembles one\nof neurasthenia. The patient complains of bodily weakness ;\nshe soon gets tired ; there is loss of memory ; brain fag ;\nexhaustion after mental effort, and want of power of application ;\nyet her intelligence and moral faculties are unimpaired. Does\nnot this case throw some light on the condition of neurasthenia,\nfor we know that the latter often occurs through derangement\nof internal organs which are controlled by the sympathetic\nnerves ? Just as the finger tips in neurasthenic people are\nbenumbed by arrested circulation, so the sympathetic disturbance\nin the brain circulation may arrest the functional activity of\nwhat we may provisionally term the \" brain tips,\" or most\ndistant and external parts of the brain.\nThe chief features of scientific interest in this case are:\n(1) That the normal A was absolutely ignorant of the\nabnormal B, and, on the whole, vice versa, although the ab\nnormal B sometimes showed a glimmer of knowledge of the\nnormal A.\n(2) Among the many abnormal sub-stages, each sub-stage\nwas a separate personality, continuous with itself throughout\nits different appearances, and originally ignorant of every other\nsub-stage, though sometimes learning a little about the incidents\nof other stages, probably through hearing conversations.\n(3) These personalities were switched on and off without\nany apparent rhyme or reason. During the process of change\n\fxlIX.] 383\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nthere was generally some physical disturbance, such as shock,\npallor or flushing, and alteration of facial expression.\nSome would call this a case of somnambulism, and would\nmaintain that the normal A is now merely asleep. This is\nnot my view. I hold that each of the sub-stages is as much\nan individual or character as the normal A, each of them\nbeing merely a fraction of the complete personality or Ego.\nFrom this point of view, it seems to me that the case throws\nnew light on the mechanism of the brain, and its relation to\nmind and personality.\nIt is generally known that the brain is mapped out into\nfunctional areas, viz., Sensory areas receiving impressions of\nsmell, sight, taste, touch, and hearing ; also Motor areas to\ndirect the movement of different parts of the body.\nThere are besides three areas called association centres :\nthe frontal, the temporal, and the parieto-occipital area behind.\nAs the name indicates, these associate or bring into harmonious\nco-operation the other active nerve groups (see Plate IX.,\nrig. i).\nThe association areas represent the higher intellectual or\nmental grades, and Dr. Bolton considers that they are the first\nto decay. These higher centres contain a large proportion of\nembryonic or rudimentary cells, showing that they are still in\nprocess of evolution. Dr. Watson has shown that the cortex\nof the human and the rabbit's brain are about equal in depth,\nexcept in the association areas, which in the rabbit are only\nhalf the depth or thickness of similar parts in man.\nMy hypothesis assumes that the pyramidal layer of the\nbrain may be divided as a whole or in part into \" districts.\"\nDiagrammatically we may conceive of these districts as\nbeing different levels in the cortex, especially in the asso\nciation areas, the deeper inner ones representing more\ndeveloped stages than the upper levels, because they are\nfunctionally older. Thus we may suppose there is a low\nlevel or district corresponding to the age of three or four ;\nhigher up would be the district coming into play at the\nage of twenty ; a still higher one would become active at\nthirty, and so on ; each in turn superseding and taking\ncommand of the lower districts. In senile decay we see\nthe reverse process occurring ; the upper layers decaying\n2c\n\f384 [PART\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nor falling out of use, and the lower ones coming into play\nagain.\nNow these different districts may be supposed to correspond\nto different personalities. As a rule there is no apparent\nbreak in character as the individual grows up, because the\nchange from each district to the next is gradual and con\ntinuous. But morbid conditions in the brain may throw back\nthe individual to earlier stages, from which he may suddenly\nrevert to others, or the later stages may be prevented by\nmorbid causes from developing.\nIn the case of Mary Barnes, B1, the stage of mania, might\nbe caused by congestion of the smaller blood-vessels, giving\nrise to an over-stimulation of the cortex.\nIn B2 spasm of the anterior cerebral arteries would shut\noff the frontal association centre, and paralyse the foot\n(see diagram of arterial blood-supply, Plate IX., Fig. 2).\nIntellectually B2 was a child of three or four. Though she\nhad a storehouse of words, she could not use them or associate\nthem with their proper meanings.\nB4, the deaf-mute stage, might be caused by spasm of the\nmiddle cerebral arteries, supplying the centres for hearing and\nspeech\u2014perhaps only on the left or active side.\nB7 resembled a state of senile decay. If the recently educated\nlayers were paralysed, the lower cells with their early\nmemories might become active.\nB10 is easily explained by the shutting off of the blood\nsupply to the sensory visual apparatus, the psychic visual\ncentre, which has a different blood supply, being undisturbed.\nHence she could originate the remarkable pictures described\nabove. B10 gives strong support to my vascular theory.\nIn B9, where the lower animal instincts prevailed, there\nwas probably uncontrolled activity of the deeper layers of the\ncortex with temporary paralysis of the upper layers. The\ntheory would support the view that all our bad impulses are\nrelics of our earliest ancestral development ; or, in other\nwords, the power of animal instincts and passions over intellect.\nOn the other hand, the present stage of B6, which seems,\nintellectually at least, to be in some respects more highly\ndeveloped than the original normal stage A, may only be\nthe normal increase of brain activity during the last three or\n\fXLIX.] 385\nA Case of MvMiple Personality.\nfour years. We must also remember that B6 is an arrested\ndevelopment. Now in 1904 Mary Barnes is actually 21\nyears of age, but she is intellectually only about 16 years\nold. In theory one would expect that the outer, less stable\ncortical cells, which are also embryonic and poorly developed,\nhave not arrived at their full and normal activity. Vascular\nchanges in the sympathetic might retard their development.\nThe whole conception is consistent with Mr. Myers's theory\nof the constitution of the Ego, according to which only a\nportion of it is manifest to us in our present life. While the\nwhole Ego remains intact, one portion or another may become\nmanifest according to different physical conditions and the\nenvironment of the individual, so presenting the appearance\nof a truncated personality or shifting series of personalities.\nWhat has to be attempted, then, in our present life is to\nfacilitate the manifestation of the best personality of each Ego.\nIf so be that the mind comprises so many personalities,\ngood, bad, and indifferent, does it not shed light on the duties\nof those who have the training of the young?\nThis case having led us to the belief that the varying\npersonalities may to some extent be explained by a fuller\nknowledge of the structure of the brain cortex, also throws\nnew light on the psychical question of habit.\nThe more recent ideas on habit are that it represents the\npath of least resistance along nerve channels. It is thought\nthat constant use overcomes nerve resistance both in the fibres\nand at the junctions or synapses of the different neurones.\nThis theory is based on the knowledge that sensory tracts\nleading to the brain do not become active or insulated (myelin\nated) until stimulated from without. It is, however, contrary to\nthe laws of conductivity and resistance in copper and other metals.\nBut if we consider habits involving skill, such as writing\nor piano playing or carving, are we to suppose that the optic\nnerves conduct better after two or more years' practice ? Is\nit not rather that the visuo-psychic areas are more educated ?\nDo the nerves from the cortical motor areas really conduct to\nthe hand and fingers with more facility after years of practice ?\nOr are not the motor cells more educated, and does not their\nincreased functional activity direct and originate the more\ncomplex movements?\n\f386 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nIf my view be correct, habit is of the same nature as a\npersonality. Habit may be regarded, then, as belonging to a\nbrain area or district, or as a personality which is specially\neducated at some period of life. When the higher Ego is\nfeeble or inactive, habits of lower type and absence of skill\nobtain. It is only by close attention or the influence of the\nhighest intellect that good and skilled habits develop, which\nplace the personality in a higher sphere of life.\nThis subject merits the attention of those who have to\neducate the young, and aid them in the formation of char\nacter, which is perhaps but a personality.\nIn science we speak of the mind possessing the power of\ninhibition. In popular language we call it self-control, or the\npower to resist immediate gratification for the sake of future\ngood. But do we resist evil ? or do we not rather flee from it\nand turn our backs on it ? An evil . personality may be tend\ning to get the upper hand. Should we allow it to remain\nand fight it ? or should not the process rather be that of\nstriving to pass to another and nobler personality ? Bather\nthan a mere negative inhibition, is it not a power of switch\ning off the vital current from the bad district or personality,\nand turning it into a more desirable channel ?\nIf we go among the masses we find adverse circumstances\nworking terrible havoc among the children, such as bad air,\nmalnutrition, sickness from improper exposure, brain attacks,\nor meningitis, fits, and above all, bad heredity due to drunken\nparents. The children that survive are liable to become\nabnormal, even degenerate and criminal. But we cannot\nregard them as fully responsible for their actions and ten\ndencies. We have to remember that they have never had\na fair chance of developing their normal personality or their\nhighest Ego.

It often\nhappens with mediums who write automatically that the\nhandwriting differs from their ordinary hand and varies\ngreatly at different times, and often the different handwritings\nare associated with different supposed \" controls.\" Sometimes,\neven, the handwriting resembles more or less closely that\nof some deceased person who is thought to be controlling\n{e.g. in the case of Mile. Helene Smith, who wrote signa\ntures resembling those found in some old documents, as\nrecorded by Prof. Flournoy in Dcs Indes a la Planete Mars,\np. 409 ; and in a case occurring among the trance pheno\nmena of Mrs. Thompson described in the Proceedings, Part\nXLVII., pp. 235-243). I need not here discuss the question\n\u2014which must obviously depend on the circumstances of each\nparticular case\u2014whether such resemblance affords evidence of\nthe agency of the deceased person ; but the fact of the\nvariety of handwriting being found in a case of secondary\npersonality shows that for this feature, at least, we need not\nseek for a cause outside the individuality of the writer. 1%\naffords, in fact, another link between the phenomena of trance\nand of secondary personality.\nFor this reason it seems worth while to analyse the\nwritings of Mary Barnes in some detail, and in order that\nthe reader may follow the description, several specimens taken\nfrom the letters quoted above in full are here reproduced.\nSeveral distinct styles of handwriting are shown which,\nhowever, are not consistent in their connection with the\ndifferent personalities. The principal styles are as follows :\u2014\n(1) The backwards writing in which, while the whole runs\nfrom left to right, each word is written from right to left.\nBoth B2 and B9 at first wrote in this way (see repro\nductions in Plate I. and Plate III., Fig. 1). Indications of the\n\f394 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nway the writing was done may be seen in three cases in\nwhich the last letter or letters of a word were first written\nand then crossed out, and followed by the whole word (see\n\"gt\" for \"night\" in Plate I., and \"n\" for \"in\" and \"ur\"\nfor \"your\" in Plate III., Fig. 1). The backwards writing of\nB2 was closely similar to that of B9, but when they wrote\nforwards in the ordinary manner, their writings were quite\ndifferent. The forwards writing of B2 in letter (4) is very\nmuch like her backwards writing, but more regular ; in letter\n(1) her writing is like that of B7, to be next described.\n(2) Writing of B7. This is a fully formed but uneducated-\nlooking hand, characterised by superfluous tags at the beginnings\nand superfluous flourishes at the ends of words ; also by the indi\nvidual letters being compressed from side to side, while the\nstrokes joining them are disproportionately drawn out. The same\ncharacteristics are found in much of the writing of the blind B10.\n(3) Writing of B3. There are several different specimens\nof this, the earliest being the postcard addressed to her\nfather on August 7th, 1896, and quoted above. In this the\nstyle is much more childish than that of B7, but contains\nslight traces both of the flourishes and of the compression of\nthe letters found in the latter style. The writing is very\ncareless and irregular. The next specimen was the letter\nwritten to Dr. Wilson soon after, on August 26th, 1896,\nevidently written with much more care. B9's letter (No. 13),\nwritten forwards on November 22nd, 1896, is very similar\nto the third specimen of Bo, which was written on April\n4th, 1897, and part of which is reproduced in Plate II.,\nFig I. This is a clear round childish writing, containing a\nrather peculiar form of the letter \" k \" which does not occur\nin any other of the writings. The latest specimen of B3 is\ndated August 12th, 1897. It retains the round childish\ncharacter, each letter being formed with care and correctness,\nbut the capital \" D's \" take on the form of those of B6 (see\nPlate II., Fig. 2) in that the return upward stroke stops\nshort of the initial downward stroke. The whole writing of\nB3, in fact, is similar to the early writings of B6, as may be\nseen by comparing (1) and (2) on Plate II. Later B6 writes\nmore flowingly and the letters become less correctly formed,\nthe style developing into that shown in Plate III., Fig. 2.\n\fxux.] 395\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\n(4) Writing of B10. This varies a good deal. The earliest\nspecimens are dated January 3rd, 1897 (the B10 personality\nhaving first appeared on December 29th, 1896); some of\nthese resemble planchette writing, being large and sprawling\nand characterless ; other parts are like the writing of B7,\nalready described ; in others again the letters are long and\nsloping, like the writing reproduced in Plate II., Fig. 3, which\nwas done a few weeks later, on February 14th, when she\ncould see a very little, whereas at the beginning of January\nshe was quite blind.\nWith regard to the contents of these writings a few points\nmay be noted :\nB2's first letter to her father (No. 1 above) dated January\n28th, 1896, shows an excessively\u2014not to say artificially\u2014\nchildish style of phonetic spelling ; it is noteworthy that in two\ncases a word is begun with the right spelling and then the\ncorrect initial letter is crossed out, and the word finally\nspelt wrong ;\u2014she begins to spell \" which \" with a \" w,\" then\ncrosses it out and writes \" vitch \" ; and later on begins\n'\u2022 your \" with a \" y,\" then crosses it out and writes \" ou's.\"\nThe whole performance suggests not so much a child as an\nelder person imagining herself to be a child ; as if the normal\nconsciousness were deliberately, and not quite successfully,\ntrying to suppress itself to give full play to the dramatic\ninstincts of the subliminal. So little, indeed, in this case was\nthe normal consciousness submerged that it cropped up spon\ntaneously and required no external suggestion or artifice to\nelicit it, such as was used in the incident of the correct\ncounting to which Mr. Piddington has drawn attention (see\nbelow, p. 411) when B10 could only count 1, 2, 1, 2; but\nwas suddenly surprised into counting up to 5.\nIn a piece of writing by B7 there are indications of the\nopposite extreme, explicit knowledge being shown of a fact\nwhich the normal Mary Barnes had probably forgotten, or\nperhaps never consciously known. B7 wrote :\nMarch 16th, 1895.\nThe dear old Dada and Mother. The dear old Doctor H .\nThe dear old doctor G . The dear doctor Wilson. The dear\nold nurse who came from the Union to nurse mama when she had\ndiptheiria. Miss Mlarian Bearnet.\n\f306 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nThe date given at the top of this writing was incorrect ;\nit was really written on May 13th, 1896, on the back of a\nticket for a public meeting at the Mansion House on May\n12th, 1896. March 16th, 1895, was before the illness\nwhich started the series of varying personalities, and the\nmention of this date is perhaps another indication of the fact\nthat the memory of B7 included incidents in the life of the\nnormal personality A. This extended memory is shown in the\ninteresting reference to her mother's illness which occurred\nwhen Mary Barnes was under two years old ; in the reference\nto her parents as such, instead of as Tom and Mary Ann ;\nin the use of the correct names of the doctors ; and again in\nthe signature \" Miss Mlarian Bearnet,\" 1 an obvious variant\nof the real name.\nIt may be remembered that Ansel Bourne adopted during\nhis secondary personality a similar variant of his real name,\ncalling himself A. J. Brown.\nAt a later stage, B6 signed herself \" Critter Barnes,\" but\nonly after she had been taught what her real surname was.\nFinally she dropped the \" Critter,\" and used her proper signa\nture, after having been taught it.\nThe drawings illustrate the development of faculties latent\nin the normal personality, and it is curious, though (as Mr.\nPiddington points out, p. 408) not without parallel, that they\nbegan in the blind stage, B10.\nB10 having first appeared on December 29th, 1896,\nbegan to draw on January 3rd, 1897, when completely blind,\nand a large number of drawings were executed on that day.\nThe first ones represent faces, drawn on a large scale and in\nbold outlines. Dr. Wilson notes that to produce these she\nfelt her own face, and then drew her pictures by touch. The\nfirst of all is drawn in profile, the length of the face being\nabout 5 inches. There are also four large full-face drawings,\nclosely resembling one another, the faces being from 8 to 9\ninches long. Next comes a half-length figure\u2014apparently of\na man\u2014and another large profile face, with very elaborate\nhead gear. After this, the fashion-plate type shown in Plate\nV. predominates, and there are about half-a-dozen half or full\n1The signature actually written was as much like the real name as \"Mlarian\nBearnet\" is like \"Mary Barnes.\"\n\fxlix.] A Case of Multiple Personality. 397\nlength figures of elaborately-dressed ladies\u2014one, marked \" Bride,\"\nwith a veil, others with elaborate coiffures, and one with a\nhat and veil. In this last case, the veil is described as added\nafter the rest of the figure was drawn. A note on it states\nthat, as she could not see, she asked for her forefinger to be\nplaced on the neck of the figure, and then drew a veil in\nthe correct position. On one of the other drawings, it is\nnoted that her father moved the paper as she was in the\nmiddle of drawing, so that the skirt was drawn at a con\nsiderable distance from the upper part of the figure. Dr.\nWilson states that later on her sense of touch became much\nmore acute, so that, if the paper was moved while she was in\nthe middle of drawing, she could find out for herself, by feeling\nit, where to continue the lines.\nThese early drawings are mixed up with a good deal of\nwriting, either mere lists of names and words, or apparently\ncasual remarks,\u2014possibly referring to conversations going on\naround her,\u2014or fragmentary reminiscences of music-hall songs,\nsuch as the following:\nDear Father\nI want some pudding Toms Lamb\nShe was a dear little dickey Bird\nChip, Chip, Chip she went\nSweetly she sang to me till all my money was spent\nShe went of song we parted on fighting terms\nFor she was one of the eary birds and I was one of the worms.\nWe will retire to the other- room for a short interval to discuss\nnessessary matters Old Sam.\nThe writing, both in form and contents, strongly resembles\nthe elementary stages of automatic writing with which psychi\ncal researchers are familiar.\nA series of pictures executed about a month later are much\nbetter drawn ; the faces are more correct, and have a certain\nvariety of expression, though fundamentally similar and all\nin profile. The figures, again, are of the fashion-plate type.\nThey are drawn in pencil and coloured with chalks. At this\ntime B10 had begun to recover her sight, but was extremely\nshort-sighted, not being able to see anything clearly more\nthan about three inches from her eyes (see Dr. Tvveedy's report).\n\f398 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nHer habit of occasionally holding up the crayons to her eye,\nso close that they sometimes touched the cornea, suggested,\nhowever, that for practical purposes she could not see at all,\nand Dr. Wilson thought that these drawings, too, were\nreally executed by touch. It was a significant feature of\nthis condition that the cornea was completely insensitive, as\nsometimes occurs with subjects in a deep state of trance.\nLater in February, as described in Dr. Wilson's account,\nthe B6 or B2 personality appeared again ; but in the middle\nof March the imbecile state, B10, returned, and was even\nworse than before, being paralysed, blind, deaf, and dumb.\nHer sense of touch in guiding the pencil and copying was\nnow even more acute than before, and the drawings were\nstill better executed. It is to this period that the two draw\nings reproduced on Plates V. and VI. belong. The one given\non Plate IV. belongs to a slightly earlier period, March 7th\nto 14th, when B10 was alternating with B2, and it shows\nmore imagination and power of composition than any of the\nother specimens.\nDiary of Appearances of Different Personalities.\nA = Normal state.\nB = Abnormal state, of which\nthere were ten varieties, as\nfollows :\nBl\u2014Mania of 3rd and 4th weeks\nof the acute illness.\nBla\u2014Coma cephalgia of the 2nd\nand 3rd weeks of illness in\n1895.\nB2\u2014Childish ; \"a thing,\" \"good\nthing.\"\nB3\u2014\"Nick.\"\nB4\u2014Deaf and dumb.\nB5\u2014-Thinks herself only 3 days\nold.\nB6\u2014\" Pretty dear,\" \" good crea\nture,\" or \" Tom's darling.\"\nB7\u2014\" Adjuice Uneza.\"\nB8\u2014Thinks she was only born\nlast night.\nB9\u2014Various degeneracies,\n\"dreadful wicked creature.\"\nB10\u2014Blind, and draws; \"Tom's\nLamb.\"\nIn the following table, the first appearance of each personality is\nindicated by the black type.

A. Watson.\nThe cortex in both is divided into five layers (marked here\nI, II, III, Iv, v) which develop from below upwards. At birth all\nlayers are already formed. The deepest layer (v) is called the poly\nmorphic from the varying shapes of its cells. It is the first to develop,\nand with layer iv appears about the sixth month of foetal life. The\npyramidal (ii) and other layers appear about the 7th to 8th month of\nfoetal life. They are then about three-quarters of their depth in the\nadult. At birth the polymorphic and layer iv are not quite their final\nthickness, while the granular layer (in) is only three-quarters of its\nfinal thickness, and the pyramidal layer only one half. These details\nillustrate the fact that the course of development is from below\nupwards or from within outwards. We can, therefore, safely infer\nthat the functional activity of the layers comes into play in the same\norder.\nThe polymorphic layer is as large or thick in animals as in man.\nIn this diagram it is seen to be even thicker in the rabbit than in man.\nFor the rabbit has but little intelligence, and therefore has to rely on\nwell-developed instincts.\nThe granular layer (ill) does not demand special notice here. It\nreceives impressions from the sensory organs.\nThe pyramidal layer (ii) is the most important one for us to\nconsider here. It is the last to develop, and the first to go in\ndementia. It also decays first on the outer surface, for in this part\nmany of the cells have not reached perfection, being of the type\ncalled embryonic.\nCompare the depth of this layer in the normal human brain as\nshown in the diagram (-86 mm.) with its depth in the rabbit\n(*14 mm.). It is thus six times as thick in the human as in the\nrabbit's brain, which alone indicates an enormous difference in\nintellectual power.\n\f404 Dr. Albert Wilson.\nPlate IX.

The foot centre is at\nthe top, and the lips and speech centres at the bottom ; other centres\nintervene. H points to the centre of hearing ; V to the sensori-visual\ncentre, that is, the centre where the images of objects seen and focussed\nby the eye acting as a photographic camera are, so to speak, finally\ndeveloped or perceived. In the blind imbecile the pyramidal layer\nis here undeveloped and thin (according to Bolton).\nThe clear spaces P, OT and F represent the association areas,\nwhich associate the impressions received in the sensory areas for\npurposes of higher mentation.\nDrs. G. A. Watson and J. S. Bolton regard the visuo-sensory area\n(V) as of relatively little psychic value, comparing its development\nin the human and other \"seeing\" animals with the much larger\nvisual psychic or association area (P) which surrounds the visuo-sensory.\nIn this visuo-psychic area all sight impressions are stored and analysed.\nIn copying or drawing from a copy or painting from nature, the image\nof the object is focussed by the eye, which is like a camera, with the\nretina as a screen. From the eye the image is impressed on the visuo-\nsensory area (V) and thence it is analysed and stored in the association\ncentre P. From the visuo-psychic area (P) messages for guidance as to\nthe form and colour of the drawing are sent to the hand centre in M.\nPlate IX., Fig. 2.\nEight side of the brain, showing the arterial blood supply. There\nare three areas, marked PC, MC and AC, supplied by three arteries.\nPosteriorly (PC) the blood supply comes from the posterior cerebral, a\nbranch of the vertebral artery. Anteriorly, and along the top of the\nbrain (including the foot centre) in the region marked AC, the blood\nsupply comes from the anterior cerebral artery. In the middle region\nmarked MC, which includes the large motor area, and also the hearing\nand taste centres, the blood supply is from the middle cerebral artery.\nThe two last are both branches of the carotid artery. But all these\narteries intermingle in the capillaries. The anterior association centre,\nwhich is the highest psychic centre, is supplied by the anterior cerebral\nartery. The posterior association or visuo-psychic centre is supplied by\nthe posterior cerebral artery. The middle cerebral artery divides up into\nmany arteries supplying several different centres. Thus speech and\nhearing may be shut off by one large branch being narrowed ; the optic\nmechanism by another, the hands by another, and the legs by another.\n\fxlix.] A Case- of Multiple Personality. 405\nAPPENDIX II.\nLetter from Mr. Piddington to Dr. Wilson.\nSince reading your paper, I have noted a few resemblances,\nand also one or two differences, between the case of Mary\nBarnes and other cases of dual or multiple personality.\nSome years ago I read at one of the meetings of the S.P.R.\nDr. Morton Prince's preliminary report on the \" Beauchamp \"\ncase ; and I well remember how, at the close of the meeting, a\nlady member of our Society asked me what I thought of the\npaper ; and how, after, I suppose, I had made some banal reply\nsuch as : \" It's very interesting,\" she retorted : \" Well, I don't\nbelieve a word of it ! \"\nNow, although I do not imagine that many of your audience\nthe other night, or that many of your future readers will share\nthis lady's scepticism, and although your case is not such a\n\" tall \" one as Dr. Morton Prince's, still some amount of incre\ndulity is not unnatural when people learn ot these things for\nthe first time and are unacquainted with the literature of the\nsubject. Nor do I imagine that scepticism in the matter would\nbe entirely confined to the lay reader, but might be found\neven in the ranks of your own profession.\nIf, then, some undesigned coincidences can be shown to\nexist between your case and other recorded cases of a similar\ntype, they might serve as an \" aid to faith \" ; and in any case\nthe comparison may have some little interest even for those\nwho readily accept the facts.\nI think I am justified in speaking of the coincidences as\nundesigned for two reasons. In the first place because, as I\nthink any fair-minded critic will allow, it is ridiculous to\nsuppose that a girl of the age, station in life, and education of\nMary Barnes could or would have read up the subject of\nmultiple personality, and on the strength of her acquired\nknowledge have maintained a plausible and wearisome imita\ntion of this form of mental instability during several years.\n\f40G [PAET\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nIn the second place, because the appearance of the coinci\ndental symptoms cannot be ascribed to your suggestion ; and\nthis for the very good reason that, although you were, of course,\naware of the alleged existence of cases of dual personality, you\nwere not, as I know from your own assurance, acquainted\nwith the details\u2014nor, for that matter, even with the broad\noutlines\u2014of the classical cases of alternating personality.\nAnd it is to coincidences in little details and not to the\nsalient points of resemblance, such for instance as the epilepti\nform attacks, or the mutually exclusive memories of the\nvarious personalities, that I refer.\nThe coincidences are not many ; but then I do not pretend\nto have made an exhaustive list, for my collation has been\nlittle better than cursorily made; and, moreover, the recorded\ncases of dual and multiple personality are not numerous, and\nbut two have been described with anything approaching even\ntolerable adequacy. Not that I imagine that such cases are\nreally so very rare; but that their apparent rarity is due to\nthe rarity of intelligent observers. This infrequency of recorded\ncases, however, helps my argument ; for it leaves only a narrow\nfield for chance coincidence to disport itself in, and if the re\nsemblances cannot be assigned to chance or design, then it is\nreasonable to attribute them to some common spontaneous\ncause which is at work in all the cases ; or, in other words,\nthey tell against the view that the phenomena are spurious.\nThis is a very long overture to a very small body of facts,\nbut I want to explain the object which I have in view in\ncomparing the case of Mary Barnes with others.\nThe case may be compared :\n(1) With that of Mary Reynolds:\nIn her secondary state Mary Reynolds did not recognise her\nparents, brothers, sisters, or friends ; and \" she was very slow to\nlearn, and indeed never did learn, or, at least, never would\nacknowledge the ties of consanguinity, or scarcely those of\nfriendship.\" These words might not apply with absolute exact\nness to Mary Barnes ; yet I take it that her nicknaming of\nher father, mother, family, and of yourself and other doctors who\nvisited her implies a loss of memory, not perhaps so complete,\nbut similar in tendency.\nMary Reynolds and Mary Barnes both had to be re-taught\n\fXLIX.] 407\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nreading and writing ; and both acquired, or rather re-acquired\nthese arts within a far shorter period than is needed in the\ncase of children learning them for the first time.\nMary Reynolds' was a case of dual personality only, and not\nof multiple personality, and she did not therefore display the\nmultifarious changes that your patient did. Still, both finished\nup by remaining permanently not m their normal, but in an\nabnormal state ; for after alternating between her two states\nfor a period of 15 or 16 years, Mary Reynolds at the age of\n36 settled down for good, namely, for the last 25 years of\nher life, into her secondary condition. This secondary con\ndition was undoubtedly superior to her original normal person\nality. This cannot, it is true, be said of Mary Barnes' present\nand apparently permanent state, for I understand that B6 is\nnot superior to the original normal personality as it existed\nbefore her illness; but at any rate B6 is vastly superior to\nseveral of the other personalities.\n(2) With that of Miss Beauchamp:\nYou narrate one instance in your paper where one of the\nabnormal personalities recalled an incident which had hap\npened when Mary Barnes was only two years and a half old ;\nand in conversation you told me that you thought that there\nwas some reason for supposing that her memory in one of her\nstages went back even earlier than this. I know that you do\nnot attach much weight to this point, because you recognise\nthe enormous difficulties of excluding the possibility of such\nmemories of babyhood being really due to imagination, or to\nthe girl having heard her elders recount incidents belonging to\nthe time when she was a tiny child. Nevertheless, though of\ncourse the same objections apply, it strikes me as rather re\nmarkable that Dr. Morton Prince believed that the personality\nwhom he christened Sally remembered events of her babyhood,\nsuch, for instance, as learning to walk ; and at any rate she\nprofessed to remember all this long way back. That you and\nDr. Morton Prince, both in entire ignorance of each other's\ncase, should have been led to the same surmise about\ntwo different subjects, lends some mutual confirmation to the\nobservations of both. There is, however, one point of differ\nence between these two cases. The otherwise omniscient, or\nnearly omniscient, Sally did not know French or other foreign\n\f408 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nlanguages with which the normal Miss Beauchamp was familiar ;\nwhereas while the normal Mary Barnes knew no French, and\nwould not learn it, and could not draw, B6 and B9 knew some\nFrench, and B10 could draw.\n(3) With that of Lurancy Vennum :\nThe phenomena were entirely of a spiritualistic type, the\nvarious personalities, in this case styled \" controls,\" purporting\nto be the spirits of deceased persons. With the exception of\none \" control,\" and that the most persistent, there does not\nappear to be any evidence to show that these controls were\nanything more than secondary personalities. Yet in spite of\nthe wide divergences between the symptoms recorded of Lurancy\nVennum and those of your patient, I note one little point in\ncommon. When supposed to be controlled by the spirit of a\nwoman named Katrina Hogan, Lurancy Vennum called her\nfather \" Old Black Dick,\" and her mother '' Old Granny \" : much\nas Mary Barnes nicknamed her parents and other members of\nher family.\n(4) With that of Miss Anna Winsor (\"Old Stump\"):\n\" Old Stump \" (which was the name given by Miss Winsor\nto what was really her right arm, though she refused to recognise\nit as such) executed a series of drawings ; whereas Anna Winsor\nin her normal state never learnt to draw, nor cared to try to\ndraw. A parallel is to be found in the performances of B10.\n\" Old Stump \" wrote poetry, and it is stated that the hand\nwriting of the different pieces of poetry \"differs greatly\": another\npoint of contact, and that in a most interesting particular,\nwith one of the phenomena which you were fortunate enough\nto witness in the case of Mary Barnes.\nAgain, it is recorded of Miss Winsor : \" She became blind,\n4th of January;\" [1861: nearly six months, that is, after the\nrirst manifestation of her peculiar symptoms] \" is still blind,\"\n[\" still \" meaning two months later] \" sees as well with eyes\nclosed as open ; keeps them closed much of the time. Reads\nand draws with them closed. Draws in the dark as well as\nin the light; is clairvoyant.\"\nLeaving aside the clairvoyance, which Dr. Isa Barrows,\nMiss Wiusor's medical attendant, so airily disposes of in a\ncouple of words, there are two points of resemblance to your\ncase : namely, the psychical blindness, and the drawing in the\n\fXLIX.] 409\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\ndark or with the eyes closed. I do not kuow whether\nMary Barnes actually executed any of her drawings in the\ndark ; but she was able to copy written words and to copy\nfashion-plates under conditions which seem to have excluded\n\u2022dependence upon her sense of sight.\nI remark, however, one point of difference in connection\nwith the blindness, or rather with the recovery of the sight.\nThus when Anna Winsor recovered her sight after eighteen\nmonths of \" erratic vision,\" she found the light painful to her\neyes, and in consequence the room in which she lived had\nto be darkened. When Mary Barnes recovered her sight, she\nseems to have experienced no painful sensations.\nOne point which you have recorded of \" Nick \" interested me\ngreatly, because a parallel to it can be found in a most\nunexpected quarter.\nProfessor William James quotes in The Varieties of Religious\nExperience the personal narratives of a certain number of\npeople who have undergone \" religious conversion \" ; and one\nof the leading characteristics of the converted state, of the\n\" new man,\" as exemplified in these narratives, is not only a\nmagnified appreciation of nature, but a perfect tranquillity\nin the presence of nature in her savage moods.\nOne convert writes :\u2014\" When a boy, I was standing under\na tree which was struck by lightning, and received a shock,\nfrom the effects of which I never knew exemption until I\nhad dissolved partnership with worry. Since then lightning\nand thunder have been encountered under conditions which\nwould formerly have caused great depression and discomfort,\nwithout [my] experiencing a trace of either.\"\nAnd another says :\u2014\" And scarce anything, among all the\nworks of nature, was so sweet to me as thunder and lightning;\nformerly nothing had been so terrible to me. Before, I used\nto be uncommonly terrified with thunder, and to be struck\nwith terror when I saw a thunderstorm arising ; but now, on\nthe contrary, it rejoices me.\"\nThis latter is the declaration of Jonathan Edwards : aud,\nthe phraseology apart, might have been made by \"Nick\";\nexcept that, for all we know, \" Nick \" was unaware of Mary\nBarnes' fear of thunderstorms and Mary Barnes of \" Nick's \"\n\u2022enjoyment of them.\n\f410 [part\nDr. Alhert Wilson.\nWe may perhaps compare with this relief from physical\nfear what is described of Mary Reynolds in her secondary\nstate :\u2014\" She knew no fear, and as bears and panthers were\nnumerous in the woods .... her friends told her of\nthe danger to which she exposed herself; but it produced\nno other effect than to draw forth a contemptuous laugh, as\nshe said, ' I know you only want to frighten me and keep\nme at home, but you miss it, for I often see your bears, and\nI am perfectly convinced that they are nothing more than\nblack hogs.1 \" One day she encountered a \" black hog \" when\nriding ; the horse was frightened and refused to move ; so-\nMary Reynolds dismounted, and stick in hand went close up\nto the bear, which \" walked away, slowly and sullenly.\"\nThere may be, and indeed is, an important difference here\nbetween the fearless behaviour of Mary Reynolds in the\npresence of a bear and that of \" Nick \" during a thunder\nstorm ; for \" Nick \" did not mistake the thunderstorm for\nanything less terrifying, while Mary Reynolds seems to have\nowed her absence of fear to an opportune and protective\nillusion. And as regards the feeling of security typical\nof the religious convert and the fearlessness of \" Nick \" and\nMary Reynolds, the latter should perhaps be attributed to\nwhat Myere, commenting on the case of Mary Reynolds, calls\n\" the childish insouciance of the secondary state,\" that is\nto a lower stage of intellectual development; while the former\none is rather inclined to ascribe not to an intellectual\ninability to recognise the risk of danger, but to a higher^\nor at any rate altered, condition of the moral character, in\nwhich the individual finds himself in perfect tune with alL\nthe manifestations of nature, and welcomes and enjoys them\nas the workings of a loving God.\nStill the interesting fact remains that, in these various cases\nof altered personality of widely divergent origin, this sense of\nfearlessness crops up often enough to warrant one in regarding\nit almost as a typical symptom.\nWhile on this topic I might add that the first oncoming of\nMiss Beauchamp's changes of personality dated from a thunder\nstorm. An incident of a painful character was in progress,\nand this alone may have been sufficient to have upset her\nequilibrium; but the thunderstorm may also have played a.\n\fXLIX.] 411\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\npart. \" The surroundings, too,\" writes Dr. Morton Prince,\n41 were dramatic. It was night, and pitch dark, but a storm\nwas coming up, and great peals of thunder and flashes of\nlightning heightened the emotional effect. . . . From that\ntime 8he was changed.\"\nI cannot find that Miss Beauchamp either before or after\nthis time is said to have shown fear of thunderstorms, though,\nas she seems to have been of a timid disposition, it would not\nbe surprising if she had. Nor can I find it noted that in any\nof her abnormal states she showed delight in them ; though it\nwould be quite consistent with the character of that saucy\nyoung secondary personality Sally Beauchamp to snap her\nfingers in the face of even Nature with a capital N. But I\nam getting too fanciful, and will trouble you with only one\nmore observation.\nI cannot help regretting that you have not in your paper\nlaid greater stress on one incident that you dismiss in a sen\ntence or two. You record how on one occasion, when your patient\nwas in a particular phase in which she did not count beyond\ntwo, you asked her \" very quickly \" (the \" very quickly \" is\nthe pith of the statement) how many fingers there were on\nher hand, and although she was supposed at this time not to\ncount above two, she replied \" five.\" It is true that she at\nonce corrected herself and started counting again on her \" one,\ntwo \" system ; but the correction came too late, and I would\nsay that the romancing secondary personality had given itself\naway. In other words, you surprised her momentarily into her\nnormal state. I wish that you had made other attempts to\ncatch her; not, of course, by direct questions, but by employ\ning artifice. I do not mean that I think that Mary Barnes\nwas shamming; I think nothing so foolish. But it does look\nas if the normal personality is not really obliterated or entirely\nunconscious during such times as the abnormal personalities\nare active, but as if it is really there all the time, only sent to\nCoventry by the usurping secondary personality. If this really\nwas the case, then the mental phenomena exhibited by your\npatient would accord with what I cannot help believing is\nreally true of all hypnotised subjects : namely, that whatever the\nsubjects themselves may assert, or whatever conclusions their\nobservers may draw from their behaviour, the normal person\n\f412 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nality, although in abeyance and although difficult to get at,\nis never really extinct. I should be inclined to say that by\nyour sudden question you provoked an automatism of the normal\nconsciousness. .\nJ. G. PlDDINGTON.\nComments by Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey.\nI saw \" Mary Barnes \" some years ago with Dr. Wilson.\nShe then called herself \" Poor Thing,\" and had the manners-\nand speech of a child of six or seven, though she was twice\nthat age. I tried to hypnotise her, but failed, and other\noperators had also found her insusceptible. This was unfor\ntunate, for hypnotism would probably have supplied a bridge\nof memory, and enabled us to establish a connection between\nthe various personalities, as in the case of Ansel Bourne re\ncorded by Prof. William James and Dr. R. Hodgson,1 and in a\nrecent case of my own. The latter was that of a bank clerk,\nand was investigated by Dr. Leaf, Miss Goodrich Freer, and\nmyself. The subject disappeared from the bank on a Friday about\nmid-day and \" woke up \" late on Saturday night in a strange\nhotel at Southampton. He could not give any account of how\nhe had passed the 36 intervening hours until he was thrown\ninto a deep hypnotic trance. He then answered questions,\nand gave a complete history of his proceedings. Subsequent\ninvestigation proved the truth of his story, and that his actions\nin the \" second state \" were quite purposeful. The man was\nneurotic and given to occasional alcoholic excess, and in two or\nthree of the other cases I have seen there was a history of\nepilepsy or aggravated hysteria. The most recent case I have\ncome across was that of an Oxford undergraduate, who after a\nperiod of overwork disappeared from his home without warning\nand telegraphed ten days after from Malta for money to-\nbring him back. It appeared that he \" woke up \" on board a\nsteamer at Tunis in the act of knocking a man down who-\nhad tried to steal his portmanteau. The excitement seems to-\n1 In Proceediiujx, S.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 321.\n\fXLIX.] 413\nA Case of Multiple Personality.\nhave brought him round, perhaps by shifting the connection\nof the neurones. He knew nothing of what had happened during\nthe ten days, but his actions had evidently been rational or\nhe would have been arrested. We hoped to obtain a key by\nhypnosis, but unfortunately the young man, on the advice of\nan eminent brain specialist, refused to be operated on, so we\nmay have lost an interesting story.\nThere is a good deal of literature on the subject since the\npublication of Professor Azatn's exhaustive monograph 1 in\n1887. The S.P.R. did much to elucidate this fascinating and\npuzzling problem at a time when its importance was not\ngenerally recognised. Alembers will recall papers by the late\nDr. A. T. Myers, and a recent one by Dr. Morton Prince.2\nNow the subject is often referred to in the daily papers, and\ncases of lapsed memory and dual consciousness are discussed\nby the man in the street.\nThe physiological explanation put forward by Dr. Wilson\nis a most valuable contribution towards the scientific under\nstanding of the subject. The case is one of the most striking\nhitherto recorded, and it is most fortunate that it has been\nunder the notice of such a painstaking and accomplished\ninvestigator.\nComments by Dr. Robekt Jones.\nDr. Wilson seems to me to have made an able and careful\nsummary of many observations in an almost unique case. It\nhad been suggested that \" Mary Barnes' \" different states might\nbe due to hypnotic conditions, but it is obvious that they\nare rather to be looked upon as cataleptic or in some way\nrelated to that post-epileptic trance condition described as post\nepileptic automatism, and one which is familiar to those who\nhave the care of the insane. The stages may also remind us\nof the imitative aptitudes of children, which cause them to\nacquire ideas and ways of acting current in the community\nto which 'they belong, and in | this case there was no stage\n1 Hyjmotisme, Double Conscience el Alterations de la PersonnaliU, Paris, 1887.\na Proceedings, S.P.K., Vol. XV., p\/466.\n\f414 [part\nDr. Albert Wilson.\nwhich was foreign to the natural experience of the ages through\nwhich Mary Barnes had passed. As to the reality or unreality\nof these personalities, when the attention is engrossed upon\none line of thought, there is generally a forgecfuluess of other\nstates, arising from the fulness of concentration. As is known,\nin health the life-history of every individual consciousness embraces\nmany diverse and often incongruous states and tendencies, and\nall self-consciousness implies a possibility of a division of the\ntotal self, so that there is, so to speak, one self and many\nselves. At any moment of time the attention may be fixed\nupon one or other of these \" selves,\" and only in so far as\nthey differ from each other and the present self do they seem\nseparate states or stages, and we regard them accordingly as\ndistinct selves ; for instance, the self of dreams is regarded as\nquite distinct from the waking self, and the man sober can\nreflect upon the man drunk and draw many lessons and resolu\ntions from the revived disgrace and the remembered reproach.\nAfter having been overcome by some sudden and exceptional\ncondition in. which he is impelled to act injuriously to the\ninterests of another, he may refuse to recognise the lower\nself and explain it away under the excuse that he was not\nmaster of his actions. Also in states of mental conflict\nwhen moral principle struggles against temptation, two per\nsonalities may be assumed, the one the higher self, the other\nwhat appears to be a foreign and intrusive personality.\nCases of double personality are not to be confused with the\nordinary delusions of insanity ; for in the latter case there are\nnot two separate threads of memory, but the memory is con\ntinuous in the intervals of the delusion. Thus I have at the\npresent time in the London Asylum, Claybury, one patient who\nbelieves that he is taken out every night against his will, and\nalso against his will is compelled to work in an adjoining\nbrickfield. His tired sensations in the morning\u2014possibly the\neffect of rheumatism\u2014confirm his delusions, and no reasoning\nas to the absence of clay or the want of confirmation of his\nstory by others who slept in the next bed are of any avail.\nOther characters are assumed by other persons : the prophet\nDaniel, Napoleon Bonaparte, the King, and Miss Hickman\u2014\nall these figure as altered personalities.

C. S. Schiller.\nTHE ANSWERS TO THE AMERICAN BRANCH'S\nQUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING HUMAN SENTIMENT\nAS TO A FUTURE LIFE.1\nBy F. C. S. Schiller.\nIt is ray purpose in this paper to discuss the results of the\ninquiry into the actual state of human sentiment, which Dr.\nRichard Hodgson and the American Branch of our Society\nundertook about three years ago, only in so far as these results\nhave a special bearing on the methods of the S.P.R. Although\nthe idea underlying this inquiry was novel, the material collected\nby it has proved to be of great psychological interest and\nimmensely suggestive in a variety of ways ; but I intend to\ndiscuss its psychological aspects in another, and I hope more\nsystematic, form. Even from the point of view of this\nReport, however, I shall have to begin by explaining\nthe aim of what must doubtless have appeared to\nmany a particularly puzzling and unintelligible bit of\npsychical research. I feel indeed that those who have\nbeen good enough to help us by answering our questions and\nby procuring answers from others, must have done so largely\nfrom faith in a useful purpose they could not see. A demand\nfor such faith is always more or less involved in the question\nnaire method of investigation, because the point to be tested\nmust always be so concealed as not to arouse partisan spirit\nfor or against. It is better to run the risk of having the whole\naffair regarded as pointless and insignificant than that of collect\ning answers modified to suit, or to thwart, a detected purpose.\n1 The essential parts of this paper were read to a General Meeting of the\nSociety on November 14th, 1902.\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 417\nThe time however has come to justify the modicum of faith\naccorded us by explaining the point of the inquiry, and I am\nconfident that its importance will then be recognised.\nL\nI must admit then, in the first place, that it is a very\nbelated inquiry. In strict logic it should have come twenty\nyears ago, at the very outset of the Society's career. For\nregarded, not as a piece of general scientific work, i.e. as psycho\nlogical investigation, but in its special relation to the S.P.R's\nwork, it is essentially an attempt to test the social atmosphere\nin which the Society must live and operate. By social\natmosphere I mean the attitude which people at large maintain\ntowards any subject and those interested in it. We are all\nof us in all our pursuits influenced by such an atmosphere.\nIts presence is always more or less felt ; it stifles or stimulates\nevery form of intellectual life, although its effects differ accord\ning as it is denser or rarer, favourable or the reverse. Moreover\nsome subjects are hardy enough to flourish in almost any climate.\nBut I know only of one case in which the social atmosphere\nmay be said not to act : we can think what we like, no matter\nwhat others may think about what we think, provided that we\nkeep our thoughts strictly to ourselves, and do not act on them.\nAs soon as we begin to act on our thoughts, society begins\nto guess at them ; as soon as we begin to express them, we have\nto take into consideration what others will think of them.\nAnd thus the social atmosphere will check, or promote, or direct,\nour growth, and the place of Mrs. Grundy in scientific research\nis just as real and as worthy of study as in matters of morals\nand manners.\nNow in Psychical Besearch we are as yet peculiarly sensitive\nto the condition of the social atmosphere. It is still a new\nsubject, and a new subject always has a hard struggle to get\nacclimatised, and probably demands a certain amount of readjust\nment in the atmospheric conditions. There is however an obvious\nadvantage in effecting this readjustment as gently as possible.\nWe want to raise a wind without provoking a storm ; to remove\nthe stagnant air which broods oppressively over the subjects\n\f418 [part\nF. G. S. Schiller.\nsociety is content to leave untouched without invoking a cyclone.\nThe very formation of a Society for Psychical Research is in\na way a proof of this contention ; for it involves an attempt\nto make a social atmosphere of a local kind which may be\nfavourable to the proper study of subjects which could not be\npursued by individuals in the open. But even then the\nprosperity of the Society will depend on the attitude of the\nlarger society around it. If it is favourable to our work, it\ncan assist us in myriad ways ; it can supply us with money,\ninformation, recruits ; in fact do everything for us except make\nthe scientific discoveries themselves. If it is indifferent, it can\nindefinitely retard our progress. If it is actively against us,\nit can thwart us in an infinity of ways, persecute us until\nwe desist, nay ultimately suppress us, and bury us and our\ndiscoveries in oblivion.\nNow the remarkable men who founded the S.P.R. seem to\nme to have unconsciously made a very definite assumption with\nrespect to the social atmosphere. They knew, of course, that\nthey would have to deal inter alia with subjects reputed to\nbe of an interesting, nay of an exciting, character, with evidence\nwhich seemed to deal with the post mortem fortunes of mankind.\nAnd it was natural enough to assume that their enterprise\nwould be regarded with favour. Would not everybody welcome\nan honest, scientific and dispassionate investigation of the dark\ncorners of human psychology, of an intelligent questioning of\nthe gibbering ghosts that had flitted so enigmatically before the\neyes of untold generations ? Was not everybody really anxious\nfor light upon the mystery of human fate, and really desirous\nof the assurance that death was not the inexorable end of all, if\nonly that assurance could be made with scientific certainty ?\nThey were aware, of course, with what scorn materialists and\nagnostics, seated many of them in the high places of the\nintellectual world, looked down upon everything that savoured\nof superstition, and with what nervous disapproval they regarded\nany trafficking with the accursed thing. But they generously\nattributed these hostile prejudices to a quixotically lofty devotion\nto scientific truth, to a sternly stoic reluctance to yield to\nthe allurements of desire, to a profoundly reasoned, and so far\nreasonable, conviction of the impossibility of discovering aught.\nThey might well hope therefore that by producing an abundance\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 419\nof good work, prosecuted in a scientific temper and verified\nby scientific methods, they would win pardon for their audacity\nfrom the scientific opposition, and perhaps even gratitude\nfrom a world eagerly desirous of relief from the agonies of\ndoubt.\nIf however there was any serious error in this estimate of\nthe condition of the social atmosphere, this whole policy was\nforedoomed to more or less disappointment. What if there\nwere no widespread desire for a proof of a future life, or even\nfor a scientific investigation of the apparent evidence ? What\nif, consequently, this aspect of the Society's undertaking were\nsocially unwelcome ? What if its scientific critics were inspired,\nnot by too jealous a regard for truth, but by personal dislike\nof the Society's aims and a lurking fear lest it should reveal\ntruths which would involve a radical readjustment of inveterate\nopinions and ingrained habits ? If such were predominant, or\neven common, sentiments among men, the appeal to scientific\nevidence would be bound to fail. For it would not meet\nwith the receptiveness and open-mindedness towards new truth\nwhich all scientific discovery demands. No evidence can even\nbegin to produce logical conviction until there is psychological\nwillingness to receive it. This applies even to the abstract\ntruths of e.g. arithmetic ; it is impossible to prove even that\n2 + 2 = 4 to one who is unwilling to add. Far more signally\ndoes this hold good of inductive researches like ours, where\nit would be childish to expect to prove anything beyond cavil\nby a single effort, where proof must be gradual and cumulative,\nand repose on the growing coherence of the new truth in a\nmind disposed to admit it. A mind unwilling to believe, or\neven undesirous to be instructed, our weightiest evidence must\never fail to impress. It will insist on taking that evidence\nin bits, and rejecting it item by item. The man therefore who\naunounces his intention of waiting until one single absolutely\nconclusive bit of evidence turns up, is really a man not open to\nconviction ; and if he is a logician, he knows it. For modern\nlogic has made it plain that single facts never can be \" proved,\"\nexcept by their coherence in a system. But as all the facts\ncome singly, any one who dismisses them one by one is\ndestroying the conditions under which the conviction of new\ntruth could arise in his mind.\n\f420 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nIn other words, the discovery of truth presupposes, at least\nand in the first place, a will to know. It becomes therefore\na vital question to what extent we may presuppose such a\nwill to know. It seemed impossible to take this for granted.\nFor the surface indications were ambiguous. On the one side\nindeed there was an almost overwhelming tradition that the\nproblems of death and immortality were one of man's chief\npreoccupations in all ages, climes, races and religions. But\non the other there were the facts that at all times and in\nall places there had been an enormous gap between professions\nand actions, that everywhere, in spite of the most divergent\nbeliefs, men have acted much in the same way, and have\nshown much the same absorption in this world and its tri\nvialities. And, what was still more puzzling, there was the\nextraordinary fact that never yet throughout the ages had any\nsystematic attempt been made to investigate the problem. No\ndoubt this neglect was coexistent with a widely prevalent belief\nthat it was impossible to know ; but then this same pretext had\nbeen made into an excuse for never attempting a real investiga\ntion. Hence the question arose whether no one had tried,\nbecause it was impossible, or whether it was thought impossible,\nbecause no one had ever tried ?\nAgain, there were copious symptoms that the social atmosphere\nneither was, nor ever had been, wholly favourable to such\nattempts. A large number of people still seem to regard\npsychical research much as their ancestors a few generations\nback regarded witchcraft. It is not so very long ago that to\nbe suspected of psychic powers was considered sufficient proof\nof an unholy alliance with the enemy of mankind, and that\nthe burning of witches was deemed an entertaining addition to\na popular holiday. The uniformity with which at all times, in\nall countries and under every variety of religious belief, the\npersons, whom for lack of a more definitely descriptive name\nwe now call psychics, were subjected to atrocious persecution is\none of the most remarkable features in social history. One\ncan only suppose that in some obscure way they always excited\ndislike, that dislike led to persecution, and that the various\ntheoretical reasons alleged in justification of their treatment were\nan afterthought, based on the principle of first giving a dog a\nbad name when you mean to hang him. Now human nature\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 421\nchanges very slowly, and it seemed unlikely that an instinctive\nantipathy of this sort would entirely die out in the course of\na couple of centuries. If, therefore, it still persisted, under\ndifferent forms and with different pretexts, now sheltering itself\nperhaps under the cloak of science just as formerly under the\naegis of religion, it would still be potent to thwart, and if\nunrecognised, perhaps to wreck, the arduous enterprise to which\nwe stood committed.\nA priori speculation, then, left doubtful the real character\nof the social atmosphere. But being professionally a speculative\nphilosopher myself, I was too well aware of the limits of its\nvalue to content myself with unverified speculation. So I\nventured to suggest to the S.P.R that it should try to find\nout what the facts really were. Fortunately Dr. Hodgson\nsaw the vital importance of the question, and the American\nBranch undertook the enquiry.\nMy first point then is this. It is all-important for us to\nknow the condition of the social atmosphere, in order to know\nwhat tactics we must adopt, and what we must do to alter\nit. If e.g. we find that there exists a strong prejudice against\nour investigations on sentimental and emotional grounds, we\nshall have to postpone the idea of adducing convincing evidence.\nIt is a waste of time to bombard with facts minds firmly closed\nagainst their admission, and determined to quibble about their\nreception. We shall first have to strike deeper, at the roots of\nthe primitive prejudices which obstruct our way. If, again, we\ncan show that the social bias is not for us but rather against\nus, we can make an appeal to the instinct of fair play. If we\ncan show that the survival of primitive superstitions is not\nthe real basis for Psychical Besearch, because the people who\ncherish them have no desire to test them, if we can show\nthat the traditional \" desire for immortality \" is a very doubt\nful ally, because it craves not knowledge but assurance, and\nresents the cautious advance of science, we can better claim\nthe support of that scientific curiosity which has done so much\nfor the advancement of knowledge, with a confidence we could\nnever have demanded so long as it seemed as though all the\nforces of superstitious obscurantism were arrayed on our side.\nAnd so finally it may come to be admitted that in this field\nalso the true obscurantists are those who declare a priori\n\f422 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nthat knowledge is impossible and all inquiry wicked and\nfutile, as much when they repose on the favteuils of the Koyal\nSociety, as when their indolence has taken shelter beneath the\naltars of some spiritual organisation.\nBut, it may be said, even granting this point, were not\nyour questions absurd ? Is it not grotesque to institute a\nplebiscite on questions of scientific fact ? Of what value can\nthe opinion of Tom, Dick, and Harry be on such a subject ?\nAnd you did not even ask for their opinions, you asked for\ntheir sentiments. You asked them what they wished, as if\nyou could supply them with spiritual refreshment according\nto taste, as if at the table d'hdte of life we could order what\nwe wanted, and our wishes made any difference to the stereo\ntyped menu of what we got. Could you really suppose that\nwishing could make us immortal, or that even the universality\nof a wish would constitute a real argument for immortality ?\nHas not common-sense long ago disposed of such vagaries of\nhuman conceit by the proverbial : \" If wishes were horses\nthen beggars would ride \" ?\nII.\nI hope that I shall not seem to have understated this\nindictment, and that I shall be permitted to explain how it\nbrings me to my second point. It must be confessed in the first\nplace that a great assumption underlay the form of our ques\ntions. We assumed that men's sentiments were usually more\npotent in swaying their action, more truly significant, than\ntheir opinions. By that assumption hangs a whole philosophy,\nwhich it is not the place here to justify. But whether or not\nthe voluniarist view of human nature is truer and deeper\nthan the intellectualist, I think sufficient independent reasons\nmay be given for asking for sentiments rather than opinions.\nWe realised, in the first place, that whatever we asked for,\nwe should inevitably get plenty of opinions as well. It is so\nmuch easier to give opinions, which can be picked up any\nwhere, than to analyse oneself and realise one's inner senti\nments. And secondly, opinions are so much cheaper and\nbetter known and less interesting. Had we asked for opinions,\nwe should have got only the stereotyped formulas, taken\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 423\nfrom books, sermons, aud newspapers, which shed so little\nlight on the motives that really actuate men. Thirdly, most\npeople's opinions are worthless on most subjects, and on\nthis particular subject it seemed that the people who had\ndone anything to entitle their opinions to scientific respect\nmight be counted on the fingers of one hand. Again, if, as\nwe assumed, it was typical of human nature for opinions\nto be adopted under the propulsion of sentiment, it was\nclear that in asking for the sentiment we were getting at\nthe real psychic force. And lastly, even in the cases where\npeople's opinions really produced their sentiments, it seemed\nthat they affected their actions through the latter, so that\nthe only case that might conceivably elude our inquiry was\nthat of people who feel one way and think another. But\nthis state of things is usually revealed in the answers to\nQuestions lie. and III., and appears to be rare.\nThese, then, were the reasons for preferring to ask for\nsentiments rather than opinions, As for the bearing of our\nwishes on our future, I should have thought that what is\ncalled \" the argument from universal consent \" was suffici\nently well known to appear to give point to an inquiry into\nthe actual universality of that consensus. But this was\nneither our whole, nor our real point. Our real point was\napparently too subtle to be perceived. It can, however, be\nmade plain. Let us examine \" if wishes were horses then\nbeggars would ride \" a little closer ; for like all proverbs it\nprobably requires more scrutiny than it will bear. In this\ncase it should strike us at once that even though beggars\ndo not yet prance about on horses, working men very\ncommonly ride bicycles. And the bicycle seems to be a\nmeans of locomotion vastly superior to the antiquated quad\nruped which was the summit of man's ambition in this\nrespect when some forgotten sage devised the proverb, and\nbefore a more progressive age had elaborated the railway,\nthe steamship, and the motor-car. I observe similarly that\nflying, which was long a proverbial impossibility, has now\nbecome a question of persevering experiment, and bids fair\nto become a commercial success in our life-time. And when\nI am asked how these observations should be interpreted, I\nam forced to answer as follows. The world is so con\n\f424 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nstructed that though it yields nothing to idle wishing, it\nwill yield even what seemed most hopelessly impossible to\nstrenuous and intelligent efforts to realise the objects of our\ndesire. All our inventions, therefore, the whole fabric of\napplied knowledge which renders civilised man master of the\nearth, are the embodied realisations of human desires, wrought\nout by the unremitting efforts of generations. Why then should\nwe not apply this principle to the matter in hand ?\nMay we not infer that this problem of a future life will\nprove no exception to the rule of the efficacy of the right\nsort of vsishing, that we can dissipate the clouds that seem\nso impenetrably to shroud the facts, if only we desire to\nfind out, and will set to work with the same patient and\nbusiness-like persistence we have shown everywhere else ?\nBut\u2014and this is our primary question\u2014do we desire to find\nout ? Is our professed desire genuine ? Is it extensive and\nintense enough ?\nHence my second point : even though it were quite true\nthat our desires do not affect the facts, and if I were\ndiscussing the subject exhaustively 1 I should have some\n1When we regard the matter with any subtlety it is by no means self-evident\nthat our desires make no difference. On the contrary, it will seem probable\nthat our desires may make a great difference, alike whether we argue from\n(1) the analogy of the present life, or (2) the assumption of a cosmic prin\nciple, more or less sympathising with us and our feelings. Under (1) consider\ne.g. the fact that we can extinguish our life here, if we will. Might there\nnot be analogous possibilities in other worlds ! If so, repeated suicide\nmight achieve the extinction desired. Again, we find our conditions here\nlargely plastic ; we can largely mould ourselves as we will. We can will to\nremember and to forget, to continue or to disavow our past, to reknit or to sever\nour social ties. If then in our life here every mental activity is intimately bound\nup with the character of our volition, is it not psychologically plausible to suppose\nthat this will continue to be the case, and that the question of the continuance or\nevanescence of the mental life we have known may depend, wholly or in part,\non our own action ! If it is true that every function in life waxes and wanes\naccording as it is exercised, why should not this law hold of life itself as a\nwhole ? In short, so soon as we abstain from rashly committing ourselves to\nthe antiquated metaphysic which rendered the soul's existence dependent on\nthat of an immutable \"substance,\" which was supposed to underlie its mani\nfestations, and conceive it as consisting essentially in the flow of its con\nsciousness, it becomes almost undeniable that our consciousness (and therefore\nour existence) must be affected, and may be controlled, by our own actions\nto an indefinite extent. Seeing that the soul's flow to some extent directs\nitself, may it not choose to flow either into arid regions in which the stream\n\fXLIX.] 425\nHuman Sentiment as to a Future Life.\nquestions to raise on this subject, they are yet germane to\nthe facts. For it is certain that our desires vitally affect\nour knowledge of the facts. With a desire not to know, the\ndiscovery and communication of knowledge are absolutely\nimpossible ; with no desire, there is no probability of know\nledge ; with desire, there is no impossibility of knowledge, or\nnone, at least, that can be entertained before inquiry.\nIII.\n^Having shown that the possibility of knowledge is con\nditioned by the desire for it, and that the desire is its\npresupposition and a first step to knowledge, we may now\nproceed to the inductive investigation of the desire and the\nway in which the questions were intended to elicit its\ncharacter.\nQuestion I.1 inquires broadly whether a desire for a future\nlife in general is felt.\nQuestion II. gives an opportunity of stating more precisely\nthe conditions under which the desire flourishes.\nof consciousness loses itself and is dried up, or into well-watered districts in\nwhich it is swollen to many times its former volume by the accretion of\nspiritual tributaries. These possibilities would become still stronger if we\nentertained the thought of a deeper soul-current of which our phenomenal\nconsciousness formed, as it were, a surface-eddy. In that case the mundane\nconsciousness might or might not penetrate and perpetuate itself into a future\nlife, more or less recognisably, according to its action in cultivating its\nmemories, affections, spiritual value and so forth.\n(2) Again, assuming the existence of a Deity capable of sympathetic\npersonal relations with us, it would seem to follow at once that our relations\nmust be affected by our wishes, prayers, and aspirations. According as we\nbehave we shall be treated. And if we prefer, or fit ourselves for, annihila\ntion, there is nothing absurd in the supposition that means may exist for\ngiving us our deserts. Even in theology the thought has not infrequently\nbeen expressed that we are not naturally or intrinsically immortal, but\nbecome so through accepting salvation by Christ. It is evident both that\nthis doctrine is morally superior to that of the eternal damnation of the\nreprobate, and also that it renders a future life so dependent on our own\naction, that no one could have it inflicted on him against his wish. Of course\nall these speculations must not be taken for more than they are worth,\nbut they suffice to show that we are not entitled to take it for granted a\npriori that our wishes and our actions have nothing to do with the \"facts\"\nwhich affect us.\n1 The questionnaire is reprinted in full in the Appendix, see p. 450.\n\f426 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nQuestion II. (a) \" Bo you desire a future life whatever the\nconditions might be?\" is intended for a desire strong enough to\ndemand a future life under any conditions. The existence of this\ndesire has been treated as an absurdity, or at least as a logical\nanomaly. How can any one really prefer hell to annihilation ?\nIndeed a distinguished philosopher argued that all the answers\nto the Questionnaire would be the same, because all rational\nbeings would prefer heaven to annihilation, and annihilation to\nhell. Nevertheless our philosopher was wrong. He had not\nmade sufficient allowance for the ability of human psychology\nto overcome difficulties which, as stated abstractly, seem to\nlogic sheer absurdities. And so it turns out that not only is\na real desire for the heaven of what used to be thought\northodoxy decidedly rare, but that a good many actually have\nso strong an objection to it that they assert that they would\nprefer annihilation. Moreover 22 per cent.\u2014739 out of 3321 \u2014\nof the answers agree with Huxley and Milton's Satan in\ndesiring a future life at all costs. Nor is there anything in\nthis preference which should be really unintelligible to a\nsympathetic psychologist. When taken in its context it\nusually appears to be due (1) to a strong feeling of repug\nnance to annihilation ; or (2) to an instinctive love of life so-\nintense as to carry with it an emotional assurance that its\npossessor at least must survive death ; or (3) to a conviction\noften expressed by spiritists, that they know the conditions of\nthe future life sufficiently to take all risks ; (4) to a general\nconfidence in one's ability to render the conditions tolerable\n(which appears to have been the source of Huxley's preference) ;\n(5) to the confidence sometimes expressed by liberal Christians\nthat the conditions may be left to a benevolent God who\n\" will not toss to hell the luckless pots he marred in making \" ;\nand lastly (6), in a few cases to the overwhelming impression\nmade by a recent bereavement. It appears, therefore, that\nall these answers are interesting and intelligible, and that this\nquestion was not asked in vain.\nQuestion II. (b) \" What would have to be the character of a\nfuture life to make the prospect seem tolerable ? Would you, e.g.,\nbe content with a life more or less like your present life ? \" was\nso phrased in order to discover what are the least favourable\nconditions which would appear tolerable. It contains an\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 427\ninvitation to compare the future life desired with the actuality\nexperienced. Do people want something like it or something\ndifferent ? Do they insist on something better, or would\nthey prefer a future life of the same sort to extinction ?\nThe answers are to some extent marred by a tendency to\nstate rather the maximum which is desired than the minimum\nwhich would be accepted. Still it is clear that the answers\nto this question throw some light on the state of feeling\nwith regard to the value of this life. Those who answer yes,\nand they seem to be a large majority, take an optimistic\nview of its value ; while those who say no may do so either\nbecause they have very exalted notions of what the future\nlife should be, or a very low opinion of what the present\nlife is. Their other answers usually enable one to decide\nthis point.\nQuestion II. (c) \" Can you say what elements (if any) are\nfelt by you to call for the perpetuity of life\" was added at\nthe suggestion of the great psychologist, William James. It\naims at discovering what reasons people give to themselves\nfor desiring a future life. But, unfortunately, it has not\nworked very well, partly because it is too difficult to be\nreadily answered by people who have given very little thought\nto the matter, partly because so many put down not so much\nwhat they feel, but what they think they ought to feel. This\nlatter is of course a natural tendency of the human mind\nagainst which all such inquiries have to struggle throughout:\nit ordinarily requires considerable education and some practice\nin introspection to distinguish between the two even in one's\nown mind. And in this case the temptation to put down\nwhat tended to edification was increased by an ambiguity in\nthe question, which might be understood to ask not for the\nelements in life which made the answerer desire perpetuity,\nbut those which in his opinion rendered it objectively desirable\n(a very different thing).\nThe answers therefore were very various, the incompleteness\nof earthly life and the need of justice and reunion being\nperhaps the most prominent grounds assigned by those who\nanswered affirmatively. The chief reasons assigned in the\nnegative answers (1) were the misery of this world, (2) the\ninconceivableness of another. I have not had time to work\n\f428 [part\nF. C. 8. Schiller.\nout the exact figures of the answers to this question, but\nhave been somewhat impressed with the comparative rarity\nof the demand for selfish pleasure or even happiness : unless\nthose who answered were an unusually high-minded set of\npeople, it would seem that moralists must have libelled human\nnature somewhat grossly in assuming the practical universality\nof hedonistic motives.\nQuestion III. \" Can you state why you feel in this way as\nregards Questions I. and II.?\" The answers to this question\nrun very much into those to Question II. (c), and are not\nworth discussing apart. The question itself was inserted\nsimply and solely to provide for those who thought that their\nsentiments were determined by their religious or scientific\nconvictions, in order that they might state that in their case\nsentiment and belief were not discordant. In spite, however,\nof the emphasis on this point in the preamble, a good many\npersons complained that they could not properly answer the\nquestions because their sentiments did agree with their con\nvictions, and some even made it into their excuse for declining\nto answer altogether. One can only suppose that they either\ndid not read the preamble at all, or did not read it to the\nend, for of course the section in the preamble asking for\nsentiments as far as possible separated from convictions was\nonly intended (1) to enable people to avoid expressing their\nconvictions by asking only for the (less compromising) sentiments,\n(2) to draw their attention to the fact that their sentiment\nmight not at all accord with their beliefs. Of course this\nconfession was frequently made in the answers, but on the\nwhole the question was a failure. A great many answered no,\nand the answers were mostly much the same as those to\nII. (c). Keligion was alleged as the ground of sentiment more\nrarely than might have been expected, perhaps in consequence\nof misunderstanding, but its influence upon sentiment appeared\nto be much greater than that of science.\nQuestion IV. \" Bo you now feel the question of a future\nlife to be of urgent importance to your mental comfort t\" brings\nus to the cardinal point of the questionnaire. The answers to\nthe first question supplied an inadequate test of the desire for\na future life, in that everybody who had a preference, however\nfaint and occasional, for continuance would answer it affirma\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 429\ntively, especially as the second question enabled him to name\nhis own conditions. Practically all except those who did not\nwant a future life at any price could answer the first two\nquestions by a more or less qualified affirmative. Hence\nmany who gravely doubted, or quite disbelieved, the possi\nbility of a future life answered these questions in the affirma\ntive. But such persons would not usually admit that the\nquestion possessed urgency for their mental comfort. Accord\ningly we get here a considerable predominance of noes (1314\nyes out of 3321), and these are often of a very decided\ncharacter, ' not at all,' ' not in the least,' ' never think about it,y\nbeing common phrases.\nA certain difficulty was caused by those who had never\nentertained a doubt, or had trained themselves to regard a\nfuture life as certain, and then dismissed the matter from\ntheir minds. On the whole these had to be counted as yeses,\nespecially when it was expressly stated that though a future\nlife might not be often thought of, yet to lose this assurance'\nwould amount to a spiritual catastrophe. On the other hand,\nsome of those who attribute to themselves a faith so firm that\nthey ' never think about it,' seem to be making their ' faith '\nan excuse for a practical neglect of such spiritual matters.\nOn the whole the answers to this question seem distinctly\nunfavourable to the doctrine that the interest actually taken\nin the matter of a future life is commensurate with its.\nspiritual importance, or that the question looms as large on\nour mental horizon as tradition had assumed. Nor is this-\npsychologically at all surprising. We could not do our work\nefficiently here if our concern about the future were to become\nseriously distracting. But there are many ways (as we saw)\nof preventing such concern from reaching a dangerous intensity.\nIndeed it is rather the frequency of utter absorption in worldly\naffairs that gives one a sort of aesthetic shock.\nQuestion V., inquiring into the changes in people's feelings,\nwas something of a disappointment to me personally. Before\nseeing the results, I had argued in the Fortnightly Review,\nSeptember, 1901 (p. 439),1 that the reason why the feeling of\nthe literature- producing minority as to the importance of the\nfuture life had imposed itself on the masses was partly that the\n1 In an essay reprinted in Humanism, p. 242,\n\f430 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nlatter were too indifferent to contradict them, partly that at one\ntime or other nearly every one did get stirred up about it, and\nthat the memory of this phase of opinion disposed to ready\nacquiescence in the assertion of the immense importance of the\nquestion. But it appears that a large proportion (probably more\nthan half) deny that their feelings have changed in any important\ndegree. It would seem, therefore, that even in questioning its\nuniversality I still exaggerated the extent of the real interest in\nthe question when I supposed that nearly everybody must have\nfelt at least a temporary concern about it. I did not allow\nsufficiently for the prevalence of sheer thoughtlessness and inertia,\nnor for the number of those who have never cared to go into the\ngrounds of their belief.\nIt is possible, however, in this case to go behind the actual\nreturns, and to doubt whether on this point they fairly represent\nthe actual facts. There is a natural tendency to represent\noneself in memory as more consistent than contemporary docu\nments would quite warrant, and one cannot but suspect that\nphrases like ' not materially,' 'only development? ' not change but\ngrowth,' may really cover very substantial alterations of belief\nand sentiment. Again, answers like, ' not that I can remember,'\n' not as far as I know,' sound suspicious, and it seems not\nimprobable that in the course of years many considerable changes\nmay have been forgotten.\nStill, I must admit that the returns show comparatively little\nevidence of great spiritual revolutions, and still less of any con\nsiderable or lasting mental anaruish connected with them. The\napparent absence of any widespread spiritual distress is certainly\nvery striking and surprising, though here again this might per\nhaps have been inferred from the surface indications of general\nplacidity and contentment. It would seem that spiritual crises\nand prolonged religious excitements are the prerogative of ex\nceptional temperaments ; ordinary persons seem to adjust them\nselves easily and rapidly to their definitive attitude.1\nQuestion VI., again, is very important, as inquiring directly\ninto the existence of a will to know. Indeed it is the compari\nson of the answer to this question with that to Question IV.\n1 This fact, if such it be, should evidently be borne in mind in reading studies\nof the extremer forms of spiritual temperament, e.g. James's Varieties of Religiom\nExperience.\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 431\nwhich will usually determine the character of the answer. The\nalternatives, \" would you prefer to know for certain or to leave\nit a matter of faith ? \" are not of course exhaustive ; and they\nmay even be taken in a sense in which they are not exclusive.\nIndeed, like all the words of ordinary language, the terms\n' knowledge ' and ' faith ' are very ambiguous. This was not\ninfrequently pointed out in replies which held that ' faith ' was\npractically ' knowledge,' or included ' knowledge,' or was higher\nthan ' knowledge,' and it was of course perfectly well known to\nus. But we wanted to suggest to them a choice between the\ntwo alternatives which we believed would at first sight most\nreadily present themselves.\nAt first sight the results may seem excellent from an S.P.R.\npoint of view, and be supposed to show the existence of a decided\npreference for knowledge. For out of a total of about 3218 replies\na clear majority of 1706 seem to vote for 'knowledge,' as against\n'faith,' 749; 'ignorance,' etc., 415; and 'indifference,' 107.\nOf course, however, the question remains how far these figures\ncan be accepted as representative. But apart from this it is\nevident that large deductions have, unfortunately, to be made\nfrom the figures as they stand. It is morally certain, e.g. that\na large number of indifferents have put themselves down as\ndesiring to know and as possessing faith, and that to obtain\na trustworthy indication of the desire to know, we must try\nto weed them out, in order to find out how many really desire\nto know.\nOf those who voted for ' knowledge ' we strike out there\nfore (1) those who showed a negative or indifferent attitude\ntowards the first question and who, therefore, would like to\nknow only that there was no future life, and sometimes state\nthis expressly (225). We may dismiss (2) those who only want\nto know on general grounds or use phrases indicating that\ntheir preference for knowledge is very slight or doubtful (123).\nWe may eliminate (3) those who would like to know but\nthink knowledge impossible, and seem too contented with this\nstate of things to be credited with any but a conditional\ndesire to know (64). Deducting these, our majority disappears,\nand our numbers are reduced to 1294. (4) We can hardly\nrely without reservation on the desire to know of those who\nstipulate that they want assurance only of the fact of a future\n2f\n\f432 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nlife, or of its pleasantness, even though, if they really tried to\nknow, they might discover that to know the ' fact ' they needed\nalso to establish a great many of the details (102). (5) And\nlastly, those (511) who would prefer knowledge after answering\nQuestion IV. in the negative, can hardly in the vast majority\nof cases be supposed to have a very keen desire for scientific\ncertainty on the subject. Answers of this type coming from\nmembers of the S.P.R, or showing other internal evidence\nof a genuine desire to know, have, however, been retained\nin the list of those who desire to know. Nor (6) can we\nappeal to those (178) who are already certain that there is\na future life to support a scientific investigation of its existence.\n(7) On the other hand, we may add to the effective desire to\nknow the votes of the very few who, though personally satis\nfied with faith, desire scientific proof for the sake of their\nweaker brethren.\nMaking these alterations and throwing out some answers\n(42), in which insufficient details are given to determine the\nnature of the desire to know, we find that 681 out of 3218,\ni.e. rather over 21 per cent., may be credited with a real\ndesire for scientific knowledge of the possibility of a future\nlife.1 That still seems fairly satisfactory, but I fear that even\nso these figures enormously exaggerate the actual importance\nof this desire. For they doubtless include the votes of many\nwhose desire to know, though real enough, is not very strong,\nand would not impel them to inconvenience themselves in order\nto satisfy it. And moreover, I shall have to admit that there\nis a probability that the questionnaire has unduly selected those\nwho desire to know, so that about one out of five indicates\nthe maximum, but not the probable, strength of the desire.\nIV.\nProvisionally, however, and until better ones are attainable,\nlet us accept these figures, and proceed to ask, what do they\nprove ? How far can they be trusted to give a true picture\nof the state of human sentiment generally ?\nThe question needs careful consideration, because it is mainly\nat this point that the value of our results will be impugned,\n1 See Appendix for the detailed table of figures.\n\fXLIX.] 433\nHuman Sentiment as to a Future Life.\nespecially by those who do not like the conclusions to which\nthey point.\nLet us admit in the first place that the results are incom\nplete. At best they represent the sentiment only of an infinit\nesimal fraction even of English-speaking humanity. But I would\nbeg to point out that such incompleteness is inevitable, and\ninseparable not merely from all such statistical, but also from\nall inductive inquiry. All the great inductive generalisations\nrest in the first instance on samples selected from a vastly\nmore extensive material. The geographer maps out the ocean\nfloor by taking soundings every ten miles, or infers its character\nfrom little samples of the abysmal mud. The doctor describes\nthe symptoms of a disease from a few cases. The chemist\ndescribes the properties of the rarer and more difficult chemicals\non the basis of a few experiments, repeated perhaps at intervals\nof a generation. The psychologist in his generalisations about\nhuman nature has hitherto rested on little but introspection of\nhimself, and even in the new experimental school he is making\ninductions from a few dozen or hundred pupils whom he can\ntest in his laboratories. And so forth throughout the sciences.\nThe value of such reasonings depends entirely on the\nquestion whether we have secured fair samples of a mate\nrial which it is impossible to examine exhaustively. And thus\nthe only really relevant question as to our results is: Can\nthey be regarded as \"fair samples \" of human desire ?\n(I.) I hope it will be admitted that the questions them\nselves were fair, and gave no indication of any bias or\ntendency. Not of course that they escaped criticism on this\naccount. But the criticisms about cancel each other. Some\nthought that the answer yes was desired to the first question,\nothers the answer no, some that we were too scientific,\nothers that we were not scientific enough. Here e.g. are\nthe comments of a widow lady of mature experience : \" I\ncan never sympathise with any Psychical Research Society\nwhile it is conducted on the present highly emotional lines\nthat tend to hysterical illusions.\" I hope that this judg\nment will make a proper impression on our sceptics, and\ninduce them to abstain from pampering such illusions in\nfuture !\nThe religious bearing of the questions has been variously\n\f434 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nconstrued in much the same way. To scientific materialists\nthe mere fact that they emanated from Psychical Research\ncircles has seemed sufficient to condemn them ; over-anxious\nbelievers have expressed their fears that their effect must be\nanti-religious, that only infidels, agnostics, and heretics would\nanswer them, that no orthodox Christian would stand such\nsearching interrogation, and that reflection was sure to be\ndetrimental to faith. As I shall presently show how ground\nless these apprehensions were, I shall now merely point out\nthat, whatever might be read into them, the questions them\nselves were, and were intended to be, wholly impartial and\ndevoid of tendency either for or against any religious view.\nAnd on the whole they were so understood and answered\nfreely by all sorts of men, including a considerable number\nof clergymen of all denominations, without leading to any diffi\nculties. Indeed, although we did not ask for it, we obtained\nfar more information as to our correspondents' religious opinions\nthan we had expected.\n(II.) As to the distribution of circulars. Questionnaires\nwere sent to the members of the American Branch of the\nS.P.R., of the American Psychological Association, and of the\nMind Association. Appeals were also inserted in the S.P.R's\nJournal, the International Journal of Ethics and Mind. In\nAmerica a number of copies were sent also to the daily\npress. In the September 1901 number of the Fortnightly\nReview I sought to raise the question in an article entitled,\n\" Do men desire immortality ? \" 1 This brought me in a large\namount of correspondence, and a certain amount of notice in\nthe press. Mr. B. J. Padshah reprinted the Questionnaire in\nBombay, and circulated it in India, especially among the Parsis;\nMr. Stanton Coit reprinted it in Ethics, and circulated it among\nthe members of Ethical Societies. We are greatly indebted\nto both of these gentlemen for valuable and interesting batches\nof answers, whose type differed materially from the rest, and\nserved the purpose of ' control ' experiments. The editor of\nthe Jewish Quarterly wrote an interesting discussion in his\nOctober 1901 number and himself answered the questions, and\nthere were more or less complete translations, with more or less\n\u25a0comment, in a considerable number of foreign papers (especially\n1 Since then included in my Humanism (1903).\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 435\nspiritistic) in most civilised countries, except Germany. On\nthe whole, however, it cannot be said that we succeeded in\narousing any considerable interest in the press, and it is\nquite possible that the able editors who deemed the subject\nunworthy even of a ' silly season ' discussion, correctly gauged\nthe extent of public interest in the matter. Meanwhile,\ncopies of the Questionnaire were freely issued to any one\nwho desired to answer, and was willing to collect answers\nfrom others, and this method on the whole proved the\nmost satisfactory. Altogether about 10,000 copies were\ncirculated. It will be seen, however, that mainly owing to the\nslenderness of our resources, the distribution must be pro\nnounced to have been quite random and unsystematic.\nNow, would this distribution be likely to induce a selection and\nbias in the answers obtained ? I am afraid this question must\nbe answered in the affirmative. (1) The agency of the S.P.R\nwas undoubtedly prejudicial in scientific circles, in which both\nbias and occupation would most dispose towards negative answers,\nand de facto only a comparatively small number of answers\nwere returned thence. (2) A disproportionate number of\nanswers came from the Society's members, e.g. from 248, i.e.\nabout half, of the American Branch. And in them the desire\nto know was very markedly greater than in the average\nanswers, and rose to over 50 per cent.1 (3) Probably the\nspiritists were over-represented in the answers, not so much\nbecause they were more disposed to answer, as because so\nmany spiritist papers reprinted the questionnaire. And they\nwere nearly always either ' certain ' or desirous of knowing.\nIt is clear, however, that the whole of this preferential\ncollection or bias would tend to increase the number of yeses\nto Q. I., IV. and VI. (a). In other words, the desire to know\ncan hardly be stronger than is indicated by the returns : it\nmay be very much weaker. As far as the Society, therefore,\nis concerned, the social situation cannot be more favourable,\nand may be indefinitely less so.\n(III.) As to the question of what sort of people answered.\nHere, again, we were favoured with many forecasts, which, as\nusually happens to such a priori efforts of the imagination^\n1 Even so, as only about one half of the members answered, this would\nnot necessarily represent more than a quarter of the Branch.\n\f43G [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nwere on the whole mistaken. If I had to answer in a single\nphrase I should have to say that all sorts of people answered ;\ni.e. the answers exhibited an astounding variety of sentiment,\nfar greater than anything we had expected, prepared though\nwe were for a good deal. In reading them one could not\nhelp wondering how persons, whose sentiments were so radi\ncally different, yet managed to live together in the same\nworld, and felt assured that a real and literal uniformity of\nbelief, the idol to which bigots and fanatics have offered\nsuch inhuman sacrifices, was rendered impossible by the\npsychological constitution of human nature itself. For even\nwhen two can be found to subscribe to the same intellectual\nformulas, the spiritual atmosphere in which they are bathed\nis different. Duo si dicunt (faciunt) idem non est idem.\nNot that there could not be made out certain well-marked\ntypes of sentiment, or that the different types were equally\ndisposed to answer. In some there was, of course, as we\nexpected, a good deal of reluctance. The questions were\nbound to seem novel and unusual, unpractical, nay, useless.\nEven to experts in introspection and self-examination they\npresented considerable difficulty, which might lead to the\nunpleasant discovery that one did not have the beliefs and\nsentiments one would like to have, or supposed oneself to\nhave. And apart from the particular questions, one knew,\nof course, that some are as immovably unwilling to answer\npersonal questions as others are eager to oblige the world\nwith their personal reactions. The subject of inquiry in such\ncases is quite a secondary consideration. If you got up an\ninquiry into what size of hats, or what shape of boots people\nwore, persons of the first type would refuse on the ground\nthat the subject was \" too sacred,\" while those of the second\nwould hasten to write, \" You will be interested to know that\nI wear 7\/V hats, and abhor pointed toes.\" The great mass\nof mankind, however, is intermediate between these extremes,\nand while reluctant to put itself to any appreciable trouble\nor expense for the sake of science, can be induced to answer,\nif pressed, and in order to oblige a friend, and I should\njudge that the great bulk of our answers came from people\n'of this sort. At all events the opinions held do not seem\nto have seriously hindered any one in answering, provided that\n\fXLix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 437\nanything else disposed him to do so. Answers came which\nillustrated every conceivable variety of opinion, and some\nwhich one would hardly have deemed conceivable. Hence\nI am inclined to think that even types of sentiment, which\nusually resulted only in refusals, were occasionally represented\nin the answers of people who only just consented to answer.\nConsider e.g. the following answers : I. Yes, if agreeable.\nIla. Certainly not. lib. Yes. 11c. Too complicated. 111. Too\nlazy to think it out. IV. Not at all. V. Never thought about it.\nVI. Now that attention is called- to it, would like to know.\nRemarks: \"A stupid and useless inquiry.\" This set of answers\nseems to me to throw a flood of light on a state of mind\nwhich is probably very common, but only rarely finds such\nracy expression. Again, let us see what we can make of\nthe common sentiment that the subject is \" too sacred \" to\nbe talked about. As a rule people who feel in this way\nwill refuse to answer, but occasionally they analyse their\nsentiment for us first. E.g. a collector reports the refusal of\na lady who said it was \" too sacred,\" but immediately afterwards\nshe honestly added, \" besides my feelings fluctuate too much ; when\nI am ill or unhappy I long for annihilation, when I am stronger\nand lutppier I would prefer to live after death.\" Here the\nquestion evidently stimulated to the analysis of a sentiment,\nwhich in the great majority of such cases would have been\naccepted at its face value. Here is another analysis, not so\nfrank, though perhaps on a somewhat higher plane of feeling.\nA literary man writes in answer to Q. VI. \" Even a proof of\nimmortality, supposing that proof to take, let us say, the form\nof a mathematical demonstration,1 would seem to me to have\nsomething revolting about it, something that in an indefinable\nway offends the finer feelings, something that, for lack of a\nbetter term, I may call 'impious.' In attempting to answer\nthis question I feel myself somewhat in the state of mind\nthat, I fancy, moves many of those, to whom this set of\nquestions is submitted, to refuse to answer any of them.\"\nIt is clear that such types of sentiment though they may\nbe common enough, will occur but rarely in the answers.\n1This notion, that complete proof would assume the form of mathematical\ndemonstration, occurs very commonly. It shows that modern logic has\nnot penetrated far beyond professional circles.\n\f438 F, C. S. Schiller.\nAgain there are indications that negative answers to Question\nI. were harder to poll than affirmative. This is natural enough,\nseeing that\n(1) Almost without exception, those who do not desire a\nfuture life would be indifferent about it and do not care to\ninquire into it.\n(2) They would suspect a ' psychical research ' questionnaire.\n(3) They might still be sufficiently impressed by the con\nventional belief to shrink from an avowal that their desire\nconflicted with it. And\n(4) in spite of the unreserved candour of many of the\nnegative answers, there were signs in others of attempts to\nconceal their real tendency.\n(5) It was quite in accordance with these indications that\nthe scattering answers volunteered from out of the way and\nnon-English speaking places in French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch,\nBelgian, Russian, Polish, etc., were, with hardly an exception,\nenthusiastically affirmative. People did not similarly write from\nthe ends of the earth to tell us that they did not want to\nlive after death.\nAs regards the religiously \" orthodox,\" I think it probable\nthat they also did not poll their full vote, though there were\nplenty of answers animated by various forms of Christian\nsentiment. Here again there are intelligible reasons.\n(1) Faith in its weaker forms seems hardly capable of\narticulate expression, and indeed will hardly bear inspection\neven by its possessor :\n(2) It is often used as a sort of anodyne and excuse for\nnot troubling further about matters ' best left to God.'\n(3) Possibly the robuster forms of religious faith, which\nwould be glad of an opportunity to bear witness to the truth,\nare not now so common as one imagines they once were.\nBut even if the returns fail to give ' orthodox ' sentiment\nits proper weight, the correction which must be made on this\nscore will only strengthen the argument. For inasmuch as\nthose who have it almost invariably prefer ' faith ' to ' know\nledge ' in answering Question VI., it is manifest that, like the\nagnostics and indifferents, their answers would only have reduced\nthe percentage of those interested in finding out, more or less\nscientifically, whether there is not a future life.\n\fXLIX.] 439\nHuman Sentiment as to a Future Life.\nv.\nWith regard to the tone of the answers there was a commend\nable absence of jocosity. Whether it was that the subject was\ntoo solemn even for the funny men or that they did not know\nin what direction fun could be made of it, it is hard to say ;\nI can only report the almost total absence of buffoonery and\neven of deliberate flippancy. ' Crank ' effusions also were com\nparatively rare, and easily detected by their inability to answer\nthe questions at all. In general the tone of the answers was\ndistinguished by a high degree of sincerity, frequently attaining\nto extraordinary heights of frankness. In saying this I do\nnot of course mean to affirm that the psychological self-analysis\nwas always correct : I mean to say only that people generally\nseemed to express as far as they were able what seemed to\nthem the truth about their feelings. Even therefore where the\nanalysis was probably wrong or incomplete, it yielded psycho\nlogical facts of a sort. For a man's estimate of himself is\nan important fact about him and a factor in his actions.\nOn the whole we may draw this conclusion, that though\nthe answers may not reflect the actual distribution of the various\ntypes of sentiment, they may yet be taken to be a fair sample\nfor the purpose of the main problem of this inquiry. Or\nrather it is an unfair sample, in that it exaggerates the extent\nof the desire for knowledge of a future life ; but in spite of\nthis unfairness, the returns show a hitherto hardly suspected\nweakness of this desire, and thereby answer the question into\nwhich it was necessary for the S.P.R. to inquire. This con\nclusion may be regarded as fairly probable, if not as strictly\ndemonstrated : it is at all events more probable than any other,\nand if any one desires to contest it, it is incumbent on him to\namass more numerous, exact and decisive data than those we\nhave been able to obtain. I can only wish him God speed\nand joy of the labour. For the present the results of the\nQuestionnaire afford a definite basis of psychological fact for\narguing the question such as has not hitherto existed. And\nfurther, we are, I think, henceforth entitled to put in a warning\nand a protest against the fruitless discussion of such questions\non grounds of mere a priori probabilities, or literary traditions.\nWhile admitting that these always afford a certain measure of\n\f440 [part\nF. G. S. Schiller.\ntruth, and while deeply impressed by the way in which a literary\ntradition tends not only to perpetuate, but also to verify, itself,\nI must contend that such grounds of argument are essentially\nunsafe until supplemented and confirmed by a first hand in\nvestigation of the actual facts, wherever this is possible.\nAnd I may add that many other ethical and aesthetical\ndiscussions appear to me to flounder in quagmires of this sort.\nVI.\nI shall only permit myself to discuss one more point in\nthis paper, viz. whether any practical corollary can be drawn\nfrom these scientific results. And I may begin by admitting\nthat a very specious plea may be put in against proceeding to\nany practical inferences. For why not let the matter rest\nthere ? Is not everything for the best in the best of all possible\nworlds ? On your own showing all or nearly all seem admirably\nadjusted to the present situation, and to have just that degree\nof knowledge or lack of knowledge which suits them and which\nthey desire.\nFor consider : those who ' know ' that there is, or is not,\na future life are content with their inward conviction or scientific\nreasoning. Those who ' have faith ' can feel that it is far higher\nand holier and more meritorious than the vulgarities of scientific\nknowledge ; and they too are satisfied. Those who delight in\nuncertainty and the play of fancy, can indulge in these to their\nheart's content. Those who are addicted to a priori demonstra\ntions either way can construct them without stint or fear of\nverification. The great army of the indifferent can afford to\nremain neutral towards the inconclusive combats of the fanatics\non either side. The matter-of-fact and worldly-minded have a\nright to ignore a future too uncertain to affect reasonable action.\nEven those who desire to know are but rarely distracted by\na painful craving, and are usually easy to convince that so\nperilous a knowledge is wisely withheld from them. Even those\nwho (unreasonably) fear lest knowledge should blast their hopes\nare at least secured against the fore-knowledge of their vanity.\nIt is true that a few still exhibit a divergence between desire\nand expectation, but experience shows that such discrepancies\nare essentially temporary, and that the one or the other always\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment ak tb a Future Life. 441\nadjusts the other into harmony with itself, by a process which is\nusually rapid and painless and unaccompanied by any lasting\ndistress. In fact, amid all the various phenomena of human\npsychology, distress due to uncertainty about one's fate after\ndeath seems to be one of the rarest.\nAn optimistic defender of the status quo might proceed to\nadorn his picture of the general satisfaction with loftier appeals\nto philosophy and religion. He would doubtless improve the\noccasion to enlarge on the limitations of human faculty and\nthe presumption of seeking to comprehend the unknowable.\nOr again, he would castigate the impiety of desiring a know\nledge which the Divine Wisdom had withheld from us, and\nurge that if God had intended us to know He would have\nrendered the fact of immortality more evident to us, by reason,\nrevelation, or experience.\nIt will be seen, therefore, that a very strong case can be\nmade out against the scientific research to which we are pledged,\nand I am quite sure that however strenuously we may impugn\nthe reasons advanced, we can do but little to mitigate the\nprejudice from which they spring. The great forces which\nimpel men are not in their essence rational, but inasmuch as\nit is only by reasoning that they are accessible, they must\nbe argued with as best we can.\nI must remark, then, in the first place that a substantially\nsimilar case might have been made out against any attempt\nat advancing knowledge. For whatever our ignorance, there\nalways exists a certain contentment with it, a sort of social\nequilibrium or adjustment, which it is inconvenient and distress\ning to disturb. And this mood of acquiescence in the actual\nwill always seek to appear respectable by appealing to higher\nconsiderations. The classical example of this attitude towards\nthe restless progressiveness of scientific research is the famous\nletter of the Cadi of Bagdad to Sir A. Layard in reply to\na request for statistics concerning the trade and population\nof his province.1 Alike for exquisiteness of phrasing and piety\nof sentiment I have not found anything to touch it in Occidental\nliterature or in the questionnaire answers. And certainly no other\ndocument reveals so plainly and delightfully how many of these\nebullitions of piety really spring from the abysses of indolence,\n1Quoted by William James, Principles of Psychology, Vol. II. p. 640.\n\f442 F. C. S. Schiller. [part\nand are inspired by aversion from what seems uninteresting\nand unprofitable knowledge. Against the Cadi of Bagdad,\nhowever, I should venture to quote the truer and nobler\ndoctrine of Xenophanes :\nov rot ajr' apx^5 \"\"avra Oeot Ovr^roU irapl8ti\u00a3av\naAAa fyjrovvTts i<ptvpl(TKOVfTiv aptivov.\n\" Surely the gods have not displayed all things to men from\nthe beginning, but they, in time, by seeking, find out a better\nway.\" On its intrinsic merits of course this pseudo-religious\nargument against research hardly deserves refutation. It is\nessentially the argument of the Peculiar People against the\nstudy and practice of medicine. Nor do I think that it is\nmuch more plausible to argue that if God had intended us\nto know He would have spared us the trouble and the discipline\nof finding out, than to say that if God had meant us to wear\nclothes we should have been born, like the angels, with becom\ning costumes.\nWith the plea of merely philosophic agnosticism it is possible\nto make short work. It suffices to say that no one can know\nwhere the limits of the possible are laid down until he has\ntried. And in this case no one has tried in any rational or\npersistent manner. No one, therefore, has a right to declare\nthis particular knowledge impossible a priori.\nOn the other hand, I should like to appeal for support to\nthe general desire for knowledge as such. But I fear it may\nbe too rare and faint a feeling to bear the burden of so great\nan enterprise. Moreover, those who are capable of feeling it\nare for the most part already absorbed in other subjects of\nresearch, easier and more directly profitable, if less momentous,\nthan ours. Nevertheless, it should, I think, be borne in mind\nthat the success of this, as of other branches of the Society's\nwork, must continue to depend somewhat on the ' disinterested '\nassistance of those who seek knowledge ' for its own sake.'\nBut I feel that their might is as nothing compared with that\nof the ancient, and deep-seated distrust of knowledge, of the\nsocial instinct which in the past has immolated on a thousand\npyres the psychics it had turned into ' witches ' and the men\nof science it had decried as ' magicians.' Here as elsewhere\nwe should deprecate, now as ever, its subtle and nefarious\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 443\ninfluence. Experience has always so far shown it to be\ngroundless. Instead of being a source of incalculable dangers,\nknowledge has always issued in unexpected ameliorations of\nhuman life. All analogy, therefore, would lead one to suppose\nthat a gradual and dearly-bought acquisition of progressive\nknowledge of the laws regulating our post-mortem careers would\nbe predominantly good and useful, bracing and invigorating.\nFor real knowledge can only confirm, it cannot destroy, our\nhopes. A disproof of a future life must, it seems, be a priori,\nand on that breeding-ground of subtle fallacy, the a priori realm,\nthe most ingenious intellects may be defied to discover anything\nreally cogent. As soon as we consent to appeal to evidence,\non the other hand, a good deal will depend on the sort of\nevidence to which we choose to appeal. Hitherto our\nscience has, by accident quite as much as by preference,\ndwelt on the physical and physiological considerations\nwhich render the notion of a future life for the individual\nso remote and improbable as necessarily to drive it from\nthe foreground of consciousness. But an absolute disproof\nof the doctrine by such methods seems to be logically in\nconceivable, for reasons I have elsewhere developed at some\nlength.1 The effect of all psychic research, on the other hand,\nmust be to keep the mind open to possibilities of a very\ndifferent order. Psychical science, in so far as it leads to\nresults, can only confirm the belief in a future life. But\nscience is always gradual ; its advances are as slow, though\nnot as inevitable, as the mills of the gods. There is no fear\nof our finding out all at once. To demonstrate immortality\nby a single dramatic coup de Mdtre is impossible. Even if a\ncase could be produced so complete as to lack no element of\nlogical conclusiveness it would convince none but those who\ncame prepared to be convinced. For, as we have seen, a great\nmany, perhaps a majority, are not psychologically disposed to\nbe convinced. They have not cultivated a mind open for the\nreception of such novelties. Their old prejudices must be\nploughed up before the new knowledge can take root in their\nmind. And this is a long and difficult process. There is no\nfear, therefore, that the millennium will come upon us in the\n1 Humanism, p. 288 ; (Proceedings S.P.S., Vol. XV. p. 63), and Riddles of the\nSphinx, pp. 393-4.\n\f444 [part\nF. G. S, Schiller.\ntwinkling of an eye. There will always be scope for our hopes\nto guide our researches, for our faith to outstrip our knowledge.\nOur metaphysicians will still be able to skirmish in advance\nof the serried ranks of our scientists, and indeed may con\nceivably be stimulated to more effective speculations by the\ndiscovery of more copious and trustworthy data-\nNor do I think that an advance of psychical knowledge\nsuch as we have contemplated would really detract from the\nvalue of Faith. Those who now content themselves with\n\" faith,\" whether it takes the form of religious conviction or\nof an immediate inner consciousness (which we may call\nmystical, if we define as the essence of mysticism the power of\ndispensing with reasoning processes in attaining certainty), appear\nto reach a degree of certainty which seems quite to transcend\nscientific knowledge and makes it look hopelessly humdrum and\nsuperfluous. It seems a profanation to patch upon the radiant\nrobes of faith, upon the seamless splendour of a speckless\nassurance, a sordid backing laboriously woven of the grey,\ntenacious threads of scientific inference. Yet these glorious\nfabrics of faith are not exempt from mortal weakness. Just in\nproportion as they transcend the support of logic they become\nexposed to incalculable dangers. They suffer from the vicissi\ntudes of faith in the extra-logical realm in which they float.\nThe spiritual forces that generated them so unaccountably may\nas unexpectedly destroy them. And, socially, they all exhibit\none fatal and fundamental flaw. They are individual and\nincommunicable; their raptures and their restfulness cannot be\ntransferred to others. Nay, regarded in the cold cruel light\nof a sceptical reason, their magic sheen appears to leave them.\nThey look rather like paltry gossamer, flimsy structures of a\nfutile imagination, and piteously unfit to clothe the human\nspirit in a work-a-day world.\nAnd so the science of the day writes down our various faiths\nas curious, and mainly pathological, products of the imagination,\nand passes sternly on, in silent condemnation. This utter\ndeprecation of their spiritual experiences, which is implied in\nthe methods, far more than it is expressed in the dogmas, of\npositive science, is felt of course in various ways by the\npossessors of these forms of faith. In some it produces\nalienation from science and all its ways. Others content\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 445\nthemselves with their self-centred and subjective certainty.\nOthers more unselfishly declare that they would like knowledge\nto be added to faith for the sake of less richly favoured\nsouls. Others again, and theirs is perhaps the most pathetic\ncase of all, experience in their own persons the precariousness\nof what science so far will not treat as more than a subjective\nphenomenon. The pressure of an unsympathising social atmo\nsphere drives them into a critical attitude towards their own\n' intuitions.' They feel them to be only subjective experiences ;\nthey begin to doubt whether they are not phantoms of their\nimagination, indications merely of the intensity of their longing.\nIn one most interesting case this process of self-criticism went\nto such lengths that a man who in the fervour of a Methodist\nconversion-crisis had actually perceived a vision of his Saviour,\nlapsed insensibly into agnosticism in a non-religious environ\nment, and was only brought back into touch with his religious\npast by a study of the miracles of ' Theosophy.'\nOn the whole, therefore, it would seem that reliance upon\nFaith alone is not free from serious drawbacks, and that it\nwould be impolitic to oppose Faith to Psychical Research. To\nme it seems rather that each needs the other, and that together\nthey might transfigure the face of life.\nI pass from the loftiest to the lowest form of opposition to\npsychical exploration, that of those who think that one world\nat a time is enough, and find their present business and amuse\nments too absorbing to bestow any attention, and still less any\nfavour, upon anything that might distract them from their\nchosen pursuits. Now it will probably be agreed that this\nobjection of practical common-sense to our researches is most\nformidable, and should if possible be mitigated, if it cannot\nwholly be removed. It rests moreover on a sound instinct.\nWe naturally try to circumscribe the universe with which\nman has to sustain relations, because happiness requires adapta\ntion to environment, and the more extensive the environment,\nthe more various and complex must our activities become,\nand the more difficult, ceteris paribus, the achievement of adapta\ntion. But your practical man's objection to taking too wide and\nvisionary a view of life is apt to degenerate into a sentimental\nrepugnance to anything which threatens to expand his immediate\nhorizon. The intensity of this feeling is what has hardly\n\f446 [part\nF. C. 8. Schiller.\nyet been realised. In its more flippant forms it issues in the\ndeclaration that Mrs. Piper's mediumship has added a new\nterror to death, in its more strenuous it rises to an utter\nloathing of psychical research and hatred of psychical researchers.\nAltogether it forms a mass of prejudice almost impervious to\nargument, so that all I can urge against it will probably\nbe vain. I must point out, however\u2014\n(1) That if another world can be scientifically discovered,\nthe two worlds will become one and continuous to a greater\nor less extent, and be included in the same natural universe.1\nThis will reduce the supposed antagonism between them to\nthat which always exists to some extent between the present\nand the future.\n(2) Looking ahead to the future is a characteristic which\nhas been more and more deeply impressed on the human mind\nby the teachings of experience ; and forethought and fore\nknowledge is in all other departments of knowledge eagerly\ndesired and conspicuously useful. In fact our mental power\nand progress seem to be largely measurable by this capacity to\nlook ahead.2 The discovery of a future life, therefore, would\nseem to contain the possibility of accomplishing the conscious\nguidance of our present life in a completer and more perfect\nway.\n(3) Human sentiment would soon grow adjusted to the new\nsituation, even in those who now hate to look ahead aud\nanticipate trouble. They would lie awake of nights, thinking\nof what they should do a thousand years hence, as little as\nnow. Forethought would be tempered with the reflection that\n\" sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,\" into a working com\npromise at least as conducive to efficiency as the present tacit\nconvention to think as little as may be of the fact that all\nhuman undertakings must be cut short, and perhaps be rendered\nfutile, by death. And so the certainty of a future life would\nimpair our activities as little as the certainty of death does\nnow. At present our attitude towards death is the most\nmarvellous triumph of psychological necessity over logic.\nEverybody admits it, but no one allows it to paralyse his\naction. Whatever revelations, therefore, psychical science may\n1Cp. Proceedings, S.P.R., Vol. XV. p. 50. Humanium, pp. 276-7.\naCp. Humanism, p. 257.\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 447\nhave in store for us, it is not credible that they would unnerve\nus or impair our capacity to carry on the business of life. At\nworst they might hold out the prospect of a distressing or\ndistasteful future. But we do not find that during the dark\nages, when men professed to believe that eternal torture was\nthe inevitable lot of the vast majority of their kind, the gaiety\nof nations was eclipsed or their ferocious energy diminished.\nAt best we might gain cognizance of a light that would illumine\nthe rough places of this world and guide our stumbling foot\nsteps. But a miraculous transformation seems as unlikely as\na moral cataclysm. Human nature after all is the main factor\nin our calculations. And plastic though it be, it changes very\nslowly. It would be quixotic, therefore, to suppose that\nPsychical Research will work a sudden revolution. Even if\nin the next decades sufficient evidence should accumulate to\nconvince the most obdurate of the truth of spirit communica\ntions, the ordinary business of life would go on much as before.\nPeople would eat, drink, sleep, work, marry, and amuse them\nselves as before. There would be no slump in Consols, nor\neven any perceptible decline in fashionable frivolity. For it\nis highly improbable that those who could not be broken of\nthe habit of living in and for the moment even by their\nunquestioning acceptance of the prospect of eternal damnation\nwill cease to play about on the surface of things, whatever\nevolutions may proceed down in the depths of thought.\nVII.\nBut, after all, I do not know why we should display such\nexclusive solicitude about the feelings of those who enjoy the\nexisting uncertainty. Some consideration surely is due also to\nthose who would sincerely like to know, and to whom the\nlack of knowledge causes grave distress. I have admitted, and\neven emphasised, that at any given time they form a minority,\nit may be a small minority. But there is also evidence to\nshow that at some time or other in their lives a large majority\npass through a period when the mystery of existence oppresses\ntheir spirit and torments them with fears and perplexities\nwhich real knowledge would almost certainly show to be\ngroundless. It is true, no doubt, that such periods of anxiety\n2g\n\f448 [part\nF. C. S. Schiller.\nseem usually to be short, and that after a few years people\nfind quite comfortable beliefs which at first had seemed un\nbearable. In the aggregate, however, the amount of spiritual\ndistress, in periods of bereavement and mental development,\ncaused by the present state of affairs must be enormous. It\nforms so needless a blot upon civilisation that it seems a\nthousand pities that attempts at the recording and scientific\nexploration of the fleeting clues that float into our view should\nnot be prosecuted with something like the ardour and per\nsistency which mankind has displayed in dealing with the\nother difficulties of human life.\nThe first and immediate step, however, must be to arouse\na will to know adequate to the success of this enterprise. We\nneed to arouse towards Psychical Research the feeling which\nFrancis Bacon aroused towards physical research. Whether\nor not Bacon was secretly the greatest of poets, there can be\nno doubt that he was not a greac man of science, nor himself\na discoverer of new truth. His services to science were\nimmense ; but they were those of a lawyer with a genius for\nepigram. He was also a Lord Chancellor. In virtue of these\nqualities, and in spite of these defects, he did for physical\nscience (in England at least) what no man of science could\nhave done. He drew general attention to its possibilities ;\nhe preached physical research with such eloquence and assiduity\nthat he actually changed the social atmosphere, and made men\ndesire the physical knowledge which they had until then\ndistrusted and despised.\nNow the last point I wish to insist on in this paper is\nthat in all probability it was chiefly the absence of such\ndesire for knowledge which formed the ultimate reason for\nthe stagnation of science during the Middle Ages. It was\nnot, certainly, the obscurantism of the Christian Church, as is\ncurrently alleged ; for Greek science had been languishing for\nsome centuries before the establishment of Christianity, which\nitself was one of the results of a general movement away from\nscience and towards a certain type of religion. For nearly 2000\nyears few or none seem to have desired scientific knowledge,\nand therefore scientific knowedge made no progress.\nThe only suggestion I can make in explanation of this\nstrange phenomenon is that scientific knowledge had ceased\n\fxlix.] Human Sentiment as to a Future Life. 449\nto seem desirable. The immense authority of Aristotle had\nbullied the world into the belief that pure science was\nutterly useless, and much too lofty to concern itself with\nthe good for man.1 Naturally enough the average man\nretaliated on the inhumanity of science by turning away\nto intellectual inquiries which seemed to promise more\nfor his interests. Intellectual interest was transferred first\nto the ethical, and subsequently to the religious, questions\ndebated among the Stoics, Epicureans, and Neoplatonist philo\nsophers, and the adherents of the Judaic, Mithraic, and\nChristian religions. Thus the social atmosphere became\nunfavourable to scientific research, and stifled whatever\ngerms thereof sprang up in individual minds. A great\ngenius did indeed arise, before this process had gone far, who\ndid not scorn to apply scientific knowledge to practical needs.\nBut, unfortunately, Archimedes was butchered in the sack of\nSyracuse by the Romans, and with him perished in all proba\nbility all prospects of a school to undo the mischief wrought\nby Aristotle's superstitious reverence for useless knowledge.\nElse modern science might have leapt into existence, and\nstarted on its beneficent career 2000 years ago.\nAs it was we had to wait for Bacon. Bacon succeeded\nin transforming the social atmosphere. He proclaimed that\nknowledge was power, and that physical science, systematically\nstudied, would give to each his heart's desire. And in spite\nof the disgust of pedants and obscurantists, and the futile\nquibbling of metaphysicians, men were glad to follow his\ninspiring lead ; they were encouraged to set to work and to\nobtain the sort of knowledge they desired. And we all know\nhow plentifully the slowly-ripening fruits of science have\nrewarded their labours. But, after all, the dark cloud of\nignorant contentment was lifted only in part. To this day it\nhas brooded over another portion of the field of knowledge.\nThe desire for knowledge does not yet extend to the subjects of\npsychical investigation. These are still regarded as uncanny,\n, dangerous, unknowable, useless, and what not. They still\nawait the redeeming advent of a Bacon to bid men open their\nears and their eyes, and put forth their strength to sow and\nreap a fresh and no less precious crop of knowledge.\n1Cp. my essay on \"Useless Knowledge\" in Humanism, p. 18.\n\f450 [part\nF. C. S.

Shall we find him in our Society ?\nI do not dare to prophesy, but when I look at the list of\nour Council I do not despair. For it seems to me that\namong our Presidents, past and present, we have men of the\nrequisite calibre. And the indifference of a Lord Chancellor\nmay be more than outweighed by the support of a Premier.\nAppendix.\nThe questionnaire used in the inquiry was as follows :\nINQUIRY INTO HUMAN SENTIMENT WITH REGARD\nTO A FUTURE LIFE.\nThere is a widespread literary tradition that men naturally desire\na future life. From this assumed fact it has been variously argued\nthat (1) such a universal desire cannot be destined to disappoint\nment, and (2) it must vitiate convictions and engender illusory\nevidence in its own support.\nBut there is some reason to suppose, both from the ordinary\nconduct of men and from sporadic declarations of individuals, that\nthis tradition is very far from accurately representing the facts,\nand that these are actually more various and complicated. More\nover, it should not be forgotten that in India the literary tradition\nseems to be exactly reversed, and it is assumed that men naturally\ncraye for extinction or absorption in the Absolute.\nIt becomes a question, therefore, what the actual sentiments of\nmen are, and what, consequently, is the actual bias with which\n1 Buccinator novi ttmporis. It is a curious, but most welcome, coincidence\nthat Sir Oliver Lodge, though not present when this paper was read to the\nSociety and unaware of its arguments, should have arrived at a very similar view\nof Bacon's epoch-making exhortations.

It is only when the facts have been\nascertained that they can be argued from for the various purposes\nof the scientist, the philosopher and the theologian.\nFirst of all, therefore, it is necessary to discover the nature of\nhuman sentiment ; and to obtain it in its purity, it is desirable\nto exclude, as far as possible, all extraneous influences, whether\nof a religious or of a scientific kind. It is, of course, recognised\nthat these may and often do influence sentiment, that they may\nengender or check it, as also that there may be a marked divergence\nbetween conviction or belief and sentiment.

The author cited M. de Mirville's\nFragment d'un Ouvrage ln6dit, a pamphlet which I have failed\nto procure. By the kindness of the Marquis d'Eguilles,\u2014a\ndescendant of the French envoy who accompanied Prince\nCharles from Edinburgh to Derby and Culloden,\u2014the Society\nhas received an authenticated copy of the original documents\nof what was practically a trial for witchcraft before the Juge\nde Paix of Yerville in 1851. To the present Juge de Paix\nwe owe the privilege of having the records viewed and tran\nscribed. It will be remarked that Mr. Dale Owen omitted\nthe negative evidence, and certain rulings of the court, un\nfavourable to the innocence of the alleged sorcerer, who appeared\nas plaintiff' in a case of libel against M. Tinel, Cure* of Cideville.\nPublic judicial proceedings began on January 7th, 1851, before\nM. Folloppe, Juge de Paix. Thorel, a shepherd swain, sum\nmoned M. Tinel for defamation of character. M. Tinel had\ndescribed various phenomena of the usual sort, invading his\nhouse, and persecuting two boys, his pupils.1 They included a\n1 \"Thus, according to [M.

Now shovels and\ntongs, having got tired of the hearth, would give themselves up to wild dauces,\nafterwards returning quietly to resume their accustomed places ; now tables\nand chairs would stamp and spin round, running all over his house as if they\nwere playing at prisoner's base or hide-and-seek, never ceasing from their\n\fXLIX.] 455\nThe Poltergeist at Cideville.\nblack hand which slapped one of the boys. He accused Thorel\nof producing these phenomena, declared that Thorel knelt and\nbegged his pardon, and he induced Pain, a sheep farmer, to\ndischarge Thorel. He also beat Thorel with a stick \" to the\neffusion of blood.\"\nTinel replied that he only charged Thorel with \" arrogating\nto himself the quality of sorcerer,\" and that he struck Thorel\nin self-defence.\nThe judge adjourned the case to January 28th, 1851, for\nevidence to be collected.\nThe first witness for the plaintiff, Be\"zuel, spoke to much\nhearsay matter. He had visited M. Tinel's house, in his\nabsence, M. Tinel inviting him to stay for a fortnight. He\ndid not, but visiting the place with M. Robert de Saint Victor\n(brother of Paul de Saint Victor ?), he witnessed nothing\nunusual.\nAndrieu, the next witness, had heard of the affair from\nTinel, and other hearsay matter. He had, however, heard\nraps produced at the order of the younger pupil, whom he\nplaced \" in a position in which he could not produce any\nnoise by himself.\" He heard a M. Fontaine call from the\nwindow (he himself being in the garden) that he had caught\nthe boy cheating. The boy bellowed that he had not cheated,\nand offered to stand on the window sill, where he could\nnot touch a table which, according to Fontaine, he had moved\nin a normal way.\nMasson, a gendarme, was told that objects flew about and\nbroke the windows.

He was haunted\nby a spectre in a blouse. A child's voice was heard by him.\nHe did not ask to be allowed to go home. Meeting Thorel,\nwhen with Tinel, he recognised in Thorel the spectre in\nthe blouse. The boy spoke about the incident of Fontaine's\naccusation of cheating.\nBunel, aged fourteen, the other pupil, corroborated Lemonnier,\nwho \" lost consciousness \" and \" had a nervous attack \" after\nmeeting Thorel. The witness showed a black eye, caused by\na stamping iron which flew at his face. He attested many\neccentric movements of objects.\nThorel then asked that nine questions, partly as to Fontaine,\nmight be put to witness.\nThe Judge disallowed them as \" contrary to the dignity of\njustice,\" and adjourned the court.\nThe next witness, M. de Bagneux, spoke to M. Tinel's anxiety\nto have the affair investigated. He himself, alone with the\nboy, heard \" the noise \" beat several tunes : he could not\n\" discover the cause.\"\nAuguste Huet, the next witness, by his request had raps\nstruck under his fingers on a table. He was \" convinced\nthat it was not the boy who did it, nor any of the people\nof the house.\" The boy's arms were folded at the time. A\ntune was rapped out by his request.\nMaxime Henry, as to the phenomena, spoke only from\nhearsay.\nCheval spoke to the scene in which Thorel knelt to Tinel,\nand was beaten by him. He mentioned, on hearsay, that\nThorel had boasted of his sorceries, and, by way of an evidence,\nhad caused a person to fall down whenever he struck a blow\nagainst his hut. He then said that he had not seen but\nheard of the kneeling and beating incident. But he did see\nthe tongs and shovel at the house of M. Tinel \" leave the\nhearth and go into the middle of the room.\" They were put\nback, and rushed out again. \" My eyes were fixed on them\nto see what moved them, but I saw nothing at all.\" (This\nwitness was a farmer, aged forty.)

I saw a\nhammer, moved by some invisible force, leave the spot where it lay\nand fall in the middle of the room without making more noise than\nif a hand had gently laid it down ; a piece of bread lying on the\ntable darted under the table ; and we being placed as we were, it\nwas impossible that any of us could have thrown it in that way.\nI also saw, after the Cure of Cideville and I had shaved, all the\nthings we had used for the purpose placed as if by hand on the\nfloor; the young pensionnaire of M. Tinel having called our attention\nto this, M. Tinel and I went upstairs to assure ourselves of the fact.\nPerhaps the child had had time to do this; but on coming away\nagain, we had scarcely descended six steps of the stairs when the\nchild told us that everything had been put back in its place. I\nwent back alone, and found everything was, in fact, in its place,\nwith the exception of the mirror, and I am certain that the child\ncould not have put everything back in its place in that way in so\nshort a time. It seems to me inexplicable. Since that I have heard\nnoises at the Presbytery at Cideville. I took every precaution in\nlistening to them, even placing myself under the table to make sure\nthat the children could do nothing, and yet I heard noises, which\nseemed to me, however, to come more especially from the wainscot.\nI said in connection with this that the noises seemed to me so\nextraordinary that I would vouch for them with my blood. I noticed\nthat M. Tinel seemed to be somewhat exasperated at these noises\nand at their persistence, especially on several nights during which\nI slept with him, when he woke up frightened about it all.\nThe Judge disallowed a question to this witness, with the\nusual formula. Much frivolous hearsay evidence followed, and\nneed not be repeated. Somebody had heard somebody say\nthat M. Tinel said that the two boys made the noises.\nFor the defence M. de Mirville, aged forty-eight, was called,\nand said :\nLast Wednesday I went to the Presbytery of Cideville and said\nto the ' cause,' \" When you wish to reply affirmatively rap once ;\n\f4.58 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nwhen you wish to reply negatively rap twice.\" Immediately a\nrap was heard. \"Then you will be able to tell me how many\nletters there are in my name ] \" Eight raps were heard, the last\nmore distinct than the others, apparently to make one understand\nthat it was the last. \" My baptismal name now 1 \" Reply, five\nraps. \"And now my fore-name which figures on the register of\nthe Civil List, and which no one has hitherto called me by.\"\nImmediately, seven raps; \"and the names of my children, first the\neldest ? \" Five raps,\u2014quite correct, she is called Aline. \" That\nof the youngest?\" Nine raps, a mistake, immediately rectified, for\nseven raps were struck. She is called Blanche. \"Now let us pass\nto my age ; strike as many raps as I have years.\" Instantly the\nraps succeeded each other with such rapidity that I was obliged\nto stop them in order to count them, and I demanded more\nslowness; forty-eight raps were then heard very distinctly, the forty-\neighth being more accentuated than the others. \"That is not all.\nHow many months do you reckon between the first of January\nof this year, and the moment I shall be forty-nine 1 \" Three very\nloud raps and one faint one followed. \" What does the faint one\nmean 1 probably half a month ? \" One rap. \" Good ! but it is not\nfinished. How many days now between that half month and my\nbirthday ? \" Nine raps, the last being more accentuated. Perfectly\ncorrect, I shall be forty-nine on the 24th of April of this year. . . .\n\" Let us pass on to the place of my abode. How many letters\nare there in its name 1 \" Eight raps ; \" and in the name of my\nCommune 1 Be careful not to make the usual mistake.\" Ten raps\nwere heard. Now I live in the Commune of Gomerville, the name\nof which is often written with two m's, a mistake not made by\nthe ' cause.' It was demonstrated to me by this, that I had to\ndo with an old acquaintance\u2014I hope not a friend. \"Let us pass\nto music ; you are said to be a musician, the other day you sang\nthe first part of Rossini's Stabat, they say; since you know the\nfirst part you ought to know the second part, the bass part Pro\npeccatis suae gentis; let me hear it.\" Instantly the mysterious\nagent rapped the rhythm of the first two bars correctly enough,\nbut in the third committed an irregularity which slightly spoiled the\nrhythm. On my remarking this, it began again, corrected the mis\ntake, and the passage was recognisable. Two or three popular\nairs, such as, J'ai du bon Tabac, Mattre Corbeau, etc. . . . were\narticulated rapidly and without any mistake. The other pieces\nfrom the Italian repertoire which I demanded, were perfectly un\n\fXLIX.] 459\nThe Poltergeist at Cideville.\nknown to it. \"Come,\" I said to it, \"you are a poor dilettante.\nNow follow me if you can.\" I then hummed a waltz from Guillaume\nTell. It listened at first without doing anything ; then followed\nme exactly while I sang it ; and several times during the morning,\nwhen we were no longer thinking of it, it came back to the same piece\nand tried to execute it alone. The pupils, while this was going on,\nhad not discontinued their work; I don't think the Cure came into\nthe room during the whole time, but I must admit I did not attach\nmuch importance to this point I have said that I was not a wit\nness to material facts, but I must add that one of the children said\nto me, \"Look, Sir, look at this desk knocking against the other\";\nbut as the child was in front of the desk I did not attach much\nimportance to this fact,\u2014not that I believed him to be the cause of\nit. My not mentioning this at first was because I wished to\nobserve the most scrupulous exactitude. [To the interpellation of\nthe defendant with a view to knowing whether the witness believed\nthe Cure of Cideville might be the author of these facts, he replied] :\nI should be much surprised if any one within these walls could\nseriously believe that. I do not believe it possible to produce these\nphenomena by natural means, and the cause must be supernatural.\nBy supernatural causes I mean an intelligent force surpassing that\nof man and of nature. [The witness being interpellated by the\nplaintiff with a view to knowing if he thought these phenomena\ncould be produced by a poor shepherd unable to read or write,\nreplied], I do not think he could produce them by himself, but\nhe might with the assistance of an occult and supernatural cause.\nI am the author of one work only, entitled, Les peuples et Us\nSavants en matiire de religion. [The witness was interpellated as\nto whether he had received a visit from the Cur\u00e9 of Cideville on\nthe 8th day of January last, when the hvtter was seen in company\nwith another priest at the landing stage of Nointot, 1*2 kilometres\n(7i miles) from Gomerville. He replied], I never saw the Curd of\nCideville before Wednesday last, and I was completely ignorant of\nthe existence of a Commune of the name of Cideville.\nMadame de Saint Victor, aged fifty-six, said :\nBeing at the Presbytery I heard some 'cause' which was unknown\nto me make raps intelligently. The Angelus was ringing and I said\nto the 'cause,' \"Rap the tune of the Angelus,\" and the tune was\nrapped. I also heard the tune of Maltre Corbeau rapped out and\nthat of Drinn Drinn, quite perfectly. I think it was on the 8th\n\f4C0 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nDecember before mass at Cideville that I saw the child, who said\nhe had received a slap from an invisible hand. The same day after\nVespers, when I was at the Presbytery of Cideville standing quite\napart from the other people there, I felt an invisible force seize\nme by the mantle and give me a vigorous shake. The same day\nalso I saw three persons sitting on a small table in the Presbytery\nand it moved along the floor in spite of the efforts of two people\nto hold it back. Several people were there, amongst others my\nfemme de chambre, but I cannot precisely say who the others were.\nAnother day I saw the child sitting on a chair with his feet off\nthe ground and his back not leaning on the chairback, yet the\nchair rocked with a movement which the child could not have\ngiven it, ending with the chair falling in one direction and the\nboy in another. The child was much frightened at this. A week\nago when I was alone with the children I saw the two desks at\nwhich they were working fall over and the table on the top of\nthem. The same day I took the children some St. Benoist medals\nin which I had faith, and every time the medals were placed on\nthe desks not the least sound was produced there, the noise then\nbeing heard behind me in the wall cupboard ; but as soon as\nthe medals were withdrawn from the desks the noise was heard\nagain in the desks. The same day the noise rapped out the tune\nof Mattre Corbeau, and on my remarking, \"Do you know nothing\nbut that, then?\" it sang the air of Au clair de la lune, and that\nof J'ai du bon Tabac. Yesterday, again, I saw a candlestick leave\nthe chimneypiece in the kitchen and go and hit the back of my\nfemme de chambre, and a key lying on the table struck the child's\near. I must say that I cannot tell precisely where the key was,\nas I did not see it start on its flight, but only saw it arrive. I\nwas not frightened, only surprised. My son was with me when\nI heard the Angelus as well as the two children and the Cur6, but\nduring the other airs I was alone with the children. It was not\npossible for the children to do these things ; I watched their feet\nand their hands, and could see all their movements. I think the\nshepherd Thorel could not have done them unless he had made\na compact with the devil ; for it seemed to me there was some\nthing diabolical in it all.\nM. Robert de St. Victor, aged twenty-three, said :\nI was a witness at the Presbytery of Cideville of things I cannot\nexplain to myself. I heard a 'cause' unknown to me make raps,\n\fXLIX.] 461\nThe Poltergeist at Cideville.\nparticularly rapping the tune Maitre Corleau, and the rhythm of\nthe Angelus. I asked this ' cause ' to rap Rossini's Stabat Matey- ;\nthe tune was exactly rendered. A week ago I went again to the\nPresbytery, and was alone with the children and the old servant\nmaid ; I placed one of the children in each of the windows of the\nroom upstairs, I being outside, but in a position to observe all their\nmovements in the position they were placed in ; besides, they could\nnot have moved much without risk of falling, and I then heard raps\nstruck in the room, similar to those of a mallet. I went up to the\nroom and I saw one of the children's desks coming towards me, with\nno visible force to push it ; however, I did not see it at the moment\nof its starting. I am convinced that the children had nothing to do\nwith this, since they were still standing in the windows. Being one\nday at the Presbytery with the Mayor, I heard several loud blows\nsuch as the children could not have produced. I put my hand and\near against the wainscot, and very distinctly felt the vibrations and\nthe place where the blows were struck. I was present several times\nat the scenes at the Presbytery. It seems to me impossible that the\nCure could have produced them. Often he was not in the Presbytery,\nand when he was there he was seated beside me. [The witness being\ninterpellated as to whether he thought it possible that the shepherd\nwas the author of these phenomena, replied], No, I do not even\nknow this shepherd.\nThe fourth witness, Bouffay, said :\nBeing at the Presbytery of Cideville, 1 saw M. Tinel put his hand\nlightly on Thorel's shoulder, saying, \" You have spoken very impru\ndently ; I should not be surprised if you know something about\nwhat is happening at the Presbytery,\" and the child then said, \" I\nknow this man to be the one who has been following me about for\na fortnight.\" M. Tinel told Thorel to go on his knees and ask the\nchild's pardon. Thorel fell on his knees and begged pardon, saying,\n\"I don't know what for.\" While on his knees, Thorel put out his\nhand as if with the intention of taking hold of the child's blouse in\ndiabolical mischief. I know nothing of the facts referred for proof,\nthat is, nothing personally, only from hearsay. I went several times\nto the Presbytery at Cideville ; the first time the noise was continual\nin those rooms only where the children were, both in the church\nand at the Presbytery. The ' noise ' was intelligent and obedient\nonly on this first visit. The noise was sometimes so loud that once\nwhen I was lying in the same room with the children I thought\n\f462 [part\nAndrew Lang.\nthe ceiling would come down. When day came the idea occurred\nto us of knocking nails in the spot where there was rapping ; and\na very plaintive voice was heard, the sounds of which were unintelli\ngible. I also saw, both upstairs and downstairs, the perfectly isolated\ntable move without any force that I could see to cause the movement.\nOn the second visit I scarcely saw anything. On the third visit I\nsaw pretty much the same things as on the first. I noticed that\nthe children were perfectly motionless when the sound was produced,\nso could not have made it themselves. I heard it when the Cure\nwas absent from the Presbytery as well as in his presence. It was\nimpossible that either he or the children should have had anything\nto do with the noise, because' it was too loud. I forgot to say that\nwhen the child heard a voice begging his pardon, we all fell on our\nknees and prayed God to forgive those who were persecuting us.\n[Being interpellated by the plaintiff as to whether the witness\nthought the shepherd could have produced these phenomena, he\nreplied that he did not know the shepherd's capabilities. Being\ninterpellated by the defendant, the witness said that when he returned\nwith M. Tinel and the children from the house of one of the in\nhabitants of the Commune, where they had slept on account of the\nnoises at the Presbytery, just as the children were going up to\ntheir room to ascertain if all was at an end, he saw a phantom\nlike vapour go with great rapidity through the kitchen door towards\nthe room where the children were. When the shepherd Thorel\ncame to the Presbytery and threw himself on his knees to M. Tinel\nhe said he had come to fetch an organ.]\nThe sixth witness, Breard, said :\nDuring December last I passed two nights at the Presbytery of\nCideville. On the first I heard an irritating noise during part of\nthe night which prevented my sleeping. The next morning at break\nfast, being at table in company with M. Tinel and the Abb6 Bouffay,\nI heard an alarming knock struck on the floor beneath the table.\nI am certain that it was neither the children nor M. Tinel who\ndid this, any more than the shepherd, whom I do not know. When\nI had returned to Rouen, I received a letter from M. Tinel asking\nme to get M. Pressier, professor of physics, to come and look into\nthe phenomena which were being produced at the Presbytery of\nCideville. I saw M. Pressier, but he could not come.\nI cite this witness to show that M. Tinel appealed to\nscience, and that he appealed in vain !\n\fXLIX.J 403\nThe Poltergeist at Cideville.\nEvidence to threats by Thorel against Tinel, in the menacing\nstyle of the Drummer of Tedworth, was given by a hearer\nof the same, Varin, aged thirty-seven, grocer ; by Le Tellier,\ntwenty-seven, farrier ; Grenet, aged fourteen ; Foulogne, aged\nforty-eight ; du Forestel, a weaver, aged thirty-seven, and others.\nJudgment was pronounced on February 15th, 1851, after\nhearing counsel. The learned judge said, \" The most clear result\nof all the evidence is that the cause [i.e. of the extraordinary\nevents at the Presbytery of Cideville] remains unknown.\"\nAs the plaintiff had himself spread the report that he\ncaused the occurrences, and 'had shown contrition on two\noccasions, the defendant had done him no technical wrong.\nIn thumping the plaintiff, who tried to handle him, the\ndefendant acted in legitimate self-defence. Thorel was non\nsuited, and had to pay about \u00a36 in costs.\nDale Owen quotes de Mirville to the effect that the boys\nwere removed to another Presbytere, behaved well, and were\nnot attended by the Poltergeist, \"as far as appears.\"\nThe experienced reader will see that, in the seventeenth\ncentury, Thorel would have been burned, on the \" spectral\nevidence\" of the appearances to the younger boy. The\nsceptic will be sure that the boys caused all the trouble\nbecause they were tired of staying with M. Tinel. The claim\nof Fontaine to have caught the younger boy in the act of\ncheating will be accepted, and all the affirmative evidence will\nbe dismissed in the usual way. The present writer cannot\nform a conjecture as to how the things were done, or made\nto appear to be done, but they are the ancient traditional\nthings, quae semper, quae ubique, quae ab omnibus. They are\nattested on oath by persons of various ranks, ages, and educa\ntion, and the evidence is not remote from the time of the\nevents. My one wish is that somebody would find a boy or\ngirl who will, at least, attempt to produce the phenomena in\nthe presence of a committee of the Society. If the things\n\u25a0can be done so easily, will no young person do them ?\n2H\n\f464 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nSUPPLEMENT.\nI.\nTHE HISTORY OF A HAUNTED HOUSE.\nReported by\nDk. J.

These are the three prin\ncipal theories, however, to which accounts of haunted houses and\nvarious alleged supernatural manifestations are immediately-\nreferred, the sceptics maintaining that all are due to fraud\nand trickery, the mystics invoking the agency of the dead, of\n1 This translation is made by the kind permission of Dr. Grasset.

The facts of\nthis case are taken from the very careful and detailed notes of my\ncolleague, Dr. Calmette, and must be given at some length to\nmake the account sufficiently precise and complete.\nThe scene of the disturbances is an unimportant town, which for\nconvenience we may call Daimonopolis, in the Grand Duchy of\nGerolstein. In a suburb of this town lives the family A ,\nconsisting of the father and mother, with their six children, and\nthe paternal grandfather.\nThe grandfather, a day labourer by occupation, is an honest man,\nalbeit a trifle superstitious. His son, the father of the family, is\nan agricultural labourer, aged thirty-one, a man of mild and rather\nnervous disposition and the second husband of his wife, who is\nan intelligent woman of forty, southern, vivacious, and very\ngarrulous.\nOf the six children, two, Jean and Jeanne, are by the first mar\nriage; the former, aged twenty, is a day labourer, a quiet young\nman, going out very little except during working hours, and of a\nslightly childish disposition ; the latter, Jeanne, is the patient who\nis being treated for hysteria in the Achard-Esperonnier ward up to\nthe present time. She is fifteen years of age, frank-looking and\nintelligent, but with atrocious morals. We shall return to her\nlater on. The remaining four children are by the second marriage\nand are aged respectively eight, six, four, and two years old.\nThe A.'s inhabit two small houses, separated from one another\nby a garden. House No. 1 looks out on one side into the road\nand on the other into the garden, and consists of a ground floor\nonly, comprising a suite of four rooms\u2014the kitchen (A), a large\nroom (B) where Jean sleeps, a small room (C) occupied by the\ngrandfather, and a store-room (D), where a goat and some fowls\nare kept. The three rooms A, B, and C communicate with each\nother, but only one, the kitchen (A), has a door opening upon the\nterrace, facing the garden, so that it is impossible to reach either\nof the other two rooms without first passing through the kitchen.\n\f466 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nRoom B is lighted by a window overlooking the terrace, and the\ngrandfather's room (C) by a tiny dormer window. There is no\ncommunication between any of the rooms and the road. The\ngarden surrounding the house is enclosed by a wall which has two\nopenings, one into the road and the other into the waste land on\nwhich stands House No. 2.\nThis second house, like the first, has no upper storey, and con\ntains four rooms, arranged as follows : A kitchen (E), facing House\nNo. 1 ; behind this two rooms divided by a partition, the dining-\nroom (F) and a bedroom (G), in which sleep M. and Mme. A ,\nwith the three youngest children ; and behind these again a fourth\nroom (H), shared by Jeanne and her eight-years-old sister. The\nkitchen (E) has a large glass door, whence can be seen through the\nopening in the boundary wall House No. 1 and its terrace opposite.\nThis room communicates both with rooms F and G-, and both the\nlatter open into room H.\nThe A.'s rent No. 2, but the owner of No. 1, pending the sale\nor letting of this house, allows them to occupy it free of rent.\nSome time ago its probable sale was talked of, which would have\nentailed the departure of the A.'s, who thus saw before them the\nprospect of having to leave. Shortly afterwards the phenomena\nabout to be described broke out.\nThe grandfather and the eldest son, Jean, go to their work\nregularly every morning, taking their mid-day meal with them, and\nonly returning in the evening for supper.\nOn December 4th, 1901, Jeanne went into her grandfather's room\nafter he and her brother had gone out, to fetch some linen, when,\naccording to her own account, she noticed nothing unusual. When\nMme. A went in to make the bed in the afternoon, however,\nshe was astonished to find the bed upset, with the mattress rolled\nup at the foot and the bed-clothes in disorder on the floor. She\nasked Jeanne if it was she who had done this, but Jeanne denied\nhaving touched the things. Her mother thereupon took her into\nthe room and showed her what had happened. Jeanne said that it\nhad not been in that state in the morning, and that it could not\nbe her grandfather's doing, as the bed had not been touched when\nshe went in earlier in the day. Notwithstanding this, when her\nfather-in-law came home that evening, Mme. A accused him of\nhaving upset his bed by way of a joke. In great astonishment he\ndeclared that he had not touched the bed after getting up, and\nthought the phenomena must be of supernatural origin, probably\n\fXLIX.] 467\nHistory of a Haunted House.\ncaused by the spirits of his son and daughter returning to torment\nhim. (One of his sons had died in 1895, and his daughter in 1887.)\nWhen Jean came home in his turn he was told of what had occurred,\nand his grandfather repeated his theory of supernatural intervention,\nand was anxious to have a Mass said for the souls of his children ;\nbut Jean merely laughed at this explanation, saying that, if none of\nthe household had touched the bed, it must be a practical joke on\nthe part of some one, as it could not have upset itself.\nOn the morning of December 5th, after the men had gone to\nwork, Mme. A called Jeanne, who was not yet up, to come\nand see if the grandfather's bed had again been disturbed. They\ncrossed the garden together to the other house (No. 1), and going\ninto the grandfather's room found the bed-clothes in confusion in\nthe middle of the room. Jeanne said that her grandfather must\nhave done it for his own amusement; and Mme. A , being of\nof the same opinion, in order to give him a lesson, did not remake\nthe bed, but left things as they were.\nIn the evening she reproached her father-in-law with some warmth,\nsaying that he should not have done it, as he might have frightened\nthe children. He, however, denied having done anything, and Jean\ntook up his defence, asserting that they had gone out together that\nmorning, and that when they left the bed had not been disturbed.\nUpon this the grandfather reverted to his original hypothesis, and\nreproached his daughter-in-law for not having had Masses said to\npacify the spirits, but Jean and his father laughed this idea to\nscorn.\nOn the morning of the 6th, however, as Mme. A continued\nto accuse him, the grandfather sent Jean to fetch her, so that she\nmight satisfy herself, before he went out to his work, as to the\nstate of his room. When Mme. A came over with Jeanne from\nthe other house (No. 2), everything was in order in the room (C),\nand the grandfather himself was in the kitchen preparing the soup for\nbreakfast, but keeping an eye on his room through the open doors\nof Jean's room (B). The latter was also working in the kitchen,\nwhile Jeanne and her mother were washing clothes in the garden.\nAll at once, the grandfather on turning round saw the bed-clothes\nand eiderdown quilt of his bed lying in the middle of his room. He\ndrew Jean's attention to the fact, and Mme. A was called, when\non going into the room (C) they found the bed upset, and the quilt,\netc., thrown into the middle of the room, as on the previous day.\nNot knowing how to explain this phenomenon, Mme. A accused\n\f468 [part\nDr. J. Orasset.\nthem both of amusing themselves at her expense; but Jean de\nclared that his grandfather had not left the kitchen, where he was\nmaking the soup, and that he himself had been at work in the\nsame room.\nThe things were then put in order again, and they went away to\ntheir work. The father of the family was also working out of the\nhouse, but started earlier, coming home as they did in the evening,\nand Jeanne went daily to take him his dinner. On this particular\nday she started with it as usual at a quarter to twelve. At noon\nMme. A dined with the other children in Jean's room,\nand when she went into the grandfather's room afterwards every\nthing was in its place. She then left the children to play in\nthe kitchen (A), and went to visit a neighbour.\nIn the course of their play, the two children of six and eight\nyears old went into the room B, where they were much astonished\nto find the bed-clothes and a mattress on the floor, and ran to fetch\ntheir mother. At this moment Jeanne returned ; Mme. A met\nher at the garden-gate, and they entered the house together. Every\nthing was in confusion in room C, and the bedding (mattress, eider\ndown quilt, etc.) had been carried thence into room B.\nJeanne said that her grandfather must be right after all, and that\nthey had better have a Mass said.;\nHaving put things once more in order, Mme. A left Jeanne\nwith the children in the kitchen (A), and went out again, but a few\nminutes later they came to fetch her in a state of great alarm, as\nthe bed-clothes had been taken a second time into Jean's room (B),\nwhere they now lay in complete confusion.\nMme. A put everything back in its place, and established\nherself with her work in the kitchen (A) to watch the adjoining\nroom.\nNothing unusual then occurred. In the evening, when the\nfamily were all together, it was decided henceforward to cook and\neat their meals in the other house (No. 2).\nTowards six o'clock, having ascertained that all was in order,\nMme. A was herself the last to leave No. 1, when she shut the\ndoor of the kitchen, but did not lock it, since the lock had been\nout of order for a long time past.\nThe entire family were now established in house No. 2, with the\nexception of M. A , who never came home until seven o'clock.\nA little parsley being needed in the preparation of the supper,\nMme. A asked her father-in-law to fetch her some from the\n\fXLIX.] 469\nHistory of a Haunted Howe.\ngarden-plot near the terrace of the other house. It was dark, how\never, and as he was afraid to go out alone so close to No. 1, she\nfinally went with him herself, and having cut the parsley, expressed\na desire to go in and see whether the bed had been disturbed. The\ngrandfather said that they could not expect it to have been touched\nalready, but Mme. A replied that, as it had been done three\ntimes before that day, it might very well have been done a fourth\ntime. They went in accordingly, and were astounded to find all\nthe bed-clothes of Room C in Room B.\nMuch alarmed, the grandfather refused to sleep any longer in\nthis room, and asked to have a bed made up for him in the other\nhouse, but to this Mme. A demurred, saying that if he really\nwere haunted by spirits he would bring them with him. Jean\nbrought the discussion to a satisfactory conclusion by proposing to\nshare his own bed with his grandfather, with the remark that it\nwould be a means of finding out whether it was against the latter\npersonally that the spirits bore a grudge, as in that case his bed\nwould now be disturbed. During the night of the 6th to the 7th\nnothing unusual occurred in the grandfather's room, and on the\nmorning of December 7th, having left everything in order in the\nhouse, they came to breakfast in the kitchen of No. 2.\nMme. A went in the meantime into No. 1, and found every\nthing in confusion in Room C. She returned to tell her father-in-law\nand Jean, and they went back together to No. 1, where they found\nto their amazement that not only the grandfather's room, but also\nJean's bed had been disturbed, and the bed-clothes moved into the\nmiddle of the room, much to Mme. A 's astonishment, as she said\nthat a moment before only the grandfather's bed had been touched.\nThey put everything in order again, and dispersed to their several\noccupations, but when Mme. A went into the house at eleven\no'clock in the morning, she found the sheets, blankets, quilts, and\nmattresses from the beds in both rooms (B and C) piled up in the\nkitchen (A). She then gave up setting things in order, and returned\nto the other house, where Jeanne was, and ten minutes later the\nlatter, looking in the direction of house No. 1, saw the bedding of\nthe two beds out on the terrace. She went hurriedly to tell her\nmother, and came back with her; but on reaching the door of the\nkitchen (E), which was within sight of the terrace, she uttered piercing\ncries for help, and when Mme. A ran to her in great alarm to\nknow what the matter was, declared that she had seen a skeleton\nstretched out on the mattress on the terrace.\n\f470 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nMme. A was as much terrified as her daughter, and not\ndaring to remain any longer even in house No. 2, she left every\nthing and went with the children to a neighbour's house, while\nJeanne went to take her father his dinner.\nThe facts now soon got abroad ; the story spread through the\nneighbourhood of the town, and caused a great deal of gossip, each\nperson interpreting the phenomena in his own way. Amongst them,\nhowever, they somewhat reassured Mme. A , and she was accom\npanied home, and helped to put things in order. Nothing further\noccurred that day, but in the evening M. A decided to keep a\nvigilant watch on the Sunday following, with several of his friends,\nso that should the affair be a practical joke, they might be sure\nof catching its perpetrators. That night, the grandfather again\nslept with Jean.\nOn Sunday (December 8th), at seven o'clock in the morning, M.\nA and two of his friends established their watch in the kitchen\nof No. 1 . At eight o'clock, not having seen anything suspicious,\nthey went to breakfast in No. 2, without taking the precaution of\nlocking the doors behind them, and when they returned at about 8.30\nthe beds had been upset. They were re-made, and at noon M. A\nand his friends locked the door between the grandfather's and Jean's\nrooms, but were unable to lock the kitchen door, as the lock was\nout of order. They then went to lunch. On their return they found\nthe inner door between rooms B and C broken open, the lock torn\noff\", and everything in confusion in the two rooms.\nOn Monday, the 9th, and Tuesday, the 10th, the same phenomena\noccurred, and a priest who was called in to \"exorcise the spell\"\nhad no opinion to give as to the cause of the objects being\ntransported.\nOn Wednesday, the 11th,1 a neighbour, M. B , a Parisian,\nand worker in ivory, advised them to set a trap in the two rooms\nin which the phenomena occurred, with a view to ascertaining whether\nthey were or were not of supernatural origin. At his suggestion they\nfastened the bed-clothes by means of threads to the bedsteads, affixed\nseals in various places, and strewed the floor with sawdust. Both\nthe rooms (B and C) were prepared in this manner, and it was thought\nthat any one entering them would necessarily leave footmarks in\nthe sawdust, and would be obliged to break the seals, or cut the\nthreads in order to disturb the beds.\n1[In the original, Wednesday is called the 12th, and the following days are\nsimilarly incorrectly dated.\u2014Translator.]\n\fXLIX.] 471\nHistory of a Haunted House.\nThe inhabitants of Daimonopolis grew more and more excited,\nand came from all directions to see the \"haunted house,\" while\nMme. A informed every one that they had set traps to catch\nthe culprits, for she now gave out that the whole thing was the\nwork of practical jokers.\nWhen the evening came, the entire family slept in house No. 2.\nEverything remained undisturbed in No. 1.\nOn Thursday, the 12th, and Friday, the 13th, nothing unusual\noccurred, and on the Friday Mme. A cut the threads and\nswept up the sawdust, and Jean and his grandfather slept each in\nhis own bed.\nOn Saturday, the 14th, nothing particular happened, but on Sun\nday, the 15th, Mme. A found that the two rooms were again\nupset. She remade the beds and put down fresh sawdust, and the\nrest of the day passed without incident.\nOn Monday, the 16th, after making the beds, she was careful to\nscatter sawdust on the floor, but during the morning, in spite of\nthese precautions, everything was again upset. No footprints were\nto be seen, as the bed-clothes and mattresses had been dragged into\nthe kitchen, taking up in their passage the sawdust strewn on the\nfloor. On the same day a lock was put on the outer door of the\nkitchen.\nOn Tuesday, the 17th, they shut the watch-dog into the house,\nleaving the inner doors open, so that he might go about into all\nthree rooms ; the outer kitchen door was locked, and the key re\nmoved. The dog was an extremely savage one, and was usually kept\nchained up, as he barked at the slightest sound, and did not always\nrecognise even his own masters. About an hour after he had been\nshut up, Mme. A saw the dog reappear, and called out in as\ntonishment to her father-in-law that some one must have let him\nout. The grandfather hurried to the door, and found it locked.\nWhen he opened it and went in, he saw that everything in the two\nrooms had again been upset, while the dog had not barked at all,\nor they would have heard him.\nOn the same day they put sawdust down again in the rooms, and\nleft the dog tied up in the garden ; later on he was found at liberty,\nand the rooms had again been thrown into confusion.\nIn the course of the next few days a part of the arbour was\ndestroyed, shutters were torn off, and a washtub and various articles\nof furniture were heaped up on the terrace, but no one ever wit\nnessed the phenomena at the moment of their actual occurrence.\n\f472 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nOn Saturday, December 21st, toward half-past six in the morn\ning, after M. A had gone to work, Mme. A , while still in\nbed, heard a knocking, and called out to Jeanne, who slept with\nher sister in the next room, to ask if she heard it.\nJeanne said she did, and they heard the raps again several times,\nbut could not make out whether they were on the door or on\nthe window. The sounds alarmed them, and when they grew louder\nMme. A rose to go in to her daughter. She had hardly entered\nthe room when Jeanne began to cry, saying that her hair had just\nbeen cut off ; in fact, she showed her mother the plait that had\nbeen cut off, but could not explain how it had been done, as she\nhad felt nothing, and seen no one, nor had her little sister, aged\neight, who was sleeping in the same room, seen any one cutting off\nher hair.\nThe plait was taken to a priest, to whom they told the story,\ninquiring if this were not a manifestation of some supernatural\nforce. He, however, thought the proof of demoniacal agency in\nsufficient, while it appears that Jean said laughingly on the follow\ning day that it was his mother who had cut off Jeanne's hair.\nOn the Saturday night all the family slept under the same roof,\nand on the Sunday morning (the 22nd) a series of raps were heard\nin different parts of the house, which ceased, however, as soon\nas they got up, and no one was to be seen outside.\nThe raps came again on Monday morning (the 23rd), and when\nM. and Mme. A set out to market, the little girl ran after\nthem with her father's purse which she had just found in the vine.\nHe was greatly astonished, as he had put the purse in his trousers-\npocket the evening before, and had not been out since. He could\nnot understand how it came to be in the vine ; moreover, the sum\nof 4 fr. 50 c. which it had contained was missing.\nOn every one of the following days Jean's room and his grand\nfather's were upset ; plants were torn up in the garden, and Jeanne\nand her small brother, aged six, saw a cupboard open and the linen\ncome out of its own accord. Mme. A also was very cleverly\nrobbed of her purse. She had gone to bed with it under her pillow,\nand just as she was getting up ascertained that it was still there.\nShe got out of bed, looked for it under the pillow and found it\ngone. Jeanne had been in the room a moment before. Mme.\nA was very much annoyed, as the purse had contained 17 fr.\nWhen she went out, the purse was lying in front of the door, but\nwith no money in it.\n\fXLIX.] 473\nHistory of a Haunted House.\nAbout this time, M. C , a hairdresser, wrote to the principal\neditor of a paper in Gerolstein, called the \"Messager de I'occvite,\" to\nask for an explanation of these phenomena. His letter was dated\nfrom Daimonopolis, Jan. 3rd, 1902, and contained an account of what\nhad taken place at the A 's house, adding that a trap had been\nset by laying down sawdust, affixing seals, etc., and that while the\nrooms were in this state the abnormal occurrences had ceased, but\nhad commenced directly the seals, etc., were removed. He stated\nthat the three children, aged respectively 15, 5, and 4 years old,\nsaid they had seen a wardrobe open and its contents fall out at\ntheir feet, and that they had seen the plants in the garden being\nbroken, but did not see any one doing it. Raps had been heard\nat night on the walls and on the furniture, and he had himself\ntwice visited the house, and had seen, as had many other persons,\nthe bed-clothes in the garden, the furniture upset, and the plants\ntorn up.\nThe Editor replied in a letter, also published in the \" Messager\nde I'occulte,\" ascribing the phenomena to the presence of some medium,\nmediums being, he asserted, a kind of human battery, generating a\nspecies of electricity : hence the noises, breakages, and various\nother phenomena. The letter concluded by advocating the piercing\nof the air with some pointed steel object, on the theory that the\nsteel would act as a lightning conductor, and so put a stop to\nthe phenomena.\nM. C. , in replying, said that the A 's already suspected\ntheir daughter Jeanne to be in some way connected with the\nphenomena, and he thought that her brother, aged six, must also\nbe a medium, as each ' of them, when alone, had seen the phenomena\ntaking place. He also recounted the incident of the glass of water\n(see below), and stated that some days before a fork, spoon and\nknife, and a nail, had been found in Jeanne's bed, and that the\ngirl herself was growing thin, and losing her appetite.\nJeanne was, in fact, beginning to look ill, and Dr. E (the\nname is only withheld to avoid disclosing the name of the town\nin which these events actually took place), who saw her casually,\nadvised her parents to send her to the hospital, adding that her\nremoval would enable them to judge of her influence on the\nphenomena. After her admission to the hospital, an attempt\nwas made to hypnotise her, but she resisted, and in the evening\nhad an attack of hysteria, with hallucination, believing that she\nsaw a skeleton in front of her. During the night she crawled\n\f474 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nabout on all fours under the beds of the ward, eventually\nreturning to her own bed. \u25a0\nDuring her absence from home, nothing unusual occurred at\nthe A 's, but when on the eighth day she left the hospital\nand came home, the original phenomena immediately began again.\nShe now suffered from frequent attacks of hysteria, and Mme.\nA , in hopes of finding a cure, went to consult a somnambulist.\nThe somnambulist declared without hesitation that Jeanne was\npersecuted by some one who had \" bewitched \" her, and said that\nshe would show the girl who this person was. Jeanne was taken to\nsee her, and the somnambulist gave her a glass of water on a white\nplate, and told her to look at the bottom of the glass.\nJeanne did so, but saw nothing. On being told to look again,\nshe still saw only the white plate, but on a third trial, being\nasked if she did not see a figure, she said she seemed to see a\nhead, and in answer to a further question, described it as that\nof an old woman, wrinkled, with decayed teeth and a snub-nose.\nand wearing a black bonnet. She was then asked if she would\nrecognise her if she met her, and said \" yes.\"\nHer mother was anxious to see the old woman for herself, but\nwhen she looked, saw only the white plate. The somnambulist\ntold them to repeat the experiment at midnight, when Jeanne\nwould be able to describe the woman more clearly : at midnight,\naccordingly, she was again given a glass of water, when she saw\nthe old woman very distinctly, and described her in detail, from\nher dirty skirt and apron, and black bodice striped with red,\ndown to her rings, in one of which was a garnet.\nAfter this there could no longer be any doubt but that they\nwere persecuted by an old woman who wished the family ill ;\nit only remained to discover who was the woman described by\nJeanne, and this Mme. A was not long in doing. She re\ncalled an old story which she had told her family more than\nonce, of how her mother had suffered for a long time before her\ndeath, and how this prolonged agony, being thought unnatural by\nthose about her, was looked upon as the work of some one\ndesirous of revenge, who prevented the dying woman from draw\ning her last breath. A neighbour had told them that to discover\nwho this person was, they should burn two vine-shoots in the form\nof a cross, with salt upon them, when she would shortly appear.\nThis was done, and soon afterwards a friend of the sick woman,\nwho had heard of her hopeless condition, came in to see her. But\n\fXLIX.] 475\nHistory of a Haunted House.\non her approaching the bed and crossing herself, the patient had\nmade a grimace, whereupon the family had seized the false friend\nand driven her, not without some ill-treatment, out of the house.\nThe dying woman then immediately expired. Nothing further\nhad since been heard of this woman, but she was still alive, and\nliving in Daimonopolis, in the Rue de la Colline; might it not\ntherefore be she who was now taking her revenge by causing these\nphenomena 1\nIn order to find out, it was decided to question the rapping\nspirits. These raps were never heard in the daytime, nor during\nthe night, but always in the early morning when every one was\nstill in bed.\nOne morning, then, when the raps were heard on the partition\nseparating Jeanne's room from her parents', while the family were\nall in bed, they entered into conversation with the spirit, and in\nanswer to questions were informed that the only person against\nwhom it bore a grudge was Jeanne, not on account of anything\nshe had done, but for vengeance on behalf of an old woman\nliving in the Rue de la Colline. They asked if by beating or\nkilling her the phenomena would be put an end to. The answer\nto this was \"no.\"\nIf they did nothing, would they cease ? \" Yes.\"\nWould the money and other articles which had disappeared be\nreturned ? \" No.\"\nNumerous other questions were put, the raps in reply to all of\nwhich were struck close to the bed in which Jeanne slept.\nMme. A was now sure of their tormentor, but in order to\ndiscover whether she was the woman seen by Jeanne in the glass\nof water, she decided to show her to her daughter and see\nwhether the latter would recognise her.\nAccordingly they went together one day to the Rue de la\nColline, where, amidst a group of women gossipping in the road,\nshe saw the supposed enemy of the family, and called Jeanne's\nattention to the group.\nThe girl cried out in alarm that it was she, and on her mother's\nfeigning ignorance and asking, \"Who?\" said that it was the old\nwoman she had seen in the glass, and begged her to come away,\nas she was frightened. This was conclusive, and it only remained\nto discover what could be done against their tormentor.\nNew phenomena, in fact, were now added to the old ones.\nThe grandfather, on going into his room one evening, found all\n\f476 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nthe candles alight, and a crown and several crosses made of dried\ngrasses on his bed. A basket and various other articles dis\nappeared, and some squares of flannel, with pins stuck through\nthem, which had been placed on the mantelpiece, were subsequently\nfound in holes in the garden-wall, but without the pins.\nJeanne, while sleeping with her mother, felt herself pricked in\ndifferent parts of the body, and Mme. A found among the sheets\npins, forks and nails, which nobody, she said, had put there.\nIt was now decided to put into practice the method suggested\nby the editor of the Messager de I'occulte in his letter of Jan. 5th\n(viz. the use of pointed steel to draw off the electric currents\ngenerated by the medium), and this was done under the following\ncircumstances.\nOne morning, Mme. A , who was sleeping with Jeanne, felt\nthe bed shaking under her. She made Jeanne get up, and re\nmained in it alone to defy the spirits. The bed began to tremble\nmore violently than before, and she accused the children of shak\ning it; they all denied it, however, and to make sure that no one\nwas touching it, she sent for her father-in-law and had the bed put\nout in the middle of the room and surrounded by her family, while\nthe grandfather, armed with a sword-stick, stood ready to carry\nout the editor's instructions.\nAs the bed now ceased to shake, Mme. A deemed herself\nvictorious, and began to defy and abuse the spirits in the most\nvigorous language ; the bed was then violently agitated, and the\ngrandfather cut and thrust with his sword in all directions,\nround and even under it.\nHe stopped at length, exhausted, and they anxiously awaited\nthe result, but the bed still shook, and Mme. A got up,\nmuch discouraged by the failure of the experiment.\nAs all their troubles were occasioned by the old woman in the\nRue de la Colline, the best course now seemed to come to some\nunderstanding with her; but as Mme. A was unwilling to\nseek her in her own house, she consulted the somnambulist\nas to the possibility of inducing her to come to theirs.\nThis, she was assured, was quite simple; they had only to\nshut themselves up in the house and burn a cat alive on the hearth\ntowards eleven o'clock at night; but whatever happened, under\nno pretext whatsoever was any one to leave the house, nor was it\nnecessary to leave a door open, as she knew perfectly well how\nto come in without that.\n\fXLIX.] 477\nHistory of a Haunted Home.\nWhen the evening came, M. A informed one of his friends,\nand they shut themselves up, and towards eleven o'clock burned\nthe cat. At that moment a loud noise, like a clap of thunder, was\nheard outside, but despite their astonishment they followed the\nsomnambulist's advice, and no one left the house. Loud knocks\nwere heard on the door and on the partition, and they were\nawaiting the appearance of the old woman, when Jeanne, who was\nin bed, uttered a loud cry. She had a feeling of strangulation,\nscreamed and struggled violently, and Was evidently suffering from\nan attack of hysteria. Her parents, who saw her for the first\ntime in this state, were greatly alarmed and feared for her life.\nThe doctor who was called in advised their sending her to the\nhospital at Montpellier, which they did, in spite of the distance,\nand she was admitted on February 20th, 1902.\n[A brief account of Jeanne's condition since her admission to the\nhospital is here given, of which the following is the substance] :\nBetween February 20th and March 18th the patient had three\nviolent hysterical attacks. These attacks lasted from 10 to 20 minutes,\nand were accompanied by a sensation of strangulation, when the\nbreathing was suspended, the face congested, and the eyes convulsed.\nClonic convulsions followed, with loud outcries, and at this stage\nthe patient became cataleptic, retained any attitude in which she\nwas put, and was completely insensible. The loss of consciousness\nwas absolute. She also had slighter attacks, accompanied by con\nvulsive movements, but without loss of consciousness. She had\nno hallucinations since entering the hospital. As regards the\nsensory condition, there was conjunctival and pharyngeal anaesthesia,\nand also variable and transitory anaesthesiae of many other parts of\nthe body; three different examinations all giving different results.\nIn each of the examinations the anaesthetic parts were insensible\nto touch, to temperature and to pain ; but notwithstanding the\ncomplete anaesthesia of the left hand, the patient was able to\ndistinguish the forms of objects, ,and to recognise them. With\nher eyes closed she knows when her legs are stretched out or\nbrought near together, but if they are crossed one above the other\nshe invariably makes a mistake, and asserts without hesitation that\nthe left is over the right, when the right is over the left, or vice\nversa; and if, when her eyes are closed and her legs crossed, one of\nher feet is pricked, she localises the prick in the other foot.\nWith regard to sight, there was restriction of the visual field\nof both eyes. For colours the sight of the left eye was normal,\n\f478 [part\nDr. J. Grasset.\nbut there was dyachromatopsia of the right eye ; she saw red as\nviolet. Her hearing was normal; motility, normal except during\nthe crises; and reflexes, normal.\nHer intelligence was normal ; her moral sense, very weak. She\nstole money and various articles from her companions, and was\nextremely untruthful, inventing all manner of scandalous stories\nof which she herself was the heroine.\nShe amused herself at first by rapping on her table during the\nnight, to induce a belief in the presence of spirits, and asked the\nnurse if she did not hear the raps.\nShe was put under a tonic regime, with treatment by electricity,\netc. At the present time she no longer has attacks, is much\nimproved in health, and her character has changed for the better.\nThe first impression produced by this long and curious story\nis that there was obviously a mixture of fraud, hysteria, and\ncredulity.\nThe fraud, to begin with, is evident. We have seen the interest\nwhich these good people naturally had in preventing the house\nfrom being sold or let, and that no serious attempt was ever made\nto guard against practical joking. There were either no locks on the\ndoors, or they were found torn off when the phenomena occurred.\nA savage dog was shut into the house, and was found at large,\nwithout his having barked. Evidently the door had been opened,\nand that by one of the household. When the precaution of using\nthreads and seals was taken, nothing happened. When sawdust\nwas put down, the spirit swept it up with the mattresses so that\nno footprints might be seen.\nGranted the fraud, then, who were its authors ? It is hardly to\nbe supposed that the entire family were implicated; the younger\nchildren probably were not, nor the grandfather.\nIt is clear that Jeanne was the principal figure in the affair.\nHer morals were detestable, as was proved at the hospital by the\nphenomena of rapping, purse-stealing, etc.; here, however, she was\nobliged to confess to fraud.\nWhether she had accomplices or not it is difficult to say.\nMme. A 's account is very clear, very detailed, and neither\ndates nor facts are omitted, but this is not conclusive. Moreover,\nit is sufficient for our purpose to have established the fact that\nthere icas fraud, and that Jeanne, with or without assistance, was\nits chief perpetrator.\n\fxlix.] History of a Haunted House. 479\nBut was the affair all fraud? Certainly not. Jeanne's hysteria\nwas undoubtedly genuine, the attacks, hysterogenetic zones, etc.,\nwere typical. One peculiarity of the tactile anaesthesia of both\nhands may be noted, that while they were insensible to the sharpest\npricks, she was yet able to recognise, with her eyes closed, a brooch\nput into her hand, and to fasten it very deftly into her bodice,\nalso to take down and put up her hair, etc.\nThe allochirical error which induced her to localise in the left\nfoot the sensations of the right when her legs are crossed, is even\nmore curious, and very characteristic of hysteria.\nIt is possible also that some of the raps and movements of\nobjects were not fraudulent, especially the raps which replied to\nthe questions about the old woman. Ochorowicz has said that\nfraud is inseparable from mediumism as simulation is inseparable\nfrom hypnotism, but that science ought to study both. Some of\nJeanne's seances may come under the head of unconscious fraud,\nnotably the one in which, after burning the cat, they awaited the\narrival of the old woman. They were all in a state of strained\nexpectation ; she rapped as the thunder rolled, and the scene ended\nin loud cries and a violent attack of hysteria. The raps in this\ncase were probably produced involuntarily, and it is these uncon\nscious frauds that stand out from the deliberate trickery and are\ndeserving of study.\nThe vision in the glass of water was also probably a genuine case\nof crystal vision.\nIf we now come to consider the psychological environment of the\ncase, we find that the children of eight and six years old said that\nthey had seen the wardrobe open and the linen come out, the plants\ntorn up, etc. Now, it is a matter of common knowledge how little\nchildish testimony is to be trusted. No doubt they saw the clothes\non the ground and the devastation in the garden, and by dint of\nconstant discussion on the subject ended by thinking they had\nactually seen the transport of the linen and other objects.\nNext comes the grandfather, with his hypothesis of spirit-inter\nvention ready to hand upon the first appearance of the phenomena,\nand the pseudo-scientific barber, who reads the Messager de I'occulte\nand knows that nowadays all these things are amenable to scientific\nmethods. He understands the theory of the sword-points, and knows\nthat it is a truly scientific remedy and not one of the old wives\nfables that held currency in the earlier centuries.\nBeyond all these there remains the crowd,\u2014the credulous, sheep-like\n2i\n\f480 [past\nDr. J. Gra88et.\ncrowd,\u2014brought together by curiosity, whose one idea is that there\nmust be an author of the mischief, and that he must be punished.\nWell was it for the old woman they accused that the burning of\na cat sufficed them. Had the remedy been her own death, there\nwould have been five hundred arms ready in an instant to fling\nher into the canal. Yet not one of these persons, left to his own\ndevices, would so much as have harmed a fly. It was the\ngregarious instinct exciting them, and the gregarious spirit is both\npuerile and brutal. Such is the psychology of the crowd\n\fXLIX.] 481\nReview.\nII.\nREVIEWS.\nHypnotism: its History, Practice, and Theory. By J. Milne Bram-\nWELL, M.B., C.M. (London : Grant Richards. 1903. 8vo., pp. 478.\nPrice 18s. net.)\nThis is a remarkable book\u2014remarkable not only for what it\nsays, but even more for what it abstains from saying. Dr. Bramwell\nis best known perhaps as a distinguished practitioner, who has had\nno small share in raising hypnotism to the recognised and almost\northodox position which, after many decades of calumny, is now\naccorded to it by the medical profession in Great Britain. This\nalone would entitle him to our attention. But he is more than\nthis; he is an active and acute enquirer. He has made himself\nthe historian of hypnotism, and has been the first to bring fully to\nlight the splendid work of his countryman and predecessor, James\nBraid ; work which had been too long ignored, and must now take\nits place among the most original and illuminating contributions of\nGreat Britain to mental and medical science. And he is beside a\nkeen and trenchant psychologist\u2014not merely a critic of the theories\nof others, but the author of a remarkable series of experiments\nwhich have done much to throw fresh light on the theory of his\ncraft. And yet, after many years of practice, of research, and\nreflection, he ends with a confession of ignorance ; he leaves us face\nto face with a mystery ; he has no theory to give us of the means\nby which he attains his ends, or of the physiological or psychical\nprocesses which they involve.\nThis attitude is at first sight perhaps rather disappointing ; but it is\nno small gain that the question should at length, and perhaps for the\nfirst time in its history, be removed from the heated atmosphere of\nrash assertion, blind prejudice, and more than theological persecu\n\f482 [part\nDr. Walter Leaf.\ntion in which it has passed its stormy and none too healthy\ninfancy. It is one of the hardest of scientific lessons to learn to\nstate mere facts uncoloured by preconceived ideas, and it is at least\na proof of courage that Dr. Bramwell, in spite of all temptations,\nshould have held fast to this attitude of detachment. He practically\ndemolishes all previous theories, and allows us to start fresh with a\ntabula rasa ; we can turn our backs on the errors of the past, and\ncultivate that coolness which may help us to build something\nmore or less enduring.\nBramwell deals, as his title tells us, with the history, practice,\nand theory of hypnotism. Of these three, the first is briefly treated\nin a single chapter and an Appendix ; but these are of great interest,\nboth from the account they give of the \"scientific,\" or rather pro\nfessional, persecution to which Elliotson was subjected, and of the\nlater and little known researches of Braid. One would gladly let\nthe moral tortures of the medical \" Holy Office,\" as administered to\nElliotson, and in some degree to Esdaile, fall into oblivion, were it\nnot that the spirit which prompted them is still notoriously in\nexistence. It would be a comfort to think that blind intolerance\nand absolute refusal to investigate may be a necessary test for the\npurging of false doctrine j but it is hard to believe that any help\nwas given to the cause of truth by Elliotson's professional ruin, or\nthat the delay of some forty years in the acceptance of so much of\nhis doctrines as has proved true can be a gain to science, outweighing\nboth the suffering which might have been saved to patients and\nthe undoubted moral harm done by a perverse refusal to face un\nfamiliar facts. The action of the British Medical Association in\nreferring back the report of its own very strong Committee so\nrecently as 1892 shows that the spirit of professional obscurantism\ndies hard, even in the temples of science. As for Braid, though he\nwas not tabooed as his two contemporaries were, he was ignored\ntill his discoveries were made over again across the Channel. How\never, he may be content to share the fate of Newton, who, as we\nnow know from his unpublished papers, anticipated many conse\nquences of his theories, which were loudly proclaimed as new and\nbrilliant discoveries by the Epigoni of mathematical astronomy.\nBramwell has shown that the most advanced theories of the famous\nNancy workers are often to be found not merely in embryo, but often\nin a fuller and more satisfactory form, in Braid's latest work, some of\nwhich remains still in MS.\nAbout half of the book, pages 41 to 272, deals with practical\n\fXLIX.] 483\nReview.\nhypnotism, with a series of successful cases, mostly from Bramwell's\nown practice, illustrating the great therapeutic value of the method.\nWith these we need not here deal, as they are largely of a technical\ncharacter, and do not produce much novelty. Dr. Bramwell is, how\never, particularly to be congratulated on the success with which he\nhas tackled nervous cases on the borderland, if not actually in the\ndomain, of insanity\u2014cases which, from previous experience, might\nhave been supposed absolutely refractory. It will be found, too,\nthat there is no ground whatever for the idea which at one time\nfound supporters of a superior susceptibility of the Latin race to\nsuggestive treatment. Dr. Bramwell's figures on this head are most\ninteresting. Attention may particularly be called to the marked\ndifference he found between the susceptibility of the patients from\nhis general practice at Goole, where he failed to affect only two\nout of 500 cases, and those which came to him as a consulting\nspecialist. Of the first 100 cases of the latter, no less than 22\nproved refractory. This is, of course, due to the fact that this\nlatter group were almost always difficult nervous cases only brought\nto him in advanced stages, where ordinary therapeutic means had\nalready failed.\nBut to Psychical Researchers it is Bramwell's long and important\nchapter xii. which will have the most immediate interest, and with\nthis we now propose to deal. The two questions discussed in it are\nvital ; what is the nature, the differentia, of the hypnotic state ?\nAnd what is the mechanism by which this state can be artificially\ninduced 1\nWe can put aside at once the earlier transcendental answers, and\nthe rash theories of magnetic and odylic force ; a sufficient answer\nto them has been long since found. The theories which have of\nlate years been current have mostly supposed that the hypnotic\nstate means an inhibition of normal faculties, produced either by\nphysical stimulation (Heidenhain) or by partial mental fatigue or\nconcentration. The typical state has been taken to be one of som\nnolence, and it is on this assumption that the very name of\nhypnotism was invented by Braid, though, as Bramwell shows, he\nsubsequently gave up both the assumption and the name, for which\nhe substituted Monoideism. Braid had, in fact, made the important\nobservation, which has only been slowly rediscovered, that somnol\nence is only an unessential and subsidiary symptom of what, for the\nsake of convenience, we must still call the hypnotic condition. The\nessential phenomena can in fact be produced without exception in a\n\f484 [part\nDr. Walter Leaf,\nstate which is one of alertness, or at all events involves neither un\nconsciousness nor amnesia. Thus the problem of the difference\nbetween hypnotic and ordinary sleep loses the importance which was\nonce attached to it, and becomes only part of a larger question.\nWhat, then, in BramwelFs opinion is the nature of the \" hypnotic \"\nstate ? He gives no formal answer to this question. He speaks\nindeed of the normal and hypnotic states as \"practically identical\"\n(p. 333), though immediately correcting this by admitting the in\ncreased suggestibility of the hypnotic subject. But on the negative\nside he brings all his arguments, and much fresh material, against\nthe idea of automatism. The subject is not the mere tool of the\noperator. The willingness of the subject to accept and carry out\nsuggestion is limited (p. 337) by the important condition that the\nsuggestion must not be \"criminal or improper.\" It would also\nappear that it must not be disagreeable\u2014a vague and further reach\ning word. It would seem, therefore, though I do not find any\nabsolute definition, that Bramwell regards the hypnotic state as one\nof increased obedience to neutral suggestions, i.e. to those which in\nthe normal state would not be regarded as either disagreeable or\nwrong. It might seem, indeed, that this hardly covers the obedience\nwhich is shown, let us say, in public exhibitions. One would not\na priori have supposed that the ordinary undergraduate in his\nnormal state would consent to chew a tallow candle under the idea\nthat it was sugar candy, or nurse a handkerchief among the derisive\ncheers of his friends when told that it was a baby. Bramwell\nwould, I gather, include such displays among those which afford us\nthe pleasure of \"showing off our various gifts and attainments\"\n(p. 327), though the undergraduate, if proud of his capacity of feed\ning a handkerchief from an imaginary pap-bottle, would appear in\nordinary life laudably anxious to deny himself the public gratifica\ntion of this particular vanity. In fact, I cannot help thinking that\nBramwell is inclined to minimise the increased suggestibility of\nhypnosis. Even, however, if this be so, he makes it very clear that\nthe Nancy practitioners have on the other hand enormously ex\naggerated the possibilities of induced \"automatism.\" We may well\nadmit on the one hand that the boundary of acts which the subject\nregards as neutral can be shifted in the automatic state so as to\ninclude many which in ordinary life would be considered disagree\nable, without impairing the power of resistance to those which\ninvolve an absolute offence to the moral nature. And by his\nresolute insistence upon the retention of this power, Bramwell has\n\fXLIX.] 485\nReview.\nrendered an immense service to students of the subject. He speaks\nwith the authority of enormous experience when he tells us that,\nso far as he has seen, improper suggestions are invariably rejected ;\nand he can justly appeal to the fact that, after all the years in\nwhich hypnotism has been a matter of public marvel and ignorant\nexaggeration, there has not been found a single proved case of\ncrime effected by means of it. This conclusion is one of the\nmost solid results of his book.\nOne word more on this question of suggestion. Bramwell hardly\ntreats with sufficient seriousness some of Bernheim's arguments,\nnotably the purely psychological theorem that \"an idea has a tend\nency to generate its actuality.\" He argues that, on the contrary\n(1) \"A suggested idea has generally a tendency to generate noth\ning. (2) A suggested idea has frequently a tendency to generate\nits opposite. (3) A suggested idea rarely tends to generate its\nactuality.\" But the arguments he adduces in favour of this whole\nsale negation are really hardly worthy of the book. For (1) he\nonly urges that \"a very casual glance at the events of everyday\nlife would compel us to conclude that this class is the commonest\nof the three. This is evident if we think of the numberless things\nineffectually suggested in the family circle to domestics, workmen,\ntradespeople, friends, acquaintances, etc.\" (p. 331). This is, of\ncourse, only chaff; but it hardly seems to be in place. It is\ntrue that the butcher may bring a rump-steak when the cook has\n\"suggested\" a mutton-chop; but it is only in her least scientific\nmoments that the housewife would venture to say that the order\nto bring the chop produced \"no result\" in a majority of cases.\nSo, too, as an instance where suggestion produces a result opposite\nto that intended, Bramwell instances the thief who only runs\naway the faster when told to stop. But, of course, neither\nBernheim nor any one else has asserted that suggestion always pro\nduces the effect intended, and it is illogical to argue that because\nthe effect has not been produced, there has been no tendency to\nproduce it. Obviously in the case of the thief the tendency is\ncounteracted by other motives; but if Bramwell were to say\n\"Stop\" to 20 passers-by in Piccadilly, it is highly probable that 19\nof them would give a momentary obedience. Indeed, no better wit\nness to the truth of the theorem impugned is needed than\nBramwell himself. He is accustomed to make to patients in the\nnormal state a particular suggestion, that of rest. He tells us that\nin from 75 to 100 per cent of his cases the idea generates its\n\f486 [part\nDr. Walter Leaf.\nactuality, and (p. 333) that \" the tendency must be in favour of\nthe results, which are numerically the greater of the two.\" In\nfact, if he denies the fundamental proposition that an idea tends\nto generate its actuality, it is hard to see what meaning is left\nto the word \" suggestion \" at all, or why any one should ever take\nthe trouble to suggest anything, either in ordinary life or medical\npractice.\nBut leaving persiflage aside, with this protest, we come to the\nserious and solid conclusion, which may now be regarded as estab\nlished, that so far as suggestibility is concerned there is no great\ndifference between the normal and hypnotic states ; that the differ\nence lies in the temporary removal of motives tending to counteract\nthe suggestion ; and finally, that this removal does not imply any\ninhibition of faculty. Here Bramwell is really in serious conflict\nwith the Nancy observers ; he boldly asserts that there is not only\nno inhibition, but an actual extension, or perhaps we should rather\nsay a liberation, of faculty. This is the position which constitutes\nthe second notable point in the book. It is, of course, not novel.\nIt means that Bramwell accepts, at least in large measure, Myers's\ntheory of the subliminal self. Though he does not regard this\ntheory as a complete explanation of the facts, he holds that it is\nthe nearest approach to one that has yet been made. This is the\nmore noteworthy because he is distinctly sceptical as to the exist\nence of any transcendental powers in the subliminal self. He has,\nfor instance, come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient\nevidence for telepathy. It is hardly fair to enter into an argument\nwith him here on what is merely an obiter dictum, nor can we\nadmit that the experiments of Gurney and others can be dismissed\nas founded on errors of observation. But it is just as well that we\nshould have the testimony of so impartial and sceptical an observer\nto the importance of Myers's general theory, even when stripped of\nthat on which the theory is commonly supposed to rest entirely.\nWhat Bramwell does hold is that the hypnotic state shows just\nsuch extension of faculty as Myers postulates for the subliminal\nself. Bramwell has himself added much to our knowledge of this\nextended faculty by his remarkable series of experiments on time\nappreciation, where orders were carried out at the expiration of\nsuch periods as 20,290 minutes from the giving of the order\u2014\nperiods which in her normal state his subject was incapable of\ncorrectly calculating, and even in the hypnotic could reduce to days\nand hours only with errors. Strange to say, even when she made\n\fXLIX.] 487\nReview.\nan error in the former calculation, the order was none the less\ncarried out at the expiration of the correct period. From this\nBramwell draws the conclusion, inevitable as it would seem, that\nbelow the stratum of consciousness brought to the surface by\nhypnotism, there is a \"sub-subliminal\" stratum intellectually more\ncapable than either of the two above it. But he only admits this\nwith great reserve. He includes it among the theories which can\nnot be considered satisfactory (p. 418), and still maintains a purely\nnegative attitude with regard to any general explanation of hypnotic\nphenomena. Of course such a suspension of judgment is from the\nstrictly scientific point of view unassailable ; but it has the dis\nadvantage of not giving any assistance in the further investigation,\nand one cannot but be somewhat disappointed at it.\nAfter a careful study of the book, I feel that it has produced more\ndefinite conclusions in my own mind than in its author's. Perhaps\nI may be permitted to sketch these. We will take the question on\np. 416 to which Bramwell says that \"no reasonable answer has yet\nbeen given.\" What is the connexion between hypnotic methods and the\nproduction of hypnotic phenomena ? \" Personally,\" says Bramwell, \" I\ncan see no logical connexion between the acts of fixed gazing, of\nconcentration of attention, or of suggested ideas of drowsy states,\nand the wide and varied phenomena of hypnosis.\" But all the\nhypnotic methods have one thing in common, the diversion of attention\nfrom the insistency of external surroundings ; and in Bramwell's own\nbelief\u2014and I agree with him\u2014the hypnotic state has one broad\ncharacteristic, the working of a subliminal consciousness in directions\nunusual in ordinary life. Surely there is a logical connexion between\nthe two; it is reasonable to suppose that the subliminal self may\nrequire, with the help of the suggesting operator, to shake off the\nurgent claims of conscious life, before it can devote itself to the\nhidden processes of the unconscious.\nSuggestion seems in fact to be throughout of the nature of good\nadvice which the unconscious self is very glad to take. The operator's\nfirst advice, in whatever form it is given, comes to this, \"Be\nabstracted ; do not think of what is outside you.\" Then follow the\npositive suggestions, \"Think of your malady, and see if you cannot\nmake things work right,\" or whatever they may be. One effect of\nabstraction, even when it is not the result of external suggestion, is\nto produce indifference to some matters which in ordinary life seem\nimportant, e.g. the fear of ridicule. The abstracted philosopher may\ndo things publicly as absurd as the undergraduate on the platform ;\n\f488 [part\nDr. Walter Leaf.\nand public exhibitions do not as a rule rise above the display of\nthis particular quality of abstraction. We are certainly not justified\nby anything that we know in supposing that mere abstraction will\nproduce indifference to deeply seated feelings, such for instance as\na woman's modesty ; and in fact Bramwell brings very strong evidence\nto show that it does not. All that suggestion does is to set the\nunconscious but very rational self working on fresh lines. It is\ncapable of judging if the advice which the operator is giving is good\nor otherwise, and of selecting the good. It has in fact a fresh\npurview of life, part of which is for the conscious self only obscured\nby the light of common day, and for that very reason when revealed\nseems supernormal. Bramwell is no doubt right in objecting to\nBraid's later term \" Monoideism,\" on the ground that the hypnotised\nsubject has a wide range of ideas. A better and not much uglier\nname would be Heteroideism. The mind is concentrated not on one\nidea, but on a whole field of ideas which are not those of common\nlife. Braid, in fact, if he did not, as in so many things he did, quite\nhit the mark, was very near it. All seems to point to the theory\nthat the mind has only a limited amount of attention to dispose of,\nbut has much freedom as to the direction of this attention. Hypnotism\nmeans the direction of attention upon a region chosen by the mind\nitself, under the influence of external suggestion. How the suggestion\nacts is of course a master-problem, which we are not yet in a position\nto answer ; how one mind can influence another at all is at least\nas dark as the sister question how the mind can influence the body.\nWhen we can answer it we \"shall know what God and man is.\"\nBut Bramwell's contribution to the knowledge of Self seems to me\ninvaluable, mainly because it puts aside all the mechanical theories\nwhich have hitherto held the field in fashionable science, and leaves\nus no choice but to turn to a view which strengthens the moral\nsignificance of the hidden workings of the mind, and deepens our\nsense at once of individual responsibility and mutual influence.\nThe diversion of the attention of the self to the operations of the\nsubliminal region, though it does not explain the power of time-\nappreciation, does something to render it less marvellous. I have\nmyself often noticed, during a long and monotonous tramp, how my\nown sense of time was heightened, so that before taking out my\nwatch I have been able to tell almost to a minute where the hands\nwould be. As to the mechanism by which this was done, I have\nnot the least idea ; but it is obvious that the rhythmical pacing gives\nan approximate standard of measurement which was entirely absent\n\fXL1X.] 489\nReview.\nin the case of Dr. Bramwell's subject. The accuracy of her calculations\ntherefore still remains astounding, though only greater in degree\nthan our normal powers. It is noticeable that her ability seems to\nhave been capable of improvement by training, again offering an\nanalogy to the operations of conscious life. It is possible to train\noneself, as most photographers know, to a very fair appreciation of\nshort periods of time, say from 5 to 10 seconds. If I may again\nrefer to my own experience, I find that I can do this by repeating\nmonotonously the words \"rickety dickety dick,\" which take exactly\none second for clear enunciation. The muscles, if rhythmically moved,\nsoon acquire the right pace, and will keep it up with reasonable\nuniformity for a short time, if the attention is directed to them.\nAnother possible standard is that of the heart-beats; but it must\nbe confessed that there is a difficulty in imagining any subject so\nsteady of nerve and so uniform in health that these would serve\nfor a time-piece over periods of several days. In short, Bramwell's\ntime experiments seem likely to afford a puzzle which it will take\nmuch more knowledge and experiment to solve, even roughly. Here\nagain he has made a solid and most suggestive contribution to\nscience.\nFinally, one word may be added to what Bramwell has said about\nthe supposed dangers of hypnotism. While fully and gladly accepting\nwhat he says about the impossibility of imposing criminal or dis\nhonourable actions upon an unwilling subject, I am inclined to think\nthat there is a more subtle risk which must not be quite left out\nof sight. This arises from the way in which hypnotism has been\nmade the object of popular discussion. Few patients, probably, come\nbefore a medical hypnotist without strong preconceived and wholly\nerroneous ideas as to the nature of the process. A large number of\nthem will include among these the belief that there is something\nuncanny in the method, and in particular that the operator gains\nsomething in the nature of a mystical influence. If the prejudice\nagainst the treatment is overcome, this belief is still very apt to\nremain, and it is so closely analogous to the deeper instincts to which\nwe have already referred, that it is, as I have had occasion to observe,\nextremely difficult to uproot, even with all the precautions taken by\nBramwell himself. And the belief, however unfounded, that such an\ninfluence exists, is in itself the possible source, not perhaps of real\ndanger, but of a state of mind which is at least very undesirable in\na nervous patient. This is a serious obstacle in the way of all\nhypnotic practice, and one hardly sees how it is to be entirely\n\f490 [part\nBr. Walter Leaf.\nremoved save by the slow and patient education of public opinion,\nboth professional and lay. The average medical man, no less than\nthe average patient, needs to have the whole subject stripped of the\nsupernatural and abnormal, and put before him in the driest light\nof dispassionate science ; and perhaps, for the benefit of sufferers at\nleast, Bramwell's chief service is that he should so resolutely have\nstruck out of his book anything that has the least savour of the\nuncanny or abnormal or sensational, and given us a treatise which\noffers little for the paragraphist of the halfpenny press, but infinite\ninterest, not only to the scientific thinker, but to every one who\ndesires to know more of the workings of that extraordinary complex\nwhich we call Self. Walter Leaf.\nLes Plu'nomenes Psychiques: llecherches, Observations, MUhmies, Par le\nDr. J. Maxwell. Preface du Professeur Ch. Richet. (F\u00e9lix Alcan.\nBibliotheque de Philosophic contemporaine. Paris, 1904. 1 vol.,\n8vo. 5 fr.)\nThe chief obstacle to the establishment of any kind of recognised\nscientific basis for the class of phenomena known as psychic is of\ncourse to be found in the universal disinclination which exists to\naccept, as of any cogency towards the formation of one's own opinion\nregarding these phenomena, the experience of another observer, how\never well accredited and competent. While we are probably all\npersonally conscious of this tendency, it is not very easy to account\nfor it. In other branches of science it is but necessary to announce\nsome new discovery for it to be accepted, without undue surprise,\nby the uncritical public, however greatly it may transcend their\nown personal experience ; and a failure to regard even the wildest\nhypothesis concerning it as a possible contribution to truth is held\na mark of a very lamentable lack of intellectual elasticity. But in\npsychic phenomena the observations of the very same individual\nwhose opinions in any other sphere would be received with universal\nrespect, are dismissed as unworthy of serious attention, and the only\nemotion aroused is one of general regret that another good man\nshould have gone wrong. Against this attitude Professor Richet, in\nhis preface to the remarkable book before me, makes strong appeal.\n\" My advice to the reader,\" he says, \" may be summed up in a few\nwords. This is a book to be approached without prejudices, fearing\nneither that which is new nor that^ which is unforeseen. In other\nwords, while preserving the most scrupulous respect for the science\n\fXLIX.] 491\nReview.\nof to-day, one should be thoroughly convinced that such science,\nwhatever measure of truth it may contain, is nevertheless terribly\nincomplete. Those imprudent spirits who occupy themselves with\nthe 'occult' sciences are accused of overthrowing Science, and of\ndestroying the laborious edifice raised by thousands of toilers, at the\ncost of immense labour, during the last three or four centuries. This\nreproach seems to me quite unjust. No one is able to destroy a\nscientific fact. ... If, as appears more and more likely, those facts\nwhich are called occult come to be established, one need in no way\ndisturb oneself as to the fate of classical science. Unknown or new\nfacts, however strange, are not going to destroy the truth of old\nones. To take an example from M. Maxwell's work, suppose we admit\nthat the phenomenon of ' raps '\u2014that is to say, audible vibrations in\nwood or other substances\u2014is a real phenomenon, and that in certain\ncases there may be blows which no mechanical force known to us\ncan explain, would the science of physics be overthrown 1 It\nwould indeed be a new force exercised on matter, but the old forces\nwould none the less preserve their activity, and it is even likely that\nthe transmission of vibrations by means of this new force would\nfollow the same laws as other vibrations, and that temperature, pres\nsure, and the density of the air or of the wood might continue to\nexercise their usual influence. Is there a single man of science worthy\nof the name who can affirm that there are no forces, hitherto un\nknown, at work in the world? Just in the same way that science\nis unconquerable when it establishes facts, so is it miserably subject\nto error when it seeks to establish negations. . . . Thus it becomes\na true scientist to be at once very modest and very bold; very\nmodest, for our science is but a little thing ; very bold, for the vast\nregions of the worlds unknown lie open before him. Audacity and\nprudence; these are indeed the two qualities, in no wise contra\ndictory, of M. Maxwell's book. Whatever be the fate in store for\nthe ideas which he bases upon his facts, one may rest assured that\nthe facts, which have been well observed by him, will remain. I\nconceive that in these are to be found, however inchoate as yet the\nsketch may be, the lineaments of a new science.\"\nProfessor Richet is indeed an optimist if he means by these words\nto express his belief that facts of this character, however temperately\nstated, however carefully observed, will be accepted by the scientific\nworld, or by any considerable section of the public, in the spirit\nof open-mindedness which he claims as their due. M. Maxwell\nhimself is under no delusions on the subject. He says (p. 293),\n\f492 [part\nHon. Everard Feilding.\n\" My judgment will convince no one ; in such matters as this one\nmust see for oneself before one will be convinced.\" And yet if there\nwas a book which, by reason of the competency and general claim\nto credibility of its author, his scientific status and his intellectual\ncapacity, should merit the attention of even the most prejudiced\ncritic, it is, I venture to think, the work under consideration.\nM. Maxwell began his investigations wholly unbiassed in favour\nof the phenomena which form the subject of them. \"I had\nalways,\" he says (p. 14) \"considered them as unworthy of any\nexamination,\" and it was apparently merely his wish to study the\nreasons for the prevalence of the mystical movement in modern\ntimes which at first directed his attention to the matter. Oppor\ntunities for experiment soon offered themselves and, astonished at\nthe issue of certain of these experiments, he engaged in a series\nextending over the last nine or ten years, the results of which he\nnow lays before the public. M. Maxwell early determined upon\nthe subjects most suitable for experimental observation, and the\nconditions under which alone he would consider evidence as merit\ning serious attention. The phenomena open to research may be\ndivided into two classes, material and intellectual. Under 'material\nand physical phenomena' are comprised (1) raps; (2) movements\nof objects (a) without contact or (b) only with such contact as is insuf\nficient to effect the particular movement in question ; (3) apports,\ni.e. the production of objects by some supernormal agency ; (4)\nvisual phenomena, i.e. the appearance of lights and of forms, lumi\nnous or otherwise, including among the latter the class of alleged\nphenomena known as materialisations ; and (5) phenomena leaving\nsome permanent trace, such as imprints or 'direct' writings or\ndrawings, etc. Under the class of ' intellectual phenomena ' may be\nincluded such occurrences as automatic writing, table tilting, i.e\nmessages produced by the tilting of a table with contact, telepathy,\nclairvoyance of past, distant, or future events, etc. This enumera\ntion, I should perhaps say, does not strictly coincide with M.\nMaxwell's, whose classification appears to me, I confess, somewhat\narbitrary. Although the first class of phenomena are of rarer\nalleged occurrence than the second, M. Maxwell decided that they\nwere susceptible of more exact investigation, and to them accordingly\nhe has mainly directed his researches. As to conditions, he has\nacted rigorously on the principle that no conditions can be regarded\nas satisfactory where there is not sufficient light adequately to\ncontrol the experiments, and that no phenomena occurring in\n\fXLIX.] 493\nReview.\nthe absence of this primary requisite, no matter how perfect the\ncontrol may in other respects seem to be, ought to count towards\nthe formation of his judgment or be quoted in support of his con\nclusions. Acting upon this rule, he has almost invariably insisted on\nconducting the experiments in the light, sometimes broad daylight,\nsometimes daylight tempered by Venetian blinds or otherwise,\nand sometimes lamp-light. It is true that in the case of luminous\nphenomena an exception had to be made, such phenomena being only\nvisible in the dark. Under these conditions, then, he has arrived at\ncertain definite conclusions, conclusions which he announces as being in\nhis own opinion absolutely beyond controversy. He states (p. 23) that\nhe has attested, in a manner which appears to him certain, the\nphenomena of ' raps,' of the movement of objects both without any\nform of contact whatever and with contact of a kind insufficient to\neffect the particular movement, and also certain luminous phenomena.\nIn discussing the value of his conclusions, M. Maxwell says (p. 26),\n\"I have to defend myself against only two enemies, the fraud of\nothers and my own illusions. I am convinced that I have not been\nthe victim either of the one or the other. When, for example, I\nhave observed in broad daylight the moving of a piece of furniture\nin a cafe, a restaurant, or railway refreshment room, I have certainly\nthe right to believe that I am not in the presence of an apparatus\ngot up for the purpose of producing such effects. When the un\nforeseen character of the experiment excludes the hypothesis of\npreparation, and when the absence of any contact between the\nexperimenters and the object moved is manifest both to sight\nand touch, I have sufficient reason for excluding the hypothesis of\nfraud. When I measure the distance between the objects, both\nbefore and after the displacement, I have also sufficient reason for\nexcluding in its turn the hypothesis of the illusion of my senses.\nIf I am refused this right, I ask how indeed is it then possible to\nobserve any fact whatever ? No one is more convinced than myself\nof the frailty of our impressions and the relativity of our perceptions ;\nnevertheless, there must be some way of perceiving a phenomenon\nin order to present it to impartial observation. The objection\nwhich I have supposed cannot indeed be made in any universal\nmanner, for to admit its validity would be to remove any foundation\nfor our sciences. It can only be made to me in my particular\ncapacity, and I admit very willingly that it is impossible for me to\nexculpate myself. I might vainly plead that I am persuaded of\nthe regularity of my perceptions, vainly assert that I discover in\n\f494 [part\nHon. Everard Feilding.\nmyself no tendency to illusions, and my testimony will remain none\nthe less suspected. I have only one defence to make against those\nwho mistrust my qualifications as an observer, and that is to invite\nthem to take the trouble of experimenting on their own account,\nand to employ the same method as myself. ... If I am unable\nsolemnly to affirm the reality of the phenomena observed by me,\nI can at all events affirm my personal conviction of their existence.\nPerhaps in thus affirming only my subjective conviction and in not\nventuring to assert with a like energy the objective reality of the\nthings which I have attested, I am showing an exaggerated distrust\nof myself. I hope at all events that no one will blame me for my\nprudent reserve. Who is there among men who can assert that\nhe has not been deceived 1 But in any case I cannot admit the\nright of any one to criticise my observations without his having put\nhimself in the conditions which have enabled me to make them.\nNothing could be more unreasonable than an attitude of this kind,\nand I cannot recognise the competency of judges who will decide\nwithout preliminary information. For the rest, I am not concerned\nwith converting any one to my views, and I remain indifferent\u2014\nrespectfully indifferent if you will\u2014to the judgment which may be\nformed about me.\" I have quoted M. Maxwell thus at some length\nin support of Professor Richet's claim that audacity joined with\nprudence are the marks of his work.\nI will now proceed to consider some of the actual occurrences\nwhich have led M. Maxwell to his conclusions. Let me say here\nthat unquestionably in his manner of reporting them M. Maxwell\nlays himself open to the criticism that in but few cases does he\ngive such details of the conditions as would be sufficient to enable\na reader to form his own judgment as to their adequacy. It is\ntrue that in abstaining from furnishing a complete account of the\ndetails in the form of a proces-verbal M. Maxwell says he acts advisedly,\non the ground that it is absolutely impossible in fact to give such an\nexhaustive statement of the conditions as would suffice to bring con\nviction to any non-observer, and he points out that, notwithstanding\nthe laboriously detailed reports of the Piper phenomena, they yet\nhave not resulted in convincing every reader, though in the opinion\nof the author, Dr. Hodgson, they ought to furnish irrefragable proof\nof spiritistic origin. However full the report, the imagination of a\nsubsequent critic will see in the omission to state some particular\nprecaution endless sources of error, which actual observers will never\ntheless know not to have been present. As a reviewer, I am indeed\n\fXL1X.] 495\nReview.\ngrateful to M. Maxwell for his abstention from any such portentous\nundertaking, for his book might, as literature, have become absolutely\nunreadable; as a critic, I cannot but express a regret that he has\nnot, in at least one or two cases, given us specimens of the exact\norder and circumstances of his experiments. As he has not done\nthis, I am spared the task of attempting to criticise the experiments\nthemselves, in the manner in which Dr. Hodgson so laboriously\ncriticised Dr. Oliver Lodge's report of the Eusapia sittings at the\nHe Roubaud. The value of the experiments must depend wholly\non the estimate which each reader will form of the capacity of the\nobserver. It is, however, fair to ask objectors who will refuse even\nto consider (I do not say be convinced by) evidence such as this,\nwhat would be their attitude if confronted by a procis-verbal of such\nelaborate completeness as to be found proof against even the most\ningenious criticism, a proces-verbal which, if true, must inevitably\nestablish the existence of some hitherto unrecognised force of a\nsupernatural character. I think that, if candid, 99 out of 100 such\ncritics would admit that they would say that the procte-verbal was\nprobably not true, while the remaining one would put it from his\nmind and forget about it as soon as possible. M. Maxwell, there\nfore, will probably not lose many converts by his failure to provide\na target for the shafts of his opponents. Let me pass, then, to a\nfew of the experiments themselves, and seek to give some account\nof them in, as far as possible, the author's own words.\n(1) Raps (p. 67 and seq.). \"As a rule, raps appear to resound\non the top of a table, but this is not always the case. They are\noften heard on the ground, on the sitters, or on the furniture, walls,\nor ceiling. I have only heard authentic raps on the table, the\nground, the walls, and on furniture in the neighbourhood of the\nmedium ; and I have often heard them outside regular stances. . . .\nI have heard them so frequently in the brightest light that I doubt\nwhether darkness is so favourable to their production as it is to\ncertain other phenomena. . . . Contact of the hands is not necessary\nfor their production. If one has succeeded in obtaining them with\ncontact, one of the surest ways of doing so without contact is to let\nthe hands rest for a certain time on the table, and then to raise\nthem very slowly, palms downwards, and the fingers loosely extended.\nIt is rare that under these conditions the raps do not continue to\nbe heard for at least a certain time. . . . With certain mediums\nthe energy liberated is great enough to act at a distance; and I\nhave heard raps sound on a table about two yards away from the\n2k\n\f49C [part\nHon. Everard Fetiding.\nmedium. With a certain [non-professional] medium I have obtained\nraps in restaurants and in railway refreshment rooms, and it suffices\nto have experienced the raps produced by this medium under the\nconditions indicated to be convinced of their reality. The unusual\nnoise of the raps attracted the attention of persons present, and\ngreatly embarrassed us. The results surpassed our expectations,\nand the more we were confused by the noise of our raps, the more\nwere the latter multiplied, as though they were being produced\nby some teasing creature which was amusing itself at our ex\npense. . . . More rarely I have heard raps produced on stuffs,\neither on the persons of the medium or of sitters, or else on\nfurniture. I have heard them on pieces of paper placed on\nthe seance table, or on books, the walls, tambourines, and small\nwooden objects. . . . The variety in the character of the raps\nis not less than that of the objects on which they sound, . . . and\ntheir tonality varies according to the object. It is easy to distinguish\nbetween raps sounding on wood, paper, and stuff. . . . The sound of\nan ordinary rap, on a table, is rather like that of an electric spark,\n. . . but the type varies greatly, . . . and the sound, instead of\nbeing crisp and short, may be dull, and resemble the impact of some\nsoft body, or the noise made by a mouse, a saw, or the finger-nails\ntapping on wood or scratching a piece of stuff.\" M. Maxwell explains\nthat the raps generally represent themselves by some alphabetical\ncode as proceeding from some particular intelligence or personification,\nand each personification manifests itself by a special type of rap.\n\" Sometimes different raps will reply to one another, and one of the\nmost interesting experiences that one can have is to hear these raps,\nclear, dull, dry, or soft, sounding simultaneously on the table and\nthe floor, and on the wood or stuff or furniture respectively.\"\nM. Maxwell, as the result of a close study of this curious pheno\nmenon, hazards certain conclusions, of which he says the most certain\nis the close connection of the raps with muscular movements on the\npart of the sitters. Every muscular movement, even a slight one,\nappears to be followed by a rap. Thus if, without any one neces\nsarily touching the table, one of the sitters frees his hand from the\nchain made round the table by the others, moves it about in a\ncircle over the surface of the table, then raises it in the centre and\nbrings it down towards the table, stopping suddenly within a few\ninches of it, a rap will be produced on the table corresponding with\nthe sudden stoppage of the hand. Similarly, a rap will be produced\nby a pressure of the foot on the floor, by speaking, by blowing\n\fXLIX.] 497\nReview.\nslightly, or by touching the medium or one of the sitters. Raps\nproduced in this way by the sitters are often stronger than those\nproduced by the medium himself. M. Maxwell suggests as a working\nhypothesis that there is a certain accumulated force, and that if its\nequilibrium be suddenly disturbed by the addition of the excess of\nenergy required for the movement, a discharge takes place producing\nthe effect. I confess it produces a somewhat bizarre impression on\nthe mind to read M. Maxwell's precise instructions concerning phe\nnomena the very existence of which is to most of us so obscure or\nwhich, if described by any one less apparently well equipped than\nthe author for making accurate observations, one would dismiss with\nthe ruck of occult twaddle with which our experience is so abun\ndantly blighted. Yet M. Maxwell writes with a full knowledge of\nthe fraud to be encountered, and describes in detail the various\nmethods by which the alleged phenomena may be imitated, many of\nwhich have come under his own observation. And when he writes\nthat the facts for which he claims attention took place under conditions\nwhen such methods were inapplicable, that it is impossible to imitate\nexactly raps produced without contact on the table, that the raps are\neasily localised and their vibrations perceptible by auscultation of the\ntable itself, it is not too much to ask that judgment may at least\nbe held suspended as to the validity of his conclusions.\n(2) Movements of objects without contact, or with such contact\nonly as would be normally insufficient to produce the results\nobtained. These again are to be numbered among the phenomena\nas to the occurrence of which M. Maxwell claims to have reached\nabsolute conviction. And it is in his account of these, given for\nthe most part in merely general terms, that a reader, anxious for\nmaterial to enable him to form a standard of criticism with which\nto test the value of the author's observations, will find chief cause\nfor disappointment. Here is a sample (p. 86) of the more than\nairy way in which M. Maxwell relates the occurrence of these\nportentous events. The case in question is one of a series of\nexperiments made with Eusapia Paladino. \" It was about five\no'clock in the evening, and there was broad daylight in the\ndrawing-room at l'Agu\u00e9las. We were standing around the table.\nEusapia took the hand of one of our number and rested it on\nthe right-hand corner of the table. The table was raised to the\nlevel of our foreheads, that is, the top reached a height of at least\n4| feet from the floor. ... It was impossible for Eusapia to\nhave lifted the table by normal means. One has but to consider\n\f498 [part\nHon. Everard Feilding.\nthat she touched only the corner of the table to realise what the\nweight must have been had she accomplished the feat by muscular\neffort. Further, she never had sufficient hold of it. It was clearly\nimpossible for her, under the conditions of the experiment, to have\nused any of the means suggested by her critics, straps, or hooks\nof some kind.\" I confess, I think M. Maxwell might advan\ntageously have given such critics a little more opportunity of\nappreciating exactly what these conditions amounted to. The effect,\ntherefore, of this portion of his book is mainly cumulative, and\nindependent of the importance to be attached to any one of the\nreported occurrences. The author speaks of many instances of\nmovements of objects without any contact whatever occurring in\nbroad daylight, of curtains shaken, tables lifted, moving to and fro\nalong the floor at command, chairs sliding, etc. Perhaps one of\nthe most interesting cases is the following (p. 93). M. Maxwell\nwished to repeat a particular experiment, the successful perform\nance of which elsewhere had been notified to him (see Annales des\nSciences PsycMques, 1896, p. 50). This consisted of the depression,\nwithout contact, of the scale of a letter balance. M. Maxwell\npurchased a letter balance and took it from its box just prior to\nthe experiment. There was sufficient light to enable him to read\nthe indistinctly marked divisions of the scale. \" Before our eyes,\nEusapia repeatedly made it go down by raising and lowering her\nhands, palms downwards. Her hands were from 10 to 15 cen\ntimetres [nearly 4 to 6 inches] from the plate of the letter\nbalance, and the movements were made without her relinquishing\nthe hands of her neighbours to right and left. It must be\nnoticed that we several times obtained the depression of the plate\nof the machine while we varied the position of the medium's hands,\nplacing them in front of the machine so as to form a triangle, of\nwhich the plate was the apex, and bringing the hands together so\nthat the angle at the apex became very acute. The object of\nthis procedure was to obviate the possibility of the medium pro\nducing the effect by means, for example, of a hair between her\nhands. And in order to make my account complete, I must add\nthat a hair would have been visible. By reversing her hands,\nso that the palms were upwards, the medium also raised the\nplate, on which a pocket-book had been placed. We ascertained\nby measuring the oscillation of the index needle, that the force\ndeveloped sent it sometimes to the limit of its run, and that it\nwas therefore greater than 90 grammes [3\u00a3 ounces].\"\n\fXLIX.] 499\nReview.\nIt was through the mediumahip of Eusapia Paladino that M.\nMaxwell obtained the majority of the phenomena of the kind\nunder consideration. He was a member of a committee which met\nin 1896 to investigate this medium, immediately after the series\nheld in Cambridge under the auspices of this Society, the issue of\nwhich, it will be remembered, was absolutely unfavourable to her\nclaims. The general results of the Cambridge seances were com\nmunicated to the French Committee, who were therefore made\naware of the fraudulent devices which the Cambridge investigators\nclaimed to have ascertained. Their report will be found in the\nAnnales des Sciences Psychiques for 1896, and I recommend all who\nbelieve that Dr. Hodgson and his Cambridge colleagues have had\nthe last word in the controversy concerning the genuineness of\nEusapia's mediumship to read it. The French investigators arrive\nat conclusions in direct conflict with those of the English sitters.\nThey state that they had long been aware of the tricks 'dis\ncovered ' at Cambridge, and took adequate means to guard against\nthem, and M. Maxwell devotes a considerable portion of his book\nto an indictment of the Cambridge method of controlling the\nmedium, which consisted, for part of the time at least, in affording\nthe medium opportunities to cheat with a view to ascertaining\nwhether she would avail herself of them,1 a complaisance of\nwhich she took the fullest advantage. Against this method M.\nMaxwell protests with much vigour. A medium, especially an un\neducated medium, does not distinguish, with the scientific precision\nof her investigators, between normal and abnormal methods of\nproducing some given phenomenon. The exercise of abnormal\npower is always, ex hypothesi, harder or less certain than that of\nnormal power. Hence, supposing the problem set is to move a\ntable, and it is open to her to move it either by abnormal agency\nor by means of her toe, she will inevitably choose the toe. The\nuse of the latter does not of itself demonstrate the non-existence\nof the former. The true method of investigation is first to ascer\ntain all possible normal agencies, and then to take steps to eliminate\nthem, pointing out frankly to the medium the while that they are\nvalueless. For my own part, I am not disposed to challenge the\nsoundness of M. Maxwell's contention, and trust that a further\nopportunity may present itself to English investigators to check his\nconclusions with regard to this medium on the lines he has indicated.\nThere is much else of interest in the book upon which I should\n1See Editorial Note ou p. 501.\n\f500 Hon. Everard Feilding. [part\nhave liked to touch, but I have already trespassed far beyond the\nspace allotted to me. One word, in conclusion, on M. Maxwell's\nown attitude towards the phenomena of which he writes. It is\ncertain that while spiritists may congratulate themselves on his\ntestimony in support of the facts on the reality of which they\nbase their creed, they will find but little direct encouragement from\nhim for the theory of spiritistic agency by which they account for\nthese facts. \"I believe,\" he says (p. 13) \"in the reality of certain\nphenomena, of which I have repeatedly been a witness. I do not\nconsider it necessary to attribute them to a supernatural inter\nvention of any kind, but am disposed to think that they are\nproduced by some force existing within ourselves.\"\nIn the same way as certain psychical phenomena, such as auto\nmatic writing, trance \" controls,\" crystal vision, and so forth, in\nwhich an intelligence seems to be present independent of the\nintelligence of the medium, can be shown beyond dispute to be\nmerely manifestations of his subliminal intelligence, frequently taking\nthe form of a dramatic personification ; so may the agency, revealing\nitself in raps, movements of objects, and other phenomena of a\nphysical character, perhaps be traceable, not to any power external\nto the medium and the sitters, but merely to a force latent within\nthemselves, and may be but an exteriorisation in a dynamic form,\nin a way not yet ascertained, of their collective subliminal capacities.\nFanciful as this theory may seem to those who feel that\nunconsciousness of such capacity is sufficient warrant of its non\nexistence, M. Maxwell (p. 100 et seq.) cites several observations\nin its support. The apparent suggestibility of the personification\nand the frequency with which the activity of the dynamic agency\nmay be determined by movements on the part of the assistants,\nwhether by an appropriate action of the hand, a contraction of some\nmuscle, a sudden exhalation, or perhaps a mere word,\u2014these seem\nto point to a closer connection between the operative force and the\npersonality of the sitters than would be expected were the agency\ndue to a source external to themselves. These observations are o\nthe highest interest, and though they have some of them been\nmade before, at least in the case of Eusapia Paladino\u2014as where,\nfor example, it has been noticed that a movement, without apparent\ncontact, of a table has been accompanied by synchronous con\ntortions of the medium\u2014it has been merely with the view of\nestablishing fraud or the employment of some invisible contrivance\nwhereby the movement was effected. M. Maxwell is continuing\n\fXLIX.] 501\nReview.\nhis investigations : let us hope that in his account of them he\nwill furnish us with the means of determining which of the com\npeting explanations is the true one. Meanwhile, his present\ncontribution is of much importance, and merits the closest atten\ntion of all who are interested in the subject.\neverard feilding.\nNote.\nM. Maxwell appears to be under a misapprehension as to the\nmethods of investigation adopted at the Cambridge sittings with\nEusapia Paladino. When she first came to Cambridge, a number\nof plans were suggested for making the control of the experiments\nas satisfactory as possible, e.g., the use of netting, either for con\nfining the medium or separating her from objects which it was\nhoped might be moved without contact ; various methods of tying\nher; and, above all, sufficient light in the seance room. She\nrefused to submit to any of these conditions. The investigators,\nhowever, long persevered in making the control in every case as\ncomplete as she would allow it to be. They pressed her at each\nsitting to allow some light in the room, and a very faint light was\ngenerally permitted at the beginning ; but soon she would insist\non complete darkness, and the touches were never felt until after\nthe light was completely extinguished.\nThe only method of control then allowed was the holding of\nthe medium by the sitters, and they were accustomed to hold\nher as firmly and continuously as possible. When she resisted this\nevery kind of persuasion short of actual physical force was em\nployed to induce her to submit to it. It was not until the sitters\nwere convinced of the constant fraud practised that their efforts\nwere relaxed, and she was allowed to take her own way without\nremonstrance.1 Editor.\nHumanism: Philosophical Essays. By F. C. S. Schiller. (London:\nMacmillan and Co. 1903.)\nA metaphysical discussion in these pages would be an offence\ndevoid alike of precedent and of justification. Unable here to join\nissue with Mr. Schiller on the details of his invigorating manifesto,\nI must content myself with drawing the reader's attention to the\nmain principles of the new empiricism which the eternal unfitness\n1 See letter from Mr. Myers in the Journal S.P.R., November, 1895 (V'oL\nVII., p. 164).\n\f502 [part\nF. iV. Hales.\nof things has called into life in the very home and stronghold of\nAbsolutism. Oxford, which, in the heyday of John Mill's influence\nand popularity, led the attack upon the Sensationalism of Locke\nand Hume, appears to be reverting, with all the ebullient ardour\nand combative enthusiasm characteristic of that ancient seat of\nlearning, to the very principles which Green and his more brilliant\nsuccessors flattered themselves they had for ever discredited. Yet\nthe new empiricism is by no means identical with the old. The\nsupposed \"devotion of the philosopher to the memory of ancient\nerrors,\" prevents him at least from repeating obsolete mistakes\nin discredited terms. Professor William James\u2014the real author of\nthe new doctrine\u2014has baptised it Pragmatism. Mr. Schiller prefers\nto label it Humanism, as at once a more general and a more attractive\ntitle.\nSome months ago, a volume of essays by members of an Oxford\nphilosophical club opened the campaign against the prevalent Oxonian\nphilosophy of the Absolute. The enterprise, more novel at Oxford\nthan elsewhere, attracted and deserved the attention of the limited\npublic to which it appealed. Mr. Schiller, himself the contributor\nof a noteworthy chapter on \"Axioms as Postulates,\" formulated\n(rather than proved) a thesis which, if capable of demonstration,\nwould revolutionise the Theory of Knowledge. In the present volume\nhe has brought together a number of essays, collected for the most\npart from sources hardly accessible to the general public, which\nexplain and develop, for the benefit of the non-technical reader,\ndifferent aspects of his fundamental doctrine. Humanism is not a\nconnected treatise. The argument does not claim to be exhaustive.\nThere are gaps in the exposition which the critic would like to see\nsupplied, and which the author, as I understand, would gladly supply\nif he could find the leisure. His Humanism aims to be humane ;\nand in his sedulous avoidance of scholastic jargon, he has been tempted\nto smoothe over difficulties none the less imperative for being scholastic.\nThe book must be regarded as a programme rather than as a proof.\nBut it is addressed to a popular audience, and as such it must be\njudged. Vigorous in style, uncompromising in statement, it affords,\nif not a vindication of the pragmatist's position, at least a lively\nreflection of the true-born pragmatist's character.\nAll philosophies necessarily start from human experience, and\nreconstruct it in various ways. Sensationalism overlooked pure\nthought. A priorism has overlooked everything but pure thought.\nThe pragmatist's claim is that he accepts all features of experience\n\fXLIX.] 503\nReview.\nwithout distorting any, and takes into account the whole of the\nconcrete nature of man. He recognises the reality and validity of\nthe thought-process which interprets and welds into a systematic\nwhole the data of sense, but he claims that the thought-process is\npurposive in character and teleological in its methods. \"Pure\"\nthought for him is a \"non-existent and impossible process.\" Con\ndemning the aloofness of an \"abstract, arid, abstruse, and\nabhorrent philosophy\" from the world of action, he reverts to the\nold doctrine of Protagoras that \"man is the measure of all things,\"\nand seeks to co-ordinate the plain man's practical beliefs. Logic has\nindeed for him a perfectly valid function. A syllogistic chain is\nnone the less cogent because it appears to conflict with some vital\nhuman interest. But the ultimate principles which form the basis\nof all reasoning, according to Mr. Schiller's doctrine in his earlier\nessay, are neither logically proved nor amenable to proof. They are\npostulates ; they are matters of faith. In all knowledge faith and\nreason are indivisibly implied : Faith in the postulates which underlie\nall reasoning, and which we have chosen to believe without proof ;\nReason which moulds ideas into conformity with these postulates.\n\" In principle,\" says Mr. Schiller, \" Pragmatism overcomes the old\nantithesis between Faith and Reason.\" The whole of our thought,\naccording to Pragmatism, is controlled and inspired by practical\ninterests, although we may frequently \" fail to detect the hidden\ninterest which incites the reason to be dispassionate.\" Instead, there\nfore, of seeking to base Ethics upon Metaphysical results, regulating\npractice in accordance with principles derived from the exercise of\npure thought, Pragmatism founds Metaphysics upon Ethics, thought\nupon the practical needs which incite to action. To commence the\nexposition of a system of philosophy, as Mr. Schiller does, with a\nchapter on the Ethical Basis of Metaphysics may, in fact, prove to\nbe the intolerable paradox it seems. Yet it is a paradox by the\ntruth or falsity of which the whole pragmatist doctrine is bound to\nstand or fall.\nInto the examination of this doctrine on its general merits I do\nnot propose to enter. I \u2022 must confine myself to noticing some con\nclusions Mr. Schiller, with most creditable consistency, is driven into\nin the chapters which may be supposed to interest more particularly\nreaders of these Proceedings. Chapter XIII., on the Desire for\nImmortality, is a reprint of the well-known article in which Mr.\nSchiller questioned the assumed general desire for personal immor\ntality, and initiated a very important enquiry, since then concluded,\n\f504 [part\nF. N. Hale*.\ninto the actual state of human sentiment with regard to a future\nlife. Of Chapter XV.,1 on Philosophy and the Scientific Investigation\nof a Future Life, I need say little beyond reminding our readers of\nthe main points of the argument : that neither philosophy nor science\ncan effectually disprove the possibility of a future life, that its nature\ncan only be investigated by scientific methods ; that no investigation,\nand consequently no definite knowledge about it whatever is possible,\nunless the hypothetical future life happens to be in some sense con\ntinuous with the present form of consciousness, and in important\nrespects akin to our present existence.\nIt is in Chapter XIY. that the fundamental paradox of Pragmatism\ncomes to light in a particularly glaring fashion, and challenges dis\ncussion in these pages. Mr. Schiller argues first that Immortality is\nan ethical postulate, and from the irresistibility of the postulate he\ninfers the reality of the thing postulated. I do not in the least wish\nto question the first step in the argument, essentially open to question\nthough I believe it to be. If the first step in the argument is\nillegitimate, the supposed proof of the conclusion vanishes into thin\nair. But even if we grant the legitimacy of a doubtful postulate,\nthe argument is surely vitiated by a new form of a very ancient\nfallacy. The plain man is painfully aware of the difference between\nthe 100 dollars he would like to have in his wallet and the actual\ndollars which too often are not there. Admit that theoretical con\nstruction, the whole universe of organised knowledge, is controlled\nthrough and through by practical needs, articulated by postulates\nwhich we will to believe, and it may still be quite possible to co\nordinate at every moment the particulars of our present, our past,\nand our future experience (to some extent), for our possible future\nexperience is in some sense predetermined by that which is present\nand actual. But Pragmatism does not, on the one hand, seem to\nafford any means of transcending actual experience, nor of setting\nany limits to the variations in the postulates which we may find\nit convenient to make ; and on the other hand it seems plain that\nthe hypothetical future life can no more enter into our actual experi\nence than Mr. Schiller's experience of the cogency of his argument\nenters into my actual experience.
