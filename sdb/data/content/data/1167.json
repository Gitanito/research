S I B L Y.\nT Q\n\fTO THE\nR E A D E R.\nTHERE is nothing by which man ever\narrived at a more perfe\u00f3t knowledge of\nthe \u017fecrets of nature, than by the immediate\neffe\u00f3t of all things, that is the experience\nwhich the under\u017ftanding di\u017fcovers to us; for\nfrom the\u017fe, it is evident, that they who fir\u017ft\ndirected their \u017ftudies to philo\u017fophy, have\nopened a way to di\u017fcover \u017fecrets replete with\nwonder.\nAnd indeed rea\u017fon, for its excellence, is\nbetter than example; as is the immortal \u017foul,\nwho\u017fe work it is, than that of corporeal \u017fen\u017fe:\nyet,\n\f& T O T H E R E A D E R.\nyet, in a con\u017fequential order, this has the\nprecedence, and is, as it were, the door and\nway to that under\u017ftanding, to which there is\nnot the lea\u017ft acce\u017fs, unle\u017fs tran\u017fmitted through\ntho\u017fe \u017fen\u017fes. Further, whatever, by the light\nof rea\u017fon, man's comprehen\u017fion, or invention,\nmay be of the powers of the \u017ftars and their\nmanner of influencing the inferior elementary\nand compound bodies, beginning from the\nchief principies and cau\u017fe, properties, pa\u017f\n\u017fions, motions, and other active qualities, if\nexperience does not make it plain, is ju\u017ftly\nand de\u017fervedly condemned and reje\u0107ted as\nfal\u017fe; for rea\u017fon always is my guide in every\none of them, From the actions of the mo\u017ft\neminent men in phy\u017fic and mathematics, I have\n\u017fufficiently enlarged el\u017fewhere; and thence, by\nway of theory, I have transferred hither a\nfew the\u017fes the mo\u017ft conci\u017fe. But as there\nare \u017fome who refu\u017fe to follow rea\u017fon and the\nmo\u017ft enlightened authors for their guides, I\nwas unwilling to make any di\u017ftin\u00e9tion be\ntween this part of philo\u017fophy and experi\nence; that they who will li\u017ften to rea\u017fon and\nthe under\u017ftanding, might, by the help of the\n\u017fen\u017fes,\n\fT O T H E R E A D E R. 9\n\u017fen\u017fes, and, to u\u017fe the expre\u017f\u017fion, with their\nhands, attain to and comprehend the method\nI have taken : for which rea\u017fon, it \u017feemed\ngood to me in this place to \u017fubjoin thirty\nNativities of the mo\u017ft famous men, truly wor\nthy of admiration; and that no one might\ncondemn them, either as fal\u017fe or \u017felected, in\npreference to any ca\u017fually taken to \u017fuit my\npurpo\u017fe, I have extra\u0107ted them from the mo\u017ft\napproved authors, and \u017fuch only, wherein not\nthe horo\u017fcope, which may, with a \u017fmall varia\ntion of time, be very ea\u017fily adapted to the\na\u017fpects of the \u017ftars, but the luminaries become\nthe moderators of life; which, as they always\ncontinue in the \u017fame place in the zodiac, not\nwith\u017ftanding the times of the nativities are\nremote, i thought proper to di\u017fpo\u017fe the\u017fe with\nthe calculations of the a\u017fpe\u010dts and dire\u00e9tion,\nin the order they might be\u017ft \u017fuit.\nNow then, my very courteous reader, if\nyou look for any virtue, or true and na\ntural wi\u017fdom from the \u017ftars, the\u017fe examples\ngiven, whenever from the natural effects con\ntained in them, you find any calculations for\nB directions\n\fro T O T H E R E A D E R.\ndire\u00e9tions more agreeable to time and nature,\nbe \u017fo kind as to publi\u017fh and point out my er\n\u2018rors; by \u017fo doing, you will oblige me greatly,\nas in every thing I de\u017fire nothing but plain\nand \u017fimple truth; but if, after all, you can\nnot find any, confe\u017fs ingenuou\u017fly, that my\nopinion concerning this heavenly \u017fcience is\nright, and my way of calculating true, the\nmethod univer\u017fal, and he\u017fitate no longer in\nconfirming it is \u017fo. But in the\u017fe examples,\nvery great care is to be ob\u017ferved : Fir\u017ft,\nThat the luminaries pre\u017fide over things \u017fub\nje\u0107ted, not only by that one motion of the\ndirection, which above the zodiac is made\nagreeable to the \u017fucce\u017f\u017fion of the \u017figns, accord\ning to the method u\u017fually followed by all\nprofe\u017f\u017fors, but by both, viz. the right and\nconver\u017fe.\n2. That the \u017fame a\u017fpect and method of\ncalculating may be found in more of the like,\nwhen alledged as proofs, is the greate\u017ft evi\ndence of the truth of the matter; for it might\nbe argued, that one example would perhaps\nonly agree. .\n3. That\n\fT. O. T H E R E A D E. R. I r\n3. That my dire\u00e9tions are adapted to the\nnature of things; as, for example, I do not\ntake the dignities from the horo\u017fcope, but,\nfrom the Sun and medium cali, according to\nPtolemy and others.\n4. I have not taken remarkable effe\u010dts\nfrom the fixed \u017ftars, as many do, and truly\nwithout foundation, but from the erratics;\nthough the \u017ftars fixed, \u017fpecify and afford \u017fome\nlittle a\u017f\u017fi\u017ftance to the power of the erratics.\n5. In all the\u017fe examples, the proportion I\nhave found of the arc of direction corre\u017fponds\nwith the years of an age.\n6. I have not varied the time of the nativi\nties to make the calculations of the dire\u00e9tions\nagree ; but if in any example I have made a\nlittle alteration, it is very \u017fmall, and \u017fcarce\nmakes any difference on the arc of direction\nof the luminaries, whether dire\u00e9t or conver\u017fe,\nexcept only in the mundane parallels. How\never, from this \u017fmall alteration, it may be in\nferred, that either on that account the time is\nreduced to a true one, or, at lea\u017ft, that the di\nB 2 re\u010dtions\n\f+2. T O T H E R E A D E. R.\nre\u0107tions of the parallels in the world were\nnot far di\u017ftant, and might, notwith\u017ftanding,\nhave been of very good u\u017fe, though there\nwere no change of time in the nativity; for\nevery dire\u00e9tion cau\u017fes an alteration in bodies;\nbut the full effe\u010dt plainly appears, by means\nof the powerful directions which arrive fir\u017ft,\nand the \u017fub\u017fequent a\u017f\u017fi\u017ft more or le\u017fs, ac\ncording as the proximity of the application\nor virtual influx is greater or le\u017fs: but no\ncredit is to be given to the time of tho\u017fe na\ntivities, in which authors have adopted the\nhoro\u017fcope for the giver of life, where the\nluminaries, &c. ought to have been tak\u00f3;\nfor we may rea\u017fonably conclude, that whe\u017fthe\n\u017faid authors have not found their dire\u00e9tions of\nthat luminary to which undoubtedly belonged\nthe power of life, to agree with the effects,\nthey have made a con\u017fiderable alteration in the\nappointed time of the nativity, in order that\nthey might bring down the horo\u017fcope to any\na\u017fpect of the planets. I can affirm what I\nhave \u017faid to be true, for in my youth I \u017faw\n\u017feveral nativities, afterwards publi\u017fhed by the\nauthors, wherein was a vi\u017fible alteration in\n- - - the\n\fTo T H E R E A D E. R. 13\nthe time, and the rea\u017fon why was, that they\nmight an\u017fwer the above end. -\n7. In the\u017fe examples, you will plainly \u017fee,\nthat I have always taken the moderator of\nlife by the rules of Ptolemy: as in the day,\nfir\u017ft, the Sun, if he goes round the aphetic\nplace, then the Moon, &c.; but in the night,\nthe Moon, &c.\n8. You are to ob\u017ferve, that if another lu\nminary, being the \u017fignificator of life, is found\nin nativities with an ho\u017ftile ray in the zo\ndiac, though the application of any malig\nnant planet \u017ftrong in power, the \u017fame is weak,\nfor its virtues are but \u017fmall, as a prorogation\nin the \u017fame zodiac, but \u017ftronger through the\nother motions and a\u017fpe\u0107ts, for then the mo\nderation in the zodiac \u017feems in a manner \u017fe\nparated; and in the \u017fame manner ought we to\nrea\u017fon in the other motions; for if, la\u017ftly,\naccording to all motions, and every \u017fpecies\nof a\u017fpe\u0107t, the \u017fignificator of life is a\u017fpected\nby the rays of the unfortunate planets, the\nnative, according to Ptolemy, will not fur\nvive, e\u017fpecially if the fortunate afford no\n- a\u017f\u017fi\u017ftance,\n\f14 To T H E R E A D E R.\na\u017f\u017fi\u017ftance, &c, yet each dire\u010dtion mu\u017ft always\nbe con\u017fulted and calculated, agreeably to the\ntwo kinds of a\u017fpects.\n9. You may know that tho\u017fe nativities are\n\u017ftronger, when another luminary becomes\nthe \u017fignificator, by means of the duplicate\nmotion of the prorogation, which does not\nhappen when the horo\u017fcope of the country is\nthe giver of life, for it only performs in a\nright motion, and not conver\u017fe.\nIo. You are to ob\u017ferve, what is generally\nalledged by profe\u017f\u017fors, re\u017fpe&ting the lumi\nnary, in\u017ftead of the dignities of the \u017fatellites,\nviz. that the \u017fatellites of a planet come within\n30\u00b0 of the proximity found on either \u017fide to\nwards the luminaries; but a \u017fatellite is no\nthing but a kind of a\u017fpect of the \u017ftars to the\nluminaries of what kind \u017foever, which, if it\nbe made by application, its power extends\ninwardly over the whole orb of light of the\na\u017fpecting planet, , and the more \u017fo, as the\nproximity is greater, but by \u017feparation it is\nnot \u017fo. This do\u0107trine may be \u017feen in \u017feveral\nchapters of Ptolemy; for an a\u017fpecting \u017ftar in\n* - - fluences\n\fTo T H E R E A D E. R. is\nfluences the \u017fignificator, and di\u017fpo\u017fes him to\nproduce effects co-natural to him, by a \u017fub\n\u017fequent direction. But a \u017ftar of no a\u017fpect\ndoes not predi\u017fpo\u017fe the fignificator, and pro\nduces very little or no effect of its nature by a\n\u017fub\u017fequent direction; this is the true do\u0107trine\nof the \u017ftars. - . . .\nI 1. That in the\u017fe examples, as to the time\nof death, I have ob\u017ferved the mo\u017ft powerful\ndire\u010dtions of them all, and afterwards I give\na rea\u017fon why the antecedents that are pa\u017ft are\nnot anaretical, from which it is evident, that\nthe directions whereof I now give the calcu\nlations were the true anaretic cau\u017fes.\n12. There is no truth in what \u017fome \u017fay,\nviz. that as I invented the mundane a\u017fpects,\nit is no wonder if any a\u017fpect may agree with\nthe times of the effects in tho\u017fe examples, as\nwell among the \u017ftars as to the angles; but\nI afterwards rejected the a\u017fpects in the zodiac,\nand all the ante\u017fcions to the angles al\u017fo. I do\nnot direct the fignificators to the cu\u017fps of the\nhou\u017fes, nor to the 2, 3, or to the fixed \u017ftars,\nas having of them\u017felves a power to kill. I\ndo\n\f16 To T H E R E A D E R.\ndo not dire\u00e9t the planets h, \u0131, 3, 7, 8, as if\nthey were \u017fignificators, which is the practice\nof \u017feveral profe\u017f\u017fors. Maginus has fully de\n\u017fcribed the rays in the equator; others, be\nfides the rays, which the ingenious Kepler\nthought to be efficacious, add the \u017femi-\u017fex\ntile and \u017fe\u017fqui-quadrate. Wherefore, if you\ncarefully ob\u017ferve, you will doubtle\u017fs perceive\nI have produced le\u017fs a\u017fpects than other\nauthors. -\n13. If you are de\u017firous to \u017fee of what im\nportance the \u017fecondary dire\u00e9tions are to\ndi\u017fcern the particular times of effects, and\nal\u017fo the progre\u017f\u017fions, as I have calculated\nthe ingre\u017f\u017fes and tran\u017fits, both a\u010dtive and pa\u017f\nfive, and the equal proce\u017f\u017fes, according to\nthe u\u017fual and general way, how idle and\nempty in effect they are, I will leave to your\n\u017felf to confider, as I would not \u017fpend time\nto no purpo\u017fe to calculate them.\n14. The revolution, as taught by \u017fome, I\nhave not \u017feen, though in reality they may\npo\u017f\u017fe\u017fs \u017fome virtue, but only according to the\ncon\u017ftitution of the \u017ftars to the places of the\nprorogator\n\fT O T H E R E A D E R. t!\nprorogator of the nativity, &c. their places of\ndire\u00e9tion, but no farther, as Ptolemy was of\nopinion, and briefly expre\u017f\u017fes him\u017felf in his\nChapter of Life. Tho\u017fe who are affli\u0107ted\nboth in the places and conclu\u017fions of the years,\nby the revolution of the \u017ftars infe\u00f3ting the\nprincipal places, have rea\u017fon to expect a cer\ntain death; therefore, let any one, if he\nplea\u017fes, ob\u017ferve the return of the years, but\nat the \u017fame time, let him not place \u017fo great\na value on them, as \u017fome authors u\u017fually do;\nwho, from the con\u017ftitution of the \u017ftars, judge\nof the Sun's return in the \u017fame manner as of the\nnativity; \u017fo that they are not afraid to di\u017f\u017fent\nfrom the \u017fame, nor even in that from the\ndire\u00e9tions.\n15. And note, that when I \u017fpeak of dig\nnities and promotions, I am to be under\u017ftood\nin a natural way, as I have made mention\nel\u017fewhere, in \u017fuch a manner, that men may\nendeavour to render them\u017felves capable and\nworthy of mental accompli\u017fhments, as well\nas of the other virtues, and not by any means\nthat tho\u017fe who are at liberty to act as they\nplea\u017fe \u017fhould be compelled to, and as it\n- C Were\n\f13 T O T H E R E A D E R.\nwere pu\u017fhed upon, advancement; for I am\nwholly of opinion, that every, man is the\nauthor of his own fortune, next, however, to\nthe divine decree, according to that of the\nprophet, \u201cMy lot is in thine hand.\u201d\nLa\u017ftly, if, in the calculations of the direc\ntions, you find any difference of minutes from\nthe time of the effects; this, however, I am\ncertain, will always be very \u017fmall.

We may make a calculation\nof the B \u017feveral ways, but it will be \u017fhorter and\nea\u017fier if, in the diurnal geniture, the O\u2019s true di\u017f\ntance from the Ea\u017ft is added to the D's right a\u017f\ncen\u017fion, and in the no\u0107turnal, \u017fub\u017ftra\u0107ted for the\nnumber thence ari\u017fing, will be the place and the\nright a\u017fcen\u017fion of (P: it always having the \u017fame\ndeclination with the , may be found at any time,\nboth in number and country. Again, let the O\u2019s\noblique a\u017fcen\u017fion, taken in the horo\u017fcope, be \u017fub\n\u017ftra\u0107ted always from the horo\u017fcope's oblique a\u017f\ncen\u017fion, as well in the day as in the night, and the\nremaining difference is to be added to the Y\u2019s\nright a\u017fcen\u017fion, which \u017fum will be the right a\u017f\ncen\u017fion of \u20ac9, which will have the D's declination.\nThere are likewi\u017fe other methods to take the place\nof GB : he who has a mind to make its directions,\nwill accompli\u017fh it only by two motions in the\nworld, that is, to the a\u017fpects in the world; and\nindeed they prove that the conver\u017fions of both the\nluminaries agitates the B by the two motions,\n\u017fince if the luminaries are carried together by the\nmotions of the primum mobile, then the GB re\nmaining immoveable in its horary circle of po\u017fi\ntion,\n\f22, OF THE PART OF FOR TU N E.\n*\ntion, waiting for the coming and rays of the op\npo\u017fite \u017ftars, will be directed by a right motion,\nand the GB will be devolved by a conver\u017fe mo\ntion rapidly to the bodies and rays of the pro\nmi\u017f\u017fories: if the Q be con\u017ftituted immoveable, and\nthe preceding as u\u017fual, it may very rea\u017fonably\nbe doubted whether the @ in\u017ftitutes the direction's\nconver\u017fe motion; however, I omit \u017fpeaking of\nthis till another time, mean while l will \u017fee what\nexperience \u017fays. This is worth ob\u017ferving, that if\nGB does not con\u017fi\u017ft in the zodiac, it is neverthele\u017fs\ndire\u010dted to the parallels of the \u017ftars in the primum\nmobile, together with the D, who\u017fe declination it is\nknown to follow, and which they vary continually\nand \u017fucce\u017f\u017fively in an equal motion; therefore,\nwhen the D comes to the declination of any \u017ftar,\n\u017fhe produces double effect, according to the proper\n\u017fignification ofevery one portended in thegenitures,\nbecau\u017fe \u017fhe then falls together with (P on the pa\nrallel of the \u017fame \u017ftar: an invention truly ingeni\nous; for as the O, by his motion in the zodiac,\n\u017fucce\u017f\u017fively changes the parallel, and therefore that\nrelative point of his ri\u017fing in the horo\u017fcope, and the\n> , whil\u017ft \u017fhe by a right direction lu\u017ftrates the\nzodiac, and varies the parallels, \u017feems therefore of\ncon\u017fequence to draw to her declination the point\nof exi\u017ftence of G\u00ba.

We commonly\nreckon this nativity among the \u017feven which we have\nextra\u0107ted from Maginus, as examples. To 65\nyears andthree months the native lived, we have\njudged the direction of the b , who is hyleg, ac\ncording to a right motion to the fixed \u017ftar Cor\nLeonis, and parallel to the declination of 3 and\nthe o, but, according to conver\u017fe motion, to their\nta, which dire\u00e9tion ought doubtle\u017fs to be e\u017fteemed\n\u017fufficiently powerful to infer a fatal fickne\u017fs, e\u017fpe\ncially in an old man. Now, after having well con\nfidered the matter, we add that the o, by conver\u017fe\nmotion, found the mundane parallel of h (Ma\nginus takes the E of h to the horo\u017fcope in the\nequator, and Argol, in the \u017fame place, adds the\nanti\u017fcian); the D being the fignificator, having dig\nnity of life, the calculation of the p\u2019s dire\u00e9tion to\nthe fixt \u017ftar of Regulus, and parallel declination of\nthe o and 3, is as follows: The p\u2019s declination\n23\u00b0 54, a\u017fcen\u017fional difference 24\u00b0 26', \u017femi-diurnal\narc I 14\u00b0 26, the third part of which is 38\u00b09', the\nP - - pol\u00ba.\n\f314 R E M A R K A B L E N AT IV.
