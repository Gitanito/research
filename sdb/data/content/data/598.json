ARTHUR SMITH.\nA few days ago I took from my bookshelves, not for a first\nor second perusal, that delightful little volume from the pen\nof Frederic Myers, which has appeared since his death, entitled\nFragments of Prose and Poetry, a work which is doubtless\nknown to many of you. It recalled to my memory many\nillustrious names of those now gone from us, who in the past\ncountenanced and encouraged us in our researches. I need\nnot speak of the well known names of those who have pre-\nceded me in this chair or have otherwise been closely associated\nwith us, such as Henry Sidgwick, Balfour Stewart, Edmund\nGurney, and Dr. Hodgson. But I dare say that there are\nmany of our more recent adherents who are not aware that\n1\nThis Address and the two papers that follow were read at the Private\nMeeting of the Society on November 8th, 1910.\n\f2 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nour roll of membership has included such notabilities (only\nto name a few) as Lord Tennyson, Euskin, Professor Adams,\nRobert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Goodwin (the late Bishop of\nCarlisle), Richard Holt Hutton, Lord Leighton, G. F. Watts,\nProfessor Lombroso, and Mr. Gladstone.\nMy thoughts have been drawn in this direction by the\nfact that, since last we met, our Society has suffered a double\nbereavement, and two other names of distinction have to be\nadded to the honourable list of past supporters. It will have\ncaused no surprise, therefore, to any of you that this meeting\nshould take the form which has been announced of a Memorial.\nOur Society and the cause of Psychical Research generally\nhave suffered incalculable loss by the passing away within\na few days of each other of Professor William James and\nPrank Podmore, names which have been closely connected\nwith our work since its commencement, and will surely always\nbe remembered in the same connexion as long as this work\ncontinues. This being so, it will, I think be recognised by\nall as obviously appropriate that we should devote our after-\nnoon to a commemoration of services so long continued and\nof such inestimable value.\nThe Society is fortunate that the task has been undertaken\nby such competent judges as Mrs. Sidgwick and Mr. M'Dougall,\nneither of whom needs any introduction by me. Under these\ncircumstances I may confine myself to a few brief comments\nby way of introduction to the subject, one on which, as your\nPresident for the time being, I should certainly not like to\nbe silent.\nAs you all know, Professor James was one of the most\ndistinguished of our Presidents, and for many years devoted\nmuch of his strenuous life to the inquiries with which we\nare concerned. Of his general work in the field of philosophy\nI feel that I am not competent to speak to any purpose.\nJustice can only be done to a thinker so original and so\nprofound by one who has pursued the study of psychology\nmuch more closely than I have been able to do ; and this\nadvantage we have this afternoon. As President, however, I\nwish at this, the very first opportunity, to acknowledge the\nimmense service he rendered to our Society in its early days\nby so intimately associating his great name with our researches.\n\fLXII.] Gommemorative Address. 3\nI have seen it somewhere stated that whereas his brother\nHenry James has written fiction in the spirit of a philosopher,\nWilliam James wrote philosophy with all the grace of a\nnovelist. We have been fortunate indeed in having had for\nso many years the countenance and co-operation of a genius\nwhich may perhaps without exaggeration be described as unique.\nMr. Podinore was personally known by most of us. Of\nthe tragic circumstances of his sudden, and as it would seem,\nuntimely death, I need not speak. As a young man, fresh\nfrom a brilliant academic career at Oxford, he identified\nhimself with our work, and he was, I think, for more than\ntwenty-five years a member of our Council. His co-operation\nwith Gurney and Myers in the production of The Phantasms\nof the Living is alone sufficient evidence of the value of\nhis services, and it is evidence also that he had a far more\nopen mind in regard to many of our inquiries than some\nhave supposed. To the last (his most recent publication has\nappeared since his death) Mr. Podmore devoted his exceptional\ngifts, scientific and literary, to the consideration of the various\nmatters which from time to time have attracted our attention.\nHis general attitude towards them is well known to all our\nreaders and need scarcely be enlarged upon. Podmore was\nessentially a critic, in his later years a sceptical critic if you\nwill, and as such must have been prepared to face the\ndisapproval of those whose enthusiasm yearns, impatiently\nperhaps, for definite affirmative answers to the questions\nwhich present themselves. It is easy to understand and in\nsome degree to sympathise with the impatience which has\nsometimes found expression in our meetings at what some\nhave regarded as the excessive caution or even timidity of\nthe critic. But on the other hand, having regard to the\nnovelty and the in many respects peculiar character of our\ninvestigations, I cannot but feel and acknowledge our in-\ndebtedness to one who has so often effectively reminded us\nof the desirability, nay even of the necessity, of making\nhaste slowly. I think I may say with truth and confidence\nthat one of the chief characteristics which has distinguished\nour Society's reports from the conclusions so hastily expressed\nby less cautious inquirers, has been our willingness to give\ndue weight to any and every objection and criticism, to\n\f4 H. Arthur Smith. [part\nconsider with candour and fairness any and every suggested\nexplanation of the phenomena before us, however disappointing\nto more impressionable seekers. In this respect I venture to\nthink that Mr. Podmore's attitude has been of high value\nand deserves a full acknowledgment from those who are left\nto carry on the work which so long and so continuously\noccupied his thoughts. Such tribute, I think, is his due and\nwill be cordially and sympathetically accorded.\nWe are indeed inestimably poorer if we have lost the\nservices of two workers so qualified and so indefatigable as\nJames and Podmore. But have we lost them ? I think that\none of the results of our researches has been to make many\nof us less ready than once we were to apply to the departed\nthe despairing words of George Eliot, to speak of their lives as\n\" Gathered like a scroll within the tomb,\nUnread for ever.\"\nWe are rather encouraged to apply other familiar words of\nthe same writer, albeit in very different sense from that in\nwhich she used them\n:\n\" Oh may I join the choir invisible\nOf those immortal dead who live again.\"\nHave we then lost their services ? We shall see.\n\flxii.] Frank Poclmore and Psychical Research. 5\nII.\nFRANK PODMORE AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.\nBy MRS. HENRY SIDGWICK.\nBy the death of Mr. Frank Poclmore on August 14th, 1901,\nat the age of fifty-four and in the midst of vigorous work, the\nSociety for Psychical Research has lost another of its earliest and\nbest workers. Mr. Poclmore was almost, though not quite, an\noriginal member of the Society ; he was elected to its Council\nin the first year, and served on it for an unbroken period of\ntwenty-seven years. He also, after the death of Mr. Gurney\nin 1888, held, jointly with Mr. Myers, the office of Honorary\nSecretary of the Society for some eight or nine years. Merely\non the administrative side, therefore, he did much for the\nSociety. But he was also from the beginning active in\ninvestigation, and as previous experience, scientific training,\nand critical ability combined with patience and industry to\nmake him a valuable worker, it was natural that he should be\nfound on more than one of the early investigating committees.\nHis experience as a psychical researcher began when he\nwas an undergraduate at Oxford. He had entered the Uni-\nversity with a classical scholarship, and while there obtained\na first-class in Science, so that he must have been an under-\ngraduate of some distinction. Those were days when interest\nin the phenomena of spiritualism had been greatly roused by\nSir William Crookes's investigations and by Mr. Alfred Russel\nWallace's adhesion to the cause. The fame of the medium\nD. D. Home, who had only retired two or three years before,\nwas wide spread, and to those who were admitted behind his\n\f() Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nanonymity the experiences of Mr. W. Stainton Moses were\nvery impressive. With the impetuosity of youth Mr. Pod more\nseems to have become convinced rather rapidly of the genuine-\nness of the alleged facts and of the truth of the doctrines\nof modern spiritualism. In 1875 and 1876 he was a con-\ntributor to a considerable extent to the spiritualistic magazine,\nHuman Nature, and showed already the agreeable ease of\nstyle and power of clear exposition which characterise his\nlater works. In 1876 we find an account by him of a\nseance he had with Slade, the once famous slate-writing\nmedium. It was a very ordinary seance apparently, but in an\naddress to the National Association of Spiritualists in 1880\nhe says of this seance that he remembers writing on the day\nfollowing that it had finally solved his doubts as to the\ntruth of spiritualism. This tendency impulsively to accept\nevidence on the positive side\u2014to welcome it at first sight as\nconvincing\u2014never left him, I think. It was on second\nthoughts that doubts came in.\nWhether any special cause led him in early days to the\nmore sceptical attitude I do not know. It may have been\ndue to the discovery of fraud where he had suspected\nnone, or it may have been merely a reaction from too\nfacile belief that came with larger views. Probably both\ncauses co-operated. It at any rate seems likely that the\nknowledge that he had at one time been too easily con-\nvinced developed in him the very cautious and critical\nspirit he exhibited as a member of our Society. The dis-\nillusionment seems to have been gradual. In 1880 he\naddressed the National Association of Spiritualists as a\nspiritualist, though with \"a voice from Laodicea.\" 1\nAnd though\nhe said that so far from believing in the spiritualistic theory,\nhe could not even say that he believed the most elementary\nfacts which he had witnessed and on which that theory is\nbased, the general trend of the address is rather to maintain\nthat from psychological causes he and others like him cannot\nmaintain their belief\u2014not because they discover the evidence\nto be bad, but because the experiences that for a moment\nconvince fit in so little with the ordinary facts and ex-\n1\nThis was the title of his lecture, see Spiritualist newspaper for March 26,\n1880.\n\flxil] Frank Poclmore and Psychical Research. 7\nperiences of life that the mind instinctively rejects them as\nsoon as the first vivid impression has worn off.\nIt is probable, however, that at the time he gave the address\nhe had already come to the opinion, which he certainly held\nlater, that there was very little, if any, really good evidence\nfor Spiritualism. And what is really interesting about Mr.\nPodmore and what made him so valuable a member of our Society\nwas that he suffered this set-back from a position too hastily\ntaken up without losing his belief in the great importance of\nPsychical Research ; that he remained to the end of his life\nwilling to give the great amount of time and trouble he did\nto the investigation. He was rewarded by some positive con-\nclusions. Of the reality of telepathy between living persons\nhe had no doubt. The address to which I have already\nreferred shows us that he had been convinced of this from a\nvery early date. \"Some six years ago,\" he says in 1880,\n\" when I first believed in Spiritualism, I instituted a few\nexperiments in table-turning with a circle of intimate friends.\nThe results most convincingly proved the possibility, under\ncertain conditions, of mind influencing mind without the ordi-\nnary means of communication.\" From this belief and a\nperception of the great importance of it I have no reason\nto think he ever swerved, and he certainly held it strongly\nduring all the later years of his life. In his last book,\nThe Newer Spiritualism, which he left ready for publication,\nbut which only appeared after his death, he concluded by\nsaying :\n\" If we reject, for the present, at any rate, the explana-\ntion ... of communication from the dead, we must seek for\nsome other cause adequate to the effects. There remains only\nthe agency which has been provisionally named telepathy . . . .\nThe establishment of such a faculty . . . would surely be a\nresult worth all the labour spent. . .\n.\"\nAnd labour on it and on all branches of Psychical\nResearch, as I have already said, he never grudged. From\nbeing an active member of investigating committees of our\nSociety in early days, he became a collaborator with Mr.\nGurney and Mr. Myers in the book Phantasms of the Living,\nwhich was the first great attempt at co-ordinating the fruits\nof the Society's work. Mr. Gurney was, as we know, mainly\nresponsible for the actual writing, as well as for most of the\n\f8 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ntheoretical discussion in the book, but, as is stated in the\npreface, \" the most difficult and important part of the under-\ntaking\u2014the collection, examination, and appraisal of evidence\n\u2014\nhas been throughout a joint labour ; of which Mr. Podmore\nhas borne so large a share that his name could not possibly\nhave been omitted from the title-page.\" This was in 1886,\nand I may point out that his co-operation in this work is\nitself a proof that Ins work was not entirely destructive, as\nsome people seem to think. Later he contributed several im-\nportant studies and many reviews to our Proceedings. The most\nimportant papers are \" Phantasms of the Dead from another\nPoint of View,\" in 1889 (Vol. VI.), \"Poltergeists,\" in 1896\n(Vol. XII.), both of which are based in part on cases he had\nhimself investigated; and \"Discussion of the Trance Phenomena\nof Mrs. Piper,\" in 1898 (Vol. XIV.) All these contain\nimportant evidential discussion, and much of the matter in\nthem, with occasionally some modification of view, has been\nincorporated in the appropriate parts of the books on Psychical\nResearch which he has since published.\n1\nThese books cover nearly the whole range of Psychical\nResearch, and are valuable as giving the results in a popular\nand readable form without sacrifice of exactness of statement.\nIn fact, with a candid and impartial mind and a good\njudgment, a pleasant style and a faculty for clear arrange-\nment and lucid exposition, a wide and thorough knowledge\nof the subjects dealt with, both through historical reading,\npersonal investigation, and careful following of the investiga-\ntions of others, he could not but be an excellent exponent\nas well as a good critic. His Modern Spiritualism is likely, I\nthink, to remain a standard work on the history of that subject.\nBut it is not only in narrative or descriptive writing that he\nis good ; he can also put succinctly and clearly discussions\nof theoretical questions\u2014physiological or psychological \u2014as an\ninstance of which I may mention the chapter on \" Hallucina-\ntion in General \" in Apparitions and Thought-Transference.\nWhat his writings are apt to lack is the quality of inspirit-\n1\nThe books are: Apparitions and Thought- Transference, 1894; Studies in\nPsychical Research, 1897 ; Modern Spiritualism, 1902 ; The Naturalisation of\nthe Supernatural, 1908 ; Mesmerism and Christian Science, 1909 ; The Newer\nSpiritualism, 1910.\n\fLXII.] Frank Podmore and Psychical Research. 9\ningness, if I may coin a word. It is not every one who has\nthe courage and perseverance of Mr. Podmore himself, and the\ncritical attitude he maintains is apt to produce on less vigorous\ninvestigators the effect of a douche of cold water from which\nthey cannot react, and from which therefore they instinctively\nrecoil. I think it is this which has made some members of the\nSociety impatient with him. Not realising how open-minded he\nreally was, and how honest his search for truth, they have\nregarded him as almost in antagonism to advance in a positive\ndirection. This is, I am sure, a great mistake. He would\nhave rejoiced as much as any of us in the attainment of\npositive conclusions, though more cautious than some of us in\naccepting them.\nIn the meanwhile, on the way to these conclusions, there is\nno doubt that Mr. Podmore's critical attitude, combined with\nhis wide and thorough acquaintance with facts and theories,\nactual and historical, concerning the subjects with which the\nSociety deals, was of immense value in our work. Psychical\nEesearch suffers far more, I think, from ignorance than from\ndeliberate opposition ; and it is difficult to say whether most\nharm is done by the ignorantly credulous, who accept appear-\nances too readily at their face value and theorise without\ntaking into account all the facts, or by the ignorantly\nincredulous, who do not take the trouble to find out what it is\nthey are attacking. Ignorant criticism we can get plenty of,\nbut when not harmful it is usually quite useless. What it is\nnot easy to find is a man with unflagging energy in keeping\nhis knowledge up to date, unflagging belief in the importance\nof the investigation, who yet can put himself outside it and\nview it from an impartial, impersonal, and mainly critical\nstandpoint. All real scientific investigators, of course, however\nsanguine and enthusiastic, endeavour to maintain a critical\nattitude ; but there is a distinct advantage, at least in investi-\ngations so difficult and elusive as ours, in having, so to speak, a\nprofessional critic. It is a useful division of labour, and an\ninvestigator of sanguine temperament can more easily let himself\ngo in speculations and hypotheses of a daring kind if he knows\nthat what he says will be closely criticised by a competent, but\ncolder and more cautious colleague, and possible weak points\ndiscovered and exposed for discussion.\n\f10 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThe Society will be fortunate, indeed, if it finds another\ncritic equally friendly, learned, painstaking, and accurate, to\ntake Mr. Podmore's place and put the brake on when there\nare any signs of running too fast. And it will be still more\nfortunate if those who are working for the Society find in their\nnew critic so kindly and unselfseeking a colleague as Frank\nPodmore.\n\fLXII.] In Memory of William James. 1 1\nIII.\nIN MEMORY OF WILLIAM JAMES.\nBy W. M'DOUGALL.\nAt the end of August of this year [1910] the telegraphic cables\ncarried to every part of the civilised world the news of the\ndeath of William James, and in every country many hundreds\nof men and women felt that one of the great lights was gone,\none of the great forces withdrawn. It was no occasion for\nbitter regret ; for James was approaching the usual term of\nman's active life, and, though there had been good reason to\nanticipate further additions to his intellectual output, he had\nalready made a rich and splendid contribution to the thought\nof our age ; he had achieved a world-wide fame and was\nregarded with intense admiration and affection by a host of\nreaders and a large band of personal friends. We had rather\nto be glad in the knowledge that his death was preceded by\nno severely disabling and prolonged malady, and that he\nenjoyed until the last days the active exercise of his great\npowers.\nIt is fitting that at this, the first meeting of the Society\nsince his death, we should record our sense of his services to\nthe Society ; and that we should spend a little time in bringing\nbefore our minds the nature and extent of those services, and\nin making clear to ourselves the attitude towards the work\nand aims of the Society of one whose opinion in regard to\nthat work and those aims was entitled to carry more weight\nthan the opinion of any person now living.\nI could wish that the honour of voicing our tribute to\nWilliam James had fallen to one who could claim old-standing\n\f12 W. M'Dougall. [part\nfriendship with him, one who could give you some intimate\nglimpses of his noble and strenuous character and of the\ngrowth and working of his clear-shining intellect. My own\npersonal acquaintance with James (I hope I may say friend-\nship, for he won my heart at our first meeting) was of few\nyears' standing only. But for nearly twenty years I have been\nan enthusiastic reader of all his works, and for nearly the\nsame period have known him to be the largest influence\naffecting my intellectual life.\nI must, then, be content to try to put together an outline\nsketch of James' work and influence in relation to our Society.\nJames was happy in that his life was in a quite exceptional\ndegree a unified system of activities. Beginning with a\nthorough study of the biological and medical sciences, he\nactively pursued these until near his fortieth year as assistant\nprofessor of physiology at Harvard. He was then appointed\nto a chair of psychology in the same University and devoted\nhimself chiefly to that subject for more than twenty years.\nThe appearance in 1891 of his great book, the Principles of\nPsychologij, secured for him a world-wide reputation as the\ngreatest psychologist of his age, perhaps (as Prof. Dewey has\nlately said) the greatest of any age. From that time onward\nhis productive activity turned more and more towards the\nproblems of general philosophy, and since 1902, when he\nbecame professor of philosophy at Harvard, it was devoted\nalmost wholly to those problems. This may well be regarded\nas an ideal course of intellectual activity : would that all our\nphilosophers could approach their tasks with the same expert\nknowledge of the natural sciences and of psychology\n'\nDuring the period of his philosophic activity James made\nhimself the acknowledged leader of a school of thought (the\npragmatic and radical empiricist school) which, whatever fate\nbe in store for it, has been a most active ferment in the\nphilosophical world ; to it has been largely due that great\nrevival of philosophical activity which marks the opening years\nof the twentieth century.\nJames' active interest in \" Psychical Eesearch,\" which ex-\ntended through the last thirty years of his life, was not some-\nthing apart from and disconnected from the main system of his\nactivity ; rather it was for him an integral part of the whole,\n\fLXII.] In Memory of William James. 13\na part most intimately connected with the rest. It was the\nexpression of the same tendencies of mind which shaped all\nhis philosophical work ; to it he brought, or rather, to it he\nwas brought by, just those peculiar qualities of mind that\nmade him so original and successful in the more strictly\nacademic fields of philosophy and psychology.\nIn any attempt to define these special qualities, the first\nplace must be assigned to his direct vision of, and to bis\nkeen sense of the importance of, the concrete realities of\nhuman life. Always he comes back to empirical realities, to\nthe immediate experience of men in general as the ground\nand test of all theoretical constructions. This was the key-\nnote of all his efforts, of all that was most original in his\npsychology {e.g. his description of the stream of thought with\nwhich the Principles sets out), of his pragmatism, of his\nradical empiricism, of his pluralism, of his epoch-making study\nof the religious consciousness, and of his keen interest in\n\" Psychical Eesearch.\"\nIt was this keen sense of reality which, in spite of his\nlarge tolerance, led him to occasional expressions of impatience\ndirected against what he called vicious intellectualism, and\nagainst the rationalistic construction of theories of the universe\nthat are totally indifferent to the actual nature of the world\nwe know. It was this which forbade him to attempt to\nimpose system and order where none can be discerned, forbade\nhim to aim at constructing a finished picture of the universe,\nand led him to prefer a \" thick \" to a \" thin \" philosophy ;\nmeaning by the \" thin \" highly abstract and purely logical\nprocedures such as those which lead to the conception of the\nAbsolute as the only reality ; and by the \" thick \" a way of\nthinking that involves constant reference to, and faithful regard\nfor, the largest possible mass of empirical fact. \" A large\nacquaintance with particulars,\" he said, \" often makes us wiser\nthan the possession of abstract formulae, however deep.\"\nAnother striking characteristic was his wonderful open-\nmindedness. He was always ready and anxious to find the\npossible grain of truth in every belief, the possible gleam of\ninsight in every human utterance, whether in a philosophical\nsystem of the kind least attractive to him, in the wildest\nassertions of religious exaltation, or in the crude expressions\n\f14 W. M'Dougall. [part\nof less gifted, and especially younger, colleagues. He had the\nkeen eye of the great scientist for the significance of the\nexceptional, the seemingly irregular and unintelligible pheno-\nmenon. I well remember a Fellow of the Eoyal Society saying\nto me :\n\" I'm not interested in anything until I can understand\nit.\" James' attitude was just the opposite of that. He was\nmost interested in whatever was most difficult to understand,\nmost problematic. I venture to say that that is the truly\nscientific attitude characteristic of all great discoverers. The\nsmaller minds are not interested in, they cannot apperceive or\nbecome aware of, phenomena that will not fit into their par-\nticular system of pigeon-holes, and will not wear any one of\ntheir stereotyped labels.\nThis large openness of mind, together with his native\nkindliness, rendered him wonderfully appreciative of the work\nof other men ; also it prevented his thought from crystallising\nin any rigid forms, and allowed his intellect to go on growing\ntill the last. To his generous appreciativeness many a younger\nand obscure colleague in the fields of philosophy and psychology\ncould bear grateful witness. It was finely displayed when,\ntwo years ago, James introduced the ideas of Prof. Bergson to\nan Oxford audience. Instead of regarding his younger and\nless widely famous colleague as a rival to be jealously criticised,\nhe gave a glowingly eulogistic account of his teaching, admitted\nthat it had worked a revolution in his own mind, and ranked\nhimself as a disciple. The same fine trait was strikingly\ndisplayed again in the last published work of his pen,\nthe article on a Pluralistic Mystic in a recent number of the\nHibbert Journal.\nThirdly, it was characteristic of James that he took his\nphilosophy very seriously. For him it was no merely academic\ngame in which each player plays for his own hand, striving\nto devise some system peculiar to himself; rather, in his view,\nthe advance of philosophy was a matter of the greatest\npractical importance for the welfare of mankind. Constantly\nhe had in view human needs and aspirations, human limita-\ntions and human possibilities. In all his writings there is\nmanifested (and more and more clearly if they are considered\nin the order of their production) his earnest wish to come to\nagreement with others, to achieve a view of the world that\n\flxi r. ]\n>>\n>fyh ; \u00a7(zifho>ry \u00b0pf\\ illia,in\\ James. 1\n5\nshall be acceptable to all men ; his strong desire to bring\nincrease of \u2022\n-philosophic\/ undemanding father than merely to\ndevelop and establish - his ' 'o'wn circle of ideas. The same\nearnestness was shewn by the continuance of his strenuous\nactivity after his retirement from his chair at Harvard at\nan age at which he might well have claimed the right to rest\non his laurels.\nIf to these three distinctive qualities of his mind we add\na penetrating and versatile intellect, a strong sense of humour,\nand great powers of expression, we have, I think, the main\npsychological keys to the understanding of his intellectual\nachievements. That the style is the man was eminently true\nof James ; his lively and forcible style, which made everything\nhe wrote a delight to his readers, reveals everywhere the\nqualities we have noted, the keen eye for empirical fact and\nthe faithful acceptance of it as the foundation and test of\nall theoretical constructions and of all beliefs ; the open-\nmindedness ; the interest in and generous appreciation of the\nideas of other men ; the earnest desire to harmonise all human\nknowledge in one continuously advancing body of pragmatic\ntruth.\nSuch in barest outline was the man. Let us now record\nwith gratitude his services to the cause of \" Psychical Research.\"\nMost obvious to the world at large and of inestimable benefit\nto this Society was the fact of his open and active espousal\nof its cause, his lending his name and prestige at a time\nwhen to be a prominent member of the Society was to incur\nrisk of ridicule, or worse. The Society has been fortunate in\ncounting among its members, especially among its presidents\nand vice-presidents, a number of names of the highest intel-\nlectual distinction ;\nbut, with the single exception of that of\nour revered first President, no name probably has been, or\ncould have been, of so much service to the Society as that\nof William James. For his claims to be heard with respect\non all branches of our work were unique. No other man\nof our time has made an equal mark in science, philosophy,\nand religion ; no one has moved with so much mastery in all\nthese three great fields of thought.\nBut James was not content to serve as our figure-head,\nand to lend us moral support and the prestige of his name.\n\f16 W.

He\nwas one of the founders . of the' -American' Society, and one\nof its most active leaders from its inception in, 1884 until\nits union with our parent Society in 1890. He was the\ndiscoverer of Mrs. Piper, and the first carefully to investigate\nand report upon her trances ;\nand, after Dr. Hodgson went to\nAmerica to take up her case, James supported that prince of\ninvestigators with active help and warm friendship. To the\nProceedings of the American Society he contributed papers on\nhypnotism and automatic writing based on personal investiga-\ntion. He was a Corresponding Member of the English Society\nfrom 1884-1889, a Vice-President from 1890-1910, and\nPresident during the years 1894-5. Besides his presidential\naddress, he contributed a number of papers to our Proceedings\nand undertook a large amount of work in connexion with the\ncensus of hallucinations.\nJames wrote also at least three weighty expositions of the\nwork and aims of the Society in three of the leading popular\nmagazines of the United States\n;\n1\nand he brought together\nparts of these in an essay published in the very widely read\nvolume entitled \" The Will to Believe.\" That essay must, I\nthink, be regarded as the most powerful and convincing of all\napologies for this Society.\nBut James' moral support of, and his active participation\nin the work of, the Society were neither the whole nor the\nchief part of his services to \" Psychical Research.\" If James\nhad never been a member of our Society, if even he had\nnever heard of it and its work, we should still have to\nrecognise him as a great influence, perhaps the greatest\nindividual influence of our time, making for the progress and\nextension of our enterprise. For the main tendency and aim\nof all his widely influential teaching was identical with what\nI take to be the deepest lying aim which the Society pursues\nalong its highly special line of inquiry\u2014namely, the reconcilia-\ntion of science and religion on empirical grounds.\nThat the reconciliation of science with religion is the\nessential task of philosophy has long been widely recognised.\nBut no such reconciliation has yet been achieved. James\n1\nScribner\n,\ns Magazine, March, 1890; The Forum, July, 1892; The American\nMagazine, 1908.\n\fLXII.] In Memory of William James. 17\nfound himself in a world in which almost all influential\nthinkers accepted one or other of two types of philosophy.\nOn the one hand was the naturalistic school, which held fast\nto the world of empirical fact, and to the principle that the\nlaws of mechanism hold undisputed sway throughout the\nuniverse ; its utmost concession to religion being such recogni-\ntion of an Unknowable power behind all things as Herbert\nSpencer taught. On the other hand were the transcendental\nidealists, who, having capitulated to empirical science as regards\nall the phenomenal world, claimed to have learnt from Kant\nand Hegel how to preserve a quasi-religious sphere of thought\nby constructing a purely logical scheme of reality that bore\nno relation whatever to the world of empirical fact, one which\nwould remain equally valid no matter what might be the\nnature of our human experience of the world in which we\nlive our daily lives \u2014a time- less, space-less, cause-less, un-\nchanging, infinite whole.\nHowever widely different were the tempers and teachings of\nthese two dominant schools of the Unknowable and the\nAbsolute, they agreed in one point of fundamental importance,\nnamely, they acknowledged the absolute sway of mechanical\nprinciples in the empirical world ; that is to say, both alike\nwere thoroughly mechanistic. To both these schools James\nresolutely opposed himself. He doubted whether the human\nmind would ever achieve the ideal of philosophy, a system of\nknowledge complete and harmonious in all its parts ; he was\nvery certain that no such system has been, or can yet be,\nconstructed. \" The actual universe,\" he said, \" is a thing wide\nopen, but rationalism makes systems, and systems must be\nclosed.\" 1\nHe protested and rebelled against all closed systems\n;\nhe saw on every hand the raw edges of our knowledge ; but\nthat did not lead him merely to seek more facts ; he was\na genuine and original philosopher in that he persistently\nsought better ways of understanding the facts we have. He\nfirmly believed that human knowledge is but at the beginning\nof its course ; and he believed that, if only because human\nknowledge is growing, the universe, of which that knowledge\nis a part, is growing also. \" Eeality,\" he said, \". . .is still\n1\nPragmatism : a New Name for some old ways of thinking, London, 1907,\np. 27.\nB\n\f18 W. M'BougaU. [part\nin the making, and waits part of its complexion from the\nfuture . . . the universe is still pursuing its adventures.\" 1\nThe only reality recognised by Eationalism of either type\nhe found intolerably unreal. He could not away with the\noptimism of the Absolutist rationalism which condones the\nmiseries of man as necessary parts of the Absolute's perfection\n;\nhe recognised the looseness of the reasoning by which\nAbsolutism seeks to establish itself, and affirmed the absurdity\nof the claim of that reasoning to compel our assent to its\nconclusions. He boldly asserted that the only view of the\nuniverse acceptable to him was one that regards it as capable\nof becoming something better than it is, and as one in which\nthe moral efforts of men may contribute towards that result.\nHis philosophic aim was to conceive the universe in accord-\nance with these demands, and to shape a philosophy capable\nof development, consciously incomplete, looking to the empirical\nsciences for aid, and requiring for its completion the co-\noperative efforts of many generations of thinkers ; a philosophy\nwhich shall work in the scientific spirit rather than in that\nof rationalistic dogma, regarding its most cherished conceptions\nas but hypotheses to be constantly tested and evaluated by the\npragmatic method, that is to say, with regard to their signifi-\ncance and value as guides to human life.\nJames, therefore, rejected as unproven and improbable the\nassumption common to both the dominant schools, the assump-\ntion of the absolute sway of mechanical causation in the\nempirical world ; and in standing out thus against the mechanistic\ndogma, he was, of course, striking a powerful blow for \" Psychical\nEesearch.\" For of all the considerations that lead men to\nignore and deny the aims of \"Psychical Eesearch,\" to affirm\nthe impossibility of the happenings we record, the mechanistic\ndogma is by far the most influential ;\n\" these things,\" they\nsay, \" cannot happen, for they are incompatible with our\nmechanical first principles.\"\nJames' brilliant attack on the two most prevalent philo-\nsophies has swept away this dogma from the minds of many,\nand has shaken its hold on the minds of many more ;\nit has\nshewn that these are not the only possible philosophies for a\nself-respecting man of modern culture ; it has taught all who\n1\nPragmatism, p. 257.\n\fLXII.] In Memory of William James. 19\nhave felt its force to keep open minds, to recognise the uncer-\ntainty of all philosophic conclusions, to respect empirical fact,\nand to recognise that in our present state of ignorance it is\nabsurd to pretend to say that this or that cannot happen.\nEvery part of James' work contributed towards this effect,\nso favourable to \" Psychical Eesearch \" ; for it was all of a\npiece. His pragmatism was primarily an extension of the\nscientific attitude of mind towards the problems and theories\nof philosophy. As the instrumental theory of truth it became\na powerful lever for the uprooting of the dogmas of both\nnaturalism and absolutism. His radical empiricism was the\nnatural supplement of his pragmatism, and his pluralism the\nnatural, if not the inevitable, outcome of their conjunction.\nTogether they made strongly for the rescue of human person-\nality from the position of indignity and insignificance to which\nit had been reduced by both the prevalent systems. They\nmade plausible, or at least possible, a belief in some survival\nafter death, the belief in a personal God and in a real com-\nmunion between God and man, and even the belief in the\nobjective efficacy of prayer and of moral effort.\nJames treated psychology as one of the natural sciences\n;\nbut he consistently refused to reduce all consciousness to the\nlevel of an epiphenomenon or silent spectator ; he insisted\nalways on the real efficiency of our consciousness, our feelings,\nour efforts, our thoughts as teleological co-determinants of our\nbodily movements. He discovered an unsuspected wealth of\ndetail in the stream of consciousness ; and he restored to that\nstream its unity, rejecting root and branch the mechanical\ndescriptions and explanations of associationism. He restored\neffort, activity, desire, in short, the will, to its rightful place.\nHe was the first academic psychologist to make adequate\nrecognition of the importance of modern medical studies of\nhysteria and of the reality and theoretical importance of\nhypnotism, automatic speech and writing, and states of dissocia-\ntion in general.\nAbove all he was the first to grasp firmly the thorny subject\nof the psychology of the religious consciousness ;\nboldly to\nadmit the pathological character or affinities of many of its\nmanifestations, and yet to affirm their value and to find in\nthem empirical evidence of the truth of religion. His Varieties\n\f20 W. M'Dougall, [part\nof Religious Experience was immensely successful. Psychology\nhad been regarded as the natural enemy of religion. All that\nwas changed at once, and the few years that have elapsed\nsince the appearance of that book have seen the birth of\nseveral journals wholly devoted to religious psychology, and\nthe publication of a dense stream of books and pamphlets on\nthe same subject, mostly written by religiously-minded persons,\nmany of them by theologians and eminent divines.\nIn all these ways, then, James' philosophical activity ran\nparallel in a larger orbit with the work of the S.P.E. It was\na philosophy which justified our methods and our aims, and\nrendered possible at least the hope of finding in the general\nscheme of things an intelligible place for the facts we\naim at.\nIn these three ways, then, James rendered immense service to\n\" Psychical Eesearch.\" Let us ask\u2014What did the Society do\nfor him ? What in his view has it achieved, and what was\nthe importance for his thought of that achievement ?\nJames distinguished broadly what he called the mechanical\nand the personal views of nature\n\u2014\" science,\" he said, \" essentially\nonly stands for a method and for no fixed belief; yet as\nhabitually taken, both by its votaries and outsiders, it is identi-\nfied with a certain fixed belief\u2014the belief that the hidden order\nof nature is mechanical exclusively, and that non-mechanical\ncategories are irrational ways of conceiving and explaining even\nsuch things as human life.\" To this \" mechanical rationalism,\"\nas he called it, James' whole drift and striving were opposed\n;\nfor him the personal view of nature was the true one ; and\nthere can be no doubt that he was greatly strengthened in\nthis belief by his knowledge of the results of \" Psychical\nEesearch.\"\nAs early as 1890 he proclaimed Mrs. Piper as his 'one\nwhite crow,' meaning that her case had made it impossible to\naccept the principle that our knowledge comes to us only by\nthe channels of sense. And, needless to say, his conviction\nof the supernormal origin of her trance-knowledge was but\nstrengthened by his later acquaintance with that remarkable\nwoman. This case, together with other evidence, convinced\nhim that our minds can and do communicate in some way\nthat cannot be reconciled with the mechanical categories\n;\n\fLXII.] In Memory of William James. 21\nor, in other words, that telepathy is a fact of nature, and\nthat it is not explicable on physical principles.\nTo have found adequate empirical evidence of this trans-\ncendence of the mechanical categories was of crucial importance\nfor James' system of thought. If, as he held, the proof is\nconclusive, mechanistic rationalism is finally shattered by it,\nand the personal view of nature established, and it was this\nhe had in view when he wrote that our Society has restored\nthe continuity of history.\n1\nIn his lectures at Oxford, two years ago, James announced\nhis firm conviction that \" most of the phenomena of psychic\nresearch are rooted in reality,\" and it was obvious, I think,\nto those who knew him, that the results of \"Psychical Eesearch\"\nhad played a greater part in shaping the thought of those\nlectures than he judged it expedient explicitly to affirm before\nan audience so ignorant of the facts.\nIn a recent number of the American Magazine, James'\nundertook to state the principal effect upon his opinions of\n\" twenty-five years of dabbling in\n1\nPsychics.' \" The following\n\"'Religious thinking, ethical thinking, poetical thinking, teleological,\nemotional, sentimental thinking, what one might call the personal view of life\nto distinguish it from the impersonal and mechanical, and the romantic view of\nlife to distinguish it from the rationalistic view, have been, and even still are,\noutside of well-drilled scientific circles, the dominant forms of thought. But\nfor mechanical rationalism, personality is an insubstantial illusion. The chronic\nbelief of mankind, that events may happen for the sake of their personal\nsignificance, is an abomination. . . . But the S.P.R.'s Proceedings have, it\nseems to me, conclusively proved one thing to the candid reader ; and that\nis that the verdict of pure insanity, of gratuitous preference for error, of\nsuperstition without excuse, which the scientists of our day are led by their\nintellectual training to pronounce upon the entire thought of the past, is a\nmost shallow verdict. The personal and romantic view of life has other roots\nbesides wanton exuberance of imagination and perversity of heart. It is\nperennially fed by facts of experience. ... It is the intolerance of science for\nsuch phenomena as we are studying, her peremptory denial either of their\nexistence or of their significance (except as proofs of man's absolute innate\nfolly), that has set science so apart from the common sympathies of the race.\nI confess that it is on this, its humanizing mission, that the Society's best\nclaim to the gratitude of our generation seems to me to depend. It has\nrestored continuity to history. It has shown some reasonable basis for the\nmost superstitious aberrations of the foretime. It has bridged the chasm,\nhealed the hideous rift that science, taken in a certain narrow way, has shot\ninto the human world\" (Essay on \"Psychical Research\" in the vol.

[part\nare the main points of his confession. \" I am baffled as to\nspiiit-return, and as to many other special problems.\" He held\nthe spiritistic hypothesis unproven ; and it was not consistent\nwith his view of personality ;\nnevertheless, with his invariable\nlargeness, he kept an open mind in that direction. As regards\n\" Physical phenomena \" he wrote :\n\" I find myself believing\nthat there is '\nsomething in ' these never-ending reports of\nphysical phenomena, although I haven't yet the least positive\nnotion of the something. It becomes to my mind simply a\nvery worthy problem for investigation.\" The main ground of\nthis opinion was the accumulation of evidence to form what\nhe called a faggot, and the constancy of type of the phenomena.\nHe affirmed the frequency of automatic writing, and its\nconstancy to type.\nHe affirmed \" the presence, in the midst of all the humbug,\nof really supernormal knowledge. ... In really strong mediums\nthis knowledge seems to be abundant, though it is usually\nspotty, capricious and unconnected.\"\nHe inclined\n'\n' to picture the situation as an interaction\nbetween slumbering faculties in the automatist's mind and\na cosmic environment of other consciousness of some sort\nwhich is able to work upon them. If there were in the\nuniverse a lot of diffuse soul-stuff, unable of itself to get\ninto consistent personal form, or to take permanent possession\nof an organism, yet always craving to do so, it might get its\nhead into the air, parasitically, so to speak, by profiting by\nweak spots in the armor of human minds, and slipping in\nand stirring up there the sleeping tendency to personate. It\nwould induce habits in the subconscious region of the mind\nit used thus, and would seek above all things to prolong its\nsocial opportunities by making itself agreeable and plausible.\nIt would drag stray scraps of truth with it from the wider\nenvironment, but would betray its mental inferiority by\nknowing little how to weave them into any important or\nsignificant story.\"\nHe added his conviction that \" the phenomenon is actuated\nby will of some sort anyhow,\" meaning that the messages of\n\" automatic speech and writing\" are not, as the term seems to\nimply, the products of merely mechanical neural processes, but\nexpress desire, intention and design.\n\flxii.] In Memory of William James. 23\nHe concluded by asserting the enormous complexity of the\nphenomena and the necessity for suspension of judgment and\nprolonged and patient inquiry. \" That is why I personally am\nas yet neither a convinced believer in parasitic demons, nor a\nspiritist, nor a scientist, but still remain a psychical researcher\nwaiting for more facts before concluding.\"\n\"Hardly, as yet, has the surface of the facts called 'psychic'\nbegun to be scratched for scientific purposes. It is through\nfollowing these facts, I am persuaded, that the greatest scientific\nconquests of the coming generation will be achieved.\"\nThese few extracts will suffice to indicate the nature of the\neffect in James' mind produced by the work of this Society\n;\nthey show that this effect was of very great, in fact, of crucial\nimportance. They show also that his attitude towards the\nwork of the Society was truly scientific in the higher sense of\nthat word, and that, while he remained thoroughly critical and\nchary of forming positive conclusions, he confidently regarded the\nresults hitherto achieved as but a small and imperfect sample\nof a splendid harvest of knowledge still to be reaped by\n\" Psychical Eesearch.\" To my mind his attitude seems wholly\nadmirable, a model to be held up for all of us to copy as\nnearly as our powers will permit.\nWhile, then, James rendered great services to our Society,\nthe work of the Society powerfully influenced his thought.\nThe relations between him and the Society were fruitful and\nreciprocally advantageous in a high degree. By this action\nand reaction between his philosophical principles and the\nresults of \" psychical research,\" James' thought was led to a\ndefinite issue upon the problem, which is at once the central\nproblem of all philosophy, and the immediate and special\nproblem for the illumination of which this Society exists,\nnamely, the problem of the nature of human personalities and\ntheir position in the universe.\nIn his Principles of Psychology, James took up decidedly the\nantimechanical view of the human organism, criticising most\neffectively and destructively those various formulations of the\nrelation of mind to body, which deny all real efficiency in the\nphysical world of our consciousness, our thought, feeling, and\nwill, the epiphenomenalism of Huxley and most naturalists, and\nthe various forms of psycho-physical parallelism. Classing all\n\f24 W. M'Dougall. [part\nthese together under the head automaton-theory, he wrote \" My\nconclusion is that to urge the automaton theory upon us, as\nit is now urged, on purely a 'priori and ^fist-metaphysical\ngrounds, is an unwarrantable impertinence in the present state\nof psychology.\" 1\nAnd he affirmed that \"it is to my mind,\nquite inconceivable that consciousness should have nothing to\ndo with a business which it so faithfully attends \"\n;\n2\nmeaning\nthe processes of the brain.\nThroughout he never wavered in his opposition to the\nmechanical philosophy, whether in the form of mechanical\nmaterialism or the mechanistic rationalism of the transcen-\ndental idealists or absolutists.\nISTow throughout the history of thought the great rival to\nall the mechanistic theories has been the soul-theory, the\nanimistic theory that man's body is animated by a soul, an\nimmaterial thinking being, which is the ground of his indi-\nviduality, and is capable of surviving the death of his body,\nand preserving all or something of his personality beyond the\ngrave.\nIt might have been expected that James' rejection of all\nthe mechanistic doctrines would have led him to embrace the\nsoul-theory. But he never did accept it. In the Principles\nhe presented the soul-theory forcibly and sympathetically, and\nconfessed \" that to posit a soul influenced in some mysterious\nway by the brain-states and responding to them by conscious\naffections of its own, seems to me the line of least logical\nresistance, so far as we yet have attained.\"\n3\nBut, though\ntreating the theory with respect, and asserting that \" it is at\nany rate less positively objectionable than either mind-stuff or a\nmaterial monad creed,\"\n4\nhe insisted that \" it does not strictly\nexplain anything,\"\n5\nthat the conception of the soul is not\nrequired by psychology, and that the passing thought of each\nmoment of consciousness is the only subject logically required\nfor the intelligible description of our mental life.\nIn the Principles, then, James, refusing to accept the soul-\ntheory, left open the question of the nature and ground of\npersonality ; and in his later writings we find him more\ndecidedly opposed to the soul-theory. In his Oxford lectures\n1\nPrinciples, vol. i. p. 138. ' Ibid. p. 136. 3\nVol. i. p. 181.\n4\nOp. cit. p. 182. 5\nOp. cit. p. 371.\n\fLXII.] In Memory of William James. 25\nof two years ago he returned to the question and said\n\u2014\n\" Souls have worn out both themselves and their welcome,\nthat is the plain truth. Philosophy ought to get the mani-\nfolds of experience unified on principles less empty. Like\nthe word '\ncause,' the word '\nsoul ' is but a theoretic stop-\ngap\u2014it marks a place and claims it for future explanation\nto occupy.\" 1\nAnd he complained that the conception of the\nsoul has no pragmatic significance ; which for him was equiva-\nlent to saying that it is useless, and therefore invalid.2\nThis is not the occasion for any examination of James'\nreasoning. We have rather to seek to grasp as clearly as\npossible what his own view was : and this is worth doing\nbecause his view was unfamiliar, distinctive, and by no means\neasy to seize. James' frequent and sympathetic references to\nMyers' conception of the Subliminal Self may easily lead the\ncasual reader to suppose that he accepted Myers' hypothesis\nor one very similar to it. But that would be an error. We\nmust recognize clearly that Myers' doctrine was a development\nand extension of the soul-theory and that James rejected that\ntheory.\nYet it is equally clear that James believed and taught that\nthe mind of man is not wholly destroyed at death, that in\nsome sense and in some degree it survives the death of his\nbody.\nIn the Principles James criticised very forcibly and de-\ncisively rejected the view that individual human consciousness\ncan be regarded as compounded of lesser consciousnesses,\nsensations, or units of feeling, or fragments of consciousness\nof any kind. And he recognised that the only logical\nalternative to this doctrine of mind-stuff (of atoms of con-\nsciousness capable of being compounded into larger and larger\nwholes of consciousness) seems to be the soul-theory ; but yet,\nas we have seen, he rejected that theory and left open the\nproblem for further investigation.\nIn his Ingersoll Lecture on Human Immortality? he adopted\na peculiar theory of the function of the bodily organism or\nof the brain in our mental life, one which he called \" the\ntheory of separation \" or \" the transmission theory.\" By these\nnames he implied the notion that there exists a great sea\n1\nA Pluralistic Universe, p. 210. \"Ibid. 3\nBoston, 1898.\n\f26 W. M'Dougall. [part\nof consciousness or thought ; that the consciousness of each\none of us is but a ray of this univeral consciousness ; and\nthat the brain of each man is a translucent or half-transparent\nspot in the veil of nature through which a ray of the uni-\nversal consciousness intermittently struggles to illumine for\nbrief moments the material world. According to this view,\nthen, the bodily organism is the principle of individuality\n;\nmind or consciousness is essentially one ; and our individual\nconsciousnesses, so-called, are but distorted beams filtered out\nfrom the universal consciousness by our brains ;\nand, when\nthose brains decay, the beams cease to be thus transmitted.\nIt is clear that this \" transmission theory \" escapes materialism,\nbut it is equally clear that it does not provide for any\nsurvival of human personality after the death of the body.\nJames returned to the transmission theory in his lecture on\nthe \" Energies of Men,\" developing it from the point of view\nthat in our moral and intellectual efforts each of us draws\nspiritual energy from that larger whole of which, according\nto the hypothesis, his mind is but a fragmentary manifestation;\nand, in accordance with his invariable tendency, he adduced\nin a striking and original way new empirical evidences of the\nreality of such influx of the greater tides of life through the\nchannels of human personality. 1\nBut his later utterances show that he was not satisfied with\nthe position defended in the Ingersoll lecture. It was obvious to\nhim that it was hardly consistent with his rejection of the notion\nof the compounding of consciousness. For the reabsorption of\nindividual consciousness in the universal sea implies such com-\npounding. Acordingly he returned to the problem in his Oxford\nlectures. He told us how he had wrestled long and long with this\nnotion of the compounding of consciousness, and how, approach-\ning it now from the side of over-individual consciousness, rather\nthan, as in the Principles, from the side of composition of individual\nhuman consciousness from lesser parts, he had reversed his\nopinion, thrown over his own brilliant demonstration of the\nabsurdity of the notion, and made it the keystone of his\nphilosophic scheme of the universe. After this revolution, it\nwas possible to modify the doctrine of the Ingersoll lecture\nin a way that made it less intangible, less a matter of metaphor\n1\nPhilosophical Review, 1907.\n\flxil] In Memory of William James. 27\nand vague suggestion merely. He modified it in the direction\nof assimilating it to Fechner's panpsychic view of the universe.\n\" The drift,\" he said, \" of all the evidence we have, seems to\nme to sweep us very strongly towards the belief in some form\nof superhuman life with which we may, unknown to ourselves,\nbe co-conscious. We may be in the universe, as dogs and cats\nare in our libraries, seeing the books and hearing the conversation,\nbut having no inkling of the meaning of it all. . . . The analogies\nwith ordinary psychology and with the facts of pathology, with\nthose of psychical research, so called, and with those of religious\nexperience, establish, when taken together, a decidedly formidable\nprobability in favour of a general view of the world almost\nidentical with Fechner's.\"\n1\nAnd Fechner's view or vision of\nthe world was one of a hierarchy of consciousnesses, each member\nof the hierarchy being at once both a consciousness for itself\nand a part of a more widely inclusive consciousness of a higher\nlevel or order. James expressed his conception of the relation\nof the individual human consciousness to the more inclusive\nconsciousness as clearly perhaps as it is capable of being\nexpressed in the following words :\n\" Out of my experience, such\nas it is (and it is limited enough) one fixed conclusion dogmati-\ncally emerges, and that is this, that we with our lives are like\nislands in the sea, or like trees in the forest. The maple and\nthe pine may whisper to each other with their leaves, and\nConanicut and Newport hear each other's foghorns. But the\ntrees also commingle their roots in the darkness underground,\nand the islands also hang together through the ocean's bottom.\nJust so there is a continuum of cosmic consciousness, against\nwhich our individuality builds but accidental fences, and into\nwhich our several minds plunge as into a mother-sea or\nreservoir. Our '\nnormal ' consciousness is circumscribed for\nadaptation to our external earthly environment, but the fence\nis weak in spots, and fitful influences from beyond break in,\nshowing the otherwise unverifiable common connection. Not\nonly psychic research, but metaphysical philosophy and specula-\ntive biology are led in their own ways to look with favour\non some such '\npanpsychic ' view of the universe as this.\"\n2\n1\nA Pluralistic Universe, p. 309.\n2\nThe American Magazine, \" The Confidences of a Psychical Researcher,,\"\n1908.\n\f28 W. M'Dougall. [part\nHe refused to identify this wide mother-sea of consciousness\nwith the absolute mind of idealistic monism, basing his refusal\nchiefly on moral grounds. Even the widest consciousness of\nall he regarded as less than the whole universe. \" However\nmuch may be collected, however much may report itself as\npresent at any effective centre of consciousness or action,\nsomething else is self-\u00aboverned and absent and unreduced to\nunity.\" 1\nThis is the essential character of his pluralistic\nuniverse. To what more inclusive forms our individual\nconsciousnesses belong he did not pretend to say ; but that\nthey do so belong was his main thesis ; and he believed that\nthe mystic's experience of union and absorption of the self\nin a higher power is what it claims to be ; and it is after\nthat model that he would have us conceive the life beyond\nthe grave. It is clear that this view implies no personal\nimmortality ; the life of the individual man is but a temporary\nand partial separation and circumscription of a part of a\nlarger whole, into which it is reabsorbed at death, and the\nbody remains the individualising principle. But he held that\nthis view, besides being more consonant than any other with\nall the empirical evidence, is pragmatically justified on moral\ngrounds ;\nbecause, as organs of the larger whole, we play a\npart in determining its development and welfare; \"our thoughts\ndetermine our acts, and our acts redetermine the previous\nnature of the world \" ;\n2\nand so we may, in a very real sense,\nhold ourselves to be co-workers with God, helping Him to\nmake the universe something nobler than it yet is.\nMore than any other man of our time, James was qualified\nby his openness of mind, his courage and originality, his\npowerful intellect, his wide knowledge of empirical fact and\nphilosophical speculation, and his prolonged and earnest wrest-\nling with the fundamental problems, to express conclusions\nthat must command a deeply respectful hearing. To many\nmembers of this Society it must be a disappointment that\nsuch a leader should have reached a conclusion adverse to the\nsurvival of human personality. But it is much that his final\nposition is one which affirms the real efficiency and abiding\nvalue of the moral and intellectual efforts of mankind.

H. Muirhead. [part\nIV.\nWILLIAM JAMES AS PHILOSOPHER.\nBy PROFESSOR J. H. MUIRHEAD.\nI have a double difficulty in accepting the Editor's invitation\nto write a short article on this subject. I am writing from\nthe point of view of general philosophy in a periodical devoted\nto psychical research, and I am writing on a philosopher\nwhom, in spite of great admiration and respect, I have never\nbeen able to accept as my own leader. I may thus be said\nto be an outsider to the second power. I justify myself in\nview of the first of these disqualifications by saying at once\nthat a philosopher's attitude to at least some of the aims of\npsychical research is to a large extent dependent on his philoso-\nphical view in general, and that I believe Professor James's\nwas so in a particular degree. The second disqualification is\nmore serious in an article like the present. But I believe it\nis less fatal in my own case than it might be in the case of\nother abler critics, seeing that, while differing widely from Pro-\nfessor James in letter, I find myself in far greater sympathy\nwith his spirit than I do with many present day writers\nwith whom I am in greater literal agreement.\nIf we would know what that spirit is, we have to turn to\nthe general movement of philosophic thought, and particularly\nto that of our own time. The history of science and philo-\nsophy has been written from many points of view. The most\nhelpful is that from which it is regarded as a series of ever\ndeeper reactions from the abstract to the concrete, from ab-\nsorption in conceptions too narrow for the facts of human life\nand experience back to the fulness of reality. For such\n\flxil] William James as Philosojiher. 31\nreactions all the great philosophers from Socrates to Hegel may\nbe shown to stand. To understand our own time we have\nto realise that we are ourselves living in the middle of just\nsuch another. From a period of obsession, both in physical\nand social science, by the idea of rigid mechanical laws to\nwhich human ideals have to be subordinated, we have passed\nto the advocacy of the central place of human purposes, and\nthe subordination to them of scientific generalisations as things\npartial, tentative, provisional. The writings of Poincare,\nBoutroux and Bergson in France, of Wundt and Eucken in\nGermany, of Karl Pearson and James Ward among ourselves\nare sufficient indication of this general drift. Together they\nstand for the assertion by man's spirit of the claim to be\nmaster in its own house, and to see everything sub specie\nhumanitatis.\nIt is the fighting part he has taken in this movement, since\nthe publication of the Will to Believe, in 1897, that gives its\nsignificance to \"William James's work. There are, I believe,\nthousands to whom that book and his other popular works,\nby their broad humanity, their cheerful faith in the open-\nness of all roads, have seemed to have lifted the intel-\nlectual sky as with the promise of Spring. It is this, far\nmore than the actual doctrines they contain, that has been\nthe source of his deserved and unique popularity. Whether\nhis influence will be a permanent one it is too early perhaps\nto say. What a close study of his works has brought home\nto my own mind is that his controversy with the school in\nEngland and America, which, not less than he, has set itself\nagainst the abstractions of a barren intellectualism, is likely\nto prove a source of weakness rather than of strength, and\nthat just in so far as he himself in the constant development\nof his ideas, which is one of the most attractive features of his\nwritings, stops short of their conclusions, his work is likely\nto lose in fruitfulness.\nAn article like the present would be no suitable place for\na review of his philosophy as a whole. What I desire to do\nis to try within its limits to show by one or two examples,\nfirst, that what he claims for the world as a whole is true\nof his own thought : it has no fixed statuesque outlines,\nbut on the contrary is always undergoing expansion and\n\f32 Professor J. H. Muirhead. [part\ndevelopment; in the second place, that, notwithstanding this,\nand mainly, I think, because of imperfect emancipation from the\nintellectualist presuppositions which he lives to combat, he fails\nin the end to make the best of the position he has won.\nI take three points which will be recognised as crucial\u2014his\ndoctrine of the meaning of truth, his antagonism to intel-\nlectualism founded on the antithesis between sense-experience\nand conception, and his pluralism.\n(1) The first is stated and restated in a hundred passages\nin which we are implored to disabuse ourselves of all academic\nand scholastic definitions of truth, and to face the question\nsquarely as to what truth consists in as a matter of fact and\nexperience. When we do so, we are assured, what we shall\nfind is that truth is no rigid system to which the soul ascends\nover a series of rigid conceptions, as to a marble shrine over\nmarble steps, but the felt fitness of an intellectual attitude to the\nrequirements of a concrete situation\u2014its power to bring us into\nfruitful relations with it and enable us to make capital out of it.\nTruth-seeking is thus literally truth-making\u2014verity is verification.\nNo one who has gone through James's books with the single\naim of understanding this contention can rise from the study\nwithout feeling that his ideas of the process known as verifica-\ntion have been widened and deepened. Many of James's state-\nments of it are purple patches in the psychology of cognition.\nWhat the student cannot help regretting is that the earlier ones\nshould have contained so much that was ambiguous, and left\nso much to be supplied by the reader. The author himself\npathetically complains of the obtuseness of his critics, and\neven of his friends, \" who have boggled at and refused to\ntake the spirit rather than the letter of our discourse.\"\nThis is apt to recall Carlyle's juryman who complained that\nhe had never met eleven such obstinate men in the same\nroom in his life. A whole generation of scholars does not\ngo obstinately wrong over a theory which has been stated\nwith reasonable clearness and the necessary qualifications.\nBy the emphasis on the feeling of satisfaction, as well as by\nthe name Pragmatism itself, it was inevitable that the theory\nshould suggest the old Protagorean heresy, \/u-erpov avOpwiros,\nand be met with the taunt that willing to believe was tanta-\nmount to believing as you will.\n\fLXII.] William James as Philosopher. S3\nIf James's own mind ever gave harbour to such an idea,\nhe has made ample amends by the clearness with which he\nstates his true view in his later articles. In the first place,\nby satisfactoriness, he tells us, he does not mean mere practical\nutility. Man has logical as well as practical needs. Con-\nsistency is the breath of the soul's life, as air is of the body's.\n\" After man's interest in breathing freely, the greatest of all\nhis interests is his interest in consistency.\" 1\nAnd, in the\nsecond place, this consistency has an objective counterpart : it\nis a guarantee to us, the only guarantee we have, of corre-\nspondence with that \" matrix of experiential circumstances\n\"\nwhich we call reality. \" The pragmatist, being himself a man\nand imagining in general no lines of true belief contrary to\nours about the '\nreality ' which he has laid at the base of\nhis epistemological discussion, is willing to treat our satisfac-\ntions as possibly really true guides to it, not as guides true\nsolely for us.\" 2\nIn view of such a statement, the long wearisome controversy\nas to the meaning of the will to believe may well be laid to\nrest. But agreement on this point between pragmatism and\nits critics only raises a new question, which unfortunately we\nhave no longer the opportunity of discussing with James.\nGranted that satisfactoriness is satisfactoriness \" in the long\nrun and on the whole \"\n\u2014that the harmony we seek is harmony\nwith the totality of experience, is not such an ideal experience\njust what we mean by the \" matrix of experiential circum-\nstances \" ? Can reality be anything else for us ? If it cannot,\nit seems as though James to complete his theory must advance\na step further in the direction of the intellectualist, or, as I\nshould prefer to call it, impersonal idealism, which he opposes,\nand hold that the mark of reality is just this harmonious\nsetting in an ideal experience. If, on the other hand, we\nare asked to conceive the possibility of a reality without\nrelation to such an experience, is this not just an appeal\nto the idea of an absolute or unknown in its worst possible\nform ? In reading such passages as that just quoted, or\nagain that in which he claims that his theory of truth\nis \" purely epistemological \" and \" prejudges nothing as to\nthe constitution of realities, so that the most diverse meta-\n1\nThe Meaning of Truth, p. 211. \"Ib., 192.\n0\n\f34 Professor J. H. Muirhead. [part\nphysics can vise it as their foundation,\"\n1\none cannot but feel\nthat James fails to carry his Pragmatism to its legitimate\nconclusion, and to reap the full fruits of it as an answer to\nall forms of agnosticism and pessimism. Are not his opponents\nhere the truer pragmatists when they insist that such a \" thing\nin itself\" unrelated to experience as we know it, save as an\nincognisable duplicate, belongs to the lumber-house, not to the\nutilisable furniture of the human mind ?\n(2) The second of the above points is equally fundamental.\nGranting we can experience reality as it truly is (and James\nas well as Bergson, whom he takes here as his master,\nconstantly assumes that we can), what is the medium of this\ninsight ? James's answer to this question is well known.\nConception, the very eye of the soul according to \" intellect-\nualism,\" merely serves to short-cut the real processes of\napprehension. It is like a measuring rod laid along the\nsurface of the ground touching it here and there, but merely\nas a guide to hand or eye and giving no real contact with its\nactual outline. For this we have to dip back into the stream\nof sense-experience where we can feel ourselves into its strains\nand pressures, its real directions, and its living meanings. If\nthis article were upon James as a psychologist, it would be\nnecessary again to express our gratitude to him for the service\nhe has done mental science by the emphasis he has laid upon\nthe presentational, or immediately given element in the cogni-\ntive life. This is only equalled by our debt to him for his\nexposition of the instinctive, or immediate element in the cona-\ntive. But the question is of the relation of conception to\nreality, and it is just here that we have to notice the same\nkind of ambiguity as we found in his doctrine of truth. As\nin the latter he started with an uncritical account of what is\nmeant by satisfaction and only gradually arrived at a statement\nof the two different senses it may bear, so here, I think,\nit can be shown that he started with a theory of conception,\nwhich philosophy had already outgrown, and was only\nbeginning to realise its imperfections when, unfortunately, his\nlife was cut short. It is quite true that we may use con-\nception in the sense of a class notion or a general formula,\nthe leading feature of which seems to be the omission of\n1\nMeaning of Truth, p. 215.\n\fLXII.] William James as Philosopher. 35\nparticulars. But already, long before James and Bergson had\nbegun to write, this notion of the \" abstract universal\n\"\nhad been subjected to a destructive criticism, just on\nthe ground which these writers urge, of the partial and\nschematic view that general ideas give of the concrete reality.\nHere there is no difference, as James himself recognises when\nhe classes Hegel among the \" thick \" writers as contrasted\nwith the alleged thinness of his English interpreters.1\nWhere\ndifference begins (and it is a vital one) is in the plan\nthat is proposed for the correction of this abstractness.\nTo the idealist from Plato to Hegel the half truths of\nthe understanding have to look for correction, not back\nto the uncriticised life of sense-experience, but forward to its\nfuller interpretation by the aid of synthetic reason,\n\u2014\nthe resolute endeavour of thought to see the part in relation\nto the whole,\u2014which gives it its meaning. Do James and\nBergson mean to deny this ? In view of a careful collation of\nthe relevant passages in both, I cannot myself believe it. To\nsay that to get into touch with the truth about the world we\nhave to turn our backs upon the systematising, correlating\nintelligence, and merge ourselves in the unsifted experiences of\nthe sensory world, is like saying that in order to live truly we\nmust set aside all reflection upon the meaning of life\u2014all\nattempt to bring our impulses into harmony with one another\nand with the recpurements of social life, and fall back upon\nuncriticised instinct. Here also I venture to think that\nProfessor James, by permitting himself to be led into\nexaggeration by his generous enthusiasm for the real and the\nconcrete, has failed to make full use of the truth which\nhe grasped. It surely is no part of Humanism to depreciate\nthe place of the organising intelligence, whether in theory or\npractice. Let the faith in this once be abandoned (and with\nit our faith in our intellectual, moral and aesthetic ideals), we\nhave yet to learn what hold we can establish through\nphilosophy on the spiritual world, the vindication of whose\nreality is the underlying motive of all James's works.\n1\n\"He plants himself in the empirical flux of things and gets the impression\nof what happens. Concepts were not in his eyes the static self-contained\nthings that previous logicians had supposed hut were germinative and passed\nbeyond themselves into each other.\" A Pluralistic Universe, \"Hegel and his\nMethod,\" p. 89 foil.\n\f36 Professor J. H. Muirhead. [PART\n(3) The third point, the theory of \" a Pluralistic Universe,\"\nhas been in principle disposed of in what has been already\nsaid. If, as we have just seen, the conception of the unity\nof the intelligence with the world which it knows is a\npresupposition of our experience : if, as James himself assures\nus, \"there is a push, an urgency within our very experience\nagainst which we are on the whole powerless and which\ndrives us in the direction that is the destiny of our belief\"\n\u2014a destiny he explains, as we have seen, as fulness and\nconsistency ; if the same presupposition, mutatis mutandis,\nunderlies our practice and is the inspiration of all our\nart, how is it possible for the pragmatist to hold that the\nworld falls into disconnected parts ? In the admission of\nsuch a possibility have we not again only the ghost of the\nAbsolutism, against which the whole theory is a revolt ?\nGiven such independent parts, would we not have just the\nkind of Absolute we desire to exclude ? Or (if this is one of\nthe wiredrawn arguments against which James protests) what\nis the pragmatic value of such an idea ? It gives us, we are\ntold, the sense of liberty. In a way it does. It gives us\nthe liberty of believing in the Devil, of supposing that the\nworld may be quite otherwise than it appears, and that the\n\"push\" or urgency that James speaks of may, all unknown to\nus, be counteracted by another, which in the end will falsify\nall our beliefs and bring to nought all our efforts. But into\nwhat \" fruitful reforms \" has such an idea ever led mankind ?\nThe one true ultimate basis of freedom is faith, not in the\ncontingency, but in the rationality of the world. James com-\nplains of the statuesque unity of the world as the Platonist\nconceives it. But Plato himself recognised that there are\nother kinds of unity besides that of the statue. There is the\nunity of a living thing, and there is the unity of a purposeful\nact ; there is unity in the general tendency of biological\nevolution, and there is unity in the stumbling progress through\ntrial and error of which human life seems to consist. With the\nrecognition of this we come back, I do not say to Monism, for\nthat is ambiguous in its turn, but to something quite different\nfrom Pluralism \u2014a world that seems in a way we are still\nfar from understanding pledged to honour the drafts our logical\nand ethical ideas make upon it.\n\fLXII.] William James as Philosopher. 37\nIf space had allowed, I believe I could have shown here\nalso that James, like all great thinkers, has himself provided\nus with the means of correcting his own exaggerations. But\nperhaps I have said enough to indicate the place this paper\nwould claim for him in the pantheon of modern philosophy.\nHe has himself told us that humanism is a spirit rather\nthan a formulated doctrine, \" like one of those secular changes\nthat come upon public opinion overnight, as it were borne\nupon tides '\ntoo deep for sound or foam,' that survive all the\ncrudities and extravagances of their advocates, that you can\npin to no one absolutely essential statement, nor kill by any\ndecisive stab.\" This is truly and eloquently said. I for one\nam far from desiring to kill it. On the contrary, I desire to\nsee it kept alive in the spirit of its distinguished founder,\nand going on from more to more. To attain this object it is,\nI believe, necessary that it should free itself from earlier limita-\ntions and come out more whole-heartedly and consistently on\nthe side, if not of the will to believe, at any rate of the\nbelief in the will and the ultimate harmony between the make\nof things and its deepest impulses and ideals.\n\f38 Rigid Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nV.\nPKOFESSOK PIGOU ON CKOSS-CORKESPONDENCES.\nBY THE RIGHT HON. GERALD W. BALFOUR.\nThose who see in the phenomena now familiarly known as\n\" cross-correspondences \" something beyond mere fraud or chance\nwould appear at first sight to have two explanations to choose\nfrom. Either the observed concordances must be wholly as-\ncribed to telepathic action between the subconscious selves of\nthe automatists (the agency of their conscious selves being\nsupposed to be ex hypothesi excluded, or at least reduced to a\nminimum) ; or else we must assume the intervention of some\nintelligence external to the automatists\u2014an intelligence which,\nif it cannot be connected with any living person, presumably\nis, what the script habitually claims it to be, a disembodied\nspirit.\nIn an interesting paper which was published in the Proceedings\nof June, 1909 (Vol. XXIII. pp. 286-303), Professor Pigou main-\ntains the thesis that this choice of explanations is not really\nopen to us, at all events so far as the evidence from cross-\ncorrespondences is concerned ;\nthat upon that evidence taken\nalone we are not entitled even to suspend judgment, but are\nbound, in accordance with the recognised methods of science,\nto decide in favour of subliminal as against spiritual agency.\nA criticism of Professor Pigou's paper by Sir Oliver Lodge\nappeared in the Society's Journal for October, 1909, followed\nby a reply from the author and a further rejoinder from his\ncritic in November.\nAlthough these later contributions to the discussion have done\na good deal to clear up the issues raised in the original paper,\n\flxii.] Professor Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 39\nit appears to me that much still remains to be said : and\nsomething, at least, of this I will try to say here.\nProfessor Pigou's argument may be reduced to three main\npropositions and a conclusion.\n(1) The Bamsden-Miles experiments show that the pro-\nduction of a simple correspondence is not outside\nthe known powers of the subliminal self.\n(2) The results of Dr. Verrall's attempts to get a certain\nGreek phrase reproduced in Mrs. Verrall's automatic\nscript show that the subliminal consciousness can\nalso produce the complementary element in a comple-\nmentary correspondence.\n(3) The complementary element exhibited in what for\nshortness' sake we may call the Verrall Case is\ncomparable in all essentials with the complementary\nelement in the best cross-correspondences recorded in\nthe Proceeding?, up to the date of Professor Pigou's\npaper.\nThe conclusion which follows from these premises is that\nthe production of complementary correspondences of the best\ntype between two or more automatic scripts is within the\nknown powers of the subliminal self; and accordingly, in the\nabsence of other or further evidence, we are bound by the\nrecognised canons of scientific investigation to accept the sub-\nliminal consciousness acting within its known powers as a more\nprobable cause of complementary correspondences than discarnate\nentities whose existence is admittedly hypothetical.\nProfessor Pigou's conclusion would be an important one if\nestablished, and this makes it the more necessary to subject\nthe three main propositions on which it is founded to searching\nexamination.\nAccording to proposition (1) the Eamsden-Miles experiments\nin thought-transference show that the production of simple\ncorrespondences between the automatic scripts of different writers\nis within the known powers of the subliminal consciousness.\nHow is this proved ? Professor Pigou starts from the fact\nobserved by Miss Eamsden that among the impressions she\nreceived from Miss Miles \" those which are the most surprisingly\n\f40 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\ncorrect are some which were never intentionally transferred at\nall.\" From this experience\u2014not an uncommon one in connection\nwith experimental thought-transference\u2014he infers that the\nsubliminal self of A is sometimes capable of influencing the\nperceptions of B apart from conscious will. If, now, A and\nB are two automatic writers and A's subliminal self possesses\nthe capacity of influencing B's perceptions apart from conscious\nwill, we are entitled to conclude that A's subliminal self is able\nto exercise a similarly independent influence on B's script. And\nsince, ex hypothcsi, it can influence A's script, it is evidently in\na position to bring about a simple correspondence between\nthe two.\nThe critical step in this argument is the inference that the\nsubliminal self of one person is sometimes capable of influencing\nanother person's conscious perceptions apart from conscious\nwill.\nIn the Bamsden-Miles experiments the general plan adopted\nwas that Miss Bamsden should think of Miss Miles regularly\nat 7.0 p.m. on every day that an experiment was to be tried,\nand write down the impressions that came to her. \" Miss\nMiles on her side had no fixed time for thinking of Miss\nBamsden, but thought of her more or less during the whole\nday, and in the evening noted briefly what ideas had been\nmost prominently before her mind during the day, and which\nshe wished to convey, or thought might have been conveyed,\nto Miss Bamsden\" (Proc. Vol. XXI. p. 71).\nIt seems to me impossible in these conditions to infer with\nany certainty that the conscious will of one or the other or\nboth of the experimenters was not an essential and determining\nfactor in the result. On the one side we have the conscious\nwill to transmit impressions, on the other the conscious effort\nof expectant attention, each experimenter meanwhile fixing her\nthoughts on the other. These are the invariable accompani-\nments of the phenomena. How can they be eliminated or\nsafely disregarded ? The fact that the impressions received by\nMiss Bamsden were not always those which Miss Miles in-\ntended to convey does not prove that the subliminal self of\nMiss Miles was capable of influencing Miss Bamsden's percep-\ntions apart from Miss Miles' conscious will, but only that the\nparticular impression transferred was sometimes independent of\n\fLXII.] Professor Pigou on Cross-Correspondences. 41\nMiss Miles' conscious will. 1\nThe attitude of Miss Miles'\nconscious self may have been the conditio sine quel non of\nthere being any thought-transference at all. Moreover, even\nif we were entitled to ignore the factor of Miss Miles'\nconscious will, there remains the possible effect of Miss\nEamsden's conscious will still to be considered. There is\nnothing in these experiments, so far as I can see, that would\nwarrant us in excluding the hypothesis that the true \" agent\n\"\nin the case was Miss Eamsden's conscious self, and that the\nprocess was one of \" tapping \" Miss Miles' thoughts, conscious\nor subconscious, rather than of passively receiving impressions.\nOther observations of psychical phenomena might perhaps justify\nthe contention that the subliminal self of one person is capable\nof influencing the perceptions of another person without the\nexercise of conscious will on the part of either supraliminal\nself; but this cannot, I think, be proved from the Eamsden-\nMiles experiments taken alone.\nStill less do these experiments prove a power on the part\nof Miss Miles' subliminal self deliberately to influence Miss\nEamsden's perceptions. Even if we consent to treat the\nconscious will of one or both of the supraliminal selves as\nnegligible factors in the result, the transference of impressions\nmay have been a mere automatic effect of interaction between\ntwo psychical entities in which deliberate intention played no\npart whatever. It is difficult to be quite sure of Professor\nPigou's attitude towards this important Cjuestion of intention.\nWhen he argues from the experience of Miss Eamsden and\nMiss Miles that \" the subliminal self of (say) Mrs. Verrall\ncould probably bring about a simple correspondence between\nher automatic script and that of some other scribe,\" and speaks\nof the subliminal self as the \" agent \" who is \" responsible\n\"\nfor the result ; still more when he claims to have shown that\nthe \"manufacture\" {Proceedings, Vol. XXIII. p. 294) of simple\ncorrespondences is within its known powers, or speaks of the\nsubliminal self of one automatist as \"trying\" {pp. cit. p. 2 95)\ni The fact that all the impressions conveyed had formed part of the contents\nof Miss Miles' supraliminal consciousness at some time during the same day,\nand that Miss Miles was thinking of Miss Ramsden more or less during the\nwhole day, makes the case weaker still from the point of view of Professor\nPigou's argument.\n\f42 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nto impress a given idea on the automatic script both of herself\nand of some other automatist, are we or are we not to\nunderstand that he uses these terms in a sense implying\ndeliberate purpose on the part of the subliminal consciousness ?\nIf the answer is \" yes,\" then I must insist in reply that\nthe mere fact of a simple correspondence occurring cannot, of\nitself, form any ground for inferring intention. Other evidence\nof intention may be forthcoming : for instance, an intimation\ngiven in one script that an attempt has been, or will be,\nmade to obtain in another the emergence of the particular\nword or idea that forms the subject of the correspondence.\nSimilarly we know from the testimony of Miss Miles' normal\nself that she intended to convey certain impressions to Miss\nEamsden : but this cannot by any possibility be made to prove\nthat Miss Miles' subliminal consciousness could form such an\nintention on its own account.\nIf, on the other hand, the answer is in the negative, if, that\nis, we are to understand that he does not attribute deliberate\npurpose to the subliminal self, the question immediately arises\nwhether some, at least, of the simple correspondences recorded\nin the Proceedings cannot be shown to have been deliberately\nproduced by whatever agency was at work. Now that many\nunmistakable cross-correspondences are claimed in the script to\nbe the deliberate work of the controls, and that this claim is\nconstantly put forward before the cross-correspondences have\nbeen discovered, are facts familiar to all who have studied the\nliterature of the subject. It will hardly be disputed that these\nfacts constitute at least prima facie evidence of intention.\nUnless this evidence can be discredited\u2014and Professor Pis;ou\nhas made no attempt to discredit it\u2014I must hold that his\nargument, even if valid as regards involuntary correspondences,\nfalls short of what is required. The known powers of the\nsubliminal self will not have been proved to cover all the\nphenomena which even simple correspondences sometimes\npresent.\nProfessor Pigou's second proposition, to which I now pass,\nrefers exclusively to the complementary element in a comple-\nmentary correspondence. As the Eamsd en-Miles experiments\nwere supposed to show that the powers of the subliminal\n\flxii.] Professor Pigou on Cross-Corresjoondences. 43\nconsciousness extend to the independent production of simple\ncorrespondences, so the Verrall case is now appealed to as\nproving that the production of the complementary element in a\ncomplementary correspondence is also included in those powers.\nTo make my criticism of this proposition intelligible it is\nnecessary to recapitulate the facts of the case as set forth in\nProfessor Pigou's own statement.\nIn April, 1901, Dr. Verrall wrote down a phrase from a\npassage of Euripides, set for translation in the Classical Tripos\nof 1873 when he was a candidate. The phrase consists of\nthree Greek words, fxovoirwXov e? aw, the more obvious meaning\nof which would be \" towards the one-horse dawn,\" though\naccording to an interpretation which Dr. Verrall inclines to\nfavour, the real meaning may be \" towards the lonely-\nwandering dawn.\" Dr. Verrall's intention, which he was\ncareful not to reveal to anybody, was to try for a reproduc-\ntion of this phrase in Mrs. Verrall's automatic script.\nA large number of what seem to be fragmentary repro-\nductions of the words or meaning of the phrase occurred in\nMrs. Verrall's script during the course of the next five\nmonths. Of these Professor Pigou selects four, which he gives\nas follows\n:\nJuly 4 : Yellow is the colour of the dawn.\nSept. 2 : e? to.\nSept. 1 1 : \/xoVo? fxera 6eov ovSe aWov two? (alone with\nGod and none other).\nSept. 18: e(9 \u00ab7T7ro? (one horse).\nIn addition to these four \" relevant passages,\" as he calls\nthem, Professor Pigou selects three others not in the nature\nof reproductions, but capable of being interpretated with some\nplausibility as applicable to incidents associated with the\nphrase in Dr. Verrall's mind or connected with the Tripos\nexamination in which it occurred. The passages in question are\n:\nAug. 20: \"The long room with the many windows is\nnear this hot room, he was outside.\"\nSept. 20: \"There were others there but he knew more\nthan the rest.\"\nSept. 9 :\n\" Find the herb inoly, that will help\u2014it is a\nguide.\"\n\f44 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nProfessor Pigou contends that if we suppose the four\npartially reproductive passages \" to have occurred in the\nwritings of separate automatists, we have all the conditions of\na typical cross-correspondence,\" and that the other three\npassages add a finishing touch to the analogy and make it\ncomplete. Let us pass this claim by for the moment, and\nenquire how far he has succeeded in proving that the com-\nplementary element in the case originated in the subliminal\nactivities of Dr. or Mrs. Yerrall or both.\nA satisfactory proof of subliminal origin must at least exclude\ntwo other possibilities\u2014origin from a discarnate intelligence, and\norigin from Dr. Verrall's supraliminal consciousness.\nProfessor Pigou dismisses the intervention of a discarnate\nintelligence on the ground of superfluity\u2014Dr. Verrall's conscious\nself being already there to discharge any function for the sake\nof which we might otherwise be tempted to invoke spiritual\nagency. There is no doubt force in this contention. We do\nnot invoke spiritual agency to explain thought-transference in\nthe case of Miss Miles and Miss Eamsden. Why, it may be\nasked, should we do so as between Dr. and Mrs. Verrall ?\nThe argument from superfluity is not perhaps absolutely\nconclusive, but at all events I do not propose to contest it.\nGranted, however, that we have no reason to call in the aid\nof discarnate intelligences, the possible agency of Dr. Verrall's\nconscious self still remains to be disposed of.\nProfessor Pigou, as we have seen, draws a distinction\nbetween a complementary correspondence and the comple-\nmentary element in a complementary correspondence. Replying\nto Sir Oliver Lodge in the Society's Journal of November,\n1909, he admits that the script relating to Dr. Verrall's test-\nwords \" did not originate in subliminal activities, but in Dr.\nVerrall's conscious purpose.\" To infer from the script that\na complementary correspondence can originate in subliminal\nactivity would not, in Professor Pigou's opinion, be legitimate.\nBut to infer from it that the complementary element in a\ncomplementary correspondence can so originate, is legitimate,\nfor the reason that \" it is clear that the complementary relation\nbetween Mrs. Verrall's different scripts formed no part of Dr.\nVerrall's intention.\"\nIf, however, intention is to be the test of origin, are we to\n\flxii.] Professor Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 45\nunderstand that Professor Pigou considers the complementary\nrelation between Mrs. Verrall's scripts to be due to intention\non the part of one or both of the subliminal consciousnesses at\nwork ? It would seem he ought to do so ; otherwise why is\nthe argument from absence of intention valid against origin\nin Dr. Verrall's conscious self, and not equally valid against\nsubliminal origin ? On the other hand the general tenor of\nProfessor Pigou's paper rather suggests that in his view the\ncomplementary element in this case (and therefore probably in\nall other cases) is not intentional at all, but is a kind of\nby-product arising out of the limitations to which subliminal\nagency is subject.\nThese inconsistent points of view have their root in an\nambiguity which seems to haunt Professor Pigou's argument\nthroughout. I have already called attention to it when dealing\nwith his inferences from the Kamsden-Miles experiments. We\nthen saw that in claiming for the subliminal consciousness\npower to bring about a simple correspondence, Professor Pigou\nused expressions which appear to imply, though without\ndefinitely affirming, that in this operation the subliminal self\nwas to be regarded as an agent acting with deliberate intention.\nThat, at least, appears to be the natural interpretation of the\nlanguage he employs, though its precise meaning is never,\nperhaps, made clear beyond the possibility of doubt.\nA similar obscurity meets us here in connection with\nProfessor Pigou's second proposition, and will meet us again in\nconnection with his third.\nComplementary correspondences may be divided, in respect of\ntheir complementary character, into two classes ; to the first\nbelong those in which the division of the idea as a whole into\ncomplementary parts or aspects seems to proceed upon a deliber-\nately calculated scheme or plan ; to the second, those of which\nthis cannot be said. Let us agree to call the former purposive,\nand the latter non-purposive\u2014descriptive terms which will also\napply to the complementariness, or complementary element, in\nthem.\nProfessor Pigou is of course alive to the distinction between\nthe two classes ;\nindeed, in speaking of the less complex comple-\nmentary cases he tells us himself that absence of intention\ndeprives the complementariness of all significance. On the other\n\f46 Rigid Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nhand he never clearly states\u2014I may almost say he is careful\nto avoid clearly stating\u2014whether in his opinion the comple-\nmentary element in the Verrall case is or is not intentional.\nHis argument seems to rest sometimes on one view, sometimes\non the other. When he contends that the complementary\nelement in the case could not have originated in Dr. Verrall's\nsupraliminal self because the complementary relation between\nMrs. Verrall's different scripts formed no part of Dr. Verrall's\nconscious intention, he is really employing a test which is\napplicable only to the purposive class : when he contends that\nit must therefore have originated in subliminal activities, this\ntest is dropped, the distinction between the two classes is\nallowed to fall into the background, and the reader is left free\nto treat the correspondence, if he so please, as purely non-\npurposive.\nNow, complementariness of the non-purposive order being, as\nProfessor Pigou says, \" of no significance,\" if the complementary\nelement in the Verrall case is wholly of this character, the\nsubliminal origin claimed for it is hardly worth calling in\nquestion. Nevertheless, it may be of use to point out that\neven for this lower form of complementariness Dr. Verrall's\nsupraliminal activities may have been largely responsible, and\nthat this possibility is not shut out by the mere fact that the\ncomplementary relation of Mrs. Verrall's scripts formed no part\nof Dr. Verrall's conscious intention. There are various ways\nin which complementariness of the non-purposive kind may be\nsupposed to arise. For instance, it might be the purely accidental\nresult of a number of tentative approximations to an idea which\nis never itself clearly grasped. Or it might have its source\nin the changing moods of the percipient, if there be only one\nas in the Verrall case, or in the idiosyncrasies of the different\npercipients if there be more than one, as in the cross-corre-\nspondences described in the Proceedings. Or again, it might\nresult incidentally from thought-transference from a consciousness\nwhich, without any deliberate intention to produce comple-\nmentariness, dwells now on one, now on another, aspect of the\nidea to be transferred, with corresponding modification of the\nimpressions produced.\nIf we consider the passages quoted by Professor Pigou as\ncontributing to form the complementary element in the Verrall\n\flxii.] Professor Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 47\ncase, we shall see reason to think, at least with respect\nto one, and that perhaps the most striking of all, that the\nexplanation last given is probably the true one. \" On\nSept. 18,\" writes Mrs. Verrall,1\n\"the script got vaguely hold\nof the only idea not hitherto reproduced, namely, that of\n'\nhorse '\nin the ordinary view of the meaning of \/j.ov6ttu>\\o<;,\n'\nhaving one horse.' \" (The writing on that date may be read\neunriro<;, i.e. of goodly horses, or et? 77T7ro?, i.e. one horse. The\nlatter is the reading adopted by Professor Pigou). \" On this\noccasion,\" continues Mrs. Verrall, \" while I was writing in one\nroom, my husband sitting in another definitely fixed his mind\non the notion of '\nhorse '\nwhich had so far been conspicuously\nabsent.\" In this instance, then, the evidence is entirely\nopposed to Professor Pigou's contention. Dr. Verrall, from his\nexamination of the script, knew that something was wanting\nand tried successfully to supply it.\nIndeed it might fairly be claimed for this particular contri-\nbution to the complementary element in the scripts that it\nreally did originate not merely in Dr. Verrall's conscious\nthought, but in his conscious purpose. And if each fragmentary\ncontribution had a similar history, we should be obliged, I\nthink, to class the correspondence as purposive, and attribute\nit wholly to Dr. Verrall's conscious self. As a matter of fact\nthis is not the case, and the complementariness, taken\naltogether, must, in my opinion, be classed as non-purposive.\nBut all the fragments cited by Professor Pigou, with one single\nexception, might, so far as we can tell, have had their origin\nin the conscious, though undesigned,2\ndirection of Dr. Verrall's\nthoughts at different times to different parts of the Greek\nphrase, to its general meaning, or to the various associations\nconnected with it. The one fragment concerning which we\ncan definitely say that his conscious self could not have been\nthe direct source of inspiration is the sentence \" Find the\nherb moly, that will help\u2014it is a guide.\" The connection of\nthe \"herb moly\" with the Classical Tripos of 1873 had been\nentirely forgotten by Dr. Verrall, and therefore the reference to\nit could not have been directly due to any conscious mental\nactivity on his part. But even here his desire to give \" a\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XX. p. 164.\n2\nI.e. undesigned so far as the production of complementariness is concerned.\n\f48 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nclue \" may have had some general influence on the script\nproduced, and have been the real motive power without which\nsubliminal activity could not have come into play.\nIt thus appears that if we make deduction of all the\ncontributions to the complementary element in the case which\nit is possible to ascribe to Dr. Verrall's conscious mental\nactivities, what is left is hardly sufficient to prove subliminal\norigin even of non-purposive complementariness against any one\nwho cared to dispute it ;\nwhile of evidence to prove that the\nproduction of purposive complementariness is within the powers\nof the subliminal self Professor Pigou has not brought forward\nso much as a vestige. In the absence of such evidence, his\nsecond proposition, even if true in a sense, will remain without\nrelevance to the general argument so long as there is ground\nfor suspecting purpose in the complementary element in any\nof the examples with which the Verrall case is put into\ncomparison.\nThis brings us to Professor Pigou's third proposition, which\nasserts that the complementary element in the Verrall case is\ncomparable in all essentials with what we find in the best\ncomplementary correspondences recorded in the Proceedings.\nIn examining the question here raised 1 may begin by\nclearing two considerations out of the way. They are not with-\nout interest, but they do not reach the heart of the matter.\nIn the first place, the things compared are, on the one side\ncomplementary fragments distributed between different auto-\nmatists, on the other side complementary fragments presented\nconsecutively in the script of a single automatist. Professor\nPigou himself calls attention to this difference, but only to\nset it aside as of no importance. I do not altogether agree\nwith him, but am ready for the nonce to accept his stand-\npoint and treat the complementary fragments in the Verrall\ncase as if they had been distributed contemporaneously among\nseveral scripts instead of appearing consecutively in one.\nIn the second place, if we had nothing before us but the\nisolated passages quoted by Professor Pigou from Mrs. Verrall's\nscript\u2014but which we are now to imagine scattered between\nvarious automatic writers\u2014it is more than doubtful whether\neven Mr. Piddington's ingenuity would ever have connected\n\fLXII.] Professor Pigou on Cross-Correspondences. 49\nthem together, or referred them to the fxovoirwXov e? am of\nEuripides. Both the connection and the reference really\ndepend on the knowledge we possess, apart from the script,\nconcerning Dr. Verrall's attempt at thought-transference. On\nthe other hand, in the best examples of cross-correspondences\nto be found in the Proceedings, either the complementary\nparts cohere sufficiently to tell their own tale to the\nintelligent student of the scripts, assisted, of course, by their\napproximately contemporaneous appearance, or the scripts\nthemselves give us helping hints enough to point our attention\nin the right direction.\nI do not insist further on the difference here indicated,\nbecause it may be urged that it is only one of degree ; and\nin many of the examples given in the Proceedings I should\nbe prepared to concede this. A little more or a little less of\ncoherence between the fragments might easily be sufficient on\nthe one hand to raise doubtful correspondences into certain\nones, on the other to prevent even the suspicion of a corre-\nspondence from ever arising.\nIn the best cases of complementary correspondence, however,\nI believe the difference is not merely of degree, but of kind.\nIt is the old issue once more\u2014presence or absence of design.\nBut the old issue is also the important one, and I do not\nthink Professor Pigou has fairly faced it.\nAs I have already said, the complementary element in the\nVerrall case, taken as a whole, must be regarded as non-\npurposive. If we were justified in assuming that the com-\nplementary element in all other cases known to us was\nnon-purposive, then I should be willing to admit that the\ncomplementary fragments in the Verrall case, if distributed\nbetween several autotnatists, presented a fair, though by no\nmeans a favourable, example of the class generally. But to\nassume this would be an obvious begging of the question.\nFor suppose a single case in which there was good reason to\ninfer a purposive correspondence either from the form of the\nfragments and their interrelation, or from some indication\ngiven in the script itself, then, so far as that case was con-\ncerned, the analogy of the Verrall case would have broken\ndown. A correspondence of the purposive class is not in all\nessentials comparable with one of the non-purposive class.\nD\n\f50 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nI do not suggest that Professor Pigou has been guilty of\nthis obvious petitio principii. But the procedure he has\nadopted leads insensibly to much the same practical result.\nHe does not in so many words affirm that the complementary\nelement in all correspondences is non-purposive. He simply\navoids the point altogether. The question of intention, he now\ntells us, is a secondary one. According to him a more satisfactory\nmethod of procedure is \" to leave it aside altogether, and ask\nquite directly :\n'\nDo the complementary correspondences, the\nauthorship of which is now under investigation, differ in any\nmarked degree from other complementary correspondences that\nwe have grounds for attributing to subliminal agency ?\n'\nThis,\" he adds, \" is all we need : for if the answer is in the\nnegative, we know, without delving behind the facts for\nexplaining intentions, that the phenomena which we are study-\ning fall within the capacity of subliminal agents, and therefore,\non the principles here adopted, are probably due to them.\"\nI venture to think that Professor Pigou's supposed improve-\nment in method is no improvement at all, and that its\nadoption has led to unfortunate results. For I do not believe\nit possible to make a useful comparison between the comple-\nmentary correspondences in the Proceedings and the novoirwkov\ncase, without asking the very question which he eliminates\nas being of secondary importance. It may not always be\neasy to answer the question with confidence ; but unless we\nask it, it will be still more difficult to decide whether there\nis a \" marked degree of difference \" between any given\ncomplementary correspondence and the one which he sets up\nas a standard of comparison. To ask whether the comple-\nmentary element in a correspondence is purposive or non-\npurposive is a help, not a hindrance, in determining whether\nit differs \" in a marked decree \" from that which Dr. Verrall's\nD\nexperiment exhibits.\nIt seems to me that we are entitled to press Professor\nPigou for an answer to these two questions : First, does the\nrelation of the complementary fragments in the Verrall case\nshow design, or does it not ? Secondly, is there or is there\nnot any ground for inferring design in the distribution of the\ncomplementary fragments between different automatists in the\nbest examples to be found in the Proceedings ? In his paper\n\flxil] Professor Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 5J\nhe has avoided a definite answer to either question ; but if\nbrought to bay and compelled to reply, I think he must\nneeds answer both in the negative, or else frankly abandon his\nsecond and third propositions as untenable.\nMy own answer to the first of these questions has already\nbeen given. The complementary element in the Verrall case\nis in my judgment non-purposive\u2014or if any trace of purpose\ncan be detected in it, we must ascribe this to Dr. Verrall's\nconscious desire to till up an observed gap in the automatic\nscript, and not to the subliminal activities either of himself or\nof Mrs. Verrall. The second question still awaits discussion.\nIf it can be answered in the affirmative\u2014if, that is, it be\npossible to show that the complementary element in the best\ncross-correspondences is purposive\u2014the counter-case to be made\nin reply to Professor Pigou's paper will be complete.\nThis aspect of the subject was discussed in an article\ncontributed by me to the Eibbert Journal of January, 1909,\nshortly after Mr. Piddington's paper on \" Concordant Auto-\nmatisms\n\" 1\nappeared, and I am unwilling to labour over the\nsame ground again. I will therefore deal with it as briefly\nas I can.\nI had occasion to point out, earlier in this paper, that a\nsimple correspondence, that is to say, a straightforward con-\ncordance between two or more automatic scripts, cannot be\nmade to yield proof that an intelligent will has been at work\nto produce the concordance. Evidence of intention in such a\ncase can only come from something added to the concordance\n\u2014for instance, a subsequently verified claim in the script\nitself that a given word or idea is the subject of a corre-\nspondence which has been, is being, or is about to be\nproduced under conditions which exclude normal communica-\ntion between the automatists.\nComplementary correspondences have in this respect an\nadvantage over simple ones. Evidence that the complementari-\nness is intentional may be derived not only from supplementary\nindication of purpose afforded by statements in the script, but\nalso from the distribution of the complementary parts and\nthe nature of the relations between them.\nTo illustrate this, let us suppose that four automatists sit\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XXII.\n\f52 Rigid Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nindependently on the same day, and produce scripts each of\nwhich contains a reference to the Ace of Hearts. Here we\nhave a simple correspondence, and there is nothing in the\nnature of the concordance between the scripts to prove that\nit may not have resulted from the blind operation of psychical\nlaws, and not at all from the deliberate action of an intelligent\nwill.\nNext suppose that instead of all four scripts containing a\nreference to the Ace of Hearts, one of them mentions the Ace\nof Hearts, another the Ace of Diamonds, a third the Ace\nof Clubs, and the fourth the Ace of Spades. Here we have\na complementary correspondence. The complete idea would be\nthe combined aces of the pack, and the distribution of a\ndifferent ace to each automatist cannot but suggest the\npossibility that design, and not merely chance, has been at\nwork.\nLet me now take a very extreme illustration, and suppose\nthat instead of four automatists we have fifty- two, and that\neach separate script names a different card of the pack. In\nthis case the complete idea is evidently the whole pack, and\nthe distribution and mutual relation of its parts is such as to\nmake the presence of design a practical certainty.\nI repeat, this is an extreme illustration, and I do not for\na moment pretend that any real example we can point to\napproaches it for cogency. But that some of the examples in\nthe Proceedings do make probable the existence of design in\nthe distribution and relation of the complementary parts is a\nconclusion which I find it difficult to resist. Two of the best\ncases of this kind are described in Mr. Piddington's paper\nunder the headings \" Light in West \" and \" Euripides.\" 1\nAs\nregards these, I may perhaps be allowed to refer to my article\nin the Hibbert Journal, where they are dealt with at some\nlength. Here is another example which I choose for its com-\nparative simplicity.\nOn the 16th of April, 1907, Mrs. Holland, in India,\nproduced a script of which these were the opening sentences :\nMaurice. Morris. Mors.\nAnd with that the shadow of death fell upon him, and his\nsoul departed out of Iris limbs.\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XXII. pp. 241-281.\n\flxil] Professor Pigoit on Cross-Correspondences. 53\nOn the following clay, during the waking-stage of Mrs. Piper's\ntrance, the word Sanatos was uttered, but altered immediately\nafterwards to Tanatos. There can be no doubt that this was\na misapprehension or mispronunciation of Thanatos ; and on\nthe 23rd the word emerged in its correct form. {Thanatos\nis of course the Greek, and Mors the Latin, for Death).\nOn the 29 th of April Mrs. Verrall wrote a piece of script\nwholly occupied with references to Death. It contained, inter\nalia, no less than four quotations, one from Landor, one from\nVirgil, one from Horace, and one from Shakespeare, all directly\ninvolving the idea of death, although, as Mr. Piddington justly\nremarks, the word itself seems to be studiously shunned.\nMors indeed occurs in the passage from Horace ; but the\nShakespearian quotation \"Come away, come away, [Death]\"\nappears in a truncated form with the significant noun omitted.\nOn the 30th Mrs. Piper again uttered the word Thanatos\nduring the waking-stage, repeating it three times over in\nclose succession.\nIn this case the same idea is expressed by all three\nautomatists, and the complementary element lies in what\nseems to be a calculated difference of form. Mrs. Piper is\ntotally ignorant of Greek : Mrs. Holland is quite unfamiliar\nwith Latin. Yet Mrs. Piper's utterance is confined to the\nbare Greek equivalent, which she evidently does not under-\nstand ;\nthe Latin equivalent is the prominent word in Mrs.\nHolland's script ; and the emergence in both cases suggests a\nsound heard rather than an idea apprehended, the Maurice,\nMorris, Mors of Mrs. Holland answering to the Sanatos,\nTanatos, Thanatos of Mrs. Piper. Meanwhile in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript there appears to be a deliberate avoidance of the word\n\" death,\" the idea being conveyed entirely by means of literary\nallusions.\nI should be strongly inclined to suspect intelligent purpose\nin the peculiarities of an arrangement like this, even without\ntaking into account the numerous intimations of intention so\noften given by the scripts in connection with cross-correspon-\ndences. But these intimations cannot be ignored if we are\nto form a right judgment on the question now before us. No\ndoubt in most instances the claim put forward in the scripts\nonly applies to the production of a cross-correspondence, not\n\f54 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour. [part\nto the production of a complementary element in it. The\nlatter would of course imply the former, but not vice versd.\nPassages may also be found, however, which must be con-\nstrued as intimations that the distribution of different parts of\nan idea to different automatists is intentional. The Ave Roma\nimmortalis correspondence, which is one of the two selected by\nProfessor Pigou for comparison with the Verrall case, is an\ninstance in point. The completed idea here is that of a well-\nknown picture in the Vatican. Mrs. Verrall's script gives\nvarious details of the picture, unmeaning to herself, but all\nbrought into an intelligible whole by the phrase Ave Roma,\nimmortalis occurring a few days later in Mrs. Holland's script.\nThe nature and distribution of the complementary parts in this\ncase may be faintly suggestive of design, but are certainly\nnot unmistakeably so. On the other hand their appearance in\neach script is accompanied by comments which throw further\nlight on the matter. For on March 2nd, when the cross-\ncorrespondence begins, Mrs. Verrall is told by the script that\nword will be sent her \" through another lady,\" and that after\nsome days she will easily understand what the scribe says\n:\nand on March 7th, when the cross-correspondence ends, Mrs.\nHolland's contribution is followed by the words \" How could\nI make it any clearer without giving her the clue ?\n\" These\ntwo comments taken together can only mean (1) that a cross-\ncorrespondence was being deliberately brought about ; (2) that\nthe complementary element in it was purposive, the object\nbeing to keep back from Mrs. Verrall a clue-giving fragment\nof the whole idea.\nFor another very interesting illustration of the way in which\nthe intentional and purposive character of a cross-correspondence\ncan be brought out by comments in the script itself I may\nrefer to the \" Sesame and Lilies \" case, published in the latest\nvolume of the Proceedings?- since Professor Pigou's paper was\nwritten.\nLet me now try to summarise the results of this long dis-\ncussion. If I am right, Professor Pigou's argument fails at\nalmost every point.\nThe Eamsden-Miles experiments do not prove that a simple\ncorrespondence can originate in subliminal activities apart from\n1\nVol. XXIV. pp. 264-3-26.\n\flxii.] Professor Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 55\nthe conscious will of a supraliminal self. Still less do they\nprove that a subliminal self acting on its own account can\ndeliberately produce a simple correspondence.\nThe Verrall experiment does not prove that the comple-\nmentary element in a purposive correspondence can originate in\nsubliminal activities. Even as regards complementariness of\nthe non-purposive order the experiment seems to prove little\nor nothing. But complementariness of this kind has no special\nsignificance. We may readily admit the probability that its\nsource is often subliminal ; and in a sense, therefore, it may\nbe said to be within the powers of the subliminal self to\nproduce it. In this connection, however, it would be less mis-\nleading to speak of the impotence, or the limitations, of the\nsubliminal self than of its powers.\nFinally, Professor Pigou's contention that the complementary\nelement in the Verrall case\n1\nis in all essentials similar to that\nof the best correspondences to be found in the Proceedings is\nnot, in my opinion, tenable. His argument tacitly implies\neither that all these correspondences are non-purposive, or else\nthat purposiveness is a negligible feature in the cases which\nshow evidence of it. The latter alternative has nothing to\ncommend it : the former does not appear to me to be borne\nout by the facts.\nMy conclusion is that Professor Pigou has not succeeded in\nproving that the production of complementary correspondences\nof the best type is within the known capacities of the sub-\nliminal self. It may, indeed, be within the capacities of the\nsubliminal self to plan and carry out such complementary\ncorrespondences : but this is hypothesis, and until it is proved\nwe are entitled to set against it another hypothesis, and to\nsuspend judgment between the two. I confess that this is\nstill my own attitude. It is no easy matter to find firm\nground anywhere ;\nwe must continue to feel our way cautiously\nin more than one direction. At the same time, I doubt\nwhether any final verdict is likely to be reached along the\nlines followed by Professor Pigou. He rests the whole weight\nof his argument on experimental telepathy. Now, in experi-\nmental telepathy we must, from the very nature of the case,\nstart from supraliminal activity. Starting from supraliminal\nx\nFor additional Note by Mrs. Verrall oa this case, see below, p. 109.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f56 Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour.

Everard Feilding and W. Marriott.\nNaples, December 5th, 1910.\nWith a view to attempting to confirm either the favourable\nreport on Eusapia Palladino issued by Messrs. Feilding,\nBaggally and Carrington, published in Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.\n(Part LIX., November, 1909), or the unfavourable one by\nMr. W. S. Davis in the American S.P.R. Journal for August,\n1910, a short series of five sittings was held in Naples in\nNovember and December, 1910. The sitters were as follows:\nStances I. and II.\u2014Count and Countess Perovsky-Petrovo-\nSolovovo and Mr. Feilding.\nSeance III.\u2014Count Solovovo, Mr. W. Marriott, Mr. Feilding.\n\u201e IV.\u2014As in No. III. and Countess Solovovo.\nV.\u2014Mr. Marriott and Mr. Feilding.\nAt Seance I. the control was at the time considered so\nunsatisfactory that, although fraud was not specifically proved,\nneither Count Solovovo nor Mr. Feilding is disposed to attach\nany evidential importance to the few small phenomena which\noccurred.\nSeance II. was the only one at which, with the possible\nexception of table levitations, any phenomena of the slightest\ninterest occurred. They were, however, of so insignificant a\ncharacter that, especially in the light of the possible fraud at\n\f58 Farther Sittings with Eusdpia Palladino. [part\nthe first Seance, and the undoubted fraud in the last three,\nnone of the three sitters is disposed to draw any positive\nconclusions. Seances III., IV., and V. were in the opinion of\nall those present unquestionably mainly, and in the opinion\nof Mr. Marriott wholly, fraudulent. The medium evaded\nthroughout any effective control, frequently making it impossible\nfor the sitter on her left side to prevent her from releasing\nher left hand or foot, and took advantage of this to make\nconstant use of them, as well as of her elbow, for the\nproduction of spurious phenomena. Such phenomena con-\nsisted of (1) shaking movements of the curtain, throwings of\nit over her shoulder, surreptitious pullings at it with her hands\nor elbow, kickings at it with her feet. (2) Touches with her\nleft foot on her neighbours. (3) Upsetting of the cabinet table\nwith her elbow. (4) Moving of a chair with her foot. (5)\nLifting of the cabinet table with her hand after effecting its\nrelease,\u2014not by substitution, but merely by removing it from the\nback of the controller's hand, this position being the only form\nof control she would usually permit. As regards this last effect,\nit may be added that though Messrs. Feildiug and Marriott\ndistinctly saw the movement of the medium's hand and arm\nagainst a background of luminous paint, Countess Solovovo,\nwho was controlling the hand in question on the table and\nunder the curtain, had the distinct impression of its continuous\ngrasp. Count Solovovo is inclined to consider the hypothesis\nof some abnormal suggestive influence on the part of the medium\nto account for this impression.\nWith this tentative exception, all the sitters are agreed\nthat the whole of the above-named phenomena were entirely\nfraudulent. As regards the table movements, consisting, in the\nlast three seances, of only one total and two partial levitations,\nMr. Marriott is strongly of opinion that these also were\nfraudulent, inferring from the position of the hands that they\nwere accomplished by a balance of the table between the left\nhand and foot, and by an upward throw of her (E. P.'s) fingers\nrespectively. Mr. Feildiug, who was actually observing the\nhands at the time, disputes the conclusion that these actions\ndid, in fact, take place, but is not disposed to lay any stress\nupon a few phenomena sporadically occurring among others of\nan unquestionably fraudulent character. He is further of\n\flxil] Farther Sittings with Euscipia Palladino. 59\nopinion that the table movements were the only phenomena\nwhich in any way resembled the occurrences at the former\nNaples series of experiments, and states that the conditions of\ncontrol permitted were wholly different from those permitted\nin that series.\nThe seances in question appear identical with the seances\ndescribed by Mr. Davis. The medium pleaded illness and\nfatigue throughout, and although it had been intended to hold\na series of ten or twelve seances, it was not thought worth\nwhile to continue any longer in the circumstances.\nAt the termination of the series Eusapia was informed of\nthe negative conclusions which had been arrived at and of the\nspurious nature of the phenomena which had been presented.\nWhile not disputing the justice of these conclusions, she stated\nthat she had no recollection of anything that transpired after\nthe close of the table movements which usually occupy the\nfirst part of her sittings, after which the light is reduced for\nother phenomena. She pleaded her state of health as an\nexcuse for her failure to give satisfaction. She nevertheless\naccepted her full fee.\nIT.\nStatement by Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nDecember, 1910.\nWhilst substantially agreeing with the above report, I feel\nbound to make the following reservations and observations\n:\nWith regard to Seance II. some of the things which happened\nimpressed me favourably. I was twice touched on my right\nside ; a little table in the \" cabinet \" was suddenly and violently\noverturned ; and one of the objects which then fell off it\nmoved along the floor for a very appreciable period of time.\nThe hand and foot control seemed to me very satisfactory ; at\nleast we repeatedly said so at the time, and 1 wrote so in my\nnotes the day after. I think in such incidents it is the im-\npression felt at the time of the occurrence (I am speaking of\nexperienced enquirers only) which must really count\u2014-not the\none produced by subsequent unfavourable circumstances (unless\nrevealing sources of error hitherto unsuspected), or even merely\n\" as time goes on.\" Of course into my expressed conviction\n\f60 Farther Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. [part\nof the efficacy of the hand-control there entered even at the\ntime an appreciable element of uncertainty due to the fact that,\nas usual, E. P. did not allow her hand to be grasped (I will\nrevert to this point). In my note on the sitting in question\nI say also that \" the conviction 1 here express . . . does not\napply to the possible hypothetical use of an apparatus.\"\nWith regard to Seance III. and the incident in connection\nwith my wife controlling, it should be noted that at the time\nthe table was lifted up as if by Eusapia's hand, her right hand\nivas linlcecl with F.'s on the table uncovered and dimly visible (as\nstated in my note written out on the next day), whereas her\nleft was 'under the curtain (also upon the table) and invisible.\nOur impression at the time (as expressed by E.) was that\n\" substitution was impossible \" (see my next day note). And to\nquote my wife's words in her written statement (made the\nnext day) :\n\" I positively deny having lost contact with E. P.'s\nhand a single moment during the incident described.\"\nI may mention that before our sittings had begun I had\nsaid to Mr. Feilding that it seemed to me very desirable to\nmake some decisive step in advance with regard to the con-\nditions of the \" phenomena,\" and in view of all the doubts\nand discussions to which the question of hand-holding with\nE. P. gives rise, I suggested that we should \" count\" only\nthose \" phenomena \" which should occur with at least one of\nthe meelium's hands visible. Neither of us seemed afterwards\ninclined to adhere unreservedly to so high a standard ! But\nin the incident under consideration we seem to have come\nwithin measurable distance of it ! And though the unavoidable\nlack of information as to certain particulars\u2014for instance as\nto the exact distance separating Eusapia's two hands\u2014is much\nto be regretted, this occurrence has on the whole seemed to\nme to be very instructive and tending to give support to the\ntheory that a \" medium \" is occasionally able\u2014whether con-\nsciously or unconsciously\u2014to induce in the person controlling\nhim something like a tactile hallucination, for which view\nthere is to my mind very strong evidence on record in the\n\"chair-threading\" experiments with Sambor. 1\n1\nThese experiments (at least those made with this special aim by myself and\nmy friends) have absolutely convinced me that either passage of matter\nthrough matter is a fact, or that a medium's hand, even when very well held\n\flxii.] Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 61\nWith regard to the table movements, I agree with Mr.\nFeikling in thinking most of them inconclusive ; but I con-\nsider that one partial table-levitation (away from Eusapia) which\nwe witnessed at the end of the third sitting, in a bright\nlight, three persons (Mr. Feikling, Mr. Meeson, the stenographer,\nand myself) controlling E. P. and Mr. Marriott looking on, was\nrather remarkable, and I thought it difficult at the time to\nadmit that Mr. Marriott's explanation (as given in the report)\ncould be the true one. I may add that from what he told me\nI inferred that he had not actually seen E. P. throw up the table\nwith her fingers, but had concluded that this was her method.\nOn the whole, and though I am by no means absolutely\ncertain that any table movements and levitations we witnessed\nwere genuine, I think that here is matter for further investi-\ngation. The conditions under which these things occur make\nme think that they are or may be suitable for scientific\nenquiry and I hope they may be investigated again. Even an\nexposure of E. P.'s levitations so extremely damaging to her\nmediumistic reputation as W. S. Davis's does not explain\neverything, and gives us no right whatsoever to answer the\nquestion definitely in the negative.\nOn the other hand, E. P.'s \" cabinet phenomena,\" as I\nhave witnessed them (both in Naples in 1910 and in St.\nPetersburg in 1898), have left me under the impression\nthat here matters ought to be seriously mended before we in-\nvestigate them further. I agree with Mr. Marriott in thinking\nthat the hand control she usually admits when such \" pheno-\nmena \" occur is practically non-existent. She throws every\nobstacle in the way of this hand control. In my experience,\nat least, she constantly objected to my holding even her thumb\nor her little finger. She constantly complained of my squeez-\n(not in the least as Eusapia's hands are), can liberate itself, and afterwards\nreturn to its original position without the controller becoming aware of it.\nAnd after some conversations I had on the subject with Mr. Marriott (an\nexpert in conjuring) I am even more than before inclined to see in this \"chair-\nthreading\" some unusual form of \"supernormal suggestion,'' and shall not\nbelieve this to have been a trick in the ordinary sense of the word until I\nhave been shown the same thing by a regular conjurer.\nOn the other hand, I still maintain that we have no good evidence whatever\nof the possible production of collective hallucinations at spiritistic seances,\nvisual or other [Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XXI., pp. 436-482).\n\f62 Further Sittings vnth Eusapia Palladino. [part\ning her hand too much. She insisted on her hands being\ncovered (with the curtain), and even asked that they should\nbe brought nearer to one another, and this at the most\nsuccessful sitting of the series,\u2014the 2nd ! The hand-sub-\nstitution I noticed repeatedly. Apart from this, she constantly\nchanges the respective positions of her limbs\u2014both feet and\nhands. The latter especially are a regular pierpetuum mobile.\nNow this circumstance is extremely important, for as the\nconditions of the control are perpetually and ceaselessly\nchanging, illusions of memory as to the exact conditions under\nwhich something occurred are eminently apt to spring up.\nOf course the presence of a shorthand writer will to a great\nextent eliminate this source of error ;\nbut, seeing that no\nshorthand writer was present at the great majority of obser-\nvations in the case of E. P., my present impression is that the\ngreat bulk of the evidence re her \" cabinet-phenomena \" is of\nno decisive importance.\nIn my experience, then, with such control as E. P. admits,\ncomplete conviction in the true sense of the word is strictly speaking\nunattainable. And what, I ask, is the use of \" relative convic-\ntion \" like the one, say, I felt as to the efficacy of the control\nat Seance II. ? The fact that I had this impression at the\ntime is interesting ; but it does not carry us one step further.\nAt most we are driven to the \" supernormal suggestion \" theory.\nAt future scientific seances E. P. must either allow her hands\nto be plainly visible to all, or allow them to be grasped (as\nSambor invariably did, as I have said, during the experiments\nwith the \" chairs,\" thus giving something amounting to absolute\nconviction). The foot-control, in which she places her foot\nupon that of her neighbour, should also be done away with.\nThese demands are eminently reasonable. It is simply prepos-\nterous to assert that they could act negatively on the \" pheno-\nmena.\" Enough time, money and work has already been spent,\nand strictly speaking to no avail. A new departure must be\nmade at last.\nIf E. P. consents to the above conditions, well and good\n;\nif she does not, she must either be left alone ; or\u2014a course\nof action I should recommend\u2014in future experiments we should\nno longer investigate the \" cabinet-phenomena \" themselves, but\nthe conditions of the control at the time such \"phenomena \" are\n\flxil] Farther Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 63\noccurring. Any \" manifestations \" taking place with both of\nE. P.'s hands invisible (supposing they are controlled as un-\nsatisfactorily as they are now) should not be taken into account\nat all. And particular attention should be given to making\nclear whether anything will happen with either one or both of\nthe medium's hands visible. In the former case we shall\nhave to give full weight to the \" supernormal suggestion\n\"\ntheory ; and only in the latter\u2014if positive results are obtained\n\u2014shall we really have to face the hypothesis of a new \" physical\nforce \" and the like. If, on the contrary, after a new series\nof experiments it is clearly shown that no \" cabinet-phenomena\n\"\noccur when both the medium's hands are visible, this negative\nconclusion will be also very important and will make it\nprobable that in former experiments too we need not look\nbeyond errors of observation, illusions of memory, etc. (coupled\nperhaps sometimes with some kind of \" suggestion \") to account\nfor the most puzzling of Signora Palladino's performances.\nOf course the question of the foot-control too is of vital\nimportance, since I, for my part, have little doubt that the\nmedium's feet may more than once have played a fundamental\npart in \" spirit \" touches and grasps.\nIII.\nDetailed Account of the Table-Lifting Incident.\n(a) Extract from Mr. Feilding's Notes on Seances\nIII. and IV. {November 26 and 28, 1910.)\nDecember 1, 1910.\nIn the course of the two seances the \" phenomena \" pro-\nduced consisted of a few raps of doubtful origin, apparently\nnot in the table ; a few slides of the table of about an inch\nat a time, not shown to be fraudulent but under unsatisfactory\nconditions ;\nan upsetting of the cabinet table to all appearances\naccomplished by [E. P.'s] elbow; bulgings of the dress (quite unlike\nany bulgings which I have previously seen) and apparently\ndone with the foot ; a few movements of the curtain clearly\nseen to have been done with the hand after substitution had\nbeen effected ; a movement of a chair close to the medium,\n\f64 Farther Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. [part\nevidently done by the foot after substitution bad actually been\nnotified ; and the lifting of the cabinet table clearly seen by\nMarriott and myself against a card of luminous paint to have\nbeen done with the hand controlled by Countess Solovovo.\nAlso one total and two or three partial levitations, as to which\nthere is a difference of opinion between Marriott and the rest\nof us. It would be absurd to lay stress on small matters of\nthis kind following on a series of purely fraudulent phenomena.\nThe chief point of interest is the lifting of the cabinet table\nvisibly by Eusapia's hand, notwithstanding that the Countess\ninsisted on her not having lost control of the hand in questioc\nNo substitution had been effected, her right hand being visible\nin mine, and the only apparent alternatives are either the\nformation of a fiuidic hand on Countess Solovovo's (a theory\nput forward by Cavaliere Chiaja) to lift the table ; or else a\nmere lapse in her observation. Taking the case on its own\nmerits, the latter is of course the more reasonable assumption.\n(b) Note on Seance of November 28, 1910.\nBy Count Solovovo.\nNovember 29th, 1910.\nMy wife controlling all the time on E. P.'s left, F., Mr.\nMarriott, Meeson, then E. again on her right.\nThe seance may be safely put clown as\u2014to say the least\u2014of\nan extremely suspicious character throughout, with, however,\none exception. At a certain moment when an attempt was\nbeing \" mediumistically \" made to pick up something in the\ncabinet from the floor, F., who was controlling E. P. on her\nright, saw against a luminous background E. P.'s left arm pro-\nducing the movement. Mr. Marriott, who was under the table\nholding E. P.'s feet, saw the same thing. The medium's right\nhand, linked with F.'s, was on the table uncovered and dimly\nvisible. The medium's left hand, which my wife controlled,\nwas also upon the table, but covered with part of the curtain.\nOn E. asking my wife whether she had not let E. P.'s hand\ngo, she emphatically denied it, stating that E. P., though not\nallowing her to hold her hand all the time in the proper sense,\ndid not withdraw it for a single moment, and repeatedly\nclutched at it.\n\flxii.] Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 65\nAs F. said at the time, substitution was impossible. I also\ndimly saw E. P.'s right hand linked with his over or on the table.\nMy wife's conviction that at the time she had not released\nthe medium's hand was absolute. But it is of course possible\nthat after being told over and over again by that cleverest of\nconjurers, Mr. Marriott, that she was mistaken, she may feel less\ncertain about the matter. But we should not allow such\nsuggestions to work\u2014whether one way or the other ; and in\njustice to E. P. my wife's original and complete conviction\nshould be put on record.\n(c) Note by Countess Solovovo.\nNovember 29th, 1910.\nI positively deny having lost contact with Eus. P.'s hand a\nsingle moment during the incident described, and, as my hand\nwith her left one was under the curtain, on the table, whereas\nher right was visible, though it is true very dimly, and held\nby F., and not near enough to mine to touch me with it, she\nwas not able to make one of her hands do duty for two.\n[In reply to questions, the following further details of the\nincident were sent to us by Countess Solovovo.\u2014Ed.]\nJanuary 16 th, 1911.\n(1) I was holding E. P.'s hand very lightly, because she\ncomplained of being scpieezed too tightly each time I tried to\nhold her hand fully in mine, and most of the time she had\nher hand on my hand and pressed it very strongly each time\na movement occurred, or was patting it, but not for a second\ndid I lose contact with it ; and when Mr. FeildinQ said :\n\" She\nis using her hand, because I saw it clearly trying to lift up\nthe little table,\" I did not think he was speaking of the hand\n\/ held (I was so sure of having had it on mine all the\ntime), and when he told me I must have let it go, I posi-\ntively denied it, and up till now I am as sure as one can\nbe of anything that she did not use the hand that was in\nmine (or on mine).\n(2) Her hand was not motionless, for, as I said before, she\nmoved it about over mine, patted me, pressed my hand very\nstrongly sometimes, sometimes let me hold hers fully in mine,\nE\n\f66 Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. [part\nthen would turn my hand down and put hers over, but all\nthe time without taking it off entirely ; and when her hand\nwas over mine, I several times turned my hand and felt with\nmy fingers if her fingers were on my hand, and each time I\nfelt them I tried to do the same thing with my thumb, and\nI felt also that it was the same hand I held all the time.\nOur hands were on the table and covered by the end of the\nleft part of the curtain.\n(3) My attention was all the time concentrated on holding\nher hand, as I was sure of her foot, Mr. Marriott controlling\nboth feet under the table. He told me a few days later\nthat most likely my attention had been too much concen-\ntrated on holding her hand, and that on account of the\ntension of my mind I had not remarked when she had\nslipped away from me ; but I am sure that if I had said\nmy mind had been quite free during the time I held her,\nand that I was not entirely and only occupied in observing\nthe hand I held, Mr. Marriott would have said I had been\n\" distraite,\" and had not remarked when Eusapia took away\nher hand.\nI think also that, had she taken away her hand for a\nshort time and afterwards brought it back again, I should\nhave felt a difference in my sensations before and after she\nhad removed her hand, whereas I felt no difference at all,\nand continued feeling her hand in or on mine.\nThe little table was not lifted on to the table we sat at\n(as far as I remember, perhaps I am wrong); it seems to me\nit was lifted behind the curtain and then fell down again.\nBut it was only Mr. Feilding and Mr. Marriott who could see\nwhat was going on behind the curtain ; I could not, as I was\nnot sitting facing the opening in the middle of the curtain,\nbut just behind it ; that is, the left half of the curtain was\nopened in the middle, near E. P.'s head and shoulder, and, as\nI was sitting on her left-hand side, I could not see what was\ngoing on inside the cabinet unless I bent very much forward,\nand at that moment I was absorbed only in attending to the\nhand I held.\nMy impression is that she did not use her left hand in\nlifting the little table, and during all the sitting it seemed to\nme she was trying very hard to move the objects, but not\n\flxii.] Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. 67\nwith her physical hands, but with some inner power, and she\nseemed to suffer and to be very tired each time something\nhad moved.\nI think this is all I remember of the sitting ; it is very\nincomplete, but I have a very bad memory for details, and\nremember only my impressions.\nBarbara Perovsky-Solovovo.\nIV.\nComments on the Above.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nCountess Solovovo's careful and detailed description of her\nsensations during this incident seems to me to show clearly that\nit was not, as Mr. Feilding suggests, through any \" mere lapse\nin her observation \" that she let Eusapia's hand go ; while\nthe fact that the hand had somehow become free was proved\nby the joint observations of Mr. Feilding and Mr. Marriott.\nA lapse of attention or observation is a thing that frequently\noccurs in ordinary life ;\neverybody must be familiar with the\nexperience of failing to notice an object directly within his\nview when he is thinking of something else. In some cases this\nmay almost amount to what is called a \" negative hallucination.\"\nBut this is quite different from what Countess Solovovo\ndescribes. Instead of failing to notice the presence of an\nobject, she had a clear perception of its presence while it was\nabsent : that is, she had a distinct and full-blown positive\nhallucination or illusion, lasting evidently for a perceptible\nperiod of time.\nI am especially interested in this, because I have long\nbeen convinced that a similar experience happened to me\nduring my second sitting with Eusapia at Cambridge in\n1895. On that occasion Eusapia was standing up, Mr.\nMyers standing on one side and holding her right arm and\nhand, and I on the other side holding her left arm and hand,\nmy right arm being interlaced with her left. The two other\npersons present were sitting on the floor behind her, so as to\nsee her dimly outlined against the white ceiling, the room\nbeing extremely dark. These witnesses saw an elongated\n\f68 Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. [part\nobject proceeding from her body, moving about and often\nchanging in shape and length. It was too dark for them to\nsee how it was attached to her, or how the controllers were\nholding her ; but if her left arm had got free, it could easily\nhave executed all the movements, and in doing so would have\npresented just the appearance they described. The evidence\nthat the arm was not free depended solely on my conviction\nthat I was holding it. I was certain at the time that I was\nholding it ; but later, in view not only of the systematic\nfrauds discovered, but also of my observations of various illu-\nsions experienced at these sittings, I became convinced that\nmy impressions as to holding her arm on that occasion were\npurely hallucinatory.\nThe evidence for this is, of course, not so clear as in Countess\nSolovovo's case, since at the Cambridge sitting it was too dark\nfor the witnesses actually to see whether the elongated object\nwas Eusapia's arm or not ; and as they supposed at the time\nthat I was holding the arm, they took the object to be\nsomething else. At the Naples sitting there was more light,\nfor the background was of luminous paint instead of an ordinary\nwhite-washed ceiling, and here the arm that lifted the small\ntable was seen to be attached normally to Eusapia's left shoulder.\nIf it had been too dark to see this, the sitters would probably\nhave regarded the movement as supernormally performed, on\nthe strength of Countess Solovovo's conviction\u2014apparently so\nwell founded\u2014that she was holding Eusapia's left hand.\nIn my paper \" On the Education of the Sitter \" (Proceedings,\nVol. XXL, pp. 483-511) I brought forward evidence derived\nfrom various different sources in support of the hypothesis\nthat some mediums have an unusual power of imposing illusions\nand hallucinations on their sitters, and that this may account\nfor some of the most remarkable records of apparently telekinetic\nphenomena. The case described above tends to confirm this\nhypothesis. It does not, of course, explain all the phenomena\nreported on good evidence to have occurred in the presence of\nEusapia ; but it suggests that those which depend for their\nauthenticity on the testimony of one witness as to the control\nexercised\u2014and a considerable proportion of the best cases come\nunder this definition\u2014must be seriously discounted.\n\fLXir.] Further Sittings with Eusapia Palladino. Git\nV.\nNote on the Eepokt.\nBy W. W. Baggally.\nI should like to make a few remarks on the above Beport.\nBoth the American sittings and those lately held with Eusapia\nBallaclino differ materially in many respects, but principally in\nthe following, from those held by Mr. Feilding, Mr. Carrington\nand myself in Dec. 1908. In the American and in the\nrecent Naples sittings no phenomena were obtained under the\nfollowing conditions :\n\" when both the medium's hands were\ndistinctly visible away from or quietly resting on the seance\ntable, or both hands clearly seen when being held by the\ncontrollers and at the same time her body was in view down\nto her feet.\" In these cases the supposition that the phenomena\nwere produced fraudulently through the substitution or release\nof one of her hands or feet could not be entertained.\nIt was the phenomena under the above test conditions,\nwhich we obtained at our seances in Dec. 1908, that greatly\nimpressed me, and I laid particular stress on them (and gave\nsome examples) in my final note in the Report of our Naples\nsittings. So far I have not met with any satisfactory explana-\ntion of how Eusapia could have produced these phenomena by\nnormal means. It is certain that no accomplice was present,\nand we had satisfied ourselves by examination that no apparatus\nwas being used.\nI am afraid I cannot accept Miss Johnson's theory that\nEusapia possesses the power of inducing a continuous halluci-\nnation of the sense of touch in the minds of her sitters.\nExperienced investigators are well aware that a temporary\nhallucination of this nature can be induced when a medium's\nhand is surreptitiously removed for a moment from the con-\ntroller's hand. We were unceasingly on our guard against\nsuch an occurrence at our Naples sittings. It should be noted\nthat Mr. Feilding states that the conditions of control permitted\nin the recent sittings were wholly different from those permitted\nin the former Naples sittings. In a letter that I have received\nfrom Mr. Feilding, he says :\n\" Everything this time was different\n[from our previous seances] and exactly like the reports given\nof the American conjurers' sittings.\"\n\f70 Rev. M. A. Bayfield, [part\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEW.\nThe Newer Spiritualism. By Frank Podmore.\n(Fisher Unwin, London, 1910. Svo, pp. 320, 8s. 6d. net.)\nThis book, which Mr. Podmore brought to completion only a short\ntime before his death, is a closely reasoned and temperate review of\nthe evidence for the reality of supposed communications with the\nspirits of the dead, and for the genuineness of certain physical\nphenomena, which has been accumulated since the publication of\nF. W. H. Myers' Human Personality. It is the work of an acknow-\nledged master in these subjects, and, as such, deserves the attention\nof all serious students of them, whatever may be their prepossessions.\nThe discussion is copiously illustrated by detailed descriptions and\nanalyses of many of the most important cases, and the reader is\nthus enabled to form his own judgment upon the evidence as the\ninquiry proceeds. Those who are familiar with the author's previous\nwritings will hardly need to be told that the book possesses the\nadded attraction of an excellent literary style, and that there is not\na dull page in it\u2014not even in the welcome index.\nThe ultimate purpose of Human Personality was to prove the\nsurvival of the soul after death. With this tremendous question\nMr. Podmore is not here concerned, and he offers no opinion upon\nit. When he leaves the physical phenomena, he addresses himself\nsolely to the inquiry whether the supposed communications from a\nspirit world, obtained through trance or automatic writing or other\nmeans, are really what they profess to be, or are not rather derived\ntelepathically from the minds of the living. Myers' theory of a\nsubliminal consciousness is, however, so intimately bound up with\n\fLXII.] Review. 71\nthe whole matter, that Mr. Podmore considers it not inconsistent\nwith his purpose to devote an introductory chapter to its consider-\nation. In view of the manifold and far-reaching bearings of Myers'\ngreat conception, the chapter is of cardinal importance.\nMr. Podmore gives an adequate statement of the theory, of which\nthe substance may be quoted.\n\"Now, the peculiar contribution of Myers to modern psycho-\nlogy lies here. He accepts to the full the results of modern\nresearch. He recognises that human consciousness, as we know\nit, is a highly composite and unstable thing, having neither\ncompleteness nor essential unity. Consciousness is, to employ\nhis own simile, a selection, like the visible spectrum, accidental,\ninterrupted, and variable, from a much larger potential whole.\nBut at this point Myers' views diverge from those of the\nrecognised schools. To him the surface consciousness, the only\nthing which we know as consciousness in ordinary life, is com-\nparatively unimportant. 'I award no primacy,' he writes, 'to\nmy ordinary waking self, except that, among many potential\nselves, this one has shown itself the fittest to meet the needs\nof common life.' It is the hidden life which counts\u2014the self\nwhich the struggle of the market-place and the senate has\nthrust back into the darkness, or has not yet called into conscious\nactivity.\n\"The subliminal consciousness, he supposes, may embrace a\nfar wider range, both of physiological and psychical activity,\nthan is open to the normal personality. The invisible spectrum\nof consciousness stretches indefinitely in either direction, extend-\ning on one side to physiological processes which have long\ndropped out of human knowledge, on the other to supernormal\nfaculties, of which only stray hints have reached us in our\npresent stage of evolution.\"\nHe completes the account by a reference to those hystero-epileptics\nwho in their conscious state may be almost completely without the\nsenses of touch, sight, and hearing, and whose memory is, as to a\ngreat part of their life, a blank ; but who, when placed in the\ndeepest hypnotic trance, largely recover these senses, and are able to\nfill up the blanks in the memory, and to give a clear account of the\nshock which brought on their illness \u2014a thing which, when conscious,\nthey were unable to do. The trance has brought to the surface the\nreal self which the calamity had obscured. As is well known,\nMyers saw in these sad cases a significant analogy. Man, in his\n\f72 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\npresent environment, he believed, may be, as compared with his real\nand potential self\u2014the self of his subliminal consciousness \u2014no more\nthan the crippled and shrunken thing which these poor sufferers are,\nunder the grip of their infirmities. To quote Mr. Podmore\n:\n\" In that larger potential consciousness, which, as we have\nwarrant for inferring, surrounds the narrowed personality which\nsuffices for our common every-day life, he believed himself to\ndiscern traces of faculties too large for merely terrestrial needs,\nand signs of a guiding power wise with more than human fore-\nsight. This, in effect, is Myers's case. There need be no fear,\nhe proclaims, lest the soul of man should be disintegrated\nwith the disintegration of the body ; because it exhibits '\ntraces\nof faculty which this material or planetary life could not have\ncalled into being, and whose exercise even here and now involves\nand necessitates the existence of a spiritual world.'\n\"\nMr. Podmore admits the cogency of the argument, but disputes\nthe premises. \"What,\" he asks, \"is this 'subliminal self,' and what\nare its chief properties ?\n\" In his answer he admits that \" certain\npathologic cases . . . show that there may exist, below the personality\nexhibited to us in ordinary life, another personality, larger, freer,\nsaner\"; and that \"the hypnotic memory, too, is, as a rule, wider\nthan the waking memory \" ; and he takes note of the remarkable\nphenomena produced by hypnotic suggestion. But\n\"the secondary personality in the case of Felida X. and the\n'Misses Beauchamp' is obviously the product of pathologic con-\nditions, whilst in the hypnotic subject it seems probable that it\nis simply the result of training. Apart from these special cases,\nand from a few sporadic instances of latent faculty emerging in\ndreams, or through the planchette and the crystal, there is\nscanty support for the assumption of a hidden personality in\nman. There is little evidence, in other words, that, in normal\npersons, there is below the surface any sequence of memories or\nseparate form of consciousness, so far organised or so stable as\nto deserve the name of a secondary personality ; and there is\nstill less evidence of interference with the operations of the\nwork-a-day self by any such subterranean agencies.\"\nHis conclusion is, that\u2014while, \" in these lofty regions where we\nalmost lose sight of terrestrial analogies, we have no right to use\nthe word 'impossible,' perhaps not even the word 'improbable'\"\n\u2014\nthe present evidence for the existence of a subliminal self is insufficient.\n\fLXII.] Review. 73\nThat our present evidence is far from amounting to demonstration,\nmay be readily granted ; but Mr. Podmore's admissions are consider-\nable, and his arguments seem to leave the balance of probability\nstill on the side of Myers's illuminating theory. To say nothing of\nthe evidence afforded by automatic writing 1\nand crystal-gazing which\nMr. Podmore is disposed to minimise, but which is not to be\nneglected, we may ask whether it is fair to the argument to lay so\nmuch stress on the pathologic features of some of the cases, and\nwhether he is justified in refusing to attach weight to the evidence\nfurnished by those which are of this nature. Moreover, a large\nnumber of the cases are not pathologic. And if we take three\ntypical cases, mentioned in this chapter, in only two of which the\npathologic element appears to be present, what do we find 1 One of\nDr. Bramwell's patients, a Miss A., could, in obedience to hypnotic\nsuggestion, count 11,470 minutes, and then, in a waking state, make\na cross on a piece of paper. In 55 such experiments she was\nsuccessful 45 times. This can hardly be the result of training ; it\nwould rather appear to indicate the liberation of a remarkable latent\npower, already existing fully developed. Again, Huxley cited the\ncase of a man \"who had suffered some injury to the brain, which\ninduced occasional accesses of automatism. In the automatic state\nhe would write from dictation, without looking at the paper, and\nwould be able to correct what he had written, crossing the fs and\ndotting the i's with perfect accuracy, though a sheet of cardboard\nwas interposed between his eyes and the writing.\" On this and\nsimilar cases Mr. Podmore observes, \" The power is possibly to be\nexplained as a special development of the muscular sense.\" But\nthis, even if it should prove to be a proper description of the faculty\nemployed, is not an explanation ; it is no more than a re-statement\nof the fact. It does not matter what sense or faculty was at work.\nThe significance of the performance lies in the fact that the man\nappears to have possessed an extraordinary latent power, not merely\nexisting in germ, but full-grown, which, owing to his condition at\nthe time, when other powers were compulsorily dormant, could\nemerge and come into play. In his ordinary condition the man was\ncramped by the necessities of his environment ; he could not afford\n(if that is the right word) to '\nspecialise ' in this way, but must\npractise a more or less levelling economy of his powers. But the\nemergence of this hidden faculty entitles us to infer the presence of\n1 The evidence afforded by automatic writing may, I think, prove to be\noverwhelming\u2014-see below, p. 82, ff.\n\f74 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nothers no less extraordinary and abnormal ; and this brings us to\nMyers's subliminal consciousness, and goes far to justify his apt simile\nfrom the visible and invisible spectrum, which Mr. Podmore considers\nmisleading. It is but a step further to imagine, with Myers, a con-\ndition of life in which all man's powers ma}7\nbe free to exhibit and\nexert themselves to the same and an even greater degree. Once more,\nwe have the case of the calculating boys, whose condition, so far as\nI am aware, we have no reason for supposing to be pathologic. Of\nthese Mr. Podmore writes, \"The power of extracting cube roots and\ncalculating logarithms at sight can at no period have been a common\nendowment of the race.\" This is to beg the question, and one\nnaturally asks, why not 1 True, the race as we know it in its\npresent environment has not the power in esse; but the point is,\ndoes the race possess these powers in posse 1 To use the old philo-\nsophic terms, have we the Svvafiis, though we may be denied the\nivepyeia 1 Even from the cases before us\u2014apart from numerous\nother strong indications \u2014it seems a reasonable inference that there\nare within every individual abilities both transcending and out-\nnumbering those of the every-day self, and ready to come forth for\nrecognition, whenever by some happy or unhappy chance the prison\ndoor is unlocked. Moreover, it is well known that hypnotism can\nstimulate the will and elicit a surprising strength in the moral\nregion ; from which it would appear that the subliminal includes\nboth the mental and moral qualities\u2014that is, embraces the whole\nman. Our dreams, indeed, are often nonsense, and our dream\nactions sometimes reprehensible from a moral point of view, and\nabhorrent to our waking selves, \u2014as when one dreams that one has\nquietly cut off all one's brother's fingers with a pair of scissors\n\u2014but that hardly affects the question ; we do not know what the\nwill is, nor the conditions and limits of its control.\nIf, then, Mr. Podmore is right when he says that the years that\nbave elapsed since Myers's death have produced no fresh evidence\nto support his \" great synthesis \"\n\u2014a statement which might be dis-\nputed\u2014neither do I find in Mr. Podmore's criticisms anything by\nwhich it is materially weakened. His own confessedly great know-\nledge of the subject has produced no obstinate fact which refuses to\nbe fitted in.\nThe two opening chapters of the main inquiry give an interesting\nrisume\" of the various phenomena exhibited by D. D. Home. These\nperformances the author regards as, for the most part, pure im-\nposture, successful, where it was successful, through mal-observation\n\fLXII.] Review. 75\nor hallucination on the part of the witnesses. In a careful discussion\nof the famous case of levitation, when Home appeared to float into\nan upstairs room through the window, he shows that the witnesses\ncould have had no positive assurance that Home had ever been\noutside the window at all. By some of the fire tests, however,\nand one instance at least of the alleged elongation of Home's body-\nMr. Podmore confesses himself puzzled, and he abstains from\npronouncing an opinion.\n\" I cannot readily represent to my imagination the mental\nprocesses by which two intelligent men holding a lighted candle\nand taking special steps to correct their measurements, . . .\ncould have supposed Home's body to be abnormally lengthened,\nwhen he was really, let us say, only standing on tip-toe and\nstretching himself.\"\n\" The difficulty is quite as great with the red-hot coal per-\nformance. . . . The testimony to Home's feats is abundant ; and\nit is difficult to see how Sir W. Crookes, if in possession of\nhis normal senses, could be mistaken in describing the flames\nlicking Home's fingers.\"\nAs to Eusapia Palladino, whose trial also extends over two chapters,\nMr. Podmore, as was already well known, will have none of her.\nHer performances, including the seances held at Naples at the end\nof 1908, are examined at considerable length, but the conclusion\nis that she is no more than the fine fleur of the art of trickery. She\nis finally dismissed, with some impatience, if not to limbo, at least\nto the limbo of detected frauds of which one has had more than\nenough.\nWhether one believes that the Naples committee were deceived,\nor not, there is no doubt that all who are interested in these\nmatters owe them a large debt of gratitude for the painstaking\ninquiry which they conducted. Their labours have produced at\nleast one lasting result. We have on the one hand the fact that\nthree exceptionally capable investigators were convinced that they,\nat any rate, had not been deceived by Eusapia ; on the other hand,\nwe have the undisputed fact that she has over and over again,\nand up to a quite recent date, been detected in imposture. The\nconjunction of these two facts makes it clear that in future no\ninvestigation of physical phenomena\u2014however skilled may be the\ninvestigators\u2014will be thought to be of any practical value, unless\nthe tests applied are mechanical and automatic. If these are want-\ning, the observations of the witnesses may carry conviction to\n\f76 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nthemselves, but the outside public must remain\u2014I will not say\nuninfluenced, but unconvinced.\nIn a chapter preceding detailed examinations of the mediumship\nof Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Thompson, Mr. Podmore makes some just\nand discriminating remarks on the moral diathesis of trance mediums\nin general. In feats of clairvoyance pure and simple\u2014as distinct\nfrom the power of acquiring knowledge telepathically from the mind\nof a living person\u2014he puts no credence. He does not believe the\nfaculty exists. He is convinced that Stainton Moses and the Eev.\nC. B. Sanders (a Presbyterian clergyman of Alabama, who developed\na secondary personality calling itself X + Y = Z) had themselves\nhidden the '\nlost ' articles which they professed to discover ; and\nthat Alexis Didier\u2014whom the famous conjurer Houdin failed to\ndetect in fraud\u2014had already seen, as he rapidly turned the leaves\nof the almost closed book, the words he professed to read from a\npage lying some distance underneath one of the two pages which\nbecame visible when the book was laid open. But he is disposed\nto think the trickery was not necessarily conscious.\n\" Alexis may well have been quite unconscious of the channel\nthrough which he derived his information. It is possible that\none may be justified in taking an equally charitable view of\nthe performances of X + Y = Z, and that the right hand of Mr.\nStainton Moses may not have known what the left hand was\ndoing.\"\nAccordingly, in speaking of these cases, the word '\nfraud ' must\nonly be used with a reservation.\n\" A trance medium is, ex hypothesi, in an abnormal condition :\nand there are other indications that the dissociation of conscious-\nness frequently involves impaired moral control. In using the\nword 'fraud,' therefore, in this connection we do not necessarily\nimply a higher degree of moral responsibility than when we\npass judgment on the play-acting of a child. Conjuring tricks\nand sham telepathy seem to be merely part of the automatic\nromance.\"\nBy this standard, and with this reservation, the author would\njudge certain doubtful incidents in the mediumship of Mrs. Piper\nand Mrs. Thompson.\nWe now come to the great question of the supposed communica-\ntions with discarnate spirits through the trance mediums and the\ncross-correspondences. In reviewing the early sittings of Mrs. Piper\n\fLXIT.] Review. 77\nMr. Podmore notes some facts which must affect our judgment of\nthe more recent phenomena.\n\"The significant point in these early sittings is that the\ninformation given about the sitter's living friends seems, generally\nspeaking, to have been as vivid, as copious, and as accurate as\nthe information given about the dead, and that there is no\nmeans, as a rule, of discriminating between them either as\nregards substance or source\u2014-that is, the statements about the\ndead and the living alike are given as if they proceeded\ndirectly from Phinuit's own knowledge. Sometimes, on the other\nhand, where the dead are concerned, the utterances are put\ninto their mouths, but there is rarely any indication that this\nis more than a traditional dramatic device.\"\nOf the Piper-Hodgson communications he would give the same\nexplanation as that implied here\u2014that is, the telepathic. He fully\nrecognises the extraordinary vraisemblance of the dramatic impersona-\ntion, but he points out the important fact that no test questions\nwere answered, and that the control showed ignorance of several\nmatters which, considering what he apparently did remember, he\nmight reasonably be expected not to have forgotten. He suggests,\nhowever, another conceivable explanation\n:\n\"If we could suppose that sometimes the real Hodgson com-\nmunicated through the medium's hand, and that sometimes,\nmore often, when he was inaccessible, the medium's secondary\npersonality played the part as best it could, these difficulties\nwould no doubt be lessened. It may be justifiable, as a guide\nto further investigation, provisionally to entertain such a hypo-\nthesis ; but it seems hardly necessary to say that at this stage, at\nany rate, it cannot be seriously defended.\"\nWith the development of cross-correspondences the problem became\nmore complicated. In these Mr. Podmore recognises the directive\naction of an intelligence other than that of the automatists,\nbut he fails\u2014as others of us have failed\u2014to find sufficient evidence\nfor believing the intelligence at work to be that of a discarnate\nspirit. In discussing the Browning-Hope-Star incident and the Latin\nmessage, he draws attention to a significant fact. After dictating\nthe message, Mr. Piddington had impressed on the Piper-Myers the\nimportance of the scheme of cross-correspondences in general. 1\nThe\n1\nMr. Piddington of course made no allusion to the peculiar (i.e. the supple-\nmentary) kind asked for in the Latin message.\n\f78 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\ncontrol replied, \" If you establish telepathic messages, you will doubt-\nless attribute all such to thoughts from those living in the mortal\nbody.\" On this Mr. Podmore remarks :\n\"The answer shows conclusively that the Piper-Myers had\nnot grasped the plan of complex cross-correspondences which\nthe Verrall-Myers, according to the hypothesis, had been\nactively elaborating for some years previously ; and further,\nthat the Piper-Myers at that date, Jan. 18, 1907, had not yet\nsucceeded in translating the Latin message.\"\nThe word 'conclusively' is perhaps too strong; but as coming from\none who professes to be identical with the other Myerses who have\nso long been furnishing supplementary cross-correspondences and\nemphasising their value, the remark of the control is certainly inex-\nplicable. The sitting of Feb. 27, 1907, has, however, been relied\nupon as showing that at that later date, at any rate, MyersP under-\nstood the whole matter. This seems to me disputable. It is true\nthat at that sitting Myers P pointed to the Browning-Hope-Star\nincident, and offered it as his answer to the Latin message, but, like\nthe unintentionally witty, he may have been doing better than he\nwas aware. Did he know how good his answer was 1 The differentia\nof the 'supplementary' cross-correspondences, which gives them their\npeculiar value, is that the scripts of, say, three automatists concerned\nare not fully intelligible when considered separately, but when\ncompared with one another, are found to be connected by a common\nidea which is the key to the whole. There is nothing to show that\nMyerSp understood this to be the point of the experiments, though\nnaturally his wave of the hand\u2014so to call it \u2014towards the Browning-\nHope-Star incident was at once recognised as remarkably significant.\nYet surely the real Myers, having grasped the Latin message\u2014as ex\nhypothesi he had done\u2014would not have omitted to make such a\ncrucial detail clear.\nBut the fact is\u2014as Mr. Podmore, I think, shows, and most people\nhave probably concluded for themselves\u2014the Piper-Myers never did\nreally understand the Latin message, though he seems to have\ngathered from some source or sources\u2014among which telepathy may\nbe included\u2014that it referred to cross-correspondences. This fact\nhas always seemed to me peculiarly damaging to his claims. In\nthe utterances of the various mediums the 'spirit' has given no\nsigns of intellectual decay. He is alert and intelligent ; and the\nautomatic scripts, both in matter and style, are at times not\nunworthy of the real Myers. How, then, should he be unable to\n\fLXII.] Review. 79\ntranslate, from a language as familiar to him as English, a couple\nof sentences which, highly idiomatic though they are, would present\nno difficulty to an able sixth-form boy 1\nThe knowledge of the meaning of one or two individual words in\nthe message Mr. Podmore would attribute to the use of a dictionary\nby the medium when in an unconscious state ; but he is careful to\nadd\n:\n\"To recognise, however, that the knowledge shown by the\nentranced Mrs. Piper was perhaps derived from a dictionary\ndoes not imply bad faith on the part of Mrs. Piper whom her\nfriends know and esteem in the waking state. Nor does it\nseriously invalidate the evidence in the other cases, since no\ndictionary could have told Mrs. Piper what Mrs. Verrall was\nwriting; in Cambridge or Mrs. Holland in India.\"\nThe matter is summed up in the following words :\n\" It would appear, then, from the four months' trial of the\nLatin message that the trance personality which the experi-\nmenters call MyeiSp, or the Piper-Myers, had not even at the\nend of the sittings grasped the scheme of complex cross-\ncorrespondences : was so far from grasping it, indeed, that not\neven the numerous hints given in the course of the dialogue\nsucceeded in conveying that idea. From this it would seem to\nfollow, not merely that the Piper-Myers is an intelligence of\ndistinctly inferior capacity, but that it is not identical with the\nintelligence, claiming to emanate from the same source, which\nhas for years past been elaborating, through Mrs. Verrall's hand,\na scheme of complex cross-correspondences.\"\nIt is only fair to note here that upholders of the spiritistic inter-\npretation of the phenomena believe MyersP to be, not the real Myers,\nbut a secondary personality of Mrs. Piper (corresponding to the\nsubliminal self of the automatic writers), which receives communi-\ncations from him. (See Miss Johnson in Proc, Vol. XXIV., p. 262 f.)\nThus the utterances of MyersP may be at one time a true message\nrepeated accurately, at another time a true message imperfectly\ndelivered, at another a mere invention. Mr. Podmore was certainly\nwell acquainted with this view when he wrote the passage quoted\nabove ; but his point\u2014as I understand him\u2014is that, in the absence\nof any sure criterion by which to distinguish true messages from\nfalse, and in face of the discrepancies between the two personalities,\nit is difficult to believe there is a real Myers behind either of them.\n\f80 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nComing to the more recent evidence, Mr. Podmore confesses\nhimself to be strongly impressed by the Lethe incident in Mr.\nDorr's sittings.\n\" It must, I think, be admitted on all hands that the method\nof answering the Lethe question was well devised ; that this is\nprecisely the kind of evidence demanded for the proof of spirit-\nidentity ; and that, though no single case can, of course, be\nconclusive, yet that if evidence of this kind could be multiplied,\nthe presumption in favour of the reality of sjnrit communication\nmight at length become irresistible.\"\nBut he finds two difficulties. The first arises from the discrep-\nancies between the knowledge shown in these sittings by the\nmedium's writing hand and her utterances in the waking stage.\nThe hand is frequently unable to explain at a subsequent sitting\nwhat the voice had spoken. Thus, on one occasion the voice mur-\nmured something that sounded like \"pavia\"; it then added, \"Mr.\nMyers is writing on the wall,\" and spelt out \" c, y, x.\" There can\nbe no doubt that \"pavia\" was meant for papavera (poppies), and it\nwas afterwards made certain that the letters c, y, x were intended\nfor the name Ceyx. Yet the hand explained \" c, y, x\" as \"chariot,\"\nand \"pavia\" as \"Pomona.\"\n\"But the successful allusions,\" writes Mr. Podmore, \"whether\nwritten or spoken, are counted, for the purpose of the corre-\nspondence, as proceeding from the same intelligence; and\nindeed some of the utterances in the waking stage are prefaced\nwith the remark '\nMr. Myers says.' It is extremely difficult to\nreconcile this ignorance or forgetfulness with the identity of the\nspirit purporting to communicate alike by hand and voice.\"\nThe second difficulty is connected with the name Ceyx.\n\"The name written Ceyx is a dissyllable; and not only so,\nbut both vowels are long\u2014Ce-yx (pronounce Kay-eeks). But\nit would seem that both the hand and voice in their efforts to\nrecall the exact word represent it as a monosyllable. . . .\nNow, this misconception, improbable in a scholar who was\nfamiliar with the original poem where the word occurs repeatedly,\nwould be, one must think, impossible to a scholar who was\nalso a poet, for whom the sound of a word must be of primary\nimportance.\"\nMyers, however, pronounced the word as See-ix, which might sound\nmore like a monosyllable. But so also would Mr. Dorr pronounce it.\n\flxil] Revieiv. 81\nOn the Dorr sittings as a whole Mr. Podmore suspends judgment,\nfinding the difficulties and improbabilities involved in a telepathic\nexplanation as serious as those which attach to a recognition of\nspirit agency.\n\" If all these stores of classical learning really came from\nMr. Dorr's mind, we have to credit him with a capacious\nforgetfulness, if the phrase may be allowed, hardly less remark-\nable in its way than the powers of telepathic assimilation which\nwe must ascribe to the trance intelligence.\"\nThis is certainly true ; and for myself, I must confess that, while\nI nevertheless lean to the telepathic solution, I find the contem-\nplation of the amazing powers with which Mrs. Piper must then\nbe credited far more staggering than would be the proof of\ncommunication with a departed spirit. As against the telepathic\nexplanation, attention may be called to another point. The river,\nwith its name Lethe, is a quite subordinate feature of the tale, and\nis perhaps the last detail one would have expected to emerge if\none could have revived Mr. Dorr's memories in connexion with the\nstory. Even when the whole of the fragments of the puzzle-picture\nwere set before him, he was unable to piece them together. And\nyet, on the telepathic hypothesis, it is by this one weak link of\nassociation that Mrs. Piper is able to recover the whole train of\nrecollections.\nOn the other hand, neither did (could?) 1\nthe Piper-Myers put\nthe fragments together as a connected whole; and the omission, or\ninability, to do so is suspicious. If he was the real Myers, he knew\nthe story ;\nwhy, then, did he not tell it in a plain manner ? Why\npresent it in just that fragmentary condition in which we have\nmany reasons for supposing it may have survived in some deepest\ncells of Mr. Dorr's memory 1\nAnother highly important case, the famous Sevens Incident,\nformed the subject of an article by the author in the Contemporary\nReview for September, 1909. Examining it again here, Mr. Podmore\nreiterates his conviction that it is purely telepathic. It arose from\nMr. Piddington's 'posthumous' letter about the number, or rather\nfrom his continuing obsession by it, and he is a recognisable instance\n1\nIn one sitting Mr. Dorr said to the control, \"I see no connexion between\nIris and Lethe.\" To which Myersp replied, \"No, only Iris shot an arrow into\nthe clouds and caused a rainbow. It brought it to my mind simply.\" What\nan answer to come from what professed to be the spirit of F. W. H. Myers\nrecalling the story of Ceyx and Alcyone !\nF\n\f82 Rev. M. A. Bayfield. [part\nof what has long been sought for\u2014an agent external to the automatists,\noriginating the cross-correspondence. But Mrs. Verrall\u2014who would\nappear to have much to answer for\u2014is held to be the chief agent\nin the dissemination of the idea.\n\" Mr. Piddington tells us he was not thinking specially of\nhis letter during the three months over which the cross-corre-\nspondences extended, though few days of his life passed without\nhis thinking of the subject. It would appear, then, as if some\nother factor were needed to reinforce Mr. Piddington's uncon-\nscious telepathy. That other factor must be sought in Mrs.\nVerrall's agency. We find traces of her influence in the Dante\nallusions. An attempt, then, may be made, of course provision-\nally and in very crude fashion, to sketch the mental processes\nwhich seem to be involved. Mr. Piddington had for years\nbeen repeating Seven for all the world\u2014that is all the world\nwithin the range of his telepathic influence\u2014to hear. His is\na voice crying in the wilderness, however, until it happens that\nMrs. Verrall reads the Divine Comedy, and the idea of Seven,\nalready latent in her mind, 1\nis reinforced by a series of Dante\nimages. Mrs. Verrall, then, apparently a much more powerful\ntelepathic agent than Mr. Piddington, swells the stream of\ntelepathic influence, and the effects, in the remaining automatists,\nrise to the surface of the dream consciousness.\"\nMiss Johnson, who is a controversialist of not inferior acumen,\nhas combated this view, and in more than one friendly encounter\nwith the author has undoubtedly scored some points. Her view\nmay be summed up in her own words\n:\n\" It appears to me, in short, that many of the items of this\ncross-correspondence afford strong evidence of the design or\nagency of some intelligence which was cognisant of the whole\nscheme, as finally revealed ; \u2014I refer especially to the use made\nof the Latin verses in Mrs. Piper's case, and to the veiled\nallusions to Mr. Piddington's letter in the Verrall scripts ;\u2014and\nit seems to me difficult to attribute so complete a knowledge\nof it to the subliminal consciousness either of Mrs. Verrall or\nof Mr. Piddington.\"\nThis conclusion seems to me just, though not exactly for the\nreasons specially mentioned here. It is difficult, I think, for any one\n1\nMrs. Verrall's subliminal self would appear to have had some knowledge of\nthe letter at about the very hour when it was being written.\n\flxil] Review. 83\nwho studies the cross-correspondences of this class without prejudice\nto resist the conclusion that some intelligence originates each experi-\nment, and perhaps to some extent influences its course. The\nevidence for this is even stronger in the Sesame and Lilies case, 1\nwhich Mr. Podmore does not discuss, than in the Sevens Incident.\nProf. Pigou has suggested that the difference in the details\nwhich emerge in the various scripts may be due to chance rather\nthan to selection ; but the cause seems inadequate, and there is\nample evidence scattered about the cases that some one knows a\ncross-correspondence is being attempted. Thus, in the Sesame and\nLilies incident we have in Mrs. Verrall's script,\n\" Then besides the Lilies there is to be another word for\nyou, and for her Lilies and a different word 2\n\u2014So that Lilies is.\nthe catchword to show what words are to be put together.\nAnd your second word is gold. Think of the golden lilies\nof France.\nYou will have to wait some time for the end of the story,\nfor the solution of the puzzle\u2014but I think there is no doubt\nof its ultimate success.\"\nClearly there is an author, who is possibly also prompter and\nstage-manager, behind the scenes.\nBut it may be asked, do we yet know enough of the powers\nof the subliminal consciousness to preclude the presumption\nthat the some one who originates, and perhaps directs, may be\none of the subliminals concerned ? For myself, I must confess I\nhave had almost from the beginning a steadily growing suspicion\nthat Mrs. Verrall's subliminal\u2014which from the first professed to be\ncontrolled by spirits\u2014should have the credit for most, at any rate,\nof these highly elaborated and ingenious experiments. It appears to\nhave been the originator of the idea, which emerged in her script\nas early as March, 1901, 3\nand to have made repeated attempts to\ncarry it out in the years that followed, but with no very striking\nresults until we come to the triumphant successes of 1907. Through-\n1\nSee Mrs. Verrall's admirably clear analysis of this, Proc, Vol. XXIV.,\npp. 264 ff.\n2\nAs a matter of fact, the script failed on this point.\n3\nSee Miss Johnson's paper, Proc, Vol. XXI., pp. 375 ff. , where a large number\nof references to the scheme are collected from Mrs. Verrall's script. These\nnumerous hints, however, were understood by no one until the early part of\n1906, when Miss Johnson, with great acuteness, detected the supplementary\nnature of many of the cross-correspondences.\n\f84 Rev. M. A. Bayfield, [part\nout these latter correspondences there may be found, as I think,\n\u2014\nat any rate by any one who knows Mrs. Verrall well, and Dr. and\nMrs. Verrall have been my most intimate friends for many years\n\u2014\nconstantly recurring indications that, in the great majority of cases\nthe central idea in each emanates from her. I find these signs as\nconspicuous as anywhere else in the remarkable Sesame and Lilies\ncase, which has been claimed as peculiarly strong evidence for the\nspiritistic view.\nNow, considering the notoriously non-moral character of all sub-\nliminal consciousnesses, it will hardly be denied that Mrs. Verrall's,\nhaving once evolved the idea of supplementary cross-correspondences,\nwith a view to proving its spirit inspiration, would be quite capable\nof devising one, and of attempting to carry it out. It would\nnaturally continue to sustain the fiction of spirit agency with all\npossible ingenuity and resource. To take the next step, I venture to\noffer the following suggestion of a possible modus operandi, hoping\nthat a consideration of what we already know of the powers of the\ntelepathic faculty may be held to redeem it from the charge of\nrashness.\nFirst, then, this subliminal consciousness launches, and continues\nto launch, into the void\u2014not necessarily by any special effort, but\nmerely as a result of the process of thought\u2014the ground-idea of\nsuch a correspondence, to be assimilated by any other automatists\n(including trance-mediums) who can receive it. This idea\u2014after\nmany abortive onesided experiments had been patiently pursued\nby its author\u2014is at last grasped by other automatists. Then\ncomes a time when Mrs. Verrall's subliminal proclaims in a similar\nmanner, and as it has often done before, a subject for an experi.\nment, and the others proceed to execute the congenial task with\nenthusiasm, \u2014for they too are interested in maintaining the illusion\nof a spirit agency. Avoiding, as a rule\u2014for they have been\ninspired so to do\u2014any definite expression of the leading idea, they\ncommit to their scripts, rather, associated ideas, anything thai occurs\nto them as their thoughts in butterfly fashion flutter about it.\n1\nWe\nthen may get from different automatists, at various dates, scripts\nlike the following, 2\nwith other matter\u2014perhaps fragments of another\n1\nThe amount of control which a subliminal may have over its thoughts is\na point outside my present purpose.

And in other real scripts, confessedly not even tele-\npathic, there is plenty of evidence that the subliminal at times\nsuffers from a similar loss of control, producing similar aberrations,\nand has difficulty in recalling its memories. On the other hand, we\nhave no good evidence that these characteristics of the scripts arise\nfrom a spirit's inability to convey its own thoughts clearly through\nthe medium ; for such incoherent utterances are intermingled, in\nthe same script, with other matter lucid in thought and sure in\nexpression, but which differs also in this, that it does not make\nthe same demands upon the subliminal memory. It is difficult,\ntherefore, to resist the conclusion that we are dealing with sub-\nliminals which have received nothing from outside, except (in the\ncase of automatists other than Mrs. Verrall) the cardinal conception\nof a supplementary cross-correspondence, and (where they are not\nthe originators) the subject of the correspondence in hand\u2014unless\nwe add occasional telepathic messages such as \" young Lochinvar\n\"\nabove, which is supposed to be an echo from the \" Esk river \" of\nanother automatist. That a real spirit's mind may wander after\nthe manner of the scripts, is surely a solution of the matter which\nbelievers\u2014or would-be believers\u2014in the spirit's survival will accept\nonly after every other has been proved untenable.\nThe evidence of design, then, in the scripts is irresistible ; but if\n1\nTennyson. 2\nFrom Scott's Lochinvar.\n\f88 Rev.

Prof.\nPigou felt it necessary to suggest a reason why the various auto-\nmatists do not hit upon the same details oftener than they do\n;\nbut surely it is unlikely that they would, where the subject of the\nexperiment is fairly wide. A, B, and C, searching their memories,\nmay well recall different points in a subject of moderate extent,\nand the number of conceivable associated ideas is obviously un-\nlimited. At the same time, even the most far-fetched of these latter,\nif one gets enough of them, help to identify the central idea, and\nto swell the evidence of design.\nFurther argument in support of this view\u2014which is of course\nmerely provisional\u2014would be out of place here, and I must content\nmyself with what has been already said. I will only add, that I\nbelieve a minute examination of the scripts would reveal much\nevidence in its favour.\nTo return to Mr. Podmore, it will be seen that his views remain sub-\nstantially what, from his published utterances, they have been known\nto be for many years. He unduly minimises, as I think, a good deal of\nscattered evidence for clairvoyance and certain physical phenomena,\nbut on the larger question of spirit communications most people\nwill probably consider that he takes a very strong position. In a\nhighly interesting chapter, entitled \"The Stage Setting of the\nTrance,\" he makes a formidable general assault on the genuineness\nof all spirit controls, and his arguments are certainly difficult to\nmeet. Some years ago he wrote, in his Modem Spiritualism:\n\" Mrs. Piper would be a much more convincing apparition if\nshe could have come to us out of the blue, instead of trailing\nbehind her a nebulous ancestry of magnetic somnambules, witch-\nridden children, and ecstatic nuns.\"\nHe reaffirms the opinion now. He points out that dissociation of\nconsciousness is frequently accompanied by the sense of a new\npersonality, which naturally demands a new name \u2014a fact notorious\nin those cases where the dissociation is complete and lasting. In\nview of this, he asks what substantial grounds we have for believing\nMrs. Piper's latest controls to be different in kind from their prede-\ncessors.

STANLEY HALL.\nFrom ANDREW LANG.\nAlleyne House,\nSt. Andrews, December 1st, 1910.\nDear Sir,\nExcuse the liberty which I assume when I throw\nmy reflections on some recent work of yours into the old-\nfashioned form of a \" Familiar Epistle to an Author.\" I have\nbeen reading with interest Dr. Tanner's Studies in Spiritism,\nwith an Introduction by G. Stanley Hall, Ph.D., LL.D.1\nYour\nown contributions to what you style such a \" searching, im-\npartial, critical estimate \" of the work of the English Society\nfor Psychical Research as that Society has never enjoyed\nbefore,2\nattracted my particular attention. I do not disparage\nthe performances of Miss Tanner, Ph.D., when I say that the\nwork of the Master interested me even more than that of the\nimpartial Disciple.\nIn all studies and in all discussions every man or woman\nwho takes a part has a natural or artificial bias,\u2014or plenty\nof both. My bias in the matter of Mrs. Piper and her per-\nformances is identical with your own. Thus you say, \" we all\nhave fathers, but somehow it seemed to me vulgar to hold the\nintercourse which I should love to \" (hold ?)\n\" with my father's\nspirit in such a way as this,\" namely, through Mrs. Piper.:i\nI have elsewhere expressed precisely the same sentiments,\nto which I adhere.4\nYou write, \" we dishonour our immortal parts \" (or rather,\nperhaps, the immortal parts of our dead friends ?)\n\" by thinking\n1\nD.

Your\nsentiments are mine : nothing could induce me to intrude on\nthe denizens of the next world through the agency of Mrs. Piper,\n(whom I never met,) or of any other \" entranced \" medium,\nsavage or civilised.\nBut Science must \" do diverse and disgusting things \" in\nthe search for Truth, and you have clone diverse and dis-\ngusting things to Mrs. Piper ;\nprodding her with an esthesio-\nmeter, and filling her nostrils with camphor and ether ; her\nmouth with sugar and salt, which she \" took very uncon-\ncernedly,\" to quote Claverhouse (pp. 236-239). Volenti non\nfit injuria, you might also have exhibited snuff, and found out\nwhether it made her \"control\" \"Hodgson\" sneeze or not.\nA scientific study of Mrs. Piper is one thing ; serious con-\nsultation of the dead through Mrs. Piper is another, and, I\nagree with you, is a vulgar thing.\nThus far we are in accord ;\nand, again, I am in a state\nof absolute agnosticism about Mrs. Piper's case : I can go\nfurther, I have never seen in the published reports any proof,\nfor me, that she is in touch with even an off-current, so to\nspeak, of the consciousness of any persons discarnate. Some\nof her performances puzzle me, for example the replies of her\n\" Hodgson \" to Professor William James, the answers of her\n\"Mr. Myers\" to questions on Eoman mythology; and so forth. 2\nI am puzzled ;\nand, (here we approach the main point of my\ndifficulty,) I am inclined to suppose that Mrs. Piper, in her\nnormal condition, could not have given the replies which, as\n\" Hodgson \" and as \" Myers,\" she did give to the questions of\nMr. James and of Mr. Dorr. The abnormality of her con-\ndition seems, in some way, to help her, but is her condition,\nin fact, abnormal when she gives sittings ?\nWe now reach the question to which your answers, in Dr.\nTanner's book, appear to me, (excuse my frankness in a matter\nof Science,) to be so lacking in coherence as to resemble the\nutterances of \" split personalities.\" Is Mrs. Piper, to your\nmind, when she gives a \" sitting,\"\u2014-when she is \" entranced \"\n\u2014\nreally dans son assiette, really in possession of her normal\nintelligence, and of ber senses five ?

[part\ncommon forthright impostor (or strangely self-deceived by\nself-suggestion) ; for she says that she is \" in trance \" ; that her\nnormal consciousness is in abeyance ;\nwhile, when restored to\nher normal consciousness, she retains no memory of what she\nsaid, did, and suffered while in trance. Such are her pro-\nfessions, and if, while seeming to be in trance, she is really in\nfull persistent normal consciousness, she says what she knows\nto be\u2014erroneous.\nIs it a conceivable hypothesis that in her assumed \" trance\n\"\nshe is normally conscious, but that she has suggested herself\ninto so firm a belief in her own unconsciousness that, after\nthe trance, she actually retains no memory of having been\nconscious ? Has she successfully administered to herself a\n\" post-hypnotic suggestion \" not to remember things of which\nshe was as conscious, in her \" trance,\" as a hypnotised patient\nis conscious in his of what he is told to do or abstain from\ndoing ? If so she is\nli\nSo false she wholly takes herself for true.\"\nIf I had to wairer, and if the wager could be decided, I\nwould lay five to one that after her trance she really retains\nno memory of what occurred in it. That is only an im-\npression for what it is worth. Nor is the analogy of a patient\nhypnotised by another person, close and exact ; for Tie, it\nseems, can be hallucinated by the external suggestion, whereas,\non the hypothesis which I indicate, Mrs. Piper is widely\nawake to the external world, but is hypnotised, by herself,\ninto remembering nothing about it.\nPerhaps you have some such solution of the problem in\nyour mind when you doubt as to whether Mrs. Piper's\n\" method be a conscious invention on her part,\" or \" a method\nunconsciously drifted into \"\n(p. xx). If you adhered firmly to\nthis line of conjecture, and if it means that Mrs. Piper\nhypnotises herself by self-suggestion, and gives herself a \"post-\nhypnotic suggestion \" to forget, my only difficulty would be\nthat I know not whether, in a hypnotic condition, a patient\ncan be keenly conscious of every minute event. Your ex-\nplanation, if I understand you, of some effects of Mrs. Piper\nwhich have astonished observers, and have been ascribed to\n\" supernormal \" influences, telepathic or spiritual, is that in\n\fReview. 93\ntrance her sense of hearing is acute and vigilant ; her powers\nof inference and observation and of normal memory exceed-\ningly keen, and that thus she can amaze spectators by her\nstatements. All this I am not disputing, but do you steadily\nmaintain that her senses, and memory, and powers of deduc-\ntion, in\n' :\ntrance,\" are normal, or perhaps even above the\npowers of her every-day intelligence ?\nOn this all-important and very interesting question, you\nappear, if I may use a Shakespearian phrase, to \" speak with\ntwo voices,\" and to hold irreconcilable opinions. I may very\nprobably be mistaken : it is so easy and so natural to mis-\nunderstand an argument. I can only quote various state-\nments of yours which, at present, I cannot reconcile.\nYour contributions to Dr. Tanner's book, taken in the order\nin which they were obviously written, are \" Current Notes by\nDr. Hall\" (pp. 259-273), the matter in pages 177-185, and\nthe \" Introduction \" (pp. xv-xxxiii). As to your \" Current\nNotes\" you say that they were \"jotted down with no thought\nof their publication, least of all in their present form\n\"\n{Introduction, p. xxxiii). \" Their present form,\" I presume,\nis the form in which they were originally written by you,\nwhile the impressions received by you from the \" sittings\n\"\nwere fresh in your memory ? Yet I am not certain on this\npoint; the \"jotted notes\" are sarcastic and eloquent. \"Are\nthey tempting sirens that would lure us to our destruction,\nor are they angelic beckonings to a higher world ?\n\" This\nreads, does it not? like a passage of deliberate rhetoric, not\nlike a jotting. Indeed the whole chapter has the air of\nbeing a studied composition. As evidence, it would be much\nmore valuable, (according to the ideas of the Society for Psychical\nEesearch,) if it really were contemporary with the sittings\n;\nwere really \" a few notes on the Piper sittings jotted down\nwith no thought of their publication, least of all in their\npresent form \"\n(p. xxxiii). Is the \" present form \" or is it\nnot, the original form of the jotted notes ? If not, the\noriginal notes are much to be desired.\nLeaving the notes and the Introduction for a moment, we\nobserve (p. 190) that \"before Mrs. Piper entered the trance\n. . . Dr. Hall explained to her that we had no doubt at all\nabout the genuineness of her trance or of her own honesty.\"\n\f94 Andrew Lang. [part\nNow you confessedly thought it de bonne guerre, (and here I\nagree with you,) to deceive the entranced Mrs. Piper,\u2014that is,\nthe so-called \" Hodgson,\"\u2014by saying the thing that was not\n;\nby \" my involuted lie\" (p. 179). I do not deem this a moral\nfib, but a scientific and experimental stratagem. But I suppose\nthat, when you assured Mrs. Piper, in her ordinary state, of\nyour belief in her \" honesty \" and in \" the genuineness of her\ntrance \" you were not telling an \" involuted lie.\" I take this\nfor granted.\nThe point that puzzles me is, do you still retain your belief\nin the \" genuineness \" of Mrs. Piper's \" trance \" ? Your remarks\non this question, in your \" Introduction \" and \" Current Notes\"\nperplex me; partly because of the terminology which you\nemploy : to this point I will return.\nAs to trance, genuine trance, it is fair to take it in the\nsense of Dr. Tanner's definition. \" Trance states are by no\nmeans the exclusive possession of mediums. They are common\nin hysterical subjects, and in cases of secondary personality,\nand can be produced by hypnosis or suggestion with proper\nsubjects. While in the trance the victim is more or less\nunconscious of what is going on about her, and on recovering\nremembers her feelings more or less dimly. The state has\nmany resemblances to somnambulism. Neither the causes nor\ncure of it are as yet well understood \"\n(p. xxxvi). This I accept\nfor the sake of argument.\nIf Mrs. Piper be \" honest,\"\u2014as you told her you believed\nher to be,\u2014in trance she is \" more or less unconscious of what\nis going on about her.\" She retains, she says, no memory of\nwhat was going on, after she wakens. But, if honest, she\ncannot tell, when she wakens, whether, when entranced, she\nwas conscious of what was going on around her or not. When\nwe say that we have had a dreamless sleep, we only mean that\nwe retain no memory of having dreamed. In some cases it\ncan be proved, by a bedfellow who heard us talking in our\nsleep, that we really did dream. If Mrs. Piper be dishonest,\nwe cannot trust her report ; if she be honest, her report is of\nno value, for she merely does not remember having been\nconscious of her environment : whether by self-suggestion or\nnot.\nWe are thus dependent on your opinion as to the extent\n\fLXII.] Review. 95\nof her normal consciousness of all, or of much, that passes in\nher room while she is entranced. Now I cannot discover what,\nin this matter, your opinion really is. (For my part, I have no\nopinion as to whether or not the \" trance \" is \" genuine.\") You\nsay (p. xix) that the sitter has the impression that Mrs. Piper\n\" is almost as much out of the game in this state as if she were\ndead.\" The sitters, therefore, at last come to talk quite freely,\nand your theory is that Mrs. Piper listens to even the faintest\nsounds, and tries to make her profit out of what she hears\n;\nfor, you say, in fact, \"her ear is awake and alert\" (p. xix).\nIf so, then Mrs. Piper's trance, (as far as I can understand.) is\nnot genuine ;\nfor, following Dr. Tanner's definition, \" in trance\nthe victim is more or less unconscious of what is going on\nabout her\"; whereas you say that, at least often, she is acutely\nconscious even of things concealed, as when Mr. Dorr pretends\nto go out, opening and shutting the door, but slips back again\n(pp. 214-215).\nAs this is so, how could you tell Mrs. Piper that you\nbelieved in \" the genuineness of her trance \" ? You believe\nno such matter, if you accept Dr. Tanner's very moderate defini-\ntion of the amount of ordinary consciousness in trance. You\nwrite \" it often seemed that only her eyes \" (hidden in a\ncushion) \" were out of the game, and all \" (my italics) \" her\nmental and emotional powers were very wide awake\" (p. xx).\nBut not only \" her eyes were out of the game,\" for \" general\nsensibility [is also] shunted out . . . and certainly her respiratory\nfunctions, taste, smell, general tactile sensibility and motor\ninnervation are asleep\" (p. 268).\nOn this showing a great deal of Mrs. Piper is certainly\nasleep ; so a great deal of her trance is certainly genuine.\nMeanwhile her ears, or one of them, and all her mental and\nemotional powers were, on your showing, very wide awake.\nSo far her trance is not genuine, nor is she honest. You add,\n\" and yet I am by no means convinced that she acted her\nsleep-dream. ...\" (p. xx).\nYou know, as well as I, that in the dreams of sleep the\nsleeper is, at most, but faintly and erroneously conscious of\nthe sounds in his environment, and that when such sounds\ngive occasion to a dream, the dream dramatizes and misinter-\nprets them out of all resemblance to the objective cause of the\n\f96 Andrew Lang. [part\nhallucination. Mrs. Piper, on the other hand, you say, is, as\nregards her mental powers, \" often very wide awake,\" in a\n\" sleep-dream \" which, none the less, you are not \" convinced\n\"\nthat she feigns. Yet you are (apparently) convinced that she\n\" acts \" the \" sleep-dream,\" for you are convinced that, \" often at\nleast her mental powers are very wide awake.\" Now, in sleep-\ndreams, as an all but universal rule, our \" mental powers \" are\nvery remote from being \" wide awake,\"\u2014we could not cheat,\nin a \" sleep-dream,\" or try to cheat, observers who were watching\nus. Yet Mrs. Piper apparently tries to do nothing else.\nYou go on to give \" abundant evidence,\"\u2014in the same page,\n\u2014\" that Mrs. Piper-Hodgson's soul is awake and normal.\" If\nby \" soul \" you mean Mrs. Piper's ordinary intelligence, and if\nthat be awake and normal, when she is acting the part of\nHodgson, then she is not in a trance, as Dr. Tanner defines\ntrance, and is an impostor ; like Mr. Pickwick I will be more\nexplicit and say \" a humbug.\" But then, that she is \" acting\nher sleep-dream,\" one of your split selves is \" by no means\nconvinced.\" Like Malvolio, you \" think nobly of the soul,\" as\nour immortal part. If, when you speak of Mrs. Piper's \"soul\"\nas \" awake and normal \" in her assumed trance, you mean, not\nher normal intelligence, but her \" soul \" in the Platonic sense,\nthen you agree with Sir Thomas Browne. \" There is some-\nthing in us that is not in the jurisdiction of Morpheus . . .\nwe are somewhat more than ourselves in our sleep ; and the\nslumbering of the body seems but to be the wakening of the\nsoul.\" Perhaps that is what you mean ? Perhaps you mean\nthat, in trance, Mrs. Piper's \" soul,\" or immortal part, is its\ntrue unconditioned self?

On the whole we incline to the idea\nthat, although we have here \" (in Mrs. Piper's normal and very\nacute sense of hearing,) \" the source of by far most of the\ninformation the control seems to possess that appears super-\nnormal, that the ear itself in point of fact is not very wide\nawake, and most of the time is only a little above the middle\nstate between sleeping and waking.\"\nHere, sir, in apparent contradiction of what you say (p. xix)\n\u2014\" her ear is awake and alert,\"\u2014you write that, at first, this\near \" seemed in full function,\" yet that, in fact, it was not in\nfull function, not \" alert,\" but \" tended to drop off into the\nslumber,\"\u2014heard \" dimly and sleepily,\" and so forth, and most\nof the time is only a little above the middle state between\nsleeping and waking,\" in which state we hear in the vaguest\nand most dislocated fashion.

We have here a clearly\ndrawn and most important distinction between the impressions\nmade on you by your earlier and your later studies of the\nalertness of Mrs. Piper's ear, or sense of hearing. Your\n\" Current Notes,\" in which Mrs. Piper's ear hears \" dimly\nand sleepily, or tended to drop off into slumber,\" were, or\nought to have been, written under the vivid recent impression\nof your interviews with that lady.

How can\nboth of these conclusions be correct ? Why do you express\n(pp. xix-xx) in your Introduction the conclusions which, as\nreported in your \" Current Notes,\" subsecpuent observation\nproved to be mistaken ? Conclusions which are apparently\nirreconcilably contradictory cannot be the basis of discussion.\nThe problem of determining the presence or absence of very\nwide-awake normal intelligence and keen sensitiveness to im-\npressions in a person whose \" general sensibility is shunted\nout,\" and whose \" respiratory functions, taste, smell, general\ntactile sensibility and motor innervation are certaiidy asleep,\"\n(p. 268) is, of course, very difficult! If I understand you,\nMrs. Piper can somehow \" shunt out \" all the faculties which\nshe does shunt out, and yet \" often \" retain her normal intelli-\ngence, her powers of hearing, comparing, and inferring, while\nalso \" most of the time \" her hearing is very somnolent and\n\flxii.] Review. 99\ntherefore her inferences from what she dimly hears must be\nthe vaguest of dreams.\nPuzzled as every conscientious reader must be, one turns\nto the \"Notes of the Sittings,\" pp. 166-258. Here, one\nhopes, will be found contemporary records of the general keen\nalertness, and of the usual somnolent inefficiency, of Mrs. Piper's\nnormal sense of hearing.\nThe theory and method of the sittings is that Mrs. Piper,\nor her spiritual \" control,\" can only hear what is spoken loud\nto her right hand, which the control dominates. Your theory\nis that (a) Mrs. Piper's ear has its normal powers of hearing\n;\nand, again, (b) that it has not. In the records taken during\nthe sittings I find only the following notes which assert the\nreaction of Mrs. Piper, or of Hodgson, to sounds other than\nremarks shouted into her writing hand.\n(1) p. 195. \"Hodgson seems to break in, in response to\nsome unnoted remark from Mr. Dorr.\" The remark of Mr.\nDorr being \" unnoted \" we can say no more.\n(2) p. 229. Dr. Tanner had said to Dr. Hall \"with a\nlaugh \" that some undecipherable writing by Mrs. Piper\n\" looked as if it might be the be\"innimr of '\nHell and damna-\no o o\ntion.' \" The writing; hand remonstrated against what Dr.\nTanner had said.\nIn this instance Mrs. Piper, or \" Hodgson \" certainly heard\nwhat Dr. Tanner said, with a laugh, about Hell and damna-\ntion. This is, I think, the only instance of such hearing\nwhich is not matter of presumption and conjecture.\n(3) p. 229. A reference to Mr. Dorr's return to the room\nwhence he had made a pretence of departing. It is inferred\nthat Mrs. Piper heard some sound whence she inferred that a\ntrick was being played.\n(4) \" We talked to each other a minute or so. Presumably\nthe control heard, and went on\" (p. 241). But nothing in the\ncontext suggests that \" the control heard \" your conversation.\n(5) There followed (Fifth sitting) some futile attempts at\nexperiments to detect Mrs. Piper's powers of hearing, and Dr.\nTanner says \" I whispered to Dr. Hall to try to fool the\ncontrol . . . but 1 think that he heard me \"\n(p. 243).\nThis is only a conjecture of Dr. Tanner's : the \" control,\" in\nthese experiments, was not always easily \" fooled.\"\n\f100 Andrew Lang. [part\n(6) On p. 251 (Sixth sitting) several experiments on hearing\nare tried, and \" doubtless the control heard, the first time the\nquestion was asked,\" but this is the common \" doubtless \" of\nscience and means no more than that you prefer to suppose\nthat the \" control \" heard the question.\n(7) p. 256. A case of hearing what you and Dr. Tanner said\nto each other. What you said to each other involved an obvious\nmisinterpretation of what Mrs. Piper (or \" the control \") had\nbeen saying to you, and \" the control \" kept insisting on his\nown opinion.\nI can only find, as contemporary records of the acute\nhearing of Mrs. Piper in trance, these few cases, conjectures,\nand presumptions.\nOf the somnolence of the ear, \" most of the time,\" I find no\ncontemporary record.\nTo return to the contrast between your scanty contemporary\nnotes of your guesses that Mrs. Piper hears acutely in \" trance,\"\non one side, and your large general assertion, on the other,\nthat her hearing is acute, you say (p. 204), \"The left ear is\ncertainly awake, because, over and over, murmured words\nbetween those present, steps, rustles, laughs, and many other\nnoises are heard and reacted to, sometimes unexpectedly, by\nthe writer.\"\nWhere are your contemporary records of these many \" re-\nactions \" ? You give to the general reader your large assertion\non p. 264, lines 1-5. You contradict it (as far as I can\nunderstand you) on page 265, and all the exact evidence you\noffer for the assertion on page 264 is your \"doubtless,\" your\n\" I think,\" your \" presumably,\" with one or two certainties.\nYet on your theory of Mrs. Piper's acute hearing, you base\nyour theory of her alleged successes : surely there ought to\nbe more proofs both of the vigilance and of the somnolence\nof her sense of hearing.\nOnce more, you are singularly inattentive to your own con-\ntemporary reports of your six sittings. At the Fourth, after\nyou had told your \" involuted lies \" to \" Hodgson,\" Hodgson\nsaid \" I am interested in seeing how many stories you can\ntell in a minute. They (sic) awfully bad. They are awful\nwhoppers\" (p. 228). In the Sixth sitting (p. 255), Hodgson\nsays \" I have felt so keenly your various whoppers all this\n\fLXII.] Review. 101\ntime. ... I think I told you so before.\" (The dates of\nsittings are not given.)\nYour report, incredible as it seems, actually goes on :\n\" which\nhe certainly had not, having been trustful to the point of\ncredulity.\" Thus, when you reach page 255, you have for-\ngotten, beyond recall even by your proof sheets, what you\nhad chronicled on page 228,\u2014namely, \"Hodgson's\" detection\nand denunciation of your \" awful whoppers.\" You do not\nremember all this even when \"Hodgson\" (p. 255) says, \"I\nthink I told you so before.\" You reply \" which he certainly\nhad not.\" Yet he had ! Poor \" Hodgson's \" memory is much\nbetter than yours and Dr. Tanner's combined. It is you\nwho here \" display the inability that we should expect from\na secondary personality. .\n.\"\nThese notes deal only with the method and logic of your\ncontributions to the book of Dr. Tanner. Concerning Mrs.\nPiper, it is my opinion that if it were possible to put her\nfleshly ears out of action, without in any way injuring these\norgans, \" Hodgson,\" Eector and Co. would be deaf, and, of\ncourse, could not answer questions which could not reach\nthem, unless by dint of telepathy between the quick and the\ndead. If these spirits replied, and replied correctly, to ques-\ntions asked mentally by the sitters, their case would be much\nstronger, though, of course, not a crucial test. \" Nevertheless\nthe experiment ought to be made by some competent\nperson,\" writes Sir Oliver Lodge. When physical hearing\nhas been put out of action, then sitters need not shout, they\nmay put their questions mentally. But till these conditions\nare secured, I venture to think that experiments with Mrs.\nPiper are nugatory.\nI remain,\nYour obedient servant,\nA. Lang.\n\f102 Mrs. Henry Sidgtvick. [part\nREVIEW.\nStudies in Spiritism. By Amy E. Tanner, Ph.D. (D. Appleton &\nCo., New York and London, 1910, pp. 408.)\nMr. Lang deals above with Professor Stanley Hall's share in Dr.\nTanner's book Studies in Spiritism. A brief notice of the book as\na whole should perhaps be added.\nBut first let me say a few words about Mr. Lang's concluding\nparagraph, which it seems to me unduly depreciates Mrs. Piper's\nphenomena. I agree with him, as I think all who have sat with\nher in England do, in believing that the trance-personality hears in\na normal manner through Mrs. Piper's ears, and that its impression\nof hearing with the hand is a matter of self-suggestion. 1\n(It is a\npity that Mr. Hall and Miss Tanner did not succeed in stopping\nthe ears so as to put this beyond the possibility of question.) I\nalso agree with Mr. Lang that answers to mental questions would\ngreatly add to the evidence for thought-transference from the\nsitter, though scarcely at all, I may remark, to that for thought-\ntransference between Mrs. Piper and other automatists, for which\nthe evidence is in my opinion strong. But I cannot agree\nwith his view that without answers to mental questions from\nthe sitter experiments with Mrs. Piper are nugatory ; and in this\nI think that most of those who have studied fully the published\nreports of her sittings would agree with me. Does he perhaps, like\nProfessor Hall and Dr. Tanner, believe that the records are so\nincomplete that even important remarks by the sitter are omitted 1\nCertainly at sittings at which I have been present either as manager\nor sitter this has not been the case. It has never been assumed by\nme, nor I think by other English sitters, that any remark or sound\nmade in the room was inaudible to the trance-personality, and it\nsurprises me that Mr. Hall and Miss Tanner should ever have\n1\nCompare Mr. Myers' Human Personality, Vol. I., p. 192.\n\fLXII.] Review. ] OM\nacted as if this were so\u2014for instance, in the case referred to by Mr.\nLang above, No. 5, p. 99. I do not know Mr. Dorr's view, but it\nseems to me unlikely that in telling them \u2014if he did so\u2014that they\nmight talk freely to each other he meant to imply that they could\ncount on not being heard by the trance-personality.\nIt does not appear that the report by Professor Hall and Dr.\nTanner gives a complete account of all that happened at their six\nsittings, but probably what is reported is enough to enable us to form\na fair judgement of the whole. Nor does it seem likely that the\nomission to note all their own remarks (an omission which they\ncomplain of\u2014or perhaps too readily assume to have occurred\u2014in\nthe case of other sitters) has seriously, if at all, lessened the value\nof their sittings, which in other respects give the impression of\nbeing carefully recorded, and which form a useful addition to the\nmaterial for studying Mrs. Piper's trance state. Having no interest\nin keeping on friendly terms with the trance-personality, they were\nable to use methods scarcely open to those who wish to continue\nexperimenting\u2014in fact, in the language of the Hodgson control,\nthey told him \"awful whoppers.\" They thus induced HodgsonP\nto admit comradeship and common reminiscences with Professor\nHall, who says he never met Hodgson in the flesh ; and they\nsucceeded in obtaining messages from wholly fictitious friends\nand relations. Similarly, by substituting, unknown to the trance-\npersonality, or at least without his betraying that he detected the\nimposture, other objects for Hodgson's \"influences,\" 1\nthey showed\nthat the effect of these is probably due to suggestion, as in the\ncase of bread pills. These results will not, I think, surprise any\nof the English investigators, but it is useful to have experimental\ndemonstration of them.\nAttempts to persuade HodgsonP to deny his own identity failed\ncompletely, though I notice that Professor Hall is convinced that\nhe could have been bluffed out of existence had the effort\nbeen persisted in (p. xxiii.). Personally, I doubt whether the most\ntactful handling would, in Mrs. Piper's case, induce a supposed\ncommunicator to deny the identity he claimed ; but doubtless such\ncommunicators can be suppressed or encouraged by the sitters.\nMr. Hall and Miss Tanner also confirmed and extended some\n1\n\"Influences,\" that is objects which have been in physical contact with the\nsupposed communicator when in the body, though not a necessity, are supposed\nto help communication. They may serve to concentrate the attention of the\n-trance-personality, or their use may be purely suggestive.\n\f104 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nexperiments of Dr. Hodgson's 1\nshowing comparative insensibility of\nvarious kinds during trance. Their attempts at Freudian psycho-\nanalysis were incomplete and of little interest.\nThe accounts of the six sittings with Mrs. Piper held by Mr.\nHall and Miss Tanner occupy about one fourth of the book. There\nis also a little chapter, interesting from a psychological point of view,\ncalled \"The medium in germ,\" on two cases of incipient mediumship\nwhich had come under Miss Tanner's notice. The rest of the book\nconsists of discussions of Mrs. Piper's phenomena generally, of cross-\ncorrespondences, of the evidence for telepathy furnished by the Pro-\nceedings of the Society for Psychical Research and Phantasms of the\nLiving, of a chapter on Mrs. Verrall, and a discussion of the Census of\nHallucinations. Unfortunately brevity, hasty reading, and forgetful-\nness of \" the tremendous influence of a preconceived theory on one's\ninterpretations of facts\" (see p. 105) very much diminish the value\nof what Professor Hall describes as Miss Tanner's \"searching, im-\npartial, critical estimate\" (p. xxxiii). In fact her presentation of\nfacts and arguments cannot be assumed to be fair without reference\nto the originals. For persons with the original accounts before them\nher remarks might sometimes be useful, but my impression is that\nthey would seldom be found to add anything of value to what is\nput before the reader in the case as originally described, and\nthey constantly misrepresent the case and are essentially mis-\nleading. I have not, indeed, compared the criticism with the matter\ncriticised in all cases myself, and if I had it would obviously\nbe impossible to follow Miss Tanner throughout within the limits of\nthis notice. I will therefore content myself with giving a few of\nthe instances of inaccuracy, misinterpretation or curious reasoning\nthat have struck me in reading her book.\n(a) On p. 296, in discussing \"The Case of Mrs. Verrall,\" Miss\nTanner says :\n\" At various times the script attempted a word to be\nsent as a test to Dr. Hodgson, finally giving the words Ariadnes\nstella coronaria, and making an allusion to another constella-\ntion, Berenice's hair. Dr. Hodgson in reply said that he had\nthought about syringas in connexion with her script, and that\nsyringas had a special significance for him. Now the Latin name\nfor syringa is Philadelphus Coronarius, and the combined reference\nto Ariadne's crown and Berenice's hair is supposed by Mrs. Verrall\nto be intended to recall Philadelphus or brotherly love. 7'his is rather\nfar-fetched, however.\" I raise no objection to the abstract till we\n1\nProceedings, Vol. VIII., p. 4.\n\fLXII.] Revieiv. 105\ncome to the part I have put in italics. Mrs. Verrall says nothing\nabout brotherly love. What she does say is \" that the introduc-\ntion of Berenice was accounted for, if what was wanted was not\nonly coronarius but Philadelphia\n\" l\n; and in case by chance any one\nshould fail to remember the close association, in history, of the\nnames Berenice and Ptolemy Philadelphus, she refers to it in a\nfoot-note. This is not far-fetched at all.\n(b) Here (pp. 136, 137) is an attempt to provide a common train\nof thought in three automatists to account for cross-correspondences\non the words 'cup' and 'Diana,' and (in two of them) references\nto Macbeth. Miss Tanner says :\n\" We got a clew here in the fact\nthat Henry Irving played 'Macbeth' and 'The Cup' in London\nthat winter, though we are not told just when.\" She doubtless\nrefers to a conjecture of Mr. Piddington's as to association of ideas\nin one of the scripts. He says (Proc, Vol. XXII., p. 206): \"The\nconjunction of allusions to Macbeth, The Cup, and a '\nHenry '\n[in Mrs.\nHolland's script] was, perhaps, due to an association of ideas with\nHenry Irving, who produced, and acted in, these two plays.\"\n\"That winter\" is an interpolation of Miss Tanner's and, as that\nwinter was 1906-7, and Henry Irving died in 1905, and, I may add,\nat no time acted in Macbeth and The Cup in the same year,'2\nis\nobviously an erroneous one. So that clue fails.\n(c) The following is a specimen of Miss Tanner's arguments. On\np. 344 she refers to the case of Miss R. seeing the face of Mrs. J. W.\nin two places nearly or quite at once on the night of Mr. J. W.'s\ndeath (Journal S.P.R., Vol. XII, p. 317). Miss R. unfortunately\nfailed to note the experience in writing, though she specially\nobserved the hour, till two days later when she heard of the death.\n\"This,\" says Miss Tanner, \"is an excellent illustration of the defects\nin all testimony in which the vision is not written out prior to the\nknowledge of the death. What proof is there that this is not an\nillusory memory, especially if, as seems to be the case, Miss R.\nis given to vivid images and feelings of premonition 1\" (Whence she\ngets this impression about Miss R.'s tendencies to vivid images, etc.,\nI do not know. Miss R.'s own statement is: \"To the best of my\nbelief I have never seen an appearance of any similar kind before.\")\nThe case would, of course, have been more cogent if a note had been\n1\nSee Pi-oceedings, Vol. XX., p. .309.\n- The Ctip was produced by Irving at the Lyceum in 1881, and has not been\nplayed in London since. Macbeth was played by him in 1875 and again in\n1888.\n\f106 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nmade, but even taking Miss Tanner's abridged account, and still\nmore with the details given in the original, it appears to me to be\none where illusion of memory is improbable. However, Miss Tanner\nthinks differently, and having persuaded herself that there probably\nwas illusion of memory, she goes further and actually regards the\ncase as evidence that such illusions are common. She says: \"Such\na case . . . convinces us that illusions of memory even within a few\ndays of the event may be so common as to invalidate every case\nexcept those in which the hallucination is written out in detail at\nthe time and before the corresponding event is known.\"\n(d) Here is another specimen of Miss Tanner's arguments. She\nrefers with well-merited admiration to Mr. Davey's experiments\n(Proc, Vol. IV.), showing how inaccurate observation and memory of\nconjuring tricks is. Then, criticising the evidence for apparitions at\nthe time of death, and referring to the paucity of contemporary\ndocuments, she says (p. 352): \"Does it not seem curious that a\ncommittee [the Census Committee] cognisant of Mr. Davey's brilliant\ndemonstration of the transpositions and lapses of memory within\neven one hour after the event should base a supposedly scientific\nargument for telepathy on evidence of this sort?\" The value of the\nevidence is of course greatly diminished by absence of contemporary\nnotes. At the same time, the kind of lapse of observation and\nmemory involved in misstatements in the case of accounts of Mr.\nDavey's conjuring tricks is very different from that in accounts of\napparitions at the time of death. For instance, I should unhesitat-\ningly assume Miss Tanner's account of a conjuring trick witnessed but\nnot understood by her to be inaccurate, though given immediately\nafter witnessing it, because I should know that the conjuror had tried\nto give her false impressions at the time, and because I should\nfeel sure that the numerous small incidents which went to make\nup the whole occurrence, and to which she had no clue, would tend\nto get misplaced or forgotten even when observed. But if Miss\nTanner told me that Miss Smith called on her at three o'clock on\nSaturday afternoon I should have no reason to doubt her word\n;\nthough, of course, if anything of importance turned on the exact\nday and hour of the call it would be desirable to enquire whether\nshe or others could bring forward corroborative circumstances con-\nfirming her recollection.\n(e) Here is an instance of Miss Tanner's conjectural explanations\n{p. 58). At a sitting with Mrs. Piper which Sir Oliver Lodge was\nmanaging, and at which he was himself taking notes, a \" Mr.\n\fLXII.] Review. 107\nWilson,\" deceased, professed through the Phinuit control to send\nmessages to his son, who was not present. The following is an\nextract from the report\n:\n\"... He lives somewhere in your neighbourhood\n0. J. L. Yes he does.\nand has got a friend named Bradley\u2014a very great friend\nof his. He thought first of being a doctor. ...\"\nThe son had never thought of being a doctor, but when the\nremark was made at the sitting Sir Oliver thought it correctly\nrepresented something he had been told by the son. His inference\nfrom this, and from the fact that of other statements made by\n'Mr. Wilson' those only referring to matters known to Sir Oliver\nwere correct, is that \"a great deal of this looks obviously like\nthought-transference.\" On this Miss Tanner comments, \"Doubtless\nthere was thought-transference, but it was done by Sir Oliver\ninvoluntarily betraying his opinion to Phinuit, I would venture to\nsay.\" Now how does one, when there is no beating about the bush,\ninvoluntarily betray an impression of the sort in question 1 Does\nDr. Tanner think that Sir Oliver unconsciously whispered \" he\nthought first of being a doctor\" and that Phinuit repeated it after\nhim ? Or does she believe that Sir Oliver's contemporary notes are\nas much abbreviated, or abstracted with a bias, as the accounts of\ncases in her book ? Surely in this case a more plausible alternative\nhypothesis to telepathy would be that Phinuit made a guess which\naccidentally coincided with Sir Oliver's idea.\nDr. Tanner gives two chapters to \"Telepathy and other Allied\nPhenomena,\" and rather strangely says (p. 321) that under the name\nof telepathy \" are grouped all such things as crystal gazing, veridical\ndreams, death warnings, premonitions that come true, automatic\nwriting, and even spirit communication itself by some.\" In the first\nof the two chapters she discusses spontaneous and experimental\nthought-transference. (I am interested, by the way, to learn that\nthe experiments at Brighton in 1889-90, in which I took a large part,\n\"are now discredited,\" p. 326. This is news to me.) In the second\nof the two chapters Miss Tanner discusses the \" Census of Hallucina-\ntions.\" It is curious to find her saying after this (p. 365) :\n\" The\ngreat trouble with the cases for all sorts of telepathy is that it is\nalmost, if not quite, impossible to collect all the negative instances,\nfor that would mean devoting one's time to writing down the\nthoughts which bring up persons. We cannot even begin to calculate\nthe probabilities in the case until we know something more of the\n\f108 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nnumbers of negative cases.\" It was a principal object of the\n\" Census of Hallucinations,\" to compare the number of coincidental\nwith non-coincidental\u2014-positive with negative\u2014hallucinations, and\nMiss Tanner actually discusses the chapter on recognised apparitions\nwhere the proportion of these occurring within twelve hours of the\ndeath of the person seen is compared with the proportion of such\ncoincidences that chance alone would give (and shown, of course,\nenormously to exceed it). It seems possible, however, that she has\nnot altogether understood the object of a calculation which she has\ncertainly failed to follow, and of which she gives an account on\np. 350, which is neither correct nor intelligible.\nI could multiply instances of inaccuracy and misrepresentation,\nalso of the use of misleading phrases, such as those by which Miss\nTanner seems to suggest that \" the Psychical Researchers \" are collec-\ntively responsible for the opinions of any one interested in Psychical\nResearch. But I have, I think, said enough. It is likely enough\nthat the book will impress those who derive their knowledge of\nthe evidence discussed from it alone ; but a very different view will\nbe formed by those who are able to check Dr. Tanner's version of\nthe evidence by reference to the original sources. As Dr. Tanner\nis a professional psychologist, and presumably therefore aims at\nlearning and expounding the truth, the book must be regarded\nas failing in its object.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\fLXII.] \" The One-Horse Dawn.\" 109\n\" THE ONE-HOESE DA.WN:\"\nAdditional Note on an Experiment Described in\n\"Proceedings,\" Vol. XX., pp. 156-167.\nBy Mrs. A.

The first closely recalls the illustration in the\nOrestes, suggesting, as Euripides does, a revolution of the heavens\nfrom West to East.

[part\nsome communications which I have had with Mrs. Willett\nthrough the post, after hearing about her through Mrs. Verrall\nand seeing some of the material which she had produced.\nConcerning Mrs. Willett herself the following statements\nhave been made by Mrs. Verrall in a letter to me, dated\n23 February, 1910.\nStatement by Mrs. Verrall concerning Mrs. Willett.\nShe is not a member of the S.P.R., and has never seen anj'\npapers whatever in proof. She knows no one who attends meetings,\nand it is therefore most unlikely that she should even know the\nnames of papers read there, and impossible, I think, that she should\nknow anything of the contents. She has, however, read and anno-\ntated Mr. Piddington's paper (Vol. XXII.), and has similarly read\nMiss Johnson's paper (Vol. XXL).\nI have notes stating exactly what scripts she has seen. 1\n. . . When\nI stayed with her in January last ... I was extremely careful to\nsay nothing about any of the recent unpublished papers prepared\nfor the forthcoming volume of Proceedings. . . .\nShe knows that there have been cross-correspondences between\nHelen and me in England and Mrs. Piper in America. She knows\nabsolutely nothing in detail. . . .\nI have had many opportunities of checking Mrs. Willett's accuracy\nof memory and statement, and have always found it very marked.\nShe is an excellent witness in every way, and her own statement\ncould, I feel sure, be entirely depended upon.\nSo much for Mrs. Verrall's statement concerning this lady.\nMiss Alice Johnson, Eesearch Officer to the S.P.K., has now\nmade her acquaintance, and has formed a very favourable\nimpression. Appended is her first-hand statement.\n1\nIn the course of my correspondence with Mrs. Willett I found that\nreferences to her had been made in the scripts of other automatists, and\nas her collaboration was helpful in the elucidation of such references, I\nhave sent her from time to time copies of my daughter's scripts and my own,\nas well as of some parts of the Mac scripts (now published in Proc. Vol.\nXXIV., p.\n-\n264). It will be seen that a few of the phrases in the scripts\nquoted in this paper are derived from these sources.

V.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some Nexv Script. 115\nMiss Johnsons Statement concerning Mrs. Willctt.\nJuly 22nd, 1910.\nI was introduced by Mrs. Verrall to Mrs. \"Willett in the early\npart of this year, and have had several opportunities of talking with\nher about her script and the circumstances under which it has been\nproduced. As to the result of these interviews, I concur absolutely\nin Mrs. Verrall's opinion expressed above. I am confident that Mrs.\nWillett's testimony is given under a strict sense of responsibility\nand with ever}' care to make it as accurate as possible. She is by\nno means devoid of critical faculty, and is, I think, accurate by\nnature in regard to essentials of evidence. I should without hesita-\ntion accept any statement from her as to the extent of her normal\nsupraliminal knowledge of topics in her script, and I believe she is\nextremely careful to give whatever information she possesses that\nwould bear on this point, or on the equally important question of\nmatters that mav once have been within her knowledge and since\nforgotten.\nSupplementary Preliminary Statement by 0. J. L.\nFor my own part T am assured not only of Mrs. \"Willett's\ngood faith, and complete absence of anything that can be called\neven elementary classical knowledge, but also of the scrupulous\ncare and fidelity with which she records her impressions, and\nreports every trace of normal knowledge which seems to her\nto have any possible bearing upon the script. We are able\nin fact to regard her as a colleague in the research, in the\nsame sort of way that we are able to regard Mrs. Holland.\nI may also emphasise the fact that the scripts dealt with\nbelow were copied, and the copies sent to me at once, by Mrs.\nWillett. Occasionally, when anything seemed specially import-\nant, the original was sent to me\u2014either with or without a\ncopy ; and when this was not done, the original was always\ndeposited, in a sealed envelope, with some responsible person\nliving in another house,\u2014so as to get a postmark and an\nendorsement of receipt, that there might be no sort of\nmistake or question about the date, if that happened to turn\nout to be an important item. This is a good precaution to\ntake in such cases, when possible cross-correspondence may be\n\f116 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\nanticipated, and when the writing as it comes is largely unin-\ntelligible to the automatist.\nEdmund Gurney is supposed to be the chief communicator\nor manager of Mrs. Willett's automatism, and many messages\ncome from him; but occasionally we are told that \"Myers\" is\nin touch with \" the machine,\" and some episodes connected\nwith what it is convenient to call Myersw, shall be narrated.\nThe chief portion of what I have first to report takes its origin\nin a question which Mr. Dorr, of Boston, U.S.A., asked of a\nMyers control, through Mrs. Piper, in America in March, 1908.\nThe answers then and there received have been studied by\nMr. Piddington, were found to be of singular interest, and were\nreported on by him to a private meeting of the Society held\non Oct. 28, 1909\u2014his paper being read to the meeting by Miss\nHelen Verrall. At this date Mrs. Willett was living in a remote\npart of the country and there is no reason to suppose that\nshe ever saw the Journal of the Society. Moreover, no details\nat all are given of this paper in the Journal. It is only\nreferred to (in October and November, 1909) under the title,\n\" Some Classical Allusions in Mrs. Piper's Trance,\" and was not\npublished in the Proceedings (Part LX.) until April, 1910.\nI myself had heard of the paper beforehand and had read\nparts of it ; so in September it occurred to me that it would\nbe instructive to ask the Myers-like influence operating through\nMrs. Willett the very same question as had been asked of the\nMyers control working through Mrs. Piper. At this period I\nhad not had first-hand experience of Mrs. Willett's phenomena,\nthough I had made her acquaintance in London on the 17th of\nMay, 1909; but inasmuch as the character of the \"Myers\"\ncommunications coming through her had favourably impressed\nme, I wrote with some care to her on 28 Sept., 1909, enclos-\ning a question in a sealed envelope for her to open at any\nconvenient time when it seemed likely that script would be\nforthcoming.\nLetter from 0. J. L. to Mrs. Willett, dated 28th Sept. 1909.\nI want to ask F. W. H. M. a question a projws of nothing, and\npropose to enclose it for you to use when you have an opportunity.\nIt is a very short one, but more important than it will sound.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 117\nIt may be best not to open it till you feel ready to communicate\nit.\nThe answer may take some time before it is complete, but a\nrecord of everything said, gibberish or otherwise, \u2014perhaps especially\non the first occasion\u2014may be important.\nThe envelope enclosed in this letter of mine to Mrs. Willett\nwas stuck up and endorsed by me as intended for F. W. H. M.\nthrough Mrs. Willett, under date 29 Sept., 1909.\nIt happened that she was not doing any automatic writing\nat this time, and therefore did not open the envelope till\nsome months later. It was subsequently returned to me at\nmy request for inspection, and on the tongue is now written\nin Mrs. Willett's writing :\n\" Opened by me\nFeb. 4, 1910\nThe sheet of paper enclosed in the envelope runs as follows:\nMariemont, Edgbaston, 29 Sept. 1909.\nMy dear Myers, I want to ask you a question\u2014not an idle one.\nWhat does the word Lethe suggest to you?\nIt may be that you will choose to answer piece-meal and at\nleisure. There is no hurry about it. Oliver Lodge.\nMy object of course was to see whether what we may call\nthe \" Willett-Myers \" could exhibit a train of recollection\nsimilar to that of the \" Piper-Myers,\" when stimulated by one\nand the same question. And the circumstances were such that\neven if identically the same train of memories were tapped\n\u2014\nwhich on any hypothesis was improbable\u2014the evidence would\nbe good for something supernormal, though in that case it\nmight have to be assumed that the supernormality was limited\nto telepathy from the living.\nBut the answers that I got through Mrs. Willett were supple-\nmentary to, and by no means identical with, those obtained\nthrough Mrs. Piper. They contain a common element, and in\nmy judgement are characteristic of the same personality, but\nthey are not identical.\n\f118 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nIn speaking for the moment of \" the same personality,\" I\nmust guard against the supposition that I regard the Piper-\nMyers, the Willett-Myers, the Verrall-Myers, the Holland-\nMyers, as all exactly the same. On the assumption that they\nall include something of a real \" Myers,\" the mixed or com-\npound personalities should all contain a common element, and\nthis common element may he dominant or recessive, according\nto circumstances ; but on any hypothesis we must expect the\nmessages as we receive them to be more or less sophisti-\ncated by the instrument through which the communications\nare made. The personalities would probably differ, as Miss\nJohnson has clearly pointed out (Proc. Vol. XXIV., p. 262),\nsomewhat as chemical compounds may differ when they all\ncontain a common element. In no case do we get the Myers\nelement pure and undiluted. Sometimes it comes out more\nclearly than at others, but it must surely be influenced by\nthe material channel through which it conveys its intelligence\n\u2014especially j^erhaps as regards the literary form which the\ncommunications take,\u2014and we may expect that the range of\n\" Myers \" reminiscences which can be tapped by such means\nmust be limited, or at least curbed to some extent in power\nof expression, by the range of memory and association\u2014or\nas some might say by the brain deposit\u2014of the person through\nwhom the answers are obtained.\nIn the case of an entranced medium, like Mrs. Piper, I\nshould anticipate that more complete control could be exer-\ncised, and that the inevitable sophistication would be less\n\u2014\nwhen the conditions are favourable\u2014than with a medium\nnot entranced ; and it may thus be possible sometimes, and\nwith difficulty, to get recorded words or signs alien to the\nmind of the automatist ;\n\u2014who indeed is then, I am inclined\nto think, not so much an automatist influenced tele-\npathically, as an automaton or agency or machine \" possessed\n\"\nfor the time by some experienced and managing \" control,\"\nwho operates dynamically or telcrgically. That at any rate\nseems a legitimate working hypothesis ; but in all probability\nthe grades and shades of mediumship are very various, and\nfor my own part I have not found any two precisely alike.\nWith more experience we shall be able to classify them, I\nexpect ; but the classes will probably, as usual, shade off into\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 119\neach other, and there will be no clear lines or boundaries of\ndemarcation.\nIt is becoming clear to me that when communications are\nbeing sent, in such cases as those of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland,\nand Mrs. Willett, the process consists in a kind of selection\nrather than in creation or origination. Original thoughts may\nsometimes be passed through, but the easiest method is to find\nin the mind or perhaps in the brain of the medium some deposit\nof reminiscence which can be evoked or stimulated, and which\ncan convey approximately something like the idea required. It\ndoes not appear to be at all easy to impress people with\nmeaningless or foreign words or sentences, but reservoirs of\npartial knowledge can, it appears, be tapped sometimes and\nutilised in such a way that an intelligent and patient reader\ncan clearly make out the underlying meaning and connexion,\nfrom what is \" got through.\"\nBut on this hypothesis it is manifestly natural that the\nassociations expressed through different channels shall be\ndifferently worded, shall fall into different groups, and shall be\nvery far from being identical in phrase and detail. Part of\nthese differences may be reasonably attributed to an intelligent\ndesire of the control to avoid direct telepathy, or any appearance\nof direct telepathy, between the automatists. But another part\nmay I think be reasonably attributed to the fundamental\ndifficulties grouped round the subject, and to the conditions\nunder which alone communications of this kind are possible.\nA statement made by Myersw is of interest in this connexion.\nHe recognises that the use of different automatists to convey\na single idea necessitates attention to various forms or modes\nof expressing that idea; for in a Willett script of Feb. 10,\n1910 (reported more fully in Part II. below), occur the words:\nThat I have to use different scribes means that I must show\ndifferent aspects of thought, underlying which unity is to be found. 1\nFor a further discussion of this matter, the section in Miss\nJohnson's paper below on \" The Principle of Selection in the\nProduction of Scripts \" may be referred to.\nl\nlt will he observed that the Willett script, like that of Airs. Holland, uses\nthe word \"scribe\" in the sense of automatist.\n\f120 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nPART I.\nCONCERNING THE SCRIPT OF 4 FEBRUARY, 1910.\nChap. I. The Lethe-Dork Episode in Willett Script.\nI will first briefly summarise the answers which were given\nto Mr. Dorr's question about Lethe, when first addressed to\nthe Myers control through Mrs. Piper in America, and then\nI will reproduce and fully discuss the answers which were\ngiven to the same question when put by me to the communicator\nthrough Mrs. Willett in this country.\nIt will be noticed that the object of the interrogator in the\ntwo cases somewhat differed. Mr. Dorr's object was to stimulate\nthe classical interest, and tap the classical and literary reminis-\ncences, of the Piper-Myers. Hence he asked many questions, of\nwhich that concerning Lethe was one. Whereas my object was\nchiefly to ascertain whether the Willett-Myers could show any\nrecollection of the previous question, and whether it would\ngive at all similar answers. In the result I may say at once\nthat a recollection of Mr. Dorr as having been associated with\nthis question was clearly indicated ; and I may further say that\nthe answers obtained in the two cases, though they both\nsi lowed remarkable classical knowledge decidedly beyond that of\nthe questioner, did not on the whole relate to the same topics.\nIn answer to this particular question, MyersP referred mainly to\nincidents narrated by Ovid,\u2014Myersw mostly to subjects treated\nof by Virgil ;\nthough undoubtedly both controls showed a\nfamiliarity with Virgil, as well as with other literature. And\nin some cases there was an overlapping of reminiscence of a\nvery appropriate and remarkable kind.\nTo give any adequate idea of the force and meaning of all\nthe allusions will need a detailed analysis, such as has already\nbeen performed in Part LX. (Vol. XXIV.) and in other volumes\nof the Proceedings by those who have written the papers con-\ntained therein. Every such analysis involves labour, as well\nas knowledge and ingenuity, and I am glad to say that Mrs.\nVerrall will supplement my paper by an analysis of this kind,\napplied to two of the Willett scripts.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 121\nThe answers to the Lethe question obtained through Mrs.\nPiper are now published in Part LX. (March, 1910) of the\nProceedings (Vol. XXIV.). They contain references to \" cave,\"\n\" Olympus,\" \" Iris,\" \" flowery banks,\" \" Somnus,\" \" Morpheus,\"\n\" Ceyx,\" \u2022\nand \" poppies,\" all of which are explained by Mr.\nPiddington as reminiscences of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Book XI.\nThey also, however, contain the word \" Sibyl.\" which suggests\na Virgilian connexion with Lethe ; for it was in the company\nof the Sibyl of Cumse that ^Eneas saw the river of Lethe\nflowing by the Elysian fields.\nOther classical references from the same and the preceding-\nBook of the Metamorphoses were likewise given to Mr. Dorr\nthrough Mrs. Piper in connexion with his Lethe question,\n\u2014\ninvolving such names as Orpheus and Eurydice, Pygmalion,\nHyacinthus. The real intention of none of these references\nwas understood by Mr. Dorr at the time, as is clear from his\nown contemporary comments upon them.1\nWillett Script.\nI shall now give the answers which were written through\nMrs. Willett's hand, when she, in solitude, on Eeb. 4, 1910,\nhad opened my question and read it (so to speak) to the\nintelligence which at the time was controlling her hand and\nproducing automatic writing.\nI must first explain that in the automatic writings of Mrs.\nWillett, the name of the ostensible communicator not only\ncomes at the beginning, but is repeated at intervals throughout\nthe script. The object of this repetition of the name is not\nquite clear, but it seems to be a plan adopted of fixing the\ncommunicator's own attention to the matter in hand ;\nwhile it\noccasionally serves as a sort of punctuation-mark or break, like a\nfull stop or the beginning of a new paragraph. It also has\nthe effect of keeping constantly before us the identity of the\nostensible communicator ; but in reading it is best to ignore\nmost of these interruptions.\n1\nIn her paper below Mrs. Verrall gives summarised details concerning Mr.\nDorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper during December, 1908, and March, 1909,\n\u2014\nwhich are dates later than those of the sittings dealt with in Mr. Piddington's\npaper.\n\f122 Sir Oliver Lodge. [PART\nThe writing of the script is legible enough. Unlike Mrs.\nPiper's, but like much of Mrs. Holland's, it is continuous, the\nwords all running together. The hand-writm\" does not seem\nto me to be like any one's in particular : it is large and feature-\nless. I have at a later stage seen this script being pro-\nduced ;\nit is rapidly written, and appears to come quite\nautomatically. Occasionally it contains remarks addressed to\nthe automatist herself, such as \"take a fresh pen,\" \"let the\nhand go,\" \" don't scrawl,\" etc., etc.\nIn sending me the script, Mrs. Willett accompanied it by a\nletter written on the same clay and posted on the next, which\nran thus\n:\nI opened your sealed envelope, No. 1, to-day during the script\nwhich I now send.

Xo connexion in fact exists between\nLethe and Dorr, except the fact, unknown to Mrs. Willett, that\na Mr. Dorr of Boston had asked a Myers control, through the\nentranced Mrs. Piper, a question about Lethe\u2014the same\nquestion as the one which I now addressed to what purported\nto be the same personality communicating through Mrs. Willett.\nMiss Johnson informs me that Part LX. of Proceedings, though\ndated March, 1910, was not issued from the printer till April 9,\nalso that she posted a special copy to Mrs. AVillett on April 19.\nBefore that date Mrs. Willett was entirely in ignorance of the\nanswers which Mr. Dorr had obtained through Mrs. Piper, and\nindeed of the fact that any such question had been put.\nFurther references to this matter, emphasising the importance\nof it as seen from \" the other side,\" appear in later scripts.\nOn February 10th, 1910, for instance, the script begins as\nfollows\n:\nMyers yes I am ready I know what Lodge WANTS he\nwants to prove that I have access to knowledge shown elsewhere\nMyers.\n[Then after a few literary references it goes on :]\nDorr's scheme excellent Myers that I have to use different\nscribes means that I must show different aspects of thought\nunderlying which Unity is to be found. 1\nThe first intimation that the normal and supraliminal Mrs.\nWillett had of the real meaning of the name Dorr in this\nconnexion was through Part LX. of the Proceedings S.P.E., con-\ntaining Mr. Piddington's paper. This was received by her for\nthe first time on 20th April, 1910, as she thus reported to\nme on April 2 9 th, 1910 :\nMiss Alice Johnson sent me the last Proceedings. I have only\nhad time to glance through part of it \u2014but you can imagine my\nsurprise when I caught sight of the words\nLethe . . .

And I think I see parts of my\nScript about Lethe have links with the answers through Mrs. Piper.\nThis is a tremendous encouragement to me, for 'they' are ofcen so\npuzzling and confusing that I get fits of discouragement about the\nvalue of my script.\nIn any communications subsequent to this date, April 20,\n1910, it must be remembered that the newly-published Part\nLX. has been seen by Mrs. Willett.\nSubsequent references in, Willett Scrijrt, to the Dorr- Lethe episode.\nOn May 1st, 1910, the following came from Myersw :\nI laboured terribly to get clear with Dorr. The same plan might\nbe carried out with more intelligence and less confusion to trance\npersonalities. That is the difficulty. If the sitter has not got the\nknowledge which makes the matter intelligible, he blunders in and\nas it were alters the \" points,\" switching the trains on to wrong\npoints. But if on the other hand the sitter has got the knowledge,\nthen you will say that it is merely subliminal Piper groping about\nin the mind of the sitter. Those are the horns.\nQuite true ; and of the two horns I prefer the former.\nBut this Dorr episode was not quite finished with, even\nnow; for on June 5th, 1910, I received the following script\nby post from Mrs. Willett :\nPluto and Bees\nRe Lethe\nI said there was a pun somewhere\nI meant in my own Sc not in Plu (scribble) not in either plato\nor others I Myers made a pun I got in a WORD I wanted\nby wrapping it up in a QUOTATION\nLater I got the WORD itself after an effort which disturbed\nmy Machine and which Gurney deprecated as being an exp\nexemplification of the End justifies the Means Gurney tell me\nLodge can you find it now Myers I got the WORD in by choosing\na quotation in which it occurs and which was known to the\nNormal Intelligence of my Machine Write the word Selection\nWho selects my friend Piddington?\nI address this question to Piddington Who Selects.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 129\nSome expansion of this important topic of \" selection \" will\nbe found in a paper on the subject by Miss Johnson below,\np. 282.\nThe statement about the pun had come in a script of March\n7th, 1910, before Mrs. W. had received Part LX. of Proceedings,\nin this way\n:\nWrite again the Nightingale\n1 want that seen to 1\nPluto not not Plato this time but PLUTO\nBees Bees the hum of Bees\nMyers there was a pun but I do not want to say where.\nWe had taken this to refer to some classical pun, and I\nhad a long and fruitless hunt for it. The script of June 5th,\n1910, which I have already quoted, was in answer to a written\nstatement about my failure to find a pun in connexion with\neither Bees or Pluto or Lethe. The explanation given on\nJune 5th clearly showed me what pun was intended, especially\nwhen taken in connexion with the following communication\nwhich had come on May 6th, 1910:\nEdmund Gurney Tell Lodge I don't want this to develop into\ntrance. You have got that, we are doing something new.\n[It then went on to say that the method now usuallj' employed\nwas telepathic, not telergic, and added\u2014].\nIf you want to see the labour of getting anything telergic done\nhere [you] can see the word Dorr.\nThat word had to bo given in that wa37\n,\nafter efforts had been\nmade to convey it telepathically without success.\nIt was a great strain on both sides.\nWe don't want to move any atoms in the brain directly.\nVery well then, the meaning clearly is that the pun was in\nconnexion with the word \" Dorr \" ; that is to say, the word\n\"Dorr\" had first been given as part of a quotation familiar\n1\nThe Nightingale was mentioned on Feb. 10, 1910, in the second Lethe\nscript, quoted below, p. 148, and was at once identified as Keats' \" Nightiugale \"\n(p. 158). The desire expressed by Myers,v to have it again written and \"seen\nto\" suggests that at this time the whole point had not been apprehended; and\nin fact the complete associations with the word were not worked out till con-\nsiderably after March 7, 1910 (see below, p. 159, and Mrs. Vertall's paper,\npp. 206-9).\nI\n\f130 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nto the automatist, though inasmuch as it would probably not\nin that form be recognised, it was given next day with\nspecial, almost unjustifiable, effort, in a quite exceptional\nmanner, so as to get it clearly and unmistakably recorded\nthe day after the envelope containing the question had been\nopened.\nI naturally looked back, therefore, to see what familiar\nquotation was intended, in the script that had come immediately\nafter the envelope had been opened (Feb. 4), and it quite\nplainly was the following\n:\nGo not to Lethe Myers\nMyers there was the door to which I found no key and Haggi\nBabba too\nThis is disconnected but not meaningless.\nThe introduction \" Go not to Lethe \" (from Keats's Ode\nto Melancholy\u2014quoted also in a script of Miss Helen Verrall's\nof Nov. 5, 1908, which Mrs. Willett had seen\u2014) is employed\nhere, 1 presume, merely as a quotational way of switching\nthe subject straight back to Lethe before introducing the word\nrequired to be given in answer to the question \" What\ndoes Lethe suggest to you.\" The answer intended is that\none of the suggestions conveyed by the word Lethe was the\nrecollection of Mr. Dorr, who in America had asked precisely\nthe same question through Mrs. Piper. And the mode of trans-\nmission adopted, in order to get this meaningless name recorded,\nis by stimulating the automatist to reproduce a familiar quota-\ntion from Omar Khayyam\u2014\" There was the door to which I\nfound no key.\"\nBy \" Haggi Babba \" I understand an attempt at Ali Baba, of\nAli Baba and the Forty Thieves, and a reference to the door of\n\" Open Sesame.\" But whether or not that is so, the pun is\nclearly on the woi'd \" door,\" showing that an effort was made\nto give this sort of key-word on the very first occasion the\nquestion had been seen (Feb. 4); though it was not till the\nnext day that it could be given, by special effort, in an unmis-\ntakable, properly spelt, and clearly recognisable fashion.\nFor further information, see Mrs. Verrall's supplementary\npaper, below.\n(End, of \" Dorr \" e\nr\npisode.)\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 131\nChap, II. Lethe and \" The Will to live.\"\nI now take the more literary references in this same piece\nof Willett script recorded above, p. 123, as produced on 4th\nFeb., 1910, and quote them in order.\nThe first answer, given directly the question had been read,\nwas\n:\nThe Will again to live the Will again to live\nthe River of forgetfulness.\nNow, to any one familiar with the Sixth Book of the JEneid\n(as I regret to say I then was not, though perhaps for\nevidential reasons my ignorance was in this case useful),\n\" the Will again to live \" is an admirable sentence to be sug-\ngested by the idea of Lethe. For it is when iEneas, while\nvisiting the Underworld in company with Anchises, sees the\nriver of Lethe, that he also sees mustering on its banks the\nsouls who have been purified from the stains of their former\nexistence, and who are destined to live on earth once more.\nThey assemble on the banks, like bees humming round lilies,\nwaiting until their turn comes to drink the water of forget-\nfulness so that they may wish for a new terrestrial existence.\nThis is a famous passage of Virgil, and has been translated\nby Myers himself in his Essay on Virgil (Classical Essays,\np. 174):\n\" And last to Lethe's stream on the ordered day,\nThese all God summoneth in great array ;\nWho from that draught reborn, no more shall know\nMemory of past or dread of destined woe,\nBut all shall there the ancient pain forgive,\nForget their life, and will again to live.\"\nThus the actual words, \" will again to live,\" occur in\nconnexion with Lethe in F. W. H. Myers's poem ; and these\nwords, it must be noted, had not long ago caught the eye of\nMrs. Willett herself, for in her annotations on the script, when\nit was sent to me, there is at these words the following note :\nI recognise this as a quotation from one of Mr. Myers's Poems,\u2014\nI think, but am not certain\u2014from his Essay on Virgil. [For fuller\ndetail see letters quoted on pp. 142, 3 below.]\n\f132 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nShe did not appear to have noticed any connexion between\nthese words and Lethe\u2014-and she had not yet seen Part LX.\nof Proc, Vol. XXIV., where in a footnote a connexion is\nindicated.\nNevertheless, if this were the only incident, we should\nhave to assume that this part of the answer emanated from\nher subconscious and lapsed memory.\nI find, indeed, that the stanza just quoted occurs not only\nin the Essay on Virgil, but was incorporated by Mr. Myers,\nin modified form, in his original and published poem called\n\" The Passing of Youth.\" (See the Renewal of Youth and other\nPoems, p. 136.)\n\"God the innumerous souls in great array\nTo Lethe summons by a wondrous way,\nTill these therein their ancient pain forgive ;\nForget their life, and will again to live.\"\nIt may be noted here that the very first answer given by\nthe Piper-Myers to Mr. Dorr's question, as soon as he had got\nthe word, was\nLethe. Do you refer to one of my poems 1 (See Proc. XXIV.,\np. 87.)\nA recollection of the above quoted passage may well be\nsupposed to underlie and to justify this reference; which\nhitherto has been thought by us to be inappropriate, since Mr.\nPiddington had failed to discover a reference to Lethe in\nF. W. H. Myers's original poems.\nComing back now to Mrs. Willett again, I say that if\n\" the will again to live \" had been the only answer to the\nquestion about Lethe, although we should have recognised its\nextreme appropriateness,1\nwe should have had to refer it to\nthe subconsciousness of Mrs. Willett, because she had certainly\n1\nFor instance, Mrs. Verrall makes note concerning it as follows : \u2014The point\nhere to my mind is that exactly the right reminiscence was selected for the first\nanswer. Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would associate Lethe with forget-\nfulness, whereas here it is, quite characteristically of its supposed authorship,\nassociated with life upon this planet. That is the association for Plato and\nfor Virgil. Virgil thinks of re-incarnation ; that idea [the idea of re-incarnation\non this earth] is contradicted by Myers w.\n\flxiu.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 133\nread the translation in Mr. Myers's Essay on Virgil. But\nthe script goes on, after \" the Eiver of forgetfulness,\" \u2014which\nbeing an idea in general popular knowledge is useless for our\npurpose\u2014first of all, singularly enough, to contradict what\nwould appear to be the significance of the phrase, \" will again\nto live,\" and to say\n:\nNot reincarnation\nOnce only does the soul descend the way that leads to incarnation.\nThis I take merely as an assertion of the present opinion\nof Myersw on that subject\u2014thrown in gratuitously as it were\n\u2014not as a literary reference ;\nthough it does contain an\nexpression \" descend the way \" which recalls a line in a poem\nof F. W. H. Myers, To Tennyson:\n\"When from that world ere death and birth\nHe sought the long descending way.\"\nIf I may venture an interpretation of so mystical a matter,\nI apprehend the implication of the script, and of the poem just\nquoted, to be that the souls awaiting incarnation on Lethe shores\nmay be regarded as drinking it to forget previous existence amid\nother surroundings, or under other conditions, before descending\ninto earth life,\u2014thus teaching a doctrine of pre-existence indeed,\nbut not exactly re-incarnation,\n\u2014\ni.e. not necessarily or not\nat all the kind of pre-existence which Virgil suggests\u2014the\nkind most likely to occur to an ancient writer\u2014a previous\nexistence on this earth.\nThen the script goes on :\nThe blending of the Essence with the instrument\ntu Marcel! us Eris. . . .\nIn Valle Reducta\nAdd too the Doves and the Golden Boucfh amid the shadows.\nAdd too Go not to Lethe.\nAnd then, after the Omar Khayyam Door episode, which\nappears in rather smaller writing, as if interpolated in the\nmain message, it continues :\nThe shining souls shining by the river brim\nthe pain forgotten.\n\f134. Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nTo take this last sentence first\n:\n\" The pain forgotten \" clearly represents F. W. H. Myers's\npoetic translation in his Essay on Virgil, p. 174, already\nquoted :\n\" the ancient pain forgive Forget their life,\" etc.\n;\nand the only word not ohviously explicable in this sentence of\nthe script is the adjective \" shining.\" I take the word\n\" shining \" partly to mean that the assemblage is the brilliant\nposterity of iEneas, the triumphant leaders of future Rome.\nFor instance the one who is to be or who would be Marcelius,\nif the fates were propitious, is described by Virgil as \" ex-\ncellent in beauty and glittering in arms.\" But partly also\n\u2014and this is probably more to the purpose\u2014the epithet\n\" shining \" signifies that the whole group is depicted as purified\nby much tribulation, their guilt having been blown out of\nthem by hungry winds, or washed out in ocean depths, or\nburned out as by fire,\n\" till length of days completing time's circle takes out the clotted\nsoilure and leaves untainted the ethereal sense and pure spiritual\nflame.\"\u2014Mackail, JEneid, p. 141.\nOr, in the version of F.

W. H. Myers's verse translation has just been quoted\n(p. 134).\nThe Latin (Jfi. vi. 736 and 7) is : .\nSpiritus intus alit, totamque infusa per artus\nMens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.\nThese two lines are well known ; but on asking Mrs. Willett\nwhat knowledge of Virgil she possessed, she said her only\nacquaintance with him was Church's Story of the JEneid\u2014a book\nwhich happened to be in her house. But she has also read\nF. W. H. M.'s \" Essay on Virgil,\" and moreover is an ordinarily\neducated lady. She knows no Latin, however, and on referring\nto the book specified by her, which contains only an abbreviated\nversion, I find that this particular passage does not occur.\nAn extract will be given later from this book in order to\nshow that the further Virgilian references cannot have been\nthus obtained, subliminally or otherwise. (See Appendix A. to\nthis portion, p. 142.)\nIn Tennyson's great poem \" To Virgil \" this idea of the\nimmanence of an Anima mundi in creation is probably referred\nto by the lines\n:\n\" Thou that seest Universal Nature moved by Universal Mind \"\n;\nbut, however familiar these lines may appear to be to every\none, they cannot constitute a normal source of the reference\nto that subject in the form taken by the script ;\nmoreover,\n\f136 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nMrs. Willett informed me that she had not read the poem, though\nshe had seen the line quoted somewhere, \" Golden branch\namid the shadows.\" Months later, on 25th October, 1910, I\nread the poem to her.\nThe script goes on :\nTu Marcellus Eris.\nand breaks off to tell Mrs. Willett that she knows that line\n;\nwhich was true. The reason she knows it is because it had\nalready been quoted in Miss Verrall's script of dates between\nApril 29 and May 20, 1909, which had been given her to\nannotate 1\n\u2014a fact explained to me later by Mrs. Verrall.\nIt is not therefore the mere occurrence of these words, but\nthe occurrence of them in a Lethe connexion, that is important\n;\nfor there had been nothing previously to show any such con-\nnexion. But there is a connexion ;\nfor, in Virgil's Sixth Book,\niEneas was told that one and the most notable of the souls\nstanding by the river bank ready to be incarnated, would,\nwhen his time came, be Marcellus. This reference to Marcellus\nis reproduced in Church's \" Stories,\" but the word \" Lethe\n\"\ndoes not occur in them. The complete sentence \" Tu Marcellus\neris, Manihus date lilia plenis\" is quoted in Proc. Pt. 57,\np. 300, in connexion with the \" Thanatos\u2014mors\u2014death\" cross-\ncorrespondence ; and this Part of the Proceedings Mrs. Willett had\nread : but again there is no mention of Lethe there. The episode\nof the young Marcellus is referred to obscurely in the con-\nclusion of Myers's \" Essay on Virgil,\" and is associated with\nthe strewing of lilies\n:\n\"Give, give me lilies; thick the flowers be laid\nTo greet that mighty, melancholy shade \"\n;\nbut the name Marcellus is not there given. He is only spoken\nof as \"that last and most divinely glorified of the inhabitants\n1\nHer attention had indeed been specially called to it, because Mrs. Verrall\nhad sent to Mrs. Willett for experimental purposes on May 19, 1909, certain\nquestions, which she had also given to Miss Verrall, namely : (1) \"Please make\nclear the connexion between '\nTu Marcellus eris ' and '\nJam satis ' (beginning of\nan ode of Horace mentioned in contemporary H. V. script),\" and (2) \" Please\nexplain why the Golden Bough is mentioned ? \" There was no opportunity,\nhowever, for transmitting these questions to a Communicator, and accordingly\nno answer was obtained. For further details, see Mrs. Verrall's paper below,\npp. 180, 186.\n\fLxur.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Scriirt. 137\nof the under world\" {\/E. vi. 883), about whom it was pro-\nphesied that he should die prematurely. T am of opinion that\nthere was no normal association of Marcellus with Lethe in\nMrs. Willett's mind.\nThen her script goes on :\nWrite it nevertheless and add\nHenry Sidgwick's\nIn Valle Reducta.\nNow In Valle Reducta (in a sheltered vale) is the opening\nphrase of Virgil's description of the river of Lethe (JE. vi. 703).\nIt and its context are thus translated by Bryce (Bohn's Scries)\n:\n\" Meanwhile iEneas, in a winding vale, observes a lonely grove,\nand brakes that rustle in the woods, and the Lethean stream which\nskirts those peaceful homes. All around were flitting countless\ncrowds and troops of ghosts ; even as when, on a peaceful summer's\nday, bees in the meadows settle on the various flowers, and swarm\naround the snow-white lilies ; the whole plain buzzes with their\nhumming noise.\" 1\nI quote the whole passage now, though the reference in\nthe script to the bees and the lilies comes later. Note\nthat the sheltered or lonely vale through which Lethe runs\nis expressed in Virgil by the phrase \/\/\/ valle reducta ; and\nthese words in the script are called \" Henry Sidgwick's\n\"\nbecause Henry Sidgwick had been represented as communi-\ncating them, through what is called the \" Mac \" script, in July,\n1908. This, it is true, had been seen by Mrs. Willett, but it\ncontained no reference to Lethe, though the phrase in valle\nreducta is followed by the words \" ^Eneid 6,\" and preceded by\n\" yEneas.\" There is no mention of Marcellus in the Mac\nscript, and therefore at no time any reason for her connecting\nIn valle reducta with Marcellus or Lethe. There may have\nbeen (see foot-note on p. 136) an obscure reason in her mind\nfor connecting the Golden Bough with Marcellus, but none\n'The word \"winding,\" in the first line of this translation, hardly represents\nthe usual significance of the word reducta, \u2014which is \"withdrawn,\" rather than\n\"bent back\";\u2014the latter meaning is associated with redunca.\nSo also a better translation of the concluding words is\n\u2014\"all the plain is\nmurmurous with their humming.\"\n\f138 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nfor connecting \" the Golden Bough \" with In vallc rcducta.\n(See Mrs. Verrall's supplementary paper below.)\nThe fact, however, that both these Latin phrases, tit Maredlvs\neris and in voile reducta, had passed through her mind, seems\nto have made it possible for Myersvv to make her quote\nthese two passages in the original Latin\u2014a thing usually\ndifficult or impossible.\nIt is the combination and juxtaposition that, is notable, not\nthe occurrence of the phrases themselves.\nThe fact that Virgil compares the souls on the banks of the\nriver of Lethe to bees humming round lilies, taken in conjunc-\ntion with the phrase \" tu Marcellus eris,\" is of possible interest,\nsince the immediate context of \" tu Marcellus eris \" is \" Mani-\nbus date lilia plenis \"\u2014\" give lilies with full hands.\" Mr.\nPiddington considers that this double allusion to lilies in the\nscript, although only implicit, strengthens the conjecture in his\n(then unpublished) Lethe paper of a connexion in the mind of\nMyersp of lilies with Lethe (Proc. Vol. XXIV, p. 135).\nAs for \" the Doves and the Golden Bough amid the shadows,\"\n\u2014the Golden Bonsh is the branch which xEneas had to obtain\nbefore he could enter the infernal regions ; and the Doves are\nthe doves of his mother Venus, which, by fluttering about,\ndirected him to the spot in the woods round Avernus\u2014the\nentrance to the under-world\u2014near which grew the Golden Bough,\nwhich was to be the key whereby he was enabled to effect\nan entrance and so ultimately to arrive at the river of Lethe.\nIt is quite possible, and rather Myers-like, that this hunting\nabout for the mode of obtaining entrance suggested the form\nof the almost immediately succeeding Omar Khayyam reference,\nabout \" the door to which I found no key,\" and the open-\nsesame reference which immediately followed it, as recorded\non page 130. Besides, the door of Omar Khayyam also repre-\nsented an entrance into mysteries.\n1\nThis is the Virgilian description of \" the doves \" mentioned\nin script\n:\n\" They, feeding as they go, flew forward just so far that the eyes\nof those who follow keep them in view, and then, when they reached\n'There may have been another reason for the reference given, as I have\nsince learnt there was a \"door and key\" cross-correspondence, which is narrated\nby Mrs. Verrall below, pp. 193-204.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some Neiv Script. 139\nthe jaws of fell Avernus, they ascend in rapid flight, and floating\nthrough the air, they both sit down together on their chosen spot\nabove the bough, from which the golden hue, discordant with the\ntree, \"learned through the branches.\" \/T, ,\n\u201e . . .\n\u00b0 & (Bryces Translation.)\nAnd this is the Virgilian description of \" the golden bough\namid the shadows\" (also mentioned in the above Willett script):\n\" On a shaded tree there hangs a bough concealed from view,\ngolden in its leaves and pliant stem, held sacred to Juno of the\nnether world [i.e. Proserpine]. This the grove covers and the\nwinding glades shut out from view.\"\nBut this idea of the shaded or hidden bough is clearly\ngiven, and is given in almost the precise phrase of the script\n(though without mention of the doves) in Tennyson's poem\nTo Virgil, which had been referred to in one of Miss Verrall's\nscripts. This script, with a note attributing it to Tennyson, had\nbeen seen by Mrs. Willett ; who herself informed me of the\nfact, after her usual careful fashion. The line is :\n\" Golden\nbranch amid the shadows.\"\nThat this gorgeous poem of Tennyson's, full of Virgilian\nspirit and references, appealed strongly to F. W. H. Myers\u2014so\nstrongly that it would be natural to suppose that the recollec-\ntion of it would persist into another state of existence, if any-\nthing of earthly memory can persist\u2014is clear from several\npassages in his writings ; it is, in fact, quoted in his Essay on\nVirgil (p. 148), and is prefixed to that Essay as a motto; but\nI find it referred to in a specially appropriate manner in a\nletter or short memoir on Tennyson, which at the request of\nLord Tennyson he wrote in order that it might be appended\nto that Life of his father which Lord Tennyson was pre-\nparing. Thence I quote it :\n\u2014\n\" But most Virgilian of all are the two central lines\n:\n'\nLight among the vanish'd ages ; star that gildest yet this phantom\nshore ;\nGolden branch amid the shadows, kings and realms that pass to\nrise no more.'\nAy, this it is which lives for us out of the confused and perishing\nPast ! The gross world's illusion and the backward twilight are lit\nby that sacred ray.\n\f140 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nAnd how iioble a comparison is that of the elect poet himself to\nhis one golden bough in Avernus' forest, which gleamed amid the\nsea of green !\nTalis erat species auri frondentis opaca\nllice ; sic leni crepitabat bractea vento.\nWe are here among things that shall endure.\"\nChap. III. Lethe\u2014continued.\nNot yet, however, are we through the truly remarkable\npiece of script which came on Feb. 4, 1910. Immediately\nafter the line about \" the shining souls shining by the river\nbrim \" we get,\n\u2014\nThe pain forgotten but there is another meaning another more\nintimate link and connection that now I cannot give It does not\nescape me I see the bearing\nRose fluttering rose leaves blown like ghosts from an enchanter\nfleeing and Love Love the essential essence not spilt like water\non the ground far off forgotten pain.\n\" Forgotten pain \" may readily refer to Lethe ; and as for\n\" Love the essential essence not spilt like water on the ground\n\"\n\u2014the eternity of love, no matter what happens to the Physical\nUniverse, is the burden of The Renewal of Youth as well as\nof many another poem by F. W. H. Myers.\nFor instance in Classical Essays, p. 99 :\n\" Now from about thee, in thy new home above,\nHas perished all but life, and all but love.\"\nAlso in St. Paul\n:\n\"Love shall survive and love be undiminished\nLove be imperishable, love be young.\"\nBut it also suggests a phrase of In Memoriam. lxv. :\n\" Love's too precious to be lost\nA little grain shall not be spilt.\"\nThis section of In Memoriam immediately follows one which\nis closely connected with it in thought ; the earlier section\n\flxiil] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 141\nsuggests that we shall learn, at some time \"far-off,\" that no pain\nor desire is purposeless ; and it claims for the departed a\nsplendid outlook and copious vision as compared with their\npreviously cabined and restricted earthly estate. To a mind so\nrichly stored with subtle literary allusions and connexions as\nMyers's was, this contiguity or sequence may have had\nsignificance, and to it a sympathetic reader may be inclined to\nattribute the next line of the script, which occurs after a pause\n\u2014a pause perhaps for thought\n\u2014\nDarien the peak in Darien\nThe Peak Peak PEAK\n\" I have not done yet \"\n\u2014he continues.1\nNo indeed he had not done yet! For this idea of the\nvision as from a mountain top, comparing things past\npresent and to come, seems to have brought up in his mind\na multitude of instances in Literature where the condition of\nfuture existence was compared with that of earth\u2014sometimes\nto its advantage, sometimes to its disadvantage, and thus\nfilled him with reminiscences of passages in Virgil and Homer\nand Horace as well as in poems of his own ; with recollec-\ntions of Achilles and Anchises, of Ulysses and -.Eneas\u2014till,\nas we may fancifully imagine, the rush of ideas is too over-\nwhelming at that stage of the day's script, and he can only\nawait a further opportunity of disburdening himself of some\nfraction of his thoughts.\n'In Keats' Sonuet, On first lookhnj into Chapman's Homer \"a Peak in\nDarien\" was the summit whence Cortez and his followers viewed for the first\ntime the expanse of the Pacific. It was used symbolically of course to\nrepresent the outlook opened up to Keats' sympathetic e3T\nes by this translation\nof Homer.\n\" Then felt I like some watcher of the skies\nWhen a new planet swims into his ken ;\nOr like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes\nHe stared at the Pacific\u2014and all his men\nLook'd at each other with a wild surmise\n\u2014\nSilent, upon a peak in Darien.\"\nAnd the phrase was employed by Frances Power Cobbe, and occasionally\nadopted by the founders of the S.P.R., to signify cases when dying persons\nseemed to catch glimpses of another world. These cases, Mrs. Sidgwick tells\nme, rather specially interested Mr. Myers. (See Human Personality, Vol. II.\np. 31.)\n\f142 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nHence the short residue of the script of that first day consists\nof adjurations to me to let him know if I am able to under-\nstand what has come through, so far.\nI have not done yet.\nTo Lodge this may have meaning.\nLet him remember the occasion\n[i.e. the occasion appropriate to the peak of Darien, as I take it]\nI am not vague I am not vague\nI want an answer to the script from Lodge\nTell him I want an answer\nDoes he recognise my recognition\n(repeated)\nLet Lodge speak\nSpeak let him speak\nEnough for to-day\nLet Lodge speak\nI endeavoured to carry out these instructions so far as\nunderstanding the script goes, though slowly because of pressure\nof other work, and the process took time. As to informing\nMyersw, it seemed better not to give the automatic writer too\nmuch normal information at first, lest it should spoil future\nevidence ; still I have gradually conveyed the idea that much\nof what he had said was understood.\n[End of discussion of Script of Feb. 4-]\nAppendix A.\nMrs. Willctt's normal knoiolcdgc.\nSome notes were written by Mrs. Willett to show how\nmuch she recognised at the time as derived from her normal\ninformation on the subjects referred to in her script of Feb. 4th,\n1910. These notes were sent to me at the same time as the\nscript, which I received on Feb. 6 ;\nbut they only amount to\nthis\u2014that she had seen some of the Latin and other phrases\nin H. V. script and Mac script (where, in notes, the sources\nwere given, as will be more exactly reported by Mrs. Verrall).\nShe had seen the phrase \" Will again to live \" in one of Mr.\nMyer s'poems\n\u2014\" I think, but am not certain, from his Essay\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 143\non Virgil \" (she writes)\u2014and had seen the phrase \" Peak in\nDarien,\" without understanding it, while turning over the pages\nof Human Personality. And in a concluding note she says\n:\nI know nothing of Virgil except Church's \"Stones from Virgil,\"\nor some such name, a shilling book that happens to be in the\nhouse.\nI accept Mrs. Willett's statement made in her letter of\nFeb. 5 quoted on page 122, that the script as a whole \"suggests\nnothing much to me\u2014I only hope it may to you,\" and con-\nsequently that she was for all practical purposes ignorant of\nVirgil. Nevertheless the fact that an English abridgement of\nVirgil had been seen by her\u2014how casually we do not know\n\u2014\nrendered it necessary that this book should be examined to\nsee how far it could have supplied the apposite Virgilian\nquotations. Could it, for instance, have prompted the connexion\nof Manibus date lilia plenis (i.e. tu Marcellus cris) and in vallc\nreducta with each other and with Lethe ?\nIt seems to me that it could not, but I quote from it some\nrelevant passages\n:\nRelevant Extracts from the version of the JEneid luhich had\nbeen in Mrs. Willett's hands,\u2014namely, \" The Story of the\nJEneid,\" also ccdlcd \" Stories from Virgil,\" by the Rev. Alfred\nJ. Church, Professor of Latin in University College, Lonelon.\nChapter XIV. is called \"The Dwellings of the Dead.\" It\nopens with the visit of iEneas and the Sibyl to the Infernal\nEegions, in order to visit the Shade of his Father. After\nthey have seen many things, and asked the way of Museeus,\nthe story goes on to relate the meeting\n:\nThen they beheld Anchises where he sat in a green valley, re-\ngarding the spirits of those who should be born in aftertime of\nhis race. And when he beheld iEneas coming, he stretched out\nhis hands and cried, \" Comest thou, my son ? Hast thou won thy\nway hither to me? Even so I thought that it would be, and lo !\nmy hope hath not failed me.\"\nAnd ^Eneas made answer, \" Yea, I have come a long way to see\nthee, even as thy spirit bade me. And now let me embrace thee\nwith my arms.\"\nBut when he would have embraced him it was as if he clasped\nthe air.\n\f144 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nThen JEneas looked and beheld a river, and a great company\nof souls thereby, thick as the bees on a calm summer day in a\ngarden of lilies. And when he would know the meaning of the\nconcourse, Anchises said, \"These are souls which have yet to live\nagain in a mortal body, and they are constrained to drink of the\nwater of forgetfulness.\" And ^Eneas said, \"Nay, my father, can any\ndesire to take again upon them the body of death 1 \" Then Anchises\nmade reply :\n\" Listen, my son, and I will tell thee all. There is\none soul in heaven and earth and the stars and the shining orb\nof the moon and the great sun himself ; from which soul also\ncometh the life of man and of beast, and of the birds of the air,\nand of the fishes of the sea. And this soul is a divine nature,\nbut the mortal body maketh it slow and dull. Hence come fear\nand desire, and grief and joy, so that, being as it were shut in a\nprison, the spirit beholdeth not any more the light that is without.\nAnd when the mortal life is ended, yet are not men quit of all\nthe evils of the body, seeing that these must needs be put away\nin many marvellous ways. For some are hung up to the winds,\nand with some their wickedness is washed out by water, or burnt\nout with fire. But a ghostly pain we all endure. Then we that\nare found worthy are sent into Elysium and the plains of the blest.\nAnd when, after many days, the soul is wholly pure, it is called\nto the river of forgetfulness, that it may drink thereof, and so return\nto the world that is above.\"\n[Thereupon iEneas and the Sibyl were led to a hill whence\nthey could see the whole company, and Anchises pointed out\na considerable number of souls who were destined to be\nfamous descendants,\u2014mentioning them by name, and fore-\nshadowing the glory of Koine.]\nThen [Anchises] spake again: \"Regard him who is the first of\nall the company of conquerors. He is Marcellus ; he shall save the\nstate in the day of trouble, and put to flight Carthaginian and Gaul.\"\nThen said JEneas, for he chanced to see by his side a youth clad\nin shining armour, and very fair to look upon, but sad, and with\ndowncast eyes, \"Tell me, father, who is this? How noble is he!\nWhat a company is about him ! But there is a shadow of darkness\nround his head.\"\nAnd Anchises made answer: \"0 my son, seek not to know the\ngreatest sorrow that shall befall thy children after thee. This youth\n\fLXin.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 145\nthe Fates shall only show for a brief space to man. . . . Alas ! for\nhis righteousness, and truth, and valour unsurpassed ! 0 luckless boy,\nif thou canst haply break thy evil doom thou shalt be a Marcellus.\nGive handfuls of lilies. I will scatter the bright flowers and pay\nthe idle honours to my grandson's shade.\"\nTims did Anchises show his son things to be, and kindled his\nsoul with desire of glory.\nIt appears to me that this material, even if read by Mrs.\nWillett\u2014and she has no conscious recollection of having read\nit\u2014would fail to furnish her with the Virgilian quotations and\nreferences which her hand produced in response to the simple\nstimulus of \"Lethe\"\u2014a word singularly enough not mentioned\nby Church in this book.\nThe episode of the Golden Bough is related however. It\ncomes in a previous chapter, about 8 pages before the extracts\nreproduced above, and I will quote this too\n:\nThen the Sibyl spake, saying, \" Son of Anchises, it is easy to go\ndown to hell. The door is open day and night. But to return,\nand struggle to the upper air, that is the labour. Few only\nhave done it, and these of the lineage of the Gods and dear to\nJupiter. Yet if thou wilt attempt it, hearken unto me. There\nlieth hid in the forest a bough of gold which is sacred to the\nQueen of hell. Nor may any man go on this journey till he\nhave plucked it, for the Queen will have it as a gift for herself.\nAnd when the bough is plucked, there ever groweth another ;\nand if it be the pleasure of the Gods that thou go, it will yield\nto thine hand. But know that one of thy companions lieth\ndead upon the shore. First must thou bury him, and after\noffer due sacrifice, even black sheep. So shalt thou approach\nthe dwelling of the dead.\"\n[Nine lines omitted] ....\nBut when .\/Eneas beheld the forest, how vast it was, he said\n\" Now may the Gods grant that in this great forest the bough\nof gold discover itself.\" And as he spake, lo ! two doves flew\nbefore his face, and settled on the grass, and he knew them\nto be the birds of his mother, and cried, saying, \" Guide me\nnow to the bough of gold, and thou, my mother, help me as\nbefore.\" Then the birds flew so that he could still see them\nwith his eyes, and he followed after them. '\nBut when they\n\f146 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ncame to the mouth of Avernus, they sat both of them on the\ntree. And lo ! the bough of gold glittered among the\nbranches and rustled in the wind. Right gladly did iEneas\nbreak it off, and carry it to the dwelling of the Sibyl.\nAppendix B.\n0. J. Z.'s normal knowledge.\nOn February 6th, 1910, the day I received the important\nscript of Feb. 4 hitherto commented on, I was very busy, but\nI sent three hasty replies to it at different periods of the\nday. These replies had better be reproduced, as showing\n(1) how little information could at that time have been\nextracted from my mind,\n(2) how much, or little, information was imparted to Mrs.\nWillett when she read them.\nThey were in three sealed envelopes, and she opened and\nread them to Myersw on Feb. 10, as is reported later.\n(No. 1) Well Myers, but I want more from you about Lethe\nand its suggestions than that. It must awaken literary and\nclassical reminiscences in your mind. What you have said\nso far seems naturally sophisticated a little with what your\nScribe has been reading. 1\nBut, while you have been thinking,\nperhaps more has occurred to you. I had better say no more\nat present.\n(No. 2) The phrase \" peak in Darien \" occurs in your book\u2014\n1\nremembered it dimly and have looked it up. Miss Cobbe\ncollected some cases of clairvoyance of the dying, wherein,\nshortly before death, they showed themselves aware of some-\none in the spirit who had only recently died, and of whose\ndeath they had no normal means of knowing. She seems to\nhave published this little collection of cases under the title\n1\nThis quite unnecessary and erroneous suspicion had reference to a paper\nwhich I had sent to Mrs. Willett in January\u2014a chapter on Incarnation out\nof my book '.'\nReason and Belief.\" It will be seen below (p. 170) that I am\nrebuked by Myersw for having sent it, and also for imagining a possible con-\nnexion between it and what was recorded on Feb. 4.

S.P.E., Vol. V.,\np. 459. Paper by Gurney completed by Myers.)\n(No. 3) \"A Peak in Darien\" is reminiscent of Keats. Perhaps\nthat is what you wanted me to perceive. But do not be\nafraid of my literary ignorance, which is great ; because I\nhave means of ferreting out any literary allusions if they are\nknown to man. So don't think of me or of what I shall\nunderstand, but let your own thoughts luxuriate, and trust\nto their being understood\u2014though perhaps not immediately.\n0. J. L.\nI will not add any comment to emphasise the ludicrous\ninsufficiency of these hasty and immediately contemporary\nreplies. It must be disappointing to any Intelligence, who\nhas sent answers so excellent, to have them received with\nignorance\u2014however completely that ignorance subsequently\ndisappears ; but the communicating intelligences, whatever they\nare, are patient, and the response on Feb. 10 was as worthy\nas that of Feb. 4.\nPART II.\nConcerning the Script of 10 February, 1910.\nChap. IV. Evidence of supernormal access to knowledge.\nWe now pass on to consider more particularly the matter written\nby Mrs. Willett's hand on Feb. 10, 1910. And in the first\ninstance it may be convenient to quote the whole of it, as it\nstands, just as I did with that of Feb. 4, on p. 123.\nI am assured that Mrs. Willett did not show my question to\nanyone after opening the envelope on Feb. 4, and made no\nenquiries on the subject of Lethe, or on any other classical\nsubject, between Feb. 4 and Feb. 1 0 ; which was the next\navailable occasion for the production of ordinary script\u2014ordinary,\nI mean, as distinguished from the interjected and exceptional\nwriting of Feb. 5 ; and what came on Feb. 10 was definitely\nregarded by Mrs. Willett as a continuation of the communi-\ncation of Feb. 4.\n\f148 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nHere then is the Script of Feb. 1 0 ; but I must explain once\nmore that the frequent interjection of the name of the ostensible\ncommunicator is a peculiar feature of these scripts, and that\nin reading it these mechanical or auxiliary interruptions or\npunctuations can be omitted.\nComplete Copy of Willctt Script of Feb. 10, 1910.\nMyers yes I am ready I know\nwhat Lodge wants he wants me\nto prove that I have access to\nknowledge shown elsewhere\nMyers give me his 3 answers\nall all together\n(The answers, printed on p. 146, were here opened and read.)\nMyers there is an Ode I want\nan Ode Horatian\nLydia I referred to the\nOde elsewhere\nWrite write the word\nSeneca\nAgain Filial piety that was\nthe motive that led him\nthe son to the Father\nVirgil\nBut Ulyss there is a\nparalel Ulysses\nthis is confused in Myers\nconfused in the script but not\nin my mind.

Only in that way is an understanding to be secured.\nAnd in ordinary cases a test of success in interpretation is\nfurnished by the subsequent approval or acceptance of the\nspeaker ; indications furnished in the course of conversation\ngive a listener his clue and make him aware whether he is\npursuing the right train of thought or not. This sort of clue\nis necessarily absent in the case of script, unless it is obtained\nsubsequently, so that special effort is needful when endeavouring\nto interpret the meaning which underlies the more or less\nfragmentary utterances obtained through the various channels\nof a cross-correspondence.\nIt is manifest, however, that in so far as any correspondences\ndetected relate to scripts which have been printed and published,\nsome difficulty arises, and stringency of criticism becomes\nnecessary ;\nespecially if any of the writings of the past have\nbeen seen by the automatist who is producing fresh material.\nIn that case the evidence of knowledge shown must be severely\ncriticised, and everything that can be supposed stored in either\nthe conscious or the sub-conscious mind of the automatist must\nbe reasonably and frankly allowed for, in drawing conclusions.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 151\nAll this being understood and premised, we will go through\nthe above script in detail.\nChap. V. Comparison of States.\nAnd first we may remember that when trying to enter\nsympathetically into the soul of the communicator, as he\nbrought his script of Feb. 4, 1910, to a necessary provisional\nend, with the ejaculation \" I have not done yet,\" we made a\nguess or fanciful suggestion\u2014as printed on p. 141 \u2014that, arising\nout of this idea of the vision of one world from another, there\nflowed into the mind of Myersw such a multitude of ideas\nthat the script had to cease for a time ;\nsince a rush of this\nkind\u2014at least in my own experience\u2014usually has an inhibi-\ntory effect for a few moments. But the ideas themselves\nbegin to emerge on the next opportunity afforded him for\nthe customary kind of script\u2014namely, on Feb. 10, 1910.\nWhen Mrs. Willett sat clown to write, the first words that\ncame were these :\n\u2014\nMyers yes I am ready I know what Lodge WANTS he wants\nme to prove that I have access to knowledge shown elsewhere Myers\ngive me his 3 answers all all together.\nMyersw opens by saying that 0. J. L. wants to prove that\nhe (Myers) has access to knowledge shown elsewhere. (\" Else-\nwhere \" may be understood to mean through Mrs. Piper during\nMr. Dorr's sittings, chiefly, though not necessarily exclusively.)\nThis quite correct statement is the clue to what follows.\nSo Mrs. Willett opened the three envelopes sent by 0. J. L.\nin answer to the Script of Feb. 4, 1910, and read them in\norder. Their contents are printed above (p. 141), but they are\nunimportant.\nThen the script began again\n:\nMyers there is an Ode I want an Ode Horatian\nLydia I referred to the Ode elsewhere\nA question sent by Mrs. Verrall to Myersw through Mrs.\nWillett, which is quoted in a foot-note to p. 136, above, must\nbe assumed to have directed Mrs. Willett's attention to the\n\f152 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nOde of Horace, I. 2, beginning Jam satis. Neither this Ode how-\never, nor I. 28, mentions \" Lydia.\" The subject of the Archytas\nOde, I. 28, had appeared through other automatists and had\nbeen already dealt with at considerable length by Mr. Piddington\nin Proc. S.P.E., Vol. XXII., which Mrs. Willett had seen. But\nmore was written (see Proc. Vol. XXIV., pp. 150 ff.) than\nhad yet been published ; and the above seems to allude to\nthe subject matter of this subsequently published portion,\nbecause the script continues :\nWrite write the word Seneca\nAgain Filial piety that was the motive that led him\nthe son to the Father\nVirgil\nNow it was precisely filial piety\u2014a desire to communicate\nwith his dead father Anchises\u2014that led iEneas to visit the\nUnderworld. The name \" Seneca,' as Mrs. Verrall suggests,\nis possibly introduced in the script during an effort to\nexpress the idea of filial piety\u2014Seneca having written De con-\nstantia, ad Helviarn matrem, a discourse addressed to his own\nmother on his father's death. It seems most unlikely that\nMrs. Willett has any such association with Seneca.\nThe script continues, after the word \" Virgil \" written in\nconnexion with the visit of iEneas to the Under-world,\n\u2014\nBut Ulyss there is a paralel Ulysses. This is confused in\nMyers confused in the Script but not in my mind. The\nconfusion is not in my thought but in the expression of it as\nit reaches you Lodge.\nHere then a parallel is indicated between iEneas and\nUlysses, in connexion presumably with the Lethe episode.\nAnd I find that on page 172 of F. W. H. Myers's Essay on\nVirgil, a parallel of this kind is distinctly elaborated. When\n.\/Eneas sees the souls on the banks of the river of Lethe\nwaiting for \" re-incarnation,\" he is astonished that anyone\nshould want to live again on earth,\n\"And the form of the question which he asks (A. vi. 719) is in\nitself highly significant. Compared, for example, with the\nfamous contrast which the Homeric Achilles draws between\neven the poorest life on happy earth and the forlorn kingship\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 153\nof the shades, it indicates that a change has taken place which\nof all speculative changes is perhaps the most important, that\nthe ideal has heen shifted from the visible to the invisible,\nfrom the material to the spiritual world\n\u2014\n\" 0 father, must I deem that souls can pray\nHence to turn backward to the worldly day?\nChange for that weight of flesh these forms more fair,\nFor that sun's sheen this paradisal air?\"\nExtract from F. W. H. M.'s Essay.\nThe corresponding Homeric incident, presumably alluded to\nin the script, occurred during the visit of Ulysses to the Shades\nwhen he meets with Achilles, who\u2014in the famous saying\nwherein occur the words eirdpovpos or adscriptns glebce (cf.\nProc. Vol. XXII., p. 400)\u2014maintains that it is better to be\na slave among the living than a king among the dead ; thus\ntaking a very different view of the relative advantages of the\ntwo states from that taken by iEneas.\nThe fact that F. W. H. Myers had himself drawn the parallel,\nwhich is indeed obvious, between the two visits, and, what is\nless obvious, had contrasted the two mental attitudes\u2014that of\niEneas as described by Virgil and that of Achilles as described\nby Homer,\u2014makes it clear, I think, on any hypothesis as to\nsource, that this same parallel is the one referred to in the\nscript.\nAnd this explanation is clinched by the occurrence a little\nlater on in the script\u2014as soon as the thought of the com-\nmunicator had again become clear, we may suppose\u2014of the\nwords,\nBetter to Rule among no to\nslave among the living\n[than] King it mid the Dead.\nThis phrase makes clear which Horatian Ode was in the\ncommunicator's mind during the production of the first four words\nof this script.\nI may as well quote Mrs. Verrall's remarks on the passage\nabout Virgil and Ulysses already commented on\n:\nThe point here is the appropriateness of those reminiscences.\nMyers's Essay on Virgil (p. 172) connects Lethe and the Homeric\n\f154 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nAchilles, and a classical scholar remembers that ^Eneas' visit to\nAnchises is reminiscent of the Homeric story of Odysseus (Ulysses)\nand the Underworld. Hence it is natural to say that \" there is a\nparallel\" after mentioning Virgil and Ulysses, \u2014natural I mean to\nMyersw, but not, I think, to Mrs. Willett. 1\n[For further comment\non these allusions to Homer see Mrs. Verrall's paper below, p. 188.]\nAnd now that the notion of comparing ideas of different\nages and different writers, concerning the condition of humanity\nin earthly existence as contrasted with the condition in a\nfuture state,\u2014now that this idea has occurred to Myersw, it is\npursued into further developments ;\nfor, after a reference to\nShelley, Tennyson, and Keats, the script concludes :\nMyers Homer and Horace the thought allied\nbut I cannot get it clear\nWatts Watts\nReaders of Mr. Piddington's recent papers will remember\nhis notable discovery of the deep-seated correspondence between\nHorace Ode i. 28 and F.

Myers's published poem called\n\" Immortality.\" The circumstances which gave rise to the\nidentification or alliance should be looked up in the then already\npublished Proceedings, Vol. XXII., pp. 397-401, and in the\n(at that time\u2014February, 1910) unpublished Proceedings, Vol.\nXXIV., pp. 150-169, which for the first time\u2014explicitly at\n1\nThe name of Ulysses is not mentioned in the Essay on Virgil (above\nquoted), and must therefore have come into the script from some other\nsource. Mrs. Willett's note on her recollections of the Essay on Virgil shows\nsome confusion in her mind between ^Eneas and Ulysses, but no knowledge of\nany parallel between them. Thus, whereas in her first letter of February 5,\n1910, accompanying the script, she wrote :\n\"'Will again to live.' I recognise this as a quotation from one of Mr.\nMyers's poems\u2014\/ think, but am not certain, from his Essay on Virgil ;\n\"\na month or two later, on June 17, 1910, in answer to a request from O.J.L. to\nwrite down the \" connexion or context or significance of the phrase (the will\nagain to live), without looking it up specially,\" she wrote as follows:\n\"I am vague as to what the piece of poetry is in which the words occur.\nIt must, I suppose, be a translation from Virgil. My impression is that it is\nsaid by a Father to a Son (either Ulysses or Aeneas\u2014I never can remember\nwhich belongs to Homer and which to Virgil) who went down to Hell to see\nbis Father.\"\nIt is possible that some such confusion in the automatist's mind prevented\nthe completion of the intended parallel. All such confusion must in fairness\nbe attributed to her, for it is carefully disclaimed by Myersw.\n\flxiil] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 155\nleast\u2014introduces Homer as a third member of the alliance.\n1\nSuffice it here to say that Horace in that \" Archytas \" ode\ntakes a pessimistic view of death, regarding with gloom the\nfuture destiny of men whose earthly career had been brilliant,\n\u2014thus suggesting something not altogether unlike the feeling\nexpressed by the Homeric shade of Achilles.\nThe fact that the thought expressed in the words quoted\nfrom Homer is allied to the \" Archytas \" ode of Horace, is\nnot at all familiar ; and though something is explained in\nthe published Vol. XXII. (p. 397 et seq.) which Mrs. Willett\nhad read, it is unlikely that she had grasped the idea\n;\nmoreover, the word \" Watts \" in her script seems to show\nknowledge of the unpublished Proc. Vol. XXIV, p. 187. For\nthe allusion to \" Watts \" is presumably a reference to G. F.\nWatts's picture of Orpheus and Hurydice,\u2014a legend full of the\nendeavour, though of fruitless and pathetic endeavour, to exchange\none state for another. There is reason to think that this picture\nhad been already referred to by MyersP in his answers con-\ncerning Lethe to Mr. Dorr through Mrs. Piper (Proc. Vol. XXIV.,\npp. 130, 132), and it was closely associated with the 0 vidian\nanswer then given to the Lethe question ; and this picture has\nalso possibly been referred to in Miss Helen Verrall's script,\nsee Proc. Vol. XXIV., p. 187. It was one of the pictures\nspecially selected for notice in F. W. H. Myers's poem \" On\nMr. Watts' Collected Works,\" in the stanza:\n\" For here the Thracian, vainly wise,\nClose on the light his love has led,-\n\u2014\nOh hearken ! her melodious cries\nFade in the mutter of the dead :\n\u2014\n'\nFarewell ! f rom thy embrace I pass,\nDrawn to the formless dark alone :\nI stretch my hands,\u2014too weak, alas\n!\nAnd I no more, no more thine own.'\n\"\n(Fragments, p. 191.)\nIn fact, taking the whole into account, it seems certain that\nknowledge is shown of the references to the Horace Ode in\nDorr's sittings described by Mr. Piddington in his then\nunpublished paper, (now published in Vol. XXIV.) ; and the\n1\nSee Mrs. Verrall's paper below, p. 189.\n\f156 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nscript may in a sense be regarded as confirmatory of\nMr. Piddington's interpretation of those references. Further-\nmore, it now appears that a contribution is made in this\nscript, through the \" Waters of Babylon \" and \" Watts,\" to the\ncross-correspondence on \"Exile\"; as explained in Mrs. Verrall's\npaper below, p. 209.\nThe script of Feb. 10, 1910, seems to imply that corre-\nsponding ideas concerning the relationship between present and\nfuture existence, and the relative value and dignity of the two\nstates, are to be found in Shelley, Keats, and Tennyson ;\n\u2014\na\nhint which is conveyed by the sentences or quotations introduced\nin the middle of those references to comparison of states,\n\u2014\nSleep the dream that flits by night\nSleep and his twin brother\nHis name was writ in water.\nThe first of these sentences suggests Shelley's Queen Mab ;\nthe second Tennyson, as well as Shelley ; and the third Keats.\nTo display the meaning possibly intended, the following\nverses may be quoted\n:\nFrom Adcmais, \u2014\n\" He hath awakened from the dream of life\nTis we who, lost in stormy visions, keep\nWith phantoms an unprofitable strife.\"\n\" He has outsoared the shadow of our night.\"\n\" What Adonais is why fear we to become ?\"\n\" The soul of Adonais, like a star,\nBeacons from the abode where the Eternal are.\"\nThe whole poem expresses anything but enthusiasm for the\nconditions of terrestrial existence.\nBut indeed it is difficult to say anything more sympathetic\nas regards Shelley from this point of view than what F. W. H.\nMyers says in \"Human Personality,\" Vol. I., p. 97, about the\nlarval indications of wings found in the grub which fore-\nshadow the butterfly.\nThe third poet referred to, Keats, often emphasised the gain\nto be expected on transition from worldly existence, though no\ndoubt he regarded its possibilities differently in different moods.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 157\nAs for the second poet,\u2014such a quotation as \" Death and\nhis brother\" would have been interpreted as Shelley, but\n\" Sleep and his twin brother \" suggests Tennyson. So I quote\nsome portions thus possibly recalled,\nFrom In Memoriarn \u2014\nlxxi. \" Sleep, kinsman thou to death and trance\n\"\nlxviii. \"When in the down I sink my head,\nSleep, Death's twin-brother, times my breath ;\nSleep, Death's twin-brother, knows not Death,\nNor can I dream of thee as dead.\"\nIt is perhaps worth noting that \" Sleep, Death's kinsman,\"\noccurs in JEncicl vi. 278, consanguineus Leti Sopor; so that\nthis is what may have suggested the reference. I may quote\nalso from sections of In Memoriarn comparing the two\nstates ;\nsince, as is fairly plain from the context, it is for that\nreason chiefly that the references are introduced into the\nscript. The passages preceding and following the references to\nDeath and Sleep in the script are preceded by \" Better to\nslave among the living than King it mid the dead,\" and\nfollowed by \" Homer and Horace the thought allied.\"\nThe following lines occur in preceding sections of In\nMemoriarn\n:\nlxi. \"If, in thy second state sublime.\" . . .\nlxiv. \" Dost thou look back on what hath been,\nAs some divinely gifted man,\nWhose life in low estate began,\nAnd on a simple village green.\"\nOn these sections Professor A. C. Bradley (p. 157 of his\n\" Commentary \") comments thus :\n\u2014\n\" The poet's friend is almost throughout imagined as he is in\nthat '\nsecond state sublime ' which the poet conceives to be far\nsuperior to the earthly state in which he himself remains. Tennyson\nhimself had to point this out in connection with xcvii.\"\nA man so keenly interested as F. W. H. Myers was in\nproblems connected with a possible future state would assuredly\n\f158 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nhave been impressed by these sections, and might well have\nassociated them with utterances of Homer and Virgil and\nHorace, such as have now been quoted, as well as with\npassages in his own poems.\nChap. VI. Lethe and Knowledge of other Scripts.\nBut we have been led on to the end of this script of\nFeb. 10, 1910, without having nearly exhausted its earlier\npart.\nLet us, therefore, return to a plainly Lethean reference,\nwritten at an earlier stage, immediately after the reference to\nVirgil and Ulysses\n:\nThe Nightingale but but (scribbles) no no (scribbles)\nMyers begin again\nthe Nigh in Nightingale but Shelley too Myers as well\nOnce more ye Laurels Myers this seems\nincoherent but don't be discouraged\nFurther on, as we have already seen, the script makes a\nvery plain reference to Keats, by the phrase,\nHis name was writ in water\n\u2014itself a simple and easy Lethean reference to any man of\nletters, or, for that matter, to Mrs. Willett.\nSo there is no doubt that it is Keats' poem, Ode to a\nNightingale, that is here referred to by the word \" Nightin-\ngale.\" It is evident, also, that the reference constitutes a good\nanswer to the question, \" What does Lethe suggest to you,\"\nfor its first verse begins thus\n:\n\"My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains\nMy sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,\nOr emptied some dull opiate to the drains\nOne minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk.\"\nSo that reference is quite clear. And it may be the occur-\nrence here of the word \" hemlock,\" which suggests an ampli-\nfication of this word in the next important script which\narrived about a month later. (See Chap. VII. below.)\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 150\nBut then, after mentioning \" nightingale,' the script goes\non :\nbut Shelley too as well\nOnce more ye Laurels\nThis seems incoherent but don't be discouraged.\nNow it is true that the word \" nightingale \" occurs in several\nof Shelley's poems\u2014in Rosalind and Helen, for instance, and also\nin one specially called The Woodman and the Nightingale ;\nbut\nneither of these corresponds either to Lethe or to knowledge\nshown elsewhere ; so the object of, as it were, bracketing Shelley\nwith Keats in this connexion was not apparent.\nThe key is found in the next sentence of the script\n:\nDorrs scheme excellent Myers that I\nhave to use different scribes means that I must\nshow different aspects of thought\nunderlying which Unity is to be found.\nPrompted by this hint, Mrs. Verrall made a note in May\n1910,1\nas follows:\nThe \" nightingale \" I took to refer to Keats' poem which gives\nthe word \" Lethewards.\" But \"Shelley too\" puzzled me, as I\ncould not think what reference by Shelley to a nightingale was\nimportant in this connexion. The next words \"Once more ye\nlaurels\" gave me the clue, \u2014thus: \"Once more\" etc. is a quotation\nfrom Milton's Lycidas which is a prototype of Shelley's Adonais.\nThat sent me to Adonais, stanza xvii.,\n\" Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale,\nMourns not her mate with such melodious pain,\"\nwhich is a covert allusion to Keats' poem. Note that stanza xv.\nrefers to \"Echo,\" and stanza xvi. to \"Hyacinth\" and \"Narcissus.\"\nThese subjects had been referred to by MyersP in connexion with\nLethe, as described in Mr. Piddington's (then unpublished) paper\nin Proc. Vol. XXIV. ; this coincidence can hardly be accidental, but\nseems to justify the claim of Myersw to \"show different aspects of\nthought \" by the use of \" different scribes.\" Here we have another\ngroup of references to the Ovid stories, closely followed by the\nword \"Ganymede\" [see below]. I believe the omission of the\nname Ovid by Myersw to be intentional.\n1\nSee also Mrs. Verrall's paper, p. 209.\n\f160 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nMr. Piddington agrees with the suggestions contained in this\ningenious piece of literary criticism. It will be observed that\nthe above quotation from Adonais effectually welds together\nShelley, Keats, and Nightingale. (See also a discussion of the\npart played by Mrs. Willett in the cross-correspondence \" Echo\n\"\nand \"Nightingale\" in Miss Johnson's paper below, p. 244.)\nThe script having finished the sentence about showing\ndifferent aspects of a single thought through different scribes\n(meaning thereby different automatists) goes on :\nStrew on her Roses Roses\nGanymede\nMrs Verrall might make something of that\nhomeless in the heart of Paradise.\nWhere was the Sybil 1\nFlavicomata\nI have not finished, wait,\nthe draught of forgetfulness.\n\" Strew on her roses \" is a quotation from Matthew Arnold's\nwell-known poem Reqidescat, familiar to Mrs. Willett; it describes\nthe passing of the spirit from the confinement of life to the\n\" vasty halls of Death.\"\nTt is not apparent to a reader why the name Ganymede\noccurs, but it appears to have a cross-correspondence significance,\nand the following suggestions may be made :\n\u2014The story of\nGanymede is told in Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book X, immediately\nbefore that of Hyacinthus, which had been introduced by MyersP\nin connexion with the Lethe question put by Mr. Dorr.\nAgain in the first book of the JEneid (1. 28) the name of\nGanymede occurs in connexion with the wrath of Juno, a\nsubject discussed at considerable length in Mr. Dorr's sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper ; and one of Mr. Dorr's questions (Proc. Vol.\nXXIV., p. 175) concerned the immediately preceding line (1.\n27). The next words of the script, \"Mrs. Verrall might make\nsomething of that,\" i.e. of the name of Ganymede, are therefore\nappropriately spoken by anyone who knew that the story of\nGanymede is alluded to in xEncid I. and that Mrs. Verrall had\nwritten a paper dealing largely with the knowledge of that\nbook shown by MyersP. Neither of these facts was known to\nMrs. Willett.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 161\nThe phrase, \" Homeless in the heart of Paradise,\" is a quotation\nfrom Myers's poem called \" Immortality \" (see Proc. Vol. XXII.,\np. 399) connected by Mr. Piddington with Horace's Archytas\nOde (I. 28). Taken in connexion with the opening words in this\nscript, it points to an intention, underlying the whole script of\nFeb. 10, to refer to that particular ode of Horace.\n\"Where was the Sibyl?\" seems a reminiscence of Mr. Dorr's\nquestion, \"Where did the Sibyl live?\" {Proc. Vol. XXIV,\np. 144 ff.)\nAs to the word \" flavicomata \" I condense notes received from\nMr. Piddington and Mrs. A^errall.\nFlavicomata means yellow-haired. The word is not extant,\nbut is correctly formed. With this word, Mrs. Willett had the\nfollowing association,\u2014she had seen it in a script of Mrs.\nVerrall's, where on Jan. 16, 1908, it was written (incorrectly)\nin two portions, \" tiavi comata \" and applied to a tree, probably\na laburnum, thus\n:\n\"What is the foreign name of the tree\u2014something su^'ests its\nyellow hair\u2014flavi comata (yellow haired).\"\nThe application of the epithet flavicomata to a tree undoubtedly\nrecalls to a Virgilian scholar the auricomos fetus, \" gold-haired\nbranches,\" of the tree which iEneas was to seek in the woods\nround Avernus, where the Sibyl lived {JEn, VI. 141). But Mrs.\nWillett is no Virgilian scholar, and it is difficult to discover\nany reason in her literary memories for the transition from the\nSibyl's dwelling place to the word flavicomata. Moreover, as\nMr. Piddington points out, there may well have been another\nreason for the introduction at this point of the word flavi-\ncomata into Mrs. Willett's script. As already stated, it had\noccurred in a script of Mrs. Verrall's, seen by Mrs. Willett,\nBut a word almost equivalent in meaning, and of the same\ngrammatical formation, had occurred in another script of Mrs.\nVerrall's, which Mrs. Willett had not seen, but which, written\non September 9, 1903, is printed in full in Proc. Vol. XX.,\npp. 427-428. I here quote only such parts of it as are\nrelevant to our immediate purpose :\nAuricomata goldhaired, Camilla's yellow hair\nreminds.\nflava eomam\n\u2014\nL\n\f162 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nnexit in hastam\nOritella\nCoronata\nAriadne's crown in the sky.\nC comes Ononis.\nAuricomata\u2014like flavicomata, a non-existent but correctly\nformed word\u2014means \"golden-haired,\" and is exactly equivalent\nto the auricomos of Am. VI. 141.\nFlava comam means \" yellow as to the hair \" and is equiva-\nlent to flavicomata.\nComes Orionis means \" companion of Orion \" and is a quota-\ntion from Horace, C. I. 28, the \" Archytas \" Ode.\nIf Mrs. Willett's flavicomata he regarded as referring back\nto Mrs. Verrall's script of September 9, 1903, with its \"auri-\ncomata\n\"\u2014\"flava comam \"\n\u2014and \" comes Orionis\" it supplies yet\nanother proof of the communicators having \" access to know-\nledge shown elsewhere \" ; for in Mr. Dorr's sittings with Mrs.\nPiper, MyeiSp had spontaneously shown that he knew that\nOrion is associated with the Ode which was the subject of\nthe \"Horace Ode question\" (see Proc. Vol. XXIV, pp. 150-\n169 and especially pp. 157-158). Flavicomata thus killed\nthree birds with one stone. Implicit in it were allusions to\nthe Golden Bough, the Sibyl, and Horace, C. I. 28. For\neconomy and neatness of method, this pregnant use of a\nsingle word could hardly be surpassed.\nBut indeed it is indisputable that many words in the\nWillett script now under consideration allude to episodes in\nMr. Dorr's sittings which are discussed by Mr. Piddington and\nMrs. Verrall in the then unpublished volume of Proceedings\n(Part LX.). Thus, Ganymede recalls questions in Dorr's sit-\ntings about the context of passages from the jEncid (see\nProc. Vol. XXIV, pp. 69-73); \"homeless\" etc. recalls the\nHorace-ode question (see Proc. Vol. XXII., p. 399) which\nwas the subject of spontaneous reference by MyersP in Dorr's\nsittings (see Proc. Vol. XXIV., p. 153); \"where was the\nSybil \" recalls Dorr's question at those sittings (see Proc. Vol.\nXXIV., p. 144); \"the draught of forge tfuln ess \" alludes to\nthe Lethe question (see Proc. Vol. XXIV., p. 91).\nThe last three references represent the three subjects, and\nthe only three subjects from Mr. Dorr's sittings, which are\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 163\ndealt with by Mr. Piddington in his then unpublished\npaper.\nOn my informing Myersw,\nby message in sealed envelope\n(posted 25 Feby. 1910, opened and read by Mrs. W. on March\n7), how good and clever we thought the whole intention of\n\" Flavieomata,\" the response came, on March 7, 1910,\nYes that point I knew had a good chance.\nIt was Sidgwick who suggested it\nHes He is not able to do much with this\nMachine but he can through me assist\nvia my Machine here.\nI expect to have more to say some day about the implication\nof a sort of mediumship on that side, mingled with the possibility\nof what I am inclined to guess may be an ethereous body,\nwhich is here indistinctly suggested. But all this would\nopen a large subject which can well await further treatment\nhereafter. Compare, however, a hint in my own previously\npublished little book \" The Ether of Space,\" end of Chapter\nVIII.\nThen the script of March 7, 1910, goes on:\nWrite again the Nightingale\nI want that seen to\nPluto not not Plato this time but PLUTO\nBees Bees the hum of Bees.\nNow, \" Nightingale,\" as we have seen, is a recognised reference\nto Lethe, and so is the \"hum of Bees,\" pp. 137, 138, and 144.\nUpon it Mrs. Verrall noted in May, 1910 :\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the reference here is to\nAm. vi., the bees round the lilies at Lethe's stream. The word\nhum represents the Latin \" strepit omnis murmure campus.\" This I\nthink very remarkable,\u2014the reference I mean to \" hum of bees \" as\na reminiscence evoked by Lethe. J. O. P. will tell you of the special\ninterest that the passage has in connexion with \"lilies and poppies\"\nin his Lethe paper. And if I have not sent you a reprint of a\nrecent article of mine in the Classical Review I will do so.\nThis paper of Mrs. Verrall's in the Classical Review for\nMarch, 1910, has reference to the association of Bees and\n\f164 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nLilies in Virgil, with the special significance which he probably\nattached to the symbolism. But I confess that the actual\ncommunications of scholars on these subjects are so like the\nscattered references in the scripts, \u2014both of those which have\nnow appeared in Vol. XXIV. and of those which I obtained\nthrough Mrs. Willett at a date before that part of the Proceedings\nhad been published, \u2014that it requires some effort to discriminate\nbetween them ; which tends to confirm my impression that we\nare tapping a mind full of literary feeling and classical scholar-\nship. And the advantage of the fact that these communications\nhave come to me is obvious, since my mind is only potentially,\nbut not actually, either the one or the other.\nChap. VII. Evidence for Scholarship.\nOne of the points which Mrs. Verrall specially notices in\nscripts which purport to come from Myers is ' their occasional\nscholarly character\u2014beyond any ordinary amateurish acquaint-\nance with classical literature. This I think comes out clearly\nin the material received through Mrs. Piper by Mr. Dorr (as\npublished in Part LX. of the Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.), but it\ncomes out with equal strength in the material received through\nMrs. Willett, who is quite ignorant of Classics, though she\nhas a fair amount of ordinary literary knowledge,\u2014much more\nthan Mrs. Piper has.\nA simple and not specially striking instance of accuracy in\nclassical allusion shown by Willett script may be cited as an\nillustration. When the word \" Hemlock \" appeared in a script\nof March 7, 1910, the continuation was:\nHemlock and the cold slowly rising, met in serene confidence\nthe draught of deliverance. See also the Phsedo. The attitude was\nthe result of long years of pondering, and of intuitive knowledge\nthe same as we are now arriving at by the slower but necessary\nmethod of experiment.\nThese few words, says Mrs. Verrall, are exceedingly well\nchosen and represent both the account by Xenophon (Memora-\nbilia, iv. 8) which emphasises the \" deliverance,\" and by Plato\n(Pltccdo) which shows the \" cold slowly rising \" the \" serene\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some Neiv Script. 165\nconfidence \" and the \" draught.\" The next sentence too\n\u2014\" his\nattitude was the result of long years of pondering and of\nintuitive knowledge,\"\u2014is a good and scholarly description.\nIt must be noted, however, that the two chief authorities\nfor the life of Socrates are mentioned in Human Personality,\nVol. II., p. 95, and that some years ago Mrs. Willett read a\ntranslation of the concluding chapters of the Phaedo.\nI myself note one among many illustrations of classical\naccuracy, in the fact that between the rivers mentioned in the\nJEneid, Book VI., namely, the Styx, Cocytus, and other rivers\nof Hades on the one hand, and Lethe\u2014a river washing the\nshores of the Elysian fields\u2014on the other, no kind of confusion\nhas ever been exhibited by a Myers control. Such confusion\nis not always avoided by scholars, for on my relating to an\nexceptionally learned classical Professor some part of the Virgilian\nreminiscence stimulated in Mrs. Piper's trance-communicator\nby the word \" Lethe,\" he at once cproted the famous line\nabout the dead stretching out their hands in longing toward\nthe further shore : Tendehantque manus ripaz ulterioris amove.\nBut the souls which congregate on Lethe banks,\u2014and which,\nin a Virgilian passage alluded to in the script, are likened to\nthe swarmino- of bees,\u2014are not thinking of the farther shore at\nall ;\nthey do not want to get across Lethe, they want to drink\nit. It is the dead who lie unburied on the earth or sea\nwho stand on the bank, not of Lethe but of Cocytus\n\u2014\nit is these who stretch out their hands in longing toward the\ni'arther shore ; for they are not allowed to cross in Charon's\nboat until their bodies are buried.\nIndeed, in a Myers H. V. script of Sept. 1908 (see Proe.\nYo\\. XXIV., p. 191) this river of Hades is definitely referred\nto as \" the river of wailing,\" and is mentioned in the same\nsentence with Lethe in order apparently to emphasise the\ndistinction between them :\nNo no go not to Lethe, and the river of wailing too,\nUpon the shore they stood and stretched their arms.\nAn incident showing at least an elementary knowledge of\nGreek on the part of one of the inspirers of Willett script,\n\u2014\nGurneyw probably\u2014to the extent at any rate of Greek declen-\nsions and the meaning of a couple of words, one not a common\n\f166 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\none, (p)')iu.>i and xp\/ovxo'c,\u2014may perhaps be noted later in its\nproper place ; but another incident indicative of classical know-\nledge may be conveniently reported here.\nPrayer of Ajax.\nWhen speaking of the difficulty which people have in follow-\ning up anything which negatives the trend of their own life\nwork, and of the absence in most cases of any strenuous long-\ning for illumination whatever might be the result, Myersw,\ncommunicating with me orally in May 1910,\u2014in a manner\nwhich will be described at the beginning of the next chapter\n\u2014said :\nLight more light though it should blind me.\nA prayer, that is, a prayer long ago.\nTo which I replied :\n\" Yes I know, the prayer of dying Goethe.\"\nOn which I got the response\n:\nYes but there is a classical analogy.\nPrayer of Ajax.\nThis I then dimly remembered, and with assistance found\nit, in the Iliad, XVII., 647, ev oe (paei kou oXe&crov}\nThis may be regarded as common knowledge, and its occur-\nrence is therefore not remarkable. The line is quoted and\naccurately translated in the biographical Memoir of Henry\nBidgwick, which Mrs. Willett had read ; but she does not\nknow the Greek letters. The same English phrase \" though it\nblind me,\" without the Greek, had occurred in the script of\nMiss Helen Verrall, who had made a note associating it with\nboth Goethe and Ajax ;\nand this, too, had been seen by Mrs.\nWillett. Mrs. Willett herself associates it with Goethe, so\nshe tells me in reply to an enquiry, but with nothing else.\n1\nThe prayer is made by Telamonian Ajax in the midst of the strange darkness\nwhich the gods had sent to protect the body of Patroclus and to assist the\nTrojans. The appeal is for light, even though it be fatal, and may be para-\nphrased thus\u2014If thou wilt destroy us, yet destroy us in the light ;\nor, let us\nhave light whatever be the consequence ;\nor, let us perish in the face of day.\nGoethe of course used the word \"Light,\"' as it was used in the above script,\nfor mental illumination.\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 167\nNow comes the notable incident of which the above is a\nnecessary though detached and independent prelude.\nAbout a week later I had another opportunity of receiving\ncommunications personally ;\nand after a great number of other\nsubjects the question came orally\n:\nNow Lodge do you want to say anything to me ?\nI then said, \" May T ask a question ?\n\" and on permission\nbeing given I asked, a propos of nothing, what a certain\nsentence meant, namely,\nev 06 (pdei icai oXecrcroi'.\nThe oral conversation through Mrs. Willett which followed\nI had better give in full ; it will be perceived that Mrs.\nWillett speaks of the communicator in the third person, as\n\" he,\" though at the beginning and the end a few words are\nreported in the first person\n:\nO. J. L. Do the words [just cited, \u2014-spoken thus, without translation\nor explanation] mean anything to you ?\nMrs. W. Greek.

There was nothing to indicate any connexion with\nwhat had been a mere episode on a previous occasion among\na mass of other material.

VIII. Non-Evidential Statements.\nIn addition to script which reached me by post I had in\nMay, 1910, some short personal interviews with Mrs. Willett,\nfor the purpose of receiving automatic communications ; and\nat these sometimes the pencil was laid down, and she began\nto talk instead of writing : thus making it more like a \" voice-\nsitting \" with Mrs. Piper instead of a \" writing-sitting,\" except\nthat Mrs. Willett did not go into any kind of trance but merely\nsat and spoke. It appears to be a sort of inspirational speak-\ning, but not of a vague or general kind, it is definitely associated\nwith a particular personality e.g. Myersw or Gurneyw, and has\nbeen found to be evidentially worth attention.\nThe utterance is often fluent and rapid, and note-taking is\ndifficult ; indeed it hardly seems to be desired. I noted all\nI could, being able to write very rapidly, though I regret to\nsay very illegibly also. Consequently the report, of which\nonly samples are now given, is not always perfectly verbatim.\nMost of it is correct, however, and from it I will select\nalmost at random a few statements from the Myersw com-\nmunications, which may be of interest although they are of\na non-evidential character. One is to the effect that\nTelepathy is not a matter of the organism, nor of any shadow\nof it. It does not pertain to matter, nor is it the result\nof any physical peculiarity. No, it is the law of the Mete-\ntherial, it is the mark of evolution in human faculty, the\nextension of man's powers not evolved by the friction of\nmaterial self-preservation : not protoj)lasmic but cosmic.\nSome of this is certainly rather characteristic.\n\f170 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nSo also is the following rebuke addressed to me in connexion\nwith my preliminary non-recognition of the appropriateness of his\nanswer to my Lethe question, namely, the answer \" the will\nagain to live,\" and his references to reincarnation\n:\nWhy did you say that the reference to reincarnation was in-\nappropriate when it emerged as an answer what had Lethe\nreminded him of? You saw in it a repetition of something\nthat the machine had been reading. It was more than that.\n[See App. B. above, p. 146.]\nWhy did you send her your paper*?

Discussion of the Possibility of a Normal\nExplanation of the Facts.\nMost of the script of major importance received by me,\nand dealt with above, seems to have been started into activity\nby my question about Lethe. At first the answers were con-\nfined to reminiscences of Lethe itself, but the idea was speedily\ncaught that I wanted to detect in Myersw knowledge of\nmatters that had been referred to by other Myers controls,\nI know what Lodge wants, he wants me to prove that I\nhave access to knowledge shown elsewhere.\nThis was, indeed, exactly the object of my question,\u2014and\nMyersw entered into the game con amove, flooding me with\nliterary and classical allusions.\nBut, of all the scripts thus received, I think none excelled\nin interest the one obtained on the first occasion\u2014immediately\nafter the envelope containing my question had been opened by\nMrs. Willett\u2014namely, on February 4, 1910. The extraordinary\nappropriateness of the answers then given, to the idea of\n\" Lethe \" as treated in classical and modern literature, seems\nto me a truly remarkable fact.\nIt will be contended that Mrs. Willett is simply reproducing\nthings already within her normal knowledge (both supra- and\nsub-liminal). A good many of the allusions made in the\nscript have reference to things that we know she has seen\nand partially read,\u2014for instance, F. W. H. Myers's Essay on\nVirgil, Human Personality, Church's Stories, and those numbers\nof the Proceedings S.P.R. which are mentioned by Mrs. Verrall\non p. 215, besides ordinary literary sources known to educated\npeople. Moreover not a few of the phrases employed in her\nscript had already appeared in scripts of other automatists, some\nof which she had seen. The history of what she had seen\nmust be narrated by Mrs. Verrall, but I understand that in\nher judgment the evidence is not thereby weakened. The way\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some New Script. 173\nin which these allusions are combined or put together, and\ntheir connexion with each other indicated, is the striking\nthing,\u2014it seems to me as much beyond the capacity of\nMrs. Willett as it would be beyond my own capacity. I\nbelieve that if the matter is seriously studied, and if Mrs.\nWillett's assertions concerning her conscious knowledge and\nsupraliminal procedure are believed, this will be the opinion of\ncritics also ;\nthey will realise, as I do, that we are tapping the\nreminiscences not of an ordinarily educated person but of a\nscholar, \u2014no matter how fragmentary and confused some of the\nreproductions are. I quite recognise that safety and credit lie\nin the direction of forcing, even into absurdity, every explanation\nthat can by any means be considered normal ;\nbut, in spite of\nthat, I am bound to say that no normal explanation that has\nas yet been suggested wears the garb of truth.\nThe problem that has to be solved is how it comes about\nthat all those appropriate literary and classical reminiscences\nflow from Mrs. Willett's hand in response to a given\nstimulus ; and I confess that I cannot conceive any normal\nexplanation for it, except the supposition of fraud on the\npart of Mrs. Willett. Fraud, I mean in this sense,\u2014that\ninstead of really opening the envelope and reading the ques-\ntion for the first time on February 4th, 1910, as recorded\non p. 121 above,\u2014just when she was ready for her automatic\nwriting, with no source of information open to her except her\nown knowledge,\u2014she had in reality, and contrary to her\nstatement which I fully believe, opened the envelope some\nweeks previously, had industriously studied the subject with\nthe aid of classical friends, and was now retailing information\nthus normally obtained.\nSuch a supposition\u2014grotesque to any one who knows Mrs.\nWillett\u2014is one that by a stranger may be preferred to any\nother, in this particular instance, notwithstanding the fact that it\nconspicuously fails to account for knowledge of what had come\nthrough in certain scripts of other automatists\u2014scripts which\nwere certainly unknown to Mrs. Willett. And\u2014if I may\nparaphrase a sentence of Henry Sidgwick's in an early address\nto the Society, Proc. Vol. I., p. 12 \u2014it will be an indication of\nthe value and success of the effort made by the communicators,\nand of the test which they have supplied us with, if such a\n\f174 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nsupposition is seriously urged as competent to furnish a\nnormal explanation.\nIt may be said \u2014for such things are often said\u2014that\nit is the most scientific course to press a normal explana-\ntion at all hazards, and in face of every obstacle, before\nadmitting anything else. With this contention, plausible\nas it sounds, and true though it is in many cases, I\ndo not agree. The scientific attitude is to find if possible\nthe true solution, not the most plausible or superficial\none, of any problem. And it is by no means scientific to\nignore a number of the facts and conditions, when devising\neven a provisional explanation. Some view which occurs to\na casual reader ought not to be allowed to supersede and\noverpower the deliberate judgment of a careful student of the\nfacts. I assert that no careful student of the phenomena \u2014\nthat is no one who painstakingly scrutinises the whole of the\nevidence \u2014can be permanently satisfied, in this case, with a\nnormal explanation ; and I have not scrupled to indicate\nthroughout my own view.\nFor instance, at the outset, the kind of references and classical\nallusions which would be given by a fraudulent writer would\nsurely be of an inferior and less scholarly description than those\nwhich have actually been obtained. Moreover, although the\nhypothesis of fraud may manage to survive in connexion\nwith the occurrences on one particular date, when Mrs. Willett\nwas alone, it will not explain what happened on other days,,\nwhen I was present myself and put questions and received\nanswers without giving any sort of opportunity for \" hunting\nthings up.\"\nPeople will no doubt say,\u2014oh that was telepathy ! Yes,,\nbut that is not a normal explanation ; and it is entirely\ndifferent from the hypothesis of fraud. The same explanation\nwill not tit the two sets of circumstances ;\ntelepathy will\nnot explain the one, fraud will not explain the other.\nThe only alternative which will explain both, is the\nsupposition that Mrs. Willett is a classical scholar in disguise.\nBut then that will not explain the obtaining of the word\n\" Dorr,\" nor for the knowledge shown of the writings of other\nautomatists. Some other hypothesis has to be invented for all\nthat: and no doubt one will be forthcoming. But it is almost\n\flxiii.] Classical Scholarship, etc., in some Nexv Script. 175\nproverbial in science that whenever a fresh hypothesis has to\nbe invented to account for every fresh case, it is an indication\nthat the explorer is off the track of truth. He feels secure\nand happy in his advance only when one and the same\nhypothesis will account for everything\u2014both old and new\n\u2014\nwhich he encounters.\nThe one hypothesis which seems to me most nearly to\nsatisfy that condition, in this case, is that we are in indirect\ntouch with some part of the surviving personality of a scholar\n\u2014and that scholar F. W. H. Myers.\nThat has gradually come to be, I confess, my own working\nhypothesis, which I am ready to abandon freely on good\ngrounds\u2014but on good grounds only,\u2014not in deference to\nsentimental prejudice. I admit that it is a momentous con-\nclusion\u2014when it comes to be a \" conclusion,\"\u2014I doubt if we\nany of us realise, to the full, how momentous. But in\nscience we are not unused to discoveries of considerable\nmagnitude ; and if, after due scrutiny facts become compulsory,\nmen of science must be ready to enlarge their scheme of the\nuniverse so as to admit them.\n\f176 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nII.\nNOTES ON MES. WILLETT'S SCRIPTS OF FEBRUARY,\n1910.\nBy MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\nIn this paper I propose to supplement Sir Oliver Lodge's general\naccount of Mrs. Willett's script\n:\n(1) by a brief historical statement covering the period between\nMarch, 1908, when answers to a question about Lethe were\nobtained from MyersP,\nand February, 1910, when the repeated\nquestion was answered by Myersw ;\n(2) by a detailed examination of the probable sources of the\nquotations and allusive phrases of which Mrs. Willett's script\nlargely consists.\nThe investigation of these two subjects has increased my sense\nof the value of Mrs. Willett's scripts of February, 1910, by\nadding further evidence of supernormal knowledge on her part,\nand by emphasising the closeness of interconnexion between the\nintelligences which we call Myersw,\nMyersP,\nMyersH,\netc., and so\nreinforcing the claim that each of these intelligences makes to\nrepresent the same underlying personality. For, while Mrs.\nWillett was completely ignorant of what had passed at Mr.\nDorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper in 1908, and of the very fact\nthat he had had sittings in 1909, the statements of Myersw were\nappropriate to an intelligence aware of the conversations between\nMr. Dorr and MyersF in those two years. Again, the apparent\nincoherence of the phrases used by Myers w is reduced to order,\nand their sequence becomes intelligible, when we are acquainted\nwith the contents of other automatic scripts, contents not known,\nwhen the scripts were obtained, to Mrs. Willett, nor known as a\n\fLXIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 177\nwhole to any one living person. Various persons were familiar\nwith parts of the scripts in question, but no one of us possessed\nas a whole the knowledge which, now that it has been collected\ntogether, converts a jumble of disconnected phrases into an intel-\nligible sequence of associated ideas. This fact is an important\nelement not to be overlooked in any attempt to frame a hypothesis\nwhich will account for the phenomena of Mrs. Willett's script.\nThe supplementary evidence here brought forward was for the\nmost part inaccessible to Sir Oliver Lodge, and it seems con-\nvenient to present it to the reader in a separate paper.\nI. From March, 1908, to March, 1910.\nConsiderable time elapsed between the date when Mr. Dorr\nasked MyersP what the word Lethe suggested to him and the\nanswer to that question by Myersw, after its repetition by Sir\nOliver Lodge to Mrs. Willett. It may be useful to state here\nwhat associations with the word Lethe had, during that interval,\nreceived particular attention from the small group of persons\naware of the earlier incident and acquainted with Mrs. Willett's\nphenomena. In this statement 1 have included notes of the dates\nat which, by reading books or by seeing copies of certain selected\nscripts, Mrs. Willett obtained normal knowledge likely to have\naffected the contents of her script. It should, however, be\nremembered that there was no reason why her attention should\nhave been directed to allusions, in what she read, to Lethe.\nThe summary is arranged as far as possible in chronological\norder and is followed by detailed explanations of points that\nrequire fuller treatment.\nChronological Sum mary.\nOn March 23, 1908, in the course of sittings held with Mrs.\nPiper between March 9 and May 26, 1908, and largely occupied\nwith attempts to revive the literary memories of Frederic Myers,1\nMr. Dorr asked of MyersP the question :\n\" What does the word\nLethe suggest to you ?\n\" The answers given consisted chiefly of\nallusions to Ovid's account of the source of the water of Lethe as\ntold in the story of Ceyx and Alcyone (Met. XL), but incidentally\nJ\nSee Proc, Vol. XXIV., Part LX., published in April, 1910.\nM\n\f178 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nshowed a knowledge of certain Virgilian associations with Lethe,\nas an Elysian river (Proc., Vol. XXIV., pp. 134-5) visited by\nAeneas in company with the Sibyl (Proc, Vol. XXIV., pp.\n144-50). None of these allusions were recognised by Mr. Dorr.\nIn October, 1908, Mrs. Sidgwick made a preliminary examina-\ntion of the record of these sittings, and in November, 1908, I\nmade a detailed study of the classical allusions in them, but in my\nignorance of Ovid's Metamorphose* I failed to trace any coherence\nin the answers of MyersP to Mr. Dorr's question about Lethe.\nOn December 13, 1908, Mr. Dorr had a sitting with Mrs.\nPiper, at which, in continuance of his earlier experiment, he read\naloud several times in Latin the speech 1\nof Anchises (jEn., VI,,\n724-751) and also a passage from Swinburne's Hymn of Man\u2014\nin the Songs before Sunrise\u2014quoted in Frederic Myers's Science\nanel a. Future Life (p. 177). The control showed no signs of\nrecognising either passage, but at the close of the sitting MyersP\nstated that he would refer to the Latin within a few hours \" at\nMrs. Verrall's.\" I knew nothing of what had taken place at\nthese sittings, and indeed was not aware till April, 1909, that\nMr. Dorr had had any sittings with Mrs. Piper except those\nbetween March and May, 1908.\nOn December 21, 1908, I read through the Sixth JEneid for\nthe purpose of a paper,\n2\nwhich was completed on January 11,\n1909 ; between these two dates there were references to Virgil by\nMyersv. Thus in my script of December 29, 1908, it was said\nthat in every script containing a single word of Virgil something\nwould be found derived from an external source, as distinguished\nfrom the subliminal self of the automatist ; on January 6,\n1909, the script contained words noted at the time as a transla-\ntion of Virgil's lines (JEii.,VI., 129-31) describing those admitted\nto the underworld ; and on January 11, 1909, Myersv wrote that\n\"the Virgil\" had helped, and that he thought he could get a\nreflexion of the thought elsewhere.\n3\nMeanwhile, on January 4, 1909, and again on January 5,\n1\nFor an account of this speech, see Sir Oliver Lodge's paper above, pp. 184, 135,\n144.\n2\nSubsequently published in the March, 1009, number of the Magazine of the\nNational Home Reading Union.\n3\nThe text of the scripts is given below, p. 183. The script of Jan. 6, 1909, was\nsubsequently found to contain a cross-correspondence with Mrs. Willett on a\nliteraiy but non-classical subject, which it is hoped shortly to publish.\n\fLXIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 179\n1909, Mr. Dorr read to Myers P translations by Cranch and\nby Frederic Myers, of JEneid, VI. 724-751 (Anchises' speech),\nand also in Latin JEneid, VI. 883-886 (Lilies for Marcellus).\nTranslations were also read of passages from Lucretius, Book III.,\nand Virgil, Georgia II., and Eclogue IV. The greater part of\nboth sittings was occupied with reading to the control, and\nnothing was said in the trance indicating any recognition by\nMyers P of the Virgilian passages.\nIn February, 1909, Mr. Piddington was at work on the\npaper subsequently published in Proc, Vol. XXIV., under the\ntitle \" A Prelude and a Sequel to the Horace Ode Question,\"\nand about February 28 lie found the passage in Ovid's Meta-\nmorphoses which for the first time explained to us the allusions\nto the story of Ceyx and Alcyone by Myers P in March -May,\n1908. Between March and July, 1909, he was engaged in\nwriting the papers on \" Three Incidents \" from those sittings,\nwhich were published later in Proc., Vol. XXIV. In the course\nof the summer the contents of these papers were communicated\nto the small group of persons\u2014of whom Mrs. Willett was,\nof course, not one\u2014engaged in investigating the records of Mr.\nDorr's sittings before they were published.\nOn March 1, 1909, Mr. Dorr, before having heard anything of\nMr. Piddington's discoveries, read to Myers P , in the original,\nthree passages from JEneid, VI., namely, 124-129 (descent\nto Avernus), 143-8 (description of Golden Bough), 883-\n886 (Lilies for Marcellus). and translations of the last two,,\nand also of 724-751 (Anchises' speech). At the suggestion\nof Mr. Piddington, but without knowing why the suggestion\nwas made, he also during the sitting read aloud in Latin the\nfirst six lines of Horace, Odes, I. 28 (Archytas), mentioned\nthe phrase Adscriptas glebae, and read aloud in Greek the\nwords of Achilles (Od. XL 489), which Mr. Piddington believes\nto have been associated in Frederic Myers's mind with that\nOde of Horace (Proc, XXIV, 150-169). Confident, though\nerroneous, statements were made by the Piper-controls in their\nattempts to identify the authorship of the various passages\nread. Successful attempts at cross-correspondence were made\nin this sitting,1\nbut no knowledge whatever was shown of the\npassages read by Mr. Dorr.\n1\nOnly one is noticed in this paper, below, p. 184.\n\f180 Mrs, A. W. Verrall. [part\nOn April 26, 1909, I heard that on December 13, 1908,\nand March 1, 1909, Myers P had expressed to Mr. Dorr the\nintention of conveying in my script allusions to JEneid, VI.\n724-751 (Anchises' speech), and 124-129 (descent to Avernns).\nOn April 29, 1909, Miss Verrall's script, written in my\npresence, combined with \"jam satis\" (a quotation from Horace,\nOdes, I. 2) the phrase \" Tu Marcellus eris \" (JSneid, VI. 883).\nThis phrase was repeated in H.V. script, again in connexion\nwith the same Ode of Horace, on May 6, 1909. Allusions\nto the Golden Bough (JEneid, VI. 201-9) appeared in H.V.\nscript of May 11 and 13, 1909.\nOn May 19, 1909, I sent to Mrs. Willett, who had not\nseen the above-described H.V. scripts, the following questions\nto be addressed to Myersw : (1) 'Please make clear the con-\nnexion between \" tu Marcellus eris\" and \"jam satis\"'; (2)\n'\nplease explain why the Golden Bough is mentioned,' telling\nher that the questions referred to recent H.V. script. No\nanswer was obtained from Mrs. Willett, as she had no oppor-\ntunity, while trying for script, of putting the questions to the\ncommunicator.\nOn June 26, 1909, Mrs. Willett read parts of F. W. H.\nMyers's Essays, Classical and Modern, including the Essay on\nVirgil.\nOn July 26, 1909, copies of Miss Verrall's above-described\nscript (April 29, May 6, May 11 and May 13), were shown to\nMrs. Willett.\nIn August, 1909, Mrs. Willett read Euskin's Sesame and\nLilies, which incidentally mentions Dante's \" Matilda by the\nedge of happy Lethe.\"\nOn September 28, 1909, Sir Oliver Lodge sent to Mrs.\nWillett the covering letter and the closed envelope, containing\nthe question about Lethe to be addressed, when an opportunity\noccurred, to Myersw as described in his paper. Mr. Piddington\nwas informed of this by Sir Oliver Lodge.\nOn October 1, 1909, I heard from Sir Oliver Lodge that he\nhad thus sent an exact repetition of the question asked by\nMr. Dorr :\n\" What does the word Lethe suggest to you ?\n\"\nThe expectation\u2014so far as there was any expectation\u2014both\nof Sir Oliver Lodge and of me, was that this question might\nelicit from Myers w allusions similar to those produced in Mr.\n\flxiil] Notes on Mrs. Willetfs Scripts. 181\nDorr's sittings of 1908 by Myers P, i.e. to the Metamorphoses\nof Ovid. Mrs. Willett was in complete ignorance of what\nhad taken place at those sittings.\nOn October 28, 1909, an abbreviated arrangement of Mr.\nPiddington's paper on Lethe (Proc., Vol. XXIV., pp. 86-144)\nwas read by Miss Verrall in London at a meeting of the\nS.P.K., for Members and Associates only. No report of that\npaper or of its subject appeared in the Journal or elsewhere.\nMrs. Willett was not present nor did she hear anything\nabout the meeting from anyone. The two papers entitled\n\" The Sibyl \" and \" A Prelude and a Sequel to the Horace Ode\nquestion,\" subsequently published in the Proceedings (Vol.\nXXIV., pp. 144-169), were not read at the meeting.\nIn January, 1910, I learnt from Mrs. Willett that Sir\nOliver Lodge's closed envelope had not yet been opened by\nher.\nOn February 4, 1910, Mrs. Willett opened this envelope,\nand answers from Myers w were obtained, as described in Sir\nOliver Lodge's paper, on February 4, 5 and 10.\nIn March, 1910, in the Classical Review was published a\npaper, long planned by me, and written about November, 1909,\nwhich dealt with two points in the Sixth JEnevl, 11. 27-30\n(sculpture on the temple near the Sibyl's cave), and 707-9\n(lilies by Lethe's stream).\nThis concludes the chronological summary. Some points\nrequire further comment.\nAttempt at Cross-correspondences on the Sixth JEneid\nWhile the answers of MyersP in 1908 to Mr. Dorr's\nquestion about Lethe had referred in the first instance, and\nmainly, to Ovid's Lethe, it was the Virgilian Lethe which\nemerged instantly and unmistakably in the answers of Myers w\nin 1910. For this various explanations may be offered, among\nwhich must be reckoned the normal knowledge of the auto-\nmatist\u2014whatever be the intelligence that utilised that knowledge\nand selected appropriate items. But it has been suggested to\nme by Miss Johnson that there is another factor which must\nnot be left out of consideration. In Mr. Dorr's four sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper in December, 1908, and January and March,\n\f182 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\n1909, Mr. Dorr, carrying further the scheme inaugurated by\nhim in 1908, selected several passages from Latin authors to\nread aloud as likely to be familiar to the supposed com-\nmunicator. Four of these selections were from the Sixth\nJEneid. Of these four, two passages, both closely associated\nwith Lethe (Anchises' speech, 724-751, and the descent to\nAvernus, 124-129) were chosen by Myers P for transmission\nto me. This choice suggests that some special interest was\nattached to these particular passages by Myers P,\nthough here\nagain the selection may have been determined telepathically\nby my own preoccupations at the time.\nThe facts are as follows\n:\n(1) Anchises Speech (724-751).\nOn December 13, 1908, two passages in all were read by\nMr. Dorr to MyersP, \u2014the whole speech made by Anchises\nbeside the \" Lethean stream,\" and eight lines from Swinburne's\nHymn of Man. The greater part of the sitting was occupied\nwith reading and spelling over to the control the twenty-eight\nLatin lines. At the close MyersP said, \" I shall refer to the\nLatin within a few hours earthly time at Mrs. Verrall's.\nMyers. And translate it here when we meet again. 1\nM.\"\nNo script was produced by me after December 11, 1908,\ntill December 28, by which date my thoughts were normally\nmuch occupied with the Sixth JUncicl, which I read through on\nDecember 21, as above described. No reference to the speech\nof Anchises was made in my script, which, however, about\nthat period contained four statements by Myersv which may\nbe connected with the expressed intention of MyersP.\n(a) December 28, 1908.\n. . . But listen. I have got a clear message written by Mrs.\nPiper just lately, which you will understand when you see it. . . .\nF. W. H. M.\nThis was the first reference in my script to Mrs. Piper\n1\nNo opportunity occurred for translation by Myersp, as Mr. Dorr's next\nsitting, on Jan. 4, 1909, was largely occupied by unavoidable discussion of\nMrs. Piper's future plans, after which Mr. Dorr read to the controls certain\npassages, among thein being a translation of the speech of Anchises.\n\fLXIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 183\nsince Nov. 5, 1907, when a reference was made to the English\nexperiments of 1906 and 1907.\n(b) December 29, 1908.\n. . . lovers of Virgil remember that phrase\u2014it will serve as a\nlink more than once. Wherever in any writing you find the words\nor even a single word of Virgil, there you will find something that\nhas filtered through from an external source, not yours, nor Helen's,\nnor compound of both. . . . Wherever you have the Virgilian words\nlook for a meaning in the passage, a direct message from me. Do\nyou want the signature 1\nYours. F. W. H. M.\n(c) January 6, 1909.\n. . . Yet some there are by valour or God's grace\nHeroes and prophets, leaders of the race,\nWho thro' the barriers ordained have past\nAnd seen the Form within the Shadowy Vast.\nF. W. H.

The Virgil has helped. I think I can get a reflection of\nthe thought elsewhere. But I wish you would sit with Mrs. Piper.\n... I have a new type of expt. to try, but I must have Mrs.\nPiper quite clear for that. . . .\nF. W. H. M.\n\" The Virgil,\" as I noted at the time, might refer either to\nthe paraphrase in my script of January 6, or to the paper\non the Sixth ^EJneid, which I completed just before obtaining\nscript on January 11.\nBut although there was no reference in my script to the\nspeech of Anehises, three words from that speech did appear\nin my daughters script of January 22, 1909, which opened\nwith the words, \" Spiritus intus alit.\" These are the first three\nwords of the third line of Anehises' speech (JEneid, VI. 726),\nand summarise the philosophic view there set forth. No other\n\f184 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nquotation from Virgil is found in H.V. script between\nSeptember 10, 1908\\ and March 23, 190!), on each of which\ndays occurred a phrase (not the same phrase) from the First\nJEneid. Her next quotation from the Sixth JEneid, \" Tu\nMarcellus eris,\" is on April 29, 1909, as described above.\nThe speech of Anehises then, which MyersP undertook to\nrepeat to me on December 13, 1908, was not mentioned in\nmy script, but its leading words are found on January 22, 1909,\nin my daughter's script.\n2\n(2) Descent to Avernus (124-129).\nOn March 1, 1909, Mr. Dorr read to MyersP the opening\nlines of the Sibyl's answer to Aeneas' request to visit\nhis father, beginning with 1. 124, and ending in the middle\nof 1. 129. To his question whether he had made the lines\nclear, MyersP replied :\n\" Very good. 1 want you to continue a\nlittle or take another, to get several through and to show you\nmy answer clearly. I will not only give it here, but 1 will\nrefer to it at Mrs. Verrall's also.\"\nNeither my script nor my daughter's reproduced the actual\nlines read, though the lines immediately following (129-181,\n\" pauci quos . . . potuere\") were, as I have said, paraphrased\nin my script of January 0, 1909.\nSo far we have considered the connexion between MyersP\nand Myeisv or MyersH v. But the connexion of Myersw with\nMyerSp seems closer. MyersP had no further opportunity of\nshowing his knowledge of the passages read to Mrs. Piper by\nMr. Dorr on March 1, 1909, as Mr. Dorr had no more sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper. The passages from Virgil read on that day\nby Mr. Dorr were four :\n(1) Descent to Avernus, in Latin.\n(2) Golden Bough, in Latin and English.\n(3) Speech of Anehises, in English.\n(4) Lilies for Marcellus, in Latin and English.\nThe last three of these were immediately and clearly\nreferred to by Myersw on February J, 1910, when Mrs.\n1\nSee Miss Johnson's paper below, p. 237.\n'-See Proc, Vol. XX., p. 258, for another case where a \"message for trans-\nmission\" intended for me appeared in H.V. script.\n\fLxur.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 185\nWillett opened Sir Oliver Lodge's envelope : namely Golden\nBough, Marcellus, and Anchises' speech,\u2014this last by the words\n\" blending of the essence with the instrument.\"\n1\nThe first on\nthe list, the Descent to Avernus, was not alluded to on\nFebruary 4, but hinted at on February 10 in the remark\nabout the place where the Sibyl lived. Later we shall see\n2\nthat other classical topics brought to the notice of MyersP in\nthe course of Mr. Dorr's readings on March 1, 1909 emerged\nin Mrs. Willett's script of February 10, 1910. So that it\nwould seem as if the threads left loose by MyersP at the last\nsitting of Mr. Dorr were at once picked up by Myersw on\nthe communication to Mrs. Willett of Sir Oliver Lodge's\nquestion. Of Mr. Dorr's sittings neither Sir Oliver Lodge nor\nMrs. Willett had any knowledge whatever ;\nany connexion,\ntherefore, between those sittings and Mrs. Willett's script, if not\naccidental, must be wholly supernormal, and, moreover, cannot\nhave been derived by direct telepathy from Sir Oliver Lodge.\nBut though Mrs. Willett had no normal knowledge of Mr.\nDorr's experiments, she had seen certain selected scripts of\nmy daughter's, and I now pass on to consider what use was\nmade of that knowledge in her own script.\nMrs. Willett's utilisation of H. V. Scrijrf.\nOn May 19, 1909, as has been narrated above, Mrs.\nWillett's attention was directed by my questions to the phrase\n\" Tu Marcellus eris \" in connexion with an Ode of Horace,\nand at the same time to the Golden Bough.\nIn June Mrs. Willett read, either in whole or in part,\nFrederic Myers's Essay on Virgil. This Essay refers in foot-\nnotes to dZn., VI., on the pages where mention is made of\nLethe (p. 172) and of the golden bough (p. 112), and to it\nis prefixed, as part of its motto, Tennyson's line\n3\n\" Golden branch amid the shadows.\"\n1\nMrs. Willett's scripts are quoted on pp. 123, 124, 126, 148-50 ; for her\nnormal knowledge on these points, see JSir O. Lodge's paper passim, and\nalso below, p. 193.\n2\nBelow, p. 188.\na\nNo mention is made of the authorship of the line either there, or later (p. 148)\nwhere the line is quoted.\n\f186 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nOn July 26, no answer having been obtained to my questions,\nMrs. Willett was shown copies of the H.V. scripts which had\nsuggested them to me. Two of these scripts (April 29, May 6)\ncombined allusions to \" Tu Marcellus eris \" with an Ode of\nHorace, and the other three (May 11, May 13, May 20)\nmentioned the Golden Bough. I quote the relevant parts\n:\nApril 29, 1909.

But if normal association only is at\nwork, what induced her to omit all reference to the Ode of\nHorace definitely associated in her mind with the phrase\nTu Marcellus eris, both by my question on May 19, 1909,\nand by the statements of the above H.V. scripts which she\nsaw on July 26 ?\nSuch a reference would of course be inappropriate among\nassociations with Lethe. But how did Mrs. Willett know that ?\nShe could have learnt it neither from her knowledge of Virgil,\n\f188 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nwhich is small, nor from her knowledge of Horace, which is\nless. Suppose, however, that we attribute to a happy accident\nthe omission from a Lethe-context of all reference to a topic\n(Ode of Horace) normally associated by Mrs. Willett with\nanother topic (Tu Marcellus eris) which is introduced into\nher script. To what happier accident are we to attribute the\ncombination of Horace with Homer on February 10, 1910, in\na phrase directly reminiscent of the H.V. script of April 29,\n1909, where it is applied to Horace and Virgil? MyersHV ,\non April 29, 1909, wrote of the \"common thought\" of Horace\nand Virgil which he could not \" get clear.\" Myersw writes\non February 10, 1910, \"Homer and Horace the thought allied\nbut I cannot get it clear.\" Words clearly recalling the H.V.\nscript are utilized to convey something new, something not\nnormally known to Mrs. Willett, an alliance of thought between\nHomer and Horace.\nThe only commentary, 1 make bold to say, that has suggested\nan alliance of thought between those two poets is the commentary\nby Mr. Piddington on the obscure early writings of Myersv\n(iVoc, Vol. XXIV, pp. 150-169). In February, 1909, Mr.\nPiddington was considering what bearing certain statements\nabout Horace, made by MyersP in March, 1908, had on the\njuxtaposition by Myersv in March, 1901, of a quotation from\nHorace, Od. I. 28, and a Latin version (adscriptus glcbae)\nof a word\n\u2014\neirapovpos\u2014which occurs only in HOMEK, Odyssey,\nXL 489. Mr. Piddington, without giving his reasons, asked\nMr. Dorr to read certain passages to Myers P.\nAccordingly\non March 1, 1909, Mr. Dorr read to MyersP :\n(a) the\nfirst six lines of that Ode of Horace (in Latin), and, after an\ninterval occupied with other matters, (b) the phrase adscriptus\nglebae, followed by (c), the words fiovXoifxyv k eirapovpo<; ewv\nO^TfJo\/xei' a\\\\w [rather would I be a slave and the hireling of\nanother . . . (than rule among the dead)], in the original Greek\n(Odys., XI. 489). Considerable time was spent in communi-\ncating these words, and in their repetition to the control.\nWhen this was over, and Mr. Dorr asked if the subject should\nnow be left, Myers P replied: \"Yes you may be sure of our\nanswer.\"\nThat answer may be found in Mrs. Willett's script of February\n10, 1910, which contains a translation of this line from the\n\fI. XIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 189\nOdyssey, prefaced by words probably reminiscent of the diver-\ngent sentiment uttered by Milton's fallen archangel in the\nfamous line (Par. Lost, I. 263)\n\u2014\n\" Better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven.\"\nMrs. Willett's script runs: ''Better to Rule among no to\nslave among the living than King it mid the Dead.\"\nThe Homeric line is translated in Mr. Piddington's paper,\nwritten between April and July, 1909, and published in April,\n1910 (Proc, Vol. XXIV, Part LX.), after the production of\nMrs. Willett's script. This paper is a further contribution\n\u2014\n\" a prelude and a sequel \"\n\u2014to the Horace Ode question, which\nwas published in the Proceedings (Vol. XXII.) of October, 1908.\nThat volume was read soon after publication by Mrs. Willett.\nIn this earlier paper the attention of the reader is directed\nentirely to the question of connexion between Horace's Ode to\nArchytas and a poem by F. W. H. Myers. There is no mention\nof Homer, and it would need classical knowledge and very\ncareful reading to infer from Mr. Piddington's paper any sug-\ngestion of connexion between Homer and Horace. On p. 400\n(Vol. XXII.) the words of Achilles to Odysseus appear in the\nmiddle of a suggested interpretation of the Ode to Archytas.\nThey occur between the name Pythagoras, who (pp. 404-5) is\ndefinitely stated to be referred to in the Ode, and a verbal\nquotation in Latin from the Ode. There is no mention of\ntheir source nor any indication that they do not form part of\nthe Ode of Horace which Mr. Piddington is paraphrasing, and,\nin the absence of knowledge to the contrary, they would be\ntaken by the reader to be part of that Ode. The only reference\nto the Odyssey in this paper (Vol. XXII., p. 404) would cer-\ntainly not encourage the idea that there was any legitimate\nconnexion between the Odyssey and the Ode of Horace ; for\nRector's half acceptance of Mrs. Sidgwick's suggestion that by\n\" Odessus,\" etc., he was aiming at \" Odyssey,\" is mentioned by\nMr. Piddington as \"a good instance of\" Rector's readiness \"to\naccept a misleading suggestion.\" The second paper, not pub-\nlished till after the production of Mrs. Willett's script, deals\nwith the connexion between Homer and Horace simcrested to\nMr. Piddington by an examination of the statements of MycrsP\nin 1908 and of Myersv in 1901, neither of which were known\n\f190 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nto Mrs. Willett. In this second paper frequent allusion is\nmade to Achilles and this line in the Odyssey.\nMr. Piddington wrote (Proc, Vol. XXIV., p. 159), con-\ncerning Mr. Dorr's reading of the Horatian lines to MyersP on\nMarch 1, 1909, and their failure to elicit a response: \"here for\nthe present, and probably for good, the matter stands.\" But\nI think we may claim that Mrs. Willett's script carries the\nmatter further, and that in the words, \" Myers Homer and\nHorace the thought allied,\" we have from Myersw a response to\na suggestion made nearly a year before to MyersP and not known\nto Mrs. Willett.\nII. Sources and Correspondences of Phrases in\nMrs. Willett's Script.\nAs the greater part of Mrs. Willett's script consists of\nquotations and allusive phrases, some derived from literary\nsources, some paralleled in the scripts of other automatists, I\nhave set out, so far as I could, in the following table these\n\" sources \" and \" correspondences,\" showing in each case whether\nthe corresponding passage was within Mrs. Willett's normal\nknowledge and whether its context supplied a reason for\nassociating it with Lethe. For this purpose, in order to be\non the safe side, I have counted the Sixth jEneid as associated\nwith Lethe, and I have assumed Mrs. Willett to be acquainted\nwith Church's stories based on that book, with all the English\nauthors named in my table, and with all Mr. Myers's published\nwork. Where Mrs. Willett had no normal knowledge of the\nparallel phrases in other automatic writings, the connexion of\ncourse constitutes what we have called a cross-correspondence.\nThroughout I have given references to the numbers of pages\nin this volume where detailed comment may be found, but I\nhave given the names only of the authors, as exact references to\nchapter and verse will in most cases be found in Sir Oliver\nLodge's paper. But in many cases the mere statement and\nclassification is inadequate, and there I have added notes, as\nindicated by the *.\n\fLxur.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 191\nList of Probable Sources of Phrases and Correspondences\nin Mrs. Willett's Script of Feb. 4 and Feb. 10, 1910\nItalics are used where the context of the passage supplies a reason\nfor associating it with Lethe ;\nunderlining is used where the phrase\nin question occurs in an author or script normally unknown to Mrs.\nWillett.

The script ran :\nNo no go not to Lethe . Reeds the reeds by the river's edge\nthe river of forgetfulness and from those reeds the pipes were made\nwhereon the shepherd softly played.\nA recollection of this phrase perhaps accounts for the \" shep-\nherds pipe\" on Feb. 10 (No. 37).\n(5) (6) Tu Marcellus, etc. In valle, etc.\nMrs. Willett knows no Latin and has not read these phrases\nin Virgil's Sixth sEncid, whence they come. But in the copies\nseen by her of the two scripts (Mac and H.Y.) where the Latin\nphrases occurred, references were given to JEn,, VI., so that the\nsource of the two phrases is here counted as within Mrs.\nWillett's normal knowledge. In neither case was there any\nassociation in the script with Lethe.\n(10) Cross-correspondence on Door.\nThis phrase, directly derived from the Rubaiyat of Omar\nKhayyam, as recognised by Mrs. Willett, constitutes a remarkable\ncross-correspondence with the scripts of four other automatists\/\nnamely, (1) Miss Mac and her brother, (2) Miss Verrall, (3)\nMrs. Holland, and (4) Mrs. Forbes.

She was at once struck\nby the resemblance between the sentence in question and the\npun in Mrs. Willett's script of Feb. 4, 1910, on the name\nwhich emerged in her next day's script, in large letters, DORK,\nand shortly afterwards found the references to the same topic in\nthe scripts of Miss Verrall, Mrs. Holland, and Mrs. Forbes\ndescribed below.\nIt is clear, I think, that this allusion in the Mac script\nshould be regarded as belonging to the series of allusions to\nSesame and Lilies, which made up the larger part of the cross-\ncorrespondences between Mac and, Verrall scripts in 1908. It\ndiffers, however, from the rest of that series in two respects\n:\n{a) All the other allusions in the Mac script occurred between\nJuly 19 and July 27, before the beginning of any allusions in\nthe Verrall scripts (Aug. ] 1-2 2)\n;\n(&) The other allusions all came from SidgwickM, whereas\nthis sentence is contributed by one of several unnamed com-\nmunicators combining to tell a romantic story in Italian with\noccasional episodes in English. After the drawing of the arrow\non September 12, 1908, follows an account of the heroine of the\nstory immuring \" herself within the heartless walls of a nunnery.\"\nHer profile is then drawn and this is followed by a message\nfrom the Sidgwick control, thus\n:\nProfessor Sidgwick. Progress is pitifully slow but sure(r) the\neasier it is.\nThe whole preceding communication about the door, the arrow,\nand the Italian ston' is in a new handwriting which reappeared\non one or two occasions but was never assigned to a named\ncontrol.\nRegarded as part of the Srsame and Lilies series, the sentence\nin question has two points of special interest. (1) It is the\nonly allusion in the Mac script to one of the obvious normal\nassociations with the word Sesame, namely the open door,\nand (2) it thereby makes another correspondence with the\nHV script, for on September 23. 1908,\u2014after my daughter\nand I had compared our scripts and detected in them incomplete\nallusions to Sesame and Lilies, but before we had received any\n\fLXIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 195\ncommunication whatever from Miss Mac,\u2014the H.V. script in-\ncluded in its reminiscences of Sesame and Lilies, a topic\u2014the\nopen door\u2014which had not occurred in either M.V. or H.V.\nscript.\n1\nBut in view of the sequel\u2014the reappearance of the Door in\nother scripts and the emergence in later Mac scripts of topics\nselected at Mr. Dorr's sittings for transmission to other auto-\nmatists 2\n\u2014it is possible to see in this sentence a punning\nreference to those sittings. Neither to the Macs, when this\nscript was produced, nor to me when it was received, was it\nknown that messages had come from MyersP since Mrs. Piper's\nreturn to America, or that any sittings with Mrs. Piper had\nbeen held by Mr. Dorr.\n(2) H.V. scripts.\n(a) September 23, 1908.\n. . . note the literary allusions something should be made of them,\nputting one with another the clue is there, but several things have\nbeen missed but try again.\nAn implement of peace, the fork of the husbandman the sowing\nof the grain a star flower something like a daisy, what does that\nmean 1\n?

The second\nscript repeats the \" open door,\" an idea easily associated with\nSesame, but combines with it \" the closing of the door,\" and\nintroduces the drawing of an anchor 1\n\u2014the usual Sidgwick symbol\nin H.V. script\u2014and of an arrow,\n2\noften used in the Verrall\nscripts to indicate a cross-correspondence. Both arrow and\nanchor connect the H.V. script closely with the Mac script.\nThe anchor occurred throughout their script and had been\ninterpreted as a Sidgwick symbol. This Miss Verrall knew,\nbut as she had not seen the Mac script of September 12, 1908,\nshe did not know that there the allusion to the not unlocked\nDoor was followed by a drawing of an arrow. It looks as if\nthe particular form taken by the reminiscence of Sesame and\nLilies in H.V. script both on Sept. 23 and on Oct. 24 was\ndetermined by the desire of the scribe to repeat the Door\nwhich ought to have been, but was not, recognised as a cross-\ncorrespondence between the Mac and H.V. scripts of September\n12 and 23, 1908.\nIt is tempting to see in the words \" and 4 \" an indication of\nthe number of automatists subsequently found, as will be seen,\nto have references to the \" opening of doors.\" But I think it\nmore likely that the \" and 4 \" is to be combined with the three\nof \" three red roses \" to make seven, and thus to serve, with the\nunmistakable allusions\n\u2014\" circles wheels within wheels \" and the\n\"rainbow\"\u2014to recall\n3\nthe earlier H.V. script of May 11, 1908,\nwhich makes part of the elaborate cross-correspondence on\nSevens'\n1\ndescribed by Miss Johnson (Proc., Vol. XXIV., pp. 222-\n258).

She was told on Nov. 18, 1908, that her\nscript of May 11, 1908, made a cross-correspondence on 'Seven' with Mrs.\nPiper, and she was told on Nov. 20, 1908, that Mrs. Holland's script also came\ninto the series.\n\fLXIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 197\n(3) Mrs. Holland's Script, Nov. 25, 1908.\n....

The extract above\nquoted may be interpreted as follows\n:\nG. P. represents George Pelham, a frequent control, as Mrs.\nHolland knew, in Mrs. Piper's trance. Is \" the other George\n\"\na reference to Mr. George B. Dorr, in whose sittings with Mrs.\nPiper\u2014not known to Mrs. Holland\u2014had appeared the messages\nfor transmission reproduced in the earlier part of this script ?\nThe script then announces that there are \" Five in this.\" If it\nstood alone, this phrase might mean that either five controls\n1\nFor a full account of this script of Mrs. Holland's, and the circumstances\nof its production, see Miss Johnson's paper, pp. 218, \"225.\n\f198 Mrs. A.

But in view of the later statement that the initials\nof five controls are \" another set of fives,\" the first \" five \" must\nbe taken definitely to apply not to controls but to automatists.\nThe notion of five is reiterated throughout the rest of the\nscript ; five divisions in the first drawing, five fingers, five notes\nof the bass clef\u2014this last selection perhaps determined by the\nfact that the first three letters of these notes make the initials\n(unknown to Mrs. Holland) of Mr. Dorr, G.B.D. \u2014five wits,\nfive names of places\n;\n1\nand the script ends with four sets\nof fives, among them being five concentric circles, which recall\nthe \" circles wheels within wheels \" of H.V. script of October 24,\n1908.\nThe only point not thus accounted for is the drawing of a key,\nand it is a fair inference that this key represents the topic with\nwhich the live automatists are concerned. In the H.V. script,\nwith which by its \" concentric circles \" this script is closely\nconnected, there is mention of a door, a door which there is good\nreason to think represents an attempt to emphasize the unnoticed\nDoor of the Mac script. Is it fanciful to see in the key of\nMrs. Holland's script a reproduction of the \" key \" of the Mac\nscript ? The reader will better judge when the sequel has been\nrelated.\nThe scripts of these three automatists are separated by a\nconsiderable interval, more than a year, from the scripts of the\nother two, Mrs. Forbes and Mrs. Willett. Darin\"' that interval\ntwo things occurred which may have a bearing on the problem\nbefore us: (1) a paper on Sesame and Lilies, afterwards published\nas part of a larger paper in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., was read\nby me at a private meeting of the S.P.E. on May IS, 1909,\nand (2) at the end of September, 1909, Sir Oliver Lodge devised\nthe experiment of repeating to Myersw the cpiestion that had\nbeen asked of MyersP by Mr. Dorr. The proposed experiment\nwas communicated to me and to Mr. Piddington, but was not\nknown to any one else till Mrs. Willett opened Sir Oliver\nLodge's envelope on Feb. 4, 1910.

E.G.\nsends this letter, Talbot is the writer.\nMrs. Forbes, though not present at the S.P.E. meeting on\nMay 18, 1909, had heard from me in August a brief outline of\nthe Sesame and Lilies incident, and her interest in it may be\nreflected in the reference in her script to \" openings of doors.\"\nHere, again, however, as in the case of my daughter's script,\nthe choice of the particular phrase may have been determined by\nthe communicator's desire to emphasize the word Door, of which\nwe had failed to recognize the importance in the Mac script. But\nMrs. Forbes's knowledge or interest does not account for the\nintroduction into her script of Sir Oliver Lodge's name, whicli\nMrs. Forbes had no reason to connect with Sesame or with\nDorr or Doors, open or closed. When I received this script\nI saw a point in the openings of doors, but none in the intro-\nduction of Sir Oliver Lodge's name either on this occasion or\nwhen it occurred again in Mrs. Forbes's script of February 6,\n1910.\nBetween these two scripts of Mrs. Forbes came Mrs. Willett's\nscripts of February 4 and 5, 1910:\n(5) Mrs. IVilletis script.\nFebruary If, 1910.\n... Go not to Lethe. Myers. Myers. There was the door to\nwhich I found no key and Haggi Babba too. This is disconnected\nbut not meaningless.\nFebruary 5, 1910.\n. . . Tell Lodge this word Myers. Myers get the word I will\nspell it Myers yes the word is D 0 R R.\nWe are only concerned here with the form in which Myersw\nindicated to Sir Oliver Lodge that one of the associations which\nthe word Lethe had for him was the name Dorr. The allusion\nto that name on February 4, 1910, is made in two sentences\n\f200 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\njoined by the word \" and.\" Have these two sentences any special\npoint ? Do they contribute anything to the problem before us ?\nThe first sentence introduces in a quotation from Omar\nKhayyam the two words '\nDoor ' and '\nKey.' Each of these\nsingly had occurred in interconnected scripts\u2014Door in Miss\nVerrall's script (seen by Mrs. Willett), and Key in Mrs. Holland's\n(not seen by Mrs. Willett). Both words had been used together\nin the earlier Mac script of September 12, 1 908, with which\nnone of the three automatists was acquainted.\nThe second sentence, \" Haggi Babba too \" doubtless alludes to\n\" open Sesame,\" the magic formula of Ali Baba in one of the\ntales of the Arabian Nights Entertainments. This story was\nknown to Mrs. Willett in childhood, and was probably recalled\nby her reading of Buskin's Sesame and Lilies 1\nin the summer\nof 1909, as well as by the H.V. script of September 23, 1908,\nwhich she had seen in the spring of 1909. By the word \"too,\"\nMyersw in this second sentence definitely links (a) the group\nof allusions to Sesame (Haggi Babba) with (b) the idea of a\ndoor without a key. This is precisely what I had failed to\ndo when I read the sentence in the Mac script about a \" key\nthat unlocks the DOOB.,\" though I now have no doubt that\nthose words did form part of the group of allusions to Sesame\nin the Mac script.\nThe first sentence, then, in Mrs. Willett's script gives evidence\nof supernormal knowledge of the Mac script, and does this by\nmeans of a quotation appropriate in a series of associations\nwith Lethe, if among those associations are present the Vir-\ngiliaii and Blatonic passages of the Sixth JEneicl and the Tenth\nBook of the Republic.\nFor those who are not familiar with Omar Khayyam, I\nrecall the context of Mrs. Willett's quotation. The poet sums\nup the results of the learned studies of his youth as telling\nhim no more than that\n\"I came like Water and like Wind I go.\nInto this Universe and why not knowing\nNor whence like Water willy nilly flowing:\nAnd out of it, as Wind along the Waste,\nI know not whither willy nilly blowing.\"\n1\nSee Sesame, \u00a7 50.\n\fLXIII.] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 201\nEven when, like Mahomet 1\nbefore him, he passed \"Up from\nEarth's Centre through the Seventh Gate \" of the Planets to\nthe Empyrean, he could not unravel \" the Knot of Human Death\nand Eate.\"\n\"There was a door to which I found no key.\"\nThis passage of the Bvbaiyat is based upon Neo-Platonism L>\nand so goes ultimately back to Plato's story of the Vision of Er\n{Republic, X.), who in his trance passed by the seven whorls of\nthe Planets in his journey to the Plain of Lethe and the\nKiver of Forgetfulness. And it is the problem of Human\nDeath and Fate which Virgil treats in the speech of Anchises to\niEneas and the Sibyl by the \" Lethean stream.\"\nThus, on February 4 and 5, 1910, Myersw completed the\ncross-correspondence begun in the Mac script of September 12,\n1908, and the next day, February 6, that completion was\nannounced in a script of Mrs. Forbes. The first part of this\nscript, in looking-glass writing, was apparently addressed to me\n;\nit was followed by a message in ordinary writing to Mrs. Forbes\nherself telling her to send the first message to me.\n(6) Mrs. Forbes's script, Feb. 6, 1910.\n{Looking-glass writing.\n)\nOliver Lodge will be glad to know the key we send it to o\n\u2014\n3\nbe sure it will be opened by the seeker.

After it ended with the answer of Myersw\nto Sir Oliver Lodge's question, GurneyF and Talbot Forbes\nwrote \" Oliver Lodge will be glad to know the key ... be\nsure it will be opened by the seeker.\"\n\" It \" was not, however, \" opened \" for some time after this.\nThe connexion between the quotation from Omar Khayyam in\nMrs. Willett's script on February 4 and the name Dorr in her\nscript of February 5 was not perceived till after two further\nallusions to the subject 2\nby Myersw. Fven after the detection\nof the pun of Myersw, the cross-correspondence with other auto-\nmatists on the word \" Door \" remained undetected for some little\nwhile, as no one person possessed the whole information required\nfor its apprehension. Some points had been observed and noted ;\nthe connexion, for instance, of Mrs. Forbes's script with the cross-\ncorrespondence on \" Sesame and Lilies,\" and in particular with\nMiss Verrall's scripts of September 23 and October 24, 1908,\nwas perceived by me when I received Mrs. Forbes's script. But\nI had at that time no knowledge either of Mrs. Willett's script\nor of Mrs. Holland's, and Miss Johnson, who knew Mrs. Holland's\nscript, did not see the Mac script of September 12, 1908, with\nits emphasised \" DOOR,\" till October, 1910.

But she did not know that its\nappearance there re-echoed an earlier emergence in the course\nof some experiments in table-tilting between my daughter and\nher cousin, Mrs. Eiviere, and that it had thus been recognised\nas the subject of cross-correspondence between other automatists.1\n(30) (31) Plato's \"Phaeclo.\"\nHere follow a group of six sentences, including two proper\nnames, and four phrases easily associated with Lethe as the\nWater of Forgetfulness. Can any explanation be offered for\nthe particular selection of associations here made ?\nThe first phrase (30), the Draught of Forgetfulness, stand-\ning alone, could not be claimed as specifically applicable to\nanything in particular. The words are little more than a\nparaphrase for the Waters of Lethe. But followed as they are\nby the name Anaxagoras, to a classical scholar they can recall\nonly one draught of forgetfulness\u2014the cup of hemlock drunk\nby Socrates. Students of Plato will remember the effect on\nthe development of Socrates' philosophy produced by the writings\nof Anaxagoras, as described in two chapters (46, 47) of the\nPhaeclo,\u2014two chapters, be it noted, which do not form part\nof the \" concluding chapters \" of the Phaeclo of which Mrs.\nWillett had once read a translation. 2\nIn a mind feeling after associations with the word Lethe,\nwhich has already produced an allusion to Keats's Nightingale,\nthe \" drowsy numbness ... as though of hemlock I had drunk,\"\nmay easily have led on to the thought of the hemlock drunk by\nSocrates, the draught, as Myers w later called it, of deliverance.\nBut I fail to account by any normal associations of Mrs. Willett's\nfor the introduction into the script of the name of the great\npredecessor of Socrates, Anaxagoras, accused like Socrates himself\nof impiety against the gods.3\n1\nA paper on this subject was read by me at the meeting of the S.P.R.\non Dec. 8, 1910, and will be published later in Proceedings.\n2\nSee above, p. 165.\n3\nIn conjunction with this, the reader is reminded that later references to\nSocrates in Mrs. Willett's script also appear to show more accurate knowledge\nthan would be expected from Mrs. Willett herself.

[part\n(33)-(35) Three Poems of Swinburne's.\nNext follow (33, 34) two reminiscences of Swinburne, both\nassociated with one aspect of Lethe, namely, forgetfulness.\nNeither is an exact quotation, as is recognised in the script,\nbut there is no difficulty in tracing what is intended. The\nfirst words, \" which only I remember which only you forget,\"\nrecall Swinburne's poem of Itylns, where the memory of the\nnightingale and the forgetfulness of the \" sister swallow,\" whom\nshe addresses, are emphasized in almost every verse ;\ne.g. \" Hast\nthou forgotten ere I forget \"\u2014\" Could I forget or thou remember\n\"\n\u2014\" Can I remember if thou forget\u2014But the world shall\nend when I forget.\" 1\nThe second sentence, \" and all dead things go thither, and all\nforgotten days\u2014something like that,\" recalls Swinburne's Garden\nof Proserpine.\n\" There go the loves that wither, . . .\nAnd all dead years draw thither,\nAnd all disastrous things\n;\nDead dreams of days forsaken . .\n.\"\nThus the \" I,\" that alone remembers, is the Nightingale,\nMother of Itylus, and it is to the Garden of Proserpine that\ngo \" all dead years \" and \" dreams of days forsaken.\"\nNow the two words \" Nightingale \" and \" Proserpine \" are\nthe subject of cross-correspondence between other automatists,\nthe one\u2014Proserpine\u2014originating in Mrs. Piper's trance on\nMarch 2 4, 1908, and the other\u2014Nightingale\u2014in Mrs. Holland's\nscript of Nov. 25, 1908. But this script, which originates\nthe cross-correspondence on Nightingale by means of a quotation\nfrom Oscar Wilde's The Burden of Itys, reproduces the Proser-\npine of MyerSp by means of a quotation from Swinburne's\nGeirden of Proserpine, and, as if to show that the conjunction\nis not fortuitous, four months later (nothing having meanwhile\noccurred to draw Mrs. Holland's attention to the subject)\nboth topics are implicitly introduced on March 24, 1909,\nby quotations from two poems of Swinburne's, the Garden of\nProserpine, and the Chorus from Atalanta in Calydon about\n1\nThe rhythm of the quotation recalls another poem of Swinburne's, Rococo, but\nin that poem there is no contrast between the remembrance of one person and the\nforgetfulness of another.\n\fLXIIL] Notes on Mrs. Willett's Scripts. 207\nthe Nightingale and Itylus.

This arrangement is exactly reversed in Mrs. Piper's\ntrance (\/3), where the word Nightingale occurs in a quotation\nfrom one poem of a series whose title\u2014not mentioned\u2014is Echoes.\nTo the Nightingale and to the name Itylus, Mrs. Holland's\nsecond script (7) makes implicit reference.

Mrs. Willett was not acquainted with the poem,\nbut some lines of it are quoted in the Memoir of Henry\nSidgwick (p. 588), which she had read, and the words Super\nFlumina Babylonis appear in an M.V. script of April 12,\n1909, written a few days after Swinburne's death, and seen\nby Mrs. Willett in July, 1909. She had also seen the quota-\ntion from the Psalm, \" By the waters of Babylon,\" in H.V.\nscript of April 29, 1909,4\nbut she did not know that those\nopening words of the Psalm had been employed\" in an earlier\nH.V. script as part of the cross-correspondence between Miss\nVerrall's script and Mrs. Piper's trance on \" Exile and Moore\n\"\n(Proc., Vol. XXIV, p. 187). So that here too, as in the two\npreceding sentences, Mrs. Willett's script selects among phrases\nassociated with Lethe (\" forgetfulness,\" \" water \") one which\n1\nSee p. 159. The main part of my note on the interpretation of Shelley's\nNightingale as the Nightingale of Adonais was marie and communicated to Sir\nOliver Lodge some months before I saw Mrs. Holland's script of November\n25, 1908, or the record of Mrs. Piper's trance on December 9, 1908, and\nbefore I had recognised the allusion to Swinburne's I(>\/lw< in Mrs. Willett's\nscript.\n-That some value was attached by Myersw to the word Nightingale is clear\nfrom the statement on March 7, 1910 (see p. 129), which suggests that the\nfull point of the Nightingale had not yet been perceived.\n3\nThe words \"forget\" and \"remember\" each occur twice in the nine verses\nof the Psalm, vv. 5, 6, 7.\n4\nSee above, p. 186, where the script is quoted.\n5\nThat fact was known to my daughter when her script of April 29, 1909,\nwas produced, and is unmistakably therein alluded to, as is shown by the next\nfollowing word on April 29, \"Exile.\"\nO\n\f210 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nimplicitly refers to a word, Exile, which had heen, without\nMrs. Willett's knowledge, the subject of a cross-correspondence\nbetween other automatists.\nUnder these circumstances I cannot believe it an accident\nthat the three allusions to Swinburne contained in these con-\nsecutive remarks of Myers w should all recall words\u2014Nightingale,\nProserpine, Exile\u2014which, unknown to Mrs. Willett, were already\nthe subjects of cross-correspondence between the trance-utter-\nances of Mrs. Piper and the scripts of other automatists.

That Death and\nSleep are brothers is a commonplace of poetry from Homer 2\nonwards, and no specific allusion can therefore be recognised in\nthis passage to Virgil,\n3\nShelley,\n4\nTennyson,0\nor Frederic Myers.6\nNone of the poets named give Sleep more than one Brother,\nthough Tennyson, it is true, in one section of In Memoriam,\nmakes Sleep \"kinsman\" to death and trance and madness.'\n'See above, p. 162. -\/\/., XIV., 231.\n3\nMneid, VI., 278, \" consanguineus Leti Sopor.\"\n4\nQueen Mab, 1. 2, \"Death, and his brother Sleep.\"\n5\nIn Mem., Ixviii., \"Sleep, Death's twin brother.\" Tennyson's own note here\ngives the reference to the Sixth JEneld, 278.\n6\nFragments, p. 124, \"Oh sleep! thy true twin brother.\"\n7\nThe poem in Fragment* is clearly reminiscent of In Memoriam, and the choice\nof the epithet \"true\" suggests that the brotherhood of sec.

But since the above was written,\nit has been suggested to me that the phrase in the script\nrecalls the lines from Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone\n(quoted on p. 204 of F. W. TL Myers's volume of Essays called\nScience and a Future Life)\n:\n\" Last, as the likeness of a dying man,\nWithout his knowledge, from him flits to warn\nA far-off friendship that he comes no more.\"\nThis therefore may be the source from which it is derived.\nBut that is perhaps only another way of saying that it goes\nultimately back to the passage in Ovid's Metamorphoses which\nit recalled to me. That Tennyson was familiar with the story\nof Proserpine as told in Metamorphoses, V., is clear. He follows\nOvid closely in the details of the disappearance of Proserpine\nand the search by Demeter. But he differs completely from\nOvid in his account of how the news came to the mother\nthat her child was in Hades. In Tennyson's poem, Demeter\nlearns this from a veridical dream, related by Demeter in words\nthat recall another passage in the Metamorphoses, the veridical\ndream by which Alcyone was informed of the death of Ceyx\n(Ovid, Met., XL 646, 660). After the above quoted allusion\nto a '\nphantasm of the living,' Tennyson's Demeter goes on :\n\" So he, the God of dreams, who heard my cry,\nDrew from thyself the likeness of thyself\nWithout thy knowledge, and thy shadow past\nBefore me, crying. ...\"\nSo in the Metamorphoses, Sleep chooses Morpheus, the Dream\nGod, who thereupon flits noiselessly through the darkness, and,\nassuming the likeness of Ceyx, announces himself to Alcyone\nas the shadow of her husband\n\u2014\n\" nosces\ninveniesque tuo pro coniuge coniugis umbram.\"\nDeath than to Trance or Madness.

The first\nthree lines of that poem run :\n\" Oh wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,\nThou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\nAre driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing.\"\nThe first two lines of the Ode offer resemblances with the\nlines of Shelley's other poem quoted in the H.V. script. It\nis possible that these two lines represent the \" quotation\n\"\nwhich the scribe of Feb. 5 wanted \" to say,\" and for which\nthe automatist was to \" wait.\"\n(2) On February 10, 1910, Myersw quotes the first verse\nof Psalm exxxvii., four words of which, \" the waters of\nBabylon,\" occurred in H.V. script of February 5.\n(3) On February 10, 1910, Myersw quotes the words from\nthe epitaph on Keats \" his name was writ in water,\" while\non February 16 the H.V. script applies the three distinctive\nwords \" writ in water \" in a different connexion.1\nAs has been said, Sir Oliver Lodge's question about Lethe\nwould account for the introduction into Mrs. Willett's script of\nphrases containing the word \" water.\" But there was no such\nreason for their introduction into H.V. script. My daughter\nwas altogether unaware that any attempt had been made to\nconnect Myersw and MyersP , that any question had been asked\nof Myersw, or that any particular interest attached to associa-\ntions with Lethe other than those explained in Mr. Piddington's\npaper which she had read at a meeting of the S.P.R. in October,\n1909, when, as far as she was concerned, the Lethe episode was\nconcluded.\n1\nThe words were noted by my daughter at the time as referring to Keats's\nepitaph.\n\f214 Mrs. A.

My latest information\u2014\n=\nat the end of January\u2014was that the envelope had not been\nopened and that Mrs. Willett was not writing automatically.\nThree pieces of script were produced by me in February (Feb. 1,\nFeb. 8, Feb. 9), before the above described allusion to Dante's\nLethe. So that even if we attribute that allusion to my normal\nknowledge that Mrs. Willett had received a cpiestion about\nLethe and would be likely soon to be sitting for script, yet some\nsupernormal connexion between her script and mine is indicated\nby the chronology, as well as by the supplementary character of\nthe allusion in my script, there being, as we have seen, no\nreference whatever to Dante's Lethe in Mrs. Willett's script.\nThis omission in her script is the more remarkable in that Mrs.\nWillett had read with some care Mr. Piddington's Eeport in\nProceedings, Vol. XXII., where much attention is given to Dante's\nPurgatorio in connexion with the cross-correspondence on Light\nin West, and where the words River of Lethe are emphasised\n(p. 268) by appearing in leaded type.\nThat the omission from Mrs. Wiliett's Lethe-scripts of all\nmention of Dante was intentional is made the more likely by the\nfollowing incident, recorded by Mrs. Willett on March 23, 1910,\nand received by Sir Oliver Lodge, who was abroad, on April 7,\nbefore the issue of Proceedings, Part LX., Vol. XXIV., containing\nMr. Piddington's paper on the Lethe incident.\n1\nMrs. Willett relates how she felt an impulse on March 22,\n1910, to look through certain volumes of the Proceedings. 2\nThe\nresult was twofold. The first result showed supernormal\nknowledge, but does not concern us here ; the second is thus\nreported in Mrs. Willett's note :\nThen I felt there was more. . . .

It will no doubt be variously\ninterpreted. It is certain that within the last year Mrs.\nWillett had had two opportunities of learning that Dante\nhad written about Lethe, once when she read\u2014and read\nwith special interest\u2014Ruskin's Sesame and Lilies, with its\neloquent concluding passage comparing Tennyson's Maud with\nDante's \" great Matilda \" by the \" edge of happy Lethe,\" and\nalso when she read Mr. Piddington's Report (Proa, Vol.\nXXII.); so that, had her script included a reference to Dante's\nLethe, we should certainly have counted that allusion as due\nto subliminal memory. It is, however, clear that not all\nMrs. Willett's normal associations with Lethe emerged in the\napparent tangle of her Lethe scripts, and I myself think that\nthere is evidence that this particular omission was not accidental.\nFor not only was there no mention of Dante's Lethe by\nMyersw, but that omission was immediately followed, at\nthe first opportunity,\n1\nby the mention of just that very\n1\nAfter February 10, 1910, no further script was obtained from Myersw till\nMarch 7, 1910.

It is, to my\nmind, another of several signs of intelligent direction shown\nthroughout the series of incidents which culminated with Mrs.\nWiilett's script of February, 1910.

[part\nIII.\nTHIRD REPORT ON MRS. HOLLAND'S SCRIPT.\nBy ALICE JOHNSON.\nIntroduction.\nThis paper is concerned primarily with certain cross-corre-\nspondences between Mrs. Holland's script and that of Mrs.\nPiper produced some months earlier, namely, during her 21\nsittings with Mr. Dorr from March 9 to May 26, 1908, which\nwere reported in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., Part LX., published\nin April, 1910.\nIt happened that Mrs. Holland produced only two pieces of\nscript (on March 4 and 10, 1908,) during the period of Mrs.\nPiper's sittings, and neither of these contains anything connected\nwith the sittings. Her next script, dated July 23, 1908, is\nconcerned with the important cross-correspondence of Sevens\ndealt with in my Second Report on her automatic writing\n(Proceedmtjs, Vol. XXIV. p. 238). After that she wrote\nnothing more until Nov. 25, 1908,\n1\nwhen she began again\nto write regularly, that is as a rule once a week.\nThe prelude to this period was my interview with Mrs.\nHolland on Nov. 24, 1908 (see my Second Report, op. cit. p. 241),\nwhen 1 ^ave her a short account of the main points in the\ncross-correspondence of Sevens, mentioning that Mrs. Piper had\nbeen having sittings with an acquaintance of ours in America,\nand had given the phrase \" We are seven.\" Mrs. Holland\nwas much interested in hearing of this case, and it seems\nprobable that her talk with me about it stimulated her\nautomatic faculty into fresh activity. The contents of her\n1\nExcept a piece of script produced in my presence on Nov. 24, 1908, and\nnot dealt with here.\n\flxiil] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 219\nwriting, however, cannot be thus accounted for, since I had\nnot mentioned Mr. Dorr's name, nor said anything about any\nof the other topics of the Piper sittings, of which I then\nknew very little. Yet Mrs. Holland's script on the following\nday (discussed in detail below) referred to \" the other George\n\u2014\nnot G. P.,\" and soon after gave the letters \" G.B.D.F.A.,\" 1\nthe\nfirst three of which are the initials of Mr. Dorr's name.\nI saw her again on Nov. 28, 1908, and went over this\nscript with her. She told me the sources of some of the\nquotations in it, and pointed out that the letters were the five\nlines of the bass clef. I told her that the first three of them\nwere also the initials of a person known to me (without\nmentioning his connexion with Mrs. Piper), but that I thought\nher interpretation was probably the correct one. I said nothing\nof the cross-correspondences contained in the script, since I\ndid not discover them till some months later.\nMeanwhile I had on Oct. 20, 1908, sent her Vol. XXII.\nof the Proceedings, containing Mr. Piddington's report of the\nPiper sittings in England, 1900-1907; and she had already\nseen the first report on Mrs. Verrall's automatic writing\n{Proceedings, Vol. XX.), as well as my first report on her\nown script in Ar\nol. XXI. Her knowledge of all these matters\nmust be borne in mind in considering the script of this later\nperiod.\nPossible Telepathy from the Investigators.\nIt is also to be noted that these cross-correspondences did\nnot occur in Mrs. Holland's script until after Mrs. Verrall\nknew of the occurrence of the topics in Mrs. Piper's trance.\nMrs. Verrall knew nothing about Mrs. Piper's sittings at the\ntime they were taking place ; but after they were completed\nthe records were sent to England and were put into her\nhands for study in October, 1908. Similarly Mrs. Holland's\n\" Sevens \" script, and her \" Sesame and Lilies\n\"\n2\nscripts were\nproduced after Mrs. Verrall knew of the occurrence of those\ntopics in the scripts of other automatists.\nMrs. Sidgwick, Mr. G. W.

[part\nagents in this case, for they too were engaged in studying\nthe Piper records during part of the period that Mrs.\nHolland was producing these scripts, Mrs. Sidgwick having\nread the records both before and after Mrs. Verrall, Mr. Balfour\nnext, and Mr. Piddington beginning his work on them about\nFeb. 10, 1 909. Some slight evidence for telepathy from\nMrs. Sidgwick and Mr. Piddington to Mrs. Piper in trance\nis, I think, to be found in his report on the English sittings\nof 190G-7, the strongest case being that of the \"Steeple\"\nincident {Proceedings, Vol. XXII. pp. 38-46), when the word\n\" Steeple \" was given in the Piper script a few days after Mr.\nPiddington dreamt or imagined that I had told him it formed\nthe subject of a cross-correspondence in some other scripts.\nIt is to be noted, however, that he had told Mrs. Verrall of\nthis before the word came out in the Piper script.\nSimilarly there are a few cases (see especially \" Comus \" and\n\"Shelley's Skylark\" below, pp. 253 and 272) where a subject\nsuggested by Mr. Dorr to Mrs. Piper in trance is reproduced\nin Mrs. Holland's script, and where, therefore, it is conceivable\nthat Mr. Dorr may have exercised some telepathic influence\non Mrs. Holland. There is, however, no evidence for telepathy\nfrom Mr. Dorr apart from Mrs. Piper ; no reference to him\nbeing made in the Holland script except in connexion with\nthe Piper sittings.\nThe general question of what influence may be exercised on\nthe automatists by telepathy from one another is deferred to\nthe theoretical discussion at the end of this paper. I merely\nnote here what persons may, through their normal know-\nledge of the Piper records, be regarded as possible telepathic\nagents in relation to Mrs. Holland.\nFrom Nov. 25, 1908, to May 19, 1909, Mrs. Holland\nproduced twenty-two pieces of script. Three of these con-\ntained contributions to the Sesame and Lilies cross-correspond-\nence, and were quoted in Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. pp. 319-326;\nten are quoted in connection with other cross-correspondences\nbelow. Two later ones, carrying on the cross-correspondence\nProserpine, are added.\nIt will be seen that other automatists besides Mrs. Piper,\nin particular Miss Arerrall, are also concerned in these cross-\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 221\ncorrespondences, while connexions are further shown with\nsome later American sittings with Mrs. Piper, Dec, 1908,\u2014\nMarch, 1909, four of which were held by Mr. Dorr and six\nby Miss Theodate Pope, a friend of Dr. Hodgson's and a\nmember of the Society, who has had a long experience\nof Mrs. Piper's trance phenomena, and who kindly under-\ntook to continue Mr. Dorr's experiments.\nFinally, some of the cross-correspondences reappear in Mrs.\nWillett's scripts of Feb., 1910, reported in Sir Oliver Lodge's\npaper above, which were linked up with the Piper sittings\nby his question, put to Myersw,\n\" What does the word Lethe\nsuggest to you ?\n\"\nFor the convenience of the reader I insert overleaf a tabular\nlist of the cross-correspondences, arranged in the order of their\nemergence in Mrs. Holland's script, with the dates on which\nthe same topics occurred in the scripts of other automatists.\nThe Question of Chance Coincidence.\nThe first thing to strike the eye in this table is the long\nperiods of time over which several of the topics are distributed\namong the automatists, and this at once raises the question\nwhether some of the cross-correspondences may not be due to\nchance.\nThe mere probability that the same word or phrase may\noccur through chance alone in two given scripts by two\ndifferent writers is the same, whether the two scripts were\nproduced on the same day, or with an interval of a hundred\nyears between them. But that they should be contemporaneous\nadds another and a very important factor to the coincidence.\nAnd when we try to determine whether the coincidence is\ndue to telepathy (either from incarnate or from discarnate\nminds), a fresh element is introduced into the argument.; for,\nsince we must suppose the contact between two minds which\nconstitutes telepathy to take place at a certain time, it would\nbe much more reasonable to attribute a coincidence between\ntwo scripts to telepathy if they were produced on the same\nday than if there was a long interval between them.\nOn the other hand, the scripts merely record the emergence\nof some of the subliminal impressions of the automatists, and\n\fett.\n1910 1910 1910 1910 1910\no\nOS \" -\nWill\no\"\ni\u2014i i\u2014\ni\nMrs.\nFeb. ^ J Feb.\nMar.\nFeb.\nFeb.'

[part\nthese impressions may not be recorded until some time after\nthey arise ;\nwhile, again, the transmission (from whatever\nsource) to the second automatist may not take place until some\ntime after the first record has been made. Thus there may\nbe a real telepathic connexion between two scripts, in spite of\ntheir production at different dates.\n1\nBut since the only ascer-\ntainable dates are those of their production, it is obvious that\nthe strength of the evidence for a telepathic connexion depends\n\u2014partly at least\u2014on the shortness of the interval between the\ndates.\nIt depends also, of course, on the number and degree of\nthe coincidences in proportion to the total amount of script.\nIn cases of this type, however, no exact calculation of prob-\nabilities can be made, since the data are not only indeterminate\nin number,\u2014it may sometimes be a matter of opinion whether\na coincidence should count as such or not,\u2014but they are also\nincommensurable in value. We can only judge roughly by a\ncommon sense estimate whether the total amount of coincidence\nis decidedly more than we should expect to occur by chance.\nThe argument is of the same kind as those used in discussing\nmany literary questions. For instance, it is believed that Shake-\nspeare drew his materials for Julius Caesar from North's translation\nof Plutarch's Lives on account of the numerous resemblances in\nthe plot, characters, etc. ; and evidence in such a case, while\nit can never be made mathematically demonstrable, may be\nmore than enough to satisfy the reasonable requirements of\nscholars. For this conclusion, the study of Julius Caesar alone\nmay suffice ; it would not be necessary to analyse all the\nworks of Shakespeare in order to estimate what proportion\nthe coincidences with North's Plutarch bore to Shakespeare's\nwhole output. Similarly it is possible, I think, for readers of\nthe Proceedings to judge whether the cross-correspondences there\nrecorded are beyond what can reasonably be attributed to\nchance, without reference to the unpublished portions of the\nscripts.\nI have explained above that Mrs. Holland was practically\n1\nIt is noteworthy that when a statement is made in one script as to the\noccurrence of a topic in the script of another automatist, if any time is\nmentioned, it is generally stated incorrectly. Several instances of this are\ngiven below.\n\fLXIII.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 225\nproducing no script during the first and main batch of the\nPiper sittings in question, so that contemporary correspondences\ncould not have occurred. But in my view the total bulk\nof coincidence between her scripts of Nov. 25, 1908, to\nMay 19, 1909, and the Piper scripts of the period March\n9 to May 26, 1908, as shown in the detailed record below,\nis too great to be reasonably ascribed to chance.\nThe same principles of reasoning apply to cases where a topic\nrecurs several times in different scripts by the same automatist.\nThese too are coincidences which may or may not be due to\nchance ; that is, the topic may have been mentioned inde-\npendently on different occasions, or the later mentions may\nbe connected with the first. If the topic is associated with\nthe same phrase or the same idea more than once, or if the\nsecond mention follows closely on the first, it is probable\nthat the two are causally connected. Thus, in the complicated\ncross-correspondence of Proserpine (No. -1 below) Proserpine is\nreferred to four times in Miss Verrall's script ; the first two\nreferences coming so close together that they seem to form\nparts of one allusion. On the other hand the third and\nfourth references are less obviously connected with the first\ntwo.\nProserpine is also referred to four times in Mrs. Holland's\nscript. On the last occasion (Mar. 2, 1910), the same quota-\ntion is repeated as on the first occasion (Nov. 25, 1908),\nwhich seems a link between the two. But the last occasion\nis near in point of time to Mrs. Willett's allusion to Pro-\nserpine (on Feb. 10, 1910), which is linked with Mrs.\nHolland's first script by the fact that in the writing of both\nautomatists the Nightingale is referred to, as well as Proserpine.\nThis to my mind points to the conclusion that none of these\ncoincidences is due to chance alone, but that Mrs. Holland's\nscripts are linked to one another by memory, and to Mrs.\nWillett's by telepathy (whether through the agency of an\nincarnate or of a discarnate mind).\nIn considering the question of chance coincidence, it has\nalso to be noted that when a number of cross-correspondences\noccur in one piece of script, the probability that they are due\nto something beyond chance is greatly increased. Thus Mrs.\nHolland's script of Nov. 25, 1908, contains five. The first of\np\n\f2-2(1 Alice Johnson. [part\nthese, \" Convolvulus and shell,\" is weak, taken alone, but the\npresence of four others in the same script strengthens it.\nAgain, \"Confirmation\" (No. 10, on Dec. 30, 1908) is a weak\none, taken alone, and in any case may, I think, be attributed\nto chance, and I only quote it to complete the record of the\nscript in which it occurs.\nAgain, when several cross-correspondences in a single script\nappear in another single script by a different automatist, written\nat a different time, the improbability that these coincidences\nare due to chance is very great. Thus Mrs. Willett's script\nof Feb. 10, 1910 (see table) refers to three cross-correspond-\nences\n\u2014\" Echo.\" \" Nightingale,\" and \" Proserpine \"\n\u2014that appear\nin Mrs. Holland's script of Nov. 25, 1908, while the latter\nscript contains also the cross-correspondence \" Door ( = Dorr)\nKey,\" which reaches its climax in Mrs. Willett's scripts of\nFeb. 4 and 5, 1910 (see Mrs. Verrall's paper above, pp. 193\u2014\n204). The combination of all these seems to me far beyond\nwhat can reasonably be attributed to chance.\nA few more specific facts may be given, bearing on this\nquestion.\nClassical Allusions in Mrs. Holland's Script.\nThe reports of Mr. J lorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper in\nProceedings, Part LX., show that\u2014in consequence of his\ndeliberate plans of experiment with her\u2014her trance utterances\nduring those sittings were full of classical allusions. Now\nseveral of the cross-correspondences here dealt with are con-\ncerned with classical topics. These had hitherto been com-\nparatively rare in Mrs. Holland's script, though references to\nliterary subjects in general are very frequent. Since April,\n190G, Mrs. Holland has been aware that Mrs. Verrall's script\ncontains a good deal of Latin and Greek, and it might be\nsupposed that this knowledge would have influenced her\nsubliminally to refer to classical subjects. But the whole of\nher script from the beginning of 1905 to the end of July,\n1908, which consists of 160 pieces of writing, contains only\ntwenty-two references to such subjects, i.e. on an average, one\nreference in seven scripts. On the other hand, in the period\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 227\nnow under consideration (Nov. 25, 1908, to May 19, 1909)\nshe produced twenty-two pieces of script, in which seventeen\nclassical references are to be found, that is, on an average,\nmore than two references in every three scripts. The refer-\nences are thus more than five times as numerous during this\nperiod as they were before. The following is a complete list\nof them :\n(1) Nov. 25, 1908. Quotation from The Burden of Itys.\n(2) \u201e \" Sweet Echo, fairest nymph.\"\n(3) \u201e Quotation from The Garden of Proserpine.\n(4) Dec. 30, 190S.

The details of these subjects mentioned in Mrs.\nHolland's script were no doubt all familiar to her, except in\nthe cases of the \" Charonic staircase \" and of the quotation from\nOvid (see below, pp. 246-50). But the present paper deals\nmainly with the evidence for supernormal connexion between\nMrs. Holland's scripts and the scripts or trance-utterances of\nother automatists,\u2014evidence which is not affected, one way or\nthe other, by the question of whether the knowledge shown in\n\fLXTIL] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 229\nany individual trance utterance or script has or has not been\nnormally acquired.\nI now give the cross-correspondences in detail, in the chrono-\nlogical order of their appearance in Mrs. Holland's script.\nCkoss-Correspondences.\n(1) Convolvulus and Shed.\n(2) Echo and Narcissus.\n(3) The Nightingale.\n(4) Proserpine.\nThese topics are contained in Mrs. Holland's script of\nNovember 25th, 1908, as follows:\n\u2014\n\" Then an octave struck the answer.\" 1\nMake no mistake.\n(1)- Curling wreaths of smoke that take fantastic forms\n\u2014\nConvolutions.

[part\n(1) Convolvulus and Shell.\nThe first part of the above script seems to reflect some\ntopics occurring in two consecutive scripts of Miss Verrall's,\nproduced three or four weeks earlier, viz.:\n(October 30th, 1908.)\nThe blue flowers were periwinkles.\nA mossy bank beside the stream\nand convolvulus too.\nF. W. H. Myers.\n(November 4th, 1908).\nNo you grow confused wait. A round shell hold it to your\near the sound of the sea a network of lines over the\nsurface.\nThe bluebells that was the other clue. Put them together.\nI interpret this as meaning that the convolvulus suggests\nsomething rather similar to itself (since both are of spiral\nhabit), namely, a shell in which one may hear the murmuring\nsound that is supposed to be an echo of the sea-waves.\n\" Periwinkle,\" in the first script, is also a shell, as well as a\nflower.\nThe same association of ideas appears in Mrs. Holland's\nscript : convolutions\u2014convolvulus or morning glory\u2014fragile\nbells, blue and purple, the form of which suggests the\n\" wreathed shell,\" which in turn leads on to the \" echoing\nrepeating sound \" to be heard in it.\n1\n1\nThe association between the flower and the shell is perhaps derived from\nWordsworth's lines :\n\" I have seen\nA curious child, who dwelt upon a tract\nOf inland ground, applying to his ear\nThe convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell,\nTo which, in silence hushed, his very soul\nListened intently.\"\n( The Excursion, Book IV.\n)\n\flxiil] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 231\n(2) Echo and Narcissus; and (3) The Nightingale.\nMrs. Holland's quotation from The Burden of Itys is the\nfirst line of one verse, the whole of which is as follows\n:\n\" O Memory cast down thy wreathed shell\n!\nBreak thy hoarse lute O sad Melpomene !\n0 Sorrow, Sorrow keep thy cloistered cell\nNor dim with tears this limpid Castaly !\nCease, Philomel, thou dost the forest wrong\nTo vex its sylvan quiet with such wild impassioned song\n!\n\"\nItys (or Itylus) was the son of Zethos and Aedon; the\nlatter laid a plot to kill her sister-in-law Niobe's son, and\nkilled her own son by mistake. Being pursued by her husband,\nshe was turned into a nightingale {Greek, ayScov). According\nto another version of the legend, Itys was the son of Tereus\nand Procne. Tereus, having fallen in love with Procne's sister\nPhilomela, deserted Procne, who avenged herself by killing\nItys and serving him up at his father's table. Tereus pursued\nProcne and Philomela, who were changed into a nightingale\nand a swallow, or a swallow and a nightingale, respectively.\nIn Oscar Wilde's poem (as in Swinburne's Atcdanta in Cedydon\nand Itylus) it is the nightingale who is the mother of Itys.\nThe chief idea then that is implicit in this quotation made\nby the script is the Nightingale ;\ncf. Miss Pope's sitting below.\nMrs. Holland told me the source of the quotation, and\nafterwards wrote out for me the whole verse from memory.\nBut I found that her version was not quite correct ; instead of\n\" 0 Sorrow, Sorrow,\" she wrote \" 0 Echo, Echo.\" Thus the\nwords Shell and Echo are prominent in her version, and it was\nperhaps this combination that suggested to her the next\nquotation from Comus, which contains the same two wordy.\nIt is the first line of the song sung by the Lady, when\nlost in the forest, to attract her two wandering brothers :\n\"Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen\nWithin thy airy shell\nBy slow Meander's margent green,\nAnd in the violet-embroidered vale\nWhere the love-lorn nightingale\nNightly to thee her sad song mourneth well\n:\nCanst thou not tell me of a gentle pair\nThat likest thy Narcissus are 1\n\"\n\f232 Alice Johnson.

That MyersP should say\nthat the cave of Aeolus suggested Proserpine to him seems,\ntherefore,\u2014especially when combined with various incidents given\nby Mrs. Verrall in her paper on these sittings in Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV.,\u2014to indicate an intimate knowledge of the Aencicl\non his part.\nIt will be seen that the trance-personality returned to the\nsubject of Proserpine twice more during the sitting, in spite of\nMr. Dorr's attempts to lead it off on to other lines. The story\nof Proserpine is clearly, though somewhat indirectly, indicated :\n\" Juno's child\u2014Goddess\u2014Niobe.\" Here the train of thought\nseems to be :\n\" Proserpine\u2014Juno's child\u2014No, the child of\nanother goddess\u2014a goddess who was a bereaved mother,\" which\nleads on to the other classical example of a bereaved mother,\n\u2014\nNiobe. The words \" Spring upward\u2014Child \u2014where her feet\ntrod\u2014flowers \" seem to relate to the return of Proserpine in\nthe spring and suggest reminiscences of the following passage\nin Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone 1\n(another reminiscence\n1\nIt will be remembered that Demeter and Persephone are the Greek names of\nCeres and Proserpine.\n\f236 Alice Johnson.

Flower and fruit red.\nHere the Latin words, followed by the Homeric phrase\n\" fence of the teeth,\" suggest the guardianship of Hades. In\nthat case, the \" guardian on the threshold \" would be the\nthree-headed dog, Cerberus, to whom the words \" fence of the\nteeth,\" are especially appropriate, for his snarl and bark are\nalways emphasised. \" In books is wisdom, who seeks shall\nfind \" seems to mean that the reference is to some literary\ntopic.\n\" Beneath the threshold who ?\n\" 4\nmay refer to Proserpine, the\ngoddess of the infernal regions. There is at any rate no doubt\nthat Proserpine is the goddess with the pomegranate flower or\nfruit. The allusion to Proserpine, then, is the clearest point\nin this script.\nThe following allusions to Proserpine occur in Miss Verrall's\nscript, produced in ignorance of her mother's, just quoted :\n(Sep. 10, 190S).\nA cup a white cup a flower I think she holds it in her\nhand [In Latin : a true goddess]. 5\n[Drawing of flower]\n1\nSee Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. pp. 264 and 311.\n2\nIt may be worth noting that this is the only allusion to Proserpine in\n\u2022282 scripts by Mrs. Verrall, covering a period of nearly four years.\n3\nCustos in limine\u2014sed sub limine quis ?\n4\nIt is possible that the words \"sed sub limine quis?\" are also intended to\nconvey a pun on the word subliminal, meaning \"Who do you suppose directs\nyour subliminal activity ?\n\"\n5\nDea vera, i.e. Venus (Virgil, JZn.

She had, however, taken\na pomegranate 3\nand eaten seven of its seeds ; but in spite of\nthis was permitted to return to the earth every spring, though\nshe had to go back to Hades for part of every year.\nThe \" cap of liberty \" and \" flaming torch \" of the first part\nof the script almost certainly refer to Proserpine too ; the \" cap\nof liberty \" is the pileum, the characteristic head-covering of\nMercury, or Hermes. In the representations of Proserpine's\n\"Eetum,\" she is usually led by Hermes, wearing this cap. The\n\" torch \" is associated with underworld goddesses in general, and\nin this particular case may refer to the torches lit at Mount\nEtna by Ceres, who carried one in each hand when she set\nout to search for her daughter Proserpine.\nEeturning now to the allusion to Proserpine in Mrs.\nHolland's script of Nov. 25, 190S (see above, p. 229), we\nsee that her quotation with its context follows closely the\n1\nev (pdi\/itvois (Homer, Od.

Mrs. Verrall, \" A\nguardian on the threshold, but beneath the threshold who ?\nAnd yet the words are guarded with the fence of the teeth \")\nseems to link on this cross-correspondence with the elaborate\none formed by a pun on the name of Mr. Dorr (\" Door-Key,\"\nsee Mrs. Verrall's paper above, p. 193) Mrs. Holland's con-\ntribution to which occurs in this same script.\nPROSERPINE : CONTINUED.\nThe next script to be quoted refers only to Dis (Pluto), and\nnot to Proserpine ; but I include it under this topic because I\nbelieve that the reference\u2014like some of Mrs. Piper's references\nto Proserpine\u2014is derived from Tennyson's Derneter and Per-\nsephone.

In both the chariot and\nhorses of Dis are connected\u2014by a not unnatural association\nof ideas\u2014with the horses of the Sun ; but while Miss Verrall's\nscript speaks of \" the horses of dawn,\" Mrs. Holland's are those\nof the setting sun.\nThis carrying on, or recrudescence, of the topic of Proserpine,\nmust be considered in connexion with its emergence in Mrs.\nWillett's script of February 10, 1910, in which script, as\nalready remarked, we find that a number of the cross-corre-\nspondences involved in Mrs. Holland's script of Nov. 25, 1908,\nare\u2014so to speak\u2014gathered together and focussed,\u2014namely,\nEcho (implicitly, see Sir Oliver Lodge's paper above, p. 159,\nand Mrs. Verrall's paper, pp. 208-9), the Nightingale and Pro-\nserpine. The whole script is given by Sir Oliver Lodge (see\nabove, pp. 148-50); I quote here the passages relating to the\ntwo latter cross-correspondences\n:\n(The Nigldingale).\nThe Nightingale hut but I no no no\nbegin again\nThe nightin Nightingale but Shelley\ntoo as well\nOnce more ye Laurels\nWhich only 1 remember\nwhich only you forget\n(Proserpine).\nThere is a line of Swinburne's I want\nthat Pagan singer of fair things\nand all dead things go thither\n\flxiil] Third Re-port on Mrs. Holland's Script. 245\nand all forgotten days\nsomething like that Swinburne\nSleep the dream that flits by night\nSleep and his twin Brothers\nnot Brothers single Brother\nThe above references to the Nightingale and Shelley were\ninterpreted by Mrs. Verrall (see above, p. 159) as alluding to\nShelley's poem Aclonais, Stanza xvii., an interpretation which\nseems to me sound ; and Mrs. Verrall remarks that the\ntwo preceding stanzas refer to Echo and Narcissus, which are\nthus linked with the Nightingale in this poem, as in the two\npoems quoted by Mrs. Holland on Nov. 25, 1908, and in\nthe one quoted by Mrs. Piper on Dec. 9, 1908 (see above,\npp. 229 and 233).\nThe next phrase in Mrs. Willett's script,\n\" Which only I remember\nWhich only you forget\n\"\nis a reminiscence of the refrain in Swinburne's Itylus, whereas\nItylus is also referred to in the passage from Atalanta in\nCalydon, quoted by Mrs. Holland on March 24, 1909. It is\ninteresting to note that the phrase seems re-echoed in Mrs.\nHolland's script of Feb. 16, 1910, which begins:\nI shall remember while the light lives yet\nAnd in the darkness I shall not forget.\nMrs. Willett's phrase,\n\" And all dead things go thither\nAnd all forgotten days\n\"\nis misquoted from The Garden of Proserpine (see Mrs. Verrall's\npaper, p. 206); while \"the dream that flits by night\" seems\n(see above, p. 240 and also Mrs. Verrall's paper, p. 211) to be\na reminiscence of Tennyson's Demeter and Persephone.\nThese topics are reiterated in Mrs. Willett's script of\nMarch 7, 1910 :\nl\nWrite again the Nightingale\nI want that seen to\nPluto not not Plato this time, but PLUTO\nBees Bees the hum of Bees\n1\nFor the context of this, see Sir Oliver Lodge's paper above, p. 129.\n\f246 Alice Johnson. [PART\nPluto (Dis) here is perhaps primarily associated with Lethe,\nthe main topic of these Willett scripts, but is also of course\nclosely connected with Proserpine,\n1\nwith whom the Holland\nscript of March 2, 1910, associates bee-plants (see below) and Dis.\nThe association of the Nightingale with Proserpine both in\nthe Holland and Willett scripts indicates an additional tele-\npathic link between them, for the two topics are by no\nmeans necessarily associated together,\u2014in the same way that\ne.g. Ceres and Proserpine would be,\u2014and I do not think\nthey are often found together in literature. They are, however,\nassociated in the following passage from Tennyson's Demeter and\nPersephone, which seems to have been the source of certain phrases\nin Mrs. Holland's script of Nov. 10, 1909 (see p. 241):\n\" Thou earnest, 0 my child,\nLed upward by the God of ghosts and dreams,\nWho laid thee at Eleusis, dazed and dumb,\nWith passing thro' at once from state to state,\nUntil I brought thee hither, that the day,\nWhen here thy hands let fall the gather'd flower,\nMight break thro' clouded memories once again\nOn thy lost self.

Here Ovid describes the flowers which Proser-\npine and her companions pick, and Mrs. Holland's words come\nstraight out of this (Paley's text, 11. 440-442) :\n\"Pars thyma, pars rorem, pars meliloton amant.\nPlurima lecta rosa est, sunt et sine nomine flores.\nIpsa crocos tenues, liliaque alba legit.\"\n(Some prefer thyme, some rosemaiy, some melilote : many a rose\nis plucked, and there are, too, flowers unnamed. She herself\n[i.e. Proserpine] picks slender crocuses and white lilies.)\nShe has substituted for rorem the word casiam\u2014which is closely\nassociated with it in Virgil (Georg. II. 213), both being food for\nbees\u2014and she has written \" melifontos \" for \" meliloton \" (it is a kind\nof clover). She has omitted the flowers named in the preceding\n11. 437-439, viz. : buttercups, violets, poppies, hyacinths, amaranth.\nI can't help feeling a possible connexion with my article pub-\nlished in the Classical Review on March 1, 1910. But the connexion\nis subtle. I am speaking of passages in Virgil where white lilies\nare mentioned, and I name \" cassia, vervain, thyme \" among low-\ngrowing plants, the favourites of bees. I give the reference (above\nnoted) to Virgil, Georg. II. 213, which combines \"casiam\" and\n\"rorem,\" but I do not quote it. I am not dealing with Ovid, but\nthe Fasti passage is very familiar to me (I have read it often with\nchildren in class), and it seems odd that on the day after the\nappearance of my talk about white lilies and bee-plants, Mrs.\nHolland should write about an Ovidian passage which deals with\nwhite lilies and bee-plants. Ovid, it is true, does not mention bees\n;\nbut to the classical student thyme, cassia, and melilote are typical\nbee-plants.\nIf this is so, the question arises, is this knowledge wholly super-\nnormal, or did Mrs. Holland see the Classical Pieview which usually\ncomes out punctually on the first of the month 1 Even so, I don't\nsee how she could have got any sense of connexion between Ovid's\nProserpine (Fasti) and my article except supernormally.\nThe point of interest in this is that my article deals with Lethe,\nbees, and lilies.\n1\nIt is from the Metamorj>hoxes (probably known to him in Golding's transla-\ntion) that Shakespeare takes his allusions, quoted by Mrs. Holland, to Proser-\npine in The Winter s Tale and The Tempest.\n\f24N Alice Johnson. [part\nThis is the article referred to in Sir Oliver Lodge's paper\nabove, p. 163, in connexion with the passage about Pluto and\nBees in Mrs. Willett's script of March 7, 1910, quoted on p. 245.\nIt may, I think, be taken as certain that neither Mrs.\nWillett nor Mrs. Holland had seen this paper at the time of\nproducing the scripts referred to\n:\n1\nbut I have read it care-\nfully with a view to judging what could be inferred from it\nby non-classical readers. Mrs. Verrall mentions bees in con-\nnexion with Lethe, but not with Pluto, and it appears to me\nvery unlikely that Mrs. Willett should have derived this latter\nconnexion from Mrs. Verrall's paper, even if she had seen it.\nAs to Mrs. Holland, Mrs. Verrall has stated fully in her\nnote above the facts bearing on the question of possible con-\nnexions between Mrs. Holland's script and her paper, and I\ncan find no other points in the paper from which, as it appears\nto me, Mrs. Holland could have deduced anything that emerged\nin this script.\nIf, then, any connexion exists between the scripts and Mrs.\nVerrall's paper, it would seem that it must be telepathic in\norigin, for the scripts reflect, not what is stated in the paper,\nbut some of the topics that would be associated with it in\nMrs. Verrall's mind.\nIn regard to Mrs. Holland's substitution of casiam for rorem\nin the Latin quotation, Mrs. Verrall has quite recently found\nthat there is a difference of reading among the editors of Ovid\nin respect to line 440 of Fasti, Book IV. The older editions in\ncommon use in the early part of last century read casiam, and\nit is pretty certain that this would have been the reading known\nto Mr. Myers as a boy. Casiam is also the reading of the latest\nedition of the Corpus (1894). Merkel, however, (1841) reads\nrorem, which was the reading familiar to Mrs. Verrall.\nThe context of the Ovid quotation in Mrs. Holland's script\nhas also to be considered.\n\" Proserpina \" is mentioned twice only in Shakespeare\n:\nWinters Tale, Act iv. Scene 4 (quoted by Mrs. Holland), and\nTroilus and Cressida, Act ii. Scene 1, \"as Cerberus is at\nProserpina's beauty.\"\n1\n1 have made special enquiries on this point in regard to Mrs. Holland and\nMrs. Verrall has done the same in regard to Mrs. Willett.\n\flxiil] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. IV.)\nDis is mentioned twice only, in the Winter's Tale and\nTempest, both quoted by Mrs. Holland. The Troilus and\nCressida passage does not refer to the story of Proserpine,\nso Mrs. Holland has included in her script of March 2 ;\n1910,\nthe only two references by Shakespeare to the story, both of\nwhich are derived from Ovid's Metamorphoses.\nShe follows them up with a quotation from Borneo and Juliet\n:\n\" Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds.\"\n\"Fiery-footed steeds\" is a translation of Ovid, Met. II. 392,\nwhere in his account of the story of Phaethon he speaks of:\n\" ignipedum vires . . . equorum \" (the strength of the fiery-\nfooted horses).\n1\nThis, then, is another unmistakeable allusion by Mrs. Holland\nto Ovid, as represented in Shakespeare.\nThus her script of March 2, 1910, represents\u2014not only a\ncombination of the two Ovid versions of the story of Proser-\npine with Shakespeare's two allusions to one of those versions\n(a combination which may possibly be found in some passage of\nliterary criticism, though we have not been able to trace any\nsuch), but in addition an allusion to another Ovid story, viz.\nthat of Phaethon.\nThe script shows at least more knowledge of Ovid than can\nbe derived from Shakespeare, who was apparently unacquainted\nwith the Fasti.\nAs to the actual quotation from the Fasti, it is of course\nimpossible to prove that Mrs. Holland had not casually seen\nthis somewhere, and reproduced it from her subconscious memory.\nThat she was not aware of having recently seen any Latin\nphrases is shown by her letter to me, quoted above, where she\nremarks that the script \" tries to get a few Latin words \"\n; for\nit is her custom to tell me whenever she can trace the origin\nof such in her script.2\nEnquiries made later have failed to\nthrow any light on this.\n1\nThe word ignipes (Mrs. Verrall tells me) is used only twice in Latin\npoetry: (1) by Ovid, as above; (2) by Statius, Thtb. I. 27, in a passage\ndeliberately recalling the passage in Ovid.\n2\nLatin phrases, generally very familiar ones, occur occasionally, but by no\nmeans often, in her script. Greek words are still more rare. In several cases\nshe has traced these latter to words casually seen in the midst of her ordinary\nEnglish reading, and reproduced in an apparently mechanical and unintelligent\nway.\n\f250 Alice Johnson. [part\nIt may be worth adding that Tennyson in his Dcmeter and\nPersephone, which has already been mentioned as the source of\nseveral of the factors in this cross-correspondence, follows closely\nOvid's version of the story, and that the same version seems to\nlie behind Mrs. Piper's references to Proserpine on March 24,\n1908, and Mrs. and Miss Verrall's references in Aug. and\nSep. 1908.\nIt was, as shown above, MyersP who originated the \" Proser-\npine \" cross-correspondence, and who in other cases had shown\nevidence of knowledge of Ovid. Mrs. Holland's 0 vidian\nreferences (made, it is to be noted, before any reports on these\nPiper sittings had been published) were to passages known to\nMrs. Verrall ; whereas the Piper Ovidian references to \" Lethe\n\"\nwere not known to Mrs. Verrall. But in both cases it is\n\" Myers \" who claims to be the communicator of the Ovidian\nreferences, and with Ovid, as we know from the autobiographical\npassages in Fragments of Prose and Poetry (p. 17), Frederic\nMyers was intimately acquainted.\n(5) Door Key.\nFor the details of this cross-correspondence, see Mrs. Verrall's\npaper above, pp. 193-204.\n(6) Birds and Turkeys.\nMrs. Holland at the end of a long script produced on\nDec. 9th, 1908, and immediately after a passage quoted in\nconnexion with the \" Sesame and Lilies \" incident (Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV. p. 32 0), writes as follows:\nand a path between \u2014\n\fLXIII.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 251\nI attached no meaning to this.\nOn May 11th, 1909, I saw Mrs. Holland and read over\nwith her a quantity of her recent script, so that she might\nas far as possible identify the quotations which I had not\ntraced. On coming to the \" Mallard \" and drawing of birds,\nshe said that it reminded her of a College song, \" Let All\nSouls' men have their mallard.\"\nLater when it occurred to me that this might have a possible\nconnexion with a phrase in Mrs. Piper's script, I asked\nMrs. Holland to look up this song, which she found in\nThe Minstrelsy of Isis : Poems relating to Oxford, edited by\nJ. B. Firth. The first verse is as follows\n:\n\" Griffin, Turkey, Bustard, Capon,\nLet other hungry mortalls gape on,\nAnd on their bones with stomachs fall hard\nBut let All Souls men have the mallard.\"\nThe mallard feast is, it appears, held at All Souls' College\nwithin a night or two of All Souls' Day (i.e. November 2nd),\nand this was an old drinking song associated with the\nceremony.\nThe corresponding parts of Mrs. Piper's script are\n:\n{April 6, 190S.) G. B. D. Now shall I give you a new message?\n(Hand assents.)\nG. B. D. It refers to the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers here and\nthe first settlement of this country.\n\" The breaking waves dashed high\nOn a stern and rock-bound coast.\"\nDo you understand what \" Pilgrim Fathers \" means 1\nSomething about birds or turkeys\n(G. B. D. explains. The hand suddenly rushes down to the paper\nand writes :) Pilgrim's Progress ! Yes, Pilgrim Fathers.\nG. B. D. Now you understand about the \"breaking waves\" and the\n\" rock-bound coast \" 1 I think you can make a mental\npicture of it which may help you in giving it to the\nother Lights.\nGood, I understand well. Breaking waves ?\nG. B. D. Yes, breaking on a stern and rocky coast.\n\f252 Alice Johnson. [part\n(April 22, 1908.) G. B. D. I have just discovered the association\nin R. H.'s mind between turkeys and pilgrims that made\nthe Light write the one when I spoke of the other,\n\u2014\nPilgrim Fathers, Fast Day, Thanksgiving and Turkey.\n(Hand expresses great satisfaction) I could not think of the\nword\n(It was evident in the action of the hand that Thanks-\ngiving is the word meant, and E,. H. the speaker.)\nG. B. D. You might add it and turkeys to the message.\n(Hand expresses that it will.)\n(May 4, 1908.) [On \"Thanksgiving\" being mentioned:] I said\nTurkeys and Birds to Mrs. Holland, and Mrs. V. also.\nFor the sake of English readers it may be well to explain\nthat Thanksgiving Day is an American national holiday\nappointed\u2014in Massachusetts, at least,\u2014by proclamation by the\nGovernor of the State. The last Thursday in November is\nalways the day appointed. It is a feast day which com-\nmemorates the celebration by the Pilgrim Fathers of their first\nharvest in America. On that occasion they found wild turkeys\nin the woods and brought them home to add to their feast.\nHence turkeys have always been the staple of Thanksgiving\ndinners.\nFast Day commemorates another incident in the history of\nthe early settlers in Massachusetts. After they had been there\nabout two years their supplies gave out, and as the expected\nship from England did not arrive, great suffering resulted,\nand the Governor ordered a day of fasting and prayer to be\nobserved. This being done the ship arrived while the people\nwere praying in church. Within the last few years, Fast Day,\nwhich was gradually transformed into a festival, has been\nre-christened Patriots' Day.\nThe pictorial form used in Mrs. Holland's script on this\noccasion may possibly have been derived from Mr. Dorr's\nsuggestion to Mrs. Piper, \" I think you can make a mental\npicture of it,\" whereas the ideas that were apparently most\nprominent in Mrs. Piper's trance consciousness,\n\u2014\" birds or\nturkeys \" and \" breaking waves,\"\u2014are roughly represented in\nMrs. Holland's drawing.\n\flxiil] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 253\nThe fact that the little known English festival alluded to by\nMrs. Holland and the well-known American one alluded to\nby Mrs. Piper both occur in November adds somewhat to the\ncorrespondence.\n(7) Sesame and Lilies.\nFor the details of this cross-correspondence, see Proceedings,\nVol. XXIV., pp. 264-326.\n(8) Comus.\nMrs. Holland writes on December 16th, 190S :\nThe glassy cool translucent wave\n\u2014\nI want her to draw a recumbent figure not this one the\ndrawing one\u2014Helen could help. . . .\n\" The glassy cool translucent wave \" is quoted from the\nfirst part of the Attendant Spirit's invocation to Sabrina\nin Covins. The first few lines of this (with a few other\npassages from Comus) had been read by Mr. Dorr to the\nPiper controls on May 4th, 1908, and on May 8th he had\nsuggested that they should \" make one of the other Lights\ngive the name of Comus, or of Circe, or make some refer-\nence to the poem,\u2014quote some lines from it, perhaps.\n1\n'\nAgain\non May 12th he repeated\nI read you \"Sabrina fair, listen where thou are sitting,\nUnder the glassy cool translucent wave.\" Perhaps this,\nas a quotation, may help you to give it to the other\nLights.\nThus, besides the lines to \" Sweet Echo\" quoted above, p. 231,\npart of the very passage that Mr. Dorr suggested on this\noccasion was reproduced by Mrs. Holland.\nA number of allusions to Comus were made in the Piper\nsittings, for a full report of which see Mrs. Sidgwick's paper\nin Proceedings, Vol. XXIV., pp. 196-9.\nThe \" recumbent figure \" mentioned in Mrs. Holland's script\nas to be drawn by \" Helen \" is perhaps the nymph Sabrina,\nfor river deities are normally recumbent in Greek art. The\n\f254 Alice Johnson. [part\nPiper controls had also said on May 12th, 190S, that they\nwould give to Miss Verrall \" Caves, nymphs, water-nymphs\nand Maid of the Sea, Maidens fair twining their golden locks.\"\nAgain in Miss Pope's sitting with Mrs. Piper on December\n21st, 1908, MyersP,\nindicating a date with more accuracy than\nusual, wrote :\n[Mrs. Verrall] also wrote, or Helen did, Water nymphs, sprite.\nRecently within three Sabbaths.\nMiss Verrall produced the following script on November\n20th, 1908 :\nA hand long and narrow the fingers close together [drawing\nof hand] white as alabaster the blue depths of ocean\nOf his bones are coral made 1\n\u2014in the caves of ocean\nwhere the sea nymphs dwell\u2014mermaids the lure of the\nsea\u2014lorelei [drawing of bow and arrow]\nand nought shall save the fisherman\nwhom once that net hath trapped\nThe arrow, which appears in this script, is often introduced\ninto the Verrall scripts, apparently as a symbol of a cross-\ncorrespondence. (An instance is to be found in Miss Verrall's\nscript of Oct. 24, 1908, also in the Mac script of Sept. 12,\n1908, both quoted in Mrs. Verrall's paper above, pp. 193-6.)\nMiss Verrall's script here closely reproduces the subjects\nnamed in Mrs. Piper's trance, and is also a sort of paraphrase\nof the latter part of the Attendant Spirit's invocation to\nSabrina, namely :\n\" By Leucothea's lovely hands,\nAnd her son that rules the strands\n;\nBy Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,\nAnd the songs of Sirens sweet\n;\nBy dead Parthenope's dear tomb,\nAnd fair Ligea's golden comb,\nWherewith she sits on diamond rocks\nSleeking her soft alluring locks ;\nBy all the nymphs that lightly dance\nUpon the streams with wily glance ;\n1\nThe Tempest, Act I.

This, combined with the\nidea of \" Time and Eternity,\" would make a natural association\nof ideas between the three quotations that follow in her script,\nviz.:\n(a) \" Here, oh here :\nWe bear the bier\nOf the Father of many a cancelled year\n!\nSpectres we\nOf the dead Hours be,\nWe bear Time to his tomb in eternity.\"\nThis is from Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, Act IV., and is\nsung, after the release of Prometheus, by the \" Train of dark\nForms and Shadows,\" which represent \" the past Hours.\"\n(b) \" Sun-treader, life and light be thine for ever !\nThou art gone from us.\"\nFrom Browning's Pauline ;\nthe \" Sun-treader \" being Shelley.\n(c) \" Less oft is peace in Shelley's mind\nThan calm in waters seen.\"\nFrom Shelley's To Jane : The Recollection.\nR\n\f258 Alice Johnson. [part\nPrometheus.\nThe subject of Prometheus occurred a good many times in\nMr. Dorr's sittings with Mrs. Piper.\nOn March 24th, 1908, Mr. Dorr read to the control some\nlines from the beginning of Mrs. Browning's translation of the\nPrometheus of Aeschylus, explaining, without mentioning its\ntitle, that it was \" the beginning of a play of Aeschylus, and\nShelley wrote about it also.\" To which the control replied,\n\" Yr\nes, I understand, let me recall\u2014who was it that was\nbound to the rock?\" At the next sitting, on March 30th,\nthe control wrote :\nPosthemus\u2014Unbound. I tried and tried to get it through.\n[On Mr. Dorr remarking that the name aimed at was\nassociated in Latin with the word vinctus, the control\nadded] Bound. I spelt it right that time.\nMr. Dorr then read several more verses from the translation\nof Prometheus, and further talk ensued on the subject. In\nthe waking-stage of this day the name \" Prometheus,\" which\nhad not been mentioned by Mr. Dorr, was given for the first\ntime by the control, with a few remarks about him. On\nMarch 31st Mr. Dorr suggested that \"Prometheus\" would be\na good message to take to the other automatists, and mentioned\nvarious ideas associated with the name which might help in\nconveying it, such as the vulture that gnawed his breast, the\nrock to which he was bound, and his gifts to man. On\nApril 7th, in the waking-stage, came the words\n:\nFire\u2014From careless man\u2014he taught them all his wiles and\nwisdom. Shelley ! He taught them all he knew. And\nthey were envious of him\u2014Poor Prometheus ! What\nwould we have known but for him !\nPrometheus was referred to again as a message to be taken\nwith \"Fire\" and \"Art,\" on April 1.3th, 14th, 22nd and\n27th, and May 4th, 8th, 12th and 13th.\nThe following script about Prometheus was produced by Mrs.\nVerrall on Sept. 23, 1908 :\n[In Greek. He wrapped up beforehand the fillets and so also the\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 259\nveils ; he brings in also the nard. For in a narthex was hidden\nthe fire by which Prometheus made men like unto gods] 1\nIn a narthex stem conveyed 2\nBy the god who disobeyed\nBroke the fate, mankind to save\nSo gave freedom to the slave.\nAnd Ocean's nymphs his loneliness deplore\nFloating melodious to the distant shore\nWhere the dim form of man's immortal friend\nWaited the issue and foreknew the end.\nThere is something else wanted to make this complete\u2014more than\nForeknowledge goes to make a god, and more than sympathy with\nsuffering. Can't you fill the void in the story 1\nNot perhaps yet, try later.\nThis is the only mention of Prometheus in 282 scripts by\nMrs. Verrall, covering a period of nearly four years.\nOn the Greek in this script, Mrs. Verrall sends me the\nfollowing note\n:\nThe word TvpovKaXvxpev means \"wrapped up or hid beforehand,\"\nand there is a grammar mistake over the word \\i'npa.. The word\nfor fillet is mitra, fern., so that its accusative plural should be mitras :\ntas mitras would be \" the fillets \" (as I knew). The word in the script\nought to come from a singular mitron. But there is no such word.\nThere is, however, a word miton, meaning thread ; the accusative\nplural of which would be ta mita. If this were what is intended\nthe sentence would very well represent an attempt to indicate cross-\ncorrespondences :\n\" he concealed beforehand the threads.\" Anyhow\nconcealment is clearly an important element in this M. V. script.\nTime and Eternity.\nA reference to \" Time and Eternity \" occurred in a passage\nin Miss Verrall's script of November 19th, 1908, as follows:\nTime's hour glass whose sands never run out\u2014Time and\neternity.

[part\nI asked Mrs. Verrall in March, 1911, whether she could\ntrace the origin of the Greek in this script, and after a\nlittle investigation she replied :\nI find the phrase \"Time an Image of Eternity\" in Plato's Timaeus,\nwhich Helen has read and known well.\n(Ch. X.) Troiei fikvoi'Tos alwvos ev evl Kar apiOpov toucrai' altnviov eiKova,\ntovtov ov 81] ypovov Mvopo.Kapev.\nTranslation (by R. D. Archer-Hind) \" [while God was ordering the\nuniverse], he made of eternity that abides in unity an eternal image\nmoving according to number, even that which we have called time.\"\nThere is no doubt whatever that the H. V. script reproduces this\n:\nit has the words eiKwv (image) and almv (eternity), atwvtos (the\neternal), and xP'n'\n0<s (time).\nThe passage is difficult, and R. D. A.-H. has a long note on the chief\ndifficulty, \u2014that time is described as an eternal image of eternity. The\nH. V. script gets out of the difficulty by leaving out the adjective\n(eternal) and inserting the qualifying wv-rrep, \" as it were,\" \" Time is, as\nit were, an image of the Eternal given to men.\" The word for\ngiven is ungrammatical, though it is plain enough what is meant\n;\nand the gender of \"image,\" ei\/c&v, is incorrect.\nThis interpretation by Mrs. Verrall of Miss Verrall's script\nas reminiscent of the Timaeus was made in ignorance of the\nsuggestion made to me by another friend about a month earlier,\nthat Mrs. Holland's phrase about \" Time and Eternity \" was\nreminiscent of Vaughau's poem ; but it will be seen that there is\na close resemblance between the Timaeus passage and the poem,\nwhich happened to be unknown both to Mrs. and Miss Verrall.\nMiss Verrall's script deviates from its original source in\ndescribing Time as given to men, and this seems the only link\n\u2014\nif link it can be called\u2014between her scripts and the \" Prome-\ntheus \" scripts of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Verrall, both of which\nrefer to Prometheus' gifts to men.\nAnother unmistakable link, however, is provided by Mrs.\nHolland's script, which was the latest of the four, and which\ncombines the topics \" Time and Eternity \" and \" Prometheus\n\"\nin a single quotation from Shelley's Prometheus Unbound.\nI wish to lay special stress on this case, because it seems to\nme to fulfil the condition suggested by Mr. Piddington in his\nwell-known experiment of the \" Latin Message,\" which he gave\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 261\nto Mrs. Piper's trance personalities at the end of 1906. The\nsuggestion he made to them, translated into English, runs as\nfollows\n:\n1\n\" Try to give to A. and B. two different messages, between\nwhich no connexion is discernible. Then as soon as possible\ngive to C. a third message, which will reveal the hidden\nconnexion.\"\nNow here Mrs. Verrall's script of Sep. 23, 1908, states\nexplicitly \" There is something else wanted to make this com-\nplete \"\n;\npossibly meaning that a cross-correspondence is being\nattempted. The Greek part of the same script also refers to\nsomething wrapped up, or concealed, beforehand, i.e. to some hidden\ndesign in the references. Between this and Miss Verrall's script\nof Nov. 19, 1908, I think it may fairly be said that \"no con-\nnexion is discernible.\" But in Mrs. Holland's script of Dec.\n30, 1908, a \"hidden connexion\" between the two earlier ones\nis revealed.\nMrs. Verrall, it is true, refers to the Prometheus of Aeschylus,\nwhile Mrs. Holland refers to the Prometheus of Shelley ; but\nthis connects the Holland script with the Piper sittings, in which\nShelley was mentioned as well as Aeschylus, while the Piper\ntrance utterances are clearly connected with Mrs. Verrall's\nscript.\n(10) Confirmation\n.\nThe passage marked (^10) in Mrs. Holland's script of\nDec. 30, 1908, contains two quotations from Shakespeare:\n(a) \"Trifles light as air\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\nAs proofs of holy writ :\n\"\n(Othello, Act III.

[part\nA connexion is perhaps intended with Mrs. Verrall's script\nof April 30, 1908, which, like Mrs. Holland's, claims to come\nfrom Frederic Myers, and contains the word \" confirmation \" with\ntwo other words beginning with \" con- \" and clearly indicates that\na cross-correspondence is intended. The passage is as follows\n:\nNot the only test word has been given between you and\nHelen there are other words to be similarly used when\nthe time comes. And confirmation could I think be\nobtained by others help. Anyhow why not try for con-\ntemporary corroboration. Thus : Conversation about a\ndulcimer, ask to whom that recalls something.\nA slight contribution to the same cross-correspondence is to\nbe found in Mrs. Piper's sittings as follows\n:\n(May 12, 1908.)\n(Waking-stage.)\n[after reference to a number of messages :]\nThey told me to take Winged Victory, and Spire,\nConformation\nAltar\u2014Altar\u2014and Chancel\nI have travelled many miles to get those to you, George\n(May 13, 1908.)

Watts'\npicture mentioned in her first script is probably the picture\nof Orpheus and Eurydice painted in 1869 and now hanging\nin the Watts gallery at Compton, in which Orpheus holds\na lute with all the strings broken but one ;\nfor it seems clear\nthat the two scripts are connected together, and Orpheus\nand Eurydice are explicitly mentioned in the second one. In\nthe waking stage of Mrs. Piper's trance on March 30, and\nagain on March 31, 1908, Orpheus and Eurydice had been\nmentioned (see Proceedings, Vol. XXIV. pp. 105-6) and Mr.\nPiddington in his discussion of these sittings shows that Orpheus\nand Eurydice belong to a group of Ovidian references connected\nwith the answers given by MyersP to Mr. Dorr's question about\nLethe (op. cit., pp. 115-120) and gives reasons for thinking that\nMyerSp also had in mind Watts' picture of Orpheus and\nEurydice (op. cit., pp. 130-132), which is thus described in\nF.

[part\n\" Farewell' ! from thy embrace I pass,\nDrawn to the formless dark alone :\nI stretch my hands, \u2014too weak, alas !\nAnd I no more, no more thine own.\"\nThe poem deliberately recalls the famous passage in the\nFourth Georgic, to which Miss Verrall's script of May 16,\n1908, also alludes, the last four lines of this verse being a\ntranslation of Georg. iv. 497-8.\nThe same topics are referred to later in the Mac scripts and\nin Mrs. Willett's script, given below, but the next script in\nchronological order dealing with the general subject of \" Exile\n\"\nis Mrs. Holland's of Feb. 10, 1909, quoted above. This\ncontains nothing about a harp or lute, but consists of a\nnumber of variations on the theme of Exile, chiefly associated\nwith Ireland in general (and so perhaps by implication with\nthe harp, as the emblem of Ireland), though not with Moore\nin particular, viz. :\n(a) \" St. Bridget's Day\u2014St. Bride\u2014Our Lady of the Mantle\nGreen.\"\nThe green which is so marked a characteristic of the Dog\nMercury mentioned earlier in the same script seems to lead\non to St. Bridget. Her Day is February 1st. She\nfounded the important religious house at Kildare, of which\nshe became Abbess, and which attracted scholars from all\nparts of Ireland, as she was a great patroness of educa-\ntion and the fine arts. She died in 523, and is regarded\nas the chief woman saint of Ireland, being often spoken of in\nassociation with the Virgin. She is called St. Bride of the\nMantle and the Foster Mother of Christ,1\nfrom the legend that\nshe was miraculously transported to Bethlehem on the night\nthat Christ was born ;\nshe then took the child in her arms and\ncovered it with her mantle and nursed it all through the night.\nIn the Hebrides she is regarded as \" the aid-woman of mothers.\"\nThere is a story of Fiona Macleod's,2\nwhich begins with an\n1\nThe legends and folk-lore connected with St. Bride and referred to in the\ntext are chiefly taken from Carmina Gadelica : Hymns and Incantations, with\nillustrative notes on words, rites and customs, dying and obsolete ;\norally collected\nin the Highlands and islands of Scotland, and translated into English. By\nAlexander Carmichael (Edinburgh, 1900).\n2 \" St. Bride of the Isles \" in the volume Spiritual Tales.\n\flxiil] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 267\naccount of the banishment of St. Bride's father from Ireland\nimmediately after her birth, when he went to Iona, taking her\nwith him, so that she was an exile from Ireland. There may\npossibly be some allusion to this banishment in the script,\nthough Mrs. Holland tells me that she never read the story,\nand I have failed to find any foundation, either historical or\nlegendary, for its opening.1\nThe subjects associated with St.\nBridget in the script seem at least to refer to Scotch as well as\nto Irish legends of her. Thus \" the Snake \" ;\n\u2014the Serpent was\nsupposed in Scotland 2\nto emerge from its hollow among the\nhills on St. Bride's Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it\n:\n\" To-day is the Day of Bride,\nThe serpent will come from its hole\n;\nI will not molest the serpent,\nNor will the serpent molest me.\"\nOne of the customs of St. Bride's Day was the pounding of the\nserpent in eftigy.\nInnumerable charms to guard against various evils, or to assist\nall sorts of domestic arts and operations, are associated with the\nname of \" the golden-haired Bride,\" and it was perhaps the invoca-\ntions of St. Bride and the Virgin in connexion with the important\nfunctions of the kindling and \" smooring \" of the fire that led on\nthe automatist to write next of the Phoenix. But St. Bridget is\nespecially associated with the spring, for \" it is on her day . . .\n[that] the death of the year is done with and the birthday of the\nyear is come,\" 3\nand this makes another connexion with the\nPhoenix, regarded as a symbol of the Eesurrection.\nThe name Bridget is derived from Brighid or Brio-it, the\nCeltic goddess or Muse of Song, daughter of the Dagda, who,\nlike Orpheus, had a wonder-working harp.4\n1\nThe story as a whole is founded on \"The Genealogy of Bride\n7\n'\nin Alexander\nCarmichael's Carmina Gadelica (Vol. I. p. 165). I fancy that \"Fiona Macleod \"\n(the literary secondary personality of William Sharp) invented the opening part\nin consequence of his great affection for Iona and interest in St. Bride, so\nthat he liked to imagine that she, as well as St. Columba, had actually lived\nthere.\n'-It is well known that there are no snakes in Ireland, since they were banished\nthence by St. Patrick, who was born about half a century earlier than St. Bride.\n3\nLady Gregory, A Book of Saints and Wonders, p. 12.\n4\nCours de Literature Celtique, Vol. I. p. 56.\n\f268 Alice Johnson. [part\n(b) \" The Phoenix.\" The script quotes two detached lines\nfrom Mr. A. C. Benson's poem of this title, as if to imply\nthat the whole of it was in the mind of the scribe. It is as\nfollows\n:\n1\n\" By feathers green, across Casbeen,\nThe pilgrims track the Phoenix flown,\nBy gems he strewed in waste and wood\nAnd jewelled plumes at random thrown.\n\" Till wandering far, by moon and star,\nThey stand beside the fruitful pyre,\nWhence breaking bright with sanguine light,\nThe impulsive bird forgets his sire.\n\" Those ashes shine like ruby wine,\nLike bag of Tyrian murex spilt\n;\nThe claw, the jowl of the flying fowl\nAre with the glorious anguish gilt.\n\" So rare the light, so rich the sight,\nThose pilgrim men, on profit bent,\nDrop hands and eyes and merchandise,\nAnd are with gazing most content.\"\nThis poem seems a sort of conglomerate of the older oriental\nmyth of the Phoenix with its later forms, as adopted into early\nChristian symbolism. Ambrose, e.g., used the Phoenix as a\nsymbol of the Resurrection and there is a famous Anglo-Saxon\npoem on the subject, probably written in the latter half of\nthe eighth century and attributed to Cynewulf.2\nThe poem\n1\nIn answer to enquiries about this poem, Mr. Benson writes to me: \"I\ndreamed the whole poem in a dream, in 1894, I think, and wrote it down in the\nmiddle of the night on a scrap of paper by my bedside. I have never had a\nsimilar experience, and, what is more curious, it is a lyric of a style which I\nhave never attempted before or since. ... I really can offer no explanation\neither of the idea of the poem or its interpretation. It came to me so\n(apparently) without any definite volition of my own that I don't profess to\nunderstand or to be able to interpret the symbolism.\"\nIt is quoted here in full, by the kind permission of the author and of the\npublisher, from The Poems of A. G. Benson (London: John Lane, The Bodley\nHead, 1909), p. 263.\n2\nSee Stopford Brooke's History of Early English Literature, in which a trans-\nlation of a great part of the poem is given.\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 269\ndescribes the Paradise in which the Phoenix lives alone,\u2014\na\nHappy Isle, like the Elysian Fields of Homer or the Earthly\nParadise of Dante. Once in every thousand years, attended\nby troops of birds, he flies far to the Syrian land, where in a\ndesert place on a high tree he makes his nest for death.\nThere \" in a season of calm weather,\" when the wind is still\nand the clouds are cleared away and every storm under heaven is\nhushed, he builds his nest and sets it on fire. The young\nPhoenix, who rises out of the ashes, gathers together the relics\nof the parent body and, covering them with herbs, takes them\nin his claws and flies back with them to his native land.\n\" All men and all the birds flock to see his flight, but he\noutstrips their sight and comes alone to his happy isle, where\nonce more he dwells in the grove, delighting in the welling\nstreams.\"\nThe lifediistory of the Phoenix, then, might possibly be\nregarded as another illustration of the idea of Exile.\n(c) \" The black lyn, etc.\" Here the script returns definitely\nto Irish associations : the name \" Dublin \" or \" Duibh-linn\n\"\nmeans the black pool. Next comes a quotation from a song\nby an Irishwoman, Lady Dufferin, whose best known poem is\n'\nThe Irish Emigrant,\" and afterwards a reference to the\nPhoenix Park murders, probably suggested by the previous\nmention of the Phoenix. Then come two further quotations\nreferring to the general topic of exile from home. \" Dulce\ndonum \" (sweet gift) is of course a misquotation of \" dulce\ndomum \" (sweet home), but there seems a double meaning in\nit, for it immediately follows the words \" in terra pax,\" and\nthe peace brought down to earth might be called a \" sweet\ngift.\"\nExile\u2014Continued.\nThe following references in the Mac scripts seem specially\nconnected with Miss Verrall's scripts of April 27th and\nMay 16th, 1908, quoted above, which had not been seen\nby the Mac family at the time the following scripts were }\nobtained.\n\f27o Alice Johnson.

W. H. Myers in his poem\nquoted above.\nMiss Verrall's script returns to the subject on Feb. 5, 1910,\nin the following phrases :\n2\nWhen the sound of the harp is mute\nand the waters of Babylon\nThis must be regarded as a normal reminiscence of the\ncross-correspondence on \" Exile,\" which was known to Miss\nVerrall at the time ; but it seems to be supernormally con-\nnected with the emergence of the same topic in Mrs. Willett's\nscript five days later.\nMrs. Willett, on Feb. 10, 1910,3\nimmediately following on the\n1\nThis sentence no doubt refers to Miss Mac's custom of sending the scripts\nat intervals to Mrs. Verrall, \" Helenn \" being of course Miss Verrall.\n2\nFor the whole of this script and a discussion of it, see Mrs. Verrall's\npaper above, p. 212.\n:;\nFor the whole of this script, see ISir Oliver Lodge's paper above, pp. 148-\n150.\n\flxiti.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 271\npassage quoted above (p. 244-5) under the Cross-correspondence\n\" Proserpine \" wrote :\nSwinburne.

Mrs. Willett had seen Miss\nVerrall's script of April 29, 1909 (quoted in Mrs. Verrall's\npaper above, p. 186), in which the phrase \"By the waters of\nBabylon \" occurs, but she did not know that it had at any\ntime formed part of a cross-correspondence, or that there had\nbeen a cross-correspondence on the topic Exile. Considering\nhow much evidential matter is contained in this whole script\nof Mrs. Willett's, there seems strong ground for supposing, as\nsuggested by Sir Oliver Lodge (see above, p. 155), that\n\" Watts\u2014Watts \" belongs to the same general topic and refers\nto the picture by Watts, which was presumably alluded to\nby Miss Verrall on April 27, 1908 (see above, p. 265).\nIt is noteworthy that while in Mrs. Holland's script of\nNov. 25, 1908, certain cross-correspondences that had emerged\nseparately in the scripts of other automatists,\u2014viz. \" Echo,\"\n\" Nightingale,\" and \" Proserpine,\" were all associated together\n;\nso in Mrs. Willett's script of Feb. 10, 1910, another single\ncross-correspondence, hitherto disconnected,\u2014viz. \" Exile,'\"\u2014is\nadded to this group, a link being found in the notion,\ncommon to all, of the contrast between memory and forget-\nfulness. This idea is clenched in the passage from Mrs.\nHolland's script of Feb. 16, 1910, already quoted:\nI shall remember while the light lives yet\nAnd in the darkness I shall not forget.\n\f272 Alice Johnson. [part\n(13) Shelley s Oclc \" To a Skylark.\"\nAt the end of Mrs. Holland's script of Feb. 10, 1909, and\napparently quite disconnected from what precedes them, occur\nthe first two lines of this poem (see above, p. 263). This is\nanother case (cf. the cross-correspondence \" Comus,\" No. 8 above,\np. 253) where a quotation suggested by Mr. Dorr to be given\nthrough \" one of the other Lights \" appeared in her script.\nIt was referred to in Mrs. Piper's trance as follows :\n(May 4th, 1908.)\nG.

But she makes no reference to Pegasus, and she brings\nin other details of the Perseus myth,\u2014such as the three Grey\nSisters and the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster,-\n\u2014\nwhich are not mentioned by Mrs. Piper.\n(16) Cyclops and Hercules.\nMrs. Holland's script of April 14th, 1909, contains the\nfollowing :\nThe Cyclops\n\" In valour is not Love an Hercules\nStill climbing trees in the Hesperides \" 1\nKennst du das Land 1\n2\nThe Isle of the Hesperides, as a sort of earthly Paradise,\nseems here to lead on to the country described in Mignon's\nsong\n:\n\" Kennst du das Land, wo die Citronen bluhn,\nIm dunkeln Laub die Gold-Orangen gluhn,\nEin sanfter Wind vom blauen Himmel weht,\nDie Myrte still und hoch der Lorbeer steht,\n\"Kennst du den Berg und seinen Wolkensteg 1\nDas Maulthier sucht im Nebel seinen Weg,\nIn Hohlen wohnt der Drachen alte Brut\n;\nEs stiirzt der Fels und iiber ihn die Fluth.\"\n1\nLove's Labour Lost, Act iv.

Mrs. Verrall's scripts on\nMarch 4th and 25th, 1907, had contained references to the Herades Furens of\nEuripides, and Mrs. Holland's script of April 16th, 1907, had referred to\nBrowning's translation of the same play.

W.\nPollard's Odes from the Greek Dramatists\u2014contained extracts\nboth from Browning's translation of the Hercules Furens\nand from Shelley's translation of the Cycloids. He pro-\nceeded to read aloud some passages from the former,\none of which was :\n\" And next to the melodious maids he came,\nInside the Hesperian court-yard : hand must aim\nAt plucking gold fruit from the appled leaves,\nNow he had killed the dragon, backed like flame,\nWho guards the unapproachable ; he weaves\nHimself all round, one spire about the same.\"\nOn hearing these lines, the trance-personality wrote :]\nI am listening carefully\u2014Apple\u2014correct. She quoted it in\nanswer to apple.\n[From the context, \" she \" appears to mean Mrs. Verrall. Mr.\nDorr then read some verses from Shelley's Cyclops, explain-\ning that it was a translation from the Greek, and the\ntrance-personality, on being asked whose verses they were,\nanswered :]\nDid he write Ode'to the Sky Lark?\n[Mr. Dorr assented, and said that he wished to give \"Cyclops\n' r\nas a message to be taken to the other automatists. In\nthe waking-stage of this day came the words :]\nCyclops\u2014head, snakes.\nAtlas, globe on his head and shoulders\nCyclops had one eye in his forehead ....\nCyclops was\u2014Centaur, no, that's mixed ! Half head, half\nbodjr\n, tell him that. Say, snakes from the head.\nHere it is evident that the idea of the Cyclops is confused\nwith Centaurs and other topics,\u2014such as the garden of the\nHesperides and Atlas,\u2014associated with Hercules, and it certainly\nseems remarkable that this combination of unconnected ideas\nshould occur both in Mrs. Holland's and in Mrs. Piper's script.\nOn April 27th and May 8th, 1908, the Cyclops is again referred\nto as a message to be taken, and on May 12th MyersP claimed,,\nas stated above, that it had been given to Mrs. Holland.\n\f282 Alice Johnson. [PART\nMeanwhile, on April 22, 1908 (see above), he had maintained\nthat Mrs. Verrall had quoted Browning's lines about the\nHesperides. This is perhaps one of the instances in which, as\nMrs. Verrall has observed, the trance personalities seem not to\ndistinguish between her and her daughter's scripts. Miss Verrall,\non September 5th, 1908, produced the following script, part of\nwhich refers to the same subjects as Browning's lines\n:\nThe garden of the sun the golden apples that the dragon\nguarded Who stole the apples froward mortal Hesperides\nthree nymphs no no go not to Lethe 1\nand the river of\nwailing too Upon the shore they stood and stretched\ntheir arms.\nThe Principle of Selection in the Production\nof Scripts.\n\" To choose is to create.\"\n\u2014\n0.

Lethe, it will be remembered, had been\nsuggested as a subject for cross-correspondence in this same sitting of April\n22, 1908, with Mrs. Piper.

In this the scripts resemble\nordinary cases of experimental thought-transference, where the\nidea that the agent wishes to transfer relates to something\nfamiliar to the percipient, and telepathy is manifested by the\npercipient's selection, out of a number of more or less familiar\nideas, of the particular one that had been thought of by\nthe agent. Similarly, when a cross-correspondence occurs\nbetween scripts, there seems to be a selection, out of one\nautomatist's ideas, of something corresponding to what another\nhas written.\nFor the automatic writing does not, of course, reproduce all\nthe ideas in the mind of the automatist. It resembles rather\nthose dreams which represent one or two trivial ideas chosen\napparently at random out of the dreamer's stock of thoughts.\nWe can often trace the source of a dream to something recently\nseen or heard, but we can seldom or never give a satisfactory\nexplanation of why that particular thing, rather than a number\nof other possible things, should have recurred in the dream.\nIt can sometimes be attributed to a train of thought, leading\non from one idea to another ; or sometimes to a slight external\nstimulus mingling in the train and shaping or distorting it.\nBut why the train of thought should go in one direction\nrather than another, why one external stimulus should affect\nit perceptibly and another not, remains mysterious.\nThe same normal, though obscure, psychological processes\nwith which we are all familiar in dream and reverie are also\nat work in automatic writing. Here, too, we can often trace\nthe ideas and the phrases to something that has recently passed\nthrough the automatist's mind or to a discoverable train of\nthought. And it is probable that, the more we knew of the\ncircumstances, the more of these links of normal causation\nwould be discovered, though even then the cpiestion of what\ndetermined the emergence of one idea rather than another\nwould be difficult to solve.\nBut while many of the individual scripts considered by\nthemselves seem explicable by normal causes, some other\nfactor has to be assumed for the coincidences between them,\ngranting, as I think it must be granted, that these are too\n\f284 Alice Johnson. [part\nnumerous to be put clown to chance. As another person may\nenter a room and break in on the reverie of a solitary thinker,\nand by speech or action may turn or influence the course of his\nthoughts ; so this other factor of telepathy (whether from the\nincarnate or the discarnate), which seems to act frequently,\nthough intermittently, and with varying degrees of force, tends\nto influence the scripts in such a way as to bring them into\nharmony with one another.\nThe telepathic influence in these cases produces, as is well\nknown, harmony, and not uniformity. One script does not\ngive the exact words of another, but expresses the same idea,\nor sometimes another aspect of the same idea, in different\nwords. The absence of any exact resemblance between the\ntwo may be clue to one of two causes : either (a) telepathy\nhas partially failed, so that the result is only partially success-\nful, or (5) there is a deliberate intention on the part of the\ntelepathic influence which acts on the scripts to make them\nexpress the same idea differently. Of course we cannot\nassume that there is any such deliberate intention unless we\nhave some fairly definite evidence of it. If two scripts express\nideas which are clearly parts of one whole,\u2014for instance, if one\ngives \" Julius \" and the other \" Caesar,\"\u2014the whole idea is\nbetter\n\u2014\ni.e. more precisely\u2014expressed than if both gave\n\" Julius,\" for Julius would apply to many more people than\nJulius Caesar.\nOn the other hand, if one script gave \" Brutus \" and the\nother \" Caesar,\" we should infer that there might have been\nsome telepathy between the two scripts, but that, if so, it was\nonly partially successful ; the second script, we should suppose,\nought to have given \" Brutus,\" but only got somewhere near it\nby giving \" Caesar.\"\nIn ordinary experiments in thought-transference between\ntwo living persons, cases like this often occur, when the per-\ncipient does not reproduce exactly the thought of the agent,\nbut gives something more or less approximating to it, as if\nthe attempt had fallen short. But it seldom, if ever, happens\nthat the percipient gives something which definitely supple-\nments or adds to the agent's thought in such a way that the\ntwo between them give a more complete representation of one\nidea than is to be found in either alone, whereas this supple-\n\flxiil] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 285\nmentary character is often found in the scripts relating to the\nmore complicated cross-correspondences.\nTo illustrate the difference, compare two cases given above,\n\"Birds and turkeys\" (p. 250), and \" Comus \" (p. 253). In\nthe first, the scripts of Mrs. Holland and Mrs Piper do not\nsupplement one another ;\nthey express two separate and\ndistinct, though similar, things,\u2014not two parts of one idea. It\nseems probable, therefore, that the difference between them\nwas not deliberately caused, but that it happened uninten-\ntionally. The case thus resembles a partially successful experi-\nment in thought-transference.\nIn the second case, \" Comus,\" Mrs. Holland quotes a phrase\nfrom the address to Sabrina, while Miss Verrall gives a para-\nphrase of another part of it, and these two scripts, with Mrs.\nPiper's trance utterances, supplement one another, giving a\nmore complete representation of this part of the poem than\nany one of them alone. Here, then, the differences between\nthe scripts afford some evidence of design ;\nthe supplementary\nelement in them seems to be what Mr. Balfour calls \" pur-\nposive.\" 1\nA more definitely complementary relation between two scripts\nis seen in the case of \" Echo \" and i:\nNightingale,\" in Mrs.\nHolland's script of Nov. 25, 1908, and Mrs. Piper's of\nDec. 9, 1908 (see pp. 229 and 233), where Mrs. Holland gives\n\" Echo \" explicitly and \" Nightingale \" implicitly, and Mrs. Piper\nreverses the process.\nA somewhat similar kind of complementariness is seen in\nthe distribution of separate parts of a cross-correspondence\nbetween different automatists. Thus in the \" Door\u2014Key \" case\n(see Mrs. Verrall's paper above, pp. 193-204), Miss Verrall's\nscript mentions \" Door \" and Mrs. Holland's gives a drawing of\na key, whereas both words had occurred in the Mac script.\nAgain, in the \" Sesame and Lilies \" case (Proceedings, Vol. XXIV.\npp. 264-318), Mrs. Verrall's script mentions \"Lilies,\" and Miss\nVerrall's alludes indirectly to \" Sesame,\" shortly after the com-\nplete phrase \" Sesame and Lilies \" had appeared in the Mac\nscript.\nA farther step, and one affording stronger evidence for\ndesign on the part of an intelligence external to all the\n1\nSee Proceedings, Part LXII. p. 45.\n\f286 Alice Johnson. [part\nautornatists, is found in cases of the converse type, where one\nautomatist's script ingeniously links together two entirely dis-\nsimilar topics that have previously appeared separately in the\nscripts of two other autornatists,\u2014a plan that had been suggested\nin Mr. Piddington's Latin Message, and that seems to have\nbeen successfully carried out in the case of \" Prometheus \" and\n\"Time and Eternity\" (see p. 256), where these topics, which\nhad occurred respectively in the scripts of Mrs. and Miss\nVerrall, were combined by Mrs. Holland in a single quotation.\nAn amplification of this process is seen where cross-corre-\nspondences that had seemed already complete reappear, in the\nform of factors in a larger scheme, in a later script by another\nautomatist. Thus, \" Proserpine,\" which had already formed the\nsubject of a cross-correspondence between Mrs. Piper, the\nMacs, and Mrs. and Miss Verrall, recurs in Mrs. Holland's\nscript of Nov. 25, 1908, woven in with some other cross-\ncorrespondences\n\u2014\ne.g. \" Echo \" and \" Nightingale \"\n; while Mrs.\nWillett's script of Feb. 10, 1910, repeats these topics, com-\nbining with them the hitherto separate cross-correspondence of\n\" Exile,\" and finding a fresh link of association between them\nall in the notion of the contrast between memory and forget-\nfulness (see p. 271).\nA similar blending of several simple cross-correspondences\ninto one complicated whole was shown by Mr. Piddington to\noccur in the \" Light in West \" case (Proceedings, Vol. XXII.\npp. 241-280).\nIt must, I think, be admitted that cross-correspondences\nof so elaborate a character as these differ in a marked way\nfrom ordinary cases of experimental thought-transference,\nwhich seem to involve nothing more than a momentary effect\nproduced by one mind on another, the effects produced at\ndifferent moments having no coherence or connexion with one\nanother.\nThe cross-correspondences point rather to an intelligence\nwhich is continually thinking, continually making plans, con-\ntinually developing them and adapting them to circumstances.\nWe have to consider how far this intelligence can be identified\nwith the subliminal selves of the autornatists.\nThe script of each automatist taken by itself seems, indeed,\nto indicate great activity and intelligence on the part of her\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 287\nsubliminal self. The latter can, to begin with, draw on a wider\nrange of subjects than is accessible to the supraliminal, for\nthe subliminal memory is more extensive than the supraliminal.\nNot only is there a great variety in the topics introduced\n,\nbut great ingenuity is shown in expressing them in different\nways : e.g. by a number of different quotations appropriate to\nthe same subject ;\nby altering the quotation to make it suit ;\nby various devices for emphasising different words in it which\nare not emphasised in the original ;\nby the choice of quotations\nwhich refer to a topic indirectly through their context, and\nso on.\nSo far as all this goes, there is nothing provably beyond\nnormal subliminal powers, and it would be a natural result\nof the long continuance of any automatic activity that the\nsubliminal self should become more and more developed. It\nmust also be largely influenced by the knowledge which the\nautomatists have in course of time acquired normally, both\nof their own and of other scripts. For they cannot be kept\npermanently in ignorance of each other's scripts, or of the\ndiscussions on them, since, sooner or later, they see the articles\npublished about them. jSTor can they help speculating on the\nsubject themselves, and being influenced by the speculations of\nothers.\nIn any case, the scripts of each automatist undoubtedly suggest\nan active intelligence, with idiosyncracies of its own, and work-\ning on its own account,\u2014something as different as possible\nfrom a mere channel for the utterances of another mind, as\ndifferent as possible from the ordinary conception of \" spirit\ncontrol,\" which implies that the mind of the automatist is in\nabeyance, while he mechanically reproduces phrases, as it were\ndictated to him from outside.\nIt has generally been assumed that the best evidence for\ncommunication from the spirits of survivors could be obtained\nunder such conditions, where everything came as directly as\npossible from the spirit, while the mind of the automatist was\nas much as possible put out of action. The idea is, of course,\na very plausible one on the face of it.\nIt has further been assumed that this condition is most\nlikely to coincide with a state of deep trance, and that the\ndeeper the trance, the more complete is the \" possession \" by\n\f-288 Alice Johnson. [part\nthe spirit, and consequently the better are the results obtained.\nFor this idea, there is, it seems to me, little or no evidence.\nWe do not find in practice that what comes through an auto-\nmatist in trance is constantly better than what comes through\nan automatic writer, whose mental condition shows little\nor no signs of dissociation.\nFurther, a study and comparison of a great number of scripts\nseem to show that activity on the part of the subliminal self\nis by no means necessarily an obstacle to the influence of an\noutside mind. For the great development of subliminal action\nwhich is, I think, to be found in the recent scripts has coin-\ncided with a great development in the supernormal connexions\nbetween them, which have become both more numerous and\nmore complex. This fact points either to a freer play of\ntelepathy between the automatists, or to a stronger telepathic\ninfluence from outside, acting on all of them, and tending to\nproduce connexions between them. Or it may be, as I am\ninclined to think, that there is both more telepathy between\nthem, and more telepathy from a source external to all of\nthem.\nThis hypothesis is, in effect, one that occurred long ago to\nMr. Myers, who had, I think, a quite extraordinary faculty for\nforeseeing the trend of events in psychical research. In refer-\nence to a case where the vision of a death was seen, \u2014not at the\ntime it occurred, but at the time when the news of it reached\na third person,\u2014he observed :\nI conjecture that a current of influence may be started by a\ndeceased person, which, however, only becomes strong enough to be\nperceptible to its object when reinforced by some vivid current of\nemotion arising in living minds. I do not say that this is yet\nprovable ;\nyet the hint may be of value when the far-reaching inter-\ndependencies of telepathy between the two worlds come to be better\nunderstood. 1\nWhat is here foreshadowed is a simple kind of co-operation\nbetween two minds\u2014the discarnate and the incarnate\u2014as if\ntwo men were pulling at one rope in the same direction, so\nthat the total pull would depend simply on the sum of their\nefforts. But if co-operation between the two minds be once\n1\nHuman Personality, vol. ii. p. 55.\n\fLXlil.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 289\nstarted, it might develop into a much more complicated rela-\ntionship, and it seems clear that when Mr. Myers was speaking\nof \"the far-reaching interdependencies of telepathy between the\ntwo worlds,\" he was thinking of the possibilities of its develop-\nment. For his whole thought was coloured by his strong belief\nin the possibility of quite new things happening\u2014things that\nhad never happened in the world before, but that were the\nnormal growth and outcome of previous happenings.\nNow the normal result of physical evolution, as we know\nit, is that as we rise in the scale from the inanimate to the\nanimate, from the plant to the animal, from the animal to\nman, we find at each step a more definite and complete indi-\nviduality,\u2014a tree is more of an individual than a rock, and a\ndog more than a tree,\u2014and at the same time, with each up-\nward step, we find more and more points of contact\u2014more\nand more complicated relationships\u2014between the individual and\nthe world outside him. As he becomes more active and vital\nand distinct from the world, the more closely is he also bound\nup with it.\nThese conceptions are familiar enough, so far as concerns\nthe physical universe. But if we conceive the same process\ncarried on into the relationship between the incarnate and the\ndiscarnate, it might produce a result something like what we\nsee in the scripts. Suppose that the discarnate mind has a\ndefinite plan and purpose of getting some rather complicated\nidea expressed, and that it is able by telepathy to influence\nthe incarnate minds of the automatists. Their minds mean-\nwhile are actively working and producing ; but what actually\nemerges in the script is to a great extent determined by the\ndiscarnate influence, which we may suppose is constantly select-\ning from their thoughts and turning their ideas into channels\nthat fit its own purposes. Where one phrase that has just been\nwritten in the script may suggest to the automatist's mind a\ngood many others naturally associated with it, the discarnate\ninfluence selects out of these something appropriate to the\nwhole cross-correspondence and gets that one expressed in\npreference to the others. The mental activity of the automatist\nthus gives a wider choice to the discarnate influence, and enables\nit to express itself in a great variety of ways, affording scope\nfor subtle and complicated connexions between the scripts.\nT\n\f2!J0 Alice Johnson. [part\nThere would here be a collaboration between the two minds\nsomewhat similar to that between the minds of a skilled hypnotist\nand his subject. The hypnotist does not exercise compulsion on\nhis subject or directly produce any mechanical effect on him ; but\ntheir two minds are working together towards the same end,\u2014both\ndesiring a certain result, e.g. of healing, to be produced. It is\nimpossible, with our present knowledge, to distinguish the parts\nthey play, but often the co-operation of the two minds and wills\nbrings about a result which, apparently, neither could produce\nalone.\nThere have been some remarkable cases where the scripts\nafford evidence of knowledge beyond the automatist's normal\nscope (apart from supernormal connexions with other scripts), as,\napparently, in Mrs. Holland's quotation from Ovid's Fasti\ngiven above, (p. 246), and in the references to \"Lethe\" by\nMrs. Piper and Mrs. Willett. The importance and interest of\nthese cases is not to be undervalued. But I think it possible\nthat those in which the automatist collaborates, in the way\nsuggested, with the spirit belong actually to a more advanced\ntype, and that what we are witnessing here is a new step in\nevolution, capable of great developments in the future.\nThere is, at least, one point on which all serious students\nof the subject seem to be agreed, viz. that these scripts do\nrepresent a new development ; if there is nothing in them be-\nyond telepathy between the automatists, it is at all events\ntelepathy of a more advanced and potent kind than has ever\nbeen met with before,\u2014something that both stimulates and\nrestrains, that both gives and withholds ;\nsomething that can\nkeep a definite and intelligent plan in mind over a long\nperiod of time and bring it to fruition at last,\u2014a fruition\nthat none of the persons concerned in the matter,\u2014neither the\nautomatists nor those to whom their scripts are entrusted,\u2014are\nable to foresee.\nAll this, however, might be attributed to the subliminal\nself of one of the automatists', and when I first brought for-\nward the theory of cross-correspondences,1\nI remarked that if\nthey were not the work of a spirit, which was very far from\nbeing proved, the most likely hypothesis was that they were\n1\nSee Proceeding, Vol. XXI., pp. 369-391.\n\flxiii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 291\nconcocted by the subliminal self of Mrs. Verrall. This\nhypothesis has been adopted since by our leading critics, \u2014by\nMr. Podmore ;\nimplicitly, as I understand, by Professor Pigou\n;\nand later by Mr, Bayfield in the discussion included in his\nreview of Mr. Podmore's last book in Proceedings, Part LXII.\nThe reason why the plan of cross-correspondences might\nwith some show of plausibility be attributed to Mrs. Verrall\nwas that hints of it appeared in her script (though they passed\nundetected by herself) some time before there were any dis-\ncoverable allusions to the subject in the scripts of other auto-\nmatists. This did not, of course, prove that the plan originated\nin Mrs. Verrall's mind, because it might have been transmitted\nto her telepathically by its originator ; but it did tend to show\nthat if any one of the automatists had originated it, she was\nprobably the one. Further, many of the cross-correspondences\nstarted in her script, so that it might be supposed in these\ncases that she was the telepathic agent from whom the others\nderived them. There are, however, other important cases in\nwhich the topic appeared first in the scripts of other auto-\nmatists, and there are even some in which Mrs. Arerrall's\nscript is not concerned at all ; so that we have now reached\na point where, on the supposition that the whole of the\ncross-correspondences are worked exclusively by the automatists,\nwe should have to assume that several of them, besides Mrs.\nVerrall, are capable of the task. Or else we should have to\nassume a sort of telepathic committee meeting . of the sub-\nliminal selves of the automatists, at which they scheme together\nand settle on their different parts.\nWe know that the subliminal self has considerable powers\nof romancing, of dramatic personation, of expressing ideas in a\nform altogether foreign to the supraliminal self; we often find\nan apparently deliberate obscurity of utterance, a veiling of\nmeaning, as if the subliminal wished to protect itself from\nsupraliminal interference by concealing its real aim. There\nseems, in fact, no limit to the degree of invention or of\ningenuity that it can display, in so far as the -performances of\nthe cmtomatist owning it are concerned. There is therefore\nnothing surprising in finding a romance, or an epic, or a\nrealistic personation, running through a long series of the scripts\nof a single automatist.\n\f292 Alice Johnson. [part\nIt has never been maintained, then, that the whole scheme\nof cross-correspondences, and many individual cases among them,\nwere beyond the inventive capacity of Mrs. Verrall's subliminal\nself. The difficulty lies in the execution, of the plan ; in the\nappropriate distribution of the parts among diiferent auto-\nmatists, who ex hypothesi are not in communication with each\nother except telepathically ; for to carry out such a plan would\nseem, as already said, to involve much greater powers of\ntelepathy than the experimental evidence so far obtained\nwould warrant us in assuming.\nNevertheless the question whether any mind beyond those\nof the automatists is concerned remains open ;\nspirit agency is\nnot yet proved conclusively. And before this is conclusively\nproved it may seem premature to discuss by what particular\nprocesses it might work, so that some justification is required\nfor the attempt to formulate so dubious a speculation as the\none here brought forward. In the end, of course, our case\nmust rest on concrete evidence. We have appealed to science\nand to science we must go to have our claims settled. But\nmy present argument is addressed in part to some of the\na priori objections to the hypothesis of spirit agency. People\nstart with certain theories of its nature and find that the facts\ndo not correspond. They are apt to think that the scripts\nare either produced by the influence, say, of Mr. Myers, or\nthey are not. They find in them passages which are rather\nsilly, rather incorrect, rather illiterate, and in every way unlike\nMr. Myers. They then say that Mr. Myers, as we knew him,\ncannot have produced those passages, and that therefore the\nscripts cannot be inspired by him. Even if they admit that some\npart may be inspired and some not, they generally conceive\nof the failure as being due to some mechanical difficulty of\ncontrol, the automatist being on this view a more or less\ncomplicated and delicate instrument, on which the spirit is a\nmore or less efficient and skilled performer.\nThis conception does not, to my mind, fit the facts. The\nscripts appear to me rather to represent the combined mental\nactivity of two or possibly more personalities. These com-\nbinations we call for convenience MyersP,\nMyersv ,\nMyersH, etc.\nIf we attempt roughly to allot functions to the members of\n\fLXIII.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 293\nthe combination, we may say that the automatist provides, as\nit were, ready-made material out of which the spirit weaves\nhis design, as the finished products of one trade may provide\nthe raw material for another. But we must never allow our-\nselves to suppose that any material metaphor can afford us\nmore than a hint of certain aspects only of the phenomenon.\nIn particular, we must keep in mind that we are dealing\nnot with physical but with mental facts, to which the laws of\narithmetic do not apply. For instance, if a given passage\nin a script is the product of two minds, it does not follow\nthat the more of one mind is in it, the less there is of the\nother.\nFinally, I would suggest, as a working hypothesis, that the\nbest evidence is to be looked for not from a suppression of the\nautomatist's personality, but rather from its free development\nin collaboration with a personality less limited than itself,\nbecause already freed from space and matter.\nAppendix A.\nThe \" Diamond Island \" Incident.\nIn my first report on the automatic writing of Mrs. Holland\nI quoted a piece of script produced by her in India on\nJanuary 17th, 1904,1\nthe concluding part of which was as\nfollows :\n\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers\"\n\u2014\n2\nDear old chap you have done so much in the past three\nyears \u2014I am cognisant of a great deal of it but with\nstrange gaps in my knowledge\u2014If I could only talk with\nyou\u2014If I could only help you with some advice\u2014I tried\nmore than once did it ever come\u2014There's so much to be\nlearnt from the Diamond Island experiment\n\u2014\nwell meaning but very ignorant\u2014bound to be tinged by\nthe channels through which they are conveyed\u2014Help me\n\u2014give me the help if not yet of your belief of your\nsympathy\u2014Take the message to you all I cannot yet fully\nand [ending in illegible scribble].\n1\nSee Proceedings, Vol. XXI. p. 235. -Henry V., Act iv. Scene iii.\n\f294 Alice Johnson. [part\nI stated in a foot-note to this script that I was unable to\nconjecture the meaning of the phrase \" Diamond Island experi-\nment ;\n\" and Mrs. Holland, who was accustomed to tell me of\nany facts within her knowledge that could throw light on the\nscript, had made no comment on it. Nor did it convey\nanything, as far as I could learn, to those who read the\nProceedings.\nOn Nov. 24th, 1908, Mrs. Holland, being in England, came\nto see me and told me among other things that she thought\nthis phrase must be an allusion to wireless telegraphy, since\nDiamond Island (which she believed to be near Diamond\nHarbour at the mouth of the Hoogli river) had a wireless\nstation on it. Some time later Mrs. Verrall, hearing of this\ninterpretation, pointed out to me that it followed that the\nwhole of this part of the script was intended to be addressed\nto Sir Oliver Lodge, and I then perceived that most of the\nmessage evidently was intended for him. But on communi-\ncating with him on the subject, though he recognised the\nappropriateness of the general tone and substance of the message,\nthe phrase \" Diamond Island \" awoke no chord in his memory.\nHe told me, however, that the Lodge-Muirhead system was at\nwork between Burma and the Andaman Islands, and he wrote\nto his friend and partner in this matter, Dr. Alexander Muir-\nhead, F.B.S., on Feb. 24, 1910, to ask:\nDo you remember whether any wireless experiments were conducted\nacross the mouth of the Hoogli or anywhere in that neighbourhood ?\nIf so, can you name the place 1 ... I should rather like to know\nwhether they tested the Andaman installation first at the Hoogli\n\u2014\nor wherever it was. They must have tried it somewhere ... Is\nthere a wireless station on the Hoogli, do you know?\nDr. Muirhead replied on Feb. 26, 1910:\nI believe Mr. Simpson, the man who put up the Andaman Wire-\nless, has been conducting some experiments between a pilot boat\n. . . and Calcutta. . . . The Andamans circuit is between Diamond\nIsland, at the mouth of the Irrawaddy in Burma, and Port Blair . . .\nThus it appears that Mrs. Holland's conjecture of a con-\nnexion between Diamond Island and wireless telegraphy was\n\fLXIII.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 295\ncorrect, but that she had located it wrongly, viz., at the mouth\nof the Hoogli, whereas it is really situated at the mouth of the\nIrrawaddy, in Burma. From enquiries made with Sir Oliver\nLodge's help, I find that towards the end of August, 1904,\noperations were begun for linking up the Settlement of Port\nBlair in the Andaman Islands with the general telegraph system\nof India by establishing wireless telegraph stations at Port Blair\nand at Diamond Island, which was already connected by cable\nto the mainland. The distance to be spanned was 305*2 miles.\nThe system chosen was the Lodge-Muirhead, with which pre-\nliminary experiments had already been carried on for three\nmonths in the early part of 1904; the 150 feet masts were\nmade in the Calcutta workshops, the scientific apparatus being\nsupplied by the Lodge-Muirhead Co. in England. The work,\nwhich was executed by the Indian Government Telegraph\nDepartment, went on for several months, the circuit being in\ncomplete working order first on Feb. 10th, 1905.\nThis installation was an event of some importance in the\nhistory of wireless telegraphy, for it was one of the first\ninstallations in the British Empire connecting different land\nstations ; the main developments of wireless telegraphy having\npreviously been for the purpose of connecting shore stations\nwith ships.\nSir Oliver Lodge of course knew of the Burma-Andamans\ninstallation, but had entirely forgotten that the Burma end of\nthe installation is on Diamond Island 1\n(which is a very small\nisland, not marked on most atlases).\nWhen I questioned Mrs. Holland about her knowledge of\nthese matters, she told me that she had known at or about\nthat time that the Lodge-Muirhead system of wireless telegraphy\nwas being experimented with in India, but she could not say\nwhether it was before or after the date of the script, which\nhad conveyed no meaning to her when it was written.\nIn reply to a question what normal means of acquiring\ninformation about experiments on Diamond Island existed in\nIndia in January, 1904, Mr. M. G. Simpson, of the Govern-\nment Telegraph Department, who had superintended the setting\n1\nFrom a letter on the subject which he has recently found, it appears that\nthe geographical fact did actually come under his eye, but awakened no conscious\nattention, in \"March, 1903.\n\f296 Alice Johnson. [part\nup of the installation, wrote to Sir Oliver Lodge from Calcutta\non April 18th, 1910 :\n... In 1902 I was at home, hut some of my officers did some\nwireless experiments in July at Diamond Harbour. They were not\nvery successful, but a paragraph or two appeared in the local press\nabout them. I came out here in December 1902, and in 1903,\nJanuary, I put up a little temporary station at Sangor Island at the\nmouth of the river and another on a small Government steamer, the\n\"Guide,\" and we worked out to the Sandheads where the pilot\nvessel is stationed 40 miles from Sangor. This was reported in due\ncourse and found its Avay into the papers. During the whole of\n1903 there was a weekly financial paper, Capital, in Calcutta con-\nstantly jibing at Government for their dilatoriness with regard to\nwireless and urging them to come to terms with the Marconi Co.\nIn Jan., '04, apparatus began to arrive from Elmers End [Messrs.\nMuirhead & Co.'s works in Kent] and in February we started out\nfrom Calcutta to try and link up Diamond Island with the Andamans.\nI can't be quite certain now, but I think it is more than probable\ninformation of this intention appeared in the local press. At first\nwe established communication over a short distance, Elephant Point\nto Amherst, and it was not till April, 1904, any actual experimenting\nwas done on Diamond Island.\nThe script referring to the Diamond Island experiment was\nwritten, as stated above, in January, 1904 ; but from\nMr. Simpson's letter it appears not impossible that Mrs. Holland\nmay already have seen references to the subject in one of the\nIndian papers. She herself knows nothing in detail of wireless\ntelegraphy, and she could not remember that any of the friends\nshe was accustomed to see at that time had spoken to her of the\nsubject or took any interest in it. It happened, however, that\nshe had heard a lecture by Marconi in 1901 or 1902, and had\nrather regretted that an Italian was (as she erroneously sup-\nposed) ahead of Englishmen in the subject. Consequently she\nwas pleased when she heard of the Lodge-Muirhead system being\nused. She wrote to me on March 19 th, 1910:\nI am sorry that I cannot be certain, after the lapse of so many\nyears, if I heard or read any mention of the Lodge-Muirhead system\nbefore writing the script of Jan. 17th, 1904.\nMy impression is that I must have seen some newspaper reference\n\flxjii.] Third Report on Mrs. Holland's Script. 207\nto it, since I ani as sure as I can be, when dealing with anything\nso far away, that I did not hear any conversation about it.\nI left India in April, 1904, and returned there more than two\nyears later.\nMy ignorance of the matter is shown by my belief\u2014until just\nlately\u2014that Diamond Island was near Diamond Harbour in Bengal,\ninstead of in Lower Burma, where it is really situated.\nIt is clear then that Mrs. Holland's reference to the \" Diamond\nIsland experiment \" cannot be regarded as strictly evidential,\nsince she may have had normal knowledge of it.\nThe script nevertheless is remarkably appropriate in several\nrespects as a message to Sir Oliver Lodge. It was written on\nJan. 1 7th, 1904, the third anniversary of Mr. Myers's death,\nwhich was also the end of Sir Oliver Lodge's three years'\nPresidency of the S.P.B. I take the phrase\u2014\" you have done\nso much in the past three years \" to refer to this. The tone\nof affectionate intimacy running through the whole script is\nalso especially appropriate.\nMrs. Holland knew the date of Mr. Myers's death and that\nSir Oliver Lodge had been President of the S.P.E. in 1903 ;\nbut when I asked her if she knew in January, 1904, that\nhe was an intimate friend of Mr. Myers's and that he had been\nPresident for three years, she replied\n:\nFeb. 20th, 1910.\n... I did not realise then that Sir Oliver Lodge was an intimate\nfriend of Mr. Myers's. There were references to him, of course, in\n[Human Personality], especially in reference to early experiments with\nMrs. Piper ; but I did not know there was a friendship of long\nstanding, and I certainly did not know in Jan., 1904, that he became\nPresident of the S.P.E. after Mr. Myers's death. I am surprised to\nhear that he held it for three years, \u2014I thought it had been for\ntwo ... It never struck me before that this message was to Sir\nOliver Lodge. . . .\nIt is further significant that, as Sir Oliver Lodge tells me,\nMr. Myers had been keenly interested in his work in wireless\ntelegraphy and it was while with Mr. Myers and stimulated\nby him that he devised the fundamental plan for \" tuning \" which\nin some form or another is necessarily used in all systems of\nwireless telegraphy and was first patented by him in 1897.\n\f298 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe term \" syntouy \" was invented for him by Mr. Myers and Dr.\nA. T. Myers. Sir Oliver Lodge had, as is well known, been ex-\nperimenting for years on the theoretical side of the subject,\nand it was partly, or even largely, his discoveries between 1888\nand 1894 which, in the energetic hands of Mr. Marconi, in\n1896 and onwards, led to the development of wireless telegraphy\nfor practical purposes. Mr. Myers had been much interested in\nthis development and anxious that the results of his friend's work\nshould not be unduly exploited by others.\nWhile the script is thus thoroughly characteristic of the\nrelation between Mr. Myers and Sir Oliver Lodge, the fact\nthat it is connected in point of time with the first important\ncross-correspondence between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall\n\u2014\nthe \" Selwyn Text Incident \"\n1\n\u2014seems to lend weight to the\nsupposition that what we may call the \" Diamond Island script\n\"\nmay have been at least partially inspired by the surviving\npersonality of F. W. H. Myers.\nI may add that the patent referred to above for \"Improve-\nments in Syntonised Telegraphy without Line Wires \" is the\nimportant one which, by Mr. J ustice Parker's judgment delivered\nin the Chancery Division of the High Court on April 28th,\n1911, has just been renewed to Sir Oliver Lodge for another\nterm of seven years.\nAppendix B.\nA further detail in the \" Sevens \" Cross-correspondence.2\nIn the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research\nfor March, 1911, Professor Hyslop comments at length on a\nnumber of points in this case, and in the midst of his discussion\ngives an interesting interpretation of certain words spoken in\nthe waking stage of Mrs. Piper's trance on May 8th, 1908.\nAfter an apparent attempt to translate the Latin- verses of the\nTavern Club motto, in which the only word audible to Mr. Dorr\nwas \" Habit,\" she said\n\" We are Seven\nI said Clock !

Prof. Hyslop has\nnow ascertained that there is a clock on the staircase of\nthe Tavern Club leading up to the dining-room, and that at\nbanquets, when there are no guests present, it is the habit of\nthe members to assemble downstairs, and there at a fixed\nhour to sing the Latin verses, and then go upstairs to the\ndining-room. It seems, therefore, that the words, \" Clock ! tick,\ntick, tick ! Stairs.\" might appropriately have been uttered\nby Hodgsonp among the reminiscences evoked by the verses.\nWhether or not Mrs. Piper had any normal knowledge of this\nclock it is, of course, impossible to say.\nAppendix C.\nSome further Cross-correspondences between Mrs. Piper s Trance\nand the Scripts of other Automatists.\nAs stated above, four sittings with Mrs. Piper were held by\nMr. Dorr and six by Miss Pope, during the period Dec. 7, 1908,\nto March 1, 1909. At only four of Miss Pope's sittings were\nattempts made to send \" messages \" to the other automatists, and\nsome of these were merely repetitions of \" messages \" attempted\nin Mr. Dorr's previous series. Part of Miss Pope's record of\nDec. 9, 1908, and an extract from that of Dec. 21, 1908, are\ngiven above, pp. 233 and 254, and part of her record of\nJan. 13, 1909, is as follows:\n(MyerSp communicating.)\nLUX UBE\nLux UBE\n[These three letters, especially the E, look like an attempt to\nwrite Greek letters, which had been attempted earlier in\nthe sitting]\nLux\n[Soon afterwards came another attempt to write Greek words,\nwith the explanation:]\nThe first Greek words were strength, star, to give light, to\nhelp free souls\n\f300 Alice Johnson.

W. H. Myers. As in his earlier series, the\nresults obtained appeared at the time to be incoherent, rambling,\nand worthless, but have turned out on further investigation to\n1\nCf. \"The lark is on the wing,\" written at Miss Pope's sitting of Dec. 9, 1908.\n2\nTrans.

The most important parts of them\nconsist of connexions with later scripts of Mrs. Willett,\nand with the more or less contemporary scripts of Mrs. and\nMiss Verrall, as described in Mrs. Verrall's paper above\n(pp. 176-90). Mrs. Verrall deals only with the classical\nallusions ; I supplement her account with a few further corre-\nspondences, which add to the cumulative evidence for connexion\nbetween these Piper sittings and Miss Verrall's scripts.\nIn a sitting with Mrs. Piper held by Mr. Dorr on March 1,\n1909, certain messages were said to have been oiven to Miss\nVerrall, as follows :\nTell Piddington chirades. H.\nG. B. D. What is that word 1\nCharades. 1\nHelen Trailing Trail Trellis.\nG. B. D. Is that word \"trailing;\"?\nYes. Very good.\nSea Season Polling. Roll Waves.\nI got these through Helen V.\n(G.

[part\nIV.\nNOTE ON THE CBOSS-COBBESPONDENCE \" CUP.\"\nBeing a suggestion as to the meaning and source of the word\n\"Cup \" employed successfully as a message for cross-correspondence\nby Mrs. Pipers trance-personalities in the sittings of 1907.\nBy MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\nIn the majority of the \" Concordant Automatisms \" resulting\nfrom the experiments with Mrs. Piper during her visit to\nEngland in 1906-7, described by Mr. Piddington in Proceedings,\nVol. XXII., the leading word was framed by one or more of\nthe automatists concerned in a literary setting, so that it\nemerged as part of a poetical quotation, or as the subject of\na more or less elaborate literary allusion. Thus in the Con-\ncordant Automatisms grouped round the idea of \" Light in\nWest \" (Section xix.) and culminating in references to East and\nWest by three automatists on April 8, 1907, Dante, Browning,\nand Tennyson were laid under contribution. Were this habit\nconfined to the scripts of Mrs. Holland, my daughter and\nmyself, it would hardly require comment. Those scripts are\nfull of literary reminiscences, easily accounted for by the previous\neducation and the general tastes and interests of the automatists.\nThe employment of a quotation to introduce a transmitted word\nmay be due to some necessity to conceal the intention from\nthe normal consciousness, always ready to interfere and inhibit\nphenomena where the script is produced without trance.\nBut with Mrs. Piper the case is otherwise. Neither her\nprevious history nor her general tastes and interests lead us\nto expect literary allusions in her trance utterances. Nor are\nsuch literary allusions found in the records of her earlier\nsittings. Their introduction is a new and noteworthy occur-\n\flxiii.] Note on the Cross-Correspondence \" Cup.\" 305\nrence, and only conies into prominence in the English\nsittings.\nFor this, various explanations may be suggested. The ex-\npectation of the sitters is a factor not to be omitted. The\ntype of mind, again, of the other automatic writers deliberately\nbrought into close connexion with the trance-consciousness of\nMrs. Piper may be supposed to have produced some effect upon\nthat consciousness. Moreover, Mrs. Piper had opportunity of\nreading the report of my script {Proceedings, Vol. XX.) and\nso of acquainting herself with the sort of phraseology which\nwas presumably to be expected from Myersv. And my ques-\ntion addressed to MyersP, as to his associations with the words\nauTos ovpai'og ciku\/uoop, directed the attention of the trance-\ncontrols towards literary subjects. Whatever explanation is\nadopted, the fact remains that in these English sittings Mrs.\nPiper's trance-personalities showed an acquaintance with English\npoetry never shown by them before, and often associated that\npoetry with words selected for transmission, using it as a sort\nof framework for the transmitted phrase, much in the same\nfashion as did the other automatists concerned. Not only\nwere there allusions in the Piper trance to Browning and\nTennyson in the course of references to the \" answer to the\nLatin message \" which emerged amid similar allusions in the\nHolland and Verrall scripts, but in one case (Section xviii.)\ntwo lines of Wordsworth suggested a group of \" cross-cor-\nrespondences,\" some of which were successfully reproduced by\nanother automatist, but without any trace of the quotation\nwhich accompanied them in the Piper script\n:\n\" I wandered lonely as a Cloud\nThat floats on high o'er Vales and Hills.\"\n1\nAn examination of the series of Concordant Automatisms\ndescribed by Mr. Piddington shows that among the contem-\nporary successes 2\nonly three emerged without a literary setting\n1\nMy point here is not whether or not Mrs. Piper was normally acquainted\nwith Wordsworth's poem. That may very well have been the case. The\nnoteworthy point is the selection in her trance for cross-correspondence of a\ngroup of words combined by literary associations.\n2\n1 exclude \"Celestial Halcyon Days\" (Section x.), where Myersp referred\nto an expression in an earlier script of mine, not to a contemporary ex-\nperiment.\nU\n\f306 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nfurnished by one or other of the automatists concerned, namely,\nthose described in Sections v., xiii., and xxii. In the case of\nSection v., \" Library, my own name, and Mrs. Sidgwick's,\"\nthese three ideas were woven together, both in Mrs. Piper's\nscript and my own, into a story, untrue indeed and improbable,\nbut with a certain superficial plausibility which, serving as a\nframework, may perhaps have enabled the triple combination\nto appear in both scripts. Only two cases remain in which\nthe Concordant Automatisms emerged, so to say, bare, with\nvery little setting or decoration. I have nothing further to\nadd on the subject of Section xxii., \" Laus Deo,\" but some-\nthing may, I think, be learnt from a further consideration of\nthe cross-correspondence on \" Cup,\" described in Section xiii.\n(Proceedings, Vol. XXII. pp. 179-192).\nThe word \" Cup \" was announced as a cross-correspondence\nby Hodgsonp on March 18, 1907 (p. 179); the word \"Cup\"\nappeared in Mrs. Holland's script (p. 191) on the morning of\nMarch 19; 1\nand on the evening of March 19, a Cup was drawn\nand the word written in my script (p. 181). On no other\noccasion during the period covered by these sittings with\nMrs. Piper did the word \" Cup \" occur in either Mrs. Holland's\nscript or mine. In neither of those scripts is the word \" Cup\n\"\nthe subject of a literary quotation. In Mrs. Holland's script, it\nis applied to a stone cavity, eventually intended to hold water.\nIn my script the Cup is said to be of silver ; it is drawn with\na stem, foot and bowl, and no handle. Nor is there any\nindication of literary allusion in the announcement of a cross-\ncorrespondence by Hodgsoiip. But two English poems are\nreferred to several times during the sittings with Mrs. Piper,\neither of which is easily associated with the word \" Cup,\" a\ncup being prominent in both. FitzGerald's poem, The Rubaiyat\nof Omar Khayyam, centres round the \" Cup \" which is to be\nfilled with \" Ruby Vintage,\" and the word occurs eight times\nin the seventy-five stanzas of the first edition. In Browning's\nRabbi ben Ezra the speaker's meditations culminate in the\ncomparison of man with a \" Cup \" ; this image is carried\n1\nThe water drops have not as yet begun to wear the stone\u2014After the cup\nhas been worn in the stone the falling drops can be collected\u2014but not\nbefore\u2014 At present there is only a damp spot\u2014inadequate for thirst\nquenching.\n\flxiii.] Note on the Gross-Correspondence \" Cup.\" 307\nthrough the concluding eight of the thirty-two stanzas, and the\nword \" cup \" occurs three times.\nAllusions in the Piper script to Omar Khayyam are made\non Feb. 12, 13, March 12, 19 and 20, 1907. On Feb-\nruary 12, in a would-be evidential communication from a\nsupposed dead friend of the sitter, a spontaneous reference was\nmade to the poem. The allusion was not at first understood\nbut was later recognised, after it had been described as a\nquotation from the Book of a Dreamer in a Persian Garden.\nOn Feb. 13, Mr. Piddington being the sole sitter, further\nremarks were made about a \" Persian Garden,\" which was\nnow said to be a cross-correspondence for Mrs. Verrall devised\nby HodgsonP with the concurrence of MyersP. The word\n\" Paradise,\" pointing to a passage in F. W. H. Myers's\nFragments of Prose and Poetry (p. 5), had occurred in the\ntrance on January 30, when I was the sitter, and may have\nled on, by an easy association of ideas, to the selection\nof \" Persian Garden,\" as a cross-correspondence for transmission\nto me. The word \" Paradise \" recurred on March 6 as a\nsubject of cross-correspondence, and was shortly followed by\nthe word \" Bird,\" a connexion more popular than literary.\nBoth words occur in Omar Khayyam :\n\" Bird \" twice in stanza\nvii., and \" Paradise \" in stanzas xi. and xii. But no allusion\nto the poem was suggested by the controls on Feb. 13 or\nMarch 6. On March 12, however, Omar Khayyam unmistak-\nably again makes an appearance, again not as a subject for\ncross-correspondence, but as an attempt at a verifiable remi-\nniscence from HodgsonP , addressed to the sitter, Mr. John\nRussell. The poem reappears in Mrs. Busseil's sittings on\nMarch 19 and 20.1\nI quote all extracts bearing on these\ndefinite allusions to the poem.\nExtract from Record of Sitting with Mrs. Piper held on February 12,\n1907.\n(Present : Mr. Piddington in charge and Mr. X. as sitter\n;\nZ communicating :)\n[At a previous sitting on February 11, the sitter Mr. X. had asked\nthe communicator, Z, if he remembered a certain friend whose foreign\n1\nNeither Mr. Russell nor Mrs. Russell was introduced by name.

The words, \" dreamed about this\nlife\u2014until he had drunk the wine\" (on Feb. 12), and again\n\"drinking up the wine of life\" (on March 19), point to the\nsecond stanza, and especially to its concluding line :\n\" Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky\nI heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,\n'\nAwake my Little ones, and fill the Cup\nBefore Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.'\n\"\nOn March 20, MyersP definitely claims that HodgsonP has\nsucceeded in conveying to me a line from a Persian poem.\nThe name Omar fixes the allusion, and the words, obviously\nintended to represent a line from the poem, may with certainty\nbe referred to the conclusion of the third stanza :\n\" You know how little while we have to stay,\nAnd, once departed, may return no more.\" 1\nIt may therefore be regarded as certain that allusions to\nFitzGerald's poem, probably to particular stanzas, were made by\nthe trance-personalities in Mrs. Piper's sittings on Feb. 12,\nMarch 12, March 19, and March 20, 1907.\nThe allusions to Browning's Rabbi ben Ezra were on April 24\nand 29, and May 6 and 8, 1907.

Before deciding whether the \" Cup \" of March 18,\n1907, was associated with either or both, we must examine\ncarefully the statement in the trance of that day.\nAs is described by Mr. Piddington,1\nthe words claimed to\ncome from HodgsonP, and were thus written\n:\n\" Cup used\nC C\"\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XXII. p. 179, Section xiii.\n\f314 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nThe word \" used \" is marked as not certain in Mr. Pid-\ndington's account of the sitting, but I have myself little\ndoubt that it is correct. Mrs. Sidgwick points out that the\nword is almost exactly like the word \" used \" in other\nplaces, and says that she would be satisfied with the reading\n\" Cup used C.C.\" if it made any sense in the context. I\nfeel, with Mr. Piddington, the difficulty, arising from an\nacquaintance with the usual phraseology of the Piper script,\nof attributing to the controls the elliptical or condensed con-\nstruction required if the meaning of \" Cup used C C \" is to\nbe \" Cup has been (or, 'is to be ') used as a cross-correspond-\nence.\" This objection would disappear if the word \" used\n\"\ncould be regarded as forming part, not of the control's remark,\nbut of the phrase to be transmitted. I should punctuate thus,\n\" Cup used \"\n; then\u2014after a pause\u2014\" C C,\"\u2014the explanation\n\" cross-correspondence \" being appended to the phrase \" Cup\nused,\" to show that the two words just written were a message\nfor transmission to other automatists. There would be no\ndifficulty in the selection by the controls of that particular\ncombination, if any meaning attached to it.\n1\nThe question\nthus arises,\u2014is there any point in the addition\n(1) of a word following upon Cup;\n(2) of the particular word \" used.\"\nTo both these questions I think that an affirmative answer\ncan be given.\n(1) A reference to the sitting of January 30th, 1907, shows\na reason for avoiding the single word \" Cup \" as a subject for\ntransmission to me. I was the sitter on January 30th, and\namong other words, said to have occurred in my earlier script,\n\" Chalice \" was mentioned. This reminded me, as I noted at\nthe time, of an allusion in my earlier script to the Latin Cyathus,\nCup, the connexion of which with Christian ritual I had quite\nrecently been investigating. Of this I said nothing at the\nsitting, but shortly afterwards \" Cup \" was mentioned with-\nout context by MyersP. As therefore my attention had on\nJanuary 30th been called to the word \"Cup,\" that word alone\nwas not a good choice for a cross-correspondence with me. A\n1\nSee Proceedings, Vol. XXII. p. 287, where a particular kind of sea and sky,\n\"Sea and Sky Blue,\" is indicated as the subject of a cross-correspondence.\n\flxiii.] Note on the Cross-Correspondence \" Cup.\" 315\nsimilar difficulty had arisen in another case.\n1\nThe word\n\" Wreath,\" intended for a cross-correspondence, had been\nmentioned in my presence on January 21, 1907; on Jan-\nuary 23 Rector apologised to Mr. Piddington for the blunder,\nand on March 4 MyersP, after hearing that \" Laurel wreath\n\"\nhad appeared in my script, explained that \" laurel \" had been\nadded to \" wreath \" to make the cross-correspondence evidential.\nIt is thus consistent with the previous conduct of the controls,\nsince the word \" Cup \" had been mentioned in my presence, to\nadd another word when employing \" Cup \" as a subject for cross-\ncorrespondence.\n(2) Without going so far as to say that \"Cup used\" recalls\nRabbi ben Ezra to a student of Browning, I yet assert that if\nit is desired to distinguish by a single epithet the cup of ben\nEzra from the cup of Omar, used is well chosen. The distinction\nbetween the two conceptions of a cup lies just in the use of the\nvessel, and the word use is introduced into one poem and not\ninto the other. Omar's cup is to be filled with \" Life's Liquor\n\"\n(ii.), with \"Wine Eed Wine\" (vi.), with what \"clears To-Day of\npast regrets \" (xx.) ; it is to drown the memory that \" without\nasking \" we are \" hurried hither \" and \" hurried hence \" (xxx).\n;\nthe \" Ruby A^intage \" is to be drunk \" with old Khayyam,\" and,\n\" when the Angel with his darker Draught draws up,\" we are\nto \" take that \" without shrinking (xlviii.). Rabbi ben Ezra\non the contrary bids us look not \" clown but up ! to uses of a\ncup\" (30); and asks Cod \"who mouldest men ... to take and\nuse Thy work\" (32). It would be difficult to find a single\nword better suited than \" used \" to distinguish between the two\ncups and at the same time to recall the culminating stanzas of\nBrowning's poem.\nA further point for consideration is whether by an examina-\ntion of the script of the other two automatists concerned in the\ncross-correspondence any reason is found for associating the Cup\nof March 18, 1907, with either Omar Khayyam or Rabbi ben\nEzra. Neither the slowly-forming stone cup of Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 19, 1907, nor the silver cup of my script of\nthe same day, represents the earthenware cup of Omar and ben\nJ\nSee Proceedings, Vol. XXII.

W. Verrall. [part\nEzra, though the ultimate purpose\u2014\" thirst quenching \"\n\u2014of the\nuncompleted cup described in her script\n1\nrecalls the purpose of\nBrowning's cup,\u2014to slake the thirst of the Master when the\ncup has been made perfect as planned. In my script I find two\npoints where it is possible to see a connexion with Browning's\npoem, but neither is certain. My scripts of March 19 and 20,\n1907, are plainly intended to be continuous,\n2\nand the second\nscript aims, as Mr. Piddington has pointed out, \" at giving\nexpression to one thing St John's College, Cambridge.\"\nIt reaches this goal \" by devious bye-paths,\" in the course of\nwhich it passes from the Feast of St. John the Baptist to the\nFeast of St. John the Evangelist, kept at St. John's College,\nCambridge, thus perhaps recalling the \" festal board \" of Rabbi\nben Ezra (30). The second point of possible connexion is\ncontained in a later script of March 26, 1907, of which I\nhere quote the whole\n:\nWrite again later\u2014out of doors\u2014but now say this :\nwhat turns the wheel, the four-spoked wheel of time 1\n[drawing of a four-spoked wheel] from left to right revolving.\nWith this script may be compared the phrases in stanzas\n26 and 27 of Rabbi ben Ezra, \"feel why time spins fast,\" and\n\" time's wheel runs back or stops.\" There is no reason, how-\never, as far as I know, why the wheel of time should be four-\nspoked.\nNo one of these scripts is sufficiently distinctive to be applied\nto Rabbi ben Ezra, if taken alone. But I should not expect to\nfind accidentally within nine days, in the scripts of three differ-\nent automatists, four references presenting such parallelism to\nthe ideas and language of Rabbi ben Ezra, as is presented by the\nfour in question, which are summarized in the following tabular\nform\n:\nDate.

It was not reproduced in my script, nor were\nany of the cross-correspondences from Rahbi ten Ezra, mentioned\non April 24, 1907, successfully transmitted by the trance-\npersonalities. \" Cup,\" however, which is a word in the poem,\nwas transmitted, as above described, but when it was mentioned\nin Mrs. Piper's trance on March 18, 1907, it was not connected\nwith Browning or assigned to any specified automatist.\nSome confirmation of the view set out in this paper is\nsupplied by other evidence from the sittings with Mrs. Piper\nin February and March, 1907. From these sittings I infer\nthat the \"Cup used,\" of March 18, whatever it may have\nmeant, was not the cup of Omar Khayyam. The sitting of\nFeb. 1 2 as well as the immediately preceding sitting of March 1\n2\nand the two succeeding sittings of March 19 and 20 contain\nallusions to Omar KJiayyam\u2014allusions, it may be said in\npassing, that show an acquaintance with the poem at once more\nintimate and less directly expressed than would be expected\nwere the source in Mrs. Piper's own mind. Words associated\nwith the poem are selected for transmission. The connexion\nof the word \" cup \" with FitzGerald's poem could not fail to be\nknown to one who associated with that poem \" Dawn,\" \" Wine\nof Life,\" and \" no man ever returns,\" etc., but no such association\n1\nThere have also been quotations from the poem in other scripts : on January\n7, 1904, MyersH cpaotecl from stanza 25 (Proceedings, Vol. XXI. p. 215)\n:\n\"All I could never be\n\u2014\nAll men refused in me\nThis I was worth to God whose wheel the pitcher shaped,\"\nand on Oct. 20, 1906, H.

W. Verrall. [part\nis suggested for the \" Cup used C C.\" Even had the suggested\ncross-correspondence consisted of the single word \" Cup,\" I should\nbe indisposed, under the circumstances, to connect it with\nOmar Khayyam. When we remember that between \" Cup\n\"\nand \" C C \" was inserted a word wholly inappropriate to Omar\nKhayyam's cup, I think it is clear that on March 18 there\nwas no intention on the part of HodgsonP to suggest any\nassociation between \" Cup used C C \" and the cup of Omar\nKhayyam.1\nThis is not the place to discuss in detail whether there\nis a historical link between the two poems, or whether a\nstudent of literature would naturally pass from the thought of\nEitzGerald's Omar Khayyam to the thought of Browning's\nRabbi ben Ezra. The first edition of Omar Khayyam was\npublished in 1859, and, though not generally known till some\ntime later, it was enthusiastically praised and eagerly read by\na small group, among whom were Swinburne and Dante\nEossetti. In the autumn of 1861 Eobert Browning came to\nlive in London, and often saw Eossetti, who had been a friend\nof his for some years. It is probable that a poem which had\nso strongly impressed Eossetti was not unknown to Browning.\nIn 1864 Rabbi ben Ezra was published in the volume called\nDramatis Personcc. If any one reads and compares the two\npoems, noticing especially the treatment in both of the image\nof the Fotter, he will find it difficult to believe that the work\nof the earlier poet was unknown to the later poet. The\ncomparison of man to the Eotter's Clay is not new ; as Eitz-\nGerald reminds us, it is found \" in the Literature of the\nWorld from the Hebrew Brophets to the present time \" ; it\nis as appropriately employed by the Hebrew as by the Fersian\nthinker. But the form of stanzas 2 6 and 27 of Rabbi\nben Ezra suggests that the view there represented is not only\nan expression of personal belief, but a refutation of some\nexisting theory, and a comparison with stanzas xxxvi. and\nxxxvii. of Omar Khayyam suggests whose that theory was.\n1\nThe view that \"Cup used\" is, in fact, a reminiscence of Rabbi ben Ezra\nneed not imply a deliberate reticence on the part of the controls. The phrase\nmay have been a first emergence, provoked by the interest of the experimenters\nin Browning, of allusions to Rabbi ben Ezra, definitely formulated on\nApril 24, 1907.\n\flxiii.] Note on the Cross-Correspondence \"Cwp\" 319\nOmar Khayyam says that he \" watch'd the Potter thumping\nhis wet Clay,\" and thereupon he urges his auditor\n\u2014\n\" Ah, fill the Cup ;\n\u2014what boots it to repeat\nHow Time is slipping underneath our Feet\n:\nUnborn To-morrow and dead Yesterday,\nWhy fret about them if To-day be sweet\n!\n\"\nKabbi ben Ezra bids his auditor\n\u2014\n\" note that Potter's wheel,\nThat metaphor!\"\nand goes on\n:\n\" Thou, to whom fools propound,\nWhen the wine makes its round,\nSince life fleets, all is change ; the Past gone, seize To-day\n!\nFool! all that is, at all,\nLasts ever, past recall\n;\nEarth changes, but thy soul and Clod stand sure.\"\nIf accident, and not acquaintance with FitzGerald's poem,\nproduced so apt a criticism of Omar's theory of life and ex-\npressed it by a different interpretation of Omar's metaphor,\nthe coincidence is remarkable.

[part\nV.\nMISS VERKALL'S SCRIPT OF MARCH 16, 1908:\nA CORRECTION AND AN ADDITION.\nBy MRS. A. W. VERRALL.\nThe script in question is quoted and commented on in\nProceedings, Vol. XXIV. pp. 297, 298. It runs as follows:\nLa vie est breve\nUn peu d'espoir\nUn peu de reve\nEt puis bonsoir.\nThe end of the story.\nLike a crimson petalled rose the rose of Sharon.\nWhen the proof was sought he told them that the only means of\nobtaining it was to persevere in the attempt to prove the connexion.\nGautier and Hugo those together types to be compared.\nUnless there is a possibility of setting the two side by side there\nwould be no opportunity.\nis is the \u2014\nnow at his ease\n[drawing of flower] note this flower.\nWhen I wrote the paper on \" A New Group of Experi-\nmenters \" in Proceedings, I thought that the two-stanza poem,\nof which the second verse appears in the above H. V. script,\nwas by Victor Hugo. This, however, is not the case. On\nthe first occasion\u2014many years ago\u2014when I made the acquaint-\nance of the poem, it was attributed to Victor Hugo, and\nhaving never had reason to question the authorship, I accepted\nthat statement without further consideration. But on being\ninformed of my mistake, soon after the publication of Proceedings,\nPart LX., I took some pains to ascertain the authorship of\nthe poem. This, with some difficulty, I have done.\n\fLXIIL] Miss Verrall's Script of March 16, 1908. 321\nThe poem is quoted in Du Maimer's Trilby (published\n1894), which also contains an English poem based upon it.\nBut the author is not there named. In one well-known book\nof reference the poem is quoted incorrectly\u2014the first and\nthird lines of the two stanzas being transposed, so that\n\" amour \" and \" haine \" appear in different stanzas, and the\npoem begins \" La vie est breve \"\u2014and in the same book it\nis incorrectly attributed to Alfred de Musset. In 1902 the\ntwo stanzas were set to music by Madame Teresa del Eiego\nand published, together with an English version by the composer.\nMadame Teresa del Eiego has set and translated the trans-\nposed arrangement of the two stanzas, though her song is\nnamed, \" La vie est vaine,\" from what, in her arrangement,\nis the first line of the second stanza. But she has printed\non the fly-leaf, besides her own version, the original lines by\nLeon de Montenaeken and the \" author's own English version.\"\nHere the two stanzas are not transposed, but run as in my\npaper in Proceedings with \" amour \" and \" haine \" in the first\nstanza, which begins \" La vie est vaine.\" A third stanza is\nadded which runs as follows\n:\n\" La vie est telle\nQue Dieu la fit\n;\nEt telle quelle . . .\nElle suffit.\"\nThis third stanza was, to the best of our belief, unknown\nto the automatists concerned in the cross-correspondence, as\nwell as to me, until, in the course of enquiries as to the\nauthorship of the lines, Miss Mac came across the words set\nto music and wrote to me on April 30, 1911. The further\ninformation thus obtained, though it shows that what I called\na \" two-stanza poem by Hugo \" is in fact by Montenaeken\nand contains a third stanza, does not affect the correspondence\nbetween the H. V. and Mac scripts, nor the complementary\nnature of that correspondence. For on March 16, 1908, an\nH. V. script, containing internal evidence that it was incom-\nplete and required supplementing, quoted the second stanza\nof a French poem, of which the first stanza appeared\nindependently, three months later, in the script of some\nnew automatic writers whose script, by order of their\nx\n\f322 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\n\" communicators,\" was sent to me as containing messages\nintended for me. To all the automatists concerned the two\nstanzas of the poem, and two only, were known, as they were\nto me ;\nby one automatist, my daughter, as by me, the author-\nwas thought to be Victor Hugo.\nBut it will be observed that the H. V. script does not\nattribute the lines to Hugo. Taking that script as it stands,\nwithout preconceptions of any kind, there is no more reason\nto attribute the verses to Hugo than to Gautier. Both those\nnames appear later in the same script, and neither is claimed\nas the author of the opening lines. But, believing as I did,\nthat the opening lines were a quotation from Hugo, I naturally\nsupposed the lines thus quoted to represent the poem of Hugo\nlater alluded to in the script, as representing a type to be\ncompared with a poem of Gautier. Of Gautier's work I was\ncompletely ignorant, as was my daughter. I looked through a\ncollection of his poems\u2014which I do not possess\u2014to see if I\ncould find a poem comparable with \" La vie est breve,\" but I\ncould find none.\nSo much for my mistaken statement ; I pass to the con-\nsideration of the H. V. script. It is clear that the inclusion\nof these lines in a script which also suggests a comparison of\nthe types of Hugo and Gautier would be completely justified\nif, for instance, there existed poems by Hugo and Gautier\ncharacteristic of their respective authors and referring to the\ntopic which is the subject of the poem whose second stanza is\nquoted in the script,\u2014the emptiness and brevity of life. That\nbeing so, and it being certain that the lines are neither by\nHugo nor by Gautier, it remains to be seen whether any\npoems by Hugo and Gautier can be found which fulfil these\nconditions, and whether any clue to those poems is contained\nin the H. V. script. I believe that there are such poems,\nand I have been led to their discovery by means of what\nwas written in my own script and in the script of other\nautomatists. I relate the circumstances in detail, prefacing\nmy account with a statement about my own knowledge of the\ntwo poets at the time (October 1910) when my own scripts\nwere produced.\n(1) I had no acquaintance with Gautier, except what was\nderived from looking at the index and turning over the pages\n\flxiil] Miss Verrall's Script of March 16, 1908. 323\nof his collected poems, as just above described, some time in\nthe winter of 1908-9, to see if I could find a parallel with\n\" La vie est breve.\"\n(2) Much of Victor Hugo's poetry is exceedingly familiar\nto me. But certain volumes\u2014among them Toutc la Lyre\u2014\nI had never seen until, in April or May 1910, after his\nauthorship of \" La vie est breve \" had been challenged, I went\nto the University Library and looked cursorily through the\nvolumes which I do not possess, turning over their pages and\nglancing at all poems with short lines such as there are in\n\" La vie est breve,\" for which I was looking.\nThe clue to what I now believe to have been the intention\nof the H. V. script of March 16, 1908, was obtained as\nfollows\n:\nMy script of October 3, October 4 and October 10, 1910,\nemphasized the word \"Meditation.\" On September 22, 1910,\nI had seen this word in the record of a sitting of Mrs. Piper's\nof July 16, 19 10.\n1\nThere the word was introduced into a\nverse apparently indicated as a subject for cross-correspondence.\nIt appeared to me, however, when I read the record, that the\nintention was to emphasize, not the lines uttered, but the\nactual word \" Meditation.\"\nWhether or not my impression was correct, it was, beyond\nall doubt, reproduced in my script of Oct. 3, 1910, and probably\nagain in my scripts of Oct. 4 and 10, 1910. They run as\nfollows :\nOct. 3, 1910. 10.20 p.m.\nMeditation and \/icAe-raco 2\nare much the same\u2014and you will find\nrecorded that Mrs. Piper has a hand in the combination.\nYour first impression about Meditation was right.\nWrite to-morrow earlier in the day, and again for a good message\non Wednesday.3\n1\nSee below, p. 331, for extracts from Mrs. Piper's sittings with comment.\n2\nThe use in Latin Bucolic poetry of the word meditor (to practise) is similar to\nthe use of jueXerdu in Greek. Milton follows the classical use of meditor in the\nphrase \" to meditate the Muse.\"\n3\nSee below, pp. 325, 33o, for Wednesday's script.\n\f324 Mrs. A. W. Verrall.

See Swinburne's Memorial Verses (to Th. G.)\n\"In types of clean chryselephantine verse.\nWho gave thee words more golden than fine gold.\"\n\"The sunrise of whose golden-mouthed glad head,\"\nand his Sonnet with a copy of Mile de Maupin\n\"This is the golden book of spirit and sense,\"\nand again his Theophile Gautier,\n\" Sa parole de marbre et d'or.\"\n2\nSuch as the abbreviated \" wh.\" for \"which,\" a characteristic in the letters of\nF.

But\nthe repetition of the word in three scripts of mine within a\nweek emphasizes the word \" meditation,\" and on some other\noccasions I have found meaning in cases where my script has\nrepeated emphatically a word originally introduced by a normal\nassociation. At the time I was unable to see any point in\nthe reiteration of the word \" meditation.\"\nIn the early part of January 1911, I came across an allusion\nin a book,1\nwhich I was reading, to \" Gautier's axiom.\" The\nsame sentence contrasted \" the rose \" and \" the laurel.\" This\nstruck me, as in recent scripts there had been some association\nof rose and laurel, and on January 7, 1911, I noted \" Gautier's\naxiom \" as a point to be looked up, but I did nothing further\nin the matter at that time.\nOn Jan. 21, 1911, I saw my daughter's script for the period\nSept. 7, to Nov. 22, 1910, which I had not seen before, and\nfound an unmistakable cross-correspondence between M. V.\nscript 2\nof October 5 and H. V. script of October 6, 1910.\nStringed instruments appeared in both scripts ;\nmy script\ncertainly, and my daughter's probably, quoted from Scott's\nLay of the Last Minstrel ;\nmy script had, in emphasized\nwriting, \" toute la lyre \"\n\u2014the title of a volume of Victor Hugo's\npoems ;\nand, further, my script represented that it was dealing\nwith the second of two groups wanted : \"I do not think you\nhave got the first word at all. What you have is the second\nThe cross-correspondence between our scripts on a \" stringed\ninstrument\" was noted 3\nby me on January 21, 1911, but\n1\nMen and Ghosts, by Edith Wharton.\n- The cross-correspondence is here summarized. See below, pp. 335 ff. , for the\nscripts and full comments.\n3\nThe reader may not assent to my view as to the correspondence between\nthe scripts ; but, in any case, it is certain that I noted my own impression\non seeing my daughter's script, as \"c.c. on stringed instrument.\"\nword.\n33\n\f326 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nI made no attempt to connect it with anything else. It is,\nhowever, to be remembered that my part of this cross-\ncorrespondence was produced on the \" Wednesday \" on which\nI was told, in the script of October 3, 1910, to write \"for\na good message.\"\nOn Jan. 27, 1911, I had an opportunity of looking for\n\" Gautier's axiom,\" in which I expected to find a comparison\nor contrast between the rose and the laurel. Mrs. Wharton's\nsentence runs as follows: \"He had but one idea in his beautiful\nobstinate head. He wanted the laurel and not the rose, and\nhe kept on repeating Gautier's axiom and battering ... at his\nlimp prose.\" The allusion is unmistakably to the following\nlines, contained in the first poem of Gautier's first volume\n:\n\" Ce qui charme s'en va, ce qui fait peine reste,\nLa rose vit une heure, et le cypres cent ans.\"\nIn his preface to the volume, Gautier expounds the views\ncondensed into the couplet above quoted,\u2014his admiration for\nthe beautiful and his conviction of its evanescence. The motto\nat the head of this poem is a quotation from Malherbe's famous\nlines on the death of his friend's child, thus :\n\" Ce monde ou\nles meilleures choses out le pire destin.\" The name of the\npoem is \" MSditation.\"\nHere, therefore, we have a poem of Gautier\n\u2014\n(1) characteristic of the author,\n(2) closely associated with the topic of \"La vie est breve,\"\n(3) bearing a title\n\u2014\nMeditation\u2014a word emphasized by the\nrepetition in my script (Oct. 3, 4, 10, 1910) of the word,\nwhich had been mentioned in Mrs. Piper's trance (July 8, 16,\n1910) as a subject for cross-correspondence.\nThese facts naturally struck me, and having thus found a\nconnexion between the M. V. \"Meditation\" (Oct. 3, 4, and 10)\nand Gautier, I looked back at the intervening script (Oct. 5)\nto see if it also were connected with the subject. I then\nnoted that this script, already emphasized by forming part of\na cross-correspondence, contained the words \" toute la lyre,\"\nwhich are the title of a volume of Victor Hugo. 1\n1\nI had not noticed this before. My note runs: \"Jan. 27, 1911. Toute la\nlyre is the name of a vol. of V. Hugo, I think,\"\n\flxiilJ Miss Verrall's Script of March 16, 1908. 327\nOn Jan. 28, 1911, I went to the University Library to see\nwhether anything in Victor Hugo's Toutc la Lyre threw light\non the script. The volume was not one of those known to\nme, but I had looked through it, as above described, in search\nof the lines \"La vie est breve,\" in April or May 1910. I\nnow found in it two poems of interest in the present con-\nnexion, thus: (1) The last poem of Book IV., dated \" Le\nJour des Morts, 1872 \"\n\u2014the year of Gautier's death\u2014-is\naddressed \" a, Theophile Gautier.\" It describes the early friend-\nship of the two poets, dwells on the old age of the present\nwriter\n1\n\u2014\n\" Moi, blanchi par les jours sur ma tete neigeant,\nJe me souviens des temps ecoules, . .\n.\"\nand recalls Gautier's preface and his poem \" Meditation \" by\nallusions to his search for the beautiful.\n\" Va chercher le vrai, toi qui sus trouver le beau.\"\n(2) In the sixteenth poem of Book III., called \" Epitaphes\nd'Enfants,\" the ending of a child's short life is regarded as a\nsubject not of regret but of rejoicing, thus exactly reversing\nthe sentiment of Gautier. Gautier laments the evanescence of\nthe beautiful, which perishes like a rose, or the child of\nMalherbe's lines\n:\n\" Ce qui charme s'en va, ce qui fait peine reste,\nLa rose vit une heure, et le cypres cent ans.\"\nHugo, on the contrary, envies the brevity of the child's life\n:\n\" Enfant, que je te porte envie\n!\nTa barque neuve echoue au port\n;\nQu'as tu done fait pour que ta vie\nAit sitot merite la mort ?\n\"\nThus, following the hints of \" meditation \" (in M. V. script of\nOct. 3, 4, and 10) and of \" toute la lyre \" (M. V. script of Oct. o),\nwe have arrived at poems by Hugo and Gautier, characteristic\nof their respective authors and dealing with the emptiness and\nbrevity of life. Hereby a meaning is given to the remarks of\nH. V. script of March 16, 190S, which, after quoting the stanza\n1\nCf. M. V. script :\n\" The minstrel was infirm and old.\" Toutt la Lyre, Hugo's\nfinal volume, might be described, not indeed as the Lay of the Last Minstrel,\nbut as the Minstrel's Last Lay.\n\f328 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nbeginning \" La vie est breve,\" says that \" Gautier and Hugo\n\"\nare \" types to be compared.\"\nMoreover, an explanation is now forthcoming for the choice\nof the word \" rose \" to serve as a second link in the cross-\ncorrespondence on the two-stanza poem, \" La vie est breve,\"\nbetween the H. V. and Mac scripts. The introduction of a\nsecond topic, not associated with either stanza of the French\npoem, is strong evidence, as I noted in my paper on the\nsubject (Proc. Vol. XXIV. p. 299), that the correspondence\non the French poem is not accidental. Still stronger evidence\nof design is now furnished by the identification of the poem\nof Gautier, which, according to the H. V. script of March 16,\n1908, presented a type for comparison with Hugo. For\nGautier's poem, based on Malherbe's lines, chooses as a type of\nthe evanescence of beauty the short-lived \" rose,\" and this gives\npoint to the introduction of a \"rose\" in the H. V. script.\nThe choice of a rose to combine with each stanza of the\nFrench poem as topics for transmission is, as I recognised\nProc. Vol. XXIV. p. 297), not inappropriate, and might, for\ninstance, be accounted for by a familiarity with Malherbe's\npoem on the death of his friend's little daughter\n:\n\" Et rose, elle a vecu ce qui vivent les roses,\nL'espace d'un matin.\"\nI did, indeed, detect and note at the time references to\nMalherbe's lines in the Mac scripts; thus, 1\non July 21, 1908,\n\" why did the rose fall so young and fresh\n\u2014\" and on July 26,\n1908, \"alas for the faded faded petals\u2014helas elle est morte dans\nsa jeunesse quand tout est frais et nouveau.\"\nBut it requires a knowledge not of Malherbe but of\nGautier to see the appropriateness of introducing Gautier's\nname into the H. V. script of March 16, 1908, with its\n\"brevity of life\" and its \"rose\"; and it takes a knowledge\nboth of Gautier and of Hugo to suggest in the same connexion\nthat those types should be compared. That knowledge neither\nmy daughter nor I possessed at the time when her script was\nwritten.\n2\nI have acquired it since by following up hints\n1\nThe scripts are quoted in Proc. Vol. XXIV. pp. 308, 309.\n2\nThat is perhaps recognised in the remark about the lack of opportunity,\nunless there were a possibility of putting the two side by side ; it was long\nbefore such an opportunity occurred.\n\flxiii.] Miss Verrall's Script of March, 16, 1908. 329\ngiven in script. It is, of course, possible\u2014though I do not\nmyself accept as sufficient such an explanation,\u2014that the\nhints suggested by the words in my own script, \" Meditation\n\"\nand \" toute la lyre,\" were due to subliminal memory of what\nI had seen in turning over the pages of Gautier and Hugo,\nafter I was acquainted with the H. V. script of March 1G,\n1908. But my subliminal memory does not account for the\nchoice, as a subject for transmission to other automatists, of\nthe word \"Meditation\" in Mrs. Piper's sittings of July 1910\n\u2014before the appearance of the word in my script\u2014nor for\nthe cross-correspondence between M.

Lodge to be the\ntitle of a poem; his note of July 13, 1910, gives a list of\npoets in whose works he had failed to find a poem called\nMeditation. After HodgsonP has learnt that no poem called\nMeditation has been found, he says that the word will play\na part and accepts the suggestion that he means a cross-corre-\nspondence. This suggestion is not spontaneous.\n(d) The fragmentary lines of July 8, completed on July 16,\nhave not been identified, nor have they been found in any\nother automatic script.\n(e) \" Elegy \" is given twice as a clue to the identification\nof the poem ; the sitter's suggestion that Gray's Elegy is in-\ntended is accepted, but erroneously.\n(\/) The poem in question is said not to be one by Frederic\nMyers.\n(g) The last two lines of the poem are emphasized as a\nsubject for transmission.\nPossible points of contact with the Meditation, of Gautier\nare to be found in (&), (c), (e), (g). Gautier's poem called\n\f334 Mrs. A. W. Verrall. [part\nMeditation, and described by him as an Elegy,\n1\ndoes \" link\n\"\nor \"connect\" parts, otherwise unconnected, in the H.

This suggestion\nperhaps receives some support from the parallelism which is\nthus presented between\n(a) the substitution in Mrs. Piper's trance of \" Churchyard\ntree \" for \" Laurels,\" and\n(h) the expectation in my mind that the axiom would con-\ncern a rose and a laurel, whereas in fact it concerns a rose\nand a cypress.\nThis expectation was derived, in my ignorance of the poem,\nfrom my reading of Mrs. Wharton's book, and is due solely\nto the form of her sentence, not to any statement of hers.\nThe \" laurel \" of immortality is preferred by the personage in\nher story to the fleeting beauty of the \" rose.\" I read this\nstory for the first time in January 1911, soon after the\npublication of the book. If therefore the parallelism with Mrs.\nPiper is other than accidental, its explanation must be found\nelsewhere than in my mental activity, whether consciously or\nunconsciously exercised. The association in my mind between\n\" cypress \" and \" laurel,\" in connexion with \" Meditation,\"\ndemonstrably came into existence only in January 1911, and\nnot earlier, and cannot therefore be held accountable for the\ncombination by MyersP, six months before, of \" Meditation\n\"\nwith \" Laurels \" and \" Churchyard tree.\"\n^autier divides his early poems into \"Elegies,\" and \"Paysages,\" and\nMeditation is numbered as Elegie xii.\n\flxiii.] Miss Verrall's Script of March 16, 1908. 335\nAppendix B.\nCross-correspondence between M.

But the paragraph in M. V. script\nabout the \" second group \" suggests that the important point\nof the script, whatever that point may be, was to be the\nsecond of two phrases. In this connexion it should be\nnoted that the M. V. script was produced on a day (Oct. 5,\n1910) appointed two days beforehand in M.

MITCHELL, M.D.\nOur knowledge of the efficacy of suggestion in the treatment\nof morbid conditions is apt to bias our judgment in regard to\nthe value of other psychotherapeutic measures and in regard to\nthe interpretation of the results obtained by the employment\nof such measures. We know how powerful and how far\nreaching is its action, we know how subtle and indirect may\nbe its use, we know so well the difficulty of eliminating its\npossible influence in every form of treatment whatsoever, that\nwe may be inclined to ascribe to its virtues results that are\nin part at least dependent upon other factors. And although\nit is probable that the importance of suggestion in the domain\nof psychotherapy can never be gainsaid, and that the increased\nsuggestibility brought about by the induction of hypnosis\ncannot be denied, yet we are bound to examine any mode of\npsychic treatment that is put forward by responsible men, and\nto appraise without prejudice the theoretical considerations\nadvanced by them in explanation of their results.\nWe know the efficacy of suggestion, and we know it is\na good rule of method not unnecessarily to multiply our\ncauses ; but we also know that no scientific dictum has been\nmore productive of advance in knowledge than that which tells\nus to examine our residues. The history of Science affords us\nmany instances in which the neglect of residual phenomena in\nexperimental research has led to the overlooking of important\nfacts, and prevented investigators from making discoveries\nwhich, had they paid due attention to their residues, they\ncould hardly have missed. The great chemist Cavendish\nprobably missed the discovery of Argon because in his estimate\n\flxiil] The Hypnoidal State of Sidis. 339\nof the nitrogen of the air he neglected a residue which his\nexperiments showed him could not be more than 1-1 20th\npart of the whole. More than a hundred years afterwards\nthis residue was accounted for by the discovery of Argon.\nNow in the history of psychotherapy, from its earliest\nbeginnings down to our own time, we find many cases where\nthe circumstances under which curative results have been\nobtained render it difficult for us to range these results under\nthe category of the therapeutics of suggestion. The mesmeric\noperator, by a prolonged series of passes, induced a trance\ncondition which in itself appears to have had a curative\ninfluence. In other instances benefit was obtained when no\nevidence of the mesmeric state was to be found. We try to\nhypnotize a patient and fail, but while he lies quiescent we\ngive him curative suggestions which seem to be effective. We\nask a patient to lie quietly with closed eyes while we murmur\ntherapeutic suggestions in a monotonous voice, and sooner or\nlater he derives great benefit from this process.\nSuch cases as these may be regarded as the residual pheno-\nmena of the therapeutics of suggestion, and just as Cavendish\nand his successors too readily assumed that all the so-called\nnitrogen of the air was the same as the nitrogen of nitre, so we\nmay be missing some important truth if we too readily assume\nthat all these therapeutic results are due solely to suggestion.\nThe value of suggestion during hypnosis is well attested, and the\npossibility of effecting physiological and psychological change\nby its means is supported by a large amount of experimental\nevidence. But evidence of this kind is greatly lacking in\nregard to suggestion without hypnosis, and until it is forth-\ncoming we are justified in receiving with some suspicion\naccounts of the therapeutic efficacy of suggestion in the waking\nstate. We seem bound to consider whether some state of\nconsciousness intermediate between waking and hypnosis may\nnot be artificially induced and utilized for the purpose of\ngiving therapeutic suggestions. We should also keep open\nminds in regard to the possible influence of agencies other\nthan suggestion in every form of psychotherapeutic practice.\nThe scientific investigation of states of consciousness inter-\nmediate between waking and hypnosis is a contribution to\npsychology and psychotherapy which we owe practically to one\n\f340 T. W. Mitchell, M.J). [part\nman\u2014Dr. Boris Siclis of Brookline. A research into the\nnature of suggestibility carried out by him some thirteen or\nfourteen years ago led him to formulate certain laws and\nconditions of normal and abnormal suggestibility. In order to\nget suggestibility in the waking state he found that certain\nconditions have to be complied with. Attention must be fixed,\nbut it must be distracted from the suggestion. There must be\nmonotony of impressions, limitation of voluntary movements,\nand consequently a limitation of the field of consciousness.\nHe regards hypnosis (abnormal suggestibility) as \" a disaggrega-\ntion of consciousness, a slit, a scar produced in the mind that\nmay extend wider and deeper, ending at last in a total dis-\njunction of the waking, guiding, controlling consciousness from\nthe reflex consciousness.\" Normal suggestibility he believes to\nbe of a like nature\u2014\" it is a cleft in the mind, only here the\ncleft is not so deep, not so lasting, as it is in hypnosis or in\nthe state of abnormal suggestibility ; the split is here but\nmomentary, evanescent, fleeting, disappearing at the very\nmoment of its appearance.\" 1\nAccording to Sidis there is no suggestibility without dis-\naggregation of consciousness. Suggestion in the waking state\nis effective only when limitation of the field of consciousness\nis produced by the conditions under which the suggestion is\ngiven. Suggestibility is an attribute of the subconscious, and\nonly when there is a disaggregation of consciousness as a whole\nis it possible to appeal directly to the subconscious. Now in\nthe treatment of psychopathic disorders we often find it desir-\nable to get into communication with the subconsciousness of\nour patients, not primarily for the purpose of giving sugges-\ntions, but in order that we may discover mental material\nwhich has become dissociated from the waking consciousness.\nSo far as I can discover from the writings of Dr. Sidis, it\nwas in order to determine whether certain cases of amnesia\nwere merely disaggregative, and therefore curable, or absolute\nand incurable, that he first made use of the conditions of\nnormal suggestibility as a means of gaining access to the sub-\nconscious for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. The same\nend may be obtained by the induction of hypnosis, but hypnosis\ncannot always be easily induced, and sometimes it is objected\n1\nThe Psychology of Suggestion (New York, 1906), p. 88.\n\fLXIII.] The Hypnoidal State of Sidis. 341\nto. But \" where hypnosis is not practicable, and the sub-\nconscious has to be reached, we can effect a disaggregation of\nconsciousness, and thus produce an allied subconscious state by\nputting the patient under the conditions of normal suggesti-\nbility.\" 1\nSidis maintains that by keeping the patient for a\nshort time under the conditions of normal suggestibility we\ninduce a peculiar mental state which he has named the\nhypnoidal state. The process by which it is induced he calls\nhypnoidization.\nMany different methods of hypnoidization may be employed,\nbut they all fulfil the main requisites for the production of\nnormal suggestibility, namely, monotony and limitation of\nvoluntary movement. In his work, The Psychology of Sug-\ngestion, Sidis gives the following account of his original\nmethod :\n\" The patient is asked to close his eyes and keep\nas quiet as possible, without, however, making any special\neffort to put himself in such a state. He is then asked to\nattend to some stimulus, such as reading or singing. When\nthe reading is over, the patient, with his eyes still shut, is\nasked to repeat it, and tell what came into his mind during\nthe reading, during the repetition, or after it. Sometimes, as\nwhen the song-stimulus is used, the patient is simply asked to\ntell the nature of ideas and images that entered into his mind\nat that time or soon after.\"\n2\nIn his Studies in Psychopathology (1907) he writes: \"As\nmodifications of the same method, the patient is asked to\nfixate his attention on some object, while at the same time\nlistening to the beats of a metronome ; the patient's eyes are\nthen closed ;\nhe is to keep very quiet, while the metronome or\nsome other monotonous stimulus is kept on going. After\nsome time, when his respirations and pulse are found some-\nwhat lowered, and he declares that he thinks of nothing in\nparticular, he is asked to concentrate his attention on a subject\nclosely relating to the symptoms of the malady or to the sub-\nmerged subconscious state.\" 3\nWriting in 1909 on The Therapeutic Value of the Hypnoidal\nState, he says : \" The procedure of hypnoidization is quite\n1 Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, March 14, 1907, p. 325.\n2\nThe Psychology of Suggestion (New York, 1906), p. 224.\n3\nBoston Medical and Surgical J'our-nal, Mar. 14, 1907, p. 325.\n\f342 T. W. Mitchell, 31. D. [part\nsimple and may be described as follows. The patient is told\nto close his eyes and keep very quiet. He is then asked to\nattend to some monotonous stimulus such as the beats of a\nmetronome, or listen to a continuous note produced by a\ntuning-fork, or to smell some pleasant odour, or simply to\nsubmit himself to a gentle massage in which touch and\npressure are of uniform intensity. This should be carried out\nin a room where it is dark and quiet. Fatigue, physical and\nmental, especially emotional, is a favourable condition. A\nprolonged warm bath with relaxation is favourable. A pre-\ndisposition to sleep is helpful. It is therefore best to make\nthe first attempt at hypnoidization late at night, when the\npatient is both tired and sleepy. In most cases darkness,\nquietness, repose, fixation on a bright point and listening to\nthe monotonous buzzing of an inductorium are conditions\nfavourable to the induction of the hypnoidal state, even at\nthe very first attempt.\" 1\nIt may be observed that the first description is specially\napplicable to the investigation of cases of amnesia. The\nsecond method described would apply more particularly to the\nuse of hypnoidization as a means of discovering dissociated\ncomplexes of a pathogenic nature. In the last description\nstress is laid on the induction of the hypnoidal state as an\nend in itself.\nBy the use of these or similar methods a state of con-\nsciousness is induced which differs from full waking but is not\nhypnosis or ordinary sleep. The patient is apparently awake\nand in possession of all his faculties, but scraps of dissociated\nmemories, which he cannot ordinarily recall, keep rising into\nconsciousness. The whole feeling-tone becomes one of acquies-\ncence and indifference. Pulse and respiration become diminished,\nbut are liable to occasional disturbances. Fluctuations of\nsensory acuteness, sudden apparently unaccountable starts, and\na slight tendency to resist any change of posture of limbs or\nbody, without actual catalepsy, may be observed. But the\ncondition is essentially an unstable one and constantly varies\nin depth. At one moment the patient may be practically in\nthe ordinary waking state, at another he may be on the very\nbrink of hypnosis or of sleep. Yet on the whole it is a state\n1\nBoston Medical and Surgical Journal, Aug. 19, 1909, p. 247.\n\fLXIIl.] The Hypnoidal State of Siclis. 343\nof rest and calm. Mental and physical activity are relaxed,\nemotional excitement becomes stilled, and suggestions meet with\nlittle resistance.\nThe hypnoidal state is an intermediate territory, on the\nborder-land of waking, sleep, and hypnosis. In the course of\na valuable experimental study of sleep 1\nin man and the lower\nanimals, Sidis discovered that the hypnoidal state is a phase\nof consciousness which is passed through in every transition\nfrom one of these states to another. In passing from the\nwaking state to ordinary sleep or hypnosis, there is always a\nlonger or shorter hypnoidal stage. In the practice of hyp-\nnoidization the patient sometimes drops into hypnosis, or he\nmay fall asleep without touching on hypnosis. And so also,\nin awakening from sleep or from hypnosis, the hypnoidal state\nhas to be passed through. Sidis found that the farther we\ndescend in the scale of animal life, the more important does\nthe hypnoidal state become in relation to bodily rest and\nrecuperation, and he concludes that it is the primitive rest-\nstate out of which both sleep and hypnosis have been evolved.\nThe relation to each other of waking, sleep, hypnosis, and\nthe hypnoidal state may be represented in a diagram in which\n1\n.\nJournal of Abnormal Psychology, Apr.-Sept., 1908.\n\f344 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nthe primitive hypnoidal state is regarded as a nucleus from\nwhich the segments of the larger circle, waking, sleep, hyp-\nnosis, have arisen. The transition from one of these segments\nto another can take place only through the central territory\nwith which they each have direct relations.\nThe spontaneous occurrence of the hypnoidal state in man\nis as a rule merely a transitory stage in the alternation of\nwaking and sleep. From the point of view of evolution it is\na vestige derived from a long race of ancestors, a rudimentary\nfunction which has been superseded by the more highly\nspecialized rest-state, sleep. But it can be artificially induced\nand maintained by the methods which have been described,\nand it can be utilized with effect in the treatment of psycho-\npathic disorders.\nThe therapeutic use of the hypnoidal state is a somewhat\ncomplex subject, for hypnoidization may be employed merely\nas an adjunct to other methods or as a curative measure in\nitself. To understand the claims which Sidis puts forward for\nit at the present time, we cannot do better than to examine\nthe types of cases in which it has been used by Sidis himself\nat various stages in the development of his practice of it. The\nfirst record of his use of hypnoidization I have been able to\nfind is in the account of the well-known Hanna case, given in\nfull in Multiple Personality by Sidis and Goodhart. This was\na case of total amnesia, following a severe injury. The\npatient, a cultured clergyman, was reduced to the mental\ncondition of a new-born child. All his former acquisitions and\nmemories seemed to have entirely disappeared, and he had to\nstart learning everything again from the beginning. When he\nwas put into the hypnoidal state various fragmentary experi-\nences of his past life emerged into consciousness, demonstrating\nto his observers that his lost memories were merely dissociated\nand not destroyed. The same method was made use of in\nother cases of amnesia, and it was found to be of great\nassistance in effecting the resurrection of dissociated mental\nmaterial and its reintegration in consciousness.\nWith the progress of his studies in psychopathology, the\nreintegration of consciousness became, for Sidis, the aim of all\ntherapeutic endeavour in connection with maladies that are\nassociated with, or produced by, mental dissociation. The\n\fLXIII.] The Hypnoidal State of Sidis. 345\nrecurrent psycho-motor states of functional psychosis, insistent\nideas, imperative concepts, persistent or periodically appearing\nemotional states, so-called psychic epilepsy and other states of\ndissociation, all lent themselves to treatment by hypnoidization.\nBy its means the dissociated complexes could be recovered,\nthe psychogenesis of the malady could be traced, a synthesis\nof consciousness affected, and the patient thereby cured. As\nhis confidence in his method increased, Sidis gradually ex-\ntended its employment, until at the present time he seems to\nuse it in every kind of disorder in which psychotherapy is\nindicated. Writing in 1909, he says: \"All cases of a\npsychopathic character admit of treatment by hypnoidization.\nThis, however, is too broad a statement, as the hypnotic\nstate is far more powerful and attains its end in a shorter\ntime than the hypnoidal state. In those cases therefore where\nhypnosis can be used, it should by all means be employed.\nThere is, however, a far larger number of cases where hypnosis\nis not quite easy to induce, either on account of the patient\nhimself or on account of unfavourable external circumstances.\nIn such cases, and they form the vast majority of psycho-\npathic cases, the hypnoidal state is of the utmost importance\nfrom a diagnostic, psychopathological and therapeutic stand-\npoint.\"\n1\nIt is thus as a substitute for hypnosis, when the\ninduction of the hypnotic state is for any reason impossible,\nthat Sidis recommends treatment by hypnoidization.\nNow, it might be inferred that in using the hypnoidal\nstate as a substitute for hypnosis, we should have to rely\nmainly upon the suggestibility of the state in the one case as\nin the other. We might suppose that suggestion during the\nhypnoidal state is the essential part of the treatment. But\nsurprisingly little stress is laid by Sidis on this part of the\ntechnique. The most that he says of it is that \" the suggesti-\nbility of the state, if skilfully handled, is apt to increase the\ntherapeutic efficacy.\"\n2\nNor is it in its usefulness as a means\nof enabling us to get into touch with dissociated mental\ncomplexes, and thereby to assist in their reintegration in\nconsciousness, that the sole or chief therapeutic value of the\nhypnoidal state exists. He says, \" once the hypnoidal state is\n1\nBoston Medical and Surr\/ical Journal, Aug. 26, 190P, p. 291.\n-Ibid. p. 246.\n\f346 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ninduced by any of the various methods of hypnoidization, we\ncan either attempt to follow up the history and the develop-\nment of the malady, or we may chiefly work for the thera-\npeutic effect and treat the present symptoms. It is, however,\nadvisable from a purely practical therapeutic purpose to\ncombine the two procedures, as the cure is then far more\neffective and far more stable. In cases where the history of\nthe origin and development of the disease could not be traced\non account of the age or unintelligence of the patient, the\ntherapeutic effects alone of the hypnoidal state have been\nutilized. The results are not so satisfactory so far as scientific\ninformation is concerned, but they are nevertheless of great\nbenefit to the patient.\"\n1\nIt would appear, then, that Sidis ascribes some special\ntherapeutic virtue to the hypnoidal state, cmite apart from the\nsuggestibility which characterises it, and apart also from the\nassistance which it gives us in tracing the pathogenesis of\npsychopathic disorders. On what, then, does this special thera-\npeutic virtue depend ? According to Sidis, it depends on the\nfact that through the hypnoidal state access is gained \" to the\nstores of potential subconscious reserve energy, which by a\nliberation of energy bring about a reassociation and synthesis\nof the dissociated mental systems underlying the symptoms of\nthe disease. The therapeutic value of the hypnoidal state\nconsists in the liberation of reserve energy requisite for the\nsynthesis of the dissociated systems.\"\n2\nBefore going on to consider this contention, it will be well\nto examine the practice of hypnoidization in regard to its\nvalue as a method of employing suggestion, and as a means of\nfacilitating the recovery of lost or dissociated memories.\nIf Sidis is right in supposing the hypnoidal state to have\ncurative value in itself, it will be very difficult to determine\nhow much importance we should ascribe to suggestion during\nthe state, even when it is persistently used and relied upon\nby the physician as the essential therapeutic measure. Sidis\ngives practically no detailed record of his use of therapeutic\nsuggestion in the hypnoidal state, and other observers who\nhave reported their experience of hypnoidization have done so\n1\nBoston Medical and Surgical Journal, Ibid. p. 247.\n2 Journal of Abnormal Psychology,\nJune-July, 1909, p. 155.\n\fLXIII.] The Hypnoidal State of Sidis. 347\nalmost exclusively with reference to the recovery of dissociated\nmemories.\nPerhaps the best example of the use of suggestion as an\nexclusive therapeutic measure in the hypnoidal state is to be\nfound in the practice of Dr. Bramwell's method of treatment\nby suggestion. I think there can be little doubt that by his\nmethod of oivino- suggestions Dr. Bramwell induces in his\npatients a state of consciousness which is identical with the\nhypnoidal state of Sidis. But in this mode of treatment there\nis, besides the suggestions, a prolongation of the hypnoidal\nstate ; and if the hypnoidal state in itself has therapeutic\nvirtue, it is manifestly difficult to be sure how much of Dr.\nBramwell's good results is due to suggestion and how much\nto the postulated virtue of the hypnoidal state. If, however,\nwe disregard the supposed virtues of hypnoidization by itself,\nthere is good evidence to show that in some cases valuable\nresults may be obtained by the use of suggestion in the\nhypnoidal state.\nThe value of hypnoidization in the resurrection of dis-\nsociated memories is that which is perhaps most firmly\nestablished. And this applies not only to the restoration of\nthe forgotten experiences of ordinary amnesia, but to the\nrecovery of dissociated memories that are of pathogenic\nsignificance. The most striking work that has been clone in\nthis connection is to be found in the publications of Freud\nand his school on psycho-analysis ;\nbut the general principle of\nthe reintegration of dissociated mental complexes as a curative\nmeasure in the treatment of the psycho-neuroses has been\narrived at independently by several workers. Sidis himself lias\ninsistently taught that reassociation of dissociated complexes\neffects a cure of psychopathic disease.\nBut although Sidis uses the hypnoidal state for psycho-\nanalytic purposes, in so far as by its means he brings back\nto consciousness pathogenic experiences that cannot be recalled\nby ordinary association, he does not believe, as the Freudians\ndo, that this process is in itself curative. He thinks that \" the\ninformation of the psychogenesis given to the patient is valuable\nonly in so far as by a systematic course of direct and in-\ndirect suggestion, by mediate associative and immediate asso-\nciative suggestion, by substitution, disintegration, and synthesis,\n\f348 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PAET\nboth in the waking and hypnoidal states, we help to transform\nthe associative course and emotional tone of the patient's\nmental life.\" 1\nWe must remember that Sidis admits that all the lost\nmemories that can be recovered by hypnoidization can be more\neasily recovered if hypnosis can lie induced. The realm of\nthe subconscious laid bare in patches in the hypnoidal state\nis the same as that which is laid bare in its entirety\nduring hypnosis. But those who are familiar with Freud's\nviews will remember that he deprecates the use of the\nhypnotic state for purposes of psycho-analysis, on the grounds\nthat whilst in hypnosis the resistances to the emergence of\npathogenic memories are lessened in some directions, they are\nmade more intense in others. The region of consciousness\nlaid bare by the induction of hypnosis does not always contain\nall the pathogenic material whose recovery is necessary, and\nthe psychic force which prevents the emergence of this\nmaterial into the waking consciousness is at least equally\neffective in preventing its emergence into the hypnotic con-\nsciousness. In my own experience I have found this resistance\nto be very great in the hypnotic states of patients suffering\nfrom the graver forms of hysteria.\nIf then, in such cases, hypnoidization be no more efficacious\nthan hypnotization, it would seem that Freud's method\nis the best for the purpose of psycho-analysis ; but I think\nit is possible that in some cases the hypnoidal state may\nhave a superiority over hypnosis in this respect which Sidis\ndoes not explicitly claim for it. Indeed, it seems probable\nthat the hypnoidal state may be the best condition of con-\nsciousness in which to make use of Freud's technique. Sidis\nhas expressed the opinion that some of Freud's success may\nbe due to the unconscious use of the hypnoidal state, and\nthe conditions under winch Freud conducts his analysis\nrender this supposition not improbable.\nBut in expressing this view Sidis is not referring to Freud's\nsuccess in conducting the psycho-analysis. He does not mean\nthat by the unconscious use of the hypnoidal state Freud\nrenders easier the discovery of pathogenic complexes. What\nhe means is that Freud by his method of conducting the\n1\nJournal of Abnormal Psychology, June-July, 1909, p. 154.\n\fLXill.] The Hypnoidal State of Sidis. 349\nanalysis unconsciously induces the hypnoidal state, and that\nhis therapeutic success may be due in part to the virtues\ninherent in the hypnoidal state rather than to the psycho-\nanalysis. This inherent virtue of the hypnoidal state is the\nmost interesting claim made by Sidis in regard to the\npractice of hypnoidization. In his later writings he insistently\nmaintains that the use of hypnoidization alone, without sugges-\ntion or psycho-analysis, is sufficient to cure certain morbid\nconditions. He bases this claim on the fact that he has found\nthe hypnoidal state effective towards this end, and he inter-\nprets his results as being due to a release of reserve energy\nwhich has been locked up in the inhibited and dissociated\nsystems or complexes.\nThe principle of reserve energy is based upon a wide\ngeneralization of facts, namely, that far less energy is utilized\nby the individual than is actually at his disposal. In the\nstruggle for existence, those forms of life which have accumu-\nlated a store of reserve energy that can be drawn upon in\nemergencies, have the best chance of survival. The more\ncomplex an organism becomes, the greater is its need to avoid\nreaction to every passing stimulus. Such unrestrained reactions\nmust be inhibited or there will be a wasteful expenditure\nof energy, which will leave the organism unprepared for\noccasions of stress in its struggle for life. The inhibitions\nincrease with the growth in complexity of the nervous system,\nand they are brought about by the multiplicity of associa-\ntions that are formed in the course of phylogenetic and onto-\ngenetic experience. Nothing so clearly marks off the higher\nfrom the lower races of mankind as the amount of inhibition\nthey show in regard to instinctive or immediate response to\nexternal stimuli. The inhibitions exercised by civilized man\nare a consequence of the multiplicity of associations which all\nhis mental complexes have acquired, and it is the increase\nof inhibitions that has led to that accumulation of reserve\nenergy, ever ready to be called upon in emergencies, which\nhas made him master of the world.\nWhen we weigh the considerations for and against a\ncertain line of conduct, the delay in our response to the\nstimulus is due to the inhibitions exercised by the manifold\nof associated complexes that have been aroused to function.\n\f350 T. W. Mitchell, 31. D. [part\nThese complexes exercise an inhibitory influence on the\ncomplex which has been stimulated. We are familiar in\nexperimental psychology with the notion of a stimulus-thres-\nhold, and the effect of an increase of associations is to raise\nthe stimulus-threshold of a complex. A complex that has\nmany associations will not be so readily aroused to function\nas one that has few.\nNow if a complex from any cause becomes dissociated,\nit drops out of the personal life and cannot be set in action\nthrough its ordinary sensory or associative channels. It will\nthen appear as if its stimulus-threshold were very high. But\nin fact, if we can by any means tap the dissociated complex,\nits threshold will be found to be very low. And this is\nwhat we should expect. Cut off from association with other\ncomplexes which were wont to exercise upon it an inhibitory\ninfluence, it now reacts to minimal stimuli and manifests\nitself with great intensity. Freed from the restraining influence\nof its normal associations, its locked-up energy is expended\nin wasteful and inappropriate activity. This is well illustrated\nin attacks of so-called psychic epilepsy and in the psycho-\nmotor reactions of other dissociated states.\nIn a dissociated complex energy is held in reserve which\ncannot be drawn upon for the requirements of the individual,\nand if by any means this energy comes to be released, it is\nexpended in ways that are worse than useless as regards the\nadjustment of the organism to its environment. And even\nwhen no dissociation has occurred, the inhibitions exercised by\nassociated complexes may, under certain circumstances, be so\ngreat that a complex may be practically cut off from the\nfunctional life of the individual, and its reserve energy\nrendered unavailable. Here the result is due, not to the\ndissociation of the complex, but to the raising of its thres-\nhold so high that normal stimuli are inadequate to arouse it\nto function. In the one case we have a complex with a\nvery low threshold, functioning only sporadically and exces-\nsively because it is dissociated. In the other we have a\ncomplex, still functionally related to its associated complexes,\nbut with a stimulus-threshold so high that it cannot be\noverstepped by the ordinary stimuli of life. In one case\nenergy is stored and then wastefully expended ; in the other\n\fLXIII.] The Hypnoidal State of Sidis. 351\ncase energy is stored, but it is unavailable. In both cases,\nso long as the dissociation or the inhibitions continue,\nnervous energy is lost to the individual and his mental and\nphysical life is impoverished.\nNow these are the conditions met with in functional\npsychosis and in the psychoneuroses, and if we can restore the\ndissociated functions, or break down the inhibitions, we shall\nliberate the reserve energy of the dissociated and inhibited\ncomplexes, re-establish normal associations, and restore the\npatient to health. Sidis maintains that this end can frequently\nbe obtained by means of the hypnoidal state. In this state\nthere is a lowering and redistribution of thresholds. Access\nis gained to the reserve energy of dissociated complexes,\nand the energy so available assists in repairing the breaches\nof associative continuity. The high thresholds of inhibited\ncomplexes are lowered and reserve energy is liberated. \" The\noveracting dissociated systems with their automatic reflex\nreactions may form associations with other systems and thus\nbecome inhibited as well as controlled in their function by\nthe voluntary activity of personal consciousness, while the\ninhibited systems with their raised thresholds and accumulated\nreserve energy are set to function.\"\n1\nThe reintegration of the\ndissociated and inhibited complexes is accompanied by a new\nfeeling-tone, a fresh emotional energy, which sometimes amounts\nto a complete transformation of personality.\nThese are the principal points which seem to claim atten-\ntion in regard to the hypnoidal state. It is maintained by\nSidis that a definite state of consciousness, different from waking,\nsleep, and hypnosis, is brought about by subjecting the patient\nto the conditions of normal suggestibility, namely, monotony and\nlimitation of voluntary movement. It is a state in which there is\na variable and fluctuating disaggregation of consciousness, whereby\na partial and intermittent access to the subconscious may be\nobtained. The intercourse with the subconscious so established\nmay be utilized for the purpose of giving therapeutic suggestions,\nor for the recovery of the submerged memories of simple amnesia\nand for the discovery of dissociated complexes of pathogenic\nsignificance. Finally, the hypnoidal state may be employed as\n1\nBoston Medical and Surgical Journal, Sept. 9, 1909, p. 360.\n\f352 T. W.

For practical physicians the most\nimportant matter at the present time is the fact that such results\nhave been obtained by the use of the methods which Sidis has\ndescribed in his writings on the hypnoidal state.

It describes a visit to the Petit Trianon on\nAugust 10th, 1901, when various people and things were seen which\nthe two ladies afterwards concluded were hallucinatory, and\n\"wondered whether [they] had entered within an act of the Queens\n[Marie Antoinette's] memory when alive, and whether this explained\n[their] curious sensation of being completely shut in and oppressed\"\n(p. 23). What exactly entering into an act of memory is we do\nnot know, but it does not appear to be a dream state, since the\nauthors continue: \"What more likely, we thought, than that during\nthose hours in the Hall of Assembly [on August 10th, 1792]... she\nhad gone back in such vivid memory to other Augusts spent at\nTrianon, that some impress of it was imparted to the place\n\"\n(pp. 23-4). Besides, the story ends up with a tour of the interior of\nthe Petit Trianon in the company of a solidly real modern French\nwedding party (pp. 10, 25). If, however, the authors do not mean\na dream state by \"entering into an act of memory,\" their theory\nappears to involve their own bodily transportation through what is\nnow a solid wall (see V., pp. 87-89). A good deal of evidence\nwould be required before a phenomenon of this kind could be\naccepted as a fact.\nHowever, we need not trouble ourselves about the \"act of\nmemory \" theory, as it does not seem to us that, on the evidence\nbefore us, there is sufficient ground for supposing anything super-\nnormal to have occurred at all. The persons and things seen\nz\n\f354 \"An Adventure.'' [PAET\nwere, we should judge, the real persons and things the seers\nsupposed them to be at the time, probably decked out by tricks\nof memory (and after the idea of haunting had occurred to them,\npp. 11, 20) with some additional details of costume suitable to the\ntimes of Marie Antoinette (p. 24). No detailed account of the\nexperiences was apparently written till three months later, Nov.,\n1901, 1\nand it is unusual to be able to rely on one's memory for\ndetails of things seen after even a much shorter interval of time.\nVagueness of memory is the more likely to have occurred in this\ncase, as the ladies, who at best do not seem to be very good at\ntopography, were not apparently attending closely to their surround-\nings ;\nthey are careful to explain that they were talking about\nEngland and mutual acquaintances as they walked (pp. 3, 4), and\ncontinued their \" conversation about other things after every inter-\nruption\" (p. 102). It may easily be due to this comparative absence\nof mind at the time that they failed later to recognise the places\nwhere they had been. \" Not only was there no trace of [the old\npaths],\" says Miss Morison of a visit made three years later, \" but\nthe distances were contracted, and all was on a smaller scale than\nI recollected\" (p. 36). This erroneous impression of size about a\nplace new to one, and where one does not know one's way, is a\ncommon experience.\nIt may be worth while to examine the narrative more syste-\nmatically. We have in the hook separate accounts by the two ladies,\nbut these are not strictly independent, as they wrote them after talk-\ning their experiences over. Still, the accounts differ in some respects,\nand, as often happens when two people walk together, they did not\nalways notice the same things. Our friend, M. Sage, who lives at\nParis, anil has on previous occasions made some investigations for us,\nkindly walked over the ground with their accounts before him, and\nsent us, with his comments, plans and picture post-cards, some of\nwhich we reproduce here. The plan we give below is a sketch by\nM. Sage giving an enlarged representation of a portion of a map of the\npalaces and gardens of Versailles by M. Marcel Lambert, Architecte\ndes Domaines de A^ersailles et des Trianons. The line and letters\non the plan explain M. Sage's view of the route taken by Miss\nMorison and Miss Lamont. It should be observed that the plans\nin their book do not profess to be more than diagrammatic.\n'The papers written then are, we are told, \"still in existence'' (p. 103).\nDoes this mean that the two narratives at the beginning of the book do not\nexactly reproduce these papers?\n\f\f\fLXIII.] Review.\nThe two ladies having reached\u2014by a route which their description\nleaves doubtful, but which is unimportant\u2014the intersection of the\nAllee de la Reine with the Allee des deux Trianons, should have\nfollowed the latter in the direction away from the Grand Trianon,\nand would shortly have arrived at the main entrance of the Petit\nTrianon. Instead they took the \"Chemin Creux,\" passing on their\nright the Musee des Ventures (A, on map), out of a window of\nwhich (the dwelling-house of the gardien forms part of it) a woman\nwas shaking a cloth, and on their left the Grand Trianon. They\nfollowed the Chemin Creux to C, then turned to the right, passing\nbehind farm-like buildings and cottages, and noticing farm and garden\nimplements (p. 16), probably at I), reached the crest of the rising\nground at E, and turned into the garden of the Petit Trianon.\nIt was here that they began to feel as if they had lost their\nway, and as if something were wrong (p. 17). \"An extraordinary\ndepression had come over \" Miss Morison (p. 4). It was the latter\npart of the afternoon of a hot day spent in sight-seeing, and when\nthey began to realise that they had lost their way a feeling of\noppression was perhaps not unnatural. Miss Morison attributed it\nto fatigue (p. 102), but afterwards thought that the fatigue 'he\nresult, not the cause, of the uncomfortable sensations (p. 102), and\nremembers herself as not at all tired (p. 4). Miss Lamont describes\nthe feeling as eerie, and culminating in an impression of something\nuncanny (p. IS), but is careful to explain (p. 103) that she \"did\nnot mean that she had the least idea at the time that any of the\npeople encountered were unreal or ghostly,\" and that \" this was\nstill more true of the scenery.\" Nevertheless, remembering this\nfeeling of \"dreamy unnatural oppression\" (p. 11), a week later, they\nagreed that the place was haunted (pp. 11, 20).\nOn entering the garden they saw two men (probably at F, a\nspot close to the entrance to a gardener's yard, and where M. Sage\nalso found garden labourers at work) whom they describe as dressed\nin \"greyish green coats with small three-cornered hats\" (Miss\nMorison, p. 4), \"in official dress greenish in colour\" (Miss Lamont,\np. 17).\n1\nThis description does not seem to correspond to the dress\nof either officials or gardeners at Trianon now. The former, M.\nSage informs us, wear cocked hats, and the latter have by way\nof uniform a Mpi (the kind of cap French soldiers wear) with a\nbroad red band. This last may possibly have given an impression\nto Miss Lamont which crystallised into official dress. But whatever\n1\n\" Greenish\" becomes \"green\" in later references.\nZ2\n\f356 \"An Adventure.\" [part\nthe dress was, it seems clear that at the time they took the men\nfor gardeners. \" We spoke of them as gardeners,\" Miss Morison\nsays, \"because we remembered a wheelbarrow of some kind and\nthe look of a pointed spade\" (p. 4), and again she speaks of \"con-\nnecting the sound [of the running man] with the gardeners\"\n(|). 5). In later years they decided that these men probably repre-\nsented in the \"act of memory\" two brothers Bersy, attendants on\nMarie Antoinette, who, research shows, were likely to have been on\nguard somewhere about that spot in 1789.\nThey asked these men their way and were told to go straight\non. If that meant by the path marked on our plan with an arrow\nit would have been the shortest way to the entrance of the house\nfrom the point F. They, however, appear to have taken it to\nmean the path towards G\u2014the Rocher bridge. Just before reaching\nG they would be, as their description requires, at a point where\ntheir path ended, being crossed by another. They would then\nhave a kiosk, (the Belvedere, H, 1\n) in front to their left and a rustic\nbridge (the Rocher Bridge, G) to their right (see view of these,\nbelow, taken from another point).\nThe ladies do not admit, however, that either the bridge or the\nkiosk have any resemblance to those they saw, and further conclude\nfrom researches made in 1908 and 1907 (pp. 48 and 67) that besides\nthese and not far from them there were in 1789 another kiosk and\nanother rustic bridge, now no longer existing, which may have\nresembled what they remember. Much stress is laid on these two\nitems as evidence of supernormal vision. It is unfortunate for their\ntheory that neither lady saw more than one kiosk or one bridge in\nthat region on their first visit, nor does Miss Lamont appear to\nhave done so on the subsequent one when she regarded her\nexperience as supernormal (p. 30). (For the diagrams on pp. 53\nand 62 do not represent what they saw at any one time, but are\nonly their hypothetical reconstructions of the results of their\nreseat ches.) That no more kiosks or bridges were seen than now\nexist goes to confirm our conjecture that it was the existing ones\nwhich they saw.\nIt is true, however, that the descriptions of the kiosk in the book,\n\" A light garden kiosk, circular and like a small bandstand \" (in Miss\nMorison's account, p. 4); or \"A building consisting of some columns\nroofed in\" (in Miss Lamont's account, p. 18)\u2014do not correspond well\n1\nThis building, judging from post-cards and map, seems to be called indif-\nferently by the names \"Belvedere,\" \"Pavilion de Musique,\" and \"Kiosque.\"\n\fLXIII.] Review. 357\nto the Belvedere, and are more like the Temple de l'Amour (see illus-\ntration). On the other hand, Miss Lamont in January, 1902, went to\nsee the Temple de l'Amour, and decided that it was not the building\nthey had seen in 1901 (p. 26), and on the same occasion took for\ngranted that the Belvedere was that building, \"for coming upon it\nfrom behind, all the water was hidden from\" her (p. 30). Is it\npossible that they saw both buildings in 1901 and retained a kind\nof composite mental picture of them'? We understand from M.\nSage that the Temple de l'Amour (\/ on the map) is visible from\nthe points\u2014among others\u2014marked K and L on the map, and if the\nladies made a ditour through either of these points in approaching\nthe house, which there is some reason to think they did, they\nwould have had a view of it in front and to the left, which mitrht\nhave merged itself in memory with that of the Belvedere. It must\nbe remembered that the grounds are not large (the distance as the\ncrow flies from the Belvedere to the Temple de l'Amour is only about\n300 yards), but they are carefully laid out, and\u2014except in the\nformal French garden\u2014planted with trees and shrubs so as to give\nan idea of size and distance and prevent the plan of the grounds\nfrom being obvious from any one point. That, in fact, is the\nmeaning of Jardin Anglais (English garden, p. 8).\nNear the kiosk sat a man in slouched hat and cloak whose\nappearance the ladies disliked, and who they afterwards thought\nmight be the Comte de Vaudreuil, well known at the Court of\nMarie Antoinette.\nAt the junction of the paths a man ran up to them from behind\nand directed them to the right as the way to the house. They\nheard but did not see his approach. This running man may, as\nMiss Morison at first supposed, have been one of the gardeners they\nhad spoken to, who, observing that they still did not realise the\nway, pursued them to put them right. This would accord well\nwith his curious smile (pp. 7, 19), for most of us are slightly\namused when others lose their way in a place familiar to our-\nselves. Why, on the other hand, in the \"act of memory\" a mes-\nsenger bringing to Marie Antoinette news of the approach of the\nmob, as they afterwards supposed the man to be, should smile is not\nexplained. The sudden appearance and disappearance of this man\nis easily accounted for, M. Sage thinks, as the paths are narrow\nand tortuous and the shrubs thickly planted. Miss Morison speaks\nof a \"rock (or whatever it was) that shut out the view at the\njunction of the paths\" and over or through which she supposes the\n\f358 \"An Adventure.' [part\nman to have come (pp. 5-6). Neither any mysteriousness in the\nman's appearance and disappearance, nor any strangeness in his\ncostume seems to have struck the ladies at the moment. It was\nonly a week later, on talking it over, that they \"realised for the\nfirst time, the theatrical appearance of the man who spoke to\n[them], the inappropriateness of the wrapped cloak on a warm\nsummer afternoon, the unaccountahleness of his coming and going\"\n(p. 12). His accent puzzled them somewhat. It is suggested, as\nfitting with the \"act of memory,\" that it may have been Austrian\npronunciation of French (p. 22) or Breton (p. 65), but M. Sage\nremarks \" il-y-a de bizarres accents en Seine-et-Oise,\" and much\ncannot be based on that.\nIt is interesting to note that \" the rock or whatever it was that\nshut out the view at the junction of the paths\" (pp. 5-6) becomes\ndefinitely an \"isolated rock standing up as we saw it behind the\nrunning man \" on p. 71, to correspond with what the authors regard\nas the aspect of the garden in 1789. On p. 54, \" he stood in front of a\nrock, and seemed to come either over, round, or through it.\" On p. 113,\n\" he came over and stood witli his back against rocks of considerable\nsize piled on one another.\" It seems rather odd, by the way, that\na messenger in a hurry should come over a rock, and very mysterious\nthat he should come through it, unless, indeed, the implication is\nthat the rock was identical with the grotto in which, according to\ntradition, the Queen sat when the messenger came to her (p. 58).\nAbout this grotto we are told (p. 61) that \"though a '\nruisseau\n'\npassed through it, persons could go freely out at both ends\"; but\nthen how could it be at the same time an isolated rock (p. 71) and\nwhere was the \"ruisseau'\"?\nAfter the rustic bridge, the way by which the ladies approached\nthe house is too vaguely indicated to be securely traced. M. Sage\nthinks it most likely that they followed the dotted line (see map).\nMiss Morison says the \"pathway led under trees; it skirted a narrow\nmeadow of long grass, bounded on the further side by trees, and\nvery much overshadowed by trees growing in it. This . . . shut out\nthe view of the house until we were close to it \" (pp. 7-8). Miss\nLamont says: \"We then followed a narrow path till almost im-\nmediately we came upon the English garden front of the Petit\nTrianon \"\n(pp. 19-20). Near the house Miss Morison saw a lady,\nunnoticed by Miss Lamont, wearing a pale green fichu and sitting\non a seat on the grass. She took her at the time for a tourist\n(pp. 8, 9), but now supposes it may have been a vision of Marie\n\f\f\f\f\fLXIII.] Review. 359\nAntoinette, who they find possessed in 1789 green bodices and white\nfichus (p. 75.) A green bodice with a white muslin fichu over it\nwould look greenish. The idea seems to have been suggested by a\nreport heard by Miss Lamont in November, 1901, \"that on a certain\nday in August Marie Antoinette is regularly seen sitting outside\nthe garden front at the Petit Trianon, with a light flapping hat\nand a pink dress \" (p. 22). This legend, however, they tell us, \" is\nof course incapable of proof\" (p 74).\nThe Petit Trianon has terraces on its north and west sides\u2014 the\nwest one fitting in architecturally with the French garden. From\nthis terrace the ladies looked over into the Cour d'honneur on\nthe south (the only way into the house for visitors), inaccessible\nfrom where they were, and then moved towards one of the long\nwindows, which was unshuttered (p. 9). These movements seem\nsufficient to suggest to any one watching them that they wished to\nget into the house and did not know how to proceed, and probably\naccount for a young man politely coming to them and showing them\nthe way round. He \"looked inquisitively amused\" as he did so\n(pp. 10, 20), like the running man.\nThere are, however, two mysteries connected with this man. In\nthe first place the ladies thought he came out of a door which he\nbanged behind him, and four years later (p. 80) identified the building\nfrom which he came as the disused chapel (M on the map) from\nwhich no openable door on to the terrace has existed for many\nyears. A door now inaccessible from inside once opened on to what\nis now a small separate terrace or balcony, and they make out to\ntheir satisfaction that there was once a connection on a level between\nthis terrace and the one on which they stood. We do not profess\nto be able to follow their reconstruction of the altered terrace with\ncomplete conviction, but assuming them to be right about this, their\nsuggestion is that the}' were approached by a ghostly man walking\nalong a ghostly terrace. The chapel door in question is only partially\nvisible now from the terrace on which they remember standing, and\nanother door observed by M. Sage about 10 ft. further west and\nsuggested by him as a more plausible alternative is not visible\nfrom the terrace at all. On the whole our own suggestion would\nbe that a noise as of a banging door occurred simultaneously with\nthe approach of the man, and suggested to them in recollection\nthat he came through a door.\nThe other mystery we have already referred to. It is that, as\nthe ladies neither remember walking so far round as is necessary\n\f360 An Adventure'' [part\nin order to get from the west side of the house to the Court of\nHonour, nor entering the Avenue des deux Trianons by so narrow\na path as the present one, they think they may, in order to reach\ntheir destination, have been transported by a roadway that existed\nthrough the buildings in Marie Antoinette's time where there is now\nsolid building with no gates (pp. 88, 89) ! We may remark that in the\nincident of \" the chapel man \" the ladies themselves played in the\nsupposed act of memory the part of intruders observed by the Queen\nwhile sitting in front of the house, while in the incident of the\nrunning man their part was that of the Queen herself. This, how-\never, may be what happens in \" acts of memory.\"\nThese are the principal incidents of the \" Adventure.\" In others\nthere seems even less solid foundation for a supernormal explanation.\nWe ought perhaps to refer to supposed hallucinatory music heard\nby Miss Lamont on a subsequent visit in 1902, and believed by her\nto have been of the date of Marie Antoinette\u2014\"faint music as of\na band, not far off\" (p. 29). She ascertained that no band was\nplaying in the grounds for the public benefit on that day. She\nwrote down from memory about 12 bars, but these are not repro-\nduced in the book, and have not been found consecutively in any\nmusic examined. They may of course be so characteristic as to\nbe convincing, but even in that case may have been an appro-\npriate hallucinatory reproduction of Miss Lamont's general recollec-\ntions of eighteenth century music. On the other hand, a more\nrealistic explanation may be afforded by the fact that a good deal\nof exercising of soldiers goes on constantly in the neighbourhood of\nVersailles and the Trianons, and that snatches of military band music\nmight well be heard, M. Sage tells us. It is true that in a later part\nof the book the sounds are said to be \" of a band of violins \"\n(p. 94),\nbut as they were faint and intermittent it seems not impossible that\nthere was some uncertainty about the instruments.\nIn conclusion, while gladly admitting that Miss Morison and Miss\nLamont have produced a very readable book and have taken praise-\nworthy trouble in looking up historical facts and traditions, we\ncannot honestly say that they appear to us to have added anything\nof interest on the positive side of Psychical Research. The founda-\ntions on which the supernormal claims of the \"Adventure\" are\nbuilt are too slight, and too little allowance is made for the\nweaknesses of human memory both in adding to and subtracting\nfrom facts\u2014weaknesses from which there is no reason to think the\nwriters of this book suffer less than the rest of the world.\n\fLXIII.] Review. 361\nThe Tenth Declamation of (Pseudo-) Quintilian. A Lecture delivered\nin the Hall of Corpus Christi Coilege on May 11, 1911, by ROBINSON\nEllis, Corpus Professor of Latin Literature. (London and Oxford,\nHenry Frowde. Is. net. Pp. 24.)\nThis last work of the doyen of Oxford Latinists may be read with\ninterest and profit by all psychical researchers, for, as the Professor\nhimself points out in his preface, the declamation he has selected for\ntranslation \"is interesting spiritualisticatty, I do not suppose that\nany ghost story has ever been recorded so circumstantially, and this\nis my chief reason for selecting it.\" The declamation is a plea\nsupposed to be made on behalf of a mother whose only son had\ndied, but reappeared to her looking well and happy on the night\nafter his cremation, and regularly afterwards, growing more confident\nand substantial and ultimately materializing completely, embracing\nher and conversing with her all night. The lady at last got the\nghost to promise to appear also to his father, and then told her\nexperience to her husband. The result, however, was different from\nwhat she expected. The father \" was afraid to see his son\n\"\n(ch. 6 s.f), whose return from his tomb he apparently considered\nquite improper. So he employed a magician to pronounce incanta-\ntions in order to confine the ghost within the sepulchre, and, to\nmake assurance doubly sure, also closed up the sepulchre with iron\nclamps. The effect was immediate. The ghost ceased to pay his\nnightly visit of consolation, and after his third failure, the mother\nmade inquiries, and discovered what had been done. Her indigna-\ntion was so intense that she brought an action for cruelty (malae\ntractationis) against her husband. Hence the declamation.\nOf course it cannot be inferred that the declamation was suggested\nby any actual case. But its author shows fine logical acumen and\nknowledge of human nature. He shows the true spirit of psychical\nresearch, and had evidently reflected more than most on the problem\nof the relation of the living to the departed, while his work is at\nany rate good evidence of the state of opinion and sentiment at the\ntime. It is astonishing how very modern it all sounds. The whole\nstory might have happened yesterday, except that a modern British\nfather, troubled with a ghost-seeing wife, would either have had the\nghost laid by a priestly exorcist, or have appealed to a doctor to\ncertify his wife for admission to an asylum. But no change of\ntimes and religious profession has altered the ordinary practical\nattitude and sentiment towards the revenant that won't stay dead.\n\f3G2 Dr. F. G. S. Schiller. [part lxiii.]\nThe judges doubtless decided against the mother, and would do so\nstill, and so long as such is the normal attitude, it is no wonder\nthat the seeds of scientific knowledge which a rare chance scatters\nare slow to take root in the unpropitious soil of social prejudice.\nIt is worth noting that the author of the Declamation had a very\ngood notion of psychical evidence. He is careful to note that the\nphantom could not be ascribed to expectant attention, because \"alarm,\nnot grief, was uppermost when the ghost first stepped suddenly before\nme\" (ch. 13), and that the mothei- only gradually became convinced\nof its genuine objectivity (ch. f4). He argues strenuously against\nthe supposition that it was a dream or subjective illusion, and traces\na growth in confidence and materiality in the apparition itself (ch. 6).\nHe scores good points by emphasizing that the lady had no reason\nnot to expect her son's appearance after the incantation, and that\nher sentiment was logically far more natural and rational than her\nhusband's, whose psychology, in palliating his dread of the abnormal\nunder the guise of solicitude for his wife's health, he depicts very\nsubtly. He clearly ranks himself among the precursors of pragma-\ntism by enunciating the mother's \"right of believing\" in the more\nconsoling interpretation of her experiences (ch. 13). And, lastly, he\nvery definitely raises two of the chief cruxes about such psychical\nevidence generally \u2014 viz. how is it that in advanced cases, whether\nspontaneous or experimental (spiritistic), these phantoms seem to\n'materialize'? and how is it that apparently fatuous exorcisms seem\nto be efficacious in laying '\nghosts ' 1 The second of these questions\nis probably the more urgent of the two for psychical researchers to\nanswer; for they might hope to discover why phantoms materialize\nif they could only catch them. If, however, 'ghosts' have been\nrendered thoroughly distrustful by men's instinctive unfriendliness,\nand shrink from the unsolicited insults of exorcists, it may take the\npsychical researcher a long time to convince them that he is not\nmerely a modern disguise of the old exorcist, but genuinely appre-\nciative of a genuine apparition. And then we may possibly cease\nto encounter uniform failure in our attempts to interview 'ghosts'!\nF. C. S.

This is, indeed, \" the burden of an\nhonour unto which I was not born.\" My illustrious prede-\ncessors have been eminent in the most severe sciences\n\u2014\ninvolving an extensive knowledge of the mathematics, in the\nfirst place; and, in the second, a personal and intimate\nacquaintance with the natural history of the fugitive molecule,\nand the shy and retiring ion. Among such distinguished\npredecessors I may be permitted to mention Professor Barrett,\nof the Old Guard. We argue glibly, now, for or against\n\" telepathy.\" The idea of such intercommunication of distant\nminds, or brains, or both, not through the normal channels of\nsense, is as familiar to modern savages, \" vacant of our glorious\ngains,\" as it was to Hegel ;\nand, again, as it is to the\nuntutored Gaelic-speaking Celts of North-Western Scotland.\nThe term \" telepathy \" we owe to Mr. Myers. But Professor\nBarrett, as early as 1870, introduced what we now call\n\" telepathy \" to the notice of the British Association itself at\nGlasgow, of all places, and presently he made the earliest\nexperiments of note in \" thought-transference \" between persons\nin normal conditions.

A faculty\nwhich had been dismissed to the limbo of popular superstitions\nturns out to be a fact, and a serviceable fact. I cannot but\nregret and condemn the flippancy of my Lord Byron, the poet.\nHis mother-in-law, Lady Milbanke, was a dowser or water-\nfinder, with the divining rod. On her regretted demise, Lord\nByron said that she would find the faculty useful in the place\nwhere, according to his teleology, she had gone\n!\nSome of my predecessors in this Chair have been distinguished\nmoral philosophers ; others have been statesmen ; others meta-\nphysicians ; others have been psychologists, learned in the\nmechanism of the brain and the nerves.\nOne was a poet with a note of his own, unique and\nunmistakable, the differentia of a poet ; he was a keen and\ngracious literary critic too ; a scholar, whom I first knew in\nthe merits of his Latin verse ; in fact was universally gifted.\nHe, over and above all this, was a humourist. Yet he turned\naway, in seeking an aim for his energy, from all these\nthings, and devoted himself to Psychical Research. He studied\nthe arcana of body and mind ; he made himself an authority\nabout hypnotism\u2014recognised as such by the authoritative ; he\nwas the Pounder, it may be said, and the inspirer of modern\nPsychical Research, and, happy in his friends, he was accom-\npanied by others who could temper, by a sagacious and\nhumorous scepticism, the enthusiasm of his nature. That poetic\nenthusiasm, however, was indeed bridled in him, as I have\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., pp. 2-282; Vol. XV., pp. 130-383.\n\f366 Andrew Lang. [part\nalready suggested, by a gift extremely rare among the earnest,\nof a keen sense of humour, an exquisite irony.\nNo Society with aims like ours, not, indeed, novel, but\nnew in our age, could be more fortunate than ours was in\nthe leadership of that group ; of Mr. Henry Sidgwick, Mr.\nEdmund Gurney, Professor Barrett, Mr. Frederic Myers, and\nlatest lost, Mr. Podmore, whose mission was to throw cold\nwater on too sanguine brethren. In our other Presidents we\nhave been happy enough to possess men of the highest intel-\nligence in the most varied fields of life and action ;\nwhile, in\nthe only lady who has presided over us, we recognise the\npatience and open mind of Science, truly so called, with the\nresolute fairness and absence of bias, and, if I may use a term\nnot really frivolous, with the sportsmanlike quality\u2014which\nis far from being universally present even in scientific his-\ntorians ; and even in leaders of physical science.\nOn this matter of fairness much is to be said : for the\npeculiarity of many of our honourable adversaries is that they\nbelieve us to have a bias, and themselves to have none. Now\nevery thinking and rational being is, naturally, of bias and\nprejudice all compact. The essential mark of the scientific\ntemperament is to know that bias we all have, and to guard\nagainst it. Monsieur Charles Eichet states the case well in\nour Proceedings (Vol. V., p. 22). \"There is such a thing as\ngood faith, perfect, stainless, absolute ; but we almost never\nmeet it, and should not even expect it in ourselves. Strive as\nwe may, we are always led on, more or less, to give a coup de\nponce, that is, to press our conclusions in the direction which\nwe prefer. We may resist the temptation ; but that is un-\navailing, for, if we do, we press too hard in the opposite\ndirection, which is just as bad and dangerous.\"\nExactly ; but not as dangerous to ourselves. In such deli-\ncate equilibrium let us tip the balance against our desires.\nWe may be wrong, either way, but if we give that little\ntouch, that coup de pouce, against our inclinations, at least our\nconsciences are clear. Besides not much can be lost to the\ncause of knowledge by the tiny tip of the balance against our\ninclinations. If we have no evidence so firm that it cannot\nkeep its equilibrium against a mere coup de pouce, then our\nevidence is almost nAgligcablc.\n\fLXIV.] Presidential Address. 367\nIndeed it is true that the subjects which we study are\nextremely evasive; like tricksy follets which play at hide and\nseek with us. But this is not a peculiarity of our topics alone.\nHow often does it happen that, in history, we almost lay our\nhands on the truth, but are disappointed by a mutilated docu-\nment ! In the study of Homer and his age, we are baulked\nby the spoliation of ancient burial cairns, and by a blank in an\nimportant passage of Diogenes Laertius. The fairies have spirited\naway the essential words ;\n\" the Irruntarinia have taken them,\"\nas the natives of Central Australia say\u2014but we pursue our\nstudies, historical and archaeological ; and in psychical research,\nin spite of all the evasions of the truth for which we seek,\nwe should not be more easily daunted than in history and\narchaeology.\nIt is in no conventional humility that I recognise my too\npatent inferiority to each and every one of the former\nPresidents of our Society, and to many of its actual members,\nwhom I would gladly see in my place. Not only am\nI ignorant of physiology and experimental psychology, but I\nhave only once, by accident, seen a person under hypnotic\ninfluence, and I never but once was in the same room with\na professional medium,\u2014a famous medium she was,\u2014but a\ncomplete failure on that occasion ! I have lately been taxed\nby the author of a book on our subject (a book which I\nhappened to review) with my \" aristocratic \" aversion (he called\nit \" aristocratic \") to paid mediums. But surely the reasons for\nmy sentiment are conspicuous enough. If there be such\nfaculties as telepathy, premonition, clairvoyance, and the powers\nof holding intercourse with the dead, and summoning them up\nin material form, we have good reason to think that such\nfaculties cannot be turned on at will, punctually, for money\ndown. As The Scholar-Gipsy says :\n\" It needs heaven-sent moments for this skill.\"\nConsequently the punctual paid medium, being human, and\nearning a livelihood by his or her alleged faculty for making\ntables float in air, or jump about the room, is tempted to cheat,\nand gets caught by the ankle, like Eusapia, where her ankle\nshould not be. Our records abound in examples of the\ndetection and exposure of paid mediums, to whom the most\n\f368 Andrevo Lang.

But in\nmy own mind the enormous volume of historical and an-\nthropological reports of supernormal phenomena, and their\nstriking uniformity with alleged modern experiences, produces\nthe conviction that so much smoke can only be ex-\nplained by the existence of some fire. I must not speak of\nthe psychical experiences of savages ;\nthese, for want of\ncontemporary records duly attested, are illustrative, not evi-\ndential. Nor must I, for the same reason, dilate on the\nstrange stories of the psychical experiences of men of genius.\nThis is a most curious theme. Among such cases, in various\ndegrees, I have observed those of the wraith of Byron, seen by\nSir Robert Peel ; of incidents in the lives of George Sand,\nGoethe, Dickens, Thackeray, Lord Nelson, Dr. Donne, Shelley\n;\nthe last words of de Quincey\u2014a most pathetic story ;\n\u2014the\nexperiences of Sir Walter Scott ; and\u2014not in the supernormal\nexactly, but in the \" subliminal \" way\u2014a record, from his own\npen, of the Duke of Wellington. But this is \" the blue smoke \"\n\fLXIV.] Presidential Address. 369\nof literature ; and of history, you will say. Still, with this blue\nsmoke there is some fire, as the cause thereof. The Duke of\nWellington, in a private letter of his, published in Sir Herbert\nMaxwell's Life of that great man, could not guess that he\nwas playing into the hands of Mr. Myers's theory of the\nSubliminal Self, and Mr. Myers obviously never read the letter.\nTo be fair is the first thing of all, and I dare to say that\nthe Society has been fair. It is not in human nature not to\nmake mistakes, and never to be inclined to accept evidence\nwhich examination proves to be erroneous ; never to indulge in\nhypotheses which criticism demonstrates to be worthless. But\nwhen the Society has been deceived, it has not concealed the\nfact, and, as to hypotheses, as a Society we have none. The\nSociety, as such, has no views, no beliefs, no hypotheses, except\nperhaps the opinion that there is an open field of inquiry\n;\nthat not all the faculties and potentialities of man have been\nstudied and explained, up to date, in terms of nerve and brain.\njSTow this opinion is also, I presume, entertained by the most\nstalwart and emancipated \" rationalists.\" Their belief, however,\nI suppose, is that everything in human nature can be, and\nprobably will be, explained on terms, chemical and biological,\nsatisfactory to themselves. The members of the Society, as a\nrule, perhaps, though not necessarily, are not absolutely sure of\nthat : perhaps there are other things to be discovered, though\nwhat these other things may be, at present we know not. This\nmere conception of the possibility of the existence of faculties\nnot readily to be explained in terms of what, in the airy\ncurrency of speech, we call \" matter,\" is, I think, that in the\nSociety which irritates so many people. If other members\nof the Society agree with me in the hope (in my own case the\nbelief) that many orthodox theories of all kinds are apt to be\nupset in the course of time, that new fields of knowledge are\nperhaps to be annexed, our attitude may, doubtless, be called\nEomantic. Yet in other fields I have seen my early romantic\naspirations made actual ; I have seen a vast region of the historic\npast, in which from boyhood I fervently believed, thrown open\nby the spade of the excavator. I have seen Homer's \" golden\nMycenae \" and \" Crete of the Hundred Cities \" won from the\nrealm of dreams by Dr. Schliemann, and by Mr. Arthur Evans,\nand their followers.\n\f370 Andrew Lang. [part\nTherefore I may not live to see, but I hope that later\ngenerations will see, certain world-old world-wide beliefs find\nscientific recognition. Hegel believed in almost all the \" super-\nnormal \" phenomena which we, not necessarily believing in\nthem, have the audacity to study : and the brain of Hegel was\nnot, as Mr. Carlyle said of Mr. Keble's, \" the brain of a\nrabbit.''\nI spoke of my desire to be fair, and in my desire to be\nfair I have deliberately exhibited my bias, my romantic pre-\npossessions. I would, as a matter of taste, prefer certain facts\nto be established, rather than not. I would even welcome\nwith pleasure an indisputable Poltergeist ; not that I think him\na desirable inmate of the universe\u2014far from it. When I say\nPoltergeist, I mean an authenticated instance of the queer\ndisturbances and movements of objects, of which history is so\nfull. Thus in a very early Life of St. Dunstan we find that,\nas a boy, he was a Somnambule, in mature life was a centre\nof Hying and falling stones, and, before death, was bodily\nlevitated, bed and all, before the eyes of the bewildered monks.\nThese are not saintly miracles. Men would rather conceal\nthan invent them about a holy man, and they are parallel in\ncharacter to those modern instances on which Mr. Barrett\nlately read a paper, and to Claire Claremont's case, as given\nin the journals of herself and Shelley. In short I am not\ncertain that this kind of thing never occurs. But to suggest\nto little poltergeistish boys, by a gentle correction, that they\nshould not be mediums, appears a sagacious measure. I have\nlived to see many so-called scientific certainties proved to be\nfleeting phantasms of hypothesis, and more of them, I think,\nwill go by the primrose path to the gulf and grave of\nLachmann\u2014and other learned persons ! But these expressions\nof bias are only made in a spirit of fairness, and I must not,\ndare not, say that the scientifically orthodox would rather\nprefer that there were no Poltergeist ; even nothing correspond-\ning to what we call \" Telepathy.\" The orthodox believe them-\nselves, I am aware, to be wholly destitute of bias and\nprejudice,\u2014and surely they ought to know ! But were I to\nthink myself destitute of bias, I would be mournfully bereft of\nhumour ;\nand, were I to conceal the circumstance, I would be\nequally devoid of honour.\n\fLXIV.] Presidential Address. 371\nNone the less, I do not, at present, believe in a Poltergeist :\nin fact, for the moment, you have a sceptical President, who\ngives the cowp de police against his inclinations. Other pre-\njudices possess me which I shall later divulge. As they are\non the sceptical side, perhaps they ought not to be called\n\" prejudices,\" but \" the intuitive monitions of stalwart common-\nsense, and genuine inductive science.\" (I have always heard\nthat Inductive science is \" true and tender,\" and Deductive\nscience \" an old offender.\")\nMeanwhile, though entirely destitute of hostile bias, our\ncritics are, certainly, a little careless and inaccurate. Perhaps\nthis error springs from a strong consciousness of intellectual\nsuperiority. They should remember that their native genius\ncan scarcely be superior to that of the great Napoleon, who\nfell, to the regret of the Whig party, and of Lord Byron, and\nMr. Hazlitt, by plunging into wintry Eussia without waiting\nfor the arrival of his supplies, and without even providing\ninstruments calculated to prevent his cavalry from slipping\nabout on the frozen roads. With the same Napoleonic con-\nfidence in their own intellectual superiority, our adversaries\ncriticise us without taking the trouble to read what we have\nwritten ; or even to re-read what they have written themselves.\nThis negligence can only arise from their sense of intellectual\ngreatness. Thus a friend of my own, whom I do not name,\nwas criticising the Society's Census of Hallucinations. \" Thou-\nsands of persons,\" he wrote, \" were asked whether they had\never seen apparitions, and out of these people some hundreds,\nmostly intelligent foreigners, replied in the affirmative.\" There\nwas no truth in these assertions ! Of the persons who\nanswered the questions (which, of course, did not ask \" whether\nthey had seen apparitions\") in the affirmative, 1499 were of\nBritish birth, 185 were not, and, of course, were therefore\n\" unintelligent.\" \" For all that I can see, foreigners is fools.\"\nI had vainly warned my scientific friend that his statistics, as\nto the proportions of British subjects and undesirable aliens,\nwere incorrect. Confident in his intellectual superiority, he\nrushed, like Napoleon, on his doom, and published his fantastic\nstatistics. I might also mention a foreign critic, foreign but\nnot unintelligent, Herr Dr, Parish, author of a popular work,\nHallucinations and. Illusions. He, too, criticised the Society's\n\f372 Andrew Lang. [part\nCensus of Hallucinations: He got rid of the phenomena by\nmisstating the facts in the report under his eyes, and by then\nexplaining away stories which, as he gave them, were of his\nown unconscious manufacture. He also accused the reporters\nof not taking the very precautions which they did take and\nespecially emphasised !\nAgain, Dr. Pierre Janet (foreign, I admit, but intelligent),\nin his work, Les Nivroses et les Idles Fixes (1898), made much\nuse of Miss Goodrich Freer's valuable paper on \" Crystal Gazing\n\"\nin the Society's Proceedings. But he attributed this lady's ex-\nperiences not to herself, but, now to \" a young girl,\" now to\n\" a poor seeress,\" now to \" a rather mystic person.\" He then\ntriumphantly explained the experiences\u2014by the theory which\nMiss Goodrich Freer had herself advanced in the vast majority\nof cases, namely, by the revival of memories\u2014but he did this\nwithout saying that the lady had anticipated him.1\nThis kind of criticism \" is not cricket,\" perhaps ; but nobody\nis ever consciously unfair. We are all only subject to the\nhallucinations of our bias, to Bacon's \" spectres of the cave\n\"\n(idola speens), and men of science, like Sir David Brewster,\nhave before now given, not the coup de pouce, but the coup de\nbottc, to their own signed and written statements of their own\nstrange experiences. Almost equally painful examples of this\nerror, the error of superior persons in thinking themselves\ninfallible, may be gleaned from a work no older than yesteryear,\nStudies in Spiritism, by Miss Amy E. Tanner, Ph.D.2\nMiss\nTanner is a Doctor of Philosophy, of what University I know\nnot. On some points I think, against my bias, that she is\nright in her criticisms, but am open to conviction if she can\nbe proved to be wrong. On her first page she states that\n\" the Psychical Eesearchers \" (under correction I suppose her\nto mean the Society for Psychical Eesearch) \" have printed\nvoluminously, persistently calling their work '\nscientific,' and\nmaintaining that they have '\nproved ' certain facts bearing in\nthe most fundamental way upon personal survival after death.\"\n\" Whereby we have \" drawn to ourselves \" a large following,\"\naud so forth, and so forth.

If Mr. Feilding and other observers\nthought that Eusapia did some inexplicable things in their\npresence, and said so in our Proceedings, other members of our\nSociety arose and said, in the same work, that the performances\nmight be very easily explained by the old familiar tricks. But\nso superior are our critics that this simple fact\u2014every member\nmay air his own opinions, and the Society has contracted itself\nout of all responsibility for every opinion\u2014is unknown to our\ncensors. By sheer force of native genius, they may say what\nthey please, quite independent of the simple truth. Not only\ndoes the Society abstain from offering any opinion as to the\nSociety's having \" proved \" certain facts bearing in the most\nfundamental way upon personal survival after death, or any\nother facts, but the Society continually publishes the essays of\nmembers who maintain, in certain cases, that no such proofs\nhave been produced. A member is very welcome to disprove,\nif he thinks he can, all evidence even for Telepathy. The\nmembers who argue on the negative side, as regards commu-\nnication with the dead, in the Proceedings of the Society are,\nI think, more numerous than the members\u2014if any such\nmembers exist\u2014who argue in the affirmative : who say that\nsuch communications are proved. Of course if our critics say\n\" you should not publish the observations of members with\nwhom we do not agree,\" of members who take the affirmative\nside, I understand them, and partly sympathise with them.\nBut, unluckily, the constitution of the Society obliges us to\nhear all parties, and to side with none.\nMy own bias, to proceed in the path of confession, curls\naway from Mrs. Biper and from all professional mediums. A\ncase of abnormal psychology so curious as hers is worthy, indeed,\nof the study of orthodox psychologists, and I would be the last\nto complain if our Society left her for three or four years in\nthe hands of savants who think, like Dr. Hall, that they might\n\f374 Andrew Lang. [part\nsucceed in exorcising all her \" sub-personalities,\" all her \" com-\nmunicators,\" and making her a perfectly normal human being\n;\nwhich she is, apparently, when she does not voluntarily pass\ninto a very curious and enigmatic mental condition. As to\nthe real nature of that condition\u2014as to whether, when appar-\nently entranced, she is acutely conscious\u2014the reports of Dr.\nHall and Dr. Tanner are too self-contradictory and too casual\nto enable me to form any opinion. One cannot even be\ncertain that on all occasions the condition is absolutely the\nsame.\nMy own opinions are almost identical with the hesitations\nof the late Professor William James as described by him in\nthe Proceedings. Much more evidence than has been published\nis needed before I can enter into the way of belief in the\nidentity of Mrs. Piper's \" communicators \" with the dead men\nthat they profess to be. As at present instructed, I believe\nin nothing of the sort. In the matter of experiments I prefer\nto deal with highly-educated British subjects, such as the ladies\nto whom we are obliged for so many automatic writings. I\nhave read with much interest and some agreement Dr. Tanner's\ncriticisms of what are called \" Cross-Correspondences.\" But\ncriticism of her criticisms in detail I must leave to writers\nbetter accpuainted than myself with those perplexing documents.\nAt the lowest they illustrate the singular workings of the sub-\nconscious mind, especially in the matter of impersonation. I\nhave read, for example, passages in the documents which bring\nto my ears the very accents of the voice of one of the \" com-\nmunicators,\" and imitations of his style which, I think, the\nconscious self of the most consummate parodist could not\ncompose. In short, there are cases in which communicators\nare at once so perfectly impersonated and so thoroughly false,\nthat our rude forefathers would have regarded the subconscious\nself as a synonym for the Devil. If this view were correct\nit would give a great shock to the Eationalist.\nAfter prolonged study of the documents, I find myself in\ncomplete bewilderment over the Cross-Correspondences, with a\ntendency to think that, in matters so vast, so various, and so\nincoherent, it must needs be that patient ingenuity will dis-\ncover correspondences which some minds will accept as the\nresult of design, and others as the result of fortuitous coincidence.\n\fLXIV.] PresiclentiaI Address. 375\nBetween chance coincidences, and subconscious memories; by\nsupposing, for example, that Mrs. Verrall had read the Neo-\nplatonists though she believed she had not, Dr. Tanner can\nexplain away most things. Yet if she has herself read Plotinus,\nPorphyry and Iamblichus in the original Greek, I am sure\nshe will admit that she could not entirely forget the circum-\nstance ; these writers demand more serious application than an\nordinary novel.\nWhen it comes to three cases of predictions automatically\nwritten, Dr. Tanner is puzzled. Subconscious memory will not\nexplain, but why not try chance coincidence ? Apparently\nDr. Tanner does perceive, though many other critics do not,\nthat the theory of chance coincidence may be overworked.\nOn one \" supernormal \" point I have to confess myself\nresolutely credulous, namely telepathy. The word \" telepathy,\"\nof course, is a merely technical term to cover a variety of\nincidents, some of which, but not all, might be explained on\nthe hypothesis that minds may intercommunicate by other\nmeans than the channels of the senses. On this point I am\nconvinced by personal experience, by experiments, made in my\npresence, and by others, carefully and contemporaneously re-\ncorded by friends whom I can entirely trust, and by spon-\ntaneous experiments of the same and other friends. Of course\nthe evidence which, in the circumstances, is sufficient for me,\nneed not be convincing to, or, perhaps, need not even be\nthought worthy of a moment's consideration by other people.\nStill, I am wholly convinced. When Dr. Tanner's ally, Dr.\nStanley Hall, writes, \" only when conditions can be so con-\ntrolled that, e.g., a teacher can announce beforehand that, on\nsuch a day, hour, and place he will demonstrate these things,\ncan or will they be accepted by any sound scientific mind,\"\none is merely amazed by the learned Doctor's attitude. For\nmy part I should at once regard the \" teacher \" as a humbug.\nIf either Keats or Wordsworth had announced that, in a\nteacher's lecture-room, on January 29, 1820, at three forty-\nfive p.m., he would write an ode of immortal merit, and if he\ndid write it,\u2014we all see that he must have composed his\npoem before he made his promise, and committed it to\nmemory. \" The wind \" of poetic inspiration \" bloweth where it\nlisteth,\" and so does the telepathic breeze, which requires a\n\f376 Andrew Lang. [part\nharmony of an unguessed-at kind between two or more minds.\nThus experimenters may now hit on the \" heaven-sent moment,\"\nand now miss it. If \" sound scientific minds \" will not believe\nin telepathy till its conditions can be punctually produced to\norder, they can never believe in it at all. I see no reason to\nsuppose that the existence of telepathy can ever be de-\nmonstrated to the satisfaction of this order of scientific\nintellect. But, believing in telepathy myself, I take pleasure\nin the opinion that we do not yet know all about everything\n;\nthat, if we persevere, we may discover numbers of curious and\ninteresting things.\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 377\nII.\n\u00ab\nPOLTERGEISTS, OLD AND NEW.\nBy Professor W. F. BARRETT, F.R.S.\nPerhaps I may be permitted to express my own gratifi-\ncation, and I venture to say that of the whole Society, in\nthe announcement we have just heard, that Mr. Andrew Lang\nhas accepted the office of President for the ensuing year. It\nis an appropriate coincidence that this announcement should\nsynchronize with the reading of a paper on a subject to\nwhich Mr. Lang has devoted so much historical research and\nliterary skill.\nThe term \" Poltergeist \" is translated Hobgoblin in our\nGerman dictionaries, but that is not the equivalent, nor have\nwe any English equivalent to the German word. It is\nderived from polter, a rumbling noise, or poltern, to make a\nrow, to rattle ; a polterer is a boisterous fellow, a poltergeist\ntherefore a boisterous ghost. It is a convenient term to\ndescribe those apparently meaningless noises, disturbances and\nmovements of objects, for which we can discover no assignable\ncause.\nThe phenomena are especially sporadic, breaking out sud-\ndenly and unexpectedly, and disappearing as suddenly after a\nfew days, or weeks, or months of annoyance to those con-\ncerned. They differ from hauntings, inasmuch as they appear\nto be attached to an individual, usually a young person, more\nthan to a place, or rather to a person in a particular place.\nMoreover, ghostly forms (except, if we may trust one or two\nwitnesses, a hand and arm) are not seen. They appear to\nhave some intelligence behind them, for they frequently\nrespond to requests made for a given number of raps ; the\nintelligence is therefore in some way related to our intelli-\ngence, and moreover is occasionally in telepathic rapport with\n\f378 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nour minds. For in one case, which I submitted to a long\nand searching enquiry, I found that when I mentally asked\nfor a given number of raps, no word being spoken, the re-\nsponse was given promptly and correctly, and this four times\nin succession, a different number being silently asked for in\neach case. There are other characteristics which bring the\nsubject of poltergeists into close connection with the physical\nphenomena of spiritualism. The movement of objects is\nusually quite unlike that due to gravitational or other attrac-\ntion. They slide about, rise in the air, move in eccentric\npaths, sometimes in a leisurely manner, often turn round in\ntheir career, and usually descend quietly without hurting the\nobservers. At other times an immense weight is lifted, often\nin daylight, no one being near, crockery is thrown about and\nbroken, bedclothes are dragged off, the occupants sometimes\nlifted gently to the ground, and the bedstead tilted up or\ndragged about the room. The phenomena occur both in\nbroad daylight and at night. Sometimes bells are con-\ntinuously rung, even if all the bell wires are removed. Stones\nare frequently thrown, but no one is hurt ; I myself have\nseen a large pebble drop apparently from space in a room\nwhere the only culprit could have been myself, and certainly\nI did not throw it. Loud scratchings on the bedclothes,\nwalls and furniture are a frequent characteristic ; sometimes\na sound like whispering or panting is heard, and footsteps are\noften heard without any visible cause. More frequently than\notherwise the disturbances are associated with the presence\nof children or young people, and cease when they are taken\nfrom the place where the disturbance originated, only to be\nrenewed on their return, and then abruptly the annoyance\nends.\nIf upon the cessation of the disturbances, investigators\nappear on the scene and ask for something to occur in their\npresence, and are sufficiently persistent and incredulous, they\nmay possibly see a clumsy attempt to reproduce some of the\nphenomena, and will thereupon catch the culprit child in\nthe act. Then we hear the customary \" I told you so,\"\nand forthwith the clever investigator will not fail to let the\nworld know of his acumen, and how credulous and stupid\neverybody is but himself. I will return later on to the\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 379\npsychological cause of this not infrequent simulation of mys-\nterious phenomena, especially by children.\nThe point to which I am anxious to draw attention is the\nessentially temporary and fugitive nature of the phenomena,\nand that if we are fortunate enough to hear of them at once,\nand are able to visit the place whilst the disturbances are\ngoing on, the presence of the most skilful and incredulous\nobserver will not affect the result\u2014and under such circum-\nstances I challenge the scornful to produce a single adverse\nwitness. In fact, to any one who has made a serious and\nprolonged study of the subject of poltergeists, it is simple\nwaste of time to reply to the arguments of those who assert\nthat fraud and hallucination are adequate explanations of the\nwhole phenomena.\nIn the Journal of our Society for 1884, the late Mr.\nPodmore published the report of his investigation of a famous\ncase of poltergeist occurring in a house at Worksop.1\nThe\nenquiry was made five weeks after the disturbances had ceased,\nand unfortunately he did not quote, as Mr. A. Lang points\nout, the contemporaneous and more striking account of the\nphenomena attested by an excellent witness, which Mr. Lang\ngives in full.\n2\nNevertheless Mr. Podmore came to the con-\nclusion that the evidence of the eye-witnesses he examined was\nunimpeachable, and that the phenomena were supernormal ; and\nhe acids at the conclusion of his report :\n\" To suppose that\nthese various objects were all moved by mechanical contri-\nvances argues incredible stupidity, amounting almost to im-\nbecility, on the part of all the persons present who were not\nin the plot.\"\nTwelve years later, in 1896, without further personal in-\nvestigation of this particular case, Mr. Podmore changed his\nviews. Por in a lengthy report on poltergeists, printed in\nVol. XII. of our Proceedings, he suggests that fraud arising\nfrom love of notoriety among young people, and hallucination\non the part of the observers, are the true explanation of the\nmajority of poltergeist phenomena, including the above case.\nThis, of course, is the popular view.\n1\nJournal S.P.R., Vol. I., p. 199, and also Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XII.,\np. 46.\n2\nThe Making of Religion, Appendix B, p. 356.\n2B\n\f380 Professor W.

But more than two\ncenturies ago, one of the earliest Fellows of the Royal Society,\nwhom Mr. Lecky describes as a man of \" incomparable ability,\"\nJoseph Glanvil, the author of Saducismus Triumphatus, dealt\nwith every objection raised by modern critics, and demon-\nstrated that neither fraud nor hallucination was adequate to\nexplain the poltergeist phenomena which were abundant in\nhis day.\n1\nLike all other inexplicable supernormal phenomena,\nit is, as Glanvil says, simply a question of adequate and\ntrustworthy evidence. With all deference, I venture to com-\nmend sceptics who dogmatize on this question to Glanvil's work\non the Vanity of Dogmatizing, a book of which Mr. Lecky\nremarks :\n\" Certainly it would be difficult to find a work dis-\nplaying less of credulity and superstition than this treatise.\"\nI will now pass on to give some of the evidence that exists\non behalf of the genuineness of poltergeist phenomena, beginning\nwith recent cases that have come under my own notice, and\nthen briefly reviewing some of the other abundant evidence\nthat exists in different places, and which stretches back to\nremote periods of time.\n2\nThe Enniscorthy Case.\nThe first case I will relate has recently occurred at Ennis-\ncorthy, a town in Co. Wexford. My attention was drawn to\nthe matter through a letter from the representative of a local\nnewspaper, Mr. Murphy. After some correspondence, and in\nanswer to my request, Mr. Murphy kindly drew up the\naccompanying admirable report\n:\nStatement by Mr. N. J. Murphy,\nThe strange manifestations which took place at Enniscorthy last\n\u2022Tub', 1910, may perhaps interest some students of Psychology, and\n1\nMy copy of Glanvil's Saducismus Triumphatus is the 3rd Edition, published\nin 1700. Glanvil was one of His Majesty's chaplains.\n2\nMr. F. W. H. Myers has given some remarkable and well attested cases of\npoltergeists in two of his papers published in the Proc. S.P.R., Vol. VII.\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and Neiv. 381\nmore particularly the members of the Dublin Section of the Society\nfor Psychical Research.\nAt the outset let me say that I am a journalist by profession\nand in pursuit of \"copy\" for the paper I represent, \"The Ennis-\ncorthy Guardian,\" I was brought into touch with those concerned\nin the manifestations, and introduced to the room where these\nmanifestations occurred.\nThe \" haunted \" house was one in which a labouring man named\nNicholas Redmond and his wife resided in Court Street, Ennis-\ncorthy. Redmond's earnings were supplemented by his wife keeping\nboarders. On the ground floor of the house are two rooms\u2014\na\nshop and a kitchen. Both are lofty and spacious, and the latter is\nsituated under the room in which the manifestations occurred.\nThe upstairs portion of the premises consists of three bedrooms.\nThe floors of these bedrooms are of wood, and are all intact, the\nhouse being a comparatively new one. Two of the bedrooms look\nout on the street, and the third, in which the occurrences took\nplace, is situate at the back of these. All three are entered from\nthe same landing and are on the same level. Redmond and his\nwife slept in the front room immediately adjoining the room in\nwhich the occurrences described below took place. The rear bed-\nroom was occupied by two young men who were boarders. They\nhad separate beds. Their names are John Randall, a native of\nKillurin, in this County, and George Sinnott, of Ballyhogue, in this\nCounty. Both these men are carpenters by trade. I can bear\npersonal testimony to the occurrences which I am about to describe.\nI accepted nothing on hearsay evidence, and I place my experiences\nbefore your Society exactly as the circumstances occurred to me.\nMany of the details have already been published in the daily papers,\nand are quite true, much of what appeared having been written by\nmyself.\nHearing strange rumours about the house, I proceeded to make\nenquiries. The owner of the house replied to my questions that\nthe rumours I had heard of the house were quite true, and in\nresponse to my application for permission to remain all night in\nthe \"haunted\" room, he replied: \"I will make you as comfortable\nas I can, and you can remain as long as you want to, and bring a\nfriend with you, too, because you will feel more comfortable.\" My\nnext move was to procure a volunteer to accompany me, who was\nfound in the person of Mr. Owen Devereux, of the \"Devereux\"\nCycle Works, Enniscorthy. Together we went to the house on the\n\f382 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nnight of the 29th July, 1910, and immediately proceeded to make a\ntour of inspection. Sinnott, Randall and the owner of the house\nhaving gone out of the room for a few moments, we made a close\nBACK OF HOUSE.\nFRONT OF HOUSE.\nThe above is a plan of the room where the young men slept.\ninspection of the apartment. The beds were pulled out from the\nwalls and examined, the clothing being searched ; the flooring was\nminutely inspected, and the walls and fireplace examined. Every-\nthing was found quite normal. Sinnott's bed was placed with the\nhead at the window. The window faced the door as one entered\nthe room. Randall's bed was placed at the opposite end of the\nroom at right angles to Sinnott's, and with the foot to the door.\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and Nevj. 383\nThe two boys prepared to retire, Mrs. Redmond having placed two\nchairs in their bedroom for the use of the narrator and his com-\npanion. The occupants of the room having been comfortably dis-\nposed of\u2014each in his own bed and chair respectively\u2014the light\nwas extinguished. This was about 11.20 p.m.\nThe night was a clear, starlight night. No blind obstructed the\nview from outside, and one could see the outlines of the beds and\ntheir occupants clearly. At about 11.30 a tapping was heard close\nat the foot of Randall's bed. My companion remarked that it\nappeared to be like the noise of a rat eating at timber. Sinnott replied,\n\" You'll soon see the rat it is.\" The tapping went on slowly at\nfirst, say at about the rate of fifty taps to the minute. Then the\nspeed gradually increased to about 100 or 120 per minute, the noise\ngrowing louder. This continued for about five minutes, when it\nstopped suddenly. Randall then spoke. He said :\n\" The clothes\nare slipping off my bed : look at them sliding off. Good God ! they\nare going off me.\" Mr. Devereux immediately struck a match\nwhich he had ready in his hand. The bedclothes had partly left\nthe boy's bed, having gone diagonally towards the foot, going out at\nthe left corner, and not alone did they seem to be drawn off the\nbed, but they appeared to be actually going back under the bed\nmuch in the same position one would expect bedclothes to be if a\nstrong breeze were blowing through the room at the time. But\nthen everything was perfectly calm.\nMr. Devereux lighted the candle and a thorough search was made\nunder the bed for strings or wires, but nothing could be found.\nRandall, who stated that this sort of thing had occurred to him on\nprevious nights, appeared very much frightened. I adjusted the\nclothing again properly on the bed and Randall la)' down. The\ncandle was again extinguished. After about ten minutes the rapping\nrecommenced. First slowly, as before. It again increased in speed\nand volume, and after about the same interval of time it again\nstopped. When the clothes were going in under the bed on the\nfirst occasion, Sinnott sat up in bed and said :\n\" Oh, God ! look at the\nclothes going in under the bed.\" He also appeared very nervous.\nThe rapping having stopped on the second occasion, Randall's voice\nagain broke the silence. \" They are going again,\" he cried ; \" the\nclothes are leaving me again.\" I said, \"Hold them and do not let\nthem go: you only imagine they are going.\" He said: \"I cannot\nhold them ;\nthey are going, and I am going with them ; there is\nsomething pushing me from inside : I am going, I am going, I'm\n\f384 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\ngone.\" My companion struck a light just in time to see Randall\nslide from the bed, the sheet under him, and the sheets, blanket\nand coverlet over him. He lay on his back on the floor. The\nmovement of his coming out of bed was gentle and regular. There\ndid not appear to be any jerking motion. Whilst he lay on the\nfloor, Randall's face was bathed in perspiration, which rolled off him\nin great drops. He was much agitated and trembled in every limb.\nHis terribly frightened condition, especially the beads of perspiration\non his face, precludes any supposition that he was privy to any\nhuman agency being employed to effect the manifestations. Sinnott\nagain sat up in bed, and appeared terrified also. Mr. Redmond,\nhearing the commotion, came into the room at this time. Randall\nsaid: \"Oh, isn't this dreadful? I can't stand it; I can't stay any\nlonger here.\" We took him from the floor and persuaded him to re-\nenter the bed again. He did so, and we adjusted the bedclothes.\nIt was now about midnight. The owner of the house returned\nto his own room, and we remained watching until about 1.45, and\nduring that time nothing further occurred. Redmond returned then\nto see how we were getting on, and took a seat by my side in\nRandall's bedroom. The three of us having sat there for about five\nminutes, the rapping again commenced, this time in a different part\nof the room. Instead of being near the foot of Randall's bed as\nheretofore, I located it about the middle of the room at a place\nabout equally distant from each bed. It went on for about fifteen\nminutes, and then ceased. It was at this time fairly bright, the\ndawn having appeared in the eastern sky. Randall was not inter-\nfered with any further that night, and we remained watching till\nclose on three o'clock, and nothing further having occurred we\nleft the house.\nOn the following night I remained in that room from eleven o'clock\ntill long past midnight. Neither Randall nor Sinnott were there,\nhaving gone home to the country for the usual week-end. I heard\nor saw nothing unusual.\nRandall could not reach that part of the floor from which the\nrapping came on any occasion without attracting my attention and\nthat of my comrade. I give up the attempt to explain away the\nstrange manifestations. I hope some member of the Society may be\nable to do so.\nNicholas J.

The following notes written\nat the time give the result of my enquiry\n:\nOn Tuesday, December 6th, 1910, I visited Enniscorthy, and\nsaw and closely questioned the eye-witnesses mentioned in Mr.\nMurphy's paper, with the exception of Sinnott and Redmond,\nwho were away. I also saw the servant who slept in a small\nroom adjoining the one in which the disturbances occurred.\nShe scouted the idea of the boys playing tricks, and added an\nimportant fact, viz. that the large iron bed in which Sinnott\nslept along with another lodger had lost one of its castors\n;\nnevertheless, it was dragged across the room with the two\nyoung men in it, leaving a mark along the floor where the\niron leg had scraped along. The bed, she told me, was so\nheavy that, even with no one in it, she had to get assistance\nwhen moving it. She was terribly scared by the disturbances,\n\f386 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nand left the place as soon as she could. I begged her to write\ndown what she had observed, and Mr. Murphy sent me her\nstatement which follows.\nI then visited the house where the disturbances took place.\nIt was empty and unfurnished, and in the hands of the painters.\nThe descriptions given by Mr. Murphy and by Randall are\nquite correct.\nI had a long interview with Randall, and he impressed me\nvery favourably ; an intelligent, straightforward youth about\neighteen years old. He undertook to write down a detailed\naccount of what had occurred during the time he lodged with\nRedmond. This he did, and his statement is annexed. Randall\nis a Protestant, and I saw the rector of his parish, who knew\nthe young man well and testified to his good character and\ntrustworthiness. His letter to me is given later on.\nI saw Mr. Devereux, the companion whom Mr. Murphy took\nwith him. He owns a cycle shop in Enniscorthy, and is a\nskilled mechanic, an excellent witness. He corroborated Mr.\nMurphy's statement, and said he went to the house feeling sure\nhe would be able to discover that one or other of the lads was\nplaying a practical joke. But he was unable to unravel the\nmystery. He said that what occurred in his presence could\nnot possibly have been done by Randall or his companion. I\nalso had an interview with the previous occupant of the house.\nNothing had occurred in his time.\nStatement of Bridget Thorpe.\nI was a servant in the house of Mr. Nicholas Redmond, 8 Court\nStreet, Enniscorthy. I remember John Randall coming to lodge\nthere. It was on a Monday night he first came. On the following\nFriday morning I heard John Randall and George Sinnott, another\nlodger, talking about the clothes being pulled off the bed. On\nFriday night I heard the bed running about the floor in Randall's\nroom. I was then in my own room. On the next morning I heard\nJohn Randall say that he would not sleep in the house any more.\nI remember going into Randall's room one night with Mr. Redmond\nas we heard noises ; and when we went in Richard Roche, another\nlodger, who was there that night, was in one bed and John Randall\nin another. The bedclothes were all pulled through the bars at the\nfoot of Roche's bed. Roche was very much frightened. I frequently\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 387\nheard rapping in Randall's room. I always thought it came from\nthe corner of Randall's room nearest to Mr. Redmond's room. On\nthe night that Mr. Murphy and Mr. Devereux were there I heard\nfootsteps walking about the lobby outside the door where they were.\nI often heard these footsteps. The night I heard the bed running\nabout the floor, the floor shook as if a very strong man was pulling\nthe bed around.\n(Signed) B. Thorpe.\nWitnessed by N. J.

This was for a short time the case,\nbut one of them had left when Mr. Murphy visited the house.\nStatement written by J. W. Randall.\nOn Saturday, the 2nd of July, 1910, I came to work in Ennis-\ncorthy as an improver in the carpentry trade. Monday, I went to\nlodge in a house in Court Street. There were two other men\nstopping in the same house as lodgers. They slept in the same\nroom also, but shared a different bed at the other side of the room.\nMy bed was in a recess in the wall at the opposite side. There was\none large window in the room, which opened both top and bottom.\nThe room was about 14 feet scpaare and 10 feet high. There was\none door opening into it. The window already described was in\nthe back Avail of the house nearly opposite the door opening into the\nroom from the top landing. There were two other doors on the\nsame landing opening into different rooms. There was also a fire-\nplace in the room.\nOn Monday night, July 4th, we went to bed, and my first night\nin the strange house I think I slept pretty soundly. We got up at\nsix o'clock the next morning and went to work. We left off work\nat six in the evening, and went to bed the same time as the night\nbefore, between 10 and 10.30 o'clock, slept soundly, and all went well,\nalso on Wednesday.\nWent to bed on Thursday night at 10.45, the three of us going\nas before. We blew out the light, but the room was then fairly\nlightsome. We had been only about ten minutes in bed when I felt\nthe clothes being gently drawn from my bed. I first thought it was\nthe others that were playing a joke, so I called out, \" Stop, George,\nit's too old.\" (George being one of their names and the other\nRichard.) Then I heard them say, \"It's Nick\" (that is the name\n\f388 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nof the man of the house). It wasn't any of them that had pulled\nthe clothes off me, so they thought it was Nick that was in the\nroom, and did not mind. At this time the clothes had gone off my\nbed completely, and I shouted to them to strike a match. When\nthey struck a match I found my bedclothes were at the window.\nThe most curious part was that the same time when the clothes\nwere leaving my bed, their bed was moving. I brought back the\nclothes and got into bed again. The light was then put out, and it\nwasn't long until we heard some hammering in the room\u2014tap-tap-tap-\nlike. This lasted for a few minutes, getting quicker and quicker.\nWhen it got very quick their bed started to move out across the\nfloor, and that made us very frightened, and what made us more\nfrightened was the door being shut, and nobody could open it without\nmaking a great noise. They then struck a match and got the lamp.\nWe searched the room thoroughly, and could find nobody. Nobody\nhad come in the door. We called the man of the house (Redmond);\nhe came into the room, saw the bed, and told us to push it back\nand get into bed (he thought all the time one of us was playing\nthe trick on the other). I said I wouldn't stay in the other bed by\nmyself, so I got in with the others ; we put out the light again,\nand it had been ordy a couple of minutes out when the bed ran out\non the floor with the three of us. Richard struck a match again,\nand this time we all got up and put on our clothes ; we had got a\nterrible fright and couldn't stick it any longer. We told the man\nof the house we would sit up in the room until daylight. During\nthe time we were sitting in the room we could hear footsteps leaving\nthe kitchen and coming up the stairs ; it would stop on the landing\noutside the door and wouldn't come into the room. The footsteps\nand noises continued through the house until daybreak. We got up\nat nine o'clock and went to work for a three-quarter day.\nThat night (Friday) when we went to bed about eleven o'clock\nwe felt a bit nervous in going. We put out the light, and in a few\nminutes the footsteps started again, and noises. There were also\nnoises like chips getting chopped in the kitchen. This night passed\nover not near so bad as the night before, but yet we were afraid to\ngo to sleep.\nSaturday we all went home for the Sunday, but returned Sunday\nevening. We went to bed Sunday night as before, and it passed\nover with very slight noises. On Monday night the noises\nstarted again after going to bed, and about a quarter of an hour\ntheir bed ran again. They then struck a light, and I got into the\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old .\nand New. 389\nbed with them. There were terrible noises everywhere ; on the\nwalls, out on the landing, and downstairs. We left the light lighted\nfor some time, and whilst it was lighted, what added more to our\nfright was a chair dancing out to the middle of the floor without a\nthing near it. We put out the light again after moving back the\nbed. Immediately the light was put out the bed ran again out\non the floor. Richard had the matches always ready to strike.\nEvery time we would hear the noise and feel the bed moving, we\nwould shout :\n\" Strike, Richard, strike ; we're going again !\n\" We\nwere trembling from head to feet with fear. We left the light\nlighted till morning after that.\nTuesday night passed over about the same, and on Wednesday\nnight there wasn't a stir. After hearing nothing on Wednesday\nnight we thought it had stopped, but still we felt nervous. On\nThursday night it started as bad as the first night, and several\npeople remarked it being so bad on the night exactly a week after\nit had started. The bed ran out several times, and what never\nhappened to any one of us before, George was lifted out of bed without\na hand near him. He went home next day, and stopped at home\nfor two clays. So while he was away, Richard and I stopped in\nthe room. The same noise still continued, and the bed ran also.\nWe went home on Saturday as on the week before.\nGeorge came back again on Sunday night, and slept in the same\nbed with us again, and it wasn't extra bad that night. It went on\nabout the same way every night until the following Friday night,\nwhen it was very bad. The bed turned up on one side, and threw\nus out on the floor, and before we were thrown out, the pillow was\ntaken from under my head three times. When the bed rose up, it\nfell back without making any noise. This bed was so heavy, it took\nboth the woman and girl to pull it out from the wall without\nanybody in it, and there was only three castors on it. After being\nthrown out of the big bed, the three of us got into my bed. We\nwere not long in it when it started to rise, but could not get out\nof the recess it was in unless it was taken to pieces. It ceased\nabout daybreak, and that finished that night's performance.\nIt kept very bad then for a few nights. So Mr. Murphy, from\nthe \"Guardian\" Office, and another man named Devereux, came\nand stopped in the room one night. They sat on two chairs in the\nroom, while we lay each in our own beds. We were not long in\nbed when I felt a terrible feeling over me like a big weight. I\nthen felt myself being taken from the bed, but could feel no hands,\n\f390 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nnor could I resist going. All I could say was :\n\" I'm going, I'm\ngoing ;\nthey're at me.\" I lay on the floor in a terrible state, and\nhardly able to speak. The perspiration was pouring through me.\nThey put me back in bed again, and nothing more than strange\nknockings and noises happened between that and morning. We\nslept again in the room the next night, but nothing serious happened.\nWe then got another lodging, and the people left it also. For the\nthree weeks I was in the house I lost nearly three-quarters of a\nstone weight. I never believed in ghosts until that, and I think it\nwould convince the bravest man in Ireland.\nJohn William Eandall.\n18 Main St., Enniscorthy.\nI heard from Eandall a few days ago (January 25th).\nNothing has occurred in his new lodgings. The curious\nassociation of a particular person in a particular place at a par-\nticular time is very characteristic of all poltergeist phenomena.\nFrom the Rev. Canon Rennison.\nKilpatrick Eectory, Wexford,\nJan. 27, 1911.\nDear Sir, \u2014I have known John Eandall for the past five years, and I\nbelieve him to be a thoroughly truthful and trustworthy boy. I\nthink you may rely on any particulars he has given you about the\n\"haunted house\" at Enniscorthy. He has always been a steady,\nwell-conducted boy, so far as I know. I am very glad to hear you\nare reading a paper on the whole affair.\nYours very truly,\nJohn Eennison.\nMy best thanks are due to Mr. N. J. Murphy, who kindly\nspared neither time nor trouble in assisting me in these\nenquiries.\nThe Derrygonnelly Case.\nI now pass on to another Irish case of which I heard soon\nafter the disturbances broke out, and was able to visit the\nspot while the poltergeist was still active, so that I was an\neye-witness of many of the occurrences. I wrote a detailed\naccount of what took place at the time, and it was published\nin the Dublin University Magazine for December, 1877, under\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 391\nthe title of \" The Demons of Derrygonnelly.\" ISTo report of\nthis case has yet appeared in our Proceedings, and I can only\nbriefly summarize it here.\nIn 1877 Mr. Thomas Plunkett, of Enniskillen, a gentleman\nwho has devoted much time to the geological and archaeological\ninvestigation of the County Fermanagh, wrote to tell me of\nsome mysterious disturbances occurring in a farmer's cottage\nnear some prehistoric limestone caves he was exploring, and\nasking me to visit the place, which I did.\nThe place was a hamlet called Derrygonnelly, about nine\nmiles from Enniskillen, and the cottage was some two miles\nfurther on. A more lonely spot could hardly be found in\nthis country. Across the bog that lay before us rose the huge\nlimestone cliff's of Knockmore, crowned by an escarpment of\noverhanging rock. The cottage itself was hidden in the hollow\nof a field, and no other house could be seen anywhere.\nThe household consisted of a grey-headed farmer who had\nrecently lost his wife, and a family of four girls and one boy,\nthe youngest about ten years of age, and the eldest, Maggie,\nround whom the disturbances arose, about twenty years old.\nThe cottage had the usual large kitchen and dwelling-room,\nwith earthen floors in the centre, and a smaller room opening\nfrom each side. In one of them Maggie and the girls slept\non a large, old-fashioned four-post bed. The noises, rappings\nand scratches generally began after they had retired, and often\ncontinued the whole night through. Eats, of course, were first\nsuspected ; but when objects began to move without any visible\ncause, stones to fall, candles and boots repeatedly thrown out of\nthe house, the rat theory was abandoned and a general terror\ntook possession of the family. Several neighbours urged them\nto send for the priest, but they were Methodists, and their class\nleader advised them to lay an open Bible on the bed. This\nthey did in the name of God, putting a big stone on the top\nof the volume ; but the stone was lifted off by an unseen hand,\nand the Bible placed on top of it. After that \" it,\" as the\nfarmer called the unseen cause, moved the Bible out of the\nroom and tore seventeen pages right across. Then they could\nnot keep a light in the house, candles and lamps were mysteri-\nously stolen, or thrown out. They asked their neighbours' help,\nand here I cp;iote the old farmer's words :\n\" Jack Flanigan came\n\f392 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nand lent us his lamp, saying he would engage the devil himself\ncould not steal it, as he had got the priest to sprinkle it with\nholy water.\" \" But that,\" the old man said, \" did us no\ngood either, for the next day it took away that lamp also.\"\nThey were forcer] to keep their candles in a neighbour's house\nsome way off, and fetch them at night, and keep them\nlighted.\nDuring the evenings I spent in the cottage, the farmer and\neach of his children were independently examined. He gave\nme a concordant account of the singular freaks of this polter-\ngeist, and their vain efforts to put a stop to it. Those who\nare interested can read the story, told by the old man, which\nI took down in writing, as it is published in full in my article\nalready referred to.\nMy own observations were as follows : After the children,\nexcept the boy, had gone to bed, Maggie lay down on the bed\nwithout undressing, so that her hands and feet could be ob-\nserved. The rest of us sat round the kitchen fire, when faint\nraps, rapidly increasing in loudness, were heard, coming appar-\nently from the walls, the ceiling and various parts of the\ninner room, the door of which was open. On entering the bed-\nroom with a light the noises at first ceased, but recommenced\nwhen I put the light on the window-sill in the kitchen. I had\nthe boy and his father by my side, and asked Mr. Plunkett\nto look round the house outside. Standing in the doorway\nleading to the bedroom the noises recommenced, the light was\ngradually brought nearer, and after much patience I was able\nto bring the light into the bedroom whilst the disturbances\nwere still loudly going on. At last I was able to go up to\nthe side of the bed, with the lighted candle in my hand, and\nclosely observed each of the occupants lying on the bed. The\nyounger children were apparently asleep, and Maggie was\nmotionless ;\nnevertheless, knocks were going on everywhere\naround ; on the chairs, the bedstead, the walls and ceiling.\nThe closest scrutiny failed to detect any movement on the part\nof those present that could account for the noises, which were\naccompanied by a scratching or tearing sound. Suddenly a\nlarge pebble fell in my presence on to the bed ; no one had\nmoved to dislodge it even if it had been placed for the purpose.\nWhen I replaced the candle on the window-sill in the kitchen,\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 393\nthe knocks became still louder, like those made by a heavy\ncarpenter's hammer driving nails into flooring.\nAt midnight we drove back to Enniskillen, and next day I\ntelegraphed to Dublin to an acute and careful observer, presi-\ndent of one of our learned societies, to come down to help me\nin the investigation. He kindly did so. It was the Eev.\nMaxwell Close, M.A., a man honoured in Dublin for his great\nlearning, remarkable critical insight and singular sobriety of\njudgment.1\nWith him a clay or two later, we again drove over\nin the evening the eleven lonely miles to the farmer's cottage.\nIn spite of the vigilance of my friends, Mr. Close, Mr. Plunkett\nand myself, we failed to detect the slightest attempt at im-\nposture by any of the family, and we were each equally\ncertain that we were not the victims of hallucination. The\nnoises were heard as before ; we searched within and without\nthe cottage, but no cause could be found.\nThe following night we made another visit with the same\nresult. When we were about to leave some two hours later,\nthe farmer was distressed that we had not \" laid the ghost,\" and\nI asked him what he thought it was. He replied :\n\" I would have thought, sir, it do be fairies, but them late\nreaders and knowledgeable men will not allow such a thing,\nso I cannot tell what it is. I only wish, sir, you would take\nit away.\"\n\" Have you asked it to answer a question by raps V I\nasked.\n\"I have, sir,\" he said, \"as some one told us to do, but\nit tells lies as often as truth, and oftener, I think. We tried\nit, and it only knocked at L.M.N, when we said the alphabet\nover.\" I asked him if it would respond to a given number of\nraps, and he said it would. This it did in my presence. Then\nI mentally asked it, no word being spoken, to knock a certain\nnumber of times and it did so. To avoid any error or delusion\non my part, I put my hands in the side pockets of my over-\ncoat and asked it to knock the number of fingers I had open.\nIt correctly did so. Then, with a different number of fingers\nopen each time, the experiment was repeated four times in\n1\nThe Rev. Maxwell Close died a few years ago ; he was one of the earliest\nmembers of the S.P.R. , an obituary notice of him by the present writer\nappeared in the Journal S.P.R. for November, 1903.\n\f394 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nsuccession, and four times I obtained absolutely the correct\nnumber of raps. The doctrine of chances shows that casual\ncoincidence is here practically out of the question, and the\ninteresting fact remains that some telepathic rapport between\nthe unseen agent and ourselves appears to exist, on this occa-\nsion at any rate.\nBefore leaving, it was uow past midnight, the farmer\nimplored us not to go without ridding him of this pertinacious\npoltergeist. So I asked my clerical friend to read a few\nwords of scripture and offer up a prayer. He did so,\nchoosing appropriate passages from our Lord's ministry to the\npossessed, and a suitable prayer. It was a weird scene, the\nchildren were in bed, but not asleep, in the inner room,\nthe farmer and Mr. Plunkett seated by the kitchen fire,\nMr. Close seated on a stool at the open bedroom door, I\nholding a lighted candle for him, and seated just within the\nbedroom. The noises were at first so great we could hardly\nhear what was read, then as the solemn words of prayer\nwere uttered they subsided, and when the Lord's Prayer\nwas joined in by all, a profound stillness fell on the whole\ncottage. The farmer rose from his knees with tears streaming\nfrom his eyes, gratefully grasped our hands, and we left for\nour long midnight drive back to Enniskillen.\nI am afraid this does not sound a very scientific account,\nbut it is a veracious one.\nSubsequent correspondence, and reports from Mr. Plunkett,\nshowed that the poltergeist had fled from that night onwards,\nuntil some curious visitors, after reading my published descrip-\ntion, had gone to the farmer's cottage, and tried to bring\nit back again. It came, they said, feebly and furtively, but\nwhether genuine or Maggie's Irish desire to please the visitors,\nI have no means of knowing. The farmer is now dead,\nand Maggie, I believe, in service, but I have lost sight of\nthem all.\nIn both the preceding cases the disturbances took place\nat night, in the next two cases they occurred in the day\nchiefly. The reason appears to be that only when the living\nradiant point, or psychic, is in a particular place, and more\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 395\nor less at rest, do the disturbances break out. The boy\nEandall was away from his lodgings all day at work ; the girl,\nMaggie, was largely engaged in farm work outside, as well as\nhousework within, and some phenomena took place in the day\ntime when she was in the house, but were less marked until\nshe went to bed. In the next case the psychic was evidently\nmore powerful, a somnambulist and clairvoyant, and the dis-\nturbances arose when she was in the house, both in the day-\ntime and at night. As in the case of dowsing, hypnosis,\nclairvoyance, telepathy and probably all psychical phenomena,\nthe effect of education, the cultivation of the reasoning powers,\nalert consciousness, in fine, cerebral activity generally, usually\ndiminish and ultimately inhibit the production of supernormal\nphenomena.\nThe Atlantic Monthly Case.\nOne of the most remarkable and carefully investigated cases\nof poltergeists is recorded in the Atlantic Monthly} a leading\nAmerican review, for August, 1868. This case is so little\nknown and so admirable that I will briefly summarize it.\nAn Irish girl, 18 years old, named Mary Carrick, went to\nlive as servant with a family in Massachusetts soon after her\narrival in America. Six weeks after she came to the family,\nthe house bells began violently ringing without any assignable\ncause. This would occur at intervals of half an hour through-\nout the day and evening. The wires were detached from all\nthe bells, but the ringing still continued. The bells were\nhung near the ceiling of the room, 11 feet high. They only\nrang when the girl was in the room or in the adjoining one,\nand were seen to ring by the family without any visible cause.\nThe ringing was not a mere stroke of one bell, but a violent\nagitation of all the bells* A careful examination made by the\nwriter of the article, Mr. Willis, showed that no mechanism\nof any kind was attached to the bells. So far the case is like\nthe well-known \" Bealings Bells \" in Suffolk, described with\ni Like other articles in the Atlantic Monthly, the name of the author, Mr.\nH. A. Willis, is not given in the text, but only in the Table of Contents. As\nthe article was published 43 years ago, it is, I fear, hopeless to obtain any\nconfirmatory evidence at the present day ; but I have written to the Editor of\nthe Atlantic Monthly with this object in view. As yet no further information\nhas been obtained.\n2C\n\f396 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.RS. [part\ngreat care by Major Moor, F.K.S., in 1834, a full account of\nwhich will be found in Dale Owen's \"Debateable Land,\" p. 239\net seq.\nBut more remarkable phenomena followed in the American\ncase. Loud and startling raps occurred on the walls, door and\nwindows of any room where the girl was at work, and followed\nthe \"irl from room to room, and could be heard in her bedroom\nat night when she was apparently fast asleep. A little later,\nchairs were upset, crockery thrown down, tables lifted and\nmoved, and various kitchen utensils hurled about the room.\nThis was during July. In August a careful daily record was\nkept. The writer of the article states that he saw the table\nat which the girl had been ironing suddenly lifted when no\none was near enough to touch it. This also happened when\na child was sitting on the table, and when the writer and\nother persons tried to hold the table down.\nOn the 6 th of August, as Mary was placing the tea tray\non a heavy stone slab, lh inches thick, and weighing 48 lbs.,\nthe stone slab suddenly flew up, struck the tray and upset the\ndishes upon it. The writer states that this happened again\nin his own presence when he was carefully watching the girl,\nwho was at the moment in the act of wringing out some\nclothes. The slab rose and fell back with such force that it\nbroke in two, no one touching it. Soon after one-half of the\nslab was pitched on the ground and the fragments thrown\nabout. Another clay a large basket filled with clothes was\nthrown to the floor, a stool having on it a pail filled with\nwater ran along the floor; a wash tub filled with clothes was taken\noff its stand and flung to the ground, and the contents thrown\nabout.\nThe girl would often start in her sleep and scream in terror,\nthe family watching the girl and hearing the violent noises.\nThe result of all this disturbance greatly alarmed and excited\nthe girl, who was ignorant and superstitious ; it brought on a\nserious attack of hysteria, and she had to be taken to an\nasylum. All the noises ceased in her absence. At the end\nof three weeks she was sufficiently recovered to return to her\nwork. None of the movements subsequently took place, but a\nmonth later she suffered from somnambulism. Many times when\nfast asleep she rose in the middle of the night, dressed herself,\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and Nevj. 397\nand went about her work downstairs in the pitch darkness,\neven studying some lessons she was doing, and returned to\nbed in an hour or two.\nShe was also clairvoyant, and one remarkable instance of\nthis is given by the writer of the article.\nThe report concludes by saying it may be justly asked why\nno scientific men were asked to investigate the phenomena\nduring the ten weeks they lasted. To this the writer replies\nthat whilst the phenomena were in full force, a statement\nof the facts was sent to a leading scientific man in America,\nwith an earnest request that he would investigate and report.\nThe request was treated with absolute contempt ;\nthey were\ntold that such things could not happen, and that it was all\ntrickery.\nThe writer of the article then tried some experiments him-\nself. He conceived that the sounds might possibly be electri-\ncally produced, and made some experiments to test this idea.\nWhen the bedstead on which the girl slept was insulated on\nglass nothing occurred, but when the insulators were removed\nthe noises returned as violently as ever. A daily journal of\nthe weather and of the disturbances was kept, expecting that the\nphenomena would be more frequent on dry clear days, but\nsome of the most remarkable disturbances occurred on very\nrainy ones. With candour the writer therefore concludes that\nthere is some difficulty in applying the electrical hypothesis.\nElectricity has to bear a good many sins on its head, but\nwe may safely exonerate it from creating the poltergeist pheno-\nmena. The insulation experiments, tried not only on the bed,\nbut also on tables and chairs, certainly inhibited the disturb-\nances, but this inhibition was more probably due to the effect\nof suggestion either on the girl or on her unseen tormentors.\nPsychic subjects are exceedingly suggestible, and this often lays\nthem open to perpetrate fraudulent imitations, especially when\nthe enquirer feels confident trickery is an adequate explanation\nof everything.\nThe Portland, Oregon, Case.\nIn the autumn of 1909 one of the leading newspapers\non the Pacific coast published details of extraordinary dis-\nturbances and movement of objects which occurred in a house\n\f398 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nin Portland, Oregon. Subsequently an article on the subject\nappeared in the Pacific monthly, and the publicity thus\ngiven to the case led to its careful investigation by Dr.\nGilbert and Mr. Thacher, two most competent investigators,\nwho were requested by the American Society for Psychical\nEesearch to make a critical and full enquiry. The results of\nthis enquiry are given in detail in the Journal of the\nAmerican S.P.B. for September and November, 1910.\nThe phenomena were associated with the presence of a boy\nnamed Elwin March, who, at the time of these occurrences,\nwas eleven years old, and lived with his grandparents, Mr.\nand Mrs. Sawyer, at 546 Marshall Street, Portland, Oregon.\nThe first disturbance took place on Oct. 28th, 1909. A\nreporter at once got hold of the story, witnessed some of the\nphenomena, and next day published a full report in the\nprincipal local newspaper. The consequent notoriety was so\nannoying to the Sawyers that they were glad to hand the\nboy, Elwin, over to Dr. Gilbert, who took him into his own\nhouse in Portland, and kept his whereabouts secret for a\nweek until the reporters again ferreted him out. Meanwhile Dr.\nGilbert had obtained a detailed statement of the first dis-\nturbances from eye-witnesses, but Dr. and Mrs. Gilbert failed\nto obtain any satisfactory evidence of supernormal phenomena,\nand, in fact, were convinced that the boy Elwin was the\nauthor of the later, if not of the whole of the occurrences.\nI will return to this presently.\nOn the other hand the other investigator, Mr. Thacher,\nwhose report, published in the Journal of the American\nS.P.B. for Nov. 1910, is one of painstaking care, after a most\nsearching investigation, says : Practically all the eye-witnesses\nwere convinced that the movements were produced by super-\nnormal agencies, and the witnesses were numerous enough and\nintelligent enough to create a presumption in favour of genuine\npoltergeist phenomena. Mr. Thacher remarks :\n\" I began to\ncollect testimony on Oct. 29 (the day after the first outbreak)\nand have watched closely all developments for a period of several\nmonths. I wrote out the story immediately after the events\nnarrated, it is in substance a diary, and reflects the mental\nattitude of the witnesses at the time, which gives it a certain\nvalue in the final analysis and conclusion.\"\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 399\nLet us now look at the evidence. A medical man, Dr.\nAinley, testified on Oct. 29th, and made a signed statement\nnext day that he was in Mr. Sawyer's house on Oct. 28th,\nand standing near the door, saw the telephone fall from its\nstand, no one being near it but the boy, Elwin, who had come\npast it and was then standing near him. Shortly afterwards\na chair near the telephone rose up and then fell on the floor.\nIt was picked up, and again it was raised and fell on\nthe floor. No one was touching it, and no one was nearer\nthan four feet (subsequently corrected to six feet) from the\nchair, and the movements occurred plainly in his, Dr. Ainley's\nsight. Another medical man, J. C. Ross, M.D., of Portland,\nalso signed a declaration that he went to the house immedi-\nately after the disturbances, found the occupants frightened\nand bewildered, chairs, tables and pictures overturned ; dishes\nlying broken on the floor, having by some unseen force been\npulled off a sideboard. He, however, did not see any move-\nments after he arrived.\nAnother witness who had been in the U.S. artillery\ndeposed that he saw two chairs rise up and tip over in the\ndining-room, whilst the boy, Elwin, was in the kitchen and\nno one within ten or twelve feet of the chairs when they rose\nand fell over. Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer made very detailed\ndepositions of the movement of various articles of furniture\nwhen no one was near them. A large glazed picture which\nhung on the wall, slid slowly down the wall to the floor\nand rested there without breaking the glass or doing any\ndamage. Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer both saw this, and Mr. Sawyer\nadded that the picture was lifted off the suspending hook,\ncame slowly down, struck the ground at one corner, and then\nrighted itself and stood leaning against the wall.\nAnother witness, Mr. Casson, said that, hearing of these dis-\nturbances, he went to the house and saw several knives and\nforks rise up an inch or two from the drain-board of the sink\nand fall over on to the floor. A small basket on the sink also\nrose up and fell over on the floor. He and Mrs. Sawyer, the only\npersons present in the room, were six or seven feet away from\nthe sink, and the boy, Elwin, was in an adjoining room. Mr.\nSawyer deposed to the plaster coming off the wall and pieces\nthrown into the room. One piece of plaster flew from the\n\f400 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.E.S. [part\nkitchen wall, hit a tailor's goose-iron which was on the table,\nwhich in its turn, though weighing over a stone, flew off the\ntable on to the floor. Another day he saw a basket with some\nonions in it come off the table, and two cans of condensed\nmilk followed it, and all fell on the floor. Then the bread can,\nwith a pail containing some meat which stood in the pantry,\nfell on the floor, and a number of plates came off the shelf,\nand fell on the floor. Elwin, though in the room, was not\nnear the things at the time this occurred. The basket that\nfell was replaced, and again thrown down ; this was done\nseveral times running. Many other disturbances are reported,\nand numerous witnesses affirmed no visible agency could have\ncaused them.\nNow let us hear the other side. Dr. Gilbert, who had taken\nthe boy to his house, found him cheating at a game, and also\nsaw him deliberately move some objects, when he thought he\nwas not observed. This was some time after the original dis-\nturbances, and when nothing had lately occurred. There can\nbe no doubt the boy did practise several tricks in December,\nwhen removed from the Sawyers' house where the disturbances\nbroke out, and Dr. Gilbert obtained a confession from him that\nhe did so. Moreover, though at first he denied having had\nanything to do with the manifestations, when they first broke\nout at the Sawyers' house, yet Dr. Gilbert says he was so con-\nvinced of the boy's having tricked them all along that after\nsevere cross-examination he obtained a qualified admission from\nthe boy that he did do some of the earlier things. Hence\nthe conclusion arrived at by Dr. Gilbert was that the whole\nphenomena were fraudulent, and no supernormal agency need\nbe assumed. On the other hand, Mr. Thacher, who made a\nmore prolonged and searching investigation, says with consider-\nable justice :\n\" Could the fact that the boy had been the centre\nof attention for several weeks, and that the interest was waning,\ntogether with the strong and constantly repeated wishes of the\nsmall group of persons about him that the movements without\ncontact should be repeated, be sufficient to induce him to '\nfake\n'\nthe phenomena, and then lie about it [the earlier ones] ? Or\nwere all the witnesses utterly unreliable, and was the immediate\nfamily all bound together in the deception ?\n\"\nNow it turns out that there were two persons who influenced\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 401\nDr. Gilbert's opinion, by attributing fraud to the boy at the\noutset; one stated that he found 38 threads fastened outside\nthe window of the dining-room, by which the lad probably moved\nthe objects. This evidence also led Dr. Hyslop, of the American\nS.P.H., at first to conclude that the whole thing was fraud.\nHowever, Mr. Thacher discovered that these adverse witnesses\nwere absolutely untrustworthy. No one saw the witness find\nthe threads, and none were to be found ; even if the threads\nhad been there, the witness could not explain how they could\nmove various objects within the room. Finally, this witness\nwas found to be a rogue, so that Dr. Hyslop eventually stated\nhis evidence was valueless. The other witness who had stated\nthat the boy himself pulled the plaster off and threw it, turns out\nto be the owner of the house and anxious to discredit the whole\nstory, as it was likely to depreciate his property; his statements\nwere merely inferences of his own, he had seen nothing to\nsupport them, and Mr. Thacher shows they are entirely dis-\nproved, inasmuch as the plaster came from parts of the wall\nand ceiling which the boy, even if present, could not possibly\nreach.\nOn the one side we have two discredited witnesses, and on the\nother over twenty credible and disinterested witnesses who testify\nto these occurrences as being due to some unseen inexplicable\nagency. Take, for instance, Mr. Jerome Holmes' statement ; he\naffirms iii writing that when in the dining-room on October 28th\nin the afternoon he saw a chair, which was standing near the\ndoor, go right up in the air as much as three feet, and then, whilst\nit was poised in the air, it turned half over to a horizontal\nposition, and then fell on the floor. No one was near the chair\nwhen it went up in the air. El win March had just gone out\nof the room and was outside the door when the chair rose up\nand fell. \" The chair was plainly in my sight, and I am sure\nthat no person in the room touched it during its movements,\"\nMr. Holmes remarks, adding that when he stated what he him-\nself clearly saw in broad daylight, people said to him, \" Well,\nyou must be crazy.\" Here as elsewhere, as regards the wit-\nnesses, it was against their interest to make up these stories.\nThat the disturbances, like other poltergeist phenomena, are\nmore or less attached to a place, is seen from the fact that\nafter Elwin and his grandparents had left Marshall Street, the\n\f402 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nphenomena did not follow them ; but it is asserted move-\nments of objects without contact occurred for a short time in\nthe neighbouring house. Two witnesses told Mr. Thacher the\nfacts, but declined to let their names be published, as they did\nnot wish \" to be mixed up in any spooky business.\" This\nevidence is, therefore, of little value.\nThere can be no doubt that this is an important case, not only,\nnor perhaps chiefly, from a psychical point of view, but from a\npsychological standpoint.\nWe find what appear to be undoubtedly genuine phenomena\npassing into fraudulent imitations by the lad around whom\ninterest chiefly centred. As a recent American writer on the\n\" Psychology of child development \" says :\n\" A child sees an\nelder writing with a pencil. When he has a chance he tries\nit. To an observer it is a case of imitation, but to the child\nit is an attempt to get a new experience with a pencil through\nthe image furnished by the adult.\"\nOther cases of trickery, and even confession to a part of\nthe phenomena observed, are recorded in our Proceedings. In\na poltergeist case occurring in 1895 at Ham, near Hungerford,\nBerks., Mr. Westlake saw the twelve-year-old child, who was the\ncentre of the disturbances, deliberately move objects. In the\ncase of Emma Davies at Wem, in Shropshire, Mr. Hughes, who\ninvestigated the case on behalf of our Society, obtained a partial\nconfession from Emma Davies.1\nThis led to a critical review\nof the case by my friend, Mr. C. C. Massey, who published a\npamphlet which showed how inconclusive such subsequent con-\nfessions are, for objects jumped off tables and out of cupboards\nwhen the girl was outside the room, and under circumstances\nquite inconsistent with trickery. Mr. Massey remarks that it\nis probable the vanity of the girl was more gratified by the\nreputation of having duped the investigators than by that of\nbeing the medium of an unknown force.\nThe question then arises, are we to reject as worthless evi-\ndence of what appear to be supernormal phenomena because\nsometimes there are cases of subsequent imitation and trickery,\nand even occasionally confession of fraud ? In cases of\n1\nFor these and several other recent cases of poltergeist phenomena, see the\nfull reports published in Vol. XII. of our Proceedings.\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 403\npoltergeist, children are usually the centre of disturbances, and\nthe superficial or prejudiced observer, knowing the love of\nmischief among children, and that in his and nearly every one's\nexperience objects don't jump about without an assignable cause,\nnaturally comes to the conclusion that any supernormal ex-\nplanation is needless and absurd. But this a priori argument,\nwhich satisfies the man in the street, completely breaks down\nwhen a critical and historical study of the whole subject is\nmade.\nIn the numerous trials for witchcraft recorded in different\ncountries the so-called witches freely confessed that they did\nquite impossible things. One of the most tragic and heart-\nbreaking series of confessions occurred in the village of Mobra,\nin Sweden, where in 1670, it is stated in the public register of\nthe Lords Commissioners who tried the case, that 71 children\nfreely confessed that they were engaged in witchery, that they\nwere carried away by the devil ; and being \" separately and in-\ndependently examined to see if their confessions did agree,\" the\nCommissioners state they \" found that all of them except some\nvery little ones, who could not tell all the circumstances, did\npractically agree in the confession of particulars.\" And the\nparticulars consisted in describing the traditional devil, how they\nwere carried through the air and down chimneys, that burning\ncandles were stuck in their hair, but they were not burnt, that\nthey were beaten with thorns, etc., etc. And all this upon\noath, and in peril of their lives. In fact, 15 children, who so\nconfessed, were thereupon burnt ; 36 children, between 9 and\n16 years old, considered less guilty, were publicly beaten once\na week for a year, and forced \"to run the gauntlet\"; 20 more,\nmere babies, were lashed with rods for three Sundays at the\nChurch door. The number of children more or less found\nguilty, we are told, was 300. In addition 70 women, all from\nthis same village, were tried; 23 freely confessed their witch-\ncraft and were burnt, the rest were imprisoned and afterwards\nexecuted.\n1\nObviously, therefore, we must not place too much reliance\nupon the confessions of children, nor of uneducated persons,\nwho believe the superstitions of their clay to be actual facts,\nand tacitly accept the opinion of their '\nbetters,' when told\n1\nSee Glanvil, Saducimus Trhunphatus, the last tract.\n\f404 Professor W.

Hart Raines, M.D., who as\nsoon as he heard of the occurrences began an investigation, and\nwhilst he did not witness the phenomena himself, he inter-\nviewed the three young men who collectively saw what\noccurred, and he personally visited the scene of the disturb-\nance. Dr. Raines states that the young men are intelligent\ntelegraph operators, and their veracity above suspicion : they\nare positive that they were not deceived nor hallucinated, and\nthey have all signed a statement certifying to the truth of the\nfacts.\nThe disturbances took place in a little railway telegraph\ntower at Dale, Georgia, on the main line of the Atlantic coast\nrailroad. The tower adjoins the railway track, and is the\nonly house of any description within a quarter of a mile.\nDuring nine months in the year the tower is closed, and is\nopened for the tourist season from January to April. The\nthree young men\u2014Bright, Davies, and Clark \u2014opened the\ntower on January 4, 1911, and were the sole occupants living\nin its two rooms, one room above the other, a trap-door closing\nthe stair leading to the upper room. The first thing that\noccurred was the sudden, inexplicable flinging open of the\ntrap-door, and the difficulty of keeping it closed. In spite of\nfastening it with stout nails and an iron bar, it would still fly\nopen ;\nmysterious footsteps were also heard on the stair, but a\ncareful search revealed no cause for the disturbances. Then\nfollowed the raising and lowering of the window sashes in the\nupper chamber, in full view of the three occupants, no one\nbeing near the window. \" To assure themselves against\ntricksters, the trap-door leading down to the floor below was\nclosed and securely fastened, and raised only when necessary\nto descend to the ground. This precaution had no effect what-\nsoever on the phenomena, and soon various articles began to\nbe levitated about the room in broad open daylight in full view\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and Neiv. 405\nof all three occupants of the tower, when there was no possible\nchance for trickery or fraud. A can of condensed milk was\nseen to lift itself into the air and pass from one end of the\ndesk to the other without the contact of a visible hand. A\nlarge dish-pan lying near the stove slowly lifted itself and\nrolled down the stairs and out of the tower and under it,\nfrom whence it had to be fished out with the aid of a long-\npole. A lantern was levitated on to the desk without having\nbeen touched, and in full view of all. On another occasion\nthis lantern made a wild rush across the room and dashed\nitself into fragments against the wall. An ordinary can-opener\nflew wildly about the room and fastened itself in the centre of\nthe ceiling. I [Dr. Raines] saw this can-opener, and can\nassure any one interested that the most expert could not\nperform a similar feat once in a hundred efforts. Frequently\nbolts and taps, such as are used in railroad construction\nwork, would be hurled into the room, breaking a hole in\nthe glass of the window scarcely large enough to enter\nthrough.\n\" On one occasion, when objects were being hurled about the\nroom so persistently that the tower was hastily abandoned by all\nthree occupants, a chair was dashed out of the upper window,\nand fell with such force that one of the rings was broken. This\nin broad daylight, with no one in the tower, and the only avenue\nof entrance or of escape guarded by the three occupants of\nthe tower. I [Dr. Raines] saw the chair, and only a terrific\nblow could have so injured it.\"\nThe young men were now in a state of panic, and one of\nthem walked seven miles to the nearest town, to resign his\nposition, and he assured Dr. Raines nothing would induce him\nagain to go through the eerie experience he had suffered. The\nlast of the strange occurrences took place a few days before Dr.\nRaines visited the tower and made a searching investigation of\nthe possibility of some outside person tricking the young men.\nThis, he says, was impossible, nor could the vibration of passing\ntrains have caused the phenomena, and any attempt to climb\nthe stair would have been instantly detected by the operators,\none of whom was always on duty. Dr. Raines is convinced that\nthere was no chance of deception, that the operators were\nperfectly truthful and were not the victims of hallucination.\n\f406 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S.

Johnson (Eesearch Officer\nof the S.P.E.) writes to me as follows :\n\" Mr. Warndorfer, whom\nI know personally, is an unusually cool-headed and competent\nobserver, and a very intelligent and open-minded man. He is\ngenuinely interested in psychical research, and would, I feel sure,\nbe prepared to give an impartial account of anything he wit-\nnessed.\" Miss Johnson adds that she believes Mr. Warndorfer\n\" is not convinced of the genuineness of this case, or of any\ntelekinetic phenomena ; what it amounts to is that he investi-\ngated this case carefully, and did not discover any fraud in it.\"\nThe principal points in the narrative are as follow : A smith\nnamed Zimmerl has a shop near Vienna (address given), where\nhe employs two apprentices. The shop is at the end of a\nlong court, in the souterrain of a large house inhabited by\ntradespeople, so that it is entered by going down a short, open\nstair. Zimmerl had had the shop some four years, but nothing\nunusual occurred until July, 1906, when a report appeared in\na Vienna paper of the mysterious disturbances that had broken\nout in this smith's shop.\nOn July 16th, 1906, Mr. Warndorfer visited the shop and\nheard from Zimmerl how tools, bits of iron, etc., had been flung\nabout the place, and both the master and one of his apprentices\nhad been hurt by one of these missiles. He had watched the\nboys, but could not detect any tricks on their part ; in fact,\nwhen they were outside the shop the missiles still flew about,\nand from an opposite direction to where they stood, and where\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 407\na solid wall intervened. The police had investigated the matter\nand could find nothing to account for the disturbances. The\ntools, etc., had to be put into boxes and moved outside, as they\nwere afraid to work otherwise. The man was much scared,\nand lost customers through this mysterious annoyance. Once\na pipe Hew from one side of the shop to the other, and then\ncame back and settled on the anvil in the middle of the room ;\nanother time the pipe was taken from Zimmerl's mouth and\nfluttered on to the lathe.\nMr. Warndorfer made several subsequent visits, and heard\nstill more remarkable accounts, and was able to witness many\nof the occurrences. On one occasion he saw more than a\ndozen objects thrown about, and was \" perfectly certain none\nof the persons present could have thrown them \" ; one was\nthrown when he happened to be alone in the shop. He never\nsaw the objects actually fly, but heard them fall ; some dropped\nclose to him, and three struck him on the head. In reply to\nenquiries from the S.P.R., Mr. Warndorfer relates five cases of\ninexplicable movements of objects, which he witnessed in day-\nlight, and of which he believes \" the chances of mal-observation\nwere very small indeed.\" One of these cases was as follows\n:\nA small glazed picture which he had seen hanging on the wall\na few minutes before came fluttering through the air to the\nmiddle of the shop, where it fell on the floor, but did not\nbreak ; in fact, it moved like a sheet of paper. At the time\nhe was standing about a yard and a half in front of the\npicture, nobody being near it, nor in that part of the shop\nthrough which it moved. He did not see it leave its place,\nbut saw it when it was about a couple of yards from where it\nalighted. Mr. Warndorfer adds that he thinks \" it would be\nvery difficult, though not impossible, to throw or drop such a\npicture without its breaking.\" Another incident witnessed by\nMr. Warndorfer occurred when the smith was out of the shop\nand the two apprentices were drilling a hole in a piece of\niron. He was watching their slow work and noticed that their\nfour hands were all engaged at their work ; of this he was \" per-\nfectly certain,\" when suddenly one of the boys screamed with\npain ; a pair of big iron compasses, which had been lying on\nthe work-bench a yard behind the boy, had flown across and hit\nthe boy sharply on the temple, causing a swelling and a little\n\f408 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nblood. Mr. Wiirndorfer saw the iron compasses ricochetting\nas it were off the boy's head and falling to the ground. He\nhimself was five times hit\u2014three times on the head, as already\nmentioned, and twice elsewhere, once rather severely, with\npieces of iron and steel that unaccountably flew across the\nroom and struck him.\nThe disturbances continued for two months, and then ceased.\nOne of the lads, round whom the disturbances seemed to\ncluster, was taken to the police court and fined, though he\ndenied all guilt, and there was no direct evidence of his having\nthrown anything. The boys were, nevertheless, dismissed, and\nthe disturbances ceased. Mr. W;irndorfer, however, does not\nconsider that this proves anything, and he is right, for if his\nobservations were correct the boys could not have been the\nculprits.\nThe foregoing poltergeist closely resembles that which occurred\nat Swanland, near Hull, in 1849, and a narrative of which\nwas written by an eye-witness, Mr. Bristow, and published by\nthe S.P.E.. Prof. Sidgwick, in 1891, interviewed a surviving\nwitness of the phenomena, who confirmed Mr. Bristow's ac-\ncount. Here three workmen in a carpenter's shop were pelted\nwith bits of wood, etc., which seemed to sail through the air\n\" as if borne on gently heaving waves,\" and no visible cause\ncould be discovered for the disturbances, which lasted about\nsix weeks. The narrative given, if accurate, shows that any\nnormal explanation of the phenomena is untenable.\nIt must be borne in mind that the evidence on behalf of\nthe phenomena we have been considering rests upon observation\nand not upon experiment. We cannot repeat the phenomena\nat will, but must rest content with the statements of credible\nwitnesses. Under such circumstances no single case, however\nwell attested, can produce conviction of the supernormal\ncharacter of the phenomena ; inasmuch as our reason renders\nus instinctively hostile to the reception of any evidence which\ncannot be readily fitted in to the structure of our existing\nknowledge. We have, therefore, to rely upon the accumulation\nof testimony from many independent observers, in cases widely\nseparated both in space and time. It is with the object of\nadding to the strength of the faggot of evidence, which exists\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New 409\non behalf of poltergeists, that this paper has been added to\nothers on this subject already published in our Proceedings.\nEvery one will admit the truth of Glanvil's remark: \"That\nwhich is sufficiently and undeniably proved ought not to be\ndenied because we know not how it can be, that is, because\nthere are difficulties in the conceiving of it\n\"\n;\nand if the array\nof testimony from credible and competent witnesses in different\ncountries and different ages concerning poltergeist phenomena\nbe set aside, all testimony to strange and sporadic occurrences,\nsuch as meteorites, fireballs, red-rain, mock-suns, etc., must also\nbe discredited. Few of us have witnessed the fall of meteoric\nstones to the earth, yet we believe in their existence in spite\nof the impossibility of their reproduction at our pleasure. The\nreason why we believe is of course the testimony of many\ntrustworthy witnesses to whom we hare given attention. In\nfact there are some phenomena in physical science which are\nas rare, elusive and inexplicable as those in psychical research.\nThat strange phenomenon, to which the name of fire-ball or\nglobe lightning has been given, is an example. \" As we have\nhitherto been unable to reproduce a fire-ball by our most\npowerful electrical machines, some philosophers have denied that\nany such thing can exist ! But as Arago says :\n1\nWhere should\nwe be if we set ourselves to deny everything we do not know\nhow to explain ?\n' The amount of trustworthy and independent\nevidence which we possess as to the occurrence of this pheno-\nmenon is such as must convince every reasonable man who chooses\nto pay due attention to the subject. No doubt there is a great\ndeal of exaggeration, as well as much imperfect and erroneous\nobservation, in almost all these records. But the existence of the\nmain feature (the fire-ball) seems to be proved beyond all doubt.\"\nThese are the words of that eminent and genuine scientific\nman, the late Professor P. G. Tait, and the words I have\nitalicized are, in my opinion, equally true of the phenomena\nof poltergeists. There has been, no doubt, much \" exaggeration\nand erroneous observation \" in connection with this subject,\nbut this can also be said of the early stages of other new and\nstriking additions to our knowledge.\nMoreover, the evidence for poltergeist phenomena is\nstrengthened when we remember the injury to themselves\nwhich the witnesses often suffered. As Grlanvil says of Mr.\n\f410 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nMompesson, \" He suffered in his name, his estate, and in all\nhis affairs, and in the general peace of his family. Unbelievers\ntook him for an impostor, others thought it was a judgment of\nGod upon him for impiety. He suffered also in loss of servants\nand the health and constant affrights of his whole household.\"\nConclusions.\nThe conclusions to which a study of the subject has led me\nmay be stated as follows\n:\n(1) That fraud and hallucination are inadequate to explain\nall the phenomena.\n(2) That the widespread belief in fairies, pixies, gnomes,\nbrownies, etc., probably rests on the varied manifestations of\npoltergeists.\n(3) That in these phenomena occurring in all countries and\ngoing back to remote periods of time we have, as Mr. Lang\nsuggests, one probable origin of Fetishism among savages, the\nbelief that an inanimate object may be tenanted by what is\nthought to be a spirit.\n(4) That the noises, sudden movements of objects, and other\nphysical phenomena appear to be associated with some unseen\nintelligence which can respond, though fitfully and imperfectly,\nto an uttered and, there is some evidence to show, to an\nunlettered request ; hence they must be in some degree related\nto our intelligence.\n(5) That the disturbances are usually, though not invariably,\nassociated with the presence of a child or young person of\neither sex, and appear to be attached to a particular place as\nwell as to a particular person ;\nsome animate as well as inani-\nmate point d'a\/ppui seems to be essential.\n(G) The phenomena are sporadic and temporary, their dura-\ntion varying from a few days to several months, disappearing\nas suddenly as they came.\n(7) They produce annoyance to those concerned, and some-\ntimes, though rarely, injury.\n(8) They can be inhibited by suggestion, acting either upon\nthe human radiant point or upon the unseen agency, or possibly\nupon both.\n(9) The close connection of poltergeist disturbances with the\n\fLXIV.] Poltergeists, Old and New. 411\nphysical phenomena of spiritualism, suggests that the latter\nwould be more effectually studied immediately after they were\nfirst noticed, and in the place where they first occurred in the\npresence of the child, or other \" medium,\" round whom they\ncentred. Further, we may expect simulation, and even con-\nfession of subsequent trickery, in the case of children, after\nthe phenomena have ceased.\nAs the universe is founded on order and follows definite\nintelligible laws, we might expect to discover some analogy\nbetween the operation of seen and unseen causes. I fear,\nhowever, it will be a long time before we shall bring\nout of \" the disorderly mystery of ignorance into the orderly\nmystery of science \" these puzzling and freakish phenomena.\nWe find, however, in meteorological disturbances, in the\nunseen physical phenomena of wind and weather, similar\npuzzling and apparently freakish occurrences. Albeit we have\nno doubt that long-continued patient observation and classifica-\ntion will ultimately reveal the complex and orderly physical\ncauses at work in our fitful weather. But the scientific use of\nthe imagination is necessary alike in meteorological and bizarre\npsychical phenomena, such as poltergeists.\nThe obvious question arises, why in the latter is a human\nradiant centre necessary ? In inorganic nature we find in the\nbehaviour of saturated solutions of salts a state of unstable\nequilibrium such that a particle of solid matter dropped into\nthe quiescent liquid will suddenly create a molecular disturbance\nwhich spreads throughout the solution, causing solid crystals to\nappear and aggregate ; a general commotion results for a short\ntime, until the whole becomes a solid mass of crystals. Here\nwe see the effect of a nucleus upon a previously quiescent state\nof things. Microscopists are familiar with similar phenomena.\nEspecially in cell growth the presence of a nucleus is essential.\nWe may term the child, or other living person in poltergeist\nphenomena, the nucleus, which is the determining factor. We\nourselves and the whole world may be but nucleated cells in a\nvaster living organism, of which we can form no conception.\nSome incomprehensible intelligence is certainly at work in the\ncongeries of cells and in the galaxy of suns and stars.\nBut evolution in animate and inanimate nature is unlikely to\n2d\n\f412 Professor W. F. Barrett, F.R.S. [part\nbe confined to the visible universe. Living creatures of\ndifferent types and varied intelligence may exist in the unseen\nas in the seen.

Si nous passons\naux \" materialisations,\" beaucoup plus extraordinaires\u2014nous\nvoyons que nos \" preuves \" ont extremement baisse comme qualite.\nSauf quelques observations jusqu'a un certain point curieuses et\ndeconcertantes sur des apparitions de \" mains \" avec D.

Ajoutons que certaines des\nobservations de Sir W. Crookes relatives a \" Katie King \" ont\npu paraitre avec raison preter a, la critique.2\nEt en dehors\nd'elles je ne vois presque rien !\nTout de meme c'est encore quelque chose evidemment ! Mais\nsi nous faisons un pas de plus dans le domaine\u2014je ne dirai\nmeme pas de l'improbable, mais humainement parlant de l'im-\npossible ; si nous passons aux \" apports \" et autres faits de ce\ngenre\u2014que trouvons-nous ? Pour le \" passage de la matiere a\ntravers la matiere \"\n\u2014peu de temoignages serieux et pas un\nseul fait veritablement concluant. Pour les \" apports \" c'est\nmoins encore. On sait que les preuves de leur realite se\nrattachent pour la plupart au nom de Stainton Moses : en\ndehors de lui je ne connais presque pas de cas tant soit peu\ndignes de retenir l'attention.\n3\nOr pour S. Moses il n'y a pas de\n1\nVoir cepetidant ce que je dis a ce sujet dans mon post scriptum.\n2\nVoir par exemple les observations de M. Podmore dans Modern Spiritualism,\nVol. II., pp. 155-157.\n3\nOn pourra s'en rendre compte en lisant le chapitre consacre aux apports\nchez Aksakow, Auimisme et Spiritisme (pp. 484-495 de l'original russe). Sur\nles six cas qu'il cite un a le Colonel Olcott pour temoin, ce qui suffit pour le\ndisqualifier entitlement ; un second est atteste par M. Robert Cooper\u2014un\nspirite tres honorable celui-la, mais comme temoin par trop \"commode\"; un\ntroisieme peut s'expliquer tres facilement en supposant une entente prealable\nentre \"une jeune dame douee de faeultes mediumniques \" qui n'est pas nominee\net Monck\u2014un professionnel amplement deinasque. Les trois autres cas sont\na la verite meilleurs ; mais la encore dans deux les temoignages sont loin\nd'etre suffisants, et certains details essentiels nous viennent de seconde main.\nReste finalement un seul cas relate par Crookes et se rapportant a une seance\navec Miss Kate Fox (Jencken). Mais cette fois il ne s'agit plus d'un veritable\n\"apport,\" mais plutot d'un transport d'objet (une sonnette) d'une chambre\n\f416 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\ndoute que la grande majorite de ses pheriomenes (les apports\ny compris) puisse s'expliquer par de la fraude de sa part\n\u2014\nnecessairement consciente pour certains cas, peut-etre incon-\nsciente pour d'autres. II est certainement invraisemblable\nqu'un homme dans sa situation se soit amuse durant des annees\na mystifier ses amis les plus proches ; mais il est infiniment\nplus improbable encore de supposer qu'il ait eu le don de faire\nvenir on ne sait d'ou, ni comment, a travers l'espace, divers\nobjets et de leur faire traverser portes et murs en leur con-\nservant leur forme premiere. Et je pense que dans ce cas nous\navons a choisir non\u2014comme on l'a dit\u2014entre \" a physical and a\nmoral miracle \"\u2014mais plutot entre \" a physical impossibility\nand a moral improbability.\" II est difficile d'hesiter entre les\ndeux.\n(2) Les incidents qui out donne naissancc a ce gru'on appellc le\n\" spiritucdisme modernc \" sont indnbitctblcment jusqu'a un\ncertain 'point suspects.\nJe veux parler des fameux \" raps \" qui se firent entendre\nen 1848 k Hydesville, puis a Eochester, en presence des soeurs\nFox, et sans lesquels il n'y aurait peut-etre pas de spiritisme\na l'heure qu'il est. II est hors de doute que des sons pareils\npeuvent etre facilement produits soit a l'aide des doigts du\npied, soit avec les muscles du genou ; il parait egalement\ncertain que les personnes qui experimenterent avec les Fox\nau tout commencement ignoraient que de pareils trues fussent\npossibles. Nous avons aussi d'autres circonstances suspectes\n:\nla non-reussite des experiences entreprises en 1851 avec deux\ndes sceurs Fox par trois professeurs de Buffalo (Flint, Lee et\ndans une autre. II est vrai que Sir W. Crookes nous dit avoir lui-meme\nferme a cle la porte de celle oil avait lieu la seance. Le cas, je l'avoue, me\nparait digne d'attention ; mais comme il est a ce point de vue a peu pres le\nseul de son espece ; comme d'autre part le recit qu'en fait Sir W. Crookes\nest evidemment distinct des notes qu'il a du prendre immediatement apres la\nseance et qu'il a pu y omettre telle on telle circonstance importante\u2014on ne\npent vraiment attacher a ce r^cit de valeur decisive. En y supposant une\ninexactitude des plus legeres on pourrait voir dans le transport de la sonnette\nun fait de \" telekinesie \" tout au plus. Neanmoins je reconnais que l'incident\ndecrit par l'illustre savant anglais est curieux ;\nquelle pitie que les \"esprits\" se\nrefusent comme regie generale a nous en donner de pareils !

Pour ce qui est du dedoublement des\nvStements ( !) le seul incident de ce genre digne d'attention que je connaisse\nse rapporte a la fameuse experience eleetrique de Crookes et de Varley avec\nMine Fay: on y vit, parait-il, qui \"l'apparition\" que parut dans l'ouverture\ndu rideau et remit un livre a Cox portait la meme robe que le medium et\nmhne ses bracelets (The Spiritualist, 1875, I., p. 151). J'ignore si la critique\nque M.

Eu\nvoici un exemple. J'ignore le noiu du spirite qui a le premier\nlance l'hypothese d'une \" main materialised \" pour expliquer les\ntransports d'objets \" sans contact.\" II paraitra a un sceptique\nassez probable que ce qui a pu donner l'impulsion premiere a\ncette hypothese-la c'est quelque aventure desagreable arrivee a\nun medium aussi maladroit qu'ingenieux. Quoiqu'il en soit il est\ntrop tard maintenant pour recriminer, et force nous est\nactuellement de traiter cette theorie avec egards. Mais que\ndire par exemple de l'hypothese du \" til etherique,\" du \" hi\nmaterialise\" emise par M. le Docteur Ochorowicz dans ses si\ninteressants articles sur ses experiences avec Stanislawa Tomczyk?\nDes centaines de milliers de spirites sont nes et morts depuis\nla date fatidique des \"Eochester knockings\" sans jamais avoir\nenvisage une telle possibility. Et jusqu'a M. Ochorowicz, le\nmedium le plus audacieux, le plus \" sans gene,\" ne se serait\njamais permis de recourir a une explication pareille. Aujourd'hui\nc'est autre chose : de vastes et de nouveaux horizons s'ouvrent\ndevant nous\u2014et aussi de nouvelles facilites de tricherie et\nde nouvelles excuses a invoquer pour les mediums fraudeurs.\nToujours cette meme deplorable coincidence entre une \" loi \"\n\u2014\nou soi-disant telle\u2014et les conditions qui facilitent la super-\ncherie.1\nA noter encore que toutes ces theories si commodes pour eux\nne sembleut pas avoir ete mises en avant en premier lieu par\nles \" esprits \" eux-memes\u2014qu'on pourrait cependant croire le\nmieux informes. Esprits et mediums preferent en laisser\nl'initiative a de simples spirites (ou \" psychistes \")\n\u2014quittes, sans\nd'importance au fait que lorsque Mme Fay est venue en Russie en 1888-89\nelle s'est obstinement refusee a les renouveler sous des pretextes eminemment\nmensongers (Rebus, 1889, p. 117); elle y a ete en outre d^masquee, et en\ngeneral sa \" mediumnite \" est des plus suspectes qui se soient jamais produites.\n1\nEn ecrivant ce qui precede je n'exprime pas d'opinion sur les experiences de\nM. Ochorowicz en elles-memes. S'il en a \u2014je Tavoue\u2014 d'irresistiblement sus-\npectes, il y en a aussi de deconcertantes et difficilement explicables {Annates des\nSciences Psychiques, 1910, No. 3-4, pp. 33-39). Je ne juge pas : je constate qu'il\ny a coincidence facheuse pour la cent et unieme fois. Et je ne puis refuser a\nM. le Docteur Ochorowicz 1'expression de mon admiration pour sa science et ses\ninfatigables travaux.\n\f420 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\ndoute, a intervenir et a donner leur sanction une fois le terrain\nsuffisamment prepare.\n(5) Lei varUU extraordinaire des conditions soi-disant exige'es\npar les phenomenes est aussi de nature a donner raison\nanx sceptiqties.\nOn nous dit par exemple que l'obscurite est une condition\nnecessaire\u2014et a ce propos on invoque la photographie et je ne\nsais quoi encore. Et cependant Home, nous raconte-t-on,\noperait presque toujours dans une lunriere suftisante pour bien\nobserver. Et cependant les \"slate-writing mediums\" americains\ndonnent leurs seances en plein jour. Et meme on vient nous\ndire aujourd'hui (MM. Feilding, Baggally et Carrington a propos\nd'Eusapia Palladino) que \" plus les precautions etaient com-\npletes, plus la lumiere etait forte, plus les phenomenes etaient\nnombreux.\" 1\n(Voila certes une affirmation bien nouvelle et\nbien inattendue.) Tantot la \" chaine des mains\" est considered\ncomme etant de toute necessite, a ce point que rien ne se\nproduit plus une fois qu'elle est rompue; tantot on sen passe\ntout-a-fait\u2014du moins en ce qui regarde le medium lui-meme.\nCertains mediums n' \" operent \" qu'isoles des assistants et bras\net jambes litis (comme les Davenport) ; d'autres ne consentent\nqu'avec les plus grandes difficultes et exceptionnellement a se\nlaisser attacher les mains a celles des controleurs (Eusapia).\nEt pour la seule facon de controler les mains il y a des\nnuances ! Sambor par exemple se laissait presque toujours\ntenir dans le sens strict du mot. Au contraire Eusapia ne\nl'admet pas ; M. le Docteur Ochorowicz nous a tres ingenieuse-\nment explique pourquoi.\n2\nEt puisque je viens de citer son nom\nje me permettrai d'ajouter qu'a mon avis les conditions dans\nlesquelles se produisent a l'heure actuelle en presence de son\nmedium Mile Tomczyk les levitations de petits objets vont\ncertainement k l'encontre de ce que les spirites ont tache de\nnous inculquer durant soixante ans. Pour les \" apports \" : non\nseulement beaucoup de mediums a effets physiques n'en pro-\nduisent pas du tout, ma-is les esprits de Home affirmaient (e'est\nCrookes qui nous raconte le fait) que la matiere ne peut passer\n1\nProceedings of the 8.P.B., Vol. XXIII., p. 323.\n-Annates des Sciences Psychiqucs, 1896, No. 2, pp. 105-107.\n\flxiv.] Les Phenomenes Physiques du Spiritisme. 421\na travers la matiere; et cependant . . . Enfin pour les materia-\nlisations: ime condition soi-disant essentielle\u2014c'est la \"transe\"\ndu medium qui doit etre en plus isole des assistants. M.\nAksakow a meme elabore a ce propos une ingenieuse theorie\nd'apres laquelle a chaque \" materialisation \" partielle ou totale\ncorrespondrait une \" dematerialisation \" aussi partielle ou presque\ntotale du corps du medium lequel pourrait par consequent\ndevenir \" invisible.\" (Voila encore une hypothese bien commode\na certain point de vue.\n1\n) Et cependant non seulement les cas\nou medium et apparition auraient ete vus simultanement ne\nsont pas apres tout si peu nombreux ; mais aux seances des\nmediums de profession americains on voit souvent apparaitre\nune, deux, trois apparitions en meme temps que le medium\n\u2014\net meme en pleine lumiere '\nLa \" transe \" non plus n'est pas\nune condition sine qua non ; le polonais Jan Guzik\u2014pour ne\nciter que lui\u2014n'est ni \" entranse,\" ni meme isole du cercle\nlorsque se produisent ses \" materialisations \"\u2014aussi tres sui\ngeneris, puisqu'avant lui nous n'avons jamais entendu parler,\nje crois, de materialisations a caractere mi-animal (!). (Des\nbandes de toile enduites d'une substance lumineuse et apposees\nsur les jambes de Guzik\u2014je parle d'apres mon experience per-\nsonnelle\u2014presentent un obstacle insurmontable a ces materialisa-\ntions-la.)\nEt une fois materialisees\u2014comnie elles se comportent differem-\nment les apparitions! Aujourd'hui tel \"esprit\" parle qui\nsoutenait auparavant qu'un esprit materialise ne pent parler.\n2\nOu bien, alors que certains ne tarissent pas en babillages \" de\nomni re scibili et quibusdam aliis,\" un autre affirme qu'une\nfois revetu temporairement d'une enveloppe corporelle un\nhabitant de l'autre monde n'en sait pas plus que les assis-\ntants,3\netc., etc.\nEt voyez les apports. Alors que pour produire le plus\nsimple mouvement d'objet sans contact le medium doit l'avoir\ni C'est, comme on sait, la soi-disant disparition des jambes de Mine d'Espe-\nrance a une seance a Helsingfors qui apousse' M. Aksakow a formuler sa theorie\n(v. Un cas de demat&rialisation partielle du corps d'un medium). M. Carrington a\nfait bonne justice de cet incident dans un interessant article des Proceedings of\nthe American S.P.R., Vol. I. pp. 131-168.\n- Proceedings of the S.P.B., Vol. IV., p. 61.\n3\nPareille affirmation a ete faite en ma presence a une seance de Mme\nCorner (Florence Cook).\n\f422 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\ntout pres de soi et que l'experience rate infailliblement s'il\nen est autrement\u2014voila que d'autres objets voyagent sans\nencombres, a travers les airs sur des distances souvent tre.s\nconsiderables (comme de Portsmouth a Londres).\n1\nLes \" lois\n\"\nles plus essentielles des phenomenes sont ainsi renversees de\nfond en comble, mais les spirites ne sen montrent pas autre-\nment preoccupes. lis repondront sans doute que les \"apports\"\nappartiennent a un tout autre ordre de faits que les uiouve-\nments sans contact (comme si c'etait la une explication !)\n\u2014\net voila tout.\nL'impression qui se degage de tout cela c'est que ces soi-\ndisant lois ne sont que le fruit de la fantaisie des mediums\n\u2014\nquand ce n'est pas de leur ingeniosite. Une seule\u2014ou a pen\npres\u2014ne varie presque jamais : les conditions de I'investigation ne\nsont 'pas telles que I'dbservateur les cUsire, mais telles que le\nmedium les vent.\n(6) A supposer les pltinomenes authentiqu.es ce n'est phis d'tme\nseide force physique inconnue les produisant qu'il s'agirait\nmais de plusieurs.\nEn eftet, comme le dit M, Podniore,\" quelque sage que soit\nl'adage \" entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem \" il\nserait vraiment par crop parcimonieux le critique qui s'obsti-\nnerait a mettre sur le compte d'une seule et unique force\nphysique des faits aussi differents que : les levitations d'objets,\n(tables) avec contact ; les transports d'objets sans contact\n;\nles levitations et \"elongations\" du corps humain (Home);\nle passage de la matiere a travers la matiere (noeuds de\nZollner, etc.); les apports; les coups frappes ; les sons musicaux\net parfums (Stainton Moses); l'incombustibilite (Home); les\nmaterialisations.\nII est clair que si tous ces faits sont authentiques, ce n'est\npas par une \" force \" unique, mais bien par plusieurs, qu'ils\ndoivent etre produits. Eien d'inqDrobable dans la supposition\nque non seulement une, mais de multiples forces inconnues\npeuvent operer dans la nature : qui oserait le nier apres\ntoutes les decouvertes de ces dernieres annees ?

Les multiples apports\nde Stainton Moses et d'autres mediums n'offraient et n'offrent\nnon plus rien d'extra-terrestre. Dans certains cas\u2014comme\npour Anna Eothe et Bailey\u2014on a meme pu decouvrir la bou-\ntique de fleurs ou d'oiseaux ou ces braves mediums s'etaient\napprovisionnes en vue de la seance\n!\nEt ainsi de suite.

Pour passer a un cas qui m'est per-\nsonnel : avec Sanibor des chaises s'enfilent sur ses bras alors\nque ses mains ne sont que tenues (quoique, ma foi, tres bien\ntenues !).

Ils ont fait table rase des multiples temoignages\naccumules en faveur de l'ecriture directe sur ardoises ;\nils ont\nreproduit ou explique les photographies spirites, les trues des\nseances de materialisation (par exemple la materialisation gra-\nduelle de \" l'esprit \" devant les assistants) ; les \" raps \" (du moins\ncertains \"raps\"); les phenomenes lumineux (du moins certains\nphenomenes lumineux) ; les procedes a l'aide desquels les\nmediums parvenaient a se debarrasser des liens dont on les\nchargeait ; a sortir des sacs dans lesquels on les enfermait\u2014ou\na produire leurs phenomenes malgre ces liens et ces sacs,\netc., etc.\nJe ne connais rien de plus instructif sous ce rapport que\nla lecture des ouvrages speciaux consacres a nous narrer les\ntrues en usage chez les mediums (americains surtout).\n1\nL'in-\ngeniosite des i^rocedes qui y sont decrits tient quelquefois du\nprodige ! Et on se dit en parcourant cette suite interminable\nlumiere a n'importe quel moment d'une seance. Pour ce qui est de la pleine\nlumiere il est admissible a priori (quoique bien i'acheux !) qu'elle puisse veritable-\nment nuire aux phenomenes; quant aux \"obstacles materiels,\" comme nous ne\nrepoussons pas a priori l'hypothese d'une \" materialisation \" de membres humains,\nil est comprehensible que ces membres ne puisseut pas agir a travers une cloison\nmetallique, ou le couvercle et les parois d'une boite hermetiquement fermee. Un\neclairage subit de la chambre ou la seance a lieu pourrait a mon avis etre preju-\ndiciable au medium. On le voit, je fais encore la part assez belle aux \"esptits,\"\nquelque sceptique que je sois a leur egard. En revanche je comprendrais\nl'attitude d'un investigateur refusant d'experimenter avec un medium dont les\nmains seraient aussi mal tenues que celles d'Eusapia.\n1\nJe recommande en particulier l'ouvrage de Carrington, The Physical Pheno-\nmena of Spiritualism, fraudulent and genuine.\n-\n\f420 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [\"part\nde recits ou l'investigateur, quelqu'alerte et intelligent qu'il\nsoit, donne invariablement dans le panneau malgre les precau-\ntions les plus minutieuses.

Oui, le\ntemoignage de celui qui n'a pas fait du sujet une etude\nspeciale (qui n'a pas en particulier etudie la prestidigitation)\nne pent forcement valoir grand'ehose !

A plus\nforte raison comment peut-on invoquer le temoignage du premier\nvenu 1\ndans une question aussi compliquee que celle de savoir\nsi tel ou tel phenomene apparemment incomprehensible peut\nou ne peut pas etre du a un \" true \" ? II est clair que par-\neille question releve des specialistes.\nDu reste j'aurai encore l'occasion de toucher a ce sujet.\nEevenons a ce qu'ont reussi a faire nos prestidigitateurs et\nconstatons que sur certains chapitres ils ont non seulement\negale mais surpasse les mediums. Les vases remplis d'eau et\nde poissons rouges ; les lapins et oiseaux vivants que nous\nvoyons surgir grace a leur baguette magique, venant on ne sait\nd'ou, devant nos yeux emerveilles dans des dalles brillamment\neclairees\u2014valent bien les apports de Bailey, d'Anna liothe ou\nmenie de Stainton Moses. II faut bien croire d'ailleurs, que les\nadeptes de la magie blanche ont, somme toute, assez bien\nreussi dans leur imitation des phenomenes mediumniques,\npuisqu'il s'est trouve des spirites\u2014et non des moindres\u2014pour\naffirmer que certains d'entr'eux n'etaient que des mediums\nhonteux. (O'est ce quAlfred Eussel Wallace notamment a fait\npour plusieurs et en particulier pour Davey.1\n)\n1\nlit meme si ce temoin n'est pas le premier venu, mais s'est illustre dans un tout\nautre domaine, la question ne me semble pas se poser tres differemment. Je rap-\npellerai a ce propos que certains savants dont le temoignage en faveur des\nphenomenes mediumniques a et(5 souvent cite comme ayant beaucoup de poids ont\nreconnu ne rien comprendre a la prestidigitation (ainsi MM. Scheibner et Weber ;\nSeyhert Commission's Report, pp. 108-110).\nJournal of the S.P.B., mars 1891. On me fera observer peut-etre que meme\ns'ils ont reproduit beaucoup de phenomenes les prestidigitateurs n'ont pas reussi a\nles reproduire tous ; ensuite que certains prestidigitateurs, Davey par exemple,\n\fLXIV,] Les Phenornenes Physiques du Spiritisme. 427\nNous somraes loin de meconnaitre l'importance du fait que\ncertains prestidigitateurs appeles a donner leur avis sur l'au-\ntbenticite de quelques phenornenes se sont prononces nettement\npour l'affirruative (par exemple Bellachini et Kybka a propos\nde Slade et d'Eusapia ; MM. Carrington et Baggally qui\nout experiments avec cette derniere a Naples en meme temps\nque M. Eeilding sont egalement des experts en la matiere)\n;\nmais leurs verdicts sont contre-balances par ceux d'autres\nspecialistes d'un caractere tout oppose. II est fort naturel\ndu reste qu'un Bellachini puisse tout comme un autre etre\npris au depourvu par un true qu'il ne connait pas ; aurait-il\npersevere dans son attitude premiere s'il avait continue ses\nrecherches ? That is the question.\nPuisque nous parlons en ce moment de prestidigitation, rappelons\nque les spirites insistent souvent sur le grand desavantage\ndans lequel le medium serait place vis-a-vis du faiseur de\ntours de passe-passe, celui-ci operant sur une estrade, avec ses\npropres instruments et appareils, souvent entoure d'acolytes\n;\ncelui-la venant au contraire seul dans une maison etrangere,\nsans rien apporter avec soi ; en proie a la suspicion ;\nbref,\na en croire certains \" croyants,\" toutes les facilites seraient\nl'apanage du prestidigitateur et la situation du medium serait\ndes moins commodes.\nVoyons s'il en est vraiment ainsi. Tout d'abord\n:\n(a) Beaucoup de prestidigitateurs\u2014ou presque tous\u2014viennent\ndonner des seances en ville. lis ne se font quelquefois\naccompagner de personne ; ils empruntent tres souvent aux\nassistants certains objets dont ils ont besoin, comme des\nmontres, des mouchoirs de poche, des pieces de monnaie, etc.\n(h) Beaucoup de mediums\u2014surtout en Amerique et en\nAngleterre\u2014donnent des seances chez eux et se servent de\nleurs propres appareils (ardoises, etc.). Rien ne leur manque\nalors : tables et portes truquees, comperes caches au bon\nendroit et ainsi de suite ad infinitum.\nEnsuite il faut se rappeler que le medium n'est nullement\netaient doues de facultes d'adresse et d'ingeniosite exceptionnelles, et qu'on ne peat\navec vraisemblance attribuer au premier venu ; enfin qu'il est theoriquement\npossible que deux phenornenes apparemment identiques puissent etre dus a deux\ncauses absolument differentes. Je suis pret k conceder ces quelques points, mais\nsauf pour le premier je ne leur vois pas une tres grande importance.\n2E\n\f42S Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.

Et tout en admettant volontiers que dans\nnombre de cas ce dernier peut se trouver dans une situation\ndes plus desagreables, je crois somme toute que les pretendus\navantages qu'a sur lui le prestidigitateur sont exageres.\nLes risques h courir seraient evidemment iucomparablement\nplus serieux pour le medium si, une fois demasque, il etait\ndefinitivement \" coule \" ; mais on sait bien que cela n'arrive\njamais.

Les mediums americains\nviennent naturellement en premiere ligne. Et la serie est loin\nd'etre close\n!\nCe cote de la question est trop connu du reste pour que\nj'y insiste ; mais puisque les spirites mettent souvent en avant\nl'argument qu'on peut tres bien etre medium et frauder par\nci\u2014par la quand ineme, soit dans un etat d'inconscience, soit\npour suppleer a un epuisement temporaire de la \" force\n\"\ninediumnique, je ferai observer que bien souvent\u2014le plus souvent\n\u2014quand on demasque un medium on constate la premeditation\n;\nque d'autres fois on se trouve en presence d'une veritable or-\nganisation sysUmatiqne ayant pour but la fraude sur une vaste\nechelle. Ce serait, assure-t-on, le cas pour la grande majorite,\ntout au moins, des mediums de profession americains\u2014sans en ex-\ncepter les \" trance-mediums \"\n\u2014lesquels constitueraient ni plus ni\nmoins qu'une vaste association embrassant presque tout le pays\n;\nassociation dont les membres se communiqueraient mutuellement\ntous les renseignements pouvant mieux faire marcher le com-\nmerce et se soutiendraient les uns les autres dans le louable\nbut de mieux berner leurs clients. Pour ceux-la pas de doute\nque les excuses ordinaires des spirites ne tiennent pas debout.\nUn autre de leurs arguments consiste a dire que de ce que\ntel phenomene ait ete simule il ne s'en suit pas qu'il n'y en ait\npas d'authentiques ; et pour un pen on irait jusqu'a jouer sur\nles mots et a pretendre qu'on ne peut imiter que ce qui existe\n;\nsi done on imite un phenomene quelconque e'est que celui-ci\ndoit forcemeut exister par lui-meme ! (Je crois avoir vu\nquelque part ce raisonnement ') A ceci je repliquerai : si en\netudiant une categorie de \" faits \" ou soi-disant tels, nous\nconstatons (a) que pas un de ces \" faits \" ne peut etre\u2014n'a ete\n\u2014rigoureusement prouve ;\n(b) que parmi ces \" faits \" beaucoup\nsont indubitablement d'origine frauduleuse ; et (c) qu'ils peuvent\netre reproduits artificiellement ;\nsi, dis-je, nous constatons tout\ncela, que serons-nous en droit de conclure ? Simplement ceci : que\nla categorie de \"faits\" en question n'existe probablement pas I\n1\n1\nJe posai un jour a un spirite tres honorablement connu, aujourd'hui decide,\nla question : quelle peut bien gtre a l'egard des phenomenes frauduleux l'attitude\ndes \" esprits \" eux-memes? II me fut repondu : \"Une longue experience m'a\nappris que ces esprits sont de simples canailles.\" Un \" psychiste \" des plus\nillustres auquel je faisais part il y a peu de temps de cette opinion s'empressa\nde s'y rallier entieremeut.\n\f430 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\n(11) Les mediums pay6s sont loin d'etre les seuls a frauder.\nLorsque, en 1882, fut organisee la Societe anglaise des Re-\ncherches Psychiques ses fondateurs attachaient grande importance\na la possibility d'observer des phenomenes physiques en presence\nnon de mediums payes mais de simples particuliers. Leur\nattente fut en tres grande partie deciie. Mais la ou elle ne Fa\npas ete je crois que les savants anglais ont pu se convaincre\nque leur point de depart etait faux et que, en excluant\u2014ou\na peu pres\n1\n\u2014les mediums payes, ils ne faisaient nullement\ndisparaitre le seul stimulant qui pousse a la fraude. On ne\ntrompe pas que par interet pecuniaire ; nous n'en sommes\npas encore la, Dieu merci ! Le role de porte-parole de\nl'Au-dela ; d'intermediaire entre deux mondes qu'un gouffre\nsans fond separe ; de canal par ou, venant de la plus enig-\nmatique des sources, s'ecoule la mysterieuse force psychique\n\u2014\nest assez tentant pour pouvoir pousser bien sou vent tout seul\nk donner le coup de pouce. A part cela, n'oublions pas que\nla table autour laquelle ont vient faire la \" chaine \" est un\npuissant element niveleur. Tel personnage eminent qui dans\nla vie de tons les jours laisserait a peine franchir au medium\nle seuil de son antichambre est tout heureux de l'avoir assis\na ses cotes k une seance de spiritisme et pour un peu serait\npret a faire toutes ses fantaisies. De son cote le medium, s'il\nest suffisamment intelligent pour ne pas se contenter de simples\nsatisfactions d'amour propre\u2014satisfactions de contre-bande plus\nou moins\u2014saura faire fructifier ailleurs ces bonnes dispositions\net en recueillir les resultats sous une forme plus tangible. Bref\nil y a pour un medium bien d'autres manieres a tirer profit\ndu spiritisme qu'en passant a la caisse au bout de chaque\nseance. Rappelons nous Home qui ne se faisait jamais payer lui.\nEnsuite il existe plus de gens qu'on ne croit communement\nqui trouvent tres amusant de mystifier leurs semblables sans\nraison apparente. Voila encore l'origine possible de plus d'une\nmediumnite surprenante (voir plus loin). A noter que quand\nnotre farceur en aura assez (on se lasse de tout !) rien ne\nl'empeche (telle Katie King annongant qu'elle va quitter Florence\nCook) de declarer qu'il a perdu sa mediumnite\u2014et voila\n!\n1\nTout en mettant en avant ce principe, ils ne s'y sont pas toujours conformes\n(tt^moins Eglinton, Eusapia, Mine Piper).\n\flxiv.] Les Phenomenes Physiques du Spiritisme. 431\nPour ce qui est des conditions de controle l'observateur est\ncertainement moins bien partage (sauf des cas rarissimes) avec\nun medium prive qu'avec un professionnel. Quand on a affaire\na ce dernier on tient generalement (sentiment bien naturel !) a\nen avoir pour son argent. Au contraire le premier vous fait\nune faveur en vous admettant ; et cette faveur\u2014comment la\nreconnaitre sinon en ne se montrant pas trop exigeant, ni\ncomme controle, ni comme phenomenes ?\nLa confiance ne se commande pas. Tel individu en inspire\nune sans bornes a A, qui ne dit rien qui vaille a B. De ce que\ntel cercle spirite ait une confiance entiere en la personne du\nmedium, un des leurs, otfrant toutes sortes de garanties comme\nsituation, comme relations personnelles, comme desinteresse-\nment\u2014il ne s'en suit nullement qui cet individu soit reellement\nau-dessus du soupcon. Du reste, a, mon humble avis, tout\nhomme, quelqu'il soit, affichant des pretentions extraordinaires\net en elles-memes invraisemblables doit etre presume' capable de\ntromper jusqu'a ce qu'il ait apporU une preiwe pe'remptoire de\nla v6riU de ses allegations.\nEnhn je crois qu'aucun de ceux ayant etudie les faits d'altera-\ntion de la personnalite, de double conscience, etc., ne niera la\npossibility de la fraude inconsciente. De ce que mediums\ntricheurs et spirites fanatiques aient use et abuse de cette\nexcuse pour couvrir la fourberie la plus manifeste, il ne faut\npas conclure qu'il ne puisse y avoir la une part de verite.\nMais s'il en est vraiment ainsi\u2014le degre de confiance qu'on\npeut avoir dans tel ou tel personnage a Vitat de veille n'a plus\nrien a voir a la question.\nPour finir je me permettrai de demander : sont-ils apres tout\nsi nombreux les cas ou des phenomenes tels que les apports ou\nla materialisation aient ete constates en presence de personnes\nhonorablement connues et jouissant de l'estime et de la con-\nsideration generales ?\n(12) Si des phenomenes et de ceux qui les produisent nous\npassons a ceux qui les observent\u2014nous serons tout\nd'abord amenes a, constater qu'un tres grand nombre de\nUmoignages s y rapportant est dinui de toute valeur.\nPourquoi ? Parce que ces temoignages emanent tres souvent\nd'individus dont la credulite sans bornes, la cecite a tout indice\n\f432 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nde fraude, le manque de sens critique, le fanatisme, ont fait un\ntort irreparable au spiritisme et meme aux recherches psyehiques\nen general, Dieu sait pourquoi censees en etre solidares ! Kare-\nment, je crois, le proverbe, \" Mon Dieu, preservez moi de mes\namis,\" a trouve meilleure application. La crdduliU des spirites!\nQue d'exemples ridicules, burlesques, quelquefois presque re-\npugnants, ces quatre mots suffisent a evoquer dans notre memoire\na tons, nous autres \" psychistes \" !\nOui, il faut se le dire : dans ce domaine etrange il est\ncertains temoins\u2014honnetes ou du moins se croyant tels\u2014dont\nles declarations les plus categoriques n'ont absolument aucune\nvaleur. Quoiqu'ils affirment, le critique doit passer outre a\ntoutes leurs assertions.\nJe viens d'ecrire les mots \" honnetes ou se croyant tels.\"\nCela ne les empeche pas de travestir la v^rite a chaque pas\n\u2014\nconsciemment ou semi-consciemment. Un desir intense que\nceci ou cela soit ne nous pousse-t-il pas a fermer les yeux avec\nobstination\u2014avec violence, pourrais-je dire\u2014sur tout ce qui est\ncontraire a notre \" marotte \"\n\u2014pour parler vulgairement ? Des\nlors, au 'point de vuc pratique la question de savoir si certains\nde ces temoins sont de bonne foi perd son interet.\nUs sont convaincus fermement que les phenomenes existent\n;\nc'est entendu. Aussi ne veulent-ils plus rien connaitre de tout\nce qui ne parle pas en faveur de cette authenticity. Us\npasseront outre a tous les indices de supercherie de la part\ndu medium. II n'en sera pas question dans les comptes-rendus\nqu'ils feront de ses phenomenes ; au contraire, tout ce qui lui\nsemblera favorable sera exagdre\" et souligne. Un scandale\neclatera-t-il ? le medium sera-t-il pris la main dans le sac ?\nlis commenceront par reserver leur indignation pour celui qui\nl'aura demasque ;\n1\nils accepteront ensuite de sa part les excuses\nles plus boiteuses : enfin il y a beacoup a parier qu'ils feront tout\npour etouffer l'affaire, pour ne pas l'ebruiter.\nAllons plus loin. Supposons que des spirites dans cet ordre\n(ou plutot ce desordre !) d'idees ont livre a la publicite la\ndescription de phenomenes etonnants qu'ils auraient observes.\n1\nJe me rappelle avoir lu il y a bien des amines dans la Revue Spirite comme\nquoi quelques sceptiques qui avaient saisi \" I'apparition \" a line stance de\nmaterialisation americaine avaient ete roues de coups \"non seulement par\nles amis visibles et presents,\" mais aussi soi-disant par les invisibles.\n\flxiv.] Les Phenomenes Physiques du Spiritisme. 433\nSupposons qu'il leur aura ete demontre par A + B qu*ils ont ete\ngrossierement mis dedans. Supposons que, par extraordinaire,\nils se seront laisses convaincre. Mais comme (1) on n'aime pas\ngeneralement a reconnaitre son erreur ; (2) comme il est entendu\nque les phenomenes existent tout de meme en ge'ne'ral (de ce\nque telle maison vende des vins frelates il ne faut pas conclure,\nn'est-ce pas, qu'il n'y ait que cela dans le commerce, etc.)\u2014il\nest assez vraisemblable, je crois, que les spirites en question ne\nrectifieront pas et prefereront garder de Conrart le silence\nprudent.\nJe crois qu'on pourrait aller plus loin encore. Supposons\nun de ces spirites \" ultra \" k une seance ou le medium est\nentoure de sceptiques plus ou moins mal disposes. Les esprits\nrefusent obstinement de se manifester. Le medium est enerve\n;\nl'assistanee gouailleuse. Notre spirite sait pertinemment que les\npihe'nomdnes existent : ne les a-t-il pas observes cent fois ? Alors\npouvons-nous etre absolument surs que cette fois-la\u2014la cent\net unieme\u2014s'il en a l'occasion, il ne fraudera pas lui-meme ad\nmajorem spirit uum gloriam ?\nLa tentation pour lui doit etre en tous cas terriblement\nforte.\n1\nEn dehors de ces fanatiques extremes il existe encore\nd autres categories de spirites au sujet desquels un doute l\u00a3ger\npeut (sans calembour) se presenter a l'esprit. II en est soit\nqui se sont fait du spiritisme une situation ou un gagne-pain\n;\n1\nTout r^cemment encore on m'affirmait chose pareille d'un spirite de St\nPetersbourg occupant une haute situation. Apres tout je ne dis pas que pareil\nfait s'est necessairement produit ;\nje dis que theoriquemeut il peut tres bien se\nproduire. Je ne parle ici et plus haut que des spirites fanatiques. Mais j'ai\nete\" frappe des privautes que prennent quelquefois avec la verite d'autres\nspirites\u2014ponderes, prudents, non exempts de quelque scepticisme. Toutd'abord,\nque de scandales 6touffes ! Humainement cela est tres comprehensible ; mais\nle tableau general est des lors forcement incomplet. Le silence garde sur des\nexperiences negatives (et au cours desquelles le medium a convaincu de\nfraude) venant a la suite d'autres, positives celles-la et proclamees \" urbi et\norbi,\" me semble aussi devoir etre evite. Enfin que dire d'une description\nd'une serie d'experiences faite sur un ton ou on ne voit guere percer de doute\n\u2014\nalors que l'experimentateur est au moment mime persuade qu !\nun des resultats\nobtenus est du a la fraude ? La publication\u2014dans une revue ou un ouvrage\nspecial\u2014de recits emanant de personnages dont le temoignage vaut tres peu aux\nyeux de celui qui les publie me parait egalement peu desirable. On pourrait\nsans doute multiplier ces exemples ;\nje ne cite que ceux que j'ai presents a la\nmemoire et qui me sont personnellement connus.\n\f434 Gomte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.

II fut constate in-\ndubitablement que X laissait le medium\u2014ou soi-disant tel\u2014agir\na sa guise. Une petite lampe electrique soudainemeut allumee\nau beau milieu de la seance, d'un cote, les confidences du soi-\ndisant medium de l'autre, nous revelerent que X lachait la\nmain du medium quand ce dernier lui en manifestait dis-\ncretement l'euvie. II la lachait meme si bien que leurs deux\nmains avaient quelque peine a se retrouver ensuite ! A part\ncela il n'y a pas de doute pour moi que X a triche aussi\npour ainsi dire directement.2\nII est certain que la preuve positive qu'il ait egalement\nfraude ou laisse frauder aux seances anterieures (deux avec\nSambor en mai 1902 ;\nseances avec la sceur de Sambor,\nMme W. ; avec le Dr. Sch., un medium prive ; avec Luba\nMorozow de Vladikavkaz ; enfin avec Jan Guzik 3\nimmediate-\nment avant la seance decisive) fait defaut ; et il est douteux\nque nous l'obtenions jamais. En tous cas la forme sous\nlaquelle X refuta mes soupcons en 1904 lui rendrait, a mon\n1\nA une seance de .Sambor (13 mai, 1902) il y en eut aussi \" d'apportes \" de\nla chambre d'a cote\u2014oil nous nous rendions durant les entr'actes.\n2\nEn particulier, lors de \" l'apport \" de la monnaie grecque\u2014pendant une sus-\npension de seance\u2014le medium (Luba Morozow) ne se trouvait meme pas dans\nla chambre. En revanche X y etait lui. II y a aussi d'autres observations da\nmeme genre se rapportant a X\u2014notaminent a la seance oil on le demasqua.\n3 II y fut pourtant constate que Guzik avait a un certain moment une\nmain libre, X etant un de ceux qui le contrulaient.\n\f436 Gomte Perovsky -Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\navis, assez difficile im aveu. Eh bien, soit : j'admets qu'il y\na doute (quant a, la fraude) pour ces seances. Mais comme\n(Us notre premiere tentative s&rieuse de tirer la question au clair,\nnos soupcons quant au rdle jou6 par X rccevaient une confir-\nmation 6clatante\u2014comment attacher une valeur quelconque a\ntoutes les experiences anterieures ou il lui etait possible de\ntricher ?\nEt notez que ce personnage extraordinaire est loin d'etre le\npremier venu. C'est un homme cultive, intelligent, d'un com-\nmerce tres agreable, dessinateur et ecrivain a ses heures\n;\noccupant une situation officielle elevee (avec cela rien du\n\" bureaucrate \" dans le mauvais sens du mot). II jouit meme\na certain point de vue d'une tres honorable notoriete en Iiussie\net ailleurs ; et j'ajouterai qu'il a toujours fait profession de\ns'interesser serieusement et sans fanatisme au spiritisme.\nNotez aussi qu'il ne s'est jamais fait passer pour medium. II\nse sera fait pmt-etre ce raisonnement qu'il finirait par etre\nsoupronne s'il n'operait qua des seances sans medium reconnu ;\ntandis qu'il n'avait aucunement a se gener avec Sambor ou\nJan Guzik, tout ce qui se passerait pouvant etre mis sur le\ncompte de leur mediumnite. & eux. Ce raisonnement\u2014a supposer\nqu'il ait vraiment ete fait\u2014e'tait tres juste en principe ; il est\nfacheux pour X qu'il ne l'ait tout de meme pas empeche de\nse faire pincer.\nQuelles raisons pouvait-il bien avoir ? Apparemment rien\nque le desir anormal\u2014presque morbide\u2014de duper les autres,\nde rire sous cape a leurs depens ;\npeut-etre\u2014quelquefois\n\u2014\nd'epater un novice. II ne pouvait certes rien y gagner ni au\npoint de vue pecuniaire, ni a celui de la notoriete, puisque le\nbenefice de tous les phenomenes revenait au medium !\nCet exemple me parait hautement instructif!\nJ'ajouterai que les personnes qui prenaient part a nos seances\netaient invitees en partie par moi, en partie par un ami k\nmoi, qui est un des chercheurs les plus consciencieux et les plus\npatients que je connaisse. Notre \" cercle \" semblait done offrir\n\u2014et offrait en effet\u2014de serieuses garanties. Et pourtant ! . . .\nNous avons, il est vrai, fini par voir clair la-dedans, mais\nd'autres auraient pu etre moins perspicaces ; et je crois que\nnous-memes aurions bien pu ne nous apercevoir de rien, si X,\nau lieu de nous accabler d' \" apports,\" setait contente d'un peu\n\flxiv.] Les Phenomenes Physiques du Spiritisme. 437\nde telekinesie par ci, d'une petite materialisation par la, et avait\npris la precaution de faire \" rater \" plus souvent les seances\nauxquelles il assistait le medium !\nQue ses emules futurs en prennent bonne note !\nOn le voit : que de sources d'erreurs ! Et comment les\ndemeler sans une etude approfondie ? Certains fanatiques se\ndesignent, il est vrai, eux-niemes ; mais il y en a d'autres, plus\ndangereux, parce que plus intelligents. Les reconnaitre n'est pas\ntoujours chose facile. Et pour les autres categories la tache n'est\npas plus aisee. A parler strictement pour appre'cier a sa juste\nvaleur ion compte-rendu de phe'nomines me'dnomniques il faudrait\navant tout personnellement connaitre tous les temoins : alors seule-\nment on peut avoir la quasi-certitude qu'il ne peut s'agir la\nni de trues a la X, ni d'elucubrations de fanatiques ; et que le\ncompte-rendu en question ne contient pas a cote d'inexactitudes\ninvolontaires des reticences voulues ou des exagerations inspirees\npar le desir de servir la bonne cause.\n(13) En dehors des cas sortant plus ou moins du commun\nque je viens de citer (car quelque nombreux que scient les spirites\nultra-credules, ils ne le sont pas tous ;\nquelque plaisir que\ncertains farceurs puissent trouver a mystifier leurs semblables,\nleur nombre doit etre force'ment limite) il existe d'autres et de\ntres serieuses raisons pour recuser dans le domaine du spiritisme\net des recherches psychiques bien des temoignages. Et tout\nd'abord :\n(13) Pour bien observer dans ce domaine il faut des aptitudes\nsptcialcs et, rigoureusement parlant, un entrainement specicd.\nCar l'etude de ce que Ton est convenu d'appeler les phenomenes\npsychiques (ou metapsychiques) est une science, quelque soit le\npoint de vue auquel on se place. Elle a sa litterature, ses pro-\ncedes et methodes d'investigation, sa philosophie, quelquefois\nses appareils. Elle demande\u2014tout au moins elle devrait\ndemander\u2014des notions en d'autres sciences encore : en psycho-\nlogie, en physiologie, en physique, en chimie. Enfin elle comporte\ncertainement\u2014et peut-etre avant tout le reste\u2014des connaissances\ndans un autre domaine qui, par une ironie du sort, a de mul-\ntiples points de contact avec la \" Psychical Eesearch \" : la presti-\ndigitation. (J'ai deja touche plus haut a ce cote de la\nquestion.)\n\f438 Comte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nInutile d'ajouter qu'un petit nombre seulement des investi-\ngateurs des phenornenes mediumniques peut satisfaire a de\ntelles exigences. Et pourtant je n'ai pas encore nomme la\ncondition qui est d'apres moi de beaucoup la plus importante\n;\nsi importante au fait quelle suffit a elle seule, k mon avis, a\nremplacer bien d'autres.\nNotre dbservateur doit avant tout bien observer ! Or c'est la\nune faculte innee, encore qu'elle puisse etre developpee.\nII doit non seulement bien observer, mais bien decrire ce\nqu'il aura constate ; bien retenir dans sa memoire les details\nnon seulement essentiels mais ceux-la meme qui lui semblent\nsuperficiels ; il ne doit pas trop se laisser impressionner par\n1'apparemment merveilleux ou inexplicable ; il ne doit jamais\necrire une ligne qu'il n'ait inurement pesee ;\nentin il doit etre\ndoue d'une impartiality a toute epreuve et faire le meme accueil\nau \" pour \" et au \" contre.\"\nBara avis. Oui, certes !\nEt ces qualites si importantes ne se trouvent necessairement\nreunies ni chez l'homme de science, fut-il le plus illustre parmi\nles illustres\n;\n1\nni chez l'homme de lettres ou l'artiste\u2014fut-il\nune celebrite mondiale ; ni chez l'homme simplement cultive et\nintelligent ; ni meme chez l'homme d'affaires, pratique et de\nbon sens par excellence. Eien ne nous garantit qu'une fois\nassis a la table spiritique ils ne se laissent berner comme\ntant d'autres. (J'en connais ')\nPour ce qui est en particulier des homines de science, il\nest permis peut-etre de douter que les etudes faites dans le\ncalme serein des laboratoires, dans une ambiance qui n'a rien\nde commun avec celle des seances spirites, aux antipodes de\n1\nLa science la plus indubitable est loin d'exclure toujours la credulite\n\u2014\nquelquefois une credulite' a faire palir d'envie le spirite le plus \"ultra.\" Dans\nle domaine du spiritisme je citerai feu le Professeur Wagner de St Petersbourg\nqui, lors de ses \"experiences\" avec le medium Nikolaeff mettait de la mous-\nseline duns le ''cabinet\" afjn de faciliter aux esprits la materialisation des\nvoiles dont devait se revetir la \"forme\" materialisee ; sur l'ordre que lui en\ndonnait \"l'esprit\" il tournait aussi le dos au cabinet (ainsi que les autres\nassistants) au moment d'allumer le magnesium pour photographier la\n\"forme.\" (V. mon \"Supplement\" a ma traduction russe du Modern\nSpiritualism de M.

Dame ! ne fut-ce que, parce qu'en vertu de l'adage\n\" Quod licet Jovi non licet bovi \" il est a presumer qu'il ne\nse permettra pas de petites libertes dont ne se sont pas fait\nfaute d'user certains savants parmi les plus eminents ; il ne se\ncontentera pas d'une simple enumeration des \" phenomenes,\"\nmais nous decrira les conditions dans lesquelles il les aura\nconstates ; et au lieu d'affinner sans autres details que toutes\nles precautions etaient prises contre la supercherie, il con-\ndescendra a nous les decrire exactement.\nEt si jamais des critiques serieux attaquent ses experiences\net ses conclusions, notre observateur croira sans cloute de son\ndevoir de leur repondre d'une facon circonstanciee, au lieu de\nse draper dans un dedaigneux silence ou de ne laisser tomber\nde sa plume que trois ou quatre phrases qui ne refutent rien.\nMais\u2014je ne veux pas qu'on m'accuse de rechercher le\nparadoxe ; et puis\u2014je respecte trop les savants. Mettons que\nje n'ai rien dit\n!\nAinsi aucun titre, aucune etiquette attaches aux noms des\nexperimentateurs ne peuvent nous garantir d'une fac^on certaine\nla valeur veritable de leurs investigations, ni nous premunir\ncontre des erreurs\u2014peut-etre meme grossieres\u2014de leur part.\nMeme la qualite de prestidigitateur n'est pas une garantie\ninfaillible ; la preuve c'est que certains d'entr'eux ont change\nd'avis sur les phenomenes dont ils avaient ete les t^moins.\nHarry Kellar, par exemple, qui a Calcutta, en 1882, avait\ndeclare ne pouvoir expliquer l'ecriture sur ardoises d'Eglinton,\nrevint ensuite sur ses affirmations et emerveillait quelques\nannees plus tard les membres de la commission Seybert de\nrilniversite de Pennsylvanie en leur montrant du \" slate-\nwriting \" bien superieur k celui de Slade.\n1\n1\nAnnaks des Sc.

Les conditions inclividuelles\nd'une experience mediumnique joueront toujours un role capital ;\nen revanche, comme je i'ai deja dit, il importe avant tout\nd'etre fixe sur la personnalite des experimentateurs ; c'est par\nla qu'il faudrait commencer.\nN'exagerons done pas outre mesure l'importance\u2014reellement\ngrande\u2014de 1'oeuvre de Hodgson et de Davey ; surtout ne nous\nen servons pas trop sou vent comme d'une fin de non-recevoir\n;\nmais admettons cependant qu'ils out demontre la faillibilite\nfrequente de l'observation humaine en general pour certaines\ncategories de faits mediumniques.\nVoiJa done encore une circonstance h envisager tres serieuse-\nment.\nUne conclusion s'impose. Voici celle a laquelle provisoire-\nment je m'arrete :\nJe crois que l'ensemble des objections que j'ai indiquees,\ntoutes convergeant au meme point, pese d'un poids assez lourd\npour inspirer des doutes legitimes quant a la securite de la\nbarque qui transporte vers des destinees inconnues le medium a\neffets physiques et sa fortune. II nous faut jeter du lest ! II\nnous faut en d'autres termes conceder aux sceptiques que \/\"\nr6alit4 de certains phinomen.es physiques, loin, d'etre prouvte, ne\nrepose sur aucun fondement serieux. C'est d'apres moi le cas\ndes \" apports,\" du passage de la matiere a travers la matiere\n;\ntres probablement aussi de la materialisation de formes humaines,\nde la photographie spirite ; sans doute aussi de l'ecriture directe.\nEn revanche je considere toujours comme importantes et\nprobantes certaines observations sur les mouvements de tables\nsans contact (experiences du Comte de Gasparin ; du professeur\nThury ; d'un des sous-comites de la Societe Dialectique de\nLondres) ; celles de M. le Docteur Dariex sur le renversement\n\f442 Gomte Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nspontane des chaises de son cabinet de travail\n;\n1\npeut-etre\naussi certaines experiences sur les Invitations de tables avec\nEusapia.'2\nJe range entre les deux categories quelques phenomenes de\nD. D. Home (d'autres-\u2014en tres petit nombre\u2014rentreront plutot\ndans la seconde). II y en a qui paraissent decidement bien\nenigmatiques (surtout certains cas d' \" incombustibility \" partagee\nparfois par d'autres personnes que lui-meme ; aussi quelques\ncas de Invitation et\u2014a un degre moindre\u2014de transports\nd'objets et meme peut-Stre d'apparitions de \" mains \"). Par rap-\nport k ceux-la je prefere rester pour le moment sur l'expectative.\nJe tiens tout de meme a faire remarquer que certains cotes\nnegatifs des temoignages se rapportant aux phenomenes medium-\nniques sont particulierement intensifies clans le cas de Home.\nException faite pour Crookes, peut-etre pour Lord Adare et un\npetit nombre d'autres noms, nous n'avons que tres peu de r\u00a3cits\nemanant de temoins pouvant faire autorite. La clientele de\nHome etait, il est vrai, des plus \" choisies \" mondainement\nparlant ; mais quelque peu democrate que je sois dans l'ame, je\nsuis loin de considerer un nom sonore et un titre aristocratique\ncomme offrant dans le cas present quelque garantie. N'en\ndeplaise k la brillante compagnie dans laquelle ne cessait\nd'evoluer le mysterieux ecossais, je pencherais presque pour\nla supposition contraire. Les relations de Home avec sa\ntres distinguee clientele etaient k n'en pas douter telles que tres\nsouvent\u2014le plus souvent peut-etre\u2014non seulement il n'avait a\napprehender aucune surprise desagreable, mais pouvait imposer\ntelles conditions qu'il voulait\u2014meme se mouvoir en liberte dans\nla chambre. Et de ce qu'il lui est arrive de dire k Sir W.\nCrookes \" au commencement de leur connaissance \" : \"William,\naujourd'hui je veux que vous vous comportiez envers moi\ncomme si j'etais un prestidigitateur reconnu\" 3\n\u2014il est permis de\nconclure justement que la plupart du temps on ne le con-\nsiderait pas comme tel\u2014c'est-a-dire, qu'on le laissait agir plus\ncm moins a sa guise.

A-t-il toutefois\nperdu par la une occasion unique et qui ne se presentera peut-\netre jamais ? C'est somme toute improbable. Si les pMnomhies\nphysiques clu spiritisme existent, un autre Home finira par svrgir;\net s'il n'en surgit pas, il faudra bien conclure que lui aussi\nn'etait qu'un simple prestidigitateur.\n1\nSuspendons done\u2014-quant a lui\u2014notre jugement.\nAh certes, un nouveau Home, s'il se presentait a l'heure\nactuelle, n'aurait pas a se plaindre d'etre neglige par la science\nonicielle.

Cela est certain en tous\ncas pour les experiences dont nous possedons des comptes-\nrendus stenographiques : celles de 1908 a Naples et celles\nentreprises sous les auspices de l'lnstitut Psychologique de\nParis. Pour les experiences anterieures pareille chose a\npu Gtre accidentellement affirmed.\n1\nMais\u2014ainsi que j'ai eu\nl'occasion de le montrer ailleurs\n2\n\u2014les conditions des seances\nd'Eusapia sont eminemment propres a engendrer dans l'esprit\ndes assistants des erreurs de memoire quant aux circonstances\nexactes de tel ou tel incident. On ne peut done attacher\ngrande importance a des affirmations isolees de ce genre (a\nsupposer qu'il s'en rencontre beaucoup, ce dont je doute fort).\nMon impression actuelle\u2014e'est que lorsque les assistants voient\nla main \" materialised \" une des mains d'Eusapia au moins est\ntoujours recouverte par le rideau (sur la table).

The truth of such extension of faculty must be\nexamined, for, so far as I know, there is nothing to negative it,\nbut it has certainly not been definitely proved. Moreover,\namong the asserted occurrences of a supernormal nature there\nare some which cannot reasonably be explained by any such\nhypothesis, however it be stretched\u2014not at least if the supposed\nextended faculty is to be of the same general nature as those\nwith which we are familiar within the limits of the body\nitself.\n\f448 Sir Oliver Lodge. [paet\nThe movements and other phenomena that have to be\nexplained frecpuently exhibit intelligence\u2014an intelligence some-\ntimes beyond, or, at any rate, differing from, that of any person\npresent\u2014even though it is not of a high, and may occasionally\nbe of a mischievous, kind.\nNow, in the domain of intelligent phenomena, pure and\nsimple, automatic writing may be considered pre-eminent ; and\nthe evidence which is accumulating under this head is undoubtedly\ntending in the direction of substantiating the claim\u2014a claim\nmade by the writings themselves\u2014that they are partly clue to\nselection and control exercised by the surviving portion of\nindividuals who not loner ago lived on the earth.\nLet us take this as a working hypothesis, for a moment,\nand trace its results. There is not the slightest necessity, and\nas far as I know there is no extensive claim, for attributing\nmerely physical phenomena to the direct agency of departed\nhuman beings. There is no reason to suppose that their\npowers of acting on matter have been enlarged or revolu-\ntionised : rather it would appear probable that such mechanical\npowers as were possessed in the body have now ceased. The\nidea that physical phenomena are directly due to deceased\npersons has led, and will probably always lead, to cheap and\neasy retort and ridicule.\nThat, however, is no argument. In certain cases there does\nappear to be a connexion, though it may be indirect. Some\nof the simpler physical phenomena, such as raps, seem designed\nto call attention and add emphasis to what is being otherwise\ncommunicated ;\nthough the source of the messages is still an\nopen question. If it should turn out that great psychic\nactivity or emotion on the other side occasionally results in\nphysical as well as in mental phenomena, as a kind of overflow\nof energy \u2014 perhaps unconscious and unintended, like stam-\nmering \u2014 I should not be altogether surprised. And if once\nthe possibility of any such physical action, however trivial, is\nadmitted, a door is opened which will not readily be closed.\nBut that is not the lesson which I wish now to draw from\nthe hypothetical existence and activity of departed human\nbeings. The moral that I would draw is more like this\n:\nIf intelligences akin to humanity are in any way at work,\nin an order of being beyond our present senses and outside\n\flxiv.] A priori Argument against Physical Phenomena. 449\nour present scope, is it likely that they are the only beings\nthat thus exist ?\nIt is certainly far from the case here and now.\nA reader of terrestrial history, living on another planet,\nmight readily conceive the idea that the earth was inhabited\nsolely by human beings, though he would observe that\nreference was occasionally made to creatures such as horses\nand cattle as useful for labour or for food ; but how little\ncould he appreciate of the facts known to a Zoologist\n\u2014\nhow far he would be from imagining the extraordinary wealth\nof terrestrial life, some of it of the most curious and fantastic\nkind, among which we live. He could imagine less even than\nthe ordinary uninstructed person knows of the myriads of\ncreation. Our experience here certainly leads us to assume\nthat, where there is life at all, there is likely to be an immense\nvariety and complexity of life ; so if the evidence ever con-\nstrains us to extend human existence, or an existence akin to\nhuman, into what is popularly spoken of as \" another world,\"\nthen we ought to make the generalisation, based on our\nexperience here, that not humanity alone but many other\norders of being, some higher, some lower, may exist and\ninteract in those unknown surroundings.\nIs such a hypothesis legitimate ? It is premature as yet\nto make it, but I foresee a time when we shall be driven to\nsomething like it ;\nand, if there is any truth in it, a multitude\nof phenomena which now appear weird and strange, or frankly\nimpossible, will receive what then may seem their simple and\nnatural explanation. The lawless and the capricious can only\nbe so to our present understanding, and only appear so\nbecause we have abstracted and mentally partitioned off a\ncertain small region of the Universe and decided to treat it\nfor scientific purposes as if it were the whole.\nThat is exactly what we do in a laboratory : we exclude\ndisturbing influences as much as possible ; and those which\nwe cannot exclude we first reduce to a minimum, and then\neither take into account by calculation or else ignore as being\ndemonstrably insignificant in amount. That is our customary\nprocess ;\nand, of course, we sometimes make mistakes. The\nhistory of science is full of instances where the ignored is\nfound ultimately to be of importance. \"Whereupon unexplained\n\f450 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ndiscrepancies, or what had been called discordances between\ntheory and fact, become in the light of fuller knowledge\nresolved and explained.\nA trace of radioactivity, before radioactivity was allowed for\n;\nthe impact of stray electric waves, before such things were\nexpected ; the pressure of light in interplanetary space or a\nvacuum bulb, before the time of Clerk Maxwell or Crookes ;\nthe complication of a spider's web in a balance case which had\nbeen supposed closed to alien influence ;\n\u2014all these, no less than\nthe proverbial bull in a china shop, have before now produced\nstrange happenings which seemed inexplicable until the per-\nturbing cause itself became known.\nAnd it would not be unnatural, though it could hardly be\nsaid to be wise, for the head of the laboratory, to whom such\nevents were reported, to profess disbelief in them; on the\nground that it was more likely for observers to be careless or\nfor testimony to err than for such outrageous eccentricities\nin the order of nature to be real.\nBut it may be said that if ever for a moment we allow\nourselves to contemplate the possible existence and activity of\nanother order of being, we are making a wild speculation and\nopening the door to a region so unknown as to be useless and\nconfusing. Yes, and that is one good reason why we do not\nopen the door ;\nor, at least, are not willing to open it very\nwide.\nProgress in science is made by proceeding slowly and gradually\nfrom the known to the unknown\u2014not by postulating any\nmysterious agency that can be imagined and letting it work\nits hypothetical will. That was done in old times truly, when,\nfor instance, an angel was supposed to control the movement\nof each planet and guide it on its course ; it is also done\nsometimes by illiterate persons who attribute particular actions\nto the Deity\u2014not indirectly and ultimately, in the way that\nall religious people assume, but directly and immediately as\nif He were a clumsy artificer poking a finger into the works.\nBut those were not the ages of science, nor is satisfaction\nwith vague unknown possibilities the atmosphere of science.\nIn science all the entrances to unknown causes must be\njealously guarded, and new agencies must be only let in one\nat a time as they are really needed.\n\flxiv.] A priori Argument against Physical Phenomena. 451\nIn recent times several new agencies have been admitted\n\u2014\nnew elements, new vibrations, new forces,\u2014all outside our\nunaided senses, and, therefore, all unknown fifty years ago.\nBut in what sense were they new ? Manifestly only in a\nsubjective sense. Throughout the world's history they have\nexisted and done their work. Argon and helium and radium,\nelectrons and X-rays and electric waves, have really been\nactive all the time ; and phagocytes have been attacking the\nmicrobes of disease, and bacilli have been contributing to the\nfertility of the soil, and bacteria have been slaying their\nthousands, all through human history ;\njust as certainly as\nthat the heart was pumping and the blood circulating in the\nheroes of antiquity, however little the owners of the blood-\nvessels were aware of the fact.\nBut all these things, it will be said, are in the line of\nhuman knowledge, they fit in with what was previously\nknown, they were surmised and then verified by human intel-\nligence,\u2014their recognition is not like opening the door to the\nunlicensed activity of a group of creatures of whose nature\nand properties we know absolutely nothing.\nWell, let us look at that contention for a little while.\nSocrates spoke of his Daemon, Joan of Arc of her Voices,\nSaints have told of their direct inspiration, Poets have\nassured us that their best work comes from outside them-\nselves ; \u2014so we must admit, without trenching on the ground\nof religion, that activities of a kind higher than human have\nbeen testified to on a basis of direct experience.\nBut this is very different from the physical phenomena\nwhich at present are under discussion. Most true, and the\ntestimony for these things is of a less high and notable order,\n\u2014but it exists nevertheless, and I desire to urge that the\nkind of things asserted are not beyond the capacity of a\ngroup of imaginary beings which science for its own sake has\nimagined the possibility of, and whose powers it has delimited\nand defined.\nThe power of human beings as we know them, so far as\nit relates to the world of matter, is limited to moving masses\nof matter of visible and tangible size. No other thing can\nman do in the material region. He acts on it by his\nmuscles, and by his muscles alone. All else is done by the\n\f452 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\nproperties of matter itself. Man can put a seed into the\nground and cover it with soil and water,\u2014the resulting plant\nis not his achievement. Man can build a machine of glass and\nbrass, and by turning a handle can evoke an electric spark,\n\u2014\nbut the spark is not man's production. Whatever can result\nfrom the movement and arrangement of matter is indirectly\nthe result of man's activity, and beyond that he can achieve\nnothing.\nBut if he had the power of dealing with individual mole-\ncules, instead of with masses of matter,\u2014if he could see and\ntrace and handle and control the motions of the atoms them-\nselves,\u2014or if a being existed with senses and powers analogous\nto our own, and like ours perfectly finite and limited,\u2014only\ndifferent in the sense of being so acute and rapid that things\nmoving with the speed of bullets and things invisible in the\nhighest-power microscope became tangible and tractable,\u2014then\nother things could be done which to us with our present senses\nand muscles would seem impossible, and which certainly would\nin the strict sense be super-, or it might be infra-, human. It is\nwell known that Clerk Maxwell imagined such an order of\nbeings for the purpose of showing how the second law of\nthermodynamics might be evaded ; and Lord Kelvin\u2014to whom\nfew things could be more distasteful than being quoted in\nsupport of my present contention, and to his shade I apologise\n\u2014went a step further and enunciated a whole category of\nthings which \" Maxwell's demons \" could achieve, subject to all\nthe perfectly defined physical laws and processes with which\nwe are already acquainted.\nMyers enters into some detail concerning the relation of\nthis conception to many asserted physical phenomena. Nothing\nmore is necessary than a power of dealing with molecules as\nwe deal with masses of matter ; no law of motion\u2014as we call\nit\u2014need be upset, the conservation of energy would hold un-\ndisputed sway, gravitation and all the other forces would be as\npotent as ever; and yet what would seem miraculous to un-\ninitiated human beings would be capable of achievement.\nThe idea is worked out, with just the right attitude of\nhumour and semi-sarcasm appropriate to the novelty of the\nidea and to the apparent fancifulness of its basis, in F. W. H.\nMyers' Human Personality, Vol. II. pp. 530-534.\n\fLXiv.j A priori Argument against Physical Phenomena. 453\nI remember when he was writing that part of his book,\nand the talks we had on it. I remember his asking me what\nsort of reality could by any conceivability be attributed to\nMaxwell's demons, and what sort of acts they could accomplish\nif they in any kind of sense existed. I referred him to Lord\nKelvin's brilliant lecture on the subject, of which an abstract\nappears in Proc. Hoy. hist. Vol. IX., Feb. 1879,\u2014under the\ntitle \" The Sorting Demon of Maxwell,\"\u2014and likewise in his\n\"Popular Addresses,\" Vol. I.; and I was interested in the\nsingular felicity of the use which Myers made of the idea.\nDo I, then, seriously contend that we must postulate such\ncreatures in order to account for asserted physical and chemical\nphenomena of a novel kind ? I do not. But I do maintain\nthat the existence of such power has been imagined by physicists\nthemselves, for the purposes of ordinary physics,\u2014especially\nperhaps, for the region where physics interlocks with biology,\n\u2014\nnot at all with the object of aiding our special investigations\n;\nwith entire ignorance perhaps\u2014indeed with active dislike in\none case\u2014of the subjects which are dealt with by our Society.\nHence I hold that if testimony as to facts of this order\never becomes strong enough to demand ideas of this kind for\ntheir elucidation, there will be nothing outrageous or hyper-\nfanciful in the conception, nor anything illegitimate in such a\nhypothesis, when it is forced upon us. We shall not make it\nunless driven to it by facts, and facts have not yet driven us\nto it ; but if and when they do, I for one shall take the line\nnot of denying the facts as grotesquely impossible and mani-\nfestly absurd\u2014however much one is sometimes tempted to say\nthis now\u2014but I shall hope to examine them to see whether,\nby some such extension of human or other power as Maxwell\nand Kelvin have conceived, we may not be led a step on into\nour understanding of a larger Nature. We may perhaps thus\nfind that the physical phenomena and the intellectual phenomena\nare more closely allied than we had imagined ; that they are\nallied there, indeed, somewhat as they are allied here ; and that\none class is a reasonable, or at any rate a real, supplement to\nthe other.\nOne set of facts may be of the heroic order, and another\nset of the trivial, the domestic, the casual order,\u2014and no\nman is a hero to his valet ; but whether we attend to the\n\f454 Sir Oliver Lodge. [part\ncommonplace actions of a great man or not, such actions are\nundoubtedly performed. To suppose that great poetry, for\ninstance, ever came into the world without any concomitant of\nordinary and what we call \" low \" humanity, is to suppose a\nmonstrosity. And those who are even now opening the door\nto a demonstration of intelligence from beyond the veil may\nfind\u2014will find as I believe\u2014that they are admitting, along\nwith the intelligence, a mass of supplementary concomitant\nactivity, which will have to be reckoned with, classified, and\nunderstood. And I venture to risk the prediction that the\ntestimony to this physical material activity, low though it\nmay be, and however much it be kept in its proper subordi-\nnate place, and however critical the attitude which may\nrightly have to be taken with respect to it, can with wisdom\nbe neither ignored nor denied.\nI write this article not as a protest but as a counter-\nbalancing presentation,\u2014erring, perhaps, on the positive or\nspeculative side as much as some may think Count Solovovo's\narticle lags on the negative or sceptical side. I gather that\nhis desire, and that of the more stringently critical of the\ninvestigators and recorders of the Society\u2014indeed the desire\nof us all\u2014is to improve the evidence and gradually make it\nirrefragable. And I further gather that they consider it\npossible to achieve this ; in the first place, by stimulating\nexperimenters to greater care and exactitude of observation\n;\nand in the second place, by actually bringing pressure to bear\non whatever intelligence may be supposed responsible for these\nobscure phenomena, so that the conditions under which they\noccur may by practice and effort be gradually improved.\n\fLXIV.] Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis. 455\nV.\nA CASE OF EMERGENCE OF A LATENT MEMORY\nUNDER HYPNOSIS.\nBy G. LOWES DICKINSON.\nThis paper deals with a series of sittings for hypnotic\nexperiments held during April, May, and June, 1906.1\nThe person hypnotised was a young lady whom I shall\ncall Miss C. She is not a professional medium, but the\ndaughter of a clergyman, with a good general education ;\nnot a student, but interested in psychical and theosophical\nquestions, and conversant with literature bearing on such\nsubjects. The doctor who hypnotised her, and whom I\nshall call Dr. G., considers her perfectly normal, free\nfrom any symptoms of hysteria or other nervous disease.\nTo an ordinary observer, like myself, she appears a simple,\nstraightforward character, with a strong sense of humour. It\nseems worth while to insist upon these points because the\ncase would lose all interest for psychical research if the\nhypothesis of fraud were entertained. It is, of course, im-\npossible to disprove fraud. I can only say that those who\nwere present at the sittings regard that hypothesis as the least\nprobable that can be put forward. Besides the lady herself\nand Dr. G., there were present at the sittings her brother, Mr.\nC, and Mr. Woolley, a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, who\ntook notes. I was present myself at several, but not at all the\nsittings. This paper is based on the notes taken at the time.\nThese notes, however, not being taken in shorthand, though\n1\nMr. Dickinson's account of this case was read at a meeting of the Society\nheld in July, 1906, and would have been published sooner but that the MS.\nwas accidentally mislaid by one of the experimenters, and has only recently\nbeen found again.\n\u2014\nEd.\n\f456 G. Loives Dickinson. [part\nthey are accurate, are necessarily brief, and do not give an\nadequate impression of the vivid and dramatic character of\nthe proceedings. These assumed a dialogue form, Dr. G. con-\nversing with the hypnotised subject and drawing her out, but\ntaking care not to suggest trains of ideas himself. A con-\nsiderable number of sittings were held, and the general pro-\ncedure was as follows :\n\u2014\nThe lady, whom I shall call for convenience the subject,\nas soon as she was hypnotised described herself as passing out\nof her body. She would sometimes, according to her account,\npause just outside it both in starting and in returning, and\nwould then say that she saw her body, was standing upon it,\netc. But this only for a moment, so that we never got her\nsatisfactorily to describe the room or things in it while she\npurported to be in this posture. She almost immediately\n\" went up,\" as she described it. And \" up \" meant a very\nremarkable and complicated world, her account of which was\nquite coherent and consistent throughout the sittings. It con-\nsisted of a number of different \" planes,\" one, as she said,\nabove another, in which are stored up not only everything\nthat ever has happened or will happen, but all thoughts,\ndreams, and imaginations. To begin with, she usually went\nstraight to what she called the \" blue.\" It was, she said,\nfrom and in this plane that she derived the \" force \" to move\nand observe in these upper regions. Her account was that\nshe \" got blue \" from Dr. G-. originally, and his \" blue \" was\napparently necessary for her support throughout. But also she\nderived force from this blue plane, and when she was tired\ncould always refresh and restore herself by returning to it and\nsinking into it. She did not commonly \" see things \" in the\nblue ; she had to go for that into other planes. But the\n\"blue\" had the peculiar property that she could tell, when\nshe was in it, whether what she had seen elsewhere was real\nor no. She also got from this plane her metaphysical ideas.\nAbove the blue was the \" white,\" a dazzling plane into which\nshe could not penetrate. Other planes to which she referred\nwere the \" thought plane, \" \" mind plane,\" \" dream plane,\"\n\" plane of feelings.\" There was also the plane where there\nwere real people, with which we shall here be mainly con-\ncerned ; and a plane in which she found her past lives.\n\flxtv.] Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis. 457\nWhile, however, this complicated world was always described\nin terms of planes and of colours, the subject insisted that\nthese were only metaphors. There was really, she said, no\ntime and no space where she went. All the planes were\nreally somehow one. And she had great difficulty in convey-\ning through language the experiences she received. \" There\nare no words up here,\" she said, \" and so when you try to\nbring it back you give it any words that come into your head\non waking.\" And again, \" everywhere is really the same plane,\nand when I'm up here I'm in my body too.\" Again, \" on\ndifferent planes you get different answers to the same question.\nThey're all parts of the truth.\" Again, \" everything is all\nthought really. Things aren't really coloured. They only make\none feel like it.\" \" Other people may see the same things and\ndescribe them differently ; the things added to what you are\nyourself make what you see.\" Again, \" I can't tell where\nthings are. Just the same if they are close or far away.\nCan't get used to it.\"\nIn this curious world there were many obstacles to the\ndiscovery of objective truth. Thus, if the subject thought of\nanything, she immediately saw it. \" If I want to see anything,\nit is there at once, just as real as if I hadn't made it, so I\nmustn't want to see things.\" Again, she will sometimes get\ninto some one else's dream. Thus on one occasion she gave\nus a picture of a landscape, and told us afterwards, after\nreturning to the \" blue,\" that some one was dreaming it,\n\" some one up there called Monica.\" Monica, she said, was\n\" wrapped up in her own plane, and doesn't want to meet any\none,\" so we were unable to pursue that branch of the subject.\nOn another occasion she saw \" grey-blue mist, moving snakes\nin it, not really snakes. Look like snakes. Arms coming\nthrough the mist. Oh nothing really. I got into a dream.\"\nWe were naturally more interested in what purported to be\nreal things and real persons. In the earlier sittings the\nsubject was much disturbed by a lady she met up there who,\nshe said, oughtn't to be there at all, didn't know her way\nabout, and was always worrying her for advice, which she\ndidn't take. This lady she called at first Malka, but finally\ninformed us that her real name was Eose Weston, that she\nlived near Merthyr Tydvil, and that she was in a trance.\n\f458 G. Lowes Dickinson. [part\nGoing up to the \" blue \" one day she remarked, with real\ndelight :\n\" The dark woman has gone. She woke up !\n\" But\nlater on Malka turned up again in the same vague condition.\n\" She wants me to show her round. She doesn't know about\nanything.\" Later she met another lady also in a trance,\nwhose name she gave us, but unfortunately not her address.\nThis lady, she said, would go mad as the result of her trances.\nShe got her to promise to write to Dr. G., but the promise\nhas not been fulfilled. The most interesting person, however,\nwhom the subject met, and the immediate occasion of this\npaper, was a lady who lived in the reign of Kichard the\nSecond. As this whole episode is very curious, I propose to\ndescribe it at some length.\nAt the beginning of one of the sittings, the subject began\nas follows :\n\" Standing beside myself. Can't stop here now.\nGot to a different place. Lots of people. Eeal people. They\nhave been alive. I don't know where it is. Never been\nthere before. Perhaps 100 years ago.\" She then went to\nthe \" blue \" to observe this place from there, and having\nsatisfied herself that it was real, went back to it. She then\nmet and fell into conversation with a lady whom she con-\ntinued to visit during the several following sittings. This\nlady gave her name as Blanche Poynings. As presented to\nus she was a lady of very distinct character, a great gossip,\ntaken up exclusively with herself and her circle of friends\nand acquaintances, which was a very distinguished one. She\nwas a great friend of Maud, Countess of Salisbury, and much\nof her talk was about that lady and her husband, the Earl.\nThe Countess, she said, had been married three times, and\nshe gave the names of her former husbands,\u2014Aubrey, and\nSir Alan de Buxhall. She gave the names of her children\nby the Earl, and of her stepson, Alan de Buxhall, her own\nmaiden name, Frances, and the names of the Earl of Salisbury's\nbrothers. The Earl, Blanche said, was a cultivated man, a\npoet. Not that her standard of cultivation was high, for she\nthought it a wonderful thing that the Countess could write\nher own name. As to the Earl's poems, she could not quote\nus any, as \" she never remembered that sort of thing.\" She\nremembered, however, and described with much vigour, how\nthe Earl, who was a Lollard, threw the images out of his\n\ft\nlxiv.] Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis. 459\nchapel, and especially an image of Saint Catherine. This image,\nwhen they were removing it, fell on one of the men and\nmade his nose bleed. They were very frightened, said Blanche,\nbecause they thought Saint Catherine was after them. \" We\ndidn't really believe it,\" she said, \" but still we felt rather\nuncomfortable.\" The image was thrown into a ditch ;\nbut\npicked up by a man who repainted it and put it up in his\nbakehouse.\nA number of other facts were given about the Earl\nof Salisbury, such as his family name, Montacute, his title\nas Lord of the Isle of Man, and the name of one of his\nmanors, Bisham, to which they used to ride from London.\nBlanche's own maiden name, de Mowbray, was given, and\nthe name of the man she married after Poynings's death, Sir\nJohn Worth. Also the fact that she was expelled from\ncourt, together with Dame de Molyneux, by Arnold, one of\nthe Lords Appellant. We were also introduced to Joan, mother\nof Richard the Second, formerly known as the \" Fair Maid\nof Kent,\" whose fatness and good nature appeared to have\nmuch impressed and delighted Blanche. Her son by her first\nmarriage, John Holland, was also referred to, and the story\ntold how his squire was killed by \" some one else's \" squire,\nwhereupon John Holland, meeting this \" some one else,\" killed\nhim, remarking \" Your squire killed my squire whom I loved.\"\nOther historical personages introduced were the kings Richard II.,\nHenry IV., Richard's two queens, Ann of Orleans and\nIsabelle of France, and Aumerle, for whom Blanche expressed\ngreat dislike. The subject accounted for this by the state-\nment that Blanche had been engaged to marry him, but that\nhe had afterwards married some one else. \" She says he was\nthe worst of the lot, but she can't find much against him.\"\nIn addition to these distinguished people, Blanche gave informa-\ntion about one Ralph Turval, and his wife Ellen Newland,\na waiting woman of the Countess of Salisbury.\nShe was also full of information about the costume of the\nperiod. \" She used to wear brocaded velvet, trimmed with\nermine, and a high-peaked cap of minever. She wore blue velvet,\nembroidered with gold. Men wore shoes with long points\nwhich were chained to their knees. They had long hair cut\nstraight across the forehead.\" She described the three kinds\n2g\n\f460 G. Lowes Dickinson.

They always had a doctor\nin every house. He used to bleed them for everything. Often\nthe chaplain was the doctor. \" She used to have ague, and\nthey bled for that. When she had smallpox, they bled her\nevery third day, and put on cold water compresses, and nearly\nstarved her. They gave her bitter medicine. She thinks it\nwas dandelion.\" Her time seems to have been spent mainly\nin conversation and needlework, but she refers to occasional\njourneys, as to Bisham and to \" Stepany \" to see the may-\nhedges in spring.\nWe were naturally anxious to know what Blanche looked\nlike, and how she communicated with Miss C. To the former\nquestion the answer was rather curious. When asked what\nBlanche wore, we were told at first \" she wears only her blue\nmist.\" \" What does she look like ?\n\" \" She has white hair, is\ntall, with dark eyes. But she looks like that because she was\nlike that when she died. She can look any age.\" We asked to\nknow how she looked at the age of eight. She was then\ndescribed as having \" long brown hair ;\nlong dress and sleeves,\nwith grey fur round the edge.\" Also as carrying \" what she\nthinks is a doll. But really it's only a block of wood. They\nhadn't got any proper toys then. They made their own.\" To\nthe question what language Blanche talked, we were told she\ndidn't talk, but only communicated thoughts, so we got no\nspecimen of the English of that time. Blanche, we were\ninformed, was very much surprised to find she had been dead\nso long. Speaking of death, she said \" she was very surprised\nwhen she was first dead, but she soon got over it. She just\nwent to sleep and woke up dead.\" We asked what she had\nbeen doing up there all these years, and were told she had\nbeen doing nothing much. \" She has a lot to find out before\nshe gets anywhere else. She keeps on learning things without\nknowing it. She thought she knew everything there was to\nbe known, but she has just found out she does not.\" Blanche,\napparently, had had a lonely time. Anyhow she was particularly\npleased to find some one to talk to, and was always described\nas being \" on the look out \" when Miss C. went to visit her.\nSuch, in brief summary, is the principal information obtained\n\flxiv.] Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis. 461\nfrom Blanche. Now as to its objective truth. We none of\nus knew anything about the reign of Richard II., nor whether\nthere was an Earl of Salisbury at that time, and we were quite\nunable, at the first appearance of Blanche, to check any of her\ninformation. I took, however, an early opportunity of testing\nthe statements made. I found that the main facts about the\nEarl and Countess of Salisbury were true. Encouraged by this,\nI followed up, so far as I could, all the statements of names,\nrelationships and events. I looked up the chronicles and rum-\nmaged in peerages and charters, and was able in almost\nevery case to verify the truth of Blanche's assertions. This\ninterested and puzzled me. Miss C. assured me, and I believed\nher, that she had never studied the period. And in any case\nsome of the facts given were not such as even a student of\nthe period would naturally come across. Blanche Poynings\nherself, for example, was a quite unimportant person, only\nreferred to by name, by one or two chroniclers, as one of the\nladies in attendance on the Queen. The most likely explana-\ntion was that the facts narrated were contained in a historical\nnovel. But the only novel dealing with the period which\nMiss C. could remember reading was one entitled John Standish,\nand a reference to this showed that it was not the source of\nthe information she gave us. I clung, however, to the hypothesis\nthat a novel must be the explanation, though I am bound to\nconfess that as more and more facts came out, as these almost\ninvariably proved to be correct, as far as I could test them,\nand as they were in some cases obscure genealogical data such\nas it seemed unlikely would be embodied in a work of fiction,\nI came at last to think it possible that Miss C. was really com-\nmunicating with the departed Blanche Poynings. The mystery,\nhowever, was finally explained in a rather curious way.\nI went to tea with Miss C. Her aunt was present and\nher brother. We began talking about planchette. Miss C.\nsaid that she could draw, with planchette, faces which were\nfaces whichever way one looked at them, a feat which she\ncould not perform by conscious effort. I expressed a curiosity\nto see these faces, and planchette was produced. The faces\nwere not particularly interesting. But we went on to converse\nwith planchette in the ordinary way, eliciting at first the usual\nirrelevant nonsense. Presently, however, it was suggested that\n\f462 G. Lowes Dickinson. [part\nwe should see whether Blanche would communicate. Blanche\nwas immediately on the spot, and began by reproaching Miss C.\nfor not having been to see her lately. I quote now from the\nnotes made afterwards by Mr. Woolley from the original answers\nwritten by planchette, the sentences in round brackets being\nthe questions and remarks we addressed to it at the time.\nMiller.

I\nwould have told you, but you went away.\nOn the name of this novel being mentioned, Miss C. said\nat once that she believed there was a novel with that\ntitle, and that she had read it. This was confirmed by her\naunt. But neither of them could remember anything about\n\fLxrv.] Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis. 463\nthe book, not even the period with which it dealt, nor whether\nit contained any mention of Blanche Poynings. I took an\nearly opportunity of investigating the point, discovered the\nbook in question, and discovered in it every person and every\nfact (with one or two trifling exceptions) which had been\nreferred to in the supposed interviews with Blanche Poynings.\nThe whole thing had been an elaborate rearrangement by Miss\nC.'s subconsciousness of data given in a book she had com-\npletely forgotten. At a later sitting (June 10th, 1906), Miss\nC, in her hypnotic state, was asked about the novel, and\nmade an attempt of a kind which I fancy to be characteristic\nof subconscious states to get out of the difficulty. I quote\nfrom the record of this sitting\n:\n(Can you see yourself young 1)\nYes.\n(Can you see your aunt reading a book, Countess Maud 1)\nYes ; blue book, with gold line across name of it.\n[My copy is red.]\n(What is it about?)\nEllen Turval, and the Earl and Countess of Salisbury.\n(How old were you 1)\nTwelve.\n(Did you read it yourself?)\nI looked at it, and painted a picture in the beginning.\n(Did you read the Appendix 1\n?)\nNo.\n(Did your aunt 1)\nNo.\n(What was it about\n1\n?)\nThe people in the book. I used to turn over the pages. I\ndidn't read it, because it was dull. Blanche Poynings was in the\nbook \u2022\nnot much about her.\n(How much did you get from Blanche Poynings \u2014how much\nfrom the book 1)\nNearly all the events from the book, but not her character. . . .\nThere was a real person called Blanche Poynings that I met, and\nI think her name started the memory, and I got the two mixed up.\nOn this it may be remarked that Miss C. must have read\nthe Appendix, as some of the genealogical facts come from it.\nAs to the character of Blanche, what she says is quite true,\n\f464 G. Lowes Dickinson. [part\nfor this lady, who in the novel is nothing if not pious and\ndiscreet, became in the hands of Miss C.'s subconscious self a\ngarrulous and flippant gossip. And this brings me to a point\nwhich seems worth noting in the whole episode. Though Miss\nC. got her facts from the novel, she made up (presumably on\nthe basis of miscellaneous theosophic reading) a quite new\nsetting. She selected as her interviewer in this imaginary\nworld a subordinate character, not the heroine of the book\n(who is the Countess Maud). And she introduced the data, not\nin the order or connection in which they occur in the book,\nbut, most naturally and skilfully, as they might actually come\nout haphazard in a conversation. Her subconscious self showed\nin fact remarkable invention and dramatic power (as is often\nthe case with dream-selves) ; so that if we had not\nhappened to light upon the source of the information given\nthrough Blanche Poynings, it might have seemed a plausible\nview (failing any invincible a priori scepticism) that Miss C.\nreally did visit a real world and hold conversations with real\npeople. As it is, the discovery of the source of the Blanche\nPoynings episode throws discredit on everything else, and\nespecially on the elaborate details about her past lives with\nwhich Miss C.'s subconscious self also favoured us.\nAppendix.\nI give below a few extracts from the detailed record of the\nsittings to illustrate the line of thought of the hypnotic per-\nsonality :\nApril 29, 1906.\nI got straight into blue to-night. You told me to last time, so I\nwas obliged to.\nI can't tell if what I see are really what I see now or what I saw\na long time ago. Everything looks as if I was just seeing it.\nCan't tell where things are. Just the same if they are close or\nfar away. Can't get used to it.\nDon't know where I am, too dark.\nGot back into blue now. I went out because I wanted to see\nthings. If I want to see anything it is there at once, just as real\nas if I hadn't made it, so I mustn't want to see things, because it's\nno good going to see things that aren't really there. (Try and go\nto your own, the real, plane again.)\n\flxiv.] Emergence of a Latent Memory under Hypnosis. 465\nI can't try to go to the real one. I must just drift down by\naccident. Why is it when I'm right up here I can talk with my\nbody? I'm not anywhere near it. (Go into blue and tell me.)\nIt's because everywhere is really the same place and when I'm\nup here I'm in my body too. I can't get my body up here, but I\ncan get all the rest of me down to my body. When I get right\ninto blue I forget all about my body and I can't quite see why.\nEverything like that finds its own answer if you think about it once.\nIt's no good going on thinking, because you can't think harder than\nyou can think. On different planes you get different answers to\nthe same question. All parts of the truth.\nThat silly woman wants me to shew her about again. Why\ndoesn't she find herself? I want to go and help her. She doesn't\nknow where she is. She says she's been here a long time and can't\nfind anybody. She doesn't do what I tell her, perhaps she can't. Her\nname is Malka. She's been trying to see things without knowing\nthe proper way. She wants to get back. She doesn't know much.\nStupid of her to come when she doesn't know anything. She came\nby herself. She doesn't know her own name and she can't find her\nother half. It's rather ridiculous, isn't it? I must go down and see\nthings. I can't go up into the white, because I couldn't get back.\n(How do you hear me?) You're up here too. I don't hear your\nvoice, only understand your thought. I don't really see things, only\nunderstand. I don't think or feel either. When I go from one\nplane to another I don't really go. It's like dissolving into another.\nI can't tell you things exactly, because there are lots of things there\nare no words for. Sometimes when I'm coming out to tell you\nthings I forget them on the way. I can't forget them really, you\nknow. They're all in the back of my head. (What sort of things?)\nAll blank. When I try to think of them it makes me feel as if\nI was sinking deeper. It's stupid to use words. It's much better\nhere, because you can't make a mistake in what you're saying.\nPink spirit again. Been waiting for me. Spirits that have never\nbeen incarnate are pink. It hasn't got a proper plane of its own.\nEverything is all thought really. The pink spirit is my own\nthought. When you once do a thing you can't undo it.\nThings aren't really coloured. They only make one feel like it.\nOther people may see the same things and describe them differently.\nThe things, added to what you are yourself, make what you see.\nWhen I haven't got enough blue I keep getting down on to my\nown thought plane and I can't tell whether things are real or not.\n\f466 G. Lowes Dickinson. [part\nIt's no good trying to see things on the earth, because you can't\ntell whether they're real or not.\nIf I stop in the blue I never find anything.

Everything is recorded here\nsomewhere, but it isn't always easy to find. If you go by yourself\nand aren't very strong, you get caught in the first will current that\nthere is and are helpless. You must practise and train by minimizing\nthe body and strengthening the will. Live by yourself and think of\nnothing but going there ; but you may get stuck there. The only\nthing that's good for everybody is to strengthen their will. Thinking\nis good because it makes a kind of atmosphere round you. You\nmust think about something and you might as well think about this.\nMany people don't know how to think, and stop a long time in the\nfirst stage where you go directly you die. First you have to learn\nhow to think and how little you know : then how to distinguish\nbetween true and false. You can learn both in the body.\nYou may meet the same people in successive incarnations if you\nare very fond of them and on the same level. You can always find\nany one up there.

Live people are so\ndense, it is very difficult for the dead people to get a message\nunderstood. Some of them are mischievous and play tricks. Death\nmakes no difference. It's only leaving your body behind. The\nbody is something to live in and it conveys impressions to your\nmind and teaches you.

Geneve, Librairie Kiindig : Paris, Librairie\nFischbacher (royal 8vo, pp. 561, 7 fr. 50).\nThis latest work from Professor Flournoy's hand is not less interest-\ning than those which have preceded it, and is at the same time\nextremely valuable by reason of the large mass of material which\nit contains. It will, indeed, be found to form an admirable book\nof reference, of great service to any one who is interested in the\nvarious departments of psychical research. The author's pen has\nlost nothing of its characteristic eloquence, and he shows us once\nmore how incomparable a medium for psychical analysis is the\nFrench language in the hands of one who is at once a literary\nexpert and a master of the subject.\nThe book is, in sum, a detailed exposition, supported by voluminous\nevidence, of M. Flournoy's conclusions concerning such physical and\npsychical phenomena as had come to his knowledge up to the\ntime of writing, and in particular concerning the great question of\nexperimental communication with discarnate or unincarnate spirits.\nAs to the possible achievement of this last he professes himself to\nbe quite open to conviction (for he is definitely a \" Spiritualist,\" 1\n) )\nbut at present unconvinced.\nThe following quotation from the Preface will give a sufficiently\nclear indication of the author's position :\n\"Les faits que j'ai pu etudier d'un peu pres m'ont tous laisse\n1\nM. Flournoy distinguishes between \" Spiritualists \" (Spiritualistes), i.e. those\nwho believe that the soul of man survives the death of the body, and\n\"Spiritists\" (Spirites), those who believe in the reality of the alleged experi-\nmental communications with spirits. This distinction is observed in this review.\n\fLXIV.] Review. 469\nl'impression qu'en depit de certaines apparences superficielles, . . .\nc'est se tromper lourdement que d'attribuer aux Esprits des\nmorts, aux desincarnes, comme on les appelle, les curieux pheno-\nmenes que presentent les mediums.\n\" La plupart de ces phenomenes s'expliquent facilement et\nsans r6sidu par des processus inherents aux mediums eux-\nmemes et a leur entourage. L'etat de passivite ou de laisser-\naller, l'abdication de la personnalite normale, le relachement\ndu controle volontaire sur les mouvements musculaires et les\nassociations d'idees, \u2014toute cette disposition psycho-physiologique\nspeciale oil le sujet se place dans l'attente et le desir de com-\nmuniquer avec les trepasses, favorise chez-lui la dissociation\nmentale et une sorte de regression infantile, de rechute a une\nphase inferieure d'evolution psychique, oil son imagination\npuerile se met tout naturellement a jouer au desincarne, dont\nl'idee la hante, en utilisant pour ses roles les ressources de la\nsubconscience (complexus emotifs, souvenirs latents, tendances\ninstinctives ordinairement comprimees, etc.).\"\nThe volume is divided into two Parts, of which the first has a\ncurious history. In 1898, M. Flournoy, having become interested\nin matters psychical, addressed to the members of the Soctitt des\nEtudes Psychiques (a spiritist society, of which he was not himself a\nmember), and to some others, a lengthy and elaborate questionnaire\nconcerning their psychical experiences, their conclusions as to these,\nand other relevant matters. His hope was that he might discover\namong the answers some good evidence of spirit intervention. The\nreplies received were 72 in number, and many of them of considerable\nlength ; but none contained such convincing proofs as he desired.\nHe then published in the Revue Philosophique (fevrier, 1899) an\narticle embodying the conclusions to which he had been led by his\ninvestigations \u2014conclusions which were altogether unfavourable to\nthe claims of the spiritists. He naturally did not publish the whole\ndossier of replies, and the failure to do so then or subsequently\nbrought down on his head a storm of reproaches from spiritist\ncircles ; he was accused of wilfully suppressing much valuable evi-\ndence that told against his own views. In the end, M. Flournoy\ndecided that honour required him to print without selection the\nwhole mass of these replies. He has accordingly given them to us\nin the present volume (of which they fill the first 202 pages in\nsmall print), together with some valuable observations upon them\nand a restatement of his conclusions.\n\f470 M. A. Bayfield. [part\nThe replies themselves will be found to possess considerable interest\n\u2014until they weary by their bulk and, to some extent, by their\nsameness. They contain accounts of a good number of remarkable\nphenomena, veridical dreams, etc., apparently well attested and\ndeserving of permanent record ; but what strikes one most forcibly\nin the perusal is that the writers, almost without exception, seem\nto have no knowledge whatever of the telepathic powers of the\nhuman personality. True statements received through trance mediums\nor automatic writing are credited without hesitation to the spirits\nof deceased persons, while false ones are assigned, with equal\nndiveU, to malicious spirits. The following is an abridged account of\none instructive case which M. Flournoy discusses at length on\npp. 276 ff.\nA certain M. Til (teacher of book-keeping, aged 48), a man\nin excellent health and of a genial and kindly nature, attempted\nautomatic writing, and at once succeeded. A continuance of\nthe writing on the following days greatly excited him ; he was\nobsessed by grapho-motor impulses, even at night, and would\nwrite in the air with his finger if he had no pencil. On the\nfourth day, in answer to questions about the careers of his\nchildren, the script made vague and disquieting insinuations\nagainst his son Edouard (who was employed in a business office),\nand ended with the formal accusation that Edouard had stolen\nhis employer's cigarettes, and received a letter of dismissal.\nFurther script, obtained the same afternoon, urged M. Til to\ngo at once to see his son's employer. He went, but the employer\nwas out. The chief clerk, however, gave an excellent report\nof the young man. While the clerk was speaking, M. Til's\nfinger wrote in the air, \" Je suis navre de la duplicite de cet\nhomme.\" The employer then arrives, and completely reassures\nthe distressed father as to his son's conduct, but had hardly\ndone so when M. Til's finger wrote, \"Je t'ai trompe, Michel,\npardonne-moi\n!\n\"\nThis case donne a penser. Not a few of us have hitherto been\nthe more disposed to accept as genuine various spirit impersonations\nand messages which have come under our notice because we found\nit hard to believe the subliminal self capable of such positively\ncruel deceptions as must, in the alternative, be laid to its charge in\ncertain cases. But in this instance we find M. Til's subliminal self\n\u2014\nfor there is no ground for supposing we are concerned with any\nexternal influence whatever\u2014pouring forth, with all the devilry of\n\fLXIV.] Revietv. 471\na \"Sally Beauchamp,\" a series of circumstantial lies specially calcu-\nlated to wound the father in perhaps his tenderest point ;\n\u2014\" any-\nthing to give pain,\" as Michael Finsbury said. And when at last\nthe game is up, it makes an airy admission of guilt, with no hint\neither of shame or regret. My own experience furnishes a parallel\nof similar effrontery. In the course of some table-tilting experiments\nmade by Miss Verrall and myself, the table, which had professed to\nbe inspired by \" the sub. of both,'' told us a short story, with\nnames, addresses, etc., which was easily discovered to be false. When\npressed to justify this at a subsequent sitting, it coolly replied,\n\"When I do not know, I draw upon my imagination.\" One may\nattempt to minimise the importance of M. Til's case by saying\nthat it finds its analogy in the absurdities and villainies of dreams,\nin which the moral sense and the normal control of the will are\nin abeyance, but by what criterion can we exclude from the same\ncategory any of our automatic scripts, or any of the impersonations\nand communications of the entranced personalities of Mrs. Piper and\nMrs. Thompson ? No less than in our own cases M. Til's script\nexhibits purpose and design, and the purpose is inexcusably naughty.\nThe conclusion seems to be that we can no longer set a limit to the\npossible vagaries of the subliminal self ; it is largely irresponsible\nand is apparently capable de tout !\nThe Second Part of the volume is occupied with \" Observations\ndiverses.\" There is an introductory chapter on \"Science et Me'ta-\njisychique,\" in which the author discusses incidentally Professor\nRichet's experiences at the Villa Carmen in Algiers, and the storm\nraised in the scientific world by his temerity in publishing them. A\nhighly appreciative chapter is devoted to \"F. W. H. Myers et la Psychohgie\nsubliminale.\" While he has nothing but admiration for Myers's great\nand illuminating synthesis, M. Flournoy is at present unable to\nfollow him in his conviction that he had held communication with\nthe spirit world.\n\"II faut bien distinguer, clans l'ceuvre de Myers, la creation\nde la psychologie subliminale, et le systeme philosophico-religieux\nqu'il pretendait en tirer. . . .\n\" Si les decouvertes futures viennent a confirmer sa these de\nl'intervention empiriquement verifiable des desincarnes dans la\ntrame physique ou psychologique de notre monde phenomenal,\nalors son nom s'inscrira au livre d'or des grands initiateurs, et,\njoint a ceux de Copernic et de Darwin, il\ny compl^tera la triade\n\f472 M.

Buscarlet returned to Geneva in August, 1883, after\nbeing for three years governess to the two little daughters of\nMme. Moratief at Kasan in Russia. At Kasan she had made the\nacquaintance of two friends (amongst others) of Mme. Moratief\n;\nthese were Mile. Olga Popoi and Mme. Nitchinof.

Buscarlet's departure, \u2014and was very intimate with\nMme. Moratief. On Dec. 22, 1883 (Dec. 10, O.S.) Mme. Buscarlet\nwrote a letter to Mme. Moratief, but apparently did not post\nit for two days, for M. Flournoy, \u2014who has seen both the\nletter and its envelope\u2014states that the latter bears the Geneva\npost-mark of Dec. 24, and (together with other Russian post-\nmarks) that of \" Kasan 20. xii. 83.\" Thus, according to the\nRussian calendar (O.S.), it left Geneva on Dec. 12, and reached\nKasan on Dec. 20, taking eight days for the journey. The letter,\nwhich is written in French, opens with about a page of Christ-\n\fLXIV.] Review. 473\nmas greetings, and then goes on as follows :\n\u2014\" Cette nuit, j'ai\nfait un drole de reve, que je veux vous raconter, non que j'y\nattache une importance quelconque, mais seulement parce que\nc'est drole. Vous et moi etions sur un chemin, dans la cam-\npagne, lorsque passa devant nous une voiture d'ou sortit une\nvoix qui vous appela. Arrivees pres de la voiture, nous vimes\nMile. Olga Popoi 1\ncouchee en travers, vetue de blanc avec\nun bonnet garni de rubans jaunes. 2\nElle vous dit : Je vous ai\nappelie pour vous dire que Mme. Nitchinof quitte Vlnstitut le 17.\nPuis la voiture continua de rouler. Que les reves sont parfois\nburlesques !\n\" The remaining two pages of the letter deal with\nother subjects.\nNow for what happened at Kasan. In a letter dated Kasan,\nDec. 20 [O.S.]\u2014the day on which the Geneva letter arrived\n\u2014\nM. Moratief wrote to Mme. Buscarlet that he and his wife had\ndined at Mme. Nitchinof's house on the 13th [i.e. the day\nafter the posting of Mme. B.'s letter]. After dinner Mme. N.\nfelt unwell, but a doctor, who arrived immediately, diagnosed\nnothing more than \"une simple et legere angine.\" On the\n14th and 15th the doctors (three in number) found nothing\nalarming, and only on the morning of the 16th did scarlet fever\ndeclare itself. [There appears to have been also diphtheria.]\nAt 5.0 p.m. of that day the patient could hardly speak, and she\ndied at 11.45 p.m. the same night. For fear of infection, the\nbody was removed from the school to a neighbouring chapel\nat 2.0 a.m. on the 17th.\nThere are also letters from two other people living at Kasan\nwhich confirm these facts.\nThus the dream is exactly fulfilled, and the use of the peculiar\nword quitte is seen to be precisely adapted to the circumstances.\nThere was no question of Mme. N.'s dismissal or of her resigna-\ntion of her post. She had been established at Kasan for many\nyears, with all her children, and never left it\u2014nor was likely\nto leave it \u2014during the Christmas holidays. M. Flournoy has\n1\nIn 1901 \u2014when M. Flournoy interviewed her\u2014Mme. Buscarlet was alto-\ngether unable to explain the intrusion of Mile. Popoi dans cette galere ; she\ncould not recall that this lady (who appears to have been alive at the time\nof the dream) was in any way concerned with the actual occurrences.\n2\nMme. B. had seen in Russia the corpse of a lady similarly dressed. The\ncap was white, as it was also in the dream, according to Mme. B.'s verbal\nstatement to M. Flournoy.\n\f474 M. A. Bayfield. [part\ninvestigated the case thoroughly, and is convinced that there\nis in it neither collusion nor fraud. He would explain the\ndream as a telepathic communication [through Mile. Popo'i?]\nfrom Mme. Nitchinof herself: her subliminal consciousness was\nfully aware, as early as Dec. 9 (O.S.) of all that was to happen in\nthis strange tragedy, even to the extraordinary detail of the\nbody's immediate removal in the early hours of the 17th, some\ntwo hours after death. This may be so, \u2014or it may not ; but\none certainty, at any rate, emerges from this remarkable case,\nand that is, that a mortal (be it Mme. Buscarlet or both she\nand Mme. Nitchinof) may have prophetic knowledge\u2014a thing\nwhich, in more important connexions, some have found reason\nto doubt.\nM. Flournoy next turns to physical phenomena. A chapter is\ngiven to Eusapia Palladino, and another to other mediums. Of the\ngenuineness of some physical phenomena\u2014and he has himself wit-\nnessed many\u2014he has no doubt, and he offers theories of the possible\nmethods of their production.\nOf Eusapia he writes :\n\u2014\n\" En ce qui me concerne, je dois dire que les ph6nomenes palla-\ndiniens\u2014si etranges qu'ils paraissent an premier abord et si\ninadmissibles qu'ils soient forcement pour qui n'en a pas vu\nlui-meme ou n'est pas an courant de la litterature du sujet\n\u2014\nsont aujourd'hui hors de doute a mes yeux (autant qu'une\nquestion de fait peut l'etre), tant est considerable le poids des\npreuves qu'ils ont en leur faveur.\"\nAmong the matters treated in the remainder of the book, reference\nis made to the mediumship of Mrs. Piper\u2014which M. Flournoy\nrecognises to be of a truly remarkable character\u2014and to the\ncross-correspondences, but both subjects are treated with disappoint-\ning brevity. In each case spirit-intervention is rejected as \" not\nproven.\" Those, however, who lean to the spiritistic view of Mrs.\nPiper's impersonations and utterances (and the cross-correspondences\nare closely bound up with these) will feel satisfaction in finding\nthat when M. Flournoy attempts to formulate a telepathic theory,\nhe falters and speaks in a tone of uncertainty not to be found else-\nwhere in the book. Certainly one who, like myself, is torn both\nways in a state of absolute indecision is not much helped by the\nfollowing suggestion :\n\fLXIV.] Review. 475\n[How are we to explain the impersonations and the knowledge\nshown of the deceased person, if it is not by his actual inter-\nvention ?]\n\" A moins cependant (il faut penser a tout) que\nle sosie partiel du defunt, que l'un des assistants aurait transmis\ntelepathiquement a Mme. Piper, ne se fut ensuite complete\ngraduellement chez celle-ci, en attirant a lui, par quelque\nobscure affinite psychologique, les autres sosies fragmentaires\nepars chez d'autres personnes.\"\nWe miss here the sure touch that we find elsewhere in the volume\n;\nand we miss it, as I think, because M. Flournoy is fully alive to the\ncrucial difficulty of the telepathic hypothesis, \u2014viz. that it seems to\ndemand the assumption of an incredible selective power as part of\nthe telepathic faculty. Apparently the medium's mind must be\nable to range the world, and pick out of the million memories of\none selected individual just the memory or memories required.\n\" Mais il y a des faits plus complexes, oil il faudrait admettre\nune telepathie active et selective, par laquelle l'imagination hyp-\nnoide de Mme. Piper s'en irait choisir, chez beaucoup de vivants\npresents ou absents, les souvenirs, concernant precisement tel\ndesincarne, et les reunirait de facon a reconstituer une image\ntotale plus complete qu'aucune des images partielles qu'il a\nlaissees chez les diverses personnes de sa connaissance.\"\nWith regard to the cross-correspondences in particular, the author's\nlast words\u2014coloured, I fear, with a faint tinge of irony\u2014are these :\n\u2014\n\" Souhaitons que Myers ou d'autres Esprits, s'ils sont vraiment\nen jeu en tout cela, nous revelent bientot le moyen d'eliminer\nde leurs apparentes manifestations Taction combinee de l'imagina-\ntion subliminale, dont on n'a que trop souvent deja constate la\nmalice, et de la telepathie des vivants, dont on ne connait pas\ndu tout les limites. Et en attendant, laissons la porte ouverte\na toutes les possibilites de l'avenir !\n\"\nThe last published Part of our Proceedings (LXIII.) had not been\nissued when M. Flournoy's book appeared, and he was therefore\nunacquainted with its contents. It would be interesting to learn\nwhether they have in any degree modified his judgement. Some of\nthese newly published incidents are certainly of a very remarkable\ncharacter, and have \u2014it must be confessed \u2014so seriously increased\nthe difficulties of the telepathic hypothesis that, if I may speak for\nmyself, the point at issue has now come to be this : \u2014is it more\n\f476 M. A. Bayfield. [part lxiv.]\nreasonable to attribute the production of certain phenomena solely\nto the subliminal self, making an assumption as to its powers which\nreally goes beyond the evidence,\u2014or to assign some share in the\nphenomena to the intervention of discarnate spirits, to which\nmuch of the evidence seems most naturally to point 1 When the\nmatter is stated thus, the position of one who remains provisionally\na \" telepathist \" seems somewhat paradoxical, but future research\nmight prove it to have been justified. Agreement between the\nholders of the two opposed views may, however, never be reached\n;\nfor conviction, one way or the other, will probably not be attained\nby the reasoning powers alone, and the belief which supplies a\nfelt need is commonly the one which we embrace. This, indeed,\nM. Flournoy has found to be frequently the case with convinced\nspiritists. Though the evidence for spirit communication is still,\nas he resolutely maintains, inadequate, and though they have not\nexamined the evidence critically for themselves, many spiritists\nbelieve that proof of such communication exists somewhere, and they\nadopt spiritism as a faith because it gives them a desired assurance\nof that future life to which they instinctively look forward.\nOn the other hand, even though \" Science \" should to-morrow\nstamp the spiritist view with its official approval, what would this\napproval be worth ? It would only show that on the authority of a\nsufficient number of responsible thinking men this theory might be\ngenerally adopted as being for the moment and according to present\nknowledge the one which best accounted for the observed facts.\nAbsolute certainty would be as far off as ever, for time might reverse\nthe verdict. It would all still be a matter of faith ; and a bare belief\nin the soul's survival of the body's dissolution would rest on evidence\nin no way superior (to say the least) to the credentials of the Christian\nFaith, which\u2014if I may say it here without indiscretion\u2014modern\npsychical research has, in my own humble judgement, only\nstrengthened.\nM.
