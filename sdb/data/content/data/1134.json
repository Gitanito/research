Editor: Walter G. Peterkin, editor and publisher.\r\n Corporate author:  Society of American Magicians1\/1, 1895-1906, with a hiatus between November 1895 and February 1898.\n\n Despite its promising title, this is a stage-magic journal, but the close relationship with phenomenal spiritualism is obvious in the advertisements for magical apparatus.  It also featured a series of articles on the development of American prestidigitation by Henry Ridgely Evans, who was himself a trained magician.  Rowell's American Newspaper Directory for 1900 says the journal was spiritualist and was started in 1898 and had a circulation of less than 1,000.\n\n       Issues:Mahatma V4 1900       <\/p>\n\n  \r\nIAPSOP materials are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License. \r\n IAPSOP respects people's privacy and personal data rights.             <\/HTML>\n\n[1] http:\/\/iapsop.com\/archive\/materials\/mahatma","_id":1134}
