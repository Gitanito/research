The experiments\nwere resumed and carried on till Christmas, when I was obliged, by\niII-health, to discontinue all further inteIlectual work.\nHowever, as I had commenced the investigations, and as it appeared\nthat the cases of the possession of the power were very few, I considered\nit my duty to pursue the inquiry in the interests of science; and my\nfirst endeavour was to secure the aid of some good Rcientific authorities.\nI first asked my cousin, Dr. Guthrie, Professor of Physics at South\nKensington, to be present. He, however, was only able to attend one\nevening and part of another, and expressed no opinion. I therefore\nmade it a. rule that I would entrust the investigation to no one who\nwould not promise to attend four evenings at least, as, moreover, I\nfound the presence of strangers sometimes disconcerting. In the\nspring of 1884 I was fortunate enough to secure the assistance of Dr.\nLodge, Professor of Physics, University College, Liverpool, whose\nreport was presented to our Society and was published in Vol. II. of\nthe Proceedings. This report vouched for the genuineness and accuracy\nof the experiments, and contained an account of some new arrange-\nDigitized by Google\n\fFH,.t\"~r Report 0,. TI,ougllt-Transj'erellce. 425\nments. In the autumn I also had the company of Dr. Herdman,\nProfessor of Biology at the same college. We were sufficiently\nsuccessful under his observation, but not as much so as previously.\nIn the summer we lost the services of one of our percipients,\nl\\Iiss Edwards, who left to be married and was no longer available.\nMiss Relph, however, kindly continued to give her assistance at\nmeetings during the autumn, which were attended by Dr. Herdman,\nlIr. R. C. Johnson, F.R.A.S., Mr. H. E. Rensburg, and others.\nAt Christmas there was an interregnum, owing to Miss R. suffering\nfrom a quinsey, and we did not resume work until the month of April.\nDr. Herdman was not able to attend, on account of extra. work con-\nQected with the new marine biology studies; but he recommended three\nmedical men, of whom one only, Dr. Hyla Greves, was able to take up\nthe inquiry. Dr. Hicks, President of the Microscopical Society of\nLiverpool, also joined in the inquiry; and these two gentlemen have\nboth expressed themselves as perfectly satisfied with the fact of the\nmental transference of impressions without contact from one person to\nanother, as exhibited by our varied experiments. Throughout the\nstudies of the autumn and winter I have had the valuable assistance of\nMr. R. C. Johnson, and of Mr. James Birchall, the hon. secretary of\nthe Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool. .\nI have noticed a falling off in the facility and success of our\nexperiments since our first great results were obtained. I do not know\nto what cause to attribute this declension. Personally, I find I am not\nequal to my former self in my power to give off impressions, and if I\nexert myself to do so I experience unpleasant effects in the head and\nnervous system. I therefore seldom join in the active experiments,\nbut leave the thinking for the most part to others. Then we have lost\none of our percipients; and as the novelty and vivacity of our seances\nhas departed there is not the same geniality and freshness as at the\noutset. The thing has become monotonous, whereas it was formerly a.\nsuccession of surprises. We have now nothing new to try. J do not\nknow if there is loss of power on the part of the percipient; it is just\nas likely that the agents are in fa.ult.\nI have been, I need hardly say, ,'eryanxious to find additional\ncasea of percipiency, and I have induced quite a number of people\nto make trials in this direction, but hitherto without any satis-\nfactory result. I have, indeed, heard of several apparently genuine\ncases, but have never been able to get at them. There has always\nbeen a reticence which has caused me to meet with disappointment,\nwhen I have ~xpressed a desire for a scientific investigation. Some\ncases reported to me turned out to be simply varieties of the willing-\ngame done under contact, and evidently the result of unconscious\nmuscular indication.~. One Ca8Q I investigated, in which five or six\n2 s\nDigitized by Google\n\f426 Furtller RejJ()I\"t 011 TlIougld-Transference.\npersons were supposed to possess the power, was evidently explainable\nby the limited number of objects experimented with, all known ~\nthe supposed percipients, and conjured up by them in the mind's eye.\nThis was merely a co.se of gueBBing.\nI have not much in the way of novelty to report beyond my\nprevious range of experiments. These included the successful transferp\nwith and without contact,of (a) visual impreBBions, actual and imagin~\nextending up to complicated pictures; (6) impreBBions of pains\nunder contact, and (c) impressions of tastes and smells under\ncontact; (d) impreBBions of names and numbers, with and with-\nout contact; (e) willing without contact. Dr. Lodge tried\nthe remarkable experiment of two independent visual impressions.\ntransferred at the same time by two agents to the mind of one per-\ncipient, which resulted in a combined impreBBion, in which the two\noriginals were absolutely united. At the suggestion of Dr. Herdman,\nwe tried pains without contact. The percipient, blindfolded and isolatedp\nSlIt with hel\u00b7 back towards the company, who simultaneously infiicted\nupon themselves a pain in a given spot, and this has been repeatedly\nindicated with great exactneBB by the percipient. Another novelty has\nbeen the transference of imagined tunes. This has not been done with-\nout contact, and naturally gave rise to the inquiry whether the notion of\ntune could hM-e been transferred by muscular indications. 'Ve there-\nfore tried to transfer tunes by muscular indications to all the persons\npresent, but failed; and it seems not unreasonable to suppose that a.\nperson who is on his guard can prevent himself from conveying the\nsharply-defined rhythm of a tune by a series of paUl or sudden pressures\non another person's hand ; and alao that without COn8ci0U8ne88 of the\nrhythmic indications on the percipient's part, the tune could not be\nidentified.\nSome recent experiments in the presence of Dr. Greves have been\na little remarkable as illustrating the phenomena of inversioll and\nremlmscence. It has been observed that visual impressions are some-\ntimes given right as left, and left as right In many cases lately pains\nhave been correctly localised, but placed on the right side of the body\ninstead of the left, and on the left side instead of the right. Then as to\nreminiscence-in some taste experiments recently, it happened three\ntimes running that the taste which the percipient described was not the\none which the agent was at that moment tasting, but the one which he\nhad been tasting in the preceding trial a minute before, none of the\nsubstances having been named during the course of the experiments.\nIn looking back over the volumes of diagrams I possess, I find that\na good many which I considered failures at the time are evidently due\nto reminiscence of the preceding diagram which had not, in the majority\nof instances, been shown to the percipient in the interval. lly atten-\nDigitized by Google\n\fFurtllel\" Report on TltoltUht.TranRjerence. 427\ntion was first called to a case of this kind by Dr. Guthrie in regard to\none of the drawings executed in his presence.\n'Ve have now a record of 713 experiments, and I recently set\nmyself the task of classifying them into the 4 classes of successful,\npartially successful, misdescripUons, and failures. I endeavoured to\nwork it out in what I thought a reasonable way, but I experienced\nmuch difficulty in assigning to its proper column each experiment we\nmade. This, however, is a task which each student of the subject will\nbe able to undertake for himself according to his own judgment. I\ndo not submit my summary as a basis for calculation of probability. A\nfew successful experiments of a certain kind carry greater weight with\nthem, than a large number of another kind; for some experiments are\npractically beyond the region ofguesses. I doubt, indeed, if any amount\nof calculation of probabilities will help to convince of the trustworthiness\nof the experiments. One successful evening when the conditions are\nstrict is absolutely convincing; and the simple genuine truthfulness\nof the percipients is a better guarantee than any amount of subsequent\ncross-examination as to the conditions of trial.\nThe following is a summary of the work done, classified to the best\nof my judgment.\nFIRST SERIES.\nc.\nExperiment and Conditions. ili\n\"0\n]I:;;\n::.I\n- -- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - ---- ----\nVisual-Letters, fi~re8, and cards-Contact .... ..\ndo. 00. do.

I may remark that\nsince November, 1883, owing to a suggestion of Dr. Guthrie's, the\nobjects in all our visual experiments have been placed on a screen fixed\nto the back of the chair upon which the percipient is seated, blind-\nfolded-the agents taking their places in front of the screen at a distance\ngenerally of three or four feet. In previous experiments of this kind\nthe percipient, blindfolded, had faced the agents, the object or diagram\nexperimented with having been placed at a distance behind the per-\ncipient, and the agents looking over her shoulder. I do not consider\nthat the change of position made any difference in the result of the\nexperiments.\nThe following examples will give the most important of the results\nfrom the point where my former account broke oft In every case all\nthe experiments made on that occasion are given.\nLondon, 24th November, 1883. Evening.\np,.esent: Miss Relph, Miss Edwards, Mr. Hughes, and Mr. Guthrie.\nVisitors expected, but it was hoped they would not come, the company\nfeeling dispirited. Miss Relph proposed to try BOme of the experiments\nin colours and outlinea. Miss Relph was blindfolded and isolated, all\njoining in as operators.

A. Smith,\nand the same subject, Mr. F. Wells. They were made in the presence\nand under the superintendence of Professor and Mrs. H. Sidgwick, Mr.\nE. Gurney, and Dr. A. T. Myers, on March 20th and 21st, and July 3rd,\n1885, in a room at a hotel at Brighton, engaged for the occa-\nsion. On March 20th, Mr. Bull, F.R.C.S., and Mr. White Cooper\nwere also present.\nMr. Wells has been frequently mesmerised by Mr. Smith, and falls\nvery easily into the sleep-waking state under his influence. But in the\npresent experiments he is not put into any sleep, but remains in an\napparently completely normal condition. He lays his hands on the\ntable with the fingers extended and separated. Mr. Smith holds his\nhand pointed downwards, and with the four fingers in a line along one\nof llr. Wells' fingers, at a distance varying from say, two inches down-\nwards. With his hand in this position, he makes passes for some\nminutes along the finger j after which, if the experiment is successful,\nthe finger oyer which the passes are made, and that only, is found to\nhave lost all sensitiveness and to have become rigid. The effect goes of[\nafter a time in any case, but recovery seems to be materially hastened\nby reverse passes.\nThe measures taken to test the effect will be given in detail\npresently. With regard to the cause, the present experiments did not\ntake us very far j indeed, they are so little more than a mere repetition\nof part of what was done before, that the only excuse for publishing\nthem is that in the case of a phenomenon so little observed or recog-\nnised the mere verification of the fact that it occurs is worth some-\nthing, and so also is the wtimonyof fresh. witnesses, which Mr. and\nMrs. Sidgwick were. It was hoped that Mr. Bull and Mr. White\nCooper might have been so too j but the experiments, on the only\nday on which they were able to be present, calIDot be regarded as\nsuccessful.\nOf the possible explanations of the phenomenon we only endeavoured\nto eliminate two, namely, an influence on the nerves due (1) to expecta-\nDigitized by Google\n\f454 Local A.mestllesia induced in tlw\ntion on Mr. Wells' part, or (2) to mere monotonous stimulation due to\nthe passes and independent of the person making them. There remain\nthe severa.1 possibilities of II. mesmeric efBuence, such 8S Esda.ile\nbelieved water to be affected by when he mesmerised it; of some sort of\nwhat we may perhaps call nervous induction; and of suggestion con\u00b7\nveyed through unconscious telepathy. Mr. Wells is, according to his\nown account, quite unconscious of any effect whatever, mental or\nphysica.l ; so that, for instance, if he closes his hand he is unaware that\nthe affected finger remains extended, unless he can see it. From pre-\nvious experiments (see Proceeding\" Vol. II., pp. 203,204) there is some\nreason to think that the effect is only produced if Mr. Smith knows\nwhich finger he is making passes over, which suggests that a\n<:onscious direction of his thoughts or will is necessary. It\nis, however, very difficult to be sure that, in making this\nexperiment, the absenc~ of definite direction of attention was\nthe only change, having a bearing on the experiment, which the new\n<:onditions introduced. For instance, a want of confidence on the part\nof the operator may have been the real cause of failure. That\nmental disturbance has an important effect is at any rate suggested by\npart of our experience in tho present series of trials. The reader will\nsee, on turning to the table of experiments (pp. 457-9) that the success\non the first day was very poor. The first experiment succeeded well\nenough, but the second was broken off abruptly because we thought\nthat Mr. Smith had accidentally touched Mr.Wells' finger, which would\nhave nullified the precautions taken to prevent his knowing which finger\nwas being operated on. It was very important, of course, to take note\nof this fact; but we made a mistake in breaking off the experimen~\nsince this was very likely to produce a disturbing eft'ect on the minds\nof both operator and subject. And it seems not improbable that the\nfailure of the subsequent experiments on that day may have been due\nto this cause. Further experiments to throw lighfi on the cause of the\nphenomenon are much to be desired, but experimenation with Mr. Wells\nis attended with much difficulty. He is a busy and prosperous young\nman, not himself interested in the investigation; and, notwithstanding\nsome remuneration given for loss of time, finds it difficult to make\nthe arrangements necessary to enable bim to leave his business-that\nof a baker and confectioner-during the time necessary for the\nexperiment. The consequence is that we ha.ve found it difficult to\nobtain his services at all, have found it still more difficlllt to make\narrangements beforehand, and when Mr. Wells has come have had to\nwork under an inconvenient sense of limited time. We are, however.\ngrateful to him for the opportunities be has given us of trying experi-\nments which must be, to him, very tedious and uninteresting.\nWe proceed to the precautions taken to exclude, as fa.r\"as possible,\nDigitized by Google\n\fNormal State by lllesmel'ic Passel. 451)\nthe operation of expectation. Mr. Wells was, of course, aware of the\nnature of the experiment, and that one of his fingers was to be made\ninsensitive; but he was effectually prevented from seeing which of\nthe ten it was by two large sheets of thick brown paper, through\nholes in which his hands were passed. This screen extended in aU\ndirections ,far enough to prevelit the possibility of his seeing round it,\nand the armholes fitted closely enough to prevent his seeing through\nthem. We were unable ourselves to fee~ by air currents or otherwise,\npasses made over our fingers; and unless Mr. Wells' perceptions are\nmore acute, the paper screen seems to reduce the chance of his forming\na correct opinion as to which finger was being operated on to 1 in 10.\nAs a further precaution, Mr. Smith's passes were, in most of the experi-\nments, imitated over some other finger by one of the other persons pre-\nsent; so that if the passes could be felt, they might be felt in two fingers.\nThis would not guard against the possible perception of some subtle\ndifference between Mr. Smith's passes and others which eluded our own\nobservation, but it is difficult to see how this can be guarded against.\nThe finger to be operated on was always selected by some person other\nthan Mr. Smith; but the proximity of the operator and the \"subject\"\nis such as would make it hard absolutely to preclude the former from\ninforming the latter, by auditory or other signs, which is the selectec:l\nfinger, did he wish to do so. We have, howevElr, every reason to\nbelieve Mr. Smith to be as much interested in carrying out a genuine\nexperiment as the other persons present.\nThe passes made simultaneously over a different finger by another\nperson served further to exclude the second explanation we have spoken\nof, namely, that the aruesthesia may be due to the effect of mere pas&ell\non the nerves. Here again, however, as it seems almost impossible to\nprove that there is not some mechanica.l difference between the passes\nof Mr. Smith and his \"imitators, which cannot be discerned by tl\\.e eye,\nthe explanation is not completely excluded; and it is just conceivable\nthat some unconscious mechanical change in Mr. Gurney's mode of\nmaking the passes may explain the fact that in one experiment\n(No.9) the finger that he operated on imitatively, as well as that\noperated on by Mr. Smith, became insensitive. This happened again,\nbut to a very slight extent, in experiment No. 12. The fact seems\niDlportant, though the exact import of it canI10t be ascertained\nwithout further investigation. It, at any rate, seems to aft'ord an\nargument against the hypothesis that the effect is due to mesmeric\nefBuence.\nThis Dlay be the most convenient place to mention two other\nanomalies observed, and which we cannot at present interpret. In\nexperiment No. 6 Mr. Smith operated on the middle finger of\nMr. Wells' right hand, but it was the index finger, and not the\nDigitized by Google\n\f456 Local AmeJJilwsia induced ill t~e\nmiddle finger, which became insensitive and to some extent rigid. And\nin the next experiment (No.7) when the fourth finger was operated on\nwith success, the middle finger, which should have been rendered\ninsensitive in the previous experiment, seemed to be to a slight extent\naffected, though this wo.s a little doubtful. We have no note of reverse\npasses having been made over this finger after the previous experiment,\nnor ofany imitative passes being made in experiment No.7. Something\nof the same kind occurred in experiment No. 19. In the previous\nexperiment the fourth finger of the left hand had been operated on, but\nonly for two minutes and with slight success. Reverse passes were\nthen mada and sensitiveness, as we believed, completely restored. In\nexperiment No. 19 the little finger of the right hand was operated on\nsuccessfully, but the finger of the previous experiment became even\nmore insensitive, and it was not the one over which imitative passes\nwere made.\nTo test the insensitiveness, electric shocks were given hy means of a.\nmedical magneto-electric machine. One terminal ending in a cylindrical\nbrass handle, was placed under the palm of Mr. Wells' hands, and con-\ntact was made with the finger to be tested by meansof the point of a wire\nforming the other terminal; or, in experiments10 to 16, with the edge of\na cylindrical brass handle. The machine was adjusted to give the\nstrongest current it was capable of, and the handle turned as fast as we\ncould, that is about 2j- times a second. Each tum of the handle\nrepresented about 8! turns of the coils. In experiments 10, and 17 to 2()\ninclusive, care was taken that the palm of the hand, which rested on the\nelectrode, should be moist; and in the last four experiments the point of\nthe wire with which the other contact was made was previously\ndipped in water. In experiment 16'the palms of the hands were\nwetted with a sponge after the passes had been made, but before the\ninsensitiveness was tested. It was then found that a prick could be\nfelt in the finger operated on, but apparently not the electrical shock;\nbut curiously enough this was the only experiment in which the electti-\ncal shock contracted the fingers. The partial insensitiveness quickly\ndisappeared without reverse passes, and renewed passes did not restore\nit for some time, and then not completely. AB we supposed that this\nmight be due to fatigue, the experiments were discontinued for that day.\nRigidity was not looked for; but no reverse passes were made, and Mr.\nWells, on trying to close his hand after the screen was removed, found\nthe finger to be rigid.\nIn some of the experiments the insensitiveness was tested by a.\nsevere prick (applied in experiments 1 and 15 under the nail) as well\nas by the electric shocks.\nDuring the first experiment Mr. Bull noticed that Mr. Wells\ntrembled a good deal, suggesting an exercise of self-control But it is\nDigitized by Google\n\fNormal Slate by Mesmeric Pa88e8. 467\nDot unlikely that the trembling was simply callsed by the ra.ther violent\ntremor in the table on which his hands rested, caused by turning the\nelectrical machine. In experiment No. 5 Mr. Bull observed the same\ntrembling, but did not think it coincided with the severest shocks; and\nhis final opinion was that the trembling had had no emotional signific-\nance. Care was taken throughout the experiments to tum the machine\nwhen no contact was made, 80 that the exact moment of the shocks\nshould not be known by the shaking or the sound. During t.he last six\nexperiments of March 21st, Mr.Wells was reading to himself behind the\nscreen, and as far as we could judge went on doing so calmly when the\nEhocks were applied. During two of these experiments Dr. Myers\n(,specially noticed that the motion of his eyes travelling across the page\nwas quite equable, which seems a good proof of unconsciousness of pain.\nOn July 3rd Mr. Wells was engaged the whole time in conversation\nwith Dr. Myers, and during the last experiment especially he was\ntalking steadily and confidentially. Dr. Myers had good opportunity\nof observing the pupils of hia eyes, and could see no change due to\npain. The proof of insensitiveness is therefore, we think, pretty\ncomplete.\nThe following is a synopsis of the experiments. The fingers are\nnumbered in order beginning with the thumb of each hand, and the\nhands are distinguished as R. and L., 80 that, for example, L 2 means\nthe index finger of the left hand.

C. BuLL, F.R.C.S. ; and A. T. MYERS, M.D.\nOn April 17th, 1885, Mr. Husk met us at 24, CIarges Street, and\ncourteously agreed to such slight inconveniences as our examination of\nnecessity involved.\nWe found a metal ring on his left forearm; and our inquiry was\n\/.\n\u2022\nlimited solely to the determination whether that ring could have come\ninto the position it then held by known natural forces.\nThe ring was of iron, solid, formed of a continuous bar, skilfully\nDigitized by Google\n\fRep01\u00b7t on an Alleged Pllysical Pltenomenoll. 461\nwelded in one place, bearing marks of a file throughout, especially near\nthe place of welding. The internal circumference (as determined by\nthe mean of two independent measurements, differing from one a.nother\nby Imm. only) was 182\u00b75mm. ; the thickness of the iron, 4\u00b75mm. In\nshape it was roughly elliptical, the length of the major and minor axes\nbeing 68mm. and 48mm. The hand was fairly normal in size and\nproportion, and contained no soft tissues in excess; all the joints were\nloosely articulated; the fingers turned slightly outwards. No scars\nwere observed. A short transverse line was drawn on the back of the\nhand at the level of the lowest point of the styloid process of the radius,\nand at right angles to it another line down the long axis of the third\nmetacarpal bone, to the centre of the knuckle of the middle finger (third\nmeta.carpo-phalangeal joint). The length of this was found to be\nI) centimetres, as shown in the diagram. It was divided into eight\nparts, and used to determine some other measurements.\nThe hand was held out loosely, with the fingers in nearly complete\nextension, and the thumb turned inwards and lying across the palmar\nsurfaces of the hand. In this position, under slight compression, the\ngreatest circumference of the hand was found to be 230mm. Before\nother measurements were taken, the hand was reduced to a more\ncompact shape by gentle manipulation; it was \"troughed,\" i.e., the\ninner and outer palmar surfaces were approximated, the back was\nthereby made more convex, and the thumb was drawn downwards and\ninwards, so as to lie almost completely in the trough so formed in the\npalm of the hand. Measurements of the circumference were then\ntaken, first with metallic tape, afterwards with copper wire, at points\nmarked in the diagram: moderate, but not painful pressure was used\nat the moments of measurement. The measurements showed :-\nWith Metallic Tape.

As\nMr. Husk was disinclined for this, no such a.ttempt was made.\nMr. Victor Horsley subsequently took measurements, with metallic\ntape, of the circumference of the right hands of three men-Mr.\nCrookes assisting in two of the cases-(l) under the same conditions\nas those applied to Mr. Husk; and (2) again when they were under\nthe full influence\u00b7 of ether, but no other additional means had been\ntaken to reduce the volume of the ha.nd, e.g., by pressure, \u00abc., &c. The\npoints of measurement were distant 1, 2, 3, \u00abc., centimetres from th~\nstyloid process of the radius, along the metacarpal bone of the index\nfingel', after the plan adopted with Mr. Husk.
