And thisconciu*\nlion is a moft true one, fay the fame Rabbins, for\nas much as in a clear, bright night, a man may fee\ndn the Heavens all the Hebrew Characters perfectly\n'figured : which one cannot do of thofe feveral li-\nving Creatures, that are placed there^ feeing that\nthe Imagination cannot be any whit fatisfied, wherj\u00bb\nK 5\n'\ni^i'\n\fJ ^o T^he Teaiple of Wifdome.

The fame alfo may\nbe ^id ofT^wn^\n;\nfor there are Eleven Stars to be\nfeen there, which arc eflentially of this Conftellati-\npn\n5\nand yet are not brought in^ in the Pidure of it.\nSo likewife in the Conftellation o( Gemini there\n*\n*\nare Stars belonging to it^ which are diftingui-\n^* (bed from thofe Nineteen, that reprefent the\n*\nV\nigure of this Sign:\nas Cancer alfo hath four\n*\n*\nbright Stars, which lie loofe from thqfe nine,\n^^which make up the Image of this living Crea-\n^* cure. But as for the Hebrew letters, there\nis\n*\nnothing to hinder us, from finding them\n* diftin^fcly delcribed\n:\nand\nif\nany one do chance\n*\n\"^\nto find either Arahick^y or Samaritane Letters\nthere\n;\nthis isftill but to return? back to the Origi-\ngial. from whence they were takcu.\nFirft then we are to take nocice, that the Stars\nwhich make upthefe Letters^ are not difpofed into\nthe order they appear in, at ^11 adventures, nor in\nany confufed way, as they feem to us to be\n:\nbut are\nplaced thus, with foine Uefign, and in\na\ndivine Or-\nder; Cod having made all things in full Perfeftion.\nThofc that underftand not the\nt\nlay GfCheJfe^ feeing\nthe pieces (land here and there, fo confufedly, will\nleapt to think, no doubt, chat they ftand xii that\nconkifed mariner\nby\nmeer hap hazard, feeing that\nin fome places there are\na\ngreat many\n;\nand in fome,\nvery few\n;\nandqne fidcof the Chefle-board\nis\nfull,\nand the other fide quite bare, and in\na\nthird place\nperhaps\n)\nou (hall have but tw^, or three\n;\nIn\na\nword5,\n\fBook h The Temple of Wifdome. 1 5 %\nthis difference in the placing of the pieces is To\ngreat, as that he will certainly conclude, that the\nwhole bufinefs is clearly without any deligne at all ;\nnotwithftanding that they are all ranked in verycx-\n^Ot order ; and that there is not the leaft piece there,\nbut is of ufe, and doth its proper office. After the\nfame manner is it with the Sears, which we fee in\nthe Heavens ; for, though in fome places you fee\nmany togctherjandin others buta fewjand that the\norder they ftand in, looks confufedly^and in a man-\nner rediculous ; yet neverthelefs is it moftadnijr*\nable, initfelf, and proceeds from fome moil won\"\nderful defigne ; which thofc men perfectly under-\nhand, who by this holy Life, arc elevated above all\nthat is here below. Thus it is ftoried of St. Anthony^ \u2022\nthat he perfectly undcrftood thifi Heavenly Writings\nwhich we taught before.\nSecondly, that although the Stars which areiq\nthe eighth HeavenOf at leaft there be any fuch thing\nas an eighth Heaven,) be fixed j yec do they not\ntherefore alwayes compofe the fame letters, at leaft,\nthe greateft part of them j but they have their\nchanges, according to the diverfc Afpefts of the\nPlanets, Thus thofe St^rs fhat ten years iiace,\nmade up, for Example, a Tct^, (hall now perhaps\nmad<e a Mem, or a Lamed.

And by this writing we\ntold Major KfV^\/, Captaiu fi\/\/, ani y\\^]ov Maliracl^\nwhen Oliver Cromwell vio\\\\\\dL die, and when the King\nwould come int,\u00ae England 5 and all this was foretold\nfour years before it came to pafs, b.^lides we did\nforetell the particular day, when thefe changes\nwould be.\nIn the third place they fay^ that w? are maft efpe-\nK 4. cially\n\f15a ^fhe Temple\n(?\/\nWifdome.\nB\no o K\nI.\ndally to obferve what new Scars foeve fhall appears\nbecaiife that thefe do fore-(hew the grcjtcft Mutati-\nons\n:\nGod making ufe of thefe, in making up,\nby\nmeans of their Afpefts, and Conjundions, New\nLetters; whereby he either expreffeth unto us his\nwrath, or his mercy\n:\nas having determined with\nhimfelf, to chaftife us, if we continue in our fms\n;\nand to pardon us>\nif\nwe repent of them. Thus,\nbefore almoft all the greateft Mutations, that have\nhappened in the world, have fome ofthefe new ftars\nbeen obfcrved to appear; and they have been fuch\nStars too, as have been really found to be in the\nvery Heavens.

So that we fee, one only Letter,\nas an L, or an R, utterly changeth the whole Senfe.\nIn the fame manner is it with the Stars 5 where a new\nStar added , varieth both the writing, and the\nfenfc.\n!n the fourth place, that we may be able perfeA-\nly\n\f154 Tie Temple ^fWifdome.

And in this fenfe, it\nwill not be any hard matter to apprehend the mea-\nning oi Cardan^ when he faies, (peaking of the Star\nin theTaiioft\/y\/^A\/^jor, that it hath forefliewed\nthe changes of all the Great Empires : underftan-\nding this to be the fenfe of this Truth, delivered by\nCardan ; that, according to the Doftrine here laid\ndown, this Star, though not Alone, and by it fclf,\nyetjoyned with others, hath fhewedthefe changes;\ntnaking up, by their Conjunction, fuch Entire\nwords, as did forc-fticw the fall, or rife of thcfe Em-\npires, either clearly, and plainly ; or elfe perhaps,\nmore fecretly, and Myftically, as we (hall (hew here-\nafter. Now, as in all forts of Writing, there is one\ncertain Letter, both in Nounes and Verbs^ which i^\nmore frequent then any other, and hath the Pre-\nminence throughout all thefeveral CoHJugatiom^ and\nVecknfions *, in the like manner in this Celejlialwri*\nting^ it hath been obferved, that in all the Mutati-\nons of Empires, this Star, in the Taile of the afore-\nfaid Conftcllation, hath been more eminently noted\nthen any other : Either becaufe it is more frequent,\nin the difcourfeof Monarchies, then any ottier : Or\nelfe, that it is as the Capital letter, in the moft figni-\nficacive words j as we fee there is in all proper\nNames, of almoflall the languages in the World :\nas for example, in the nameof Ho'^<?>i,the firft letter\nig greater, then any of the reft that follow. And\nthus may we anfwer this queftion, which fome may\nhappily make; namely. Why, in this Ccleftial wri-\nting, there are both little, and great Stars alfo ?

And\nby\nthis means may we\nbe able to give\na\nReafon of that, which hath been\nhitherto Unknown\n:\nas, when the Aftrologers affirm,\nthat when Caput Algol^ or Medufa's Head,\nwas Vertical to Greece\n5\nthe ftars did fore- with\n*\n*\nftiew tl\\e Calamities, which afterwards\n*\nhappened unto it, by theTyranny of the\n*\n*\nMahometans\n;\nwithout giving us any Rea-\n*\n*\nfon why\n:\nno more then they do of their In tbeFigure\nConfidence^ in aCTq ring us, that the fame\nConftellation, which will in\na\nftiort time beVer*\ntical to France alfo, fore-fhews\na\nftranqe Dcfolation,\nthat\nis\nto fall upon that Country.

Gulielmus Panfienfu utterly denies\nthefe ftorics to be true; as indeed they are raeerly\nFabulous ; neither do I believe thefe is any one of\nthem chat hath any truth in it. If it be returned\niipon us, that there is nothing in them, but a man\nnray believe, fmce polTibly they might be true : I\nanfvver, that many things might have been, which\nheveryet have been : as, forinflance, there might\nhave been more iSans, and more Worlds then\none.\nThe fifth Objeftlon is,that it is necefiary that Na-\ntural Agents fnould.,. fome way or other, touch the\nthing they are to Operate upon: but a Figure,\nvvhich cureththe itone, Chollick, or anyother dif-\n^afe^touchcch not at all the Part ijfFefted, theVertue\nof it therefore cannot be'Nattnal.\nThe anfwer to this Ob'ec^ion is fo eafie, that,\nwithout troubling our felves to* reckon up, with\n\"S^oxisi^ the icYcral Wi^rss of loucking^ we Deed no\n*\nmore\n\fB o o K i. < Ae Temple of Wifdome. 26%\nmore but give an iiiftance in a Hot BricJ^. For as a\nBricke receives heat from the Fire5Wichout touching\neither Cole, or r lame ; in like manner doth an l-\nmage receive the influence of the Stars, without\ntouching an Part of the Heavens.\n^\nIn a word, all\nthe touching which is here found, is only a Virtual\ntouching 3 as we fee in the Sun, which, doth never-\nthelefs warm it by its Vertue. And as a Bricke,hea-\ntedeitherby theSun, orbyFire, doth afterwards\noperate upon any other body, cummunicatingits\nVertue to it, if it be applied unto it : in the fame\nmanner doth a Figure or Image operate upon ano-\nther body, communicating the influences, which it\nhath received from the Stars unto it, if it be in like\nmanner applyed, either by a Corporeal, or by a\n\\wrtual touching only. 1 fhall not here produce\nthe Miraculous operation of the IVeapon falve^vfhich\ncures a wound, at a hundred Leagues diftance\u00bb ifit\nbe but apphed to the Weapon that made it j and\nthat you drefs it, as you would do the Wounded\nPerfon ; as it is proved by Sr. Kenelme Vighy. If I\nihould have madeufe of this Example, I (hould ne-\nver have been quiet from having it thrown in my\nTeeth, that the Operation o( this Magnetical Vh-\ng\u00abf\u00abr isSupcrftitious and Diabolical. This is the\nwhole burden of the Ignorant Rabble, who impute,\nwhatever they find to carry wonder with it, to the\noperation ofevil fpirits : and yet I have been afliirei\nby Dr.Turner a Phyfitian, that this very operation\nwas Natural 5 and that himfelf had made ufe of it,\nwith good fuccefs, and on a very ^ood man. Now\nifour Nativity Merchants deny, that the operation\nof a leUfmatical Image, which is buried under\nground, can be Natural j becaufe that it is kept in\nbytheEarth, which coversit : hemayas well con-\n-\n'\nelude.\n\f266 The Temple ^\/ Wifdome.

So true it\nis,\nthat there\nis\nnothing more po-\nwerful, then the influences of the ftars, when they\nhave once made an imprcflion upon things here be-\nlow.\nThe fixth Objeftion ftrikcs at the power,which we\nhave attributed to refemblance: for, there\nis\nnot\nany where ffay our Scar Men)\na\nnearer Tye and\nCorrefpondence, then in the Love of\na\nMother and\nher Child\n;\nand yet\nif\na\nMother drown her felfe,the\nChild will notprefently do fo too; and fo he con-\ncludes\n:\n^anto minus igitur in tarn diverfisy utfunt\nImago & Imaginatum^ nulla ligaturaj inter eaerity qu\u00a3\ncogaty ut quod fxtituf ImagOy ^atiatur & Imagina\"\nturn.\nI\nknow very well, that this Author makes ufe ctf\nArgument againft NeUanabo\n:\nbut feeing that he\nbrings\nit\nalfo againft Telefmatical Images\n;\n[\nanfwer,\nthat thefe Images (as we have already faid) have no\npowerat all over our Wills.

And even in\nour daycs, Wc have heard of two young Children,\nwhich were Brothers, at VenOton^ an EpJlcopal City\ninltaly^ who by reafon of their being fo perfefilj\nlike one another, if one of them werefick, theo-\n^her was fo too : as, for example, if one began to\nhave a Pain in the Head, the other would prefently\n. feel it : If one of them were a {leep,or fad , the other\ncould tiot hold up his head, or be merry : and fo of\nthe reft, as I have been aifured by Collonel Kove\/\na very honeft man, and a Gentleman of the fame\nCity.\nThe fevcnth Objc6i:ion, brought by the Athiefts^\nis, that ifat any time thefe lelefmatical ftones have\nbeen known to cure the bitings of ^Serpents, and the\nflinging of iJcorpions; this cifeft proceeded not at\nall from the ftars, but from fomc feci-et Properties\nin the ftone, whereon the Figure of a .Scorpion, or\nSerpent, was graved.\nThisObjeftionis anfwered in two words. I fay\nthen, that we have already proved, that the ftars\nhave power to communicate this vertue to the ftone;\nand alfo, that it is not at all Natural to\nit,\nand pro-\nceeding from its own proper vertue\n:\nbecaufe that,\nbefore\nit\nwas figured and prepared under certain\nConftellations,\nit\nhad no fuch Vertue at all.

So that there\nis\nnothing wanting now, to the full Vindication of\nthem from falfhood, and all other Caluminies, by\nAthielU.\nThe laft Obie^^ion\nis\nindeed the moft difficult of\nall the reft\n;\nfeeins; that the Vcrtue, which we find\nImprinted in\na\nlelefman^ feemes to furpafs the po-\nwer of Nature. Neverthelefs we are able to make\nit\nappear, that there\nis\nnothing Extraordinary in it,\nby niftancing in the Load-ftone; which having\ncommunicated it's Vertue to apiece of Iron, this\npicceof Iron communicates\nit\nafterwards to ano-\nther, in drawing\nit\nto\nit\nfelf, and retaining it. In\nlike manner may\na\n7elefmatical figure communicate\nit's vertue to another figure, which (hall have recei-\nved impreflion from\nit\n5\nwhich (hall afterwards have\nthe power to work the fame effefts; only the diffe-\nrence\nis,\nwe can give\na\nReafon of this later, though\nnot of the former.

As, for example, to fend Newcs to our\nfriends, inlefsthenan hours fpace, above an hun-\ndred Leagues off: 2iSlrhheinm Abbas^ zndBanhoU^\nmy Cordelier^ and after him Kobert Fludy have under-\ntaken to do. To do fuch Miraculous things, by the\nhelp of Looking-glafles, as we would think to be ut-\nterly impolfible ; fuch as were thofe ftrange opera-\ntions, which Kohert Bacon undertook to do in the\nnumber Nine ; by which he promifed the Pope,\nthat ifhe would furnifh him with fuch a Summe of\nMoney^as the charge of making them would require\nhe (hould be able to annoy the lurk^s more by thefe\nGlafTer, then by an Army of a hundred thoufand\nMen. Briefly, if Arijktle had not informed us,that\nthe Image in the Aire which infeparably followed a\ncertain man, fo that he could never be rid of it,\nwas\nNatural\n:\nwould\nit\nnot prefently have been conclu-\nded, that\nit\nwasfome famili^fpirit,orfome Vernon,\nthat took upon\nit\nthe Figure of this Man? And yet\nneverthelefs, this was only the effed of the Man's\nownweaknefs offight\n;\nwhich being unable to pe-\nnetrate the Medium of the Aire, it's beameswerc\nreverberated, in like manner as in\na\nLooking-glafs\n;\nfo that, when ever his Eyes were open, he ftiil faw\nhis own Image in the Aire. Which makes me to be\nof their opinion, who indcavour to vindicate the\nAncients, from the Imputation of Magick, and to\nthink that the Works which they did, and which\narc commonly accounted Diabolical, proceeded\nmeerly\n\f^'O T^Ae Temple ^\/Wifdome.

Hence feme think that\nit is (poken, that man is not created limply the Image of\nGod, but after the Image, or the Image of the Image\nof God ; therefore he is called Viicrocofm ; that is,the\nleiTer World. The World is a rational Creature, Ini^\nmortal; Man in like manner Is rational, but m^ortal;\nthat is 5 diflolvable and fubjeft to paffions ; and there-\nfore may be benefited by this Book, and the Science\nherein taught : For (as Sir Chriftopber Hey don faith) fee-\ning the world it felf is immortal, it is impollible that any\npart of it can perifh.

Therefore it was\nneccflary that the minde of man thus fcaled by the\nWord of God, fhould put on alfo tire corporeal rran,\nafter the moil complcat example of the world: There-\nfore man is called the other world, and the other Image\nofGod, becaufehehath in himfelf all that iscontainecf\nin the greater world ; fo that there rcmaineth nothing\nwhich is not found even truly and really in ma:n himfelf ;\nind all thefe things do perform the famJe duties in him,\nas in the great world : There are in him the four Ele-\nments, with the nioft true properties of their nature 2\nAnd in him an Etherial Body, the Chariot of the Souijiri\nproportion correfponding to the Heaven : There are\nin him the vegetive life ot PlantSjtheSenfes ofAnfnialsjof\nCeleftial Spirits, the Angelical Reafon^ and the Divine\nllnderftanding, and the true Conjunflion, and Divine\n^^\u2022pofleiTion of all thefe things flowing- together into one,\n'Hence in facred Letters man is called every Creature ^\nand not onely ir.an, being made anoti.er world, doth\ncomprehend all the parts thereof in himfelfj but alfo\ndoth receive and contain even God himfelf.
