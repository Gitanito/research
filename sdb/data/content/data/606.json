W. Mitchell, M.D.\nAs I looked over the names of former Presidents of The\nSociety for Psychical Research, I could not help wondering\nwhat considerations had induced the Council to ask me\nto fill this important office, and I could not help fearing\nthat I possessed no qualifications which would justify my\nacceptance of so great an honour. Along with these\nthoughts there came to my mind the recollection of a\nscene in one of Marion Crawford's novels which I had\nread many years ago. In this scene Ram Lai, a Brahmin\nby birth, a Buddhist by adopted religion and an adept\nby profession, is asked if he thinks the heroine will recover\nfrom the jungle fever which threatens her life. He\nreplies :\n\" No. She will die at sundown.\" \" But how do\nyou know, since you are no prophet ?\n\" \" Because I am\na doctor of medicine, M.D. of Edinburgh.\"\nIn the fact that I, also, am \" a doctor of medicine,\nM.D. of Edinburgh \" I thought I had found one reason\nwhy our Council's choice had fallen upon me, and I was\nA\n\f8 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nalso bold enough to think that I had found some justifi-\ncation for my temerity in accepting their decision. For\nthis is the first time in the history of the Society that its\nPresidentship has been conferred on a practising member\nof the medical profession. It is^ true that some of my\npredecessors in this chair have held medical degrees, and\nthat at least one of them\u2014Professor M\"^Dougall\u2014was for\nsome years actively engaged in the treatment of the war\nneuroses ; but the lifework of these distinguished men\nlay in other paths, and their appointment as Presidents\nof this Society was based upon qualifications other than\nthose related to their knowledge of the science and art\nof medicine.\nBut although the medical profession has not hitherto\nbeen represented in the list of Presidents there have\nalways been some medical men among our Members and\nAssociates, and from the earliest days of the Society's\nwork there have been medical members on the Council.\nIt would, indeed, have been strange if in our own time\nthe profession of medicine had lost all interest in the\ninvestigation of so-called occtdt phenomena, for from the\nbeginnings of history the exponents of the art of heahng\nhave, perhaps more than any other class of men, been in\nclosest contact with all that is dark and mysterious in\nthe life of humanity.\nBefore any distinction had arisen between priest and\nphysician the \" medicine man \" was healer, sorcerer and\nseer, soothsayer, interpreter^ of dreams and caster-out of\ndevils. In North America, we are told, the medicine\nmen \" are valued as dignitaries in the tribe, and the\ngreatest respect is paid to them by the whole community ;\nnot only for their skill in their materia medica, but more\nexpecially for their tact in magic and mysteries in which\nthey all deal to a very great extent.\" The savage\ncozisiders ill-health to be due to some supernatural agency\n\u2014\" to sorcery, to the violation of a taboo, to the wrath\nof an offended ghost \" ; and the medicine man is one\nwho, in virtue of his knowledge of the supernatural and\nhis possession of magical powers, is able to combat the\noccult influences which cause disease.\n\fLXXXV.] Presidential Address. 3\nThe medicine man of primitive peoples was thus an\nobserver of those occult happenings and a possessor of\nthose supernormal powers, belief in which, though disjoined\nfrom the practice of medicine since medicine aspired to\nbe a science, has persisted through the ages in folk-lore\nand tradition, until, in\" the end, the validity of such\nbeliefs has become a subject of investigation by the\nmethods of science\u2014that very discipline whose beginnings\nbecame possible only when occult causes of natural pheno-\nmena were denied and rejected.\nIf we try to tell how modern medicine has arisen from\nthe therapeutic practices of primitive peoples, a great gap\nin our knowledge must be admitted. The scientific\nmedicine of to-day has a more or less uninterrupted\nhistory which we can trace back to Greek medicine in\nthe fifth century B.C. ; but beyond that all is darkness.\nThe transition from the highest development of thought\nin savage races to the beginnings of Greek culture forms\nan almost blank page in the history of mental evolution ;\nbut it is probable that progress from the practice of the\nMagic Art to the practice of scientific medicine has taken\nplace by way of religion, and the priest-physician of early\nEgyptian and European civilizaMon may be regarded as\nthe connecting link between the medicine man as magician\nand the physician of to-day.\nWhen primitive man came to reahze that his power\nover the forces of nature was limited and that magical\npractices had not the infallible success which their earliest\nvotaries had claimed for them, his tendency was^ to ascribe\nto supernatural beings those powers * against .^Vhich the\nmagic art waa of no avail ; and so, instead of com-\nmanding the elements to obey his behests, instead of\nfighting the evil spirits in his own unaided strength, he\nnow, by prayer and sacrifice, endeavoured to propitiate the\ngods and constrain them to assist him in repelling the\npowers that were inimical to the well-being of his tribe.\nReligious ritual thus came to take the place of magi, al\ndevices, and in the treatment of disease the role of the\nmedicine man became merged in that of the priest. But\nnot all the magicians submitted to the domination of the\n\f4 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PART\ngods and, although the pious or enlightened may have\ninclined that way, the evilly disposed continued their\nmagical practices for their own ends so that, as the \" black\nart,\" magic persisted alongside of religion up to the dawn\nof the scientific era.\nScience, in medicine, is sometimes supposed to have\nbeen the offspring of common-sense and to have developed\napart from, and in opposition to, the mysticism of magic\nand the ritual of religion ; but it is not difficult to trace\nthe influence of religion in the art of medicine as it is\npractised to-day, or to recognize its science as a lineal\ndescendant of the beliefs of the magicians, the alchemists,\nand the astrologers of mediaeval times.\nThere are some grounds for believing that the birth of\nscientific thought took place among the Greeks in the\nseventh century B.C. ;\nand, in so far as the history of\nmedicine is concerned, the thought tendencies of this age\nare revealed in writings attributed to Hippocrates which\nbelong to a period two hundred years later. In his\ntreatise on The Sacred or Mysterious Disease, Hippocrates\ndiscussed the relations between magic and medicine and\ndeprecated the seeking of occult causes and the use of\nmagical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of disease.\nHe recognized that disease is a process which has a natural\nhistory, that its cause is to be fovmd in the natural world,\nand that its course can be ascertained by careful observa-\ntion of the phenomena which it presents.\nThe Hippocratic method of studying disease has always\nbeen the ideal towards which medicine, as a science, has\naspired ; but for a long period in the history of the art\nit was lost sight of and no real progress was made.\nThroughout the Middle Ages, when the monasteries were\nthe sole custodians of learning, a mass of dogma and\nsuperstition became superimposed upon the Hippocratic\nteaching, and not until the Renaissance was there a return\nto the fountain-head whence all medical knowledge had\ncome, and a consequent return to the beginnings of\nscientific method.\nThroughout the course of medical history the tendency\nhas ever been to produce some complete system, based\n\fLXXXV.] Presidential Address. 5\non fundamental theoretical principles, under which all the\nmultifarious phenomena of disease can be subsumed.\nMetaphysics, chemistry, mechanics, and mathematics, each\nin turn, have been made the basis of such systems of\nmedicine ; and throughout the ages the constant need has\nbeen that men should get back from their formal systems\nand theoretical explanations to the study of nature\u2014that\nthey should become emancipated from the trammels of\ndogma as well as from the errors of superstition and bring\nthemselves to study the phenomena of disease, its causes,\nits course and its cure, as these present themselves to\nobservation in the actual practice of the healing art.\nThis was the lesson of Hippocrates ; this was the lesson\nof Sydenham ; this is the lesson of every great clinical\nteacher of to-day.\nIn the practice of medicine this lesson has been surely,\nif slowlj', learnt ; but many of those who are most\ninsistent on the apj)lication of scientific method to the\nstudy of disease are still in bondage to old dogmas and\nsuperstitions when they approach such problems as those\nwith which this Society has to deal. This is true, even\nin regard to the study of disease, whenever the modes of\ninvestigation or the means of treatment have any semblance\nto the ancient practices of the magician or the priest.\nThe history of psychotherapeutics affords plentiful illus-\ntrations in siipport of this statement. The laboratory\nW'Orkers in the mechcal sciences are perhaps more in\nthrall to materialistic dogma than are those who are\nengaged in the actual practice of medicine ; for these\nlatter, by keeping closer contact Avith human life and its\nproblems, are less prone to rest satisfied in the belief that\nthe findings of a purely mechanistic science are adequate\nto the explanation of man's whole being, or that there\nare no forces in the universe that cannot be fitted into\nthe scheme of things which such a science portxays.\nEvery great advance in knowledge, every successful\neffort to get away from the paralysing influence of tradi-\ntion, has been due to some outstanding personality, bold\nenough to flout authority or vain enough to treat the\ncriticism of contemporaries with scorn or with indifference.\na2\n\f6 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nMany examples from the history of science might be cited\nin support of this statement ; but here it will suffice if\nwe call to mind the names of some of those men whose\nwork forms links in the chain which connects the practice-\nof medicine with the investigations of Psychical Research.\nIn tracing the history of the relations between medicine\nand occultism in Europe since the revival of learning, we\nmeet with the names of three men whose views have had\na noteworthy influence on the course of certain branches\nof medical theory and practice :\n\u2014Paracelsus, Van Helmont\nand Mesmer ;\nand, in more recent times, we find some\nof the mystical conceptions of these writers subjected to\nthe critical methods of modern science by Braid and\nLiebeault, Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. All these\nmen were innovators, apostates from the orthodoxy of\ntheir times, and they suffered the discredit and abuse\nwhich are always incurred by those who break away from\nthe worship of the idols of the tribe.\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century, when Para-\ncelsus\u2014a man half mountebank and half genius\u2014delivered\na course of lectures at the University of Basel, the energies\nof the medical world were being spent in fierce disputes\nconcerning the relative merits of Arabian and Greek\nmedicine, and the injunction of Hippocrates to study\ndisease at first hand, by actual observation of its pheno-\nmena, was largely forgotten. Paracelsus scorned all\nscholastic disputation ; he said that his shoe -buckles\nwere more learned than either Avicenna or Galen ; he\nre-affirmed the teaching of Hippocrates that the physician\nmust get back to the study of nature : and he declared\nthat the life of man cannot be divorced from that of the\nuniverse as a whole. But he was so much imbued with\nthe importance of the influence of the greater world\nwithout upon the lesser world within, that he gave up\nthe study of anatomy for the study of the stars.\nHe believed that all things in the universe act upon;\none another by means of some indwelling essence which\nforms an invisible link between them, and that, conse-\nquently, the life and mind of man may be influenced by\nthe course of the stars, as well as by his immediate\n\fLXXXV.] Presidenfial Address. 7\nsurroundings and the thoughts and desires of his fellows.\nThis is the notion which lies at the back of all sympa-\nthetic magic, of the sympathetic system of medicine, of\nAnimal Magnetism and of spiritistic phenomena.\nThe sympathetic or magnetic system implicit in the\nteaching of Paracelsus was given more formal expression\nin the writings of Van Helmont in the seventeenth century.\nVan Helmont was one of those men whose work, though\ndiscredited in their own time, proves later to have been\nof great significance in the history of thought. Holding\non with one hand to the mysticism of the middle ages,,\nreaching forward with the other to the new learning and\nthe new methods which had already borne fruit in the\nworks of Bacon, Harvey and Galileo, Van Helmont holds\na unique place in the evolution of modern medicine and\nof those phases of thought which have led up to present-\nday psychotherapeutics on the one hand and to Psychical\nResearch on the other.\nBoth Paracelsus and Van Helmont believed that all the\nvital activities of the body are controlled by an indwelling\nspirit or Archeus, and for them the sympathetic system of\nhealing was essentially a spiritual affair ; but when Mesmer,\nmore than a century later, sought to re-establish the\nmagnetic philosophy of his predecessors, he attributed\nsympathetic healing to the action of a purely physical\nforce which he termed Animal Magnetism. This force, he\nsaid, became effective in the treatment of disease through\nthe medium of some fluid emanation which passed from\nthe magnetist to the patient in the process of magnetizing.\nHowever unwarranted Mesmer's insistence on the truth\nof his theory may have been, his demonstration of the\nactuality of the phenomena on which it was based, and\nto explain which it was put forward, had the noteworthy\neffect of compelling medical men to examine the part\nplayed in the treatment of disease by those so-called\noccult causes\u2014charms, amulets, incantations and such\ndevices\u2014whose use had been proscribed by the Father of\nMedicine and denounced by his faithful followers through-\nout the centuries.\nThe conclusions arrived at by the various commissions\n\f8 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nappointed to investigate the claims of the Animal Magne-\ntists afford striking proof of the power of preconceptions\nand prejudice to banish reason from men's minds and to\nrender them incapable of making exact observations, or\nof forming sound judgments concerning what they have\nobserved. In the matter, for instance, of the profound\ninsensibility to pain which the magnetists were sometimes\nable to produce, sceptics and believers alike were obsessed\nby the notion that there were but two possible explana-\ntions of the phenomenon\u2014it must have been due either\nto fraud or to the magnetic fluid. The sceptics main-\ntained that there was no siach fluid and that the declara-\ntion of insensibility hy the patient must therefore have\nbeen false and the absence of all signs of pain a fraudu-\nlent pretence. The believers pointed to the facts which\nshowed the insensibility to be genuine and concluded that\nit miist therefore have been due to the fluid. A similar\ntendency may be found to-day in the attitude of many\npeople towards the problems of Psychical Research. The\nphenomena of mediumistic trance, for example, are some-\ntimes ascribed to fraud, sometimes to spirits ; and it\nseems difficult for some people to realize that here, just\nas in the case of Animal Magnetism, the phenomena may\nbe genuine although neither of the proposed explanations\nbe the true one.\nIn thus comparing the investigation of Animal Magne-\ntism with that of mediumistic trance, we have something\nmore than a mere analogy or historical parallel ; there is\nalso historical continuity. For the peculiar characteristics\nof mediumistic trance\u2014for example, the apparently super-\nnormal acquisition of knowledge\u2014were frequently noticed\nin the trance which sometimes occurred in the practice\nof Animal Magnetism. Indeed, the extravagance of the\nclaims put forward by the Magnetists, respecting the\nsupernormal powers exhibited by their entranced patients,\nwas one of the main reasons why men of science were so\neager to repudiate all interest or belief in the doctrines\nor the practice of Animal Magnetism. And when, through\nthe work oi Braid, doubt of the reality of the so-called\nmagnetic trance could no longer honestly be maintained,\n\fLXXXV.J Presidential Address. 9\nthose less well authenticated manifestations\u2014the so-called\n\"higher phenomena\" of Mesmerism\u2014^to which the findings of\nthe hypnotists lent little or no support were taken over by the\nnew sect of Spiritualists which arose in Europe in the middle\nof the nineteenth century, and they played no further part\nin the development of the scientific aspects of psycho-\ntherapeutics and psychopathology.\nAlong this latter line erf investigation we can trace\ndirect continuity between the mystical doctrines of the\nMiddle Ages and the most modern conceptions in mental\nscience. There is no real break in the history of psycho-\ntherapeutics from Paracelsus to Mesmer, or from Mesmer\nto Freud. The magnetic trance is identical with hypnotic\ntrance ;\nhypnotic trance is indistinguishable from hysterical\ntrance ;\nhysterical trance, in all its main features, is the\nsame as mediumistic trance. Medical psychology has its\nroots in the study of trance states, and by employing its\nconceptions in the investigation of mediumistic trance we\nrescue the higher phenomena of Mesmerism from exploita-\ntion in the service of reHgious beliefs, and bring them\nunder the scrutiny of science by making all examination\nof them conform to the principles of scientific method.\nThe most characteristic feature of mediumistic trance\n\u2014\na feature which provides, as I believe, the most important\nproblem in the field of Psychical Research\u2014is the\noccasional display by the medium of knowledge which,\nso far as we can see, must have been acquired in some\nsupernormal manner. Few people who have carefully\nstudied the records of our Society, and perhaps no one\nwho has had \" good sittings \" with such a medium as\nMrs. Piper or Mrs. Leonard, can remain long in doubt\nconcerning the occasional occurrence of happenings which,\nwhatever be their true explanation, must assuredly be\ndescribed as supernormal. I cannot speak of what are\nknown as the physical phenomena of spiritism, for of these\nI have no experience and little knowledge ; but on the\npurely psychological side it seems to me indubitable that\nacquisition of knowledge, otherwise than through the\nordinary channels of sense, has been demonstrated over\nand over again in mediumistic trance.\n\f10 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [PART\nIf SO much be admitted, three main problems present\nthemselves for consideration :\n(1) Under what conditions\nand in what ways is knowledge supemormally acquired ?\n(2) In what circumstances and through Avhat mechanisms\nis such knowledge displayed ? (3) What is the source from\nwhich such knowledge comes 1\n(1) We do not know what the conditions may be under\nwhich the supernormal acquisition of knowledge takes\nplace ; that is to say, we do not know when, or in what\ncircumstances, such knowledge enters the mind which is\nfound to possess it. Two main hypotheses have been put\nforward in explanation of the ways in which knowledge\nmay be acquired in a supernormal manner, namely,\ntelepathy and clairvoyance. The former term is applied\nto the supernormal acquisition of knowledge from other\nminds ; the latter to knowledge of things or events in\nthe physical world not acquired telepathically, but never-\ntheless acquired otherwise than through the ordinary\nchannels of sense.\nThe evidence in support of the telepathic hypothesis\nis, taken as a whole, great in amount and of good quality ;\nbut it cannot be denied that purely experimental proof\nof the occurrence of telepathy is regrettably scanty. In\nview of the paramount importance of establishing irre-\nfutably the occurrence of telepathy as a fact of nature,\nif fact of nature it be, it must be maintained that there\nis no form of investigation open to all students of\nPsychical Research which is more urgently needed, and\nnone which, if positive results are obtained, will better\nrepay the labour expended on it, than experiments on\nthought transference. This need is, I am aware, not\nfelt by many who regard telepathy as already an estab-\nlished truth ; but the widespread and persistent denial\nof its occurreiKje by men of science would seem to indicate\nthat the experimental evidence is not yet sufficient, in\nquantity or in quality, to overcome their doubts.\nIt seems to me that the exhibition of knowledge which\nmust have been acquired in some supernormal manner is\nthe distinctive characteristic of those mediumistic pheno-\nmena which challenge the criticism of materialistic science.\n\fIXXXV.] Presidential Address. 11\nThe question of the source of such knowledge is here\nirrelevant. Whether or not human knowledge is ever\nacquired otherwise than through some kind of physical\nmedium, such as the ordinary channels of sense, is the\nreal frontier line on which the battle between dogmatic\nmaterialism and Psychical Research must be fought ; for\nan irrefutable demonstration that the mind can obtain\nknowledge of events in the outside world, or of thoughts\nand feelings in other minds, in ways unmediated by\nphysical things, must shatter for ever the pretensions of\nthose who are contemptuous of Psychical Research, and\nwould open to their vision the infinite possibilities attend-\ning further inquiry concerning man's true nature and being.\nAnd science could no longer be denied the right of\n\u2022overstepping the bounds beyond which physical laws may\nappear to be inoperable, but would rather be constrained\nto bring its principles and its methods to the investigation\nof those phenomena whose occurrence it has hitherto so\npersistently denied.\nThe evidence for clairvoyance is far less convincing than\nthat which may be adduced in support of telepathy, and\nmuch of it belongs to the past. Good contemporary\n\u2022evidence is very scanty, although certain recent investi-\ngations do point to the possibility that supernormal\nfaculty of this kind may sometimes be at work. But\nsince the far-reaching possibilities of telepathy have come\nto be realized it has been more and more difficult to feel\nsure that any instance of supernormal acquisition of\nknowledge necessitates the hypothesis of clairvoyance ;\nfor of whatever nature the thing known may be, it is\nalmost impossible to ensure that knowledge of it is not\npossessed by some other mind, and, if such knowledge\ndoes exist in any other mind, whether incarnate or dis-\ncarnate, telepathy may be the means through which the\nmedium becomes aware of it.\n(2) The display of supernormally acquired knowledge is\nmost commonly observed in states of mental dissociation\nwhich lead to the production of automatic writing or\nother forms of motor or sensory automatism, and pre-\neminently in the state known as mediumistic trance. We\n\f12 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nknow a good deal about the mechanisiiLS through which\nsupernormal knowledge is displayed, and it is here, perhaps,\nthat medical psychology has made its chief contribution\nto Psychical Research. In the phenomena of mediumistie\ntrance the student of medicine finds that the mechanisms\nthrough which supernormally acquired knowledge is most\ncommonly manifested are identical with those met with\nin psychopathic states.\n(3) To many people the all-absorbing question concerning\nknowledge that has been supernormallj^ acquired centres\nin the problem of the source from which such knowledge\ncomes. In clairvoyance, if it be true clairvoyance (and\nif clairvoyance be true), the source is the external world,\nand the mechanism of acquisition is a supernormal faculty\nof the human organism ; but when knowledge is acquired\ntelepathically (if it ever is so acquired), the question often\narises whether the mind from which the knowledge is\nobtained is incarnate or discarnate. Such a question can\noccur only to those who are disposed to believe, or who\nhave been forced \\>\\ the evidence to believe, in the\nexistence of discarnate minds or spirits ;\nand, in order tO'\ndiscuss the spirit hypothesis at all, we must, for the\nmoment, be willing to assume that discarnate minds or\nspirits do really exist.\nIf we further assume that in mediumistie trance com-\nmunications from discarnate minds may be received, we\nmust suppose that when the communicating spirit purports\nto be that of someone well known to us during his life\nin the bodj', it should be possible to obtain some proof\nof the identity thus claimed. And, indeed, the search\nfor proofs of spirit identity has become the all-important\nquestion for those who are engaged in the more advanced\ninvestigations of Psychical Research.\nPutting on one side, for the moment, this question of\nthe identity of the communicating spirit, we may call\nto mind that this is not the only way in which the\nspirit hypothesis enters into the phenomena of medium-\nistie trance. The secondary personality\u2014commonly called\nthe \" control\n\"'\n\u2014which, during the trance, takes possession\nof the medium's body, declares that it is itself a spirit\n\fLXXXV.J Presidential Address. 13\nwhich acts as an intermediary or interpreter between the\nsitter and the communicator proper ; and many who accept\nthe spirit hypothesis, in explanation of the source of\nmediumistio communications, maintain that tlie \"\ncontrol\n'\nof mediumistic trance is no mere dissociated portion of\nthe medium's mind, but an alien spirit which, in the course\nof mediumistic development, has attained the power of in-\nvading and controlling the medium's body during the trance-\nFinally, it may be recalled that in some rare cases it\nis alleged that during the trance the ordinary '\ncontrol\n'\nof the medium is ousted or retires and is supplanted by\nthe communicating spirit. This is the phenomenon of\nso-called Personal Control.\"\nI have referred to these commonplaces of Psychical\nResearch for the purpose of drawing j'our attention to\nsome considerations respecting them which are suggested\nby investigations carried out in the field of medical\npsychology\u2014a field which, up till now, has been all too\nlittle cultivated, but which has already made important\ncontributions to general psychology and to Psychical\nResearch.\nThere are three main sources of the knowledge, derived\nfrom medical psychology, which throws light on the\nphenomena of mediumistic trance : hypnosis, hysterical\nsomnambulism, and multiple personality. The importance\nof what can be learned from hypnotic trance, i.e. ordinary\ndeep hypnosis or hypnotic somnambulism, must not be\nunderestimated. It is in some respects the most important\nof all, because it lends itseH so readily to experimental\ninvestigation. Hypnotic somnambulism is an artificially\ninduced mental dissociation of the same kind as that\nwhich occurs spontaneously in hysterical somnambulism,\nin co-conscious multiple personality, and in mediumistic\ntrance. It is a form or level of consciousness which may\nbe made to alternate with the waking state and has this\npeculiarity : that in the hypnotic state there is recollection,\nactual or potential, of all the events of waking life, whilst\nin the waking state there is no recollection of the hypnotic\nphase.\nThere is a considerable amount of evidence in support\n\f14 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nof the belief that hypnotic states are sometimes accom-\npanied by a display of what appear to be supernormal\npowers, such as thought transference and clairvoyance ;\nbut most of this evidence dates back to the days of the\nMesmerists and its value is not now easily appraised.\nYet something suggestive of supernormal powers may be\ndiscerned, even in the work of modern hypnotists, many\nof whom have perhaps been prevented from looking for\nthe higher phenomena \" of Mesmerism by a priori dis-\nbelief in the possibility of their occurrence. Perhaps the\nmost striking examples of this are to be foiuid in those\nexperiments on \" Appreciation of Time by Somnambules,\"\ncarried ovit by Gurney, Delboeuf, Milne BramAvell and\nmyself, which have been recorded in our Proceedings.\nQuite apart from such phenomena as clairvoyance, tele-\npathy, or post-hypnotic appreciation of time, it may be\nlield that the effects of hj^notic suggestion on the vital\nfunctions have, in themselves, something of a supernormal\ncharacter, inasmuch as we have no knowledge whatsoever\nof how these effects are brought about.\nHysterical somnambulism has little to distinguish it\nfrom hypnotic somnambulism except its spontaneous onset ;\nand here also the beginnings of supernormal powers may\nsometimes be discerned. Traces of what appears to be\ntelepathic or clairvoyant faculty are not infrequently met\nwith in grave hysteria ; but here, as in the study of\nhypnotism, medical men seem reluctant to show much\ninterest in so unorthodox a symptom. In hysterical\nsomnambulism, as in hypnotic somnambulism, something\nakin to supernormal faculty is commonly displayed. The\nperfection of acting, in carrying out the somnambulic\ndream, has something of a supernormal quality and it\nmay be compared with the heightened power of dramatic\nimpersonation shown by the hypnotized subject when it\nis suggested to him that he is some well-known con-\ntemporary or historical character. In the increased\ncapacity for dramatic impersonation which is found in\nthese states of mental dissociation I am inclined to look\nfor the explanation of the mediumistic phenomenon of\n\" Personal Control.\"\n\ftxxxv.J PresidAntiail' Address. : - > v '\n; ; \/ 15\nEvidence pointing to the possession ; 'o? -.-Superiiormal\npowers becomes more prominent wlieu hysterical c!dsi-;oci-\nation assumes the form of well-marked double or multiple\npersonahty. In almost all the recorded cases some confir-\nmation of this statement may be found. It is true that\nthe evidence is hardly ever complete enough to be quite\nconvincing ; but the regular appearance of evidence of\nsome kind in these cases is highly suggestive, and\nprompts us to believe that there may be some true and\nnecessary connection between mental dissociation and the\nexhibition of supernormal powers.\nTo the medical psychologist it would seem that what\nlittle can be said about the supernormal acquisition of\nknowledge must be brought into relation with that mental\n\u2022dissociation Avhich is the most general cause or accompani-\nment of abnormal mental states. The mental chssociation\nin hypnotic or hysterical somnambulism is of the same\nnature, and due to the same causes, as that of the auto-\nmatic writer or the trance medium ; and whatever further\nquahfications or gifts such automatists or mediums may\npossess, they at least show mental dissociation and the\nautonomous activity of dissociated or secondary mental\nstates. The physiological and psychological processes\ninvolved in the production of automatic script are the\nsame in kind, whether the content of the writing reveals\nmerely the subliminal phantasies of the waiter, or conveys\nprecise information about matters of which the writer\nhas no normally acquired knowledge. So, also, the\ncontrols of mediumistic trance display the same peculiar-\nities as do the secondary personalities of hypnotic or\nhysterical dissociation.\nIn view of the fact that the more ordinary cases of\nmental dissociation not infrequently show traces of super-\nnormal faculty, it may be suspected that mental dis-\nsociation is an indispensable prerequisite for the exhibition\nof supemormally acquired knowledge ; and it may also\nbe that some degree of mental dissociation is necessary\nfor any knowledge to be so acquired. This conception\nis equally applicable whether we regard all display of\nsupernormal faculty as being merely a revelation of\n\f16 .\n\u2022. : < ?\n^'-^\nV ->..i T:-W: MitclieU, M.D. [part\nunguspocte4' .\npotentialities in the human organism, or as\nmanifestations of some influence emanating from a trans-\ncendental world.\nIt may be pointed out that some instinctive activities\nof the lower animals, such as the homing instinct of\npigeons or the migration of birds, would seem to us\nsupernormal if they were exhibited by a human being ;:\nbut, although in the course of evolution such instincts in\nman have become atrophied or overgrown, it is possible\nthat when a fault occurs in the structure of the human\nmind these older mental strata may be vmcovered and\ntheir functional activity released. Supernormal faculty\nwould then appear as a regression to phylogenetically\nolder functions, and telepathy or clairvoyance would be\nbut a human exploitation of means employed by our\nlowly progenitors in the conduct of their everyday life.\nOn the other hand, if supernormal acquisition of know-\nledge is ever due, as some people think, to the direct or\nindirect influence of discarnate minds, here also it may be\nsupposed that when a break occurs in the mental structure\nwhich has proved most fitted for survival in this world,\nsuch a break might offer the most likely condition for\ngetting into touch with another world, if another world\nthere be.\nSuch speculations are, however, far removed from the\nquestions which present themselves to the medical psy-\nchologist who has not yet subscribed to the scientific\nheresies of Psychical Research. He will doubt the actuality\nof any supernormal acquisition of knowledge whatsoever^\nand will endeavour to discover a natural explanation of\nthe existence in the medium's mind of any item of know-\nledge for which a supernormal origin may be claimed.\nThis is assuredly a legitimate ambition and is indeed the\nonly attitude which, to begin with, the psychologist can\nadopt ; and although hitherto little success has been\nachieved in this direction, the clinical psychologist of to-day\nmay feel that he is now better equipped for such an\ninquiry than were his predecessors.\nIt seems to me that Psychical Research must accept the\npathological nature of mediumistic manifestations, or at\n\fxxxxv.] Presidential Address. 17\nleast their complete parallelism with phenomena which are\nadmittedly psychopathic. Dreams, phantasies, illusions,\nautomatic writing, automatic speech, trance, secondary\npersonalities and self-styled spirit controls, are all familiar\nto students of psychopathology ;\nand, generally speaking,\nthere is found to be no need to call to our aid any\nhypothesis of supernormal agencies or powers in order to\naccount for the occurrence of these states, or the nature\nof the mental contents which they reveal. It is difficult\nto say how far this statement might have to be modified\nif a sharper look out were kept for those traces of\napparently supernormal phenomena which I believe to\nbe a not infrequent accompaniment of mental dissociation.\nBut the fact remains that, apart from the display of\nmore or less pronounced supernormal faculty, the mechan-\nisms of mediumistic trance and the mechanisms of certain\npsychopathic states are indistinguishable.\nThe most noteworthy addition in recent j^ears to the\nmeans of investigation open to psychologists has been the\npsycho-analytical technique devised by Professor Freud.\nThe profound change in our outlook on many problems\nof psychology, which has resulted from the discoveries of\npsycho-analysis, may lead us to hope that the application\nof this method to some of the jDroblems of Psychical\nResearch may have equally far-reaching consequences ;\nbut, unless psycho-analysis can solve the question of the\nsupernormal acquisition of knowledge, the problems peculiar\nto Psychical Research as distinguished from the problems\nin psychopathology which the mechanism of mediumistic\ncommunications may present, will remain as insistent, and\ntheir solutions as doubtful, as they are at the present\ntime.\nTaking psycho-analysis at its own vahiation as a method\nof investigating the mind and as a therapeutic measure,\nwe may ask : What would be the probable results of\nsubmitting a medium to a full psycho-analj'sis ? If this\nwere possible\u2014there are good grounds for believing it\nwould not be possible\u2014several consequences might be\nanticipated. If the naturahstic explanation of all trance\nphenomena be true, we should expect that the thorough\n\f18 T. W. Mitchell, 31. D. [part\nexamination of a medium's mind which psycho-analysis\nentails would reveal the natural origin of all knowledge\nwhich may seem to have been supernormally acquired ;\nand further, we should expect a re-association of the\ndissociated mental states, a redintegration of the medium's\nmind, which would preclude the possibility of his ever\nagain going into trance. The medium would be \" cured\n\"\nof his mediumship. If, however, as I am inclined to\nbelieve, the knowledge sometimes displayed in mediumistic\ntrance is knowledge acquired in some truly supernormal\nfashion, then, although the medium might be \" cured,\"\nand thereby lose the power of going into trance or of\nacquiring knowledge in a supernormal way, analysis would\nfail to find any trace of the source from which such\nknowledge had been derived, or of the ways in which it\nhad been obtained.\nIt is useless, however, to speculate on these matters\nat the present time. These are problems for the future,,\nand in the future they may receive the solutions which\nare hidden from us now. I refer to them because they\nform the latest phase of that conjunction of occultism and\nmedical science whose beginnings I have briefly sketched\nin the earlier part of this address. Psychical ResearcK\nhas always welcomed every form of investigation that\npromised to throw any light on human personality\u2014on\nits nature, its origin, its powers or its destinies,\u2014and in\nthe future this Society will be as eager to encourage the\nwork of psycho-analysts in its bearings on Psychical\nResearch, as in the past it was ready to examine the\nobscure phenomena described by the Mesmerists and\nhypnotists of former times. No doubts or fears of the\nconclusions towards which such investigation may lead\nshould deter us from this task ; nor should we be induced\nto abandon our efforts because of results arrived at in\nany field of inquiry other than that of Psychical Researck\nitself.\nThere can be little doubt that the weight of authority\nstill inclines strongly against the inclusion of Psychical\nResearch among the legitimate avocations of men of\nscience. Professor JM'^Dougall, in his presidential address\n\fLXXXV.] Presidential Address. 19\nto us two years ago, felt the need to excuse or justify\nthe aloofness of so many men of science, and especially\nof psychologists, from the work of our Society ; and he\nascribed this aloofness to the feeling of responsibility\ntowards the public which actuates the conduct of psy-\nchologists in this matter. For they fear that if they\ngive an inch the public will take an ell or more, and\nfortii-Rdth relapse into superstition and barbarism.\nIf I were to try to justify the aloofness of so many\nmembers of the medical profession from the work of our\nSociety, I fear I could not ascribe their aloofness to any\nsuch altruistic motives as Professor M*^Dougall claimed\nfor the psychologists. I once asked a colleague to assist\nme in an interesting piece of Psychical Research and he^\nrefused. When asked the reason for his refusal he said :\n\" I have a wife and four children.\" The connection\nbetween his refusal to assist me and his reason for refusal\nis not so obscure as at first sight it may appear to be.\nIn the medical profession, even those who have the\ninchnation to undertake the work of Psychical Research\nand the leisure to pursue it, are discouraged from doing\nso by the disapproval of the leaders in the world of\nmedicine, by the scorn of their fellow-practitioners, and\nby the suspicion of the public on whom their livelihood\ndepends. Not only independence of character, but some\ndegree of economic independence is necessary, if one is\nto break away from the herd and show interest in any-\nthing reminiscent of the old associations between occultism\nand medicine ; for not all of us have had the felicity of\nbeing able to say with Descartes : \"I was not, thank\nHeaven, in a condition which compelled me to make\nmerchandise of science for the bettering of my fortune.\"\nBut over and above the social and economic considera-\ntions which may prevent medical men from exhibiting too\ngreat interest in Psychical Research, we must recognize\nthat they, like other men of science, are not in this\nmatter free in their own minds, but are weighed down\nby the incubus of authority and tradition. We know how\nthe progress of medical science became arrested and\nstagnated for centuries, because men attached too much\n\f20 T. IF. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nimportance to the opinious of Hippocrates or Galen or\nCelsus. They remembered the conclusions to which\nHippocrates had come, but they forgot to make use of\nthe method which he had enjoined\u2014namely, to stvidy\nthe observed plienomena at first hand.\nA similar danger threatens us to-day in our relation to\nPsychical Research. We are apt to remember the con-\nclusions of science while we forget its principles and its\nmethods. And yet the conclusions of science are often\nephemeral, whilst its principles and its methods are\npermanent and perhaps inviolable. We cannot admit that\nany phenomenon presented by nature is unworthy of, or\nunsuited to, examination by the methods of science, and\nwe must not abandon our privilege or forgo our right to\ninquire into the phenomena of Psychical Research merely\nbecause the tradition of science declares these phenomena\nto be invariably due to coincidence, illusion, or fraud.\nWe must rather adopt the advice which Socrates gave to\nPhaedrus, when he said :\n\" We ought not to be content\n-with the name of Hippocrates, but to examine and see\nwhether he has reason on his side . . . consider what right\nreason, as well as Hippocrates, says about this or any\nother nature.\"\nForty years ago this Society set out to examine all\nthe problems of Psychical Research \" without prejudice\nor prepossessions of any kind, and in the same spirit of\nexact and imimpassioned inquiry which has enabled science\nto solve so many problems, once not less obscure nor less\nhotly debated.\" The same spirit must animate us still ;\nand however much those who have spent long years in\nthe observation of psychical phenomena and in the critical\nsifting of the evidence, may be entitled to convictions\nwhich to the outside world appear due to prejudice or\nprepossession, it would perhaps be Avell if for many years\nto come each new recruit to our ranks were to begin\nat the beginning, and approach the problems of Psychical\nResearch with a mind tmfettered by any preconceptions\nimposed by mere tradition or authority. The more\nsceptical and critical he may be, the more gladly shall we\nwelcome him ; but we would remind him, in the words\n\fLXXXV.] Presidential Address. 21\nof our revered first President, Henry Sidgmck, that \" it\nis not a scientific way of dealing with a mass of testimony\nto explain what you can, and say that the rest is untrue.\nIt may be common sense ; but it is not science.\"\nThere are, however, many to whom the cold scientific\nattitude towards problems which are for them suffused\nwith so much feeling must seem unbearable ;\nand they\nmay be tempted to adopt Spiritualism as a religious faith\nrather than patiently to await the harvest from the scanty\nreapings and laborious winnowings by which alone truth\nis gleaned in the field of Psychical Research. And,\nindeed, an ardent longing for assurance that human\npersonality survives the death of the body, carries with\nit an affective mental state which is ill-suited for the\nexamining of evidence or the forming of unbiassed judg-\nments. Those whose minds are so constituted, those to\nwhom it matters too much which way the balance of\nevidence inclines, would perhaps do well to leave the\nactive pursuit of Psychical Research to others whose faith\nis more robust or who, for other reasons, are more in-\ndifferent to the issue ; \u2014to those whose faith is more\nrobust, since there are some who have a belief in immor-\ntality so serene that they are able to take up an objective\nattitude towards empirical evidence which favours or\nopposes the view that man may, for a time at least,\nsurvive the death of his body ; \u2014to those who are more\nindifferent to the issue, for there are many who by\nnature or by nurture do feel thus, and because such\nrelative absence of feeling is the chief requirement in the\nforming of purely objective judgments.\nIn Psychical Research, as in other fields of scientific\ninquiry, we must endeavour so to work that we do not\ncare what the goal may be towards which our quest may\nlead us ; but this indifference is hardly to be won if\nlove of life or fear of death hold too great sway within\nour minds.

The person\nreceiving the impression is called the percipient, and\nthe person from whom it is presumed to come, the\nagent. It is assumed that an experience occurring to\nthe percipient as much as twelve hours after the death\nof the agent may be a phantasm of the living, as we\nhave to allow both for the possibility of delay in the\nemergence of the telepathic impression received, and\nof bodily life not absolutely ceasing at the apparent\nmoment of death. The above definitions and explanations\nare hardly necessary for the majority of readers, but it '\nis as well to make clear what this paper is to be\nabout. ^\nSince Gurney's book was published thirty-six years\nhave elapsed, and many fresh cases have naturally been\nreceived by the Society. These have for the most\npart been printed in the Journal, but some of them\nhave, without first appearing in the Journal, been\npublished either in various papers in Proceedings, or\nin Podmore's book Apparitions and Thought-transference,\npublished in 1894, or in Myers' book Human Personality\nand its Survival of Bodily Death, published posthumously\nin 1903. Also some fifty-four cases printed in the Journal\nhave since been published in Proceedings or in one of\nthese books, and being, therefore, already before the\npublic, are excluded from this paper.^ Those cases printed,\nby the Society, in the Journal only are not readily\naccessible to the general public, as the Joimial is printed\nfor private circulation. Moreover, what is more important,\nthey are only to a very slight extent classified, and\ncases unclassified and scattered through many volumes\nare not in a convenient form for study.\n1 There are, of course, cases printed in the Journal which cannot\nby any stretch be regarded as phantasms of the Hving\u2014cases such\nas premonitions, apparent communications from the dead, some accounts\nof haunted houses, and others. But tliese are outside the present\ndiscussion. Taken all together, they are far less numerous than the\neases which may be regarded as phantasms of the living.\n2 The following is a list of these fifty-four cases with their place of\npublication. \" Podmore \" stands for his Apparitions and Thought-\nTransference, H.P. stands for Myers' Hmvan Personality and its Survival\n\fLXXXVI.] Introduction 25\nI have therefore for some time felt, and was glad to\nhear the same view expressed by Mr. G.

The present paper is\nan attempt to do this. But I am making further restric-\ntions. I propose to omit all cases in which the interval\nbetween experience and record exceeds five years. This\ntime limit is arbitrary, and, as would be the case with\nany other limit chosen, does not discriminate infallibly\nbetween the evidential value of the cases it includes\nand excludes. It is probably partly for this reason\nthat no time limit was fixed in the books and articles\nI have referred to above. But early record of cases is\nof Bodily Death.

We have arrived\nat a stage when, if our knowledge of telepathy is to\ngrow, we want not only evidence of the broad fact that\nthere was a coincidence between the phantasm and\nsome external event suggesting a causal connection between\nthem, but light on the process of telepathy and the\nconditions under which evidence of it can be obtained.\nFor this details become more and more important, and\nit will, I think, be readily admitted that five years is\na long time through which to trust to memory for details.\nI am glad to say that the interval between experience\nand record matter of fact, usually much less\nthan five years in the cases before us. Indeed, for\na good many years past cases not recorded till five years\nafter their occurrence have not been printed.\nI am further ignoring a few cases where the evidence\nseems to me to be in some way or other too defective\nto be worth discussing. I do not mean to imply that\nthe evidence for telepathy in all the cases retained is\nstrong, or that they are all well recorded or corroborated.\nThis is not so, and it may well be that some readers\nwill think some of the cases retained might with advantage\nhave been omitted. It is a question of degree, and it\nis only a few of the weakest that I have ignored. We\nmight perhaps put it that some of the cases retained\ndo not add to the evidence for telepathy, but granting\ntelepathy it seems likely that it operated. {\nAfter eliminating cases for these three reasons\u2014namely\n(a) that they have been already published in the Pro-\nceedings or in the books named above ; (6) that they\nwere not recorded sufficiently near the time of occurrence ;\n(c) that the evidence is too weak\u2014we are left with about\n200, which I shall call the present collection, or our\ncollection. It consists of some 30 experimental or semi-\nexperimental cases, and 170 spontaneous experiences, in\nabout one third of which the percipient was admittedly\ndreaming.\nThe exclusion from our collection of the 54 cases\nalready published somewhat reduces its value, for these\ncases were of course selected as for some reason important\n\fLXXXVI.] Introduction. 27\nor interesting. It also somewhat alters the proportion\nin which different kinds of experiences are represented.\nEspecially is this so with dreams, of which there are\ncomparatively few among the published cases. In experi-\nmental cases the proportion is affected the other way,\nthe number previously published being proportionately\nlarge and including a good many of the best.^\nIn arranging our collection I begin, as Gurney did\nin Phantasms of the Living, with experimental and semi-\nexperimental cases, to which Chapter I. is devoted, and\nproceed in Chapter II. to cases where the experiences\nof the percipients consist of ideas or mental pictures,\nor emotions or motor effects\u2014cases that is where the\nphantasms are not externalised as waking sensory halluci-\nnations nor as dreams with the same quaUties. From\nthis point on, however, my classification differs from\nGurney's. He has treated separately dreams, \" border-\nland \" cases (that is experiences occurring when the\npercipient was in bed but believed himself to be awake),\nand hallucinations when the percipient was up and about ;\nwhile I have treated these three classes together.\nThis departure from precedent needs some explanation\nand justification. In the first place, treating dreams and\nhallucinations together assumes that they can be regarded\nas in important respects experiences of the same kind,\nand in particular that, e.g., the figures seen in our dreams,\nthe characters that act in them and seem external to\nourselves, are of the same nature as apparitions seen\nby waking percipients. That this is so is shown and\nstrongly insisted on in Gurney's book, and, as he points\nout, cases are not infrequent where a dream figure is\ncontinued for an appreciable time after waking as a\nwaking hallucination. It was not mainly the difference\nin their psychical nature that led Gurney to treat dreams\nand waking hallucinations separately, but the difference\nin their evidential value.\nThough incidentally it did much else, his book chiefly\n^ The great majority of cases printed in the Journal, and afterwards\npubhshed in Proceedings or in the boolis mentioned, were in early\nvolumes of the Journal. There is only one after Vol. VIII.\n\f28 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part S\naimed at producing a cumulative, quasi-statistical proof\nof telepathy by showing that a rare psychical event in\nthe percipient's life, such as an apparition of the agent,\ncoincided with a marked crisis in the latter's life much\nmore often than any theory of probability warranted us\nin expecting. Now a dream is seldom a rare psychical\nevent. Some dreams are more impressive than others, but,\non the whole, dreaming is such a frequent experience, and\nthe range of the possible contents of dreams so wide,\nj\nthat they seldom surprise us as a vivid sensory hallucina-\ntion does. The probability of something in a dream\ncorresponding with a crisis in the agent's life by pure\nchance is much greater than the probability that a\nwaking hallucination will do so. And we have to consider\nin addition the ease with which dreams elude memory\nand the consequent danger of their being altered in\nrecollection (if not noted at the time) to correspond with\nthe subsequently learnt facts of the agent's experience.\nBut we may now, for the sake of argument at least,\nassume that Gurney's book has accomplished its object,\nand that telepathy is proved, and starting from that\npoint may devote ourselves primarily to seeking for\nlight on the occasions and mode of its operation.^ From\nthis point of view dreams have an advantage over most\nsensory hallucinations, for they have a chance of coinciding\nin a larger number of items with the agent's contemporary\nexperience. In a realistic hallucination, the seeing for\ninstance of an apparition of a dying agent standing in\nthe room, the idea of the agent's personality is as a\nrule all that is conveyed to the percipient ; the accessories,\nclothes, etc., seldom affording any evidence of being de-\nrived otherwise than from the percipient's own mind.\nIf the agent and percipient have been in telepathic\ntouch subliminally more completely than apj)ears, it is\n^ In speaking of telepathy as proved, I do not of course mean that\nit is yet accepted by the scientific world. Much more accumulation\nof well evidenced instances will be required before this can be claimed.\nBut we want more than the mere piling up of facts. Our facts will\nbe the more readily accepted, the more we can compare them, and,\nprovisionally assuming telepathy, show when and how it occurs.\n\fLXXXVI.] Introduction. 29\nsubliniinally only.^ This meagreness in the content of\nsensory haUucinations is equally characteristic of veridical\nand non-veridical ones. But with dreams it is very\ndifferent. In dreams, instead of being merely a spectator,\nthe percipient is usually an actor, his own part in what\nseems to occur being part of the illusory impression. The\ndream represents dramatically an incident or little story\nin which the percipient is concerned. The details of\nthe little drama may be in part veridical, and may thus\namplify the communication from the agent. They may,\non the other hand, even in veridical dreams {e.g. L. 1147,\np. 196, and L. 1179, p. 195), be pure embroidery by the\ndream consciousness on the veridical basis, confusing\nthe latter. The tendency to embroidery in dreams may\nbe compared with the same tendency in automatic script\nand in trance speech, making discrimination between\nthe true and the false difficult. Still, on the whole, we\ndo in veridical dreams generally get more than the\nmere fact that the agent has appeared or his voice has\nbeen heard.\nThe principle of classification adopted will appear\nclearly as we proceed, and I need not describe it here\nmore than I have already done. I ought to say, how-\never, that I have not adhered to it quite strictly. In\na few instances it has seemed better to take a case out\nof its proper order, so as to place it with another that\nresembles it in a way that seems interesting or instructive.\nI have not quoted all the cases in full. Some I have\nso quoted. Others I have abbreviated, either by giving\nonly the percipient's account without quoting corroborative\nstatements or other evidence given in the Journal, or\nThere are some hallucinations that reveal more. The rather rare\ntype among spontaneous cases, which I have called visions\u2014pictorial\nrepresentations of the agent or others not forming part of the percipient's\nnormal surroundings\u2014may convey more information. (For an example\nsee L. 1207, p. 243 below.) So of course may crystal visions. There\nare also some apparitions that seem to speak, and thus to convey\ninformation. In a very odd case, apparently well evidenced, in the\nJournal, Vol. V., p. 147 (not reproduced here, because it has been\npublished in Human Personality, Vol. I., pp. 675-8), a conversation with\nthe apparition is reported, quite as might happen in a dream.\n\f30 Mrs. Heyiry Sidgivick.

At the end of this paper I give\na classified list of cases quoted or described in it, which\nwill serve as a table of contents.\nThe original meaning of the letters L, G, M, etc. need not be con-\nsidered.

In most\nof the cases of this sort recorded in the Journal the\nagent was endeavouring to impress the percipient with\nthe idea of some object or action. These I do not\npropose to reprint here, as they would take considerable\nspace and are in some sense a residuum, since the best\ncases of the same kind have been published in Proceedings\nor in the books mentioned above. Nevertheless, they\nhave their value and ought not to be lost sight of, and\nit may therefore be useful to give the following list :\nIn the Journal, Vol. III., pp. 179-191, is a collection of\nexperiments, consisting of series by different investigators,\nwith agent and percipient in the same room. One of\nthe contributors to this collection\u2014Mrs. Shield, a careful\nand painstaking investigator much interested in our\nwork\u2014later sent some further series which are printed\nin the Journal, Vol. V., p. 189 and p. 296. Some similar\nseries of experiments by Mr. Edmund Selous are printed in\nVol. v., p. 184. Experiments of the same kind by\nMiss Campbell and Miss Despard will be found in Vol. VI.,\np. 4. The experiments at a distance by the same ladies\nhave been published. Some similar experiments with\nagent and percipient in the same room, contributed by\nProfessor Chattock, are printed in Vol. VIII., p. 302.\nFrom Dr. A. S. Wiltse\u2014who, it will be recalled, has\n\f32 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncontributed several important items of different kinds\nto our published records\u2014there are three sets of similar\nexperiments with agent and percipient in the same room,\ninterspersed with a few in which facts at a distance\nseem to have been supernormally perceived. The records\nof these experiments are printed in the Journal, Vol. VII.,\npp. 197-206 and 240-242. There is also a short series\nfurnished by Miss B. H. Grieve (see below, pp. 48, etc.)\nprinted in the Journal, Vol. X., pp. 260-263. In this\nseries some experiments were carried out when agent\nand percipient were apart, and some when they were\ntogether ; and the series includes one veridical spon-\ntaneous impression derived by one of the ladies from\n(apparently) one of the two she had experimented with.\nExperiments with agent and percipient in the same\nroom having an obvious drawback in the difficulty of\nabsolutely excluding the possibility of unconscious indica-\ntions on the part of the agent, it is highly desirable\nthat in serious experiments agent and percipient should,\nif possible, be in different rooms or separated by still\ngreater distances ; and the experiments more recently\npublished in Proceedings have been so arranged. There\nwere earlier also valuable experiments at a distance\nprinted in the Journal, but these have all, I think, been\nsubsequently published except one series by M. Glardon\nin the Journal, Vol. VI., p. 98. This is referred to in\nHuman Personality, but only a later and more strikingly\nsuccessful series by the same agent and jDercipient {Journal,\nVol. VI., p. 325) is published there in full.\nThere are two experiments in thought-transference\nwitli agent and percipient in the same room, which I\nwill quote because the method was different\u2014the percipient\nlooking in a crystal with a view to seeing what the\nagent was trying to make her see.

He had never seen crystal gazing,\nso I told him to fix his mind on some scene, which I\nwould endeavour to describe. Almost at once I saw\na large room with a pohshed tloor reflected, the hghts\nbeing very bright and all round ; but the room was\nempty, which I thought very uninteresting ! Mr. Mac\nsaid how strange that was, as he had not, so far, been\nable to fix his mind on any particular face in the ballroom.\nHowever, he asked me to look agam, and this time I\nsaw a smaller room, very comfortably furnished, and\nat a small table under a bright light with a glass globe\n(no shade on the globe) sat a young girl, in a high-necked\nwhite blouse, apparently writing or readmg. I could\nnot see her face distinctly, but she was pale, with her\nhair drawn softly off her forehead (no fringe), and seemed\nto have rather small features.\nMr. Mac said my description quite talUed with\nthe lady he was thinking of, a Miss , whom he had\nmet for the first time at a ball a few nights before, but\nhe had meant me to see her dressed as he met her m\nthe balk'oom.\nWe consulted our watches, and fomid that it was\nbetween 10.15 and 10.30 when we were scrying, and\nMr. Mac said he would try to find out what IVIiss\nwas doing at that hour. Fortmiately I had not long\nto wait for his report, as he met her the next evening,\nand told her of my experiment. She was very much\nmterested, I believe, and said it was all qiiite true !\nShe had been wearmg a white blouse, and, as far as\nshe remembers, she was still readmg at 10.30 under a\nbright incandescent fight, with a glass globe on it.\nMr. Mac writes (December 30th, 1897) :\nI was at Miss Angus's house on Tuesday, December\n21st, 1897.

I thought of somebody that she did\nnot Imow\u2014Miss , whom I had met at a dance on\nDecember 20th. I thought of the ballroom where 1 \\\nhad been introduced to her, but at first I could not\ncentre my mind on her face. Then Miss A. said that\nshe saw a big room with a pohshed floor, and which\nwas brilliantly ht up, but that at present she could not\nmake out any people there. Then I succeeded in fixing\nmy mind on Miss 's face, when Miss A. said that\nshe saw a girl with fair wavy hair either writing a letter\nor reading, but probably the former, under a lamj) with\na glass globe, and that she had a high-necked white\nblouse on. All this took about five mmutes.\nI saw Miss agam at a dance on December 22nd\u2014 j\nthe next night.

I do \\\nnot think that Miss Angus Imows Miss . There were\nthree other people in the room all the time, one of whom\nwas playing the piano. This is exactly what happened,\nas far as I can remember.\nAlthough agent and percipient were apparently close\ntogether in this case, it is difficult to imagine how un-\nconscious indications can have suggested the vision to\nthe percipient, and it will be observed that in the second\nvision, a third mind, that of the lady of the vision,\nseems to have been more or less involved.\nThis perhaps happened also in the case to be next .\nquoted (from the Journal, Vol. VIII., p. 71).

They were\non a sofa in a corner of my study, and I was seated\non a chair (or rather a low oriental seat) m front of\nthem at a small table of black wood, uncovered, with\na glass of water before me and two high candles Hghted,\ngiving the necessary brilliant spot to gaze at in the\nglass. Miss Klado never hypnotised me or even tried\nto, and I remain in my clairvoyant experience always\nperfectly awake and in my natural state, neither tired\nnor troubled anj'how. But her presence always helps\nme to see quicker and better, and I feel my own power\n\" electrise \" through hers -without any contact with her.\nThat evening her only role was then that of a \" sym-\npathetic current.\" She sat and concentrated her thoughts\nas far as possible on the same subject as me.\nMiss T. was nearer to me and, looking at me and at\nthe glass, tried to suggest to me to see what she wanted,\n\u2014that is, a certain person I never had seen or even\n^ Vision in a glass of water or other reflecting surface is, of course,\nof the same character as Crystal-vision.\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgiviclc. [part\nheard of (she only told me it was a lady, but not who,\nand even had she done so, the name was unknown to\nme), whose surroundings and even the town or country\nshe lived m were a mystery to me, as well as to Miss\nKlado. I had no clue whatever to what I could possibly\nsee about this lady.\nNow Miss T. did not know herself much about the\nlady ; she has never been to her house and has heard\nhttle about her way of hving, so that she could suggest\nto me the image of the person, but not of her pastime,\ndress, or rooms.\nWe looked what time it was (a httle over eight), and\nproceeded to pry in the unlaioOTi lady's doings. As\nbefore, I always need some time to see anythmg when\nI have not practised for some months. After ten or\ntwelve minutes gradually the usual very small picture\nwas formed in the brilliant circle thrown by the hghts\nin the glass (standing on a smooth white paper laid on\nthe table). I seldom see any colour but black, white,\nand spots of light when there is a lamp, candles, or\nsomething of the sort (faces, when they are larger,\n\u2014\nonly the head seen, for instance\u2014sometimes have their\nnatural flesh colouring).\nFirst I saw a slender woman with very fair hair and\nill a costume which puzzled me as well as her doings.\nI described a rnesure all that went on in the glass, Miss T.\nsaying nothing as yet. The figure began to move and\nI could then make out that she was dressing ; she walked\ndown the room, lifted her arms, took something from a\nboard, then stayed in front of what was probably a\nmirror (I saw only the dark side), and dressed her hair\non the forehead. Then she washed her hands, and the\nmoving to and from me of her arms and of the essuie-main\nshe held was perfectly distinct. She had a tea-gown\nof light colour with long (Greek) sleeves.\nThe scene changed all at once. I saw her in another\nroom, better lighted, and a gentleman stood beside her,\nto whom she seemed to talk in an animated way. The\ngentleman was inclined to be stout, with a light beard\nand the hair a shade darker.

[part\nA few days later we met, and for my part I cannot\ndeny that our experiment was a complete success, as\nwill be seen from the following account.\nThe person chosen by me, and of whom I was to think\non that occasion, was unknown to my friend, nor was\nI ever m her house myself.\nAfter gazing for some time into the Avater, my friend\nsaid that she saw a room, and described it to me and\nhow it was furnished. Then further on she said that a\nhuman figure appeared, that of a shght fair-haired woman,\ndressed m a mornmg gown with wide sleeves, and which\nseemed to be either white or a pale blue ; then my friend\ntold me that she saw the door open and a gentleman\nenter the room ; and on my friend describing his person,\nI recognised him at once.\nThe very next day I hastened to that lady's house,\nand questioned her as to where she was on the preceding\nevening, and how she was dressed.

Gernet.\nIf the mind of the person seen in the crystal or glass\nof water did in these two cases contribute to the vision,\nit was certainly unconsciously, so that to that extent\nthey resemble the semi-experimental cases to be next\nconsidered.\n\u00a7 2. Semi-experimental Cases. Percipient Experimenting.\nBy a semi -experimental case I mean one in wfiich\neither the percipient is trying to get an impression,\nor the agent is trying to produce one, while the other\nparty to the experience is quite unaware that any attempt\nis being made, and unconscious of contributing to it\nin any way. Semi-experimental cases are dealt with\nby Gurney in his book as\u2014what they of course are\n\u2014transitional between experimental and spontaneous cases,\nbut he only considers those where the agent was the\nexperimenter. I think those where the percipient, with\nthe hope of obtaining impressions supernormally, puts\nhimself deliberately under conditions which he believes\nconducive to this result, as in scrying, automatic writing,\netc., may well be regarded as semi-experimental too.\nAnd as throwing light on the telepathic process, such\ncases may be of considerable importance, for they show\nthat sometimes at least the percipient is not like a\nblank sheet of paper, or a lantern screen, ready to\nreceive impressions which the agent throws on it, but\nis himself the active party, and is like an explorer going\nout to see what he can find. The word \" agent \" is\nfrom this point of view not very happily chosen. It\ndoes not fit well where the active part is played by\nthe percipient. Moreover, if success is possible without\nconscious activity on the part of the agent, it seems\nc\n\f40 Mrs. Henry Siclgwick. [part\nto follow that we cannot tell either in fully experimental\nor in spontaneous cases how much of the successful\ntransference is due to the agent and how mvxch to the\npercipient. The share due respectively to one or the\nother may very likely differ in different cases. The\nagent in joint experiments generally concentrates his\nmind on the idea to be transferred if only for the sake\nof ear-marking it and distinguishing it from other ideas\nin his mind, but it does not follow that concentration\nis a necessary part of the process, or even contributes\nto the success. We are not justified in assuming from\nsuch experiments that the idea could not be transferred\nto the percipient unless the agent were consciously thinking\nof it.i\nIn the majority of semi-experimental cases in our\ncollection the percipient is the experimenter. They are\nof various kinds, and we may take first three which are\ncrystal visions, and in that respect like the two cases\nalready quoted.\nThe first (M. CI. 93, Journal, Vol. VII., p. 124) was sent to\nus by Mr. Andrew Lang. He was well acquainted with all\nthe witnesses, whose names were given us in confidence.\n(M. CI. 93.)\nThe following is the account of the seer :\nSt. Andrews, February 10th, 1895.\nOn Sunday, January 20th, 1895, at about 5.30 p.m.,\nI was crystal gazitig and saw Miss M. L. in her drawing-\nroom in , sitting on a sofa, pouring out tea for a\nman in a blue serge suit, whose back was towards me.\nI noticed he had a brown moustache. Miss L. was\ndressed in a dark-coloured blouse with a lace covering\nover the shoulders. There was a lamp at Miss L.'s\n1 For experiments when the activity seems to have been mainly on\nthe side of tlie jDercipient, see Mr. Hubert Wales' paper in Proceedings,\nVol. XXX., p. 124 et seq. Perhaps in such cases there is some quality\nin the passive agent which makes it possible for the percipient to get\nat certain parts of the contents of his mind.\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Oases. 41\nleft hand. I described what I had seen to her, and\nshe said what I had seen was quite correct. R. T. B.\nMiss M. L. writes :\nMr. B., without explaining why, asked me at a ball\nif I had been giving tea to a man on the previous Sunday\nafternoon. Such a thing is possible any Sunday ; but\nhe then proceeded to describe my dress and also exactly\nwhere I was sitting, so much so, that I at once said\nthat one of the bUnds must have been up and that\nhe had seen me from the other side of the road, which,\nhowever, proves impossible, as Mr. B. was in St. Andrews\nat the time.\nHe also described where the other man was sitting, with\nhis back to the window, and I was on the sofa giving\nout tea, all of which I answered iinwittingly in the\naffirmative.

I first induced a sKght\nhypnotic trance and suggested verbally that she would\n\f42 Mrs. Henry Sidgioiclc. [part\nbe able to hear. I then woke her and told her to look\nin the crystal.\nThe first vision that appeared was the sitting-room in\nthe house of Mr. T. B., a friend of hers who I have\nnever seen. He was there with his brother and sister-m-\nlaw, and the room was minutely described. It was\nevening, and the gas lighted, and she saw the door open\nand a man come in. At this moment I said, \" Place\nthe shell to your ear.\" She did so, and to her dehght\nshe heard the newcomer exclaim, \" There is good news\nto-night, we have taken another village.\" They then\nproceeded to talk about Mr. T.

H., wTites :\nLeeds, May mii, 1902.\nOn the night of AjDril 16th I retired to bed feeling\nunusually depressed, placing a glass of water on the table\nfor drmkmg durmg the night. My husband was on night\nduty at the time on the L.N.W. line. I awoke with\na start about three o'clock in the morning, and feelmg\nthirsty, reached out of bed for the water ; when about\nto partake of it, I saw, to my surprise, a moving picture\nin the glass, comprising waggons, and in the rear a guard's\nvan ; as I looked they all appeared to smash into each\nother, and I noticed the van in particular was the most\ndamaged. My husband came home about two hours\nlater and told me that he passed the scene of the acci-\ndent, and that the guard was seriously injured. I regard\nthe above as somethmg more than a mere coincidence.\nMr. H. writes :\nI am a Goods Inspector on the L.N.W. Railway, and\nwas travelling with a goods train to Manchester on the\nnight of April IGtli, 1902, and, after passing Ashton\nat 3.10 a.m. on the 17th, I passed the scene of an acci-\ndent, which had occurred to our Leeds to London express\ngoods train on the Micklehurst New Line, near Staley\nand Millbrook Station. It was distinctly visible to me\nand the goods guard I \\\\as traveUmg with, as the break-\ndown gang was out and large fires burning. On my\nreturning from Manchester, I passed over the scene of\nthe accident, and saw the waggons and guard's van, the\nlatter being very badly damaged ; that was about 7.50\na.m. April 17th. On my reaclung home, my wife told\nme of the vision she had seen .\n\f46 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nThe following are questions addressed by Mr. Lee to Mrs. H.,\nwith her answers appended, I'eceived by us on June 30th,\n1902 :\n(1) Why were you depressed ? Did you connect your\ndejiression with your husband ?\nAns. I was dejwessed on account of the childs illness,\nand worried owing to my husband's absence from home\nat such a time ;\nupon seeing the vision, I at once thought\nof my husband and wondered if he was safe.\n(2) Did you see the time, or how did you know ?\nA)is. At that time I lifted the clock off the mantel\nand placed it on the table, where I could see it without\nrising.\n(3) Do you generally have water at your side 1\nAns. Every night, as the little girl generally asks for\nwater during the night.\n(4) Was the room lighted, or how did you see the\npicture 'I\nAns. The gas was left burning, turned low, and there\nwas a bright tire, as o\\\\ing to the siclaiess it was always\nkept in.\n(5) Did the whole train seem to smash up 1\nAns. When I saw the jiicture, there appeared to be\na few waggons and a guard's van ;\nthey all seemed to\nsmash into each other.\n(6) What time did your husband come home ?\nAns. About nine o'clock in the morning.\n(7) Had you connected the vision with him, and felt\nanxious on that account ?\nA71S. Yes.\n(8) Did he tell you fii-st, or you him 1\nAns. I told him first, and to my surprise he knew\nof the accident.\n(9) Do you often have similar experiences and warnings ?\nAns. Very often, especially before siclaress.\n(10) Have you ever heard of crystal-gazing ?\nAns. Yes, but I have never looked through one.\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 47\nIn answer to further questions from us, Mr. H. wrote on\nAugust 13th, 1902 :\nIn answer to your letter of IGth ulto., I have been\nunavoidably busy or would have rephed sooner.\n(1) I was about a quarter of a mile from the scene\nof the accident when I passed at 3 a.m., and saw the\nmen working on the hne, there being great fires burning\nand numerous lanterns, but could not distmguish anything\nelse distinctly.\n(2) The accident occurred at about 10 p.m.\n(3) I passed the scene a second time at 7.50 the next\nmornmg, and saw the brake van and one or two waggons\nwhich had been m the collision, and aU very much broken\nup.\nThus it appears that at the time when ]\\irs. H. saw the\nvision, her husband had only seen that there was an accident,\nthe details of A\\\"hich A\\ere indistinguishable to him, and it \"was\nnot until about five hours later that he actually witnessed\nthe details, which corresjjonded fairly closely to JVIi's. H.'s\nvision. His connection with railway aliairs would be likely\nto make his recollection of the times especially accurate\n;\nso that at first sight there might seem to be some difficulty\nin explaining the case by telepathy from him to his wife.\nWe have to consider, however, that the mere Icnowledge that\nan accident had taken place Avould inevitably call up m the\nmind\u2014especially of a railway man\u2014some impression of the\ndetails of the scene, wliich would be more or less m accord-\nance with the facts ; and it is not clear that Mrs. H.'s vision\naccorded with them more closely than would such an impres-\nsion. Thus the details of her vision might \\\\'ell have been\nderived from the imjDression produced in his mmd on first\npassing the scene.\nThere is only one other crystal-vision case in our\ncollection, and that was a vision shared by two percipients\nboth consciously experimenting. They were casually trying\nwhether, looking into the same crystal, they would both\n\f48 Mrs. He7iry 8idg wick. [part\nsee the same vision, and the_y at least approximately did\nso^ (L. 1126, Journal, Vol. X., p. 134).\n(L. 1126.)\nThe account was sent to us through the kmdness of Mr.\nAndrew Lang, one of the percipients, Miss Grieve, being a\nniece of his ; '\"^\nit was received on October 11th, 1901.\nMiss Grieve writes :\nThe Leaseowes, Halesowen, Worcestershire.\nOn June 24th C. and myself were reading anatomy\ntogether. C. took the crystal ball and I looked over\nher shoulder\u2014both of us merely wondermg if we should\nsee the same thing. At the same moment the ball\ndarkened, a white cloud came over the whole, and three\npjrramids appeared, a large one m front, the other two\nbehind. Then a tram of camels, some with riders, others\nbeing led, passed from left to right and disappeared\nbehind the large pyramid. The vision lasted about one\nmmute, and vanished simultaneously for both of us. We\neach wrote down as the things appeared, so as to be\naccurate ; and I had no thoughts of pyramids m my\nmind. B. H. Grieve.\nMiss Grieve 's friend gives her own recollections of the\nvision as follows :\nOn the 24th day of June, 1901, B. G. and myself were\nlooldng up muscles for an exam., and we had the crystal\nball on the table.\nWe both looked into it casually, and I at least had\nno definite thoughts in my mmd, when simultaneously\nwe saw some pyramids appear, one large one in front\n^ It may be worth comparing an experiment described in Proceedings,\nVol. VI., p. 434, in which a hallucinatory picture on a blank card\nwhich had been suggested to one hypnotised percipient was apparently\ntransferred telepathically to another when she was shown the card.\nCompare also a collective vision in a mirror.

On\nthe first one was a man, whose features I could not\ndistinguish, as he was muffled up. Most of the other\ncamels had large packages on their backs and were led.\nThe procession passed slowly round the pyramid and\nthen all vanished.\nAnother day I was looking into the ball by firehght\nhoping to see a favourite colhe dog that had died a year\npreviously.\nThe ball turned all black at first, then a light spot\nappeared in the centre and gradually spread nearly ;iU\nover the ball. In the centre of this was a true portrait\nof the dog,\u2014perfectly hfe-hke. The vision only remained\na few seconds. Catherine Coad.\nThe second vision described by IVIiss Coad seems to show\na special faculty on her part of vivid visuahsation ; it was,\ntherefore, especially important to ascertam whether any con-\nversation took place between her and Miss Grieve durmg\nthe course of the vision, which might have suggested to her\nthe same scene. In reply to questions on this pomt, and\nas to the notes made at the time. Miss Grieve wites to us :\nOctober llth, 1901.\n... I am sorry to say I cannot send you the rough\nnotes we made at the time ; we left them here (at the\ncollege) last term and cannot find them anywhere now. . . .\nThe descriptions were written immediately after seeing\nthe vision, but before either of us said anything, and we\ndid not speak while the vision lasted. . . .\nBertha H. Grieve.\nThis scene does not seem to have been derived from\nanything external to the scryer's minds, nor could they\ntrace any associations of ideas which might have suggested\nit. As moreover they did not speak till they had both\nwritten down what they saw, thus avoiding verbal sugges-\ntion, the concordance in their visions was apparently\ndue to telepathy between them. With which of the\nladies the vision started we cannot tell. Both have\n\f50 Mrs. Henry Siclgivich. [part\non other occasions had telepathic experiences, sometimes\nas agent and sometimes as percipient.^ Perhaps the\nmost probable explanation of their collective crystal\nvision is that they both on this occasion acted in both\ncapacities. Both Avere obviously percipients and both\nmay have been agents\u2014one starting the idea, but its\ndevelopment depending on action and reaction between\ntheir minds, operating as verbal suggestion might have\ndone had they commented on what they saw as the\nvision proceeded.\nIn the case I will next quote (L. 1208, Journal, Vol.\nXVII., p. 235) there is, as in some crystal visions, a\ndeliberate attempt to see something in connexion with\na particular person, and apparently to see it in a definite\nposition in space though without the use of artificial\naid such as a crystal.\n(L. 1208.)\nWe received the case from Mr. L. C. Powles, a member\nof the Society. The percipient was Mr. James W. Sharpe,\nlate Fellow of Gonville and Cains CoUege, Cambridge.\nMr. Powles' statement of the case is as follows :\nThe Highlands, Rye, Sussex, July 2, 1916.\nOu Aug. 4, 1913, I had been invited by a friend,\nMiss B., living m the neighbouring town, some three\nmiles off, to meet Mr. James W. Sharpe. On the after-\nnoon of that day, therefore, I rode over to her house,\nleaving my Avife, who was not well enough to accompany\nme, resting by herself.\nAt tea-time we talked, I think, entirely upon psychical\nmatters, and I remember askmg Mr. Sharpe if he saw\n\" auras \" round people, and, if so, what he saw round me.\nAt first he saw nothing, but later he said :\n\" You asked\nme to tell you ; I do now see something.\" He saw two\nthmgs behind me. (I now refer to my notes made\n^ Miss Coad was one of the three experimenters concerned in the\nshort series of thought-transference experiments mentioned above as\nsent by Miss Grieve and recorded in the Journal, Vol. X., pp. 260-263.\n\fLxxxvi.] Exioerimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 51\nthe same evening on my return.) \" One, a dark, not\ninimical,! half-human creature, with Imotted hands placed\nupon my shoulders.\" This he said was \" symbohcal of\nilhiess near at hand\u2014a warnmg.\"\nThen appeared the \" faint sUght figure of a young\nwoman with oval face, etc.\" (here follow some details\nAvhich very well apply to my wife's appearance). She\n\" tried to avert the illness.\"\nWhen I came home towards six o'clock my wife told\nme she had been very anxious about my being out in\nthe cold wind ; also\u2014and this is the important part\nof the case\u2014she had been quite obsessed by a somewhat\ngrotesque story of a man dressed up as a gorilla who\ncomes up behind the master of the house and strangles\nhim with his hands. L. C. Powles.\nWe have also received a statement from Mrs. Powles, as\nfollows :\nJuly 2, 191G.\nI remember perfectly my husband going over to tea\non Aug. 4, 1913, at our friend's house. Miss B.'s, and\nmy being unable to go with him that day.\nI was anxious about him, as he had only recently\nrecovered from pneumonia, and there was a very cold\nwind. To pass the time and divert my thoughts I\ntook up the Strand Magazine, and became absorbed in\na very horrible story of a man disguised as a gorilla\nwho came behind his enemy and broke his neck with his\npowerful hands.\nI have always had a great horror of gorillas from\nchildhood, and far-fetched as it was, I was made very\nnervous and oppressed by the story and longed for my\nhusband's return. Immediately he came, I told him\nof the story and the absurdly nervous state it had left\nme in. This interested him extremely, and he then\ntold me something of Mr. Sharpe's vision. He did not\nat the time describe it quite fully for fear of alarming me,\nand particularly did not mention that Mr. Sharpe thought\nit might be a Health-wammg. Isabel G. Powles.\n1 For comment on this word, see below,\n\f52 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nIt will be observed that these two statements were written\non July 2, 1916, nearly three years after the occurrence of\nthe incident to which they refer Mr. PoMdes' statement,\nhowever, is based on notes made within a few hours of this\nincident, and we have been able to obtam further corroborative\nevidence in the form of a statement by Miss B.^ who was\npresent when the percipient, Mr. Sharpe, described his impres-\nsions, and also a letter written by Mr. Powles to Miss B.\non the day after the incident occurred.\nMiss B.'s statement, contained in a letter to Mr. Powles,\nwhich was written in reply to his enquiry whether she reme m-\nbered Mr. Sharpe 's \" vision,\"\u2014is as follows :\nJuly 27, 1916.\nCertainly I remember Mr. Sharpe 's \" vision \" on the\n4th of August, 1913, and that you wrote to me on the\nfollowing day giving me what you felt to be an explanation\nof it.\nI remember that Mr. Sharpe said he seemed to see\na non-human creature with his Imotted hands on your\nshoulders, and that is the expression you used in your\nletter of the 5th of August, 1913, . . .

This\nstory quite oppressed her and might easily account for\nthe \" dark, non-human, creature behind me with his\nknotted hands on my shoulder.\" ... L. C. Powles.\njVIr. Powles has informed us that m replj^ to an enquiry\naddressed to Mr. Sharpe, asking whether he remembered the\nincident described above, Mr. Sharpe wrote that\nhe does not remember the actual vision, but that by\n\" mimical \" (see above, p. 51) he meant a symboHcal\nHealth-wammg or warning of trouble to come, but not\nactively hostile.\nThe \" health-warning \"\u2014Mr. Powles tells us\n\u2014\" has not\nproved to be veridical, as I have not been ill at all since,\nand no disaster has hapjaened.\"\nThe percipient, Mr. Sharpe, apparently interpreted,\nhis vision as a symbolic representation of his own impres-\nsion concerning Mr. Powles' health. But the corre-\nspondence of the vision with what was in the mind of\nMrs. Powles at a distance is very remarkable, and the\nelement of oddness in it seems to remove any probability\nof its being accidental, or the result of fortunate sub-\nliminal guessing. If it was due to telepathy, Mr. Powles'\nmind must apparently have been concerned as well as\nthat of Mrs. Powles, for it is improbable that Mr. Sharpe\nwould have got into touch with her had her husband\nnot been present.\nThere are in the collection two cases of visions at\nseances, experimental in the sense that the percipients\nhad put themselves in the circumstances in which they\nknew themselves to be liable to experience such visions.\nIn neither case was the vision recognised at the time,\nbut in both it corresponded more or less with true events.\nIt must be observed, however, that in neither case was\nthere apparently any effort to get an impression about\n\f54 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc. [part\nparticular events or connected with particular agents,\nand tliat in both we are told that the percipient frequently\nhad visions of the kind, while we have not the material\nfor judging how far and how often these visions were\nveridical. The experiences therefore share the evidential\nweakness of dreams, and our estimate of their value\nwill depend on how far the amount of correspondence\nbetween vision and fact seems beyond what is hkely\nto occur occasionally by chance. In the first (G. 267,\nJournal, Vol. X., p. 170) the percipient has a vision,\nrepeated after a short interval, of a small child setting\nfire to its clothes, some nine hours after the death,\nunknown to the percipient, of a little nephew from that\ncause, though the details of the accident and vision\ndid not exactly correspond.\n(G. 267.)\nFor the evidence in the case we are indebted to Mr. W. W.\nBaggally, who was acquainted with the principal witnesses\nin the case and has full confidence in their integrity. The\npercipient, Mr. John Polley, writes :\nAt a seance hekl witliin the soinid of Big Ben on\nMay 8th, 1901, there were present Mrs. E. V. M., Mr.\nThomas Atwood, and myself. As Mr. Atwood resumed\nhis seat after dehvering an invocation (about 8.30 p.m.),\nI became aware of a vision, which presented itself on\nthe left of where I was seated. The scene appeared as\nbeing some 5 feet distant from me, and displayed part\nof the interior of a room, viz., that part where the\nstove stood. The fire in the stove was small and dull,\nand close beside it was an overturned chair. In front\nof the fire Avas somethmg that looked Hke a fire-guard\nor clothes-horse, but this was not quite clear to me.\nPlaying or climbmg over this article was a child, who\nfell forward, and, when it regamed its feet, I noticed that\nits dress was on fire.\nI made no reference to the matter at the time, as I\nhad an impression that the vision might be connected\nwith some occurrence in the family of Mrs. M., and I was\naverse to mentioning it for fear of awaking sad memories.\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 55\nAfter some manifestations of movements of the table\nround which we were seated the whole vision was repeated,\nand this time I had an uncontrollable impulse to speak.\nUj)on my describing what I had just seen for the second\ntime, I was much relieved to hear that the matter was\nnot recognised as being connected in any way with the\nsitters. I may mention here that the child appeared\nto be about three years old, and, judging from the style\nof dress, I described it as a girl, although the vision\nwould apply equally well to a boy, as, at that early a.i;e,\nthe short clothes worn by both sexes would be very simiLar.\nNext Thursday morning. May 9th, 1901, upon awakening,\nI described to my wife the events of the previous evening's\nseance. On the evening of the same day, viz., Thursday,\nMay 9th, I was out with a friend, and upon my return\nhome at 11.5 p.m. my sister, Mary Louisa Policy (who resided\nwith me at that time), made the remark, \" I have a\npiece of bad news for you. Jack.\" \"Well,\" I replied,\n\" what is it ? let me know,\" and she answered, \" Brother\nGeorge's little son Jackie has been burned to death.\" Like\na flash I reahsed the connection of the sad event with\nmy vision of the previous night. I then asked her (my\nsister), \" How did you loiow this, and when ?\n\" She\nreplied, \" Mr. Fred Sinnett told me when he came over\nto see us this evening.\" John Polley.\nThe other two sitters confirmed Mr. Policy's statement in\nwriting, and both Mrs. Polley and Mr. Policy's sister furnished\nwritten accounts of their Imowledge of the matter as described\nin Mr. Policy's statement.\nA local paper, which Mr. Baggally has sent us, containing\nan account of the inquest, gives the date of the accident\nas Tuesday, May 7th. The child was taken to a hospital\nimmediately and there died. His father, Mr. F. G. Polley, a\ndecorative jjainter, writes to Mr. Baggally in reply to his\ninquiries as follows :\n6 Adpar Stbeet, Hall Park, Paddington,\nJwne mh, 1901.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your mquiry respecting my late\nson, John Frederick, I beg to say that on Tuesday,\nD\n\f56 3Irs.

Whilst the elder brother\nwas getting some toys for them to play with, the deceased\nthrust some paper in the fire, pulled it out again, and\nset fire to his clothes. Some neighbours took him to\nthe Children's Hospital, Padduigton Green, where he\npassed away on Wednesday, May 8th, at 11.45 a.m. No\nintimation of this was given by myself or any member\nof our family to my brother, Mr. John PoUey, until a\nfriend of the family called at my address on Thursday,\nMay the 9th, between 1 and 2 p.m., when we mformed\nhim of the sad loss we had sustained, and he told us\nhe intended calling on my brother that eveniag, and\nwe asked him if he would communicate the news to\nmy brother and sister, who reside at Church Street,\nStoke-Newmgton. Of course you loiow, sir, I am anta-\ngonistic to your views, but my brother has told me it\nis for the interests of science ; if that is so, I take great\npleasure in its furtherance.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nFrederick George Polley.\nIn a later letter to Mr. Baggally, Mr. F. G. Polley states\nthat there was a fire-guard in the room ; the httle boy did\nnot fall into the fire, but set himself on fire as described\nabove.\nMr. Baggally himself writes further with regard to the case\nas follows :\nDecember 4:th, 1901.\n. . . Mrs. M. is not a medium and does not profess\nto have any mediumistic powers. Mr. John Polley is\naccustomed to have impressions of a so-caUed clairvoyant\nand clairaudient nature, so is Mr. Thomas Atwood, but\nthey are not public mediums. The vision referred to is\nnot unique in the experience of Mr. J. PoUey. ... If I\nrecollect rightly I saw the father of the child, Mr. G. F.\nPolley, on May 22nd, who handed to me the newspaper\nwith the account of the accident. A few days after\nhe sent me his written statement. I obtained the written\nstatements of Mi\". J.

Baggally.\nThe other case of the same sort (M.Cl. 22, Journal,\nVol. v., p. 73) was unfortunately not recorded till more\nthan two and a half years after the event, and there\nare considerable differences in the accounts of the different\nwitnesses, though they agree on the main point. More-\nover the vision as remembered is less detailed than one\ncould wish. As the whole account is long it will perhaps\nsuffice if I only give an abstract of it.\nIn May 1888 four ladies at Denver, Colorada, were\nin the habit of meeting once a week to sit round a\ntable \" to see what would happen,\" one of them, Mrs.\nLogue, being a \" medium so-called,\" though not a pro-\nfessional one, and frequently having impressions and\nvisions. At one of these meetings Mrs. Logue had a\nvision of a man lying very ill and a tall pale lady writing\n\u2014\nwhich vision she distinctly connected with one of the\nladies present, Mrs. T. Mrs. T. did not at the time\nrecognise it ; but the next day she received a letter\nfrom a daughter in Indiana saying her husband was\nseriously iU, and the following day a telegram announced\nhis death. He had died of pneumomia after a very\nshort ilhaess. Mrs. T.'s daughter had been writing a\npost-card to her mother at, or very near, the time of\nthe seance.

If the vision was telepathic\nthe rapport between Mrs. Logue and Mrs. T., due to their\nsitting together, and between Mrs. T. and her daughter\nwho was actvially writing to her at about the time of\nthe vision, may well have furnished a telepathic con-\nnexion such as would produce the vision.\nThere is a case (L. 1152, Journal, Vol. XII., p. 307)\nwhich may, I think, be conveniently considered with\nsemi-experimental telepathic visions, though the percipient\nwas not trying or expecting to see anything, but merely\n\f58 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

Ith, 1900.\nMy dear Dr. Hodgson,\u2014Anent my letter of yesterday let\nme giA^e you a Little experience\u2014my first\u2014with telepathy\nof the hving.\nSome seven or eight years ago my wife's sister, who is\nthe wife of one of the editors of the\n'\n' San Francisco Call\n'\n'\n(newspaper) had an attack of La Grippe. Soon after her\nrecovery she spontaneously developed this faculty in a\nwonderful degree, and in nearly every letter to her sister\n(my wife) she recounted some of her experiences. We were\nall avowed Agnostics. In August of 1895 I had occasion\nto visit San Francisco, and was of course the guest of\nMrs. Adam, my sister-in-law, and her husband. Soon after\nmy arrival I alluded to the subject and asked her to try\nto read 7ny mind. She consented, and, taking my left\nhand m her left, she explained that under these conditions\nshe had the best success, making her mmd as complete a\nblank as it was possible. To this latter end she toyed\naimlessly with a pack of cards lying in her lap\u2014and waited\nfor \"impressions.\" After some time she announced that\nshe got absolutely nothing, and said that with some she\nnever had any success. I remarked that perha])s it was\nbecause I was not thinking of anything persistently or\ndeeply. She replied by telling me to thmk of some\noccurrence of recent date\u2014say some man I had met\u2014his\nname and features. I thought of a gentleman I had met\nthe morning before on the platform at Bakersfield as the\ntrain was changing engines. He stepped up to me,\naccosting me by name and said :\n\" You don't remember\nme, do you ?\n\" I confessed that I did not. He said,\n\" My name is Harris,\" and reminded me that some years\nago when I was Aide-de-Camp to Gen. Howard, he came\nto our Headquarters in S. F. with a letter of introduction\nfrom my brother\u2014and that I gave him a pass on the\nGovernment steamer \" M'Dowall \" for a trip about the bay.\nEven then I could nob recall him.

Presently Mrs. A. said,\n\" His name is of two syllables\u2014accented on the first\n\"\n\u2014\nand then she asked me to signify assent if it was true\n\u2014\nas it seemed to help her. I therefore said \"Yes.\" After\nperhaps ten seconds she said, \" It is a name that sounds\nhke '\nParish,' \" but, she added quickly, \" That's not it\n\"\n\u2014\na sUght pause\n\u2014\" It is Harris.\" I, much astonished, said\nit was\u2014when she added, \" And his initials are '\nC. H.,'\n\"\nor whatever they were (I have now forgotten). I said\nthat I did not loiow what his mitials were. Then she\nbegan to describe the appearance of Mr. Harris, I assenting\nas she went on, and her description was as accurate as\nI could have given. A day or so afterwards she and\nI were going across the Bay to Berkeley to make a call,\nand arrived at the ferry depot just too late to catch the\nboat, and had to wait for the next one. As Ave sat in\nthe waitmg-room I saw this ]\\Ii\\ Harris enter, and at once\nwent to him, shook hands, and brought him over and\nintroduced him to my sister. I told him of the matter\nwherem his name figured ; and before relathig that peivt\nconcemmg his initials, I suddenly said, By the way,\nMr. Harris, what are your initials ? \" He said \" C.

The conversation\nturned upon the subject of telepathy, and this yomig man\nexpressed much doubt of its reality, but begged Mrs. A. to\n\" see if she could get anything \" for him.

I greatly regret that more\ncomplete records have not been kept.\nIn February, 1893, the Olympic Athletic Club of San\nFrancisco gave a fete for the benefit of its treasury, and\nI was asked to take charge of Sybil's booth. I had often\nread character from physiognomy and tricks of manner\ncommon to certain types, but prior to this I had never\ntried telepathy.\nAfter the first evening in the booth I was walking home\nwith a Britisher named Gadsden (now dead). As we\nwalked along he said, \" You don't really think you can\ntell anything, do you ?\n\" I rephed that I claimed to have\nno occult gift whatever.

I chose the question as being one impossible\nfor you to answer miless you could read my mind.\"\nNow, I look on that as a good case of pure mmd-\nreading. I took courage from this experience, and durmg\nthe rest of the fete I mtrepidly read the past and future of\nthose who came to my booth, and often with startlmg\nsuccess, which I attribute, in part, to my own self-assur-\nance.\nSince 1893 I have told thousands of \" fortmies \" by\nimpressions, and probably been successful Avith seventy-five\nout of a hundred. The greater number of trials have been\nwdth contact, though trials mthout contact, while on the\nwhole not so successful, have sometimes given strildng\nresults.\nTwo years ago, at an evenmg at home, I was trying to\nget telepathic results for one of my guests. A strange\nlady, whom one of my friends had brought Avith her, was\nsitting behmd me. I told the gentlenian whose mmd I\nwas trying to read, that he had that day sold a piece of\nland to a man named O'Brien. He rephed that I was\nwrong, as he had no land to sell. The stranger (a lady\nfrom Chicago whom I had never met before) said, \" That\nis very strange, for I sold a piece of land to-day to a man\nnamed O'Brien.\"\nThere was m this case no personal contact.\nOne day during the Spanish-American war, my nephew,\nMr. Chase, and I were watching the departure of some\n[There must, I think, be some mistake here as Bonchurch and\nVentnor are within a mile or two of each other, E.M.S.]\n\f68 Mrs. Heyiry Sidgwick.

Mr. Chase\nasked her name and the place of her birth, to which she\nanswered, \"Mary Smith, and I was bom in Dumfries.\"\nThere was no contact in this case, but in the following\nthe young woman was brushing my hair at the time.\nI was once visitmg a family named Randall, at Hustis-\nford, Wis., and was rather attracted to a pretty servant\ngirl who used to help me with my hair. One day while\n'\nshe was with me I had a strong impression concerning her,\nand asked her if her grandfather was not killed M'hile\ncrossing a river. She said she thought not, at least she\nhad never heard of it. That night she went home to her\nmother (the daughter of a German pioneer), returning the\nnext day very much excited, and saying that her mother\nhad told her it was true ; that her grandfather had been\nlulled by the Indians while crossing the river with a\nboat-load of skins. The girl had no doubt heard the\nstory in her childhood, but had forgotten it.\nI have often turned to travelling companions and told\nthem the month and place of their birth and have gener-\nally succeeded in gettmg their names. But in getting\nnames I usually begin with the number of syllables, place\nthe accent, get the initials, and then the M'hole name.\nThis mode of procedure would lay me open to the charge\nof \" fishing,\" and my owix experience has shown me that\nwhere the \" subject \" was naturally very secretive, I have\ndepended upon clues received m this way.

The\noperator's name is Patteson. I took his hand, and\nimmediately thought of a family of Pattersons whom I had\nknown in girlhood. The head of the house was named\nWilUam and his wife was named Jane. I accordingly told\nthe operator that his father's name was William and his\nmother's name was either Jane or Jenney, to which he\nassented. (I add his testimony below.) These coin-\ncidences are of so frequent an occurrence that they have\nceased to astonish me.\nAs to the sources of my impressions, I will say that\nI fully believe telepathy accounts for many but not all.\nI find that so constant a practice has developed my powers\nof observation and induction so that I have grown to\ndepend upon them more and more. Reading of mdividual\ncharacter dra^vn from a general Itnowledge of the type\nrepresented has always been a great aid to me. Moreover\nI beheve that the \" fishing \" process may become so\nsubtile and so habitual, that, coupled mth a good observa-\ntion and powers of rapid induction, it may be used\nunconsciously. And I have found that the majority of\npeople are obhvious of those slight clues which they\ninvariably give me.\nA middle-aged woman, having a South German accent,\ncame to me at a Church Fair where I had a booth.\nI noticed that she looked like a Luxemberg woman I had\nkno^vn in Europe, that she smelled sUghtly of carbohc acid,\nand that she had the assured air of one who earns her\nUving. I also noted the mevitable marks of worry on her\ncomitenance.\nI told her that she was born m Luxemberg, was a\nwidow, a professional supportmg two daughters, one an\ninvalid, and that she had been brought up in the Catholic\nfaith, to all of which she gave a wondering assent. Why\nshe should have had two children instead of three I don't\nknow, but all the rest was arrived at by observation and\ninduction.\n\f70 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich.

(See Proceedings, Vol. VIII., pp. 362-404 ;\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 71\nalso Journal, Vol. X., p. 30, and Vol. IX. p. 14.) For a\ncase parallel to the present one, in that the finder was\nnot the loser of the object, but one who had helped\nhi a futile search for it, see Proceedings, Vol. XI., p. 397.\nBut though telepathy from the housekeeper seems to me\na plausible hypothesis, others may prefer to suppose\neither subconscious memory or clairvoyance in the perci-\npient himself. Unlike the cases of finding lost objects\njust referred to, this experience appears to have been a\nwaking one like that recounted.

Journal.\n8, Jasper Road, S.E., January \\lth, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014On the 15th of this month my housekeeper\nlost my latch key. She used it m the forenoon of that\nday for coming mto the house, and missed it before she\nhad occasion to go out again. Havmg searched for it in\nvain the best part of yesterday, she came to the conclusion\ntliat when she entered the house she must have left it in\nthe lock and that it had been carried off by a tramp.\nI looked myself for the key in every likely place, and in\nits absence thought my housekeeper's conclusion was\nprobably the right one. Last night I read the account in\nVol. XI. Proceedings S.P.R. , of the lady who lost a book\nwhich was afterwards fomid on \" the blue room bed.\"\nI said to myseK \"I wish I could find that key.\" \"Where\nis it ?\n\" I asked my sublimmal self, and the good\nAnthony, the patron saint of the Lost Property Office\n\u2014\nput these words mto my head :\n\" It's in the kitchen table\ndrawer.\" At breakfast this mornmg my housekeeper said\nshe had not slept all night from worrymg about that latch\nkey. I remarked that I had dreamt it was in the kitchen\ntable drawer. Oh no, sir,\" she replied. \" I've looked\nthere and everywhere.\" I then went mto the kitchen with\nher and opened the table drawer\u2014and there found the key.\nMy housekeeper was certainly as astonished as myself, and\nadmitted that she hadn't looked in that particular drawer\n\f72 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nfor it as she had never j^ut it there before. She supposes\nthat in the present mstance the drawer must have been a\nHttle open when she put her parcels on the table, and that\nthe key at the same moment fell from her hand into it.\n\u2014\nYours faithfully,\nD. H. Wilson.\nWe wrote to Mr. Wilson for additional information ; he\nreplies as follows :\n\u2014\n8, Jasper Road, S.E., January 2'ird, 1898.\nDear Sir,\u2014In reply to your inquiries about the lost\nlatch key incident :\n1. I have never put the key m the kitchen table drawer.\n2. The key is practically for the use of the housekeeper.\nThere is but one latch key, and she keeps it. She is\nalone in the house all day, and requires it to let herself\nin when she goes shopping. She goes to her home at\nnight and takes the key with her. Very rarely I ask her\nto leave the key with me when she is leaving. On\nSaturday last she missed the key when she was on the\npoint of going home at night. She at once told me of it.\nI said \" When did you have it last ?\n\" and she rephed\n\" To let myself in at about midday, and haven't been out\nsince, and no one has been into the house.\" I said \"It\nmust be m the house, have a good look for it to-morrow.\"\nThe next day she looked for it \" everywhere,\"\u2014excejiting\nof course the right place. She says she never jDuts it in\nany drawer. She usually puts it m. her pocket ; occasion-\nally she puts it on the kitchen table or dresser whilst she\nis disposing of her parcels. When she told me on Sunday\nthat she couldn't find the key, I went mto the kitchen to\nlook for it. I cast my eyes over the two dressers, on the\nhooks on theni, and on nails in the walls, and on the\nmats ; but I did not look into any drawer. It is very\nprobable that the housekeeper had rested the key on the\ntable, intending to place it at once in her j)ocket. For-\ngettmg it, she may have later on swept it uito the open\ndrawer. I had httle doubt on Sunday night that the key\n\fLxxxvi.] ExjJerimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 73\nhad been left in the door at midday on Saturday, and had\nbeen carried off by some tramp or mischievous boy, and\nso thought my housekeeper.\u2014Yours faithfully,\nD. H. Wilson.\nI have read Mr. Wilson's accomit of the key and say it\nis quite correct.\n(Signed) Jane Bkiggs.\nThere are two cases which have not, I think, been\npublished, in which the impression emerges through motor\nautomatism\u2014in one of them through table tilting and in\nthe other through an ouija board. In the first (M. Aut.\n104, Journal, Vol. XIII., 35) the experimenters were Mrs.\nSalter (then Miss Verrall) and the Rev. M. A. Bayfield.\nOther table tiltings of theirs have been published in an\narticle by Mrs. Verrall in Proceedings, Vol. XXVI., and else-\nwhere. In this case a message was tilted out apparently\nintended to announce the death of Sir Michael Foster,\nwhich, unknown to the experimenters, had occurred some\nseventeen hours earlier.\n(M. Aut. 104.)\nMiss Verrall writes :\n5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge,\nFebruary 5th, 1907.\nOn Tuesday, January 29th, 1907, at 6 p.m., Mr. Bay-\nfield and I endeavoured to obtain automatic \" messages \"\nby means of table-tiltmg, as we have done on several\nprevious occasions. Since there was no other person m\nthe room, we were compelled to record the messages\nourselves, and consequently to follow them word by word ;\nwe were not, however, able for the most jDart to form any\nexpectation of what the next word was likely to be, and\nour expectations, when we did form any, proved as often\nas not incorrect. It is evident, therefore, that the general\ntenour of the messages can have been little affected by our\nconscious thoughts. The following statement was obtamed ;\nthe questions asked by us are in brackets.\n\fllrs. Henry Sidgwich. [PAET\nFellow of lioyal Society. (What was his name ?) Potter.\n(What about him ?) Died this afternoon. (What time ?\n4.-JfK (Can you tell us more about him ?) Edditor (sic)\nof Physiological Revieio. (Where did he hve ?) London.\n(What address 1) Belsize Gardens, Kensington. (Was he\nmarried ?) Yes. (Had he any children ?) Yes, five.\nAt the time this message conveyed nothing either to\nMr. Bayfield and me or to my father, Dr. Verrall, to whom\nit was showi on Tuesday evening ; we considered it\nindeed of so little value that we discouraged any further\ncommunications on the subject, and tried to direct the\nphenomena mto what we considered more \" evidential\n\"\nchannels.\nWe thought no more of the matter until we heard on\nWecbxesday afternoon of the death of Sir Michael Foster,\nwhich took place, as we learnt by subsequent enquiry,\nearly in the morning of Tuesday, January 29th. It was\nnot, however, publicly announced until Wechiesday, and\non Tuesday was knoAvn in Canibridge only to a very\nsmall number of people, apparently four. That the news\ndid not spread is clearly shown by the fact that it did\nnot appear h\\ any paj^er until Wednesday afternoon. The\nnames of those who are known to have received the news\non Tuesday have been told to us, and it apj)ears certain I\nthat neither Mr. Bayfield nor I can have come into any\nsort of contact with them in the course of that day. If\nthat be so, the \"message\" obtained by us, unless it is\nto be regarded as a mere coincidence, must have been\nobtamed by some other than the normally recognised\nmeans of communication.\nWith regard to the question of coincidence, it may be\nnoted that\u2014settuig aside for the moment details given\nin reply to leaditig questions, which will be considered\nlater\u2014our message can be stated thus : A Fellow of the\nRoyal Society (a), by name Potter (6), and Editor of\nthe Physiological llenieio (c), has died this afternoon (d).\nOf these statements, as applied to Sir Michael Foster,\n(a) is correct ;\n(c) is also correct, except for the discre-\npancyj . between ;^ri?eyie?\u00ab and Journal. \"Sir M. Foster\nfounded and edited the Journal of Physiology.'' (See\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases 75\nobituary notice iii the Times of -Jan. 31.) (6) is not\ncorrect, but tliere is a close resemblance between the\ntwo names, four out of the whole six letters bemg right\nand m the right place. The description (c) is distuictive ;\nthere are only two people to whom it could up to the\npresent ever have been apjihed. Sir M. Foster and the\npresent editor, Professor J. N. Langley, whose name, it\nwill be seen, does not bear the least resemblance to\n\"Potter.\" {a), (6), and (c) combuied would appear there-\nfore to pomt to one man only. Sir M. Foster, who is\nstated to have died on Tuesday afternoon {d), and died\nas a fact on Tuesday morning.\nThe further details given, such as the hour and place\nof death, are almost all mcorrect, but it should be noticed\nthat they were given in reply to leadmg questions, and\nit is my impression, based on previous experience, that\nm the case of automatic messages statements so obtained\nare seldom trustworthy. For instance, 43 Belsize Eoad,\nHampstead, is, as I afterwards remembered, an address\nAvith which I was once famihar \u2022\nthe address given m the\nmessage of January 29th is evidently a variation on\nthis. On the other hand, the three statements numbered\nabove (a), (c), {d), were given either spontaneously or in\nanswer to questions so vague as to alford practically no\nguidance or restriction to the answers, [b) \u2014a partially\ncorrect answer\u2014was, I thmk, given in reply to a definite\nquestion ; but on this point IVIr. Bayfield's recollections\ndilfer from muie ; he thmks that the first question asked\nwas \" What about him 1\n\"\nMr. Bayfield and I have sat for automatic phenomena\nof this kuad on 17 occasions. This is the only time that\nwe have produced a statement that some one had recently\ndied. Helen de G. Vereall.\nStatements follow in the Journal as to what Miss\nVerrall and Mr. Bayfield were doing during the earlier\npart of the day when tlie message was received, showing\nthat they had had no opportunity of hearing the news\nby normal means. Also particulars about the death and\nwhen it was known at Cambridge and a transcript of\n\f76 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthe note made at the time of the whole message tilted\nby the table, are given. I omit these for brevity.\nIt is to be noted that in this case the \" message \"\nwas received by persons who had no special personal\ninterest in it, beyond that of any one connected with\nthe University in which Sir Michael Foster had for some\nthirty-five years played so prominent a part. It belongs\ntherefore to a class of cases of which other instances\nwill be found below among spontaneous cases, where\nit is diificult to point to a particular agent (see below\npp. 344 et seq.).\nIn the Ouija board case, the communicator apparently\npurported to be the dead son of one of the three experi- 1\nmenters, and the \" message \" conveyed a trivial fact\nabout a living son which was both unknown to, and\nunlikely to be guessed by, the sitters (M. Aut. 105,\nJournal, Vol. XIII., pp. 211-217). The case came to us\nfrom the late American Branch of the Society, having\nbeen left among Dr. Hodgson's papers. I abbreviate\nthe narrative considerably.\n(M. Aut. 105.)\nMrs. Booth writing on SejDtember 11, 1896, recounts how\nshe and a friend, Miss Loop, left Gi'eat Barrmgton on June 16\nof that year to stay -with a friend, Mrs. Orcutt, at a place\nabout seven hours' journey away. Mrs. Orcutt had been\nvery kind to Mrs. Booth's dead son Le Roy in his last ilhicss,\nbut tlie ladies had apparently no conscious thought of com-\nniunication from him wlicn on the evening of June 18 they\nsat tlown to amuse themselves with the Ouija board. Mrs.\nOrcutt and Miss Loop had their hands on the board, which\nat once moved rapidly, pointing to letters, but apparently\nat random and so fast that they could not follow it. How-\never, Mrs. Booth got a pencil and paper and put down the\nletters indicated as well as she could, but without deciphering\nwhat was said till the end of the first paragraph. At that\npomt Miss Loop wished to stop, but Mrs. Orcutt caught\nher name and thought somethmg might be coming. So they\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 11\nstarted again, and then caught the words of the last paragraph\nas they came out.

Semi-experimental Cases. Agent Experimenting.\nOf cases in which the agent experiments we have in\nthe collection six\u2014two in which the agent appears\nto the percipient, and four in which the agent influences\nthe percipient from a distance. Of the four latter, one\nis a case of hypnotisation at a distance, described in the\n\f78 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ncoiirse of an article by Professor Alexander of Rio de\nJaneiro, entitled \" Supernormal Phenomena observed during\nHypnotic Treatment by Dr. Alfredo Barcellos of Rio\nde Janeiro.\" Dr. Barcellos was in the habit of vising\nhypnotism for curative purposes, and besides the hypno-\ntisation of his patient E. from a distance, the article\nincludes instances of telepathic clairvoyance and pre-\nmonition exhibited by another patient. I will here\ncontent myself with referring to the article, which is\nprinted in the Journal, Vol. VIII., pp. 88-95 and 99-116.\nThe case of hypnotisation at a distance will be found\nin the first part of the article, with some confirmatory\nevidence in the second part.\nI will quote next two experiments in which a lady\nsucceeded in telepathically inducing a friend to come\nto her. They are included under L. 996, Journal, Vol.\nVII., p. 193, and came to us through the late American\nBranch of tlic Society. It is much to be regretted that\nno note was made of either experiment before its success\nwas known.\n(L. 996.)\nThe agent, Mrs. Lee, Asrites :\nShrewsbury, Mass., December lih, 1891.\nAn interesting exjoeriment I tried last winter. A friend\nof sensitive temperament occupied a room (in a foreign\ncountry) next my own. The connecting door between the\ntwo was closed. The lady was witing (as she afterwards\ntold me). Wishing to see her, I intended to go to her,\nbut as I was comfortably resting on the lounge, I met\nthe recalcitrant disposition to move with the mental\nquestion, \" How long will we be slaves to matter, time\nand space ?\n\" Whereupon it occurred to me to exert a\nstrong mental effort instead of a sUght physical one. In\nabout five minutes it proved successful ! I heard steps\napproaching the door. To my summons in response to\nher rap, she opened the door, \" Did you call me ? I was\nmider the impression that you did, but was not sure\n\fixxxvi.J Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 79\nI heard you.\" I explained. My friend replied that she\nwas conscious of me a moment or two before she put\ndown her pen to come to me.\nMary Holland Lee.\nLi answer to Dr. Hodgson's request for a corroborative\nstatement from the lady on whom the experiment was tried,\nMrs. Lee wrote :\nAugust 22nd, 1893.\nThe answer to your letter I delayed until I heard from\nIVIiss S. I wrote to her to make a statement of the\ntelepathic experiment between us when at Mentone, France.\nI enclose her letter.\nThe letter enclosed was as follows :\nDear Mrs. Lee,\u2014I do remember the time of which\nyou speak, when we were in Mentone, and you drew me\nto you by a httle mental telepathy. I think I was\nwriting to E. D. in my room, which adjoined yours.\nSuddenly my train of thought was broken into by a\nfeeling that I must go to you. I felt that you needed\nme for something, without stopping to think what that\nsomething might be. But I Imew that some mvisible\npower had hold of me, callmg me. I then stepped to\nyour door, and asked you if you had spoken or if you\nwanted anything, and you immediately told me that it\nwas but an experiment on your part to prove the power\nof mmd over matter. It was certainly successfid that\ntime and has been at other times, when we have been\nseparated by miles of distance.\n(Signed) E S ,\n[full name given].\nNo details were given as to the other experiments referred\nto by Miss S., but a similar experiment tried by Mrs. Lee\nin the case of another friend, Mrs. Chenoweth, was related\nby the latter in the Medico-Legal Journal, Vol. L, No. 3,\nJmie, 1893, as follows :\nA lady whom I shall call Mrs. L., my friend since my\nown girlhood, and, with myself, a member of the American\n\f80 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nBranch of the London Society for Psychical Research,\nhad a trifimg experiment in telepathy with me in the\nmonth of August, 1892, which was so simple and successful\nthat it seems worth telhng.\nWe spent the summer in a charming New England\nvillage ; I living near the top of a long hill, and she half\nway down, the houses of both facing ujion the one broad\navenue which makes the main street of the village.\nWe saw one another daily, but on the day in August\nabove referred to, the date of which is mislaid, we had\npassed hours together, and parted near six o'clock iii the\nafternoon, when I went home to tea, averring laughmgly\nat parting that it could not be promised when T should\ncome again, since we could surely think of nothing more\nto say to one another for days.\nAt nine o'clock that evenmg I found my thoughts turn-\ning \\\\ith strange persistence toward Mrs. L. It seemed\nto me that she was in need of me, and I felt impelled to\ngo to her. In vain I argued that if it were a matter\nof importance she would come to me, or send for me.\nThe silent call continued.\nAfter the laj^se of haH-an-hour I turned to a friend,\nand asked if she felt able to waUt down to Mrs. L.'s\nwith me, reluctantly askuig, as she Avas suffering somewhat\nfrom a lame foot. She was mcredulous, and rejjeated\nto me my own assertion that I probably should not go\ndo\\\\'n there agam withm a week. At last I said emphati-\ncall3^ \" It is, indeed, very strange, but I can no longer\nresist the mcLuiation to go and see if anything is wrong\nwith m-s. L.\"\nMy friend accompanied me, with some effort. It was\nnow half-past nine o'clock. We found Mrs. L. sitting\non the piazza alone, in the moonlight.\nShe cried out to me delightedly upon hearing my\nfootsteps ; \"I have spent full half-an-hour callmg to you\nto come.\" C. Van D. Chenoweth.\nMrs. Lee adds :\nThis uistance occurred as herein stated, verbatim et\nlilemiini. Mrs. Mary Holland Lee.\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 81\nThe lady who accompanied Mrs. Chenoweth to ]\\'Ii-s. Lee's\nhouse on this occasion, writes to Dr. Hodgson :\nJuly 25th, 1894.\nI perfectly recall the cii-cumstance referred to in the\nhttle sketches sent you by IVIi's. Chenoweth and Mrs. Lee.\nI Avalked down A\\dth Mrs. Chenoweth to IVIrs. Lee's house\nand heard Mrs. Lee say that she had spent half-an-hour\nin \" wiUing \" the visit.\nIn connexion with these experiments of Mrs. Lee's must\nbe mentioned a \" Diary of Telepathic Impressions\n\"\nprinted in the Journal, Vol. VII., pp. 299-306 and 311-319.\nIt is the telepathic diary for the year 1894 of a certain\nMrs. S. It came to us through Dr. Thomas Duke of\nRugby, who was her medical attendant, and who assured\nus that every word she has written may be depended\non. A good many of the impressions are spontaneous\nones, received by Mrs. S., about what other people are\nthinking or doing\u2014generally in comiexion with herself.\nBut a great many attempts by herself to influence other\npeople at a distance\u2014especially Dr. Duke\u2014to come to\nher, or send things, or do something, are recorded. These\nattempts sometimes failed, as appears from the diary,\nbut much more often succeeded. The incidents are\nalmost all of a trivial character, and almost any one\nof the coincidences, taken alone, might be explained as\nthe result of chance, or lucky guessing, or common\nassociations of ideas. The weight of the record lies in\nthe great number of coincidences\u2014a number which cer-\ntainly seems far beyond what is probable unless telepathy\nwas at work. One could wish that more corroboration\nhad been possilile, but there is some. I do not reproduce\nthe diary here because of its length, but it is, I think,\na record of very considerable importance.\nExperiments in which the agent appears to the per-\ncipient are of course of great interest on account of their\nanalogy to spontaneous apparitions at the time of the death,\nor of a crisis in the liie, of the agent. Accounts of\n\f82 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\na few such cases were printed in the Journal in the\n'eighties and 'nineties (since then none have been received\nby the Society), bnt the best of them are pubhshed\nin Proceedings or the books named above. The two\nthat remain are neither of them very satisfactorily re-\ncorded, while the first also suffers from the wealmess\nthat agent and j)ercipient were in the same room. Never-\ntheless they are both of considerable interest and worth\nquoting.\nIt will be observed that in the first case (L. 851,\nJournal, Vol. IV., p. 323) the agent did not try to appear\nto the percipient ; the aj)parition was the result of his\ntrying to make her think of him. In this it resembles\nthe case of Baron von Schrenck Notzing (see Journal,\nVol. III., J).\n307, and Podniore's book). The account of\nthe case comes to us through the late American Branch.\nI abbreviate it somewhat.\n(L. 851.)\nThe a;jent, Mr. Warner, wites :\n242 W. 4th Street, Cincinnati,\nOhio, November 14, 1887.\nAbout three years ago, or less, my brother, in his\nletter to me, endeavoured to interest me in some pheno-\nmena which had come under his observation. . . . My\nemjjloymeut is that of \" book pressman,\" running two large\nbook presses (Adams) pruitiug school books. The lady\n[Miss Mallou] is one of tAvo female \"feeders\" directly\nunder my charge, one feeder for each press. She has\nheld that position for the last four or five years. She\nis about forty -five years old and intelHgent, right-minded,\nand Idnd-hearted, morally above suspicion.\nOne of the experiments which my brother had suggested\nfor me to try to satisfy myself was to try what the\neffect might be of looking at and thinldng of a person\nat the same time. This is the history of the first experi.\nment.\nDate, early March, 1886 ; time of day, middle of fore-\nnoon : place, press room. Both of my presses stopped\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases.\nat the time and the lady sifctmg with her back turned\ntoward me, at a distance of 15 feet, myself engaged on\nthe second press, in inspecting and carrying away a heap\nof printed paper, she reading the fashion column of a\nnewspaper (as I afterwards learned). Suddenly the\nidea occurred to me, \"Why not try that experiment\nnow ? \" Instantly I turned toward her, concentrating\nmy look upon the centre of the back of her head and\nmentally calling her first name. I remained in that\nposition for five or six seconds, then turned to my work,\nthmking that experiment a failure, as I saw no signs\notherwise. Between 25 and 30 minutes (by the clock)\nafterwards, she arose, and coming toward me with a\nhesitating step and a perplexed half smile on her face,\nsaid, \" Warner, were you trying to make me look at\nyou a while ago?\" \"Well, how long ago?\" said I.\n\"About half an hour ago,\" said she. \"Perhaps I Avas,\"\nsaid I. \"How did I appear to you?\" \" Well,\" said\nshe, \" I wasn't much interested in what I was reading,\nand all at once the letters seemed to rmi togetiier, and\nyour form and face appeared in a A\\avering, unsteady\nway, just to the left, in front of me. You had a smile\non your face, a piece of waste paper in each hand, and\nyour arm seemed to be resting on a table or somethmg.\"\nThis was an equal surprise to both of us at the time,\nalthough since then I have verified it Avith somewhat\nsimilar experiments upon other ladies and repeatedly\nAvith this one.\nLater Mr. Warner adds :\nThe description Avhich Miss Mallou gave of my attitude\n. . Avas in most exact accord Avith the actual facts.\nVery many times since then she has actually seen me\nwithout use of the eyes, while in her vicinity, and when\nmy attention Avas not specially turned toAvards her ;\nat\nother times, at my will, she would \" sense \" me that\nI was looking at her by a perception as of a flood of\nlight coming over her eyes ....\nIn making this experiment I only hoped to call her\nattention, by causing her to feel me or my iirfluence,\n\f84 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich.

I have . . . not, so far, to my Imowledge, succeeded\nin projecting my personal appearance on any other subject\nthan Miss Mallou.\nMiss Mallou, having seen Mr. Warner's account, writes on\nNovember 30, 1887 :\nI do not think it necessary to write more, only to say\nthat Avhat he has written is correct, and I could not\nexplain more fully than he has done. . . .\nShe adds on December 16, 1887 :\nLi answer to your questions of the 8th, I can only\nsay I have always tliought what I have seen has been\nclairvoyantly. ... I have alwaj's (it seems to me) had\nthis ]iower of seeing [hallucinatory figures], but when\nI have told things I have seen, I have been laughed\nat and told it was my imagination. ...

I have not, I think, forgotten\nany detail, for all is still impressed very vividly upon\nmy memory.\nMrs. E. then describes a disturbed night experienced by\nherseK and her daughter Mrs. A., and unexplamed bell ringing\nheard by a maid, and continues :\nOn the Sunday evening after this, some friends were\nI supping with me (my daughter had returned home), and\nbefore we had finished Mr. Rose came in. He drew\na chair to the table and my son said, \" Well, Rose, what\nhave you been doing lately ?\n\" His reply startled me,\nfor he answered, \" My last effort has been trying to send\nmy '\nspook ' here.\" I asked him to explain what he\nmeant and then he told me about it. It was the first\ntime I had lieard that such a thmg was possible, and\nI then told him of the rmging of the bell on that same\nevening.\nThis subject was not discussed again by us as far as\nI can recollect, nor did it impress me particularly ; and\nsome weeks passed, when I was struck down with a bad\nattack of influenza, and again my daughter came to nurse me.\nI had quite recovered, but had not yet been out of\nmy room, but was to go into the drawing-room next\nday. On this particular night, my daughter had gone\nto the theatre and my son remained with me. He had\nbid me good night about half-past ten and gone to his\nroom, and I lay reading, when suddenly a strange creepy\nsensation came over me, and I felt my eyes drawn towards\nthe left hand side of the room. I felt I must look, and\nthere distinct against the curtain was a blue luminous mist.\nI could not for some time move my eyes away, and\nall the time I was really teiTified, for I thought it was\nsomethmg uncanny.

Soon the feehng of fear passed away ; but\nall desire for sleep had also gone, and for a long time I lay\nreading,\u2014when again quite suddenly came the dread and\nthe feeling of awe.\nThis time I was impelled to cast my eyes doAvnward to\nthe side of my bed, and there, creeping upwards towards\nme, was the same blue lummous mist. I was too terrified\nto move, and remember keeping my book straight up\nbefore my face as though to ward off a blow, at the\nsame time exerting all my strength of will and determina-\ntion not to be afraid,\u2014when suddenly, as if with a jerk,\nabove the top of my book came the brow and eyes\nof Mr. Rose. In an mstant all fear left me. I dropped\nmy book with an exclamation not complimentary, for\nthen I laiew that Mr. Rose had been trjdng the same\nthing again. Li one moment mist and face were gone.\nNext morning I told my daughter, and she said she\nhad had the same restless night (though sleeping in\nanother room) as when the bells rang and we had both\nfelt as if something uncanny were in the room.\nThat day Mr. Rose came to see me, and before telling\nhim anything of my experience, I asked him what he\nhad been doing the night before. His answer was,\n\" I went to my room early and concentrated all my\nthoughts in trying to send my astral body here.\"\nI then repeated to him what I have written here, and\nMr. Rose promised he would not experiment on me\nagain, as it made me nervous.\nAn independent account by Mrs. A. Avritten about a week\nearlier corroborates the main points in this narrative. Mrs. A.\nthought the events had occurred two or three years ago.\nThe agent's account of his side of the incident is contained\nin a letter to Mr. Powles, as follows :\n4 Cromwell Crescent, S.W. January I8th, 1896.\nDear Mr. Powles,\u2014The evidence I have to give in\nthe case of \" spirit jirojection \" is A^ery little by itself ;\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Semi-Experimental Cases. 87\nbut as you have heard the story and will have the\nevidence of Mrs. E. and Mrs. A., I shall confine myself\nto that which comes withiii my own Imowledge. As an\nauthor (having written several novels) I am, of course,\nsomewhat imaginative, though I inchne rather to the\nreahstic than to the romantic school. I have also read\nand taken much uiterest in so-called occult phenomena.\nI should also mention that I had mesmerised Mjs. E.\n\\vith more or less success on several occasions before\nmakmg the experiment I am gomg to relate.\nHaving read of cases of spirit projection, I resolved,\nAvithout mentioning the fact to any one, to endeavour\nto send my astral body to Mrs. E. It was about 1891\nor 1892, though my memory for dates is so bad that\nI can't be certain as to the time. This will no doubt\nbe fixed by others. I sat in my bedroom about half past\ntwelve or one o'clock and fixed my will upon the enter-\nprise I had been considering. I carefully imagmed myself\ngomg down the steps of this house, walldiig along the\nstreets, arriving at S. -street, mounting to Mrs. E.'s flat\nand going to her drawing-room and bedroom. I then\nwent to bed \\\\ith my mmd fixed upon the visit I wished\nto make, and soon fell asleep.\nThe next evening I called on Mrs. E., and found her\nwith Mr. and Mrs. A. and some other persons just finishmg\ndinner. I asked her if anything unusual had occurred\non the previous night. She and Mrs. A. told me they\nhad been disturbed, that the servant had heard a bell\nrmg and had come to them in the night, etc., etc. ; but\nI here leave the narrative to them, only mentioning that\nI believe it was an electric bell which the servant heard.\nThe next night I repeated the experiment, and when\nI saw them agam, they told me of its success and begged\nme never to repeat it, as both Mrs. A. and Mrs. E. had\nbeen very much frightened,\u2014the former by the feehng\nthat some one was in the rooni, and the latter by actually\nseemg the upx^er ])art of my face over the top of a book\nwhich she was readmg. I personally was not m any way\nconscious of the success of my attempt, for, so far as I\nremember, I did not even dream about any of the family.\n\f88 Mrs. Henry Sidgwicl'. [part\nI have since tried this experiment with other i^eople, but\nwithout success. I have never again tried it with Mxs. E.\nnor with her daughter.\nI am afraid this is a very inconclusive narrative when\ntaken by itself, but it is all that is absolutely within\nmy own loiowledge. When, however, it is taken in\nconnection with what the two ladies felt and saw, it is\nnot without interest. \u2014Yours suic(^re]y,\nFred. W. Rose.\nIn answer to some questions from Mi'. Powles, Mx. Rose\nwrote :\nJanuary 2lst, 1896.\nIn reply to your note, I did not after my first experi-\nment give notice that I intended to make another. I\nhad tried to mesmerise Mrs. A. when she suffered from\nneuralgia, but without success. I feel sure I did not\ntry lier more than twice, and I had not done so for a\nlong time before the experiments. I did not try hyp-\nnotism upon any other occupant of the house.\nIn answer to our further enquiries about the interval between\nthe two experiments, Mr. Rose explained that by the phrase\n\u2014\n\" The next night I repeated the experiment \"\n\u2014he did not mean\nthat the two experiments occurred on coiisecutive nights. He\nsays, \" I can't now rememl)er what time elapsed between the\ntwo experiments, but I think it was some two or three\nweeks.\"\nSiiice writing his account, Mr. Rose made two more attempts\nto appear to Mrs. E., who was in the south of France at the\ntime. Mrs. E. tells us that on two nights during this period\nshe was wakened suddenly by the feehng that some one\nAvas in the room, and was much alarmed. On the second\noccasion it occurred to her that Mr. Rose was jjerhaps trying\nan exjieriment on her. She wrote shortly after to ask him\nif this was the case ; but unfortunately neither of them had\nnoted the dates, Mr. Rose feeling sure that when Mrs. E.\nwas in a part of France that was imlaiown to him, he would\nnot succeed. It is obvious, therefore, that no stress can be\nlaid on these later experiments, and Mr. Rose tells us that a\n\fLxxxvi.] Experimental and Serm-Exjyerimental Cases. 89\nthird trial, made on February 8th, 1896, was a complete\nfailure.\nFor tlie mode of development of the hallucination here\n\u2014a luminous mist seen first and then the figure\u2014compare\nProceedings, Vol. X., p. 116 (No. 495-6) and other cases\nin Gurney's book and elsewhere.\nThis concludes the experimental and semi-experimental\ncases in our collection. Though they can hardly be\nregarded as a representative group, because of the number\nof telepathic experiments, especially series of experiments,\nexcluded as already published in Proceedings or in the\nbooks mentioned, still those here put together exhibit\nan interesting variety of experiment, and it is much to\nbe desired that their perusal may lead to more people\ntrying whetheii they cannot develop telepathic capacity\nin one way or another.

[part\nCHAPTER II.\nSpontaneous Cases in which the Percipient's\nImpression is not externalised.\nOe cases Avliere the percijjient receives, spontaneously and\napparently through telepathy, a sensation, an idea, an\nemotion, an impulse to action, even a vision in the\nmind's-eye of a scene, l)ut where the impression does\nnot externalise itself as a hallucination of sight, hear-\ning or toucli, there are some thirty-five in our\ncollection, of which five are dreams.^ As a whole the\nclass is not a strong one as evidence of telepathy, because\nin it there is, as Gurney points out, a special danger\nthat (a) after the coincidence is realised the impression\nmay assvime in recollection a definiteness which it did\nnot possess in fact, and that (h) it may be less unusual\nin the percipient's experience than he supposes, owing to\nhis forgetting cases where no coincidence was discovered.\nThe triviality or vagueness of the impressions in many\ncases makes such tricks of memory more likely to occur\nthan they are in connexion with sensory hallucinations.\nNevertheless some at least of these non-hallucinatory\ncases are interesting and suggestive.\n\u00a7 1.

Gurney's book, Ch. II., \u00a7 10). There are three\nsuch cases. The first (L. 1157, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 79)\nwas sent to us by Sir Oliver Lodge, who remarks that it\ncomes \" from a trained experimenter and observer, my\nassistant, Mr. E. E. Robinson.\"\n(L. 1157.)\nThe percipient writes :\nFeenlea, Willow Avenue,\nEdgbaston, December 16, 1905.\nOn Sunday morning, December 10, 1905, I was in bed\nthinlfing of nothing iii particular. Mrs. R. was dressing.\nI experienced an aching pam ui my tliundj, the kind of\npaui that would be produced by a hole (made by some-\nthmg runnmg m).\nThe paia was so distinct, and the sensation of having\na hole in the thumb so real, that I held up my thumb\nto look for it.

This particular source of weakness is absent\nin the following case so far as conscious knowledge is\nconcerned. It is an experience on the border-line between\nsleeping and waking, and may have been a persistent\ndream sensation. (L. 1172, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 284.)\n\f92 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich.

In the next case (L. 1102,\nJournal, Vol. VIII., p. 298) this condition is fulfilled, but,\non the other hand, nearly a year elapsed between experi-\nence and record.

But it is unlikely that there\nwas any such association of ideas in the following case\n(L. 898, Journal, Vol. V., p. 191) when a boy appeared to\ncatch an uniisnal translation of a Greek word from his\nteacher's mind. An account of the incident first appeared\nin the Boston, Evening Transcript aboixt May, 1890, on\nthe day after it occurred, so the correspondent stated.\nThis account is printed in the Journal. In reply to Dr.\nHodgson's encpiiries, the teacher, Mr. Wm.

I was specially struck by\nthe followmg passage, and read it over more than once,\npausing for a time in my reading, bub saying nothing :\n\"If we chvide humanity mto those who do thmgs and\nthose who have to get out of the way when they are\nbeing done, Gainsborough belonged to the latter class.\"\nI remember that my w\\ie came mto the room while my\nattention was fixed on this passage.\nSome hours later, in the evening, we were both readmg,\nwhen my wife said, suddenly, that she felt very sleejiy,\nspeaking m a drowsy tone, and almost immediately she\ndropped off mto a deep sleep. She did not wake up for\nabout two hours. After she had been asleep for some\ntime, she began to speak with the subdued eagerness\nordinary in such cases, saying, \" they are trying . . . they\nare trymg,\" but apparently being unable to say more.\nI leaned forward (I was sitting about 10 feet away)\nand said, in an ordmary tone, \" Yes ? What are they\ntrying to do ?\n\" She answered at once, m the tone of\na person answering such a question :\n\" I'he people that\nhave to be got out of the way of.\" She then nuittered\na few syllables, and was silent until she awoke, I think\nnot less than an hour after. While she Avas speaking,\nand just before and after, she was lying perfectly still\nwith her eyes closed and was certainly asleep.\nThe percipient writes :\nFebruary 10, 1913.\nOn Sunday, Jan. 19th, 1913, my husband and I were\nreading. I was quite mterested in my book ;\nsuckle,dy\n\f100 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nI felt a strong desire for sleep. I had some difficulty\nto keep awake long enough to explain to my husband\nthat I was obUged to go to sleep immediately\u2014an unusual\nthing for me to do.\nI curled up on a sofa and knew nothing more until\nabout two hours later.\nWhen I awoke my husband asked if I had read the\nbook he was reading. (He felt sure I could not have\ndone so, as it had only just been sent to the house.)\nI had not read, or even heard of it.\nHe then told me that he had been struck by a certain\npassage in his book and that in my sleep I repeated a\npart of it, using almost the same words.\nIn reply to a further question, Mrs. Rooke writes :\nFebruary Uth, 1913.\nIn regard to the question you ask, as to whether my\nson ever unconsciously reads or repeats aloud sentences\nthat he is particularly interested in, I can answer without\nany hesitation that I have never Imown him to do so,\nand I feel quite sure that he never does. My daughters\nsay the same, and that they could not imagine him doing\nso ; it would be so mihke himself.\nCompare also with the above cases one (L. 1192, Journal,\nVol. XV., p. 339) where Miss L. \"Jones\" (pseudonym),\nsuffering from concussion of the brain, seemed during\nher illness to have constantly correct impressions of\nthoughts in her sister's mind. . -\n\u00a7 3. Emotion Transferred.\nThere are two cases where, not an idea, but an emotion\nappears to have been transferred. In the first a child\nof six shared an entirely baseless anxiety felt by his\nfather. Most of us would probably be ready to admit\nthat emotions such as fear are easily caught by children\nand animals, but generally, if telepathy has anything to\ndo with this, the fact is veiled by the presence of sensory\nindications. The interest of the present case (L, 1186,\n\flxxx\"st:.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression not Externalised. 101\nJournal, Vol. XV., p. 188) lies in the apparent impossi-\nbility of any sensory indications having operated.^ The\ncase was sent to us by Mr. F. M. J. Stratton of Gonville\nand Gains College, Cambridge, who writes in sending it :\n(L. 1186.)\nNov. 20th, 1911.\nProfessor and Mrs. Newall, from whom I heard the\nstory, both assured me that the A\\'ritten accomit (dated\nNovember 10) agreed entirely with the story told them\nwhen Dr. Hutchmson was visiting them on Oct. 14.\n]VIr. Hutchinson writes :\nSt. Anke's, Lowestoft,\nNov. 10th, 1911.\nDear Mrs. Newall,\nI forward you the few notes you Avish for, but I trust\nyou will forgive me for havmg been so long ui sendmg\nthem. I plead the usual excuse of overwork. |^\nOn the Idnd mvitation of Professor Newall to see the\nObservatory at Cambridge, I decided to motor over from\nLowestoft on Saturday, 14th October.\nOn Friday\u2014the day previous to the trip\u2014I had an\nunaccountable restless feelmg that some disaster would\ntake place on the journey. So strong did this feelmg\nbecome that I decided to msure myself and car agamst\nall risk before vmdertaking the trij). I had some difficulty\nin effectmg this insurance, as the time was short ; ho\\\\ ever,\nthe agents were able to put the matter through for me,\nand I had my pohcy complete by 8.30 p.m. the same\nevening.\nAs I only had a very short time to spend in Cambridge,\nI decided to start from my house at 5 o'clock m the\nmorning.\nI awoke at 4.15 a.m., and immediately started to dress,\nbut before completmg my toilet I heard my son (a little\nfeUow of six years old) crying for me m a most piteous\nmanner.\n1 It may be observed incidentally that the case is one of unfulfilled\npremonition.\n\f102 Mrs. Henry SidgiLncl-. [part\nI went upstairs to see \\\\m\\\u2014as he sleeps m a room by\nhimself at the top of the house\u2014and he immediately\nthrew his arms round my neck, hugging me tightly and\nbegging me not to undertake the journey. I told him\nnot to be foolish, as I should be back with him the next\nday. I was unable to comfort him, so I brought him\ndown to his mother, and I imderstand from her that soon\nafter my dej^arture he Avent off to sleep.\nI might state here that it was a most unusual thing\nfor the boy to wake up at that hour of the mornuig, nor\nhad he been told anything very much about my intended\ntrip.\nAs regards my journey to Cambridge and back, it was\nentirely uneventful, and I am unable to account in any\nway for the curious and ]5ersistent feehng I had that a\ncalamity of some kind would take place during my absence\nfrom home.\nI might ponit out that I have driven a motor-car for\nover ten years and have never taken out an insurance\npolicy before, and would not have done so now except\nfor the above related facts.\nDuring the past ten years I have driven all over England\nand Scotland, and have never met with an accident, nor\nhad the same jieculiar apprehension before undertaldng\na journey.\u2014Yours very sincerely,\nDonald Hutchinson.\nIn reply to Mr. iStratton's enipiiries Mr. Hutchinson wrote\nto him :\nNov. mil, 1911.\n. . . With regard to your query re my son, I can say\nxmhesitatmgly that he knew nothing whatever regarding\nmy forebodings, as I had been particularly careful not\neven to mention them to my wife. . . .\nDonald Hutchinson.\nIn the second case of what looks like transferred emotion\n(L. 899, Journal, Vol. V., p. 192) the correspondence be-\ntween the feelings of agent and percipient is less definite,\nand can indeed hardly be said to amount to more than\nmental disturbance in both, that of the percipient being\n\fLxxxvi.] Spoutcnieoiis Cases : Impression vot Externalised . 103\npossibly caused hy normal observation of symptoms\nof it in the agent. At the same time the ease suggests\nthat there may well be something more than observation\nthrough the senses in producing our impressions of each\nother. The record was sent to us by the percipient,\nMrs. Joseph Pfirshing of C^hicago. It is undated, but\nwas printed in the Journal about two years after the\noccurrence. I will describe the case briefly.\n(L. 899.)\nThe supposed agent, a stranger to the percipient, accom-\npanied his family to an evening party at the percipient's\nhouse on the evening on which he (the agent) knew that his\nemployers had discovered he was an embezzler. A week later\nhe committed suicide. His feehngs that evening can only\nbe conjectured. Hers (tlie percipient's) appear to have been\nfeehngs of miaccoimtable cUstress and rejiulsion m connexion\nwith the young man, and her mental distress continued more\nor less till the suicide. Evidentially in this case everythmg\nturns on tlie uniqueness of the percipient's sensations, and\nof this it is ahnost impossible to judge. She says herself m\nanswer to enquiries :\n\" I have never had such a vivid sensation about a\nperson before. . . . Its reaUty Avas so quickly carried\nout in the denouement\u2014perhaj^s that is the reason it was\nso strongly impressed upon me. I have all my life been\nstrongly attracted or strongly repelled by people.\"\nWith this case may be compared an experience described\nby Miss Alice MacLellan of Bridgeport, Conn., U.S.A., in\nthe Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 173. It is Number VI. of\na series of experiences consisting of premonitory dreams\nand others, recorded apparently in 1919. In this par-\nticular case she attempted in 1915 to read by palmistry\nthe hand of an old friend. It puzzled her, but finally\nshe said, \" It's not like you at all ! Why you've got\nthe hand of a crook.\" A few years later he committed\nsuicide when he could no longer conceal his embezzle-\nments from estates of which he was trustee, embezzle-\n\f104 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

Idea from Distant Agent.\nIn the cases so far dealt with in this chapter, the\nagent and percipient have generally been together. In\nthe remaining cases they were separated. In the first\ntwo, a definite thought in the agent's mind is reflected\nin the percipient's and connected with the distant agent.\nWe received the first (L. 831, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 179)\nfrom the Rev. A. T. Fryer, who wrote on April 19th, 1889 :\n(L. 831.)\nI know the two persons who have written the enclosed.\nI have seen the envelopes and they bear the dates,\nFebruary 13th and February 15tli, 1889, posted January\n31st and February 4th respectively, as shown by post\nmarks. I can voucli for the truth-telling capacities of\nthe percipient and her mother.\nE. M.'s Narrative.\nVery early on Simday morning, February 3rd, when\nhalf asleep, half awake, I became vaguely conscious that\na gentleman I laaow Hving in America was trying to\ninfluence me in some way. This feeling at once thoroughly\nwoke me up, and I seemed to know that Mr. was\nthhiking of me at that time, and that he was sending\nme a proposal.\nVarious circumstances made this most unlikely, one\nbemg tlie fact that I believed him cither to be engaged,\nor on the point of being engaged to an American lady.\nSo I tried to go to sleep again, and did all I could not\nto think of the impression I had received. But it was\nno use, a stronger will than mine ke23t forcuig my thoughts\nto America, and I felt certain a letter was coming.\nFor 13 days and niglits tliis conviction seemed ever\npresent with me\u2014try as I \\vould not to dwell upon it.\nNot even receiving on the 13th a letter from this very\ngentleman, tellmg me that as I had refused to marry him\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression not Externalised. 105\nthe previous autumn he had- at last fully made up his\nmind to propose to an American girl, and to be married\nvery shortly\u2014altered my conviction.\nOn February 15th I received the letter of proposal,\nsaying that at the last moment he could not propose\nto the American, and would ask me once more. The\nletter was Avritten late on Saturday evening, February 2nd\n(allowing for difference m time between America and\nEngland at the very time I had the impression that a\nletter was being written). It was posted on the 4th.\nMy mother remembers my telling her of my impression\nbefore I received the letter.\nStatement fkom E. M.'s Mother.\nI remember \" E.

M. to Mr. Fryer's Questions.\n1. Corroborative statement ? \u2014I enclose my mother's.\nI mentioned my presentiment to no one else excej^t to\nyou. I told my mother on February 13th, when I\nreceived the first letter (which I showed her), that I had\na presentiment that a letter of proposal was on its way\nto me from Mr. .\n2. May I see the two envelojies ? \u2014Envelopes enclosed.\nThe first letter was written January 31st, the second A^as\ndated February 2nd, 11 p.m.\n3. Have you ever had any similar experience ? \u2014Yes, on\nthree occasions, but I cannot get them corroborated, as\nmy brother and the friends concerned object to answermg\nquestions on the subject. The first time was during\nAugust, 1879. I was away from home, and was just\nrecovering from an illness. I awoke one night feeling\n\f106 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc. [part\ncertain that my only brother A\\'as in a railway accident.\nI immediately lighted a candle and looked at my watch\n\u2014eight minutes to 12\u2014as I did so I felt that he was\nunhurt, and that all danger was over. The next day\nmy brother unexpectedly arrived, and I found that he\nhad been in a slight railway accident the night before.\nThe accident took place a few minutes before midnight,\nas he also had looked at his watch. The second time,\nFebruary 27th, 1885. A strong conviction that something\n(I linew not what) utterly unexpected would arise on or\nbefore May 21st that would cause unhappiness to two\npeople and entirely alter the course of their Uves. I\nmentioned this a day or two after to the person chiefly\nconcerned, in the hope that Avhatever it was it might be\navei-ted. This person only laughed at it, and as late as\nMay 20t]i declared it could not come true\u2014it was pure\nimaghiation on my part. It came true on the 21st.\nThe third time, September, 188.5, that a great friend of\nmine, of A\\hom I liad not heard for some time, was\nstaying in a certain place in lodgings, and ^\\-as at the\ntime very unhappy and worried. This also proved to\nbe true.\n4. Can you say how long before February 3rd you had\nheard from or of him |\ntlie gentleman in America] ? \u2014No\none had mentioned his name to me for ^^eeks, but I had\nhad a few lines from him during January.\n5. Had you talked about him or read any letters from\nor about him on or about the 1st or 2nd of February,\n1889 ?\u2014No.\n6. Were you m ordinary health ? \u2014Yes. I always have\nmore or less constant headache, and my headaches had\nbeen very severe just before\u2014but were better at the\ntime.\n7. What initials ?~E.

Sonnetimes he has hold of my shoulder. For\nsome minutes after I am awake I still seem to see and\nfeel him, his hot breath commg on my face. I try and\nlaiock his arm on one side, and it goes through him.\nAfter about two minutes he gradually fades away. It is\nalways the same face, and I cannot\u2014suice I first had the\ndream about six years ago\u2014concj^uer my horror of red-\nheaded men, though I have never seen any man hke the\nman I see ; I have tried movmg my bed to another\npart of the room, but the dream still comes.\nThe other case (L. 1213, Journal, Vol. XVIII., p. 56) of\na thought or wish api^arently transferred from a distant\nagent comes to us through Mr. G. Lowes Dickinson, whose\nsister was the percipient. Miss Dickinson writes :\n(L. 1213.)\n11 Edwaedes Square, W. 8.\n{April 3, 1917.] ^\nOn Thursday, March 29th, 1917, I was upstairs at 8.30\na.m., and the front-door bell rang.

I did not Imow my aunt was ill; she was only taken\nill the night before.\n2. My cousin had not sent for me sijice March or\nApril, 1916.\nJanet L.

Motor Impulse.\nThere are in our collection three cases in which the\npercipient receives a motor impulse\u2014an impulse to do\nsomething. Unfortunately in the first two of these the\ninterval between event and record is just at our limit\nof five years, though there is some contemporary evidence\nin the second case.\nIn the first of the three cases (L. 893, Journal, Vol. V.,\np. 172) the percipient writes :\n(L. 893.)\nFriday, March iWi [1891].\nI am at present an undergraduate of Trinity College,\nCambridge. At the time the incident occurred I was a\nRugby boy. I was at home for the hohdays during the\nsummer of 1886. I thmk the month was August. I was\nemployed m reading for an Indian prize given at school ;\nconsequently, on the occasion of a tennis party given at\nour house, the Rectory of Great RoUright, Chippmg Norton,\nOxfordshire, I did not go out with the rest when they\nwent down to our tennis court, which is about 200 yards\noff, but stayed inside the house reading Holmes' Indian\nMutiny. My mother had gone out with the rest to the\n\filO 3Irs. Henry Sidgioick. [part\ntennis ground. Feeling it cold, she sent my youngest\nbrother, H., for her white shawl. I met him halfway\nbetween the tennis ground and the house carrying the\naforesaid sha^\\'l [myself]. The reasons for this were :\nat the time that my mother asked my brother to get her\nthe shawl, I felt an impression that I nuist do something.\nThis graduall}^ increased in intensity till 1 Imew that\nmy mother wanted a shawl ;\nthen, as if by another stage\nof completer intuition, I knew it ^^^as a white shawl,\nand I knew that I had to go to the drawing-room to\nfetch it (though I did not previously Imow it was there).\nSo I went and fetched it and brought it to my mother,\nas I felt ol)Hged to do. She and my brother were, of\ncourse, greatly surprised, and I remember asking her\nwhether she had thought of me in connection with the\nshawl, or wished me in any way especially to fetch it.\nShe responded in the negative, which makes the matter\nmore curious. The call Avas distmct and imperative, and\naltogether unlike anything else I have ever experienced.\nI have never seen phantasmagoria, &c., or had any other\nstrange exjDeriences of the sort before or since.\nVernon H.

It is a death coincidence.\nThe piece was a favourite of a friend of the percipient's\nwho had made her promise that if possible she would\nplay it to her on her death-bed. The percipient did\nnot often play it, and on the evening when, as she says,\n\" Suddenly and unconsciously to myself I found myself\nplaying \" it, and consequently thinking of her friend, she\nwas not even aware that the friend, Avho died that\nevening, was ill. We do not know that the dying agent\n\fIKi Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nhad the music or the percipieiat in mind, but for the\nlatter the association of the music with the idea of the\nagent's death was close. The case was sent to Mr.\nMyers, who knew the percipient, about eight months after\nthe occurrence.\n\u00a7 6. Imiwessimis of Danger.\nThe two experiences to be next described are of a\nvaguer kind\u2014impressions of calamity or impending danger\nnot connected by the percipient at the time with any\nparticular agent. In the first (L. 990, Journal, Vol. VIL,\np. 120) the percipient describes an \"indefinable dread\namounting to positive terror \" on the day on which, as\nit proved, her brother was taken seriously ill as the\nresult of an accident. Unfortunately the narrative,\nthough the record was made only a few months after\nthe experience, is not very complete, and does not tell\nus when the accident occurred and whether the impression\nbegan before it and was thus premonitory or not.\nThe second case (L. 1142, Journal, Vol. XL, p. 323) de-\nscribing a feeling of impending danger, which was possibly\nthe result of telejiathy from a dog, and certainly led\nto the discovery of its perilous condition, is of interest\nas bearing on the question whether animals can be in\ntelepathic communication with men.^\n(L. 1142.)\nThe case was sent to us by Mr. J.

I had undressed and was\nabout getting into bed, when an unaccountable feeling\ncame over me of impending danger. I could think of\nnothing possible but Fire, and the impression was so\nstrong that I yielded to it and actually dressed again,\nand went downstairs and examined each room to satisfy\nmyself that all was right. When I got to the scullery\nI missed Fido, and thinking he had slipped by me un-\nobserved to go upstairs, I immediately began to call\nhim, but getting no response, I called to my sister-in-law\nto know if she had heard him, and getting an answer in\nthe negative, I began to feel excited, and rushed back\nto the scullery again, and called repeatedly, but not a\nsound could be heard. What to do I did not know.\nIt then occurred to me that if anything will get him to\nrespond it will be the sentence, \" Come for a walk, Fido,\"\nwhich always gave him delight. As soon as I had re-\npeated this sentence, I heard a faint cry, muftied as if\ndistant ;\ncalling again, the cry of a dog in distress came\nplainly. I eventually traced it to the tlue [at a point\nmarked in the sketch], where the flue uniting the boiler\nwith chimney runs. For the moment I could not think\nhow I could get him out ; moments were precious, life\nwas in danger. I took a pickaxe and soon tore down\na portion of the wall, when with some difficulty I drew\nhim out half-dead, panting, vomiting, tongue and body\nblack with soot ;\nmy pet would soon have been dead, and\nas the boiler is only used occasionally, I should never\nhave known Avhat had become of him. Hearing the\nnoise my sister-in-law came to the scene. We found a\nrat-hole in the fireplace which led to the flue. Fido had\nevidently chased the rat into the flue and could not turn\nor retreat. ...

In reply to questions as to\nthe possibility of his having heard any sounds made by the\ndog before he went downstairs, he writes :\nNovember I9th, 1904.\n. . . Be Dog. As suggested by you 1 will give you a\nfew more particulars relating to this. I think you will\nat once see the utter impossibility of any sounds reaching\nme, unless they had been veri\/ loud, and even then my\nsister-in-law, who sleej^s nearer the dog than I do, would\nhave noticed it. Tn fact she enquired as I was crossing\nthe landing to go down, where I was going ; when I\nreplied that \" I felt as if something was going to happen,\nand feared it might be fire.\" I may here remark that as\nI passed from room to room, I began to accuse myself\nfor being so silly as to imagine any danger. However,\nI went on looking for something, not having the slightest\nidea of what to expect. From that time, until I read\nRider Haggard's dream, I put it down to an intelligence\noutside myself that had prompted me to go down. The\ntelepathic theory now takes its place, especially taking\ninto consideration the devotion of the dog, for, if possible,\nhe will not allow me out of his sight, and in my absence\nis qiiite a different dog. . . .\nIn reply to query (1), Yes.

Young enclosed rough\nplans of his house, showing his bedroom at the front, and on\nthe opposite side of the house from the scullery, which is at\nthe back. The bedroom is on the first floor and the scullery\nin the basement, the ground floor intervening between them.\nThere were also three doors, all shut and locked, between\nthe interiors of the two rooms, namely, the doors of the rooms\nthemselves and a third door at the top of the lowest flight\nof stairs leading down to the basement. Under these ckcum-\nstances, it is very difficult to suppose that Mr. Young could\nhave heard any sounds from the dog imprisoned in the flue.\nWe may take next a case where misfortune was averted\nby acting on the impression which was quite definite,\nbut where we cannot point with any certainty to a\nparticular agent (P. 285, Journal, Vol. XVI., p. 29). The\npercipient had, however, been in the company of several\nmen who may have anticipated danger.\n(P. 285.)\nThe account was sent to Sir Oliver Lodge by Mr. John\nA. A. Williams, of Aberglaslyn Hall, Beddgelert, North Wales,\nin a letter dated October 31st, 1912 :\nI have often thought of writing to tell you the following\nfacts. The story got into some of the papers, and I\nsaw an account of it in the Liverpool Courier which was\nnot quite correct. Until last year I was the jDrincipal\nproprietor of one of the largest slate quarries m .\nI used to go up there occasionally to look round with\nthe Manager, who had the charge of them. On Nov.\n25th, 1910, I went up with my brother, and we both went\nround with the Manager. On our rettun in the motor,\nmy brother was telling me about a \" shoot \" he had\nbeen to, and I was listening attentively, as it was about\n\f120 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\na mutual friend. In the middle of his telling me, I had\na sort of message, and seemed to see a certain portion\nof the quarry and the men in great danger. I interrupted\nmy brother and said, \" Excuse me interrupting you, but\nI have had the most extraordinary message, that those\neight men we saw working are in danger.\" He said,\n\" But what do you know about it ? The men have\nworked in the quarry for many years, and they would\nknow if it were dangerous ; also the Manager and sub-\nagents have been there many years and know the ground\nwell.\" I said, \" I don't care. I shall stop at Post\nOffice (after dropping my brother) and will wire to the\nManager to stop them working.\" My brother said, \" He\nwill think you have gone perfectly mad,\" and that I\nhad never interfered with the working, etc., etc. ; how-\never, I did stop and I sent the wire. The Manager went\nto the eight (or ten) men and said to the men, \"It is\nan extraordinary thing, I have received a wire, etc., from\nMr. Williams. I cannot understand it, but you must\nstop working at once,\" and the men were equally surprised\nand took up their tools and left the ground. About half\nan hour to three-quarters of an hour [later], the whole\nof that ground fell to the bottom of the quarry, about\n120 yards, and all the debris from above fell on top ;\nnothing could have saved them\u2014no warnmg. In the\nmorning I had several telegrams, one from the agent,\nsaying, \" good thing you sent wire, as all the ground gave\nway shortly after the men left,\" and I had others to the\nsame effect. When I received them I lay on the sofa\nfor a long time in a highly nervous state, quite overcome.\nWhen I went up to the quarry the next day to see the\nground, one of the men came to me on behalf of the\nothers, to thank me for saving their lives.\nJohn A. A. Williams.\nThrough the efforts of Mr. J. Ai'thur HiU, who kindly\nundertook to collect the evidence for this case, the original\nletters written to Mr. Williams next day by his brother, and\nby the agent and manager of the quarry, were put into our\nhands, and we give below copies of them :\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Gases : Impression not Externalised. 121\n(1) From the Agent.\n.\n.

For a length of about 20 yards\nthe ground where we and the men stood had all shpped\naway, so that it is now not possible to walk the whole\nlength of that side as we did yesterday. We had to\ndescend from close to the eating shed. Part of the wall\nhas also gone, exposing the piles : still there is no leakage\nof water from the lake. The men are clearing right well\nfrom both ends. We can only hope that the water will\nkeep away for a little while, until a temporary bit of\nI\ndam can be made there.

[part\n(3) From Mr. Williams's brother.\nMonday [Nov. 28, 1910],\nThis morning I drove to the quarry. Tlie position now\nseems to me to be much more favourable than it was on\nSaturday. There are no cracks known to exist in the\nface of the rocks. The gravel will keep dropping until\na natural face is formed. I certainly feel to-night that,\nbarring a big flood in the next fortnight, water will not\nflood the quarry. G and all the men are doing their\nvery best to clear down to the virgin soil in the lowest\nwater level part, and I am sure if you could motor up\nagain they would all be very glad to see you, and I am\nsure your mind would be as much relieved as mine is\nthis evening. It is well you sent that wire. I forgot\nto ask how much warnmg that part gave\u2014probably not\nmuch.\nIn reply to a question from Mr. HiU as to whether there\nwas any apparent danger of such an accident happening, Mr.\nWilliams wrote :\nNov. 3, 1912.\nThere is always danger [in] working in those quarries\nwhere the sides are perpendicular for over 100 yards.\nThere were no indications of any unusual danger, as my\nbrother could bear me out. I both spoke to the agent\nthat day and also to the sub-agent, that on no account\nwas any risk to be run, if the place showed any indica-\ntions of danger, and they both said they would not run\nthe risk, neither would the men. . . . The Manager and\nmen knew the ground well and they would not run any\nrisk (unnecessary).\nYou will notice my Manager says in his letter, \" I was\nvery glad to have your wire, as I was anxious about the\nsafety of the men.\" Why did he say that in his letter\nwhen he told us both that it was quite safe and when I\ntold him not to run any risk ? . . .\nThe discrepancy pointed out by Mr. Williams is perhaps to\nbe explained by supposing that the Manager, after the cata-\nstrophe, blamed himself for not foreseeing it and imagined\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases: Impression not Externalised. 123\nthat he had felt an anxiety beforehand, for which there seems\nto have been no adequate ground. In situations of tliis kind,\nthere may often be subconscious anxiety in the minds of the\npersons concerned. It is conceivable that some such feeling\nin the Manager impressed Mi-. Williams telepathically, and\ncaused him to send the telegram. It is also conceivable that\nMl\". Williams subconsciously noticed some indications of danger\nwhen he visited the quarry, and that this gave rise later to\nhis sudden imj)ulse to send the telegram.\nIn the letter just quoted, Mr. Williams gives two rough\ndrawings of a section through the quarry, showing the jDosition\nof the ground before and after the accident. The height of\nthe gallery on wliicli the men were working is given as 340\nfeet from the bottom of the quarry.\nWith a view to obtaining further evidence as to Avhether\nthere was any reasonable ground for exjjecting an accident,\nIVIi-. Williams, who has taken a great deal of trouble to pro-\nvide us with all the information possible, m-ote to his brother\nto ask for his present recollections of the incident, and sent\nus his reply, which seems to sliow that at least neither of\nthe brothers was at all anxious about the condition of the\nquarry.\nThe letter is as folIoAvs ;\nDec. 31, 1912.\nMy recollection of what occurred on Nov. 24th, 1910,\nwhen you and I were returnuig from the quarry in a\nmotor is that when passing about nine miles from\nthe quarry, and I was telling you about a shoot that I\nhad been to, you suddenly interrupted me and said some-\nthing to the following effect :\n\" Whilst you v\/ere talking\nI had a curious sort of message that those men are in\ndanger, and that I shall send a whe to stop them working\nwhen I get to ,\" and you went to the Post Office\nthere and sent the telegram to G instructing him to\nimmediately stop the men.\nThe date Nov. 24, 1910, here given, is obviously a slip, as\nthe contemporary letters show that it was on Nov. 25, 1910,\nthat the accident occurred.\n\f124 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich.

Vague hut insistent thought of Agent.\nIn the last-mentioned three cases it has been the idea\nof the event and not that of the agent that has been\napparently transferred, however vaguely. In the next\ntwo, what reaches the percipient is nothing but the\nidea of the agent. The first of the two (L. 972, Journal,\nVol. VI., p. 212)\u2014if not a mere coincidence, which is\nperhaps the most probable hypothesis\u2014has the interest\nof a sort of semi-reciprocality about it, the proximity,\nunknown to either, of agent and percipient being the\nonly cause suggested for the percipient's thought of\nthe agent, and this thought leading possibly to the\nagent's thinking of the percipient some hours later.\n(L. 972.)\nThe account comes from Mi's. WaUier, 319, Hagley-road,\nEdgbastou, Birmingham. It was eiiclosed in a letter dated\nNovember 15th, 1893, but Mrs. Walker tells us that it was\nwritten some time earlier.\nOn September 10th, 1892, I was waUdng by myself\nalong a road near our home, hastening to join my husband,\nto look over a new house which we thought might suit\nus. My mind was completely absorbed in mental measure-\nments and arrangement of rooms\u2014weighing questions of\nrent, exjoenses, and sleeping accommodation, etc., etc.,\nso that I scarcely noticed anything by the way. Sud-\ndenly the whole train of thought vanished from my mind,\nand was replaced by a mental picture of a little boy\nabout 12, whom formerly I used occasionally to notice\nabout in our parish at various meetings, but whom I\n[had] not seen for more than a year, and certainly (as\nfar as I could remember) had never thought of, or in-\nquired about, since. I did not know him well, but had\nmerely spoken to him once or twice, as one amongst\nhundreds of our school children, though he had so far\nimpressed me that I should have described him as a\nrather original little fellow, and better educated than most.\nHowever, busy and preoccuj^ied as I was that morning\nJoey Fisher suddenly, without the slightest cause or outside\n\fLXXxvi.] Spontaneous Gases : Impression 7iot Externalised. 125\nsuggestion, obtruded himself upon my mind, so that I\nbegan to wonder what had become of the lad, as I had\nneither seen nor heard anything of him for about a year.\nHis face seemed to rise up before me, and the thought\nof him occupied my mind for a minute or two. I was\nthen passing along a road separated by a high hedge\nfrom the Rotton Park Reservoir, and can remember the\nvery place where I began to think of the boy, and where,\non coming in sight of the turn in the road that led to the\nnew house, my thoughts seemed to jump back to the\nabsorbing subject of interest with regard to the decision\nwe had to make at once about the house. I thought no\nmore about it until, early in the evening, a parcel con-\ntaining a large pilie was brought in to me from Joey\nFisher. I was still more surprised when, coming back\nfrom a parish meeting later the same evening, I happened\nto meet the boy in the street, and learned that he had\ncaught the pike himself that day in our Reservoir, and\nhad been standing fishing down below the road at the\nexact time I had passed (but quite out of sight of the\nroad). I asked, \" What made him thinlc of sending it\nto me ?\n\" He rephed, \" I don't know ; it seemed to\ncome into my mind all at once, '\nI wonder if Mrs. Walker\nwould like this fish ?\n'\nSo I asked at home if I might\ntake it you, and went up with it in the evening.\"\nAfterwards I thought it, at any rate, such a curious\ncoincidence that I asked the boy to write it down, which\nhe did, and I enclose his short account.\nI may add that I had never imagined in any way either\nthat he could fish or would be likely to be at the Reser-\nvoir. In fact, the boy had scarcely ever entered into my\nconsciousness, until he suddenly that morning seemed to\nspring up before my mental vision, displacing an absorbing\ntrain of thought, just when, unknown to each other, we\nwere very near together.

I caught one in the morning,\nand before going home to dinner I threw in several lines,\nand when I returned in the afternoon I stood for a time\non the feeder bridge, watching the smaller fish, when I\nnoticed an unusual flutter in the water just about the\nspot where in the morning I had put in the lines ; I got\nmy drag and was very surprised to find I had caught\nanother pike. I was very pleased and wondered what I\nshould do Avith it, and suddenly I thought, how would\ni\\'Ii's. Walker like it. When I got home my sister made it\ninto a j)arcel and I took it to Mi-s. WaU^er in the evening ;\nthe same night I hapj^ened to meet Mrs. Walker in the\nCrescent ; she said she was very pleased with it and\nthanked me [and said] how singular it was that at the\nvery time I was thinking what to do with the pike, she\nwas the other side of the Reservoir thinking of me, and\nwondering where I was, as she had not seen me for so long.\nBerea, Gillot-road.

I added that I was so much\nimpressed- by the frequent recurrence of these thoughts\nthat, had there been any tendency to superstition about\nme, I should probably have expected to hear that some-\nthing had happened to one or both of them. My niece\nand I smiled at the very suggestion !\nOn the following Friday, to my surprise, I received a copy\nof the D Daily Telegraph in which was the account\nof the tragic death of Mrs. C. from burning, which occurred\nearly in the mornmg of Suiiday, Dec. 7th. Her nightdress\ncaught fire as she was lighting a candle to ascertain the\ntime by her watch. The doctor at the inquest reported\nthat death had ensued very shortly after the accident,\nand was mainly due to shock.\nMr. and Mrs. C. were 86 years of age.\nMiss W. corroborates Mr. Parker's statement as follows in\na letter received by Mr. Ivitchener on January 5th, 1914 :\nOn Sunday, Dec. 7th, [1913], at lunch time, my uncle\nspoke to me about a Mr. and Mrs. C, saying he had\nbeen thinliing all the morning about them. I had never\nheard him mention them before, and did not know of\ntheir existence.\nThen again at supper time he spoke of them and said\nthat, if he had been of at aU a superstitious nature, he\nsupposed he should have expected to hear something about\nthem within the next few days.\nOn the following Friday he received a cutting from a\nD newspaper with an account of Mrs. C.'s accident\nand death.\nBefore telling me that he had received the paper, he\nasked me on which day it was that he had spoken to me\nabout Mr. and Mi-s. C. This he did to make sure that\nit was the day of the accident. [Signed] M. W.\n\f128 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nMl'. Parker sent us the cutting from the D Daily\nTelegraj)li above referred to.

[Parker] I may add the\nfollowing :\n(1) Mr. [Parker] is a man I have known for years,\naccurate and businesslilse. He has hitherto had no\nsympathy with any investigation of such cases, as I\nknow from his recejition of one or two personal experiences\nof my own communicated by me to him. I\n(2) I never heard him mention Mr. and Mrs. C, though\nhe has told me many details of his boyhood and young-\nmanliood. I understand his niece had never heard him\nmention them either.\n(3) [Mr. Parker] performed three full services on Sunday, [\nDec. 7 [1913], so that there was much to divert him\nthroughout the day from the thought of Mr. and Mrs.\nC, which, he says\u2014nevertheless\u2014occupied his mind during\nthe day.

The\npresent case is one of many similar impressions which\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : tm\/pression not Externalised. 129\nMr. Young has had. The interest of this particular one\nconsists in the fact that Mr. Young at once acted upon\nthe suggestion made to him some time previously by\nSir Wilham Barrett, and at the moment of its occurrence\nwrote down the intimation with the date and hour.\n(L. 1125.)\nNew Road, Llanelly, March 9\/01.\nThe following account of a presentiment I recently had\nmay be interesting to you.\nI was havmg my supper on the evening of February\n15th last, when a message came from a customer requiring\nmy services. I sent back a reply that I would come\nimmediately I had my supper. It has always been a\nstrong point with me to keep my appointments, and\ntherefore, having hastily finished my meal, I was in the\nact of leaving the table when I suddenly exclaimed,\n\" There ! ! ! I have just had an intimation that Robert\nis dead \" : the Robert referred to is a Robert HaUett\n(a brother-in-law) who was residing near my sister (Mrs.\nPouting) at Sturminster Newton, Dorset. He had been\nbed-ridden from paralysis for this last two years, but had\nrecently been much Avorse.\nI at once entered fuU particulars in my diary. Date,\nFeb. 15. Message, and time of message, 9.40 p.m. My\nsister-in-law was present the Avhole time, and can vouch\nfor the circumstances. On the 17th I received a post-\ncard from my sister at Sturminster Newton, bearing date\nFeb. 16th, stating, that \" Robert had passed away, will\nwrite to-morrow.\"\nIn the meantime I had written to my sister Mrs. Pout-\ning, mentioning my presentiment, and our letters crossed,\nfor the following morning a letter came from her (I must\nmention here she had been assisting m nursing my brother-\nin-law), saymg, \" I was glad you had a presentiment of\npoor Robert's release, he passed away at 7.45 p.m., then\nLottie [my niece Lottie HaUett] and I came home till\n9.!f0, and that was the time you had the impression.\"\nI wish to state two facts in connection mth the fore-\ngoing case.

The previous\nentry is dated February 12th, and the two following entries\nare dated, in that order, February 28 and February 19. The\nentry contains, therefore, no internal evidence of having been\nwritten at the time. It is as follows :\nFeb. 15. As I rose from supjDer, a message came, as\nif by spirit influence, to say, \" Robert has passed away.\"\nMiss Bennett present. I said, \" There, I have just had\nan intimation Robert is dead.

Ponting, dated Febrviary 16, containing the\nsimple announcement :\n\" Passed away quietly last evening \" ;\nalso two letters in which Mrs. Ponting refers to Mr. Young's\nletter. In the first, dated February 19th, she writes :\nI was glad to hear you had a presentiment of poor\nRobert's release. He passed away at a quarter to eight.\nThen Lottie [HaUett] and I came home till 9.40, so that\nwas the time you had the impression.\nIn the second letter IVIrs. Ponting announces her unsuccessful\nsearch for the missing letter from Mr. Young. It had probably\nbeen, as she explained, torn up for pipe-lights.\nMiss Lottie Young, another niece, to whom Mr. Young\nrelated his impression on the morning after its occurrence,\nsends us the following corroboration\n:\n7 New Road, Llanelly, April 11.\nAccidentally meeting my uncle, Mr. Young, on the\nmorning of Feb. 16th, he informed me that he had had\nan intimation the previous evening that IVIr. Hallett was\ndead. On Feb. 17th he showed me a post-card (received\nthat day), which stated that Mr. Hallett died on Feb.\n15th, thus confirming the intimation. L. Young.\nIn the next case (P. 262, Journal, Vol. IX., p. 79), the\nimpression occurred about twelve hours before the death\nof the person it concerned.\n(P. 262.)\nThe Hon. Mrs. Leir-Carleton, Greywell Hill, Winchfield,\nwrites as follows :\nMrs. Hoptroff (resident in this village and mother of my\nmaid, TiUey Hoptroff) underwent an operation on August\n20th [1898], in the Victoria Hospital, Bournemouth. Her\ndaughter remained with her until August 23rd, when she\nwas progressing satisfactorily, and insisted upon the girl\nreturnmg to \" keep house for the boys,\" her brothers.\nOn August 26th, about 9 a.m., I was sitting at my\ndressing-table, trying to brush my hair, in despite of\nhindrance from a pet cat (that would play with my\n\f132 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nsleeve-ruffles, and was getting scolded, yet encouraged),\nwhen I suddenly became aware of this assertion :\n\" Mrs.\nHoptroff will pass, to-day.\" There was no sound, but I\nfelt as clearly impressed with those five words as if they\nhad been uttered close to me. I may remark that '\n\" pass \" is not an expression I should be likely to use,\nbut this is the second time it has been used to impress\nme. I sprang to my feet and stared around. My gaze\nlit upon the writing-table, and (recollecting a similar\nexperience that I had unluckily supposed illusory and\nneglected to note) I at once scribbled the above sentence,\ndated, and shut it away. Then I admitted two old\nservants, (Mrs. Tilley and Mrs. Bolton), and as they\nentered I asked, \" What news of Mrs. Hoptroff ?\n\" The\nanswer was, \" Oh, much better ! The sickness has left\nher, and the doctor ordered fish for her dinner.\" I said,\n\" Well ... I must say I did not expect such good\nnews. Somehow I have had a feeling she might die\nafter all, and perhaps to-day.\" I did not mention what\nhad made me think this, because their information made\nme distrust mine, which indeed soon ceased to occupy\nmy thoughts.\nThat night, at dinner, shortly after 8 o'clock, there was\nbrought to me a telegram, that Tilley Hoptroff had just\nreceived from Bournemouth, announcing \" a change for\nthe worse.\" I directed my son where to find my memor- i\nandum, which he brought, and everyone present read it.\nOn Sunday, August 28th, we learnt that Mrs. H. died\non the evening of the 26th.\nMrs. Leir-Carleton's account is confirmed by the signed\n|\nstatements (bearing date Aug. 28th, 1898) of her son, Mr.\nDudley Carleton, who went to fetch the pajier inscribed,\n\"Mrs. Hoptroff will pass to-day, Friday, August 26th, 1898,\"\nand of several of the guests present at dinner on the evening\nin question. Further confirmation is afforded by the testimony\nof the servants, in whose presence Mrs. Carleton had hinted\nat her misgivings on the morning of the 26th :\n|\nWhen I came into Mrs. Carleton's room on Friday,\n^\nAugust 26th, she asked me if there was any news of Mrs,\nI\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Im'pression not Externalised. 133\nHoptroff. I answered, \" much better, the sickness has\nstopped, and she was to have fish for her dinner.\" Mrs.\nCarleton looked very serious, and said that she did not\nexpect good news, and said, \" somehow I have had a\nfeeling that she may die, to-day.\" Mrs. Bolton was also\npresent and wiU sign her name below mine. This is\nwritten down by Lucy Day (housemaid), to whom Mrs.\nBolton repeated Mrs. Carleton's remark a few minutes\nlater, after Mrs. Carleton had gone downstairs to breakfast.\nElisabeth Tilley.\nEmily Bolton.\nLucy Day.\nWe owe the following case (L. 1217, Jotirnal, Vol. XVIII.,\np. 193) to the kindness of Mrs. E. S. Russell. There is no\ndoubt that the impression was veridical, but I include\nit here with some hesitation because we have no evidence\nthat the telepathic agent was any one living, and it may\nhave been a message from the dead.\n(L. 1217.)\nMrs. Russell wites :\nBryans Ground, Presteign,\nRadnorshire, March 12, 1918.\nMy sister, Mrs. W- , has asked me to write you an\naccount of the story she told you about my small boy.\nUnfortunately I did not write it down at the time, so\nI am not sure as to the date, but it was after November\n4th [1917], perhaps several days after, though before the\nnews of my husband's death came to us on November\n16th. I think it was most likely on November 8th or\n9th, and my husband was killed on November 6tli.\nDicky, the small boy, was resting on my bed after lunch\nand I was sitting by his side sewing, and we were not\ntalking, when he sat up rather suddenly and said, \" Daddy\nis dead.\" I said, \" Oh no, dear, he's not and I expect\nhe'U come back to us some day \" ; but Dicky looked very\nupset and became flushed and almost wept and said again,\n\" No he won't, Dick knows he's dead.\" I just said,\n\f134 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [PAET\n\" No, dear, I don\"t think he is,\" but Dicky seemed so\ndistressed and repeated, \" No, no, Dick knows it \" so\nemphatically that I thought best to leave the subject\nalone. He never referred to it again and had never said\nanything of the sort before. When we did say anything\nabout his father it was always as to when he would come\nback and Dick's usual remark was that he would run\nand open the gate for him. It was so queer of Dick\nthat I went almost at once and told my sister here of it,\nbut I had no impression at aU that my husband was\ndead, and only thought of it as odd of Dicky. Indeed\nwe had got to look upon my husband's safety as a\nforegone conclusion, for he had been through Gallipoh,\nEl Arish and the first battle of Gaza without a scratch.\n[Signed] Elizabeth D. Russell.\nIn reply to questions Mrs. Russell writes on March 16,\n1918 :\n(1) Dicky was born on August 3rd, 1914 [and was\ntherefore aged 3j years at the date of his impression].\n(2) I thinli \" dead \" does convey some meaning to him ;\nhe sees hedgehogs, worms, mice and such like animals\ndead, and always asks about them, \" Why dead, Dick\nwants them ahve again \"\n\u2014and he screws up his face into\na half tearful state, much as he did when he made the\nremark about his father ;\nonly that time he got very\nflushed and was much distressed.\n(3) No, I don't think it was a dream in the sense of a\nsleeping dream ; he was quiet, but awake. It gave me\nthe idea of an odd freak. I thinlc he is a child with\nan acute imagination and sensitive ; but he's essentially\nhealthy and full of the joy of life, about the happiest\nchild we have ever come across.\n(4) Enclosed is my sister's account of the incident.\n(5) I can't veraciously give an exact date ; but we d d\ngo back on it after we heard of my husband's death and\nfixed it at somewhere between November 8th and 12tli.\nThe account of Mrs. Russell's sister, Miss M.

Unfortunately neither\nof us made a note of the exact date at the time.\n[Signed] Mary D.

F. W. H. M.\nOn Friday, December 10th, 1897, at about 10.35 p.m.,\nbeing alone and at work in my library, I began to think,\nwithout any reason, that there had been a fire at the\nOpera. My wife and daughter had gone off to the Opera\nat 8 ; I had not been able to accompany them. The\nimpression was so strong that I m'ote + F [Feu !] on the\ncover of a book which lay near me.

I enclose what I wote.\n[Fragment of book- cover sent herewith with the Avords\nmentioned.] I did not, however, feel anxious ; but said\nto myself, \" There has been no great fire at the Opera,\nonly an alarm of fire.\"\nAt the same time, or rather 10 or 1.5 minutes later,\nat 10.55, my sister, Mme. B., who lives in the same\nhouse, and whose bedroom is on the same floor with my\nstudy, had an idea that my study was on fire. She was\nat the moment on the point of getting into bed, but she\ncame in deshabille to my study door and put her hand\non the handle to come in ; but then, telling herself that\nher fear was absurd, she went back to bed. She tells\nme, however, that she would nevertheless have come in,\nbut that she was afraid that I had someone with me in\nthe room.\n^ There can be no harm now in mentioning that Myers' scientific\nfriend was Professor Charles Richet, as the latter has recently published\nthe incident in ]iis book Traite de Metapsychique, p. 352, as his own\nexperience,\n\f138 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nAt 12.10, my wife and daughter came back from the\ntheatre. They instantly told me that there had been a\nsort of beginning of a conflagration. I said nothing,\nand they told me as follows :\n\u2014Between 8.45 and 9, at\nthe end of the first act of the Maitres Chanteurs, a smell\nof l)urning and a light smoke were perceived in the\nauditorium. My wife said to my daughter : \"I will i\ngo out and see what is the matter ; if I make a sign to\nyou, follow me at once, without saying a word or even ,\nwaiting to put your cloak on.\"' The attendant whom she\nasked said that nothing was wrong. Nevertheless, there\nwas some emotion among the audience, and five or six\npersons in the stalls got up and went away. The smoke\ncame, no doubt, from a stove.\nNote that this is the first time that my wife ever left j\nher seat in a theatre from alarm of fire. It is the first\ntime that I have ever been anxious about fire in her\nabsence ; and I do not suppose that I jot down my\npossible presentiments more than five or six times in a\nyear. i\nMy sister has never before been anxious about fire in i\nmy room.\nWith these may be compared two cases in which the\nimpression was connected with the distress of an animal\nidentified at the time by the percipient. One was a\nvague waking impression of something wrong with the\nanimal ; the other was a more definite impression in a\ndream, but whether there was in the dream any visual\nor auditory impression we do not know.\nThe first of the two cases (L. 1144,^ Jotirnal, Vol. XII.,\np. 21) was received through the kindness of Sir Rider\nHaggard.\nLady Carbery had sent it in consequence of the some-\nwhat similar case which he had contributed to The Times\nof July 21st, 1904, and which was reprinted in full, with\nadditional evidence, in the Journal for October, 1904\n(see below, p. 219).

The statement could be confirmed by the\ncoachman and others. \" Kitty \" is still alive, ending\nher days in the fields among her foals, and doing no\nwork.\nThe account enclosed was as follows :\nOn one hot Sunday afternoon in the summer of 1900,\nI went after luncheon to pay my customary visit to the\nstables, to give sugar and carrots to the horses, among\nthe number bemg a favourite mare named Kitty. She\nwas a shy, nervous, well-bred animal, and there existed\nbetween us a great and unusual sympathy. I used to\nride her every morning before brealifast, whatever the\nweather might be\u2014quiet sohtary rides on tlie cliffs which\noverhang the sea at Castle Freke\u2014and it always seemed\nto me that Kitty enjoyed that hour in the freshness of\nthe day as much as I did. On this particular afternoon\nI left the stables and walked alone to the garden, a\ndistance of a quarter of a mile, and estabhshed myself\nunder a tree with an interesting book, fully intending to\nremain there for a couple of houi's. After about twenty\nminutes an uncomfortable sensation came between me and\nmy reading, and at once I felt sure that there was some-\nthing the matter with Kitty. I tried to put the feeling\nfrom me and to go on with my book, but the impression\ngrew stronger, and I felt compelled to hasten back to the\nstables. I went straight to Kitty's box, and found her\n\" cast \" and in urgent need of help. The stablemen were\nin a distant part of the stables, whence I fetched them\nto help the mare up. Then- surprise v\/as great to find\nme in the stables for the second time that afternoon. . . .\nThis account was sent to us by Sir Rider Haggard, and\nMr. Baggally undertook to make further enquiries into the\ncase. In reply to his first letter, Lady Carbery wrote :\n\f140 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PABT\nFrankfielb House, Co.

At the same time it\nmay be difficult at this date to get a statement from the\nstablemen, one of whom is somewhere in England, but\nLady Carbery wUl try to do so. She is absolutely con-\nvinced that no one entered the stable. Had the stable-\nmen done so they would at once have helped the mare to\nget up, and any one else would have given the alarm.\nIt seems a direct case of telepathy from animal mind to\nhuman. . . .\nLady Carbery afterwards sent Mr. Baggally a statement\nfrom her former coachman, Edward Nobbs, as follow :\nNosELEY Hael iStables, Near Leicester,\nDecember ^Ist, 1904.\nI was coachman at Castle Freke at the time, and Lady\nCarbery came to the stables after luncheon as usual on a\nSunday afternoon with carrots and sugar for the horses.\nKitty was then loose in her box and (juite well. I then\nwent to my rooms over the stables, the other stablemen\nbeing also upstairs, and to my surprise about half an hour\nor three quarters later her Ladyship, who had been to\nthe garden, called me and the other men to come and\nhelp Kitty up, as she was lying cast in her box. No\none had gone into the stable in the interval.\n(Signed) Edward Nobbs.\nIn a letter to Lady Carbery of the same date, enclosing this\naccount, Edward Nobbs writes :\n\u2014\" I remember the Sunday\nafternoon quite well.

He immediately di'essed\nand went to the stable, which was about 20 or 30 yards\ndistant from his house, and found the mare had just\nfoaled. The foal was extremely weak, and would un-\ndoubtedly have died if he liad not come when he did\nto give it assistance.\nThe mare was 17 days before her time, being due to\nfoal on April 19th. He had not looked at her for two\nor three days previously, and there were no symptoms of\nprematurity nor was he in any anxiety about the foaling.\nShe had had several foals before and had never mis-\ncarried before. He did not say anything to his wife\nbefore going out to the mare, as she was asleep. He had\nbeen in the habit for some days back of getting up early\nto look at a cow that was exjjected to calve ; but on this\noccasion the dream was so vivid he went straight to the\nmare's stable as soon as he was dressed.

Doubtful Agents.\nWe may conveniently take next three cases of mental or\nemotional impressions in dreams. In none can we point\nto a particular agent, though in all the fact suggested\nby the dream was known to some living people. The\nfirst (G. 237, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 105) may have been\ndue to telepathy from the dead brother, though if so it is\nnot explained why the impression should have occurred\njust when it did\u2014a few hours before the cablegram which\nhad \" been advisedly kept over \" reached the percipient.\nFrom this point of view this case belongs to a small\nclass, which we shall have to discuss later, where the time\nat which the impression is received seems oddly to depend\non the fact that news of the event corresponding to the\nimpression was approaching the percipient. It is possible in\nthe present case that the telepathic impression came from\nthe i^erson responsible for keeping over the cablegram. .f\nt\n(G. 237.)\nThe case was received through the American Branch from\nMiss E. H. Kitching. Both witnesses were known to Dr.\nHodgson.\nMiss Kitching writes : i;\n141, WiiST 60th Street, New York, i\nApril 29th, 1890.\nThe following is full information as to this experience,\nwhich, by the way, is the only one I ever had. '\nI will say, in the first place, that I am unusually\nstrong and robust, and have always been in perfect health,\nand also that I have always had a secret belief that only\nunliealthy and morbid people are subject to psychical\nexperiences. '\nMy brother, J. Howard Kitching, who from his birth\nsuffered from heart disease, was obliged, on account of\nhis ill health, to leave this country in February, 1887.\nHe was appointed U.S. Consular Agent to Bone, Algeria,\nwhere he remained until his death, which occurred August\n20th, 1888. He grew steadily better in that climate,\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression not Externalised. US\nand my motlier and I had reason to hope he would\nultimately become strong. In August, however, he became\nill again, and cUed, havkig carefully kept from us the fact\nof his illness. At the time of his death we were at\nSaratoga, N.Y. The cablegram announcing his death,\nhavmg been advisedly kept over in New York, did not\nreach us till noon on the 23rd of August. Early in the\nmorning of the 23rd (it may have been at four or five\no'clock, but I do not know the exact hour) I experienced,\nwhile lymg asleep in bed, a distressing mental impression,\nas though somethmg dreadful were taking place in con-\nnection Avith my brother, and I awoke with the conviction\nthat he was dead. The mental stress was very painful\nwhile it lasted, but as soon as I was completely awake\nI thought no more about it, until the cablegram came\nat noon informing us that my brother had died on the\n20th.\nEven if the impression had weighed on my mmd durmg\nthe morning (which it did not), I should not have spoken\nof it to my mother, for fear of causmg her anxiety.\nMy brother was always extremely mterested in psychical\nresearch, and had some very mterestmg experiences in\nhypnotism, which power he developed while at Bone. I,\nhowever, as I said before, have had no psychical experience\nexcept this one.\nEdith Howard Kitching.\nIn reply to Mr. Hodgson's request for corroboration, Mi-s.\nKitching A\\Tote as follows :\n141, West 60th Street, May 8th, 1890.\nDear Sir,\u2014As to the statement sent to you by my\ndaughter, Edith Kitching, I wish to say that she did not\nmention to me the fact that she had received a mental\ncommunication before the receipt of the cablegram, an-\nnoimcing the death of her brother, but some hours after-\nwards, after receiving and reading it, she instantly said,\n\"I knew it,\" and then told me of her experience as\nwritten to you.

[part\nIn the next case (P. 269, Journal, Vol. X., p. 28) there\nis no one hving or dead who is marked out as direct\nagent, since the persons who possessed the information\nreceived by the percipient were entirely unknown to her,\nand probably did not know of her existence. It would\nseem that if the information reached her telepathically it\nwas probably in some way through her brother.\n(P. 269.)\nThe following account came from Miss Agnes E. Walker, of\n13, Stafford Mansions, Albert Bridge Road, London, S.W.\nBoth Miss Walker and the brother (Mr. Bernard Walker),\nwho was the subject of her dream, are known to Mr. J.

Consequently, if the case be not regarded\nas one of pure comcidence, we can suppose that Miss\nA. E.

I only knew I had had the list\nin my hand with R.'s name 6th \"), was sent to us by\nDr. H. W. M'Connel of Matlaske Hall, Normch, an\nAssociate of the Society, to whom the principal witnesses\nin the case were well known, and who carefully collected\nthe evidence.\n(L. 1127.)\nDr. M'Connel drew up the following statement as the result\nof a conversation with Miss F. (the dreamer), and afterwards\nshowed it to her to make sure of its correctness :\nOn February 26th, 1900, I dreamt that my brother\npassed sixth in an examination for the Naval Medical.\nThe letter with result came from the Admiralty on the\n28th, and the dream was found correct. The examination\nwas from February 19th-23rd, and I knew that my brother\nwas up in London at it. I was in Edinburgh, and I\nhad no reason for supposing that he might come out any\nspecial place. The dream was between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m.\non the night of the 26th, and my brother only returned\nfrom London on March 1st. I attached no importance\nat the time to the number in the dream, only feeling\ndepressed at having dreamt he had passed at all, as\ndreams go very contrary ; but fortunately I told the\ndream that same morning to my brother and sister and\na friend. A. C. F.\nThis is undated, but Mss F. answered further questions\non January 10, 1901, and corroboration of her having told\nthe dream before its veridicality was known was sent by\nthe brother and sister mentioned on January 21, 1901.\nIt was ascertained from one of the examiners that the\nmeeting at which the results of the examination were\n\f148 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ndetermined took place in the evening of February 26\n\u2014\nthat is, a few hours before the dream, and the letter\nfrom the Admiralty announcing the result was posted to\nthe candidate's home address on the 27th. He did not\nhimself learn it till the 28th. According to the Times of\nMarch 5, 1900, there were twenty names in the list, that\nof the candidate in question being sixth. The full evidence\nwill be found set out in the Journal. I\nA very similar incident\u2014a mother's veridical dream that\nher son passed out 8th before she could have heard of\nit\u2014is mentioned in the course of an account of a series\nof veridical dreams and impressions of a Mrs. B., also\nsent to us by Dr. M'Connel, to whom Mrs. B. was well\nknown ; hut this particular incident was recorded nearly |\ntwelve years after the event. See L. 1128, Journal, Vol.\nX., pp.\" 161-170.\n\u00a7 10. Mental Vision of complicated event.\nI will conclude this chapter with a case (L. 1160, Journal, ;\nVol. XIII., p. 110) in which the percipient has a vision\u2014 i\napparently not externahsed, a vision in the mind's eye\u2014 |\nof the condition and surroundings of the agent. I have \\\nalready quoted one such case (L. 1152, see above, p. 58)\namong semi-experimental cases, though it might quite well\nhave been placed in the present section. Both in that\ncase and in the one to be quoted the percipient's mind\nwas normally directed to the agent. Without this we can\nhardly suppose that in the first case the impression would\nhave occurred, and it is at least highly probable that this\npreoccupation facilitated the impression in the second case.\nThe case has the advantage from an evidential point of\nview that the vision represented a very definite and\npresumably unusual incident. The case comes from\nAmerica, and Dr. Hodgson first received a second or\nthird hand account written ten days earlier than the\none we print, but substantially agreeing with it, from\nMrs. Ward, a sister of the percipient, Mrs. Robinson.\nBoth ladies were Associates of the American Branch, 1\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression not Externalised. 149\n(L. 1160.)\nThe percipient Mrs. Robinson writes to Dr. Hodgson :\nBoNNYcoT, Anchorage,\nKentucky, June 1th, 1903.\nIn compliance with my sister's request and yours as well\nas with my own interest in psychic phenomena, I shall\nwrite you of this last experience that came to me on the\nnight of May 17th.\nMy son and a friend had driven across the country to\ndine and spend the evening with friends. The rest of\nthe household had retired for the night. I was awakened\nby the telephone and looked at the clock, findmg it 11.30\np.m. I knew my son would soon be in and thought of\na window dowiistairs which I felt might not have been\nlocked, and determined to remain awake and ask my son\nto make sure that it was secure. As I lay waiting and\nhstening for him I suddenly saw their vehicle, a hght\nbreak-cart, turn over, my son jump out, land on his feet,\nrun to the struggling horse's head, his friend hold to the\nlines, and m a moment it was gone and I knew it was\nright and felt no disturbance.\nI met my son as he came in and spoke of the wuidow.\nHe said: \"We tipped over, mother.\" I replied \"Yes.\nI know it, I saw you,\" and described what I saw as I\nhave to you, which he said was just as it happened.\nHe also said : \"I thought for a moment the horse would\ngo up over the railroad tracks,\" and then I remembered\nthat the horse, as I saw him, was thrown up an embank-\nment. I said: \"This happened about half-an-hour ago.\"\nHe looked at his watch, it was 12.15, and said \"Yes.\"\nI did not see them before they started out, as his friend\ncalled for him with his horse and vehicle, and I did not\nknow m what style they went. . . .\nHelen Avery Robinson.\nMrs. Robinson's son confirms the account as foUoAvs :\nJune 23rd, 1903.\nOn Sunday night.

We were in a break-cart, and my\nfriend was driving a young and spirited horse. There\nwas no moon, and we could see indistinctly by star-Ught.\nAbout twelve o'clock, when about two miles from home,\nwe were driving along the edge of a wood with a deep\nrailroaxl cut on our right. The top of this embankment\nhad lately been levelled off and my friend mistook it\nfor the road, which was just beside the embankment and,\nin the faint light, seemed to be about level with it.\nWhen I called his attention to his mistake he turned\ndowii into the road and overturned the cart. We were\nboth thrown out. The horse was startled and began\nrearing. I ran around the cart after him and took him\nby the bridle, although my friend had not lost his hold\non the rems. We righted the cart and got home with-\nout further accident. The family had been in bed for\nsome time, but my mother had been aroused at eleven-\nthirty by the telephone. As I came in she gave me the\nmessage.

Death Coincidences.\nWaking hallucinations of the senses corresponding\nwith an external event unknown to the percipient afford\non the whole the most striking evidence of telepathic\ncommunication between agent and percipient, chiefly\nbecause such waking hallucinations are themselves rare.\nMost of us go through life without having experienced\none. At the same time, rare as they are, their occur-\nrence is most often not veridical\u2014it is only in a minority\nof cases that there is ground for supposing them to\nhave a telepathic origin. It is therefore necessary to\nexamine carefuUy not only the evidence for the hal-\nlucinatory nature of the percipient's experience, but that\nfor the definite character of the agent's, as well as the\ndegree of correspondence in time and otherwise between\nthe two. One of the most definite possible events on the\nside of the agent, and one concerning which there can\nseldom be any mistake, is his death. I will therefore take\nfirst the class of death coincidences\u2014meaning by a death\ncoincidence an apparition or other hallucinatory experience\nor dream occurring within twelve hours of the death,\nbefore or after it.\nDeath Coincidences\u2014(a) Realistic Apparitions.\nBy a realistic apparition I mean one that appears like\na real person in the percipient's surroundings.\n\f152 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [pakt\nPerhaps the best evidenced death comcidence in the\npresent collection is the realistic apparition of Lieutenant\nM'Connel (L. 1226, Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 76). It was\nspoken of by the percipient to another person, who corro-\nborates, before it was realised that it was not the living\nman, and it was recorded in writing within fifteen days of\nthe event. The case reached us through Sir Oliver Lodge,\nto whom a report was sent in the first instance. The\napparition was that of Lieut. David E. M'Connel, R.A.F.,\nwho was killed in a flying accident on December 7, 1918,\nand the percipient was one of his fellow-officers, Lieut.\nJ. J. Larkin, R.A.F. The earliest report of the occurrence\nwas contained in a letter to Sir Oliver Lodge from Lieut.\nM'Connel's father, Mr. D. R. M'Connel, who writes thus :\n(L. 1226.)\nJanuary 16, 1919.\nKnowing your interest in psychical affairs, I take the\nHberty of giving you the particulars of the reported\nappearance of my son at the time of his death through\nan accident while flying. I enclose the copy of the\nwritten statement of Lieut. Jas. J. Larkin of Scampton\nAerodrome, to whom the appearance was made. I heard\nof the occurrence at my son's funeral on the 11th December\n(he was killed on the 7th December) and wrote as soon\nas I could to Lieut. Larkin, who replied on the 22nd\nDecember. The statement made to me on the 11th by\nLieut. Hillman, who has attested the correctness of the\naccount given, corresponds accurately with the account\nitself. Lieut. Hillman had not been back to Scampton,\nor seen Lieut. Larkin, between the time of the funeral\nand the writing of the account. Lieut. Hillman wrote\nhis attestation on reading the account in my house. The\nevent seems to have made a very vivid impression on the\ntwo or three of my son's friends who heard of it. . . .\nOne other matter of fact I may mention. My son was\nfully dressed for fl3dng, with helmet, when he started. We\nhappen to have a snapshot of him taken by a feUow-\nofficer just before he climbed into the \" camel \" which he\nflew. The account states that he \" appeared \" with his\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 153\nnaval cap on. My son began his flying career in March\nlast, entering through the R.N.A.S. before the amalgama-\ntion of the R.N.A.S. with the R.F.C. His elder brother\nhad entered the R.N.A.S. and my son David was proud\nof his connection with the earUer service. Havmg a\ncomplete kit of the naval fljnng service, he always wore\nthe naval flying xmtform about the aerodrome, and was\none of only three at the drome who had followed the\nsame course in entermg. His naval uniform was there-\nfore weU known. It would not be at aU an unusual thing\nthat he should have taken off his uncomfortable helmet\non arriving back at the hangar, and exchanged it for his\nnaval cap. Under the circumstances, however, it is to\nbe remarked that he wore his helmet at the time of the\naccident ; and in the appearance to Lieut. Larkin wore\nthe naval cap. His mother informs me that he was\ndressed, as usual, in his naval miform below his flymg\nthings, and that he had his naval cap with him in the\nfusilage to wear on reaching Tadcaster\u2014the usual action.\nThe O.C. states that my son left Scampton for Tadcaster\nat 11.35 a.m. December 7, '18.\nThe circumstances of the flight were as follows. My\nson, with other officers, had been to a dance at Lincoln\non the night of the 6th December. He got up rather\nlate on the morning of the 7th, missed parade, and also\nhad no breakfast. The formal completion of all his tests\nfor \" getting his wings \" were to take place on the 7th.\nAs the account states, he was on his way to start for\nthe Aerial Range to shoot off those final tests when he\nwas asked by the O.C. to take one of two \" camels\n\"\nto Tadcaster. He went therefore unexpectedly, rather\nfatigued, and without food. I may say here that his\nO.C. considered him a \" bom flyer,\" and that he was a\nvery cautious and careful flyer, though not shirldng neces-\nsary risks. By most unusual favour, he had been accepted\nfor permanent service before he had won his \" wings \"\n\u2014\nhad been nommated for an mstructorship in flying, and\nwas to have left for the Camp of Instructors on the\nMonday following Saturday, 7th December. The weather\nwas fair when he left Scampton to fly to Tadcaster a\n\f154 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\ndistance of 60 miles. He was accompanied by another\n\" Avro \" plane\u2014a 2-seater\u2014which was to have brought\nhim back to Scampton after dehvery of the \" camel.\"\nYou are probably aware that a \" camel \" scout plane is a\nnotoriously difficult and sensitive one, and requires con-\ntinued strain and effort to keep it dovm. At Doncaster\nthe two planes ran mto fog. My son and his Avro\ncompanion descended, and my son described the situation\nto his flight commander and asked for instructions by\ntelephone. The reply was \"Use your own discretion.\"\nWe suppose that my son's anxiety to finish his tests\nprompted him to continue. His companion states that\nneither of them lunched at Doncaster. Between Don-\ncaster and Tadcaster the fog became very thick. The\nAvro man had to come down, and made a forced landing,\nsuccessfully. My son circled round him to see that he\nwas all right and continued his flight to Tadcaster. Sixty\nmiles is not a long flight. But the fog was very dense.\nIn order to keep touch with the sohd a flyer has to keep\nhis plane mader such circumstances about 150 ft. above\nthe surface of the ground\u2014a feat in a camel of considerable\ndifficulty. My son must have encountered difficulty, as\nhe did not approach Tadcaster till nearly 3.30. Allowing\nfor 1^ or I hour for the descent at Doncaster, he must\nhave been flying for about 3| to 3| hours on this occasion.\nI am told that it is as much as an ordinary flyer can do\nto fly a camel for 2 hours. The strain on the arms is\nintense. In fact, his mother, who saw his body on\nMonday the 9th at midday, observed that his hands were\ntightly clenched and his forearms swollen. As he at last\napproached the Tadcaster Aerodrome, the machme was\nseen approaching by a man on the road about \\ mile\ndistant from the camp, who reported the fog to be ex-\ntremely dense. During the evidence at the inquest a\ngirl, or yoimg woman, said she was watching the plane,\nand saw it apparently \" side-shp,\" then right itself. It\nflew steadily for a minute or two, then moimted suddenly\nand immediately \" nose-dived \" and crashed. The engine\nwas full on when the crash occurred. My son was thrown\nviolently forward\u2014his head striking the gun before him,\n\fLXxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases: Impression Externalised. 155\nwhich was not hooded. One arm was broken, one leg\nwas torn. The girl ran to the spot and \" found the officer\ndead.\" The violence of contact seems to have stopped his\nwatch, which registered 3.25 p.m. His cigarette case\nwas almost doubled up. These are the circumstances of\nthe accident, so far as I am aware of them. I am\ninformed by flying men that the reaction on reaching\nsafety after a difficult flight is so \" terrible,\" that fainting\nis not unknown. My son, it is thought, may have fainted ;\nhence the crash, and his inabihty to save himself. Or\nthere was possibly engine trouble. I am told also that\nwhen shot, or in danger, the immediate thought of the\nflyer is usually a quite trivial one, such as the sudden\ndesire for a cup of cocoa, or to get undressed at camp,\netc. I mention this because the \" appearance \" was not\nmade at my son's home, or to his mother, who was there\nat the time, but in his own camp-room, and to a person\nwho was a comparative stranger. However, his mother\ndid have a strange impression at the hour of his death,\nof which she is writing an account herewith enclosed.^\nMy son had a happy, even joyous disposition. He had\na brisk step and manner which would account for the\n\" noise and clatter,\" which Lieut. Larkin remarked and\nreports in his account. My son was 18 on the 15th\nApril, 1918, having left Bedales School, Hants, before\nmihtary age, to enter the R.N.A.S. He had been head-\nboy at Bedales during that winter term.

He came\ninto the room again at 11.30 and told me that he did\nnot go to the range, but that he was taking a \" camel \"\nto Tadcaster drome. He said, \" I expect to get back in\ntime for tea. Cheero.\" He wallied out and half a\nminute later, knocked at the window and asked me to\nhand him out his map, which he had forgotten. After\nI had Imich, I spent the afternoon writing letters and\nreading, sitting in front of the stove fire. What I am\nabout to say now is extraordinary to say the least, but\nit happened so naturally that at the time I did not give\nit a second thought. I have heard and read of similar\nhappenings and I must say that I always disbeheved\nthem absolutely. My opinion had always been that the\npersons to whom these appearances were given were people\nof a nervous, highly-strung, imagmative temperament, but I\nhad always been among the incredulous ones and had been\nonly too ready to pooh-pooh the idea. I was certainly\nawake at the time, reading and smoking. I was sitting,\nas I have said, in front of the fire, the door of the room\nbeing about eight feet away at my back. I heard some-\none walldng up the passage ; the door opened with the\nusual noise and clatter which David always made ; I\nheard his \" Hello boy !\n\" and I turned half round in my\nchair and saw him standing in the doorway, half in and\nhalf out of the room, holding the door knob in his hand.\nHe was dressed in his full flying clothes but wearing his\nnaval cap, there being nothing imusual in his appearance.\nHis cap was pushed back on his head and he was smihng,\nas he always was when he came into the rooms and\ngreeted us.

I\nwas looking at him the whole time he was speaking. He\nsaid, \" Well, cheero !\n\" closed the door noisily and went out.\nI went on with my reading and thought he had gone to\n\\asit some friends in one of the other rooms, or perhaps\nhad gone back to the hangars for some of his flying gear,\nhelmet, goggles, etc., which he may ha\\e forgotten. I\ndid not have a watch, so could not be sure of the time,\nbut was certain it was between a quarter and half-past\nthree, because shortly afterwards Lieut. Gamer-Smith\ncame into the room and it was a quarter to four. He\nsaid, ' I hope Mac (David) gets back early, we are going\nto Lincohi this evening.\" I repUed, \" He is back, he was\nin the room a few minutes ago !\n\" He said, \"Is he having\ntea ?\n\" and I rei^hed that I did not think so, as he (Mac)\nhad not changed his clothes, but that he was probably\nin some other room. Gamer-Smith said, \" I'U try and\nfind him !\n\" I then went into the mess, had tea, and\nafterwards dressed and went to Lincoln. Li the smoking\nroom of the Albion Hotel I heard a group of officers\ntalking, and overheard their conversation and the words\n\"crashed,\" \" Tadcaster \" and \" M'Connel.\" I joined them\nand they told me that just before they had left Scampton,\nword had come through that M'Connel had \" crashed\n\"\nand had been killed taking the \" Camel \" to Tadcaster.\nAt that moment I did not beheve it, that he had been\nkilled on the Tadcaster joumey. My impression was that\nhe had gone up again after I had seen him, as I felt\npositive that I had at 3.30. Naturally I was eager to\n> hear something more definite, and later in the evening I\nheard that he had been killed on the Tadcaster joumey.\nNext moming, Gamer-Smith and I had a long discussion\nabout my experience. He tried to persuade me that I\nmust have been mistaken, that I had not actually seen\nMac on the previous afternoon about 3.30, but I insisted\nthat I had seen him. As you can understand, Mr.\nM'Connel, I was at a loss to solve the problem. There\nwas no disputing the fact that he had been killed whilst\n\f\u202258 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich.

I\ntried to persuade myself that I had not seen him or\nspoken to him in this room, but I could not make myself\nbeUeve otherwise, as I was mideniably awake and his\nappearance, voice, manner had all been so natural. I\nam of such a sceptical nature regarding things of this\nkmd that even now I wish to think otherwise, that I\ndid not see him, but I am unable to do so.\nThe foregoing are just the plain facts of the case.\nWould you please give me your opinion ? I have given\nyou every detail and described easily and naturally just\nas it happened. I must thank you very much for David's\nphotograph. I shall always treasure it. We had been\nvery good friends though not intimate friends in the true\nsense of the word, as though I had known him for about\nfour months, we had been room-mates for about six\nweeks only. We had lots of discussions, political, social,\nand educational, but not once did we discuss anything\nbordering on the occult or spiritual.

I may mention that the Ught was particularly\ngood and bright, and there were no shadows or half\nshadows in the room. Outside it was still quite hght,\nbut being a foggy, cold day, I had my door closed and\nthe light on and the fixe going. I thmk that is aU the\nadditional information you require, as I understand from\nMr. M'Connel's letter. Jas. J. Larkin, 2nd Lt. R.A.F.\nLieut. Gamer-Smith's corroborative statement supphes evi-\ndence that Lieut. Larkin had identified the man who entered\nhis room on December 7, 1918, as Lieut. M'Connel before he\ncould have had any normal knowledge of the accident which\nhad only just occurred. The identification cannot therefore\nbe due to any trick of memory consequent on the news of\nthe accident. That being so, the only normal explanation\nwhich could be made to cover the facts would be one of\nmistaken identity. It was with this possibihty in mind that\nwe questioned Lieut. Larkin concerning the fighting of\nthe room. Obviously such a mistake would be far more\nlikely to occur in a dim hght. Lieut. Larkin 's reply on this\npoint is satisfactory. The fight, he teUs us, was good, and\nunder these circumstances it is very difiicult to suppose that\nLieut. Larkin could mistake a man, with whom he actuaUy\nhad conversation at a distance of only a few feet, for another\nman with whose voice and appearance he was perfectly familiar.\nA further argument against the theory of mistaken identity\nis that Lieut. Larkin observed that the man who entered his\nroom was wearing a naval cap. This was worn by only two\nother men at the aerodrome besides Lieut. M'Connel, neither\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgwick. [vAWt\nof whom, as we are assured by Mr. M'Connel who is person-\nally acquainted with them, \"could either in height, or build,\nor manner, or voice, have been mistaken for my son.\"\nI may add to these observations of the Editor, that,\napart from other reasons given, the hypothesis of mistaken\nidentity seems very difficult to maintain in face of the\nrecognition, not only of appearance, but of voice and of\nmanner of entering the room. Indeed, it would almost\nseem as if the person mistaken for Lieutenant M'Connel,\nif there was one, must have taken on his semblance to an\nextent amounting to a monstrous illusion, approaching so\nnearly to hallucination that its occurrence at the very\ntime, or within a few minutes of Lieutenant M'Connel's\ndeath, would itself suggest the operation of telepathy.\nIt will be observed that we know the apparition to\nhave been seen within a few minutes of the death, but\nnot whether it occurred before or after or at the actual\nmoment. If it preceded the death. Lieutenant M'Connel\ndreaming in a fainting condition may have imagined his\nexpedition successfully accomplished and himself returned\nto his quarters. In this case the details of the apparition\nmay have been due to the agent. They are, however,\nalso what might naturally be supplied by the percipient^\ngiven the time and place. A case in which the appari-\ntion occurred during a period of unconsciousness of the\nagent, and undoubtedly before his actual death is L.977\n(see below, p. 203).\nWe may take next the only other death coincidence in\nour collection in which the apparition speaks (L. 1146,\nJournal, Vol. XII., p. 59).\n(L. 1146.)\nThe case was sent to us by Professor A.

Superstition alone does not explain away\nthe coincidence. Telepathic agency is all the more prob-\nable for the reason that between Frau Rieken and her\nintended son-in-law there existed much sympathy and\naffection. On my first visit to Copacabana I examined\nthe room where the apparition was seen. . . .\nThe account written by Professor Alexander is as follows :\nIn the first half of November, 1904, popular disorders\nin Rio de Janeiro, which were ostensibly a protest against\nthe government project of obligatory vaccination, culmin-\nated in the revolt of the Military School. Marching\nfrom their quarters on the evening of the 14th of that\nmonth, imder the command of General Travassos, the\nstudents met and scattered the police force sent to inter-\ncept them. The firing took place about 11 o'clock p.m.\nat the spot where the Rua da Passagem opens on to the\nBotafogo shore. The neighbouring gas-lamps had been\nextinguished and the night was very dark, so that it is\nimpossible to loiow the exact details of all that occurred.\nIt is certain, however, that one of the first victims of this\nencomater was the alferes-alum.no, ^ Joao Sylvestre Caval-\ncante, who was, it seems, wounded in the back as he\nretired from a parley with the general in command of the\npohce and then killed outright by a second shot through\nthe head.

Immediately after the parley, as\nthe said alferes-alumno was returning, he was shot in the\nback by a bullet that came from the police brigade. On\npassing by me he told me he was woimded, and riding\n(by my advice) to the rear of the School, he fell im-\nmediately afterwards, and was dragged for a short distance\nby the horse which he was riding.\n\" N.B.\u2014When the alferes-ahimno Joao Sylvestre Caval-\ncante was crossing the Rua da Passagem, he was wounded\nby a Mauser bullet in the right parietal [bone], and this\nshot killed him. \"Ensign Tertuliano Potyguara.\"\nThis account of the death is said to be current among the\nmihtary students who are now detained in the different barracks\nawaiting their trial by court-martial.^ One of these, Mario\nClementino de Carvalho, declares that they left their quarters\nshortly after 10 o'clock and exchanged shots with the poUce\nabout 11\u2014certainly not later than 11.15.

Shortly before,\nindeed, he had made the hypothesis of his own. death a subject\nI\nfor jest. He left Copacabana never to return there ahve.\nNo reports whatever respecting the adhesion of the School\nto the insurrectionary movement reached the family that day.\nAbout 11 p.m. by their house clock (which was, however,\ntoo slow) a sound of firing was heard from over the hill,\ni But when, in spite of the advanced hour, Cavalcante did not\ni return, Frau Rieken felt very anxious, and for some time\nafter she had rethed to bed this state of uneasiness kept her\nawake. The room occupied by her and her husband is in\nthe upper part of the house, but as it is a small one and\nfiUed with large-sized furniture, the door is left wide open\nfor the sake of ventilation. She had already heard the clock\nstrike two ; it was therefore between 2 and 3 o'clock in the\nmorning when she suddenly saw Cavalcante standing at the\nentrance looking in upon her. He leant against the side of\nthe door, his right hand raised and holding to the jamb and\nhis left arm behind his back. He did not wear the regulation\nuniform in which he had been killed, but presented himself\nin the khaki undress he usually wore at home\u2014on his head\na felt hat with the brim turned down and a rose-coloured\nneckerchief round his neck. He seemed to be covered with mud\nand his face was overcast with sadness. \" Guarda 3Iimt,\"\nhe said. (\"Take care of Mimi.\") Frau Rieken 's first surprise\nwas succeeded by a sense of the impropriety of his being in\nthat part of the house at such an hour, and she was about\nto awake her husband.

On walking down to the electric-\ncar station at 8 o'clock Herr Rieken was informed of the\noccurrence of the revolt and of Cavalcante's death by some\nyoung men who were there reading the papers. At first he\ngave absolutely no credit to the report, and was convinced\nof its truth only after it had been confirmed by two naval\nofficers of his acquauitance. He proceeded at once to the\nMilitary School, whither the body had been transported. In\npreparing it for burial he cut away the miiform, which, al-\nthough not the same as that seen in the vision, was indeed\netauaed with the mud of the street. The shirt underneath\nwas soaked with blood, and a buUet had passed through the\nhead from one side to the other. Herr Rieken was also\ntold that the lad had been dragged by his horse after he had\nfallen.\nAbout a month later the same percipient had another\nvisual hallucination, to which, however, there seems to have\nbeen no comcidence in objective events. She saw the young\nman seated in his usual careless attitude on one of the chairs\nin her sitting-room.\nCavalcante had nearly completed his course of mihtary\nstudies. He was noted for his application and iiiteUigence,\nand recommended himself to all who knew him by a most\ninsinuating address. He was nearly 27 years old at the date\nof his death.\nThe loss of their intended son-in-law has not been the only\nmisfortune which the Riekens have had to bear in recent\ntimes. One of their children, a boy nine years of age, had\nbeen previously killed by a passing car. Some three hours\nbefore this accident a crash as of breaking crockery or bottles\nhad been heard in their store-room. On going thither they\nfound everything in perfect order, nor could any normal\ncause be found to account for the noise.\nFrom this accoimt, which has been carefuUy drawn up and\ncorrected in accordance with the statements of the various\nwitnesses, it appears that the lapse of time between Caval-\ncante's death at Botafogo and its nunciation at Copacabana\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 165\nwas roughly three hours\u2014probably a Uttle more.

The percipient\nwas a child too young to realise the circumstances, but\nthere can be little doubt that she had a definitely ex-\nternalised waking hallucination of sight about two hours\nafter the death of \" little Jack.\" At the same time, it\nis rather difficult to suppose agency of the dying infant\nspecially directed to the percipient. It seems more natural\nto imagine a kind of diffused telepathy in which the dying\nchild's mother, the anxious mother of the percipient, and\nthe clerk through whom the news of the death was\nnormally communicated (and whose knowledge seems to\nhave timed the hallucination), may all have been more or\nless concerned as well as the child who saw the apparition,\nthough it was only in the case of the latter that the\ntelepathic impact produced any conscious effect.

I can only teU him [Mr. Wales] I saw Eldred, and,\nPeggy, I shall never forget the joy that went through me\nor the horror when I looked and called and could not\nfind him or make him hear.

[part\ndid. When I told him how Mrs. B~\u2014 saw the W\nboy, Alec said it must have been a dream. One day-\nAlec said, I wonder if any one has seen Eldred, and I\nsaid yes I have, and I explained what I saw and how I\nfelt, and when I went to the Grand we took the same\nrooms and I showed him where Alley stood. He now\nbeheves we can see those who have gone. His belief is\nthe same as my own. If Alec had been with me at the\ntime, I would have called out to him and asked if he had\nseen Eldred, was he in the sitting-room. I only knew\nthe K s in Calcutta, and often when I spoke to them\nthey would laugh. So I never said a word about Alley.\nIn fact I thought it might be my own madness. I\nstarted a letter to you the same day and tore it up as\nI thought you would only say it was cracked. . . .\nSubsequently a further statement concerning her experience\nwas obtained from Mrs. Spearman in a letter to Mr. Wales,\nas follows :\n12 Jan., 1919.\nMy step-mother Mrs. Bowyer-Bower asked me to write\nto you about the vision I had of my brother.\nMy brother appeared to me on the 19th March, 1917.\nAt the time I was either sewing or talking to my baby,\nI cannot remember quite what I was domg at that\nmoment.

I thought he is only jokmg, so I called him\nand looked everywhere I could think of looking. It was\nonly when I could not find him I became very frightened\nand the awful fear that he might be dead.

Two weeks later I saw in the paper\nhe was missmg. Yet I could not brmg myself to believe\nhe had passed away. I did fancy once I saw my grand-\nmother, but she seemed very misty, so it may have been\nfancy.\nI did not tell any one of the vision I saw of my brother\nfor quite 1 or 2 months after I heard of his death, as I\nwas staying in the Grand Hotel, Calcutta, and did not\nknow anyone there very well. My husband was not with\nme and I did not write to him about it, because he did\nnot believe in these sort of things. However, I finally\ntold him before writing to Mi's. Bowyer-Bower. The\nonly reason I did not mention it was, I felt nervous people\nwould only say I had imagmed it, so decided to keep\nquiet on the subject. Dorothy C. Speabman.\nIt is mafortunate that Mrs. Spearman should not have\nmentioned her experience to anyone before she knew of her\nbrother's death, but this weak point in the evidence is to\nsome extent comiteracted, because the date of the experience\nis established by the circumstance (clearly recollected by Mrs.\nSpearman) that it occurred on the day upon which her baby\nwas christened. The christening of the child, as we are\ninformed by Mrs. Bowyer-Bower, took place on March 19,\n1917, the day of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death. It is very\nunUkely that Mrs. vSpearinan's memory would deceive her on\nsuch a point as that, and it is evident from her statements\nthat the experience was of a strikmg and unusual character,\nthe apparition being so completely developed as to make her\nthink momentarily that her brother was actually present in\nthe flesh. She states that the experience took place \"in\nthe latter part of the morning,\" which means that allowing\nfor the difference of longitude it occurred at about the time\nof Captain Bowyer-Bower's death, seemg that, so far as can be\nascertained, he died in France in the early morning of the\nsame day.\n2. Some visual impression of Captain Bowyer-Bower would\nalso appear to have been received at about the time of his\ndeath by his niece, a child of not quite three years old.\nThis incident was reported to Mr. Wales in a letter from\n\f172 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich.\nthe child's mother, Mrs. Chater, Captain Bowyer-Bower's\nsister, thus :\nJune 5th [1918].\nMy mother Mi-s. Bowyer-Bower tells me you wish me\nto write and tell you about my little girl sajdng she had\nseen my brother after he was killed.\nOne morning while I was still in bed, about 9.15, she\ncame to my room and said, \" Uncle Alley Boy is down-\nstairs,\" and although I told her he was in France, she\ninsisted that she had seen him. Later in the day I\nhappened to be writing to my mother and mentioned\nthis, not because I thought much about it, but to show\nthat Betty still thought and spoke of her imcle of whom\nshe was very fond. A few days afterwards we found\nthat the date my brother was missing was the date on\nmy letter. This letter has since been destroyed.\nThe child was a httle under three years old at the\ntime. ... I have never attached much importance to\nthis incident as it may be just only a childish lie.\nCecily Chater.\nConcerning the above letter Mrs. Bowyer-Bower wrote to\nMr. Wales as follows :\n8 St. Paul's Road, Bournemouth, \\2th June, 1918.\n. . .\n'\nAlley Boy '\nwas Eldred's pet name since he was\na baby. . . .\nI could not positively declare the date of Mrs. Chater's\nletter to me telling me what Betty saw.

Concerning the third impression received at about the\ntime of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death, Mrs. Bowyer-Bower\nwrote to Mr. Wales, thus :\nJune 12th, 1918.\n. . . Mrs. Watson, an elderly lady I have known many\nyears, wrote to me on the afternoon of March 19th\n[1917] after not corresponding with me for quite 18\nmonths, and said she felt she must write because she\nfelt I was in great anxiety over Eldred. (I have her two\nletters in store in London, fortunately.) I wrote back\nand said Eldred was fit and happy, and I simply took\nher waiting thus [as an] excuse for writing again after so\nlong. T asked her in my reply what she felt about\nEldred, and she rephed to this effect\u2014on the afternoon\nof the day she wrote, about tea time, a certain and\nawful feehng came over her that he was killed, etc., etc.\nIt was the day . . ,\nSubsequently m November, 1918, Mrs. Bowyer-Bower sent\nto Mr. Wales the first of the two letters MTitten to her by\nMrs. Watson, which runs as follows :\n3iarch 19, 1917.\nSomething tells me you are having great anxiety about\nEldred. WiU you let me know ? Also have you good\nnews of Tom ? . . .\nThe second of JNIrs. Watson's letters Mrs. Bowyer-Bower was\nnot able to find, but her statement is sufBciently corroborated\nby the first letter, given above, which is dated March 19,\n1917, the day of Captain Bowyer-Bower's death.\nThe last two experiences, that of the child and that of Mrs.\nWatson, are not in themselves very striking, and if either\nstood alone, it might be put down to chance-coincidence. But\n\fl\"^\"^ Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [parT\ntaken together, and especially taken in conjunction with Mrs.\nSpearman's remarkable experience, they are not without\ninterest, and if the agency of Captain Bowyer-Bower be\nassumed, they suggest that this agency was unusually power-\nful and was felt by more than one person.\nTwo^ later experiences, occurring after Captain Bowyer-\nBower's death was known, are also worth recording. They\ndo not fall mto the same category as the three experiences\nrelated above, as indicating laiowledge supemormally acquired,\nbut they were such as greatly to impress the percipients, and\nagani if Captain Bowyer-Bower's agency be assumed in the\ncase of the former experiences, they suggest that this agency\nhas continued to make itself felt since Captain Bowyer-Bower's\ndeath.\n4. The percipient in one case was Mrs. Bowyer-Bower, who\ndescribes her experience thus :\nJune 12, 1918.\nDurmg the night, either m the late part of Nov. or\nearly part of Dec. 1917, I came over very hot indeed and\nturned dowi the eiderdown, etc. Some few moments\nlater I became extraordinarily cold with a most unnatural\ncoldness. ...

At this point he turned his head\nvery shghtly and looked right into my face, and moistened\nhis hps shghtly with his tongue. I kept quite quiet,\nbut it quivered and shook so much and no chin came,\nand in my anxiety I put out my hands and said :\n\" Eldred,\nI see you,\" and it all flickered quite out, light and all.\nIt is possible it might have been a dream, one never can\nbe certain at night, but in my own mind I am satisfied\nit was not. The eiderdown was doubled over me in\nthe morning when I was called, and it is not one of my\nhabits to do things in my sleep. I certainly never slept\nafter this, and I got shghtly this cold feehng once or\ntwice after and continued small rays several times during\nthat night. Eldred referred to it through Mrs. Leonard\nin Jan. 1918. F. M. B. B.\n5. The percipient in the other case was Miss ^ta Highett\n(Captain Bowyer-Bower's fiancee), who describes it to Mrs.\nBowyer-Bower thus :\nThe Lodge, Hythe, January ith [1918].\n... I thmk I wiU tell you something that happened to\nme a short time ago. I certainly did not dream it, or\nimagine it, but of course it may be something to do with\nmy brain. I was going to tell you before, only I thought\nyou would think me mad. I heard a number of raps\nwhen I was m bed and I began to talk to Eldred, and\nasked him to rap twice if he was ever going to show\nhimself to me. Almost immediately two raps came ;\nI waited a long time but saw nothitig. Then I went\nto sleep. Afterwards I woke up and looked romid and\nsaw Eldred on the bed beside me, he was wearing his\nblue suit. I sat up and started talking to him, [Miss\nHighett records what she said, and that \" his hps started\nto move\" and made a reply \"just above a whisper\"].\nI then tried to touch him, but my hand went through\nhim, and like a fool I started to cry, and he disappeared.\nA letter from Mrs. Bowyer-Bower to Mr. Wales, written\non May 30, 1918, states that \"Miss Highett had her vision\n\f176 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nin Dec. [1917] ...\" In a subsequent letter, written in reply\nto questions put to her by Mr. Wales, IMiss Highett writes :\nSaturday \\5th [June, 1918].\n... At the time of my vision I knew of the experiences\nof Mrs. Bower and Mrs. Watson and Mrs. Chafer's child.\n[Miss Highett did not, however, know of the experience\nof Mrs. Spearman. See date of Mrs. Spearman's letter.]\nYou wish to loiow what I did between my waking and\nseeing the vision. As a matter of fact I saw Mrs.\nBower's son as soon as I woke up. After having seen\nthe vision I switched on the electric light, which is by\nmy bed, to look at the time and found it was four o'clock\nin the morning. I think you wiU know by this that I\nwas perfectly awake. ...\nLi a further letter to Mr. Wales Miss Highett says that\nwhen she had this vision \" Captain Bower seemed to have a\nlight all romid him that made him perfectly visible.\"\nThe last two appearances in this case were not of\ncourse phantasms of the living, but it is important to\nconsider them in connexion with the others, for taken all\ntogether the set of experiences cannot but suggest some\nspecial capacity in the agent to manifest himself which\ncould operate through various percipients and which\ncontinued after his bodily death.\nThe case suggests questions about percipiency as well as\nabout agency, for it is curious that the two persons, his\nmother and his fiancee, with whom one would have\nsupposed the dying agent would most have wished to\ncommunicate, appear to have received no impressions at\nthat time, while yet their later experiences suggest a\ncapacity for such impressions. Do we here find support\nfor a hypothesis, which other evidence renders plausible,\nthat even with persons who have a capacity for receiving\ntelepathic impressions and externahsing them for their\nnormal consciousness in the form of hallucinations or\notherwise, that cajDacity is not always available ?\nWith regard to two or more percipients in different\nplaces being affected by telepathic experiences concerning\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 177\nthe same agent, see below, p. 265 (L. 820), a case in\nwhich a lady attacked by serious illness appears to a\nsister and a niece in different rooms. Compare also\nL. 1210 (p. 268). We may also refer to a case (L. 1130,\nJournal, Vol. XI., p. 58) sent by Professor Alexander of\nRio de Janeiro, in which a young man dying of bubonic\nplague appears twice in a dream to a friend of his boy-\nhood, while a young lady to whom he was attached hears\nfootsteps and feels a hand-shake, which she took at the\ntime to be his leave-taking, almost at the moment of his\ndeath. I do not quote the case, which is long, because\nit is not a strong one. The young lady Imew of the\nagent's serious illness when she had her experience, and\nit is not quite clear whether the dreams took place within\ntwelve hours of the death or earher. In the Journal,\nVol. XII., pp. 302-307, will be found a case (G. 280) of\ndreams and impressions concerning the same deceased\nperson (known to be deceased) experienced by four persons\nwithin the same twelve hours or thereabouts. This is\ninteresting in the present connexion if we may assume\npostmortem agency, though in that case of course it is not\na case of phantasms of the living. The alternative hypo-\nthesis, that the percipients influenced each other, seems\non the whole rather strained in this case.\nThe next case (L. 834, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 213) may\nbe said to be a typical case of a simple apparition of\nthe dying seen when the percipient was in bed but awake.\nThe percipient did not allow her name to be printed, for\nfear of paining the relations of the friend who appeared.\n(L. 834.)\nJuly 4:th, 1889.\nI have noted down the remarkable incident I mentioned.\nThe time of its occurrence was in the early part of July,\n1885, between 1 and 2 in the morning. I was wide\nawake, not having slept at aU, when all of a sudden\nI was startled by a bright light, and I saw at my bedside\na taU figure, and distinctly recognised the face of a\nvalued old friend who resided many miles from my home.\n\f*78 Mrs. Henrij Sidgwick. [pARf\nHe was earnestly gazing at me, and on vanishing from\nmy sight the room became dark as before. My sister,\nwho occupied the next room, on hearing me make an\nexclamation, came in and fomid me strildng a Ught, when\nI told her whom I had seen. Strange to say we received\nan early communication from a member of his family\nacquaintuig us that our dear old friend had passed away\nat the very time he appeared to me.\nThe narrator's sister confirms the above statement as far\nas her part in it is concerned.\nWhat follows is from notes made by Mrs. Sidgwick im-\nmediately after talking over the above circumstances with the\ntwo ladies :\nThe gentleman who appeared was an old and intimate\nfriend of both sisters, and corresponded constantly with\nthem. They had not heard from him for a httle while\nbefore his death, and though they knew that he was\nailing they were not at all anxious, knew of no cause for\nspecial anxiety, and had not had their thoughts turned\nto him in any special way.\nThe lady who saw the apparition had not been to\nsleep\u2014she is a bad sleeper\u2014but was lying with her eyes\nshut trying to sleep. Suddenly she became aware of a\nbright light in the room and opening her eyes saw by her\nbedside the tall figure of her friend. The light, she told\nme, was hke day-light and was at the side of the bed\nwhere she saw the figure. She had time to see the\nfigure gazing earnestly at her and to notice that it was\nwraiDped m a cloak or dressing-gown. She saw half the\nfigure\u2014as far down, I suppose, as the bed would let her.\nApparition and light vanished together. She was startled\nand agitated, got out of bed and had some difficulty in\nfinding the matches and striking a fight, owing to her\nagitated condition.\nI do not think that either sister has now an independent\nrecollection\u2014apart from their knowledge of the day of i\nthe death\u2014of the day on which this strange experience\noccurred, but it made a deep impression on both, and\nwhen the letter announcing the death reached them,\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases: Impression Externalised. 179\nwhich must have been within two days, they were satisfied\nthat appearance and death were comcident. Their recol-\nlection that the appearance occurred not long after mid-\nnight is, I thiixk, independent of subsequent information,\nthough they are not quite sure whether it occurred\nbetween 12 and 1, or between 1 and 2.\nA search for the letter annoimcing the death, which\nthe percipient kindly undertook, proved fruitless, but the\ntime of its occurrence, mentioned in the letter, \" quite\nagreed,\" she writes, \" with the very time I noted down\nof his appearance to me. This coincidence surprised and\ngreatly impressed myself and sister.\"\nI was shown various newspaper cuttings relating to the\ndeath and funeral, from which I copied extracts. The\ndeath is announced as having occurred on July 5th, and\nan obituary notice stated that the cause was general\nbreak up rather than any specific ailment. In an account\nof the fimeral it was stated that on the coffin plate was\nthe inscription :\n\" Died July 6th, 1885, age 75 years.\"\nAs the ladies pointed out to me, the fact that the death\nwas announced in the newspapers as having occurred on\nthe 5th, and on the coffin plate as on the 6th, tends\nstrongly to show that it occurred very soon after mid-\nnight, and, therefore, confirms their recollection of its\ncoinciding in time with the apparition.\nI was told many things which showed that they were\nintimate friends of the gentleman who died, and that his\nthoughts might naturally turn to them.\nThe percipient assured me emphatically that she had\nhad no other experiences of the same kind.\nFor the accompanying hallucinatory illumination in this\ncase, compare the collective case (G. 241) below, p. 363.\nA case which was probably a clear one of an apparition\nof a dying person to a waking percipient is L. 1121,\nJournal, Vol. IX., p. 306.

[part\nwe have is that of Mrs. PhiUips who was cognisant of\nher husband's experience at the time, and is at first hand\nfor tlie fact that the apparition was seen and recognised\nbefore anything was knoMTi of the death. Briefly, Mr.\nPhillips was at work in his shop when he saw a former\nlodger, Mrs. Robotham, look ro^^nd the door. He was\nsurprised not to find her outside, but felt sure at the\ntime that he had seen Mrs. Robotham, whom he and his\nwife knew extremely well. A week later they learnt that\nshe had died about that time. The account was written\nabout three years after the event.\nThe following case (L. 1224, Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 47)\nwas brought to our notice by Mrs. Willett, an Associate\nof the Society, who wrote to us concerning it thus :\n(L. 1224.)\nFir Tree End, Hayward's Heath,\nSussex, November 7, 1918.\nI inclose an account written from dictation by the\nPercipient of an appearance to her of a friend who was\ndying at the time. Ada Orr, who is a single woman\nbetween 50 and 60, has been known to me nearly all her\nlife. She is an absolutely truthful and straightforward\nperson.

As I came\naway from the house, I distinctly saw Mrs. S who\nformerly lodged with Mrs. B standing by the comer\nof the house. Just hke a puff of cold air seemed to go\nover me.

When I saw Mrs. B a few\ndays later she told me about Mrs. S and how she had\nlonged to go \" home to die.\" She said this many times,\nbut the doctor would not agree to her beii^g removed.\nBefore her death Mrs. S had told her daughter how\nmuch she wished to see me.\n[Signed] Ada Orr.\nA further statement was obtained from Miss Orr, partly\nin reply to questions put by us, and partly by Mrs. WiUett,\nwho kindly saw Miss Orr on our behalf. According to the\ninformation thus received. Miss Orr did not mention her\nexperience to anyone before she heard of Mrs. S\u2014\u2014's death,\nexcept \"to an unloiown woman passing by \" Mrs. B 's\nhouse at the time. The date of her visit to Mrs. B and\nof her seeing the apparition is, however, clearly fixed in her\nmuad, as she told Mrs. WiUett, by the circumstance that these\nevents occurred on the day on which she heard of the birth\nof a great-niece. Mrs. WiUett informs us that the child was\nbom on October 3, 1918, and the postcard announcing the\nbirth was received by IMiss Orr on October 4, 1918. The\nmistake in Miss Orr's original statement, m which the date\nof her visit to Mrs. B was given as October 3, arose\ndoubtless through that being the date of the child's birth\nby means of which she had fixed the date of her experience.\nA written statement was obtained from Miss Orr on this\npoint, thus :\nDecember 17 [1918].\nI remember the date by hearing of the birth of my\nniece's Baby which I heard of by P.O. on the day that\nI saw Mrs. S .

At the time I saw her\nI had had a long walk and was tired, thought I would\ncall at Mrs. B 's for a rest, and heard afterwards\nshe was with Mrs. S who was dying, which I knew\nnothing about.

E. W.\nIt will be seen that it was not possible in this case to obtain\ncorroborative evidence from any one to whom Miss Orr had\nrelated her experience prior to her knowledge of Mrs. S 's\ndeath ;\nbut her original statement was made only a month\nafter the experience occurred, when it was still fresh in her\nmind, and there appears to have been nothing m the circum-\nstances, as known to Miss Orr at the time, which would\nlead her to imagine that she saw Mrs. S .

The next case (L. 1087,\nJournal, Vol. VIII., p. 41) suggests the same thing, for\nthere seems to have been practically no link between\nagent and percipient except that the latter knew the\nformer well by sight and was accustomed to see him\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 183\nwalking where his phantasm appeared\u2014^the place towards\nwhich she happened to be looking at the moment.

F. M. Benecke, was an Exhibitioner of\nBalliol College, Oxford, and, as his posthumous work on\n\" The Position of Women in Greek Poetry \" shows, a classical\nscholar of the highest promise. He was a good Alpine climber,\nand was collaborating in a guide to the Swiss Alps at the\ntime of his death. On the day on which it occurred, he was\nseen in Mrs. Benecke's garden by the daughter of her laundress.\nThe percipient writes to Mrs. Benecke :\n80, Mayes-road, Wood Green,\nFebruary 1st, 1897.\nMadam,\u2014Mother has this morning brought your letter\nto Emma over to me, as I could better write what\nhappened on July 16th, 1895, as it was me that saw\nMr. Edward with another gentleman in the garden (as\nI thought). I remember it all so well that I have been\nable to write it just as it happened.\u2014Yours respectfully,\nE.

[part ^\ni\nOn Tuesday, July 16th, 1895, between the hours of 1 ;\nand 2 o'clock, I was doing some work in our bedroom\nand, looking out of the window, saw (as I thought) Mr.\nEdward Benecke with another young gentleman walking\nin the garden, and I went at once to mother and told\nher Mr. Edward had come home, and she said something\nmust have prevented him from starting, as we knew he\nwas going to Switzerland for his holiday, for I was positive\nit was him I saw. When nurse came in on the Thursday,\nmother asked her if Mr. Edward had come home, and she\nsaid \" No \" and then we only said \" I thought I saw\nhim,\" and we thought no more about it until the sad\nnews reached us. Ellen Cakter.\nIn answer to some questions from Mrs. Benecke, Mrs. Nichols\nwrites further :\n80, Mayes-road, Wood Green,\nFebruary 4th, 1897.\nMadam,\u2014I am glad to be able to answer the questions\nyou have asked me. I did see another young man with\nMr. Edward (as I thought it was) and the look was not\nmomentary, for I was so surprised to see him that I\nwatched him until he turned round the path ; he was\ncoming, as he sometimes did after luncheon, from the\nstable yard, along the path and turned towards the\nhouse. He was smiling and talking to his friend, and I\nparticularly noticed his hair, which was wavy as it always\nwas ; he had nothing on his head. It was all that that\nmade me feel so sure it was him, and I felt that I could\nnot have been mistaken, knowing him so well. I cannot\ntell you anything [about] what the other yoimg gentleman\nwas like, as he was walking the other side ; also I hardly\nnoticed him at all, being so surprised to see Mr. Edward.\nMother was doubtful when I told her about it and said\nI must be mistaken ; but I said I was sure I was not, j|\nand I was positive I had seen him, and I felt sure he\nhad come home until nurse came in and said he had not\nbeen home, and then I thought how strange it was, and\neven then I could not think I was so mistaken, and\noften have I thought about it and feel even now that it\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 185\nwas him I saw. Mother did say perhajas some accident\nhad happened to his friend that he was to travel with\nand so was prevented from going ; that was the only\nremark that was made about an accident.\nIf there is any other question I can answer, I shall be\nonly too glad to do it for you. E. Nichols.\nMrs. Benecke gives the foUowing particulars :\nTeddy was in the habit of walking regularly in the\ngarden, from 10 minutes past 12 till 1 o'clock, and again\ndirectly after limcheon, varying, according to the time this\nmeal took us, from 1.30 or 1.45 till 2.30. He was so\nregular that I could teU the time by his footfall on the\nstairs. He never, except in the very coldest weather\n\u2014\nto please me\u2014^wore a hat or cap in the garden. The\nlamidress often watched him walking up and do\\TO the\ngarden paths, noticing the wind playing with his wavy\nhair. She even, at times, would get up on a stool to\nwatch him, especially when Margaret was with him.\nShe says they looked so bright and happy together.\nShe has left us owing to her health, and her daughter\nmarried quite lately.\nTeddy was devoted to his \" dear mountains,\" they\nwere a \" second home \" to him ; but aU his letters prove\nthat his thoughts were very much with us on the cUmbs.\nHe wrote to me in 1892 that when bivouacking out even\nin his Bietschhom, \" it felt strange to be so far away,\nso high up, and as I wrapped myseK in my rug, I thought\nof you all, sitting roimd the lamp, etc.\" In 1895 he\nwrote, after his successful crossing the Wetterliicke, (a\nchmb he was quite delighted with) \" at 8.30,\u2014just as you\n'\nwere coming down to breakfast, I was thinking\u2014we were\nthrough.\" The last chmb he wrote about to both Mar-\ngaret and myself he said :\n\" The last half-hour was not\npleasant ; it Avas the only time during the chmb that I\nwas not sorry you (Margaret) were not with us.\" With\na heart so fuU of thought and love of us at home, even\nwhen intensely interested and occupied in his dearest\npursuit, it seems natural that when called to leave us once\nmore, he should have turned towards us and sent his\n\f86 Mrs. Henry SidgivicJc. [part\nloving thoughts home. That they took his shape and\nwere seen once more on his famihar path seems very-\nwonderful and of course inexphcable, but to me seems a\nfact. I beheve that he was taken when his form appeared\nhere. It makes it somewhat more difficult to conjecture\nwhere it happened, as he intended to be back by 4 and\nthis time\u2014between 1 and 2\n\u2014gives therefore only 3 hours\nfrom Ried. i\nI wrote to our former laimdress Avith respect to her\nhaving seen Teddy on July 16th, 1895. Our old nurse\ntold me that it was the younger daughter, Emma, who\nhad seen him. I could not, at the time Mrs. Carter left\nour service, November, 1895, trust myself to speak to her\nabout it ; therefore I was rather uncertain as to what\nreally had been said, and when I received the first letter,\nI wrote for a few more particulars.\nIt was through this letter that I heard, for the first\ntime, that EUen Carter saw two forms, which seems all\nthe more remarkable to me. I therefore wondered if\nshe could remember the face of the friend. I had under-\nstood she had seen him \" about one o'clock \" and had\nthought it was m his morning walk, but EUen is positive\nthat it was later. His coming out of the stable yard\nis quite Ukely ; he often fetched the dog. I asked her\nif it was a \" momentary passing view \" she had, as in\nthe first letter she writes almost as if she had merely\nlooked out and then gone to her mother.\nWhen I heard this talked about, I remembered the\nword \" accident \" and asked her if it was mentioned.\nHer answer in [the second] letter refers to this question.\nIn answer to our further enquiries, IVIrs. Benecke wrote :\nNorfolk Lodge, Basnet, February 15th, 1897.\nI will do my best to answer your questions and to do\nit clearly and systematically.\nEllen Carter lived with her mother and sister in a\ncottage in our garden. I have tried to give you an idea of\nthe cottage by [a sketch not reproduced i].\nI took this sketch\nfrom our dining-room window, past which the broad path\n[^But see plan on opposite page.]\n\fLXXXVi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 187\nleads, which I called A.- Along this path my son went\ndaily and often have I watched his hght swingmg steps\ntiU he had gone through the httle gate I called B. jThis\nleads into our kitchen garden. I had mderstood that\nwhen Ellen saw him on July 16th, 1895, he was coming\nback from his first walk through the gate B and had\nturned towards our house down the path A. You will\neasily imderstand that during the first months, I could\nnot ask questions about the events of that day,\u2014nor, in\nfact, can I now. But I was told of EUen having seen\nI. Window in cottage.\nC. Path leading to stables.\nmy son almost directly after my return, and J\\'Ir. Benecke\nheard of it at once. I will return to this directly. EUen\nwas in her mother's house tidying their bedroom (which\nhas the window I have marked I), when, looking up,\nshe saw my son. She tells about that herself and that\nhe \"was coming out of the stable yard.\" That would\nnot be quite his usual direction, because he mostly jumped\nout of the window after luncheon, but still it did happen\nthat he would fetch the dog, or put him aAvay, in the\nyard. The door leading into the yard is behind bushes\nand he would, according to Ellen's account, have come\nfrom there and out where the path D comes out towards\n\f188 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick.\nour house. You will, I hope, understand from this about\nthe distance from the cottage to the path, and that it\nwould be quite easy for EUen, who seems to have quite\ngood sight, to have seen him distinctly and for a minute\nat least.\nMrs. Carter cannot write, so it would only be what\nEUen wrote for her which we should get by asking for her\nversion. Our old nurse, who can write, is very confused\nabout what and when she first heard of it, and therefore\nshe can write down nothing. I have asked her several\ntimes about it all, but she varies each time in her state-\nments, except that she remembers Mrs. Carter asking her\nif \" Mr. Teddy had come home,\" and then her saying\n\" Oh, I told NeUie she was mistaken, when she thought\nshe saw him.\" She could not have spoken hke that if\nthe conversation had taken place after we heard the\nterrible news. Mr. Benecke remembers that the gardeners\ntold him, after the news, that EUen had said she had\nseen Mr. Teddy, and the general impression has certainly\nbeen that she had said so, and therefore had believed\nit, that she had seen him in the garden, on that day.\n[She is convinced] that it was \" Mr. Teddy, no one else\n\"\nshe saw, for she said that she knew his pretty wavy hair\ntoo weU to make a mistake, and she quite sulked when\nit was proved to her that she was mistaken.\nWe heard the terrible news on Saturday morning, July\n20th, and I started five minutes later to catch the traia\nand go over to Switzerland. Of course the servants\nheard of it at once, and NeUie then is said to have been\nvery much startled when she heard it. There has never\nbeen any doubt in our minds here that she had all along\nsaid she had seen him on the Tuesday.\nThere have been printed notices of my dear boy's loss\nin many papers. We have no means of fixing the hour\nof it. AU we loiow of his plans for July 16th was that\nhe started with Mr. Cohen at 3 a.m. from Ried, and was\nseen at 3.30 a.m. at Blatten, and that he had arranged\nwith the guides of Ried to meet him there at 4 p.m.\no'clock on the Tuesday, 16th, to settle details for a tour\non the 17th. My son was very accurate and always\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases: Impression Externalised. 180\nplanned his tours exactly before starting. The guides\ntold me that he knew every inch of ground in the neigh-\nbourhood. He was working for Mr. Coohdge and there\nwas but one ridge of rock not yet explored in the district\nassigned to him. I feel certain that the two friends\nstarted for that ridge \" Feenkiindl \" and that there they\nare now resting. This conviction has gradually become\nclear to me, but since I have understood the whole\nquestion, the weather has made all search impossible. . . .\nMabie Benecke.\nMrs. Benecke also sent us the accompanying ground plan\n(not drawn to scale) lettered as in her sketch, showing the\nposition of the percipient in relation to the place where the\napparition was seen.\nThe seeing of a second figure with a realistic recognised\napparition is rare, but there are other examples. The\nsubject is discussed in Gurney's book, Chapter XII., \u00a7 6,\nin connexion with the case he numbers 202.\nThere is an old case, qviite typical (L. 947, Journal,\nVol. VI., p. 9), namely, the appearance of Sir T. F.\nBuxton's gamekeeper, Curtis, to his brother at the time\nof his death through an accident in 1834. It was looked\ninto at the time, and recorded by Sir T. F. Buxton the\nday after it happened. The account in the Jo7irnal is\nprinted from what purports to be a copy of the original\nrecord. I think it is unnecessary to quote it here.\nThe next case (L. 1204, Journal, Vol. XVII., p. 204) is\npeculiar in that the percipient was ill, had been at times\ndelirious, and may have been so at the moment of the\napparition. The dream-like character of the earlier part\nof her experience does not look as if she was in an\nordinary waking condition, though the later part seems\nto have been like a waking hallucination and unlike her\ndelirious imaginings. There is, of course, no reason why\na telepathic hallucination should not occur during illness\nor delirium, and coincidence in time between this ex-\nperience and the death seems to have been very close.\n\f190 Mrs. He7ify Sidgwich. '\\\n[part\n(L. 1204.)\nThe case was first brought to our notice by a paragraph\nin the daily press on June 6, 1916, in which it was stated\nthat\n:\nThe sister of Seaman George WiUiam Malpress, of\nPeterborough, one of the men who went down with the\nQueen Mary, had a reahstic dream last Wednesday\n[the day the Queen Mary was lost]. She was lying\nill hi bed when she thought that her brother came to her\nbedside, and altliough she spoke to him repeatedly he\nwould not answer. He appeared quite well and happy.\nSubsequently, m reply to enquiries, we received the following\naccount from the percipient, Mrs. Baxter\n:\n56, New Rd., Peterboeo', June 19, 1916.\n... in reference to my dream\u2014as it was published in\nthe papers, but it was not a dream, it was a vision. I\nwas very ill at the time. It was the afternoon of the\nday of the battle that I saw my brother. I was taken\nworse and thought I was gomg to die. I was with my\nbrother on his ship and he was so happy and smging, and\nthen it changed and he was at home on leave. I thought\nI repeatedly spoke to him each time but he did not speak\nto me. I loiew I was iU, and thought he would not\nspeak because I was disfigured. I asked my mother if\nhe had gone back and she said he had not been home.\nI said I knew he had, it seemed so real. I was very\nmuch upset because he would not speak to me. I did\nnot hear of the sinking of the Queen Mary ujitil a\nweek after, as I was too ill for my mother to tell me. . . .\nIt would be just about the time when the ship went down\nthat I saw my brother, as it was late in the afternoon\non Wednesday, May 31. F. Baxter.\nOn June 29, 1916, the Secretary of the Society, Miss Newton,\nwent to Peterborough and called upon Mrs. Baxter and her\nmother, Mrs. Malpress, who kindly answered all the questions\nshe put to them. Theu- evidence, as noted and summarised by\n\fLXxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 191\nMiss Newton at the time, and confirmed by their signatures,\nwas as follows :\nOn May 31 Mrs. Baxter was suffering from erysipelas,\nand had been ill from the previous Friday. About 5\no'clock in the afternoon she \"felt something snap inside\nher, and part of herself seemed to have gone out of her ;\nshe thought she was dying.\" Then she seemed to be on\na ship, or verj^ near it ; she could see the sailors moving\nabout, and heard them singing ;\nthey were very happy.\nShe spoke to her brother on the ship ; he wouldn't answer.\nShe called for a scarf he had given her, so that she could\nhide her face, as she was disfigured. Then the scene\nchanged, she was at home, her brother was at home, she\nspoke to him, but he wouldn't answer. She cried, thinkmg\nit was because she was disfigured. The vision went. She\nwas stiU very upset because he wouldn't speak to her.\nShe asked her mother if her brother had gone back.\nShe had never had a vision, or a dream, of this kind\nbefore. (Signed) Florence Ethel Baxter.\nJune 29, 1916.\nMrs. Malpress said that her daughter had been \" lightheaded\non and off \" during her iUness, but that at the time of the\nvision she seemed \" listless and blank.\" She continued\n:\n\u2022\nWhen she had this kind of blank feeling come over\n:\nher, I went down to find some one to fetch the doctor\nas I thought she was dying. When I went up again\nshe was crying, and seemed very upset. I asked her\nwhat was the matter. She said WiU had been to see\nher, and he wouldn't speak to her. The following morning\nI said, \" How did WiU look ?\n\" \" Just as usual,\" she\nsaid ; \"I thought he was here home on leave. He was\nin his uniform, and very bright and happy.\"\n(Signed) Hannah Malpress.\nJune 29, 1916.\nThe news of the Battle of Jutland, mcluding the announcement\nof the loss of H.M.S. Queen Mary was pubUshed on Saturday\nmorning, June 3, 1916. In the casualty hst, which appeared\n\f192 Mrs. Henry Sidgwic'k. [par*\na few days later (our reference is the Daily Telegraph, June 8)\nthe name of G. W. Malpress, A.B., was included in the crew\nof the Queen Mary.\nIt is stated in Admiral Sir John Jeh\/coe's despatch on the\nbattle, pubhshed in the press, July 7, 1916, that the action\nbegan at 3.48 p.m. (Greenwich mean time) on May 31 ; and\nin the various reports by observers, that the Queen Mary\nsank soon afterwards. In an article ia the Daily Telegraph on\nJune 6, Mr. Hurd, indicating approximately, the course which\nthe battle took, says :\nQuite early in the action the Queen Mary, by an\nunfortunate mischance, or good German gunnery, was hit,\nand sank in a few minutes. ... It should be emphasised\nthat this misfortune occurred almost immediately after\nthe action opened.\nThus, it will be observed that the coincidence in time\nbetween the hallucination, which occurred about 5 p.m.,\nsummer time, and the death of Seaman G. W. Malpress,\nwhich occurred soon after 4.48, summer time, was very close.\nIt is chiefly owing to this coincidence in time that we print\nthe case, contrary to our practice of excluding hallucinations\noccurring during iUness where deUrium is present. The evi-\ndence is further strengthened by the following considerations\n:\n(1) the hallucination seems to have been the only one which\nassumed definite form during the illness ; (2) it was certainly\nthe only one described by the percipient during this time\n;\nand (3) it was miique in her experience.\nThese points will be apparent from the evidence on the\nmedical aspect of the case, kindly contributed, in answer to\nour enquiries, by Dr. H. Latham, of Peterborough, who was\nattending the percipient. The questions which were put to him\nare given below in square brackets :\nJuly 3, 1916.\n[How long was the percipient dehrious, and was the\ndelirium intermittent ?]\nFrom Monday night, May 29, mitil the end of the week.\nYes ; she appeared to ramble and say \" queer things\n\"\n(the mother's report to me) only at night. In the morning\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 193\nor afternoon when I saw her she seemed clear in her\nmind.\n[Was this particular hallucination described to you\nbefore the news of the Naval Battle on May 31 was known\nto the pubUc ?]\nI cannot fix the day, but I can say positively that I\nwas told of it, both by Mrs. Malpress and Mrs. Baxter,\nlong before the latter had any information of the Naval\nBattle or the death of young Malpress. Mrs. Baxter did\nnot know anjrthing about the Naval Battle, etc., until\na fuU week after it had occurred, as I gave strict orders\nthat she was not to be told. About a week after the\nBattle, say Wednesday, June 7, she picked up a paper\nwithin her reach and saw the hst of officers or men on\nthe Queen Mary. It was many days before this that\nI was mformed of the vision, both by the mother and\nMrs. Baxter.\nLater, Dr. Latham wrote as follows :\nJuhj 15, 1916.\nMy distinct impression is that the hallucination was\nmentioned to Mrs. Malpress before the Naval Battle was\nknown of. But I really cannot fix the date when it was\ntold to me. All I can say is that, when I was told of\nthe hallucination, I questioned ]\\Irs. Baxter, and she told\nme quite simply that she had seen her brother on the\ndeck of his ship, that he looked quite as usual, but never\nspoke a word. She told me this many days before she\nknew of the Battle, but I cannot fix the date.\n[Were any other hallucinations described to you during\nthe illness ? And have you heard of any experiences of\nthe same kind that Mrs. Baxter ever had ?]\nNo, only that she said such \" queer things.\"\nI am quite sure that neither Mrs. Malpress nor Mrs.\nBaxter have ever had any other previous experience of\nthe kind. They took no interest in the subject when I\nwas first informed of it, which was early, and long before\nanything appeared in the papers.\n(Signed) H. Latham, M.B. (Edin.), etc.\n\fi94 Mrs. Henry Sidgwicic. [part\nAnother unusual case is (L. 1159, Journal, Vol. XIII.,\np. 103) one peculiarity being that the experience was in\npart collective. The apparition, if it was one, was seen out\nof doors and among other people first by one percipient,\nand again, a few minutes later and in another position,\nby him and a friend together. There was nothing at the\ntime to suggest to them that they had not seen a real\nman\u2014^no disappearance for instance. They saw him\namong other people in places where he might naturally\nhave been and left him there, and only suspected any-\nthing mysterious when they learnt some hours later that\nthe man they thoiight they had seen had not been there, he\nhaving in fact been drowned the night before. In this\ncase the collectivity alone would have been interesting,\nbut there are so many other unusual features\u2014the repeti-\ntion of the apparition and in a different form after the\npercipient had gone away and returned ; the persistence\nof the second appearance to both percipients ; the total\nabsence of anything suggesting a hallucination\u2014that in\nspite of difficulties I feel almost certain that there was\neither a mistake of identity or a confusion of dates ;\ntherefore, as it is a long case, I do not quote it here.\nSo far the apparitions occurring at the time of the\ndeath of the person seen which have been quoted have\nall been realistic ; in appearance, position, and movement,\nwhen movement occurred, they have been like real people,\nand in most instances have at the moment been mistaken\nfor such. The dress and aspect of the apparition have,\nmoreover, been appropriate to the situation in which it\nwas seen, and, with the possible exception of L. 1146\n(p. 160), have conveyed no information as to that in which\nthe agent actually was. I will now quote two dreams\nwhich have the same characteristics, though with the\naddition of the dramatisation, which, as remarked above\n(p. 29), is so common in dreams.\nThe first of the two dreams (L. 1179, Journal, Vol.\nXIV., p. 295) was sent to us by Major-General Carey,\nwho carefully examined the witnesses and obtained their\nstatements.\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 195\n(L. 1179.)\nThe dreamer's account is as follows :\n30 AncHEKS Road,\nSouthampton, April I4,th, 1910.\nI, Charlotte Cox, am in the service of ]\\Iiss Lydia Le\nCocq, who resides at No 30 Archers Road, Southampton.\n(I have been upwards of 38 years in her service and in\nthat of her cousin, Mrs. Laurence, who died in 1889.)\nMy mistress being in poor health, I am accustomed to\nsleep in her room.\nOn Sunday, 19th December, 1909, at about 7 a.m., I\nhad a vivid dream. I thought I saw an old friend of\nmine standing in the doorway (half-open) between the\nbed-room and the landing. I said in my dream, \" 0\nhere is Susan.\" She appeared to be dressed in her\nbonnet and mantle, looking quite natural, hke herself as I\nrecollect her, though I had not seen her for some years.\nIVIiss Le Cocq, I thought, turned round with a smile to\nwelcome her, she being an old acquaintance, having hved\nfor upwards of 50 years in the family, with Dr. Le Cocq,\nMiss Le Cocq's uncle, and Mrs. Barnes, his daughter,\nboth now deceased. She had married a Mr. Thomas\nBrailey about 20 years ago, being then upwards of 60\nyears of age, and hved with him in Guernsey tiU his\ndeath about three years ago, afterwards in Jersey.\nThe dream was a short one, and I awoke at about my\nusual hour in the winter, 7 a.m.\nI mentioned the fact of having had the dream that\nmorning, both to Miss Le Cocq, and also to my feUow-\nservant, Lihan Alhneritter, who too has been 17| years\nwith Miss Le Cocq.\nOn the next evening, Monday, 20th December, 1909,\nI received a notice from Messrs.

There had been no mention of Dr.\nX. in conversation, nor had Mrs. Mama been thmldng of\nhim, and she knows of nothmg which would have been\nlikely to suggest the dream. She is quite sure that the\ndream occurred on the night of Friday, January 22nd,\nand I think her recollection of this is mdependent of\nher knowledge of the date of the death, though she has\nnothing very definite to remember it by. She told it on\nSaturday morning to Dr. Mann and in the course of the\nday to Miss C . It was Miss C who on February\n11th wrote out the account of it, which Dr. and JVIrs.\nMann signed. On Monday, January 25th, Mrs. Mann\ntold the dream to Miss T , and she has promised to\nask her to write an independent account. She showed\nme the memorial notice of Dr. X.'s death on January\n23rd. This reached Dr. Mann on January 30th, as is\nshown by the post-mark. Mrs. Mann does not remember\nhaving had any other vivid and reahstic dream that\nimpressed her as this one did, nor any that made an\nimpression which she felt it worth while to mention next\nday. She has, however, had presentiments ; one of them\nwas of her father's illness and death a few days before he\n\f198 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\ndied suddenly.

As she was\nthen unwilling to make any statement on the matter,\nI may perhaps be allowed to mention that I had a short\nconversation with her several weeks after the event ; and\nthat she then spoke of Mrs. Mann's dream as curious, and\nshowed that she was at that time ignorant of the doctor's\ndeath. Unfortunately the conversation was interrupted\nbefore I had an opportunity of asking for her corroborative\nevidence.\nI have also seen a pencil note that Dr. Mann made\nin his diary under the date Saturday, \" January 23rd ;\nX.

My father died on January 23rd, 1904, at about\n4.30 a.m. Though he had been an invahd for some\nyears, his death was not expected till a seizure 5 days\nbefore his death.

[part\nFrom time to time my wife had already seen ghosts\nbefore, which threw her into a great state of excitement.\nI consequently did my utmost to persuade her not to pay\nany attention to such phenomena and to consider them\nas the fruit of imagination. My wife had never seen\nanything supernatural for the last two years, and was\ninexpressibly glad of it. She is a woman of a quiet\nand equable character, and is not nervous generally. On\nthe 16th (28th) of February, no one of us had any reason\nto be excited or to thuik about Meinander, as, according\nto information that was to hand, both he and his family\nwere in excellent health. When my wife related to me\nher vision in the morning of February 17th, I laughed\nat her and requested her not to think about this case,\nwhich I considered to be a hallucination. The first news\nof Meinander's unexpected demise was received by us on\nFebruary 18th, when we read in the [mihtary] \" order of\nthe day \" [appended to the original narrative in Russian]\nthat Meinander was dead and that a fimeral service for\nthe rest of his soul was to be celebrated ; and the next\nmorning we read in the [obituary notices of the] Novoie\nVremia, No. 6,816, that he had died on February 16th\n(28th), at nine o'clock in the evening.\nColonel Alexis-Alexeievitoh Bboussilofe.\nIn connexion with this may be mentioned a case (L. 839,\nJournal, Vol. IV., p. 268) where a dark shadowy figure\nwas seen moving across the room by Miss M. Thelemann.\nIt was unrecognised, but some hours later the thought of\na dear friend came suddenly into her mind and she\nafterwards learnt that the friend died at that time. As\nthe experience was unrecorded till nearly four years after\nits occurrence and is uncorroborated, I do not quote it\nin full. Such undeveloped veridical hallucinations are,\nhowever, quite conceivable, and indeed there is reason to\nthink that they occur.

It was received\nthrough Miss E. Sturge of Chilliswood, Tyndall's Park,\nBristol. The percipient, here called Miss G., gave her\nreal name in confidence. She wrote :\n(L. 978.)\nApril \\st, 1891.\nI saw my brother, who was ill at the time, lying in his\nberth, dressed in his clothes. The ship was moving slowly\nalong\u2014it was a bright moonUght night and everything\nwas exceedingly quiet and peaceful. At first he appeared\nasleep, but at length opened his eyes, gave me a bright\nsmile and one long look and then closed them again.\nApparently I saw him just a few hours before he died.\nAs far as I can remember, it was after midnight on the\n29th of December, 1886. I was in bed, and very tired,\nafter the exertions of a children's Christmas party. Of\ncourse I was anxious about my brother, but from that\ntime all anxiety seemed to cease. When anyone con-\ngratulated me upon the safe arrival of the vessel, it seemed\nto make no cheerful impression, and I ceased from that\ntime writing the weekly letters which I had been in the\nhabit of sending, although we did not hear of his death\nuntil February 7th, 1887. I was 22 years old at the\ntime. I had not seen my brother since the 22nd of\nSeptember, 1886, the date when the vessel left the docks.\nMiss Sturge adds :\nMiss G.'s brother had not been in good health, and had\ntravelled a good deal on account of it, but the family\n\f214 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part'\nwere not especially anxious about him at the time of his\ndeath. He was going alone to Austraha and died very\nshortly before arrival, and it was almost by accident;\nthat the family heard of his death.\nMiss Sturge writes later :\nJuly 27th, 1891.\nI find from a letter I have received from [Miss G.]\nthat she does not quite know whether she was asleep or\nawake at the time of her vision, but says she is certain\nshe was awake immediately after. She sends me the\nprinted invitation to the children's party on the 28th\nDecember, 1886, and she sends also a copy of the letter\nfrom the wife of the captain of the ship on which her\nbrother was at the time of his death, by which I see that\nhe died at 10 p.m. on the 29th Deceniber, the dream or\nvision thus preceding the death. Mss G. repeats that\nshe was so certain that her brother was dead that she\nrefused to write to him or send him anything. She made\nno written memorandum at the time, but spoke of it to\nMr. and Mrs. M. with whom she was then and is now\nhvmg [as their governess].\nShe seems to have been in the habit of dreaming of\nher brother, as she was very fond of him.\nMr. Myers called on Miss G., on December 18th, 1891, and\nwrites :\nI saw Miss G. yesterday. She thinks that her experience\nought to be classed as a dream, although it was more\nvivid than any other dream she remembers, and woke\nher up so thoroughly that she got up and did not sleep\nagam for some hours.\nThis dream alone of all that she has had showed her\nbrother ill and altered, as he in fact was altered before\ndeath.\nShe did not tell Mr. and Mrs. M. until the news had\narrived. She intentionally kept the invitation card (which\nI saw), as a memento of the date, not wishing to put\non paper what she regarded as so private a matter.\n\f,xxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Im-pression Externalised. 215\nThe best proof of the importance of this dream in her\neyes is that she never once wrote to her brother again,\nalthough she was devotedly attached to him, and used\nto write by every, or almost every, mail. Had he been\nalive, he would have missed her letters with surprise and\npain. I have seen the captain's wife's letter. The\nbrother died at Port Adelaide between 7 and 10 p.m.\non the 29th, which would be in England from 9.40 to\n12.40 a.m. on the '\n29th. The vision therefore preceded\nthe death by less than 12 hours.\nThe brother had in fact been mainly lying dressed in\nhis berth towards the last, not being strong enough to\nbe much on deck.\nF. W.

As it is, it was quite by accident that Mr. M.\nfound out about it.

Before giving my account to Miss Sturge,\nI got both Mr. and Mrs. M. to read it through, not\nliking to trust entirely to my own memory, and they\nboth thought it correct.\nMr. M. corroborates as follows :\nDecember 2\\st, 1891.\nWith reference to the particulars which have been\ngiven by Miss G. respecting the dream she had on the\nnight of her brother's departure from this life, I perfectly\nrecollect her telling me when the news arrived that she\n\f216 Mrs. Henry Sidgtvich.

She then\ndescribed minutely to me the surroundings of the room,\netc., on the ship where he died, and named other par-\nticulars which the witten accounts I subsequently read\nfrom the wife of the captain of the vessel markedly\nconfirmed.\nI should perhaps say Miss G. is, and always has been,\nvery averse to conversing on the subject, and I have\nalways abstained from pressing her to do so, and from\ntroubling her by anything hke cross questions on the\nsubject. Miss G. was deeply attached to her brother,\nand had seen him off on his leaving England.\nThe next case (L. 973, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 249) was\nreceived through the American Branch. In the first\ninstance a second-hand account of the case was sent\nto Dr. Hodgson by Miss Lilian Whiting, in May, 1891.\nThe percipient prefers that her name should not be\nprinted.\n(L. 973.)\nMiss Whiting writes :\nHotel Brunswick, May 21th, 1891.\nDeah Dr. Hodgson,\u2014Miss tells me the following,\nand gives her permission to my relating it to you.

When\nMiss reached the place, she told her sister-in-law\nthe words of the dream before the sister-in-law had told\nher what their mother actually said, and the lady who\nwas present with the dying woman was startled at the\ncoincidence of the actual last words of the dream.\nMiss wiU reply to any question if you wish.\nLilian Whiting.\nSome time later. Dr. Hodgson obtained an account of the\nincident from the percipient herself, who writes as follows :\nMarch 30th, 1892.\nDeak Sik,\u2014Your letter dated March 25th, has just\nreached me, and I hasten to say that this is the first\ncommunication that I have received from you. Miss\nWhiting's account of my dream must in some way have\nbeen lost in the mail. I have no doubt but that it was\nquite accurate. However, to avoid giving you more\ntrouble, I will just write it out briefly. I was visiting\nfriends fifty miles away from my mother's home. I had\nnot seen her for some weeks, and I did not know that\nshe had been having attacks of a heart trouble, which\ncaused her death. She had always been strong and well,\nwith the exception of rheumatism, and the thought of her\ndying had never entered my mind. I retired at eleven\no'clock, and feU asleep immediately, and as soon as I\nslept, my mother came to me in a dream ; she was\ndressed in black and looked very young. She put her\narms around me and said :\n\" Do not cry, you have done\neverything that you could for me.\" This she repeated\nseveral times ; then I awoke, disturbed and troubled, with\ntears on my face.\nIn the morning I told my friends that I was troubled\nabout my mother because of a vivid dream. In two\nhours the telegram came, saying that she was dead. I\nwent immediately, and before I was told anything about\nthe manner of her death, I told my dream. My sister-\n\f220 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nOn the night of Saturday, July 9, I went to bed about\n12.30, and suffered from what I took to be a nightmare.\nI was awakened by my wife's voice calling to me from\nher own bed upon the other side of the room. As I\nawoke, the nightmare itself, which had been long and\nvivid, faded from my brain. AU I could remember of it\nwas a sense of awful oppression and of desperate and\nterrified struggling for life such as the act of drowning\nwould probably involve. But between the time that I\nheard my wife's voice and the time that my consciousness\nanswered to it, or so it seemed to me, I had another\ndream. I dreamed that a black retriever dog, a most\namiable and inteUigent beast named Bob, which was the\nproperty of my eldest daughter, was lying on its side among\nbrushwood, or rough growth of some sort, by water.\nMy own personahty in some mysterious way seemed to me\nto be arising from the body of the dog, which I knew\nquite surely to be Bob and no other, so much so that my\nhead was against its head, which was lifted up at an\nimnatural angle. In my vision the dog was trying to\nspeak to me in words, and, failing, transmitted to my\nmind in an undefined fashion the knowledge that it was\ndying. Then everything vanished, and I woke to hear\nmy wife asking me why on earth I was making those\nhorrible and weird noises. I replied that I had had a\nnightmare about a fearful struggle, and that I had dreamed\nthat old Bob was in a dreadful way, and was trying to\ntalk to me and to teU me about it. Finally, seeing that\nit was still quite dark, I asked what the time was. She\nsaid she did not know, and shortly afterwards I went to\nsleep again and was disturbed no more.\nOn the Sunday morning Mrs. Rider Haggard told the\ntale at breakfast, and I repeated my story in a few\nwords. This I need not do here, as the annexed state-\nments set out what occurred quite clearly.\nThinldng that the whole thing was nothing more than a\ndisagreeable dream, I made no enquiries about the dog\nand never learned even that it was missing until that\nSunday night, when my Uttle girl, who was in the habit\nof feeding it, told me so. At breakfast time, I may\n\fLxxxvi.] Sp07itaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 221\nadd, nobody knew that it was gone, as it had been seen\nlate on the previous evening. Then I remembered my\ndream, and the following day enquiries were set on foot.\nTo be brief, on the morning of Thursday, the 14th,\nmy servant, Charles Bedingfield, and I discovered the body\nof the dog floating in the Waveney against a weir about\na mile and a quarter away. The two certificates of the\nveterinary surgeon, Mr. MuUane, are enclosed herewith.\nThey sufficiently describe its condition.\nOn Friday, the 15th, I was going into Bungay to offer\na reward for the discovery of the persons who were\nsupposed to have destroyed the dog in the fashion sug-\ngested in Mr. Mullane's first certificate, when at the level\ncrossing on the Bungay road I was hailed by two plate-\nlayers, who are named respectively George Arterton and\nHarry Alger. These men informed me that the dog had\nbeen killed by a train, and took me on a trolly down to\na certain open-work bridge which crosses the water between\nDitchingham and Bungay, where they showed me evidence\nof its death. This is the sum of their evidence :\nIt appears that about 7 o'clock upon the Monday\nmorning, very shortly after the first train had passed, in\nthe course of his duties Harry Alger was on the bridge,\nwhere he found a dog's coUar torn off and broken by the\nengine (smce produced and positively identified as that\nworn by Bob), coagulated blood, and bits of flesh, of\nI\nwhich remnants he cleaned the rails. On search also I\npersonaUy found portions of black hair from the coat of a\ndog. On the Monday afternoon and subsequently his\nmate saw the body of the dog floating in the water\nbeneath the bridge, whence it drifted down to the weir,\nit having risen with the natural expansion of gases, such\nas, in this hot weather, might be expected to occur within\nabout 40 hours of death. It would seem that the animal\nmust have been killed by an excursion train that left\nDitchingham at 10.25 on Saturday night, returning empty\nfrom Harleston a Uttle after 11. This was the last train\nwhich ran that night. No trains run on Sunday, and\nit is practically certain that it cannot have been killed\non the Monday morning, for then the blood would have\n\f22 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [paeI\nbeen still fluid. Also men who were working arounc\nwhen the 6.30 train passed must have seen the dog or\nthe line (they were questioned by Alger at the time anc\nhad seen nothing), and the engine-driver in broad daylighl\nwould also have witnessed and made a report of tht\naccident, of which in a dark night he would probablj\nImow nothmg. Further, if it was living, the dog would\nalmost certainly have come home during Simday, and its\nbody would not have risen so quickly from the bottom\nof the river, or presented the appearance it did on Thurs-\nday mommg. From traces left upon the piers of the\nbridge it appears that the animal was knocked or carried\nalong some yards by the tram and fell mto the brmk oi\nthe water where reeds grow. Here, if it were still hving,\n\u2014\nand, although the veterinary thinks that death was\npractically mstantaneous, its life may perhaps have hngered\nfor a few minutes,\u2014it must have suffocated and sunk,\nundergomg, I imagme, much the same sensations as I\ndid in my dream, and in very similar surroundings to\nthose that I saw therein\u2014namely, amongst a scrubby\ngrowth at the edge of water.\nBoth in a judicial and a private capacity I have been^\naccustomed all my life to the investigation of evidence,\nand, if we may put aside our familiar friend \" the long\narm of coincidence,\" which m this case would surely be\nstrained to dislocation, I confess that that available upon\nthis matter forces me to the following conclusions :\nThe dog Bob, between whom and myself there existed\na mutual attachment, either at the moment of his death,\nif his existence can conceivably have been prolonged till\nafter 1 in the morning, or, as seems more probable, about\nthree hours after that event, did succeed in calling my\nattention to its actual or recent plight by placing what-\never portion of my being is capable of receiving such\nimpulses when enchained by sleep, into its own terrible\nposition. That subsequently, as that chain of sleep was\nbeing broken by the voice of my wife calling me back\nto a normal condition of our human existence, with some\nlast despairing efl'ort, while that uidefinable part of me was\nbeing slowly withdrawn from it (it will be remembered\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 223\nthat in my dream I seemed to rise from the dog), it spoke\nto me, first trying to make use of my own tongue, and, failing\ntherein, by some subtle means of communication whereof I\nhave no knowledge telling me that it was dying, for I saw\nno blood or woiuids which would suggest this to my mind.\nI recognise, further, that, if its dissolution took place\nat the moment when I dreamt, this communication must\nhave been a form of that telepathy which is now very\ngenerally aclmowledged to occur between human beiiigs\nfrom time to time and under special circumstances, but\nwhich I have never heard of as occurring between a\nhuman being and one of the lower animals. If, on the\nother hand, that dissolution happened, as I beheve, over\n:\nthree hours previously\u2014what am I to say? Then it\nwould seem that it must have been some non-bodily but\nsurviving part of the life or of the spirit of the dog which,\nso soon as my deep sleep gave it an opportunity, repro-\nduced those things m my mind, as they had aheady\n'\noccurred, I presume, to advise me of the mamier of its\nend or to bid me farewell.\n..\n'\nThere is a third possibihty which I will quote, although\nthe evidence seems to me to be overwhelmingly against\nit, and, for the reasons aheady given, it is mherently\nmost improbable\u2014namely, that the dog was really killed\n,\n\/ '\nabout half-past 6 on the Monday morning, in which case\nmy dream was nothing but a shadow of its forthcoming fate.\nPersonally, however, I do not for a moment beheve\ni. : this to have been the case, especially as the vetermary's\ncertificate states that the animal's body must have been\n\"over three days\" in the water at the time of its discovery.^\n1 Sir Rider Haggard omits here (but sec the end of his letter of 2.3rd\nJuly below) a fourth possibihty, namely, that a telepathic impression\nmay have reached his mind at the actual time of the dog's death, but\nremained latent, only emerging into consciousness when a favourable\nmoment arrived. The possibility of such deferment in the emergence\nof an impression is difficult to prove except in some experimental cases,\nbut it is generally assumed and is one reason for allowing a margin of\ntwelve hours after the apparent moment of death in coimting the\napparition of a dying person as a phantasm of the living. References to\nthe subject will be fovuid in several places in Cxurney's book (see ui the\nindex imder \" Defennent or latency in telepathic impressions\"). It is also\ndiscussed in Myers' Human Personality, ch. vii., \u00a7 107, Vol. II., pp. 12-13, etc.\n\f224 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nOn the remarkable issues opened up by this occurrence\nI cannot venture to speak further than to say that,\n\u2014\nalthough it is dangerous to generahse from a particular\ninstance, however striking and well supported by evidence,\nwhich is so rarely obtamable in such obscure cases,\u2014it\ndoes seem to suggest that there is a more mtimate ghostly\nconnection between aU members of the animal world, in-\ncluding man, than has hitherto been beheved, at any rate\nby Western peoples ; that they may be, in short, aU of\nthem diiferent manifestations of some central, informing\nlife, though inhabiting the universe in such various shapes.\nThe matter, however, is one for the consideration of\nlearned people who have made a study of these mysterious\nquestions. I will only add that I ask you to pubhsh\nthe annexed documents with this letter, as they constitute\nthe written testimony at present available to the accuracy\nof what I state. Further, I may say that I shall welcome\nany uivestigation by competent persons.\nH.

It is\nthe retriever dog, Bob, which I have known ever since\nit has been at Ditchingham House.\n[Signed] C. Bedingfield\n(Groom at Ditchingham House).\nIn reply to further questions as to the possibility of the dog\nhaving been killed on the Monday morning instead of Saturday\nnight, Mr. Haggard wrote to us :\nDitchingham House, Norfolk,\nJuly 23rd, 1904.\nI beUeve that I am right in saying that if the dog\nhad been killed on the Monday morning, it certainly\nwould not have floated by the Monday midday or after-\nnoon when it was seen by Arterton.\nNo, I think the water is too deep for the body to have\nbeen seen lying at the bottom and been mistaken for a\nfloating dog. Further, Harry Alger, when he foimd the\ntraces of the accident, looked m the water on the Monday\nmorning and could find no dog. It must therefore have\nrisen to the surface between the Monday morning and\nMonday afternoon, as I beheve it would naturally do,\nhad it met its end on the Saturday night. Li short, I\nam absolutely convinced that when I had my dream the\ndog had been dead for at least three hours. Further,\nthis appears to be evident : the injuries to the dog's head\nwere such that death must have been instantaneous ;\nand even though life lingered in the tissues, as a doctor\nto whom I was talking this morning told me it might\ndo for a httle while, from the moment that engine struck\nthe dog's head, it must have been utterly incapable of\nthought or voUtion as we understand it\u2014that is, its brain\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 229\nwas destroyed ; it was physically dead. It seems to\nresult therefore that in order to produce the long subse-\nquent impressions upon myself, it must have been spiritually\nalive. In short, even supposmg that I received those\nimpressions at the moment of the death of the dog and\nstored them up for future use, or that those impressions\nwere flying about in the air hke a wheeling hawk waitmg\nfor an opportunity to settle on my head, they must still\nhave been emitted by the personality of an animal that\nwas already dead, doubly dead from fatal injury followed\ninstantly by drowning.\nI seem therefore to come to this conclusion. Either\nthe whole thing is a mere coincidence and just means\nnothmg more than indigestion and a nightmare, or it\nwas the spirit of the dog on its passage to its own place\nor into another form, that moved my spirit, thereby\ncausing this revelation, for it seems to be nothing less. . . .\nH. Rider Haggakd.\nFrom an interview in The Daily Chronicle of July 22nd,\n1904, to which ftlr. Haggard referred us, saying that it was\n\" fairly accurate,\" we extract the following :\nBob, although he belonged to my daughter, who bought\nhim three years ago, was a great friend of mine, but I\ncannot say that my soul was boimd up in him.\nHe was a very intelhgent animal, and generally accom-\npanied me in my walks about the farm, and almost\ninvariably came to say good morning to me. He was\nrather rheumatic, as he was getting into years\u2014seven\nperhaps\u2014but that did not prevent him going after rabbits,\ngenerally in company with Bustle, my spaniel.\nAnother letter from Mr. Haggard appeared in The Times of\nAugust 9th, 1904, discussing the issues involved, and giving\nfurther details of the probable mode and circumstances of the\ndog's death, as follows :\n... I am satisfied that the dog was destroyed about\n10.27 on the night of July 9th. It had, I think, been\nrabbit-hunting or following some other canine attraction,\n\f230 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nand being hot and tired, lay down upon a sleeper of the\nopen bridge above the cool water, and resting its head\nupon its paws, placed them on the rail, thus lifting them\na few inches above the gromid. This was its mvariable\ncustom when a turf edgmg or anythmg of the sort was\navailable. Thus it went to sleep. But whether asleep\nor awake, the blow which it received from the wheel\nguard of the engine must, I presume, if it did not cause\ninstant death, at any rate have utterly destroyed its\nmind-powers, miless dogs can think with some portion of\nthen- organism other than the brain, of which in this\ninstance the case was utterly smashed. ...\n[As to the suggestion that the telepathic information\nmay have come from a human being who witnessed the\ndeath of the dog :]\nMy answer is that no human being would have been\nwanderuig about on a dark night in a place so dangerous\nas an open timber-Avork railway bridge over a river. I\nam convinced that the only creature which can have seen\nthe dog's death was another smaller dog which may or\nmay not have been with it at the time. . . .\nAs to the question whether he had had any other experi-\nences of the kuid, and in regard to some of the pecuUar\npsychological features of this case, Mr. Haggard writes to us\nlater :\n... I never remember any other telepathic dream.\nFrom time to time I have had uneasy dreads which have\nproved baseless, but the only tangible mysterious event\nwhich I can recall was a fore -knowledge of future sorrow,\nwhich some months later proved itself to be fearfully\naccurate.\n. . . Was the nightmare or first dream the whole story\nof what happened ? I am inclined to thmk so from what\nI remember of it and the animal noises that I made\n(see my wife's evidence). To what can be attributed the\nhallucination that I seemed to rise from the body of\nthe dog ? This was one of the most curious parts of the\nmanifestation\u2014hke the separation of soul and body, as\none might imagme it. Another curious pomt was the\n\fLxxxvi.] Sfontaneous Cases : Impression Externalissd. 231\nfashion in which, abandoning its attempt to talk (I thought\nbecause it was too slow) as I departed from it, the dog\nseemed to flash the inteUigence of its dying state upon\nmy mmd. In an instant I laiew all about it,\u2014through\nthe inteUigence, not through the senses.\nThis case is one of very unusual interest from several\npoints of view. It is, therefore, specially satisfactory to have\nit so well authenticated, and Mr. Rider Haggard deserves the\ngratitude of psychical researchers for havmg collected all the\navailable evidence so promptly and completely, and put it at\nthe disposal of the scientific world.\nFor other cases of possible animal agents, see above,\nL. 1142, L. 1144, L. 1158, pp. 116, 139 and 141.

There is also a\ncase in Proceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 285, of a dog being\nseen running across the room at Mentone about the time\nof its death in Norfolk, but the agency of those in charge\nof the dog is here possible.\nTwo dreams may be briefly mentioned in which the\ndying agent was seen with symbolical adjuncts. In one\n(L. 1166, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 140) which came to us\nthrough the American Branch, Mrs. Pool dreamt she\nsaw her brother carried into her house in an open coffin,\non the night he died suddenly, at a distance. In the\nother (L. 1175, Journal, Vol. XIV., p. 75) Mrs. Comyn,\non the night her mother died unexpectedly, dreamt she\nsaw her looking very young and gay.

[part\nafter his death. She saw and recognised the face, and\nsaw it as it were in dupHcate\u2014either two images of it\nat the same time or one immediately after the other\n(cf. L. 979, above, p. 208). The widow is known to have\ntalked of the percipient that night and about the time\nof the experience. The case is recorded by a good\nobserver who has had no other experience of the kind,\nand it is well evidenced except that unfortunately Miss R.\ndid not speak of it or make a written note of it till\nafter the news of the death came. She had in fact not\nthought of it in the two days' interval. It is this, and\nthe fact that ]Miss R. prefers to remain anonymous, that\nprevents my lengthening this paper by quoting the case\nin full ;\nthough my knowledge of the accuracy and care-\nfulness of the percipient makes me think it rather an\nimportant one.\nA dream case of the same kind (L. 1211, Journal,\nVol. XVIIL, p. 35) reached us through Sir Oliver Lodge,\nto whom it was reported in the first instance. The\ndreamer is Mrs. Walter Browett, of Westfield, Coventry,\nand the first account of her experience which we received\nwas as follows :\n(L. 1211.)\nStatement by Walter Browett of Westfield, Coventry, Solicitor.\nJanuary 30, 1917.\nThis morning at 8 a.m. my wife told me that she had\nhad a vivid dream about an aunt, always referred to as\n\"Auntie Maude.\" She said she met her dressed in\nblack with widow's weeds, and she told my wife that her\nhusband was dead.\nMy wife had not seen her for some years, but they\nexchanged letters occasionally, the last letter being about\na week ago on an entirely trivial matter. My wife had\nnever seen Amitie Maude's husband to whom she was only\nmarried last October.\nWhen we came down to breakfast we found a letter from\nAuntie Maude, the contents of which are of no importance.\nIt was written and posted yesterday at a place near\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 233\nShrewsbury. I naturally remarked to my wife that that\nwas the end of her dream.\nAt 1.30 p.m. we received a telegram as follows: \"My\nhusband passed away last night.

Walter Browett.\nIn reply to our request for a first-hand report of her dream\nfrom Mrs. Browett, we received the followmg statement :\nWestfield, Coventry, February 19, 1917.\nAt the end of October, 1916, my late mother's only\nsister, Mrs. Short, to whom I always refer as \" Auntie\nMaude,\" was married to a Mr. G. M. Meire, Eyton-on-Sevem,\nShrewsbury. I have not seen her for several years, and\nI never saw hun. On the night of Monday-Tuesday,\nJanuary 29th-30th, 1917, I dreamt that I saw Auntie\nMaude in widow's weeds, and felt that her husband was\ndead. I told my husband about it directly I awoke\nand described her dress. At brealdast we fomid a letter\nfrom her, from which apparently all was well. About\n1.30 we received a telegram from her as follows :\n\" My\nhusband passed away last night. Auntie Maude.\"\nF. M. Browett.\nWe also wrote to Mr. Browett pointing out the importance\nfrom an evidential standpoint of makmg it clear that Mr.\nMeire 's death was sudden and that neither he nor JVIi-s. Browett\nhad any reason to anticipate it. Jn this connection Ave asked\nMr. Meu-e's age and we also asked whether the telegram an-\nnouncing his death had been preserved. INIi\".

I went to his\nfuneral and then learnt that his age was 67. He had been\nvery active during the afternoon of the 29th and had said\nhow well he felt. . . .\nThe telegram was not kept, but it was only a \" con-\nfirmation \" one, the original message having been teleiDhoned\nujD here from the Coventry G.P.O.

She said : \"To you, of course.\nI said to myself I wish Walter were here to help me.\"\nShe said that she did not remember thinking of my wife\nfurther than she would of necessitj' do when thinking of\nme. My wife is her god-daughter and the only one of\nthe family with whom she is really intimate.\nWAI.TEK BrOWETT.\nOf the two letters from Mrs. Meire to which Mr. Browett\nrefers above, the earher, dated January 29, 1917, and received\nby Mrs. Browett on January 30 after she had told Mr. Browett\nof her dream, makes only one reference to Mr. Meire, and\nsays nothmg of his health. The second letter, dated February\n14, 1917, which is too personal to print here, makes it evident\nthat Mr. Meire's death was quite unexpected. He died of\nheart-failure about 11.30 p.m. on January 29, 1917, having\nbeen to aU appearances in good, normal health a few minutes\nbefore.\nThe fact that the telegram amiouncing his death to Mr.\nand Mrs. Browett has not been preserved is of little moment.\nThe hour and day of the death are sufficiently estabhshed by\nMrs. Meire's letter of February 14, 1917, confirmed by the\nannouncement ui the Tim.es of Feb. 2, 1917, as follows :\nMeire.\u2014-On the 29th Jan., at Eyton-on-Sevem, near\nShrewsbury, George Haughton Meire, aged 67.\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 235\nA dream (L. 1115, Journal, Vol. IX., p. 127) coinciding\nwith a death, but in which the wrong person was dreamt\nof, may perhaps be mentioned here. It was sent to Mr.\nMyers by Mr. G. R. Sims, who ckeamt that his sister\ncame to him and told him his father had died. He told\nthe dream to his housekeeper in the morning. About\ntwenty minutes later his sister did come round to tell him\nof the death during the night of a brother-in-law. If\nwe knew more of the circumstances, we might be able to\nexplain the distortion of the telepathic communication if\nthere was one.\nDeath Coincidences\u2014(e) symholic.\nThree symboUc experiences, to which not much im-\nportance can be attached, conclude the visual death\ncoincidences. In L. 966 (Journal, Vol. VI., p. 181) Miss\nWilliams saw a lovely round light over her head as she\npassed through a dark room \" just about the time \" of\nthe death of a woman whom she knew to be dying, and\nwith whom she at the time connected the light. In\nL. 1093 {Journal, Vol. VIII., p. 130) Mrs. Knight had\nimpressions of being raised up in bed, of a shimmering\nlight, and of raps on the bed-head, all of which, as well\nas a subsequent dream of death symbols, she took at the\ntime to indicate that some friend was dying. She did\nnot, however, think of the death of the friend who\nactually died that night. In L. 1094 {Journal, Vol. VIII.,\np. 134), a dream case which came through the American\nBranch, Mr. Morse dreamed on the night of his wife's\nunexpected death at a distance that he was dressed in\nmourning and taking a long journey. He mentioned his\ninterpretation of the dream before he heard of the death.\nDeath Coincidences\u2014(\/) auditory.\nNext must be considered a few auditory death coin-\ncidences. There has been an auditory element combined\nwith the visual in two of the waldng experiences and\nsome of the dreams already discussed, but in those that\nfollow the auditory element is either the only element or\n\f236 Mrs. Henry Sidgtvick.\nthe only veridical one. There is one waking experience\n\u2014\nit was at the moment of waking\u2014in Avhich words were\nheard (L. 929, Jotirnal, Vol. V., p. 204). The percipient\nwas a girl of thirteen, but the case was not recorded till\nfour years and three months after it happened. I quote\npart only of the record. The case was looked into by\nMr. Myers, who writes :\n(L. 929.)\nI heard the following case from Miss Elsie Spears, the\npercipient, and also, separately, from her elder sister. Miss\nSpears, at thek home, 48, Godwin-street, Birmingham, Decem-\nber 18th and 17th, 1891. I took down the statement of each,\nwhich they revised and signed. I also saw a card announcing\nthat the girl here called Clara \" Died September 15th, 1887,\naged 13.\" The two brothers sent me their written corrobora-\ntions on December 22nd. F. W. H. M.\nThe Percipient's Account.\nMy greatest friend was a girl whom I will call Clara,\nof the same age as myself. We had always been together\nand were as intimate as girls can be. Clara had a httle\nsister of four years old, whom I will caU Maggie. This\nhttle Maggie was very iU, and Clara and I were very\nanxious about her. I went away from Birmingham to\nSutton for my health. I was to stay some time longer.\nOn Wednesday, September 14th, 1887, I was very anxious\nto write to Clara, but I had rheumatism in my hands\nand could not do so. I had been thmldng much about\nMaggie on the night of September 14\/15th. In the\nmorning I suddenly found myself wide awake, the room\nbeing aheady hght. A voice was saying, close to me,\n\" Don't fret, Elsie ;\nMaggie is living, but it is Clara\nthat's dead.\" I looked round, but there was no one\nthere. Almost at that moment the clock struck six.\nThe voice was sad. Next day I felt certain that Clara\nwas gone, and, although my hands were better, I could\nnot bring myself to write to her. ... On the Saturday\nI went out to do an errand for the lady with whom I\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 237\nwas staying. But suddenly I felt that I could not turn\nthat way but must go towards the station. As I did\nso, I met my brother, who had been sent to bring me\nhome. . . .\nThe next case (L. 1180, Journal, Vol. XIV., p. 327), a\ndream, is interesting from several points of view. There\nwas undoubtedly a dream of a death somehow connected\nwith Sir R. H. a few hours after his brother. General\nH.-S., died. But if it was telejDathic, the communication\nwas incompletely developed both in its manifestation (the\nname being incomplete) and in the percipient's appre-\nhension of it. Again it is difficult to see why the com-\nmunication came to Miss F. at all. May we suppose that\nit was intended for Sir R. H. but failing to reach his\nnormal consciousness was as it were reflected on to Miss\nF. who knew him well ? Or was it an instance of a\npiece of information interesting to the percipient being\naccidentally picked up by her during sleep from those\nwho knew it ? The case seems comparable to P. 269\nand L. 1127 (pp. 147 and 144 above), where a sister learns\na brother's place in examination, etc., having no connection\nwith any possible agents unless it was through him.\n(L. 1180.)\nThe case was communicated to us by General Sir R. H.,\nwho, while informing us of the full names of all the persons\nconcerned, requested us to print their initials only. He gives\na prehminary statement of the circumstances, as follows :\nLi order to understand the dream, 1 should mention\nthat my elder brother some years ago took on an additional\nsurname, so that from General H. he changed to General\nH.-S. I am correctly referred to as General H., or\nSu- R.\nMy brother decided to have a shght operation, and\nthe doctors and surgeons considered there was no risk.\nThe operation took place in a Nursing Home in London\non April the 25th [1910], and was considered a success.\nOn the 26th he was found to be suffering severely from\n\f2^8 Mrs. Henry Sictgivick. [pARl\"\nshock, but this nearly all passed away on the 27th. On\nthe 28th he was not so well, and by night time the case\nwas very serious. On the morning of the 29th the\ndoctors decided that the only hope lay in sleep. Morphia\nwas given every 4 hours. Before the first injection,\nabout 7 a.m., he was quite collected and calm, and\nagreed to sleep. His son, E., had been with him aU\nthe time, and his daughter, B., arrived in the early\nmorning, and she exchanged a few words with her father.\nFor the rest of the day he was drowsy mider morphia.\nAbout 6.30 p.m. he began to collapse, and breathed his\nlast at 7 p.m., in the presence of his son and daughter\nand the doctors.\nBefore the operation he was in excellent health, and\nvery strong for his age, 66.\nMiss F. [the dreamer] met my brother once, a year or\ntwo ago. She had met his daughter some years ago,\nand she met his son on the 13th April last for the first\nand only time, and she Imew shghtly one of my sons,\nwho received a telegram from his cousin at about 8 p.m.\non the 29th, announcing the death. I have ascertained\nthat not one of these three persons had given a thought\nto Miss F., and it Avould have been strange if they had.\nAt my request the lady referred to by Miss F. has\nsigned as correct the statement made to her on April\n30th.\nMiss F. is devoted to my wife and myself ; she saw us and\nour daughter off from Victoria Station for the Continent\non April 16th ; and just in fun I gave her our accident\ninsurance tickets for the journey, requesting her to hand\nthem over to my son in case of a tragedy. Before she\nhad heard of my brother's death, she Avrote to my wife\nand said she was anxious to hear nev^s of us, as we had\npromised to send a postcard on arrival, and she made\nsome joking reference to the insurance tickets, but no\nmention of the dream she had had. We do not remember\nhaving promised to send the postcard. Miss F. is middle-\naged, absolutely reliable, clever, very exact and methodical.\nIt will be observed that Miss F. dreamed of my brother's\ndeath a few hours afterwards, on the night of April 29-30,\n\fLXxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 239\nbut she did not know of his death till the night of\nMay 7th.\nAt about 6 p.m. on April 30th I received at Aix-les-\nBains a telegram from my son to say my brother had\ndied on the 29th.

I will\ndescribe the cases briefly. The first (L. 1141, Jour^ial,\nVol. XL, p. 320) was sent by Mr. J. F. Young, some of\nwhose own experiences have been given above (see pp.\n116 and 129). He knew the percipient Mrs. Page well.\nFurther evidence, completing the case, was collected by\nthe Rev. A. T. Fryer. The experience, which was\nrecorded on October 22, 1904, occurred on December 21,\n1903. At three o'clock in the morning Mrs. Page in one\nroom and her three daughters in another heard footsteps\ncomnig up the stairs and three knocks on Mrs. Page's\ndoor. She and one of her daughters got up and went\nnito the passage, but found no one. The next morning\na message was brought to them that a Mr. Morgan, to\nwhom Mrs. Page had been very kind during his long\nillness, had died at that hour. The percipients had not\nm the night associated the sounds with him\nThe second case (L. 1151, Journal, Vol. XII p 196)\nwas sent to us by I\\Ir. E. R.

Coincidences ivith Illness or Accident.\nIn this section I have put together cases of waking\nhaUucinations and dramatic dreams corresponding with\nillness or accident occurring to the presumed agent, or to\nsome one closely connected with him. In such cases the\ncorrespondence is apt to be less definite than in death\ncoincidences, and therefore the evidence for telepathy less\nclear. There are, however, some remarkable cases where\nthe correspondence is clearly, I think, beyond chance.\nI will take first a case (L. 1207, Journal, Vol. XVII.,\np. 230) which seems to me one of the most remarkable\nin our coUection. The coincidence is with an attack of\nfatal illness and the coincident phantasm was a waking\nvision\u2014a scene represented as it were pictorially, but\nexternalised in the actual space in which the percipient\nfound herself.\nWe received it through Sir George Beilby, to whom we\nare much indebted for the care with which all available\nevidence has been collected.\n(L. 1207.)\nThe percipient's experience took place on April 4, 1913,\nand her account of it, which we print below, was given in a\nletter to Sir George Beilby, written three years and a half\nlater, as follows :\nOctober 4, 1916.\nI Avill write out the incident which, if you remember,\nI told you by word of mouth in Glasgow last June\u2014\nthe incident of my \"sight\" or vision of my brother in\nAustraUa shortly after he must have fallen into the\nunconsciousness which lasted tih his death some days\nlater.\n\f244 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nIt was if I remember rightly on the Friday evening\n[April 4, 1913], and\u2014which will fix the date\u2014-I had\nbeen attending a Committee Meeting called on that evening\nto help the election of the Rev. Joseph Johnson, minister\nof the Park Avenue Congregational Church, Ashton-on-\nMersey, to the Knutsford Board of Guardians. The\nelection was to take place on the following day. We\nhad an animated meeting, and with my thoughts full\nof this I left before its close, and (alone) turned out into\nthe brightly hghted and bustling thoroughfare of School\nRoad, Sale.\nI had wallced but a few paces when I was staggered\nby seeing, as in a cinema show, reflected in the air in\nfront of me a clear-cut picture of my brother in Austraha,\nlying with the unmistakeably helpless look of a dead or\nunconscious man who had just fallen. I saw his pose,\nhis clothes, and even his thick curlmg hair as if in Ufe\nbefore me.\nMechanically I must have continued walking as no one\nappeared to notice me ; but I felt my brother was dying\nor dead, or that something tragic was happening to him,\nand I began at once praying for him in an agony of\nsupplication. The picture faded, and I hurried on out\nof the light of the shops and mto the darkness of Wash-\nway Road.\nSuddenly, when halfway along the road, the picture\nshone out agaua before my eyes, this time against the dark\nsky. Again I saw the prone helpless figure, the colouring\nof clothes and hair, then as before it faded quickly away,\nand I did not see it again. I think it was between 8\nand 9.30 p.m., or about then, that I left the meeting. I\nremember that my sister had not been very well, and that\nshe was in bed. When I reached home I ran up to her\nroom and broke down m telling her what I had just\nseen, saymg I was \"sure somethuig had happened to\nEdgar.\" I remember she tried to soothe me by saying I\nwas simply overtired\u2014that I should get away to bed and\n\"would see things would be all right m the morning.\"\nI tried to believe this would be so, but all the Saturday\nand Sunday followmg I kept thinking of my brother and\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 245\npraying constantly for him.

Edgar Paterson.\nThe next news we had was when our sister-m-law\"s\nletter (enclosed) arrived telhng us how Edgar, when\ntravelling home from New Zealand to Melbourne, had\nsuddenly fallen down unconscious on the ship when\nnearing Melbourne, had been carried ashore at Melbourne\nunconscious, and placed in Hospital there (on the\nSaturday, April 5th, 1913), where he had lingered without\nregaining consciousness till the Monday, April 7th, when\nhe slipped quietly away.

Edgar Paterson was taken HI quite suddenly on board ship,\nwhen on his way to Melboiime, between 10 and 11 a.m. on\nFriday, April 4, 1913 (Victoria time), that he became uncon-\nscious at once and died in hospital in Melbourne on April 7,\n1913. By Greenwich mean time, therefore, he was taken ill\nbetween midnight and 1 a.m. (approximately) on April 4,\n1913,^ and he had been imconscious about twenty hours when\n1 \" Standard time \" in Victoria is ten hours in advance of Green'svich\nmean time.\nQ\n\f248 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [par'.\nMiss Paterson saw the apparition of him between 7 p.m\nand 9.30 p.m. on that day.\nThere are several points of interest about the form o:|\nthis experience. First, the pictorial form of sensorj\nhallucination which I have called a vision\u2014externalised\nbut not realistic, not forming an apparently natural pari\nof the surroundings\u2014is unusual among spontaneous cases,\nAn experience resembling it has been given among semi-\nexperimental cases (G. 267, p. 54 above), and a spon-\ntaneous one, which the percipient decided was a dream,\nhas been quoted among death coincidences (L. 978, p. 213\nabove). Another waking vision will be found below\n(L. 1193, p. 278). Crystal visions are generally of this\nkind, and a spontaneous vision in a glass of water is\ngiven above (L. 1134, p. 45). Probably L. 1198 (see\np. 339 below) was a vision. Other cases have been\npublished\u2014see e.g. Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 217. For a\nwaking vision which was apparently entirely mental, not\nexternalised in space, see L. 1160 (p. 149 above). Com-\npare also M.Cl. 22 (p. 57 above) and L. 1152 (p. 58\nabove).\nSecondly, the repetition of the phantasm after an\ninterval is unusual. It occurs in one or two dreams in\nthis collection, but not, I think, in any other waking\nexperience except the semi-experimental vision, G. 267,\njust referred to.\nThirdly, it was not a mere apparition of the dying man,\nbut had other veridical elements. The brother was seen\nlying unconscious with his clothes on, which must have\ncorresponded to what happened at the onset of thei\nattack of fatal illness some twenty hours before the vision.'\nWhether the vision represented contemporaneous fact\n\u2014\nthe costume, for instance, at the moment of its occur-\nrence\u2014we do not know ;\nnor, of course, do we know when\nthe telepathic communication took place, and whether '\nor not it remained latent in the percipient's subconscious\nmind to emerge at a suitable moment. i\n! ' it\nIn the next case (L. 1209, Journal, Vol. XVIII., p. 19)\n'\nwe have similarly a veridical element in the appearance\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 249\nof the bandages as actually worn by the agent. There is\nalso the same impossibility of fixing the exact time\ncoincidence. The apparition was seen before any of the\nfamily knew the agent had been wounded, but not till\nsome thirty hours after the wound occurred, though much\nless time after he was admitted to the hospital at Bou-\nlogne. The misrecognition of the phantasm at first, and\nits failure even when recognised to appear in the semblance\nof the agent familiar to the percipient is very curious.\nIt suggests some faulty transmission between the sub-\nliminal and supraliminal consciousness. An undeveloped\nfigure in the darkness first suggested the little boy in the\nflesh, and the idea of a child having entered the per-\ncipient's mind perhaps could not be shaken off again.\nThe bandage may have then produced the association of\nideas with the youthful portrait of the agent.\n(L. 1209.)\nOur earliest information about the case was contained in a\nletter from Lieut. Bridge, as foUows\n:\nEnfield, Gateshead,\nNovember 2, 1916.\nThe following presents an unusual feature to me\u2014but\npossibly you can explain it.\nMy age is 34.\nI was wounded in France July 24th, 1916, 3.30 p.m.\nBetween 1 and 2 a.m. July 26th, 1916, I appeared to\nMrs. S.

E. W. Bkidge, Lt. Durh. L.I.\nThe above is substantially correct. I might add that I\nhad not looked at the photograph mentioned for at least\n4 E. M.

We\nwere asked not to print the writer's name and address :\nDear Sm, Oct. 6th, 1901.\nOn reading your letter to the Spectator of Oct. 5th,\nI thought you might possibly be interested in a coincid-\nence which took place at the end of August last. I am\nattached to a certain young lady. At the time I refer\nto I was staying near Peterboro' and the lady in question\nwas at her home, a seaside town in Yorkshire. One\nvery close and thimdery night I found some difficulty\nin getting to sleep. When finally I fell asleep, or rather\ndozed, the face of IVIiss D. rose up before me, and to my\nsurprise one side of her face was very much swollen and\nI\nshe looked very unhappy. I sat up in bed and spoke\n' to her, only to find that I had been dreaming. Again\nI feU asleep and dreamt that I was walking along a street,\nwhen I heard a cry above me, and looking up saw IVIiss\nD.'s face at a window from which smoke and flames\nwere issuing. I rushed upstairs, only to see her face\nfloating in the smoke, very much swollen. I tried to\ngrasp her, and woke up with a cry. Somehow the dream\ndepressed me, and next day in writing to JMiss D. I told\nher the whole thing, much as I have told you. Imagine\nmy surprise a day after, when I heard from her that on\nthe night in question she had gone out to see a house on\nfire\u2014Mrs. K.'s seaside residence ; had contracted a chill,\nand gone to bed with her face enormously swollen up,\nand had suffered severe toothache aU night.

Mrs.\nVerrall reported as follows :\n5, Selwyn Gakdens, Cambridge, Oct. 16th, 1901.\nI have just seen Mr. H. B., and have no doubt at aU\nthat the case is genuine. At the same time the evidence\nis not quite so complete as I had hoped from his letter,\nbut these are the facts as given me by him : On a certain\nSunday in August (subsequently ascertained to be the 25th)\nH. B. dreamt, as he told Mr. Piddimgton, that he saw\nMiss D. with a swollen face, and later on the same night,\nthat he saw her at a window from which smoke and fire\nwere coming. On Monday he wrote to Miss D. to ask\nif she had had a toothache, but on second thoughts\ndecided that it would make him feel fooUsh if nothing\nhad occurred, and so tore up the letter. On a later day\nin the week he was writing to her about other things,\nand then mentioned his vivid dream about the swollen\nface (this part of the business evidently impressed him\nmuch more than the fire). But before he sent this letter\nhe received one from her mentioning that she had been\nsuffermg from a severe toothache and swollen face since\nSunday night. This letter I have seen ; it is dated from\nFiley, on \" Wednesday \" (obviously August 28th), and\nbegms by saying that she is sorry not to have written\nbefore, but has been \" seedy ever since Sunday. I think\nI must have got a chill ;\nanyhow, I had raging toothache\nfrom Sunday night till \" the day before, when she had\nthe tooth out with gas. The letter went on to give a\ngraphic description, with a sketch, of her appearance\nduring the time that her face was swollen.\nOn the receipt of this letter, H. B. was so much aston-\nished to find that his dream about the swollen face was\ntrue that he added a postscript to his letter (which had\nnot yet gone) to say that he had seen her with a swollen\nface at a window from which smoke was coming, and to\nask if that part of the dream was also true.\nHer letter in answer to that I have also seen.

It was\nMrs. K.'s house ; one of the bedrooms got on fire. It\nwas nothing much, and was put out before the Fire\nBrigade arrived. . . . Auntie M. first noticed smoke\ncoming out of the wmdow.\" The writer goes on to say\n(and this seems to me very interesting) \" M. gave me a\nsleeping powder on Simday night, so I slept heavily, m\nspite of the pain.\" She also says that she thought about\nhim a good deal on Monday night when she had seen\nwhat a sight she was, but not on Sunday.\nOf course it is unfortunate, evidentially, that nothing\nwas posted from him to her till after her letter mentioning\nthe swoUen face. At the same time I think the two\nletters of hers which I have seen estabhsh the truth of\nhis statement that he mentioned the fire to her before\nhearing of it from her. His whole account of the matter\nimpressed me as frank and accurate ; he showed me the whole\nof the letters, which were in their envelopes, so that the\npostmarks confirmed the contents of the letters as to dates.\nHe does not think that the lady will have kept his\nletters, nor that it would be of any use to write to her\n,\nfor corroboration.\nHe tells me that he has never had any similar experience\nbefore ; he dreams constantly, but he dwelt emphatically\non the very vivid nature of the earlier part of this dream.\nThe impression was so strong that he sat up and spoke\nto the lady before he realised that he was dreammg. He\nhas several times guessed the thoughts, after an interval\nof silence, both of this lady and of one of his three\nsisters ; he has had no success with his other sisters,\n,\n, nor has he ever had any impression unless he and the\nsister (or Miss D.) were in the same room. Since this\nepisode he dreamt that Miss D. was angry with him,\nand encouraged by the August exj^erience, he wrote to\nher to ask if it were true. She rephed that it was not,\nbut that on the same night she had dreamt that he was\nangry with her. M. de G. Vebball.\n\f260 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. '\n[part\nA simple dream of illness (L. 964, Journal, Vol. V.,\np. 168) came through the American Branch. Mr.\nM'Culloch, writing in January, 1892, reports that while\naway from home in the autumn of 1889 he dreamt that\nhis wife was beside him and that he heard her say\n\"I am so sick.\" He told the dream to two friends who\ncorroborate, and on returning home a few days later\nfound that his wife had been taken ill that night and\nsent for the doctor.\nIn the following case (L. 1195, Journal, Vol. XVI.,\np. 41) it is perhaps more natural to suppose that the\nperson intending to telegraph was the agent rather than\nthe sick person, but the coincidence is undoubted :\n(L. 1195.)\nThe dream was reported to Sir Oliver Lodge by the per-\ncipient, Mr. W. E.

Perky.\nTlie following symbolic dream (L. 937, Journal, Vol. V.,\np. 251) is narrated by Professor Charles Richet's cousin,\nMme. Vavin, originally in French, here translated. The\naccount is midated, but as it was printed in the Journal\nfor May 1892, the interval between the experience in\nDecember 1891 and the report of it cannot have been\nvery long. It is an interesting case of gradual emergence\nof the veridical idea. The dream coincided with the\nbeginning of the fatal illness of Professor Richet's father,\nthe facts concerning which are as follows :\n(L. 937.)\nOn Saturday, December 26th, 1891, [in the south of France],\nM. A. Richet, aged 76, [the father of Professor Ch. Richet],\nwas seized with a violent bronchitis, which during the night of\nDecember 26th-27th led to violent agitation and some dehrium.\nNext morning telegrams were sent to M. Charles Richet and\nhis other children in Paris, saying that their father's illness,\nalthough not precisely dangerous, was, at his age, a serious\none. . . . During the Sunday the patient's state grew worse ;\nand he expired at 1 p.m., December 30th.\nMadame Vavin writes :\nI was very anxious and troubled as to the health of\nan Aunt who is very dear to me ; and on the evening\nof December 26th-27th, 1891, I had received a letter\ngiving me very alarming news of this Aunt. I anticipated\nher immediate death, and went to sleep in this state of\nmind. I then dreamt as follows. I was present at a\nfuneral, which seemed to belong to my family. I saw\nmy brother in uniform and all my relations in mourning.\nI at first thought that this must be my Aunt's funeral\n;\n\u2014yet my grief did not seem to me to be as great as I\nshould have felt in such a case ; and I saw in the group\nbefore me my cousin, the grandchild and nearest relative\nof this Aunt, in very slight mourning. Suddenly a voice\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 263\nseemed to whisper these words in my ear, \" This is not\nyour Atmt's funeral,\u2014but the funeral of M. Richet, who\nis about to die.\" At this moment I awoke.\nNext day my brother told me that M. Richet was ill,\n\u2014a fact of which I was quite unaware. I then told my\ndream to him and to several other persons.\nMahguekite Vavin.\nMadame Vavin's brother, above referred to, corroborates,\n(G. 234.)\nAnother symbolic dream of a funeral (G. 234, Journal,\nVol. VI., p. 83) recorded before the dreamer knew of the\ndeath may be mentioned here, though it did not coincide\ndefinitely with illness or with death. It occurred to\nMr. J. V. Owen in America between the death and funeral\nof his mother in England. She was very old, but he\nknew of no special reason for anxiety. He wrote to his\nsister before he knew of the death, in answer to her\nletter announcing their mother's serious illness, as follows :\nI dreamed I was in a house where there was a funeral\ngoing on. Everybody was dressed in black, and I saw\nyou all there except mother, and father [dead 16 years]\ntold me that she was dead, and that it was her funeral\nthat was then in process of being carried out ; and I\nhave not been able to shake off the sad feeling it caused\nme since. If dear mother is still ahve, tell her, etc. . . .\nAnother dream connected with a funeral (L. 994, Journal,\nVol. VII., p. 176) may be naturally classed with the one\njust described. Again there is a want of very exact\ncoincidence, but it was related before any coincidence was\nsuspected, and it was recorded sixteen days after its\noccurrence. Mrs. Peebles dreamt that the baby of a\nfriend of her daughter and acquaintance of her own was\ndead and preparations were being made for the burial.\nShe dreamt this on the night of the day on which the\nfuneral, which her daughter attended, had taken place,\nand told her husband of it in the morning, as he testifies,\nbefore they had heard of illness or death.\n\f264 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part! i\nThere are two experiences coinciding with the oncoming\nof fatal illness which the percipient did not at the time (\nconnect with the sick person. In the first (L. 967, Journal, ,\nVol. VI., p. 183)\u2014a waking auditory hallucination\u2014no ]\nidea at all of illness or death seems to have been sug- f\ngested. It is perhaps most reasonable to suppose in this\ncase that the coincidence between the illness and the ]\nunrecognised call was accidental, especially as, if there was\ntelepathy, the link between agent and percipient was\napparently local only (cf. L. 1087 above, p. 183). To\ndescribe the case briefly, a nursery maid named Margaret -\nheard herself called one night as she was preparing for i\nbed. Supposing it was her mistress, Mrs. \" Thompson,\" [\nshe went out into the passage but found no one, and j\nwhile listening thought she heard a deep sigh. She spoke s\nof the experience to the governess next day. Later it [\nwas learnt that Mrs. Thompson's brother-in-law, Mr. ^\nEdward Thompson, had been taken ill that evening and t\ndied two days later. His much-loved sister, also named j\nMargaret, had till lately occupied the room in which the !\n(\nnursery maid and children now slept and in which she\nheard the call, and Edward Thompson's mind is said to !\nhave been dwelling on his sister during his illness. It will\nbe observed, however, that the call \"Margaret\" heard by\nthe percipient suggested to her a female, not a male, voice.\nIn the other unrecognised case (L. 987, Journal, Vol.\nVII., p. 106) which came through the American Branch\nof the Society, Mrs. Krekel, in a dream or in a state\nbetween sleeping and waking, heard a loud rap on her\nbed-head and afterwards saw an arm thrust over her\nshoulder handing her a large envelope with mourning\nborder and the word death upon it. She told the dream\nto a friend, who corroborates. She afterwards learnt that\nher mother, 500 miles away, had been taken ill that night\nand died two days later. The accoimt was written\nwithin a week of the experience. It appears that the\nmother had rapped on the furniture to call attention to\nher need of assistance, and Mrs. Krekel is inclined to\nattribute the auditory part of her experience to this fact ;\nbut this seems pressing the coincidence too far.\n\fLxxxvi.J Spontaneous Gases : hripression Externalised. 265\nThere are three cases\u2014one of apparitions and two of\ndreams\u2014in which two percipients are concerned, and\nwhich for this reason it is convenient to take together.\nIn the first two the agent's experience is illness, as in\nthe cases just dealt with.\nIn the first (L. 820, Journal, Vol. III., p. 356) the two\npercipients in different rooms, but on the same evening, see\napparitions of the sick person. It has been described in\nProceedings, Vol. V., p. 309, but I do think it has been\nprinted in full except in the Journal, perhaps because, as\nRoll be seen, the accounts given by the two percipients\nare not completely consistent in detail. This is not sur-\nprising in records made more than two and a half years\nafter the experience. It will be noticed that there was\nsomething a little grotesque\u2014unhke a real person\u2014in the\nbehaviour or appearance of both apparitions, and a\nsymbolic suggestion of mourning, and therefore death, in\nthe second. One of the percipients, Mrs. Treloar, writes :\n(L. 820.)\nOn August 26th, 1885, Mr. Treloar and I, then Hving\nat The Firs, Bromyard, dined with my brother, the Rev.\nW. Cowpland. Mr. Treloar's letter of March 3rd, 1888,\nwill describe what happened.\n\" My wife and I were dining with my brother-in-law,\nand there met my wife's sister, who lived a short distance\nfrom the rectory. It was a very lively party, and this\nlady was in the best of health and spirits. It was on a\nWednesday. . . . On the Tuesday following, in the evening,\nabout eight o'clock, my wife, who had been in the nursery\nduring the half-hour the nurse was having her supper,\nwent into our bedroom, where there was a lamp burning\non the dressing-table ; and as she passed the bed, in\ngoing roimd to the other end of the room, she saw, as\nshe thought, a black dress on the other side of the bed,\nbut on looldng again, a figure slowly rose up from what\nappeared a bent position, and looked straight at her for\nthe space of three or four seconds ; and she then recog-\nnised her sister. Her face was very pale, and had a look\nof anguish on it, My wife came downstairs, and I noticed\n\f266 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nthat she seemed troubled, and on askmg her what had\nupset her, she told me. I, of course, thought it must\nhave been a delusion. Next evening (Wednesday, Sep-\ntember 2nd), just as Ave were sitting down to dinner, the\ngroom of our doctor came to the house and said his\nmaster wished to see me. I went down and fomid him\njust about to start for my sister-in-law's residence, as he\ntold me that she had sent for him, and from what he\ncould learn she was in a most dangerous state from\ndiphtheria. She died two days afterwards, and my wife\nnever saw her, as it was, in the doctor's opinion, running\ntoo great a risk.\"\nThis account is correct, but does not state that just\nas I had told him of the apparition, my niece. Miss Maud\nCowpland, who was staying with us, came rushing down-\nstairs from her bedroom, whither she had gone a few\nminutes before\u2014and simultaneously I began to tell her\nwhat I had seen, and she, scarcely heeding me, burst out,\n\"I've seen Auntie Annie ! I've seen Aimtie Annie !\n\"\n[Mr. Treloar confirms this.] I did not question her\nfurther then, but her letter appended shows what she saw.\nShe left the house next day, I believe partly on account\nof the fright. I had never before seen, nor have I\nsince seen, any apparition whatever, nor have I had any\nother experience at all resembling those which I here\nrecount. After the first moment, I was not alarmed\nby the vision of my sister Anne. She was so remarkably\nvigorous and full of life that the idea of her death never\noccurred to me. In fact, what happened was this :\nthere was diphtheria m the parish, and she most impru-\ndently kissed a school-child suffering from that disease.\nOn the Tuesday evening (when the figure was seen) she\nhad retired early to her room, saying to her servants\nthat she had a bad cold. They were young, and there\nwas no one in her house to whom she would have spoken\nconfidentially as to her state. All that can be known,\nthen, of her condition at this moment is that she was\nalone in her room\u2014whether asleep or awake we do not\nl<mow\u2014and that next day she sent for the doctor, and was\nfatally ill. There was a strong affection between her and myself.\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 267\nI may add that the figure which I saw had a boimet\nand veil on, the veil beuig tied back round her bonnet,\nas was my sister's wont. The lamp was bright, and so\nclearly did I see the figure that I observed the freckles\non the nose. My sister had fine, expressive eyes, and\ntheir look m the apparition was full of anxiety and pam.\nThe figure did not disappear instantaneously, but seemed\nto thin away into air.\nMiss Maud Cowpland describes her experience as follows :\nApril Uth, 1888.\nThe year my father died I went to spend a few days\nwith my aunt, Mi's.

The second night, after\nwishing her good-night, about a quarter-past ten, I retired\nto my room, and while having my bath I felt an unseen\npower compel me to turn towards a couch which stood\nat the foot of the bed, at the head of which (I mean\nthe couch) stood a figure dressed in crape, whom I im-\nmediately recognised as Miss Cowpland, and exclaimed :\n\" Why, Amit Annie, how is it you are here ?\n\" Then\nthe figure gradually disappeared.\nIn answer to questions Miss Cowpland adds :\n1. I have never seen anythmg before IMiss Cowpland's\nappearance, but often before and afterwards, when alone,\nhave felt people, or, I think I should say spirits, around\nand near me. One afternoon last summer, a feehng\ncame over me as of a hand, with long, soft fingers,\nstroking my face.\n2. The crape seemed to faU in thick folds from the\ncrown of the head to the gromid, but those folds over\nthe face, instead of hiding, threw the features out most\ndistinctly. I cannot say exactly how long it stayed\n;\nperhaps half a minute ; not longer.\n3. I am ashamed to say I felt most horribly afraid. . . .\nI mentioned it to three people, Mr. and Mrs. Treloar,\nand the servant, whom I asked to sleep with me, as I\nwas too much of a coward to do so alone after that,\nin that particular room. Yes, I remember IMrs. Treloar\n\f268 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\ntelling me what she had seen ; it was after that that I\ntold her my experience.\nThe second case (L. 1210, Joimial, Vol. XVIII., p. 25)\nwas sent to us through Mr. George Tyrrell, an Associate\nof the Society, who is personally acquainted with the\ndreamers. The names and addresses of all the persons\nconcerned have been sent to us, but we have been re-\nquested not to print them ; we therefore give pseudonyms.\n(L. 1210.)\nMr. \" Lawson's \" statement [Enclosed in a letter from Mr.\nTyrrell, dated November 21, 1916.^] is as follows :\nLast Jaly, when my daughter and I were staying in\nSomersetshire, I had a very vivid dream. I dreamed\nthat I was in a bedroom, and saw lying on the floor my\nbrother-in-law [Mr. R. Stephen (pseudonym)] ; he was\nunconscious and looked perfectly ghastly. With some\ndifficulty I hfted him on to the bed ; as far as I could\nsee, he was not breathing and I could feel no motion of\nhis heart. I sprinkled some water on his face, but this\nhaving no effect, I ran to the door and called for assist-\nance. No one came, so I ran out into the road where I\nsaw two men and a woman. I told them that some one\nwas very iU and asked them to go to the nearest pubhc-\nhouse and bring some brandy ; both the men refused,\nsaying that the public-houses were closed, but the woman\nseeing my distress said she would try and get some, and\nI gave her Is. for the purpose. She, however, did not\ncome back again. On returning to the bedroom I found\nmy brother-in-law lying just as 1 had left him. I then\nhunted over the house, but could find no one. I was\nin a terrible state of anxiety and distress not knowing\nwhat to do, and being pretty sure in my mind that he\nwas dead. I then, just as I was giving all up in despair,\nawoke and rejoiced to know that it was only a dream.\nNext monaing I told my daughter of my dream while\nwe were at breakfast, and she said, \" How very curious.\n1 Mr. Lawson cannot remember on what day he wrote this account.\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Oases : Impression Externalised. 269\nI, too, have had a very similar dream.\" These dreams\noccurred on July 3rd [1916], and on the 5th, when we\nreturned home, I went to see my brother-in-law, and\nfound him looking very bad. He told me that on Monday\nnight, the 3rd July, he found himself lying on the floor\nand feelmg very ill ; he was utterly unable to move or\nto call for help. He thinks he must have been uncon-\nscious for a long time. Early in the morning, he managed\nto call the cook, and then remembers nothing more till\n7 o'clock, when he sent for the doctor. He told me he\nhad never felt so ill before, and quite thought it was all\nover for him ; he said he felt such a longmg for some\none to come while lying on the floor, and a feelmg of\ngreat distress at not being able to call for aid.\nI may state that before leaving home, we had seen him\nin quite good health and had [heard] nothing of him while\nwe were m Somerset.\n[C. W. Lawson.]\nMr. Lawson's daughter corroborates his statement, and adds\nan account of her own dream, as foUows : This also was\nenclosed in Mr. Tyrrell's letter of November 21, 1916.\nOn Monday night, July 3rd [1916], I had a most vivid\ndream about my uncle [R. Stephen].\nI dreamt that he came running up to me looking very\niU ; he handed me a book which he asked me to take\ndown in the town. I asked him what was the matter,\nand he said : \"I am very ill,\" and he then left the\nroom where I and two or three other peoj^le were. The\n'\nnext thing I remember was that he was lymg unconscious,\nand that none of us seemed able to go to his help. When\nI came do^vn to breakfast the next morning, my father\ntold me he had had a dream about Uncle [Bob] being\nill ; after hearing this, I was so impressed that I wanted\nto write and ask him how he was, as we were staying\naway at the time ; but we did not write, as we were\nafraid of upsetting him. We returned home on the\nfollowing Wednesday [July 5, 1916], and on Thursday\nmomuag my uncle came up stiU looking very ill and with\n\f270 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.\na nasty cut on his nose which he had got through his\nfall on the same night that I had dreamt about him.\n[E. Lawson.]\nIt has not been possible to obtain any statement from Mr.\nStephen, since he greatly dislikes making any reference to\nhis experience, but evidence as to the date and nature of his\nillness has been obtained from his cook and from the doctor\nwho attended him.\n[Statement by Mr. Stephen's cook concerning his illness, enclosed\nin Mr. TyrreWs letter of November 21, 1916.]\nAt 1 a.m. on July 4th, 1916, I was aroused by hearing\na thud which seemed to come from Mr. [Stephen's] room.\nI sat up and hstened, but hearing no further sound, I\nwent to sleep. At 3.45 I heard Mr. [Stephen] knocking\nat my door and saying: \"Come quickly, I am very ill.\"\nI roused the housemaid and went to Mr. [Stephen's]\nroom ;\nwe found him lying on the floor unconscious and\nlooliing very ill. I sent the housemaid for some whisky,\nand we managed to pour a httle into his mouth, and\nthen with difficulty lifted him into bed ; he was icy\ncold, and I should think had been Ijnng for hours on the\nfloor ; he then revived a little, and said :\n\" I am feeling\nvery ill. I think I am dying.\" I wanted to send for\nthe doctor, but he would not let me. After a bit he\nseemed to get better, so we went back to bed ; at 7\no'clock I went to his room and found him still very ill,\nand he agreed to my sending for the doctor. On clearing\nout his room the next day, I found clots of blood under\nthe washing-stand, so the thud I heard at 1 o'clock must\nhave been caused by his falliiig against the washing-stand,\nas his nose and face were cut about.\n(Signed) [F. Williams] (pseudonym).\nThe doctor's statement, verified by reference to his pro-\nfessional diary, is as follows :\nNovember 26, 1916.\nI was called at 3.45 a.m. on July 4th, 1916, to see Mr.\n[R. Stephen] at Cottage, \u2014\u2014. He had then re-\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : tmiyressio7i Externalised. 27l\ncovered consciousness (he had been unconscious for some\nconsiderable time), and was sufferuag from the effects of\nrather severe haemorrhage due to a womid caused by a\nfall. [C. Barker] (pseudonym).\nIt will be observed that Dr. Barker differs from the cook\nas to the hour at Avhich he was called in. He is more likely\nto be accurate in such a matter, but the point is not im-\nportant for our present enquiry. There seems httle doubt\nthat Mr. Stephen was first taken iU at about 1 a.m. on July\n4, 1916, and that he remained wholly or partially unconscious\nfor some hours.\nIn the dreams the veridical points, namely, the IjHing on\nthe floor unconscious and the difficulty in getting help,\nare wrapped up in imaginary incidents of a dramatic\ncharacter in which the dreamer plays a part.\nIn both these last two cases the two percipients were\nin different rooms, and we do not know that their ex-\nperiences were simultaneous. They should be compared\nwith L. 1223, p. 167 above. In the very striking dream\ncase which follows (L. 1138, Journal, Vol. XI., p. 269), the\ntwo dreamers were together and apparently dreamt simul-\ntaneously and almost exactly at the time of the accident.\nThe dreams were supplementary to each other rather than\nidentical. The case was sent to us by the kindness of\nJMiss K. Raleigh, of Beechwood, Loudwater, Bucks.\nL. 1138.)\nThe accomits were enclosed in a letter from Miss Raleigh,\ndated Aprh. 28th, 1904, and were, she says, written by the\nwitnesses independently of each other. They gave their full\nnames and addresses, but wished mitiaLs only to be printed.\nMiss M. L. B. wrote as follows :\nIn compliance to the request of Miss K. Raleigh I have\nwritten thus :\nOn the evening of November 18th, 1903, I, M. L. B.,\nretired about half-past nine o'clock and fell asleep. I\n\f72 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nhad a most peculiar vision or dream. I thought I was\nwall<ing through streets in a strange place ; it was arti-\nficially lighted ; there Avere a number of people walking\nto and fro on either side of the streets. I heard a\npecuhar noise, and turned partly round to see what was\nthe cause of it. A vehicle was coming rushing across\nthe top of the street ; I was a few paces down ; it looked\nsomethmg like a train, but not a train, it was running\non metals ;\nsomething was coming down where I had\ncrossed ; there was an awful crash as if my (so-called)\ntrain had rma upon something, and in a moment some-\nthing heavy fell with a sickenitag thud on the pavement,\nat my feet. I tried to cry out, but could not. In a\nmoment a crowd had collected, and several people picked\nup the body which had fallen at my feet. I could see\nit was a man. I could not see the face, only a large\ngash on the baclv of the head, and near the lips, from\nwhich the blood was flowing. As the drops fell they\nsplashed ui.to a puddle of blood on the groimd and\nsprinkled on to me. Some one said, \" Take him away.\"\nI tried to cry out, \"What shall I do?\" and awoke\ntrembhng and perspiring, and crying bitterly.\nI could not think where I was, [but] found I was in\nbed, and had been dreaming, as I supposed. I lay quite\nstill for fear of disturbing my sister. In a short time my\nsister ht a match and looked at her watch, and said,\n\"It is past eleven o'clock.\" I did not teU her of my\ndream, as I did not wish her to worry. I thought it\nstrange for her to get a light and tell me the time. I\nwas fearfully worried for some days.\nOn the Monday morning followmg, I had another dream.\nI dreamed my brother, H. B., (I had not seen since the\nprevious January, or even heard from him) was lyhig ill\nin a strange room, and a man was putting him in an\nambulance. I thought he said, \" Take my sister away,\nI am not fit to be where she is.\" He looked so strange,\nI awoke again in great agitation.\nOn the same evening a young friend. Miss P., came to\ncall, and my sister left us alone. After she had gone I\nsaid, \" R., have you heard if my nephew, or any one\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 273\nbelonging to me, has met with an accident, and they will\nnot tell me, as I have had such strange dreams and feel I\ndon't know what to do with myself.

She said, \" Don't\nfret,\" and assured me she had heard nothing concerning\nany one belonging to me. I stiU felt miserable.\nOn the 26th of November we received the news that\nour brother, H., was lying iU in F Infirmary, in a\nprecarious condition ; on the 27th we received the news\nthat he was dead, died the previous day after the letter\nwas posted to us. On the paper enclosed you will find\nall the main information we received regarding our brother's\naccident and death. If you compare the dates you will\nfind the accident happened at the time I was dreaming\nabout it. I had better state here I have never seen an\nelectric tramcar. What I have written here is perfectly\ntrue.\nI have not seen my brother either hving or dead since\na year last January, as I was much too iU to go to his\nfuneral.\nThe other sister, Miss H. M. B., wrote :\nNovember 18th, 1903, I went to bed at 10 p.m. and\nwas going to sleep when a loud crashing soimd roused me,\nand the voice of my brother followed saying, \" Oh Duck,\nI am done for.\" I covered my eyes and said, \" Oh\nH., is it your face that is hurt?\" He said \"No.\"\nThe horror of it was extremely depressing. It was about\n11.15 and I could get no sleep through the night, it\nworried me so. I had not seen my brother since the\nprevious January, and he had not written to me since.\nDuck was his pet name for me.\nMiss P., the friend referred to in the first account, wrote :\nOn the 23rd of November, 1903, I, R. P., went to\nto see my friend Miss M. B. On the 23rd of November\nmy friend told me of her distressing dream that she had\ndreamed on the 18th of November, 1903 ; it seemed as\n\f274 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick.

The\nmain features in the written account correspond with\nwhat they told me.\nMiss M. B. told me that she has had various similar\nexperiences. Katherine Ann Raleigh.\nIt is an interesting question in a case like this whether\nboth percipients received simultaneously telepathic impacts\nfrom the external agent, or whether one received it and\npassed it on to the other, as presumably happens when\nsimilar and simultaneous hallucinations or dreams occur\nwithout any known corresponding external event to which\nthey can be referred. (For instances, see Chapter IV.\nbelow.) A possible conjecture is that both things hajj-\npen and perhaps fortify each other. If in this particular\ncase, for instance, there had not been a three-cornered\ntelepathic connection between the two percipients and\nthe external agent, it is conceivable that the impressions\nreceived might have been less vivid, and perhaps have\nfailed to reach the normal consciousness through the\ndreams. This is in effect the hypothesis proposed by\nGurney in relation to veridical collective hallucinations\n\u2014\nsee Phayitasms of the Living, Chap. XVIII., \u00a7 7.

Pseudonyms have therefore been substituted.\nThe experience seems to have been a \" vision \" somewhat\nresembling that of Miss Paterson (L. 1207, see above,\np. 243). Miss Head wrote :\n(L. 1193.)\n26, Leinster Square,\nBayswater, W., J^dy 4, 1912.\nI have lately heard of a well authenticated case of\ntelepathy.\nA friend who is at present hving with us, Miss Margaret\nSimpson, lost her brother in the wreck of the Titanic.\nThis brother had had for some time past a post on\nboard one of the other vessels of the White Star line,\nbut he had been compelled to resign it on accoimt of\niUness.\nJust before the Titanic sailed lie had the offer of a\nsimilar post on board the fated ship, which he accepted\nat the last moment.\nThe fact of his having done so was known to Miss\nMargaret Simpson, but not to a married sister, Mrs.\nHenderson, who lives in Vancouver.\nOn April 19 [1912] Mrs, Henderson wrote m, a letter to\n\f&XXXVI.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 279\nMiss Emma Simpson (another sister living at Clifton) the\nfollowing account\n:\n\" I was busy in the afternoon after lunch on Tuesday,\nApril 16, and I saw Bessie and Nina crying and clinging\nto one another.

But she did not know her brother was on\nboard, and therefore had no reason to associate his wife\nand daughter wdth the loss.\nThere is a curious case (L. 989, Journal, Vol. VII.,\np. 108) in which, apparently between sleeping and waking,\nMr. Shrubsole in England sees his son twice over in\npositions more or less veridical at the actual time (as he\ns\n\f280 , \/ Mrs. Henry Siclgivich.

Moreover, the fullest account of\nthe experience (we have two) was not written within our\nlimit of five years. The earlier account seems to have\nbeen written about seven months after the event.\nThe remaining experiences corresponding to accidents\nhappening to the agent are undoubtedly dreams. The\nfirst I will quote (L. 992, Journal, Vol. VII., p. 125)\noccurred on the night after the accident, and is a good\nexample of dream dramatisation, with the dreamer playing\nan important part. There is too much correspondence\nwith fact to be easily attributed to chaiice, but, as will\nbe seen, the accident was in the dream connected with\nthe wrong sister, and the dream representation of it was\notherwise incorrect.\n(L. 992.)\nMiss C.

[part\nwhich her father was eaptam, and of his being saved, he\nand the crew having taken to the boats. The coincidence\nwas striking, the ship having gone down that night, but\nthe value of the evidence is weakened by the fact, which\ncame out in a trial later, that the ship was known to be\nunseaworthy by the owners and by the captain (who had\nbeen promised a bonus on his salary), and therefore pos-\nsibly by his family. The dream was told to the child's\nmother immechately after its occurrence, but was not\nrecorded till a week later, after Captain Spruit had\nreturned home.\nThe second case (L. 1118, Journal, Vol. IX., p. 151)\ncomes from Professor Alexander of Rio de Janeiro. Dona\nMarie do Carmo Blum had a confused dream on the\nnight (as she beheves) of April 27, 1899, that Dr. Garnier,\nwho was her medical attendant when she lived at a dis-\ntant town, had fallen in alighting from a carriage and\nbeen much hurt. This dream, which disturbed her a\ngood deal, she related to her husband, but it was not\nrecorded till about six weeks later, when it had been\nlearnt that Dr. Garnier had had such an accident on\nApril 27 in jumping from his carriage to try to stop some\nrunaway horses, and had suffered from concussion of the\nbrain. There was some doubt whether the date of the\ndream was remembered independently.\nIn the third case (L. 1178, Journal, Vol. XIV., p. 155)\nthe dream coincided not with an accident, but with a\nfriend's great anxiety lest there had been one. Miss G.\ndreamt of her friend Mrs. L. coming to her in motor\ncostume and in great distress, and then, confusedly, of\nher being distressed because her husband had gone away.\nMr. L. and two friends had gone out motoring that\nevening ;\nthe motor had broken down a long way from\nhome ;\nit was impossible to communicate with Mrs. L.,\nand they did not get home till two o'clock in the morning.\nMrs. L. had been in great distress and anxiety, and had\nwished for Miss G. to help her.

Coincidence tvith ideas or wishes connected by the\nagent with the j^&^cipi^nt.\nIn this section are put together hallucinations and\ndramatic dreams which seem to be causally connected\nwith a mental condition or idea in the agent, associated\nby the latter with the percipient\u2014either a desire for the\npercipient's presence or information to be conveyed to\nhim. It must be admitted, however, that in some of\nthe cases to be quoted the agent's part is somewhat\nconjectural.\nOne of the most striking instances of this kind in the\ncoUection is L. 1227 {Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 83). It\nappeared in the Westminster Cathedral Chronicle for March\n1919, and we are indebted to the Editor for permission to\nprint it. The names and addresses of all those concerned\nhave been given to us, but are withheld by request. The\ncase may be best classed as one of telepathic transference\nto the percipient of the agent's great desire that he should\nvisit her. The percipient's experience took the form that\nan actual sick call might have done, and was taken by\nhim at the time to be a waking experience. But whether\nit really was so is doubtful. It was on the Ime between\nsleeping and waking, and it is impossible to say whether it\nwas a vivid dream that woke the percipient or whether\nhe woke to see and hear an apparition. It is perhaps\nmost probable that it was both, and that the dream\nwhich woke him persisted for some seconds as a waking\nhaUucination.\nThe report in the Westminster Cathedral Chronicle,\nslightly abbreviated, ran as follows :\n(L. 1227.)\nOne afternoon a short time back Fr. Brompton (to give\nthe priest a fictitious name) was requested to visit a lady\nwho was ill. When he arrived at her house he met\nthe doctor, who very urgently requested him not to ad-\nminister the last rites at that particular moment, but to\nbe satisfied with giving the patient a few cheering words.\nHe very reluctantly consented, but, when he saw the\n\f288 Mrs. Henry Sidgioich. [part\nlady, greatly regretted his promise and the fact that the\ndoctor should have made such a request, as he feared\nthat the patient was very much worse than he had been\nmade to miderstand. However, his promise had been\ngiven ; so he arranged that he would come again in the\nmorning and admmister the Last Sacraments. Before he\nleft the house, however, he gave the nurse his telephone\nnumber and asked her to telephone should the patient\nbecome suddenly worse before the morning.\nAs usual, that night the telephone was switched on to\none of the Fathers' rooms, as is the custom at the\nOratory, with a view to any possible sick-calls. Fr.\nBrompton retired to bed at his usual hour after reciting\nhis rosary, in which he did not forget to include his\npatient of the afternoon. In the early morning he was\nstartled out of a deep sleep by his bedroom door opening,\nand saw, by the hght of the moon through his open,\nxmcovered window, a medium-sized, dark-robed figure\nstanding by it, and understood the person to say some-\nthing about a sick-call.\n\" For heaven's sake, man,\" he hastily answered, sitting\nup m bed and rubbing his eyes, not quite sure if it was\nthe Father on duty, or the lodge porter, \" speak clearly.\"\n\" Be quick !\n\" came the reply in clearer tones. \" There\nis no time to lose. There is a telephone message.\"\n\"Right\u2014right you are !\n\" at once answered Fr. Brompton.\nThe word \" telephone \" brought back in a moment to his\nmind the sick-caU of the previous afternoon, and it did\nnot therefore occur to him to ask for the address. He\nsprang out of bed\u2014the door closed as he did so. Turning\non the hght, he observed that it was just on the quarter\nto four. He quickly dressed, and went to the chapel for\nthe Holy Oils and the Blessed Sacrament, remarking, by\nthe way, on the forgetfuhaess of his caller to turn on the\nhght for him. Making his way swiftly across the space\nbetween the house and the gates that shut it off from the\nmain road, he found them locked as they should be,\nand had to knock up the lodge porter to let him out.\nWithin a minute or two he was well on his way to the\nhouse he had visited the previous afternoon, and as he\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 289\nwaited after his first ring at the bell and congratulated\nhimself on his smart arrival, he looked at his watch and\nsaw that it still wanted five minixtes to four. He rang\nagain\u2014-and again. ... A clock in the vicinity chimed\nthe hour. He rang and knocked. \" Strange that there\nis no one ready to answer the door after telephoning,\"\nhe thought. In the stillness of the moonhght night he\nthought he was makhig enough noise to wake the dead.\nThe dead ! Could the worst have happened ? His regret\nof yesterday came upon him with sudden force, so that\nhe became alarmed. He banged at the door. The\nelectric Ught was on in the hall and on the stairs, as he\ncould see. He knew that there were only six people m\nthe house\u2014the sick lady in one room, her husband, given\nup as hopeless, in another, two day nurses (now evidently\nin a sound sleep), and the two night nurses in attendance\non the patients. The children had all safely recovered,\nfrom influenza and had been taken elsewhere. ... A\nclock chimed the quarter past. At last, to the priest's\ngreat reUef, the door opened.\n\" Come in, doctor,\" said a nurse ; I fear you have\nbeen kept waiting.\"\n\" I am not the doctor ; I'm a priest.\"\n\" Oh, I suppose they telephoned for you ? That's bad\nnews. WiU you go up ?\n\"\nFr. Brompton made his way up to the sick-room, and\nas he quietly entered he saw the nurse kneeling by the\nbedside and noticed that she was very startled as he\nentered. He also heard the sick person saying :\n\" I do\nwish Fr. Brompton would come.\" Afterwards he learned\nthat for the space of about half an hour before his arrival\nthe lady had been expressing a wish to see him. The\nnurse, not bemg a Cathohc, and not reahsing that a\npriest would come outside the ordinary hours, suggested\nthat she should recite some prayers from a Cathohc\nprayer-book. Fr. Brompton arrived while she was doing\nthis. He at once gave the lady the Last Sacraments,\nmuch to her rehef and peace of mmd. Within an hour\nor two she became imconscioiis. After reciting the prayers\nfor the dying, the priest prepared to leave the house.\n\f290 Mrs. Henry Sklgivicic. [par!\n\"Thank you so niucli for coming so opportunely,\" said\nthe nurse, \"but you quite startled me.\"\n\" On the contrary, thanks are due to you for tele-i\nphoning.\"\n\" Oh, but I dichi't !\n\"\n\" Well, someone did. I expect it was Mrs. 's\nsister.\"\nAs the nurses were not Cathohcs, the priest took it\nthat one of the lady's relations had telephoned in her\nanxiety about her sister. Fr. Brompton heard that she\ndied a few hours later. She became a Cathohc at the\nage of eighteen, and had been an exceUent one up to her\npious death at the age of thirty-two.\nIn the evening of the same day, Fr. Brompton had\noccasion to speak to the Father whose duty it had been\nto answer the telephone, and in the course of conversation\nsaid :\n\"By the way, I'm sorry I spoke to you so sharply last\nnight.\"\n\" Why, when do you mean ?\n\"\n\" When you came to call me.\"\n\" But \/ never called you. last night !\n\"\n\"My dear Father, you came to my room at a quarter\nto four this morning and told me there was a telephone\nsick-call.\"\n\"I never left my room last night. I had a sleepless\nnight and happened to note that I was awake at that\nvery time, as I had my light on. And what is more,\nthere was no telephone call last night !\n\"\nLi the above story it should bo borne in mind that Fr.\nBrompton had had no reason, up to the moment he spoke to\nthe Father responsible for the night telephone, to suppose\nthat anything unusual had happened. He had had a sick-call\nm the afternoon and would return the following morning in the\nordinary way. He mentioned the sick person in his prayers\n|\nas was his wont in such cases. He made no special prepara-\ntions before gomg to bed. He was awakened by his door\nbeing suddenly opened.

There was nothing unique to\nme in the manner of the call, it came hke dozens of\nother sick-calls ; bat what was, and is a unique experience\nto me is the denial of the person who called me.\n[Father Brompton.]\nIt is of some interest in connexion with this case that\nabout a fortnight after the death of the agent she pur-\nported to communicate through Mrs. Leonard, the sitter\nbeing a lady who was not acquainted with her and did\nnot know of her death.

[part\nThere are two cases in which the agent's desire to call\nthe percipient is translated into an aixditory hallucination.\nThe first (L. 1143, Journal, Vol. XII., p. \"l4) came from\nan Associate of the Society, Mr. Clissold, and was sent to\nus, enclosed in a letter dated September 20, 1904, by the\nlate Colonel Taylor, then a Member of the S.P.R. Council,\nto whom Mr. Clissold and his daughter had been known\nfor some years.\n(L. 1143.)\nMr. Chssold writes :\nRavensworth, Cheltenham,\nSeptember I4th, 1904.\nOn Saturday, September 10th, I was in my daughter's\ngarden pruning some trees. I had just completed my\nwork about 7 p.m. when I distinctly heard my daughter's\nvoice calling me, \"\nwhen are you coming down ?\n\"\nusing a familiar name by which no one but she addresses\nme. I looked aU romid me and could see no one, so I\ncalled to her several times, but receiving no answer\nsupposed that she had called me and then gone home.\nHowever, when I got to the bottom of the garder, a\ndistance of about 40 yards from where I was pruning, I\nfound her at work among her flowers, and on asking her\nwhy she had called me, she said, \" I never caUed you at\nall, but I was thinking of you very much a short time\nago and thought I must caU you, but I did not.\" It is\nperfectly certain that I heard her voice distinctly, and it\nis equally certain that my daughter did not call me.

I kept on thinking I would call him to come\ndown, as he had not been weU in the morning, and I\nwas afraid he would be over tired, but I knew he hated to\nbe worried. For about half an hour I thought of nothing\nelse but whether I should call him or not, and suddenly\nI saw him just above me, and he said, \" Why did you\ncall me ?\n\" I said, \" I did not call you, but for some\ntime I have been thinking of doing so.\" If I had called\nhim, I should not have made use of the famihar name\nhe said I used, as I knew the gardener was working\nclose by. My husband went up since, and stood hstening\nat the exact spot where my father stood. I called as\nloud as I could to him from the spot where I was working\nwhen my father heard me caU him, and he could only\nhear me faintly ; he was expecting it and hstening for\nthe call.

Mr. CUssold was at\nthe far end of the highest terrace, and his daughter on the\nlowest, at a level of 38 feet below where he was standing,\nand at a distance of 124 feet measured horizontally from a\npomt 38 feet vertically below him. Supposing, therefore, that\nshe had miconsciously uttered her thought aloud, it seems\nquite impossible that he should have heard it.\n.\nThe second case of the kind (L. 1177, Journal, Vol. XIV.,\np. 143) also came from an Associate, now a Corresponding\nMember, of the Society, Mr. Severin Lauritzen.\n(L. 1177.)\nHe writes :\nHoLTE, Denmark, May 5, 1909.\nI live in a viUa in the country, and in a neighbouring\nvilla hves my married daughter, who is named Evelyn.\nThere is only a distance of 33 steps, or say some 22\n\f294 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick.

The same\nday about 1 o'clock my son-iii-law, K., telephoned from\nhis place of business in the town to my house to say\nthat he wanted to speak with Evelyn. It was my wife\nwho answered the telephone when K. called, and when\nshe heard what he wanted she immediately pressed the\nbutton of the private telephone to summon E. Just\nbefore this moment E. heard her mother's very clear\nand distinct voice call \" Evelyn, Evelyn.\" She arose\nfrom her writing desk where she sat absorbed in house-\nhold accounts, opened the door to the hall in her\nhouse, and asked Miss N., who was working there,\n\"Did mother caU ?\n\" \"No,\" said Miss N., \"Nobody\ncalled.\" E. said: \"Yes, she did call.\" Then she turned\nto go back to an open window in the room where she\nhad been writing, to see if her mother was outside\nthere ; but she did not reach the window before she\nheard the private telephone bell sounding, so she turned\nagain and went straight to my house without answering\nthe call per telephone. Passing the telephone and Miss N.,\nshe said, \" There, you see, mother called.\" Arrived at\nmy house, she found that her husband wanted to speak\nwith her. Just as she had finished her conversation with\nher husband I came out from an adjacent room to\nspeak with her, but she interrupted me and said, \" Now\nwe have a clear case of telepathy.\"\nThe account is countersigned by Mr. Lauritzen's wife\nand daughter, and Miss N. Mr. Lauritzen proceeds to give\nat some length the reasons, including experiments, for\ncertainty that his daughter could not have heard her\nname called even if her mother had called her, which she\ndid not, and that the call she heard preceded the tele-\nphone bell. This evidence, important though it is, I\nomit for the sake of shortness.\nThere is another case resembling these, though the\nsound heard was not vocal but a bell, and the agent's\n\fLxxxvT.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 295\ndesire was not directed to any particular percipient\n(L. 993, Journal, Vol. VII., p. 162).

I only describe the\ncase thus briefly because unfortunately the accounts we\nI\nhave from agent and percipient were not written till four\nyears after the event, and some discrepancies between them\nin details show that there is haziness of memory somewhere.\nThere are two cases in which the apparent agent is\napproaching the percipient who has an experience\u2014in one\ncase an auditory hallucination and in the other a dream\n\u2014\nsuggesting the agent's approach.\nThe first (L. 1222, Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 30) we heard\nof from Miss E.

The dream not only conveys information contained\nin the letter, but is apparently timed by its arrival or\napproach. A striking case is L. 1133, Journal, Vol. XI.,\np. 138. It was sent to us by Mr. A. H. Atkins of\n3 Clarendon Park, Torquay, with some other apparently\ntelepathic experiences that had occurred in his family.

Talking about dreams, Sophie [Niederhauser's] letter\nadds one to the very curious list of coincidences in this\nrespect, to wit :\u2014I had not thought or heard anything\nof AHce Birniau or Smith as she is now since her marriage ;\nI only knew she was married to a man named Smith\nabout two years ago. Well, Friday night I dreamt I met\nher with her husband, and she seemed to be in a flourish-\ning condition, both exceedingly well dressed ;\nthey were\nstaying at a hotel in the place where we met them,\nwhere it was I don't Imow, and they were going to\nsome exhibition or other. I remarked to Ma in my\ndream, she being with me, \"AHce seems to have done i\nwell, she has just the same ideas as before.\" There\nendeth my dream ; I woke up, dressed, and went dowTa-\nstairs Saturday morning, where I found a letter from\nSophie awaiting me, and almost at the outset of her letter\nshe informs me that Ahce and her husband called on\nthem suddenly last Saturday week. [Here follows a\ndescription of the letter, for a copy of which see the\nnext document.] While reading this epistle it seemed\nto me that I was reading something I already knew\nquite well. Rather a remarkable coincidence, that\n!\nI am going to give Sophie a description of her husband\nas I saw him in the dream, and I quite expect it will\ntally with that of the real man.\n\flXxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : tm-pression Externalised. 303\nThe next document is a translation (from the French) of an\nextract (of which a copy was sent us) from Miss Nieder-\nhauser's letter dated from Aarau, Switzerland, October 23rd,\n1902.\nOn Simday I had visitors from England\u2014can you guess\nwhom ? Alice Birman\u2014^now IVli-s. Smith\u2014with her hus-\nband. They came here quite imexpectedly and as we\nhave only one bed for visitors, they were obhged to go\nto the hotel. They took tea with us at four o'clock\nbut dined at the hotel. They came at ten o'clock on\nSaturday evening and went away at nine on Monday\nmorning. For a long time I had heard nothing of Alice.\nAlice has three servants in her household\u2014a cook, a\nhousemaid, and a nurse. Mr. Smith does not speak\nGerman ; lie is an agreeable man, so gentle and amiable.\nThey seem to hve like children, happy and affectionate.\nThey had decided to come to Switzerland suddenly, one\nevening. Mr. Smith brought home the tickets and they\nset ofF the same night. Alice's chUd is ten weeks old\n;\nhe is called O. F. Alice is just as she always was ;\nshe is quite different from our other friends. She went\non to Zurich, Liiceme, Bale, and Paris, from whence she\nis going home this morning. On Friday moniing she is\nto go to a dog show in London Avith one of her three\ndogs. I have her photograph in which she has on one\nside her baby, a beautiful child, and on the other a very\nfine dog. She seemed a little older than before. . . .\nThe visit was over so quickly that I almost feel as if I\nhad dreamt it.\nAfter receiving Miss Niederhauser's reply to her letter about\nMr. Smith's appearance, Miss Atkins wrote on January 13th,\n1903:\n. . . Ahce Birman Smith's husband corresponded with\nmy dream in that he is very fair, with dehcate features\nand a gentle demeanour and smaller than Ahce ;\nonly in\nmy dream he was only shghtly smaller than Alice, whereas\nhe would appear to be a good deal smaller, and Sophie\n\f304 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\nsays he is clean-shaved, and I dreamt he had a fair\nmoustache. Of course, if I were to see the man I could\ntell \\\\x an instant if he resembled my dream, and at all\nevents, considering I had not the slightest idea of what\nhe was hke, my dream was fairly accurate, and besides\nthat the incidents resembled very much the way that\nSophie saAv Ahce ; to wit, they were staying at a hotel,\ncalled on Soiahie quite unexpectedly, both together, and\nwere going to an exhibition to show a dog ; the only\ndifference in my dream was that I met them in the\nroad ;\nall the other particulars were correct. What\nstrikes me as more wonderful, though, was the feeling\nwhen I read Sophie's letter that I already Icnew what\nshe was teUing me, a feelhig perfectly clear and strong ;\nthat I thmk is the strongest proof of bram communica-\ntion, far more importcant than the exact accuracy of the\ndetails.\nIn this case the letter must either have just arrived or\nhave been on the verge of arriving when the dream\ncorresponding to it occurred. We may further observe\nthat if we may regard the dream Mr. Smith as sufficiently\nlike the real one to justify the supposition that a super-\nnormal impression of him had been received, it follows\nthat the veridical parts of the dream were at any rate\nnot entirely derived from the letter, but partly at least\ndirect from the writer. This is an important considera-\ntion when we attempt to trace the supernormal process\n\u2014\nassuming there was one ; and the number of points in\nthe dream corresponding with fact make chance coincidence\nimprobable.\nIn the next case (L. 954, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 103) the\ntime -coincidence between the dream and the arrival of\nthe letter is very clear. On the other hand, the corre-\nspondence in the content of the two is practically limited\nto both being almost entirely occupied with the same\nunlikely individual. But again, as in the last case, we\nhave an element in the dream\u2014the interruption of the\nspeaker by noise outside\u2014which was not in the letter,\nbut was in the mind of the writer.\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 305\n(L. 954.)\nThe case comes from the Rev. W. M. Lewis, who wrote\nfrom Tyllwyd Penycwm, R. S. 0., Pemb.\nOctober lOth, 1891.\nMy residence, where I have hved for thirty years, is\nwithin half a dozen mUes of St. Da-\\dd's Head, Pem-\nbrokeshire, occupying a farm and having the pastorate\nof a small country Welsh Nonconformist church. I\nspent, however, the greater part of May, 1890, in London,\nW. One morning during my stay there, I was awoke\nby the postman's knock, who, as usual, threw his letters\n[on] to the door mat within and passed on. Not wishing\nto get up just then, I again slept for a short time, all\nof which time became apparently occupied with a dream,\nin which I found myself in a crowded hall listening to a\nlecture by the Rev. D. C. D , M.A. (London), then\nPrincipal of T College, Breconshire. The lecturer's\nvoice, always weak, was quite inaudible from where I\nwas seated ; I strained to catch some remarks, but in\nvain. Some noises also outside the hall helped to drown\nhis voice, and among the noises were the sounds of a\nband of music, which grew so loud eventually that the\nlecturer sat doAvn. I got up from where I was seated\nand went and sat beside him, and told him I was anxious\nto attend his lectures at T College, and wished to\nlaiow what were his present subjects. He attempted to\ntell me, but the noises outside were still so loud, that I\nwas unable to miderstand what he said. After repeated\nattempts on his part, I was able to catch the words\n\"Heaven\"' and \"Hell.\" He, however, used a word in\nconnection with each, which I was still unable to detect\nowing to the uproar still continuing. At last I discovered\nthat this word was \" crises,\" and that the subjects he\nwished to inform me of were \" Crises in Heaven,\" \" Crises\nin Hell.\" Ail the circumstances of this dream were so\nvivid and strange that when I awoke, and while I was\ndressing, it entirely occupied my thoughts, and I was\nendeavouring to imagine what could have suggested such\na dream. On going downstairs I found that the only\n\f306 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\nletter delivered that momiiig was for me, and was from\nmy youngest son, then at Aberystwyth College, on opening\nwhich, to my great astonishment, I found it wholly\noccupied with the name that had filled my dream and was\nthen filhng my thoughts, relating, after just a remark\nthat he was glad I was enjoying my stay in London,\nthat on the previous Smaday the Aberystwyth people and\nhimself had had a great treat m having the Rev. D. C.\nD to occupy the pulpit of the chapel he was attending,\nand how he, being such a stranger to the place, had\nattracted immense congregations, preached powerful ser-\nmons, and made the Sunday quite an event in the place.\nI did not Imow that the Rev. Pruicijjal had any intention\nof visitmg Aberystwyth, nor had I any means of knowing.\nThe comcidence appeared to me very remarkable, that\nfrom the moment that the letter wholly occupied with\nthe name of the Rev. D. C. D was thrown on the\nmat, and during the whole of the time that it lay there\nunopened, he should also have filled my dream, and\nshould comiect, through letter and dream combined,\nplaces so far distant and unconnected as London, Brecon,\nand Aberystw3'th. '* '\nThe strangest and most remarkable coincidence remains\nto be told. I mentioned above that m my dream Mr.\nD -'s voice in the lecture Avhich I was endeavouring to\nhear, was inaudible owmg to noises and music outside\nthe hall. Now, I returned from London here the end of\nMay, and in course of a couple of months\u2014at the begm-\nning of August\u2014my son came home from Aberystwyth\nfor midsummer hohdays. One day at table, I related\nthis dream ui his hearing, and mentioned the strange\ncomcidence between it and the letter. When I had\nfinished my son said, \" Father, it is very strange that on\nthe Sunday night when Mr. D was preaching at the\nTabernacle, Aberystwyth, soon after the service began,\nthere was a circus passing into town, along the back road\non which abuts the chapel wall, and so great was the\nnoise and uproar of carriages, horse,s and crowd that for\na long time Mr. D could not be heard ; and much\nblame was thrown on the town authorities that they\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 307\nallowed a procession of that character to disturb the Sunday-\nservices.\" It is but fair I should add that, though I\nhave been once or twice at this chapel of Tabernacle at\nAberystwyth, the lecture hall of my dream did not\ncorrespond to it, but the disturbing uproar of my London\ndream corresponded to that which appears to have occurred\nat the chapel in that it proceeded from behind the lecturer\nor preacher and not from behind the audience.\nMr. Lewis Avrites later :\nI have shown the account to my son, who is now here\n\u2014who corroborates all that relates to him.\nAnother case which appeared at the same time as\nMr. Lewis's in the Journal has been published in Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XIV., p. 279. It was a dream of Sir\nLawrence Jones's concerning a cheque having to be filled\nup and signed, which occurred while an unexpected letter\ncontaining a cheque the dreamer had to sign lay outside\nhis bedroom door.\nIn the next case (L. 936, Journal, Vol. V., p. 246), if\nthe sequence of events is correctly remembered (there was\nan interval of over two years between dream and record),\nthe arrival of a newspaper seems to have been the occasion\nof the dream. We first received a second-hand accoimt\nfrom a lady cognisant of the circumstances at the time,\nfrom which it appears that the dream occurred in the\nwinter of 1888-9. The dreamer, Mrs. E. F., wrote the\nfollowing account on March 18, 1891 :\n(L. 936.)\nThe son of an old friend came West for his health,\nand, apparently much helped, returned home some time\nbefore my own son's health began to fail. Building our\nhopes on doctor's advice, and what we thought Colorado\nchmate had done for that young man, we came out here.\nAbout six weeks after, I dreamed one night that young\nG. had suddenly had a severe hemorrhage, ran right\ndown and died in three or four days [in Connecticut].\n\f308 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick.

I wondered about it in the morning as I\nhad not corresponded with the family or heard about\nthem from others since leaving home, but I was greatly\nstartled, on getting my daily home papers [from Connecti-\ncut] in that morning's mail, to find a notice of the young\nman's death under circumstances very similar to those\nof my dream. The mother's rebeUion at her son's death\nwas afterwards voiced to me in a letter, in language very\nlike that I dreamed of her using.\nThere are two other cases which might be called \" News-\npaper \" cases, both sent by Mr. Andrew Lang, but I think\nif the newspaper had anything to do with the matter at\nall, it was probably as the source of the unknown agent's\ninformation. I will describe them briefly. The first\n(G. 268, Journal, Vol. X., p. 232) was a vivid dream of\nthe death of G. Lohmann, the cricketer, two days after\nhe died in South Africa, but shortly before seven o'clock\non the morning of the day on which the news appeared\nin the morning papers. There was no normal association\nof ideas to suggest the dream, but the dreamer, Mr.\nBrierley, was on the reporting staff of the Sheffield Daily\nTelegraph and mainly concerned with cricket and football.\nThe news of the death only reached the office after he\nhad left it the previous evening, but it seems likely that\nsome of his colleagues when they heard of it would think\nof him in connection with it, and a telepathic com-\nmunication might be the result.\nThe other case (L. 1174, Journal, Vol. XIV., p. 72) was\na vivid dream of being in an earthquake which occurred\nin the early morning of December 29, 1908, about twenty-\nfour hours after the great Messina earthquake. The\ndreamer's first normal knowledge of the earthquake she\nderived from the Scotsman newspaper of the morning of\nher dream, December 29. It had, however, been men-\ntioned in the evening papers of December 28, and friends\nat a distance may have seen these and transmitted the\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 309\nidea to the dreamer telepathically. This, however, is\nhighly conjectural, for no particular agent can be sug-\ngested nor any reason why the dreamer should be selected\nas percipient. The case may be classed with veridical\ndreams of public events with which the dreamer is uncon-\ncerned, like that of President Carnot's murder (see above\namong death coincidences, M.Cl. 88, p. 241).\nTo go back to letters\u2014the following is an odd case\n(L. 1137, Journal, Vol. XI., p. 227) in which the contents\nof a post-card seem to have been telepathically com-\nmunicated to a person other than the one to whom it\nwas addressed\u2014involving apparently, if telepathic, a kind\nof three-cornered telepathy like L. 1180, p. 237 above. The\ncase was sent to us by an Associate of the Society,\nMr. Wilfred Hall, in a letter dated January 4, 1904. He\nhad received the accounts from a friend of his who was\nacquainted with the ladies concerned. All give their names\nand addresses. The dreamer, Miss M.

Elliott.\nMiss ElUott's own accoimt is as follows :\nGateshead, November 25th, 1903.\nSome time ago I mentioned to Miss Robson that I\nhad to go to Sunderland on a certain day to see a friend.\n\f310 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nOn the morning of the day on which I had arranged\nto go, I received a post-card asldng me to postpone my\nvisit, as my friend had had some very bad news about a\nsister hving at some distance. This news was totally\nmexpected, and was a great shook to me, as I loiow aU\nthe family well.\nWhen I saw Miss Robson an hour or so afterwards,\nalmost her first words to me were :\n\" Oh, I had such a\nstrange and vivid dream last night,\" and then she pro-\nceeded to tell me her dream, which was in all respects\nwhat had really happened, even to the wording of the\npost-card.\nI may say Miss Robson knows my friend Miss Smith,\nbut has never met her sister.\nE. M. Elliott.\nAnother dream in which the percipient dreamt the\nsubstance of a postal communication is L. 895, Journal,\nVol. v., p. 173. The dreamer was Professor Thomas\nDavidson, the philosopher, a friend of William James.\nHe writes :\n(L. 895.)\nKeene, Essex Co., N.Y., [Tuesday] J^lne 9th, 1891.\nDear Mr. Hodgson,\u2014Last night, toward morning, I\ndreamt in a vivid way that my friend, Mr. S. F. Weston,\nwhom you know, had sent me a postal card saying that\nhe was \" coming on Wednesday.\" I mentioned my\ndream to two friends. Miss Kent and Mrs. John Dewey\n(of Ann Arbor), at the breakfast-table. At ten we started\nfor Upper Jay, some nme miles off. On our way home\nwe called at the post-office, and there I received from Mr.\nWeston the enclosed letter, the miscored part of which\nyou are free to pubhsh. This was about four o'clock in\nthe afternoon.\nYou will see from the letter that I had no reason to\nsuppose Mr. Weston was coming before the end of the\nmonth. Note that the words which I saw on the card\nare not in the letter. The \"Wednesday\" made a very\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases: Impression Externalised. 311\"\ndistinct impression on my mind. The letter, as you-\nwill see, was written on Smiday.\nI enclose the independent testimonies of the two ladies.\n* * * * * *\nThomas Davidson.\nP.S.\u2014You will understand that, leaving New York\nto-day, Mr. W. will get here to-morrow (Wednesday),\n\u2014T.

Davidson,\u2014I have delayed answering\nyour letter for several days as I have not been quite\nsure where I should spend the month of June. . . .\nAm sorry I shall not be able to get the things you\nwanted as I shall take the boat Tuesday night. Wish\nyou had mentioned them in your letter. ...\nS. F. Weston.\nI omit the corroboration by the two ladies, which la\nprinted in the Journal.\nThere is, it wdll be observed, no exact time-coincidence\nhere. The dream occurred more than twenty-four hours\nafter the letter was written, and apparently some time\nbefore it arrived, while the journey of which the letter\nspoke commenced some twelve hours after the dream.\nIn the case to be next quoted (L. 1218) there is the same\nabsence of time-coincidence combined with communication\ncorresponding with a letter or parts of it. The letter was\ndated and therefore presumably at least begun more than\ntwo days before the dream, but was not posted till some\ntwenty-four hours after it. In both these cases it seems\ncertain that, so far as there was supernormal communica-\ntion, it was the agent's intention to convey the informa-\ntion that operated and not the letter itself. This makes\nit probable that the exact time-coincidence between the\ndream and the arrival of the letter in other cases was\naccidental except so far as the emergence of the impres-\nsion just then may have been stimulated either by the\n0\n\f312 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nwriter's knowledge of when the letter was likely to arrive\nor the dreamer's consciousness of the postman's knock.\n^\nThe case in question (L. 1218, Journal, Vol. XVIII.,\np. 225) was sent to us by an Associate of the Society^\nMrs. C, on March 11, 1918, the dreamer being her\ndaughter. For shortness I omit Mrs. C.'s narrative and\nother corroborative evidence including a note made before\nthe letter was received (all of which are printed in the\nJournal), and give only the dreamer's account, which we\nreceived on April 6, 1918. She writes :\n(L. 1218.)\nOn the morning of Jan. 13th, I awoke from a vivid\ndream in which I saw Arthur S. standing in front of me,\nin khaki. He looked pleased and said he had some\nimportant news to tell me\u2014giving no details, but I heard\nhim say, \"I can never forget my old friend [G].\"\u2014\nThen I awoke.\nAt brealdast I mentioned my dream without going into\ndetails, in fact I wanted the others to guess of whom I\nhad dreamt as it was a very out of the way person.\nMother asked me not to give any details until the same\nevening, which I did in the presence of my sister.\nThree days later, by the very last post, I received a\nletter from Arthur S., dated the 10th, though bearing the\npostmark of the 14th from Seaford. We were aU very\nsurprised to hear that he was in England, that he had\njoined up and had just got married. Almost the last\nsentence in his letter contaiiied these words re my brother,\n\"I often think of my old friend [G.]. ... I have met\na lot of people, but I never forget [G.].\"\n[Signed with full name.]\nIt should be explained that the dreamer's brother [G.]\nhad been killed in the war about two years before, and that\n1 That it is the ideas of the writer of the letter in \" letter arrival\n\"\ncases, and not the letter itself or the actual time of its arrival that\ninfluences the percipient is supported by a case (M. 41) quoted by Myers\nin Proceedings, Vol. IX., pp. 68-70. In this case the information\nemerged through automatic writing.\n\fLxxxvT.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 313\nArthur S. was a friend of his whom the dreamer and her\nfamily believed to be permanently in Canada. Nothing had\noccurred to make the dreamer think of him.\n\u00a7 4. Coincidence with ideas not connected by agent loith\npercipient. Unconscious telepathic leakage.\nI now pass on to cases where the contents of the\ndream or hallucination appear to be due, as in the last\nsection, to an idea or thought in the agent's mind, but\none entirely unconnected by him with the percipient.\nAnd not only, had the agent no intention of communicat-\ning the idea to the percipient, but, so far as is known, no\nthought at all of the percipient in connection with it. If\nthere was telepathic communication, the agent's share in it\nmight be described as unconscious telepathic leakage.\nf-\nI wiU give first a dream (L. 1219, Journal, Vol. XVIIl.,\np. 227) dreamt by the same lady who sent us the one\nlast quoted. To put it shortly : on January 16th, 1918,\nMrs. C, the mother of the dreamer, spent the afternoon\nwith Madme. R., who lived at the top of a high block of\nflats. In the course of conversation on many topics,\nMadme. R. related how Mrs. X. in a delicate state of\nhealth greatly dreaded air-raids. One took place. Mrs.\nX. was taken ill and twins were born prematurely. Mrs.\nC, who did not know Mrs. X., is certain that she did\nnot repeat this tale to her family. Next morning, how-\never, her daughter related a dream which she, the dreamer,\nafterwards wrote down as follows :\n(L. 1219.)\nOn Wednesday, the 1 6th Jan., I dreamt as follows :\nThere was a dreadful air-raid in progress. Mother and\n1 were in a lofty building watching it and at the same\ntime attending to a very tiny baby, which I was holding\nin my arms,- wrapped in a blanket.\nThere waf also another woman in the room carrying\na tiny baby and she seemed very agitated as she walked\nup and down with it.\nIn my dream the raid was very bad, and I could see\n\f314 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nflashes of light on the windows and was nearly deafened\nwith the noise of guns and the humming of the aeroplanes.\nI remember feeling terrified at the time, as it was quite\nthe worst raid I had ever been in. I told mother this\nthe next morning, when she at once said, \" Oh, but this\nis what Mme. R. told me when I was with her yesterday.\"\n[Signed with full name.]\nFor shortness I omit the agent's account and corro-\nborative evidence. A bad air raid combined with two\nlittle babies seems too complicated a coincidence to\nattribute to chance.\nIn the next case (L. 836, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 221) the\nidea transferred is simple but very definite, and the dream\nevidently made an unusual impression. It comes from a\ngentleman who does not wish his name to be printed.\nHis wife has sent us a similar, though somewhat less full\naccount of what occurred.\n(L. 836.)\nDecember 9th, 1889.\nOn Sunday morning, November 24th [1889], I was at\nhome, reading carefully Sir Wilham Hamilton's Lectures\non Metaphysics. After finishmg Lecture xx., I felt some-\nwhat drowsy, and very soon fell asleep. This was at\nabout 12 o'clock. I slept for about 10 mmutes, and\nduring that time I dreamt that a friend of mine ap-\npeared before me and said, \" I say, you owe me twopence\nfor postage in connection with that mortgage.\" \"All\nright,\" I repUed, \" business is business,\" and saying this\nI put my hand in my pocket, and drawing it out gave\nhim the twopence he required. With this I woke.\nMy friend has been managing some mortgage business\nfor me during the last two months.\nMy wife had gone out about 10.15 a.m., intending to\nvisit a church she had not been to before. Finding it\nrather farther than she expected, she thought she would\nlike to take the tram back. But she had left her purse\nat home. However, being near a friend's house (the\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Im'pression Externalised. 315\nfriend I saw in my dream), she called in and asked for\nthe loan of twopence. His wife lent my wife sixpence,\nand he himself accompanied my wife to the church, which\nwas very near. It was just before 11 o'clock. After\nthe service my wife took the tram, and arrived home at\nabout 1 o'clock. My dream had made so great an im-\npression on my mind that I immediately told her about\nit, and to my utter astonishment she related the story of\nborrowing twopence, which she said she would not have\nthought it worth while mentioning otherwise.\nA dream case printed in the Journal for January 1920\n(L. 1228, Journal, Vol. XIX., p. 138) resembles the last\nin triviality and contemporaneousness, and eminently\nsuggests unconscious telepathic leakage, or, as the agent\ncalls it, \" telepathy without conscious effort.\" It was\nsent to us by Mr. B. Jordan-Smith, an Associate of the\nSociety, who wrote :\n(L. 1228.)\nOrchaudlea, Grosvenor Road, Caversham, Reading,\nNovember 27, 1919.\nMiss E. M.

So far I have never tried any telepathic\nexperiments with the lady.\nAfter relating what she said was her dream, she modified\nit by saying that she was more or less in the stage of\nwaking (half awake).\nMrs. Jordan-Smith confirms these statements as she was\npresent at the time.\nB.

[part\nsaid at the time was a dream, just on the point of waking\nup, as follows :\n\" I was counting the number of men and women\ngoing on board ship at Southampton, and the number\nwas fifteen. I could almost tell who they were.\"\nI mentioned that I thought that this was a case of\n\" telepathy without conscious effort,\" and related that at\n8.15 a.m. I was shavmg in an adjoinmg room, and count-\ning up in my mind the number of people going on board\nship on Thursday, and on a ship at Southampton, the\nsame time.

I said to Mrs.\nJordan-Smith : \"I was dreammg about a ship when you\ncame and woke me.\" Mr. Jordan-Smith then took it\nup :\n\" What about a ship ?\n\" he asked. \" Oh,\" I rephed,\n\" it was just going from Southampton, and I stood by\ncounting the people gomg aboard.\" \" How many 1\n\"\nhe asked.\n\" Fifteen,\" I replied.\nHe then told me that just before, and at the time\nMrs. Jordan-Smith broke into my dream, he was shaving\nin bath-room, and was thmking over a ship sailing from\nSouthampton next day, on which he had fifteen passengers.\nEthel Marlbr Thomas.\n(witness) Annie Jordan-Smith.\nIn answer to enquiries, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan-Smith\nand Miss Thomas make it clear that none of them re-\nmembered anything having been said, or having happened,\n\fLXxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases: Impression Externalised. 317\nthat could have suggested to Miss Thomas ships saiUng\nfrom Southampton or the number of passengers.\nAnother case in which unconscious leakage seems to\nhave occurred is L. 1191 [Journal, Vol. XV., p. 337), the\nagent being either Mrs. or Miss Verrall\u2014probably\nthe former\u2014and the percipient Miss \" Ann Jones\n\"\n(pseudonym) mentioned below (pp. 330 and 352) who was\nstaying with them. As regards the agent's side Mrs.\nVerrall writes :\n(L. 1191.)\nOn October 22, 1912, my daughter's script contained\nthe phrases, in juxtaposition :\n\" The Lombard poplar\u2014the Florentine's fierce love\n\u2014\n\"\nThis script was|^- seen by me on Nov. 2, and suggested\nto me that the - combination of Lombardy with Dante\nmight refer to Dante's stay at Verona. Dante at Verona\nis the title and subject of a poem by D. G. Rossetti.\nOn November 7 I began annotating this H. V. script,\nbut left my notes incomplete for further investigation of\nits hterary or classical allusions.\nFurther investigation, after the hint given by the\ndream, makes it clear that the allusion in the script is to\nDante at Verona. . . .\nMiss Jones knew that my daughter and I were auto-\nmatic -writers, but had no knowledge of the H.

Verrall.\nAt breakfast on November 10th Miss Jones described\nspontaneously to Mss Verrall, and afterwards to Mrs.\nVerrall, her dream of the night before, and their accounts\nare given in the Journal, but omitted here for shortness.\nMiss Jones's own account is as follows :\nNov. 21, 1912.\nOn the night between Saturday and Simday, November\n9 and 10 (1912), I was awakened from a rather confused\ndream, in which I was either writing script myself or\nwatching people write, by a voice which gave me a very\nurgent message to the effect that \"They\" were to be\n\f318 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [part\ntold to look at Verona, or to go to Verona, as \" They \"\nwere now on the wrong tack. I was sufficiently awake\nto know where I was, and I asked, \" Whom shall I tell\n\u2014Helen ?\n\" \" Tell H. to tell her mother,\" was the reply.\nIt seemed to me that the mask of Dante, which I may\nhave seen that afternoon in Newnham Library, was\nfloating in the darkness. There was more of this message,\nand 1 was urged to write it down there and then, but,\nfeehng disinclined to get up for a light and writing\nmaterials, I satisfied myself by repeating the whole mes-\nsage. In the morning, however, I had forgotten all\nbut what I told Miss Verrall, and have here set down.\nI am not quite sure that I was myself writing script\nin the dream.\n[Signed Ann Jones.]\nMiss Verrall adds :\nMiss Jones told me to-day, Nov. 21, 1912, that what\nshe saw in her dream was the death mask of Dante,\nwith which she is famihar, not the bust of which there\nis a copy ha the Newnham Library ; but she thought\nthe one might have reminded her of the other.\nHelen de G. Vekrall.\nP.S.\u2014(Dec. 2, 1912.) Although I have often discussed\nquestions of psychical research with Miss Jones, I am\nabsolutely certain that I never told her anything of the\ncontents of my unpublished scripts (except that I once\nquoted to her an automatic poem which I wrote some\nyears ago) until after she had told me of her dream on\nNov. 10, 1912. I then said that I had recently had a\nscript containing references to Dante and Verona.\nH. DE G. V.\nThere is a curious case (L. 1182, Journal, Vol. XIV.,\np. 382) of a dream during a few minutes' afternoon sleep\nreproducing a scene foretold in planchette writing, of which\nthe dreamer knew nothing ; but as the dream was not\nmentioned till the planchette prophecy had been described\nto the dreamer, and as the dreamer seems both un-\ninterested in the incident and distrustful of his own\n\fLXXxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 3i\u00a7\nmemory after a few weeks, I will not describe it further\nhere. There was certainly no intentional telepathic\ntransference.\nIn two other instances of unconscious leakage (if there\nwas telepathy), both collected for us by Mr. F. J. M.\nStratton of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and\ncarefully gone into in detail by him, the dreams occurred\napparently two or three days after the incidents, to which\nthey respectively seem to refer, had become known to\nthe supposed agents. There was therefore no traceable\ntime-coincidence between the impressions of agent and\npercipient, and though this does not exclude telepathy\nas the source of the ideas in the percipient's mind, it\nleaves a wider scope for chance. In both cases the\nagent and percipient were in correspondence, though in\nthe first only about a visit the percipient was to pay to\nthe agent. I will describe both cases briefly.\n(L. 1184.)\nIn the first (L. 1184, Journal, Vol. XV., p. 87) Mrs.\nWooUacott had been staying with a sister-in-law who had\ntwo sons aged eleven and seventeen. A few days after\nshe left, namely, on August 23, 1910, the younger nephew\nhad an accident in the swimming bath, alarming at the\nmoment but leading to no serious consequences. Of this\nMrs. WooUacott heard from her sister-in-law on August 30th\nor 3l8t. During the first week in September her friend\nMiss Poupard had a dream which impressed her much at the\ntime, and which she describes on November 11th, 1910, as\nfollows :\nIn my dream I was reading a newspaper, when the\nstop-press news attracted my attention ; I read that an\naccident had happened to one of Mrs. WooUacott's nephews.\nAs I read I seemed to see the occurrence\u2014the boy ap-\npeared to fall from a bridge or other structure into some\nwater, being either killed in the fall, or drowned. The\nstrange part of it was that I had no idea my friend\nMrs. WooUacott had any nephews, yet in my dream\nthere were distinctly two, their ages being about twelve\nand seventeen.\n\fS20 Mrs. Benry Sidgwick. [paet\nMiss Poupard related this dream to Mrs. WooUacott\nwhen she went to stay with her on September 11th\u2014before\nshe could by any possibility have heard about the nephews\nor the accident.\nIn the other case (L. 1185, Journal, Vol. XV., p. 107)\nthe dreamer. Dr. R. G. Markham, describes what occurred\nas follows on April 30th, 1911 :\n(L. 1185.)\nApril mil, 1911.\nDuring the night of Dec. 5th, 1909, I had a dream\nwhich was so peculiar as to impress itself on my memory,\nand the next morning I mentioned it to the people with\nwhom I was staying at the time, and also the same day\nwrote to my fiancee, and told her to remind me, on the\nfollowing day, to narrate it to her, but gave her no\nparticulars.\nAs far as I can now remember, the dream was as\nfoUows :\nA physician. Dr. L., and I were standing at a bedside.\nI recognised the patient to be a certain Nurse W. who\nwas at that [time] a nurse at the Prince of Wales's\nGeneral Hospital, Tottenham. The Doctor, after examin-\ning her chest, asked me to do so as well, and then asked\nmy opinion about the disease present, stating that he\nhimself thought that she was suffering from heart disease,\nbut certain other signs suggested more serious mischief.\nDuring my residence at this hospital, this particular\nnurse had always been considered as one of the strongest,\nand it was this fact that impressed the dream on my\nmemory. The next day, Dec. 7th, I met my fiancee\nand narrated the dream to her, and to my astonishment\nfomad that the nurse about whom I had dreamt had\nactually been examined and advised to leave the hospital.\nR. G. Markhabi.\nMiss Wilson, afterwards Mrs. Markham, gave a sub-\nstantially similar account almost a year earlier. This is\nprinted in the Journal. It appears that Nurse W. had\n\fLXXXVT.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 321\nbeen examined by Dr. L. on December 3rd, 1909, and\nithat she finally left the hospital about December 12th,\n1909. Presumably Miss Wilson was the agent in this\ncase.\nAs more or less analogous to these latter dreams may\nbe mentioned L. 1096 and L. 1098 {Journal, Vol. VIII.,\npp. 141 and 145), which came to us from the former\nAmerican Branch of the Society. The dreamer. Miss\nLuke, was in the habit of having veridical dreams and\nalso impressions about people somewhat as Mrs. Adam\ndid (see above, L. 1164, p. 64). In the Journal, Vol.\nVIII., four of Miss Luke\"s dreams are recorded, three of\n:them collected and arranged, with, in two cases, corro-\nborative evidence, by Dr. Osgood Mason, who knew her\nweU. Of the four dreams, however, the most striking\nwas recorded too long after the event for our collection,\nand the most important evidentially is quoted in Myers'\nHuman Personality. In the two that remain, the coin-\ncidences are perhaps hardly remarkable enough to merit\ndiscussion here, though interesting regarded as items in a\nseries.\nIn the dreams apparently showing telepathic leakage so\nfar considered in the present section there is no reason,\nexcept possibly in L. 1185 (p. 320), to suspect the presence\njof emotional disturbance in the agent's mind. In the\n[next four cases the idea transferred was to the agent a\n'cause of mental agitation or emotion. Whether this\nhelped to give it what we may caU telepathic energy, we\ndo not know, but at any rate that energy was not in-\ntentionally directed to the percipient. I will take the\ncases in the order in which they appeared in the Journal.\nThe first (L. 1168, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 153) came\nthrough the American Branch of the Society. It was\nsent to Dr. Hodgson by an acquaintance\u2014a Member of\nthe Society\u2014whose name as well as those of agent and\npercipient are suppressed for reasons that will be obvious.\nHe says of Mr. A., the husband of the agent, that he is\na gentleman of unquestioned character and standing whom\nhe has known well for twenty years. Mr. A. writes :\n\f1\n322 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part,\n(L. 1168.)\nNew York, March 24, 1893. !\nOn the 9th of March, 1893, I received from Mr. B.\na letter dated March 8th, 1893, asking for a loan of a\nconsiderable sum of money. The circumstances in the\n'\ncase called for very careful consideration, and certain ^\npecuUar personal relations to Mr. B. and his family\nconnections made it important to have the advice and\nopinion of my wife. I therefore showed Mr. B.'s letter\nto her, and asked her to think about it for a day or\ntwo, which she did, and talked with me on the subject\non the evening of March 9th, and also from time to\ntime on the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th of March.\nOn the 14th of March she received from a friend\u2014Mrs.\nC.\u2014living in a Western town about 2000 miles from\nNew York, a letter dated and posted March 11th, 1893,\nas follows :\n\"My dear Mrs. A.,\u2014Although still confined to my bed tl\nas I wrote you, and finding it a physical difficulty to si\nwrite, a dream of you, which has come to me two sue- I\ncessive nights, is so real I must transcribe it to you, c\nhowever lightly you may choose to consider it, and I i\nbeg your generous heart to pardon any presumption \\\nwhich may appear in my making sufficient of it to send (\nyou a description. c\n\" I saw you walking meditatively up and down a path s\nin your home, with a lace scarf about your head, con- t\nsidering a loan of which you were contemplating the (\nmaking.

It is probably also correct that Mrs.\nA. wore a lace scarf about her head, though of this she\ncannot be certain. INIrs. C. had seen INIrs. A. wearing\nsuch a scarf a year or so ago.\"\nThe repetition of the dream, as here described, is an\ninteresting and unusual feature.\nIn the next case (L. 1173, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 328)\nthe dreamer was Mss Lucy Edmunds, for a long time\nsecretary to Dr. Hodgson, and until recently an\nHonorary Associate of the Society. It is an interesting\ncase, but as affording evidence of telepathy somewhat\ndubious because the dream might quite weU have occurred\nwithout stimulus from without. It is, in fact, w^hat\nGurney would have called an ambiguous case\u2014a class of\ncases dealt with below. The likelihood, however, is con-\nsiderable that the dream was influenced by Mr. Brown's\ndesire to see a vision of his dead son and his effort to\ndo so at apparently the very time of the dream ;\nespeci-\n'aUy as his mind and J\\Iiss Edmunds' were both occupied\nwith the same scene\u2014the view^ from the window.

It was 9.30 before I was in\nbed, when I fell asleep almost immediately. I awoke\nfrom a dream soon after ten. (I judged the time, not\nfrom my watch, but from hearing the clock strike eleven\n(what seemed to be) nearly an hour after awaking.)\nI dreamed that I was awake and sitting on the sofa\nlooldng down the hill towards the hghts among the trees,\njust as I had sat before going to bed, when suddenly\none of the hghts took the form of a human face among\nthe trees. I was so surprised that I rose up and went\nnearer to the window and exclaimed aloud:\n\" What an astonishing thing, that looks exactly like\nthe face of Stuart BroAvn !\n\"\nThe face immediately smiled ; the eyes lit up and\nlooked right into mine, and the face came swiftly towards\nme through the trees, when, just as it got near the\nwindow, it vanished, and I awoke and heard footsteps in\na closet which is next to the room I occupied.\nThe dream was so vivid that I could, on awaking,\nmentally recall the face and compare it with the mmia-\nture which I had seen the day before. It was like the\nminiature, but life size and radiant with hght and exijres-\nsion, commg out of the hght at which I had been looking.\nThe dream wakened me so thoroughly that I did not\nsleep again until after twelve,\nI related the dream to Mrs. Brown at breakfast time\nafter Mr. Brown had gone, and asked her if she went to\nthe closet and whether she thought of Stuart at the\ntime. I thought in the night that such might be the\ncase.\nBefore mentioning the dream to Mr. Brown in the\nevening, Mrs. Brown asked him what he was thinking of\nwhen he went to the closet the night before. He could\nnot remember thmking of anything special excepting in\nconnection with fsome boots which he placed on a shelf,\nand which he had not worn since in camp last summer\n;\nbut he interrupted me, or tried to, when I began to tell\n\fLxxxvi.] Spmitaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 325\nhim my dream and spoke of sitting at the window and look-\ning at the hghts. After I had finished telling my dream\nhe related the following, which he wrote immediately after.\nMr. Brown's accomit is as follows :\nOn the evening of Jxme 4, 1896, about 10.10 p.m., I\nwas sitting in the parlor facing the bay-window looking\nsouth-west, [\" where,\" he says later, \" the outlook is\nalmost precisely the same \" as from Miss Edmunds' win-\ndow] reading the paper. My mind wandered from the\nreading to thoughts of Myers' articles on Crystal- Visions,\nwhich I had read a day or two before.\nLooking out of the window I thought of Stuart, wonder-\ning if it were possible for his face to appear to me and\nwith a great longing that I might see him. I wondered\nif I could be susceptible to such visions, but as I had\nnever experienced anything of the Idnd, in a few moments\ngave it up.\nAfter attending to one or two household duties, I went\nupstairs at 10.20 as I noticed' by the clock. On reaching\nmy room the first thing done was to put away a new-\npair of shoes, moving at the time an old pair which I had\nnot worn smce I was in camp with Stuart last August.\nThis accounts for the footsteps Miss Edmunds heard in\nthe closet wdien she awoke, and times the dream as having\noccurred within a very' few^ minutes of Mr. Brown's\nlonging to see the vision.\nThere follows evidence to show that Mr. Brown's recol-\nlection of his experience and Miss Edmunds' of hers were\nindependent.\nThe following carefully recorded case (L. 1183, Journal,\nVol. XV., p. 17) speaks for itself.\nThe account was sent to us by Major Nelson :\n(L. 1183.)\nThe Mange, House, Stoke D'Abernon,\nSurrey, August 29th, 1910.\nPlaying golf last week I happened to mention to my\nopponent, a member of the Psychical Research Society\n\f326 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [part\na strange incident that occurred to me last Xmas Eve,\nor rather in the early hours of Xmas Day.\nI ought to tell you that I never dream. I believe as a\nchild I had nightmares like other children, but since then\na dream has been to me an unlaiown quantity.\nWith this laiowledge you will understand why what\noccurred last Xmas made so deep an impression. The\nwhole of that day and the next my mind was obsessed\nby the incident, but I kept it entirely to myself.\nOn the momuig of the 27th I dreamed again, and at\ndinner the same night the conversation turned upon\ndreams. Then for the first time I communicated my\nstrange experiences to two ladies sitting on either side of\nme, IVIrs. Rowan Hamilton, of Killyleagh Castle, Co. Down,\nand her niece by marriage, Mrs. Sidney Rowan Hamilton.\nOn the 28th I wrote to Mr. Sandwith, the Rector of\nSt. Bartholomew's, Smithfield, whom I had not seen for\nsome considerable time, and asked him if he had been\nworried about some child. He replied by coming down to\nStoke, and was amazed when I told him what had oc-\ncurred, and proceeded to tell me what had been going\non in his parish.\nThere is no possible explanation of how I could have\nbeen cognisant of the fact that Mr. Sandwith had been\nworried, for I had never heard of the child or of the German.\nHis letter was written after his visit in reply to my\nquestion, and at my request he wrote setting forth the\nparticulars.

He\nknelt down at the table and motioned me to kneel beside\nhim. Then he said, \" Now, I want you to repeat every\nword I say after me.\" I cannot remember the exact\nwords, but the gist was that God would intervene to\nsave some child\u2014whether from danger or death I know\nnot\u2014for I cannot recall the words.\nSuddenly Sandwith stopped speaking English, and began\nto pray in German.

I have for a fortnight or so\nbefore Christmas been considerably worried over the\nmarriage of a German, not a naturahzed Englishman, to\na girl in this Parish.\nI spoke to the girl's father about it, and wrote to the\nBishop of London asking whether the production of a\nX\n\f328 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [PABT\nlicence would guarantee the validity of the marriage, if\nthe contracting parties eventually resided in Germany.\nThe Bishop said he thought so, but that I had better\ngo to Doctors' Commons and state the facts, in case they\nhad overlooked the point of the man not being a natural-\nized Englishman.\nI asked the father of the girl to accompany me, but\nhe said he felt satisfied. This added considerably to my\nworry, as I felt he was the proper person to safeguard\nhis daughter's future, and any interference on my part\nwas a delicate matter. As the Bishop's letter was\naddressed to me personally through his Chaplain, \" you\nhad better go to Doctors' Commons,\" I regarded it as a\npersonal direction from my Bishop and went, and asked\nfor a written statement from the Chancellor of the Diocese\nthat all was in order. This I duly received, and the\nmarriage was solenmized on Christmas Day at 10.20 a.m.\nW. F. G.

He also says that Mr. Sandwith assured him that he\nhad not thought of him in connection with his difficulty.\nHe adds :\nNov. 4, '10.\nThe only connection that I can conceive between the\nfact of Mr. Sandwith's being worried and my dream is\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Extenialised. 329\nthe existence of some lines on the subject of prayer written\nm. a friend's Prayer Book, which I sent to Mr. Sandwith,\nbefore writing them in the book, to ask whether the\ntheology was sound, in Sejjtember, 1909.\nThis statement of Major Nelson's is of psychological interest\nas possibly throwing light on the mechanism of the dream.\nIt seems as if the telejsathic impulse had been the primary\ncause of the dream ; that the thought of the German and\nMr. Sandwith thus telepathically aroused had called up, through\na normal process of association of ideas with the latter, the\nadditional notion of prayer, and that the three conceptions\nwere combined into the dream idea of Mr. Sandwith recitiiig a\nprayer in German.\nThe remaining case (L. 1J97, Journal, Vol. XVI., p. 118)\nof this class\u2014unconscious leakage with emotion on the\npart of the agent\u2014is a curious one. It came to us from\nDr. Emil Mattiesen of Berlin, who evidently took much\ntrouble in collecting the evidence\u2014all the more difficult\nto do because it comes largely from unediicated persons.\nIt is long and somewhat complicated, so I will give only\nthe main points here. The percipient, Mr. Joseph Zohrer,\nwas a shoemaker in Berlin. On May 5th, 1913, he gave\nan account of what he regarded as a waking vision,\nand of the events connected with it, orally to Dr. Mattie-\nsen, who took it down from his dictation. He was, it\nappears, in the habit of occasionally seeing visions and\nhearing voices. In this vision, which occurred on March\n16th, or possibly 15th, 1912, angelic beings and other\n\" spirits \" took part, and the angelic beings told him his\nsister, Mrs. Agnes Sommer, was in need, and that it was\nhis duty to help her ; while a voice said he was to send\nher 60 kronen. This he did by postal order, the post\noffice receipt being dated March 19th, 1912. This is the\nonly contemporary document, for the sister's post-card\nacknowledging the money is lost. According to her\nbrother [translated by Dr. Mattiesen] it ran :\n\" Dear\nbrother. The money you sent me, was a great divine\nmiracle. I was in great need and have prayed God\n\f330 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [PAET\nfervently for help. Then I was told help would come,\nwhereupon I thanked God. But of you I had no\nthought.\"\nMrs. Sommer has written to Dr. Mattiesen to the same\neffect. She kept a shop at Graz in Styria, and her\nbrother believed her to be in fairly flourishing circum-\nstances. She was, however, in great difficulty for want\nof about 60 kronen to meet an urgent account. According\nto a letter to her brother dated July 19th, 1912, seen by\nDr. Mattiesen, and confirmed by the one to himself on\nMay 23rd, 1913, she had prayed earnestly for help on\nMarch 17th, 1912, and received assurance that her prayer\nwould be answered. Also on March 18th, the eve of\nher brother's name day, she had prayed for \" bliss for her\nbrother.\" Both these dates were apparently after her\nbrother's vision, but her anxiety and need of assistance\nprobably began considerably earlier.\nThere is a case difficult to classify (P. 286, Journal,\nVol. XVI., p. 51) which should perhaps be placed in this\nsection\u2014unconscious leakage. On the other hand, how-\never, the more important part of it may be interpreted\nas a premonition not involving telepathy. It is recorded\nvery fully in the Journal, and I feel tempted to leave\nit at that lest I should be accused of dragging evidence\nfor premonition unfairly into a discussion of telepathy.\nI will, however, compromise by mentioning the chief\npoints. Miss \" Ann Jones,\" another of whose experiences\nis described on p. 317 and others on p. 352, dreamt\non the night of July 15th, 1912, that a lady with whom\nshe had recently been staying and a party of friends\ncame in very late from an after-dinner motor drive.\nThis was veridical as far as it went, and happened on\nthe night of the dream and probably almost exactly\ncontemporaneously with it, though it is unlikely that\nMiss Jones' friends thought of her in connexion with\ntheir excursion. But mixed up with this in the dream\nwas a Mr. M. who had nothing to do in fact with the\nmotor party, but whose poems Miss Jones had been\narranging for publication. In the dream he showed her a\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Gases : Impression Extei'nalised. 33\n1\nportfolio of drawings illustrating the poems. Now Mr. M.\nhad recently made the acquaintance of an artist, Mr. F.,\nwho was not known to Miss Jones. He first saw him\nI\non the day (July 11th) on which Miss Jones was arranging\ni the poems, which she despatched to Mr. M. on the 12th.\nThere was no conscious idea of their being illustrated at\nthat time, nor till July 18th, when Mr. M. visited Mr. F.\nat his studio and a sketch for one poem was made, and\nwhen ]\\'Ir. F. asked to see the whole collection. The\nillustrations were drawn in the following week and Miss\nJones saw them on the 29th, when she found they\nresembled the portfolio of her dream. If this was pre-\nmonition pure and simple, we have nothing to do with it\nhere. But if the coincidence was brought about by\ntelepathy, then we must suppose either that Miss Jones\nfirst had the idea, which emerged in her dream, of the\npoems being illustrated, and as agent telepathicaUy sug-\ngested it to Mr. M. and through him to Mr. F., or that\nMr. M. himself had subconsciously the idea of illustrations,\nowing perhaps to making Mr. F.'s acquaintance, and tele-\npathicaUy transferred it to Miss Jones. Mr. M. may have\nknown the probable style and appearance that illustrations\nby Mr. F. would assume. I do not think some such\nchain of psychical events at aU impossible, nor even\nstrained, with the extended idea of the operation of\ntelepathy which is, I think, gradually being forced on us.\nAt the same time there is in this case by itself nothing\nthat can be called evidence of it.\nIt will have struck the reader in perusing the cases so\nfar recorded in this chapter that after \u00a7 1, which contains\nthe death coincidences, a very large proportion of the\nexperiences of percipients are dreams. This is especially\nso in \u00a7 3 and \u00a7 4, dealing with apparent transference of\nideas. And this might have been expected, because,\nexcept in cases of very definite crisis in the agent's life,\nor of very definite desire to communicate with the per-\ncipient, some correspondence in detail is usually required\nbefore we begin to think the coincidence between the\nagent's and the percipient's experiences remarkable ; and\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\ndetails we are much more likely to get in dreams than in\napparitions. As said before, apparitions of the realistic\nkind, which are the commonest, seldom convey anything\nmore to the percipient than the idea of the agent's\npersonality. If they suggest, e.g. his death, it is usually\nby inference only\u2014the inference that so unusual an\nexperience must portend something serious. An inter-\nesting exception, if it was telepathic, is the case (L. 1109)\nwith which I begin the next section.\n\u00a7 5. Ambiguous Cases.\nBy ambiguous cases I mean (1) cases in which the\npercipient's experience is clear and interesting, but in\nwhich either the agent's corresponding experience is not\ndistinctive or unusual enough for us to claim the coin-\ncidence between the two as evidence of telepathy, or\nthe correspondence in time is doubtful. There is a\ncoincidence of a kind, and telepathy may account for it,\nbut the cases would hardly be worth quoting from that\npoint of view alone. (2) Cases may also be called\nambiguous when the coincidence is remarkable, but we\ncannot point to a particular agent. The fact conveyed\nto the percipient by his experience was true and was\ndoubtless known to some person or persons, but there\nwas no obvious reason why the percipient should have\nbeen in touch with them, so that if the knowledge was\nobtained telepathicallj^, an extended view of the operation\nof telepathy seems to be involved.\nThere is, of course, no hard and fast line marking off\nambiguous cases, and the line would probably be drawn\ndifferently by different people. Moreover, it will at once\noccur to the reader that ambiguous cases have already\nbeen quoted or mentioned in this paper. In particular\nI have not attempted to exclude them in Chapter II.,\ndealing with non-externalised impressions, and there are\nseveral examples there. In the present chapter we have\nalso had ambiguous cases, included generally because they\nseemed analogous to some other case. As examples may\nbe mentioned the dreams of President Camot's murder\n(M. CI. 88, p. 241), of General H.'s death (L. 1180, p. 237),\n\ftlXxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 333\nand the dream of an earthquake (L. 1174, p. 308), because\nin these we cannot point to a particular agent ;\nand,\nagain, Miss Edmunds' dream (L. 1173, p. 323) and\ntwo \" arrival \" cases (L. 1222, p. 295, and L. 1225, p. 296),\nbecause it is doubtful whether the agent's side of the\ncoincidence is sufficiently marked. What I am really\ndoing now, therefore, is to put together in this section a\nresiduum of cases, ambiguous in one of the two ways\nmentioned, which belong to this chapter because the per-\ncipient's experience is either a sensory hallucination or a\ndream of the same character, but which do not con-\nveniently fit into any of the groups into which the cases\nin the chapter have been divided.\nThe first case (L. 1109, Journal, Vol. VIII., p. 329)\nI place here with some hesitation. There is some evidence\nfor telepathy, but it depends on details of the agent's\ncostume at the moment being apprehended by the per-\ncipient, and it is difficult to know how distinctive that\napprehension was, especially as the case did not reach us\ntUl the agent and percipient had talked the matter over.\nThe case is interesting whatever way we look at it, for\nif the percipient was, as he believed, awake at the time,\nit is exceptional in our collection in two respects. It is\nthe only reahstic apparition affecting three senses\u2014hearing,\nsight and touch\u2014and it is the only realistic apparition\nconveying any information as to the agent's actual con-\ndition at the moment. The percipient, at the time a\nschoolboy at a boarding school, wrote in August 1898 :\n(L. 1109.)\nOn Sunday night, March 20th, 1898, I had gone to bed\nas usual (about 9.30 or 10). I could not sleep and began\nthinking of home and especially of mother. My bed\nwas so placed that I could see the staircase, and, after\na bit, to my surprise, I heard someone coming up the\nstairs. It flashed into my mind that it was mother,\nand so it proved to be. She was dressed in a black\ndress that I had never seen before, and had on her pink\nshawl and gold chain, and as she came into the room her\n\f334 Mrs. Henry Sidgivich. [paet\nshoes creaked ; in fact, they did so all the time. I did\nnot feel at all frightened but tried to get out of bed\nto go to her, but something held me back. She went\nto the bed before mine, where my chum sleeps, and bent\nover him and looked at him. Then she came to me and\nkissed me ;\nI tried to kiss her but could not. Then she\ndisappeared and .seemed to vanish in a mist ; the face\nwas the last thing I saw. I am quite sure that I was\nawake, and saw every object in the room when she was\n<^here. (Signed) J. P. Challacombe.\nThe next statement, with which the above was enclosed, is\nfrom Mrs. Challacombe, the lad's mother.\n42, Richmond Road, Montpelier, Bristol.\nThis is Jack's statement.\nNow the queer part is that, at the time, I was visiting\na cousin in Wales, and Jack knew nothing about it.\nThe evening he speaks of I had returned home, and had\nremoved all my walking things with the exception of my\nboots, dress and watch-chain. My dress Jack had never\nseen, and I am not in the habit of wearing my chain\noutside my dress. As for the boots they were a pair I\nhad not worn for years, because they were m the habit\nof creaking.\nI went to the door to wait for my cousin, who was a\nlong time saying ''good night\" to a friend, and while\nthere I was thinking deeply of Jack as I had not received\nhis morning letter. We made an agreement when he\nwert to boarding school that we would think of one\nanother every night and also say \"good night.\"\n(Signed) Annie E. Challacombe.\nAugust, 1898.\nIn reply to further enquiries, Master Challacombe writes\nthus :\nAugust 27th, 1898.\nI had never had any psychical experience before, and\nmother has never experienced anything of the kind either.\nAs to the door of the bedroom being open, I do not\n\fLXXXVI.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 335\nknow anything about that. It is situated at the bottom\nof the stairs, so practically there is no door to the bed-\nroom. Most probably it was shut, but I did not hear\nit open. As to the date, I remember it was a Smiday\nevening. I wrote home to mother the following Saturday,\nand she thought it was a strange coincidence, as she was\naway, and the date was March 20th. When I was home at\nEaster she questioned me about it. J. P. Challacombe.\nThe points of coincidence here are, first, that the sup-\nposed agent was specially thinking of her son, but this\nshe tried to do every evening. Secondly, she was in fact,\nas in the apparition, wearing a dress her son had never\nseen, her gold watch-chain outside her dress, which was\nunusual, and a pair of creaking boots. Are these points\nsufficient to show that the mother's mind was concerned\nin the son's experience ?\nThe next case (L. 1200, Journal, Vol. XVI., p. 205)\u2014\na waking hallucination affecting two senses, sight and\nhearing\u2014came to us from Mr. H. Arthur Smith, to whom\nall the witnesses concerned were intimately known. The\npercipient, Mr. Laurence Orchard, was in London on\nChristmas Day, 1913. His mother, whose phantasm he\nsaw, was away from home, staying with another son\nin Canada. The percipient writes :\n(1200.)\nDecember 29th, 1913.\nOn Christmas Day at 12.50 p.m. I was in the bathroom,\nwhen I heard footsteps and doors being opened and\nclosed quite distinctly, and as I was the only one in the\nhouse it surprised me, so [I] opened the door and looked\nout, and to my astonishment I saw Mother (or thought I\ndid) in a black dress at her bedroom door and her arms\nfull of parcels. I made an exclamation\n\u2014\" Mother,\" I\nthink\u2014and I think there was some sort of response, but\nI forget now, and then all disappeared suddenly. T\nthen left the house, and told Gerty what a vision I had\nhad, when I saw her at E 's.\n\f336 Mrs. He7iry Sidgwick.\nI suppose Mother having been so much in all our\nminds, and no doubt we in hers, made me see \" things,\"\nbut it was the noise that attracted my notice first.\n\"E.\" was a married sister, whose family gathermg, in\nanother part of London, they joined on Christmas Day.\nMiss Gertrude Orchard gives a very full account of her\nbrother's report of his experience to her on the same\nafternoon, which I do not reproduce here. She adds :\n\" It was a wonderful experience, and startled him very\nmuch, as it did me when he told me ; in fact, I can't\nget it out of my mind. It haunts me night and day\n;\nbut each day, now, I feel happier about it, as [my\nbrother] G would surely have cabled by this time\nif anything serious had happened. ...\"\nEnquiries were made of Mrs. Orchard, the percipient's\nmother, as to her doings on that day. It is clear from\nher replies printed in the Journal that she was thinking\nvery much and in a special manner of the members\nof her family in England, and there may have been\na telepathic impulse from her in consequence. But,\non the other hand, sensory hallucinations can occur\nwithout any discoverable external impulse, and there was\napparently nothing significant in the appearance, and\nnothing which the percipient could not have contributed\nfrom his own mind.\nA somewhat similar case is the following (L. 896, Jonr-\nnal, Vol. v., p. 174), but the impression was tactile. It\nwas sent by the same Professor Thomas Davidson, who\ncontributed one of the letter cases (see above, p. 310).\nThe percipient, Mr. Alfred Hicks, an Englishman living\nat New York, writes on March 31st, 1889 :\n(L. 896.)\nThere has always been a keen sympathy, and a great\ndeal of affection existing between my mother and myself,\n\fLXXXvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 337\nand early in February I sent over a letter to England to\nbe given to her on her birthday, the 22nd of February.\nI was staying at the time at 64, East llth-street,\nN.Y. city. Very early in the morning of that day I\nwas awakened from my sleep, and seemed to feel quite\ndistinctly my mother's arms folded romid me. I, too,\nseemed to have clasped her in my arms, and her head\nwas resting on my shoulder. I seemed to be saying\nsomething to her in what I should judge was Itahan,\nbut as I do not know that language I can only give it\nphonetically. [There is no explanation of this imitation\nItaUan.]\nI was so impressed with the whole occurrence that I\narose and looked at the time. It was just 3.30 a.m.\nI was quite awake when this seemed to occur, and did not\nsleep agaia that morning, but lay awake thinking it over.\n]\\Ir. Hicks calculated that his dream in America occurred\njust about the time his mother would receive his birthday\nletter, at which moment she would of course think vividly\nof him. The approach of the birthday would also, how-\never, make him think specially of her and perhaps dream\nof her. His experience was very likely the continuation\nof a dream,\nA case of the comparatively rare phenomenon of an\napparition speaking is L. 1073, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 253.\nIt was carefully recorded within two days of its occurrence\nby the percipient, Mr. E. White, an old gentleman of\neighty-seven. He saw by his bed his landlady, with\nwhom he had lodged for twelve years, and who habitually\ncalled him in the morning ; but instead of her usual\nremark she said, \" This is a bad day for you.\" She then\nmoved towards the door, and he did not stop her to ask\nwhat she meant. By his watch, which he looked at, it\nwas 2.10 a.m. He found afterwards that his landlady\nwas seriously iU during the night with influenza and had\neven thought she was going to die. It seems quite\ncertain that she had not left her bed during the night,\nand she was confined to bed for several days. Neither\n\f338 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

Soren Pederson, Pastor of the Scandinavian\nChurch of Melbourne, Austraha, presents a rather unusual\ntype of hallucination. He writes :\n(L. 950.)\nJanuary 12th, 1892.\nI saw a very dear friend, about 70 years old, living\nin Christiania, at 7 o'clock in the afternoon, when walking\nabout a year ago with some Austrahan friends in one of\nthe streets of Melbourne. I saw his face as in prayer,\nand quite suddenly and near, so I did almost touch him.\nI was talking of singing with my friends, as we were\ngoing to practice at the time. I was quite well and have\nnever had hallucinations or anything lilie this before or\nlater. It was daylight and quite full of passers-by and\nvehicles, etc., in the street.\nI had not seen him since a year before, but it struck\nme so vividly that I wrote home to Christiania, Norway,\nasking what did friend G. at that hour (subtracting the\n9 hours we are before here in Melbourne) and got the\nanswer :\n\" Praying very intensely for you and your mission\nin Melbourne.\"\nTwo [other persons were present] who saw nothing and\nwere quite outside the whole incident.\nI put this among ambiguous cases because I do not\nthink the evidence for the coincidence, which is given\nin the Journal, quite conclusive. Mr. Pederson's letter\nto his parents had been lost, and so had Mr. G.'s notes\nfixing the date of what seems to have been a kind of\nprayer meeting among a few friends. Still some pains\nwere taken at the time to estabhsh the fact of the\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 339\ncoincidence ; and the praying seems to have been some-\nthing special, not an everyday occurrence. The pro-\nbabihty is, I think, that this was a genuine case of\ntelepathy.\nIn another case (L. 962, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 165) the\ncoincidence does not seem, on the face of it, to be so\nmarked. A gentleman, Mr. L. S. M. Munro, sitting at\nhis writing table in a room looking out on a public\nthoroughfare, saw the face of a child friend looking in at\nthe window. No real person was there, nor apparently\ncould have been. He wrote at once to the child, and\nheard from her and her mother that just about the time\nof the apparition they had been having a conversation\nabout him, which was unusual. First-hand evidence from\nthem is not forthcoming.\nIn another case (L. 1198, Journal, Vol. XVI., p. 149),\nwhich must, I think, be regarded as ambiguous, the\npercipient's experience seems to have been of the nature\nof a vision (see above, pp. 243, 248), though it is not quite\neasy to understand from the description what it exactly\nwas, or what was the relation of the phantasm to sur-\nrounding objects. The percipient says : \"I foimd myself\nsitting up in bed and lighting the candle. And then\nI saw an old woman in bed and I was quite conscious\nthat she was dying.\" The face was clearly seen but not\nrecognised. It was afterwards learnt that an old friend\nof the percipient's hostess, not known to the percipient,\nwas very ill at the time. Sickness and pain had set in\nthat night and she died less than thirty-six hours later.\nWhen the vision occurred her illness was unknown to\nanyone in the house where the percipient was, and if\nthere was telepathy it must, it would seem, have been of\nan indirect kind, coming through the non-perceptive\nhostess to the percipient.\nThe next case (L. 1156, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 27) is\ninteresting as an apparition, but ambiguous from the\ntelepathic point of view, for the supposed agent's contem-\nporary appearance and occupation was ordinary enough\n\f340 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nfor the correspondence with the apparition to be plausibly\nattributed to chance, and there is no evidence that her\nmind was at the time in any way directed to the per-\ncipient. The interest of the case lies in the movement,\nthe persistence, and the mode of disappearance of the\napparition, and in the fact that the dog may have been\na co-percipient. He certainly either simultaneously saw\nsomething or was affected as if he had by the emotion\nand behaviour of the percipient. The case was received\nthrough Mr. Andrew Lang, the percipient, Miss B. H.\nGrieve, being his niece. She wrote the following account\nin a letter to her uncle :\n(L. 1156.)\nSkelfhill, Hawick, N.B., August 8th, 1906.\n... I have been staying here since August 4th. On\nMonday, 6th, I went up the Pen and for the first time in\nmy life saw a '\nghost !\n'\nTurk, the old Dandie Dinmont,\nwas with me ; and Mrs. R., a Swiss lady also staying\nhere, had said she would go too, but it was hot, and in\nthe end she stayed at home. Turk and I went very\nslowly, taking many rests on account of his short legs\nand shorter breath, and the grass and brackens were long\nand strong. Our last stop was where the Pen suddenly\ntakes up for its rocky top very steeply. I sat with my\nback against the dyke facing the steep part, and Turk\nlay panting beside me. I was thinking of a beautiful\ncleckitig of grouse we had just disturbed\u2014the two parent\nbirds and five yoang ones clapped about four yards from\nus. Turk did not see them at first and I stood perfectly\nstill watching, they were so pretty. Then Turk winded\nthem and threw up his head, and of course with the\nmovement the birds were off like a whirlwind. This\njust to show you my train of thought. Quite suddenly\nI saw coming along at right angles to me, a friend. Dr.\nH., who crossed with me May, 1905, from America. She\nwas in a rather short dark blue skirt, white cotton blouse,\nno hat, and a stick in her hand\u2014and later, I noticed a\ntail of hair beginning to '\ncome down.' I had heard\nabout fortnight ago that she had landed in England from\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 341\nAmerica and was to sail back Sept. 12, and that she was\ngoing to her home in Cornwall for part of the time-\nbut when I did not know. I was so surprised I did not\nsay anything for a second or two till Turk began to growl.\nThen I jumped up exclaiming '\nDr. H. !\n'\nShe looked\nstraight at me, but when I spoke, turned and went on\ndown the hill\u2014following her own direction and the one\nfrom which I had come. I followed quickly to catch\nher up, feeling rather queer because she did not speak,\nand \/ knew she had seen me ! Turk barked and growled\nthe whole time, but kept close in to my heels and would\nnot run out as he usually does at strange people or\nstrange dogs. His hair was all on end and his taU\nhooked over his back, as stiff as a poker. I almost\ncaught up Dr. H., and was just going to put out my\nhand to touch her shoulder, vs^hen a big bumble bee\nwhirled between us and flew right through Dr. H. and she\ndisappeared.\nI certainly did feel queer after that\u2014I was so very sure\nit was she and it was such a shock to find there was\nnothing. Had it not been for Turk I should have doubted\nmy senses ; but he was so immistakably disturbed and\nangry. I swear I am well\u2014never was better, and have\nhad nothing stronger to drink than water for over a year.\nThe exact moment of the apparition I cannot quite give\nyou, but it was 6.5 p.m. when I sat down, and 6.15 per-\nhaps a minute or even two minutes after it had disappeared.\nI had a pencil and envelope in my pocket and made a\nrough note of it there on the top of the Pen, and wrote\nit out in detail when I got down here to the house. Of\ncourse I have written (yesterday) to Dr. H. to know\nwhatever she was doing at that date and hour, and will let\nyou know her reply\u2014probably bathing at Tmtagel ! . . .\nMiss Grieve -wTote later :\nSeptember 23rd, 1906.\nI was sitting when I first saw the figure, so also was\nTurk, though he collected his wits quicker than I, for he\nbarked before I spoke.

She said on that day and hour she\nwas coming down their hill at Tintagel in the clothes I\ndescribed, but with a wet bathing gown on her arm,\nwhich I did not see.\nThe statement in the last sentence is confirmed by\nDr. H.'s sister.\nThe percipient in this case was the same Miss Grieve\nwho shared in the collective crystal vision described above,\np. 48. She afterwards, in 1908, had a curious experience\nof seeing a ghostly pointing hand in a church at Stavanger,\nher account of which is given in an article by Mr. Andrew\nLang in the Journal, Vol. XIV., p.\n65.i The experience\ntallied curiously with a story of a pointing ghost in the\nsame church which she subsequently found in Norwegian\nByways by C. W. Wood, but she had no recollection\nwhatever of ever having seen or heard the story before.\nThere are three cases which on the face of them may\nhave been collective hallucinations caused telepathically\nfrom outside, but in which there is evidential weakness\nboth concerning the agency and the percipiency. In the\nfirst (L. 844, Jowrnal, Vol. IV., p. 289), if there was an\nagent, it was a dog. Mrs. Beauchamp writes to a friend :\n(L. 844.)\nLast night\u2014Megatherium [a small Indian dog] sleeping\nwith [my daughter]\u2014I woke, hearing him run roimd my\nbedroom. I Imow his step so well. [My husband] woke\ntoo. I said \"Listen.\" He said, \"It is Meg.\" We\nlighted a candle, looked well, there was nothing and the\ndoor was shut. Then I had a feeling something was\nwrong with the dog\u2014it came into my head he had died\nat this minute, and I looked for my watch to see the\ntime, and then I thought I mxLst go up and see about\nhim. It was so cold, and it seemed so silly, and while\nI was thinking I fell asleep. It must have been some\n1 In tliis article Mr. Lang discusses the dog's share in the above\ncase, and gives another account of a dog sharing in a hallucination,\nbut it had happened six years previously,\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 343\nlittle time after, someone laiocked at the door, and it\nwas [my daughter] in agony. \" Oh ! mamma, Meg is\ndying.\" We flew upstairs. He was lying on his side\nhke dead\u2014his legs stretched straight out hke a dead\nthing's. [My husband] picked him up, and for a while\ncouldn't see what was wrong, for he was not dead. Then\nwe foimd he had nearly strangled himself\u2014got the strap\nof his coat somewhat from imder his stomach and round\nhis neck. He sorr revived and recovered when we got\nit off, and he could breathe freely.\nAsked some months later, Colonel Beauchamp said he\nhad paid so little attention to the circumstance at the\ntime that he could not undertake to write an independent\naccount. It is not possible to ascertain whether the\ndog's distress had begun at the time of Mrs. Beauchamp's\nexperience. Even therefore, if it is certain that no real\nsound was mistaken for the patter of the dog, the coin-\ncidence must remain doubtful.\nIn another auditory case (G. 277, Journal, Vol. XII.,\np. 54) a strong impression was evidently made on the\ntwo percipients, but the hallucinatory nature of the\nsound\n\u2014\n\" a tremendous bang \" of an alarming character\non the door of the room\u2014is from the nature of the case\nsomewhat open to doubt ; and the relation between it\nand an external event\u2014^the unknown and unexpected death\nsome twenty-four hours ^ before of the father of a boy in\nthe house, but not in the room\u2014is highly conjectural.\nThe third case (L. 1190, Journal, Vol. XV., p. 289) was\nvisual. A hospital patient told the nurse in the morning\nthat he had seen the matron come into the ward in the\nnight, look at the fire and go out again, and, when\nappealed to, a second patient confirmed this. There could\nhardly be a mistake of identity, as the matron's uniform\nwas markedly unlike that of the nurses. The matron was\n^ The death occurred in India, and the time correction seems to have\nbeen made the wrong way in the Journal, where it is stated that the\ninterval between death and the percipient's experience was about\nthirteen hours.\n\f344 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nin bed at the time. It was during the coal strike of\n1912, and the account came to us through the matron,\nwho was interested in it because it seemed to reflect the\nanxious thought about how to save fuel with which . her\nmind was occupied when she went to bed. The coin-\ncidence cannot be regarded as a well-marked one, and\nmoreover the percipients had been lost sight of and the\naccount of their experience comes from the nurse to whom\nthey spoke, and is not therefore at first hand.\nI come now to ambiguous cases where the difficulty is\nto find the agent. The first case I will give (L. 1212,\nJournal, Vol. XVIII., p. 51) seems to me a very in-\nteresting one. The experience of the percipient, Dr.\nGeorge Johnston, was a dream or vision between waking\nand sleeping. For the reasons he gives it is, I think,\ndifficult to doubt that the certainty of his son being dead\nwhich came to him through his experience was due to a\nsupernormal communication. If this communication came\nfrom his son, the case does not properly belong to this\npaper, as the interval between death and phantasm\nexceeds the twelve hours' limit adopted. On this hypo-\nthesis, however, it is difficult to explain the complicated\nsymbolism, without any suggestion of direct communication\nfrom the son, through which the fact of his death was\nexpressed. On the other hand, if we suppose the persons\nlooking over the kit to be the agents, how was the\ntelepathic link with the percipient, whose very existence\nwas probably unknown to them, brought about ? Is it\npossible that there was some land of combined agency\ninvolving the dead man and others ? There is no means\nof knowing, and we can only record the case as part of\nthe whole evidence to be considered. Dr. Johnston writes :\n(L. 1212.)\n23, Seymour Street, Portman Square, W.,\nMarch 15, 1917.\nMy son, Lieut. Alec Leith Johnston, of the 1st King's\nShropshire L.I., was kiUed at daybreak on Saturday,\nApril 22nd, 1916.\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 345\nAt daybreak on the next morning, Easter Sunday,\naboiit 24 hours after his death took place, when I was\nlying half awake and half asleep, I had the vision or\ndream, an account of which follows.\nI saw two soldiers in Idiaki standing beside a pile of\nclothing and accoutrements which, in some way, I knew\nto be Alec's, and my first feehng was one of anger and\nannoj^ance that they should be meddlitag with his things,\nfor they were apparently looking through them and\narranging them. Then one of them took up a khaki\nshirt which was wrapped round something so as to form\na Idnd of roll. He took hold of one end of it and let\nthe rest drop so that it miroUed itself and a pair of\nheavy, extremely muddy boots fell out and banged heavily\non the floor, and something else fell which made a metaUic\njingle. I thought \" That is his revolver,\" but im-\nmediately afterwards thought \" No, it is too light to be\nhis revolver, which would have made more of a clang.\"\nAs these things fell out on to the floor the two men\nlaughed, but a sad wistful kind of laugh with no semblance\nof mirth in it. And then the words\n'\n' Alec is dead and\nthey are going through his kit,\" were most clearly borne\nin upon my mind. They were not spoken and I heard\nno voice, but they were just as clear as if I had done so.\nAnd then I became fully awake with these words repeating\nthemselves in my mind and with the fullest conviction\nof their truth which I never lost. I suppose I still tried\nto persuade myself that it might not be true, but it was\nuseless and when the official telegram arrived it only\nconfirmed what I already knew.\nGeoege Johnston.\nIn a letter of the same date, March 15, 1917, Dr. Johnston\nadds the following comments on his statement\n:\n. . . Two points have to be borne in mind in estimating\nthe importance of the dream as an intimation of my\nson's death and not as a mere coincidence.\n(1) He went out to the front in October, 1914, and was\nthere continuously (with three short leaves) until his\n\f346 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\ndeath on April 22nd, 1916\u2014Easter Saturday. During\nthese eighteen months I never had any dream or any\nimpression of his being in serious danger, although I\noften knew that he was in the midst of hard fighting\nand he was wounded in three places in August, 1915,\nat Hooge.\n(2) At the time when I had the dream I was under\nthe impression that his battalion was resting and that they\nwould not be in the fighting hne until the middle of the\nweek. Hence my mind was quite easy about him and I\nwas not feeUng at aU anxious. In the ordinary course of\nevents they were not due in the trenches mitil the Wednes-\nday, but they were unexpectedly called upon on the\nevening of Good Friday to move up at once to recapture\na trench which had been taken by the Germans some\ndays before. It was after having accomplished this, and\nwhilst the position was being consolidated, that he was\nkiUed.\nI have never in my hfe had any dream so vivid as\nthis one was, and when I saw in the Sunday papers\nthat his battahon had accomphshed this \" fine feat,\" as\nthey caUed it, I had no doubt whatever that my boy\nwas dead. When the official telegram came on the\nWednesday I felt that it was hardly necessary to open\nit. . . .\nI shall always think (as a nephew does to whom I\ntold my dream on the Simday afternoon), that this vision\nwas Alec's way of letting me know what had happened.\nA minor point that may be worth noticing is that\nwhen I heard the metalhc clink when the shirt unrolled\nand let its contents faU on the floor, I at first thought\n\" That is his revolver,\" but then immediately thought the\nnoise was too \" jingly \" to be made by the fall of a\nheavy service Colt such as he had. When his things\ncame home, however, I found that instead of having a\nColt he had a hght French automatic pistol which, in\nfalling, would have made exactly such a sound as I\nheard.\nI do not suppose that his kit was actually being gone\nthrough at the time of my dream, nor do I think that\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 347\nit makes much difference whether it were so or not.\nBut the regimental surgeon (since killed hunself) who\ncame to see me early in June told me that he beheved\nthat they really were going through Alec's things about\nthe time of my dream.

I\ndo this m order to show the conditions under which the\nattack was made, especially as to mud.\nOne does not want to read too much into such an\nexperience, but I have often thought that what I saw\nhad a certain amount of symbohsm in it. The fact\nthat the boots which feU out of the roUed-up shirt were\nso exceedingly muddy, and that the other thmg which\ndropped out was, as I at first thought, his revolver,\npomt to the terribly muddy conditions of the attack and\nto the fact that it was an attack, for otherwise the revolver\nAvould not have been carried.

(P. 269, p. 144, and L. 1127, p. 147).\nA very odd case of this clairvoyant kind (L. 1119,\nJournal, Vol. IX., p. 227) I will describe briefly. It\ncame to us from Mrs. E. Thompson, who, however, only\nknew the percipient, a Mrs. Hodgson of Shepherd's Bush,\nslightly. The account, written by Mrs. Thompson and\nsigned by Mrs. Hodgson and her daughter, is dated\nJune 12th, 1899, and relates to a dream in October, 1897.\nA burglary had occurred at Mrs. Hodgson's house on\nSeptember 30tli, 1897, and among other things a smaU\npapier-mache box which she valued had been taken.\nAbout a week later she dreamed she went into the coal\nceUar and found it hidden amongst the fine coal. She\ntold her daughter of the dream the next morning, but it\nseemed so absurd that no search was made. In August,\n1898, Mr. Hodgson went into the cellar to see how much\ncoal there was, and found amongst the fine coal the lost\nbox wrapped in a newspaper of the date of the burglary.\nHad somebody played a trick ? Or had Mrs. Hodgson\nsubconsciously noticed the box in its hiding place before\nher dream ? Or what had happened ? We know too\nlittle of the circumstances to judge.\nThe following case (M.Cl. 87, Journal; Vol. VI., p. 264)\nwhich came to us through the American Branch, if it was\nnot merely a remarkable coincidence, takes us from\nmatters of purely private concern to an event which was\nalso, one may say, one of public interest. But this does\nnot seem to help us to find the agent, or to explain the\nnature of the supernormal perception. The account to be\n\f352 Mrs. Henry Siclgioich,.

The following statement\nappeared in a Coldwater newspaper of March 16, 1892,\nand was afterwards signed as correct by Mr. S. P.\nWilliams :\nS. P. Williams, a large stockholder in the Coldwater National\nBank, lives at Lima, Lid. [thirty miles distant from Cold-\nwater]. While asleep at his home during the night upon\nwhich the bank was robbed, he awoke under the impression\nthat he had been startled by a heavy explosion. So vivid\nwas the impression left that he got up, dressed himself, and\nwallced all through the business portion of Lima lookiiig for\nevidences of a big explosion. Of course he fomid none, and\nlater ascertained that he awoke at the same time at which\nthe vault in the Coldwater bank was blown open.\nMembers of Mr. Williams's family testify that he told\nthem of his impression before the news of the explosion\ncame.\nThere remain cases under this head furnished by two\npercipients\u2014each of whom had on two occasions dreams\nconcerning public events in the war without apparently\nany traceable private reason. First (L. 1201, Journal,\nVol. XVI., p. 306) Miss \" Ann Jones \" (pseudonym), who\nhas sent us other telepathic experiences (see above,\npp. 317, 330), on August 6th, 1914, from 8.30 p.m. to 9,\nand again on Sept. 5th, 1914, from 2.30 p.m. to 7, fell\ninto a heavy swoon-like state between sleeping and waking\nunlike anything she had experienced before. During this\nshe had each time a dream or impression of a sinking\n\fLxxxvi.] Spontaneous Cases : Impression Externalised. 353\nship. The notes in her diary run \" Had a bad dream of\na ship sunk,\" \" Had a dreadful drowning sleep,\" for the\ntwo dates respectively ; and friends testify that she told\nthem she had dreamt of a sinking ship. On August 6th\nH.M.S. Amphion struck a mine and foundered at 7.30\na.m.\u2014that is, about thirteen hours before Miss Jones'\ndream. This was announced by the Admiralty that\nevening, but not known to Miss Jones or her friends.\nOn September 5th, at 4.30 p.m., H.M.S. Pathfinder struck\na mine and foundered very rapidly. This was probably\nbefore or about the time of Miss Jones' dream. These\ntwo disasters were, I understand, the only two which had\nbefallen the British fleet in the war up to that date.\nThe heavy sleep seems rather to have been the oppor-\ntunity for the impression to emerge than itself caused by\nthe impression, for it began long after the disaster on\nAugust 6th and two hours before it on Sept. 5th. At the\nsame time it is odd that this peculiar physical condition\nshould, so far as we know, have occurred on these\noccasions only.\nIn the other case (L 1214, Journal, Vol. XVIII., p. 92)\nMiss M. S. Wilkinson on two occasions (Aug. 21-22\/17 and\nSept. 2-3\/17) dreamt vividly of an air-raid on a night\nwhen oiae actually took place at a distance, but when\nthere was no special reason to expect one. At the same\ntime, air-raids were fairly frequent, so that the coincidence\ndoes not seem very striking, and I only mention this case\nfor completeness.\n\f354 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nCHAPTER IV.\nCollective and Reciprocal Cases without Evidence\nOF ANY Agency external to the Percipient.\n\u00a7 1. Similar and Simultaneous Dreams.\nIn this final chapter I have put together cases in which\ntwo or more persons have at the same time spontaneous\npsychical experiences\u2014either hallucinations or dreams\n\u2014\nwhich seem to be related to one another, but where no\nevidence of any agency outside the two percipients exists.^\nWhen this happens\u2014when two persons have nearly similar\ndreams or hallucinations without traceable external cause,\nnormal or supernormal\u2014it can hardly be attributed to\nchance, and we seem driven to suppose that they have\ninfluenced each other either by suggestion through the\nsenses, or telepathically\u2014one being agent and the other\npercipient ; or both acting in both capacities so that the\ntelepathic influence is mutual.\nIn most of the cases we have to examine, the two\npersons concerned were in the same room, or otherwise\nnear each other, which makes it specially important to\nconsider whether they can have influenced each other\nthrough the senses. In similar and simultaneous dreams,\nfor instance\u2014which I propose to take flrst\u2014it does not\n1 There are collective cases, it will be remembered, not fulfilling\nthese conditions. A collective crystal vision, not spontaneous, has\nbeen given in Chapter I. (L. 1126, p. 48). And collective cases where\nmore or less evidence of external agency is adduced have been discussed\nunder their appropriate heads. They are : Simultaneous dreams,\nL. 1210, p. 268, L. 1138, p. 271 ; Collective apparitions, L. 1159, p. 194,\nL. 1190, p. 343 ; Non-vocal sounds collectively heard, L. 1141, p. 242,\nL 1151, p. 242, L. 844, p. 342, G. 277, p. 343.\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 355\nseem impossible that in some cases where the dreamers\nare sleeping together and the element common to the two\ndreams is sufficiently simple, a sound or movement made\nby one dreamer might suggest the dream to the other.\nAnd, of course, in any case where suggestion through\nthe senses can be regarded as an adequate cause for the\nsimilaritj^ of two dreams or hallucinations, no room is left\nfor evidence of telepathy, even if telepathy has occurred.\nWhether suggestion through the senses seems a likely\ncause in any of the dreams that follow I must leave the\nreader to judge.\nThe first case (L. 835, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 220) came\nfrom Mr. and Mrs. H., who do not wish their names to\nbe published. The dreams took place in July, 1887, and\nthe account was sent to us in August.\n(L. 835.) '\nI dreamt that I was walking in Richmond Park with\nmy husband and Mr. J. I saw notices put on several\ntrees to the effect that \" In consequence of the Jubilee\nLady R. wUl give a garden party on the 24th of Jime.\"\nI remarked to my husband that I hoped she would invite\nus. My husband said that he hoped she would not do\nso, as it would be extremely difficult to get back to town.\nMr. J. then said, \" Oh, I wUl manage that for you,\"\nand struck a blade of grass with his stick, upon which\na carriage drove ujd. I then awoke and my husband\nsaid, \" I have had such a vivid dream. I dreamt we\nwere walking in Richmond Park, and I was told that\nLady R. was going to have a party. We were invited,\nand I was very much troubled in my mind as to how we\nshould get home, as the party was at 10, and the last\ntrain went at 11, when my friend J., who was walking\nwith us, said, '\nOh, I will manage that for yoi^.'\n\"\n(Signed) M. H. and J. B. H.\nIn the next case (L. 965, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 169),\nwhich came through the American Branch, the coincidence\nis less striking, because the main subject of the dreams\n\f356 Mrs. Henry Sidgioick. [part\nwas a likely one to arise in the minds of both dreamers.\nMoreover, the records were made about two years after\nthe dreams. I wiU give the case briefly, omitting corro-\nboration and the second dreamer's account.\n(L. 965.)\nMr. Armstrong Avrites to Dr. Hodgson :\nLehma^tn's, La., March 20th, 1893.\nI was staying at the house of a young friend of mine,\nwho at the time was infatuated with a young lady in\nthe neighbourhood. His joarents, as well as myself, were\nopposed to the alliance, and our conversation would often\ncentre on the subject. One night I dreamed that he was\ndetermined to marry the girl. Everything was prepared,\nand I remember hurrying off to the place where the\nceremony was to take place. I even forgot to jiut on\nmy coat. I found him in a back room of the house,\nwhere I also saw his father, vainly trying to change his\nmind. I caUed my young friend to the side, and talked\nto him hke a Dutch imcle, trying to persuade him out\nof the notion. Then I left the scene, and went home in\ndisgust. Now, we were sleepmg in the same room and\nin the same bed, and after awaking ua the morning, and\nbefore telling him of my dream, I asked what he had\nbeen dreaming about. He, half smilingly, answered,\n\" Why, I dreamt that I was about to get married, when\nyou came rushmg in the house, in shirt-sleeves, and\ninsisted that the ceremony must not go on.\"\nThe unlikely item of the shirt-sleeves in both dreams\nmakes it probable that they were not independent. Other-\nwise they were not quite identical.\nThe next two cases also came to us through the Ameri-\ncan Branch. In the first (L. 1162, Journal, Vol. XIII.,\np. 119) we have again different dreams, with an important\ncommon element, which in this case is the central point\nof the dreams, namely, the drowning and rescue.\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Recijn'ocal Cases. 357\n(L. 1162.)\nJune I8lh, 1899.\nNoticing your address in the N.Y. Sunday Journal of\neven date, I write to tell you of an instance of telepathy\nin which, as an additional straw, your Society may find\ninterest.\nLi the summer of '97, one night while sleeping I\ndreamed that I was in an old, abandoned and ruined\nsaw-mill, which was built on timbers out over a river.\nThe plank floor was gone except for now and then a\nplank, and the water, about eight feet below, looked\nblack, stagnant and slimy. There were just enough\nplanks and timbers left to cause a \" creepy,\" shadowy\ndarkness to prevail below. There were two ladies came\nto look at the place, and being afraid to trust the planks\nfor footing, I took one on each arm, and was proceeding\nout to the further end of the ruin, over the water to\nwhere the old saw was, when something white glimmering\nin the water below through the dusk attracted my atten-\ntion, and I saw it to be the face of my wife, Mrs. D.,\njust showing above the water, with her large eyes looking\ninto mine, but without a motion or sound. I immediately\njumped into the water and caught her round the shoulders\nand neck to support her, and at that instant was roused\nfrom sleep by a smothered cry from Mrs. D. at my side.\nIntuitivelj'^ I knew how matters were and asked her\n(after shaking her to awaken her) what she had dreamed\nto frighten her.\nShe said that she was dreaming that she was in the\nwater drowning and was trying to reach up her arms to\nhelp herself, and cried out as I heard her. . . .\nMrs. D. wrote to Dr. Hodgson :\nJune 22nd, 1899.\nIn reply to your letter of the 20th to Mr. Davis, relating\nto our \" dreams,\" I will relate my exj^erience as perfectly\nas possible.\nThe first sensation I remember in my dream was of\nfinding m3^self sinking in a pool, a large pool, or pond\n\f358 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

He informed his wife of this\nat the time, and they heard later the same day that the\nlady had died about 24 hours before the impression occurred.\nThey knew, however, that she had been seriously ill, though\nit was believed that she was then recovering.\nIn the next case (L. 1161, Journal, Vol. XIII., p. 118),\nsent to Dr. Hodgson by Dr. M. L. Holbrook, the dreams\nseem to have been identical as far as they both went.\nThe following account of them was given by Mr. E. J. to\nhis brother, Mr. G. J., an Associate of the American\nBranch :\n(L. 1161.)\nJanuary 6, 1907.\nMy bed stands Avith the head against the west waU of\nthe room, head next the door. Annie's bed stands\ndirectly opposite, head against the east wall, with a\nspace of about six feet between them.\nI dreamed on Friday night [January 4th] that mother\ncame into the room, passed beside my bed, looked at me\nand went to the foot of Annie's bed. The impression\nwas so strong that it awoke me.\nI told my dream at breakfast and Annie remarked,\n\" How queer that is ; for I dreamed last night that your\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 359\nmother came into the room, leant over the foot of my\nbed, with her arms crossed just as she always used to\nstand and talk when I was sick. She said that Fred\ntold her that I did not realise how sick my mother was,\nand that she would not live three months, and that\nstartled me so that I woke up.\"\nAbout six weeks later Mr. E. J. sent a substantially similar\naccount direct to Dr. Hodgson, and about this Mrs. J.'s\nsecretary wrote on March 1, 1901 :\nIn reply to your letter of Feb. 25, Mrs. J. directs me\nto say that she has nothing to add to or change to\nmake in the statement made by Mr. J.\nAs regards the content of the dreams Mr. J.'s mother had\ndied in 1883 and his brother Fred, whom his wife had never\nknown, in 1858. Mrs. J.'s mother was aged 83 aivd had\nbeen expected to die at almost any time during the previous\nyear, though at the moment she was better. She did actually\ndie six months later on June 12th, 1901.\nThere is in our collection one case which may con-\nveniently come in here (L. 1181, Journal, Vol. XIV., p. 380),\nin which one percipient sees an apparition, while the other,\na child of 2| sleeping in the same room, has a vivid\ndream about the same person. It was sent to us by\nMr. J. H. Clapham of King's College, Cambridge, who, in\nsending us Mrs. Clapham's account of the incident, says :\n(L. 1181.)\nIts maiii interest is that my appearance had no\nsignificance. I was comfortably asleep in a Swiss inn.\nFortunately my diary has a note of the excellent night\nthat I spent. . . .\nMrs. Clapham wrote to her husband :\n65, Bateman Street,\nCambridge, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 1910.\nWhat were you doing this morning between 5 a.m. and\n5,15 ? Such a strange thing happened. To the best of\n\f360 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nmy belief I was awake, for I had just been putting some\nlotion on the restless [Alison] and heard 5 o'clock strike.\nI turned round to face the wuidow, to try and get off\nto sleep, and there were you standing by the bed looking\ndown on me. I said, \" Jolm, what are you doing here ?\n\"\nbut you said nothing, and walldng round the bed you\nbent over Alison's cot and looked at her, and she stirred\nrestlessly in her sleep and said, \" Daddy, Daddy, I can't\n'member.\" Then you came round and looked at me\nagain, and by that time I was terrified, for I thought\nsomething must have happened to you. I said, \" What\nhave you come for ?\n\" and tried to touch you, but you\nretreated towards the window and disappeared. At that\nmoment AUson woke and popped her head over her cot.\nI gave her her biscuit and looked at the clock ; it was\n5.15. I comforted myseK by reflecting that you could\nhardly have begim to climb yet, but I haven't felt com-\nfortable aU day. When Ahson came into my bed, she\nsaid, \" Daddy was mowing the grass when I waked up.\" |\nI told her you were away in Switzerland and not mowing I\nthe grass, but she said, \" I k7iow he was mowing the\ngrass, 'cause I seed him.\" And again at brealdast, in\nthe middle of demanding sugar, she suddenly said, \" I\nknow Daddy was mowing, I seed him doing it when I\nwaked up.\" So if I was dreaming, she must also have j\nbeen dreaming of you at the same time. ... , -\nIf there was telepathy here, it was apparently between\nMrs. Clapham and her little girl. But there is no evidence\nthat their experiences were alike except in relating to the\nsame person.\n\u00a7 2. Collective Visual Hallucinations unrecognised.\nComing now to simultaneous waking experiences, there\nare in our collection a good many cases of apparently\nsensory hallucinations shared by two (or more) percipients\nwho are together, but where there is no evidence pointing\nto agency external to both. From one point of view sug-\ngestion by word or gesture may seem a more likely\nexplanation of the coincidence in the case of waking\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Beciprocal Cases. 361\nhallucinations than of dreams, for, as already remarked\nin another connexion, the content of a waking hallucina-\ntion is usually simpler\u2014less elaborate\u2014than that of a\ndream. If, for instance, A sees an apparition of C in\nhis usual garb and exclaims \" there is C,\" the remark\nwould probably at once call up in B's mind a more or\nless distinct and similar mental image of their common\nfriend C, and it is conceivable that this mental image\nmight externalise itself in space. This possibility must be\nkept in mind in the case of collective hallucinations, and\nespecially of recognised apparitions. But, on the other\nhand, we are less suggestible awake than asleep, and to\nquote Gurney's words, which are I think as true now as\nwhen they were written, \"I do not know of any instance\nwhere the sane and healthy A, simply by saying at a\ncasual moment to the sane and healthy B, '\nThere is such\nand such an object '\n(not really present and not capable\nof being imposed as an illusion on some object really\npresent), has at once caused the object to be conjured up\nin space before B's eyes. In the most extreme case that\nhas come to my knowledge, where something like this has\nproved possible, very strong insistence and repetition on\nA's part, of the sort that a mesmerist employs when\nseeking to dominate a subject's mind, are needed before\nthe impression develops into sensory form. In cases,\ntherefore, where A has liimseK had a hallucination of\nwhich he has spoken at the moment, and B has shared\nit, it is too much to assume at once that B's experience\nmust have been exclusively due to the verbal suggestion ;\nfor if A's mere suggestion can produce such an effect on\nB at that particular moment, why not at other moments\nwhen he suggests the imaginary object, without having\nhimseH seen it ? ^ None the less, of course, ought the\nhypothesis of verbal suggestion to be most carefully con-\nsidered, in relation to the special circumstances of each\ncase, before any other hypothesis is even provisionally\n^ It seems possible, though I thmk Gurney does not mention it, that\nverbal suggestion by A when startled by seeing an apparition might\nhave a stronger hallucination-producing effect than the same suggestion\nfrom A unstartled and merely experimenting.\n\f362 Mrs. Henry Sidgioick. [part\nadmitted \" (see Phantasms of the Living, Chap. XVIII.,\n\u00a73).\nBut there is a source of error (also discussed by Gurney,\nand referred to by him in the passage just quoted) to\nwhich dreams are not hable, for which each case of\ncollective waking sensorj^ hallucination has to be carefully\nexamined ;\nnamely, the possibility that what is seen or\nheard is some real object misinterpreted, or some real\nperson mistaken for another. This is a danger which,\nwhile it to some extent attaches to waking hallucinations\ngenerally, is of special importance in the case of collective\nhallucinations such as we have now to consider, because\nthe interest of them depends entirely on their being\nreally hallucinatory, and at the same time the fact that\nthe experience is shared is itself a reason for suspecting\nthat it has a real basis in some external object.\nFor this reason appearances seen in a bad light, or at\na considerable distance, are apt to be of little evidential\nvalue, and I am disposed at once to dismiss two cases\non this ground\u2014the ground namely that though something\nodd happened we have not enough information to enable\nus to judge what its nature was.\nIn the first (G. 200, Journal, Vol. V., p. 221), when \" it\nwas rapidly getting dusk\" (7.15 p.m. on Sept. 22), a father\nand daughter riding together in a lane crossed at right\nangles by another lane saw pass across in front of them,\nas it might be along the other lane, a man with a slouch\nhat and \" an old-fashioned shepherd's frock.\" He dis-\nappeared as they thought behind the corner of, or possibly\nthrough, the hedge, but though they rode on quickly to\nthe corner they saw nothing more of him and nothing to\naccount for the appearance. There was a vague tradition\nthat the place was haunted. The case quoted in Pro-\nceedirigs. Vol. X., p. 100, may advantageously be compared\nwith this.\nIn the other case (L. 1148, Journal, Vol. XII., p 121)\non a \" very misty \" evening in the middle of May in the\nnorth of England two ladies saw as they thought a cyclist\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Beciprocal Cases. 363\ncoming towards them on a moorland road. He suddenly\ndisappeared, and they thought he might have got into\nthe ditch or have fallen, but no man or machine was to\nbe found.\nAnother case (G. 241, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 145) which\nalso occurred in a very poor light is, I think, more\ncurious and important, and deserves a fuller mention. The\nexperience took place about a year and a half before it was\nrecorded. The account of it was sent to us by Mr. T.\nBarkworth, now dead, who was at the time a Member of\nthe Society and of its Council. He took down the\nevidence of the percipients, whom he calls Lady and\nMiss B., from word of mouth, and they attested the\naccount with their signatures. The house where the\noccurrence took place was in a London square, and as\nto light he says, \" There is only a gas lamp opposite the\nhouse, and the windows are provided with blinds of some\nthick stufE material, so that it seems difficult to under-\nstand how the figure was seen so clearly, unless it was to\nsome extent self-luminous.\" Sounds (unaccounted for) as\nof footsteps and other noises had frequently been heard\nin the house, but I omit the account of these as it is\nstated that \" no importance was attached to them till\nafter the visual experience.\" This is described as follows :\n(G. 241.)\nLady B. was sleeping in her own room . . . and IMiss\nB. was sleeping in another bed at her side. In the\nmiddle of the night both ladies suddenly started up wide\nawake without any apparent cause, and saw a figure\nin a white garment, which might have been a night dress,\nwith dark curly hair. The room was not quite dark,\nalthough there was no artificial hght except from the\ngas lamp in the square. No fear nor any physical\nsensation was experienced. The figure was standing in\nfront of the fireplace, over which was a mirror. The\nposition was such as to show the face in quarter profile\nand to intercept its own reflection from the mirror. It\nwas a female figure, with hair down the back. The\n\f364 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nface, so far as shown, was clearly visible. The two\nladies both spoke and sprang out of bed to the doors,\nwhich they found locked. On turning round again the\nfigure had disappeared.\nMss B. . . . saw the back of the figure and its long\ndark hair, but not the face. The face was, however,\nclearly reflected in the mirror, and Miss B. saw it there\ndistinctly. Like Lady B. she woke up suddenly, without\nassignable cause. The room seemed hghted up.\nIt would be natural to regard such an apparition on\nsuddenly awaking from sleep, if it occurred to a single\npercipient, as probably the continuation of a dream image.\nBut this seems less probable in a collective experience.\nFor a case resembling this, see Proceedings, Vol. X.,\np. 312, and for one in which one of the percipients\nawakes suddenly to share in a waking hallucination of the\nother, see Phantasms of the Living, Vol. II. (1st ed.).\nChap. XVIII., p. 204, case No. 323.\nOne characteristic which, when it occurs, is conclusive\nas to an appearance being hallucinatory is its vanishing\nbefore the eyes of a percipient. I mean by vanishing\nthat it disappears, either gradually or suddenly, while the\npercipient is actually looking at it. I do not mean what,\nI think, happens more often, that it disappears behind\nsome object, or that the percipient having, as in the last\ncase, turned his eyes away sees nothing when he looks\nback. There are three cases of collectively seen appari-\ntions which resemble the last in having occurred indoors\nin a poor light and in not having been i^ecognised, but\nwhich differ from it in having apparently vanished at j|\nleast for one percipient.\n|\nIn the first of these (L. 842, Journal, Vol. IV., p.\n286) :\n(L. 842.)\n'\nThe percipients were sons of Mr. EUwood, a chemist residing\nat Leominster. From an account previously sent by Mr.\n\flxxx\\t:.] Collective mid Reciffocal Cases. 365\nEllwood, sen., it appeared that the percipients were respectively\n19 and 23 years of age. The brothers Avere sleeping together,\nand the elder of the two was the writer of the following\naccount. The first experience occurred on December 20th,\n1889.\nLEOMrNSTEB, February I2fh, 1890.\nThe following is just a short account of what I saw\non the first occasion mentioned. It was, I think, about\n6 a.m., just getting Hght. I had been awake a short\ntime and I suddenly heard the door open (the door was\non the jar aU night), and saw a short figure in a night-\nshirt walk in and stand looking at me by the side of\nthe bed. I distinctly heard a sound of breathing or\nrusthng of the nightshii-t, and I thought at fii'st that it\nwas my father walking in his sleep. Then I thought it\nmight be a burglar (although why a burglar should be\ndressed in a nightshirt I don't know), so I said, \" What\nis it ? \" then I jumped out of bed and rushed to catch\nhold of the figure, when it vanished. My brother also\nsaw the figure standing at the bedside, and after I jumped\nout of bed he saw the figure ghde round towards the\nfoot of the bed and then vanish. I did not see it after\nI jumped out of bed. We both searched well but could\nfind nothing.\nOn the second occasion it was about the same hour\nin the morning and on the same day of the week. The\nbedroom door A\\^as shut all night on this occasion, and I\nwas Ijdng awake when I saw the door open and some one\npeep round. I thought it was one of our assistants come\nfor a lark to puU me out of bed (as we do those kind\nof tricks sometimes) ;\nhowever, I lay stiU, and then the\ndoor seemed to open wide, so I leaned out of bed to\ngive it a hard push and everything vanished, and I\nnearly fell out of bed, for the door was shut as when I\nwent to bed. My brother was asleep this time and saw\nnothing.\nI can positively swear that this is as correct an account\nas I can give, and I distinctly saw what I have mentioned.\nI was awake both times (not dozing, but distinctly awake).\n\f366 Mrs. Henry Sidgivick. [PAET\nI was also in good health and had not been up late,\netc., the night before. I may add that before this\noccasion I did not beheve in ghosts, or anything in that\nway. I really and truly thought a man was in the\nroom, and I intended collaring him when I rushed at\nhim.\nW. M. Ellwood.\nP.S.\u2014I only saw the head of the second figure, but\nit was, as near as I could tell, hke the first figure. \u2014W.

Ellwood, Jun.\nIt occurred to Mr. Ellwood, senior, that the figure might be\nconnected with his landlord, who was Ijdng ill at the time and\nhas since died. This gentleman was an intimate friend and\nhad a special affection for Mr. Ellwood 's younger son. He\nis also known to have interested himself in the place during\nhis last iUness. But no definite coincidence can be made out.\nMr. Ellwood also informed us that his house had the reputa-\ntion of being haunted, but the only phenomena observed\nappear to have been unexplained noises before the deaths of\nseveral of Mrs. Ellwood's relatives.\nOnly one of the percipients in this case saw the phan-\ntasm vanish, but the hallucinatory character of the\napparition seems pretty clear, and is confirmed by the\nsecond (non-collective) experience of one of the per-\ncipients, especially by the effort to shut the ai^parently\nopen door resulting in reaching out into vacancy.\nIn the next case (G. 201, Journal, Vol. V., p. 223) the\nfigure was seen by three percipients and appears to have\nvanished before the eyes of at least two of the three.\nMr. Podmore refers briefly to this case in his Apparitions\nand Thought Transference but scarcely describes it, and\nboth this and the two previously quoted cases are\nsimilarly referred to in Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 320.\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 367\n(G. 201.)\nThe place where the following incident occurred is a very-\nmodern London house. Dr. Kingston, who obtained the\nnarrative for us, tells us that \" the young ladies looked out\nfor the apparition on the same night of the following year,\nbut saw nothing.\" We may assume, therefore, that at any\nrate mere expectation was not sufficient to produce the im-\npression.\nJuhj 31s^, 1891.\nOn the night of November 1st, 1889, between 9.30\nand 10 jj.m., my three sisters and myseK left our library,\nwhere we had spent the evening, and proceeded upstairs\nto our bedrooms. On reaching my room, which is on\nthe second floor, I and a sister went to the mantelpiece\nin search of the matchbox, in order to hght the gas.\nI must here explain that my bedroom opens into my\nmother's, and the door between the two rooms was\nopen.\nThere was no light beyond that which glimmered through\nthe Venetian bhnds in each room. As I stood by the\nmantelpiece I was awe-struck by the sudden appearance\nof a figure ghding noiselessly towards me from the outer\nroom. The appearance was that of a young man, of\nmiddle height, dressed in dark clothes, and wearing a\npeaked cap. His face was very pale, and his eyes down-\ncast as though deep in thought. His mouth was shaded\nby a dark moustache. The face was slightly luminous,\nwhich enabled us to distinguish the features distinctly,\nalthough we were without a light of any Idnd at the\ntime.\nThe apparition gUded onwards towards my sisters, who\nwere standing inside the room, quite close to the outer\ndoor, and who had first caught sight of it, reflected in\nthe mirror. When within a few inches from them it\nvanished as suddenly as it appeared. As the figure\npassed we distinctly felt a cold air which seemed to\naccompany it. We have never seen it again, and cannot\naccount in any way for the phenomenon.\n\f368 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc.

Miss L. Du Cane saw the face\nbetter than the natural hght would have enabled her\nto do. Her sisters, I gathered, saw the figure clearly\nbut not the face. The dress, so far as seen, might have\nbeen that of, say, a purser on board a merchant steamer.\nThe figure did not suggest to them any person they had\never seen, and its dress and appearance had no associations\nfor them. Its arms were held away from the body, so\nthat they saw the Hght between\u2014about as a man's arms\nwould be if his hands were in his pockets. They did not\nsee the hands.

The figure\nseems to have moved quietly towards them from the\nwindow.\nThere were no curtains, except a white mushn one, nor\nother objects making explanation by illusion plausible.\nIt can hardly have been a real man, because a real man,\nhaving no business there, would not have come towards\nthem. They beheve, too, that they would have heard a\nreal man going up or down the stairs, which were at the\ntime uncarpeted, they having only recently come to the\nhouse.

Du Cane, who did not see the figure, appears to\nhave been deterred by alarm from looldng in its direction.\nIn the following case (G. 239, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 135)\nthe percipients were under the impression that the\ngrotesque figure they saw, and one of them touched,\nvanished through the floor. It is, however, perhaps\npossible that the vanishing as well as the figure was in\nthis case an illusion, and that the appearance was due to i\na combination of moonlight and a light-coloured cat aided\nby imagination. The cat is suggested by the green eyes\nand the tactile impression, and the noiselessness of the\nmoving figure is not inconsistent with the idea. At the :,\nsame time we have no evidence whatever that there was\nsuch a cat about.\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 371\nThe account I give is that of one of the percipients,\nMiss McCaskill, and was enclosed in a letter dated July 25,\n1892. We have also an account from the other per-\ncipient, and, further, one written in February, 1893, by\nMiss Alice Johnson immediately after talking over the\nexperience with Miss McCaskill, and confirmed by the\nlatter.

The three accounts are in very fair,\nthough not absolutely complete, agreement.\n(G. 239.)\n4, Shakespeare-road, Bedford.\nLast summer [August, 1891] I was paying a visit\nto some cousins, who were en pension with a German\nfamily, at Cassel. My cousin L. V. [assumed initials]\nand I shared a room, known, from the stained window,\nas the '\nRitterzimmer. ' Out beds occupied almost all one\nside of the room, of which I send a rough plaii [not repro-\nduced]. One night we were late going to bed, and were\nnot in bed till after 11.30. We went on talking for some\ntime. We were neither of us the least nervous, nor was our\nconversation such as to make us so. I remember we were\ntalking about the opera Robert der Teufel, to which we\nwere going next day. We had stopped talldng for a few\nminutes, and I was lying with my face to the wall, when\nI was startled by a scream from my cousin, and, turning\nround, saw a tall white figure standing in the room,\nnear L.'s bed. I cbd not at the time feel frightened ;\nmy one idea was to find out what strange thing it was.\nIt turned and came towards my bed, and I distinctly\nremember noticing that it made no sound on the polished\nwood floor. Its ej^es were green and glistening, but the\nrest of the face seemed muffled up. As soon as it was\nclose to my bed, I seized it, and seemed to take hold of\n>> something soft, like flims}' drapery, but whatever it was\nseemed dragged from me by some invisible power, and\nthe thing hteraUy sank into the fioor by my bedside.\nL. was in a perfect terror, and her mother, and G. von\ni, T., and another friend were startled by the noise, and\ncame to see what was the matter. We searched every-\n\f372 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nwhere, but nothing was to be seen. I cannot account\nfor not feeling afraid of it, especially as afterwards I\nheartily wished the night were over. L. knew there was\na legend about our room, and that this ajDparition was\nsaid to come that day once in ten years, but she did\nnot beheve in it, and I knew nothing at all of the story.\nThe people who had hved in the house before told Frau\nvon T. that they had seen something twice in that room.\nThey had lived there over 20 years ; but Frau von T.\nhad not been there long enough to test it before. No\none could jjossibly have got into the room, as the door\nwas a very noisy one, close to the foot of my bed. We\nslept in the room for some time, both before and after,\nbut never saw anjrthing more. As my cousin and I\nboth saw the \" thing,\" I am at a loss to account for it,\nbut I should be extremely sorry to sleep in that room\nthat day ten years. Agnes McCaskill.\nIn another unrecognised but vanishing case (G. 230,\nJournal, Vol. VI., p. 22) the light was somewhat better\napparently than in those so far described, but the appari-\ntion was seen out of doors and at a somewhat greater\ndistance. Mr. Reginald Barber writes :\n(G. 230.)\n24, LORNB-GBOVE, FaLLOWEIELD, MANCHESTER,\nJanuary 2\\st, 1891.\nIn April of last year, while the hght was still good, I\nwas returning home from a walk with my wife, and when\nwithin a few yards of the gate, which opens into a straight\npath leading to the house, both my wife and I saw a\nwoman pass through the open gate and walk straight to\nthe house, when, on reaching the door, she disappeared.\nI ran to the door, opened it with my latchkey, and\nexpected in my astonishment to find her inside, for she\nseemed to have walked through the door. It all seemed\nso real that I at once searched the house, but in vain.\nWe were the only two people in the street, and did not\nsee the figure until she entered the gate, when we simul-\ntaneously exclaimed, \"Who is that?\" She seemed to\ncome out of space and go into space again in a most\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 373\nmarvellous manner. She wore a plaid shawl, and her\nbonnet was a grey-black with a bit of colour in it. We\ncould not remember hearing any sound as she walked,\nbut otherwise we have never seen anything more appar-\nently substantial. It is impossible for us to conceive how\nshe could have disappeared if she had been of flesh and\nblood.\nIf only one of us had seen this figure, I should have\nthought httle about it, as such cases of hallucination\nseem sufficiently common, and may be accounted for by\nsome physical or mental disturbance ; but the evidence in\nthis case points to the existence of something exterior\nto ourselves.\nWe are neither of us behevers in ghosts or the like, but\nare two ordinary matter-of-fact people.\nReginald Bahber.\nIn answer to inquiries, Mr. Barber wrote as follows :\nDeas Sir,\u2014I received your letter this morning, and\n[wiU] now . . . reply to your inquiries. \" Did I or my\nwife see the figure first ?\n\" My wife points out that I\nmust have seen the figure first, for she did not see it\nuntil it was well inside the gate. \" Was there any\nexpectation of a visit ?\n\" Not the least. \" Give the\ndistance of the apparition when it disappeared.\" A few\nyards, I could not say exactly. When I have heard Mrs.\nBarber telling friends of our experience, I have noticed\nthat the figure presented to her mind does not seem\nto have been exactly the same as that which was evident\nto my mind. That would appear to support your theory\nthat no real figure existed. Again, Mrs. Barber is sure\nshe spoke first (though I thought we spoke at once),\nand, as she points out, I saw the figure first. This\nshows that the figure was not suggested by one to the\nother in any ordinary manner.\nMrs. Barber, I trust, ^vill send you an account of our\nexperience while I am from home.\nI shall be glad to answer any further questions if you\nthink the case caUs for them.

[part\nMrs. Barber T\\Tites :\n24, LoRNE-GEOVB, Fallowfield ,\nJanuary 30th, 1891.\nI shall be much pleased to give you my account of\n\" our ghost.\"\nI may begin by saying that Lorne-grove is a very\nquiet thoroughfare of no great length. During April\nlast year the road was being paved, and consequently\nin a very chaotic state\u2014full of loose stones, etc. The\npavement on the opjiosite side to our house was already\nlaid, so on returning from our walk on the 19th of\nthat month my husband and I kept on that side of the\nroad until we were exactly opposite our own gate. Up\nto this time we had seen no one in the Grove.\nMy husband now began to cross the road, bidding me\nfollow, and take care not to fall on the loose stones. I\ndid so, naturally looldng down at my feet, until a httle\nmore than half way across the road, or about 6 yards\nfrom the gate, when on raising my eyes I saw a grey\nfigure walking up the path to the door. She was then\nabout a yard inside the gate, and although she had\napjoeared so mysteriously, I felt no surprise, she looked\nso thoroughly commonplace and substantial. My husband\nsaw her enter the gate, so there can be no question as to\nwhich of us saiu her first, but I was certainly the first\nto exclaim: \"Who is that?\" although my husband's\nexclamation followed so quickly that they might almost\nbe considered simultaneous, as indeed I beheve Mr. Barber\ndescribed them in his letter to you. I next said :\n\" Stop\na moment and let us see who it is,\" but he answered,\n\"No, it is no good letting her ring,\" and hurried forward\nwith his latchkey. The distance from the gate to the\ndoor is 7| yards, and when I first saw the figure I should\nbe about 6 yards from the gate.\nMy husband would be at least a couple of yards in\nfront of me, and as he saw the figure actually turn in\nat the gate he had a better view of her shawl and bonnet.\nI only saw that she was in grey, and that it was no\none we knew. She walked quietly up the path and then\nup the two steps to the door, and I always fancy I saw\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Gases. 375\nher raise her hand as though to ring the bell, but of that\nI cannot be sure, and then against the dark door she\nvanished completely, certainly not more than 4 yards\nfrom where my husband was standing. We were expecting\nno visitor, and our thoughts were far away from the\nsupernatural, for just before crossing the road we had\nbeen saying how hungry we were, and how we should\nenjoy our supper.\nI took special note of the date and hour, fully expecting\nwe should hear of some occurrence which nearly con-\ncerned us, but nothing has, so far, transpired.\nGertrude Barber.\nMr. Barber wrote later :\n24, LORNE-GROVE, FaJLLOWEIELD ,\nMANCHESTER,\nFebruary &h, 1891.\nMrs. Barber thinks the time we saw the apparition\nwould be as nearly as possible seven o'clock ; I merely\nremember it was about sunset. I am sure it was light\nenough to see to read outside, and within there was no\nartificial Hght burning. I remember searching the house\nby dayhght to find the figure we had seen. It was a\nbeautiful, clear, calm evening. We do not know that\nwe have seen anything hallucinatory before or since. If\nwe saw a figure pass by in the street hke the one we\nhave described, its naturalness would cause us to make no\nobservation. Mrs. Barber says she has often thought\nshe has seen a cat, though perhaps not with the distinct-\nness of nature. Suddenly seeing an object resembling a\ncat might, of course, provoke the illusion.\nMr. Barber says that he has sometimes experienced an\nauditory hallucination\u2014namely, fancjdng that his wife was\ncalling him by name from another room so distinctly that he\nrose to answer it, but as he reached the door fancied he\nheard her caUing him back again. He has heard her call\nhim in this way three times, but has had no other visual\nexperience besides the one described above.\nMr. Myers called on Mr. Barber on August 1st, 1891, and\ngives the following account of his interview :\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgiviclc. [part\nAiigust 2nd, 1891.\nI saw Mr. and Mrs. Barber yesterday, and inspected\nthe scene of the apparition. It is quite clear that there\nwas no real person on the step. When Mr. and ]\\Irs.\nBarber tixrned into the street, a very short and quiet\none, no one was visible. The figure appeared suddenly,\nentering the gate through which you pass over a few yards\nof flagged walk and up two steps to reach the front door.\nThe figure struck Mr. Barber at the time as noiseless.\nIt is not certain that the figure looked the same to Mr.\nand Mrs. Barber. Mr. Barber, who was in front and saw\nit best, noticed a check in the shawl. Mrs. Barber did\nnot look carefuUy at the dress, but took it to be grey.\nBoth thought the woman a beggar, or something of that kind.\nMr. and Mrs. Barber have been about seven years in\nthe house. No servant has died there, nor did the figure\nresemble the previous occupant.\nNeither of them has ever had any other similar experience.\nF. W. H. Myebs.\nThere is one more unrecognised and vanishing case\n(L. 827, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 71), and in it, it was the\nvanishing which startled the percipients and first made\nthem think it was not a real man that they were looking\nat. Certainly its vanishing for both of them apparently\nat the same time and at different distances is difficult to\nreconcile with the hjrpothesis either of some optical illusion\nor of mistaken identity. On the other hand, a hallucina-\ntion which persists for twenty minutes and \" throws a\ngood line \" would be a very tmusual one. The case is\none where one specially regrets that the interval between\nexperience and record was so long as four years, and\nwonders whether any error of memory seriously affecting\nthe interpretation has crept in.\nMr. J.

As we were thus standing together\nUghting our pipes from the same match, I said to him,\n\" Do you see that man fishing down there ?\n\" He rc-\nphed, \" I have had my eye upon him for the last 20\nminutes, and as it may be Major-General Allgood, I\nthink I had better go down and apologise to him lor\nthe hberty we are taking, as I have not yet been once\nto see him this year to ask his permission to fish.\"\nAccordingly Mr. Jones left me for this purpose, and\nwhen he came mthin 15 or 20 yards of the supposed\nfisher, the figure suddenly disappeared and seemed to\npass away into nothing, whilst we were both looking on.\nMr. Jones then turned round and looked towards me, but\ndid not speak until I advanced to A\\ithin a few paces of\nhim, when he said, \" Ridley, I hope nothing has happened\nat home.\" We at once proceeded to take down our rods.\nAny one visiting the spot would at once see that no\nhuman being would be able to get away without being\nseen by us.

Collective Visual Hallucinations recognised.\nIn the collective visual cases that remain to be described\nthe apparition was recognised. In the first two it also\nvanished for at least one percipient. In the first (G. 275,\nJournal, Vol. XI., p. 185) the recognised apparition was\nthat of a dead person. We received it through the Rev.\nA. Holborn, who knew both the percipients. The account,\ndated Dec. 9, 1903, printed below was written by one of\nthem and signed by both. Their names and the address\nof the narrator were given fully, but with a request that\nthey should not be printed. The second percipient pre-\nferred not to write an independent account.\n(G. 275.)\nThe account runs :\nA little friend of ours, H.

Mr. E. (one of the per-\ncipients) and Mr. R. (whose apparition was seen) had\nworked in the same office with him for a number of\nyears. After telling us a little about tliem in a letter\ndated December 7, 1900, he goes on :\n(L. 1169.)\nMr. R. told me of his appearance to Mr. and IMrs. E.\nthe morning after the occurrence, having heard it from\nMr. E. At that time Mr. and Mrs. E. were averse to\ngiving me any statement, and I have only recently over-\ncome their scruples.

T.\nMr. E. writes :\nDec. m. 1900.\nAbout two years ago, one Sunday afternoon, I was\nsitting with my wife in the back parlour of the flat we\nthen occupied. At that time Mr. T.

We had spoken of him on\nthis occasion, and of the probabihty of his caUing, but\nwere not siaecially expecting him or thinking of him.\nHappening suddenh^ to look up I saw Mr. R. standing\nin the front parlour, just within the door leading to the\npassage.

In the next two, moreover, the certainty is not\nso great as in the one just quoted that it was a case of\nhallucination. The characteristics by which the figure was\nrecognised were, however, in both cases well marked and\nthe light was good, and what was seen was certainly not\nthe person or animal it was taken for. Mistaken identity\nseems therefore the only possible alternative to hallucina- <\ntion, and in both cases it is not an easy one to accept.\n;\nIn the first (G. 286, Journal, Vol. XV., p. 249) the appari-\n1\ntion, if it was one, was of a cat.

Shortly before Smoky\ndied she had been worried by a dog, and had her ribs\nbroken, so that she walked quite lame. This injury was\nthe final cause of her death.\nOn Tuesday, July 6th, 1909, my sister and I were at\nbreakfast, and I was reading a letter aloud to her. I\nwas sittmg with my back to the window, which was on\nmy sister's left. Suddenly I saw her looking absolutely\nscared, and gazing out of the -window. I said, \" What\nis the matter?\" and she said, \"There's Smoky, walking\nacross the grass !\n\" We both rushed to the window, and\nsaw Smoky, looking very ill, her coat rough and staring,\nand walking lamely across the grass in front of the\nwindow, three or four yards from it. My sister called\nher, and as she took no notice, she ran out after her,\ncalling her. I remained at the wndow, and saw the\ncat turn down a path leading to the end of the garden.\nMy sister ran after her, callmg her, but to her surprise.\nSmoky did not turn nor take any notice, and she lost\nsight of her among the shrubs. About ten minutes\nafterwards, my sister and a friend living with us saw\nSmoky again, going through a hedge in front of the\nwindow. My sister again went out after her, but could\nnot find her. She was next seen about half-an-hour\nafterwards by the servant, in the Idtchen passage. She\nran to get her some milk and followed her with it, but\nthe cat walked away, and from that moment she dis-\nappeared completely. We made every enquiry of the\nneighbours, but no one had seen her, or any cat Hlic her.\n\f382 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nOf course we tliought there had been some mistake about\nher death, though our friend, the gardener, and the boy\nhad all seen her dead. The gardener was so indignant\nat the supj)osition that he had not buried the cat, that\nhe went to the grave, took up the plant, and dug up\nthe body of Smoky.\nWe are quite mystified at the occurrence, which was\nwitnessed by four people, namely B. J. Green, H. L.\nGreen, IVIiss Smith, and Kathleen B. (servant). When\nlast seen the cat was walking towards House, next\ndoor, where she had lived all the winter and spring.\nBut when my sister went over there, the people at\nHouse had seen nothing of her. When my sister first\nran out after her, the cat ran away in front of her,\nmoving fast, but on one side, as she did before she died.\nB. J. [Green].\nThe account is also signed by jVIiss H. L. Green and Miss\nD. W. Smith. Miss B. J. Green says in a letter :\n\" We\ndid not ask the httle maid to sign it, as we did not wish\nher to dwell on the occurrence.'\"\nThe pecuhar apjoearance of the cat and the nature of the\nsurroundings in which it was seen make it improbable that in\na small country place a real animal could have escaped all\nprevious and subsequent observation. In reply to our enquiries\nMiss Green writes :\nMarch Qth, 1912.\nOur garden is a fairly large one, over half an acre,\nand is entirely surrounded by a wall. The high road\nruns on two sides of it, and on the other sides are our\nown house and two houses with gardens, both belonging\nto relations. Neither of these houses had any cat in\nthe least like ours, nor had the peoj)le seen one in their\ngardens. There is a \" spinney \" about 100 yards uja the\nroad, but none nearer, and each time the cat was seen it\nwas going in the opposite direction to this wood\u2014once\ntowards the end of our own garden, where it seemed to\ngo into a beech hedge which screens the stable, etc.\n(My sister examined all this part, but could see nothing.)\nThe last time, it was going towards the wall separating\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 383\noiu\" garden from that of House (my cousin's house,\nin which my sister had lived for nine months wdiile the\nowners were away ;\nthey had lately returned to it). It\ndid not jump upon the wall, but seemed to disappear as\nit got near it. A tree on the other side of the wall\nshades this part of the garden. . . .\nWhen I saw it, I was at a large window, which reaches\n\\^dthin half a foot of the floor. Outside is a verandah,\nwith glass tiles, about two yards in width ;\nbeyond this\na grass-plot with flower-beds. When my sister and I\nsaw the cat, she was on the grass, just beyond the\nverandah, in full sight from the window. I stood at\nthe window, while my sister ran out after her, and I\nsaw the cat wallc slowly across the grass towards a path\nwhich bounds the grass-plot. My sister says she ran\nclown this path, but I could not see this, as a holly-\nhedge hid the path from me.\nI may add that I have never in my life seen anything\nsupernormal, nor had our friend, Mss Smith ; but my\nsister has twice seen curious \" visions \" or apparitions,\nthough she is the most practical, \" common-sense,\" person\nimaginable. Our father was Scotch (Galloway), our mother\nEnghsh.\nI have wondered sometimes whether my sister's sight\nof the cat could have been conveyed to the other jier-\ncipients telepathically, so that they saw what was present\nto her vision.\nThe interest of the case seems to make it worth giving\na further account of her sister's visions which Miss B. J.\nGreen was kind enough to send.\nMarch IZih, 1912.\nIn reply to your enquiry about my sister's experiences,\nI will write dovm (from her dictation) exactly Avhat they\nwere.\nAs a young girl of eighteen to twenty she spent two\nor three years with cousins at C . [The] house was\nsupposed to be haunted by an old lady, but nothing was\nsaid to my sister about this, and it was only after her\nexperience that she was told of the supposed haunting.\n\f384 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc. [part\nMy sister was in the habit of sitting up late in her\nroom, studying or reading. One night when she was\ndoing so, she heard, as she thought, her cousin coming\nalong the passage to her door, which was open. She\nliastily blew out her hght and kept quiet, fully expecting\na scolding ! But the steps returned down the passage\nagain. Next morning she said laughingly to her cousin,\n\" You nearly caught me last night ; I suppose you saw\nme blow out my hght.\" Her cousin said, \" I never\ncame down your passage at all \" ; but made no further\nremark, and my sister supposed it must have been a\nservant, but, feehng a little nervous, she took care to go\nto bed in good time. Some time afterwards she woke\nup with the feehng of a \" presence \" in the room, and,\nlooldng up, saw a figure bending over her. She was\nreally alarmed, and hid her face in the bed-clothes. When\nshe looked up the figure was gone. This time my sister\nwas both alarmed and angry, and at breakfast next\nmorning she told the story, and said she was going to\nqi;estion the nurse and other servants about it. Then\nour cousin begged her not to do so, and told her that\nthe house was said to be haunted, and that queer things\nhad often been heard there. After this my sister locked\nher door ; but she was a very sensible, non-imaginative\ngirl, and she heard nothing further of the \" ghost.\" At\nthe end of two or three years she came home, and did\nnot visit C again for several years. Then she stayed\nin the same house, but on the lower floor, and though\nshe remembered the story, and half expected to see the\nold lady, she saw and heard nothing whatever.\nThe third time she stayed there she had a very curious\nexperience. This was two years later. She slept on the\nupper floor, but in a different room, and as she had seen\nnothing on her last visit, she expected no apparition at\nall. One night she woke up quite suddenly. She looked\nup, and there, over her shoulder, against the wall, was\na man's head\u2014the head only. It was quite clearly seen,\nas if it were hghted in some way, though the room was\ndark. It was a young face, with short beard, and very\nsad eyes, as if they had tears in them. She Avas so\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Beciprocal Cases. 385\nstartled that she called out \" Go away, go away !\n\" and\nhid her face for a moment. When she looked up the\nface was gone.\nShe has always said, since, that she is very sorry she\nwas not brave enough to speak to the apparition.\nHer next (and last) experience was, I think, the most\ncurious of all.\nShe went, a year or two later, to stay with a married\nhalf-sister near B who was in very great trouble\nand in some personal danger. After staying with her\nabout a month my sister was anxious to come home, and\nhad almost decided to do so. Early one morning (it\nwas getting quite light enough to see plainly) she woke\nup with the same sensation of a \" presence,\" and saw\nkneehng by her bedside, with eyes fixed on her with an\nentreating expression and hands clasped, a woman's figure.\nShe recognised the hkeness in the face, partly to a picture\nof my half-sister\"s own mother (which hung in another\nhalf-sister's house), and partly to my eldest half-sister\n(not the one she was staying with). She felt quite\ncertam, in a sort of flash, she says, that it was my\nhalf-sister's own mother who was there, and asking her to\nremain with her daughter. The figure disapj^eared almost\ndirectly (my sister thinks she started up, or put her hands\nup, she is not quite sure which), and it just went. Bat\nshe took it as a real request, and stayed on as long as\nshe was needed. (The reason she thought of leaving was\nbecause her presence did not seem to benefit my half-\nsister as she had hoped.)\nThese are all the things she has seen. But please\ndo not imagine that she is hysterical or nervous. She\nis a trained nurse, very accurate, and particularly calm\nand quiet in manner. She is the only one of our family\nwho has \" seen anything \" (except for my share in\n\" Smoky's \" apparition), and I think any one who knew\nher would say that she was a most unlikely \" ghost\nseer.\" But she is a person of strong will and has much\ninfluence over others, and it was this quality which made\nme think that my vision of \" Smoky \" might have been\ntelepathic from hers.\n\f386 Mrs. Henry Sidgwich. [part\nMy father's first wife died more than two years before\nhe married again, and about six j^cars before my sister\nwas born. B. J. [Gkeen].\nI have read over this account and can vouch for its\naccuracy. Helen L. [Green].\nIn a subsequent letter Miss B. J. Green writes :\nMarch 29th, 1912.\nThere is one more observation I should hke to make\nre the \" Smoky \" story. My sister is not sentimental\nabout animals, and though very sorry for the cause of\nSmoky's death, she was rather reheved when the suffering\nwas ended, as she knew the cat could not recover from\nher injuries. She had certainly not fretted over her\ndeath. I note this lest any one reading the account\nshould imagine that }ny sister was in any hysterical grief\nover the cat's death.\nMiss H. L. Green's earlier experiences, whether subjective in\norigin or not, add to the probability that her vision of the cat\nwas hallucinatory, since they show that she is subject to vivid\nvisual hallucinations. It should be noted that she was the\nfirst person to see the \" apparition \" of the cat. The three\nsubsequent percipients all laiew, when they saw the cat, that\nit had been seen by her. The same explanation does not\nnecessarily apply to each of the three appearances of the cat.\nThe hypothesis that what was seen was a real cat mistaken\nfor Smoky is most plausible in regard to the servant and least\nplausible in regard to the Misses Green ;\ninversely, the evid-\nence for collective hallucination and suggestion is in their\ncase strongest. It is difficult to think that two persons,\nhaving good normal eyesight, could be completely mistaken\nas to the identity of an animal presenting several marked\npeculiarities, with which they were perfectly famihar and which\nthey had on this occasion an excellent opportunity of observing.\nOn the other hand it may well be that Miss H. L. Green,\nhaving experienced, as on previous occasions, a vivid subjective\nhallucination, was able to convey it to her sister. The case\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 387\ngains much in value from the fact that those concerned are\nthoroughly competent observers, as may be judged from\ntheir reports.\nIt is worth while comparing this case with another\ncollective apparition of a cat published in the \" Eeport of\nthe Census of Hallucinations,\" Proceedings, Vol. X., p. 305,\nand also in Podmore's book. It was collected for us by\nDr. F. C. S. Schiller. In that case a white cat was\nseen by two ladies together on two different occasions,\nand each time it vanished before their eyes. The account\nwas not, however, written till about five and six years\nrespectively after the occurrences.\nThe next case (L. 959, Joiirnal, Vol. VI., p. 131),\nobtained through the kindness of Mrs. Shield, relates to\napparitions of the Rev. H. Hasted of Pitsea Rectory,\nEssex, which were seen by several different percipients, in\ntwo instances collectively. The first account is given by\ntwo of Mr. Hasted's servants.\n(L. 959.)\nPitsea Rectory,\nMarch llth, 10.40 a.m.. [1892].\nYesterday, at half-past eleven, N., the rat-catcher\ncame to see master, who was out. We looked at the\nI\nclock to tell N. when we thought he could see master,\n'\nwho had ordered luncheon at 12.15. We Avere both\noutside the door when N. came. He was in a cart and\nhad with him two dogs. He drove on, and Mrs. Watts,\nlooking down the road, said, \" Here comes the master !\n\"\nThen I saw him too, his dog with him. N. had just got\n;\nbelow the front gate. We watched to see them nieet\n;\n'i\nwondered why N. did not stop to speak, as he Avanted\nto see master. He drove right on. About that time Ave\nlost master ; couldn't think where he Avas, but fancied\nhe must have gone to Wilson's house. Wilson himself\nAvas standing loAver doAvn, Avhere the roads meet. We\nstiU Avatched, and Avhen we couldn't see him (master)\ncome out we A\\ent indoors.\n\f388 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nWhen Mr. Hasted came home T wasn't going to say\nanything, but Mrs. Watts asked if he had seen N., who\nwanted to tell him about a pupjiy. He said he had\nbeen at Mr. Williams's, and all the story came out.\nEliza Smali,bone.\nJane Watts.\nMrs. Shield writes :\nMarch. \\m, 10 jhrn.\nThis forenoon for upwards of an hour, Mr. Hasted\nwas here [at Mr. Williams's] and I think it was from\neleven to past twelve. He Avas witing and conversing.\n... Of all people in the world one Avould think these\nold servants are the very least likely to make a mistake,\nand the road is straight and not long, nor is it much\nfrequented.\nAfter maldng inquiries the next day, Mrs, Shield wrote\nfurther ;\nMrs. Watts, the cook-housekeeper, was not at home.\nEliza thought it quite impossible they could make a\nmistake as to the person they saw, and everyone here\nsays the same. No one would expect to see him Avithout\nhis dog, but, in fact, the dog AA^as here with him.\nI omit the accounts of Mr. Hasted's other appearances,\nas one is remote and the other at second hand, and aa^U\nonly remark that there are cases of different percipients\nhaving at different times hallucinations representing the\nsame person, see Phantasms of the Living, Chap. XIV.,\n\u00a7 5, and Human Personality, Vol. I., pp. 263 and 4.\nI myself visited sites of these appearances of Mr. Hasted\nand saw the witnesses of two of them. I wrote :\nApril 4:th, 1892.\nI have to-day seen Mr. Hasted and the site of three\nof his appearances, as well as Miss Florence Williams,\nwho Avas one of the percipients on the first occasion,\nand Mr. Hasted's two servants who were the percipients\non the last occasion\u2014last month.\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 389\nThe appearance to Miss does not appear to me\nto come to very much, on account of distance and shnibs,\nwhich must have obstructed the view not a httle. Miss\n\u2014\u2014 is said, however, to have recognised the liorse\u2014\n\u2022\na hght-coloured one, unUke any others in the neigh-\nbourhood.\nThe apj)earanco to the servants, thongli oat-of-doors\nand at a considerable distance, is certainly remarkable.\nThey stood at the back door of the house, looking down\nthe lane after the rat-catcher. The lane is perfectly\nstraight and open, and, say, 100 yards long or 150, to\nwhere it joins another road at right angles. At the end\nof this lane the cook saw Mr. Hasted and his dog coming\ntowards the house, and almost before she called her\nfellow-servant's attention to him the latter saw him too.\nThey saw him pass the groom's (Wilson's) cottage, which\nis near the end of the lane, and anticipated his meeting\nthe rat-catcher and the latter stopping to sj)eak to him.\nThe rat-catcher's cart presently hid him from view, and\nwhen he should have appeared on their side of the\ncart he was gone. They were surprised, but supposed\nhe must have turned and gone into Wilson's cottage,\nand thought no more of it. Wilson, however (whom I\nalso saw), was standing all the time at the end of the\nlane, and he is quite positive that there was no one\nwhatever in the lane at the time except the rat-catcher.\nMr. Hasted's peculiar way of walking and swinging his\nstick was noticed. His dog is a brown and white spaniel,\nand there is no other like it in the neighbourhood excei)t\none kept tied up. The servants say they noticed this\ndog and the rat-catcher's two dogs all at the same time.\nThey struck me as good witnesses. It is certain that\nit could not have been Mr. Hasted himself because the\nservants had noticed the time just before (11.35) in order\nto teU the rat-catcher when they thought their master\nwould be in, and at that time Mr. Hasted was with Miss\nF. Williams and Mrs. Shield at Bowers Gifford, and they\nalso noted the time. Mr. Hasted Avas hurrying through\nsome work, wondering whether he should get it done in\ntime to go home for lunch at 12.15.\n\f390 Mrs. Hennj Sidgwick. [part\nWhen Miss F. Williams and her sister (as children)\nsaw him, he was also coming along a straight road, the\napproach to the Rectory, towards them. They watched\nhim through some bushes as he approached. When he\ngot up to the garden gate, they withdrew more behind\nthe bushes that he might not see them, but neither he\nnor anyone else passed. The way to the back door\nleads off from the garden gate, and it seems just possible\nthat the person they saw was not Mr. Hasted and was\nsomeone who went to the back door. Their recognition\nof Mi. Hasted was, however, very distinct. They do not\nremember hearing any steps going towards the back door ;\nthey believe that they asked, and found that no one had\ngone there. It was a good many years ago.\nMr. Hasted was also, Ave were told, supposed to have\nbeen seen on the beach at Bournemouth by a lady friend\nlately, when he was not at Bournemouth at all.\nIn the next case (L. 828, Journal, Vol. IV., p. 72) the\nhallucination, if it was one, was very unusual in character,\nand though mistaken identity is also a hypothesis difficult\nto maintain, I think it is the easier of the two. Mr.\nMaclclison writes from Sunderland, Feb. 6th, 1888 :\n(L. 828.)\nOn the night of December 3rd, 1887 (Saturday), I was\nserving customers in the bar, together with my daughter.\nAbout a quarter past nine (as near as I can remember)\nI saw William Frazer standing at the private door of the\nbar that leads into the house. He said, \" Well, how are\nyou, old man ?\n\" I rejjlied, \" Hallo ! is that you, Frazer\n\u2014long looked for, come at last.\" My daughter, who was\nstanding near me, behind the counter, turned round and\nsaw him also, for she called out, \" Good gracious !\nWonders never cease.\" I had a tray of glasses in my\nhand at the time which I was just about to carry upstairs,\nso I came to the door beside Frazer, took him along to\nthe smoke-room, and saw him enter. As he stood just\nwithin the room, Avith his back almost turned to me, I\nsaid, \" Content yourself there. I'U be down in a minute.\"\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 391\nWhile saying this I remember distinctly I stood with my\nfoot on the bottom step of the stair. I also remember\nthat as I passed the smoke-room door I saw a stranger\nseated in an armchair near the fire. I took the glasses\nupstairs, and returned in about a minute and a-half\n;\nbut on entering the smoke-room I found neither Frazer\nnor the stranger there. I thought Frazer must be hiding\nsomewhere, as he was always full of fun and \" up to\nlarks,\" so I searched all over the house for him, also\nover the yard and outhouses, as I thought he might have\nshpped out there while I was upstairs. I concluded he\nmust have gone home, and world doubtless return the\nnext day (Sunday) to settle up. I should explain that\nthe \" Engineers' Friendly Society \" meets at my housa.\nFrazer is a member, and before going on his last voyage\nhe had asked me to keep his subscriptions paid up while\nhe was away. This I had done, so that when I saw him\nat the bar-door, I naturally concluded he had called to\nsettle with me about his society's affairs. He did not\ncall on the Sunday, and some days later we saw the\nCollingwood ss. (Frazer's vessel) reported in the newspapers\nas arriving at Antwerp. When Frazer appeared, he was\ndressed much as usual, with the exception of his hat.\nHe carried a black leather bag. He looked tired and\ndejected, and he did not look me straight in the face.\nOn the night of December 19th (Monday) Frazer did\nactually call upon us. We told him of our strange\nexperience. He told us that on the night of the 3rd the\nCollingwood ss. sailed from Gibraltar for Antwerp. He\ndidn't say what he was doing at a quarter past nine\n\u2014\nin fact, he laughed at the whole affair. They had had\nsome very rough weather on the voyage, hence their\ndetention. I settled up with him in connection with the\nFriendly Society, then we walked out together. He was\nnot so hvely as usual ; he didn't feel much inchned to\ngo to sea again at once\u2014he thought he was entitled to\n\"a bit holiday.\" He asked my advice about it; I\ndidn't advise him either one way or the other, l)ut left\nit to himself to decide. I regret now that I didn't\nadvise him to remain ashore, for the next da\\' ho sailed\n2b\n\f392 Mrs. Henry SidgioicJc. [part\nfor Savona in the CoUingwood, from the Tyne (owners,\nC. TuUy and Co.).

The mother thinks the crew\nmay have been picked up by some outward bound vessel.\nFrazer was a fine young fellow, 25 years of age, un-\nmarried, second engineer on board the CoUingwood ss.\nI have never had a similar experience to this before.\nMy daughter and I are certain we were not mistaken in\nour man. We know no one else at all resembling Frazer.\nGeorge Maddison.\nMiss Maddison wrote an exactly concordant account two\nand a half months later, giving the remarks exchanged\nalmost verbatim as her father did.\nIt will be admitted that it is very unusual for a hallu-\ncination to affect similarly both sight and hearing of two\npercipients\u2014I do not think we have another instance of\nit\u2014and to persist while one percipient \" took him along\nto the smoke-room.\" The testimony of the person in\nthe smoke-room might have been conclusive on the\nc[uestion whether the figure seen was a real man or not,\nbut Mr. Nisbet, at that time Honorary Associate of the\nSociety, had an interview with Mr. and Miss Maddison,\nand ascertained that Mr. Maddison did not know who this\nperson was.\n\u00a7 4. Collective Auditory Cases.\nIt is, generally speaking, more difficult in the case\nof purely auditory experiences than in the case of visual\nones to feel sure that they are really hallucinatory,\nbecause we more often fail to interpret real sounds\ncorrectly than real sights. This is especially true of\nnon-vocal noises. In the non-vocal cases, however,\nin our collection the sounds heard were regarded by\nthe percipients as probably, or at least possibly, veri-\ndical, being associated with external events, and they\nalready have been or will be dealt with under appro-\npriate heads. The cases that remain consist of one\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 393\nin which the sounds were musical\u2014as of voices singing\n\u2014\nand two in which names were called. But the musical\none and one of the others seem to me very doubtfully\nhallucinatory, and I will only describe them briefly.\nIn L. 1203 [Journal, Vol. XVII., p. 118) we have the\nevidence of four members of a family who, in the ruins\nof the Abbey of Jumieges, heard for a few seconds sounds\nas of monks singing. Their efforts to discover any\nnatural cause for this failed, but whether the possibilities\nwere exhausted may perhaps be doubted. \\\nIn the next case (L. 960, Journal, Vol. VI., p. 139) the\npercipients were again out of doors, in a street. Mx.\nU. J. da Costa Cabral of Rio, together with a number of\nschoolboys, his pupils, heard and recognised the voice of\nhis sister who hved with him. The voice called two\nnames, his own \" Ulysses \" and that of his brother-in-law\n\" Bittencourt.\" His sister had not called and nothing\nhad happened to her. The voice seemed to come from\nthe comer of the street, but when some of the boys ran\nthere, they found nothing. The case was sent by Pro-\nfessor Alexander of Rio, who examined the witnesses.\nThe third case (G. 247, Journal, Vol. VII., p. 9) is,\nI think, more remarkable. It was received through the\nRev. W. S. Grignon. We are not permitted to print the\nnames of the percipients.\n(G. 247.)\nOne of them, Mr. W., writes :\nAugust 6th, 1893.\nOn the 1st November, 1892, soon after 11 a.m., -^hile\nseated with ]\\Ir. S , m the office room of his house\nat , Poona, I distinctly heard a voice with which I\nwas quite unacquainted call out in sharp clear tones,\n\"]Mrs. H ! Mrs. H !\" (my sister-in-law, who was\nlost in the Roumania a few days previously). The\nvoice seemed to be that of someone calhng from above\nto my sLster-in-law down stairs.\n\f394 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nMy age was 36, and at the time I was in good health,\nthough in grief and anxiety about the loss of my sister-\nin-law ;\n[I] was discussing an official I'eport of mine,\nwhich JVIr. S , who is the head of my Department,\nwas reading out.\nMr. S distinctly heard the same voice, and we both\nstarted up and went outside into the verandah and all\nover the house, but there was no one about except the\npeons, who declared no one had called out. The ladies\nof the house were in one of the back bedrooms, but they\nhad neither heard the voice, nor had they been calhng\nout.\nI have never had an experience of this kind before.\nMr. S. writes :\nPooNA, August loth, 1893.\nMr. W 's statement is absolutely true. I heard\nthe voice, clear and distinct, call out, \" Mrs. H ,\"\ntwice. It was a voice not belonging to my household,\nand a strange voice,\u2014the voice of a woman alarmed\n;\nand it sounded as if on board ship calling down a sky-\nlight. I say this in perfect faith, as I began hfe as a\nsailor, and served seven years in the Indian Navy, and\nhave had personal experience of the ^Deculiar sound of\nvoices calling down hatchways and skylights on board\nship at sea. The voice was so real, and the name so\ndistinctly uttered, that Mr. W and I left the table at\nwhich we were seated and ran outside into the verandah\nof the bungalow in the endeavour, on the spur of the\nmoment, and on natural impulse, to discover the owner\nof the voice ; but there was no one at all near, within\nspeaking or caUing distance. Two peons, or native\nmessengers, who were in the verandah, informed us that\nno European had been near, and these peons knew no\nEnglish.\n\u00a7 5. Seiiii-reciprocal and Reciprocal Cases.\n8o far the simultaneous psychical experiences described\nin this chapter, whether dreams or hallucinations, have\noccurred to percipients who were together at the time.

He left me\nthere at about eleven o'clock in the forenoon and returned\nto his home. On the following afternoon at about half-\npast three I was sitting alone in the drawing-room, Mrs.\nBerwick being in her own room, and, on happening to\nlook up, I saw Mr. Ward standing at the bay mndow and\nlooking in at me as though he desired to speak to me.\n\fMrs. Henry Sidgvnch. [part\nHe was in liis usual dress and is not a man to be easily\nmistaken for any one else. Thinldng he had brought\nsome letters for me, I rose hastily and went towards the\nwindow calling to hiin and waving my hand to him,\npartly in greeting and partly as a sign for him to go to\nthe hall door, but when I reached the window I was\nsurprised not to see him. I concluded, however, that he\nmust have gone to the door without my noticing and so\nI hurried to the door to let him in. I was exceedingly\nsurprised and alarmed when I opened the hall-door to\nsee nobody there, nor Eniywhere about the house. Later\nwhen Mrs. Berwick came down I told her\u2014and also Mr.\nBerwick\u2014of my experience, and like myself they felt\nextremely anxious lest some harm had happened to Mr.\nWard, for whom we all felt a strong regard.\nNext morning, however, soon after eleven o'clock Mr.\nWard arrived in his trap according to arrangement to\ntake me to the railway station to join the train for\nManchester. He was in a very weak state and suffering\nfrom severe injuries to his ankle, neck, and shoulders, and\nhe remarked to us, \"It is a wonder I have been able to\ncome to you in the body.\" It seemed that whilst driving\nhome on Tuesday the horse, which was a very nervous\nanimal, upset the trap and caused him to be thrown out\nand badly bruised and shaken. The next afternoon,\nwhilst Ipng on a couch in his sitting-room, he was wonder\ning what Mrs. Gi'een would think if she knew of the\noccurrence, when he suddenly heard her voice outside the\nhouse. There being only an elderly woman in the house\nhe managed with great difficulty to get to the haU-door\nto admit Mrs. Green, and was greatly amazed not to see\nher. The time was between three o'clock and four,\njust about the time when Mrs. Green saw his form at\nWhitchurch.\nWe certify that this account of the hallucinations seen\nand heard by Mrs. Green and Captain Ward is correct.\nEllen Green.\nFrederick Ward.\nJohn Berwick.\nFanny A.

He will be so interested in\nthis.\"\nShe held in her hand a letter from Mr. Burgess, and\nproceeded to tell me that the previous night she had\nheard, as she thought, Mr. Burgess fall on the floor of\nthe bedroom over her own. She sprang out of bed.\nFinding herselE in the middle of the room she heard him\ncall \" Miss Steele \" three times. She then suddenly\nremembered that Mr. Burgess was no longer hving in her\nhotel. She struck a hght, looked at the clock and found\nit was 3 o'clock. The following morning she felt so\ntired that when giving orders to her cook, the latter\nnoticed her fatigue and commented upon it. She told\nthe cook the reason was that she heard Mr. Burgess\napparently caUing her at 3 o'clock.\nMiss Steele proceeded to say that Mr. Burgess had,\ncuriously [enough], sent her that afternoon the note which\nat that moment she held in her hand and in which he\ntold her that he dreamt she had appeared to him at\n3 a.m. the previous night.\nMiss Steele appeared much impressed and wondered if\nanything had happened to Mr. Burgess.

In the second this is less\ncertain, for both experiences occurred at the moment\nof waking. It seems pretty certain, however, that ,\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 403\nMr. Burgess was awake when he saw Miss Steele's phan-\ntasm, though m Miss Steele's case the hearing of the\ncall seems more like the end of a dream, and it is\nnot quite clear\u2014probably was not clear to herself at the\ntime\u2014whether she awoke from it or to it. It is not a\nquestion of much importance, for in both cases the\nexperiences were evidently of a markedly impressive\ncharacter.\nNeither of these cases was exactly reciprocal in the\nfullest sense, for there is no evidence of the percipients\nparticipating in each other's experiences, or realising each\nother's surroundings and circumstances or ideas in any\nway. I think it is very likely that there was reciprocal\ntelepathic action and reaction\u2014each party being both agent\nand percipient. But there is little or no internal evidence\nof this. The utmost that can be said, I think, is that\nMiss Steele's intention, before she was fully awake, to go\nto Mr. Burgess's assistance may have caused the appear-\nance to him of her phantasm, and that Mrs. Green's call\nto the phantasmal Captain Ward may have been the\ncause of the hallucinatory call heard by him. But this\nis highly conjectural, as the details do not correspond\n;\nand if it was so, it would indicate one-sided rather than\nreciprocal influence. The evidence for telepathy depends,\nas it does in death-coincidences, on a phantasm of A\nbeing seen or heard by B at the time that an miusual\nevent was occurring to A\u2014that event being death in the\ncase of a death coincidence, and the perception of a\nphantasm of B in the two cases we are discussing.\nIn the next case (L. 1122, Journal, Vol. IX., p. 331)\u2014\na case of two dreams dreamt in different rooms of the\nsame house on the same night and probably at the same\nhour\u2014the element of possible reciprocity is somewhat\nmore marked ; for in both dreams the husband was\nbelieved to be examining the supposed injury to the leg,\nand the half-awake thought that followed the dreams\ncorresponded. Nevertheless the evidence scarcely carries\nus beyond thought-transference, not necessarily involving\n\f404 Mrs. Henry SidgwicJc.

He is\nan Associate of the Society who has long been actively\ninterested in psychical research and was well known to\nMr. Myers, as he is to other Members of the Council.\nIn estimating the evidential value of the case, due weight\nmust of course be given to the probability that the pre-\noccupation of the dreamers with the main subject of the\ndreams may have helped to produce them, at least in\npart. But this would not account for the correspondence\nin detail (as far as it goes) nor for the coincidence in\ntime.

I argued with myself that there would sure to be\nnothing in it, that I should only disturb her, and so\nshortly went off to sleep again.\n'\nOn going to her room this morning I said I had had a\nhorrid dream, which had woke me up, to the effect that\nshe had burst a varicose vein, of which just now care has\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 405\nto be taken.\n'\"'\nWhy,\" she repUed, \" I had just the\nsame experience.

In the middle of the night\n\u2014at what hour I do not know\u2014I was awakened by a\ncurious sensation of pressure from above, as of a weight\nresting gently but firmly on me, and looking up saw my\nsister Ehzabeth suspended in some way above me in the\nair. She was lying with her eyes shut, covered with a\nquilt as if in bed, and looked very pale and ill. I felt\nno surprise but only concern for her evident suffering, and\na strong impulse to get up and minister to her. (She\nis subject to occasional attacks of severe pain, and I\nhave nursed her through them very frequently.) How-\never, as soon as I tried to rise I found myself too heavy\nwith sleep to do so. My eyes would not open, and my\nshoulders seemed as if held down by their own weight.\nYet I had felt quite wide awake and fully conscious of\nwhere I was, of the furniture in the room, etc. It\nseemed as if I gave up the attempt to rise, partly because\nshe made me understand that she did not need my\nhelp, but only wanted to be near me. So I put out my\narm\u2014half sitting up, and without effort\u2014and guided her\nto a place beside me on the bed, falling asleep again as\nsoon as she was comfortably settled. She seemed to\nfloat through the air much as a child's india-rubber balloon\nwould do, and was quite easily moved when I touched her.\nAfter a while I woke again with a start and a feeling\nof distress at my own laziness, and again made an effort\nto rise, thinking remorsefully that she had been in pain\nand I ought to have got up and made a poultice, but had\ndone nothing for her. There was again a difficulty in\nrousing myself, and then came the recollection that she\nwas beside me, so that I didn't need to rise. I sat up\n(once more with ease) and asked, \"Are you all right\nnow ? \" I heard her answer, \" Yes, I am all right,\nthank you,\" and went to sleep again.\nIn the morning I was wakened by my youngest sister\nHUda, who came into the room saying, \" Betty sent me\nto teU you that you came to her in your astral body\nlast night.\" \"No I didn't!\" I exclaimed, \"she came to\nme.

It never even struck me she looked jDOorly.\nMiss Ehzabeth Pagan writes :\n24, Newbattle Terrace, Edinburgh, June 20th, 1905.\nMy sister, Isabelle Pagan, teUs me you wish to have a\nstatement from me relating to the curious sort of dream\nshe and I seemed to experience in common some months\nago. My recollection of the incident is that while retiring\nfor the night I felt far from well, but I did not mention\nthe fact to any one lest one of my sisters should think\nof sitting up with me or at least staying awake on the\nchance of being wanted. IsabeUe s room is next to mine\nand I knew I could summon her if necessary by Imocking\non the wall. After two or three somewhat painful hours\n\f410 Mrs. Henry Sidgioick. [part\nI fell asleep ; and towards morning, though the room\nwas still very darlc, I woke, as if from a dream, hearing\nmyself say, \" I am all right now, thanks. Belle.\" At\nthe same time I seemed to see a shadowy form which\nI somehow knew to be Belle, though she was unrecognis-\nably muffled up in white drapery. The whole vision\nvanished UteraUy in the winking of an eye, for, as I\nwinked myself awake to look again at the puzzhng appari-\ntion, it was gone. When my sister Hilda entered my\nroom before brealdast, the first thing I said to her was,\n\" How is Belle ? Please ask her why she paid me a\nvisit in her astral body last night.\" Belle's answer to\nthis message was, \" Indeed I didn't ! Tell her she came\nin her astral body to me\\\n\"\nThen Hilda heard details of the two dreams ; and we\nall felt convinced that Belle had, by some sort of tele-\npathy, been conscious that I was in pain and been able to\nmake me aware of her s3Tnpathy.\nNeither of us has ever been known to sleep-walk and as\nwe have generally shared a room with a sister\u2014often in\nfact roomed with one another\u2014it is hardly possible we\ncould have done so withoat its being known. The doors\nwere not locked, but we both beUeve them to have\nremained shut all night. There was no one near enough\nto have heard if we did move about.\nIsabelle and I have very frequently dreamt like dreams ;\nthat is to say, we have both dreamt of the same scene\nor the same people on the same night ; but this is the\nonlv case of any sort of communication being recollected\nby us both on waldng.

I went\nto waken our sister in the next room and said, \" Betty\nsays you visited her in your astral body last night.\"\n\" Oh no, I didn't, she visited me,\" Isabelle answered.\n\" I was wakened by her on my bed ; she was ill, and I\ntried to sit up and make her comfortable, but I slept,\nand only woke once, when I asked, '\nAre you aU right\nnow ?\n'\nand she answered '\nYes.' \" G.

It has, however, certain evi-\ndential weaknesses to which I will refer after quoting it.\nWe have four statements from witnesses, namely :\n(L. 1106.)\n(1) Narrative of Mary B., cook, attested by Isabella C, house-\nmaid, and Jane D., parlourmaid. Taken down by J. L. B.\nfrom M. B.'s narration.\nOn Friday night, December 11th, 1896, about 11\np.m., we were all sitting by the fire in the kitchen. We\nheard steps in the passage, coming from the hall and going\nalong by the nursery door. Jane looked up and asked\nif I heard anything. I said, \" Yes, I thought I heard\nMrs. Blaikie walking along with her skirts rustling, from\nthe front door along by the nursery.\" We had all heard\nit.

Then we went upstairs to Miss Jeanie's\nroom. She had heard it and said she hoped there were\nno burglars about. We went all over the house and\nlooked everywhere but there was nothing to be seen.\nWe then went to bed and have never heard it again.\nWe all thought Mrs. Blaikie must be dead.\n(Signed) Mary B.\nIsabella C.\nDecember \\ltli, 1897.

I heard the steps\ncome from the hall, past the foot of the staircase, and\nalong the passage known as \" the Nursery Lobby.\" There\nthey died away, and I heard no more. It was rather a \\\nheavy, quick, decided step, accompanied by the rustle\nof a silk dress, and was so exactly like my mother's that\nif I had not laiown her to be in Edinburgh, ill, at the\ntime, I should not have had two doubts about it.

They then asked if I\nhad heard steps, and when I said \" Yes, they sounded\nexactly like Mrs. Blaikie's,\" they told me they had heard\nthem as they sat in the kitchen, had gone to look in\nthe hall and passage, and had seen no one.

It was very evident\nthey thought they had heard a ghost, and as my mother\nwas rather seriously ill at the time, of course they con-\neluded it was hers. We did not discuss this, however,\nand I suggested burglars, took my poker, and went with\nthem in a procession all round the house. We looked in\nevery room and closet, in every wardrobe, in the bath,\nand under every bed, and found nothing. The only\nother person in the house at the time, besides my sister,\nthree maids, and myself, was my elder brother, who slept\nin a room upstairs not far from mine. I went to his\nroom, and found him fast asleep. On being roused up\nhe said he had not heard anything at all.

They were\nheavy and rather quick ;\nexactly like my mother's, but\nnot resembling those of any of the servants. I thought\nit must, however, be one of the maids, and paid no\nattention to them untU the three servants came in a\ngreat state of panic to ask if it had been me.

Terrace, Edinburgh, I was seized\nwith an acute attack of larjmgitis. The evening of the\nnext day (Friday, December 11th), about 11 o'clock I\nhad such a sensation of being suffocated that I felt as\nif I were dying, and would never see my home again.\nI was suddenly filled with an overpowering longing to be\nat home, and whether I feU asleep for a few moments\nand dreamed I do not know, but it seemed the next\nminute as if my desire was granted, and I felt I was\n\f414 Mrs. Henry Sufgwick. [pARf\nactually there. I was conscious of walking along the\npassage past the dressing-room door, and towards the\nroom we call the nursery, but I had hardly time to\nrealise my own joy and relief when I found myself still\nlying in bed, and the feeling of suffocation from which I\nhad had such a happy respite for a few moments, again\ntormenting me. When I returned home a week later I\nwas told by Jane D. of the curious occurrence at Holydean\non the evening of Friday, the 11th.\n(Signed) H. B.\nThe foUowing are what seem to me evidential weak-\nnesses in this case. Mrs. Blaikie's dream (as it pre-\nsumably was) was not apparently a very striking one, and\nit does not seem to have been either recorded at the\ntime or spoken of to any one till she heard of the ex-\nperience of the percipients at the other end. One wonders\nif she would have remembered it, or thought anything of\nit, without this. Then again, as to the collective hearing\nof supposed footsteps\u2014it is a rather common collective\nexperience, e.g. in so-called haunted houses, but I re-\nmember no instance of footsteps being heard by one\npercipient only when others were present. This of course\nsuggests real sounds misinterpreted, and indeed from the\nnature of the case the interpretation of a sound like\nfootsteps unsupported by other evidence must generally be\nsomewhat doubtful. In the present case there seems no\ndoubt that five people in three different rooms heard\nsounds which more or less resembled Mrs. Blaikie's foot-\nsteps, and at least four of them also heard a sound like\nthe rustling of her dress. But out of these five Mrs.\nBlaikie's two daughters attached no importance at the\ntime to the sounds and did not attribute them to their\nmother ; and though, on the other hand, the three\nservants, who were together and may have worked them-\nselves up imaginatively by talking, feared the sounds\nportended her death\u2014were, in fact, produced by her\nghost\u2014 do not think they can in themselves have been\nvery striking. For these reasons the case does not seem\nto me to carry great weight as evidence of recij)rocal\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 4i5\ninfluence, but it is interesting nevertheless. A case\ndescribed above with tlie death coincidences, L. 1141, see\np. 242, should be compared with it.\nI will conclude this analysis of our collection with two\ncases of reciprocal dreams. In both the dreamers were\nin separate houses, and in both the reciprocality seems to\nhave been very complete ; the dreamers dreamt together\nas it were, the dream drama the same for both and each\nin his own dream playing his own part.\nA letter giving a short account of the case I will first\nquote (L. 1188, Journal, Vol. XV., p. 262), and also of a\ndream quoted above, p. 301 (L. 1189), appeared in Light\non March 16, 1912.

Barnard writes in a communication received by\nas on April 2, 1912 :\nOn Feb. 11 we were both up with sick children the\ngreater part of the night. L. [Mrs. Barnard] had Baby\nBetty in her arms all night, sometimes in bed. We\nwere both worried about the two boys at school with\nmeasles. L. was under the impression that Francis'\nhead ached. She wanted him to put his head on her\nshoulder, but was afraid he would hurt the baby.\nFrancis' next letter said that his mother was with him\nall night, but the baby was in the way. I am very\nsorry we burnt the letter for fear of infection of measles.\nFrancis Barnard (aged 13) writes as follows :\nApril 15, 1912.\nIn February, 1912, George and I had measles at school\n;\non Sunday, Feb. 11th, I felt very bad and worse as night\ncame on, and whether sleeping or waking I felt my mother\nwas close beside me and Baby B. was in her arms and\nmuch in the way. Afterwards I found she had been up\nall night with baby, who was ill, and thought and dreamt\nof me all night. Slie thought I wanted to put my\nhead on her shoulder and could not because of B. She\nwoke Daddy up saying, \" Mind B. you Avill hurt her.\"\nWhen I came home I was very surprised, for this was\njust what had happened. The second thing that sur-\nprised me was that mother knew that I was in the big\ndormitory the third bed from the door. This was just\nwhere I was. No one could have told her. I could not\nwrite, and no one else did.

I all the same knew he was in the big Dormitory\nand his bed was the third on the door side. This I told\nhim the day he returned and he was astonished. I\nknew his own room so weU and I have only once been\nin the big Dormitory.\nIt is perhaps of some interest that Mrs. Barnard had\nanother veridical dream\u2014the one quoted above, p. 301\n\u2014\nfive days after this one. Perhaps the anxiety and agita-\ntion she had gone through had rendered her specially\ntelepathically susceptible at the time.\nThe other case (L. 986, Journal, Vol. VII., p. 104) was\nsent to Dr. Hodgson through Dr. M. L. Holbrook, who\nwas acquainted with both the percipients. The first\naccount is from Dr. Adele A. Gleason.\n(L. 986.)\nThe Gleason Sanitakium, Elmira, N.Y.

That great fear came on me ;\nthat a presence as of a man well-known to me came and\nshook a tree by me, and that its leaves began to turn to\nflame.\nThe dream was so vivid that I said to the man of whom\nI dreamed when I saw him four days later, \" I had a\nvery strange dream Tuesday night.\" He said, \"Do not\ntell it to me ; let me describe it, for I know I dreamed\nthe same thing.\"\nHe then without suggestion from me duphcated the dream,\nwhich he knew, from time of waldng from it, took 2^1ace\nat the same hour of the same night.\nAdele A.

I\nwent to the side of my friend and shook the bush, when\nthe falUng leaves turned into flame.\nOn meeting this friend, a lady, some days aftei-ward,\nshe mentioned having had a vivid dream on Tuesday\nmorning, 1 and I said, \" Let me teU you mine first,\" and\nwithout suggestion I related a duplicate of her dream.

It seems not unlikely that the fact that they\nwere being carried on facilitated the dreaming in common.\nIt was realised by Gurney and those who worked with\nhim in compiling his book that reciprocal cases are rare\n\u2014\nso much so that he says, \" the number of these reciprocal\ncases is ... so small that the genuineness of the type\nmight fairly enough be called in question.\" They are\nrare in our present collection also, but I nevertheless\nventure to think that those we have, not only add to the\nevidence for the genuineness of the type by adding to\nthe number of cases, but that they help materially, taken\nin connection with other evidence in our collection, to\nthrow light on the whole process of telepathic com-\nmunication. Dream cases though they be, I am disposed\nto regard the last two cases quoted, and to which I have\nworked up as a kind of climax, as the fullest manifesta-\ntions we have in the collection of telepathic communica-\ntion. In other words, I think the kind of union of\nminds, the thinking and feeling together, here shown\nmay be regarded as the type or norm of telepathic com-\nmunication to which all other cases conform in varying\ndegrees.\n\f420 Mrs. Henry Sidgwiclc. [part\nIt is in collective cases that this can perhaps be most\nclearly seen. Take for instance the collective crystal\nvision described on p. 48, where there is movement in the\npicture. The percipients here have ideas and images in\ncommon within the limits of the crystal vision, though\nthe personal element with its emotions and sensations, as\nexhibited in the last two reciprocal cases, is absent. It\nis generally easiest, I think, to explain the cases of\ncollective hallucinations and corresponding dreams de-\nscribed in the present chapter as reciprocal\u2014as instances\nof the two minds working together. And this may still\nbe so when the process is aided by verbal or other\nsuggestion, or when some third mind, living or dead,\nshares in the process, influencing one or both percipients.^\nIf this partial merging of the two minds is the true\ntype of telepathic communication, the degree to which it\ntakes place in different instances evidently varies enor-\nmoixsly, or at least its manifestation does. Thus, unlike\nthe dreams last quoted, the two dreams in L. 1162 (p. 357,\nabove) were very different from each other, meeting\napparently only in the one point of drowning and rescue\nof the wife. I have already pointed out that in the\nsemi-reciprocal cases of Mrs. Green and Captain Ward\n(L. 1150, p. 395, above), and of Miss Steele and Mr.\nBurgess (L. 1187, p. 398, above), the evidence carries us\nlittle beyond simultaneous hallucinatory impressions of each\nother experienced by the two percipients with (at least\non one side) hallucination -producing force ; and that in\napparitions at the time of death the impression received\nby the percipient is usually nothing more than a vivid\nidea of the presence of the dying person. There are two\nstages in the process of manifestation of telepathic com-\nmunication at which failure, that is incompleteness, may\noccur. There may be incomplete contact between the\ntwo minds concerned ; and when that contact is sub-\nliminal, as I imagine is generally the case, there may be\n^ This intervention of a third mind must of course occur in veridical\ncollective cases, e.g. the dreams of the brother's fatal accident (L. 1138,\np. 271 above). And it may have happened in e.g. G. 275 (p. 378), or\nL. 1169 (p. 379) in the present chapter, though we have no evidence\nof it.\n\fLxxxvi.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 421\ni\nincomplete emergence in either mind from the subliminal\nto the supraliminal consciousness. The contact could not\nbe really complete\u2014it could not extend to the whole\ncontent of either mind\u2014without loss of individual per-\nsonality, but short of this it may presumably vary in\ncompleteness through all possible degrees. Emergence into\nthe conscious again varies probably in degree. It cer-\ntainly varies in method, as it may occur through re-\nmembered dreams, through waking hallucinations, through\nmotor automatism such as automatic writing, or through\nconscious but non-externalised waking impressions of\nvarious degrees of definiteness, such as those described\nin Chapter II. above. It probably often happens that\nthere is telepathic communication which does not emerge\ninto the normal consciousness at all. We cannot there-\nfore tell where failure occurs, nor why or how any\nparticular case differs from the normal type. But this\nis, of course, equally true whether we think of the process\nas transmission of thought or as merging together of\nminds\u2014what we might perhaps call transfusion of thought.\nIn regarding the merging or transfusion as the normal\ntype of telepathic process no new theory is involved\u2014nor\nany idea not already expressed by other students of the\nsubject. It is only looking at the subject from a some-\nwhat different angle from that suggested by the experi-\nments with which our investigations almost inevitably\nbegan. In those experiments there is obviously an agent\nand a percipient\u2014the agent consciously trying to transmit\nan idea to the percipient who is trying to receive it. The\nphysical analogy suggested by this is some force in the\nagent causing something to be transferred through space to\nthe percipient\u2014we compare the process to radiant energy\nlike light or heat or sound. Of course we soon realise that\nit is not radiant energy\u2014that the analogy must not be\npressed so far ; but the idea of transmission fits many\nspontaneous cases {e.g. simple death coincidences) as well\nas experimental ones, and we get into the habit of think-\ning in terms of this analogy.\nAnalogy is a dangerous instrument in reasoning, for the\nvery reason that it is difficult to keep its limitations in\n\f422 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nmind when using it. But in speaking of psychical matters\nits use is almost a necessity. We can hardly think of\nconcrete things except in terms of the world of space\nmatter and motion in which we live, and are driven to\nexpress ourselves in metaphor and by analogy. Something\nmay be gained, however, by using different analogies and\nso looking at things from different points of view ; and\nthat is what I am trying to do in speaking of minds\nbeing in more or less complete contact with one another.\nContact or transfusion is a physical idea just as much as\ntransference or transmission, and probably represents what\nactually occurs almost, if not quite, as imperfectly. But\nit has the merit of eliminating the idea of distance and\nfalse analogies depending on that. And the habit of\nthinking of what occurs from the point of view the\ncontact analogy suggests, may, I think, be more fruitful\n\u2014\nlead us further towards the truth\u2014than that produced by\nthe transmission-through-space analogy. For one thing it\nseems to fit more cases. While applicable to all the cases\nwhich the transmission-through-space analogy fits, it also\nfits cases where the idea of direct transfer presents diffi-\nculties. For instance, take the case (L. 1127, p. 147,\nabove) where Miss F. dreams veridically her brother's\nplace in an examination\u2014there was no known connection\nbetween the examiner and the dreamer, or reason why an\nidea should be transferred from one to the other. But\nthe sister's mind may well have been in contact with the\nbrother's and the examiner's with that of the examinee\nwhom he had just examined and placed. Thus through\nthe brother, in whose own mind the idea never emerged\ninto consciousness, the examiner and the sister might be\nin touch. It fits, too, cases of unconscious leakage where\nthe idea is so trivial that one does not see why it should\nreach the percipient at all, unless some common content\nof the two minds, such as might be produced by their\nstaying in the same house, puts them in contact (see, for\nexample, L. 1228, p. 315). It fits cases of seeming tele-\npathic clairvoyance, such as Mrs. D.'s mental vision of\nMrs. H. (L. 1152,|'p. 58), where any activity was on the\nside of the percipient. It at least makes more compre-\n.^1\n\fLXXXVI.] Collective and Reciprocal Cases. 423\nhensible the apprehension by the percipient of pubhc\nevents of general interest, but not special private interest\n(see, for example, M.Aut. 104, p. 73), and other cases\nwhere we cannot trace a particular agent. The mental\ncontact analogy seems, in fact, more elastic than the\ntransference analogy, and lends itself better to any case\nwhere the relation of agent and percipient is not simple\nand obvious. Moreover, I may add, though it is outside\nour present province, that if we may assume telepathic\ncommunication with the dead, the contact analogy seems\nto fit the case of communications through mediums. For\nthe communicator in mental contact with his friend the\nsitter may through him get into contact with the mind\nof the medium\u2014the medium being a person through whom\nthe communication can be brought out into consciousness.\nSome such hypothesis to account for the relation of\nmedium, sitter and communicator seems to be required.\nIt is probably only some sitters who are capable of acting\nas a telepathic link in this way, which may account for\nthe more satisfactory communications received by some\nsitters than others.\nWhat I have been saying, and indeed this whole paper,\nshows what need there is of further evidence to throw\nlight on the subject of telepathy. And, as we all know,\na further accumulation of well-evidenced cases is required\nto convince the scientific world of its existence. So I will\nconclude with an appeal to Members and Associates of\nthe Society to send us all well-evidenced cases, recorded\nsoon after their occurrence, which they can hear of. If\nall our Members took as much pains as some of them do\nto look out for, and report fully, interesting cases, our\ncollection of well-evidenced and convincing telepathic\nincidents would, I feel certain, increase more rapidly than\nit does, and our knowledge of telepathy would grow with\nit. I believe too, that if more people would only try,\nwe should find that the number who are capable of\nobtaining telepathic impressions through, for example,\ncrystal gazing is greater than we know ; and likewise\nthat experiment would reveal more people capable of\nproducing impressions on others telepathicaUy.\n3\u00a9\n\f424 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick.

Methuen & Co. 6s.\n\" This book,\" says the author, \" is intended primarily for\nthose readers who have no professional training in either\nMedicine or Psychology, but who are anxious to keep them-\nselves abreast of modern thought in these departments of\nknowledge. At the same time I hope it may prove serviceable\nto professional students of these subjects as a preliminary\nsurvey of the ground they will have to cover should they\ndesire to specialize in i^sychotherapeutics or in the psychology\nof the abnormal.\" To this statement the reviewer may add\nimmediately that it is admirably adapted to both of its two\nmain purposes ; it is indeed\u2014within the limits necessarily\nimposed by its relatively small size\u2014probably the best work on\nits subject existing in the English language. Readers of the\nProceedings are already familiar with the qualities that dis-\ntinguish Dr. Mitchell's writings\u2014above all their lucidity and\ntheir impartiality\u2014and will recognise with pleasure that he has\nemployed these by no means too common gifts to great\nadvantage in the present volume.\nIn the exposition of his subject Dr. Mitchell deals first with\nthe theory of dissociation, as illustrated by the facts of\nhypnotism and hysteria, the treatment of these subjects being\nhistorical in form. In his third chapter on Repression he\nbegins to deal with the concepts introduced by the psycho-\nanalysts and throughout the remainder of the book (i.e. from\np. 42 onwards) the thought proceeds pretty closely along\npsycho-analytic lines : in fact, were it not for the relatively\nnarrow scope necessitated by a strict adherence to the medical\npoint of view, this portion of the book could be confidently\nrecommended as one of the most accurate and illuminating\n(but at the same time one of the most concise) introductions\nto this subject that are at present in existence. Apart from\nthe advantages accruing from Dr. Mitchell's special gifts of\nexposition, the treatment of psycho-analysis is more instructive\nthan that to be found in many other books, in that the\n\fLXXXVI.] Reviews. 431\npsycho-analytic discoveries and theories are here seen in their\nproper historical and scientific settings, and thus appear far less\nstrange and far-fetched than when presented, so to speak, in vacuo.\nThe nature of the subjects treated and the order of the exposition\nwill be readily seen from an enumeration of the chapter headings,\nwhich (from Chapter IV. onwards) are as follows : the Un-\nconscious, Psycho-analysis (in which stress is very properly\nlaid on the distinction between psycho-analysis as a psycho-\nlogical method, psycho-analysis as a body of doctrine, and\npsycho-analysis as a therapeutic instrument), Dreams, the\nNeuroses, Psycho-therapeutics, the Prevention of Neurotic\nIllness. The reader will find much of interest and importance\nin all these chapters, but, in the opinion of the reviewer, two\nof them are of quite outstanding usefulness, namely, those\non the Unconscious and on the Neuroses respectively. It is\nespecially in dealing with these difficult and complex matters\nthat Dr. Mitchell's power of clear thinking stands him in good\nstead. With admirable lucidity the reader is introduced to\nthe different views that have been held concerning the nature\nof the Unconscious, Subconscious, Co-conscious, Subliminal, etc.,\nand the relation of these concepts to each other is clearly\nindicated. A proper assimilation of this chapter on the\nUnconscious should save the student much misconception and\nconfusion. It is, too, a chapter which may be read with\npleasure and profit by the advanced psychologist as well as\nby the beginner. Much the same applies to the chapter on\nthe Neuroses\u2014a subject that has been rendered obscure by\nvarying classifications and by the varying use of the same\nterms as employed by dilJerent writers. Here also Dr.\nMitchell proceeds to set our mental house in order in an\naltogether exemplary manner, and the reader emerges from the\nspring-cleaning, feehng not only that the cobwebs have been\neffectually removed but that the actual process of purification\nhas been a pleasure rather than a drudgery.\nAs is to be expected from the nature of the work and\nfrom Dr. Mitchell's detached methods of treatment, the work\nof \" post-Freudian \" Avriters such as Jung, Adler, Silberer and\nMaeder is reviewed in an impartial and on the whole non-\ncommittal manner. Dr. Mitchell, indeed, rather tantahzingly\nrefrains from any direct expression of his personal opinion on\n\f432 J. C. Fliigel. [part\nthe questions here at issue, though (especially when taken in\nconnection with his pronouncements elsewhere) an indication |\nof the nature of his own views is perhaps afforded by the fact\nthat he thinks it necessary to forestall a possible criticism\nas to the inadequate pi'esentation of the post- Freudian schools |\nby reminding his readers that \" the work of Freud is the\nfoundation on which all subsequent analytical doctrines and\nmethods are based ; and that psycho-analysis differs from some\nforms of analytical psychology in that it adheres strictly to\nthe principles of science and does not pose as an ethical\nsystem or as an esoteric religion \"\n(p. 179).\nThe only serious criticism that can be raised against the\nbook is that it has the defects of its merits. Written as it\nis in Dr. Mitchell's broad, calm and somewhat cautious manner,\nit is of necessity somewhat less stirring, trenchant and immedi- '\nately arresting than some similar treatises written from a\nnarrower point of view. But what it may jjerhaps lack in j\nvividness or picturesqueness, it amply makes good by its\ntolerance, clearness and conciseness. It is a book to be con-\nfidently recommended to all who are interested in the contribu-\ntions of Medicine to the science of the mind. J. C. Flxjgel.\nII. Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis. By Pkof. Sigm.\nFreud. Authorised English Translation by Joan Riviere.\nWith a Preface by Ernest Jones, M.D. Pp. 395.\nAllen & Unwin. 18s.\nWith the possible exception of the Traumdeutung, this book\nis likely to be the most generally read of any of Prof. Freud's\nworks, and its translation into English by Mrs. Riviere is a\nvery welcome event. It differs in two principal respects from\nmost of the author's other works : first, in that (as the title\nindicates) it consists of lectures delivered before an audience\nwho were, it is assumed, receiving their first initiation into\npsycho-analysis ;\nsecondly, in that it covers a wider field than\nthat of any single previous work of Freud's. These two facts\nmake it eminently suitable as a introduction to Freud's\nwritings, and there cannot be the slightest doubt that those\nwho are approaching the study of this author for the first\ntime will be well advised to start with this volume rather\nthan with any of the monographs devoted to more special\ni\n\fLXXXVI.] Revieivs. 433\nsubjects. Not that this book makes any pretence of covering\nthe whole field of psycho-analysis ;\nindeed, it professes to deal\nwith three aspects of the subject only\u2014the Psycho-pathology\nof Everyday Life, Dreams and the Neuroses ; but in treating\nthese matters it affords interesting sidelights into the other\nfields of psycho-analytic application, so that the careful reader\nwill be well equipped to proceed to the other developments\nwhich are not dealt with (or are at most only touched upon)\nin this volume.\nProf. Freud, as his readers have now come to recognise,\ncommands several distinct styles of writing. Sometimes he\nwrites concisely but yet with admirable clearness. Occasionally\nit appears as if the desire for clarity and ease of exposition\nhad so triumphed over the desire for brevity that the treat-\nment becomes somewhat lengthy in proportion to the matter\nit contains\u2014any disadvantages accruing from this, however,\nbeing largely compensated by a charming intimacy and per-\nsuasiveness of manner and an altogether delightful lucidity of\nexpression. But sometimes, again, it is the ojjposite that\nhappens ; ease of exposition is ruthlessly sacrificed to concise-\nness, and when this mood is on him Prof. Freud gives the\nimpression that he has condensed into one page of this kind\nof writing what would have occupied him for at least ten\npages of his easy-flowing style\u2014with a result that makes\nconsiderable demands upon the reader's powers of concen-\ntration. All three of these styles are to be found in the\npresent book. The middle section on Dreams is wonderfully\nclear and convincing, and is in many ways a far more polished\npresentation of the subject than is the Traumdeutung itseH.\nThe first section on the errors and mistakes occurring in\ndaily life is in our author's most simple and persuasive style ;\nthe reader is led easily along by the \" sweet reasonableness\n\"\nof the argument untU he almost forgets to shudder at the\ndreaded abysses of the Tiefenpsychologie that lie ahead of him.\nIn the third part, however, the easy methods of exposition\nare discarded in favour of the condensed style. Nevertheless\nthis section well deserves the careful study that it demands.\nAn adequate assimilation of it wfil carry the reader a long\nway towards a mastery of the more difficult and often mis-\nunderstood parts of psycho -analytic theory. Furthermore, it\n\f434 F. 0. S. Schitier. [part\nwill be of almost as much interest to the advanced student\nas to the beginner, for nowhere else has Freud given such a\ncomplete and consistent exposition of his attitude towards the\nproblems of the neuroses.\nAll three sections give ample evidence of that wonderful\ngift of perspicacity into the obscure places of the mind that\nhas enabled Prof. Freud to throw a brilliant light upon so\nmany hitherto dark and insoluble problems of human thought,\nemotion and behaviour. This authorised translation (an\nunauthorised and in many respects inaccurate translation has\nalready been on the market in America) of this most important\nexposition of Freudian doctrine from the pen of the Viennese\nmaster himself should undoubtedly mark an epoch in the\nstudy and understanding of psycho-analysis among English-\nspeaking peoples.

Pp. vii + 403.\nIt is something of a new departure in German philosophy\nthat a professor thereof (even though Tubingen is not one of\nthe major universities) should be found to concern himself\nso seriously and elaborately with the problems of psychical\nresearch as Prof. Oesterreich does in this monumental study\nof Possession. In other respects, however, it is a work tyj)ical\nenough of German academic procedure. It is enormously\nlearned, and must pretty nearly exhaust the literature, '\ndas\ngesamte Material,' culled from classical, religious and anthro-\npological sources, with admirable diligence and fullness. It\narranges this material\u2014after a fashion\u2014under headings such\nas these :\n'\nPart I. The Nature of the State of Possession\n\u2014\nthe identity of Possession throughout the ages\u2014its outward\nappearance\u2014the subjective condition of the possessed\u2014the\norigin and cure of Possession\u2014exorcism.

It takes up a con-\nsistently psychological attitude towards this material and\n\fLXXXVI.] Reviews. 435\nrightly emphasizes the possibilities of autosuggestion, and the\nneed for more detailed and psychologically competent observa-\ntion on the part of anthropologists. It admits the occurrence\nof parapsychical phenomena,\" and even of '\nparapsychophysical\n'\n(p. 379). But it propounds no constructive theory of the\nphenomena as a whole, argues no thesis, and arrives at no\nconclusion, beyond remarking that a purely and simply negative\nattitude towards the phenomena is no longer possible. And\nit has, alas, no index, a fact which detracts seriously from\nthe usefulness of its compilation.\nEnglish psychical researchers will be gratified to note how\nclosely Prof. Oesterreich's general attitude coincides with their\nown, and how ready he is to recognize the work of their\nSociety. He declares (p. 379) that in the Piper Case, the\noccurrence of parapsychic phenomena has been established\nbeyond question, and quotes at some length from Sir Oliver\nLodge's sittings with Mrs. Piper. Among his other citations\nthe most curious and interesting case, perhaps, is that narrated\non pp. 369-70 of a Bohemian sculptor, who gives an account\nof his possession by the spirit of a Cu'cassian woman, of the\n(voluntary) extrusion of his own, and of the return of his\nnormal self. It is one of the rare but valuable cases that\nenable us to apprehend what '\nmultiple personality '\nfeels like\nfrom the inside, and is comparable with the Rev. Mr. '\nHanna's\n'\nclassic description in Sidis and Goodhart's book, of how he\nre-synthesized his dissociated personalities. Altogether then\nProf. Oesterreich's work is a competent and valuable contri-\nbution to the subject of which it treats. F. C. S. Schiller.\nIV. Einjuhrung in den Okkultismus und Spiritismus. By Rudolf\nTiscHNER. J. F.

It is, moreover, written\nin an entirely scientific and critical spirit from a standpoint\nclosely akin to that of the S.P.R. ; the author is thoroughly\nacquainted mth the Proceedings of the Society, and quotes\nfrom them extensively and appreciatively. Altogether his book\n\f436 F. C. 8. Schiller. [part\nforms an excellent introduction, though, being as such com-\nposed largely of summaries and citations from the primary\nauthorities, it does not aim at novelties, either of fact or of\ninterpretation. Nevertheless, references are found to a certain\nnumber of interesting cases, which have not yet been reported,\nor at any rate have not yet got into the English literature.\nThus on pp. 33-4 Dr. Tischner tells a story, of his own\nknowledge, about a middle-aged official who is liable to be disso-\nciated into '\nF I '\nand '\nF II.' '\nF II,\" who appears to be the\nanalogue of '\nSally '\nBeauchamp and '\nMargaret '\nFischer, gave\na very ingenious and conclusive proof of his '\nco-consciousness\n'\nwith '\nF I.' He was usually enabled to come to the surface\nby the intervention of a friend, who was going away : never-\ntheless he promised to communicate with his friend through\nthe letters of '\nF I.' Accordingly, when these arrived, it was\nfound that certain letters were thicker than the rest, which\n'\nF I '\nexplained by the badness of the ink : nevertheless,\nwhen these letters were put together, it was found that they\nmade sense and conveyed a message from '\nF II '\n! One\nwould be glad to have from Dr. Tischner a full account of\nthis singular case. The same remark applies to a trance-\ncomposer (p. 42), who appears to be possessed by '\nBeethoven,'\n'\nSchubert,' '\nWagner,' etc., and to be identical with the\n'\nM. R.' of Dr. Tischner's Telepathy and Clairvoyance, and the\nhero of his '\npsychoscopic '\nexperiments. His account also of\nthe experiments undertaken by him to confirm A. de Rochas's\naccount of the '\nexteriorization of sensibility ' is very striking\n(p. 91-2). Only one failure to get the right reaction in a\nseries of fifty experiments is evidently far beyond the possi-\nbilities of chance ; but a fuller account of the conditions would\nbe desirable. A fully documented account of the Grierson\ncase (p. 76) would also be valuable.\nAs regards theoretical interpretation, Dr. Tischner is cautious\nand not spiritistic, though he will not dogmatically deny the\npossibility of spiritism. He is sceptical about spirit photo-\ngraphy, without denying the evidence for other '\nphysical\n'\nphenomena (p. 104), and he thinks it possible that, in spite\nof telepathy and clairvoyance and the disproof of materialism,\nthere may be no individual immortahty, because the psychic\nindividual may merge at death into the general '\nocean ' of\n\fLXXXVI.] Reviews. 437\npsychic being (p. 89). It may be so, of course, so far as our\npresent knowledge goes, though it is hardly an alluring or\nennobling theory ; it makes the universal '\npsyche '\nsomething\nnot higher but lower than the individual soul, and has no\nexplanation of the persistent tendency of psychic being, alike\nin '\ndissociations '\nand in quasi- spiritual phenomena, to take\non a personal form. F. C. S. Schiller.\nV. Ueber Telepathic und Hellsehen, experimentell-theoreiische Unter-\nsuchungen. By Rudolf Tischner. Munich and Wiesbaden,\nJ. F. Bergmann. 1921. 2nd ed. Enlarged. Pp. iv + 122.\nIt is not surprising that Dr. Tischner's book, which first\nappeared towards the end of 1919, has rapidly reached a\nsecond edition. For it is a lucid and impressive account of\nexperiments in telepathy and clairvoyance by a competent and\nclear-headed medical man who is free from metaphysical\nprejudices and aware that it is only upon an adequate basis\nof empirically ascertained fact that theorizing is worth while.\nThe book consists of a brief introduction defining his terms,\nand illustrating the present state of opinion in Germany on\nthe subject, of a clear and concise account of some 180\nexperiments, Avith a number of mediums, followed by a tabula-\ntion and discussion of their results, and by a moderate amount\nof theoretic discussion, mainly critical and intended to bring\nout that the various physical explanations suggested are vague\nand inadequate, and that a psychic explanation (of some sort)\ncan alone do justice to the facts. The centre of gravity of\nDr. Tischner's book is thus definitely situated in the account of\nhis experiments, and this account inspires confidence and seems\nan important addition to the body of experimental evidence.\nThe foUowing points seem particularly worthy of note. Dr.\nTischner defines '\ntelepathy '\nin the same way as the S.P.R.,\nand distinguishes it from '\nclairvoyance '\nas involving the\nintervention of two minds, instead of one mind and an object.\n'\nClairvoyance '\nhe treats as a generic term, covering, 1. '\ncrypto-\nscopy,' i.e. perception of normally invisible objects in the\nmedium's proximity ; 2. '\nseeing at a distance '\nin space, or\n3. in time (past or present). He distinguishes further '\npsycho-\nscopy '\n(\n= ' psychometry '\n) as the insight into the past history\nand associations of objects, though, as the objects were usually\n\f438 F. C. S. Schiller. [part lxxxvi.]\nmore or less elaborately wrapped up, it is not clear Avhy this !\nshould not have been regarded as a combination of the first j\nand third form of '\ncryptoscopy.' He also admits (p. 76) that\nin one case, that of Ludwig Aub, to which he has devoted a\nseparate study, the medium exhibits a mixture of telepathy\nand clairvoyance, and that in some of the cases here reported\ntelepathy is an alternative interpretation to clairvoyance.\nSubject to these reservations, he tabulates his results as\nfollows :\n(1) telepathic, 5 experiments (with 2 subjects), all\nsuccessful ; (2) purely clairvoyant, 74 experiments (with 4 I\nsubjects), of which 32 can be regarded as completely, and\n6 as partly, successful, 36 as failures (either to answer at all\nor to answer correctly) ^\n; (3)\n'\npsychoscopic,' 103 experiments,\nwith 3 subjects, and 50 successes. Altogether 6 subjects were\nemj)loyed, all of them amateurs, with one exception, a paid\nprofessional, with whom 70 experiments are recorded. The\nlongest series, however, was with an amateur, '\nHerr H.,' who\nwas subject to multiple personality (or '\npossession '), and at 60\nof the 97 experiments performed with this gentleman, one or\nmore members of a commission, which had been appointed by\na Munich medical society at Dr. Tischner's request, were present,\nand kept the record of the proceedings. Five of these gentle-\nmen are quoted as expressing their conviction of the genuine-\nness and supernormal character of what they had witnessed.\nIt is evident from this summary that Dr. Tischner has been\nremarkably successful in obtaining results which offer no very\nobvious handle to hostile criticism. At the same time, he also\nhas to confess the waywardness of the phenomena and the\nimpossibility of discovering what are the conditions of success\nor failure. His experiments stand as well-attested but un-\ncomprehended facts, and yield no clue by which real experi-\nmental control of the phenomena would seem to be attainable.\nAnd so long as the phenomena remain uncontrollable and\ncannot be exploited, they will not appear truly real to the\npractical man, while the ordinary man of science will continue\nto cherish a strongly hostile bias against things so elusive\nand so subversive of the prejudices which his training fosters.\nF.

The\nmore elaborate of these coincidences or cross-correspond-\nences have iisnally been of a literary character, and, so\nfar as I can remember, have never been treated as having\nfor their subject a current event. A few cases will be\nfound in Mrs. Verrall's Report on her own automatic\nwriting ^ where knowledge of some event in the near past\nor future unknown to the automatist has apparently been\ndisj)layed in a script ; and here and there in our Pro-\nceedings or Journal^ will be found cases where a script\nhas manifested a degree of coincidence with some event\nsufficiently marked to make it worth while to question\nwhether chance can properly be held to account for it.\nTwo of these cases only appear to me to be really strik-\ning : one in which knowledge of Sir Michael Foster's\ndeath seems to have emerged in a table-tilting before it\nhad reached the filters in a normal way ; the other, in\nwhich a script of Mrs. Verrall's exhibits curious coinci-\ndences with something which Mr. Edward Marsh did ten\nweeks later. Even if all the coincidences are regarded as\nbeyond what chance may produce,\u2014and I certainly do\nnot so regard them\u2014the events with which the scripts\nshow coincidence are generally of a trivial character,^ or\nat least of no great or permanent interest.

Before\nI set forth the evidence, then, I had better state who this\nautomatist is, and say something of the circumstances in\nwhich her phenomena started, and something of the\ncharacter of her automatism. And when that is done,\nI must also say a good deal about the methods employed\nin scripts ; for without a general idea of what these\nmethods are, the reader would often find it difficult to\nunderstand how the interpretation of scripts is arrived at.\nThe automatist in whose scripts the references to the\nWar come out most clearly is the lady hitherto known to\nthe Society by the pseudonym of Mrs. King. Her real\nname, the Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton, she now allows to\nbe disclosed ; but I shall continue to sj)eak of her as\n\" Mrs. King \" for convenience' sake, since in all our\nrecords, indexes, and so forth, the pseudonym and not the\nreal name has been used. Not much has hitherto been\npublished about her phenomena. The earliest reference to\nthem will be found in Proceedings, Vol. XXIX., pp. 1-45,\nand the next and, I think, last detailed reference in an\nAppendix to Mr. Gerald Balfour's paper on The Ear of\nDionysius in the same volume, pp. 239-243. She has\nbeen a member of the Society for many years, but had\nnever tried to do script ^ until some six or seven weeks\nafter her husband's death, which took place early in July\n1913, when at Mr. Balfour's suggestion she began to try\nto get impressions. Mr. Balfour made the suggestion on\nhearing from her that she felt herself to be in touch with\nher husband. She started the experiment with no par-\nticular object in view. She did not, for instance, make\n1 Very little of Mrs. King's output is in the strict sense automatic\nscript.

[part\nany special effort to obtain communications from her\nhusband. Although in the course of her experiments she\nhas not infrequently experienced the sense and conviction\nof her husband's presence and of his co-operation in her\nphenomena, her script affords little, if any, evidence of\nhis identity. But from the very first it has displayed\ncoincidences with the scripts of the other automatists,\nthese coincidences being of a kind which her acquaintance\nwith scripts printed in the Proceedings or Journal will not\naccount for. After the first three or four weeks had\npassed, she showed the results to Mr. Balfour. He\nencouraged her to persevere ; and she has continued to\nproduce script at frequent intervals down to the present I\ntime. She has handed either her original records or\nfacsimiles at regidar intervals to Mr. Balfour, in whovse\nkeeping they have since remained.\nHer early script, like that of all automatists known to\nme, is very sketchy and halting and broken, and these\ncharacteristics have not diminished with increasing practice\nto the same extent that they have diminished in other\ncases. I believe this is largely, if not entirely, due to her\nbeing less dreamy, and more distinctly conscious of what\nimpressions she is receiving, than are, or were, the other\nautomatists. Much of her script is cryptic in character :\nby which I mean that it consists of broken phrases or\nsingle words, each in themselves intelligible perhaps, but\nnot intelligible as a whole ; so that, if the whole really\nhas a meaning, it is concealed in such a way that he who\nruns will not read it.\nFortunately, however, all Mrs. King's script is not\ncryptic ; and many of the passages from it which I shall\nhave occasion to quote in this paper are couched in\nlanguage which, though not wanting in a certain oracular\nvagueness, is on the whole fairly explicit. These passages\nwere written before the War began, and, as I think,\npredict the War. Yet though the language employed\nwas , as I have just said, on the whole fairly explicit,\nand Avas sometimes even quite explicit, neither the auto-\nmatist herself nor those of us who saw the scripts in\nquestion took them seriously at the time as predictions\n\fLXXXVII.] Introduction. 443\nof war.i It was only after the Great War had begun\nthat their import and importance were reaUsed. How\nthen, it may be asked, can I be justified in asserting that\nthe language of these scripts is sometimes quite explicit 1\nI think that when the reader has seen some of the\nextracts from Mrs. King's script he will not quarrel with\nmy description of it ; and that if he will take into con-\nsideration the tendency of automatists to indulge in\nwarnings of catastrophes and horrors he will not be\nsurprised at our paying but little attention to the gloomy\nvaticinations of this modern Cassandra. Moreover, the\nstrength of the evidence very largely depends upon the\nputting together of passages in which the same phrase,\nquotation, or topic occurs ; and before this sort of syn-\nthesis can be satisfactorily performed, it is necessary to\nmake a careful index of all distinctive words, phrases,\nquotations and topics ; and this work was not undertaken\nuntil long after the War began.\nThis last reason for our failure to read the signs of the\ntimes leads me on to the second subject about which\nI said it would be desirable to speak before dealing with\nthe new evidence : namely, the methods employed in the\nscripts.\nThe scripts produced by our group of automatists are\nvery numerous, amounting in all to over 3000.\nAre these 3000 scripts entirely independent of each\nother ? If, as I believe to be the case, there are coin-\ncidences between the scripts that cannot properly be\nattributed to chance or to normal knowledge : in other\nwords, if what we call cross-correspondences exist, then it\ncannot be said of these 3000 or more scripts that they\nare entirely independent of each other.\nThe published cases of cross-correspondence are not,\nhowever, very mxmerous ; and even if the far more\nnumerous unpublished cases were taken into account as\nwell, it might yet be urged that after all they establish\n^ As a matter of fact before the War began Mrs. King took many of\nwhat later proved to be references to the War to be references, though\nabsurdly exaggerated ones, to the linancial dillicuUies in which sjrr.e\nfriends of hers were involved at the time.\n\f444 J. G. Piddington. [part\nonly occasional and spasmodic connexions between the\nscripts of the various automatists. That argument would\nhave considerable force if each script of each individual\nautomatist were really a separate, isolated thing. But\nthat is not the case. Already in papers published in\nProceedings plenty of instances will be foimd where two\nor three, or half a dozen or more scripts of a single\nautomatist have been shown to form one connected\ngroup ; and now that we have had time to make a\nmore thorough-going study of the scripts, we can assert\nwith confidence that the scripts of each automatist are\nnot independent units, or fall now and again into small\ninter-connected groups, but that the entire output of each\nautomatist is made up of long series of connected groups.\nThese groups may, or may not, be in turn interconnected :\non that question I am not touching for the moment ;\nnor am I now claiming even that these long inter-\nconnected groups form intelligible wholes. The point\nI am stressing at the moment is this : namely, that\nwhether one of the automatists has produced 50 or 1000\nscripts, these scripts are not 50 or 1000 isolated units,\nbut fall into large groups. This being so, it follows that\nwhile a cross-correspondence between a single script of\nA's and a single script of B's on the face of it establishes\na connexion between these two scripts only, in fact it\nmay involve a connexion between a large group of A's\nand a large group of B's. And so it comes about that\na comparatively small number of cross-correspondences may\neffect very far-reaching links between the scripts of\ndifferent automatists, and create between them a far\ndeeper unity than the evidence published so far might\nsuggest.\nThe elements, i.e. the separate scripts, that form a\ngroup are not necessarily found close together in time :\nthey may be separated from each other by months or\nyears. What, then, constitutes the connecting link be-\ntween one script and another ? There are different\nkinds of links. The clearest and most certain links\nare\n(a) the repetition of a topic : e.g. the story of Siegfried ;\n\fLXXXVIT.] Introduction. 445\n(b) an explicit reference back to an earlier script.^\nThe next clearest link is the repetition of distinctive\nwords, names or phrases. These are sometimes quite\nmeaningless, mere nonsense words or names, such as\n\" Name,\" \" Overton Charlie,\" \" Memrint,\" \" Smerincon,\"\n\" Thringle.\" But many are not of this unintelligible\ncharacter : e.g. \" More suo quisque agat,\" \" Beneath an\nalien sky,\" \" The everlasting snows,\" \" Spissa cohors,\"\n\" Per tenebras,\" \"the bended knee.\" Finally, a link is\noften made between two or more scripts by the repetition\nof a quotation, or by the quotation of some phrase or\nline from some poem or literary passage from which a\ndifferent quotation has been made before. But this form\nof link presents difficulties, because quotations from\nliterary passages are not used in a consistent manner.\nThey are made to serve more than one purpose. Thus,\nalthough there are many quotations from Tennyson's Ode\non the Death of the Duke of Wellington which are no\ndoubt meant to be read together and to be taken as\nreferences to the subject of that Ode, it does not follow\nthat every quotation from the Ode should be put together,\nfor if the communicators wanted to make an allusion to\nthe Pyrenees and could not effect the allusion otherwise,\nthey would not hesitate to use the line in the Ode\n\"Beyond the Pyrenean pines\"\nfor that purpose. Obviously this double use of literary\nquotations is likely to mislead, aiid one cannot therefore\n1 Cf., for instance, \" Now you have it\u2014part was said last night \" in\nM.V. 419 ;\n\" Peace on high summits look back at tliat \" in M.V. 535,\nthe reference being to a phrase in a script written ten years earlier ;\n\" Some time back I said you wanted a four-leaved clover \" in M.V.\n694 ;\n\" What was the date of the first script which responded to\nHelen's remark about the thread and the spinning\u2014The web of our\nlife is your Vjirthday motto\u2014Look back at that \" in iM.V. 351 ;\n\" far\nfrom the madding crowd look back to that in H.V. 267 ;\n\" a suminer's\nnight\u2014we spoke of that before\"' in H.V. 333; \"this |is] part of the\nsame story that we wrote before\u2014it will all be jslaitr in time \" in\nH.V. 345 ;\npassages where there is one pine should be distinguislied\nfrom passages where there are two or more \" in H.V. 491 ;\n\" when it\nwas written flames of fire that meant the fire on the hearth ''\nin H.V.\n494.\n\f446 J. G. Piddington. [part\nrely on what may be called \" quotation-links \" with as\nmuch confidence as on the other kinds of links previously\nmentioned. Single lines are occasionally taken from a\npoem merely because they express a particular idea or\nintroduce some particular words, and the immediate\ncontext of these lines and the rest of the poem are to\nbe disregarded. Thus, for instance, Mrs. Salter's scripts\nhave repeatedly quoted\n\" The night in her silence.\nThe stars in their calm\n\"\nfrom Matthew Arnold's Empedocles on Etna ;\nand, as\nthere had been other quotations from this poem in Mrs.\nSalter's scripts and also an explicit mention in Mac\nscripts of \" Empedocles who gazed in the seething crater,\"\none was naturally inclined to connect therewith the\nvarious occurrences of\n\"The night in her silence.\nThe stars in their calm.\"\nYet this synthesis would have been wrong, as is shown\nby the following extract from a script of Mrs. Salter's in\nwhich \" The night in her silence \" appeared for the\neighth time :\n,\nthe paths of glory [lead but to the grave]\u2014the darkness\nof the grave\u2014we have used the Elegy [i.e. Gray's Elegy\nhi a Country Churchyard] as one of the keys\u2014we find\nthat in this case [i.e. in Mrs. Salter's case] at least we\ncan get nearer what we want by drawing on very familiar\npassages of Hterature\u2014sometimes the context is relevant\n& sometimes the words are merely words\u2014it is not easy\nalways to make it clear which\u2014Now with the night in\nher silence etc. the important words are silence & calm\n\u2014\nnothing else matters much\u2014the chief point is silence.\n\" The night in her silence,\" then, is not to be taken either\nas a reference to the story of Empedocles or to the\nimmediate context in which the words occur in Matthew\nArnold's poem. Nevertheless in a very large number of\n\fLXXXVIT.] Introduction.\ncases a quotation from a passage in literature is meant\nto imply its context as well.\nI said above that one of the two clearest links between\nscripts is the repetition of a topic, and I gave as an\nexample the story of Siegfried. But here, too, it is not\nalways plain sailing ; for it is often exceedingly difficult to\nrecognise a topic when it is repeated. Of course if\nSiegfried's name or, say, Fafner's, or the name of some\nother character prominent in the story is mentioned, the\nreference to the Siegfried story is easily recognised. But\nthe problem is often not so simple as that, for allusion\nmay be made to some detail in the Siegfried story mthout\nany exphcit mention of Siegfried or of anything likely to\nsuggest Siegfried. This is the kind of thing that happens :\nFirst there will be a plain mention of the sword of\nSiegfried ; then a month or two later wiU come a reference\nto the divine armour of Achilles ; next a year or so\nlater the script will say that the shield of Achilles is to\nbe compared with the sword of Siegfried ; then some\nyears later a reference to Achilles' armour will be followed\nby a reference to \" Unter den linden \" and the rustling\nof leaves ; and then, finally, will come a reference to\nSiegfried listening to the voice of the bird which tells\nhim of the fire-guarded Brynhilde. Now clearly the\nAchilles and the Siegfried stories are combined, and the\ncombination is natural enough ; but why the rustling of\nleaves is combined with Achilles remains obscure until one\nis led perhaps by the last reference to Siegfried listening\nto the bird in the depths of the forest to look up Wagner's\nOpera and to find that before Siegfried listens to the\nbird he listens also to the rustling of the leaves as he\nlies beneath the linden trees. If that kind of thing hap-\npened now and again, chance or ingenuity would no doubt\nbe a sufficient explanation ; but as a matter of fact it\nhappens again and again, and far too often for either\nexplanation to hold good.\nThere is one other difficulty attaching to what may be\ncalled \" topic links.\" The earliest emergences of a topic\nare often very obscure or sketchy. One instance has been\nquoted by Mr. Bayfield in Proc, Vol. XXVII., pp. 479-480 ;\n\f448 J. G. Piddingiou. [part\nand I repeat it here because it is typical and easy to\nset forth. Three of the automatists have independently\nquoted from a Nursery Rhyme or Poem called The Fairy\nShip. The references to it in Mrs. Salter's scripts eventu-\nally came out quite unmistakeably ; but her first two\nattempts, which I give below, were very wide of the\nmark : ^\nA fairy boat in the moonlight & a star at the prow and a\nmast of silver but the sails are furled (Dec. 16, 1907) ;\nand\nA knife a carving knife three l>lind mice a single\nthread (Dec. 15, 1908).\nTlie topic is then dropped completely for over five years,\nwhen it reappears in the following manner :\na golden boat {drairiiu\/ of a crescent 7)ioon) there is a\npoem\u2014somtthing about the moon & a golden boat (Jan.\n21, 1914) ;\nthe golden boat\u2014something about tlie masts being of\nsilver\u2014it is an EngUsh poem\u2014we have tried to quote it\ntwice before\u2014to sail on the sea\u2014last night the moon had\na. silver rim\u2014three blind mice\u2014yes wi'ite it down\u2014I wish\nyou could find that poem (Jan. 28, 1914) ;\nthe masts were all of silver\u2014the crew were mice (Feb. 4,\n1914).\nThese later indications enabled me to trace the poem,\nwhich is about a Fairy 8hip with sails of satin and a\nmast of gold, and a crew of fifty little white mice. I told\nMrs. Salter that I had identified the poem, and her script\naccepted the identification and explained that the mice\nwere mentioned merely in order to identify the ship.\nNow as there is no mention in the poem either of the\nmoon or of a star or of three blind mice, it will, I think,\nbe admitted that the first emergences of this topic of the\nFairy Ship were both obscure and sketchy, and that but\nfor the subsequent additions would have remained un-\nintelligible. The case is very far indeed from being an\nisolated or excej)tional one ; the scripts are full of similar\n\fLXXXVII.] Introchiction. 449\ninstances, and nothing is to my mind more remarkable\nin the scripts of the avxtomatists than the persistency\nwith which obscure and embryonic allusions are followed\nup, modified and added to, the wrong points eliminated\nand the right ones emphasised, until at long last the topic\noriginally aimed at but at first imperfectly represented\nemerges in a clear and unmistakeable form. This process\nmay extend over many years, and is evidence of amazing\npatience and perseverance on somebody's part. It like-\nwise illustrates the remarkable tenacity of the script\nmemory, for it often involves the repetition of little\ncatch-words from a script written, it may be, many years\nearlier and perhaps never seen again by the automatist.\nThe script-memory is not absolutely faultless, but it is\nnearly so.\nAs I have just used the phrase \" the script -memory,\"\nI may at this point remark in passing that I shall speak\nin this paper of \" communicators \" and \" communications.\"\nI adopt these terms partly because I really beheve that\nthe scripts are influenced by the group of dead persons\nwho profess to be the communicators ; but chiefly for\nconvenience' sake : it being so much simpler to use these\nsimple terms than to use cumbrous non-committal peri-\nphrases like \" the inteUigence responsible for the script.\"\nAt the same time it must be understood that what I have\nsaid about the methods employed in scripts and the\nsystem of linking one script to another and about the\nscript -memory is not affected by the question of the\nprovenance of the scripts. What I have said on these\nsubjects holds good whether the scripts are influenced by\nthe dead, or whether they are solely the work of some\nstratum of the automatist 's consciousness, or whether they\nare a joint product.\nWhat Mrs. Willett has called \" cribbing \" is another\nmethod that requires mention. By cribbing \" is meant\nthe repetition by one automatist of some phrase or quota-\ntion which she has come across in the script of another\nautomatist. In accordance wdth the instructions of \" the\ncommunicators,\" most of Mrs. Verrall's, most of Mrs.\nSalter's, and all of Mrs. Holland's scripts have from time\n\f450 J. G. Piddingion. [part\nto time been shown to Mrs. Willett, who has also been\nsupplied with translations of the Greek and Latin words\nor sentences that occur in them. Mrs. Verrall saw many\nof Mrs. Salter's scripts, and Mrs. Salter has seen a good\nnumber of Mrs. Verrall's ;\nand, of course, all the auto-\nmatists have, or may have, seen such scripts as have\nbeen printed in the Proceedings or the Journal. Mrs.\nSidgwick has drawn up with great care a complete list\nin tabular form of all the scripts seen by, or accessible\nto, each automatist, with the dates at which they were\nseen or became accessible. By reference to this list one\ncan tell at a glance when distinctive coincidences between\nthe scripts of different automatists are, or may have been,\ndue to normal causes.\nIt is only, I think, in the case of Mrs. Willett that the\nscripts of other automatists were shown on the instructions\nof the \"communicators.\" In the other cases, the \"com-\nmunicators \" may or may not have approved ; but at\nany rate they raised no objections. Their object in\ngetting the scripts of other automatists shown to Mrs.\nWillett was to save effort. Instead of having laboriously\nto instil into her mind by supernormal means many of\nthe literary allusions, quotations, and phrases which form\nthe symbolic apparatus of the other automatists, they\nadopted the easier method of letting her become\nacquainted with them in a normal manner. At first\nsight this proceeding might appear to be a risky one\nfrom an \" evidential \" point of view ; but though I do\nnot claim that it has no disadvantages, it is far less\nrisky than might be supposed ;\nfor, thanks to the sym-\nbolic and cryptic character of the scripts, in the huge\nmajority of cases a script can be shown with impunity\nto the most intelligent person without the smallest risk\nof its hidden meaning being revealed to him, unless he\npossesses the clue to its symbohsm. A few of Mrs. King's\nscripts were known to Mrs. Verrall, but with that excep-\ntion none but the few King scripts pubhshed in Proceed-\nings have been seen by the other automatists.\nThe \" cribbing \" method has been fairly often used to\neffect a link between scripts. Thus, if, while automatist\n\fLXXXVII.] Introduction. 451\nA is writing a script, AZ, it is desired to make a link\nbetween AZ and a script of 5's, BY, which has been\nseen by A, the Unk is made by the introduction into\nAZ of a distinctive phrase out of BY.\nOn one further point I must touch before coming to\nthe new matter which I have to set forth ;\nand that is\nthe question of why the cryptic method is employed at\nall. Why, for instance, if the scripts want to talk about\na coming war, don't they talk about it in plain terms\nthat would be understood by any one at first sight?\nOr what's the point of referring to legendary characters\nlike Achilles and Siegfried ? Or why, in the sacred name\nof common sense, should reference be made to a Nursery\npoem about a Fairy Ship, whose\n\" Captain was a duck\nWith a jacket on his back ;\nAnd when the ship set sail,\nThe Captain he said Quack, Quack, Quack \" ?\nI suggest that the cryptic and symbolic methods of the\ncommunicators are due in the main to two causes : one\nbeing that they could not usually be explicit even if\nthey wanted to be ; the other, that they wish to conceal\ntheir meaning from the automatists and to conceal it at\nany rate for a time from those who study the scripts.\nAs regards the first cause, I think it is practically\ncertain that except on rare occasions, and then only in\nthe case of some of the automatists and not in that of\nall, it is not possible to communicate in plain, direct\nlanguage. There is abundant evidence to show that in\na large number of cases the communicators reach their\ndesired goal by making use of associations of ideas that\nexist in the minds of the automatists. They cannot, of\ncourse, entirely control these associations ; but on the\nwhole they do succeed in directing them into such\nchannels as best serve their ends. This method obviously\ninvolves a good deal of tmsting and turning ; and there\nis necessarily a residuum of mere transitional phrases\nwhich has to be eliminated. In these circumstances it\nis evident that plain statements cannot be expected.\n\f452 J. G. Piddington. [part\nI do not mean either that the whole process can be\nobserved in every script, or that every idle and un-\nessential association of ideas gets written in the script.\nBnt the process can be inferred from what is observable\nin certain cases. Let me suppose that the communicator\nhas been wanting to introduce into a script a preliminary\nreference to the Scene in the First Part of Faust called\nthe Witches' Kitchen. He knows that in all probability\nhe will not be able to do so in a direct fashion, and\nso bides his time till he shall chance to find present in\nthe automatist's normal consciousness some idea which\nby, so to speak, a slight jjush he will be able to deflect\ninto the desired channel. One day he discovers the idea\nof \" Devil's Kitchen \" in an automatist's mind, this\nparticular automatist having recently read in the news-\npaper of the death by accident of Mr. Arthur Reid at\nthe Devil's Kitchen, near Bethesda in Wales. The result\nof the communicator's push can be seen in the first\nscript written by the automatist after she had seen the\nreport of the accident in the newspaper. It opens thus :\nCosham. Bethesda. Witches\u2014Witches Hitchin Kitchen\n\u2014\nRead\u2014Wales\u2014Reid.\nTliat is an extract from one of Mrs. Holland's scripts, and\nit is the only script of hers which mentions Witches.\nThis, the first and only reference in Holland script to\nWitches, has another interest, for it occurred in the first\nscript written by Mrs. Holland after the first reference to\nWitches had occurred in Mrs. Salter's scripts. The way\nin which the reference in Mrs. Salter's script emerged\nwill serve as a good example of a slightly different form\nof the indirect approach to a desired idea common to all\nthe scripts and especially frequent in Mrs. Salter's. It\nemerged in this way :\nToadstools green and yello\\\\' ou a mossy bank the\nwitches\" brew.\nHere, so far as I know, there is no reason for supjjosing\nthat Mrs. Salter's thoughts had recently been bent upon\ntoad-stools. They may have been, of course ; but toad-\n\fLXXXVII.] Introduction. 453\nstools may have appeared in her script either as the\nresult of direct suggestion from the communicator, who\nfound himself able to impress this idea vipon her mind\nand thought he could easily lead her on from it to the\nidea of witches ; or \" toadstools \" may be the first im-\nperfect apprehension by the automatist of the idea of\nWitches with which the communicator was seeking to\nimpress her.\nI began my first illustration of the process by which\nideas attain expression in the scripts by supposing that\nthe communicator wanted to work in a preliminary,\nembryonic reference to the Witches' Kitchen in Goethe's\nFaust, and showed how in my opinion he did this in a\nscript of Mrs. Holland's. Let me now suppose that the\ncommunicator wishes to continue the Faust topic and to\nintroduce it into the script of an automatist who has had\nno previous allusion to that topic. He proceeds in this\ninstance on the same lines as he did when he made use\nof Mrs. Holland's reading of the newspaper account of the\naccident at the Devil's Kitchen. Mrs. Willett has recently\nbeen reading the volume of Myers's poems called The\nRenewal of Youth. Nothing, of course, could afford an\neasier transition to the story of Faust than the words\n\" the Renewal of Youth \" : so easy indeed is the tran-\nsition that, as will be seen when I quote the relevant\nextract from Mrs. Willett's script, the automatist at first\nappears to have arrived at the Faust topic per saltuvi,\nand only on second thoughts retraces her course and\nleaves a record of the bridge whereby she made the\ncrossing. The extract from Willett script is as follows :\nMephistof No The ReneAval of Youth Yes Faust.\nIt is, of course, possible that the automatist got the idea\nof Mephistopheles first of all, and that it was the thought\nof Faust's compact Avith Mephistopheles that brought back\nto her mind .the title of the volume of poems she had\nbeen reading ; but there are enough analogous cases in\nthe scripts where the transitional idea has got recorded\nout of place\u2014that is to say, after instead of before the\nidea to which it had led\u2014to make me fairly confident\n\f454 J. G. Piddington. [PABT\nthat it was the recently read Reneival of Youth that\nsuggested Faust and Mephistopheles and not vice versa.\nSo far I have illustrated only how a single desired\ntopic may be reached. But scripts do not as a rule\nconsist of a single topic ;\nthey usually consist of a com-\nbination of two or more topics. The second topic is, or\nappears to be, very often introduced fer saltum, and\nwithout any transition by means of associations of ideas.\nI think it really often is so, and that when once an\nautomatist is under way it is easier for the communicator |\nto go ahead and impress his ideas directly on her. But j\noften too, I suspect, the ideas that have served as a\nmeans of transition, though they have really passed\nthrough the automatist's mind, have not got recorded ;\n\u2014 j\nthe automatist possibly realising in some vague fashion\nthat they were not deserving of record. Nevertheless\nthese \" bridges,\" if I may so call them, do often appear\nin the record. Let me illustrate what takes place by an j\nimaginary example. The communicator, we will suppose,\nwants to combine the Faust topic with the topic of Dido\nand Aeneas. He will very likely achieve his purpose by\nmeans of literary associations somewhat in this wise :\nThe witches' brew\u2014spells and potions\u2014Faust\u2014the en-\nchanted herbs that did renew old Aeson ^\n\u2014In such a night\nthe moon shines Ijright\u2014In such a night stood Dido with\na willow in her hand ^\n\u2014That's better.\nAnd then let us suppose that he wants to go on to\ncombine with the Faust and with the Dido and Aeneas\ntopics the Siegfried topic. In that case the script will\ncontinue something like this :\nIn such a night stood Dido with a willow in her hand\u2014\n\u2022\nThat's better\u2014The willow tree\u2014under the shade of the\nwillow\u2014and the linden shade too\u2014Who lay under the\nlinden trees ?\nBut, it may be objected, in your first instance where you\ncombined the Faust topic with the Dido and Aeneas I\n1 Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice, Act V., Sc. i.\n^ See above, p. 447, for Siegfried lying under the linden trees,\n\fLXXXVII.] Introduction\n.\n455\ntopic, you had to introduce the allusion to Medea renewdng\nold Aeson, and how is one to tell that the Medea and\nAeson story is not only an unimportant but an entirely\nirrelevant excrescence ? An answer to this objection has\nbeen given in the scripts, not in response to our enquiries\nbut spontaneously. It is to this effect : that the essential\ntopics are distinguished by emphasis and by reiteration,\nand that the unessential and irrelevant associations and\ntransitional phrases can be recognised by their not being\nemphasised or repeated. Thus in my imaginary instance\nthe idea that was really wanted, namely \" In such a\nnight stood Dido with a willow in her hand,\" is not only\nemphasised by the addition of the words \" That's better,\"\nbut it would be repeated at least once in a later script,\nand very likely much oftener than once ; whereas the\nidea that was not really wanted, except in so far as it\nserved as a means of transition, namely \" the enchanted\nherbs that did renew old Aeson,\" is not emphasised and\nwould not reappear in later scripts.\nIf such methods as these are largely employed, and I\nhave no doubt that they are, it almost inevitably follows\nthat the communications are of a cryptic character,\nwhether the communicators wish them to be or not. But\nI have already suggested that the communicators intended\nthe communications to be in the main cryptic. We do\nnot pretend to understand all the scripts, but we do under-\nstand enough to realise that they contain matter of so\nprivate a character that it cannot be published for a long\ntime to come ; and we understand enough to appreciate\nwhy the communicators may have thought it wise to\nconceal tlieir meaning for a considerable period from the\ninvestigators and essential to conceal it from the auto-\nmatists until their task is completed. In deciding now\nto divulge something of the contents of the scripts we\nhave been guided by the consideration that the matter\ndivulged is not of a private character but concerns public\nevents.\nMy surmise that the communicators wished to hide\ntheir meaning for a time from the investigators as well\nas from the automatists is not, so far as I can remember,\n\f456 J. G. Piddington. [part\nsupported by any explicit assertion in the scripts them-\nselves, though there is a good deal to suggest that they\ndid so desire. That they meant to hide their meaning\nfrom the automatists is undoubted ;\nand, besides the con-\nfidential nature of a great part of the communications,\nthey had the best of reasons for keeping the automatists\nin the dark. It must be borne in mind that though\nsome of the automatists sometimes go into trance, the\ngreat bulk of the scripts has been produced when they\nhave been in a state little removed from the normal.\nAlthough there is probably always some degree of dis-\nsociation, the cleavage is generally of too slight a nature\nto prevent them from being put on the alert if the name\nof someone known to them emerges, or tries to emerge,\nin the script ; or if something is said which would seem\nto them when in a normal state improbable or incredible.\nIt is certain that the automatists inhibit, some more and\nsome less, but all to some extent. Several jib in par-\nticular at the mention of real persons. Others, Mrs.\nVerrall particiilarly, fight shy of anything that seems like\nan attempt at prophecy. Mrs. Salter on one occasion-\nhaving apparently shown reluctance to write down a\nparticular quotation in a particular context is reproached\nby the communicator in the folloAving terms :\nnever mind if you don't see the connexion\u2014put down\neverything you sometimes let your literary tastes hamper\n\u2014this is not a book of the hundred best quotations.\nMrs. Willett is told not to keep on saying to herself\n\" what awful bosh this is,\" and similarly to Mrs. Verrall\nare addressed the words : \"no don't say '\nobvious non-\nsense.' \" From these examples it is clear that the auto-\nmatists are reluctant to set down, not only what appears\nto them to be improbable or incredible or of the\nnature of a prophecy, but also what strikes them as\nnonsensical. Nor are these inhibitions to be wondered\nat, for the automatists whose scripts I am discussing are\npeople of rather exceptional intelligence, not in the least\ncredulous or silly, but well-educated, sensible, critical\nand sceptical, and distrustful of their powers\u2014not always\n\fLXXXVII.] Introduction. 457\ndistrustful, of course, because, if they were, they would\nprobably never produce anything of value, but apt to be\nbeset -with misgivings as to the genuineness or value of\ntheir scripts.\nThe communicators would, I am convinced, have failed\ngrievously had they attempted as a general rule to convey\ntheir messages in plain language through siich automatists\nas these.^ As a general rule, I say ; for that they can\nsometimes with some of the automatists, if not all, employ\nvery plain language is certain. But in the main, as\nI have said and repeat, their chief method of com-\nmunication is symbolic and cryptic.\nThe point in these introductory remarks on which\nI wish to lay the chief stress is the one about the linking\ntogether of scripts by means of the repetition of topics\nand of distinctive words, phrases and quotations. And\non this subject I have one more word to say in order to\nforestall an objection which is almost certain to suggest\nitself to many readers. Is there any reason for supposing\nthese so-called links to be purposive ? May they not be\nmerely vain repetitions without purpose and design 1\nI cannot here produce the evidence, the very voluminous\nand detailed evidence, on which I rely to meet this\nobjection ;\nand must confine myself to stating the con-\nclusion at which we have arrived after long study of the\nscripts. Not once or twice, but again and again it has\nbeen found that if scripts containing common hnks are\nput together, although on the face of them they have\nnothing in common except these links, they make sense\nwhen the proper clue is found. And here I must define\nwhat I mean by \" make sense,\"' and by \" the proper\nclue.\" By \" they make sense \" I mean one or both of\ntwo things : various phrases, names of persons or places,\nquotations, drawings, etc., found in a group of linked\nscripts, which are apparently but a mere jumble, will be\nfound united in some literary passage, the coincidences\nwith the passage being far too exact and distinctive to\nbe due to chance. If that happened once or twice,\nchance might be a sufficient explanation ; but when it\n^ See King 46, on p. 466 helow.\n\f458 J. G. Piddington. [part\nhappens scores of times, and when the longer the study\nof the scripts is pursued the larger grows the number of\nsuch coincidences, design becomes a certainty. Or, if a\ngroup of linked scripts does not find its interpretation in\na literary passage, then it may find it in real events\nunknown to the automatists but known to the investi-\ngators. But often there is a twofold applicability : that\nis to say, the disjecta viemhra found in a group of linked\nscripts prove to be fragments of a literary passage, and\nthis literary passage proves to have meaning when applied\nto real events unknown to the automatists. Sometimes\nit happens that we realise the applicability of the united\nfragments to the real event before we realise that they\nalso fit a literary passage. Sometimes, and more fre-\nquently, we discover the literary passage without seeing\nto what real event it applies. Thus one of the most\nfrequently repeated links in Mrs. Verrall's scripts is the\nGreek letter Sigma, often united with a reference of one\nkind or another to a spiral. These \" Sigma \" scripts had\nlong puzzled us, and it was not till 1914 that I found\nan explanation\u2014a partial explanation, that is to say\u2014of\nthem. They are based upon two literary passages : one\na passage in Fors Clavigera and the other a Fragment of\none of the Greek dramatists. That these two literary\npassages do lie behind these \" Sigma \" scripts is certain ;\nbut why the commiuiicators should have wished to refer\nto these two passages was an entire mystery to us all\nuntil a year or more later, when, for the first time, we\nwere informed of a fact known to only a very small\nnumber of living persons. Of the few to whom the fact\nwas known Mrs. Verrall was most certainly not one. In\nother cases Avhere the literary basis of the allusions in\nscripts has been traced, the inner meaning remains un-\nintelligible ; but from our past experience we feel con-\nsiderable confidence that they are not mere literary\nconundiiims, but are generally intended to have a bearing\non the subject of the communications. I say \" generally\n\"\nbecause there are exceptions to this rule. An important\nexception is the \" Ear of Dionysius \" case. Here we\nhave an instance of a literary conundrum which has no\n\fLXXXVII.] Introduction. 459\nbearing on the general subject of the communications\n;\nthough even so, it is not a hterary conundrum pure and\nsimple, because one of the objects of the conundrum is\nto furnish evidence of the identity of the professing\ncommunicator, A. W. Verrall.\nIt must not be thought that all the literary passages of\nwhich use is thus made in the scripts are drawn from\nworks so well known and easily accessible as Ruskin's\nFors Clavigera or Gray's Elegy or Tennyson's Ode on the\nDeath of the Duke of Wellington. Many such well-known\nworks are utilised ; but some are taken from out-of-the-\nway books, or from little-known passages of writers who\nmay not be obscure but who are little read.

I had, however, wrongly assumed\nthat the naval movements were public property by the time\nthis script was written, and that \" the futile effort of the\nfleet\" was Mrs. King's comment on the matter. The words\nin question may be an allusion to these incidents ;\nbut if they\nare, they cannot be attributed to Mrs. King's normally acquired\nknowledge of them, for, so far as I can discover, the earliest\ndate on which rumours of the naval movements got about was\nMarch 21, or 22, 1914.

See Annual Register, p. 57.\nMarch 23, 1914.\nThe Times publishes the statement authorised by Mr.\nAsquith.\nThe Times of this date contains the first mention I have\ntraced of the movements of the fleet ; but from the\nauthorised statement it would appear that rumours had\nbeen circulating earlier, and may have appeared in the\nSunday newspapers of March 22, and possibly in the\nevening papers of March 21, 1914.\nIn reply to my enquiries Mrs. King informed me on August\n18, 1922, that she had never connected the opening phrases\nof K. 136 with the \" Ulster plot,\" or with Ireland at all.\nAfter the war began she thought \" the futile effort of the\nfleet \" might possibly be an obscure reference to some attempt\nof the German fleet. And she states that she does not for a\nmoment believe that she heard any rumours of the fleet being\nordered to Lamlash before they were mentioned in the news-\npapers.\nIf the coincidence between K. 136 and the orders given to\nthe Third Battle Squadron is not fortuitous, the only certain\nconclusion that I feel justified in drawing is that Mrs. King\ndid not extract her information, either in a normal or a\nsupernormal manner, from the Prime Minister.\nSee footnote (20) above. gee footnote (59) above.\n\fLxxxvii.] War References in Pre-War King Scripts. 487\nyou need not fear 0 love 0 life\n0 time.

If King 198 was\ninfluenced at all by the automatist's normal knowledge of any\ncurrent events, I should be rather inclined to look for that\ninfluence in the Buckingham Palace Conference on the Irish\ncrisis.

The immediate context of \" Lusitania\n\"\nin K. 118, viz. \"foam and fire\u2014mest [s^c] the funnel,\"\nshows conchisively that it is the vessel of that name that\nis meant. It is the only name of a ship, except \" The\nPathfinder \" (for which see later), that occurs in the\npre-War King scripts. It will be generally admitted,\nI think, that the appearance of the name twice in these\nscripts, which certainly seem to contain predictions of the\ncoming War, is very odd. But is it more than \" very\nodd \" ? Is there, in other words, more than a chance-coin-\ncidence between the two appearances of \" Lusitania \" in\nMrs. King's scripts of Feb. 20, and May 14, 1914, and\nthe sinking of the Lusitania on May 7, 1915 ? I find\nmyself unable to come to any conclusion. The reasons\nagainst regarding the coincidence as accidental seem to me\nto be these :\n(a)\n\" Lusitania \" occurs twice in a series of scripts which\nfor various reasons appear to contain a good many\npredictions of the Great War, in which the sinking\nof the Lusitania was an event of outstanding\nimportance :\n(6)\n\" Lusitania \" occurs first in a script containing\nseveral phrases (\"let not your heart be troubled,\"\n\" the hght is growing,\" \" the stars sang together,\"\n\" Be joyful all ye lands \") which form part of a\ngroup of references predictive of a Utopia to follow\nthe War ;\n(c) the second occurrence of \" Lusitania \" is immediately\npreceded by a phrase\u2014\" fear is the arch enemy \"\u2014\nwhich, for reasons given in footnote (162) on\n\f500 J. G. Piddington. [PAKT\npre-War King scripts, may be reminiscent of the\nfirst verse of Browning's Prospice and especially of\n\" The post of the foe\nWhere he stands, the Arch Fear in visible form,\"\nand this literary allusion, if really intended, would\nnot be inapj^ropriate to the sinking of the Lusitania.\nOf these three reasons the first appears to me to be by\nfar the strongest.\nThe reasons for regarding the coincidences as accidental\nI should summarise as follows :\n(a) the a priori improbability of foreseeing such an\nevent as the sinking of the Lusitania a year before-\nhand (For further observations on this point see\npp. 601-603 below.) ; and\n(6) there is nothing in the context of either \" Lusitania\n\"\nreference to suggest destruction by an enemy.\n\"Foam and fire\" in King 114, in so far as it\nsuggests anything definite, suggests rather a fire\nbreaking out on board, and the ship sinking and\nawash in the waves as a result of the fire. If \"fear\nis the arch enemy \" is reminiscent of Prospice, it\ncould be perfectly well applied to the passengers\nand crew aboard the burning ship having to meet\ndeath.\nFenchtjech Street.\nThe references to Fenchurch Street occur in the following\nscripts and contexts :\nKing 154. Fenchurch . . .\nKing 155. ... Fenchui'ch St. The underground. In the\nboat are many\u2014the Teuton, the bandaged eyes.\nKing 174. ... Fenchurch Street\u2014the deluge\u2014the noisome\npestilence that walketh by night . . . Shelter O God\nshelter . . .\nThese are the only references in all Mrs. King's scripts to\nFenchurch St., and there is no other reference to \" The\nunderground.\"\n\fLxxxvii.] Note on \" Lnsitania,\" \" Fenchurch Street,\" etc. 501\nIn the summer of 1917 the worst German Air-Raids on\nLondon took place. I have not been able to obtain\ndetailed information about them, but certainly much\ndamage was done on one occasion\u2014and, I fancy, on two\noccasions\u2014to Leadenhall St. and Fenchurch St. and the\nsmall streets lying between them. The stations and\npassages in the Underground Railways were, of course,\nmuch used as shelters during Air-Raids. I am nearly\ncertain that the Air Raid (or Raids) that caused damage\nto Fenchurch St. and its neighbourhood took place in the\ndaytime, and not at night. Accordingly \" the noisome\npestilence that walketh by 7iight \" could not be strictly\napplied to a daylight Raid ; but if\n''\nthe noisome pesti-\nlence \" etc. is regarded as an allusion to the context of\nthese words in Psalm xci. 6, this context would not be\ninappropriate :\nSurely he shall deliver thee . . . from the noisome pesti-\nlence . . . Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by\nnight, nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the\npestilence that walketh in the darkness, nor for the\ndestruction that wasteth at noon-day.\nI I am not for one moment claiming that these three\n\" Fenchurch St.\" scripts do relate to Air-Raids on the\nCity. I confine myself to pointing out coincidences\nbetween phrases in these scripts and facts (or what I\nbelieve to be facts) connected with German Air-Raids on\nthe City, and I leave each reader to form his own opinion.\nShould any reader think the coincidences too close to be\nattributed to chance, he may be inclined to see in the\nwords \" In the boat are many\u2014the Teuton \" an attempt\nto combine a prediction of the sinking of the Lusitania\nwith a prediction of Air-Raids on the City. \" The\nTeuton \" occurs in King 150 and 155 only.\nThe Pathfindek.\nOn September 5, 1914, the light cruiser H.M.S. Path-\nfinder was struck by a torpedo and foundered. This was\nthe second disaster in the War that had befallen the British\n\f502 J. G. Piddington.\nFleet up to that date : the first being the loss of H.M.S.\nAmphion on August 6, 1914.^\nIn King 161 occurs the following :\nThe Pathfinder Die Pfadfinderin cut out a new way for\nthe spirit.\nThese words are sandwiched between what I regard as\na certain reference to the passage from Ruskin's Modern\nPainters quoted on pp. 523-527 below, and one of the\nclearest predictions of the War. If, then, the coincidence\nbetween King 161 and the disaster to H.M.S. Pathfinder\nis not accidental, the context on both sides is markedly\nsuggestive : much more suggestive than are the contexts\nof \" Lusitania \" and \" Fenchurch St.\"\nA strong\u2014but not, I think, a conclusive\u2014argument\nagainst the coincidence being due to foreknowledge can be\nbased on the fact that \" The Pathfinder \" is followed by\n\" Die Pfadfinderin \" : the latter being the original title of\na story by Paul Heyse, which Mrs. King had once trans-\nlated into English. When I asked her about the story,\nshe coidd not remember it in detail, but she did remember\nthat it was about a woman of unconventional type ; and\nshe thought that the words that follow \" Die Pfad-\nfinderin,\" viz. \" cut out a new way for the spirit,\" might\nrepresent her vague recollection of the story. In any\ncase \" cut out a new way for the spirit \" seems to carry\non the idea expressed in the phrases that immediately\nprecede \" The Pathfinder. Die Pfadfinderin,\" viz. :\nlift up your eyes 0 ye daughters of men heed not the\nclamour of the world\u2014wield aloft the mighty arms of your\nwondering spirit.\nThe occurrence of \" The Pathfinder \" may consequently\nbe accounted for on normal hues ; and such an explana-\ntion will doubtless satisfy many, particularly those who\n1 See Journal, Vol. XVI., pp. 306 ff. and Proc. Vol. XXXIII., pp. 352-\n353, for two dreams of a sinking ship, experienced by the same percipient,\nthe first occurring 13 lionrs after the sinking of H.M.S. Amphion, and the\nsecond near the time that H.M.S. Pathfinder sank. Since the accoimt\nof these dreams was published in Proceedimjs we have been informed\nthat the Pathfinder was torpedoed, and not sunk by a mine.\n\fLxxxvii.] Nvte on \" Lusitania,\" \" Fenchurch Street,'\" etc. 503\nhave made no study of automatism. But those famiUar\nwith the mental processes displayed in scripts will recog-\nnise that the contents of an automatist's normal conscious-\nness often serve to give expression to an idea that is\ntrying to emerge from a subconscious stratum. If, then,\nsome subconscious stratum of Mrs. King's mind was\nendeavouring to exj)ress the idea of H.M.S. Pathfinder, it\nis by no means improbable that the nearest approach to\nsuccessful expression would be a reference to a story\nnormally known to the automatist and bearing the same\ntitle as the ship. Moreover, if some vague connexion\nexisted in the subconscious stratum between H.M.S.\nPathfinder and the Germans, a reference to a German\nstory bearing the same name as the ship might all the\nmore readily be evoked.\nIt may be that, about the dates that \" Lusitania,\"\n\" Fenchurch St.,\" and \" The Pathfinder \" appeared in\nMrs. King's scripts, there were prominent allusions to the\nship, or the cruiser, or the street in the newspapers or\nelsewhere. I know of none ; but should any of my\nreaders come across any, I hope he will inform me.\nThere must, of course, have been announcements of the\nsailings of the Lusitania ; and Fenchurch St. must have\nbeen mentioned in the newspapers, and H.M.S. Pathfinder\nmay have been. To references of this kind, however,\nI am not asking to have my attention drawn, for they\nwould hardly be likely to help in the solution of the\nproblem. The kind of reference I mean is such as could\nreasonably be supposed to have excited Mrs. King's\ninterest. Mrs. King herself is not aware of havmg had\nher notice drawn at or about the dates in question either\nto the Lusitania, or to H.M.S. Pathfinder, or to Fenchurch\nStreet.\n2i\n\f504 J. G.

[part\nCOMPARISON OF PRE-WAR KING SCRIPTS WITH\nTHE SCRIPTS OF OTHER AUTOMATISTS.\nIn the footnotes appended to the pre-War King scripts,\nalthough a certain number of cross-references have been\ngiven to the scripts of the other automatists, attention\nhas been mainly directed to recurrences of the same\nphrase or topic in the King scripts themselves. I now\nproceed to make a more detailed and systematic com-\nparison between the pre-War King scripts and the scripts\nof the other automatists.\nThe simplest way of doing this is to take a topic found\nin the King scripts, to ascertain whether it appears in the\nother scripts, and, if so, in what kind of context ; and\nthen to see whether this context suits its context in the\nKing script.\nIt must be clearly understood that in making these\ncomparisons I am not pretending to deal with all the\noccurrences in other scripts of a topic found in the\npre-War scripts. If I were to do that, this paper would\nattain inordinate dimensions, and the reader would be\nbewildered by the mass of evidence. I am pretending\nonly to give illustrations of how a topic found in the\nKing scripts is treated in the other scripts.\nBefore, however, starting on this task, I must remind\nthe reader of what I said in the Introduction to this\npaper : namely, that the pre-War King scripts are more\nexplicit than the great generahty of the other automatists'\nscripts. He must therefore not be surprised when he\nfinds that the corresponding references in the other scripts\nrequire more comment than do the simpler references in\nKing scripts. The communicators do not pretend as a\ngeneral rule to be able to make definite statements.\nWhat they claim to do is\n\" to get a sequence of associated ideas grouped in\nthe automatist's mind in such a way as to suggest\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparison of Scripts. 505\na certain train of thought or events normally un-\nknown \" (H. V. 325).\nNote the words \" to suggest,\" because they very exactly\ndescribe what really happens. With this suggestive method\n! one cannot expect the matter-of-factness of a legal docu-\nment or of an auctioneer's catalogue. The effect produced\nis not unhke that produced by poetry. A poem may\ncreate an impression which could not fairly be described\nas obscure ; and it may create\u2014and a good poem will\nusually create\u2014a more vivid impression than a piece of\nprose dealing with the same subject. But though the\nimpression may be vivid and not obscure, it will probably\nI not be definite. Were one to try to reduce, let us say,\nI\nShelley's Cloud to matter-of-fact prose, the result would be\nI deplorable or laughable. I do not suggest that the\nscripts soar to such heights as The Cloud reaches : their\ni\nimagery may not scorn the ground quite so airily as that ;\nbut nevertheless it is sufficiently poetical to make the\ntask of reducing its meaning to plain prose a hard matter ;\nand so the reader must not complain if I do not dot all\nthe i's and cross all the fs, and if I leave it to him to\ndo some of the interpretation for himself. To understand\nany but the simplest poems it is usually necessary to read\nthem with care several times at least. So also with\nthese symbolic scripts. If a reader will take the trouble\nt\nto go through them carefully several times, I believe with\neach successive reading he will acquire a deeper insight\ninto their meaning ; but if he has only patience enough\nfor one reading, then, I fear, they will leave on him but\na faint and confused impression.\nThe topics are not all of ec|ual interest or of equal\nevidential value. Those that come first are less interest-\nj\ning than the later ones. But the earlier sections should\nnot be skipped, because I have tried to arrange the topics\nin a sort of logical sequence, so that, as a rule, one leads\n'\non to the next, and so on. The evidence, in fact, is to\na great extent cumulative.\n\f506 \/. G. Pidclington.

It\nseems to be used in more than one sense, and is some-\ntimes applied to the commimicators themselves ; but on\nMarch 5, 1914 (see King 128), when the question \" Do\nyou wish to say anything about [old, unhappy, far ofi\nthings, and] '\nbattles long ago ' ?\n\" was put by Mrs.\nSidgwick to Mrs. King, the response opened with the\nwords :\n\" The banded {or, band of) brothers.\"\nWe may assume, I think, that on this occasion at any\nrate \" the band of brothers \" stands for the Battle of\nAgincourt, and was suggested by the question about\n\" battles long ago.\" I should attach no importance to\nthat, if it stood alone ; but this phrase in Mrs. King's\nanswer to Mrs. Sidgwick's question becomes, perhaps,\nmore significant when compared with the four following\nextracts from Mrs. Verrall's scripts, the first of which was\nwritten the day after the anniversary of St. Crispin's Day,\n1901, and the fourth on St. Crispin's Day, 1915 :\n31.

Part of Blake's de-\n1 There are many allusions in the scripts to Blake's pictures and poems.\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 511\nscription of Behemoth is based on Addison's poem on the\nBattle of Blenheim\n'Twas then great Marlborough's mighty soul was proved,\nThat, in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,\nAmidst confusion, horror, and despair,\nExamined all the dreadful scenes of war :\nIn peaceful thought the field of death surveyed.\nTo fainting squadi'ons sent the timely aid,\nInspired repulsed battalions to engage,\nAnd taught the doubtful battle where to rage.\nSo when an Angel by divine command,\nWith rising tempests shakes a guilty land\n(Such as of late o'er pale Britannia passed).\nCalm and serene he drives the furious blast ;\nAnd, pleased the Almighty's orders to perform.\nRides in the whirlwuid and directs the storm.\n^\nIn describing Pitt as \" ordering the Reaper to reap the\nVine of the Earth,\" Blake is borrowing his imagery from\nRev. xiv. 18-19 :\nAnd another angel came out from the altar, . . . and\ncried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,\nsaying. Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters\nof the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe.\nAnd the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and\ngathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great\nwine-press of the wrath of God.\n\" Thou great Leviathan \" in W. 281\u2014which is, so to\nspeak, corrected by King script to \" Behemoth \"\u2014is\nimmediately followed by a quotation from Ltike xxi. 26 :\nAnd there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon,\nand in the skies ; and upon earth distress of nations, with\nperplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ; Men's hearts\nfailing them for fear, and for looldng after those things\nwhich are coming on the earth.\nIf \" thou great Leviathan \" means, as I suggest, Blake's\n1 Mrs. Salter's scripts contain -what I believe to be several attempts\n\u2014^none quite successful\u2014to quote this last line.\n\f512 J. G. Piddington. [part\nBehemoth, which Blake associated with the passage in\nBev. xiv., it is not difficult to see why it is immediately\nfollowed by\n\" Men's hearts failing them for fear \"\n;\nbecause both Bibhcal passages are concerned with the\nsigns of the coming of God's Judgement upon the earth.\nIn W. 281 \" Men's hearts failing them for fear\n\"\u2014^the\nimmediate context of which is \" the sea and the waves\nroaring \"\u2014is immediately followed by a quotation from\nthe well-known Hymn on the subject of Christ's calming\nof the storm on the Sea of Galilee. If we consider that\n\" the sea and the waves roaring \" immediately precedes in\nthe original \" Men's hearts failing them for fear,\" and that\nthe latter is immediately followed in the script by a\nreference to the Calming of the Storm, we can easily\nunderstand how Leviathan, the sea-monster guided by\nNelson, might be given in mistake for Behemoth, the\nland-monster guided by Pitt.\nThe context in St. Luke's Gospel of \" Men's hearts\nfailing them for fear \" is, of course, parallel to the passage\nin Matthew xxiv. about the signs of Christ's second coming\nand the end of the world, in which occur the words, so\noften quoted in pre-War Bang scripts :\n\" But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.\"\nWith the topic of the Calming of the Storm we shall meet\nseveral times again later on (see pp. 514, 554, 592, 594, 595).\nWhat its precise meaning may be, is not clear. I do not\nthink that it means the end of the War : that is to say,\nthe cessation of military operations in November 1918.\nThe Calming of the Storm appears to be connected in the\nscripts with Christ's walking on the water, and also with\nthe passage in the first book of the Aeneid where Neptune\ncalms the storm for Aeneas. If I had to make a guess\nas to the meaning of these associations, I should con-\njecture that they pointed to a sudden and grave political\ncrisis to end as suddenly as it arose. Some such meaning\nas this would explain why the two incidents in the\nGospels are connected with the passage in Aeneid I.,\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 513\nwhere Neptune calming the sudden storm is compared to\na statesman appeasing a turbulent outburst of the ignobile\nvalgus (cf. Hobbes' use of \" Leviathan,\" and Blake's use\nof \"Behemoth\").\nShould some readers feel a certain unfittingness in the\napphcation of Christ's calming of the storm and of his\nwalking on the sea to political alfairs, I would point out\nthat it has at least the authority of Tennyson, whose\nLady of the Lake\n\" dweUs\nDown in a deep ;\ncalm, whatsoever storms\nMay shake the world, and when the surface rolls\nHath power to walk the waters hke our Lord.\"\n\"THE CROSSED SWORDS.\"\nSee King 92, 178.\nThe phrase \" the Crossed Sivords,\" which presumably\nmeans the sign used to mark on maps the scene of a\nbattle, occurs elsewhere than in King script only once,\nnamely in H.

What is the\nworld which they are to \" fight with,\" and how does it differ\nfrom the world which they are to \" get on in \" ? The ex-\nplanation seems to me the more needful, because I do not, in\nthe book we profess to five by, find anything very distinct\nabout fighting with the world. I fuid something about fighting\nwith the rulers of its darkness,^ and somethmg also about\novercoming it ; but it does not follow that this conquest is to\nbe by hostility, since evil may be overcome with good.^ But\nI find it written very distinctly that God loved the world, and\nthat Christ is the light of it.\n\u00a7 19. What the much-used words, therefore, mean, I cannot\ntell. But this, I believe, they shoidd mean. That there is,\nindeed, one world which is full of care, and desire, and hatred :\na world of war, of which Christ is not the light, which indeed\nis without light, and has never heard the great \" Let there\nbe.\" 3 Which is, therefore, in truth, as yet no world ; but\n^ E'phes. vi. 12.

[part\nwhat has been stated earher, namely, that the Eschato-\nlogical Discourses in the Gospels have been largely drawn\nupon by the communicators, who represent the Great\nWar as the end of a world, a Day of Judgement, and\nthe beginning of a Millennium.\n\" Judge not,\" as the context in the script shows, is a\nreference to Luke vi. 37 rather than to Matt. vii.\n1\n':\nBut love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend,\nhoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great,\nand ye shall be the children of the Highest ; for he is\nkind unto the unthankful, and to the evil.

V. 278). In support of this\nsuggestion she remarked that since her script was written\nshe had discovered that \" Bethesda \" is interpreted by\nsome authorities to mean \" House of Mercy.\"\nBefore passing on to the next script, I would ask the\nreader to bear in mind the reference here to \" the Pool\nof Bethesda,\" as it is a topic found also in pre-War King\nscripts. I shaU deal with it in the next Section.\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 531\nH.

Portia's\nlovers had to make their choice of three chests or caskets,\none of gold, one of silver, and the other of lead. A\nsimilarly odd approach to the play occurs in H. V. 516,\nwhich has \" Mercator \" : it being explained in the next\nscript, H. V. 517, that by \"Mercator\" The Merchant of\nVenice was meant :\nMerchant\u2014 Mercator\u2014the merchant of Venice was meant\n\u2014not merely the play but the idea.\nBy \" the idea \" is meant, no doubt, Portia's plea for\nmercy in opposition to Shylock's insistence on the letter\nof the law. This interpretation is confirmed by \" areo-\npagite,\" which is an allusion to the Court of the\nAreiopagus, and is one of many allusions in the scripts to\nthe Eumenides of Aeschylus.\n\" Eumenides,\" the Kindly Ones, was the name given to\nthe Erinyes, or Avenging Goddesses, after Athene had by\ngentle persuasion softened their pitiless spirit. The follow-\ning passage in Jebb's Introduction to his edition of the\nOedipus Coloneiis of Sophocles not only gives in succinct\nform the story of the Eumenides of Aeschylus, but it wall\nHkewise serve to explain what is meant by \" areopagite\n\"\nhere and by the many allusions in the scripts to Aes-\nchylus' play :\nThe ancient rigour which required that bloodshed,\nwhether dehberate or not, should be expiated by blood,\nwas expressed by the older idea of the Erinyes, the\nimplacable pursuers. The metamorphosis of the Erinyes\ninto the Eumenides corresponds with a later and milder\nsense that bloodshed is compatible with varying degrees of\nguilt, ranging from premeditated murder to homicide in\nseH-defence or by accident. Athenian legend claimed that\n\f532 J. G. Piddington. [part\nthis transformation of the Avengers took place in Attica,\nand that the institution of the court on the Areiopagus\nmarked the moment. The claim was a mythical expres-\nsion of qualities which history attests in the Athenian\ncharacter, and of which the Athenians themselves were\nconscious as distinguishing them from other Greeks. It\nwas Athenian to temper the letter of the law with con-\nsiderations of equity [Tov-n-itLKe.^) ; to use clemency ;\n^ to\nfeel compassion (alSm) for unmerited misfortune ; to shelter\nthe oppressed ; to restrict the sphere of violence ; and to\nsacrifice,\u2014where no other Greeks did,\u2014at the altar of\nPersuasion. This character is signally impressed on the\nOedipus Coloneus, and is personified in Theseus.^ The\nfirst session of the tribunal on the Hill of Ares {i.e. the\nAreiopagus, the \" Mars' Hill \" of Acts xvii. 22] was, in Attic\nstory, ^ the first occasion on which this humane character\nasserted itself against a hitherto inflexible precedent.\nOrestes slew his mother to avenge his father, whom she\nhad slain ; and the Erinyes demanded his blood. He is\ntried, and acquitted,\u2014but not by the Erinyes ;\nby Athene\nand her Athenian court. The Erinyes are the accusers,\nand Apollo is counsel for the prisoner. Then it is,\n\u2014\nafter\nthe acquittal of Orestes,\u2014that Athene's gentle pleading\neffects a change in the defeated Avengers. They cease to\nbe the Erinyes : they become the '\nBenign '\nor '\nMajestic\n'\ngoddesses (' Eumenides,' '\nSemnae '), and are installed, as\nguardian deities of Attica, in a shrine beneath the Areio-\npagus.\n\" Areio'pagite \" is followed by \" Gallileo \" ; but this, as\nthe comment\u2014\" you are wandering \"\u2014shows, is a mistake.\nThe script goes back to \" gold,\" and thence passes to\n\" golden rain from heaven.\" These words, like the earlier\n\" rain from heaven \" in H. V. 419a, are an allusion to\n1 See M. V. 513 and 601, p. 529 above ; and the comments on M. V.\n3099 under \" Vengeance is mine,\" p. 559 below.\n2 After reading the Section entitled \" The Violet Crown,\" cf.

V. 278 above (p. 530) :\n\" for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\"\nIt must not be supposed that these few scripts exhaust\nwhat may be called the Mercy topic. They touch merely\nthe fringe of it, and are given by way of illustration only.\nAnother development of it, as already stated, will be\nfound under the heading of \" Vengeance is mine \"\n(pp.\n554-570 below).\nI drew attention above to the connexion in H. V. 419a\nof \" The quality of mercy \" with \" the pool of Bethesda,\"\n\f534 J. G. Piddington. [part\nbecause there is a reference to the latter in a pre-War\nKing script. It will accordingly be convenient to deal\nwith the topic of the Pool of Bethesda next.\nTHE POOL OP BETHESDA.\nThe reference to the Pool of Bethesda in a pre-War\nKing script is as follows :\nKing 65 (December 1, 1913).\nLet not your heart be troubled Out of great\ntribulation cometh great peace, for when the waters\nhave been troubled an angel stilleth them . . . not one\nof us cares for hegemony\u2014we are all brothers in\nlove\u2014there is no hate among us . . .\nOpen wide your casements to the dawn Blow\nbugles blow Usher in the happy morn . . .\nWith the latter part of this script, from \" not one of\nus cares for hegemony \" down to the end, I have already\ndealt above (pp. 523-527), and shown that it is one of\nseveral allusions to a passage in the last chapter of\nModern Painters.\n\" Let not your heart he troubled \" are the opening words\nof Johii XXV., and are repeated in v. 27 of the same\nchapter :\nPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you :\nnot as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your\nheart be troubled, neither be afraid.\nPerhaps compare the last words of the extract given\nabove (p. 526) from \u00a7 20 of Ruskin's chapter \" Peace \" in\nModern Painters :\nI leave you. to judge, and to choose, between this labour,\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 535\nand the bequeathed peace ; these wages, and the gift of\nthe Mornmg Star.\nBut the reference is not only, I think, to John xiv.\nIn view of the fact that \" Let not your heart be troubled\n\"\nis immediately followed by \" Out of great tribulation cometh\ngreat peace,'' there seems to me to be a reference as weU\nto Matthew xxiv. 6, 20, and 21 :\nAnd ye shall hear of wars, and rumours of wars : see\nthat ye he not troubled : for all these things must come to\npass, but the end is not yet . . .\nBut pray ye that your flight be not m the whiter,\nneither on the sabbath-day : For then shall be great\ntribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the\nworld to this time, no, nor ever shall be.\n\" When the ivaters have been troubled an angel stilleth\nthem.'\" In John v. we read :\nNow there is at Jerusalem ... a pool, which is called\nin the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In\nthese lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of bhnd,\nhalt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For\nan angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and\ntroubled the water : whosoever then fij'st after the troub-\nling of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatso-\never disease he had.\nAlthough the script reverses the metaphor, and makes\nthe angel calm the troubled waters, it can hardly be\ndisputed that a reference is intended to the Pool of\nBethesda.\nWith King 65 compare the following script of Mrs.\nSalter's :\nH.

Parts of the chapter must be\nquoted in order to bring out the close analogy between\nit and the Eschatological Discourses in the Synoptists :\nFor, behold in those days, and in that time, when\nI shaU bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,\nI will also gather all nations, and ^\\all bring them down\ninto the vaUey of Jehoshaphat, and \"will plead with them\nthere for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom\nthey have scattered among the nations, and parted my\nland . . .\nProclaim ye this among the Gentries ;\nPrepare war,\nwake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw\nnear ; let them come up : Beat your plowshares into\nswords, and your pruning-hooks into spears . . .

Mrs. Verrall went to Switzer-\nland early in June 1914, and visited Zermatt, Saas-Grund,\nand\u2014for the last five days\u2014Vermala. On her return\njourney she wrote to me, from Lausanne, on July 1,\n1914, a letter about her stay at Vermala, which is unlike\nany other of the many letters I have received from her\nin connexion with her scripts. It ran thus :\nYou must have been overwhelmed with my Vermala\nscripts, such long things too ...\nI can't now remember much what they were all about,\nbut I have a strong impression that something of iiuport-\nance\u2014in the S.P.R. line, I mean\u2014took place in those\n5 days : it's very odd, and I think my impression may be\nderived from a script\u2014or rather that a script may record\nthe impression. Nor can I say what happened,\u2014only (it\nsounds absurd, but I feel as if I ought to make a note\nof this) something was radically altered between Friday,\nJune 26, and the morning of Tuesday, June 30 ! I think\nit is something in me, but I am not quite sure ! Anyhow\nI woke on Tuesday with the strong feeling that the\npurpose for which '\nthey '\nwanted me to come to Switzer-\nland was now accomplished : for a long time I have, as\nI may have told you, felt that '\nthey '\nwanted me to go\nto the Alps, but tOl Tuesday last (yesterday) I have had\nno special sense of anything going on either in me or\nabout my script. I was in places very familiar to me,\nboth Zermatt and Saas-Grund being old friends. . . .\nVermala is not a place with any special associations, and\nI really went there for no special reason, except that\nwhen my friend, , left me I wanted to be\nsomewhere, and Vermala was a good place for the few\ndays that I meant to stay on.\n\f544 J.

[part\nBut the moment I got there, I felt\u2014as Mrs. W[illett]\nsays when she spots a quotation\u2014that '\nthis was it,' and\nthe impression grew and grew till it left the feeling I have\ndescribed,\u2014or tried to describe\u2014I don't know how to put\nit, but I send this, broken as it is,\u2014so that if I am\nwrecked in a fog on the way home, you may know that\n'\nthey '\nhave been satisfied with me somehow !\nI am not sure that I shall write any more script for\nthe present, as one part of the sensation is that something\nis finished (and the something may be my power of writing\nautomatically !), but I shall try again presently, after I am\nhome again, and of course at once if I have any impulse\n> \u2022 . 9\nThere is a subsequent reference in Mrs. Verrall's script\nof Aug. 22, 1914, to her experience at Vermala, which\ndiscloses what the incident was to which M.

The\nscript ends with references to the City of God, and to\ni\nAthens the City of the violet and olive crown, and with a\n'i\nclear reference back to Mrs. Verrall's script of April 29,\n.i 1907 (M. V. 171), which opens with a quotation from the\npoem to Victor Hugo in which Tennyson looks forward\nto \" that diviner day \" when\nI\n\" England, France, all man to be\nWiU make one people.\"\nBefore quoting the last occurrence of \" the violet\nI\n\f546 J.

Cf. M. V. 148, 171, above. This quotation\nfrom Swinburne's Chorus in praise of Athens is probably meant to form\na link with the context of the quotation made in M.

Sir J. E. Sandys thus\ntranslates them :\n\" Oh ! the gleaming, and the violet-crowned, and the sung in story\n;\nthe bulwark of Hellas, famotis Athens, city divine !\n\"\nSome suppose that the epithet \" violet-crowned \" alludes to the extra-\nordinary purple glow on Hymettus at sunset. Cf. accordingly \" Her-\nmettus [sic], the violet crown \" in King 293 above. This view as to\nthe source of the epithet is not favoured by most scholars ; but anyone\nwho has seen Athens transfigured by this purple glow must, I fancy,\nfind it hard to believe that it did not influence the choice of epithet.\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparisoyi of Scripts. 547\nYou have partly seen the meaning of the Roman\nallusions but the Greek have escaped you I think\n\u2014\nPut them together\n\u2014\nThe city of the violet & olive crown . . .\nHere, as in King 157, we get the union of Athens and\nRome ; and this union is in turn connected with the\nDays of Creation, with which again, as we have seen,\n\" the message in the Alps \" is connected in M. V. 622.\nFor reasons already explained, this \" message in the Alps\n\"\nappears to be closely associated with the occasion when\nMrs. Verrall watched the afterglow on the great Alpine\npeali m the company of a German mother and a French\ngirl ; and when this incident is explicitly mentioned in\nM. V. 637, it is immediately followed by the comment\n:\n\"I have set my bow in the cloiid s.\"\nNo one, I venture to think, can dispute the general\nmeaning of these \" linked \" scripts. Their language is\nsymbolic, it is true, but it can hardly be called cryptic.\nOn the day that England declares war on Germany, Mrs.\nVerrall's script makes another declaration. It declares the\ncoming of a world-wide Peace. And other scripts\u2014some\nearlier, some later\u2014assert that the Great War is but the\nChaos, \" earth without form and void,\" out of which the\nSpirit of God, moving in mysterious ways, will create a\nnew order of things.^\nIf this forecast were confined to Mrs. Verrall's scripts,\nit might, perhaps, be dismissed as a fantastic dream\ncleverly woven by some part of Mrs. Verrall's conscious-\nness out of threads selected from her pre-War scripts.\nBut, as will be seen, when I come to deal (pp. 580-598\nbelow) with the last scripts written by Mrs. Willett and\nMrs. Salter before the outbreak of war and the first\nscripts written by them after its outbreak, their scripts,\ntoo, share the view that the War is the prologue\u2014not to\na catastrophe, nor to a mere victory over enemies, nor\nto a Peace of exhaustion, but\u2014to the healing of nations.\n1 See Ruskin, Modern Painters, \" Peace,\" \u00a7 19, quoted under \" Had\nZimri peace ? \" on pp. 524-525 above.\n\f548 J. G. Piddington. [part\nThis consensus of prophecy\u2014and Mrs. King's scripts\nshare in it\u2014cannot be so Ughtly explained away.\nThe symbolism employed in these \" Violet Crown\n\"\nscripts was probably suggested by the closing passage of\nGilbert Murray's Introductory Essay to his Euripides :\nThe old devotion to Fifth Century Athens, to that\nPrincess of Cities, who had so fearfully fallen and dragged\nher lovers through such blood-stained dust, lived on with\na kind of fascination as a symbol in the minds of these\ndeeply individual philosophers of later Hellenism and Early\nChristianity. But it was no longer a city on earth that\nthey sought, not one to be served by military conquests,\nnor efficient police, nor taxes and public education. It\nwas '\nthe one great city in which all are free,' or it was\nthe city of Man's Soul. '\nThe poet has said,' wites a\nlate Stoic, who had a pretty large concrete city of his\nown to look after, '\nThe poet has said : O Beloved City\nof Cecrops : canst thou not say ; O Beloved City of\nGod ?\n'\nBut though this passage may have supplied the imagery\nof the scripts, the application of the imagery is quite\ndifferent, as M. V. 674 alone is sufficient to show. \" It\nwas no longer a city on earth that they sought,\" says\nGilbert Murray of the philosophers of later, Hellenism ;\n\" here have we no continuing city,\" said the author of\nthe Epistle to the Hebrews, \" but we seek one to come.\"\nThe communicators, on the contrary, affirm the approach-\ning realisation of the hopes expressed in the last Chorus\nof Shelley's Hellas (quoted more than once in the\nscripts ^) :\n\" The world's great age begins anew.\nThe golden years return,\niln W. 326, of Feb. 28, 1914, and H.

These remarks were written in\nignorance, or at any rate in complete forgetfulness, of Shelley's own\nnote on the Chorus in Hellas, which runs thus :\n\" The final chorus is indistinct and obscure as the event of the\nliving drama whose arrival it foretells.\n\" Prophecies of wars, and rumours of wars, etc., may safely be made\nby poet or prophet in any age ; but to anticipate, however darkly, a\nperiod of regeneration and happiness, is a more hazardous exercise of\nthe faculty which bards possess or feign.

[part\n\" THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.\"\nSee King 72.\nThis creation of a new order out of chaos is represented\nin different ways in the scripts : sometimes in Bibhcal\nlanguage ; sometimes by imagery drawn from Norse\nmythology (see e.g. \" a new Asgard \" in King 31 and 38) ;\nand sometimes in terms borrowed from classical writers or\nfrom English poets. Thus in King 72 occurs \" the music\nof the spheres,\" in King 118 \"the stars sang together,\"\nand in King 185 \" the Miltonic metaphor Blest pair of\nSirens.\" With these phrases compare the following extract\nfrom a King script written after the outbreak of war :\nKing 210 {Oct. 27, 1914).\n. . .

The analogy, no doubt, helped\nto facilitate the combination in the scripts of \" Astraea\nredux \" with \"Blest pair of Sirens.\" With the idea\nexpressed in Milton's poem that at the Creation of the\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparison of Scripts. 553\nworld the \" melodious noise \" was audible by earthly\nears and remained audible till the Fall of Man, compare\nKing 118 :\nthe sons of the morning\u2014the stars sang together Be\njoyful aU ye lands,\nwhere the allusion is to Job xxxvlii. 4, 6, and 7 :\nWhere wast thou when I laid the foundations of the\nearth 1 declare, if thou hast understanduig . . . Where-\nupon are the foundations thereof fastened ? or who laid\nthe corner-stone thereof ? When the morning-stars sang\ntogether, and aU the sons of God shouted for joy ?\n\" Be joyful all ye lands,\"' which follows the reference to\nthe Job passage, is from Psalm c, and is important\nbecause its context introduces the topic of \" Mercy and\ntruth,\" verse 4 being :\nTor the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting ;\nand\nhis truth endureth from generation to generation.\nCf. accordingly King 164 :\nOh be joyful all ye lands\u2014the troubled times . . .\nMercv & truth.\nThere is another quotation in the scripts from this short\nPsalm of only 4 verses, and it occurs in a passage the\nimmediate context of which there has already been occasion\nto discuss in connexion with the topic of \" Behemoth and\nLeviathan \"\n(pp. 510-513 above). Thus :\nW. 281 {Feb. 16, 1912).\n. . . He hath made us and not we ourselves all\nthmgs in heaven and earth and beneath thou great\nLeviathan not Jonah Thou great Leviathan men's\nhearts falling them for fear but the waves sank like\na little chUd to sleep the angry billow ceased to\nleap At thy wQl . . .\n\" He hath made us,\" etc., is from verse 2 of Psalm c. :\n0 be joyful m the Lord, aU ye lands : serve the Lord\nwith gladness, and come before his presence with a song.\n\f554 J.

[part\nBe ye sure that the Lord he is God ; it is he that hath\nmade us, and not we ourselves : we are his people, and the\nsheep of his pasture.\nSo it will be seen that while King scripts connect this\nPsalm with the stars singing together at the creation of\nthe world and with \" the troubled times,\" Willett 281\nconnects it with the \" Behemoth and Leviathan \" topic,\nwith \" men's hearts failing them for fear \" and with the\nCalming of the Storm.\n\" VENGEANCE IS MINE \" AND ASSOCIATED TOPICS.\nIn King 202, written in the course of the afternoon of\nJuly 27, 1914, the words \" Vengeance is mine saith the\nLord I wall repay \" occur in the following context :\nPeace had Zimri peace who slew his master ? . . .\nGreat trial & tribulation but in the end peace & lights-\nHow are the mighty fallen & the proud brought low . . .\nVengeance is mine saith the Lord I will repay.\nBy the afternoon of July 27, 1914, though War was not\nyet certain, it was probable ; and consequently it might\nbe thought that Mrs. King's own imagination will afford\na sufficient explanation of this script. So I think it\nmight, if it stood alone ; but if it be considered in con-\njunction with phrases occurring in nearly contemporaneous\nKang scripts, and if these again be compared with the\ncontexts of identical or similar phrases in the scripts of\nother automatists, so simple an explanation will not,\nI fancy, commend itself to most minds.\nFor the purpose of this comparison I will begin by\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 555\nputting together a few extracts from four King scripts\nwritten between July 27 and August 2, 1914 :\nKing 202 {July 27 , 1914).\n. . .

V. 3095 and 512 only.\nIt means \" Cloud-Cnckoo-City,\" and is the name given by\nAristophanes in the Birds to the City built by birds in\nmid-air. Sir Richard Jebb, in his article on Aristophanes\nin the Enc. Brit., writes as follows :\nSome have found in the Birds a complete historical\nallegory of the Sicilian expedition; others, a general satire\non the prevalence at Athens of headstrong caprice over law\nand order ;\nothers, merely an aspiration towards a new and\npurified Athens\u2014a dream to which the poet had turned\nfrom his hope for a revival of the Athens of the past.\nFrom M. V. 512 it is absolutely clear that it is the\nthird of these views that is taken in the scripts ;\nand that\nNephelecoccygia stands for \"a new and purified Athens.\"\n\" Quid fremuenmt gentes 1\n\" is the Vulgate version of\nPsalm ii. 1 :\n\" Why do the heathen so furiously rage\ntogether ?\n\" except that quid is used instead of the\nVulgate's quare.\n\" Gens togata;' \" the race that wears the toga,\" means\nthe Romans. The toga was the national garb of the\nRoman citizen. The word is used by classical writers as\na symbol of Peace, as the weU-known saying \" Cedant\narma togae \" sufficiently shows. \"The Roman toga\" in\nKing 182, no doubt, bears the same meaning as \" gens\ntogata.\"\nRomanam condere gentem,\" \"to found the Roman\nrace,\" is part of a famous hne in Vergil's Aeneid :\n\" Tantae mohs erat Romanam condere gentem,\"\n{Aen. i. 33)\nwhich means \" So hard a matter was it to found the\nRoman race.\" This line Myers imitated in his Promise of\nImmortality :\n\" So hard a matter was the birth of Man.\"\nHe again made use of it in a passage of his Presidential\nAddress to this Society; and to this passage it is clear\nthat M. V. 3095, 3097, and 512, when read together, allude :\nOut of the long Stone Age our race is awakening into\nconsciousness of itself. We stand in the dawn of history.\n\f558 J. G. Piddington. [part\nBehind us lies a vast and unrecorded waste\u2014the mighty\nstruggle hmnanam condere gentem. Since the times of that\nignorance ^ we have not yet gone far ; a few thousand\nyears, a few hundred thinkers, have barely started the\nhuman mind upon the great aeons of its onward way.\nIt is not yet the hour to sit down in our studies to eke\nout Tradition with Intuition . . . The traditions, the\nintuitions of our race are themselves in their infancy ;\nand before we abandon ourselves to brooding over them\nlet us at least first try the upshot of a systematic search\nfor actual facts.

V. 3097 of \" Romanam condere\ngentem \" with \" gens togata \" points certainly in my\nopinion to another famous line ^ in the Aeneid :\nQuin aspera Juno,\nQuae mare nunc terrasque metu caelumque fatigat,\nConsilia in melius referet, mecumque fovebit\nRomanos, rerum dominos, gentemque togatam.\n(Aen. i. 279-282.)\nThese lines form part of Jupiter's consoling reply to\nVenus, when alarmed by the storm which Juno had\n1 The allusion is to Acts xvii. 30, 31 :\n\" And the times of this ignor-\nance God winked at ; but now commandetli all men everywhere to\nrepent : Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge\nthe world in righteousness.\"\n2 Cf. also Myers, The Reneival of Youth, 11. 107-158. In the passage\nin his Presidential Address Myers is to a large extent only repeating in\nprose what he had already said here in verse.\n3 Macrobius says that Vergil borrowed the line from an earlier poet ;\nand Suetonius records an occasion on which Augustus quoted it.\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 559\nraised against Aeneas' fleet, ^ she implores him to maintain\nhis decree that the Trojans should become the masters of\nthe world. Jupiter begins his reply with a general\nassurance\nParce metu, Cytherea, manent inmota tuorum\nFata tibi,\n(with which compare \" Gens togata manet \" in M. V.\n3097), and then later repeats his assurance more specifi-\ncally, in the lines quoted above, with the added promise\nof Juno's eventual benevolence :\nNay, harsh Juno, who in her fear now troubles earth\nand sea and sky, shall change to better counsels, and\nwith me shall cherish the lords of the vmrld, the goivned\nrace of Rome. (Mackail's Translation.)\n\" Clipeum recondit el ensem \" Mrs. Verrall herself trans-\nlated \" He puts away the shield and sword.\" \" Ensem \"\nand \" gladium \" (both words are used in M. V. 3099)\nmean exactly the same thing, and \" recondere gladium in\nvagina,\" or \"in vaginam,\" is classical Latin for \" to put\nup a sword again into the sheath \" ; but as one cannot\nspeak of \" sheathing a shield,\" some more general term\nlike \"puts away\" must be used to render \"recondit.\"\nThe end of M. V. 512 implies that the next day's\nscript will carry on the subject. Since the virtue on\nwhich the Athenians specially, and with justice, prided\nthemselves was Clemency (see pp. 532, 549 above), there\nis no difficulty in understanding how M. V. 513 carries\non the subject of M. V. 512, for M. V. 513 alludes to\n\" Clementia et misericordia \" (Clemency and Pity), while\nM. V. 512 had referred to a \" new and purified Athens\n\"\nby means of the word \" Nephelecocyggia.\"\nObserve that M. V. 3095, 3097, and 3099 give us this\nNew Athens in combination with Roman Law and Order,\nthe Parents of Peace ; for that is what is meant by ge^is\ntogata and gens nata logae (a race destined by nature to a\npeaceful career), as well as by clipeum recondit et ensem.\nThese five scripts of Mrs. Verrall's combine, in fact,\nAthenian Clemency with the Pax Romana.\n1 For other references to this storm see pp. 512, 513, 558, 559, 571.\n\f560 J.

I have already (see pp. 531-532\nabove) dealt with this subject at length, and so need here\nsay no more than that the Eumenides references stand for\nthe supersession of the Old Dispensation of Vengeance by\nthe New Dispensation of Mercy : the Erinyes, whose code\nis \"an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth \"\u2014the\ncode of Shylock\u2014being finally won over by the \" younger,\nkindlier Gods \" to a code which tempers Justice with\nMercy.

[part\nThere were some for the clean-cut stone, there were more for\nthe carven flowers,\nAnd the Avrathful thunder of God peal'd over us all the day,\nFor the one half slew the other, and after we sail'd away.\nAnd we came to the Isle of a Saint who had sail'd with St.\nBrendan of yore,\nHe had lived ever since on the Isle and his winters were fifteen\nscore,\nAnd his voice was low as from other worlds, and his eyes were\nsweet,\nAnd his white hair sank to his heels and his white beard sank\nto his feet.\nAnd he spake to me, '\n0 Maeldune, let be this purpose of\nthme !\nRemember the words of the Lord when he told us \" Vengeance\nis mine !\n\"\nHis fathers have slain thy fathers in war or in single strife.\nThy fathers have slain his fathers, each taken a life for a life,\nThy father had slain his father, how long shaU the murder last?\nGo back to the Isle of Finn and suffer the Past to be Past.'\nAnd we kiss'd the fringe of his beard and we pray'd as we\nheard him pray,\nAnd the Holy man he assoil'd us, and sadly we sail'd away.\nAnd we came to the Isle we were blown from, and there on\nthe shore was he.\nThe man that had slain my father.

V. 548 the reference to the scene between Mael-\ndune and the aged Saint is immediately followed by\n\" The armour of God,'' which corresponds with Theme D\nof the four King scripts ; and all the Maeldune references\ncorrespond, of course, with Theme B \"Vengeance is mine!\"\nIn H.

V. 435 \" the carven flowers \" is immediately pre-\nceded by \" the eagle S the lily.\" \" The eagle & the\nlily \" is a reference to a passage in Dante's Paradiso,^\nof which I will quote Edmund G. Gardner's summary\n:\n^ It must not be supposed that \" the carven flowers \" of H. V. 435\nis a merely accidental coincidence with the words in the poem. It is\nan absolutely certain reference to them, as is shown by three earlier\nreferences in Mrs. Salter's scripts of March 18, 24, and 31, 1914\u2014all\npre-War scripts, be it noted.\n\" He said [sic, in error for \" spake \"] to me Oh Maeldime \" occurs\nfor the first time in Mrs. Salter's script on April 9, 1913. It will be\nseen, then, that it was not the War that suggested the \" Vengeance is\nmine \" passage in The Voyage of Maeldime to the automatist.\nThe first reference to the poem in all the scripts is in M. V. 136, of\nFebruary 12, 1907 :\n\" The voyage of Maeldune faery lands forlorn.\"\nWith this compare King 166, of May 9, 1914 :\n\" faery lands forlorn\u2014the bent twigs, the carven stone,\"\nand H. V. 508, of June 18, 1917 :\n\" Maeldune\u2014that too\u2014fairy seas.\"\nMrs. Salter had seen M. V. 136, and Mrs. King may have, because it\nhas been published in Proceedings : but though their knowledge of M. V.\n136 may explain why they both connect the Maeldime poem with \"faery \/\nlands forlorn,\" it does not explain why Mrs. Salter should select \" the\ncarven flowers,\" and Mrs. King \"the carven stone\" from the Termyson\npoem rather than some of the other scores of phrases in it.\n^ The way in which the references to this Dante passage emerged is so\ninteresting that I quote them in full :\nH.

[part\nThe Heaven of Jupiter.\u2014The silvery white sphere of\nJupiter, the sixth heaven, is ruled by the Dominations,\nthe Angelic order who are '\nan express image of the true\nand archetypal dominion in God '\n. . . Their function is\nto draw all things to imitate this dominion, so that rulers\nmay bear true lordship in God and men may imitate this\ndominion by subjection and obedience. This, then, is the\nsphere of ideal government, the heaven of the planet that\neffectuates justice upon Earth {Par. xvni. 115-117). The\nsouls of faithful and just rulers appear as golden lights,\nsinging and flying like celestial birds. They first form the\ntext Diligite iustitiam qui iudicatis terrain, '\nLove justice\nyou that are the judges of the Earth' {Wisdorn i. 1,\nVulgate), tracmg successively the letters until they rest in\nthe final golden M, the initial letter of Monarchy or\nEmpire\u2014the Empire under which alone can justice be\nparamount on earth. Next, those higher form the head\nand neck of an Eagle ; while those below first form a\nhly upon the M, and then peacefully follow the higher\nspirits in forming one complete imperial Eagle {Par. xviii.\n100-114). The Gueh powers who foUow the standard of\nthe hly must thxis submit to the universal Monarchy, the\nform of government ordained by God, and coming down\ndirectly from the fountain of universal authority. In the\nvaried details of these three transformations the three\ngreat doctrines of the De Monarchia are shown step by\nstep : the necessity of the Empire for the well-being of\nthe world, the Roman acquisition of the Monarchy by\nright, the direct dependence of the imperial authority upon\nGod. (Edmund G. Gardner, Dante, pp. 130-131.)\nDante does not actually speak of \"an eagle vnth a lily\nin its beak,\" but this phrase in H. V. 471 is evidently\nmeant as an allusion to the spirits of the Just Rulers\nwho \" enlily the M,\"\n\" ingigliarsi all' emme.\"\ncases where the communicators have named the author of an out-of-the-\nway passage in hterature. Had Dante not been mentioned, the passage\nmight never have been identified. Even as it was, it needed a long\nhunt before it was traced.\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparison of Scripts. 569\nMoreover, should any doubt be felt about the identifica-\ntion of the phrases in the H. V. scripts with the Dante\npassage, a comparison of the extract from H. V. 380\n(quoted in footnote (2) on p. 567) with Paradiso xviii. 34-36,\n73-81, 97-105, and xix. 1, will probably remove it. And\nthat \" the eagle & the lily \" does mean this passage in\nthe Paradiso is further confirmed by a comparison of\nH. V. 435 with H. V. 538 :\nH. V. 435. the eagle & the lUy\u2014^the carven flowers\n[=The Voyage of Maeldune]\nH. V. 508.

V. 508 correspond to \" the\nsouls of faithful and just rulers . . . singing and flying\nlike celestial birds \" who form themselves into the text\nDiligite iustitiam qui iudicatis terram.\nThe combination in the scripts of The Voyage of Mael-\ndune with the Paradiso passage represents, then, the\ntempering of Justice with Mercy, the forgiveness of\nenemies, and the reign of Justice on earth.\nLet us go back now to the four King scripts from\nwhich we started, and compare them with Mrs. Salter's\n\" Maeldune \" scripts. For the purpose of this comparison\nI consider myself entitled to include the original context\nof a quotation :\nFour King Scripts. H. V. \" Maeldune \" Scripts.\nVengeance is mine, saith And he spake to me, '\n0\nthe Lord. Maeldune, let be this\npurpose of thine !\nRemember the words of the\nLord when he told us\n\" Vengeance is mine !\n\" '\nMercy and truth are met Wherefore take upon you\ntogether ;\nrighteousness and the whole armour of God\npeace have kissed each other. . . . having your loins girt\n\f570\nPut on the armour of\nlight.\nThou shalt . . . break\nthem in pieces hke a\npotter's vessel.\nBe wise now therefore, 0\nye Kings : be learned, ye\nthat are judges of the earth\n[part\nwith truth, and having on\nthe breast plate of righteous-\nness ; And your feet shod\nwith the preparation of peace.\nThe discarnate souls of\nFaithful and Just Rulers,\nwhose function is to inspire\nearthly rulers to imitate the\nDivine Justice, and who,\nwheeling like birds, form\nthemselves into the words\nDiligite iustitiam qui judi-\ncatis terram (\" Love right-\neousness ye that be judges\nof the earth \").\nJ. G. Piddington.\nThe mamier in which, in this and other cases, I am\nobliged for the sake of simplicity of exposition to take a\nsmall part out of what in reality is a very complex and\nextensive network of topics, isolate it, and treat it as if\nit were an entire and self-contained pattern, may naturally\ncause the reader to be surprised at the trouble taken to\nwork in the allusions to Paradiso xviii. in Mrs. Salter's\nscripts. Surely, he might say, the topic of Just Govern-\nment might have been represented much more simply\nthan by reference to a recondite passage in Dante's\nParadiso. No doubt it might have been, if the com-\nmunicators had wanted merely to say \" Love righteousness\nye that be judges of the earth.\" But they may have\nhad other objects as well. They may, for instance, have\nwan ed to suggest that the reign of Justice on earth will\nnot be achieved without the help of the Angelic Birds,\nthe Church militant of heaven :\n0 milizia del ciel, . . .\nadora per color che sono in terra\ntutti sviati retro al malo esemplo\n{Par. xviii. 124-126) ;\n\fLxxxvii.] Comparison of Scripts. 571\nand they may have wanted to introduce the subject of\nJustice on earth in such a way that it could be fitted\non to other topics. Thus, for instance, the passage in\nthe Paradiso appears to be fitted on to the incident in\nthe first Book of the Aeneid where Venus in disguise\nmeets her son Aeneas, who, after having been driven by\nthe storm on to the coast of Libya, is wandering dis-\nconsolately along the shore, and bids him be of good\ncheer and betake himself to Dido's court at Carthage ;\nassures him that his fleet is not lost, and points in con-\nfirmation of her words to twelve swans who have escaped\nfrom the attack of a bird of prey and are now joyously\nbeginning to settle on the shore. The connexion between\nthe Angelic Birds of the Paradiso and the Swans of the\nAeneid is effected in the following way :\nH. V. 332 {October 17, 1913).\nPars celeris ^ . , . winged sandals\u2014-the messenger of\nthe Gods. iftixoirofXTros [an epithet of Hermes, who\nwas identified by the Romans with Mercury]\u2014there is\na thought behind this which is not yet clear . . .\nH.

See Aen. I. 396 :\n''\nAut capere aut captas,\"\netc.\n^ \" Tantae molis erat,\" etc., is very definitely connected with the\nsiifferings that Jimo inflicted on Aeneas by sea :\n\" she drove all over\nocean the Trojan remnant . . . and held them afar from Latium ; and\nmany a year were they wandering driven of fate aroimd all the seas.\nSuch work was it to found the Roman people.\" (Mackail's Translation of\nAen.

I do not imagine\njust because Ruskin happens to have a reference to the\nParadise passage that therefore the scripts intend a refer-\nence to the Rusldn passage. It would be utterly unsound\nto argue in that way. The grounds on which I base my\nconjecture that the scripts intend a reference both to the\noriginal passage in the Paradise and to the passage in\nwhich Ruskin makes use of it are two. The first, and\nweaker, ground is that while in H. V. 380 the passage is\nsaid to be \" in Dante,\" in H. V. 471 it is called \" a\npassage in literature \" ; and it seems to me odd to speak\n1 It is not, however, from Ruskin that the automatist can have\ngleaned the detail about the lily in the eagle's beak ; for Ruskin does\nnot mention the lily.\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparison of Scri-pts. 573\nof it as \"a passage in literature \" after definitely assigning\nit to Dante unless the passage in question is to be found\nsomewhere else than in Dante. The second, and far\nstronger, ground is that the scripts contain a good number\nof references to Ruskin's Unto This Last, and some of\nthese, which I append in a footnote,'- show connexions\nwith topics already met with in this paper\u2014namely, The\nDawn, The Return of the Golden Age, The armour of\nGod, Forgiveness of enemies and Mercy\u2014which may\nobviously be in unison with the topic of Just Government\non earth.\nRuskin's reference to the Paradiso passage comes in the\nchapter of Unto This Last entitled \" Qui Judicatis Ter-\nram,\" and this title is part of the text from the Book of\nWisdom,\nDiligite iustitiam qui judicatis terram,\niH.

It is as follows :\n'\nThe rich and the poor have met. God is their maker.'\n[Prov. xxii. 2.]\n'\nThe rich and the poor have met. God is their light.'\nThey '\nhave met ' : more literally, have stood in each\nother's way (obviavenint) . That is to say, as long as the\nworld lasts, the action and counteraction of wealth and\npoverty, the meeting, face to face, of rich and poor, is\njust as appointed and necessary a law of the world as the\nflow of stream to sea, or the interchange of power among\nthe electric clouds :\n\u2014' God is their maker.' But, also,\nthis action may be either gentle and just, or convulsive\nand destructive . . . And which of these it shall be\ndepends on both rich and poor knowing that God is their\nlight ; that in the mystery of human life there is no other\nhght than this by which they can see each other's faces,\nand live ; \u2014light, which is called in another of the books\namong which the merchant's maxims have been preserved,\nthe '\nsun of justice,' of which it is promised that it shall\nrise at last with '\nhealing '\n(health-giving or helping, mak-\ning whole or setting at one) in its wings.^ For truly this\nhealing is only possible by means of justice\nI have just spoken of the flowing of streams to the sea\nas a partial image of the action of wealth. In one\nrespect it is not a partial, but a perfect image. The\npopular economist thinks himself wise in having dis-\ncovered that wealth, or the forms of property in general,\nmust go where they are required ; that where demand is,\nsupply must follow. He farther declares that this course\nof demand and supply cannot be forbidden by human\nlaws. Precisely in the same sense, and with the same\ncertainty, the waters of the world go where they are\nrequired . . . The course neither of clouds nor rivers can\nbe forbidden by human will. But the disposition and\nadministration of them can be altered by human foresight.\nWhether the stream shall be a curse or a blessing, depends\nupon man's labour, and administrating intelligence . . .\n1 Malachi iv. 2.\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparison of Scripts. 575\nIn like manner this wealth \" goes where it is required.\"\nNo human laws can withstand its flow.

He calls it, shortly, the\n'\nscience of gettmg rich.' . . .\nI hope I do not misrepresent him by assuming that he\nmeans his science to be the science of '\ngetting rich by\nlegal or just means.' In this definition, is the word\n'\njust,' or '\nlegal,' finally to stand 1 For it is possible\namong certain nations, or under certain rulers, or by help\nof certain advocates, that proceedings may be legal which\nare by no means just. If, therefore, we leave at last only\nthe word '\njust ' in that place of our definition, the in-\nsertion of this solitary and small word will make a notable\ndifference in the grammar of our science. For then it\nwill follow that m order to grow rich scientifically, we\nmust grow rich justly ;\nand, therefore, know what is just\n;\nso that our economy will no longer depend merely on\nprudence, but on jurisprudence\u2014and that of divine, not\nhuman law. Which prudence is indeed of no mean order,\nholding itself, as it were, high in the air of heaven, and\ngazing for ever on the light of the sun of justice ; hence\nthe souls which have excelled in it are represented\nby Dante as stars forming in heaven for ever the figure\nof the eye of an eagle : they having been in life the\ndiscerners of light from darkness ; or to the whole human\nrace, as the light of the body, which is the eye ;\n^ while-\nthose souls which form the wings of the bird (giving power\nand dominion to justice, '\nhealing in its wings ') trace also\n1 The reference is to Matt. vi. 22 :\n\" But lay up for yourselves\ntreasures in heaven. . . .

It is not only automatic\nwriters who have made such predictions : other quite\nnormal people have made them too. Since 1907 Sir\nHenry Wilson was convinced that Germany was bent on\na war of world-conquest ;\nmany diplomatists, many\nsoldiers, some statesmen and journalists and novelists,\nforesaw what was coming, and some of them devoted\ntime and energy to the task of warning the world of the\nfate in store for it. One could almost say that it was a\nsafe prediction to make, especially if the prophet were\nwise enough to refrain from naming a date for the fulfil-\nment of his prophecy.\n\" Had Mrs. King, Uke most of the other automatists,\nbeen producing script for many years before August 1914,\nand if during these earher years her script had maintained\nsilence on the subject of the War, then the sudden\noutburst between October 1913 and July 1914 of warnings\nof a corning catastrophe would have suggested that the\nevent was near. But it so happens that Mrs. Iving did\nnot begin to produce script till 1913, and consequently the\nnearness in time of her predictions to the event has Little\nsignificance. It is true that such phrases as '\nHearken while\nthere is yet time '\n(King 79), '\nThe flight in winter ... it is\nnot far ' (King 80), count for something ; but terms like\n'\nfar '\nand '\nnear '\nare capable of very wide interpretation.\n\" The scripts, then, it would seem, leave the date of\n\f678 J. G. Piddington. [part\nthe outbreak of the threatened catastrophe, which, unhke\nthe bare fact of the catastrophe, was a difficult thing to\nforesee, entirely vague.\"\nAlthough this criticism takes no account of the prob-\nability that no long interval would separate the warnings\nrepeatedly addressed to Mrs. King to prepare herself for a\ncoming trial from the occiirrence of the trial, since prema-\nture warnings are apt to lose their force, I should not\nregard it as wholly unreasonable. So with a view to\nmeeting it in part, should it be made, I propose to\ndiscuss a few scripts written hy Mrs. Willett, Mrs. Verrall,\nand Mrs. Salter during the month of July 1914, which\nappear to me to imply that War is immediately imminent.\nAt the same time I should reply to my imaginary critic\nthat, though I know of nothing in the scripts which can\nbe held to fix the precise time when the War would\nbegin, the whole language of the scripts in my view does\nsuggest that the events which form the subject of much\nof the scripts are not far-distant and are to begin, if not\nto end, during the lifetime of the automatists themselves\nand of those who study the scripts.\nThe Scripts of July 1914.\nIn considering the scripts of July 1914, there is one date\nand hour which it is important to keep in mind ; and\nthat is 6 o'clock on the evening .of July 23, 1914. It\nwas at that hour on that day that the Austrian Minister\nat Belgrade presented his Government's ultimatum to\nSerbia. That ultimatum made War\u2014not a certainty,\nbecause the extreme moderation of Serbia's reply brought\na short gleam of hope\u2014but so great a probability, that a\nprediction of an immediate outbreak of war made after\nJuly 23, 1914, would deserve comparatively little attention.\nBetween Jvxly 9 and July 23, 1914, however, so far as the\ngeneral public was concerned\u2014and our automatists are\nmembers of the general pubUc\u2014there was no stronger\nreason for anticipating an immediate outbreak of War than\nthere had been at many other times durmg the preceding\nthree or four years or more ; and when I say this I am\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 579\nnot forgetting the murders at Serajevo on June 28, 1914.\nThe first Morocco crisis of 1905 and 1906, still more the\nAgadir crisis of 1911, might well have prompted the\navitomatists to indulge in prophecies of an immediate\noutbreak of war ; and yet I see no trace of such pro-\nphecies in the scripts written about these periods.\nIt must not be imagined that our automatists were in\npossession of \" inside \" information ; and it should further-\nmore be borne in mind that a great European War was\nby no means universally anticipated even by those who\nmay be supposed to have had the advantage of \" inside\n\"\ninformation. Thus, both in 1908 and 1911, the then\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. McKenna, was engaged\nin an acute controversy with a section of the Cabinet who\nthought the moment opportune for reducing expenditure\non the Navy ;\n^ and \" Mr. Lloyd George, in an interview\npublished on the first day of 1914, declared that Liberahsm\nwould be false to its trust if it did not seize the oppor-\ntunity of what he asserted to be the improvement in\nAnglo-German relations to diminish expenditure on arma-\nments.\" ^ Moreover, in 1912 and 1913 there was a much-\nadvertised movement in progress for bettering our relations\nwith Germany : a movement which found its chief in-\nspirers and supporters among people of Liberal politics.\nI recall these facts, need I say? with no desire to arouse\npolitical feeling, and only because they serve to show\nthat, while war was sinticipated by some, this anticipation\nwas not shared by aU, and\u2014I do not think this will be\ndisputed\u2014that Liberals were less inchned to believe m the war-\nlike designs of Germany than were their political opponents.\n^ \" He [Mr. M'Kenna] entered on his new duties [as First Lord, in\n1908] when the country was profoundly stirred by the rapid increase of\nthe German fleet, and was in doubt whether the preparations of the\nAdmiraltjf were on a sufficiently extensive scale. At the same time a\nlarge portion of the Liberal party was disposed to belittle the danger\nand to call a halt to building-schemes in the interest of peace and\neconomy. Mr. M'Kenna . . . resisted the section of the Cabinet, repre-\nsented by the powerful figures of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Churchill,\nwho took this last view.\" (Enc.

[PART\nNow it so happens that the three automatists whose\nscripts I am about to discuss were Liberals.^ Mrs.\nVerrall was an ardent Liberal ; Mxs. Salter is a Liberal\n(I leave her to supply a qualifying epithet) ; and Mrs.\nWillett is a more than ardent Liberal. This being the\ncase, and judging also from my personal knowledge of\nthem, I should not hesitate to say that these three ladies,\nin their normal state at any rate, had no marked tendency\nto anticipate that Germany would provoke a great Euro-\npean War at the end of July 1914. Moreover, there is\nalmost proof that during at least the early summer of\n1914 Mrs. Verrall felt no serious anxieties about the\ninternational situation, for she spent most of June in\nSwitzerland ; and Mrs. Salter was actually in France when\nthe War broke out. None of the three ladies were\ndisciples of Mr. Leo Maxse, and I think the reader may\ntake it for certain that the mind of none of them was\npreoccupied with a menace of war.^\nThe extracts from scripts written during July 1914\nwhich seem to me to indicate knowledge of the fact that\nWar was to be declared within a few days are as follows :\nW. 342 {JuUj 9, 1914).\n. . .

For the purpose of this, she borrowed\nsome maps of the Tyrol from ray brother.

It comes from the last verse of the last chapter\nof the Book of Daniel. To bring out the full significance\nof the appearance of this quotation at this date for the\nfirst time in any of the Scripts, it will be necessary to\ngive the context of it :\nBehold a certain man clothed in linen . . . said unto\nme . . . {Dan. x. 5, 11.)\n... at this time shaU Michael stand up, the great\nprince which standeth for the children of thy people ; and\nthere shaU be a time of trouble, such as never was since\nthere was a nation even to that same time : and at that\ntime thy people shall be delivered. . . .\nBut thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the\nbook, even to the time of the end . . .\nThen I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other\ntwo . . .\nAnd one said to the man clothed in linen, . . .

Go thy way, Daniel ; for the words are\nclosed up and sealed tUl the time of the end ...\nAnd from the time that the daily sacrifice shaU be\ntaken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate\nset up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety\ndays.\n\fLxxxvn.] Comparison of Scripts. 583\nBlessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand\nthree hundred and five and thhty days.\nBut go thou thy way till the end be, for thou shctlt rest>\nand stand in thy lot at the end of the days.\n[Dan. xii. 1-13.)\nWhen the disciples came to Christ privately as he sat\non the Mount of Olives and asked him :\n\" When shall\nthese things be ?\n\" (\" these things \" meaning the destruc-\ntion of the Temple) \" and what shall be the sign of thy\ncommg, and of the end of the world ? \", he made reference\nto this passage in Daniel :\nWhen ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desola-\ntion, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy\nplace, (whoso readeth let him understand :)\nThen let them which be in Judea flee into the moun-\ntains :\nLet him which is on the house-top not come down to\ntake any thing out of his house : . . .\nAnd woe unto them that are with child, and to them\nthat give suck in those days !\nBut pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,\nneither on the Sabbath day : For then shall be great\ntribulation, such as was not from the beginning of the\nworld to this time, no, nor ever shall be.\n{Matt. xxiv. 3-21.)\nThe immediate context, then, of Mrs. Willett's \" Thou\nshaft stand in thy lot \" falls into line with the seven-fold\nrepetition of \" Pray ye that your flight be not in the\nwinter \" in pre-War King scripts.\nI pass over for the moment H. V. 359, which comes\nnext m. chronological order, and take M. V. 626 of July 17,\n1914, M. V. 628 of Jixly 20, and M. V. 629 of July 21.\nIn M. V. 626 comes the first mention of the message\nfor Mrs. WiUett. It is to be given \" early next week \"\n;\nand Mrs. VerraU is enjoined to take care to send it ;\nthough why there should be any particular hurry about\nits reception, or why any particular care about com-\nmunicating it, is not explained.\n2q\n\f\/\n584 J. G. Piddingto7i. [pakt\nThree days later, on July 20, it is incidentally men-\ntioned again\u2014in M. V. 628 ; and then \" early next week,\"\nin fact as early as possible next week, namely on Sunday,\nJuly 21, 1914, the message is given\u2014in M. V. 629. It\nseems in itself an ordinary enoiigh kind of message, not\ndeserving of being led up to with such careful pre-\nliminaries ; and on the face of it there seems no special\nreason why it should be communicated \" early next week.\"\nBefore Mrs. Verrall acted on the instructions given in her\nscript, she wrote to ask me whether I saw any objection\nto her sending the message to Mrs. Willett. Before\nanswering her I consulted Mr. Balfour ;\n^ and on July 25,\n1914, I wrote to tell her that neither he nor I saw any\nobjection to the message being sent. After receiving my\nanswer Mrs. Verrall sent the message to Mrs. Willett on\nJuly 29, 1914, and it reached her the next day.\nIf, as I assume, the last words written automatically by\nMi's. Willett,\n\" A final word Thou shalt stand in thy lot \",\nare premonitory of the coming War, the reason why the\ncommunicators were anxious to get a reference to them in\nMrs. Verrall's script early in the week beginning July 21,\n1914, seems plain enough. They wanted to show by\nmeans of a supernormal cross-reference that they realised\nthe importance of these \" last words \" before their true\nsignificance could be known or guessed. Before July 23,\n1914, the day on which Austria's viltimatum to Serbia was\npresented, their significance was not, and hardly could\nhave been, divined.\nThe last words given to Mrs. Willett are, as M. V. 629\nasserts, capable of bearing \" a double meaning, one general\none special \" ; for they may readily serve as a message of\nassurance for the nation, as well as for the individual.\nThe reader will find a close parallel to this in Mrs. King's\nscripts (see especially King 33, 34, 64, 85, 130, 185, 194),\nwhere messages of encouragement to the automatist herself\n1 I consulted Mr. Balfour, not because I attached any importance to\nthe matter, but simply because Mr. Balfour was, so to speak, in charge\nof Mrs. Willett's scripts.\n\fLXXXVII.] Comparison of Scripts. 585\nare interspersed with similar messages with a wider\napplication.\nI go back now to H. V. 359, which was written four\nand a halt hours earlier than the first of the three\n;\nM. V. scripts which have to do with the message to Mrs.\nWillett.\nIts opening phrase \" Spearheads many together \" is im-\nI\nmediately followed by \" that was written \" : words which\nnaturally mean that \" Spearheads many together \" had\nbeen written before in Mrs. Salter's script, and which,\nI do not doubt, were used to link the present script on\nto the one in which \" Spearheads many together \" had\npreviously occurred. This, however, is one of the rare\ncases where the script-memory is slightly at fault, for\n\" Spearheads many together \" had never before appeared\nin that exact form in Mrs. Salter's script.^\nI will now quote all the' pre-War occurrences of \" Spear-\nhead \" and \" Spear \" in Mrs. Salter's scripts :\nH. V. 61 {January 6, 1908).\n. . . The harvest moon with a halo round it and a\nstarless sky Spikes clustered together yellow spears\nA bird with outstretched wings a bird of prey\nI think that completes the picture . . .\n1 In December, 1921, I told Mrs. Salter that the last script she had\nwritten before the War contained a prediction of it. I began to write\n:, this paper at the end of June, 1922, finished the first draft of it on\nJuly 21, and completed the revision on August 8, 1922. Mrs. Salter\nknew I was writing a paper, and knew it was about predictions in the\nscripts of the War, but notliing else. In the first script written by\ni\nMrs. Salter after I had written the above passage about the slip on the\npart of the script-memory, namely, on August 21, 1922, the following\noccurs :\n\" Sowing the seed the dragon's teeth men in armour All the\nhills cried aloud The clashing of arms The earth shall groan\nbeneath their feet The tramping of feet many together.\"\nMrs. Salter did not know, and cannot have known, that I had com-\nmented in my paper on the fact that \" Spearheads many together\n\"\nhad not actually been written except in H. V. 359. It loolis as if the\ncommunicator knew of my comments on the difficulty, and was seeking\nto remove it by the suggestion that \"many together\" in H. V. 359\nhad been meant to apply, not to the spearheads, but to the \" armed\nfeet.\" Compare H. V. 107 (p. 588 below).\n\f586 J. G. Piddington. [PABT\nH.

The Voyage of Maeldune, as we have\nalready seen (pp. 565-669 above), is used in the scripts to\nrepresent the abandonment of revenge and the forgiveness\nof enemies. I think it possible that the commimicators\npreferred to effect their reference to this poem by means\nof a \" crib \" from M. V. 136, rather than by repeating\n\" And he said to me Oh Maeldune \" from a previous\nH. V. script (H.

But apart from the\nfact that Mrs. Verrall's script preceded this outburst of\nfeehng, even if Mrs. Willett's and Mrs. Salter's did not,\na fatal objection to this supposition is that, for years\nbefore the War broke out, the scripts were full of what\nT may for brevity call these Utopian topics, and these\nhad again and again been placed in juxtaposition to the\nWar topic.\nMoreover, if the scripts were liable to reflect popular\nfeehng, one would expect to find m them at or about the\ntime of the Armistice expressions of jubilation, and during\nthe past year or more expressions of disillusionment ; but\nof neither, so far as I can see, is there any trace.\nTo my mind one of the striking things in the scripts\nis the sobriety of their language. Wherever it has been\npossible to check it, \u2014that is to say, wherever what is\nsaid about an event can be compared with the event\nitself, the language appears to me to be temperate, even\nrestrained, and certainly without exaggeration : such, in\nfact, as might be expected, if the communicating group in\nreality includes, as ostensibly it does, Henry Sidgwick and\nEdmund Gurney among its members. But it is not\nalways possible to compare the event with what is said\nabout it. We cannot, for instance, compare the promised\nUtopia with the forecast of it. If in time to come the\nworld show no improvement, then the forecast is false.\nAnd if it show only some moderate degree of improve-\nment, again, I should say, the forecast is false ; for the\nterms of the forecast are emphatic, and nothing short of\na very thorough-going and lasting change for the better\nin international and social conditions could be held to\nfulfil them. At the same time, the scripts fix no date for\nthe fiilfilment, and it would be unreasonable to expect so\ngreat a revolution as they portend to come about \"in a\nmoment, in the twinkling of an eye.\" The whole trend\nof the communications, moreover, is against any such\nexpectation, endorsing, as it does, the old view that\nprogress is achieved only by long-continued effort. Never-\ntheless, if I may hazard an opinion, the communications\ndo not seem to me to convey the impression that the\n\f598 J. G. Piddingfon. [part\npredicted Utopia is to be looked for only in a dim and\ndistant future, centuries hence. If\u2014and it is a gigantic\n\"if\"\u2014if, I say, there is truth in the forecast, then \"there\nmay be some standing here, which shall not taste of death,\ntill they see \" \" the fair beginning of a time,\" and the\nold order yielding place\n\u2014\nslowly yielding place\u2014to new.\n\fLXXXVII.] Concluding Remarks. 509\nn\nCiONCLUDING REMARKS.\nIn conclusion I have a few observations to offer on the\nevidence for prevision to be found in the scripts discussed\nin this paper. For this purpose it will be convenient to\ndivide the predictions into four classes :\n(1) Predictions in general terms of an event\u2014the War\n\u2014\nthat was also foretold by persons who arrived at\ntheir forecast by ordinary processes of thought ;\n(2) Predictions of the approximate date, or ratlier of the\nclose imminence, of the War ;\n(3) Predictions of a particular incident\n\u2014\ne.g. the sinking of\nthe Lusitania\u2014seemingly beyond the range of\nordinary human forecast ;\n(4) Predictions in broad outline of the future of the world.\n(i) As regards the first class, prevision of the coming of\na great European War is not necessarilj^ evidence of\nsupernormal faculty ; for many people with no pretensions\nto supernormal powers predicted the War. I am not\noverlooking the circumstance that at least five of the\nautoma.tists made the prediction. That consensus is,\nindeed, a very remarkable thing ; but it does not alter\nthe fact that prevision of the War is not in. itself a proof\nthat the prophet acquired his information in a super-\nnormal manner. Nor am I losing sight of the circum-\nstance that the predictions in the scripts go back at least\nto the year 1907, and may very likely prove, when we\nhave had time to complete the study of the scripts, to go\nback as far as 1901. But, as I have already observed,\nby 1907 Sir Henry Wilson was convinced of Germany's\ndesigns, and it may well be that others reached the same\nconclusion earlier still. The predictions included under\nheading (1) contain no indications, so far as I am aware,\nof the precise or approximate time when the War was to\nbegin. All that can be said is that the scripts do convey\nthe impression that the War will affect the present\n\f600 J. G. Piddington. [part\ngeneration. That, however, was Kkewise the constant\nburden of those who normally predicted it.\n(2) By the predictions of the approximate date of the\noutbreak of the War I mean those contained in what\nI have called \" Some Scripts of July, 1914.\" I think\nthese scripts may be fairly interpreted as meaning that\nthe War is imminent. If this interpretation be accepted,\nsome might be disposed to clann that in this instance\nat any rate the scripts transcended the limits of human\nforesight. Yet such a claim can hardly be substantiated\nin view of the fact that the late Sir Cecil Spring-Rice\nplaced on record his conviction that Germany would\nmake war shortly after the completion of the Kiel\nCanal. 1 It was on June 23 and 24, 1914, that the\ndeepened and widened Canal was formally reopened.^\nFive weeks later Europe was at war, and Sir Cecil\n^ How easy it is to be prescient after the event is shown by tlie first\nof the two following extracts from Mr. James W. Gerard's My Four\nYears in Germany (published in 1917), and how easy to forget one's\nretrospective prescience by the second extract :\n\" If the Germans\" long preparations for war were to bear any\nfruit, countless facts pointed to the summer of 1914 as the time\nwhen the army should strike that great and sudden blow at the\nliberties of the world. It was in June, 1914, that the improved\nKiel Canal was reopened, enabling the greatest war ships to pass\nfrom the Baltic to the North Sea (p. 61).\nYet, in spite of these \" countless facts,'\" Mr. Gerard can write later\nthus :\n\" After my return from Kiel to Berlin a period of calm ensued.\nNo one seemed to think that the murders at Serajevo would have\nany effect ujDon the world. The Emperor had gone North on his\nyacht, but, as I believe, not imtil a certain line of action had been\nagreed upon. Most of the diplomats started on their vacations.\nSir Edward Goschen, British Ambassador, as well as the Russian\nAmbassador, left Berlin. This shows, of course, how little war was\nexpected in diplomatic circles '\"\n(p. 86).\n2 The exact date of the completion of the Kiel Canal cannot be stated\nfor the reasons given in the following extract from the Times of June 25,.\n1914 :\n\" The Emperor's passage through the Canal to-day [June 24] was\nof symbolical leather than practical significance, because, on the one\nhand, even the latest German Dreacbioughts long ago used the\nwidened passage experimentallj' ;\nwhile, on the other hand, it will\nbe a long time before all the work is finished.\"\n\fLxxxvii.] Concluding Remarks. 601\nSpring-Rice's prediction was fulfilled to the letter. I\nam not, of course, arguing that\" the autoniatists arrived\nat the approximate date of the outbreak of war by the\nsame method as did Sir Cecil Spring-Rice. My point\nis that since it was possible for Sir Cecil Spring-Rice\nto divine the date by normal processes of reasoning, it\nwould be hopeless to attempt to prove that the auto-\nmatists' forecasts were not arrived at in the same way. It\nis all a question of degree. If, for instance, the scripts\nhad predicted years before that the War Avould begin on\nor about Aug. 1, 1914, and that an armistice would be\nsigned on Nov. 11, 1918, that would have settled\u2014for\nmost people, at any rate\u2014the question of whether the\nlimits of normal insight and inference had been passed or\nnot. But the scripts of July 1914, in intimating that the\nWar is imminent, do not begin to approach such a\nstandard of definiteness as this.\n(3) The evidence for the third class of prevision, i.e.\nprevision of a particular incident not predictable seemingly\nby ordinary processes of thought, is immensely inferior\nboth in quantity and quahty to the evidence for the first\nclass of prevision, and is inferior in quality to the evidence\nfor the second class of prevision. It consists of the\n\" Lusitama,\" the Fenchurch Street and the \" Path-\nfinder \" cases. The coincidences between these particular\nreferences in Mrs. King's scripts and certain incidents in\nthe War may be fortuitous : in which case there is no\nquestion of prevision. Different people, no doubt, will\nform different views on the subject, as always happens in\ncases where no mathematical theory of probabilities can\nbe applied. Speaking for myseK, however, although I\nentertain a strong prejudice against the possibihty of this\nkind of prevision, I do not feel that I can honestly\ndismiss these three cases from my mind for good and aU\nas mere chance-coincidences. I do not mean that, because\nI cannot dismiss them, I accept them as exa,mples of\nprevision. I mean only that, much as I should like to\nplay the esprit fort, I feel bound to suspend judgment.\nBut let us for a moment assume that the references in\nKing script to the Lxisitania, for instance, are really\n\f602 J. G. Piddington. [part\nevidence of prevision. I presume it is scarcely necessary\nto point out how vastly greater are the theoretic diffi-\nculties in the way of believing in the possibility of fore-\nseeing such an event as the sinking of the Lusitania than\nare the difficulties in the way of believing in the possi-\nbility of foreseeing the War. To suppose that a particular\nevent like the sinking of the Lusitania can be definitely\nforeseen more than a year before it occurs, seems almost\nto commit us to a system of rigid determinism ; and\nthough determinism may be acceptable to some philo-\nsophers and many Orientals, to most Europeans it is\nrepugnant. But for the sake of argument proceeding\nstill on the assumption that the sinldng of the Lusitania\nwas predicted in Mrs. King's script, let me venture to\nsuggest a possible way out of the dilemma :\nIt may be very difficult for the communicators to get a\nreference to a particular subject inserted in the scripts ;\nbut once inserted, there seems to be little or no difficulty\nin getting it repeated. Now there are only two \" Lusi-\ntania \" references. Accordingly, if the comnumicators\nreally foresaw the future fate of the Lusitania, and\nintended to furnish evidence of their foreknowledge by\nmeans of these references, it is strange that they failed to\nemphasise them by frequent repetition, as they do in the !\ncase of other important topics ; for they must have i\nrecognized that evidence of this kind of prevision is most\nrare and of supreme interest. If, then, they really\npossessed foreknowledge of this future event, why did they\nthus restrict their references to it 1 It seems to me\nworth suggesting that the reason for their reticence may\nhave been that although in February 1914 they foresaw\nthe sinldng of the Lusitania as a possibility or probability,\nthey recognized that circumstances might yet intervene to\nprevent the contingency becoming a reality ; and con-\nsequently thought it wiser to refrain from laying too\nmuch stress on their prophecy. In the event of the -i\nthing predicted not happening, their slight references to it\nwould present no great stumbling-block, for they would be\nreadily passed over as part of the dross from which the ^\ngold of the scripts has to be sifted. Prediction of a\n\fLXXXVII.] Concluding Remarks. 603\ncoming War stands on a different footing. In this case\nthey may have recognized that the forces tending to bring\nit about were of such a character as to prechide the\npossibihty of their being interfered mth, and had already\nrendered the War a moral certainty. But recognizing\nthat the sinldng of the Lusitania was problematical, they\nmay have preferred not to risk a full-blown prophecy\nabout it.\nIf chance-coincidence be ruled out, another explanation\nmight be that the communicators were aware of the\ndesign or desire of certain persons in Germany to attack\nEngland's mercantile marine in the coming war, and that\nthey chose the Lusitania as a type or symbol of this\ndesigned attack ; and that the tj^e happened to l^ecome\none of the realities. Other hypotheses could be invented,\nno doubt ; but meanwliile the best course appears to me\nto suspend judgment and to await fresh evidence of this\nkind of prevision.\n(4) I turn now to the fourth class of prediction. Each\nof us can compare the script references to the War and\nto the Lusitania with the events ; but none of us can\ncompare what the scripts predict about the eventual\noutcome of the War with the event. In the first three\ncases we may or not, as we choose, suspend judgment ;\nin the fourth case we must. It is for this reason, in\npart at any rate, that I have placed the ''\nUtopian\n\"\npredictions in a class by themselves. We may be im-\npressed by them, or we may smile at them ; but we\ncannot judge them by the light of events. I have\nseparated them, however, from the other three classes for\nother reasons as well. They differ from the \"Lusitania\"\nclass of prediction in two respects : by their general\ncharacter, and by the fact that they form the subject of\nrepeated and long-continued references. They differ from\nthe predictions of the War by their far greater improb-\nability. ^ The history of mankind is largely a history of\nwars ; but the history of mankind contains no instance\nof the realisation of a Utopia.\n^ See footnote (1) on p. 649 above re Shelley's note on the last Chorus\nin his Hellas.\n\f604 J. G. Piddington. [part\nUtopias have been the theme of poets and thinkers in\nall ages. Nevertheless, and though \" many prophets and\nkings have desired to see these things,\" they \" have not\nseen them \" : their aspirations have not been realised,\ntheir dreams have not come true. The only test of the\ntruth of such foreshadowings is the future ; and so far\nthe future has always given them the lie. I am not, of\ncourse, denying the advance of civilization ; but that\nadvance is painfully slow, and neither a continuance of\nthis slow advance, nor even a slight quickening of its\npace, could be held to fulfil the predictions in the scripts.\nNor can we escape the difficulty by assuming that the\ncommunicators are merely portraying an ideal vision\ndesigned to inspire men to noble efforts, but destined\nnever to be achieved in practice ; for that is not the\nnatural meaning of the scripts. Cryptic though much of\nthem is, full of symbolism though they are, sophistry\nalone could thus whittle down their meaning, or could\nextract from them anything short of this : namely, that\nthe War is the first act of a drama which is to culminate\nin an unparalleled improvement in the condition of\nmankind.\nThe scripts in general terms predicted the War : so did\nmany people. Some half-dozen scripts written between\nJuly 9 and 21, 1914, predicted that the War was close at\nhand : so a,lso, and earlier, had Sir Cecil Spring-Rice.\nThe scripts predict that the War will eventually lead to a\ngreat improvement in international relations and social\nconditions : so too tens of thousands of ordinary citizens\nthroughout the British Empire believed or hoped that the\nGreat War was, as the phrase went, \" a war to end war.\"\nBut this last parallel between the predictions in the\nscripts and the beliefs or aspirations that declared them-\nselves with such strange ubiquity and intensity when war\nbroke out, is in truth only a superficial parallel ; for\nwhereas the wave of idealism that swept over the Empire\nfollowed, or at best synchronised with, the beginning of\nthe War, for many years before August 1914 the scripts\nhad repeatedly combined predictions of a Utopia with\npredictions of war, and had combined them in such a\n\fLXXXVII.] Conchiding Bemarks. 605\nmanner as to imply that the one is to be the outcome of\nthe other. I know of no parallel to that. The writers,\nthe soldiers, the diplomatists, and the politicians who\nforewarned us of the War, preached its dangers and its\nhorrors, but they did not tell us that this perilous and\nhorrible tragedy would yet prove to be the birth-throes\nof a happier world. Nor did the propagandists of Hague\nConferences and other schemes for allaying international\nrivalries warn us that a World-War must precede the\nattainment of their desires. All alike predicted or feared\na coming Chaos : the scripts alone, so far as I know,\n\" spoke of a hope for the world m the coming Avars,\"\nand hailed the approaching Chaos as the prelude to a\nnew Kosmos.\nThe predictions of the War m the scripts cannot be\nseparated from tlie predictions of an eventual IHopia.\nThe scriiots do not say: \"there will be a war,\" stop\nthere, and then start afresh and say :\n\" there will be a\nUtopia.\"' They clearly imply that the Utopia v\/ill result\nfrom the War. Yet it cannot be said that the two com-\nponent parts of the whole prophecy stand or fall together,\nbecause the predictions of War have been fulfilled ;\nbut\nthe fulfilment or the failure of the Utopian predictions\nmust eventually influence opinion as to the source of the\nWar predictions. Should the Utopia foreshadowed in the\nscripts be translated into fact, it would be very difficult\nto attribute the prediction of it as an outcome of the\nWar to ordinary human prescience ; and a strong case\nwould arise for admitting the claim made m the scripts,\nand for giving the credit of the prediction to discarnate\nbeings. And if the Utopian predictions were held to be\nthe work of discarnate minds, in all probabihty the pre-\ndictions of the War, which are so closely bound up A\\ith\nthem, would be assigned to the same source.\nJune\u2014August, 1922.\n\f606 Element of Chance in Book-Tests. [PAET\nON THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN BOOK-TESTS.\nEditorial Note.\nIn discussions and criticisms of the various Reports on\n\" book-tests,\"\" obtained at sittings with Mrs. Osborne\nLeonard, whicli have aj)peared in the Proceedings and\nelsewhere^, the question has more than once been raised\nas to how far the results obtained might be attribut-\nable to chance-coincidence. In view of the fact that\nbook-tests are by no means always successful and that\neven where some measure of success is attained, the\nsuccess is not always of a precise and definite kind, but\nsuch as to leave a good deal of scope for individual\ninterpretation, this question of chance-coincidence appears\nto be deserving of careful enquiry. Probably most people\nwho have themselves received a successful book-test have\ncarried out that kind of rough and ready method of\nenquiry which consists in searching for relevant matter\nupon a given page of some dozen or twenty books taken\nat random from their shelves, and have in consequence\nformed the opinion that if the indications as to the\nmatter contained in the given passage are sufficiently\nprecise, chance %\\ill give only a very small measure of\nsuccess. But these rough and ready methods will not\ntake us far where the cj[uestion is one of statistics and\npercentages. The enquiry must be conducted more\nsystematically and over a wider field.\nIt was with this object that the experiments with which\nwe are here concerned were devised, and we take this\nopportunity of thanking those of our members who\nparticipated in them. We have also particularly to thank\n1 See, e.g., Proc. S.P.E., Vol. XXXI., p. 241 ff. ; The Earthen Vessel,\nby Pamela Glencomier ; Some New Evidence for Human Survical, by\nthe Rev. Charles Drayton-Thomas.\n\fLXXXVII.] Element of Chance in Book-Tests. 607\nColonel C. E. Baddeley, C.B., C.M.G., who undertook the\nconsiderable labour of analysing the results and drawing\nup a table of percentages indicating the degree of success\nor failure which was obtained.\nIt has to be observed that the statistical method as\napplied to such experiments as these, presents certain\nobvious limitations and diliiculties. We have no absolute\nstandard by which success can be measured, as we have,\nfor example, in the guessing of numbers or cards from a\npack. A comparison of the various records sent in to\nus by experimenters showed considerable variations in the\nstandard by which the results had been judged. In one\nrecord, for example, a result would be tabulated as a\n\" complete success \" and in another a very similar result\nwould be tabulated as only a \" partial success.\"\nOne of the tasks, therefore, which fell to Colonel Baddeley'\ns\nlot was that of approximating all the records, so far as might\nbe, to one standard, and with a view to comparing the\nresrdts obtained in these experiments with those obtained\nat sittings with Mrs. Leonard it was important to know\nwhether his standard had been the same as that adopted\nby Mrs. Sidgwick in judging the Leonard book-tests. We\ntherefore submitted to Mrs. Sidgwick Colonel Baddeley's\ntabular analysis together wdth a number of representative\nspecimens selected from the records sent in by our\nmembers and asked for her opinion as to how the method\nfollowed by Colonel Baddeley compared with her own.\nl^pon this point Mrs. Sidgwick writes as follows :\nI have gone through the \" sham \"\"\nbook-tests you sent with\ncare. My impression is that I agree very much with Colonel\nBaddeley's estimates and generally think his revision sound on\nthe whole, though he tends to allow things to count too much.\nThis, however, is a fault on the right side for our present\npurpose. ... I have tried to compare the standard here\nwith the one on which I made my calculations in the real\nbook-tests. It is not very easy because the things one has\nto judge of vary so much, and the real tests include so many\nrather indefinite things ; but on the whole I think my standard\nwas higher than that we have applied here. But, as before\n\f608 Element of Chance in Book-Tests. [part\nremarked, that is a fault on the right side [since it tends to\nincrease the efficacy of mere chance in giving positive results].\nIt will be seen from this statement of Mrs. Sidgwick's\nthat since her standard, as she tells us, was rather higher\nthan that of Colonel Badcleley, we might expect\u2014if the\nresults in both cases were attributable to chance alone\n\u2014\nthat the percentage of success recorded in her report on\nthe Leonard book-tests would be rather smaller than the\npercentage of success in the records now under considera-\ntion. But, as the figures which we give below (p. 614)\nwill indicate, this was not the case.\nMrs. Sidgwick refers in the paragraph quoted above to\nanother difficulty which meets us in our enquiry. In the\nLeonard book-tests the indications given as to the nature\nof the message to be looked for vary greatly in precision,\nand therefore the degree of success easily attributable to\nchance varies also. In the present experiments we tried\nto meet this difficulty to some extent by giving three\ntests of varying degrees of precision. The first test was\nsuch as to leave considerable scope for individiial inter-\npretation ; the second left less to interpretation, but was\nof such a nature that a good many passages might be\nfound which in one way or another would fulfil the\nspecified requirements ; the third test was definite in\ncharacter and not such as would be easily fulfilled. As\nwas to be expected, the percentage of success was con-\nsiderably lower in the third test than in either of the\nother two.\nDetailed Report of the Experiments on Chance.\nThe following instructions were sent to all who took\npart in the experiment, together with a short covering\nletter (not printed here) setting before them the object of\nthe experiment.\nInstructions.\nChoose ten books at random, and enter their names on the\nattached form.\n\fI\nLxxxvii.] Element of Chance in Book-Tests. 609\nThen open the enclosed cover, in which you will find the\nthree messages chosen, together mth the page and position\non the page on which the messages are to be sought.\nAgainst each book, and in a separate column for e^ch test,\nenter the result as :\n\" success \" ;\n\" partial \" ;\nor '\u2022\nnil.\"\nIn the case of success, or partial success, wite under\n\" remarks \" such portion of the test and such brief explanation\nas will serve to elucidate the success.\nEnclosed in a separate envelope with the above in-\nstructions were the three tests. Experimenters were\nparticularly requested not to open this envelope until they\nhad selected their books, so that they might not be\ninfluenced in this selection by any conscious or sub-\nconscious knowledge concerning the contents of the books\nand the likelihood of references to the subjects of the tests.\nThe list of tests was as follows :\nTest 1. A passage which is particularly relevant to your\nfather.\nToj) quarter of pacje 60 in each hook.\nTest 2. An allusion to circles of some kind.\nBottom half of page 35 in each book.\nTest 3. Frost and snow, or a passage conveying that idea.\nThe top ten lines of page 84 in each book.\nSixty people took part in the experiment, and it will\nbe noted that they were asked to choose ten books and\nto search for each of the three tests in a specified part\nof each book. In aU therefore eighteen hundred passages ^\nwere examined, six hundj-ed for each test.\nThe table which is given below indicates the percentage of\nsuccesses (complete or partial) and of failures which were\nobtained with each of the three tests. The figures given\nhere are in accordance with Colonel Bacldeley's revised\n1\nIn giving this number we do not take into accomit that in six cases\nthe same book was chosen by two persons and in one case by three\npersons, a circumstance which does not affect calculations as to the degree\nof success attributable to chance.\n\f610 Eleinent of Chance in Book-Tests. [part\nestimate which\u2014as is indicated above\u2014differed in some\ncases from the estimate of the experimenters themselves.\nIn particular, experimenters sometimes reckoned as com-\nplete successes results which according to Colonel Badde-\nley's standard, and still more according to the standard\napphed by Mrs. Sidgwick to the Leonard book-tests, can\nonly be reckoned as partial successes. In the Appendix\nto this paper we have given some of these results in\ndetail, showing the effect of Colonel Baddeley's revision,\nso that readers may judge this matter for themselves.\nTable of Percentages.\nFor the purpose of calculating these percentages the\nresults were divided into four classes :\n(1) Comj^lete\nsuccess, (2) partial success, (3) slight success, (4) failure.\nThe table shows the percentages obtained (a) of complete\nsuccesses (S), (b) of complete and partial successes (S -hP),\n(c) of complete, partial and slight successes (S-t-P+P?).\nThe figures are given first for each test separately and\nthen for the average of the three tests taken together.\nTest I.\n(A passage which is 'particularly relevant to your father.)\nNumber of passages examined.

Percentages.\n1800 S - - 34\nS+P - - 85\nS+P+P? -138\n1-89\n4-72\n7-67\nThere are certain peculiarities in these results to which\nit seems worth while to call attention. In the first place\nit will be seen that all the percentages are higher in the\ncase of the second test. This can be explained by the\nfact that there are many things which in one way or\nanother convey the idea of a circle. The reference may\nbe explicit as, e.g. \" a small circular mirror,\" \" encircled\n. . . the circular shield,\"' and such passages are reckoned\nas full successes. But there may also be allusions to\ncircular objects, such as signet rings and cogwheels, and\nthese are reckoned as partial successes.\nIn regard to the third test two points may be noted.\nFirstly, it is the only one of the three tests in which\nthe effect of Colonel Baddeley's revision has been to\nincrease (in a very slight degree) the percentage of suc-\ncesses (S). The relevant figures are given below :\nPercentage as received. Revised percentage.\nTest I. - 2-5 1-6\nTest II. - 3-63 2-5\nTest III. 1-17 1-67\n\f612 Element of Chance in Book-Tests. [part\nThis increase in the percentage is due to the circum-\nstance that in three cases (see Appendix) Colonel Baddeley\nreckoned as full successes results which experimenters had\nreckoned only as partial successes. ;\nSecondly, the percentage of partial and slight successes\n(P + P ? ) is very mucli less in the case of the third test\nthan in either of the other two. The relevant figures are\ngiven in the table below :\nPercentage as received. Revised percentage.\nTest I. - 717 6-83\nTest II. 8-17 8-5 '\nTest III. 2-83 2-0\nThis circumstance can be explained by the fact that\nthe idea of frost and snow, being of a quite definite\ncharacter, hardly admits of such vague and doubtful\nreferences as were reckoned \" slight successes \" in the\ncase of the other tests. We have here a good example\nof how much the evidential value of book-tests may vary\nin proportion to the precision with which the subject of\nthe message has been indicated.\nWe may now turn to a comparison between the results\nobserved in the present experiments and those of the\nLeonard book-tests, as examined by Mrs. Sidgwick ; but\nin making this comparison one peculiarity of the Leonard\nresults must l)e taken into account. Ostensibly these\nresults come from a considerable number of different\ncommunicators (over thirty), and some communicators\nappear to have a much greater success in carrying out\nl^ook-tests than others. Consequently the percentage of\nsuccess will be found to be considerably lower if we take\nall the book-tests into account than if we consider only\nthose which i^urport to come from particularly siiccessful\ncommunicators\n.\nThis individual element is one which must be\nreckoned with in any comparison we make between the\n\fLXXXVII.] Element of Chance in Book-Tests. 613\nLeonard tests and the present experiments in chance\n-\ncoincidence, because if chance were the only factor in the\nLeonard results also, there would be no reason why one\ncommunicator should have more success than another.\nTo make a fair comparison it will be best to give figures\nshowing the percentage of success obtained (a) by taking-\nall the tests, {h) by taking only those which came from\ncertain particularly successful communicators. We need\nnot here concern ourselves with the problem as to whether\nbook-tests do in fact derive from the purporting com-\nmunicators, or whether they might be explained in some\nother way, e.g. by clairvoyance on the part of the medium.\nThe important point for our present purpose is that\ntests given in association with one supposed communicator\nshow a much higher percentage of success than those\ngiven in association with another.\nIn a footnote to her paper on book-tests {Proc. S.P.R.,\nVol. XXXI., pp. 245, 246) Mrs. Sidgwick writes as\nfollows :\nThere were 34 sitters whose book-tests were verified . . .\nThese sitters had amongst them 146 sittings at which book-\ntests were given, and at these sittings about 532 separate\nbook-test items occurred . . . Tliese 532 items may be classed\nas 92 successful ; 100 approximately successful ; 204 complete\nfailures ; 40 nearly complete failures ; 96 dubious. Taking\nthe first two classes together we may say that almost 36 per\ncent, of the attempts were approximately successful.\n\" The first two classes \" referred to by Mrs. Sidgwick\nmay be taken as corresponding with those results in the\npresent experiments which have been classed as S (success)\nand P (partial success). From the table given above\n(p. 611) it will be seen that taking the combined results\nof the three tests the percentage of S 4-P was 4-7, so\nthat the whole number of book-tests examined by Mrs.\nSidgwick show a percentage of complete or partial suc-\ncesses very considerably greater than the percentage\nobtained in the present experiments, 36 per cent, as\ncompared with 4-7 per cent. But the balance is even\n\f614 Element of Chance in Book-Tests. [part\nmore definitely in favour of the Leonard results, if we\nconsider the tests given by certain individual communi-\ncators. The following table gives the percentage of\nsuccess obtained (a) in the three experimental tests, (b) in\nthe tests given by three successful communicators whom\nwe will call X, Y and Z.\nNo. of Results\nexamined.\nS.

But, as it is,\nthe net was spread fairly ^vdde. The total number of\nresults examined by Mrs. Sidgwick, 532, is not far short\nof the number of results examined in regard to each of\nthe three experimental tests, 600, and the percentages\ngiven in the table above show that even if we include in\nour reckoning a considerable number of comparatively\nunsuccessful communicators, the percentage of success is\nmuch higher in the Leonard tests than in the chance\nexperiments.\n\fLxxxvii.] Element of Chance in Book-Tests. 615\n0\nAPPENDIX.\nWe give below five specimen results together with the\nremarks made by the experimenters and Colonel Badde-\nley's comments, so that the readers may judge of the\nstandard applied.\nI.\nNo. Name of Book.

Hoopee, M.A.\nIt is now well known that certain subjects, after passing\nout of the hypnotic state, do not remember anything\nthat they have done or that has been said to them\nduring their trance. Notwithstanding this amnesia, how-\never, they will in their waking state, and sometimes\nduring their normal sleep, carry out suggestions made to\nthem in the trance with remarkable fidelity, fulfilling\nthem at the correct time with surprising accuracy. The\ninterestmg thing about such achievements by some\nnambules is that at first sight they appear to have the\nfaculty of appreciating the passage of time without the\naid of the perception of changes in the external world.\nFor example, one of Dr. Bramwell's patients was told\nwhilst in the hypnotic state to make a cross and write\ndown what she judged to be the time after the expira-\ntion of a certain number of minutes without, or at least\nbefore, consulting a time-piece. The time-intervals m\nthe experiments varied from 320 minutes to 21,434\nminutes. Out of a total of 55 experiments, 26 were\nfulfilled in the waking state, 15 in hypnosis, 13 in natural\n2e\n\f622 Sydney E. Hooper, 31.A. [PABT'\nsleep, only one being doubtful. Discrepancies occurred in\n9 instances, but the errors ranged from 1 to 5 minutes\nonly. When asked in hypnosis how these achievements\nwere effected, the subject informed Dr. Bramwell :\n^\n(1) That when the suggestions were made in hypnosis\nshe did not calculate when they fell due.\n(2) That she did not calculate them any time after-\nwards during hypnosis.\n(3) That she had no recollection of them when hypnosis\nterminated.\n(4) That no memory of them ever afterwards awoke\nin her waking state.\n(5) That shortly before their fulfilment she always\nexperienced a motor impulse\n\u2014\ni.e. her fingers moved\nas if to grasp a pencil and to perform the act of\nwriting.\n(6) That this impulse was immediately followed by the\nidea of making a cross and writing certain figures.\n(7) That she never looked, at clock or ivatch until after\nshe had made her record.\nNow, normally, it is by means of certain changes\nregularly occurring in the world in which we live, such\nas the Earth's revolution roinid the sun, the rotation of\nthe Earth on its axis, the revolution of the moon round\nthe Earth, that we are able conventionally to divide\n'\ntime's continuous flow '\ninto years, months, days. We\nalso employ for our convenience certain mechanisms like\nthe clock or watch, which are devised in such a way as\nto produce movements over tracts of space at a constant\nvelocity, to assist us in subdviding the passage of time\ninto smaller intervals.

Days, hours, mimites, seconds, are\ndevices for measuring the number of sensory chaiages\nexperienced in succession, and \" Time Psychological\ndatum is but a quality of our sensations and feelings.\"\nThus, awareness of change in our sensory presentations is\na necessary condition of our perception of time.\nIf, then, no calculations as to when the suggestions\nfell due were made by Dr. BramwelFs subject, and if,\nfurther, no watching or noting of the regular planetary\nmovements and the movements of clocks or watches\ntook place to measure the passage of time, then it would\nseem that a somnambule possesses what might be called\nan intuitive '\nknowledge of the flight of time, and is\nnot dependent, as normally we are, upon changes takmg\nplace in the world and upon mechanisms for measuring\nsuch changes.\nIt will be admitted that if this is the case, then it is\na very remarkable mental endowment, and its discovery\nof great interest to the Science of Psychology ; con-\nsequently, in the hope of learning the truth of the matter,\nI began an experimental investigation in the winter of\nlast year. Fortunately, in the course of my professional\nwork, I became acquainted with two somnambules, who\nwere kind enough to submit themselves to a series of\nexperiments. One of the subjects, \" Miss E.,'\" is em-\nployed as a clerk in the City, and during the time covered\nby the investigations w\"as a student in a class studying\nPsychology, of which I am the Tutor. The other subject,\n\" Mrs. L.,\" who Hves in the country not far from my\nhome, is a lady of keen intellectual interests, endowed\nmth considerable powers of literary imagination and\nexpression.\nI began my investigations with experiments on \" Miss\nE.,\" the nature and results of which I now proceed to\ngive.\nSubject 1.

If 6.45 be taken as the time when the\nimpulse was '\nvirtually '\nfulfilled, there is an error\nof 15 minutes, but Miss E. did not actually\nfulfil the suggestion until 7.10 p.m. In this case\nthere would be an error of 10 minutes, but I am\nnot quite certain, within ten minutes, when the\nI suggestion was made, as it was a long sitting,\nduring which I performed several other experi-\nments. It is to be noted that this is the only\nexperiment in which there is any appreciable\ndiscrepancy between the actual time at which she\nfelt the impulse and the time written down.\nThere was a break of three months before further\nexperiments dealing with any considerable periods of\ntime were conducted on Miss E. Up to April, I covild\nnot boast of having obtained any insight into the actual\nmental processes involved in the fulfilment of the sug-\ngestions. I was profoundly puzzled. I had frequently\nasked Miss E. in hypnosis whether she made calculations,\nand she assured me on each occasion in the negative.\nWhen requested to say how she did the tasks set her,\nshe replied that she did not know. All she could\nsay was that when the figures were given to her, she\n\"'\nsaw ' them very clearly and that she wrote down the\ntime when she felt an impulse to do so. So far, then,\nI had evidence only of subliminal mental activity. But\nof its nature and modus operandi, neither I nor the\nsubject knew anything. Could it be that somnambules\npossessed a super-normal power of apprehending the\npassage of time '\nintuitively '\n? I coidcl not say.\nIt was at this juncture that your President, Dr.\nMitchell, kindly lent me his -\nilluminating paper to this\nSociety on the subject,^ which stimulated me to make\niurther investigations. About this time also I met my\nsecond subject, Mrs. L., and began a series of experi-\n1 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. : The Appreciation of Time hy Somnambules.\nFroc. S.P.R. Vol. XXI., pp. 2-59.\n\f628 Sydney E. Hooper, 31.A. [part-\nments with her. Profiting by the valuable work already\naccomplished by Dr. Mitchell, I was able to glean in\nhypnosis from Mrs. L. information which helped me con-\nsiderably when I resumed my experiments in September\nwith Miss E. I will deal with these later experiments\nnow before proceeding to the other work which I had.\ndone in the interim.\nThere seemed at this stage to be two problems demand-\ning, if possible, a solution.\n1. If no calculations were made, how was it possible\nfor the subject to know when a period of time\nrepresented by so many hundreds or thousands of\nminutes would elapse ?\n2. The second problem is closely related to, though\ndifferent from, the first. Assuming that the subject,\nthough unknown even to a certain stratum of her\nhypnotic consciousness, calculated that a suggestion\nto be performed in (say) 7670 mimites fell due at\n9.10 p.m. on such and such a date, the question\nstill remained how the subliminal mind knew when\nthis time had arrived, unless it made use of the\nnormal waking mind to watch and '\ntich off,' as it\nivere, the hours and, mimites as they passed.\nIt was in the hope of clearing up these two problems\nthat I conducted two further experiments on Miss E.\nin September of this year. In these two experiments\nI told Miss E. the time when I gave her the suggestion.\nIn the earlier ones I had not done this, and, as has\nalready been said, I am inclined to think this omission\nwas responsible for such small errors as occurred.\nNo. 11. Monday, September 11th, 1922. 7 p.m. Due 3.30\np.m., September 13th.\nSuggestion in hypnosis. \" At the expiration of 2670\nminutes make a cross and put down the time\nbefore looking at any time-piece.\"\nI then asked her the time. She replied, \" Ten\npast seven.\" I told her she was wrong, and that\nit was seven o'clock. This seems to bear out the\n\f.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambides 629\ntheory that Miss E. guessed the times at which\nsuggestions were given.\nResult. Miss E. called on me on Thursday, September\n14th, and handed me a piece of paper with 3.30\non it. She had wTitten it on feeling an impulse\nat 3.25 p.m. on the Wednesday. vShe informed me\nthat she was in the office checking a column of\nfigures when suddenly she said. \" 3.30 Mr.\n.\nHooper.\" She did not look at the clock until\nsome seconds later. It was then just 3.25 p.m.\nIn reply to some further questions, she \\vrote :\n\" You see I felt I had to tell you something, but\nit was such a blank, vague feeling : a feeling\nthat I had forgotten to come to you, and I\ncouldn't recollect when I Avas to tell you, and\nlooked at the clock, expecting to find it too late\nto keep our appointment. This feeling could\nonly have lasted a few seconds, so that it must\nhave happened some\"\\A\"here near five-and-twenty\npast three.\"'\nRemarks. If the ofiice clock were right, there is an\nerror of five minutes in her estimate of the time\nthat had elapsed.\nFurther, I should like to say a word about\nthe '\nvague ^ feeling that lasted for a few seconds\nonly. I cannot but surmise that this was caused\nby the momentary emergence of the hypnotic\nconsciousness at the time she said, '\"\nThree-thirty\nMr. Hooper.\" We should expect, if this were\nthe certain temporary confusion of mind.\nMoreover, I think this explains her feeling that\n\" I had forgotten to come to you,\" and the fact\nthat \" I couldn't recollect when I was to tell you.\"\nWhen I gave her the suggestion in hypnosis on\nSeptember 11th, I told her that next time she\nsaw me she would be able to tell me something\nof her mental processes in fulfilling the suggestion,\nand also that she would want to come and tell\nme. This, I think, has something to do with\n\f630 Sydney E. Hooper, M.A. [part\nher looking at the clock and expecting to find it\ntoo late to keep her appointment. Although her\nhypnotic consciousness would know exactly Avhat\nwas said to her during the previous sitting, her\nnormal waking consciousness would not. Hence\na state of anxiety and confusion.\nI was eager to try if I could discover any genuine\ninformation concerning the method adopted by the subject\nin fiilfilling the. suggestion given in this experijuent, and\nfollowing a hnit contained in Dr. Mitchell's paper, I put\nher into a deeper state of hypnosis than usual. It will\nbe remembered that on all previous occasions she had\ntold me that no calculations were made, and that she\ndid not know how she was able to fulfil the suggestions\n(for the most part) at the correct time. On this occasion,\nhowever, when I asked her how she did this particular\nsum, she replied :\n\" I remember making the calculation immediately after\nthe suggestion was given.\"\nBy this she meant during the time she was in hypnosis\non September the 11th. This I regarded as an important\nstatement. If a calculation were made in this case, why\nnot in the others 1 The performances of my somnambule\nwere assuming a less miraculous guise. I then told her\nthat when I piit my hand on her forehead she woiilcl be\nable to tell me exactly the steps she took in making the\ncalculations. She at once told me she '\nsaw '\nthe figures\nshe had employed, and I asked her to write them down.\nShe wrote as follows :\n60\/2670\n44 30\nHere, then, we have the actual mental process. The\nsubject divided the number of minutes given in the sug-\ngestion by 60, which gave her in hours, viz. 44i, the time\nwhen the act was to be done. Thus, some level of her\nsubliminal mind knew soon after the suggestion was\ngiven that it fell clue in forty-four and a half hours.\nThis is c^uite correct. Whether she actually carried the\ncalculation one step further, viz. that 44 hours 30 minutes\n\fI.XXXVIII.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnamhules 631\nfrom 7 p.m., September 11th, fell due at 3.30 p.m.,\nSeptember 13th, I did not discover.\nI then asked her how she had known when the\nterminal minute\n\u2014\ni.e. the precise time for the performance\nof the act\u2014arrived. She replied at first, \" It just came\nup.\" Pressed to tell me how she knew when it fell\ndue, she replied, \" I counted : I began counting from\n7 o'clock when you gave me the number.\" When asked\nwhat she counted, she replied, \" Spaces.\" In reply to\nthe question as to the size of the spaces, she said, \" Not\nvery big.\" Asked how she knew when a minute or an\nhour had passed, she replied, \" By a certain space.\"\nAgain asked to say how she knew when the terminal\nminute had arrived, she said, \" I simply went on counting\nnntil it came to an end, and then I did it.\" Questioned\nas to whether the co^^ntulg interfered with her waldng\nmmd, she replied, \" No, it seemed separate from my waking\nmind.\" She further emphatically denied making use of\nany clocks or watches in determining the correct time the\nact was to be performed.\nThe result of this experiment I deemed of great value.\nAt least it seemed clear that in this instance calculation\nwas the method employed by the subliminal mind for\ndiscovering, at any rate so far as the hours were con-\ncerned, '\nwhen ' the suggestion fell due. I was still,\nhowever, uncertain as to what was involved in her method\nof '\ncounting spaces.' What did a space stand for ? A\nminute, an hour, or what ? Again, if she counted 60\nspaces to the hour, how was she able to be so accurate\nin her judgment of the intervals between her one, two,\nthree, etc., so that they corresponded with the actual\nminutes of the clock 1 Another possibility suggested\nitself to my mind. The counting of spaces may have\nbeen her way of '\nticking off ' the 44 hours 30 minutes\nthat she had already calculated. Her sul)hminal mind\nmay have made use of her normal waking consciousness,\nwhich would be in contact with the time of day, to\ninform it of the hours and minutes as they passed, just\nas the old-world watchmen informed the inmates of\ndwelling-houses in the days of yore. At this sitting I\n\f632 Sydriey E. Hooper, M.A. [part\ncould not decide these points to my satisfaction, and\nI therefore determined to have a further meeting.\nNo. 12.

Miss E. handed me a piece of paper on the\nevenmg of September 28tli, on whicli was written :\n\" 11.15 Thursday. 11.14 by the Oifice clock.\"\nThe cross was omitted. We may take this\nexperiment as correctly fulfilled, assuming that\nthe Office clock might be one minute slow.\nRemarks. Although I considered the results of experi-\nment No. 11 had all but solved the '\nmystery '\nof\nthese time achievements, I was still in doubt on\none or two important items, and I hoped to be\nable to clear up these questions at this sitting if\nI could penetrate sufficiently deeply into the\nmental processes of my subject's hyj)notic con-\nsciousness. I therefore requested her to go into\na deep stage of hypnosis. Whilst she was in\nthis state I asked her if she remembered the\nsuggestion I had given her on Tuesday evening.\nAfter some hesitation, she said. \" I see the\nmimber.\"\n\" Tell me what it is.\"'\nVery slowly, and with apparent difficulty, she\nreplied, \" 2270.\n(The number actually given was 2280.)\nI then asked her what this number reiDresented.\nShe replied, \" Minutes.\"\nI next made her tell me exactly how she had\ncarried out my suggestion. She said, \" I found\nout the hours.\" Asked to show me in writing,\nshe wrote down :\n60\/ 2270\n38\n\fxxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules 633\nIt is clear, then, that she arrived at the number\nof hours, thirtjj-'eight, by division of 2280 by 60.\nThirty-eight hours is correct, and I feel confident\nthat she obtained this result hy dividing 22S0 by\n60, and not 2270. For this reason : the subject\nhad some difficulty in actually \"\nvisualising '\nthis\nnumber when in deep hypnosis I asked her to\nrecall it ; and it is obvious, I think, that she\nmust have substituted seven for eight in the\nrevival.\nSo far, then, we have confirnied the information obtained\nin the last experiment as to the method employed by the\nsubliminal mind. I was assured on both occasions that\nthe calculations were made as soon as the number was\ngiven, i.e. when the subject was in hypnosis. It does\nnot, however, follow, I thmk, that in all the previous\nexperiments the calculations were made immediately the\nnumbers were given. Perhaps the more difficult cues\nmay have been made at some later time.\nI now endeavoured to discover how my subject knew\nwhen thirty-eight hours had elapsed, and how she cleter-\nminea the arrival of the crucial minute when the act\nwas to be performed. Whilst she was still m deep\nihypnosis, I told her she would be able to tell me how\nshe knew when a minute and an hour had passed. She\nsaid, \" I started to count up to sixty.\" In reply to my\nquestion as to what sixty represented, she said, \" A\nminute.\" \" Well, then, Avhen you reached sixtj', v\/hat\ndid you do ?\n\" She replied, \" I did it again.\" What\nthen 1\n\" \"I did it again,\" and so on. She then\ninformed me that she went on counting in this way\nuntil she reached an hour, i.e. sixty times sixty, when\nshe began over again until she reached another hour, and\nso on. \" After I had done it thirty-eight times, I made\na cross.\" (The cross was in reality omitted.)\n\" Do you mean that you went on counting all the\ntime ?\n\" I asked. She replied, \" Yes.\" \" During the\ntime when you were asleep ?\n\" \" Yes.\"\nAsked how she knew that the intervals of her counting\n\f634 Sydney E. Hooper, M.A. [part\ncorresponded exactly to a second, she replied, \" It just\nfeels like that.\"\nIn reply to my query as to whether she ever checked\nher counting by the clock, she answered emphatically,\n\" Never until after I have put it down.\"\nI asked if this counting in any way interfered with\nher normal waking life ; she replied, \" No.\" Again\nasked when she did the calculations, she said, \" At once\n\"\nand \" I find it quite easy.\"\"\nWhereupon I gave her a test. \" If you find the\ncalculations quite easy, write down when 5000 minutes\nfalls due from now, 6.15 p.m., Thursday 28th September.\"\nThe result of this was to disclose the fact that '\nthey\nwere not so easy '\nafter all\u2014at least not all of them.\nShe wrote down :\n5000\n888 . 20\nThen hesitated, and finally said, \" I don't loiow when\nit would fall due,\" and gave up the attempt. It will\nbe observed that the subject started to divide the 5000\nby 60, but at once began to make mistakes. The answer\nis 83 hours 20 minutes. Her failure in this test suggests\nstrongly to my mind that the success of her achieve-\nments in performing the acts at the right time was not\ndependent upon her making the correct calculation m\nhours immediately after the number of minutes was given.\nIn those cases where the number was easily mampulated\nby the divisor 60, it may have been done at once. In\nother cases the determination of the number of hours in\na given number of minutes was probably done at leisure\nat some subsequent time.\nAfter Miss E. had said, \" I don't know when it would\nfall due,\" I said, \" What would you do if I told you\nnow to make a cross at the end of 5000 minutes ?\n\" To\nthis she rephed, \" I should start counting.\" \" Well, what\nthen ?\n\" \"I should go on counting until I had nothing\nleft.\"\nIt seemed clear, then, that counting from the moment\nthe suggestion is given is the heart of her method. This\n\fLxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnamhules 635\nentails in long-time experiments a continuous counting\nday and night into many thousands ; in the last experi-\nment. No. 12, it meant counting 136,800 intervals.\nBut how did Miss E. know that, in this last experiment,\n11.15 a.m. was the correct time for fulfilling the sug-\ngestion ? Neither the knowledge that the act was to be\ndone at the end of 38 hours nor the laborious work of\ncounting up to 136,800 woiild supply her with this\ninformation. Two methods were at her disposal :\n(1) Some level of her subliminal mind might have\ncarried the calculation a stage further, determining that\n38 hours fell due at 11.15 a.m. on Thursday, September\nthe twenty-eighth. In this event, when she had finished\naccurately counting out her thirty-eight hours, she would\nknow it was eleven-fifteen.\n(2) The method of '\naddition \"\nmay have been employed.\nI mean by this that after an hour had been counted.\nthrough it could be added to the time at which the\nsuggestion was given, viz. 9.15 p.m., e.g., at the end of\none hour 10.15, two hours 11.15, and so on. This\nprocess would have to be repeated at regular intervals\nuntil the thirty-eight hours had been completed. Her\nmind wovdd thus know the time throughout the period\nof her counting. When she had counted out her\nthirty-eight hours, she woidd then discern it was\neleven-fifteen, or indeed might even know this earher by\nanticipation.\nFeeling somewhat amazed that Miss E. performed these\nexperiments by what, m the normal waking life, would\nbe a very unreliable measure of the flow of time, viz.\ncounting, I gave her a few tests in hypnosis, both on the\nevening of the 14th September and the 28th September,\nas follows :\n\u2014\n1.

At 6.41 Miss E. said, \" Four minutes.\"\nError, 1 minute short.\nAsked to illustrate by counting aloud, she\nproceeded to count up to 60. Each interval on\nthis occasion was certainly meant to be a second.\nThese few experiments yielded a mean error of\n61 '4 seconds. Whether if a sufficient number of\nthese tests had been made the plus and minus\nresults would have eventually neutralised each\nother, I am not sufficient mathematician to be\nable to say.\n\fLxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules 637\nNotwithstanding the errors in these few short tests,\nI am compelled to accept the subject's statement, given\nin deep hjrpnosis, that she performed the long-time\nexperiments by the method of counting, although I am\nunable to say why she should have been so accurate m\nthe long intervals, whilst making discrepancies in the\nshort tests. I observe that Dr. Mitchell also found a\ntendency to slight errors in the tests of short periods\nmade by him. In a series of 60 observations on various\nsubjects, with periods varying from one minute to half\nan hour, the mean error was \"89 minute.\nConcluding Remarks on Subject 1.\nIt seems patent from the answers elicited from jVIiss E.\nin deep hj^pnosis that calculation of the number of hours\nrepresented by a given number of minutes, together with\nrhythmic counting from the moment the suggestion was\ngiven, was the method adopted in fulfilling them. This\ninvolved that the process of counting should continue\nboth during normal sleep and diiring the performance of\nordinary everyday work. In this connection it is interest-\ning to note that on one occasion the counting of Miss E.'s\nsubliminal mind came to an end whilst she was adding\nup a column of figures with, her supraliminal mind, the\nlatter in no way disturbed by the former. Another\nfeature that strikes me as remarkable is what may be\ncalled the unruffled patience of the subliminal level of\nthe mind, wliich went on rhythmically counting 136,800\nintervals m the last experiment Avithout complaint or\neven boredom, showing a persistency of purpose worthy\not a greater cause.\nStill another feature to arouse v\/onder is that of the\naccuracy of the counting. It is no mean performance to\ncount continuously for thirty-eight hours, in such a manner\nthat the intervals between the digits one, two, three, etc.,\nexactly correspond with the '\nsecond '\nintervals as recorded\nby the clock. And yet this is implied in the informa-\ntion supplied to me by Miss E. in deep hypnosis.\nWhen after the experiments were over Miss E. was\ninformed that this seemed to be her method, she expressed\n\f638 Sydney E. Hooper, 31.A. [part\ngreat amazement, saying : \"I could never count accurately\nlike that with my waking mind.\" Indeed, I do not\nthink she could, nor, I think, could anyone else.\nAre we then to conclude that the subhminal mind of\nMiss E. reveals a supernormal faculty of measurmg the\npassage of time ? I do not see how we can reply in\nany other way than by saying that at least the accuracy\nof counting of the subhminal mind as disclosed by these\nexperiments is supernormal when compared with the\nfiuprahminal. Few, I think, will disagree with this con-\nclusion. We must be on our guard, however, against\nconfusing the term '\nsupernormal '\nwith supernatural.\nThere is nothing in the experiments to suggest that the\nachievements of Miss E. were performed by any other\npowers than those which belong to the domain of the\nhuman mind. But '\nhow '\nsuch precise correlation be-\ntween the second as measured by the clock and the\ncounting by the mind prevails, is not revealed. My\nsubject could only say when asked how she knew that\nthe intervals between each count corresponded to a\nsecond as measured by the clock, was :\n\" It just feels\nlike that.\"\nIt is on this point that Dr. Mitchell has made an\ninteresting suggestion. ^ He says : \"It seems probable\nthat the lower strata of consciousness can take cognisance\nof various organic processes which are, or may be, un-\nperceived or generally unattended to by the waking self.\nAnd if a correlation has been subconsciously estabUshed\nbetween such phases of organic Ufe and our artificial\ndivisions of time, the subconscious watcher is pro-\nvided with an objective time-measurer which is liable to\nonly slight variations of regularity. Such variations as\nnormally take place in the rate of the heart-beat, or of\nrespiratory movements, are just such as would account\nfor the inaccuracies exhibited by somnambules in their\nestimates of short periods. In longer periods of true\ntime-watching the organic rhythm will usually average ite\nnormal rate, and consequently the amount of error in\n1 The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules, hy T.

All one can say is, that\nsome correlation between the rate of counting and the\nclock second obviously existed in the subliminal mind.\nIn what, however, the correlation exactly con^sisted, I am\nunable to surmise.\nSubject No. 2. \" Mrs. L.\"\nThe experiments on Mrs. L. were begun in the Spring\nof this year, and continued throughout the Summer.\nAt each sitting the subject was told the^j^time when\nthe suggestion was given.\nNo. 1. 7.15 p.m. Friday, March 10th.

I did 9.55 later during the\nnight ; it is right.\" And so it is. (Correct.)\nIt will be observed in one of my experiments (No. 6)\nI endeavoured to find out how long the subliminal mind\nwould take to work out a simple sum wdthout hurrying\nthe process in any way. The sum was given at 3.8 p.m.\non June 9th. It was not, however, until the evening of\nthe same day that the answer to the sum was written\ndown. Thus the subliminal mind on this occasion took\nseveral hours to work out the simple sum, \" When will\n1760 minutes fall due from noAv, 3.8 p.m.\" Of course\nit might have performed the operation in a much shorter\ntime had it chosen to do so. It certainly did the calcula-\ntions involved in the next set of experiments \" How\n\fSydney E. Hooper, 31. A. [part\nmany ?\n\" much more rapidly. On another occasion I\ngave the following sum :\n\u2014\nNo. 10. \" How many inches are there m 2f miles ?\n\" (Given\n3.40 p.m., August 3rd.) I asked that the subject\nshould begin to work this out as soon as she\ncame out of hypnosis, and should record the\ntime when the answer had been found.\nEesulf. My wife mforms me that at 6.20 p.m. the\nsame evening, whilst subject and she were sittmg\ndown chatting, Mrs. L., apmpos of nothing, sud-\ndenly asked, \" How many inches are there m a\nmile ?\n\" ; to which she replied, '\u2022\nAt any rate\nthere are 1760 feet.\" (Evidently both had\nforgotten then- long measure tables learnt at\nschool.) Then Mrs. L. began to wonder why\nshe wanted to luiow. Later, the number 20,120\ncame into her mind with various other iigures,\nas if she were trying to calculate something\nwithout loiowmg what. At 7.15 p.m. the same\nevening she wrote down 55,330 ms., with the\ntime and date. The following mornmg (August\n4th) she awoke with the number 58,080 fnmly\nplanted in her mind, which remamed there and\nthoroughly annoj^ed her until she had written it\ndown, when it ceased from troubling. On the\nevening of August 4th, Mrs. L. handed me a\npiece of paper contamuig the remarks above. I\nimmediately hypnotised her, and she told me\nthat the 58,080 represented the number of inches\nin 2f miles. I then asked her to show me how\nshe did this sum, and she proceeded to write on\nthe paper the following details :\n]760 X ]2 = 21120\nS 2 S 0\n= 58080\nRemarks. The correct answer is 174,240 mches.\nIt will be noticed that the subject has evidently\ntaken 1760 x 12 to represent the number of inches\n\fLxxxvili.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnmnbules 645\nin a mile. This is a mistake. She has omitted\nto reduce the yards (1760) to feet before multiply-\ning by twelve. In hypnosis I told her this,\nand she said, \" Your wife told me there were\n1760 feet in a mile.\" She further informed me\nthat she found the sum very difficult (as indeed\nit is to perform mentally), and said that it\ntroubled her considerably. Asked when she did\nit, she said, \" I began to do it about 6.20 p.m.,\nand finished it about 7.30 p.m. I did it wrongly\nat first, and corrected it just as I was going to\nsleep.\"\nIt is further to be noted that although the\nsuggestion was given at 3.40 p.m., the subliminal\nmind did not apparently begin operations until\n6.20 p.m.\u2014(Was it because of the difficulty over\nthe long-measure table 1) \u2014and that the answer,\n\u2014correct on the assumption that there were 1760\n'\nfeet ' in a mile,\u2014was not accurately arrived at\nuntil \" Just as I was going to sleep.\"\nIt would appear, then, that four to five hours\nwere taken to work the sum. Whether the\nnormal waking mind of the subject, without the\nassistance of ^\\riting, A\\\"ould have taken as long,\nI do not know ; but from this experiment it\nwould seem that the sublimmal mind takes its\nown time over its problems when there is no\nneed for an immediate solution.\nGeneral Remarks.\nI do not think there can be any doubt that in all the\nabove experiments, without exception, the answers were\nobtained by calculation in the intervals between the time\nthe suggestions were given and the time at which they\nfell clue. Indeed, the subject in deep hypnosis acknow-\nledged that this was so. She said, \" When you give the\nsuggestion to me first, I just see how many days there\nare, and do the details later.\"\n\" Do you calculate them ?\n\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\f646 Sydney E. Hooper, 31.A. [part\n\" How ?\n\"\n\" You cannot do them if your mind is absorbed in\nsomething. It must be when you can take some of\nyour attention.\"\nOn another occasion she said in hypnosis :\n\" I think I\ngenerally do them just as I am going to sleep.\"\nIn these first ten experiments, the suggestions were\nfulfilled correctly on four occasions ; one performance was\nentirely Avrong ; five were erroneous owing to carelessness\nor misunderstanding. Mrs. L. informs me that whilst at\nschool she often spoiled her mathematical work by little\ncareless blunders. Mrs. L. also wrote with reference to\nthe calculations, in automatic script, \" They worry me,\"\nwhich is in curious contrast to the unruffled calm of my\nother subject, Miss E., in her long periods of steady\ncounting, although even the latter complained to me on\nseveral occasions of feeling very tired.\nThe question as to how the subject fulfilled some of\nthem at the right terminal minute was also investigated.\nOn several occasions I asked Mrs. L. in deep hypnosis\nhow she knew when the actual minute had arrived for\nperforming the act. She replied when I first made the\nenquiry, \" You just keep a general idea of the passage\nof time and check it by the clock.\" A similar explana-\ntion was given in slightly different words when the\nquestion was repeated from time to time.\nFirst, then, a calculation was made as to when a given\nsuggestion fell due ; then the subconscious mind kept a\nwatch on the time to enable it to fulfil the suggestion\nat the right moment.\nIn the ten experiments just described there seems no\nground for thinking that the subject revealed any remark-\nable faculty of appreciating the passage of time without\nthe aid of objective conventional measures such as days,\nhours, etc., as recorded by the clock. All that took\nplace was a subconscious calculation of when so many\nhundreds or thousands of minutes from a given specified\ntime would expire. When the time actually fell due, an\nimpulse] ^was given to the normal waking mind to write\ndown the result of the calculation in accordance with\n\fLxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnamhules 647\nthe suggestion. I agree with Dr. Mitchell, who says in\nhis paper : \"So far there is evidence only that a sub-\nconscious calculation is made soon after the suggestion is\ngiven, and if the date so arrived at is some weeks ahead,\nthe subconscious mind, having noted the time at which\nthe act is to be performed, seems able to go off dutj' as\nit were and simply watch for the arrival of the proper\nday.\" These remarks were generally true in reference to\nthe method adopted by Mrs. L., except that in her case\nshe seemed to make a more or less rough calculation at\nfirst, leaving the accurate details to be worked out at leisure.\nMy next care therefore was to devise experiments to\neliminate the possibility of a direct calculation. Con-\nsequently I adopted Dr. Mitchell's method, which was to\nmake the subject tell the number of days, hours or\nminutes which had elapsed between the giving of the\nsuggestion and a pre-arranged signal. Dr. ]\\'Iitchell\nthought it was possible in this way, where the answers\nwere correct, to show that it was due to a contimious\nsubconscious watching of time as it flowed.\nI will now give this series of experiments with their\nresults :\n\u2014\nNo. 11.

On handing me the paper with these\nfigures on it (written in hypnosis), she remarked,\n\" I generally keep it in this way, i.e. every twelve\nhours.\" By this she obviously meant that she\nkept count of every twelve hours as it passed.\n\" For several days,\" she wrote on the morning of\nAugust 4th, \" there has been a series of figures\ncoming into my thoughts without connection\n\u2014\n1 \u20142\u20143, as if keeping a reckoning.

I asked the subject (in\nhypnosis) how she knew the_ answer was six\ntimes twelve hours plus something. She replied,\n\" I kei3t the number every twelve hours. By\nthe time you handed me the paper I had kept\nsix. I just had to multiply 720 by 6 and add\n4 hours.\"\nRemarks. Here we have an example of subliminal\nwatching of periods of twelve hours and adding\nthem up. It is to be noted that the actual\ncalculations were not performed until the paper\nwas handed to her at 9.28 p.m. There was an\nerror in her calculation of 18 minutes, the correct\nanswer being 4542. I asked her in hy|inosis how\nshe had come to make this error. She replied,\n\" I thought it was 9.46 ^.m. when you gave me\nthe paper.\" As a matter of fact, it was only\n9.28, but I discovered later in the evening that\n\fLxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnmnbules 655\nMrs. L.'s clock had been ten minutes fast all day,\nwhich accounts for ten minutes of the 18 minutes'\nerror.\nIt is worthy of notice that the subconscious\nmind must apparently in some circumstances\nattempt to '\nguess '\nthe right time. On this\noccasion it failed in the same way that we often\ndo in the normal waking life. There is no\nindication of clairvoyance or abnormal gift revealed\nby these experiments.\nAlthough this second batch of experiments (11-\n17) were devised with the object of ensuring a\ncontinuous watching of the passage of time and\nof eliminating the possibility of calculations, they\ndid not have this effect. With the exception of\nExi:)eriments Nos. 15 and 17, in which periods of\ntwelve hours were watched and added together,\ncalculation \\ya,s merely postponed. It a^spears\nthat in all the others a rapid calculation was\nmade during the interval between the time the\npre-arranged signal was given and the automatic\nresponse in writing or speech. Seeing that the\n. subject lme^^' the time at which a suggestion had\nbeen given and had more or less accurate loiow-\nledge of the time when the signal occurred, it is\nclear that in these operations we have nothing\nbut ordinary mental arithmetic.\nIn writing on the subject of the appreciation of time\nby somnambules, Dr. Mitchell has, it seems to me, rightly\nsaid that ^ True time-appreciation is the power of mark-\ning the passage of time without any guidance either\nsupra-lirainal or sub-liminal, which can by any possibility\nbe referred to changes going on in the external world.\"'\nIn his paper read to this Society he records a case of\none of his patients to whom he had had to recommend\na forty-eight hours\" sleep with but short intervals for\nthe taking of nourishment. He is of the opinion that\n1 The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules, by T. W. Mitchell, M.D.,\nProc. S.P.R., Vol. XXI.. p 51.\n\f656 Sydney E. Hooper, M.A. [pabt '\ni:\nthis lady showed a true appreciation of the passage of si\ntime throughout the whole period of sleep, and considers j\nii\nthat the watching of the time was done by the hypnotic j\n\u00ab\nconsciousness, and that the knowledge of the time of day i\nso obtained was in the possession of the hypnotic con- |\n'\nsciousness alone. '\nIn order to discover if somnambules have the power of\n'\ntrue '\ntime appreciation as defined above, experiments must\nbe devised to ensure that the subject is debarred from !\n;\ngaining any information as to the passage of time '\nfrom changes taking place in the world around them.\nThis precaution is necessary because impressions received\nthrough the eye or ear which give information as to the\ntime of day to the waking consciousness will be also at\nthe service of the hypnotic consciousness, and the alert\nhypnotic consciousness, intent on performing its task\ncorrectly, will be on the look-out for such information.\nThis will be the case even when the waking mind is so ^\nfully occupied on other matters as apparently to preclude 5\nall time-watching. Seeing, however, that it is possible\nthat subconscious perception has the extended range\nwhich characterises perception during hypnosis under the\ninfluence of suggestion, the difficulty of devising experi-\nments to ensure that the subconscious mind does not\nglean information through the ordinary channels _ of sense,\nis greatly increased. Moreover, even after suitable experi-\nments have been thought out, it is not easy to carry\nthem through, since ordinary subjects cannot normally be\nasked to go to sleep for three or four days or to remain\nin a dark room for any considerable length of time.\nI was therefore unable to carry out experiments of this\nnature in respect of periods of time of veiy great length.\nI endeavoured, however, to discover if Mrs. L. had the\npower of '\ntrue '\ntime appreciation for short intervals of\ntime varying from five to sixty minutes. During these\nexperiments the subject was carefully kept away from\nclocks and watches, so that she had no means of gleaning\ninformation as to the passage of time from this source. ,\nCare was taken to ensure that the suggested acts were\nof a very simple nature, in order that the waking mind\n\fLxxxviii.] The Apjjreciation of Time by Somnambules 657\nshould feel no reluctance in executing them when the\nimjDulse was felt.

Experiment No. 21, was Mrs. L.\nabsolutely correct ; in all the others there were\nerrors ranging from one and a half to ten minutes;\nin the majority she Avas premature.\nIn most, if not all, of the tests Mrs. L. was,\nI think, unaware of the exact time from which\nthe estimates had to be made. It would there-\nfore have been no aid to accuracy of fulfilment\nto have attemjited to make calculations. More-\nover, although in the long-time experiments Mrs.\nL. admitted she made calculations, she assured me\nin hypnosis that she did not do so in the short-\ntime experiments. It would seem, therefore, that\nhere we have genuine instances of subconscious\ntime-watching and time-estimation.\nThinking that it might prove fruitful if a comparison\nof the above results with estimates of short intervals by\nthe waking mind could be made, I asked Mrs. L. to make\na series of observations on herself. She found, however,\nthat owing to the tendency of the waking mind to forget\nthese self-imposed tasks, such observations were far from\neasy to carry out for any but very short intervals. With\nno little difficulty she completed a series of 15 tests. In\nthese tests the mean error proved to be 4-2 compared\nwith a mean error of 3 6 made by the hypnotic con-\nsciousness. The latter thus showed a superiority of '1 in\nestimating short periods of time.\n\fLxxxvin.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnamhules 659\nMrs. L. did not show the same degree of accuracy in\nher subliminal time-estimates as some somnambules, as\nobserved by other investigators. For instance. Dr. Mitchell's\nsubject \u2022'\nF.D.,\" in her estimates of periods of time\nvarying from 1 to 15 minutes, committed a mean error\nof 1-009 minutes in thirty-one tests. In fifteen obser-\nvations on \" Mrs. C,\" with periods varying from two\nto ten minutes, the mean error was -78 minute. In\na series of sixty observations made by Dr. Mitchell\non various subjects, with periods varying from one minute\nto half an hour, the mean error was -89 minute.\nWhether the fact that my experiments tested estimates\nfor a longer period than half an hour, viz. up to one\nhour, is responsible for the greater mean error in Mrs. L.'s\ncase, I cannot say. I am unable to discern any principle\ngoverning her errors. In several instances the errors for\nperiods of from 50-57 minutes were less than for a period\nof 28 minutes. Thus, in No. 28, an eighteen-minute test,\nthere was an error of 7 minutes, whilst in No. 26, a\nfifty-seven minute test, the error was only three minutes.\nThe maximum error of ten minutes occurred in No. 25,\nwhere the period was sixty minutes.\nDr. Mtchell noted in his investigations that there was\nan apparent limitation of the amount of error, no matter\nwhat the suggested time interval might be. He found\nthat an error of one minute was just as likely to be\nmade when the suggestion was for fifteen minutes as\nwhen it was for three. In the great majority of his\nexperiments for the estimation of periods up to half an\nhour, the maximum error was not more than one or two\nminutes.\nI endeavoured to find out by qiiestioning Mrs. L. in\nhypnosis the method employed by her in fulfilHng these\nshort-time suggestions. .She informed me that she did\nnot make calculations, but that she knew when the right\ntime had come to perform the act from a '\nsense of\nrhythm.' I tried to obtain more accurate information\nabout this sense of rhythm, but I fear that what she\nsaid on these occasions was rather vague. On one\n-occasion in hypnosis, in response to my request that she\n\f660 Sydney E. Hooper, 31.A. [part\nshould write as accurately as possible a description of\nthis rhythmic sense, she wrote :\n\u2014\n\"Just as a delicate balance is made inaccurate by\ndisturbance, so the sense of rhythm is temporarily upset\nby agitation \" ; and again, on a subsequent occasion, she\nwrote :\n\u2014\n\" The sense of rhythm or balance is always active and\nconstantly being checked or measured against the clock\ntime. Suppose you speak of a minute. This has come\nto mean a definite measure of rhythm, though it is not\nmeasured in any exact terms.\"\nTowards the end of my experiments, I one day asked\nMrs. L. in deep hypnosis how she knew that a certain\n'\npiece of rhythm '\ncorresponded to a minute of clock\ntime. She replied :\n\" It just feels as if it were a minute.\"\nAsked if she counted at all, she replied : \"In a way I\ndo ;\none stays in my head until it seems to turn into\ntwo ;\ntwo until it turns into three, and so on.\" This\nfragment of information, furnished by my subject's\nhypnotic mind, is, I think, of value in shedding light on\nthe mental processes involved in achievements of the\nkind we are considering.\nConcluding Remarks.\nAt first sight the question as to how the hypnotic\nconsciousness is able to estimate, frequently with surpris-\ning precision, these various periods of time without\nassistance from any mechanical time-measurer, appears\nvery baffling. I do not, however, think it is necessary,\nin seeking for an explanation, to endow the hypnotic\nlevel of the mind with any transcendental power. Rather\nit would seem to be more promising to look for a clue\nin the mental processes of the normal waking mind when\nmaking similar estimates. Now, we have seen that it is\nalso possible for the waking mind to make estimates of\nthe passage of periods varying from five minutes to an\nhour, with more or less accuracy. True, there are often\nconsiderable errors, and oftener still the self-imposed tasks\nare quickly forgotten in consequence of other interests\ntaking hold of the mind. Nevertheless, as Mrs. L.'s\n\fLxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules . 661\nexperiments on herself show, estimates can sometimes be\nmade with very small errors. We are justified then, I\nthink, in assuming that in these estimates the same, or\na very similar mental process is operating on both levels\nof the mind. That is to say, there is no difference in\n'\nkind '\nbetween the mental process when estimates are\nbeing made by the hypnotic consciousness, and when\nthey are being made by the waking consciousness.\nWhat, then, is the method of the waking mind in\nestimating short periods of time ? If a subject is\nrequested to close his eyes and judge when five or ten\nminutes have passed, he may adopt the method of\nrhythmic counting. He knows more or less perfectly the\nrhythm of the ticking of a clock, and proceeds to count\nat a similar rate, and in this way succeeds in approxi-\nmating to accuracy. When counting is not consciously\nemployed, the subject judges on the basis of experience\nthat a certain slice of duration filled with a number of\nevents is equal to a period of clock time. It is admitted\nthat this latter procedure is liable to gross error, and it\nis unlikely that the accurate power of estimating time\ndisplayed by many somnambules is to be accounted for\nby any rough judgment of the latter kind.\nWhat, now, is the method employed by the hypnotic\nlevel of the mind in order correctly to carry out post-\nhypnotic suggestions 1 Although it is by no means\ncertain that aU somnambules employ the same method,\nwe discovered from our investigation into Miss E.'s\nachievements that she used the method of counting even\nfor periods as long as 44 1 and 38 hours. Mrs. L. also\nstated in hypnosis that she carried out these short-time\nexperiments from a '\nsense of rhythm '\n; that a minute\npossessed for her a '\ndefinite value,' and that, as she was\nwatching the passage of time, the minutes seemed each\nat a constant rate automatically to flow into its successor,\none merging into two, two into three, three into four,\nand so on.\nHere, then, at any rate, in regard to two somnambules,\nwe seem to have subliminal counting and sul^liminal\nequating of periods of duration with clock time, similar\n\f662 Sydney E. Hooper, M.A. [part\nto that attempted by the waking consciousness. If this\nanalysis be sound, then it would appear that in the\nestimates of short periods of time there is no essential\ndifference in the mental processes of the waking and hypnotic\nlevels of the mind.\nThere remains, however, the apparent fact of the\n'\nsuperiority '\ndisplayed by the hypnotic over the waking\nconsciousness. Although in the case of Mrs. L. this\nsuperiority is not very marked, in results published by\nother investigators the approximation to accuracy of\nestimation by the hypnotic consciousness is much more\nstriking. And if my own subject. Miss E., were able to\nperform the suggestions in many instances at the correct\ntime, solely by a process of rhythmic counting, there can,\nI think, be no doubt that her hypnotic consciousness\ndisplayed considerable superiority over her waking mind\nin this respect. It would appear then necessary to admit\nthis superiority. Can we suggest any explanation for it 1\nI submit that one important factor making for superiority\nis the capacity of the hypnotic consciousness to con-\ncentrate upon its task to the exclusion of all else. It\napparently watches the passage of time without cessation\nuntil the suggested act has been carried out. It is\nabsorbed in its work, refusing, with praiseworthy per-\nsistency, any temptation to diversion. The waking mind,\non the other hand, when making similar estimates, is\nunable normally to think continuously of its undertaking\nor to watch the flow of time with the same degree of\nattentive concentration. Thus, in place of the simple\nabsorption characteristic of the liypnotic consciousness,\nthe waking mind displays but fitfid interest and spas-\nmodic attention. The tranquil patience possessed by the\nhypnotic consciousness, together with its capacity for\nundivided attention, would appear to give it an advantage\nover the waking mind in its rhythmic counting. Whether,\nhowever, this is the sole explanation for its superiority,\nI am unable to say. There may be other contributory\nfactors.\nIt is conceivable, to refer again to Dr. Mitchell's specula-\ntion, that on the subliminal level of the mind some cor-\n\fLxxxviii.] The Appreciation of Time by Somna^nbules 663\nrelation exists between certain rhythmic organic processes\nand our conventional divisions of time, so that when-\nthe subconscious mind is shut off from contact with\nclocks and watches it still has at hand an objective time-\nmeasurer. Some such hypothesis would seem to be\nnecessary to explain the time accuracy exhibited by\ncertain somnambules in performing post-hypnotic acts\nunder these conditions.\nThere is, however, one other possibility. The pendular\nrhythm of the clock may be so perfectly inscribed on the\nsubconscious memory, and its faithful reproduction be so\neasy a matter, that the postulation of other factors is\nsuperfluous.\nOne concluding remark may not be altogether irrelevant.\nExperimental psychology has shown that in estimating very\nshort periods of time\u2014of a second or less\u2014there is a\ncertain period for whiclv the mean of a number of estimates\nis correct. It is suggested that this period\u2014called '\nin-\ndi.Tference-time '\u2014represents the time occupied in fixing\nattention.

S.P.R., Vol. LXXXIV., Mr. E. J. DingwaU has\ncriticised the author's experiments with the medium\nEva C. in terms which in several particulars are neither\nfair nor accurate. Since the publication of this report\n(June, 1922), Mr. Dingwall has become acquainted with\nthe present writer's manner of working and his experi-\nmental method by taking part in three sittings with the\nmedium Willy Sch. at his laboratory in Munich. Probably,\ntherefore, Mr. Dingwall might now view my conduct in\nanother light than he did before we were personally\nacquainted.\nMr. Dingwall asks what is the extent of my knowledge\nof methods of deception and hoAV far I am in a position\nto discover fraudulent manipulations before or after the\nsittings. To this I may reply that in my experiences\nwith physical mediums, which have extended over a\nperiod of more than thirty-five years, I have never yet\nmet with conjuring proper.\" In this respect conditions\nupon the continent are different from those in the Anglo-\nSaxon countries England and America, where, in con-\nsequence of the extraorchnarily widespread belief in\nspiritualism, mediumship has been c^uite shamelessly put\nto professional uses.\nMoreover, a fraudulent appearance in the phenomena\nis often extremely marked where we have to do with a\ngenuine mediumistic performance. I will mention here\nonly the imj)robable appearance of many teleplastic\nproductions observed at Madame Bisson's sittings with\nEva C, at my own, and at Dr. Geley's, and also at the\n^ Translated from the German.\n\f666 Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing. ' [part\nsittings of the English Committee. It needs but a Kttle\nin such cases to confound these rare, and in appearance\nfraudulent sports of Nature with the conjurer's sleight of\nhand, in spite of their supernormal origin. In particular,\nthe range of so-called \" mediumistic apports \" is marked\nby a particularly close analogy with the deceptions of the\n\" magician which depend upon speed and misdirection.\nTowards that particular branch of mediumistic phenomena,\nat all events, a very sceptical attitude is appropriate.\nThe psychological foundations of the conjurer's art are\nwell known both to myself and to the other continental\ninvestigators into the physical branch of parapsychie\nphenomena. I do not think that upon this point we\nhave anything new to learn from Mr. Dingwall.\nIt should be noted that famous conjurers such as\nBosko, Houdin, Hermann, Bellachini, Jakolis, Hamilton,\netc., have acquitted the mediums whom they have ob-\nserved of any suspicion of conjuring tricks, just as Mr.\nDingwall would now hardly venture to assert that the\nphenomena of Eva C. and Willy Sch. are founded upon\nconjuring. For nothing is easier than to deprive a\nmedium of the use of his limbs by observation and by\nholding the extremities. Subjects who are not able to\nendure such controlled experiments should be ignored by\nscientific enquirers. An accomplice or abettor, such as\na conjurer needs, can only be in question where the\npersons included in the circle are not reliable. But if\nthe circle consists solely of doctors or well-known men of\nscience, and if, moreover, the grouping of the circle is\nchanged between one sitting and another, this objection\nalso falls to the ground.\nAll things considered, the physical phenomena of medium-\nship cannot be counterfeited, if such experimental con-\nditions as will exclude fraud are rigorously maintained\nat the sittings.\nOn the other hand, I can corroborate Mr. Dingwall's\nstatement that when Eva C.\"s hands are given the necessary\nfreedom, she sometimes uses them to increase the tendency\nof the phenomena to deceive the observers' senses, because\nshe seizes the teleplasma in her hands, works upon it.\n\fLxxxviii.] Possibility of Deception with Eva C. 667\nand sets out her picture-like productions so that they\ncan be easily seen by the circle of onlookers. But this\narrangement for optical effect has nothing whatever to do\nwith the source of the psychoplastic objects. But I\nmust at this point emphasise the fact that during the\nlatter part of the period covered by my experiments,\n1913-1914, the possibility of the hands being brought into\nplay was ruled out by the conditions under which\nthese experiments took place.\nMr. Dingwall goes on to express his surprise that at\na sitting held with Eva C. during the period of experi-\nmenting at Munich (August, 1912), I did not myself\ndiscover some unquestionable pin-holes in the curtain, but\nthat these were observed by Dr. A. That there were,\nin fact, a few pinholes in the curtain just before this\nunjustifiably exaggerated discovery does not depend, as\nMr. Dingwall suggests, upon the author's \" assertion,'\" but\nupon the written testimony of the photographer who\ntook part in the arrangement of the apparatus (see\nKampf urn die Materialisazions-jjhdi^omene, p. 26). Before\njudging this matter readers shovild take into account the\nfollowing letter received from my photographer :\nDear Baron,\nIn reply to your enquiry I gladly inform you that\non one occasion certainly (when I had no assistance at\nhand) I fixed a piece of newspaper with a pin to the\ncurtain of the cabinet with a view to setting up the\ncameras correctly. It is probable that I may have fixed\na similar sheet with the same pin to the back wall of\nthe cabinet also, and to the stool, but my recollection is\nnot clear on this point owing to the long interval of\ntime.\nI remain.\nYours very truly,\nGeorg Haitberrisser, Dr.\n(Head of the Hauberrisser Photographic\n11\/11\/1914. Institute.)\nWe are therefore concerned in this case neither with an\n\" assertion \" on the part of the author, nor with the\n\f668 Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing. [part\ndiscovery of an entirely neAv fact by Dr. A., since the\nexistence of several pin-holes was already known to the\nexperimenters. As Mr. Dingwall saw when he took part\nin the Munich experiments, it is my habit to give my\nscientific guests a free hand in examining the laboratory,\nwith a view to the attainment of objective conclusions.\nMoreover, I was myself present when the pin-holes were\nfound. The examination of the cabinet which had been\nmoved from its position was carried out jointly by Dr.\nA. and myself. There was therefore no question of\nanything having been previously overlooked, and equally\nno reason for Dr. A. to claim the special merit of having\ndiscovered some omission on my part, or of having\nopened my eyes.\nUndoubtedly the existence of a row of pin-holes remains\na riddle, and so dees the English Committee's discover}^\nof fragments of paper at four separate sittings. But\nthese observations, pointing to a negative conclusion, do\nnot afford us any complete explanation ;\nthey do not, for\nexample, explain the passing of the teleplastic substance\nthrough the veil which was observed by the English\nCommittee, as well as by others. The value of our posi-\ntive observations cannot, therefore, be destroyed by a few\nmysterious occurrences of an apparently suspicious nature\nfor which up to the present we have no explanation.\nFor time and again the mysterious world of mediumship\nputs forward phenomena which come as a shock to our\naccustomed trains of thought. May we not find in this\nemployment of pins an instance of an apport, the more\nthat it has been demonstrated in the case of the medium\nFrau Silbert that the engraved marks upon articles of\njewelry have been produced by means of pins super-\nnormally introduced. Moreover, in the case of three\nmediums, between whom there was no connexion, the\nwriter has been able to observe the fixing up of tele-\nplastic products by means of pins which were probably\nintroduced in supernormal ways, and the observations\nwere to some extent corroborated by the camera. This\noccuiTence, therefore, in the case of Eva C. is not isolated,\nbut is typical of a certain phase of mediumship.\n\fLxxxviii.] Possibility of Deception with Eva C. 669\nEva C.'s stockinette costume and her clothing were\nregularly held up to the light of a hand-lamp before the\nsittings and especially searched for defective places. During\nthe many years covered by the period of experimentation\nonly once, at the sitting of the 29th May, 1912, were\nholes found in the stockinette, and these were noted in\nthe record.\nIn spite of the monotonous repetition year after year\nof the same process of examination, our attention never\nflagged ; for we were convinced of the value and necessity\nof examining the seance-costume. Had it not been for\nthis careful control, those minute paper particles could not\nhave been discovered on August 30th, 1912.\nRectal and vaginal examinations have repeatedly been\ncarried out, many of them during the later period by the\npresent writer himself.\nWith regard to the pieces of paper found in Paris and\nin London, we have no occasion to doubt that even\npaper-like substances can be materialised, as can sub-\nstances of the nature of gauze veiling and cotton, including\nthe morphological structure of the weft, folds sewn in,\netc.\nJust as traces have repeatedly been left of the pure,\norganic -teleplastic substance, so may similar fragments of\nthe materialised products, textile or cellular, have been\nleft behind.\nWe have far too little knowledge at the present time\nof the way in which these teleplastic creative processes\nwork, and we do not know that this materialising process\nis not capable of including m its scope all the objects of\nour sensory world, and tricking us with representations\nof them. In any case it appears inadmissible according\nto our present experience to found a suspicion of fraud\nupon the improbability in the appearance of these tele-\nplastic products and upon their material characteristics,\nmerely because these phenomena are inconsistent with our\npreconceived ideas. The habitual trend of our associative\nthought compels us, whenever a medium produces pheno-\nmena such as those described above, to think at once of\nsimilar appearances in the world of our experience. Clearly\n2u\n\f670 Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing. [paet\nthe creative efforts of this unknown psychic force, when\nit embodies itself for our senses, expresses itself in the\nshape of appearances known to us in the world of our\nexperience, in order to be generally intelligible to us.\nIf the working of an unknown law of nature consisted\nin presenting to our vision appearances at one time in\ntwo dimensions, at another plastic, at one time in the rough,\nat another finished in every detail, at one time with all\nthe characteristics of life, at another without them, we\nshould have to conform our ideas to these phenomena,\nhowever strange each of them might individually seem.\nSo long as we continue to be wholly ignorant of the\nprocess at work, as we are to-day, we have no right to\nrepudiate a phenomenon because, for example, its two-\ndimensional appearance is not consistent with the hypo-\nthesis upon which our presentation of the case rests, in\nother words, with our preconceived ideas.\nThe teleplastic reproduction of a portrait from the\n'\nMiroir '\nby a combination of ideoplastic force and\ncryptomnesia is not in itself more wonderful and also not\nmore suspicious than the appearance of the letters '\nMiro.'\nIn judging the suspicions expressed by Mr. Dingwall,\nsuspicions which it is not easy to dispel, the decisive\nfactor can only be the experimental conditions of control\nimposed at the sittings under consideration ; it can in\nno wise be the mere appearance of olijects seen. Now,\nthe experimental conditions were such as to be absolutely\nfree from any objection, and, moreover, the mysterious\nemergence of these objects and their sudden disappearance,\nleaving no trace, supports in this instance the hypothesis\nof materialisation .\nWhen in conclusion Mr. Dingwall asserts that at the\nsitting of August 11, 1911, it was by a photograph\ndeveloped after the sitting that the writer was first\nmade aware of Eva C'.'s manipulating of the phenomena\nwith her right hand, while in place of the real hand three\nlay a flat, glove-like form, in open imitation of the hand\nsupposedly under control, in this case the present writer's\nstatement has been misunderstood and wrongly quoted.\nThe exact wording of the passage is as follows {Material-\n\fLxxxviii.] Possibility of Deception with Eva C. 671\nisazions-phdnomene, p. 172, Eng. trans., p. lOS) :\n\" x\\fter\na photograph had been taken (Exposure No. 1 at this\nsitting) the sitting continued. Out of the elemental sub-\nstance which was changing its position, there was built up\nin her lap a third flat hand. At the same time I also\nobserved about thirty centimetres above her head another\nbetter formed hand. Since the phenomenon was repeated\nseveral times and again manifested itself over her head,\nI made another exposure (No. 2 flashlight photograph at\nthis sitting).\"\nMr. Dmgwall's incorrect citation, arising out of a\nmistake on his part, was given in the course of a corre-\nspondence otherwise private, but it must nevertheless be\npublished in this present connection, lest the reader\nshould deduce from an inaccurate reference a defect in\nthe writer's powers of observation. The flaws and im-\nperfections referred to by Mr. Dingwall in the experiments\nwith Eva C. have been discussed in detail in the present\nwriter's works, so that what Mr. Dingwall has put forward\ndoes not introduce any new objections. But it should\nnot be forgotten that against these isolated observations\nof a negative character we have to set an altogether com-\npelling mass of evidence drawn from hundreds of successful\nexperiments, so that these negative observations possess\nin reality but little force.\nAs to the question of the part played by regurgitation\nin the experiments with Eva C, an explanation which,\nso far as the English experiments are concerned, is dis-\nmissed by every member of the Committee, the second\nGerman edition of Materialisazions-phdnomene, now in print,\nenters into an exhaustive discussion of this matter, which\nonce and for all makes a clean sweep of this \" old wives'\ntale.\" The layman has no justification for his tendency\nto regard the stomach of mediums of this type as a\nkind of conjurer's property-bag, out of which he can at\nhis pleasure select any article he happens at the moment\nto require.\nMoreover, Mr. Dingwall himself admits that his only\nreason for going so thoroughly into the possibility of\nfraud in the experiments with Eva C, is in order to set\n\f672 Dr. Freiherr von Schrenck-Notzing. [part\nclearly before the reader's eyes the impossibility and\nabsurdity of this hypothesis.\nNow, as regards the technique of investigation, experi-\nence shows that better results are obtained if, in spite of\nthe most rigorous system of control in regard to observa-\ntion of the medium, one tries to establish good psycho-\nlogical relations with her, and at the same time to attain\na sympathetic understanding of her mentality, and if\nduring the actual sittings one does not concern oneself\neither in thought or in conversation with possibilities\" of\ndeception and methods of control.\nFor these phenomena have their origin in the life of\nthe unconscious mind and arise from an instinctive impulse\nin the medium, who for her part can yield herself up\ncompletely to this impulse only upon condition that her\nconscious attention is not brought into play by psycho-\nlogical resistances, or by doubt of her honesty on the\npart of the observers. The frequent ignoring of this most\nimportant consideration, especially in scientific investi-\ngations, is a cause of negative sittings even in the case\nof mediums who in other circumstances give good results.\nBelief in the actuality of parapsycho-physical phenomena\ngains new adherents in Germany every day. The remark-\nable occurrences observed with Eva C. have opened the\nway and are gaining an ever-increasing recognition as\na result of the observation of similar occurrences in\nexperiments with other subjects.\n\fLXXXVIIl] Review 673\nREVIEW.\nMedical Psychology and Psychical Research. By T. W.\nMitchell. (London : Methuen & Co. 1922. Pp. vii, 244.)\nIt was an excellent idea of Dr. Mitchell's to republish in\nbook form the remarkable studies on the problems of multiple\npersonality and hysteria which he has been contributing to the\nProceedings of our Society ever since 1907. For m. their new\nform they are much more likely to reach both the general\nand the medical pubhc which does not read our Proceedings,\nbut which it is vitally important to interest in our researches,\nand to which the moderation and caution of Dr. Mitchell's\nstatements is sure to appeal. It is also commendable that the\nsomewhat scanty English hterature on abnormal states of\npersonaUty should be enriched by a work worthy of being\nmentioned by the side of the great French and American\nclassics on the subject. Not that Dr. Mitchell has had the\ngood fortune to come across subjects of an excellence comparable\nwith that of '\nFeUda,' '\nLeonie,' '\nMiss Beauchamp,' the '\nRev.\nMr. Hanna,' or '\nDoris Fischer '\n; it is rather in the handling\nof his (less sensational) cases, and in the judiciousness of the\nconclusions drawn that he excels. As, moreover, it is precisely\nin elaborations of the ^theoretic conclusions that the new\nmaterial (found in chapters iv. and vi.) chiefly consists, it is\nto their consideration that this review will be chiefly devoted.\nDr. Mitchell throughout employs the sound method of\nexplaining the abnormal developments of mental Ufe by their\nanalogy with normal processes of which they may be regarded\nas the exaggerations. He therefore points out that the lapses\nof memory which are common in everyday life, the changes of\nmood which accompany changes in the bodj^ and its functional\nactivity, the aberrations of conduct to which most men are\nliable to in some degree, are the same in kind as those that\nare met with in more pronounced form in multiple personaUty\n(p. 103). He also deprecates \" the tendency of some modern\npsychologists lightly to give up belief in the unitary char-\n\f674 F. C. S. Schiller [part\nacter of man's being \" (p. 44), would rather \" speak of the\nhypnotic stratum of consciousness than of tlie hypnotic self\n\"\n(p. 45), and distinguishes between disruption of \" the unity of\nconsciousness and of the higher unity which is implied in the\nconception of personaUty \"\n(p. 147). By combining these\ncriteria, he is enabled to make the valuable suggestion that\nthe '\nJekyll-and-Hyde '\ntyjje of dissociation, in which there is\na marked moral difference between the two '\nselves,' is \"a\npathological development of a\/c^acr\/a,\" '\nincontinence,' as described\nby Aristotle (p. 159), and conversely, that \" in uKparria we. have\nan incipient doubling of personality \"\n(p. 155). Whenever\nincompatible interests come into conflict in an imperfectly\nintegrated moral character, there may be a yielding to '\ntemp-\ntation,' and this will be facilitated by a ])rocess of self-so-\n])histication or '\nrationalization,' which causes temporary amnesia\nrf considerations which would run counter to tlie desire, and\nforges reasons for indulging in it (p. 156-7). The reason why\nJekyll-and-Hyde dissociations are so rare is probably that,\nthanks to the '\nrationalization '\nof the desire, complete amnesia\ndoes not grow up, and \" a double life may be led without\ndiscovery \"\n(p. 158). Nevertheless there may be a sort of\n\" amnesia of the interests, purposes and ideals \" of the moral\nself (p. 106). This analysis of incontinence appears to me to\nbe well worthy of the attention of moralists, who, no doubt\nfrom ignorance of psychology, have not been very hapjoy in\ntheir dealings with the '\nmoral struggle.'\nMuch the same might be said of philosoiihers generally, as\nregards their treatment of the self and the body-soul relation.\nIn his final chajDter on Body and Soul in Multiple Personality\nDr. Mitchell treats the magniloquent obscurities in which they\nhave involved the subject with more respect than they prob-\nably deserve. But he is very explicit in exposing the vague-\nness which underlies physiological attempts to conceive the\nunity of consciousness (as also its '\ndissociation ') in merely\nneural terms. He rightly prefers to interpret the variations of\npersonality in terms of shiftings in the '\nthreshold '\nof consci-\nousness, and he holds that the soul as \"a psychical being\nbeneath or behind the phenomena of consciousness \" is by no\nmeans antiquated. As for its dissociations, \" one unitary soul\nmay persist behind all dissociations of consciousness, but it will\n\flxxxviii] Review 675\nbe unable to appear as a unity and its manifestations may ' be\nfragmentary and discordant. Its unity will be marked by\nthe imperfection of its instrument.\" (p. 236).\nHere I am tempted to, not to controvert Dr. Mitchell, but\nto dot a few i's and to cross a few i's, in order to reinforce\nhis conclusion. In the first place, it should be observed that\nno discussion of the relation of body and soul can claim\ncompleteness which neglects to consider what William James\nhas called the transmission theory, which is jirecisely the one\nfor which the body is the normal instrument, and often the\nhindrance, of the soul's manifestation, and Avhich is ca^Jable\nof interpreting all the facts usually held to point to the\n(materialistic) j^'^oduction theory. Secondly, it should be made\nquite clear that the soul must not be conceived as a thing-like\nentity, after the fashion of the old metaphysics. Conceived as\na thing, it was perfectly useless, as its critics perceived, and\nexplained nothing. It is not a '\nsubstratum '\nfor its qualities\nto '\ninhere '\nin, but an activity that reveals itself in its\nmanifestations. Thirdly, we should beware of assuming that\nthe problem to be accounted for in '\nmultijile personality \"\nis\nhow an original unity can be '\ndissociated,' and a soul can\nfall to pieces. As Dr. Mitchell acutely remarks (p. 214) \" in\norder to explain how consciousness can be split in two, we\nmust first be able to explain how it ever comes to be one.\"\nThe unity of a '\nsoul '\nmanifesting through a '\nbody '\nmust\nnecessarily be an achievement, not a datum. For the body is\nnot a unity, but an incredibly complex association of vast\nmultitudes of cells that has grown together under natural\nselection to meet the various requirements of organic life.\nNothing, therefore, is more probable than that its various\norgans and activities should not always function together in a\nperfectly harmonious way. And if they are, in addition, the\nmore or less recalcitrant instruments of a being that strives\nto manifest through them, it is not astonishing that its self-\nexpression should frequently fall short of unity and harmony.\nNor is it unreasonable, with such a theory of psychic structure,\nto keep one's eyes open, and to look for evidences, ahke in\nthe normal and in the abnormal functionings of the '\nsoul,'\nof supernormal processes transcending our present jDlane of\nevolution, F.
