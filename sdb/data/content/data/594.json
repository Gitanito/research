G. W. Balfour, in the chair.\nMr. W. M'Dougall read the paper on \" The Case of Sally\nBeauchamp,\" which was published in Part LII. of the Pro-\nceedings.\nThe 130th General Meeting was held in the same place, on\nThursday, May 16th, 1907, at 4.30 p.m.: the President in\nthe chair.\nDr. T. W. Mitchell read the paper on \" The Appreciation\nof Time by Somnambules,\" which is printed below.\na\n\f2 T. W. Mitchell, M.I). [part\nI.\nTHE APPRECIATION OF TIME BY SOMNAMBULES.\nBy T. W. Mitchell, M.D.,\nFellow of the Royal Society of Medicine.\nI.\nMany classifications of the different stages of hypnosis have\nbeen put forward, and it is difficult to find two authors who\nare in agreement as to how many stages may be recognised,\nor by what names they are to be known. All hypnotic subjects,\nhowever, may be divided into two great groups, according to\nwhether the events of hypnosis are forgotten or not in the\nwaking state ; and the term \" somnambule \" has been very\ngenerally used to describe those who, when hypnosis is termi-\nnated, are totally amnesic for all that has happened during\nthe trance.\nAlthough some interesting observations in regard to apprecia-\ntion of time may be made in the lighter stages of hypnosis,\nit is in somnambules that this power is most strikingly shown\nand may be most conveniently studied. All the observations\nrecorded or referred to in this paper were made on somnambules,\nand with regard to my own cases I can declare with the\ngreatest certainty that in every instance post-hypnotic amnesia\nwas complete.\nEvery one who has done much practical hypnotic work must\nhave observed the accuracy witli which somnambules estimate\ntime-intervals. If a somnambule is told in hypnosis to sleep\nfor five minutes, ten minutes, or half an hour, and then wake\nup, it is found that awakening takes place exactly at the\ntime mentioned, or that, if there is an error in the time-\nestimation, it is generally a very small one. It is also well\nknown that this power of estimating time-intervals may persist\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules.\ninto post-hypnotic life, so that an action suggested in hypnosis,\nto be performed in waking life after a certain interval, is\ngenerally fulfilled at the appointed time, notwithstanding that\nall knowledge of the suggestion is absent from the waking\nconsciousness during the intervening period.\nAlthough this association with the hypnotic state of what\nappears to be a supernormal power is well worthy of investiga-\ntion, we possess very few detailed records of observations which\nmight help us in elucidating the many difficulties which\nconfront us when we try to bring the facts into line with\nour ordinary psychological beliefs. In the early days of the\nstudy of hypnotic phenomena, so much that appeared marvellous\nand inexplicable was found that the appreciation of time by\nsomnambules must have seemed to be a very minor wonder.\nEven when the attention of the Nancy investigators was turned\ntowards the subject, they seemed to be more surprised by the\nlength of time which may elapse between the giving of a\nsuggestion and its fulfilment than by the extraordinary accuracy\nwith which time-intervals of less extent are estimated. One\nof Liegeois' subjects fulfilled a suggestion given in hypnosis\na year previously,1\nand Beaunis produced, in one of his\nsomnambules, a visual hallucination after an interval of\n172 days. 2\nIn both cases the date on which the suggestion\nwas to be fulfilled was given to the subject. Liegeois'\nsuggestion was given, on October 12th, as falling due on\n\" the same day next year,\" and the exact date was given by\nBeaunis in his su\u00ab\u00a3;estion.\nIt was soon realised that such cases, however interesting\nand remarkable they may be from another point of view, have\nvery little to do with any supposed power on the part of\nsomnambules of unconsciously reckoning duration. Both\nDelboeuf and Edmund Gurney insisted on the distinction\nthat must be made between cases in which a date is named\nand cases in which simply a length of time is given. For,\nin the former case, the fulfilment of the suggestion may be\ndependent on the ordinary laws of association, whilst in the\nlatter it would seem to imply, as Paul Janet said, some\n\" unknown faculty \" of measuring time. It is, of course, a\n1\nLiegeois, De la Suggestion, Paris, 18S9, p. 340.\n2\nBeaunis, Le Somnambulisme Provoqui, Paris, 1886, p. 233.\n\f4 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ncommonplace of hypnotic experimentation that a suggestion\nwill be fulfilled, either in hypnosis or in post-hypnosis, on\nthe giving of a pre-arranged signal. So, if a subject in\nhypnosis be told to do something on the first of January,\nthe arrival of that day may suffice to revive the dormant\nmemory of the command, and thus lead to its fulfilment.\nBut if he be told to perform an act on the \" sixty-ninth day\nfrom this,\" what is there about the sixty-ninth day to revive\nthe hypnotic command ? The day, when it comes, as Gurney\nsaid, \" carries no more sixty-ninthness about it than any other\nday \" ; and unless we are to suppose some form of conscious\nwatching and counting of the days as they pass, or some form\nof conscious calculation, whereby the terminal day is arrived\nat, and then fixed in the mind, the fulfilment of such a\ncommand seems inexplicable.\nAt the time when Beaunis and Liegeois recorded their\nobservations, the possibility of subconscious mentation had\nnot been distinctly formulated. The germs of the modern\ndoctrine of the subliminal consciousness may now be seen to\nhave been latent in the speculations of certain philosophers\nsuch as Fichte and Du Prel ; but the extravagant applications\nof the principle of the \" Unconscious \" by Eduard von Hart-\nmann, probably alienated the minds of scientific men from\nall consideration of a concept apparently so directly at variance\nwith their empirical beliefs. So we find that the earliest\nexplanations of the accurate fulfilment of post-hypnotic actions\nat a given time, or after a given interval, tended towards\nsome hypothesis of \" physiological \" time-reckoning rather\nthan towards the supposition that some form of consciousness\nwhich watches and counts the days as they pass may be\nconcerned. Thus Beaunis imagined that some cerebral\nmechanism exists in men and animals which can somehow\nbe set like a clock so as to produce a movement at a given\ntime. It is, he said, owing to this mechanism thc*t some\npeople are able to wake up at a predetermined hour, and\nthat an animal knows when it is feeding time.\nAlthough the last word in the controversy has not yet\nbeen said, I think there is no need at present to re-argue this\npoint of view. Notwithstanding the adherence of such eminent\nauthorities as Professor Miinsterberg and Professor Pdbot to\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 5\nthe view that all subconscious activity is merely physiological,\nit is now very widely admitted that the working of the cerebral\nmechanism concerned in the fulfilment of post-hypnotic acts\nhas a psychical concomitant, existing, it may be, submerged\nin the depths of the stream of consciousness, and not to be\ndiscovered on introspection during waking life, yet capable\nin many instances of being brought to the surface by certain\nartifices, such as re-hypnotisation, so that its existence and\nits persistence may be known by the subject, and may be\nmade apparent to the most casual or most sceptical observer.\nIt is, I think, no longer possible to doubt the reality of\nsubconscious mentation, or to evade the implications which\nthis admission entails.\nThis conception of a psychical reality accompanying sub-\nconscious cerebral activity will always be associated with the\nname of the late Mr. Frederic Myers. Of the great bulk of\nMr. Myers' work I do not desire, nor am I competent to\nspeak ; but as a student of Hypnotism I would like to\nrecord my belief that all future hypnotic experimentation\nmust be based on some form of the doctrine of the Subliminal\nConsciousness which we owe to him.\nAs a student of Medicine I am profoundly grateful for his\nilluminating conception of the nature of hysteria and various\ncognate states\u2014a conception which has transformed into one\nof the most fascinating and fertile fields of clinical study\nwhat was for centuries the opprobrium of medical science.\nIn discussing phenomena which have been observed only\nin hypnotic somnambules, we need not take into consideration\nthe different opinions which have been put forward in regard\nto the existence of a true subliminal self in all human beings ;\nnor need we define the terms subliminal and subconscious\nso carefully as may be necessary in the examination of those\nwider problems which have arisen around the modern con-\nception of human personality. Taking for granted the\npossibility, in somnambules, of mentation going on without\nthe knowledge or attention of the waking consciousness\u2014and\nevidence of this will be abundantly shown in the course of\nour investigation\u2014it will suffice for our purpose to class all\nsuch mentation as subconscious or subliminal. And in doing\nso we need not bind ourselves to any particular beliefs which,\n\fT. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\non other grounds, may be held in regard to the higher problems\nthat meet us at every step when we try to penetrate into\nthose hidden recesses of man's being to which his subconscious\nmental life may seem to be the gateway.\nThat post-hypnotic reckoning of time-intervals is not\nmerely physiological, but entails some concomitant mental\naction, was clearly shown by Gurney. 1\nOn March 3rd a\nsuggestion to be fulfilled in thirty-nine days was given to\none of his subjects during hypnosis. No reference to the\ncommand was made till March 19th, when he was suddenly\nasked, in the trance, how many days had elapsed since it\nwas n'iven. He instantly said 16, and added that there were\n23 more to run. It was evident \" that he was in some way\nactually counting the days as they passed.\" In another case\nan account of this process was obtained. The subject said\nthat he generally thought about it in the morning early.\nSomething seemed to say to him, \" You've got to count.\"\nOn being asked if that happened every day he replied :\n\" No,\nnot every day\u2014perhaps more like every other clay. It goes\nfrom my mind ; I never think of it during the day. I only\nknow it's got to be done.\"\nGurney concluded from these cases that a somnambule who is\ntold to perform a post-hypnotic act at the end of a certain\nnumber of days, subconsciously watches and counts the days\nas they pass. Notwithstanding that he himself had made many\nexperiments which proved that somnambules are able to make\nsubconscious calculations, Gurney did not think that in these\ncases of time-watching any calculation was made by which the\nterminal clay was arrived at, and then fixed in the mind.\nI have repeated Gurney's experiments on several somnambules,\nand I find that there is considerable variety in the methods used\nby them for ensuring the fulfilment of the act on the proper\nday. The method used by any particular subject seems to\ndepend on various circumstances. In the first place, it will\ndepend on his standard of education. If in the waking state\nhe is not good at mental arithmetic, or if mental arithmetic\nis distasteful to him, he will probably use the most elementary\nmethod of arriving at the correct day, namely, simply counting\n1\nGurney: \"Peculiarities of Certain Post-hypnotic States,\" Proceedings\nS.P.B.. Vol. IV., p. 290.\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 7\nthe days as they pass. But if he can do sums mentally without\ndifficulty he will generally make some calculation, either in\nhypnosis or subconsciously in post-hypnosis, so as to arrive\nat the terminal day, and then fix it in his mind. More\nimportant, however, than his arithmetical capacity, or his love\nfor figures in the waking state, is the extent to which his\nsubconscious mind has been trained by similar experiments.\nWhen such problems are given to a subject who has already\nmade use of subconscious calculation in the solving of more\ndifficult problems of a somewhat similar nature, he will\nunfailingly resort to the same method even when the accurate\nfulfilment of the suggestion could be ensured by simply count-\ning the days as they passed. The following examples will\nillustrate these points.\nI may state, with regard to all the experiments recorded\nin this paper, that I always took short notes at the time,\nin the. subject's presence\u2014in shorthand when anything more\nthan figures was necessary\u2014and these were invariably written\nout in full two or three hours afterwards. In nearly all\nthe experiments the time-intervals suggested were chosen at\nrandom. In the earlier ones I sometimes worked out the\ncalculations before making the suggestions, sometimes immediately\nafter doing so, and sometimes later in the day when writing-\nout my notes. In most of the later experiments I made\nno calculation until after the subject had fulfilled the suggestion,\nor had told me her solution of the problems. When the\nsuggestions were given in Nos. 21, 22, and 23 of the series\ntabulated on page 17, Miss A., a friend of the subject, was\npresent. In no other instance in that series did any third\nperson know anything about the suggestions. Only very\nexceptionally in the other experiments was there any one\npresent when the suggestions were given except the subject\nand myself. All the subjects were good somnambules before\nthe experiments were begun, and there was not at any time the\nslightest doubt as to the completeness of post-hypnotic amnesia.\nIn conducting experiments with hypnotised subjects, certain\nprecautions are necessary. Some of these are very obvious to\nany one having knowledge of the peculiarities of hypnotic and\npost-hypnotic states. Others are less obvious, and considerable\ningenuity is sometimes necessary to avoid falling into error.\n\f8 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nThe more obvious precautions are those which must be\ntaken to ensure that the subject does not obtain through\nordinary sensory channels any information which the experi-\nmenter wishes him not to have. The subject must always be\nlooked upon as being wide awake, or rather as being in a\nstate in which sensory impressions of all kinds are more\nreadily perceived than they are in the waking state. The\nfact that his eyes are closed, or apparently closed, must never\nbe taken as a proof that he cannot see what is going on.\nA possible hyperesthesia of all the senses must be allowed\nfor ; and it is much better to overdo the precautions taken\nthan to be careless on any point, however unimportant it may\nat first sight appear to be.\nFrom the beginning of the experiments which I am about\nto record I made it a rule never to write down in the\nsubject's presence anything which she could possibly see by\nany normal means. In making calculations in the presence\nof the subject, I either went behind her or interposed some\nopaque body between her face and the paper on which I was\nwriting. I also used a very soft sharp-pointed pencil, and\nmade the figures very small so as to avoid giving any informa-\ntion through the sense of hearing. Such precautions may\nprobably be quite unnecessary ; but some of the recorded\nevidence relating to sensory hyperaesthesia during hypnosis is\nso extraordinary that we have no right to imperil the exactness\nof our results by failing to allow for every possible source of\nerror.\nThroughout the series of observations which I am about\nto record I lay great stress on the importance of the informa-\ntion given by the subject, during hypnosis, in response to\nquestions regarding her mental states and processes at various\ntimes. The framing of the questions put to the subject is\nto my mind the most important and the most difficult feature\nin connection with experiments of this description. The diffi-\nculty of putting a question in such a way that no inkling\nis given of the answer you desire or expect is sometimes\nalmost insuperable ; and the way in which the response of the\nsubject may be modified by the merest change of intonation\non the part of the operator can be appreciated only by those\nwho have had some experience in this form of investigation.\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 9\nHow to obtain the truth from a person whose every pulse\nof thought is to some extent at the mercy of the faintest\nsuggestion of the operator is a problem which demands the\ngreatest care and ingenuity. When every precaution is taken,\nand when there is no doubt as to the honesty of the hypnotised\nsubject, the danger of falsification of the subject's memory by\nunconscious suggestions is the chief source of error which the\ninvestigator has to guard against when trying to obtain a trust-\nworthy account of the mental processes which go on at the\nhypnotic level of consciousness. This is the main reason why it\nis advisable, whenever possible, to have a verbatim report of all\nquestions which are put to the hypnotised subject ; for unless\nthe questions are carefully prepared beforehand it will often\nbe found that information which may have had some influence\nin moulding the answer obtained has been conveyed by the\nwording of the question. In my own experiments I preferred\npreparing the questions beforehand. When this was not possible\nI took them down in shorthand at the time.\nOne of my subjects, Mrs. C, is a fairly well educated\nwoman, but she greatly dislikes mental arithmetic, and indeed,\nfigures generally. In the waking state, the simplest of sums\nin mental addition or multiplication distress her exceedingly.\nShe is a good somnambule, can be hypnotised and awakened\ninstantaneously, and post-hypnotic amnesia is complete. Yet\nwhen given any sum to be worked out subconsciously in post-\nhypnosis, there always seems to be some subliminal invasion\nof the waking consciousness which leads to supraliminal know-\nledge that she is \" doing figures in her head,\" although she\nnever knows what they mean.\nOn March 5th, 1907, I asked her, in hypnosis, to make\na cross on a piece of paper, on \" the 39th day from this.\"\nThe matter was not referred to again until March 21st. On\nbeing asked in the waking state if she had been doing any\nsums, she said that she thought she had, but that they seemed\nto be \" very little ones.\" She had had the feeling that she had\nbeen \" adding on one every day,\" but she did not know how\nfar she had got, or to what end she was counting. I said\nto her \" Sleep ! How many days are gone ?\n\" She answered\nimmediately, \" 16.\" She did not know how many days were\nto come, nor when the act fell due. She remembered the\n\f10 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nsuggestion, but not the date on which it had been given. Her\nsole knowledge of the matter seemed to be that she had to\nmake a cross on the 39 th day, and that 16 days had elapsed\nsince the suggestion was given.\nAnother subject, Mrs. T., was told, during hypnosis, in the\npresence of her husband, on Sunday, January 13th, 1907, to\nmake a cross on a piece of paper on \" the 43rd day from\nthis.\" (Due Feb. 2 5.) I did not see her again until March 1st.\nI then found that the cross had been made some time before\nit was due. She had not dated the paper, and she could\nnot remember when the cross was made. In hypnosis she\nsaid it was made on February 17th. She knew quite well\nwhen the cross ought to have been made, but she was hurried\nby her husband asking her on the 17th if she had not some-\nthing to do for me, and whether she had forgotten it or\nnot. She was then afraid she had made a mistake, and made\nthe cross that day, fearing she might be too late. On being\nasked if she had made any calculation, or if she had been\ncounting the days, she said she had made a calculation, and had\ncounted the Sundays. She knew that the cross had to be\nmade on the day after the sixth Sunday.\nThis subject is a highly intelligent and well-educated woman,\nand it is interesting to note how she simplified the calculation\nfor determining the day (7x6 + 1 = 43), and also how she\nsimplified the process of watching and counting the days. This\nwas the first time she had been experimented on ; and although\nit is quite exceptional for questions during the waking state to\ndisturb operations of the subconscious mind which have been\nset going by suggestion during hypnosis, it is probable that if\nher husband had not mentioned the matter to her at all she\nmight have fulfilled the hypnotic command at the proper\ntime.\nOn March 1st, 1907, I asked her, in hypnosis, to make a\ncross on \" the 145th day from this.\" Immediately after giving\nthe suggestion I asked her when it fell due. She replied,\nafter about 30 seconds, that it fell due on July 24th.\n(Right.) Questioned as to how she knew, she said she had\njust added up the days of the months, allowing 30 days for\nMarch, and 24 clays in July (30 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 24 = 145).\nShe said she would always make a calculation when such a\n\fLi v.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambwles. 11\nsuggestion was made to her. She would not think of trying\nto count every day as it came.\nSimilar experiments made on another somnambule show still\nmore clearly the use of calculations in connection with such\nsuggestions. Miss F. D. was a good somnambule, and could\nbe hypnotised or awakened instantaneously by uttering the\ncommands, \" Sleep !\n\" and \" Wake up.\" She had previously\nbeen subjected to a long series of experiments involving sub-\nconscious calculations, which are recorded in a later part of\nthis paper. On December 6th, 1906, I told her during\nhypnosis to make a cross on a piece of paper on \"the 39th\nday from this,\" and to put underneath it the date of doing\nso (due Jan. 14th, 1907). On December 8th I asked her\nin the waking state if she knew what I had told her to do.\nShe of course knew nothing. I said to her suddenly, \" Sleep !\nWhen is it due?\" She replied immediately, \"January 14th.\"\nOn being questioned as to how she knew, she said that it\ncame into her head on the night of December 6th, during\nnatural sleep. She had no recollection of having made any\n\u2022calculation.\nOn January 3rd I hypnotised her and asked, \" How many\n\u2022days are gone?\" She replied immediately, \"28\" (right).\n\"How many to come?\" \"12\" (wrong). \"Wake up.\" After\nshe awoke I found that 12 was wrong, so I hypnotised her\nand asked her if she thought her answers were right. She\nsaid at once that 1 2 was wrong, and that there were only\n11 days to come. She did not know how she had made\nthe mistake. She could not say how she knew the right\n\u2022answers, but she believed that she noted the days in\nher sleep at night. The cross was duly made on January\n14th.\nOn January 3rd, 1907, I made a similar suggestion to be\nfulfilled on \"the 145th day from this.\" On January 1 6th I\nasked her in hypnosis if she remembered what I told her on\nJanuary 3rd. She said she did. \" How many days are gone ?\n\"\n\" 13.\" \"How many to come?\" \" 132.\" \"When does it fall\n\u2022due?\" \"May 28th.\" All the answers are correct, and were\ngiven without any hesitation. On being asked the same ques-\ntions on January 29th, she said that 26 days had passed,\nand 119 still to come (right). On February 16th, when doing\n\f12 T. W. Mitchell, 31. D. [part\nsome experiments involving automatic writing, I asked her,\nduring hypnosis, to write down anything she liked after waking.\nWhen she awoke she wrote down 101 \u2014 44. The subject in\nthe waking state did not know what this meant, and as no'\nreference to the suggestion of January 3rd had been made\nsince January 29th, I had quite forgotten about it, and did\nnot associate the figures with that experiment. On being\nhypnotised she told me that they were meant to indicate that\nthere were 101 days to come and 44 gone (right). On\nMarch 2nd she wrote automatically under similar circum-\nstances. 58 \u2014 87 (58 gone, 87 to come\u2014right).\nIn this case there is clear evidence that a calculation had\nbeen made by which the terminal day was arrived at ; but\nit is curious to note that there was apparently also a con-\ntinuous watching and counting of the days as they passed,,\nwhich would seem to be quite unnecessary. This, I think,\nwas due to the subject's long training in experiments of this\ndescription, and to her knowledge that I was in the habit\nof questioning her about the details of her methods. It is of\ncourse possible that there was really no counting of the days.\nIf she knew on each occasion what the date was, she might\nhave calculated, every time, the number of days gone and to\ncome. But the rapidity with which the replies were given\nleads me to think that the knowledge must have been in\nher possession before the questions were asked. It may, how-\never, be suggested that she was subliminally on the look-out\nfor my question, and that she made the calculation sublimin-\nally before being hypnotised. But if there was the continuous\nsubliminal expectancy which such a suggestion implies, it would\nsurely have been much easier for her to count the days as they\npassed than to make a subliminal calculation every time I\ncalled to see her.\nWhen the terminal day is arrived at beforehand by calcu-\nlation, and no continuous counting of the days as they pass\ntakes place, the act is fulfilled on the proper day just as it\nis when a date is mentioned in giving the suggestion. In\nsuch cases Gurney's method of naming an interval of time\ninstead of a fixed date does not ensure a continuous time-\nwatching or demonstrate any true appreciation of the passage\nof time by somnambules.\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 13\nWhen Delboeuf 1\nrecognised the importance of not mention-\ning any fixed date for the fulfilment of the post-hypnotic act,\nhe thought that this difficulty could be overcome by giving\nthe suggestion in minutes instead of in hours or in days.\nHe devised this method, he says, partly to do away with the\nfixing of the terminal time in giving the suggestions, and\npartly in order to make it possible to carry out a number of\nobservations in a relatively short time. Here is an example\nof Delboeufs experiments. At 6.55 a.m. he suggested to his\nsubject M. that at the expiration of 1500 minutes she was\nto ask Madame Delboeuf if she required anything. This\nsuggestion was carried out with absolute accuracy. Delboeuf\nmade twelve experiments of this kind, the time-intervals sug-\ngested varying from 350 to 3300 minutes. Two of these\nwere fulfilled at the moment they fell due. In three the\nimpulse to fulfil the suggested act arose at the right time.\nIn none of the others was the estimation of the time\naccurate.\nDelboeufs subjects were his two maid-servants, J. and M.,\nwho were ignorant country girls. Only with difficulty could\nthey tell the time by the clock, and in the waking state\nthey were quite incapable of reducing to hours such a number\nof minutes as 1150. M. was a somewhat better arithmetician\nthan J., and it is important to note that in the experiments\nshe was more accurate in her time-estimation than J.\nInspired by Delboeufs results, Dr. Milne Bramwell took\nup the subject of time-appreciation by somnambules, and he\nhas published a remarkable series of observations which are\ndeserving of the closest study.'\n2\nEecognising that some of\nDelboeufs failures were due to the subject's resistance to dis-\ntasteful suggestions, Dr. Bramwell confined the suggested act\nin all his experiments to the making of a cross on a piece\nof paper at the end of a certain number of minutes. His\nsubject, Miss D., was \" an intelligent girl who had received an\nordinary Board School education, and her arithmetical powers\nwere in keeping with this ; she could do ordinary sums in\nmultiplication and subtraction with the aid of a pencil and\n1\nDelboeuf, \" De l'appreciation du Temps par les Somnambules,\" Proceedings\nS.P.E., Vol. VIII., p. 414.\n2\nBramwell, Hypnotism (London, 1903), p. 119.\n\f14 T. W. Mitchell, MR [part\npaper, but failed, unless they were extremely simple, to solve\nthem mentally.\"\n1\nThe experiments were conducted as follows.\nDuring hypnosis Miss D. was told that at the expiration of\na certain number of minutes she was to make a cross and\nwrite down the hour she believed it to be without consulting\nthe clock, an interval of waking life always intervening between\nthe suggestion and its fulfilment. At first the arithmetical\nproblems involved in the experiments were relatively simple,\nbut later they were exceedingly complicated, and further, as\nmany as five or six different suggestions were given rapidly,\none after the other, in the same hypnosis. These suggestions\nwere fulfilled with remarkable accuracy\u2014some in ordinary\nwaking life, some in subsequent hypnosis, and some during\nnatural sleep. The following examples will give some idea of\nthe nature of these experiments.\nOn Tuesday, Dec. 24th, 1895, at 3.10 p.m., Miss D. was\ntold, during hypnosis, that she was to make a cross on\na piece of paper in 7200 minutes (Exp. No. 7).\n2\nThis fell\ndue to be fulfilled on Sunday, Dec. 29th. \"When it was\nfulfilled Miss D. was teaching a Sunday School class, when\nshe suddenly felt an impulse to make a cross and mark the\ntime. It was only after doing so that she looked at the\nclock, which was behind her. Her estimation of the time was\ncorrect.\"\nOn Jan. 8th, at 4.30 p.m., a similar suggestion was given,\nto be fulfilled in 10,070 minutes (Exp. No. 12).\n3\nThis\nsuggestion fell due on Jan. loth, at 4.20 p.m. When it was\nfulfilled Miss D. had been hypnotised in Dr. Bramwell's\nroom for an hour, and had had no opportunity of consulting\nthe clock. Exactly at 4.20, without waking or opening her\neyes, she said she had to make a cross and put down the\ntime.\nOn Wednesday, Feb. 5th, five suggestions were given rapidly,\none after the other. Among these were No. 22- -in 840\nminutes (due 6 a.m. Feb. 6th), and No. 23\u2014in 900 minutes\n(due 7 a.m. Feb. 6th).\n4\n\" When Miss D.'s mother went to\nher bedroom on the morning of the 6th, she found her asleep\nand two pieces of paper on a table by her bedside.

Misri D. said: She' had not awakened during\nthe night.\" ' -\nIn summarising his experiments, Dr. Bramwell says :\n1\n\" Fifty- rive experiments are cited; of these one, apparently,\nwas either not carried out by Miss D., or unrecorded by me,\nwhile in another (No. 9), she mistook the original suggestion,\nbut fulfilled it correctly in accordance with what she thought\nit had been. Forty-five were completely successful, i.e. not\nonly did Miss D. write down the correct terminal time, but\nthis was done, also, at the moment the experiment fell due.\nEight . . . were partially successful. In these the terminal\ntime was correctly recorded in every instance, but there were\nminute differences, never exceeding five minutes, between the\nsubject's correct estimate of when the suggestion fell due and\nthe moment at which she carried it out. The proportion\nwhich these errors bear to their respective intervals varies\nbetween 1 to 2028 and 1 to 21,420.\"\nI have made a series of observations which corroborate in\nmany ways the results obtained by Dr. Bramwell ;\nyet there\nare certain points of difference which are not uninteresting.\nMy subject, F. D., was a delicate girl whom 1 had relieved\nof some functional troubles by hypnotic suggestion. She was\nthirty years of age, and lived at home with her parents,\nhelping in the work of the house. She had received an\nelementary education at a National School, but, as will be\nseen from her methods of calculation in the waking state, she\nwas evidently not as good an arithmetician as Dr. Bramwell's\nsubject. She was a good somnambule, and could be hypnotised\nor awakened instantaneously simply by uttering the commands,\n\" Sleep !\n\" or \" Wake up !\n\" All the experiments were con-\nducted on the lines laid down by Dr. Bramwell ; but\noccasionally certain modifications were introduced which will\nbe detailed in due course. Where nothing to the contrary is\nmentioned, the subject was requested, during hypnosis, to make\na cross on a piece of paper at the end of a given number\nof minutes, to put down the time she thought it was when\ndoing so without consulting a clock or watch, to put whether\na.m. or p.m., and to add the day of the month. Where no\nstatement to the contrary is made, the subject was told what\n'Bramwell, Hypnotism, p. 132.\n\f16 :T. W. M^didi, M:i).

My first experi-\nment was made with the intention of finding out what her\npowers of subconscious calculation were at this time. On\nMarch 30th, 1906, at 11.15 a.m., I asked her to make a\ncross in 86,400 seconds. Next day she gave me a paper\nmarked \"11.30 p.m., March 30th.\" This was wrong; it\nshould have been 11.15 a.m., March 31st. I then began the\nfollowing series of experiments.\nNo. 1.

On being asked\nwhen this was written she said, \" last night after I had gone\nto bed. I had been asleep and woke up to do it. I remember\nfeeling very tired and went to sleep at once after writing it,\nand slept all night.\"\nNo. 2.

When she did look it was six\no'clock. She woke up to make the cross and did not go to\nsleep again.\nNo. 3.

She was then awakened and given a book to read\naloud. A pencil and paper were placed on the table close\nto her right hand. After reading a few lines she took up\nthe pencil and began to write while continuing her reading.\nShe made a cross, wrote 2885, and then stopped both\nreading and writing, put the pencil down, saying, \" I can't do\ntwo things at once.\" I told her to go on reading and not\nto mind anything else. She did so, and while reading she\nagain took up the pencil and wrote April 9. I stopped the\nreading and said, \" You have not written clown when it falls\ndue.\" She immediately wrote \" 5 to 4.\" I re-hypnotised her\nand told her I thought 5 to 4 was not quite right. She\nsaid at once \" Yes 5 to 4 is wrong, it is 5 past 4.\" On\nbeing asked if she had made any calculation she said, \" No,\nhow could I ? I have not had time.\" \" How then do you\nknow ?\n\" \"I don't know how I know.\" \" But you are sure\n5 past 4 is right?\" \"Yes.\"\nOn April 12 th she gave me a paper marked \" 5 past\n4 p.m. Apr. 11.\" She knew nothing about this in the\nwaking state except that she had written it. In hypnosis\nshe knew that she had written it in response to my suggestion\nof April 9th.\nAn attempt was now made to find out if more difficult\nproblems required a longer time for the subconscious calculation\nto be made correctly. The plan adopted was to explain in\nhypnosis that a problem requiring an answer would be put\nand that she was to write down the answer as soon as she\nawoke. The problem was then given and the subject\nimmediately awakened.\nNo. 4. On April 12th, 1906, I said to the subject in\nhypnosis\n:\n\"If, counting from to-day, Thursday, at 12 o'clock, you\nmake a cross in 3090 minutes, when will it fall due ?\nWake up\n!\n\" She awoke and almost immediately went over\nto the table and wrote: \"11.20 p.m., April 15th.\" This\nis wrong. It should have been 3.30 p.m., April 14th. I\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 19\nhypnotised her and asked what my question was. She\nrepeated it, giving 3900 minutes instead of 3090. Still her\nanswer would have been wrong. I told her to try again\nwith 3090 minutes and to tell me the answer immediately\non waking up. I awoke her and she said at once: \"1.30,\nApril 14th.\" Another trial was made and she was told to\ntake time if necessary. On awaking she said after a few\nminutes: \"6.30, April 14th.\" This being wrong, and as\nshe seemed to be getting confused, I re-hypnotised her and\ntold her to tell me the answer the next time I saw her, if\nshe could not do so before T left. I then awoke her and\ntalked to her for about five minutes before going away.\nNext day as soon as I saw her she told me that just as I\nwas leaving on the previous day she felt inclined to say to\nme: \"3.30, April 14th\"; but she did not know what it\nmeant and thought it sounded silly, so did not say anything.\nNo. 5. On April 13th, 1906, I asked her in hypnosis to\ntell me as soon as she could after waking, how many days,\nhours, etc. are in 7410 minutes. Awakened immediately\nshe replied after a few minutes: \"5 days, 160 hours.\"\nTold to try again she said: \"5 days, 140 hours\" In\nhypnosis she told me these answers were wrong, but she\ncould not tell me the correct one. As I could not wait\nlonger I told her to write down the answer as soon as she\ncould, noting on the paper the time at which she did so.\nI left her at 12 30 p.m.\nWhen I saw her on April 15th she gave me a paper\nmarked: \"5 days, 123J hours, 12.40 p.m., April 13th.\"\nShe said she had got up to write this in the middle of her\ndinner soon after I left on April 13th. She had sat down\nto dinner immediately after I had gone away, and was\ntalking and laughing with her people all the time until she\nsuddenly felt that she must get up and write this. When\nshe had written it she did not know what it meant.\nI could not understand the answer at first, as 5 days plus\n123^ hours is so obviously wrong. But 123 J hours =7410\nminutes. In hypnosis she told me that she understood me\nto want the number of days and the number of hours. Her\nprevious attempts had been in this direction.\n\f20 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nNo. 6. April 15, 1906, 12 noon\u2014in 17,505 minutes (due\nApril 27, 3.45 p.m.).\nNext day I asked her in hypnosis if she remembered the\nsuggestion given on April 15th. She repeated it correctly.\nAsked when it fell due she replied at once: \"3.45 p.m.,\nApril 27th.\" In response to questioning she said she thought\nshe had arrived at this conclusion in the night. She was\nnot conscious of having made any calculation. All she knew\nwas that she remembered \" thinking about the question and\nthe answer \" in the night. In the waking state she knew\nnothing at all about the matter.\nOn April 24th, after the fulfilment of the next experiment,\nshe was asked in hypnosis if she had any other crosses to\nmake during the coming week. She said she did not think\nso\u2014she could not remember any. The fact that she had\ntold me that the suggestion of April 15th fell due on\nApril 27 th seemed to have faded for the time being from\nher memory. Nevertheless, on April 27th the suggestion\nwas fulfilled in my presence. At 3.40 p.m., while awake\nand talking to me, she suddenly became restless, and I asked\nher what was the matter. She said she felt she had to\nwrite down something. I said, \" Come along and do it, then.\"\nShe immediately came to the table, made a cross on a piece\nof paper and wrote: \"3.45 p.m., April 27th.\" It was then\njust past 3.40. The suggestion was fulfilled, therefore, about\nfive minutes too soon. I think, however, that this error was\nprobably due to my telling her to \" come and do it \" as\nsoon as she explained to me the reason for her restlessness.\nFor I have frequently observed that a cross made in my\npresence is preceded for some minutes by a certain amount\nof restlessness, and that if she is not interfered with in any\nway the suggested act will be performed usually at the\nexact time at which it falls due.\nNo. 7.

At 3.55, while in hypnosis, she became\nrather restless and sighed frequently. On being asked why\nshe sighed she said she did not know, but that she seemed\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 21\nto have something on her mind. \" Do you know what it\nis ?\n\" I enquired. \" No ! I think I have to do something.\"\nBeing desirous to see if a similar restlessness would appear\nin the waking; state I awoke her. She talked to me without\nany seeming preoccupation, and I held her attention constantly\nby questioning her on matters of interest to her. While\ncontinuing the conversation she began searching in her pocket\nand brought out a pencil. I paid no attention to what she\nwas doing and kept her engaged in conversation. Suddenly\nshe said :\n\" Excuse me a minute, I must go and get a piece\nof paper.\" \" What do you want a piece of paper for ?\n\"\n\" I've got to write something.\" \" Do you know what it is ?\n\"\n\" No.\" She was by this time at the door of the room. I\ntold her that I could give her a piece of paper, so she came\nback to the table and prepared to write. \" Do you know\nwhat you have to write now ?\n\" \" Yes.\" She immediately\nmade a cross and wrote :\n\" 4 p.m., April 24th.\" It was then\nexactly 4 o'clock. In the waking state she knew nothing\nabout what she had written except that she had written it.\nIn hypnosis she knew what she had written and what it\nmeant. She did not remember having thought of the matter\nat all, since I made the suggestion, unless she did so in\nher sleep on the first night. She was not aware of having\nmade any calculation, and she did not know how she knew\nwhen to make the cross.\nNo. 8. Wednesday, April 25, 1906, 4 p.m.\u2014in 2880\nminutes (due 4 p.m., April 27).\nAfter giving the suggestion I asked her when it fell due.\nShe replied immediately, \" 4 o'clock on Thursday\u2014no, Friday\n\u20144 o'clock on Friday.\" (April 27.) She said she did not\nmake any calculation\u2014\" it just came into my head.\" This\nsuggestion was fulfilled, in hypnosis, on April 27, at 4 p.m.,\nin my presence.\nNo. 9. April 26, 11 a.m. \u2014in 1710 minutes (due April 27,\n3.30 p.m.).\nImmediately after giving the suggestion, and before hypnosis\nterminated, I asked her when it fell due. She could not\ngive the answer at once, but after a few minutes, during\nwhich I talked to her about her health, I again asked when\n\f22 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nit fell due, and she replied, \" 3.30 to-morrow.\" (Right.) She\nsaid she had not been thinking about it or trying to calcu-\nlate while I was talking to her ; she was attending to what\nI was saying.

(It is 28 days, 40 minutes.) She could not\ngive me any more definite answer.\nOn May 1st I told her in hypnosis that in the future I\nshould refer to her in the waking state as Miss I) g,\nand in the hypnotic state as Florence. This was done in\norder to make her understand more easily my direc-\ntions in regard to some experiments in automatic\nwriting. Thus I said, \" When you wake up I shall\ngive Miss D g a book to read and she will confine her\nattention to what she is reading, while you, Florence, will\nwrite down answers to questions which I shall put to you.\"\nI awoke her and gave her a book to read aloud. I put a\npencil in her right hand and told her not to pay any atten-\ntion to what her right hand might do, but to go on reading.\nWhile she was reading I said in a low voice, close to her\near, \" What is your name ?\n\" Very slowly her hand wrote\n\" Florence.\" \" What did I tell you on Sunday\u2014something\nyou had to do?\" She wrote \" 40630 \" and something inde-\ncipherable. \" When does it fall due ?\n\" She wrote \" May\n27.\" \"What time?\" She wrote \"4.30.\" \"What day is\nthat ?\n\" \" Sunday.\" All this was done with considerable\neffort ; when the hand wrote the reading was hesitating. The\nwriting was done very slowly and badly.\nThe figures written down being wrong, and the terminal\ntime also being wrong, I hypnotised her and asked her for\nan explanation. She said she was not sure whether I had\nsaid 40,630 or 40,360. She had thought about it in her\nsleep on Sunday night and could not decide which it was.\nIf it was 40,360 it would fall due, she said, at 12 o'clock\non the same day. Her answers are correct. I told her\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 23\nthat my suggestion was 40,360 minutes, and that she must\nmake a cross at the end of that time. I told her also to\nmake a cross at the end of 40,630 minutes, so I number\nthis suggestion as a separate experiment.\nNo. 11.

On June 5th I questioned her\nduring hypnosis on the matter, and she said she thought 3.10\nwas correct. She did not remember having told me the\ncorrect answer on May 1st. She said she thought she must\nhave got confused, as she had made so many crosses. She\nnow saw that 3.10 is wrong, and that the difference between\n40,360 minutes and 40,630 minutes is hours ; so that\nif 12 noon is right for one the other must be 4.30 p.m.\nNo. 12.

It was then 3.12 a.m.\nOn May 13th she gave me a paper marked \" 3.10 p.m.,\nMay 13.\" This was the fulfilment of No. 13.\nI had by some error put 3.30 p.m. in my note-book as the\nterminal time for this experiment. Twice in the preceding\nweek I had asked the subject in hypnosis when this cross\nfell due, and each time she answered, \" 3.10 p.m., May 13th.\"\nI thought this wrong but said nothing. Now that she had\nmade the cross at 3.10 I tried to find out how she had made\nthe calculation, and how the mistake, as I thought it, had arisen.\nIn hypnosis she maintained that she knew nothing of how she\nhad arrived at the terminal time. I then asked her to open\nher eyes without waking up and to do the calculation on\npaper. \"If,\" I said, \"you make a cross in 14,350 minutes\nafter 4 p.m. on May loth, when will it fall due?\" She\ntook a pencil and wrote down 1440. This she multiplied\nby 10, and from the sum so obtained she subtracted 14,350.\nShe then said it would fall due on May 25th at 50 minutes\nbefore 4 p.m., or at 3.10 p.m. I questioned her as to her\nmethod of calculation. \"What,\" I said, \"does 1440 stand\nfor ?\n\" \" That is the number of minutes in a day.\" \" How\ndo you know ?\n\" \" Why, any one would know that.\" \" Why\ndid you multiply it by 10?\" \"That is the number of days\n\u201414,400 is the number of minutes in 10 days\u2014that would\nbe 4 p.m. on the 25th\u201414,350 is 50 minutes less, so that\nmakes it 3.10.\"\nShe was awakened ; and it must be remembered that she\nwas always totally amnesic in the waking state for all that\nhad happened during hypnosis. I asked her if she could\ncalculate when 14,350 minutes after 4 p.m. on May 15\nwould fall due. She said she did not think she could. I\ntold her to take a pencil and work it out on paper. She\nthought for a minute and then put down 720 and multiplied\nit by 2. The result she multiplied by 5, and the sum so\nobtained she multiplied by 2, thus getting 14,400. Then\nshe subtracted 14,350 from 14,400 and said the time would\nbe 3.10 p.m. in 7 days after the 15th, or on May 22nd.\n1 told her that the answer was wrong ; but she said it\nmust be ri^ht, because 5 and 2 make 7. Not until it was\nO 7\n\fl,iv.] The Ajipreciation of Time by Somnambules. 25\npointed out to her did she see that multiplying 7200\nminutes by 2 gives the number of minutes in ten days, not\nseven.\nNo. 15. May 6, 1906, 12 noon\u2014in 3090 minutes (due\nMay 8, 3.30 p.m.).\nThis suggestion was given in the waking state. I had\nbeen making some experiments as to her power of appreciating\nthe passage of short periods of time when the suggestion was\nGiven in the waking state, and I had found that her time\nestimations were then as accurate as when the suggestions\nwere given during hypnosis. So I tried what the result\nwould be if a suggestion involving calculation were given in the\nwaking state. Endeavouring in every way to make sure that\nshe kept awake I made the suggestion given above. I told\nher all she had to do was to get the figures into her head,\nand that she was not to make any conscious calculation either\non paper or mentally. This she quite understood and agreed\nto. She had no idea when the cross fell due. She was not\nre-hypnotised.\nThis suggestion was fulfilled correctly during hypnosis in\nmy presence. On being asked in the waking state what she\nknew about the suggestion given on May 6th, she said that\nwhen at dinner, about half an hour after I left her, while\nshe and her people were talking and laughing, \" 3.30 p.m.,\nMay 8th,\" suddenly came into her head. She knew it was\nthe answer to the problem I had given her. She had not\ntroubled or made any calculation in regard to it, and did not\nknow whether it was right or not. She had recollected the\nmatter once or twice since, but had not troubled about it.\nThe whole experiment seems to have differed from those\nin which the suggestions were given in hypnosis only in the\nfact that the solution of the problem as to the terminal time\ncame into her mind in the waking state, and in that she had\nknowledge of the experiment in the waking state. She could\nrecollect that she had a cross to make at a certain time. She\ndid not, however, worry about doing it at the right time\nalthough she meant to do it. The prompting to do it at the\ntime it was due seemed to differ little, if at all, from what\nshe felt in the ordinary experiments.\n\f26 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nNo. 16. May 8, 1906, 4 p.m.\u2014in 42,312 minutes (due\nJune 7, 1.12 a.m.).\nNo. 17. May 8, 1906, 4 p.m.\u2014in 184,620 minutes (due\nSeptember 13, 9 p.m.).\nOn May 10th I asked her, during hypnosis, if she remembered\nthe suggestions given on May 8th. She repeated them correctly.\nAs to the solutions, she said she only knew one, which she\ngave correctly\u20141.12 a.m., June 7th. The other, she said, was\na long time\u2014September, about the 9th or 10th, probably about\n9 a.m., but she was not sure about this. (9 p.m., Sept. 13,\nis the right time.) She was not questioned again in regard\nto this suggestion until June 4th, when she said it fell due\non September 14th at 1.40 p.m. On being asked how many\ndays, hours, and minutes are in 184,620 minutes she said\n129 days 9 hours 12 minutes. (Wrong\u2014there are 128 days\n5 hours.) I then told her to work it out on paper without\nwaking up. She did so as follows\n:\n1440\n129\n12960 1440\n2880 1140\n1440 300\n185760 300\n184620\n1140\nHaving done this she said there are 128 days 5 hours\n(right). The method of calculation seems to be as follows\n:\n1440 x 129 = the number of minutes in 129 days. Therefore\nthe suggested number of minutes is less than 129 days. How\nmuch less? She subtracts 184,620 from 185,760. It is\n1140 minutes less. She then subtracts 1140 from 1440.\nThe suggested number of minutes, therefore equals 128 days\nand 300 minutes ; and 300 minutes are equal to 5 hours.\nThe last 300 put down in the sum was, she said, the result\nof the mental calculation, 60x5.\nShe could give no reason why she chose 129 as the\nmultiplier ; she said it just seemed to be the right number.\nIn connection with this calculation I may mention that on\na subsequent day I asked her in hypnosis how she would\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 27\nset about calculating mentally the number of days, hours,\nand minutes in 17 :\n700 minutes. She said at once that she\nwould multiply 1440 by 12. After about a minute she\nsaid that would give 17,280. Then she would subtract\n280 from 700, and so on. When asked why she multiplied\nby 12 rather than by 9, 10, or 11, she said she did not\nknow; she seemed to feel that it ought to be 12. She\nthought that when she worked out similar calculations in her\nnatural sleep she did them in the same way, but that she\nwent into such a very deep sleep when doing them that she\ncould not remember anything about the actual calculations\nafterwards (i.e. in her ordinary sleep state, or in hypnosis.\nShe was not referring to amnesia during wakino life ; for she\nrecognised that this always occurred in regard to the mental\noperations of all varieties of her sleep-state).\nBoth suggestions given on May 8th were fulfilled in due\ncourse at the proper times.\nNo. 18.

I then told her\nto write clown the answer as soon as she did know it, and\nto put down also the time and date of doing so, and to have\nit witnessed by Miss A., in whose company she would be for\nthe rest of the day. She was then awakened and I left at\n4.30 p.m.\n\f28 T. W.

She\nhad not been asleep in the interval.\nI had chosen the figures at random, and when the solution\nwas shown to me none of the three of us knew whether it\nwas correct or not until I worked it out on paper.

When, after its fulfilment, the\nsubject was asked in hypnosis what time she thought it was\n\f30 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nwhen the suggestion was given she said 12.20. When asked\nhow many days, hours, and minutes are in 4,580 minutes she\nreplied immediately, \"3 days, 4 hours, and 20 minutes.\" The\nresult of this experiment clearly points to her dependence on\nthe calculations rather than to any true appreciation of time\nas it passes. She supposed, or guessed, that the starting\ntime was 12.20 instead of 12.30 and fulfilled the suggestion\nin accordance with her calculation from the supposed time.\nNo. 29. July 16, 1906, 1 p.m.\u2014in 7460 minutes (due July\n21, 5.20 p.m.).\nThis suggestion was fulfilled at the correct time and was\nwitnessed by Miss A.\nNo. 30. July 22, 1906, 12.20 p.m.\u2014in 274,800 seconds\n(due July 25, 4.40 p.m.).\nWhen I had given this suggestion she said she could not\ndo seconds, and again that she did not think she would do\nit correctly. This belief was no doubt based upon her\nremembrance of her complete failure in the preliminary\nexperiment made on March 30th. Nevertheless No. 30 was\nfulfilled correctly on July 25 th at 4.40 p.m. and was\nwitnessed by Miss A.\nThe results of the foregoing experiments having convinced\nme that the method employed did not necessitate on the\npart of the subject any continuous watching of the time as\nit passed, I sought some way of giving the suggestions which\nwould do so. So far there is evidence only that a sub-\nconscious calculation is made soon after the suggestion is\ngiven ; and if the date so arrived at is some weeks ahead,\nthe subconscious mind, having noted the time at which the\nact is to be performed, seems able to go off duty as it were\nand simply wait for the arrival of the proper day.\nBut the experiments may be so arranged as to make it\nimpossible for any immediate calculation to be made, and to\nmake an almost continuous watching of the passage of time\na requisite of success. The method I have adopted is to\nmake the subject tell the number of days, hours, or minutes\nwhich elapse between the giving of the suggestion and a\npre-arranged signal ; the time at which the signal will be\n\fliv.] The Apjireciation of Time by Somnarnbules. 31\ngiven being left undetermined when making the suggestion.\nThe results of this method of investigation are made more\nstriking by the use of automatic writing. It is possible in\nthis way to get the result of the subconscious watching of\nthe time without having to re-induce hypnosis. An example\nwill illustrate what I mean.\nOn February 16th, 1907, at 12.30 p.m., I made the fol-\nlowing suggestion to F. D. in hypnosis :\n\" The next time I\ncall to see you, as soon as I give you a pencil and paper,\nyou will write down the number of hours and minutes\nthat will have elapsed between 12.30 p.m. to-day and the\nmoment at which I give you the pencil.\" When I made\nthis suggestion the date of my next visit was unknown even\nto myself.\nOn February 20th I called to see her at 10.35 a.m.\u2014\na\nvery unusual hour for my visit. At 10.40, before hypnotis-\ning her, I gave her a pencil and a piece of paper. She\nimmediately wrote down \" 94-\u201410.\" She was wide awake,\nand on being questioned she denied all knowledge of having\nwritten anything. In hypnosis she said that what she had\nwritten was meant for 94 hours 10 minutes, that being the\ntime that had elapsed since I made the suggestion on\nFebruary 16th. The answer is correct. She could give no\nexplanation of how she knew. She admitted that she might\nhave thought over the matter in her sleep at night, but she\ndid not remember having made any calculation. She had no\nrecollection of having thought anything about it that morning\n(February 20th). She had been very busy and had not\nnoticed what time it was when I called.\nOn February 20th, 1907, I made a similar suggestion at\n11 a.m., the interval this time to be expressed in minutes\ninstead of in hours.\nOn February 25 th I called to see her at 12.50 p.m. At\n12.55, before hypnotising her, I gave her a pencil and paper.\nShe smiled and asked what she had to do now. As she did\nnot write immediately I engaged her in conversation on a\nsubject that interested her, and she talked to me quite freely\nand intelligently. At the end of two minutes she wrote\ndown \"7315.\" (This is the correct number of minutes from\n11 a.m., February 20th, to 12.55 p.m., February 25th.) I\n\f32 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\npaid no attention to the writing for a few minutes. At a\npause in the conversation, covering the paper with my hand,\nI asked her if she had written anything. She did not know.\nShe thought she had noticed her hand moving, but she was\nnot sure. I showed the figures to her, but she did not know\nwhat they meant. In hypnosis she knew what she had.\nwritten and what it meant. She also remembered the conver-\nsation which took place while she was awake during the two\nminutes preceding the writing of the figures. On being asked\nhow she kept the record of the time she said she did not\nknow. She had no recollection of making any calculation\nafter I had given her the pencil. On being put into a\ndeeper stage of hypnosis and questioned she said she remem-\nbered adding 25 to 7290. She \"knew\" that it was 12.55\nwhen I gave her the pencil, and she knew that at 12.30 the\nnumber of minutes that had elapsed was 7290. She thought\nthat she kept the record up to time every half hour, but she\nwas not sure about this.\nIn these experiments I think there was a continuous sub-\nconscious watching of the time as it passed, and I believe\nthat the only calculation employed was the mental addition\nwhich took place at regular or irregular intervals. What\nthese intervals were I could not find out. It may, however,\nbe suggested that instead of watching and counting the hours\nand minutes as they passed, F. D. made a subconscious cal-\nculation after I arrived. I do not deny that this may be a\npossible explanation ; but considering the length of time she\nusually took to do such calculations subconsciously, I do not\nthink that she could have arrived at the correct answer in\nthe short time which elapsed between my arrival and the\nproduction of the writing.\nI have repeated these experiments on another subject, Mrs.\nC, who, as I have already said, disliked figures and was not\ngood at mental arithmetic. In this case I obtained the\nanswers by automatic speech instead of writing. On February\n21st, 1907, at 3.20 p.m., I gave the following suggestion to\nMrs. C. :\n' It is now twenty minutes past three. The next\ntime I call to see you, when I ask '\nHow long ?' you will\ntell me how many hours will have elapsed from now till\nthen.\" I called to see her on February 27th at 3.20 p.m.,\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 33\nand at once asked \"How long?\" She replied at once \"144\nhours.\" (Right.) In the waking state she said she did not know\nwhat this meant; but she said she had felt conscious that she had\nbeen counting the hours. At first she did not know what\nthis counting meant and thought it silly, but she came to\nthe conclusion that it was something I had asked her to do.\nShe did not consciously count ; but every few hours a num-\nber came into her head. She sometimes found herself think-\ning of some number of hours in the middle of the night\nwhen awake. In hypnosis she could give me no further\ninformation. In deep hypnosis she said she remembered\nthinking of 144 hours while lying reading just immediately\nbefore I entered the room.\nOn February 27th, 1907, at 3.30 p.m., a similar sugges-\ntion was given to Mrs. C, the interval to be expressed in\nminutes instead of in hours. On March 5th, at 3.40 p.m.,\nwhen she was asked \"How long?\" she said, after a few\nminutes, \" 8735 minutes.\" (Wrong\u201485 too many.) In the\nwaking state she said that she had been greatly troubled by the\nfeeling that she had been adding up figures, but she did not know\nwhat they meant. In hypnosis she knew that she had been\nadding up the minutes since 3.30 p.m. on February 27th,\nbut she did not know how often she made the additions.\nIn deep hypnosis she said that her last addition had been\n8395 + 340. This was made after I asked her \"How\nlong?\" but she did not know how she had got these figures.\nII.\nDelboeufs experiments on his subjects M. and J., and Dr.\nBramwell's experiments on Miss D. have many points in\ncommon with those numbered 1 to 30 which I have just\nrecorded. In all, the suggestions were given in such a way\nas to necessitate some calculation whereby the moment at\nwhich the act fell due became known to the subject's sub-\nconscious intelligence. That such a calculation was made by\ntheir subjects is admitted by both Delboeuf and Dr. Bram-\nwell ; but they both seem to have forgotten the main\nobject which Delboeuf had in view when he devised the\nplan of giving the suggestions in minutes instead of in days.\nc\n\f34 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nThat object was to eliminate the giving of a fixed date for-\nthe fulfilment of the hypnotic command.\nNow it must be apparent that when the subject has made\na calculation by which he arrives at the terminal time, his\nsubconscious intelligence is as surely in possession of a fixed\ndate as if it had been mentioned to him when the sugges-\ntion was given. When Delboeuf at 6.30 a.m. told J. to pull\nthe cook's nose in 1600 minutes,1\nhe might just as well\nhave told her to do so at 9.10 a.m. \u2014provided that she was\nable to make the necessary calculation. As a matter of fact\nJ. was a very poor arithmetician, and her calculation was wrong\nby 60 minutes. In the same way when Dr. Bramwell, at\n3.30 p.m., on February 26th, told Miss D. to make a cross\non a piece of paper in 20,180 minutes,2\nhe might just as\nwell have told her to make it at 3.50 p.m., on March 11th:\nfor Miss D. was very good at this sort of mental arithmetic.\nWhen this experiment came to be fulfilled it was evident\nthat Miss D. had correctly calculated the terminal time, but\nthe cross was not made until 3.51^-. This slight discrepancy\nbetween the calculation made and the appreciation of the time\npoints us to a fundamental distinction which should be made\nin considering these and similar experiments. If we do not\nkeep separate these totally different questions, the results\nappear to be more astonishing and inexplicable than they\nreally are. How subconscious calculations of the kind neces-\nsary in these experiments can be performed by half-educated\ngirls is one problem ; how somnambules can appreciate the\npassage of time, so as to know when the terminal minute so\ncalculated arrives, is another and a totally different problem.\nEach observer has encountered certain difficulties in under-\nstanding how the necessary calculations were or could have\nbeen performed by the subjects. The ignorant peasant girls\nwith whom Delboeuf experimented were in his opinion abso-\nlutely incapable, in the waking state, of reducing to. hours\nsuch a number of minutes as 1150. Unfortunately Delboeuf\ndid not examine M. to see whether during hypnosis her\narithmetical powers were any better than during the waking-\nstate. He did, however, test J.'s powers during hypnosis, but\ndelboeuf, Proceedings S. P. B., Vol. VIII., p. 418.\n- Bramwell, Hypnotism, p. 128.\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Sornnambules. 35\nhe does not say whether they were better or worse than\nduring the waking state. They were certainly very feeble,\nsince after ten minutes of severe mental effort she failed to\ntell how many hours are in 300 minutes. But it may be\nnoticed that J. succeeded very seldom in fulfilling hypnotic\ncommands at the right time. If we disregard for the time\nbeing any errors that may have been due to faulty time\nappreciation, and suppose that all her errors were due to mis-\ncalculation, we find that she made the same sort of mistakes\nin the experiments cited by Delboeuf as she made when\ntrying to do calculations during hypnosis or in the waking\nstate. Further, although J. was unable, during hypnosis, even\nafter struggling with the problem for ten minutes, to tell\nhow many hours are in 300 minutes, it is possible that she\nmight have arrived at the correct solution had she been\nallowed five hours in which to make the calculation. And\nthat is practically the length of time that would have been\nat the disposal of her subconscious intelligence if she had\nbeen told in hypnosis to perform some act at the end of\n300 minutes. All through the ensuing hours her subcon-\nscious mind would have been free to grapple with the\nproblem, and it is probable that she would have arrived at\nthe correct solution and would have fulfilled the command\nat or about the proper time.\nDelboeuf's neglect of questioning his subjects in hypnosis\nwith regard to their fulfilment of the suggestions, while\ndiminishing the value of his observations and leaving much\nuntold that might have been of interest, yet saved him from\nencountering the more formidable difficulties which Dr. Bram-\nwell had to contend with when he tried to find out how\nhis subject made the calculations in the series of experiments\nof which he has given so admirable a record.\nAt an early stage in his investigation Dr. Bramwell\nattempted to find out during hypnosis the subject's mental\ncondition in reference to the suggestions. In reply to his\nquestions she informed him:1\n(1) That when the suggestions\nwere made in hypnosis she did not calculate when they fell\ndue. (2) That she did not calculate them at any time\nafterwards during hypnosis. (3) That she had no recollection\n1\nBramwell, Hypnotism, p. 122.\n\f36 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nof them when hypnosis terminated. (4) That no memory of\nthem afterwards rose in the waking state. (5) That shortly\nbefore their fulfilment she always experienced a motor impulse,\ni.e. her fingers moved as if to grasp a pencil and to perform\nthe act of writing. (6) That this impulse was immediately\nfollowed by the idea of making a cross and writing certain\nfigures. (7) That she never looked at clock or watch until\nafter she had made her record.\nOn almost all of these points my own observations on F. D.\nare in complete agreement with Dr. Bramwell's findings. The\nonly noticeable difference is in regard to the awareness of the\nmotor impulse. F. D. certainly had a motor impulse, but she\nwas aware of it only as a vague feeling that she had to do\nsomething. This vague feeling soon became defined, and she\nknew that she had to make a cross and write down the time.\nAnother and more important difference between Dr. Bram-\nwell's results and mine is to be found in connection with the\nhypnotic memory of the suggestions in the period intervening\nbetween the time when they were given and their fulfilment.\nDr. Bramwell says that when Miss D. was questioned in\nhypnosis as to unfulfilled suggestions, \" she invariably recalled\nthe fact that these had been made, but rarely remembered\ntheir exact terms. She always asserted that she had never\nthought of them, did not know how much time had elapsed\nsince they had been given nor when they were due.\" 1\nFrom the very beginning of my experiments on F. D. I\nfound that when hypnotised in the period intervening between\nthe giving of a suggestion and its fulfilment, she almost\ninvariably remembered the exact terms of the suggestion,\nwhen it had been given, and knew when its fulfilment fell\ndue. Yet she, like Dr. Bramwell's subject, denied all know-\nledge of having made any calculation. The most that she\nwould admit was that she thought of figures sometimes in\nher sleep ; but she could not remember any calculation although\nshe sometimes said that she remembered thinking of the questions\nand the answers on these occasions. In the waking state\nshe had no recollection of dreaming about figures.\nThis absence of hypnotic memory as to the manner in\nwhich the calculations were made is regarded by Dr. Bramwell\nbramwell, Hypnotism, p. 137.\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 37\nas one of the principal points which demand explanation in\nconnection with his experiments.1\nSince the acts of hypnotic\nlife, with certain well-marked exceptions which he cites, are\nperformed consciously, and can be recalled by suggestion in\nsubsequent hypnoses ; and since, further, the hypnotic memory\nis more exact and far reaching than the normal one, the\nabsence of memory in hypnosis as to given circumstances of\nhypnotic life, other than those which he cites, is regarded\nby him as markedly suspicious.2\nFrom what we know of\nhypnotic memory, he thinks it is impossible to doubt that\nif calculations had been made by the subjects, they would\nhave been able to remember them when again hypnotised.\nIn the reasoning which led him to this conclusion Dr.\nBramwell seems to have made an assumption which is not\nwarranted in the present state of knowledge. The memory in\nhypnosis of the events of previous hypnoses is as a rule very\ncomplete ; but we have no evidence that re-hypnotisation will\nenable us to revive in the mind of the subject all subliminal\nmentation that may have taken place during waking life.\nIn fact so far as this question has been made a subject of\ninvestigation, the available evidence, when closely examined,\npoints rather to an opposite conclusion. In many of Gurney's\nexperiments on automatic writing it was found that the subject\nwhen re-hypnotised could not remember what he had written\nautomatically in the waking state until he had visualised the\nactual writing which he had produced. This ignorance in\nhypnosis of the content of subliminal thought was still more\napparent when some simple calculation had to be made\n1\nBramwell, Hypnotism, pp. 409, 410.\n2\nI am not quite sure what Dr. Bramwell means by \" markedly suspicious.\n\"\nHe does not, I imagine, mean to impugn the subject's good faith, although\nthat is the interpretation which first suggests itself to the reader. Nor do I\nthink he means that the absence of memory is evidence either of absence of\nconsciousness or of the non-making of calculations. He admits that calculations\nare made and that they are made by \"some intelligence.\" What I think he does\nmean is that the absence of memory is strong evidence that the calculations are\nnot made by the \"hypnotic self.*' He says: \"The fact that nothing could\nbe recalled by the ordinary hypnotic self regarding calculations which must\ninevitably have been made in some form of hypnosis, apparently showed that\nthe subject possessed a third substratum of the personality\" (op. cit. p. 391).\nBy \"some form of hypnosis'' I think Dr. Bramwell means some stratum of\nhypnotic consciousness.\n\f38 T.

Thus when W\u2014s was\ntold in hypnosis to sum the digits from 1 to 9 and instantly\nawakened, planchette wrote down the figures and summed\nthem up. But when the subject was re-hypnotised he had\nno recollection of what he had written, or even of having\nwritten at all.\n1\nThis result, however, was exceptional. As\na rule the subject, on being re-hypnotised, knew what he had\nwritten ; if he had written the answer to any sum given to\nhim in hypnosis, he knew what figures he had written ; but\nthere is little evidence in Gurney's papers that the subject\never remembered the actual steps of the calculation by which\nhe had arrived at that answer. It does not seem, however,\nthat Gurney directed his attention specially to this point, as\nthere is no explicit mention of it in his paper.\nI have repeated Gurney's experiments on several subjects,\nand while getting results entirely congruous with those obtained\nby him, only under exceptional circumstances and by inducing\na very deep stage of hypnosis have I succeeded in reviving\nin the mind of the subject the slightest recollection of the\nvarious stages of the mental process employed in the solution\nof the problems. If the calculations are made during hypnosis\nthere is as a rule no difficulty in remembering in subsequent\nhypnosis the various steps by which the answer is arrived at.\nI gave F.

In many instances, no matter what\nartifices I might adopt, I failed to revive anything but the\nvaguest traces of recollection.\nUp to a certain point in his reasoning Dr. Bramwell\nseems to assume that the self-consciousness of the hypnotised\nsubject can exhaust the content of the subliminal mind in\nits totality. Yet, at a later stage, by postulating as the real\ncalculator a third self,\n1\nseparate and distinct from the hypnotic\nself, he practically abandons the basis on which his whole\nargument so far has rested.\nThe tendency of some modern psychologists lightly to give\nup belief in the unitary character of man's being is greatly\nto be deprecated. Neither the records of multiple personality\nnor the phenomena of hypnotism warrant the conclusion that\nevery human being contains within himself an indefinite number\nof separate selves. In spontaneous cases of multiple person-\nality the complete dissociation of consciousness manifested in\nthe different states may justify the use of the word self to\ndesignate each of the alternating phases ; and the same may\nbe said of some exceptional hypnotic subjects, such as Janet's\nLeonie ;\"\n2\nbut neither convenience nor customary usage justifies\nthe application of the term to those isolated manifestations of\nsubliminal thought which may be exhibited spontaneously, or as\na result of hypnotic suggestion, in healthy persons. It may\nbe convenient, however, in investigating such operations of\nthe subliminal part of the mind as are manifested in connection\nwith the hypnotic state, to conceive subconsciousness as a\n1\nBramwell, Hypnotism, p. 413.\n2\nPierre Janet, VAiUomatisme Psycholojique, 2nd Ed., Paris, 1894.\n\f40 T.

Or, to change the metaphor,\nwe may regard it as we do those regions of the earth's crust\nwhich lie below the surface of every-day observation. The\ndanger of such metaphors is obvious, but it is probably less\nmisleading to speak of the hypnotic stratum of consciousness\nthan of the hypnotic self. This is especially so if by using\nthe term hypnotic self we imply that it is co-extensive with\nthe subliminal self; for there is abundant evidence, derived\nfrom various sources, that the region of mental life laid bare-\nat any one time by the induction of hypnosis is but a\nfraction of the subliminal, just as the supraliminal is but a\nfraction of mental life in its totality.\nWe must not then suppose that hypnotisation will enable\nus to bring to the surface the memory of all subliminal\nmentation which may go on during waking life. The memory\ntest in regard to mental processes supposed to be carried on\nat the hypnotic level, has positive but not negative validity\n;\nand even if a want of recollection during hypnosis of the\nevents of previous hypnoses did not sometimes occur, we could\nnot deny the possibility of a subconscious train of thought,\n\u2014\neven if this were started by a suggestion given during hypnosis,\n\u2014of which no recollection can be aroused by re-hypnotisation.\nSo far as I can find, writers on hypnotism have not dealt\nexplicitly with this question. Much of the evidence to be\nfound in Gurney's papers, and that which I have met with\nin my own investigations, points to a very curious conclusion\nwith regard to the elements of subconscious thinking that can\nbe recalled in the hypnotic state. Sensory impressions that\nhave been subliminally perceived are as a rule remembered\nin hypnosis ; and with the memory of the impression comes\na memory of the thought accompanying or occasioned by it.\nBodily acts, such as writing or speaking, originating subliminally ;\nare also, as a rule, remembered in hypnosis ; and along with\nthe recollection of the written or spoken words there comes\nof course a knowledge of their meaning ; and there may be\nthus a simulation of remembrance of the content of a sub-\nconscious thought. When a thought has not been the\nimmediate result of a subliminally perceived sensory impression.\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 41\nor has not been externalised in any motor act, a memory of\nit may sometimes be found in hypnosis if the thought is\nthe conclusion of a subconscious train of reasoning, or the\nanswer to a problem which has been solved subliminally.\nGeneralisation in regard to the peculiarities of hypnotic\nand post-hypnotic states is nearly always a mistake ; and I\ndo not for a moment deny that in exceptional circumstances\nmemory of a much wider range of subliminal thought than\nthat which I have indicated may be found during hypnosis\n;\nbut in the ordinary somnambule it is, I think, very difficult\nto find any indisputable evidence of memory of a subconscious\nthought which cannot be included in one of the categories I\nhave named.\nAs I have said, acts originating subliminally are remembered,\nand with the remembrance of the act comes also a remembrance\nof the thought which immediately prompted it. But if this\nact is the result of a subconscious train of reasoning or of\ncalculation, there may be, and in my own experiments I have\nfound that there generally is, no recollection of the various\nantecedent stages of thought which have led up to it. The\nevidence as to these unremembered things is mainly negative ;\nfor example, the difficulty in finding any hypnotic memory\nof the actual doing of subliminal calculations. As to remem-\nbered things there is, of course, plenty of evidence. If a\npost-hypnotic act is to be performed when the operator coughs\nfor the fifth time, the subliminal perception of the coughs is\nremembered in hypnosis ; and if the subject be hypnotised\nafter the fourth cough he will sometimes give proof of being\nin an attitude of expectancy for the final signal. There is\nabundant evidence that acts originating subliminally are\nremembered\u2014all suggested post-hypnotic acts for example.\nEven if the act in question had not been distinctly specified\nwhen the suggestion was given, but was the result of a certain\namount of spontaneity and choice, or of even more elaborate\nmental processes, on the part of the secondary consciousness,\nthe doing of it can, as a rule, be recollected during hypnosis.\nThat the results of subliminal calculation may sometimes be\nremembered in hypnosis was shown in the series of experi-\nments with F. D. ; but that they sometimes may not be\nremembered is equally clear from Dr. Bramwell's observations.\n\f42 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nThe difficulty in finding any memory of the continuous\nthinking which we know can go on subliminally would seem\nto be especially great if the train of thought necessitates\nsome concentration of subliminal attention, as in the calcula-\ntions required in the time-experiments recorded by Delboeuf,\nDr. Bramwell, and myself ; and I know no better description\nof the nature of the mental state in which such calculations\nare presumably made than that given to me by F. D., in\nhypnosis, when she said that she \" went into such a very\ndeep sleep when doing them that she could not remember\nanything about the actual calculations afterwards.\"\nThis deepening of the sleep, which I believe actually takes\nplace\u2014a \" sleep \" of the hypnotic stratum of consciousness\n\u2014\nmay be merely a concentration of attention on the problem\nto be solved. The amount of attention which can be brought\nto bear is at all times limited ; and even during waking\nlife, if the attention becomes completely absorbed by some\nexperience, the marginal elements in the conscious field may\nbecome so wholly submerged that only at the end of the\nexperience do we \" come to ourselves \" and take up the thread\nof our life in relation to the external world. So, when sub-\nconscious attention is concentrated on the solution of an\narithmetical problem given in hypnosis, absorption in the\nproblem becomes so complete that only when the solution has\nbeen attained does the consciousness of the hypnotic stratum\n\" come to itself,\" and enter into relation with those subconscious\nthoughts which form the memory-continuum of the hypnotic\nstate.\nIn the case of my own subject, F. D., the period of natural\nsleep seemed to be the time chosen for the working out of\nthe calculations. And it is reasonable to suppose that the\nsubliminal is seldom so completely segregated from the supra-\nliminal consciousness as not to be to some extent disturbed\nin its operations by the experiences of waking life. But when\nthe repose of natural sleep supervenes we can imagine the\nsubconscious mind at the hypnotic level settling down to the\nsolution of its task, becoming absorbed in its work, and \" coming\nto itself \" when the problem has been solved. Again I appeal\nto the information given by the subject in hypnosis ;\nF. D. said\nthat she sometimes remembered thinking in her sleep of the\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 43\nquestions and the answers, but she denied all knowledge of\nhaving made any calculations.\nThe second point which Dr. Brainwell thinks demands an\nexplanation is \" the fact that the suggestions not only involved\nfeats of arithmetical calculations and memory far beyond the\nsubjects' normal powers, but also in some cases beyond their\nordinary hypnotic ones.\" 1\nI have already referred to the calculations made by Delboeuf's\nsubjects, and I have pointed out the importance of the amount of\ntime which is at the disposal of the subconscious intelligence\nfor the working out of the problems. In regard to Dr. Bram-\nwell's experiments and my own, the first thing which must\nbe taken into consideration is the comparative simplicity of\nthe earlier problems and their gradual increase in difficulty\n-as time went on. We must not undervalue the facility in\ncalculation which practice brings, and whatever method of\nreducing minutes to hours and days a subject may adopt,\nthere seems little doubt that familiarity with certain equiva-\nlents of minutes in days and hours must soon become established,\nand be utilised in the solution of what at first sight may appear\nvery complex arithmetical problems.\nI find that the apparently clumsy plan adopted by F. D.\nof making the number of minutes in a day her basis of calcula-\ntion is singularly well adapted for the solution of such problems\n;\nfor just as in the earlier experiments the number of minutes\nin one, two, or three days, became fixed in the mind, so in\nthe later and more difficult ones simple multiples of 1440\nshowed at once the number of days, plus or minus some\nnumber of minutes less than 1440, in any given experiment.\nFor example, after a little experience of problems of this\ndescription, one soon comes to know and to remember that\n10,080 is the number of minutes in a week. Given this\nknowledge it will be seen that the first problem correctly\nsolved in hypnosis by Miss D. (Dr. Bramwell's Exp. 26)\n2\nwas\na very simple one indeed. At 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 12th,\na suggestion was given to be fulfilled in 10,115 minutes. The\nonly mental arithmetic necessary is to subtract 80 from 115.\nThe suggestion is then at once known to be due in a week plus\n35 minutes, or \"next Wednesday at 25 minutes to 4 p.m.\"\n1\nBramwell, Hypnotism, p. 409. 2\nBramwell, Hypnotism, p. 127.\n\f44 T. W. Mitchell, M.R [part\nLooked at in the same way, many of the other suggestions\nwhich at first sight seem to necessitate considerable powers\nof mental arithmetic, are rendered very simple. Thus in Dr.\nBramwell's Exp. 39 \u2014in 20,180 minutes from 3.30 p.m.\u2014all\nthat is necessary is to recognise that 10,080 x 2 = 20,160,\nand the date at which the suggestion falls clue is immediately\nseen to be 3.50 p.m. a fortnight hence. Practically all the\nproblems solved correctly by Miss D. in hypnosis were of a\nsimilarly simple kind ; and of the few to which I got correct\nanswers from my subject, F. D., the same thing holds good.\nIn his statement of the point demanding explanation in\nregard to the calculations, Dr. Bramwell assumes that arith-\nmetical powers are always greater during hypnosis than in\nwaking life. The evidence in favour of this belief is by no\nmeans unequivocal. We have seen that in Delboeufs subject\nJ. there was during hypnosis apparently little improvement\nin her calculating powers ; and my own experience with most\nof my somnambules is quite in accord witli this result. On\ntwenty-four occasions Dr. Bramwell's subject, Miss D., was\nasked, immediately after the suggestions were given, and before\nthe termination of hypnosis, to calculate when the suggested\nact fell due. In the first nine instances she was wrong, and\nin the remaining fifteen she was right in eleven and wrong\nin four. \" As the experiments advanced, not only the fre-\nquency, but also the extent, of Miss D.'s errors in calculation\ndecreased, and the answers were given much more rapidly.\nSometimes the correct replies were almost instantaneous, and\nin these instances no conscious calculation could be traced.\" 1\nHere, again, we have to note the effects of practice in facilitating\nthe mental operations necessary in such calculations. There\nis really nothing very wonderful in the fact that an intelligence\nwhich has been for several weeks engaged in solving problems\nsuch as were given to Miss D. in hypnosis, should at last\nsucceed in telling, almost immediately, when an act to be\nperformed at the end of 10,050 minutes falls due. Dr. Bram-\nwell says that in the waking state Miss D. failed in doing-\nmental calculations unless the sums were extremely simple.\nBut she similarly failed, to begin with, in the hypnotic state.\nHad a parallel series of problems been given to Miss D. in the\n1\nBramwell, Hypnotism, p. 137.\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 45\nwaking state from the beginning, or even from the 8th of\nJanuary, when she was first asked to make calculations during\nhypnosis, there can be little doubt that by February 5 th,\nwhen she first succeeded in giving a correct answer in hypnosis,\nshe would have been able to solve the same problem as readily\nin the waking state. But no such training of the waking\nintelligence having taken place, the hypnotic intelligence was\nby February 5th, if not the better calculator, at least in\npossession of certain data, useful in the particular kind of\ncalculations required, of which the waking intelligence was\nquite ignorant.\nThe most curious detail of these problems solved in hypnosis,\nand one which I have frequently verified in my own experi-\nments, is that when correct answers were given immediately,\n\" no conscious calculation could be traced.\" I presume that\nby this phrase Dr. Bramwell means that the subject herself\nwas not conscious of making any calculation. But we must\nremember how difficult introspection is to an untrained mind ;\nand the difference between a conclusion arrived at by a short\ncalculation and one which depends immediately on a know-\nledge of certain facts, is sometimes not quite obvious, even to\na trained observer. I know that there are 365 days in a\nyear. If I am asked how many days there are from the 1st\nof January, 1907, to the 2nd of January, 1908, and I answer\nimmediately 366, have I made a calculation? Or am I merely\nstating a fact which is as well known to me as that there are\nseven days in a week ? So if Miss D., in hypnosis, knew that\nthere are 10,080 minutes in a week, would it be necessary\nfor her to make any calculation to tell when an act suggested\nto be done in 10,090 minutes fell due?\nAs I have already indicated, a memory of the results of\nsubconscious calculations made in response to suggestions given\nin hypnosis becomes a possession of the hypnotic stratum of\nconsciousness. Thus when F. D. worked out on paper, during\nhypnosis, the calculation in experiment No. 13, she put down\n1440 and multiplied it by 10. She knew that 1440 is the\nnumber of minutes in a day, and thought that \"any one would\nknow that.\" This knowledge was, no doubt, the result of a\nsubconscious calculation which she had forgotten.\nO\nIn my own experiments I gave my subjects very few\n\f46 T. W. Mitchell, M.I). [part\nopportunities of making calculations in hypnosis. I rather\ndirected my attention to the investigation of the subconscious\ncalculations which are made after hypnosis has terminated. I\nhave found little evidence that calculation in hypnosis is, as a\nrule, appreciably more rapid or more accurate than in the\nwaking state, except in so far as such data as I have indicated,\nresulting from training during hypnosis or from subconscious\ncalculation in post-hypnosis, may become a possession of the\nhypnotic stratum of consciousness, and thereby facilitate the\nsolution of such problems during the hypnotic state. With\nregard to subconscious calculations performed after hypnosis is\nterminated, the investigation is more difficult, and the con-\nclusions to be arrived at more doubtful. In some of Gurney's\nexperiments there seems to have been a more rapid calculation\nthan was possible in the waking state. In my own experi-\nments I have found little evidence that mental calculations\ncan be performed subconsciously more quickly than they can\nbe in hypnosis or in ordinary waking life. On the contrary,\nI have found, in some cases at least, that if the waking\nconsciousness is actively engaged, a length of time as great or\ngreater than would be required for the solution of the problem\nin ordinary waking, or in hypnosis, is necessary for the sub-\nconscious calculation. On the other hand, there is evidence\nto show that problems, the mental solution of which would\nseem to be beyond the powers of the waking or of the hypnotic\nconsciousness may be correctly solved under favourable circum-\nstances, such as during natural sleep, as the result of a purely\nsubconscious calculation.\nAlthough I am inclined to ascribe most importance to the\nuninterrupted concentration of attention which may be possible\nat the hypnotic level, and to the length of time which is\navailable by the subconscious intelligence for making the cal-\nculations, still, there may be, in some instances, both in\nhypnosis and in post-hypnosis, a facilitation of mental operations\nat the hypnotic level which is impossible in supraliminal\nthouoht. Such a facilitation of mental calculations would arise\nif the subject were able to visualise the figures employed, so\nthat they had for him the reality and permanence which\nsuggested visual hallucinations have for many somnambules.\nWe know from the work of Charcot, Gilbert Ballet, and\n\fLIV.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 47\nSir Francis Galton, that individuals vary very much as to the\nnature of the sensory images which they most habitually use\nas their counters of thought. Some people, when thinking of\nthings or events, depend almost entirely on their visual\nmemory. Some, on the other hand, rely greatly on auditory\nor kinaesthetic representations. Even the thinking that is\ndone in words is subject to similar variations, and there are\nsome people whose most abstract thought is accompanied by a\ntrain of visual verbal imagery. With regard to words, how-\never, this is undoubtedly exceptional ; and notwithstanding\nthe opinion of Bain and Strieker, that motor representations\nform the material of our recollection in the use of words, I\nthink there is little doubt that the view put forward in this\ncountry by Dr. Charlton Bastian, and in France by Victor Egger,\nwhich gives pre-eminence to auditory representations, is true for\nthe great majority of people who habitually think in words.\nBut with regard to the thought-symbols of arithmetic, it is\nquite different. Here visual representation is the rule ; and\nit will, I think, be found that skill in mental arithmetic is\nalmost always accompanied by unusual powers of visualisation.\nSo far as my own experiments go, I have found that if a\nsomnambule is a good visucl he will, other things being equal,\nbe more expert at mental arithmetic during hypnosis than one\nwho is not. He will also, I think, show increased capacity,\nor at least will solve the problems more rapidly during hypnosis\nthan in the waking state. I have also found some indications\nthat he will perform calculations subconsciously in post-hypnosis\nmore rapidly, but on this point the evidence is not very\nconclusive.\nAlthough individuals vary greatly in their powers of visual-\nisation, very few people in the waking state can visualise\nsufficiently well to enable them to keep steadily before the\nmind all the figures in a sum of any considerable length ; but\nif a somnambule is visuel in the normal state, it is quite\npossible that during hypnosis, or in the working of the hypnotic\nstratum of consciousness at other times, such an increase of\nfaculty may readily take place. If this possibility be accepted,\nand if allowance be made for hypnotic training of the calcu-\nlating faculty, for increased power of attention at the hypnotic\nlevel of consciousness, and for the length of time at the\n\f48 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\ndisposal of the subconscious intelligence in arriving at a correct\nsolution of the more difficult problems, the contention that\nthe solution of these problems involved feats of arithmetical\ncalculation beyond the normal powers of the subjects loses\nmuch of its force. We should rather be inclined to expect\nthat somnambules who have undergone some training in sub-\nconscious calculation, might be able to perform subconsciously\nproblems as difficult as any that they could do in the waking-\nstate with the help of pencil and paper.\nI have made only one or two experiments of this nature.\nOn one occasion I told F. D., during hypnosis, to write down\nin my presence the next time I called to see her, the number\nof halfpennies in \u00a336 17s. Hid. I saw her two days later,\nand while awake and talking to me she wrote down the\ncorrect answer. Awake, she did not know what the figures\nmeant, or why she had written them. In hypnosis she remem-\nbered the suggestion, and knew that what she had written\nwas the answer. She did not know when she had solved\nthe problem, and had no recollection of having made any\ncalculation. On another occasion I asked her, while awake,\nif she knew how many yards are in a mile. She said she\ndid not. In hypnosis I told her to write down, in my presence,\nwhen I called to see her a<min, the number of feet in two\nand a half miles. She said she was sure she could not do\nthis. The correct answer was written down in my presence\nfive clays later.\nAlthough the solution of the more difficult problems\noccurring in the time-experiments would seem to necessitate\nsome such facilitation of the mental calculations as I have\nsuggested, there is not, in the instances recorded up to the\npresent, anything to warrant the belief that the subconscious\npowers of the subjects are in this respect any greater than\nmight be expected from their standard of education ; and were\nthese the only examples of subconscious calculations on record\nwe might be content with some such explanation as I have\nsuggested. But the powers of subconscious calculation\nexhibited by calculating prodigies such as Oauss or Dase\nshould deter us from being too sure that the solution of the\ncomparatively simple problems given to hypnotic somnambules\nmay not be the work of some truly supernormal faculty the\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 49\nmere suspicion of whose existence would be a heresy for\northodox science.\nThe third point which Dr. Bramwell thinks needs to be\ntaken into consideration when trying to explain the results of\nhis own experiments is the difference in the nature of the\ntime-appreciation required in Gurney's cases and in those\ncited by himself. He says\n:\n1 \" There is a marked difference\nbetween the recognition of a particular clay on its arrival, and\nthe last minute in such a series as 40,845. . . . Granting\nthat some intelligence worked out the arithmetical portion and\ndetermined that the suggestion fell due, for example, at\n3.25 p.m. a fortnight later, the determination of the arrival\nof that particular moment differs widely from the recognition\nof the dawning of a given day.\"\nNow I venture to think that unless special precautions are\ntaken to keep the subject away from all ordinary means of\nknowing the time, there is very little difference indeed between\nthe two kinds of experiment. Dr. Bramwell says that in\nGurney's experiments the secondary intelligence would have\nno difficulty in recognising the terminal clay because \" the\nvarying impressions from the external world, which tell us that\na new day has dawned, would be received as freely by the\nsecondary as by the primary consciousness.\" 2\nBut in the\nsame way the visual or auditory impressions which give\ninformation of the time of day to the primary consciousness\nwill be equally open to the secondary consciousness ; and the\nsecondary consciousness will be on the look-out for such\ninformation even when the primary consciousness is so engaged\nas apparently to preclude all time watching.\nThe difficulty of preventing such access of subliminal know-\nledge will be especially great when the experiments are carried\non in towns ; for then, unless special precautions are taken, it is\nalmost impossible to keep the subject out of reach of visual or\nauditory indications of the passage of time. Clock-dials assail\nthe eye at every step, and church bells chime the quarters all\nthrough the clay and night ; and we must not neglect the\npossibilities of the information that may be so obtained by a\nwatchful subconsciousness. In this connection we must also\nbear in mind the possibility that subconscious perception may\n1\nBramwell, Hypnotism, p. 412. -Bramwell, Hypnotism, p. 412.\nD\n\f50 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nhave normally the immensely extended range which perception\nin hypnosis attains under suggestion. If such be the case, the\ndifficulty of assuring ourselves, even when apparently stringent\nprecautions are taken, that the subconscious mind does not\nreceive its information through the ordinary sensory channels\nis greatly increased. When no such precautions are taken it\nseems obvious that under ordinary circumstances there is\nlittle difference in the nature of the time-watching involved,\nwhether the suggested act is to be fulfilled on \" the 39th\nday from this,\" or at \"3.25 p.m. a fortnight later.\" But if,\nas Dr. Bramwell says, 1 \" in some instances Miss D. was in\na darkened room for several hours before the suocrestion was\nexecuted, and absolutely without any of the ordinary methods\nof determining the time, even if she knew what o'clock it\nwas when she entered the room, how could she determine\nwhen it was 3.25?\" Now, I think we may take it for\ngranted that whether \" she \" knew the time or not when she\nentered the room, her subconscious intelligence knew\u2014if, in\norder to fulfil the suggestion correctly, it was necessary for it\nto know. So that the original problem of recognising the\narrival of the terminal minute of 40,845 minutes becomes\nreduced to that of appreciating the passage of time for\n3 hours and 25 minutes, or of knowing when it was\n3.25 p.m. If we can exclude the possibility which I have\nsuggested that even in the darkened room her subconscious\nmind was not \" absolutely without any of the ordinary\nmethods of determining the time,\" then we have arrived at\nwhat I consider to be the ultimate problem demanding\nexplanation in all these experiments on the appreciation of\ntime by somnambules.\nMy own observations carried on in the quiet of the\ncountry are to some extent not open to the same criticism\nas are those of observers working in more populous districts.\nF. D. lives in a cottage far removed from church bells, and\nthe only clock in the house is the kitchen clock, which does\nnot strike the hours. She possesses a watch which she keeps\nwound up ; but she scarcely ever wears it when she is at\nhome. It generally lies on her dressing-table all day and all\nnight. Her opportunities of obtaining subliminal information\nbramwell, Hypnotism, p. 412.\n\fLi v.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 51\nof the \" time of day \" through ordinary sensory channels are\nthus very restricted; and experiments with her afford better\nevidence of true time-appreciation than those with subjects\nwhose surroundings give more opportunities for subliminal\nperception of such ordinary indications of the passage of time\nas I have referred to.\nWhat I mean by true time- appreciation is the power of\nmarking the passage of time without any guidance, either supra-\nliminal or subliminal, which can by any possibility be referred\nto changes going on in the external world. If the conditions\nnecessary for testing this power can ever be arranged, it is\nevident that they can be maintained for only comparatively\nshort periods. We cannot expect to find subjects who are\nwilling to be confined in a dark room for any length of time,\nor to have the usual routine of their lives disturbed for the\nsake of our experiments ; and even if such subjects could be\nfound, there are probably few competent observers who could\nspare the time necessary for making exact observations.\nThe nearest approach to evidence of a true time-watching\ntaking place over a longer interval than a few hours is to be\nfound in connection with prolonged hypnotic sleep. I lately\nhad occasion to recommend to Mrs. C. a sleep of forty-eight\nhours, with intervals for meals. I saw her on a Tuesday, and\nshe told me that she could spare the necessary time after 3\no'clock the next day. I was going away from home on the\nWednesday, so I gave her the necessary instructions during\nhypnosis on the Tuesday. I said :\n\" To-morrow at 3 o'clock\nyou will go to sleep. You will sleep till 9 o'clock and then\nwake up and have some supper. You will then go to sleep,\nand sleep till 8 o'clock next morning. You will then wake\nup and have breakfast. After breakfast you will go to sleep,\nand you will sleep till 1 o'clock,\" and so on. I saw her on\nThursday and found that my instructions had been followed out.\nEach time she had awakened she had remained awake for\nhalf-an-hour exactly, and had then fallen asleep again. This\nexact half-hour interval must have been the result of an auto-\nsuggestion ; for I had not given any definite instructions as to\nhow long she was to remain awake. On the Friday I called\nto see her in the forenoon and found her sleeping peacefully.\nI awoke her and asked her if she knew what day it was.\n\f52 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nShe said it was Friday. She showed some hesitation as to\nwhether it was forenoon or afternoon, but finally said it was\nforenoon. She was quite unable, however, to tell what the\ntime was. She was unwilling even to guess, for she maintained\nthat she had no idea what it might be. I said to her, \" Sleep.\nWhat is the exact time?\" She replied at once, \"11.20.\" I\ntook out my watch and found that her answer was correct.\nThere was no clock in the room. I did not know what the\nexact time was until I looked at my watch.\nIn this case there seems to have been a true appreciation\nof the passage of time throughout the whole period of sleep.\nThe watching of the time was done by the hypnotic conscious-\nness ; and the knowledge of the time of day so obtained was\nin the possession of the hypnotic consciousness alone.\nApart from such observations as may be made in connection\nwith prolonged hypnotic sleep, I greatly regret that I have\nnever been able to spare the time necessary to test my subjects'\npowers of true time-appreciation over a longer period than\nhalf-an-hour.\nI have, however, made a large number of observations within\nthe limited time at my disposal, and these are sufficient to\nconvince me that in the true time-appreciation of somnambules\nwe have to deal with a power which in the present state of\nknowledge can only be described as supernormal.\nGurney made many observations on his subjects in regard\nto their power of appreciating the passage of short periods of\ntime. He has recorded a number of instances in which an\nact suggested in hypnosis has been performed more or less\npunctually at the end of a given number - of minutes, the\nsubject having been under observation during the whole\ncourse of the experiment. He also utilised automatic writing\nwith planchette to obtain evidence of the subconscious time-\nwatching that can go on during the waking state. The\nsubject, having been taught how to write with planchette,\nwas told in hypnosis to perform some act in a given number\nof minutes, and that he would be required at some time\nbefore then to write the number of minutes that had passed.\nThus one of his subjects \"was told on March 23rd that a\nquarter of an hour after his next arrival he was to open and\nshut the door of the room, and to note the course of time\n\fLIV.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 53\nas usual. The next evening he arrived at 7.6 \\. He was\nset to the planchette at 7.19. The writing, produced at\nonce, was 13 min. and 2 more. At 7.22 he rose, walked\nacross the room, opened and shut the door, and returned\nto his seat. Here the reckoning was not more than half a\nminute out.\"\n1\nI have made a great many observations more or less on\nthe lines of Gurney's experiments ; but I have thought it\nbest to make the suggested act as simple as possible. It is\nimportant in testing for accuracy in time-watching that the\nact to be performed should be one to which the subject has\nno objection whatsoever, so that when it is about to be\nperformed in the waking state there may be no resistance\nfrom the supraliminal consciousness to be overcome. This\nensures its fulfilment at the moment of the subliminal invasion.\nIt is also well that the act should be one which can be\nperformed rapidly, so that as little time as possible may\nelapse between its beginning and its end. The suggestion\ngiven in most of my experiments was that at the end of\nso many minutes the subject should raise her right or her\nleft hand above her head. She was told to do it rapidly as\nsoon as the idea of doing so arose in her mind. Sometimes\ntwo or three suggestions were given together, the acts to be\nperformed at the end of different time intervals. In obtaining\nautomatic writing in these experiments, instead of using\nplanchette, I always got the subject to write with a pencil.\nA few examples will sufficiently illustrate the nature of these\nexperiments.\nI suggested to F. ~D. in hypnosis, without telling her the\ntime, that in eleven minutes exactly she would raise her\nright arm. She was then awakened, and she raised her arm\nat the end of ten minutes. On another occasion she was\ntold in hypnosis that her right arm would go up in four\nminutes. This suggestion was fulfilled in hypnosis about ten\nseconds too soon. She was then told that her arm would\ncome down in three minutes. This was fulfilled in the\nwaking state in three minutes exactly. When she was\nasked why her arm came down, she said it got so heavy\nthat she could not keep it up any longer.\niGurney, Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., p. 309.\n\f54 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nOn another occasion, at 3.50 p.m., I told her in hypnosis\nto put her left arm up in fifteen minutes. At 3.56 I told\nher to put her right arm up in nine minutes. Soon afterwards\nshe was awakened. Her left arm went up at 4.4 (one\nminute too soon). A minute afterwards she laughed and\nsaid her right arm wanted to go up too. She raised it at\n4.5 exactly (right).\nI have carried out similar observations on several\nsomnambules with almost identical results. Some subjects,\nit is true, seem to be more accurate in their estimation\nof these short time-intervals than others ; but in every\ncase where I have made a series of observations I have\nfound the same tendency to slight errors, although on\nthe whole a remarkable accuracy in time estimation was\nexhibited.\nThe mean error varies with different subjects. In a series\nof thirty-one observations on F. D. in the estimation of periods\nvarying from one to fifteen minutes, the mean error was\n1'009 minutes. In fifteen observations on Mrs. C, with\nperiods varying from two to ten minutes the mean error was\n'78 minutes. In a series of sixty observations on various\nsubjects with periods varying from one minute to half an\nhour, the mean error was -\n89 minutes.\nOne very curious result to be noted in these experiments\nis the apparent limitation of the amount of error, no matter\nwhat the suggested time-interval may be. An error of one\nminute seems as likely to be made when the suggestion is\nfor fifteen minutes as when it is for three minutes. We\nmight have supposed that a subject who has just performed\nat the end of two minutes an act suggested to be performed\nin three minutes, would be likely to perform in ten minutes\nan act suggested to be performed in fifteen minutes. But\nit is not so. The most likely time for the fifteen minute\nsuggestion to be fulfilled is in fourteen, fifteen or sixteen\nminutes. The maximum error met with was one of six\nminutes in a time estimation of eighteen minutes ; but this\noccurred in one of a complicated series in which four\nsuggestions were running concurrently. In the great majority\nof cases, in the estimation of periods up to half an hour, the\nmaximum error was not more than one or two minutes. In\n\fLi v.] The Appreciation of Time by Sornnambules. 55\nthirty per cent, of the trials on all subjects, the time-interval\nwas accurately determined.\nIn experiments of this description it would seem that\nthere is an actual watching of the minutes as they pass, just\nas in Gurney's original experiments there was a watching\nof the days. But since minutes are purely artificial divisions\nof time and have not for us the concrete character which\ndays have, the way in which this watching is done needs\nsome explanation. It is comparatively easy to understand\nhow a subconscious intelligence may watch the passage of\ndays and count them as they pass ; but it is by no means\neasy to understand how this same intelligence, unaided by\nany artificial mechanism such as a clock, can accurately\nsubdivide \" time's continuous flow \" into periods which corre-\nspond to a given number of minutes.\nWe know nothing of time apart from sensible experience.\nTime as a psychological datum is but a quality of our\nsensations and our feelings. Empty time is an abstraction\nof the metaphysician, and except in a relative sense is\nunknown to the psychologist : time perceived is always filled.\nWe perceive a sensible present which has duration. Pre-\nsentations increasing in complexity give us a feeling of a\nfuture which is coming towards us ;\npresentations diminishing\nin complexity give us a feeling of a past which is receding\nbehind us ; and the relatively unchanging complexity of the\n\" now \" of experience gives us a feeling of \" the specious\npresent \" which forms our sole distinct intuition of time.\n1\nAll cognition of time apart from the directly experienced\n\" now \" is conceptual and has to be represented symbolically.\nBut judged by a \" standard time,\" the specious present of\ndifferent individuals seems to vary in its duration ; and in\nany particular individual this duration seems to vary at\ndifferent times. The symbolic conception of a period of time\nattained by summing up the \" nows \" of so-called empty time,\nor by counting the sensory changes experienced in filled time,\nwould thus lack all utility in thought and all validity in\npractice were there not some changes, referable to the\nexternal world and habitually experienced by all human\nbeings, which may be utilised as a standard of measurement.\n1\nCf. H. R. Marshall: \"The Time Quality,\" Mind, Jan. 1907, p. 1.\n\f56 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nFor practical purposes the mean solar day is so used, and\nby mechanical contrivances this period of time is subdivided\ninto hours, minutes, and seconds. But until clocks are con-\nstructed these subdivisions of time are not given in experience,\nand there is no necessary correlation between the \" now\n\"\nof experience and the second of the mean solar day.\nHours, minutes, and seconds are thus artificial devices for\nmeasuring the number of sensory changes experienced in\nsuccession. The passage of five, ten, or twenty minutes has\nno meaning apart from such sensory changes ; for awareness\nof change is a necessary condition of the perception of\ntime.\nThe manifestations of consciousness as we know it empirically\nare conditioned by its cerebral substratum, and the number of\nsuccessive impressions that can be apperceived in a given\ntime is limited by the rate at which certain physico-chemical\nchanges can take place in nervous tissue. If consciousness\nwere independent of any material substratum we have no\nreason to suppose that any such limitation would obtain in\nregard to the number of presentations or representations that\nwould be possible in a given time. For such a consciousness\nthe measure of time would be altered, and the phenomenal\nworld would be transformed.\nCertain philosophers believe that the normal self-consciousness\ndoes not exhaust its object\u2014the Ego, and that there is in\nman besides the empirical consciousness with its physiological\nmeasure of time, also a transcendental consciousness with\nanother measure of time peculiar to itself. This transcendental\nconsciousness is supposed to emerge when the empirical is\nset to rest, and its measure of time is said to be a\ncharacteristic incident of dreams. The condensation of re-\npresentations in certain dreams is accounted for by supposing\nthat the dream-consciousness is not fettered by any physical\nsubstratum, and that its measure of time is therefore not\nphysiological but transcendental. A consciousness with such\na measure of time in its highest degree would see time, as\nLuther said, not lengthwise but crosswise ; all would be in\na heap before it.\nI refer to these matters merely in order to point out that\nwhen we meet with some form of consciousness which can\n\fLiv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 57\naccurately determine the passage of five, ten, or twenty\nminutes without any apparent guidance through the ordinary\nchannels of sense, however much we may feel tempted to\npostulate some transcendental faculty in explanation of the\nphenomenon, we may rest assured that we are dealing with\na consciousness whose mode of cognising time differs not\nat all from that of the consciousness which we know\nempirically.\nIn seeking an explanation of the time-appreciation of\nsomnambules we seem bound to look to the methods used\nwhen similar judgments are made by the ordinary waking\nconsciousness. If in the waking state we are denied all\nordinary means of marking the passage of time we can still\nmake judgments, less or more accurate, as to the length\nof any given interval. If we sit with our eyes closed and\ntry to determine when five minutes have elapsed, we may\narrive at a very close approximation to the proper interval\nif we set ourselves deliberately to count. We have ingrained\nwithin us a sense of rhythm, based upon memories of certain\nsensory experiences, which enables us to revive fairly accurately\nthe time-intervals in the swing of a second pendulum. By\nsumming up three hundred such imaginary pendulum beats\nwe may, if we keep the rhythm true, judge very accurately\nwhen five minutes have elapsed. Even if our minds are\noccupied in some other way and we do not attempt to\ncount, we may still make a guess as to when the time is\nup. Such guesses, however, are very liable to gross error,\nand it seems evident that the accurate appreciation of time-\nintervals by somnambules cannot be accounted for on any\nhypothesis of mere guessing.\nApart from rhythmic counting, when cut off from all changing\nsensory impressions derived from the outer world, we seem\nto have no faculty for judging accurately of the passage of\ntime. Yet a somnambule in the hypnotic trance, deprived of\nall such sense-impressions, and, so far as his hypnotic conscious-\nness is aware, not deliberately counting or making any effort\nto note the passage of time, makes such judgments with an\naccuracy which precludes the possibility that they are the\nresult of mere guessing. If we believe that the accurate time-\nestimates of somnambules during the trance are the result of\n\f58 T. W. Mitchell, M.D. [part\nsome form of conscious counting, the want of knowledge during\nhypnosis as to how it is done forces us to suppose that the\nprocess must be carried on below the threshold of hypnotic\nconsciousness, or by some fragmentary portion of this conscious-\nness temporarily dissociated from the hypnotic stratum as a\nwhole ; and a similar supposition must be made with reference\nto the equally accurate time-appreciation which takes place\nsubconsciously, in response to suggestion, during the waking\nstate. Further, if such a form of subconscious counting takes\nplace, it is not necessary to suppose that it is a counting of\nsome imaginary rhythm. For it seems probable that the lower\nstrata of consciousness can take cognisance of various organic\nprocesses which are, or may be, unperceived or generally\nunattended to by the waking self. And if a correlation has\nbeen subconsciously established between such phases of organic\nlife and our artificial divisions of time, the subconscious watcher\nis provided with an objective time-measurer which is liable\nto only slight variations of regularity. Such variations as\nnormally take place in the rate of the heart-beat or of respira-\ntory movement, are just such as would account for the\ninaccuracies exhibited by somnambules in their estimates of\nshort periods. In longer periods of true time-watching the\norganic rhythm will usually average its normal rate, and con-\nsequently the amount of error in the time-estimates of the\nsubject is not likely to be greater for half an hour than for\nfive minutes.\nWhile some such explanation seems necessary to account\nfor the accurate appreciation of short time-intervals, there is\nanother possibility which must be taken into consideration in\nregard to the fulfilment of post-hypnotic acts at a particular\nmoment which has been previously determined by subconscious\ncalculation. That possibility is that these somnambules may\nhave the power, exhibited sometimes by individuals who have\nnever been hypnotised, of knowing the time of day, intuitively as\nit were, without any conscious or subconscious perception of\nsuch sensory impressions as normally give us this information.\nI have frequently tested F. D. on this point, and have found\nher to be extremely accurate in her estimates. And it is a\ncurious fact that this power, never manifested by her previously,\nbecame greatly developed during the course of the experiments\n;\n\fliv.] The Appreciation of Time by Somnambules. 59\nso that she often astonished her friends by her accurate telling of\nthe time under circumstances which seemed to preclude such\nknowledge as she showed. When tested during hypnosis she\nwas almost invariably absolutely correct when a suggestion of\nclairvoyance with regard to the kitchen clock was given. The\nfollowing extract from my notes will serve as an example.\nOn April 18th, 1906, I asked her in the waking state\nwhat time she thought it was. She said 11.30. I told her I\nthought she was rather slow. In hypnosis she said she thought\nit was 11.40. I then suggested that she should see the kitchen\nclock and tell the exact time by it. She said she could not\nsee it. I told her to sleep deeply and she would see it clearly.\n\" Can you see it ?\n\" \" Yes.\" \" Well, what time is it ?\n\"\n\"About 12 o'clock.\" \"Tell me more exactly.\" \"I can't\nsee the hands properly.\" \" Look steadily and you will see.\nWhat is it ?\n\" \" Five minutes to twelve.\" I then woke\nher up, and went into the kitchen with her and looked at\nthe clock. It was a very small American clock, about three\ninches high. The hands pointed to four minutes to twelve.\nI do not pretend that this was really clairvoyance. The\nfew attempts I have made in other directions to test this power,\nso firmly believed in by the early mesmerists, have been almost\nentirely negative. Yet when confronted by such difficulties as\nmeet us in trying to explain the peculiar gifts so commonly\nexhibited by hypnotic somnambules, or the less common\nmanifestation of similar powers by persons who have never\nbeen hypnotised, we are bound to neglect no evidence, which\nhas been testified to by credible and careful observers, that\nmay possibly throw any light, however dim, upon these obscure\nregions of psychological research. And whether we hold fast\nto the accepted conclusions of orthodox science, or allow our-\nselves to stray into the vaguer regions of transcendental\nspeculation, in the present state of knowledge the difficulties\nto be met with in connection with the appreciation of time by\nsomnambules are of such a nature as inevitably to entail,\non any hypothesis, a considerable residuum of unexplained\nphenomena.\n\f60 Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden. [part\nii.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.\nBy Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden.\nThe first series of these experiments, which were carried on\nduring October and November, 1905, were reported in the\nJournal S.P.R, for March, 1906. The second series were\ndescribed at a meeting of the Society on March 25th, 1907.\nMiss Miles writes in regard to them :\nShortly after I began these experiments with Miss Ramsden, I\ntold Professor Barrett about them, and I have profited largely by\nhis advice in carrying them on, and especially in the method of\nrecording them.\nI made Professor Barrett's acquaintance a few years ago, in con-\nsequence of some articles about my experiments in dowsing which\nwere published in Country Life and other periodicals, giving an\naccount of various places where I had found water. Since then I have\ntried a number of experiments for him,\u2014especially in dowsing and\nin various phases of clairvoyance, such as finding hidden coins, etc.,\n\u2014\nand have learnt from him to make them of use to outsiders by\nrecording them fully at the time and obtaining on the spot whatever\nconfirmatory testimony was available. In fact, whatever scientific value\nattaches to the results of all my experiments is, I feel, entirety owing\nto his constant help and guidance. In the second series Miss Ramsden\nsent copies of many of the postcards recording her impressions to\nProfessor Barrett at the same time as to me, so as to make the\nevidence as complete as possible.\nFIRST SERIES.\nMiss Ramsden having met with a certain amount of success\nin experiments in thought-transference with two other friends\nof hers, asked Miss Miles to try a systematic series with her.\n\fliv.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 61\nIt was then arranged that Miss Miles, living at 59 Egerton\nGardens, London, S.W., should play the part of agent, while\nMiss Eamsden, at her home, Bulstrode, Gerrard's Cross,\nBuckinghamshire (about 20 miles from London), acted as\npercipient, the times of the experiments being fixed by pre-\narrangement.\nMiss Miles noted at the time of each experiment, in a\nbook kept for the purpose, the idea or image which she\nwished to convey, while Miss Eamsden wrote down each day\nthe impressions that had come into her mind, and sent the\nrecord to Miss Miles before knowing what she had attempted\non her side. Miss Miles then pasted this record into her\nbook opposite her own notes, and in some cases added a\nfurther note explanatory of her circumstances at the time to\nwhich it will be seen that Miss Bamsden's impressions often\ncorresponded. Whenever it was possible, Miss Miles obtained\nconfirmatory evidence from other persons as to the circum-\nstances that had not been noted at the time, and the corro-\nboration of these persons was written in her book and is\nprinted below.

I looked\nfor the women watching at the foot of the cross, and was surprised\nthat I could not see them. This is curious, because I distinctly\nsaw a figure on the cross, which was purely the result of my own\nimagination. The rays of the sun and the cross itself appeared for\nan instant to be luminous.

In\nthese practically no success was obtained, owing, Miss Miles\nthought, to her having gone on too long without a break. It\nwas therefore decided that the experiments should be dropped\nfor a time, and they were resumed later in the year.\nSECOND SERIES.\n[Editorial Note.\u2014Throughout this second series, which lasted\nfor about a month, from October 19th to November 14th,\n1906, inclusive, Miss Miles was again agent and Miss\nRamsden percipient. Miss Miles was staying first near Bristol\nand afterwards near Malmesbury, Wiltshire. Miss Ramsden\nwas living all the time near Kingussie, Inverness-shire, a\ndistance of about 400 miles, as the crow flies, from Bristol.\nDuring the last three days of the experiments Miss Miles,\nunknown to Miss Ramsden, was in London.\nThe general plan of action was that Miss Ramsden should\nthink of Miss Miles regularly at 7 p.m. on every day that\nan experiment was to be tried, and write down her impressions\n\fLiv.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 71\non a post card or letter card, which was posted almost always\non the next morning to Miss Miles. These post cards or\nletter cards were kept by Miss Miles and pasted into her\nnote book, so that the postmarks on them show the time of\ndespatch.\nMiss Miles on her side had no fixed time for thinking of\nMiss Eamsden, but thought of her more or less during the\nwhole day and in the evening noted briefly what ideas had\nbeen most prominently before her mind during the day and\nwhich she wished to convey, or thought might have been\nconveyed, to Miss Eamsden. These notes were made generally\non a post card, which was, as a rule, posted to Miss Eamsden\nnext day. The post cards were afterwards returned to Miss\nMiles to be placed with her records, so that here also the\npostmarks show the date of despatch of the information to\nMiss Eamsden.\nOut of a total of 15 days' experiments, the idea that Miss\nMiles was attempting to convey, as recorded on her post cards,\nappeared on six occasions in a complete or partial form\namong Miss Eamsden's impressions on the same date. But\nit also happened that almost every day some of Miss\nEamsden's impressions represented pretty closely something\nthat Miss Miles had been seeing or talking about on the same\nday. In other words, while the agent only succeeded occasion-\nally in transferring the ideas deliberately chosen by her for\nthe purpose, the percipient seemed often to have some sort of\nsupernormal knowledge of her friend's surroundings, irrespective\nof what that friend had specially wished her to see.\nWhen this happened, Miss Miles at once made careful notes\nof the event or topic to which Miss Eamsden's statement\nseemed to refer and also obtained corroborations from her\nfriends on the spot. Further, when Miss Eamsden gave\ndescriptions of scenes which seemed to Miss Miles like the\nplaces where she was staying, she got picture post cards of\nthem, or photographed them, to show how far the descriptions\nreally corresponded.\nThe value of these results of course depends on the amount\nof Miss Eamsden's knowledge or ignorance of Miss Miles's\ndoings and surroundings. Miss Miles was staying in the\nneighbourhood of her own old home and was well acquainted\n\f72 Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden. [part\nwith the country and the people, and greatly interested in\nrevisiting them. Miss Ramsden knew that Miss Miles was\nstaying in a country house,\u2014 Blaise Castle, Henbury, near\nBristol, \u2014but she had never been in that part of England\nherself and did not know any of Miss Miles's friends there.\nShe did not even know the name of the owner of Blaise\nCastle. She had first made Miss Miles's acquaintance when\nthe latter came to Woodhill, Gerrard's Cross, where she lived\nfrom 1895-1897, this being close to the home of Miss\nBamsden's family. Further details as to her knowledge or\nignorance of particular circumstances are given in the report\nof the experiments.\nIt has further to be considered how many of the successes\nmight be mere guesses,\u2014whose correctness was due to chance\nand not to telepathy. Miss Bamsden generally had a good\nmany impressions every time, and of course the more numerous\nher impressions were, the more probable was it that one of\nthem would coincide by chance, with the idea named on the\npost card by Miss Miles. Further, if we are allowed to\ncount as a success a case where one of Miss Bamsden's\nimpressions corresponded with one of the ideas which had\nbeen prominently in Miss Miles's mind during the day,\nthough not named on the post card, the probability of\na chance coincidence is still greater. No exact calculation\nof the probability, however, can be made, because almost\nall the data for it are unknown. We cannot even count\nthe number of Miss Bamsden's recorded impressions, since\nit is a matter of opinion and not of fact what constitutes\na single impression. E.g. ought we to count Bishoj) and\nArchbishop in Experiment II. as one or two ? Some im-\npressions, again, are much more complicated than others, but\nit would be impossible to say how many factors of equal\nvalue they contain.\nStill less is it possible to count the number of ideas in\nMiss Miles's mind to which some of Miss Bamsden's\nimpressions might correspond. In Miss Bamsden's case we\nare at least limited to the impressions she recorded, whereas\nin Miss Miles's case we have to include not only the ideas\nshe noted down beforehand, but also an indefinite number\nof unrecorded scenes and topics.\n\fExperiments in Thought-Transference. 73\nFurther, Miss Bamsden could not avoid knowing something\nof the general character of Miss Miles's surroundings, viz.\nthat she was staying in country-houses in the West of\nEngland, and this must inevitably have guided her impressions\ninto certain general channels, or at least diverted them from\nothers. Some ideas must therefore have been more likely\nthan others to occur to her, but we cannot tell at all how\nmuch more likely.\nIt is clear, therefore, that there can be no mathematical\nproof that the correctness of Miss Eamsden's impressions\namounted to more than chance might have brought about,\nand that on this fundamental point nothing more than a\nrough empirical judgment can be formed. After studying\nall the records, however, it appears to us that while some\nof the coincidences of thought between the two experimenters\nare probably accidental, the total amount of correspondence\nis more than can be thus accounted for and points distinctly\nto the action of telepathy between them.\nThe reader should note that all the experiments are here\ngiven in full, not a mere selection of the more or less successful\nones. In the few cases where any part of Miss Eamsden's\ndescription is omitted, this is indicated by marks of omission,\nthus, . . .\n.]\nPiECOKD OF THE SECOND SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS.\nOctober 19th to November Itth, 1906.\nThe items of this record are arranged in the same order\nas in the first series, namely\n:\n(a) Miss Miles's record, made before hearing from Miss\nKamsden, of what she wished or expected Miss Eamsden to\nperceive.\n(b) Miss Eamsden's record of her impressions, made before\nhearing from Miss Miles what the latter's intentions had\nbeen.\n(c) Comments by Miss Miles, after receiving Miss Eamsden's\nrecord, as to its correctness.\n(cl) Corroborations by Miss Miles's friends as to circumstances\nknown to them.\n\f74 Clarissa Miles and Hermione Ramsden.

[part\nMiss Kamsden, commenting on the whole series of experi-\nments, writes\n:\nI should like to point out the importance of getting more people\nto take part in these experiments, because it is only by comparing\na large number of experiments that we can hope to find out how\nthoughts are transferred. Sometimes they seem to come as ideas,\nat other times as words, and more often than not, their real\nmeaning is not transferred at all. I was much interested in\nreading Mrs. Verrall's account of her attempt to get at a Greek\nsentence which her husband had tried to transfer to her tele-\npathically and without her knowledge. (See Proceedings S.P.R.,\nVol. XX., pp. 156-167.) The manner in which the sentence was\ntransferred in fragments, first in ideas, and then in words bearing\na certain similarity in sound, is very like some of my experiences,\nas, for instance, the occasion when the idea of a Bishop was\nconveyed by an apparently nonsensical word, \"latme,\" which in\nits turn suggested \" Bishop Latimer.\"\nThere is another point which I do not remember to have heard\ndiscussed, and that is the influence of suggestion as an aid to the\ndevelopment of psychic faculties. I have found it very effective\nin my own case. I am not a good visualizer, and although I\nsometimes see visions in the same way as one sees the so-called\n\"hypnagogic illusions,\" which most of us have experienced, though\nperhaps rarel}', in the moments between sleeping and waking, I\nam not able to visualize at will, nor can I see in a crystal. Blaise\nCastle appeared to me after the manner of a hypnagogic illusion ;\nit was a perfect picture in colour, in fact it was the place itself\n\u2014\nso it seemed to me\u2014though I did not know that it was Blaise\nCastle, as I had imagined the latter to be a real old castle with\nturrets.\nInstead of trying to visualize scenes, I tried to see them with\n\"the mind's eye,\" as one recalls a familiar scene;\u2014in this way\nI was able to describe the garden at Blaise Castle with the bridge\nand the steps, which I compared to \" a Japanese landscape.\"\nSome of the other scenes were actually visualized, but in a very\nfragmentary way : I mean that I did not see the whole landscape,\nbut only the \" upper windows in a thatched cottage \" at Henbury,\nand the mullion windows lighted by electric light at Burtonhill.\nOne fact which is rather puzzling is that the most vivid\nimpressions are not always the most correct ; and it has often\nhappened that those which are the most surprisingly correct are\n\fliv.] Experiments in Thought-Transference. 93\nsome which were not intentionally transferred at all.

Still one fact is worth noting: that three\ntimes in the course of the same week I heard a distinct voice\n;\nthe first time it was a recognised voice, the two other times it\nwas a \"soundless voice,\" like a whisper, yet unlike anything I\never heard before, because although it sounded so clear and\ndistinct, yet I was perfectly aware that it was purely subjective,\nand that if any one else had been in the room, they would not\nhave heard it. On all three occasions I received quite long\nsentences ;\nindeed, on the second occasion it was as long as\na letter, the voice dying away and becoming inaudible, and then\nstarting afresh.

[PAKT\nTIL\nREPORT ON SOME RECENT SITTINGS FOR PHYSICAL\nPHENOMENA IN AMERICA.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nIntroduction.\nAt a meeting of the Society held two or three years ago,\nDr. J. H. Gower, a member of the Society, described some\nremarkable physical phenomena which he had witnessed in a\nprivate circle composed entirely of his own friends, with no\nprofessional or regular medium among them. These sittings\nhad been carried on at intervals for several years, from 1902\nonwards, in a large town in one of the Western States of\nAmerica. The most interesting results obtained were the\noccasional movements of a heavy table, untouched by any of\nthe sitters, and in a good light.\nThese more striking phenomena, however, happened only very\nrarely ; that is, not more than about half-a-dozen times in the\ncourse of four or five years. As a rule, the table moved\nonly when the hands of the sitters were resting on it ; but\nraps\u2014both with and without contact\u2014are reported to have\nbeen heard very frequently.\nIntelligible sentences were also spelt out through raps ; the\nfirst ones purported to come from a friend of Dr. Gower's,\nT. W., who had recently died ; and most of them were said\nto be both correct and characteristic, but gave practically no\ninformation that was not known to the sitters. Later, other\n\" controls \" appeared, giving messages as to their names, place\nof death, etc. These, as far as they could be verified at all,\nturned out to be entirely wrong. Consequently, some of the\n\flit.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 95\nsitters, who had been at first inclined to attribute all the\nphenomena to the action of spirits, renounced this explanation\nalmost entirely ; but none of them, I believe, has ever wavered\nin his conviction that the tables have on several occasions\nmoved without being touched.\nWe tried a series of sittings with Dr. Gower in the S.P.B.\nrooms, but no results were obtained, except very slight ones\non one occasion with a lady who was unwilling to try further\nexperiments. Dr. Gower was, however, very anxious to do\nall in his power to provide us with evidence that should be\nsatisfactory to the Society and, in consequence of his invita-\ntion to me to take part in his friends' sittings, I went to\nAmerica in August, 1906, and spent nearly a month in the\ntown where they live, being enabled to do so by the generosity\nof a member of the Society, who made an anonymous gift to\nits funds for the purposes of this and another investigation.\nThe phenomena I witnessed were, I was told, about up to the\naverage of what the sitters were accustomed to, but there were\nno decided movements without contact. It has been thought\ndesirable, nevertheless, that these sittings should be reported\nto the Society ; and in order that the reader may have all\nthe material available for judging of the whole case, I propose\nto give first as complete an account as possible of the earlier\nsittings, which were unfortunately reported in a very meagre\nmanner.\nI. History of the Early Sittings.\nDr. Gower, to whom we are indebted for all the evidence\nin regard to these early sittings, was originally a musician\nby profession, holding the Oxford degree of Mus. Doc, but\nhas now been for some years engaged in mining, and lives\npart of the year in England and part in America. He has\nbeen keenly interested in the subject of spiritualism for some\ntwenty years, has a wide knowledge of professional mediums\nand mecliumship in England and America, and is also a good\namateur conjurer. During all the years that he has studied\nthe subject, he has\u2014so he tells me\u2014rarely, if ever, met\nwith any phenomena that appeared to him genuine, except\namong his friends in this town, but he is still indefatigable in\nhis search for evidence.\n\f96 Alice Johnson. [part\nSome particulars of the early sittings were given briefly in\nthe following letters from Dr. Gower to Dr. Hodgson :\nMay 17th, 1903.\nLast winter in some friends and I, partly anticipating\nsome amusement, and perhaps some experiences, tried our luck at\n\" table turning.\"\nThe results were so astounding that I venture to write to you on\nthe subject. My friends were a prominent physician, his wife and\ntwo daughters.\nWe sat around a heavy oak table ; our hands, joined by touching\nthe little fingers, were placed lightly upon the top of the table.\nUnder these conditions, rappings, movements of the table, and\nintelligent answers to questions happened frequently ; but of these\nI need say no more. After a time the phenomena were so pro-\nnounced that we decided to raise our hands off the table, and\nwere much astonished to find that the demonstrations continued. . . .\nFinally, we stood around the table (with our hands joined) at a\ndistance of about two feet. The table still moved, and the rappings\nwere as loud as before. This occurred on possibly a dozen occasions.\nMore than once I slipped my finger between the leaves of a closed\nbook or magazine, and the table (?) was able to see what letters\nof the alphabet my fingers covered, indicating these by means of\n\" raps.\" On most occasions this intelligent force, for intelligent it\nwas, purported to be directed by a friend of mine who has been\ndead for about six years, 1\nand some evidence of his identity was\nforthcoming.\nIt is needless to say that trickery of any kind was out of the\nquestion, the phenomena being frequently witnessed by several\ndisinterested, sceptical, and even antagonistic friends.\nJohn H. Gower.\nJune -2nd, 1903.\nSince my arrival in we have renewed our sittings, but\nthe introduction of other parties has, I think, somewhat modified\nthe results. However, rappings on the table and movements without\ncontact occurred on three occasions out of four sittings. On the\nother occasion nothing unusual happened. Indeed, the sitting was\na complete failure. On one occasion, after our seance, and indeed\nafter we had partaken of refreshments which had been placed upon\nthe table, and whilst it was fairly covered with plates, dishes\n1\nThis was the \"control,\" T. W., referred to above.\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 97\netc., the table made a series of movements entirely unassisted by\nany visible agent. ... I will endeavour to have independent records\nmade of our next meetings, and also get my friends to write down\nwhat they have themselves observed. However, we are absolutely\nagreed as to main facts. . . .\nNovember 23rd, 1903.\nSince I arrived here we have had three sittings, one of which\nresulted in nothing. It is not easy to make a contemporaneous\nrecord of all that takes place. However, I made the attempt, but\nthe communications were somewhat indefinite, and were obtained\npartly by answers to leading questions. I hope next time to have\na stenographer present.\nAt two of the sittings the following phenomena were observed\nmany times :\n(1) Movements of the heavy oak table without any contact of the\ntable with the sitters.\n(2) Raps occurring on the table in answer to questions when the\nconditions as to the sitters were as in No. 1.\n(3) The rolling backwards and forwards of a pencil which I had\nplaced upon the table, and which I had requested should be moved\nby the invisible agent\u2014(none of the sitters, of course, touching the\ntable at the time).\nOne of these sittings was described in detail by one of the\nprincipal sitters, the physician referred to in Dr. Gower's first\nletter (spoken of in this paper as Dr. Williams), as follows\n:\n[Monday], December 7, 1903.\nMy dear Dr. Gower,\nIn response to your request that I should write out a\ndescription of the occurrence as I noticed it at Mrs. B.'s house\nlast Thursday evening [December 3rd, 1903], I will make the follow-\ning statement\n:\nAccording to invitation, my wife and I arrived at Mrs. B.'s house\nabout nine o'clock. We found sitting at a round dining table\nyourself, Mr. J. T., your cousin Mrs. W., Mrs. B., her mother\n(Mrs. W.)}\nand her young sister aged about fifteen years. In the\nparty there were no avowed Spiritualists, and no one present who\ntook the matter very seriously except yourself. The room was a\nsmall one, say 11 x 14 feet. The table was an ordinary small round\nextension table on a central pedestal, which divided on making\nextension. The meeting was essentially social, and I do not believe\nG\n\f98 Alice Johnson. [part\nthat any one present would in any way attempt any deception\nupon the others, or in any way do any trickery or any underhand\nwork of any kind. My wife and I joined you at the table, and\nfor some hour and a half we had various knockings, although nothing\nvery intelligible and distinct in this line ; and the table moved in\nvarious ways about the room, the lights being turned down. As\nthe table moved in some directions it was frequently separated at\nthe line of union and would close again. During almost all of this\ntime the lights were turned low, and it was impossible to distinguish\ndetails of individual movement. Occasionally our hands were taken\noff the table, and I believe that the table moved several times\nwithout any one being in contact with it. Mrs. B., as well as\nyourself, being a professional musician, the lights were occasionally\nturned on, and music was interspersed during the evening.\nAbout eleven o'clock refreshments were served, during which Mr. B.\nreturned, he also being a professional musician. As we sat round\nthe table in the full strong light, we had various table movings\nand knockings. Later, as we all sat encircling it, we all drew\nback a short distance from it, so that no one could, even had they\ndesired, [have] touched the pedestal or the table itself without being\nplainly seen, and the table was requested to open as it had done\nbefore. This it immediately slowly did, until the central space\nwas about eight inches wide ; with no one touching it, it was at\nonce requested to close again, which it immediately began to do in\na jerky, weakening way, the strength seeming to fail at last, when\nit was about half closed. After waiting a few moments we placed\nour fingers upon the edge of it and requested it to close com-\npletely, which it did ; the whole opening and shutting occupying\nthe space of twelve or fifteen minutes, I should estimate. This\nwas the most striking phenomenon that we witnessed during the\nevening.\nI may further state that at various times during the last year or\nso, with about the same party present, I have on a few occasions\nseen the table about which we sat, make short, quick movements\nwhen I was satisfied that none of the party were in contact with\nit in any way, and I have repeatedly heard distinct knockings upon\nthe table ; sometimes apparently intelligent answers to questions,\nsuch as giving a distinct number of knocks as requested, and the\nthree knocks or the one knock for yes or no when the lights were\nturned on fully, and I believed that there was no contact by any\none in the room, either directly or indirectly. I have no explanation\n\fLIV.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 99\nwhatever to make for these phenomena. They appear to be produced\nby an intelligence absolutely free from the direct physical influence\nof any one present.\nDr. Gower afterwards obtained for me an account written\nby Mrs. B., the lady in whose house this sitting was held, as\nfollows. The account was enclosed in a letter from Dr. Gower,\ndated December 11th, 1904.\nI have often heard of various demonstrations of psychical pheno-\nmena, but until last winter had never seen anything of the kind\nmyself. My first experience was at the house of Dr. W., a prominent\nphysician. Others in the circle were all well known to me>\nand I am sure that there could have been no trickery of any kind\nused. During the evening we had answers to several questions\ngiven us, using the alphabet, and requesting a tap to be given on\nthe table at the proper letter as it was named. We also saw the\ntable move perceptibly without contact.\nAt my own house, some weeks following, we met again. We\nsat in the dining room around a very heavy round dining table.\nThis table is usually clamped to prevent its opening, but the clamp\nhad been broken in moving. The table opens and closes with\ndifficulty, and we generally require the assistance of a second\nperson when opening it. During the early part of the evening the\ntable moved through the double doors until it caught under the\nedge of the parlour rug and could go no further. We set it back\ninto the dining room again and stopped for a while. After we had\nhad some light refreshment we left the table set as it was, covered\nwith dishes, glasses, decanters, etc., and with two gas jets turned\nup as high as they would go, sat around the table again. The\ntable opened slowly, and with no jerking whatever, just as smoothly\nas if it had been oiled, and after that opened and closed as we\ndirected, moved toward any person in the room whom we named.\nAll this time we stood and sat around it at a distance of about\ntwo to three feet, and no one touched it either with his feet or\nhis hands.\nThe following general corroborative statement by some of\nthe other sitters, whose names are given in full in the original\ndocument (now in my possession), was sent to Dr. Hodgson\n:\nDec. 1th, 1903.\nWe, the undersigned, have witnessed the following phenomena\nat experimental circles held at various times during the present year,\n\f100 .

W., (Nos. 1, 2, and 3, without\nphysical contact above the table top).\nI made Dr. Gower's acquaintance in January, 1904, and\nhe gave me in conversation many details of the sittings\nheld previously to that date. On one occasion, he told me,\nthe sitters requested that various liquids on the table should\nbe shaken by the force ; for instance, the water in a water\njug and whiskey in a bottle. Each of these shook successively\nin accordance with the requests, without being touched in any\nway by the sitters, and the table being motionless at the time.\nHe gives the following general account of the phenomena\nin a letter to me\n:\nNORTHINGTON, MULGRAVE ROAD, SUTTON, SURREY,\nMarch Uth, 1904.\nIt is without the slightest hesitation that I subscribe my name\nto the following statement, as there never has existed a doubt in\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 101\nmy mind as to the facts witnessed on so many occasions, not only\nby myself but by many others. . . .\nThe sittings were held in 1902 and 1903. The majority of them\nwere held in the house of [Dr. W.], but the same phenomena as\nseen here were witnessed in several other houses and also in my\nprivate room in the Hotel.\nThe phenomena to which I refer may be briefly stated as\nfollows\n:\n(1) Movements of both heavy and light tables without any\ncontact whatever with any of the sitters.\n(2) Eaps made upon the tables when no one was touching them.\nThese raps occurred usually as signals in giving answers to\nquestions put by the sitters.\n(3) Movements of various articles which happened to be at the\ntime upon the tables and in response to requests that such\nmovements should be made (no one touching the tables).\n(4) Information by means of raps. The information obtained was\nsometimes known and sometimes unknown by any of the sitters.\n(With and without contact).\n(5) Information given in the same way which was not only\nunknown but unobtainable by any one present.\nThe names and addresses of the principal witnesses were\ngiven in this letter.\nDr. Gower returned to America soon after this, but paid\nanother short visit to England during November and December\nof the same year. Mr. Feilding and I then arranged for\nsome sittings with him, as he was as anxious as we were to\nestablish the facts of the case. At the first sitting, held on\nNovember 17th, 1904, at the S.P.E. Booms at 20 Hanover\nSquare, raps were heard on the table on which the sitters'\nhands were placed, and these raps answered questions. More\nthan once (as recorded in my notes made the next day) the\nsitters lifted their hands from the table, keeping them linked\nat a level of three or four inches above its surface, and raps\nwere obtained under these circumstances. On several occasions\nraps were heard from the direction of the door, variously\ninterpreted by different sitters as on a small table near two\nof them, on a revolving bookcase, or on the glass of a picture,\nor of the Globe-Wernicke bookcases, which are against one\nof the walls near the door and several feet distant from the\n\f102 Alice Johnson. [part\ntable round which we were sitting. Eaps were also heard\non the chair of one of the sitters, a lady known to be\npossessed of mediumistic powers. It seemed possible then\nthat some of these raps had been produced without contact,\nbut the conditions were obviously inconclusive.\n-At the two next sittings, nothing occurred.\nThe fourth was held in a private house in London, where\nagain the lady just referred to was present. Eaps were\nagain obtained freely\u2014a few apparently without contact\n\u2014\nand again on this lady's chair. The hypothesis occurred to\nme at the time that all the raps were produced automatically\nand unconsciously by some of the sitters, who had perhaps\nunwittingly cultivated this power in themselves, as many\npersons cultivate the far more common automatism of table-\ntilting.\nThe lady with whom the raps appeared to be chiefly\nassociated objected, however, to any further investigation, and\nwe were only able to hold one more sitting\u2014again a blank\none\u2014at 20 Hanover Square, before Dr. Gower went back\nto America. On January 15th, 1905, he wrote to me\nenclosing reports of three sittings held in the early part of\nthat month since his return. The reports were made from\nnotes taken during the sittings by Professor H. (whose full\nname and address, as well as those of the other sitters,\nwere given) and Dr. Gower added :\n\" I think the tipping\nup, probably 20 times, of a heavy table, entirely untouched\nas far as one could see, one of the most wonderful things I\nhave ever seen, even in this connection.\" At the two first\nsittings raps were obtained both with and apparently without\ncontact of the sitters with the table, but movements of the\ntable only with contact. The report of the third sitting is\nas follows\n:\nStance No. 3. Reported from notes made at the time by Dr.\nGower.\nSitting commenced at nine o'clock, at the residence of Dr. W.\nPresent: Mrs. W., Mrs. B., Mrs. P., Miss F. W., Mr. E. P.,\nMr. J. T., and Dr. John H. Gower. The above named formed a\ncircle around a heavy oak library table, and placed their hands\nthereon.\nAbout 9.25 raps were heard, and in answer to questions the\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 103\nname \" Albert Shaw \" was rapped out. He had been dead nine\nyears, and was the same spirit who announced himself at the\nprevious sitting.\nQuestion : Can you rap on the table if we raise our hands 1\nAns. . . . Three raps (Yes.)\nIn answer to further questions it was said no message would be\ngiven, that he merely wished to give a demonstration of power.\nHands were raised off the table, and for some time various groups\nof raps were given as requested by the sitters. Hands again\nplaced on the table, which then moved frequently.\nAt about ten o'clock the sitting suspended and refreshments were\nserved, and at 10.30 the sitting was resumed, the table being fairly\nwell covered with dishes, plates, glasses, etc. Very loud raps were\nsoon given, and after about half-an-hour the table moved about\nthe room, sometimes with the hands of the sitters resting lightly\nupon it, and sometimes when none of them were touching it at\nall. During these occurrences Professor H. and Mr. B. joined the\nparty, and for the last half-hour of the seance the table moved\nabout the room in any direction the sitters requested that it should,\nentirely without contact. It moved into the hall, and back again\nthrough the middle of the room into the dining room, a distance\nof at least twenty feet. All this time the sitters were not touching\nit, but with joined hands followed said movements at a distance\nof about one foot from the table. Dr. Gower suggested that the\nsliding movement should cease, and that the table should be\nrequested to tilt. The table being a heavy one, and the dishes,\netc., still upon it, this of course required considerable force to\naccomplish, but the table tilted in response to the request of the\nobservers, probably a score of times, and at no time was contact\nwith any of the sitters visible.\nCopies of these reports having been forwarded at the same\ntime to Dr. Hodgson, he sent Dr. Gower a series of questions,\nto which Dr. Gower replied as follows\n:\n7th February, 1905.\nThe positions of the sitters' feet and knees during the movements\nof the table without contact cannot very well be seen, but as the\ncircle is made up of a few friends, I have no doubt as to their\ngood faith, and am quite convinced that there is no fraud or trickery\npractised by any of them.\nMoreover, some of the movements, such as the extension top\n\f104 Alice Johnson. [part\ntable opening, the liquids moving, and the rolling backwards and\nforwards of a pencil, could not have been caused by the feet or\nknees under any circumstances.\nThe table above referred to is supported only by a central\npedestal, which would be entirely out of reach. When these move-\nments are taking place we are standing around it (the table) with\njoined hands, probably about one foot from the table, and as the\nmovements occur we follow them, maintaining the same position.\nNothing is known of \" Albert Shaw,\" and the information given\nby \" raps \" is very meagre and indefinite. Indeed, \" he \" declines to\ngive messages, and confines \"himself\" to producing the movements\nand rappings.\nI may say that the rappings are usually as loud when the hands\nare off the table as they are when the hands are on. . . .\nDr. Gower having written to me on Dec. 23rd, 1904, to\nask that I would arrange some experiment as a test of possible\nclairvoyance on the part of the \" controls \" who purported to\nproduce the phenomena of the American sittings, Mr. Feilding\nand I arranged a \" test \" as follows : we took a pack of\ncards, shuffled them, and drew out three at random without\nlooking at them, wrapped each in a piece of paper and put\nit in an envelope, which was then marked and sealed. We\nthen drew three cards at random from the rest of the pack\nand looked at them. Each of these three was put into an\nenvelope, which was marked and sealed, and finally the remain-\nder of the pack was put into an envelope, which was also>\nmarked and sealed. Care was taken to keep all the cards\nface downwards all the time (except the three intentionally\nlooked at), and we did not even touch their faces, so that we\nmight avoid, as far as possible, any normal means of knowing\nwhich cards were in the first three envelopes. All seven\nenvelopes were then locked up together in the S.P.R. rooms,,\nno one knowing of the experiment except ourselves and Dr.\nGower, to whom we wrote an account of what we had done.\nIt will be seen that there were thus three cards entirely\nunknown to any one, so that if they were rightly guessed at\none of the sittings, the result would point to clairvoyance\n\u2014\nproperly so called\u2014on the part either of the sitters in America\nor of some external intelligence ; while there were also three\ncards known to Mr. Feilding and myself, so that if these\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 105\nwere guessed, the result might be attributed to telepathy from\none or both of us.\nAfter receiving our account of what test had been arranged,\nDr. Gower wrote :\nJanuary 2%th, 1905.\nMy friends and I think that you have provided us with an\nexcellent test. However, I feel some little concern about it, as we\nhad one sitting two evenings ago. There were present those of my\nfriends who usually have the best results, viz., Dr., Mrs. and Miss\nWilliams, and Mrs. B. and her mother. We sat with our hands\nupon the table and placed your letter on the centre of it.\nBut for the first time, I think, in our experience, we got absolutely\nnothing. Not even a \" rap \" or a movement of the table, of any\nkind whatever. The sitting lasted for two hours. Does it mean that\nthe \" spirits \" are disgusted with us for seeking for tests, or that\nthey failed from over-anxiety on their part and ours ?\nWe will try, however, several times, and I will report later.\nIt seems probable that this negative result was due to\ninhibition of the automatic impulses of the sitters through\nsuggestion, since at the sitting of January 1st, 1905, when\nthe \" control,\" T. W., was asked (before Dr. Gower knew the\nnature of our \" test \"),\n\" Could you read a word put in an\nenvelope in the room of the S.P.B. in London and com-\nmunicate it to us ?\n\" it answered (by raps) \" No.\"\nNevertheless, on March 25th, 1905, at a sitting held at\nthe house of Dr. Williams, and reported at the time by him,\nraps came on the table in front of Dr. Gower, having the\npeculiar flurried or duplicated characteristic which marked those\ngenerally ascribed to T. W. Dr. Gower then described the\nnature of the test, and asked the \" control \" if the cards could be\nseen by him and named to the sitters. The \" control \" expressed\nhis doubt of being able to succeed, but said he would try,\nand would report the result if the same party would sit in\nthe same way on the following Wednesday evening, March\n29th. On this evening they accordingly re-assembled, and\nwere informed through the raps that the three cards were\n:\nAce of Spades, Queen of Hearts, and 2 of Spades. At this\nsitting it was noteworthy that no raps were heard except in\nanswer to the questions about the experiment, nor did any\nmovements of the table, with or without contact, occur. This\n;\n\f106 Alice Johnson. [part\nagain seems to illustrate the dependence of the phenomena on\nsuggestion, since they occurred as predicted at the previous\nsitting.\nOn April 27th, 1905, Dr. Gower being then in London,\nI opened the three envelopes in his presence and found that\nthe three cards were : King of Hearts, Knave of Hearts, and\nAce of Hearts. We looked through the remainder of the pack\nto see if the cards named by T. W. were either at the top\nor bottom, or all three together, but found them separately\nin the middle of it. Thus the amount of success in this\nexperiment (one suit right and one number right) was prac-\ntically equal to the most probable degree of success by\nchance. It is perhaps hardly surprising that nothing more\nwas attained.\nDuring the sittings in February and March, 1905, various\ncommunications were received through raps from supposed\n\" controls,\" giving names, addresses, and other particulars, which\nturned out incorrect or unverifiable. Dr. Gower and some\nof his friends also tried some experiments at this time with a\nnon-professional medium living in the same town. The circle\nwas an entirely private one, consisting of husband and wife,\na brother of the wife, and another relative, who had developed\n\" direct voices,\" materialisations, lights, etc. All were well\nknown in the town, and of apparent respectability and honesty.\nDr. Gower and his friends went to their house by invitation,\nand held three Ion\" sittings with them. The circumstances\no o\nof the first led them to suspect fraud, but they were unwilling\nto believe it, on account of the reputation of the family. At\nthe third sitting one of the investigating party happened to\nbe in a favourable position for close observation, and saw by\nthe light coming through a slit in the window blind that the\nlady of the house was manipulating some rather simple\n\" materialised \" forms. This being confirmed by the observa-\ntions of the others both as to the forms and the voices, left\nthem no choice but to attribute the whole of the phenomena\nto deliberate and apparently unmotived fraud.\nThis discovery, together with the fictitious character of nearly\nall the supposed communications given to his own circle by\nraps, except those purporting to come from T. W., naturally\nled Dr. Gower to scrutinise, even more carefully than before,\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 107\nthe conditions of the sittings with his friends. They had by\nthis time\u2014on account of the untrustworthiness of the com-\nmunications\u2014given up the spiritistic interpretation which they\nwere at first inclined to apply to the phenomena ; but they all\nremained\u2014and I believe that to this day they all remain\n\u2014\nconvinced that phenomena had happened which could not be\nexplained by ordinary causes. Dr. Grower wrote to us at this\ntime that though, of course, he could not help taking into\naccount the personal character of the friends who had long\nbeen well known to him, he had made every effort to judge\nof the evidence apart from this, and it appeared to him that\nnothing short of a wholesale deception on an organised plan\nwould explain everything. The phenomena had been observed\nby a number of people in different houses, and with different\nsitters, he alone being always present. This, together with his\nreputation as an amateur conjurer, had, in fact, caused real\nsuspicion to fall on him outside his own circle, and it was\ngenerally rumoured in the town that he was the trickster.\nAt a sitting held at Dr. Williams's house on August 1st,\n1905, after some raps with and without contact, and move-\nments of the table with contact, the following occurred, as\nreported by Dr. Gower\n:\nWe then, at my suggestion, stood up and joined hands at a\ndistance of about six to ten inches from the table. Several move-\nments of the table were observed without any apparent contact. At\nthis point the conversation (which had been general, and at times\nupon topics other than the phenomena under observation) ceased.\nMiss M. F. requested that a movement should be made of some\ncandy which was lying upon the table top, and Mrs. H. suggested\nthat a ring, which she took off her finger and placed upon the\ntable, should move. Two members of the circle thought that they\ndetected some movement in these objects. I did not do so.\nThis last remark is of interest as indicating the possibility\nof illusion on the part of the sitters in regard to some at\nleast of the supposed movements of objects without contact.\nSlight illusions of this kind are of course not uncommon, and\nare by no means difficult to produce by suggestion. Thus, it\nseems not unlikely that the reported movements of liquids\n(see p. 100) were really illusory, and the hypothesis that all\n\f108 Alice Johnson. [part\nthe movements without contact can be explained in the same\nway cannot be dismissed. Nevertheless, the cases as here\nreported go so far beyond what is known to occur to persons\nin a normal condition of consciousness that more evidence is\nof course recmired before this hypothesis can be regarded as\nestablished.\nIn November, 1905, Dr. Gower wrote to me that he had\nthen three circles in which raps, without apparent contact,\noccurred. During a visit of his to England in January and\nFebruary, 1906, we held six more sittings with him, but\nunfortunately with no result.\nAt the end of April, 1906, Professor William James, on\nhis way home from Leland Stanford University, made a short\nstay at in the hope of witnessing some of the phenomena.\nThe sitters, in the absence of Dr. Gower, were, however, dis-\ninclined to try experiments, but they talked freely of their\nexperiences to Professor James, and he gives a brief report as\nfollows\n:\nApril 30th, 1906.\nWe got here at noon yesterday, and opened communication\nwith Dr. Williams, who told me that Dr. Gower had not yet\narrived from Europe, but who gave me and helped me to much\ntestimony as to the physical phenomena reported. Professor H.,\nMr. J. T., and Mrs. Williams (whom I didn't see till this morn-\ning), all said that movements without contact were so absolutely\ncertain in their minds as no longer to cause astonishment. Yet no\nsystematic notes had been taken, and the evidence, strongly as it\nimpressed me (especially Mrs. Williams's, who [seemed to take\nlittle interest in the phenomena], but who replied, when I asked\nher straight whether she believed she had seen her tables move\nwithout contact, \"of course !\"), \u2014the evidence, I say, cannot be used\nto convince others, but subjectively has much impressed me.\nTheir circles began over ten years ago, Dr. Gower being their\nstarter and enthusiastic director. Dr. Williams thinks that Dr.\nGower is the essential medium ; he says that Dr. Gower considers\nMrs. Williams more essential. They have sat little without Dr.\nGower, and have never (?) had contactless movements when he was\nnot present. Mr. T. proved himself to be a very efficient solicitor\nof movements\u2014the most successful method being heartily to suggest\nto the table that it should move.\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 109\nMovements with contact were often inexplicable in Dr. Williams's\nopinion by muscular pressure. They used various tables in various\nplaces, no one table seeming more propitious. An extension dining\ntable figured, and a very light stand. The table most in use at\nDr. Williams's was a solid oak one about 3 ft. square on top, with\ncasters. There was also a much used oaken library table. I tried\nto lift one end of it with my left hand, but failed ;\nevidently it\nweighed some 80 lbs. Its greatest feat one day was moving across\nthe whole length of the room, say 12 feet. The little table had\nrisen bodily from the ground, and struck Dr. Williams in the\nchest.\nMost of the contactless movements were very brief, as if the\nforce exhausted itself quickly. Xo one had complained of tiredness\nafter sitting.\nMrs. Williams testified to the water-splashing reported to Hodgson.\nThe best way to induce movements without contact had been\nto get them first with contact, then reduce the contact to one\nfinger from each sitter, then take off the fingers, holding the hands\nnot far, and tell the table to move, when it often would. The\ncontactless movements were sliding, tipping, and rising bodily.\nA few more sittings were held after Dr. Gower's return,\nas to which he sent ine brief notes, as follows\n:\nMay mh, 1906.\n. . . We have had a sitting, and the results were very promising\n\u2014\nraps and movements without contact (apparently). . . .\nMay 25th, 1906.\nWe had a seance two evenings ago, and I send you just a line\nto say that there are still \"things doing.\" Eaps, movements,\netc., without contact, and jumps with contact ; the latter, however,\nquite puzzling. . . . Mr. T. and I tried by ourselves to get some-\nthing in my room here. We put our hands upon an oak table,\nas heavy, if not heavier, than the seance table in your room [i.e.\nthe S.P.E. rooms], and without casters. We got nothing without\ncontact, but raps came on the table and on the floor (apparently).\nAt two other sittings mentioned in Dr. Gower's letters to\nme at this time, similar results were obtained. In discussing\nthe phenomena in general, in view of my proposed visit to\nAmerica, he observed\n:\nJune 23rd, 1906.\n... It is so easy to make raps without apparent contact that\n\f110 Alice Johnson. [part\nit seems impossible to decide for certain that the raps are really\nsupernormally produced, however keenly one may be observing.\nCertain occurrences I have witnessed could not possibly have been\nproduced by any means known to me, but more frequently it is\npossible that they could be. ...\nII. My Own Experiences.\nI arrived at on August 25th, 1906, and was shortly\nintroduced to most of the sitters. They all received me\nwith much kindness and hospitality, especially Dr. and\nMrs. Williams, and did all in their power to give me oppor-\ntunities of witnessing the phenomena. Their only objection\nto allowing their names to appear in connection with the\ncase was the fear of newspaper notoriety in their own State.\nAny one who has had experience of the idiosyncracies of a\ncertain section of the American press will sympathise with\nthis fear.\nThere is, as already said, no professional medium in the\ncircle, and no one who is accustomed to go into trance, or\ninto any kind of abnormal condition during the sittings. But\nit is to Mrs. Williams's agency or mediumship that the\nphenomena are in Dr. Gower's view chiefly to be attributed,\nsince the most marked ones have almost always occurred in\nher presence, and the movements and raps seem stronger,\nthe nearer they are to her. Dr. Williams is a Canadian by\nbirth, and an Edinburgh M.D., who stands at the head of\nhis profession in the town where they live\u2014a town of over\n200,000 inhabitants\u2014and is in request by patients in all\nparts of the State. He has recently taken to using hypnotic\nsuggestion in his practice, and showed me several cases in\nwhich it seemed to have been of great service.\nMrs. Williams\u2014like most women in that part of America\n\u2014\nspends a great part of her time and energy in household\naffairs, on account of the almost complete dearth of domestic\nservants. Her mind seemed to be chiefly occupied with her\nchildren and her friends, and the practical details of everyday\nlife. She took no interest in the sittings, and only consented\nto hold them at Dr. Gower's request for my benefit ; she\ncould not bear to be regarded as a medium. She did not\ndeny\u2014though she minimised as much as possible\u2014the state-\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. Ill\nments of the other witnesses that movements of the table\nhad occurred without contact in a way she could not account\nfor ;\nbut, she asked, what was the good of that ? It led to\nnothing ;\nthey went on, and they never got any forwarder,\nand it was all a stupid and tiresome waste of time. She\nthought it extraordinary that I should have come all that\nway on the chance of seeing something, but was willing to\nhold sittings as I had come. I must add that every one I\nmet expressed the highest opinion of her general character\nand trustworthiness, and what I saw of her led me to take\nthe same view.\nThe other sitters were engaged in various businesses or\nprofessions in the town, and with the exception of Dr.\nGower and Dr. Williams, seemed to take little interest in\nthe sittings. In a rapidly changing and developing place of\nthis kind, material interests and practical affairs are necessarily\nforced into the foreground, and the absence of settled tradi-\ntions gives the child-like outlook on life which is typical of\na country where nothing seems impossible, and hardly anything\ninappropriate. The obstacles of custom that to us of the\nelder nations block the path of all reforms are simply\nignored, or do not exist in such a place. Like the child in\nthe fairy tale who could not see the Emperor's new clothes,\nthese Westerners are unable, for instance, to see any difficulty\nin women becoming enfranchised citizens of the State as soon\nas they come of age. Similarly, it seemed to them the\nmost natural thing in the world when at a sitting to address\nthe \" controls \" in a friendly spirit in the local vernacular\n:\n\" Now, Albert, get busy !\n\" \" See here, Bertie, get up and\ndust !\n\" and so on. The \" controls \" generally seemed encouraged\nand stirred up by this kind of remark, and would act\naccordingly.\nAltogether, I made the acquaintance of 21 of the sitters\nconcerned (besides Dr. Gower), not to mention all the tables.\nThey talked to me freely about the earlier sittings, and though\ntheir accounts did not always agree in every detail, they all\nagreed that the extensible pedestal table had opened of itself,\nand that the other table had moved across the room and\nback again, and? tilted several times, all without being touched.\nIt did not seem to me that these events had grown in their\n\f112- Alice Johnson. [part\nrecollection, since what they told me tallied with the brief\nrecords made at the time.\nDuring my visit 18 sittings were held, 11 at the house\nof Dr. Williams, 3 at the house of Mrs. B., the owner\nof the extensible table, and the other 4 at two other houses.\nDr. Gower and I, of course, attended all these sittings\n;\nMrs. Williams was present at the first 12 of them (10 of\nwhich were held at her own house, and 2 at Mrs. B.'s). She\nthen left the town to stay with her children in the moun-\ntains some 80 miles off, and was prevented by a snowstorm\nfrom returning before I had to leave.\nOf these twelve sittings with Mrs. Williams, three were\nblanks. At the others, abundant raps were heard, both when\nthe sitters' hands were on the table, and to a less extent\nwhen they were off. Tilts and other movements of the table\noccurred in the ordinary way with our hands on the table,\nand a few movements apparently without contact, as well as\nsome levitations which we could not explain.\nThe sittings were all held in a good light. I did not\nattempt to take notes at the time, as I wished to observe\nas carefully as possible all that was happening, so I wrote\na full report of each sitting on the day after it was held,\nand submitted my report to Dr. Gower, in order that he\nmight confirm or correct it.\nThis was not an ideal plan, but it seemed the best possible\nunder the circumstances. When, as in some experiments, we\nwant chiefly to know all that was spoken in the course of\nthem, it is not only comparatively easy but essential to make\na complete record on the spot. In the case of \" physical\nphenomena,\" where the first essential is to observe a series\nof more or less complicated actions, it is not possible for one\nperson to do this adequately and to take notes of his observa-\ntions at the same time. The reports were therefore written\nas soon as possible afterwards.\nI will now give some extracts from these reports :\nSitting I.\nMonday, Aug. 27\/06, 8.30\u201411.30 p.m., at the house of\nDr. Williams.\nPresent: Dr. and Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, Mr. T., Mr. and Mrs. P.,\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 113\nMrs. E., Mrs. B., and A. J. Also Miss R. (aunt of Mrs. Williams),\nwho sat away from the table all the time.\nDr. Gower played on the piano for a few minutes before we\nbegan. Mrs. Williams and Mr. T. brought the table from a corner\nof the room into the middle. They told me it was the table most\noften used at their sittings. It was a heavy, oblong table \u2014some\n4 to 5 ft. long, and 2 to 3 ft. wide\u2014with four straight legs, one at\neach corner, on casters, and a ledge below, about 10 inches from\nthe floor. It had no cloth on. The room was lighted by a\nbrilliant incandescent gas burner, [connected with] a chandelier\n(which also contained electric lights) in the middle of the room,\nthe gas burner being placed on a small table near the seance\ntable. During part of the evening one of these electric lights was\nturned on for a short time, and then off again, and then an\nelectric light in the next room was turned on for a time. This\nroom opened into the seance room by a wide archway, over which\ncurtains were drawn part of the time. The main light throughout\nwas from the gas burner, which was full on all the time, and it\nwas ample for all purposes. The only difficulty about seeing arose\nfrom the fact that the table necessarily prevented one's seeing the\nlower part of the body of most of the sitters. . . .\nWe began by sitting round the table with our hands on it.\nBefore long raps were heard apparently in the table. They were\nnot at all loud\u2014sometimes only just audible \u2014and sounded rather\nlike a finger nail tapping gently on the table. They were fairly\nfrequent, and answered to questions by rapping once for \" no,\" and\nthrice for \" yes \" ; also gave any number that was asked for. In\nanswer to questions they said a spirit was present\u2014a man\u2014but\nwould not give his name or any other particulars.\nWe took all our hands off the table, and sat round without touch-\ning it at all, and the raps came again just as before, apparently in\nthe table. I could not detect any difference in the quality of the\nsounds, and they showed an equal amount of intelligence\n\u2014\ni.e.\nanswered questions by one or three raps, and gave the numbers\nrequired.\nPart of the time we stood round the table holding our linked\nhands above it, and without touching it at all. I think raps\noccurred under these circumstances, but I am not now quite certain,\nas I cannot remember all the details and order of events.\nWe also got movements of the table, both with and without contact.\nAll these movements were of the same nature, viz., backwards\nH\n\f114 Alice Johnson. [part\nand forwards, and sideways\u2014all the legs remaining on the floor\nall the time ; there was no tilting. When we touched the table,\nwe were supposed to be touching it witb our hands only, which\nwere laid flat on the top of it.\nThe movements without contact occurred, I think, three or four\ntimes\u2014generally very soon after there had been a movement with con-\ntact. They came rather suddenly, the table being on these occasions\njerked once or twice over a space of perhaps three or four inches,\nand then stopping dead. During these movements the hands of\nthe sitters were held in the air over the table, \u2014I think at least\nthree inches from its surface, \u2014and on at least one occasion, we\nwere standing\u2014not sitting\u2014round it.\nI feel practically certain that these movements were not produced\nby the hands of any of the sitters ; but I coidd not tell what\ntheir legs were doing, as they Avere hidden from me by the table.\nI watched as carefully as was possible under the circumstances,\nand saw nothing in the least suspicious during any part of the\nevening.\nWe tried in vain to get a small pencil, which was placed on\nthe middle of the table, moved.\nLater, after an interval, we tried again with a small, light\nsquare fourdegged table, which easily moved and tilted and twisted\nitself round so as to balance on one leg, and then gave a sort of\njump into the air, coming down on all its legs. It was impossible\nto be sure, however, that all the legs had really been off the\nfloor simultaneously, and all these movements took place with\ncontact.\nOn the whole, though the conditions were so inconclusive that\nno stress could be laid on anything that occurred, I felt it decidedly\nencouraging that we had got any phenomena at all at this first\nsitting.\nThe above account was written between 1 and 4.30 p.m. on\nTuesday, Aug. 28\/06.\nRead and endorsed, Aug. 30\/06. John H. Gower.\nSitting III.\nWednesday, Aug. 29\/06, about 9 \u201411 p.m., at the house of\nDr. Williams. \u2022\nPresent: Dr. and Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, Mrs. T. W., and\nA. J. ;\nlater, Mr. T. Miss R. was also present, but took no part\nin the sitting.\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 115\nSame table used as at first sitting. Mrs. Williams measured\nit, and found it to be 4 ft. long by 2-i- ft. wide. It is made of\nsolid oak, with a drawer at each end.\nThe light used was the incandescent gas burner, placed on a\nsmaller table. After some music we sat in the positions shown\n[in a diagram not reproduced here] with our hands on the table.\nSoon raps were heard, apparently in the table. They were faint,\nand sometimes barely audible ; when a little louder they sounded\nto me like small drops of water falling on the table.\nA small pencil was put on the table, and we requested that it\nmight be moved without the table being moved. The request was\nmade at intervals several times, but the pencil was not moved.\nThe raps answered to questions as before, the questions and\nremarks addressed to the \" spirits \" being made generally by\nDr. Gower. After a little time, on his asking what spirit was\npresent, the name \" Robert Rowed \" was rapped out. Mrs. Williams\nsaid: \"Is that you, Bob?\" and it rapped \"yes.\"\nDr. Williams said :\n\" Ask him how many years he has been\ndead,\" and the answer came by raps: \"Three.\" Mrs. Williams\nsaid she thought that was right, and appealed to Miss R. to say\nwhether it was not. Miss R. thought he had died about three\nyears ago last Christmas.\nOn being asked if there was any message for anybody, the raps\ngave \" Tell Emily (here Mrs. Williams remarked that \" Emily\n\"\nwas right) all well don't worry.\"\nDr. Williams said: \"Ask him where he died,\" and the raps\ngave \"Sey.\" Here Mrs. Williams said that was right\u2014the name\nof the place being Seymore.\nMrs. Williams told us that Robert Rowed was a man who had\nlived near her old home (in Canada ?) and had been engaged to\na cousin of hers, named Emily. He had died of typhoid fever\nabout three months before he was to have been married. She had\nnot thought of who was meant until the full name was given, as he\nhad always been called \"Bob,\" not \"Robert.\" She gave us his\nfull history.\nDr. Gower said afterwards that he had been much surprised by\nthe interest she manifested in this message, as he had never before\nseen her take any interest in jany of the messages they had got\n\u2014\neven in the first one, which purported to come from her father,\nand gave the name of some place connected with him. On this\noccasion she spoke to the \" control \" quite as if she imagined\n\f116 Alice Johnson. [part\nhim to be really there. She would not ask questions herself, but\nsat with her eyes closed listening attentively, but in a perfectly\ncomposed manner, to the raps, and nodded as each correct state-\nment came.\nNothing more came from Robert Rowed. The next \" control\n\"\nbegan to announce himself as \" Alb\n\u2014\" and on being asked if he\nwas \" Albert Shaw \" answered \" yes.\" We then attempted to get\nmovements. The table moved a little backwards and forwards with\ncontact. Then we took our hands off and stood up round it, and\nit moved once\u2014a distance of about 2 inches \u2014from Mrs. Williams\ntowards me. She was standing very close to it, but apparently\nnot touching it. Dr. Williams suggested we should stand further\noff, and she moved back a little, [but] it did not move again. We\nthen sat down again [but got nothing more except a few raps\nand sideways movements of the table with contact].\nSitting V,\nFriday, Aug. 31\/06, about 9\u201410.30 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.\nPresent: Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and A. J. Miss R. also in\nroom, not taking part in sitting.\nLi\u00b0;ht from incandescent tras burner as before. We sat first\nround the small light four-legged table, with ledge below. By\nsitting back and looking down I could see the legs of the table.\nWe put our hands on the table and raps soon came on it. They\nnext came on Mrs. Williams's chair. The chair was a solid wooden\none with stuffed seat, as represented [in the diagram].\nThe raps seeming to proceed from it, I put my head\nagainst the back to listen and heard them clearly as\nif struck on the front surface of the back. I asked\nMrs. Williams to sit forward so that I could put my\nhead between her and the back of the chair. She did\nso and I listened again with my face towards her back\nand heard the raps on the back of the chair as before.\nThey came in quick succession, sometimes in little runs almost as\nquick as fingers playing a succession of notes on a piano. I listened\nalso with my ear against the wooden side of the seat of the chair\nand then against one of the back legs and the raps seemed about the\nsame. I could not tell exactly in what part of the chair they were.\nMrs. Williams then changed places with me, and the raps came again\nin the chair in which she was then sitting. This chair was made\nentirely of wood, with wooden seat and arms. After a little while\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 117\nwe put a large soft cushion into it for her to sit on and another\nlarge soft cushion on the floor, on which she placed her feet.\nI then listened to the raps with my ear against various parts of the\nchair on Mrs. Williams's left-hand side, and finally went down on\nthe floor and passed my left hand up and down the front leg of\nthe chair on that side to make sure that nothing was knocking\nagainst it. The raps continued while I was doing this. I then got\nmy right arm between the lower bars of the chair (the legs being\nconnected by three or four bars) to feel the right front chair leg.\nI found the cushion was being pressed hard against this by what I\nsupposed was the heel of Mrs. Williams's right foot. I felt this\nbeing moved backwards and forwards several times, pressing hard\nagainst my hand\u2014through the cushion\u2014each time it moved back.\nFor a moment I thought that Mrs. Williams might be trying to\nrap on the chair with this foot ;\n[but] the movements I detected could\nnot apparently have made the raps, because the cushion was\nbetween the foot and the leg of the chair all the time. There\nremains the possibility that before I felt these movements, the foot\nmight have been lifted clear of the cushion and have been knocking\non the chair leg, as the raps ceased before I felt the movements.\nThat is, I heard no raps while I was controlling both legs of the\nchair. I think it most likely, however, that Mrs. Williams was\nmerely pressing her foot on the ground automatically, as she was\nsitting with her arms extended and her hands being held by Dr.\nGower off the table, and I do not think the movements of the foot\nhad any significance in connection with the raps.\nDr. Gower told me that while this was going on he heard raps\nat the same time both on the table and on Mrs. Williams's chair,\nand that the table moved slightly two or three times without con-\ntact. I saw and heard nothing of the table at this time, as I was\noccupied with attending to the chair.\nThe raps on the chair having ceased, I got up and returned to\nmy seat on Mrs. Williams's left hand, and we all again put our\nhands on the table. We got a little tilting and movements of the\ntable with contact, but none without, though we tried lifting our\nhands several times.

Miss R. also\nthere, not taking part in sitting.\nWe sat by firedight\u2014no other light in the room\u2014but the fire\nwas large and burning brightly. [I was sitting near the fire, which\nwas behind me and to my left, as shown in the diagram in my\nnotes], so that I could see the legs of the table specially well.\nWe used the small light table. Raps (with contact) soon came on\nit, announcing the presence of \" Albert Shaw, \" who promised to do\nhis best for us. Mrs. Williams was sitting on a wooden chair with\nstuffed seat and no arms. We put a cushion for her to sit on and\nanother cushion for her feet, and asked the raps to come on her\nchair. They did so, and I went down on the floor at her right\nside to listen for them with my ear against her chair. They\nseemed first to sound on the floor under the table, but soon were\nundoubtedly on Mrs. Williams's chair. I felt round the front chair\nleg nearest to me and found nothing pressing against it. Then I\nput my other arm under the chair to feel the other front chair leg.\nAgainst this, something\u2014presumably Mrs. Wdliams's left foot\u2014was\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 119\nmoving backwards and forwards and up and down, so as to rub the\ncushion up and down against it. This appeared to make sounds\nlike the raps we had been hearing, but I did not manage to get my\near pressed close against the chair at the same time that I was\nfeeling the movements, so that I did not exactly hear the raps\nsynchronising with them. I put my left hand round the distant\nfront chair leg so as to prevent the foot knocking and rubbing\non it. The foot seemed, as it were, to try a little longer to reach\nthe leg; then, finding itself prevented, left off and apparently moved\nforward and immediately afterwards Dr. Gower remarked that the\nraps had now come on the table. I asked that they should come\nback to the chair, and remained in the same position for a few\nminutes waiting for them. As they did not come, I returned to\nmy seat.\nWe then tried to get raps and movements of the table without con-\ntact. We got some raps \u2014I do not remember whether with or without\ncontact. We got one movement of the table when our hands were\nclear of it; the leg between Mrs. W. and Dr. Gower moving about\n2 ins. from her towards him. He was looking down at it, and said\nthat he could see a clear space on the floor between this leg and\nthe cushion on which her feet were resting. I could not see this\nspace, because of the lower ledge of the table. I could see, how-\never, that the table leg on Mrs. Williams's other side was in contact\nwith the cushion, and when Dr. G. and I tried afterwards by our-\nselves, it seemed to us that it might have been possible to push\nthe cushion against this leg in such a way as to produce the\nmovement.\nAfter an interval, Mrs. Williams and I changed places, and the\ntable then began to move (with contact) and tilt. It then got up\non to one leg, the one nearest to her left hand, and after balancing\non it for a little while, gave a sudden jump and came clown on\nthe other legs. The thing was done so quickly that it was impos-\nsible to say whether all four legs were off the ground at once, but\nI do not believe they were. The table moved and tilted a little\nfurther, but nothing more of any importance happened.\nAfter this evening's experience, I cannot doubt that Mrs.\nAVilliams sometimes makes raps with her feet and probably some-\ntimes also with her hands. At one time in the evening\u2014I forget\nwhether before or after the raps on her chair described above \u2014we\nwere getting raps on the table without contact, i.e. with our\n\f120 Alice Johnson. [part\nhands not touching it. But her skirt was in contact with one\nleg. I moved the table so as leave a clear space of about 2 ins.\nbetween it and her skirt, and no more raps came. It seems to\nme, however . . . that she is entirely unconscious of making any\nmovements that have anything to do with the phenomena.\nFurther, nothing that I have observed could account for the\nmore striking phenomena of movements without contact that have\nbeen described to me by the other witnesses.\nAccount written 4\u20145 p.m., Sep. 3\/06.\nBead, Sept. 3rd. \u2014J.

Miss B. also there, taking no part in sitting.\nWe sat first at the large table ; the incandescent gas-lamp on\nthe table behind Mrs. B. Dr. Gower tried knocking on different\nparts of the table to get the musical tones of the various parts, so\nas to judge, when the raps came, on which part they were. He\nfound different tones for the top, legs and lower ledge, on which\nwere a number of large books and papers.\nBaps came soon\u2014apparently on the floor\u2014then on the table\n\u2014\napparently on its lower ledge. They also came occasionally, I think,\non its surface. They occasionally answered \"yes\" and \"no\" to ques-\ntions, but refused to give any name or message. They also came\non Mrs. Williams's chair. Dr. Gower got up and listened with his\near against the back and then against the side of the chair, and\nsaid they appeared to be on it. He then came back to the table.\nWe lifted our hands off it and stood up round it. Baps still came\non it, but apparently on the lower ledge, not the surface. We\ntried several times to get the raps on the surface of the table\nwithout contact, also on other people's chairs, but they came only on\nMrs. Williams's chair, and only, I think, when she was sitting on it.\nMy impression at the time was that she was unconsciously making\nall these raps; they all seemed to be in her immediate neighbour-\nhood. She appeared to be listening to them with the same curiosity\nand interest as the rest of us. From time to time one or other of\nus was aware of making some noise which the others might take\nfor raps, and would then make such remark as \"I did that.\" She\ntoo now and then remarked that some sound was made by herself,\nand she seemed to me to say this whenever she knew that she was\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 121\nproducing a sound. I think the sounds she made consciously were\n. . . a little different from those which, as I believe, she made\nunconsciously. . . .\nSitting IX.\nTuesday, Sep. 4\/06, about 9 \u201411-30 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.\nPresent: Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, W. T., Judge H., and A. J.\nAlso Mrs. H. and Miss R., sitting away from table and taking-\nno part.\nWe sat at the large heavy table. The incandescent gas lamp\nwas lit ; also two electric lights in the central chandelier were\non. We put our hands on the table and soon got raps in it.\nWe took our hands off and the raps continued. Occasionally\nthey showed intelligence\u2014such as answering \"yes\" or \"no,\" or\ngiving a number, but gave no name or message. While they were\ngoing on and we were sitting with our hands off the table, I leant\nback and managed to see the outline of Mrs. Williams's knees\nagainst an illuminated part of the floor in front of Dr. Gower.\n[I was on her right side and Dr. Gower at the end of the table\non her left.] I saw her left knee moving up and down very\nslightly in time with the raps. The movement was so slight that\nI was not always sure of it, but several times I saw as many as\nfive or six movements in succession synchronising with the same\nnumber of raps. I did not always see a movement at the same\ntime that I heard a rap, but as far as I remember, I never\nsaw a movement during this period without hearing a rap.\nFrom the sound of these raps, I did not feel certain that they\nwere on the table, but the other sitters seemed to have no doubt\non this point. If they were right, I think Mrs. Williams probabh'\nmade the raps by knocking her left foot against the leg of the\ntable nearest to her or possibly by rubbing her shin against the\nledge of the table ; there being no clear space visible between her\nskirt and these parts of the table.\nI believe she was quite unconscious of doing this, as I think\nshe must have been aware that I was watching her closely ; but\nmeanwhile the movements went on, and she showed not the slightest\nsign of self-consciousness.\nThroughout the evening we got raps, with our hands sometimes\non and sometimes off the table, but never with a clear space between\nMrs. Williams's skirt and the. object on which the raps appeared\nto be made. . . .\n\f122 Alice Johnson. [part\nSitting XII.\nFriday, Sep. 7\/06, about 9\u201411 p.m., at Dr. Williams's house.\nPresent : Dr. and Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and A. J. Also Miss\nR. taking no part, and George Williams\u2014aged about 14\u2014who was\nreading and now and then came to look on at what the table\nwas doing, but did not touch it at all. The light was stronger\nthan usual, two electric lamps in the central chandelier being on,\nas well as the incandescent gas lamp on the table.\nMrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, and I sat round the small light table\n;\nDr. Williams sitting a little distance off, first in the place shown\n\u2014\nlater on the window seat behind and to the rierht of Mrs. Williams.\nWindow seat Fire-place\nDR\nGower\n33\nDR\nWILUAM5\nTable with\n\u00a3as lamp on\nDr. Williams did not touch the table at any time, but confined\nhimself to making suggestions to it to perform certain movements,\naddressing it as he would one of Ids patients, with whom he uses\nhypnotic suggestion extensively.\nAt first, however, Dr. Gower talked to it as usual, asking for\nraps, which came pretty freely, apparently on the surface of the\ntable ;\nthey were never very loud, but sometimes quite clear.\nThey would not answer questions, but rapped three times when\nDr. Gower asked if \"it\" wished to be left alone to do what it\ncould.\nWe got strong movements and tilting, but only with contact, 1\nDr.\nWilliams repeatedly urging the table to rise completely off the floor.\nThen raps came again, apparently on Mrs. Williams's chair, which\nwas the wooden one with a stuffed seat and no arms. Dr. Williams\nwent round to her right side to listen to these raps, and moved\nthe chair a little forward, to prevent it touching the wall behind\n1\nSee Dr. Gower's Note 1.\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America 123\nand so avoid the possibility of her making sounds by pressing it\nagainst the wall. She sat forwards in the chair with a considerable\nspace between her back and its back, and turned towards Dr.\nGower, stretching out both her feet in that direction between the\nleg of the table and the fireplace. She said that her feet were\ncrossed, and I understood afterwards from Dr. Gower that he could\nsee that they were so. I could not see this from my place ; but\nit appeared to me that her feet were stretched out so much to her\nleft that they could not have been in contact with the leg of her\nchair, and I think there was a clear space between them and the\nadjoining table leg. Under these conditions raps sounded on her\nchair.\nThere were also raps on the table both with our hands on and\nwith our hands off it. When our hands were off, however, Mrs.\nWilliams's skirt was generally in contact with the table leg on her\nright, and on the occasions when there was not this contact, I was\nnot absolutely satisfied that the raps were in the table. She often\ndrew her skirt away from it ; but then in the natural course of\nevents the table would again approach the skirt, or the skirt the\ntable, [for] with our hands on the table it tilted strongly, getting\nfurther and further away from her as it did so. At last she would\nhardly be able to keep her hands on it, and as she leant forward\nto do so, her skirt naturally went forward too. We often tried\nlifting our hands off it, but could never get any movement to\nstart with the hands off, and so had to keep the table constantly\nnear us.\nWe then tried with our hands on it to make it get up on to one\nleg, and jump off that leg, Dr. Williams making strong suggestions to\nthat effect. After a good deal of thumping, wriggling and twisting it\nstood on the leg nearest to Mrs. Williams's right hand, balanced back\nand forth on it for some time, Dr. Williams adjuring it to jump, then\nsuddenly gave a great jump on to the diagonal!}' opposite leg.\nThis happened so quickly that it was impossible\nto see exactly what happened. We urged it to Mb Wiwams\nrepeat the performance, and it did so. As before A B\nO O\nit stood waving and balancing itself on the le\u00b0-\nnearest to Mrs. Williams's right hand (A). [See\ndiagram.] Then suddenly this leg flew up into\nJ\n2\nthe air and at what seemed the same moment\nthe diagonally opposite leg (D) came down on a spot very close\nto where the first leg had stood, the table balancing for half a\n\f124 Alice Johnson. [part\nsecond or so on this second leg, before the other three legs fell\nto the floor.\nBoth Dr. Williams and the boy George, who was lying on the\nfloor near the leg D watching the table, declared that they could\nsee the legs B and C off the ground while this jump was taking\nplace. Dr. Grower and I could not see this, but it must have been\nso from the fact of D falling on to a place so close to where A\nhad been immediately before. The table did not simply fall from\nA on to the other legs, but swung through the arc of a circle,\nand must for a moment have been completely off the floor.\nThe only normal means, as far as I could see, by which this\ncould have been done, was by [a] foot or feet' getting under the\nledge of the table and heaving or kicking it up. 1\nIt appeared\nthroughout the evening both to Dr. Govver and myself that the\nmovements of the table were mainly produced by the unconscious\nmuscular action of Mrs. Williams's hands, which seemed to respond\nforcibly to Dr. Williams's suggestions to the table. It would seem,\ntherefore, not unnatural that her feet should respond unconsciously too.\nThe only question is whether she could have done this without our\nseeing it. The boy was in the best position for seeing her feet,\nas he was lying on the floor, and I think he would have called out\nto her or given some sign if he had seen anything. Probably he\nwas not looking out specially for any movement on her part, but\nhe was watching the table legs intently. [The sitters] were not\nin such a favourable position for seeing ;\n[though] I was looking\nunder the table. . . . Both [Dr. Gower and I, however,] were\nwatching as carefully as possible, and neither of us detected any\nmovement [by the sitters]. But I cannot feel quite certain that\nwe should have seen it if [it had occurred].\nAfter this Dr. Williams suggested to the table to get up on\none leg on to the corner of a large long foot-stool in front of the\nwindow seat. It did this after a good deal of wriggling and\nwaving about, and remained for some time balanced on one leg\non the most extreme point of one corner of the foot-stool with its\nsurface practically horizontal and its other three legs in the air,\nsome six inches from the ground. It not only stood there, but also\nwriggled about a good deal in its efforts to follow Dr. Williams's\nnext suggestion and get another leg up on to Mrs. Williams's chair\nor on to the large arm-chair which was standing near. It must\nhave required very delicate [balancing] for it to do this without\n1\nSee Dr. Gower's Note 2.\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 125\nslipping off the corner of the foot-stool, which was made of a\nwooden frame with a stuffed top. The table was supported on a\ncorner of the stuffing, not of the wood. . . . Finally the table\ntumbled down on to the floor.\nA similar performance was repeated at Dr. Williams's request,\nthe table getting up on one leg on to the foot-stool, but further\nfrom the edge of it, then on another leg on to the window seat,\nwhere it remained tilting for some time, with our hands on it, till\nwe brought it down.\nDr. Williams then went out for about half-an-hour. While he was\naway, Mrs. Williams and Dr. Gower and I continued sitting in the\nsame positions as before. George was now sitting some three or\nfour feet from the table\u2014and certainly not touching it at all \u2014to the\nright of and slightly behind Dr. Gower, and fully in my view.\nWe three sat with our hands on the table, talking, but not making\nany direct suggestion to it. Dr. Gower was relating how at [a\nhouse in England] he had seen a table levitated, when suddenly the\ntable, which had been motionless, rose clear off the ground, straight\nup, remaining in a horizontal position all the time. It rose, I\njudged, some 5 or 6 ins., lifting our hands, which were lying flat\non the surface, with it, and then went straight down again. George\nsaid he saw three legs off the ground, the fourth being invisible to\nhim ; but we none of us doubted that they were all four up at\nonce for a moment.\nWe were not expecting this movement as we had been expecting\nthe jumps of the table described before (pp. 123-4), and therefore were\nnot watching [the table] immediately before it happened. But we\nlooked at [each other] immediately on its happening, and again did\nnot detect any movement whatever of . . . knees or body. We could\nnot see [each other's feet], as they were hidden by the ledge of\nthe table, and again the only possible normal way of raising the\ntable seemed to be by [one of us] lifting the ledge with [a] foot or feet.\n[Mrs. Williams's] skirt was close up to the ledge ; it would have\nbeen easier to do it with [one's] feet crossed, but I do not think\n[the feet of any of us] were crossed, as I think it would have\nbeen visible if they had been. The table seemed to go up\nwith considerable force. This struck Dr. Gower more than\nit did me. He told me afterwards 1\nthat his hands were pressing\nheavily on the table, and he was much surprised at the force with\nwhich it was lifted up against this pressure ; also that he saw Mrs.\n1\nSee Dr. Gower's Note 3.\n\f126 Alice Johnson. [part\nWilliams's face turned towards him with an expression of great\nastonishment as the table lifted. I did not see her face, as I was\nlooking at the lower part of her body.\nI then suggested to her that she and I should both put our feet\non the foot-stool, to make sure that we were not touching the\ntable with our feet. We did so and tried to get the table to move\nup again, but no further movements took place. . . .\nAccount written 11 a.m. \u20141.15 p.m. Sept. 8\/06.\nNotes by J. H. Goicer on Miss Johnson's Report.\nSeptember 8th, 1906. 5 p.m.\nNote 1. \u2014The raps were sometimes made when the hands were\nupon the table, and sometimes when the hands were not touch-\ning it,\nAt one time, early in the sitting, when the raps were occurring,\nI asked for a movement of the table to be made without contact.\nTwo distinct movements were made in response, and so far as I\ncould see, without contact, or such contact as would have been\nnecessary to produce the movement. By this I mean that the leg\nand side of the table which moved the greater distance were quite\nclear, but on the opposite side a skirt may have been touching\nthe leg. But Miss Johnson was in a better position for observing\nthis latter point than I was.\nNote 2. \u2014My recollection is that at the time the table made the\njump we, i.e., Miss Johnson, Mrs. Williams, and myself, were stand-\ning up. Considering that Dr. Williams on the one side, and\nGeorge on the other side, in addition to Miss Johnson and\nmyself, were at the time watching carefully and expectantly the\nvarious movements of the table, I doubt if the feet of any of the\nsitters could have been brought in contact with the table without\nbeing at once noticed.\nNote 3 \u2014Such was the force manifested in this movement of the\ntable that I think it would have required both feet to have pro-\nduced it, especially as my hands were resting so heavily upon my\nside of the table that it would have turned over unless supported\nunderneath by more than one foot ;\nbut, as a matter of fact, the\ntop of the table remained level, and my hands were fairly forced\nup with the table.\nNext morning (to-day) I questioned George closely as to what\nhe observed, and he said he could see clearly underneath the table,\nand nobody's feet were there.\n\fLIV.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 127\nNote by A. J. on levitations of small table on Sep. 7th.\nSeptember 13th, 1906.\nOn Sep. 10th Dr. Gower and I alone tried experiments with\nthis table, which we then measured. The top is 17| ins. x 17| ins.\nThe lower ledge is 12 ins. x 12 ins. and about \u00a7 in. thick. Its\nlower surface is 9| ins. from the floor [see\ndiagram]. The distance between the lower ends\nof diagonally opposite legs is 2 ft. We wrote\ndown these measurements (except the thickness\nof the ledge) at the time.\nWe each tried lifting the table by putting\nour feet under the ledge. It is of course\nmuch easier to lift it horizontally if the\nhands are placed on the top so as to keep it balanced. Under\nthese circumstances, it does not matter to which point of the ledge\nthe foot is applied, as the hands can keep the balance in any\ncase. But if the hands press much on the table it is very difficult\nto lift it with the foot ; I could not do so while Dr. Gower was\npressing on it about as much as he thought he did at the sitting\n(when his impression was that a considerable force was lifting the\ntable in opposition to the weight of his hands on it), and he could\nonly do it with great difficulty while I pressed on it. But if the\nperson who tried to lift the table crossed his legs, it was then\nmuch easier to lift it. In any case, however, it appeared hardly\npossible that if the table had been lifted by such means we should\nhave failed to detect it, as when we did it in this way our move-\nments were so very obvious to each other. We were of course\nlooking out for each other's movements, but then we were also\nlooking out at the sitting for movements . . . and we saw none.\nWe believed that [the sitters'] legs were not crossed at the time, and\nthat consequently a great effort would have been necessary to\nlift the table.\nDr. Gower tells me that he cross-examined George more than\nonce as to what he saw of the sitters' feet ; that he declared they\nwere all sitting with their feet back\u2014not under the table at all\n\u2014\nthat he could see the ends of his mother's shoes, and that no one\nmoved at all.\nWe tried also to make the table jump from one leg on to the\ndiagonally opposite one by lifting the ledge with our feet. We\ndid not manage to make the opposite leg alight on a spot close\n\f128 Alice Johnson. [part\nto where the first one had been resting (as happened at the sitting),\nbut probably this could be done with practice. The performance\nseemed very clumsy as compared with what happened at the sitting,\nand it seemed even more difficult than in the case of the horizontal\nlifting to suppose that it could have been done [deliberately by]\nnormal means without detection.\nNevertheless I am not satisfied that these experiments reproduce\nthe conditions of a sitting sufficiently for purposes of exact\ncomparison. ... I do not think they prove conclusively that\nthere is no automatic action of a kind [more effective than any\nthat] could be deliberately and consciously produced.\nAfter the twelfth sitting Mrs. Williams left the town to\njoin her [children who were staying in the mountains, so that\nwe had unfortunately no further opportunities of experiments\nwith her. Six more sittings were held after her departure\nat the houses of various members of the circle. No move-\nments without contact occurred, nor were there any levitations\nof the table. It is noteworthy, however, that at all these\nsittings raps were obtained, though only (with one doubtful\nexception) when the sitters' hands were resting on the table\non which the raps sounded. If, therefore, I am right in\nattributing these raps to the automatic action of the sitters,\nit would seem that Mrs. Williams was not the only one\nwho had acquired the faculty for making them in this\nmanner.\nIII. General Discussion of Evidence.\nIn considering the reports quoted above it may perhaps\nbe not out of place to make a few remarks on the character\nof evidence for \" physical phenomena \" in general. There is,\nI believe, a rather widely-spread opinion that the Society for\nPsychical Eesearch has a special bias against this subject,\nand it is no doubt true that the Proceedings contains more\nnegative than positive evidence on it. But, though every\none must admit that\u2014from the nature of the case\u2014it must\nbe easier to prove fraud, where fraud exists, than to prove\nany kind of genuine supernormal occurrence, few persons seem\nto grasp what are the special difficulties in the way of proving\nphysical phenomena.\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 129\nAt first sight it might be supposed, and in fact it is generally\nsupposed, that physical phenomena are more demonstrable\nthan psychical phenomena, since the former can be perceived\nby all the persons present, and the latter, as a rule, are only\nperceptible to one, so that we have to depend on his state-\nment as to what has happened to him.\nIf, however, we are considering the evidence for a case\nof telepathy\u2014say, when an apparition is seen at the time\nof death of the person represented\u2014the statement of the\npercipient, if made at the time of his experience, is all that\nwe want. In making it, he is describing the only kind of\nevent of which he can have any direct knowledge, viz., an\nimpression produced on his consciousness. Supposing, there-\nfore, that he is speaking the truth about this impression, the\nstatement may be taken as absolutely and literally correct.\nFrom the point of view of evidence for telepathy, it is not even\nvery important whether he is speaking the truth or not ; he\nmay not have had a sensory impression, but only a vague\nidea ; or he may have invented the whole thing. The point\nis that he should have made the statement at the time to one\nor more persons equally ignorant with himself of the death.\nIf there were a large number of cases in which such state-\nments had been made at the time of deaths, and at such\ntimes only, we should consider it practically certain that there\nwas some causal connection between the deaths and the\nstatements\u2014something that made people make such statements\nat such times.\nThe evidence for such cases of telepathy then is of the\nsimplest possible kind ; that is, there are comparatively few\nsteps in the argument, and in consequence comparatively few\nopportunities for flaws.\nThe evidence for physical phenomena, on the other hand,\nis far more complicated, and consequently affords far more\nopportunities for error. Here it is not a question of what\nimpressions were produced on people's minds, but what objective\neffects were produced in the material world outside them. If\nthe witnesses are veracious, and accustomed to observe their\nown mental impressions, they can tell us what these were.\nThe external events they can of course only infer from their\nmental impressions ;\nthey have no direct knowledge of them,\ni\n\f130 Alice Johnson. [part\nand may be entirely mistaken about them. There are thus\na number of alternative possibilities as to what the external\nevents were :\n(1) They may have happened as described.\n(2) They may have been purely hallucinatory, as when\nhallucinatory figures are seen at seances.\n(3) They may have been positively illusory, e.g. an object\nmay be seen to move when it is really standing\nstill.\n(4) Negative hallucinations may occur ; i.e. a person may\nentirely fail to see an object fully within his field\nof vision.\n(5) Negative illusions may occur; i.e. some movement may\nbe made which the observer absolutely overlooks, as\nin the case of many conjuring tricks.\nAll these defects of perception are known to be more or\nless common, and we are accustomed to making more or less\nallowance for them in ordinary life ;\nyet how little allowance\nis, as a rule, made for them in judging the evidence for\nphysical phenomena. In such cases the usual comment is :\n\" I shall believe so-and-so when I see it, but not before,\"\nOf course, the mere fact of seeing a thing oneself would by\nno means afford adecpaate ground for believing it. We all\nknow that our senses may be deceived, and we do not, as\na matter of fact, believe anything because we have seen it\n;\nwe believe it because we have seen it, or things consistent\nwith it many times before, or because we have heard other\npeople say they have seen it. If any one saw a cow jump\nover the moon, he would believe that his senses had deceived\nhim. If he saw a cow jump over a gate, he would believe\nthat he had met with an unusually active cow. Yet, the\nimpression on his consciousness might be of precisely the\nsame nature in both cases.\nAnother common argument is to this effect :\n\" Why not\nbelieve in objects being moved without contact ? That would\nnot be more wonderful and mysterious than an object being\nmoved with contact. We do not understand in the least how\nthe latter is done ;\nwhy then should we not believe in the\npossibility of the former ?\n\" This may be sound, but it appears\nto me quite irrelevant. The credibility or non-credibility of\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 131\na thing does not depend at all on how wonderful it is ; it\ndepends on how rare it is. The burden of proof must lie\nwith those who wish to maintain the genuineness of any\nfacts unrecognised by science, and we are bound to demand\n\u2014\nand in practice we always do demand\u2014much more evidence\nfor alleged facts which are both rarely reported and inconsistent\nwith ordinary experience than for facts of common kinds. As\nProfessor Eichet observed in 1893 in his first report on\nEusapia Paladino, \" The evidence that I have to offer would\nbe ample for an experiment in chemistry ; it does not suffice\nfor an experiment in spiritism.\"\n1 feel the same about the evidence for the reality of the\nphysical phenomena in this case ;\n\u2014it appears to me that other\nexplanations of the reported movements without contact are\nnot excluded in an absolutely conclusive manner,\u2014especially\nthe explanation of negative illusion, according to which the\nactions that produced the movements of the tables were on\nsome occasions overlooked, so that, on these occasions, the\ntables appeared to the sitters to have moved of themselves.\nThis hypothesis is to a certain extent supported by my own\nobservations of the apparently unconscious production of raps\nby some of the sitters.\nI speak of the production of raps as unconscious and\nautomatic, because I personally am convinced of the good\nfaith of all the sitters, but this of course must to outsiders\nbe an opinion that requires justification. The same plea\nhas frequently been urged by spiritualists as an excuse\nfor what the plain man would call fraud, and we\nhave frequently been blamed for not having yet\ndiscovered this simple explanation of it. There is, however,\nnothing really novel in the notion that people are not\nresponsible for their actions. It dates back, in fact, to the\ngarden of Eden. In that case one of the two personages of\nthe story put down his action to \" the woman whom Thou\ngavest to be with me.\" The other, on being asked for an\nexplanation, said \"The serpent beguiled me.\" These two\nalternatives have between them practically held the field\nsince ; one hardly knows which of them has been the more\npopular.\nSimilarly, some spiritualists are wont to say that when a\n\f132 Alice Johnson. [part\nmedium cheats, it is due either to the sitters or to the\nSerpent. If the sitters belong to the S.P.E., it would of\ncourse be the sitters ; otherwise it is probably the Serpent.\nWe have added a third alternative, the Subliminal Self, whose\nclaims now fall to be considered.\nIn analysing any mediumistic phenomenon such as the\nproduction of raps, we find several different aspects, which\nmust be treated separately if we are to avoid a hopeless\nconfusion of thought. There is first the objective aspect\n:\nby what means were the raps produced ? In the case here\nconsidered, it seemed to me clear that at least some of them\nwere produced by the muscular action of the sitters. Assuming\nthis, there is next the subjective aspect, which includes two\n:\n(1) The psychological question of whether the sitters were\nnormally conscious of their muscular actions, or whether they\nwere initiated and carried out subliminally.\n(2) The ethical question of their moral responsibility for\ntheir actions.\nThe moral character of a medium concerns us only in\nso far as it affords a certain amount of evidence for or\nagainst the genuineness of the phenomena, for it cannot be\ntoo strongly insisted on that our business is to form a\nscientific judgment about the phenomena,\u2014not a moral\njudgment about the medium ; so that any question of charity\nin our judgment would be out of place.\nAs to the psychological question of whether a given action\nis performed consciously or not, I think that all those who\nhave studied trance conditions are agreed that no test can\nshow whether a person is in a trance ; that is, whether\nhis supraliminal consciousness is in abeyance or not. But\nstudents of the trance acquire after long observation the\nconviction that the trance in certain cases is genuine\nand not simulated, though the signs by which they are\nguided are so minute and indefinable that they could not be\nput clown in black and white, or demonstrated to people who\nwere not familiar with them. And expert observers almost\nalways, I think, agree in their opinion as to whether a given\ntrance is genuine or not.\nIt is of course more difficult to judge whether writing or\ntable-tilting is being done automatically or not, because then, as\n\fliv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 133\na rule, the supraliminal consciousness is only partly in abeyance,\nand the signs of the condition are still slighter. Still we find\nby observing a good many cases, that the behaviour of all\npersons under these conditions shows certain common character-\nistics which it is by no means easy deliberately to put on\n\u2014\npartly no doubt because it is so difficult to formulate what\nthey are. I can only say then that by comparing the case\nhere discussed with other cases which I have seen, it seemed\nclear to me that the movements associated with the raps were\nautomatic.\nIt seems possible, moreover, to define roughly the kinds\nof cases to which this explanation should be restricted.\nThey are those where there is strong positive ground for\nconfidence in the honesty and integrity of the medium ; and\nwhere the phenomenon is of a kind that does not require\npreparation\u2014either in the way of long practice or of apparatus.\nThus, the case of Eusapia Paladino has a certain superficial\nresemblance to this case, but differs from it in that it is well\nknown (1) that the general character of the medium is entirely\nuntrustworthy, (2) that the fraud most clearly proved against\nher\u2014viz. making one hand or foot do duty for two, and so\ngetting one free\u2014is a well-known trick, her extraordinary\nadeptness in which showed that she must have practised it\nfor a long time.\nWe cannot, however, determine a priori whether the sub-\nliminal self might not carry out an elaborate series of actions\nof this kind involving practice. We have to study what\npeople in abnormal states of mind actually do. Let us take\nfirst fixed ideas or obsessions which only affect a limited part\nof the personality, leaving the rest normal. These ideas may\nbe more or less complicated, but they seldom lead to any\npositive and definite course of action. Motor impulses of a\ncorresponding kind are generally very simple\u2014such as habits\nof twitching certain muscles. Going to the other extreme of\nmultiple and alternating personalities, we do find complicated\nactions performed by different personalities ; but these are not\nrestricted to certain types, for the secondary personality affects\nthe whole mind and character, not an isolated group of actions.\nThus, there is the classic case of Louis Vive, who in his\nchief secondary condition \" preached radicalism in politics\n\f134 Alice Johnson. [part\nand atheism in religion,\" while in his more normal state\nhe is reported to have been quite a respectable person.\nThis is comprehensible and credible. But we find among the\nrecords of secondary personality no parallel for the medium\nwho was said, while in a trance condition, to have automati-\ncally bought drapery for making up materialised forms,\nautomatically concealed it in the back of a chair specially\nadapted for the purpose, and subliminally provided himself\nwith chuckers-out for every sitting. Persons in a trance\ncondition may sometimes have recurring dreams as elaborate\nas this ;\nthey do not, I think, perform recurring actions so\nelaborate.\nThere is one more point which seems worth noting about\nautomatic actions, viz. their tendency to spread by a sort of\nmental infection among the persons who witness them. Thus,\nin Dr. Gower's circle, several of the sitters must apparently\nhave been concerned in producing the raps, since they went\non abundantly in the presence of several different groups.\nThis has a certain interest in its bearing on the far more\nwidespread epidemic of rapping that followed the outbreak in\nthe Fox family in 1848. In the course of the next year or\ntwo, it appears that the rappings had become pronounced in\nhundreds of families in the Eastern States of America. We\ncan hardly suppose that all these people were deliberately\nand consciously knocking on their own furniture. It seems\nto me much more likely that the phenomenon was of the same\nnature as the table-tiltings that became so prevalent a few\nyears later, i.e. that while in some cases it was in all pro-\nbability deliberately produced, in most it was due to genuine\nautomatic action.\nProbably few readers will be inclined to accept the hypothesis\nof automatic action as a satisfactory explanation of all the\nfacts recorded in this paper. Though it may account for the\nraps, it is obviously far more difficult\u2014though perhaps not\nquite impossible\u2014to apply it to the levitations of the table\nwhich I witnessed at the sitting of September 7th, 1906, and\nit seems altogether inapplicable to the more decisive movements\nwithout contact that were reported by the other witnesses to\nhave occurred at the earlier sittings.\nWe could, however, explain the levitations, as I have\n\fLiv.] Sittings for Physical Phenomena in America. 135\nalready suggested, by supposing an element of illusion, as\nwell as of automatic action : viz. that one of the three\nsitters\u2014Mrs. Williams, Dr. Gower, or myself\u2014raised the\ntable automatically and unconsciously, while the other two\nshared in the negative hallucination of the movement by\nwhich it was done. This would be similar to what\nconstantly happens in conjuring performances, when the\nparticular action that does the trick escapes the notice of\nthe spectators ; the only difference being that in our case the\nperformer was an automatist, which would greatly facilitate\nhis task. For it is well known that actions automatically\nperformed are often carried out with far greater skill and\nefficiency than those consciously performed, while the automatist\nis not hampered by any self-consciousness in carrying them\nout freely.\nThe hypothesis would have to be strained still further to\naccount for the alleged movements without contact ; for here\nwe should have to suppose that there was contact which\na larger number of sitters somehow overlooked on several\noccasions. Having been present at the sittings, this hypothesis\ndoes not seem to me so extravagant as it probably will to\nmost of my readers, for an eye-witness sees how extremely\ndifficult it is\u2014under the conditions of such experiments\n\u2014\nto make sure of whether any one is touching the table or\nnot, since the table itself inevitably obstructs one's view\nof the persons on the other side of it. The tradition\nof the \" circle,\" with all the superstitions that have grown\nup arouud it, is of all others calculated to baffle any exact\nobservation.\nIn conclusion, I can only say that it appears to me\nimpossible to form any decided judgment on the facts before\nus, and unprofitable to speculate further about them till we\ncan obtain more decisive evidence one way or the other.\n\f136 Walter Leaf, Litt.D.

Utgjevi av Det norske Samlage, 1898.\n(2) Bjornstjerne Bjornson : Vis-Knut. \" Vaarsol's \" gratisbog,\nKristiania, 1898.\nMr. Ivar Fosse, of Hundorp in Norway, has called the attention of\nthe S.P.R. to the history of a Norwegian peasant named Knut Ras-\nmusson Nordgarden, who enjoyed for more than half of last century,\nthroughout Norway and much of Sweden, a reputation for supernormal\npowers, which earned him the name of \"Vis-Knut,\" Wise Knut.\nMr. Fosse has kindly supplied us with the printed documents, and\nalso with a translation of a portion of them. The case, though it\ncannot now be brought up to any standard of evidence, is a\nremarkable one, and possesses an additional interest from the fact\nthat it is presented by the pen of the veteran of Norse literature,\nBjornstjerne Bjornson. His account, a pamphlet of twenty-nine\npages, was published in 1898 as the \"gratis\" volume presented by\nthe Vaarsol to its subscribers, and what follows is mainly a resume\nof this work. We may begin with a statement of the sources\nof the evidence.\n\"I must explain,\" says Bjornson, \"that I follow a book written\nin the country dialect. The author is a peasant-born but educated\nman named Johannes Skar, who grew up from childhood in the\nmidst of stories about Vis-Knut, and travelled much of the country\nround to enquire personally about what was told ;\nhe was never\nsatisfied until he had spoken to those with whom Knut had come\ninto contact. With Knut himself he had often spoken. Knut lived\nhere in Svastum in Gausdal till 1877, a few [Norwegian] miles from\nme, and I have myself heard many of the stories here recorded,\n\fnv.] Vis-Knut. 137\na couple at first hand, many at second and third, and from my\nchildhood up I have heard others similar to those told hy Skar.\nwithout being able to investigate the details. Johannes Skar has,\nhowever, done this, and there cannot be the least doubt as to his\ndesire and ability to be veracious. Nor is there any one here who\ndoes not say that Knut was an honest man. He lived to be 89 1\nyears old, he received all who came to him, the whole country-side\nknew him, I might almost say by heart, and as to his honesty\nthere is only one opinion, alike among the old, who had known\nhim from a child, and those of middle age, who could not have\nbeen affected by the strong impression produced by his first appearance\nand ill-treatment. Here there is only one voice concerning him.\nDifferences may be heard, notably as to the significance of his\nabnormal powers ; but about himself and his honesty there is\nunanimity. I may perhaps add that the officials, such as priests and\nmagistrates, who met him in the last generation, were just as\nconvinced of his honesty as we are ourselves.\n\" I do not mean to say that he may not have been subject to\nself-deception ; as to that, every one can form his own opinion. But\nenough remains, partly clear of self-deception, partly mingled with\nit, and yet equally wonderful, equally unexplained.\n\"Unexplained. Yes, there are plenty of explanations ; I have my\nown in partial readiness. But I will reserve it, for I desire only\nto set out a perfectly accurate record for those who desire to enter\nin by material and spiritual paths where research is to this day\nstill behindhand.\"\nKnut the son of Rasmus, called, in the Norwegian fashion, Nord-\ngarden from the name of his farm, was born in 1793. He was a\nweakly and backward boy, suffering from constant epileptic fits ; the\nlittle schooling he received left him unable to read and write when\nhe entered upon the hard work of a remote and poor farm, to help\nhis mother, now a widow. He succeeded, however, in teaching\nhimself reading, writing and arithmetic, and became an eager student\nof the Bible. His hard life brought on a return of his epilepsy,\nafter a temporary remission, and he allowed himself to resort to\n\" witchcraft \" as a remedy. The grotesque but innocent charms to\nwhich he had recourse produced a religious revulsion, and he was\ntempted to take the life which he had thus dishonoured. He\n1\nBj6rnson's dates are self-contradictory. According to Skar's explicit\nstatement, Knut died on May 16, 1876 (not 1877), aged 83 years, 5 months\nand 2 days.\n\f138 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part\ndetermined, however, to seek forgiveness for his sin by partaking of\nthe communion. Divine service was to be held in the little church\nat Svastum six weeks after Christmas, 1818. But three days before he\nhad to take to his bed, a prey to racking pains. When the crisis\npassed, he heard harp-playing in the air and spiritual songs. Later\nhe seemed to hear violins and clarinets, but they clung to the\nearth, while the spiritual choir had \" sung up to the skies.\" He\nremembered what they sang j\nthey bade him, in uncouth verse, cast\naway the charm he wore round his neck, and trust to God's\nmedicines, Jesus' flesh and blood. It is noteworthy that all the\nverses he heard, now aud later, were composed not in the peasant\ndialect which he spoke all his life, but in the literary Danish, the\nlanguage of his Bible.\nFrom the time he threw away his amulet the epilepsy left him,\nand his health was for a long time good. But henceforth from time\nto time he continued to hear, first indistinct music, \" war music\n\"\nas he called it, then \" clear sweet tunes of all sorts,\" which always\nat last ended in psalms\u2014stiff uncouth admonitions in dry incorrect\nliterary language.\nPeople told him that he ought to be bled \u2014his blood was too\nthick. He wanted to do as they said, but on the way \" it sang\n\"\nthat he must not, and he had to return. \" It went through his\nears\" that it was his sin, and not thick blood, from which he\nneeded relief.\nIt was only late in the spring that he could leave his bed and sit in\nthe sun before his hut. He \" got command \" to take a psalm book and\nfollow with his fingers as the psalms were sung to him. When he\ngot strong, he got command to go to others and arouse them from\nsin. This frightened him ; he was afraid they would talk about\nhis \" thick blood.\" But he was told that he must hold out till he\nhad been to the Lord's Supper ; then all would be well with him.\nSoon something fresh appeared. He could sit and \" hear \" what was\ngoing on far away, even in foreign lands : and when news came, perhaps\nlong afterwards, it had happened as he said. A man had been lost\non the mountains\u2014he told where. He told too where strayed\nanimals were to be found. On a farm where there was no good\nwater he told them where to dig. And all this repeatedly.\nMoreover, he cured illness by laying on his hands. When he came\nto the seat of disease \"his hand stuck fast,\" and then he kneaded\nwith the other, shivering and writhing. He ground his teeth, and\nfoam came about his mouth. Then he prayed, and the patient\n\fLIV.] Vis-Knut. 139\ntoo had to pray aloud ;\n\" for if God would not help, nothing could\nhelp.\"\nIt is easy to see what effect this must have had upon the country.\nThe revolution in thought had spread even to these remote valleys.\nThe minister of Gausdal was an apostle of enlightenment, and\nhad published a book for the use of the young in place of\nLuther's Catechism, substituting morality for faith. Christianity had\ngrown cold. But when it came to the touch, the old proved\nstronger than the new, and a spark sufficed to kindle a blaze of\nreligion. It became known that Knut was to go to church on\nJune 7, when service was again to be held at Svastum, and that\nhe had been told he would fall down on the church floor, and lie\nthere two hours. The whole neighbourhood assembled for the\nservice. Knut went into the sacristy, sat on the minister's bench,\nand announced his mission. The minister thought he was mad,\nand sat in patience while Knut sang psalms of admonition to him\nfor nearly an hour. At last service began. But Knut was seized\nwith convulsions because the hymns were sung out of a new-fangled\nhymn-book\u2014a book which Knut could not even touch without\nviolent physical disturbance. The singing stopped, and the old\nfavourite hymn-book had to be used. Knut was then able to kneel\nfor the communion, but two of his brothers had to lead him back,\nand he fell motionless on the church floor. The service was\nstopped. The minister wished to have him carried out, but he\nbegged that he might lie in \" God's temple.\" At last he was taken\ninto the churchyard, and laid on the ground; the convulsions came\non so violently that he was thrown up into the air; between the\nattacks he prayed and the people sang. The minister came out,\nand explained to the people that Knut was in the same state as\nthey were when they dreamed. Knut prayed for him.\nHe went in the evening to a neighbouring farm, and stayed two\nnights. On the Tuesday he \" got command \" to take the sexton,\nhis old schoolmaster, to the church, and have the bells rung for\nhim. He then went in and lay two hours on the church floor\n\u2014\nthe promised period, which had been cut short on the Sunday.\nAs he was going to the church, taking a short cut over the rough\nhillside, a woman saw, as she stated in a formal deposition, that\nthere was a shining light over the path he took. When he came\naway, he got the sexton to write down from his dictation the\nhymns that had been \"sung to him\" as he lay, a long series of\ncommands for reform in the church and morals, ending with the\n\f140 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part\nwarning that if they were not carried out, \"pestilence and bloody\nwar \" would come upon the land ; and this he was ordered to send,\nand did send, to the Council at Christiania.\nChurch discipline in Norway was at this time very severe. A\nrevivalist named Hans Nilsen Hauge had recently been imprisoned,\nwith some of his disciples, for propagating doctrines not recognised\nby the Theological Faculty of Christiania. None the less Knut,\nafter the scene in Svastum church, devoted his life to preaching\nthe word, and was involved in constant trouble with the authorities,\ncivil and clerical. He was arrested in Frou, and the local magistrate\nattempted to enforce his return home. But Knut had convulsions\nand grew stiff in one leg, so that he could not be led. More men\nwere sent for, but he grew stiff all over, and could only be moved\nstep by step in great suffering. He prayed, and men and women\nfollowed. Among them was a giant named Imort Nerlid. the\nstrongest man in the country, and devoted to Knut like a child.\nHe begged Knut for permission to set him free, but Knut refused.\nAt last Knut sank to the ground, and a sledge was sent for. He\nwas laid on it, but had a convulsion which threw him off. This\nhappened repeatedly ; once he was nearly thrown into a river by\nwhich they were passing. At last the attempt was abandoned\nfor the moment. Worn out though he was, he held a service\nthe same evening, and sang to the assembled crowd a hymn\nwhich must have made a great impression, as one man who was\nthere learnt it by heart from hearing it once sung, and was able to\nrecite it fifty years afterwards.\nMeantime the military had been sent for. A captain and two\nlieutenants brought seven men with loaded guns. The officers finding\nthe service still proceeding, went to a neighbouring house to dance\nand play cards, and forgot about Knut till midnight. He was\nroused from bed and tied to the sledge with a rope. He had such\na violent attack that the rope was loosened. He was tied tighter,\nand another attack threw him between the horse's legs. Finally\nhe was secured and carried home by stages, and as each set of men\nhanded him over to the next he bade them farewell, praised God,\nand prayed for them.\nHe had hardly reached home when Imort Nerlid came with a\nmessage from the people of Fron begging him to come back and stay\nwith them, and promising to protect him. He was afraid, but was\n\" commanded \" to go, and next Sunday found him in church there.\nThe feeling in his favour was so strong that there was almost a\n\fLIV.] Vis-Knut. 141\npopular outbreak against the minister and the man who had forced\nhim on to the sledge. The attitude of the congregation was such\nthat it was thought better to leave Knut alone.\nThe people of Fron were determined that he should stay with\nthem. The giant, Imort Nerlid, sold him half his own farm for a\nnominal sum. When Imort himself subsequently left. Knut sold\nhis half for a good price, and invested it in an annuity. He longed\nfor the home of his childhood. But for many years he got but\nlittle from his annuity, for he was summoned and condemned for\nillegal medical practice (though he never took payment, and could\nhave done no man harm) and for illegal religious teaching. The\nfine and costs which he had to pay took up the whole income of\nhis annuity for many years. Of course he did not give up the\nhealing and preaching which was commanded him. He lived at\nSvastum unmarried and in the most frugal way, At first he often\ntravelled in the country ; later only rarely. Till he could enjoy his\nannuity he lived by day labour.\nHe never attempted to found a sect of his own ; he always taught\nthat men should follow the teaching of the church\u2014the old teaching,\nof course\u2014and attend the orthodox services. Hence he was attacked\neven more bitterly by the followers of Hans Nilgen Hauge than by\nthe orthodox ministers. The \" saints \" even accused him of imposture,\nwhich was never done by the officials. But Knut never replied ;\nhis nature was too mild, aud his very mildness thus gave rise to\nmisunderstandings. But he went his own way, always cheerful\nand patient, happy with the simplest pleasures, in spite of the jeers\nalike of believers and unbelievers.\nHis preaching was pure improvisation in homely speech. At times\nhe could \"get nothing\"; once he began with the words \"The\nungodly,\" and could get no further; at other times he seemed\ninexhaustible. The effect he produced is witnessed by the visions\nwhich his hearers saw ; one saw him sit reading the Bible in the\nevening with a rainbow from one shoulder to the other ; others\nsaw \"two white birds on his right shoulder.\" No doubt his striking\nappearance had something to do with this, but the main cause was\nthe belief of the people that he could cure them by laying on his\nhands, could find things that had been lost, and tell what was\nbeing done by persons far away.\nHe believed himself that all this power was God's gift, and that\nGod had need of him. He used to say that \"the prophets had the\nsame as he.\" When he could not touch gold, silver or copper money\n\f142 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part\nwithout being seized by cramp, it was God's command to shew that\nmoney was to be refused. This is an account given in evidence\nbefore a court of what happened in such a case :\n\" I put two-\ncopper coins in his open hand. His arm gave a jerk, he writhed\nand grinned. He declared that a sinew in his arm had strained\nitself. I saw on looking at his arm that a sinew beneath it was\nquite hard ; a knot was visible in his hand. As soon as the coins\nwere taken out and Knut had rubbed his hand, the arm returned\nto its natural condition.\"\nOnce he came to Stamme farm, where the farmer, Jens, was\nlooking for a silver shilling. \" Here is something for you to find,\"'\nhe said to Knut. \"Yes,\" he replied, \"give me another shilling to\nsearch with.\" He took it and put it between two fingers. His\narm jerked it to a crack in the wall, where the lost coin was\nfound.\nHis method of water-finding was as follows. He used to go-\nto what seemed to be the likeliest place, lay the back of his hand\non the ground, and move it along till his fingers jerked ; the water\nwould be below this spot. He had also learnt to find water by\nthe use of\" a twig held firmly in his hand ; when water was below,\nthe twig turned towards his breast. The twig must be of birch,\nor still better, of bird-cherry.\nHe cured sickness by laying on of hands, or rather handling the\nsick. When he reached the seat of the illness, his hand stuck fast ;\nhe seized it with the other hand and rubbed, shuddering the while\nand grating his teeth, while foam came from his mouth, and he\nsuffered greatly. But he never refused where he thought he could\nhelp, and he never took payment. There is also abundant evidence\nthat he gave the sick medicine or sent them to the doctor, or said\nthere was nothing to be done. But it is not easy to ascertain\nwhat were the kinds of illness which he could cure. Here is\none of many tales about him.\nA little girl in Christiania was lame in both feet and had gouty\nnodules on one arm. For ten or eleven years she went on crutches\n;\nthe doctors could do nothing. She was sent to see Knut in 1839,\nat the age of sixteen, accompanied by an elder sister. Knut undressed\nher, handled her all over, and cried out horribly when he came to\nthe seat of the mischief. He went on for an hour ; then he told\nher she could get up, and she stood on her feet, which she had not\ndone since she was five. He told her to use the crutches for a.\nyear, but she gave them up two days after, on the way back. The\n\fLIV.] Vis-Knut. 143\nonly result of her doing so was that one foot remained weaker than\nthe other, but not enough to give any trouble.\nThis story leads up to another of Knut's faculties. The elder\nsister wished to pay him, though she knew that he did not take\nmoney. She had secretly brought with her a little coffee and sugar,\na couple of handkerchiefs, and cloth for a waistcoat\u2014gifts which she\nthought that a frugal peasant would appreciate. These she made\ninto a parcel, and in the middle of it \u2014this was the greatest secret\nof all \u2014she put five dollars. The cure was so successful that she\nthought her gift too small. \" No, no,\" said Knut, without opening\nit, \" take back three dollars, but lend me two for travelling money\nfor a time.\" He afterwards sent a gift in repayment of the sum.\nThe girl's astonishment may be imagined ; but it was still greater\nwhen she spoke to him of her mother's illness. Knut said that\nnothing could be done for it. \"But she has a pain in the foot,\"\nhe added. \"No,\" said the girl. \"Yes,\" said Knut, \"she has pain\nin one of her great toes,\" and he picked up from the ground three\nstraws which were to be tied round the toe, one ever}' week. It\nwas 12 Norse (84 English) miles to Christiania, without telegraph or\nrailway. When the girls got home, and the recovered daughter\nwas about to spring into her mother's arms, she stopped ; the mother\nwas ill. One of her great toes was so bad that it had turned black,\na dark streak went right up to her knee. But the straws cured her.\n(Communicated by the younger daughter).\nA woman sent her maid to him one day to ask about a serious\nillness. She gave the girl some wool as a present for him. The\ngirl thought on the way that there was too much wool, and took and\nhid some for herself when she was in the forest. She found Knut\nvery cheerful. He said that he could do nothing for her mistress, and\nshe must take the present back ; but she was not to forget what\nshe had put under the old birch-root in the forest.\nIn 1874 a man disappeared from Biri, 30 or 40 English miles\nfrom Knut. His wife, the last person who had spoken to him, took\nfright (they had parted in anger) \u2014and got sixty men to help her\nto search for him, but in vain. A messenger was sent to Knut.\nKnut asked no questions about the neighbourhood, which he did\nnot know. When told that the wife was the last who had seen\nhim, \"Yes,\" said Knut, \"they parted bad friends.\" When asked\nwhat had become of him, Knut said that he had killed himself.\n\" How,\" asked the messenger. \" He is hanging north-west of his\nhome,\" said Knut. \" But they have searched there.\" \" Yes, you\n\f144 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part\nsearched where his wife left him. But when the wife turned\naway, the husband followed her, and hung himself nearer the house.\nHe is hanging in a great pine tree.

He had an aunt there, with whom he was to stay. But no\nnews came of his arrival, and his mother grew anxious. She went\nto see Knut, coming to him at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of\nJuly 6. To her question whether he had arrived she received after\na long time the answer \" I do not get that either.\" She was\ndistressed and asked no more that evening. Next morning she\nasked Knut what had happened to her son. Knut was very happy.\n\" Yes, now it is certain that the boy is with his aunt, and quite\nwell. He has been well all the time.\" A letter written on July 12\nconfirmed this. The boy had reached his aunt's at 9 p.m. on\nJuly 6 (3 a.m. on July 7 by Norwegian time).\nSimon Hovde at Oejer had a son called Mikkel, who ran away\nwhen 19 years old. His elder brother Klement went one Saturday\nto Knut to hear where Mikkel was. He borrowed a carriole on\nthe way and drove a fast horse. He reached Knut's house at 3 or\n4 in the afternoon. Knut had just come home from fishing in a\nmountain lake ; he had felt that some one was coming on an\nimportant errand, and that he must return at once. Klement began\nhis story. \"I know why you have come,\" said Knut, \"but do not\nlet us mind that this evening.\" So they went to bed ; Klement\ncould not sleep for anxiety. In the night Knut said \"Your\nbrother has just come home ; I hear you are awake, so I must\ntell you. \u2014Now his father and mother are asking where he has been.\nI can tell you. He went first to Lillehammer. There he met the\nfarmer of Kjos at Ringsaker, and took a situation with him.\" Knut\ndescribed the sort of work, and added that the boy did not like it\n;\n\" what he liked least was that he had to sleep in the stable.\" So\nKlement started home ; Knut telling him \" the boy will not stay long\nwith you ; better let him travel, for he is restless and must have\nhis try.\" When Klement came to the place where he had borrowed\nhis carriole, all the people crowded round him and asked what\nKnut had said ;\nthey had heard that Mikkel had come home in\nthe night, and wanted to see if Knut knew it. When Klement got\nhome he heard that all that Knut had told him was true. This\nwas in 1855 ; in 1856 Mikkel weut off to America.\n\fLIV.] Vis-Knut. 145\nIn 1 828 he was at Tallaug in Gansdal. The son of the house\nslept in his room one night, and relates as follows. \" Knut was\nrestless all night, he read and prayed from time to time. I could\nnot sleep either ; I was afraid, and he was so ugly. At sunrise I\ngot up. '\nI have been restless all night,' said Knut, '\nand you\nhave not slept either ? I must tell you, a man has come for me\nduring the night from Saxumdal, and wants to speak to me. It is\na good thing you are up ;\nyou can tell him to come here directly ;\nhe is lying on the bench in the hall.' But Knut and I slept on\nthe first floor at the opposite end of the house ; neither of us could\nhave heard the man come to the hall. There was the stranger on\nthe bench ; I followed him up to Knut. He had hardly come in,\nand had not got out a word, when Knut told him that he could\nnot help him in what he came about ; the man must go to a\ndoctor.\"\nIn the spring of 1835, he was well-sinking at Huseby in Hede-\nmark. \" It will be a busy Easter for you,\" he said to the housewife\non Good Friday. She thought people would stay at home for the\nholiday. \" No, no, there will be plenty of people coming from the\neast to-morrow,\" he said. On the Saturday fourteen people came\nfrom Odal to see him ;\nthey had heard that he was there. At this\nperiod he always had this presentiment when people were coming\nto him.\nSome years ago a well was needed at Skar, the home of Knut's\nbiographer, where Knut had never been. At this time Knut had\nceased to go about, and those who wanted anything had to go to\nhim. A messenger was accordingly sent to Knut to ask where\nthey should dig. \"What?\" said Knut, \"do they send here for\nwater when they have got water everywhere ? \" \" Yes, for there is\nno water near the farm.\" \" There is water enough at the farm\nyou come from ;\nthey have a well already, only dig deeper and\nthere is water enough.\" \"But they want to have a pump right\nin the farm.\" \"There is a dell above the farm; do you know\nwhere it is? There is a road there.\" \"No, the high road does\nnot go through a dell.\" Knut :\n\" It is not a high road, it looks\nlike a cattle road.\" \"Yes, that is right.\" Knut: \"There is a\nbig birch tree in the dell ; under it there is a spot where the grass\ndoes not bind. That is where the vein of water starts.\" The man\nremembered this. \" But they have water still nearer the farm,\"\ncontinued Knut ;\n\" the store-house stands southwards above the farm ;\na little house stands at the side; a vein passes under it.\" \"That\nK\n\f146 Walter Leaf, Litt.D. [part\nmust be the wood-shed, then,\" said the man. \"No,\" said Knut,\n\"it looks like a store.\" \"Then it must be the forage-house.\" \"Yes,\nit is the forage-house.\" Knut did not stop here. \"Most of the\nwater,\" he said \" comes from the north of the farm. A stream runs\nthrough a hill-side. It comes from a swallow-hole above the hill.\nYou must have seen, it comes both in the corn-field and below it.\"\n\"They had a well there before,\" said the man; \"but it did not hold\nout.\" \" Because the water passes two or three yards above where\nthe well was ;\nvery little of the water soaked into the well.\" The\nman asked where digging would be easiest and shallowest. \" Try\nfor yourself with a rod till you find out.\" \" But we might make\na mistake.\" \"Yes, yes; the vein is close to the surface just where\nit comes out of the hill ; then it goes three or four rods north of\nthe stable ; that is the best place to dig.\" There they dug, and\nthere the well is to this day. This conversation shows how he\ngradually conceived the place in imagination, at first only vaguely,\nand then with more and more distinctness.\nHe used sometimes to make mistakes, especially in his later\nyears ; some men once dug for silver on his distinct and repeated\nadvice, but the vein was too thin and they made a heavy loss. He\nused also to make mistakes in telling where a lost animal was to be\nfound. He used to put this down to the fact that the animal had\nnot stayed till they came. But it also happened that he declared\nan animal to be dead when it was not dead, and vice versa. In\nsome cases it may have been that his directions were misunderstood,\nbut there is no doubt that sometimes the mistake was his. If he\nwas asked how this came about, he used to reply that he only\nsaid \" what he got,\" \" what was whispered to his ear,\" and he used\nto add, \"they generally say that it is right.\" If he was asked, as\nhappened once or twice, whether the \"Tempter\" had not been making\nhim use his gift wrongly, he admitted that the Tempter might have\n\"fooled\" him; but added that he was sure that he had never con-\nsciously misused his \" gift of grace \" or employed it for gain. If he is\nto be suspected of vanity, he must have enjoyed his satisfaction in\nsolitude ; for the last half of his life he passed almost as a hermit,\nand if he received a visitor, he used to talk about God's wisdom,\ngoodness and omnipotence\u2014seldom, and then reluctantly, about\nhimself.\n\" For my own part I fancy that if he had been less kind-hearted\nhe would seldom have made a mistake ; he wanted to do good\nbeyond his pDwers, and often yielded to insistence, but he could\n\fLIV.] Vis-Knut. 147\nnot '\nget it ' when he was tired or out of sorts.

But I add one not given by Bjornson, as by a curious\ncoincidence it has proved capable of confirmation.\n\"An Englishman, Captain R. Cartcath, stayed a long time in\n1868 at Kvisberg in Upper Svastum, headhunting. He was\nexpecting a friend, C. Ferran, to go up to Dovre with him ; but\nFerran was so late in coming that Cartcath thought he must\nhave taken the direct road through Gudbrandsdalen.\n\"One day when he was out shooting, Per Kvisberg went with\nhim to the '\nWaters-end '\nin Essdalen.

By\nC. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D., Aberdeen. Fifth Edition. 10s. 6d. net.\n(Bailliere, Tindall & Cox. London, 1907.)\nAn interesting feature of the present edition of Dr. Lloyd\nTuckey's book is an introductory chapter by Sir Francis Cruise, in\nwhich he relates how he, like most of the medical men in these\nislands who use hypnotism in their practice, was introduced to the\nsubject by Liebeault and Bernheim. To some of Sir F. Cruise's\nremarks we shall recur later. The book itself, which is much\nenlarged from the earlier edition, contains a sober and comprehen-\nsive statement of the present position and achievements of hypnotism\nin therapeutics. Illustrative cases are quoted, some from the\nauthor's practice, some from those of continental physicians, of the\ntreatment of a long list of complaints by this method, amongst\nthem dyspepsia, neurasthenia, chorea, torticollis, neuralgia, writer's\ncramp, chronic rheumatism, epilepsy, functional paraplegia, agora-\nphobia and other obsessing ideas, and a long list of hysterical and\nnervous ailments. Probably the most interesting class of cases\nreferred to is that of chronic alcoholism. Dr. Tuckey says that he\nhas treated in the last eighteen years over 300 cases, and has\neffected a complete cure in about one-third of the whole number.\nThis proportion almost exactly coincides with the proportion of cures\neffected during the year 1899 in the Dalrymple Home, Rickmans-\nworth, viz., 169 out of 518 cases. As Dr. Tuckey points out, the\nnumber of cures may seem insignificant alongside of infallible\nsystems, mostly of American origin, which claim over 90 per cent, of\nsuccesses. The difference lies in the fact that, in the physician's cases,\nthe cures are permanent. In Dr. Tuckey's practice the patients\nare under observation, I gather, for at least a year, after which\n\f150 Frank Pochnore. [part\ndate relapses appear to be very infrequent. It is to be wished\nthat he could have found time to bring up to date the interesting\ntable given on pp. 237-9, showing particulars and results of the\ntreatment from 1888 to 1895. Dr. Tuckey has been too fully\nengaged in his practice to allow of opportunity for experiment with\na view to throwing light on the problems of hypnotism. Nor has\nhe apparently observed any case of thought-transference or other\nsupernormal faculty in his patients. He has indeed had under\ntreatment three or four \" mediums,\" but he found that they all\nrefused to accept his suggestions, and were apparently very intractable\npatients. One lady indeed insisted, when hypnotised, on taking charge\nof the seance. An interesting case of double personality is given.\n\"I have recently (1899) met with a curious case of double\npersonality. The patient is a bank clerk, aged 40, with a record\nof over twenty years' satisfactory service. He left the bank on\nFriday after lunch, and did not return until the following Monday,\nwhen he found he had been suspended for absence without leave.\nHe could give no explanation of his conduct beyond that he had\nfound himself late on Saturday night in a strange hotel at\nSouthampton. How he got there he did not know, but he found\nin his pocket some postal orders issued at Guildford, so he con-\ncluded he had visited that town. I hypnotised him, and he at once\nbecame somnambulic. He replied to questions, and gradually gave\nus a complete history of his doings from the time he left the bank\nuntil he 'came to himself at Southampton. He had gone first to\ncall on a friend at the West End, and then on another friend in\nthe suburbs. He had spent Friday night in a Temperance Hotel,\nand had gone to the station in the morning, and taken the first\ntrain, which happened to be going to Guildford. There he alighted\nand had breakfast. The previous day he had changed a cheque, so\nhe had ten pounds in gold in his purse. This he found heavy, so\nhe exchanged the sovereigns for postal orders. Then he felt he\nshould like some sea-air, and took the train to Southampton, where\nhe formed the plan of taking a coasting steamer to Dublin, a trip\nhe had formerly made with enjoyment. He strolled about Southamp-\nton, behaving much as an ordinary visitor, and engaged a room at\na hotel. At the hotel he suddenly 'came to himself,\n1\nand was\nastonished to find himself in a strange place. He was just in time\nto catch the last train to London, where he stayed the night,\nand then returned to his anxious family in the country the following\nmorning. His friends were naturally somewhat sceptical, and it\n\fLIV.] Reviews. 151\nwas perhaps fortunate for him that some of them had heard of\ndouble consciousness\" (pp. 105-6).\nIt is interesting to note that Dr. Tuckey finds that about 80\nper cent, of the patients treated by him are amenable to hypnotic\nsuggestion, about 15 per cent, to the extent of somnambulism\n(p. 176. See also p. 178).\nIt will be seen that Dr. Tuckey's book, though full of interest\nand instruction for his medical brethren, for all actual or possible\npatients, and for all who are interested in the cure of human ills,\ncontains in itself little of special value for the student of our\nsubject. Its real value for us lies in the demonstration which it\naffords that the world still moves\u2014that even the British medical\nworld is capable of assimilating a new idea. For consider the\nfacts. The phenomena of which the present book treats have been\nbefore the civilised world\u2014to go back no farther than the time of\nMesmer\u2014for considerably over a century. During the whole of\nthat period, with brief intermissions, they have been the subject\nof systematic study in one or another continental country. In 1831\na committee of the Royal Academy of Medicine at Paris\u2014one of\nthe first medical societies in Europe\u2014reported that the phenomena\nwere genuine, and likely to prove useful in therapeutics. Even at\nthat date it was pointed out that \"England, the land of the\nimmortal Newton,\" had, alone of civilised countries, refused to take\nany interest in the subject. With the exception of a brief interlude\nin the decade 1840-50, which produced practically no effect on the\nofficial medical world, our proud isolation continued until some 15\nor 20 years ago. Liebeault's first book was published in 1866.\nRichet wrote upon the subject in 1875. Thenceforward men of\nscience everywhere on the continent began to study the subject and\nto publish their researches. But in 1882, in the first manifesto of\nthe Society, we felt ourselves bound to include \" hypnotism and the\nforms of the so-called mesmeric trance, with its alleged insensibility\nto pain,\" amongst the \" debatable phenomena \" which we proposed\nto study.\nIn 1889 Dr. Tuckey wrote that he could find no literature in\nEnglish on the subject; and a year later Moll, in the introductory\nchapter to his handbook of hypnotism, amongst a crowd of\nforeigners, cites no English investigators later than Braid, with the\nsolitary exception of the Society for Psychical Research. In the\nearly years of the experiments conducted by the Society's Committee\non Mesmerism, the subject was, in fact, practically unknown. Medical\n\f152 Frank Poclmore. [part\nmen would come to our rooms to see a boy's bod}' stiffened and\nlaid across two chairs, or to test the \" alleged insensibility \" in the\ntrance by driving pins into him. And even so, the demonstrations\nproduced little effect. In 1894 Lord Kelvin was able to write that\n\"one-half of hypnotism and clairvoyance is imposture and the rest\nbad observation.\" But in the previous year a Committee of the\nBritish Association had already reported that they had convinced\nthemselves of the genuineness of the hypnotic state. In the mean-\ntime Sir Francis Cruise, Dr. Bramwell, Dr. Tuckey and others had\nbeen to Nancy, and had commenced to employ hypnotic methods\nin their ordinary practice.\nEven now the prejudice against the subject, as appears from the\npresent book, is not quite dispelled. Sir F. Cruise tells us in\nthe preface that when, in 1891, he read his first paper on\nhypnotism before a Dublin Medical Society he was \" earnestly and\nkindly warned to abandon a dangerous subject.\" It is, however,\npleasant to learn that his courage in disregarding that warning has\nmet with its reward. Dr. Tuckey tells of a case of a young lady who\nrefused to try hypnotism as a means of cure, because she had been\nwarned against it by her medical attendant. In another case a young\nman, afflicted with an irresistible craving for food, preferred to enter as\na voluntary boarder in a lunatic asylum rather than risk the\nunknown dangers of hypnotism. And the case of a patient of Dr.\nTuckey's, himself a country doctor, is full of instruction. He was\nso impressed by the result of the treatment in his own case \"that he\ntook up hypnotism enthusiastically, and began to use it with his\npatients. He performed two or three minor operations under\nhypnotic anaesthesia ; and relieved many cases of insomnia,\nneuralgia, and nervous troubles generally. But the village in which\nhe lived was exceptionally antiquated, and the people would have\nnone of the '\nnew witchcraft.' Dr. S. found he was looked at\naskance and began to lose his practice. Being a family man, and\na sensible one, he argued that, if his patients didn't want the best\ntreatment he could offer them, it was not for him to force it on\nthem to his own ruin. So he wrote a letter to the greatest gossip\nof the neighbourhood, renouncing his advocacy of hypnotism, and\nundertaking never again to use it in the place. He has his reward\"\n(p. 209). But a \" Medical Society for the Study of Hypnotism\n\"\nhas recently been founded, with Dr. Tuckey as President, and we\nmay soon hope to see knowledge on the subject spread more\nrapidly among the profession and their patients.\n\fReviews. 153\nThere is however another aspect of the movement in England which\npossesses some interest for us. I said above that Dr. Tuckey's\nbook affords a demonstration that English medical men are capable\nof assimilating a new idea. I should perhaps have said \"a new\nfact,\" for it is noteworthy that even now few medical men in these\nislands show any interest in the theoretical side of the subject-\nin its bearings upon psychological, legal, or even physiological\nproblems. Dr. Tuckey has made no experiment and put forward\nno theory of his own. After discussing current theories at length,\nand showing that none has yet won predominant recognition, he\nadopts the practical conclusion: \"But we know at least as much\nabout the action of hypnotism as we do about that of many drugs\nwhich we use every day \"\n(p. 279).\nSir F. Cruise is even more emphatic in his view: \"I shall not\nattempt to theorise or offer any explanation of [these] extraordinary\nresults. I have long ago arrived at that period of mental develop-\nment\u2014for good or ill \u2014at which I have ceased to attempt explana-\ntion. If a body falls to the earth, I call it, as I have been taught,\ngravitation. That word expresses a fact, but explains nothing. I\nknow that quinine lowers temperature and cures some neuralgias,\nthat aloes purge, and that opium checks the purging. Of the why\nand wherefore I know nothing. So I also must acknowledge as to\nthe power of suggestion in hypnosis. . . . Explanation there is none,\nno more than of the countless processes of physical science which\nwe see pass before us daily. It seems to me more profitable, with\nour present means of knowledge, to observe and treasure up facts,\nespecially when they help us to cure or relieve disease \"\n(p. xv.).\nI don't know whether or no Sir F. Cruise may be claimed as\nan Englishman ; but at any rate the mental attitude revealed in\nthe above extract is commonly regarded as typically British, betraying\nalike the strength and the weakness of the British character. The\nexistence of that attitude explains how it comes about that, apart\nfrom some brilliant experiments by Dr. Milne Bramwell, almost the\nonly English names of recent years which can be added to the long\nlist of continental investigators are those of Edmund Gurney and\nFrederic Myers. And this brings before us an interesting question.\nHypnotism for some generations occupied the place which is now\nfilled by telepathy, the Dreyfus case of science, in Mr. Schiller's happy\nphrase. Twice have the facts of hypnotism seemed in a fair way\nto become established : first in the decade which saw the appearance\nof Bertrand's books and the Report of the Second French Commission\n;\n\f154 Frank Poclmore. [part\nsecondly, in the time of Esdaile, Elliotson and Braid. In the first\nperiod the hopes of the new science were frustrated by the untimely\ndeath of Bertrand, and still more by the political unrest prevailing\nin France. In the second period the discovery\n\u2014\ninfelix opportunitate\u2014\nof chloroform and other anaesthetics robbed the new facts of their\nchief practical interest, and the whole subject was shortly afterwards\ndiscredited by its association with spiritualism. But now that\nhypnotism seems at last to have come to its own, we may\nprofitably enquire what lesson we can draw from the long struggle,\nwhat hope for the future establishment of telepathy.\nHypnotism owes its establishment, broadly speaking, to three\ncircumstances, or, to put it the other way, its general acceptance\nwas delayed until three conditions had been fulfilled, viz.\n:\n(1) It is of great practical value in medicine.\n(2) Its phenomena are readily reproducible.\n(3) It can be explained in physical terms, i.e., though its place in\nthe psycho-physiological scheme has not been exactly determined, it\noffers obvious analogies to spontaneous states previously familiar,\nand there can be little reasonable doubt that, broadly speaking,\nits phenomena are due to some form of inhibition.\nIt would take too long to show in detail that these conditions\nhave only been fully satisfied of recent years. But (1) its general\nutility in therapeutics was first established by the publication of\nLiebeault's book in 1866. The earlier practitioners had devoted\ntoo much attention, on the one hand, to the production of analgesia,\nwhich the discovery of chloroform robbed of its chief value ;\non\nthe other hand, to dubious experiments in transmission of mesmeric\nfluid, community of sensation, and so on.\n(2) It seems probable that the production of the somnambulic state,\nat any rate, has been found much easier in recent years. This\nstate was first definitely recognised and described by Puysegur in a\nbook which was not published until 1807, nearly 30 years after\nMesmer had begun to practise in Paris, and even so late as 1831\nthe Second French Commission reported that the state was of rare\noccurrence.\n(3) It will not be thought necessary to labour the third point.\nIt may never be possible to demonstrate any practical utility in\nthe study of telepathy. It may be years before systematic\nexperiment leads us to such mastery over the conditions that we\ncan reproduce the phenomena with something like the facility with\nwhich we can now throw a subject into a somnambulic trance. And\n\fLIV.] Revietvs. 155\nit is on that very condition that real progress in arriving at an\nexplanation no doubt mainly depends.\nAnd there are, it must be admitted, in the existing state of our\nknowledge considerable difficulties in the way of adopting any\nphysical explanation yet suggested. These difficulties have been\nforcibly set forth in at least two Presidential addresses. Certainly\nif telepathic transmission is effected by means of ethereal vibrations,\nthe force diminishing, as in the case of other physical energies, in\nthe ratio of the square of the distance, it is difficult to conceive\nhow an impulse which in our experiments at close quarters seems\nbarely able to produce its effect when agent and percipient are\nseparated by a wall or a door, should even under the most\nfavourable circumstances, and when the disturbance is presumably of\na much more massive character, be sufficiently intense to bridge a\ngulf which may amount to hundreds or thousands of miles. But it\nis the part of wisdom to possess our souls in patience, and not to\nassume too soon that the problem is insoluble in physical terms, and\ndemands, therefore, a transcendental explanation. After all, the\nmain premiss for such a conclusion\u2014our own ignorance\u2014may\nany day be removed by the further progress of research : a process\nwhich has happened again and again with kindred problems, once\nheld to be equally secure against explanation in physical terms. It is\nnot so very long ago that the phenomena of animal life were\nthought to stand outside the physical world ; the very substances\nof which animal tissues are composed were supposed to owe their\nphysical properties to a principle of vitality. But chemists can now\nbuild up out of the bricks and mortar of the inorganic many of\nthese once-mysterious organic compounds. They have not yet, it is\ntrue, built up, even in the humblest protozoon, the cathedral of\nlife ; but all architects must have time to learn their trade. Again,\nthe activities of man, especially those activities which are accom-\npanied by consciousness and will, were for long thought to be\noutside the physical world. But the case is so far altered that the\nburden of proof is now shifted to the other side. The philosopher\nwho should claim to interpolate a psychical link in the chain of\nphysical processes which connect nerve-stimulus with action would\nfind it difficult to meet the challenge of the physiologist. AVe\nhave grounds for hoping, then, that if we are content to wait, the\ndifficulties in the way of a physical explanation of telepathy may\ndiminish, if not altogether disappear ; and meanwhile the hypothesis\nis in no worse case than is, or was until recently, the hypothesis\n\f156 Frank Podmore. [part\nof gravitation. In the case of telepathy there is little difficulty, as\nSir W. Crookes has shown, in conceiving of a physical mechanism ;\nthe difficulty is to account for the energy not diminishing more\nrapidly as the distance increases (Proc. XIV. pp. 3, 4). The force\nof gravitation, on the other hand, diminishes in the ratio of the\nsquare of the distance, but the only physical explanations of its\naction yet suggested are so cumbrous, and involve such large\nassumptions, as to be little more than curiosities of speculation.\nBut I speak as a layman. Perhaps the recent discovery that atoms\nare not, after all, atomic, and that their constituent particles may,\nunder certain conditions, move freely through space, has rendered\nthe corpuscular theory of gravitation more plausible. If so, the\nomen is a happy augury for telepathy. Some forthcoming results\nin science may perhaps throw light upon our problem.\nFrank Podmore.\nHypnotism or Suggestion and Psychotherapy, by Dr. August Forel,\ntranslated from the fifth German Edition by H.

Professor Forel's position in the medical\nand scientific world lends great weight to his opinions, and the\nfact that this is a translation of the fifth German edition proves\nthat they are the result of matured experience and thought.\nThe first chapters are devoted to the physiology and psychology\nof hypnosis and allied states, and as the author asserts that the\nreader who takes the trouble to study, and has the intelligence to\nunderstand his theories will be able to grasp the subject not merely\npartially and empirically, but fully and scientifically, one is put on\none's mettle. It is unfortunately by no means easy to follow all the\narguments : this difficulty arising partly from undue compression\nand his taking too much preliminary knowledge for granted ; and\npartly, perhaps, from occasional faulty translation. 1\nDr. Forel accepts the mneme theory of Richard Semon and adopts\nhis nomenclature. The mneme he explains as the sum total of the\ninherited and acquired engrams, and by engrams he means the\n1\nFor instance, page 164, we read \"How does the conceited mass of voters\nstand towards superficial gossip, and the frequently systemized perversion of\nthe half-educated, who so often take upon themselves, as journalists, to judge\ncustoms and to teach the world ?\n\"\n\fLIV.] Reviews. 157\npermanent changes which take place in the susceptible substance of\nthe living organism, owing to the passage of molecular activity\nwaves or neurokymes. He uses the term ecphoria to express the\nrepeated production of the whole condition of excitation of the\norganism which is synchronous with the passed complex stimulus,\nand it corresponds to the psychical processes of memory and\nassociation of ideas, and the physiological conditions of automatism,\nontogenesis and phylogenesis. Attention (maximum of our psychical\nactivity) he compares to a shifting functional macula lutea in the\nbrain conditioned by the arrival, concentration, and deflection of\nthe neurokymes ; and he explains the differences between conceived\nand unconceived impressions which make up the conscious and\nsubconscious self. 1\nHe shows how dreams, hallucinations, and\ncasual hypnotic suggestions depend upon unassociated neurokymes,\nand are therefore evanescent in memory and effect. Though he\nsays on page 6 that many processes are only conceived for an\ninstant, and therefore disappear for ever from consciousness, later,\npage 130, he shows how in hypnotic somnambulism the most casual\nthoughts and suggestions can be revived. Forel is a staunch\nupholder of the Nancy school and goes as far as Bernheim in\nexplaining all hypnotic phenomena by suggestion. His views are\nstrongly anti-spiritualistic, and he even considers telepathy as\nunproved, though he acknowledges the value of the evidence collected\nby the S.P.R. in that direction.\nSome of his analogies are very happy. For instance, to explain\nthe difficulty of hypnotising people of ill-regulated and disorderly\nminds, he compares the struggle of a suggested idea to dominate\nconsciousness, to the attempt of an orator to influence a crowd.\nIf the people are orderly he has no difficulty in swaying them\nby his eloquence, but if they are so excited and noisy that he\ncannot get their attention even for a moment, the most accomplished\ndemagogue is powerless, and is himself swept off his feet by\nthe mob. But some of his assertions seem open to criticism, as,\nfor instance, when he says that it matters not at all ultimately\nwhether he hypnotises a patient so as to feel no pain from the\n1\nForel thinks that vastly more peripheral stimuli travel up to the brain\nthan are felt, and he denies that thought or other psychical processes can exist\nwithout sensory stimulation. Neurokymes arriving at the brain are deflected\nto the centre most functionally active, and he thus explains the action of expectant\nattention. If a person expects a visitor every sound is construed as the well-\nknown footstep. The art of the hypnotist consists in opening up of new paths\nand inhibiting old ones by appropriate suggestions (page 178).\n\f158 Chas. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D. [part\nextraction of a tooth, or whether he lets him suffer the pain and\nsuggests afterwards that there has been no pain, thus removing its\nmemory !\nThe medical man and student will turn with the most expectation\nof enlightenment to the practical part of the book, in which Dr.\nForel impartially describes his own extensive practical experience,\nand here they will be richly rewarded. The author is a hard\nhitter, and exposes what he considers humbug unsparingly. Professor\nDubois of Berne, who claims to cure a great many intractable\npatients by his system of suggestion without hypnosis\u2014he strongly\ncondemns hypnotism\u2014especially comes under his lash, for Forel\nconsiders all such success due to the unacknowledged use of hypnotism.\nHis success in obtaining profound hypnosis is remarkable, this\nbeing due no doubt to a great extent, as with Bernheim, to his\ncommanding position and local prestige. We should like to see how he\nwould succeed with some of the patients we get in London, who \" try\nhypnotism\" after exhausting every other form of medical treatment.\nThe subject's more or less unconscious counter self-suggestion is,\nForel considers, the chief cause of failure, and he has often succeeded\nby finding out the opposing thought and removing it by preliminary\nargument. His cases of this kind remind one of many reported\nby Professor Janet and quoted in Myers' Human Personality. Forel\nattempted to hypnotise twenty-three out of twenty-six nurses at\nBurghoelze Asylum, and succeeded in getting somnambulism with\namnesia, obedience to post-hypnotic suggestions, anaesthesia, etc., in\nnineteen of them. Dr. Oscar Vogt claims to be even more successful, and\nsays he practically never fails to obtain deep hypnosis in all mentally\nsound men and women (page 72). Forel's nurses and attendants were\nmostly of the strong stolid German Swiss peasant type, and certainhy\nalmost as far removed from hysteria as can be imagined. The\nreviewer saw him practise upon several of them some years ago,\nand the instantaneous action of suggestion was remarkable. The\nProfessor made much practical use of his power. For instance, be\nwould tell the hypnotised attendant that he would sleep alongside\na suicidal patient quite comfortably as long as it was safe, but any\nunusual movement would at once arouse him. This answered\nperfectly, and whereas formerly many of the attendants in that\nundermanned institution used to sutler from watchful and anxious\nnights, under the new regime the}' got their proper allowance of\nsleep and were ready for the next day's work. Hypnotism, of course,\nmerely developed the faculties of inhibition and attention which\n\fLIV.] Revieivs. 159\nare latent in all of us, and which one sees exercised in a mother\nwho watches by a sick child. The slightest movement or cry of\nthe child will awaken her, whereas other and much louder sounds\nwill be unheard or ignored.\nForel gives full statistics of his cases and the results he obtained\nby hypnotic treatment. These, from such a source, are of immense\npractical importance. He sums up his experience by contending\nthat hypnotic suggestion should be tried in all cases of functional\nnervous disturbance which resist ordinary treatment, and he assures\nus that he has never seen harmful results follow when hypnotism has\nbeen intelligently used. This harmlessness of a powerful remedy\nhe contrasts with the baneful effects of strong drugs, so often seen\nin ordinary medical practice.\nForel relates some interesting experiences with professional\nmediums. One was a woman who made a great deal of money by\nfortune telling and as a diagnoser and healer of disease. She\nbecame entranced and was controlled by \" a spirit called Ernest.\"\nForel found the trance was genuine, and she was therefore acquitted\nof fraud by the magistrates, but her diagnoses were always fallacious\nand evidently based upon ocular and other sensory impressions.\nBefore her trial she expressed a great wish to be cured, but after\nit her husband and children lamented the loss of income entailed\nand got her to resume her practices. Another medium came under\nhis treatment at the Asylum. She was a young woman of hysterical\nand erratic temperament, who had studied art in Paris, and had there\nfallen into the hands of spiritualists who exploited her mediumistic\npowers for money. She became ill, and went into an hospital where\nCharcot's methods of hypnotism were practised with disastrous\nresults. Like \" Sally Beauchamp \" she developed a secondary person-\nality of a most objectionable type, which dominated the normal ego\nand threatened to submerge it. Forel, with much difficulty and\nby judicious flattery and cajolery, succeeded in suppressing this\npersonality and restoring the woman to more than her previous\nhealth.\nDr. Bleuler, Forel's successor in the Chair of Psychiatry, in the\nUniversity of Zurich, relates in the appendix his experience when\nhypnotised by Professors Von Speyr and Forel. These are very\nsimilar in character to those described by Mr. \"Edward Greenwood\"\nin the Proceedings S.P.R., vol. xvii., pp. 279 et seq.\nProfessor Bleuler became hypotactic, but not somnambulic. He\nobeyed suggestions made during hypnosis reluctantly and clumsily,\n\f160 Ghas. Lloyd Tuckey, 31.D. [part\nbut was able to resist post-hypnotic suggestions, though for some\nhours afterwards he used to feel the impulse to act upon them.\nOnly once was a sensory hallucination realised, and that was when\nForel suggested that he should put his fingers in his mouth and\nfind them taste bitter.\nProfessor Forel laments the blindness of medical authorities who by\nneglecting to instruct students as to the importance of suggestion\nin the treatment of disease, allow the field to be exploited by\nquacks, to the public detriment. He did what he could to correct\nthis neglect by conducting an admirable clinique in Zurich for the\ninstruction of students and graduates in medical hypnotism.\nAltogether Professor Forel's book may be thoroughly recommended\nto the scientific student and medical man seeking to acquire a clear\nand practical view of the subject propounded by a master.\nChas. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D.\nThe Hygiene of Mind, by T. S. Clouston, M.D., F.E.S.E. Third\nedition. Pp. 284. Price 7\/6 net. (The New Library of Medicine,\nMethuen & Co., London.)\nThis book, like the foregoing, is written by a physician eminent\nas an alienist and physiologist. Dr. Clouston appeals to the\neducated laity more than Professor Forel, and of course deals with\na widely different range of subjects. But, as might be expected\nfrom physicians who have spent the greater part of their lives in\nthe study of insanity, one can often trace in their arguments a\ncommon experience. On the whole there is agreement between them\nin their views regarding education and the hygiene of the mind.\nForel however attaches great importance to the use of hypnotism as\na formative, reformative and educational agency in the management\nof the mentally unfit and unstable ; whereas Clouston speaks rather\ndisparagingly of that agent and gives high praise to Dr. Dubois,\nwhom we have seen so severely handled hy Forel for his psychic\ntreatment of nervous disorders by mental hygiene and suggestion\nprofessedly without hypnotism.\nBut probably Dr. Clouston's experience of medicial hypnotism is\nlimited, for, though he acknowledges its good effect in many cases\nand correctly interprets its rationale, he goes on to say that, unfor-\ntunately, hypnotic cures are notoriously haphazard and scientifically\nunreliable, \" Depending too much on the individuality of the particular\nphysician and the patient\" (p. 97). Such observations indicate\n\fLIV.] Reviews. 161\nthat he has only seen the Nancy method applied in a haphazard\nand unscientific way, and has not studied the records of Bernheim,\nWetterstand, van Renterghem, Forel, Milne Bramwell and other\nspecialists. That is a pity, for Dr. Clouston is extremely liberal and\nopen-minded in his views, and acknowledges that \"by the effect of\nmental attention certain diseases of impaired nutrition from warts up\nto internal tumours, from scurvy to dropsy, have unquestionably been\ncured by mental influences,\" and again \" the doctor who neglects\nthe mental condition of his patient in his treatment of him, no\nmatter what the disease may be, is not a philosophical man, and\ncommonly not a successful physician\" (p. 96). Dr. Clouston agrees\nwith Forel that mind is only manifested through brain as its vehicle,\nand is conditioned by the state of the brain. He does not consider\ntelepathy proved, and thinks that mind evolved in one brain can only\nact on mind evolved in another brain through the senses. \" As yet\nthere is no scientific proof of the mental action of one person who\nis at a distance, the so-called telepathy\" (p. 37). This view is rather\ndisappointing after the patient work of the S.P.R. for so many\nyears, and warns us that much remains to be done before even the\nfoundations of \" Metapsychics \" are declared truly laid by orthodox\nscience.\nDr. Clouston's book possesses the rare merit of being scientific\nand at the same time \"popular.\" As an example of the former,\nthe reader will find the very latest views on heredity as propounded\nby Archdall Reid, Ford-Robertson and Beard, together with\nexcellent illustrations of brain cells showing their variations in\ninfancy, adolescence and old age, and how they are affected by over-\nwork and illness. From actual photographs he demonstrates how\nthe brain cells of the mentally deficient and imbecile are arrested\nin development and maintain the infantile type. From consideration\nof this and similar facts, Dr. Clouston makes an appeal for \"physio-\nlogical charity \" towards the mentally defective, but at the same\ntime he shows how their condition may be improved by suitable\neducation and surroundings. He instances the experiment made in\nGlasgow, when 100 scrofulous, sickly and starved children of the slums\nwere drafted off to the Highlands to share the home life in farms\nwith surprisingly good results, from which he concludes that nature\nis not so unkindly a stepmother, if we have the wit to humour\nher.\nThe titles of the various chapters are an indication of the scope\nof the book; among these we find, The Mind Machinery in the\n\f162 Chas.

[part\nBrain ;\nHeredity, Temperament and Social Instincts ; The Hygiene\nof Manners, Play, Work and Fatigue ; Mental Hygiene of Alcohol,\nTobacco and other Brain Stimulants and Sedatives. Dr. Clouston\nis courageous in facing difficulties, and at the same time hopeful\nand optimistic. Every chapter is full of instruction given in the\npleasantest style, and altogether the book may be confidently\nrecommended.\nChas. Lloyd Tuckey, M.D.\nIncubation, or the Cure of Disease in Pagan Temples and Christian\nChurches. By Mary Hamilton, M.A., Carnegie Research Scholar.\n(St. Andrews : W. C. Henderson. London : Simpkin, Marshall &\nCo. 5s. net. 1906.)\nIt was an ancient practice for people afflicted with bodily injuries\nand diseases, or lunacy, to spend one or more nights sleeping in\nthe temple of a god, in the hope that through some dream or\nvision, vouchsafed to themselves or the priests of the temple, they\nmight learn what means of cure to adopt where all human help\nhad failed. Stories of previous healings led them even to hope that\nperhaps they might be restored to health in a moment by a miracle.\nThe present work is the fruit of an evidently extended and\ncareful investigation into the history of this custom, as practised\nboth in ancient and modern times. The practice was called in Latin\nIncubatio, which the authoress, not very happily, renders by the\nEnglish word Incubation; it would have been better to borrow\nthe German designation, TempeUMaf. The book is divided into\nthree parts: (1) Incubation in pagan temples\u2014those of Asklepios,\nDionysos, and others in Greece and Italy, and of Isis and Serapis in\nEgypt; (2) Incubation in Christian churches in the middle ages; (3)\nIncubation in modern times\u2014in Italy, Sardinia, Austria, and Greece,\nespecially in Tenos and other islands of the Grecian Archipelago.\nNo doubt the. custom prevailed, and still prevails, in the East,\nbut Miss Hamilton's researches have not carried her so far afield.\nThe authoress shows that, wherever it is found in Christian\nchurches, the custom is even in minute details a direct survival of\nthe ancient superstition ; the Madonna or a Saint has taken the\nplace of a dethroned heathen god. She also gives us lively accounts\nof the places where the practice still exists, and which she has\nvisited in her travels. But this adds little of value to our know-\nledge of the subject, and unfortunately Miss Hamilton carries us\nno further. The book is hardly more than an elaborated catalogue\n\fliv.] Reviews. 163\nof the numerous places where the custom once existed or still\nexists, \u2014a catalogue often interesting, it is true, by its picturesque\ndescriptions and local colouring, but still a catalogue, and of undue\nlength. There is so little variety in the details, either of the\nmethods adopted by the patients, or of the real or alleged cures,\nthat tbe whole might well have been summarised in the space of a\nmagazine article. The one question that is of paramount interest\nto us to-day is passed by with a mere glance, \u2014the question, what\nkind of cures are now actually effected in this way 1 That people\nwere and still are cured through the \" Temple-sleep,\" we can\nhardly doubt, for even superstitious human nature would hardly\ncontinue to take part in lotteries where all draw blanks, and none\na prize. In one instance at least there was apparently an oppor-\ntunity for investigation and the obtaining of a valuable piece of\nfirst-hand evidence. In the account of her visit to Tenos, during\nthe great annual festival, Miss Hamilton writes :\n\" On the Friday\nmorning I saw a blind man, a Greek, who was totally unable to\nsee. He spent the day in acts of devotion to the Pauagia [the\nMadonna], and all night he lay in the Chapel of the Well along\nwith the other pilgrims. As he slept, he dreamed that the Panagia\ncame to him, and blessed him, touching his eyes with her hand.\nThen he awoke, and found that his eyesight had been restored, and\nhe could see as other men.\" It is strange that Miss Hamilton did\nnot realise the importance of making a thorough investigation of\nthis case ; she does not even tell us whether she saw the man\nafter his alleged cure, or how far off he was when she saw him\nbefore it. If she could revisit some of the scenes of her interesting\njourneys, and then examine, with all possible exactness, any cases of\nalleged cure which came under her immediate notice, she would\nperform a valuable service to psychical science. As it is, however,\nshe has produced an excellent guide-book for any who may be able\nto undertake the task. Her work possesses the first merit of literary\nstyle \u2014lucidity, and is pleasingly written ; and although she has\ndenied us what we should have valued more, Miss Hamilton is to\nbe congratulated on its production.\nM.

Unfortunately\nher family object to psychical research, and on their account\nshe wishes her name not to be mentioned in public. I speak\nof her therefore as \" Mrs. Holland.\" She wrote to me first\nfrom India on July 2nd, 1903, saying that she had just\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter I. 171\nfinished a careful reading of Mr. Myers's Human Personality\nand had been greatly interested in it on account of various\nexperiences of her own which were akin to some described\nin the book. She had, for instance, practised automatic writing\n(which she had been accustomed to call \" pencil writing \") since\n1893 for her own amusement and in spite of outside discourage-\nment, and was also able to see visions in a crystal. A speci-\nmen\u2014ten lines of verse\u2014was enclosed which (she said) \" my\npencil wrote this morning,\u2014I suppose because I was thinking\nof '\npencil writing.'\n\"\nI met her for the first time when she was in England about\ntwo years later, and have had several long talks with her on\nthe whole subject. Sir Oliver Lodge and Mrs. Verrall also\nmade her acquaintance afterwards, and Mr. Piddington and Mr.\nFeilding have met her once or twice, so that she is known\nto some other members of the Society as well as to myself.\nAfter a little correspondence had passed between us, Mrs.\nHolland sent me the following general account of her ex-\nperiences :\nSeptember nth, 1903.\n[Ten] years ago I first tried automatic writing, having seen a\nreference to it in, I think, the Review of Reviews. My hand began\nto form words almost immediately, but only short sentences of an\nuninteresting kind, and the questions I asked were not answered.\nThe next time I tried, (these attempts were always made when I\nwas alone) verses were written, aud since then, though I have often\ndiscontinued the practice for months and years, and tried to give\nit up altogether, any automatic writing that comes to me is nearly\nalways in verse, headed\n\u2014\n\" Believe in what thou canst not see,\nUntil the vision come to thee.\"\nThe verses, though often childishly simple in wording and jingling\nin rhyme, are rarely trivial in subject. Their striking feature is\nthe rapidity with which they come. I once wrote down fourteen\npoems in little over an hour, another time ten, and seven or eight\nare quite a common number to come at one time. When I write\noriginal verse I do so slowly and carefully, with frequent erasures :\nautomatic verse is always as if swiftly dictated and there are never\nany erasures. I am always fully conscious, but my hand moves so\nrapidly that I seldom know what words it is forming.\n\f172 Alice Johnson. [part\nIt would take up too much time and space to append a series of\nthese verses, though I have kept a good many of them. I copy one\nset of verses, however, to show how easily the rhymes come in auto-\nmatic writing. I wrote it down as quickly as it was possible for\nmy hand to move, and was surprised afterwards to find that it had\na definite form of its own. It is exactly as it came to me, not\n\" polished \" or altered in the least.\nI whom he loved, am a ghost,\nWandering weary and lost.\nI dare not dawn on his sight,\n(Windblown weary and white)\nHe would shudder in hopeless fright,\nHe who loved me the best.\nI shun the paths he will go,\nBecause I should frighten him so.\n(Weary and lacking rest).\nI whom he loved am a shade,\nMaking mortals afraid,\nYet all that was vile in me,\nThe garb of mortality,\nMy body that used to be,\nIs mouldering out of sight.\nI am but a waiting soul,\nPain-purified, seeking its goal,\nWhy should he dread the sight?\nIf I showed him my white bones\nUnder the churchyard stones,\nOr the creatures that creep and rest\nOn what was once my breast,\nHe who loved me the best\nWould have good cause for fright.\nBut my face is only pale,\nMy form like a windblown veil,\nWhy should he dread the sight 1\nShould I beat on the window pane,\nHe would think it the wind and rain,\nIf he saw my pale face gleam\nHe would deem it a stray moonbeam\nOr the waft of a passing dream.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter I. 173\nNo thought for the lonely dead,\nBuried away out of sight.\nAnd I go from him veiling my head,\nWindblown weary and white. (1896)\nI have been asked if automatic writing has ever stated facts\npreviously unknown to me, which were afterwards proved to be\ncorrect. Automatic verses do not deal much with facts, but once\nwhen I was staying in Italy, in an old palazzo I had never before\nseen, the day after my arrival, and before I had been into the\ngarden, the impulse to write came on me, and I yielded to itf\nwithout however ceasing to take part in the conversation of two\nfriends who were with me. One of them, who knew about my\nautomatic writing, asked me to read what had come to me. I did\nso :\n\u2014\nUnder the orange tree\nWho is it lies]\nBaby hair that is flaxen fair,\nShines when the dew on the grass is wet,\nUnder the iris and violet.\n'Neath the orange tree\nWhere the dead leaves be,\nLook at the dead child's eyes! (1901)\n\"This is very curious,\" said my friend, \"there is a tradition that\na child is buried in the garden here, but I know you have never\nheard it.\"\nAutomatic Letters to Acquaintances.\nI have said that automatic verses do not deal much with facts,\nbut once, when I was sensitive after illness, I experienced a new\nform of automatic writing, in the shape of letters which my hand\ninsisted on writing to a newly-made acquaintance.\nThe first of these letters began with a pet name I did not know,\nand was signed with the full name of some one I had never heard\nof, and who I afterwards learnt had been dead some years. It\nwas clearly impressed upon me for whom the letter was intended,\nbut thinking it due to some unhealthy fancy of my own, I destroyed\nit. Having done so I was punished by an agonising headache, and\nthe letter was repeated, till in self-defence I sent it and the succeeding\nones to their destination.\nThey generally came when I was trying to write ordinary letters\n;\nI never \" sat for them \" or encouraged them in any way. I never\n\f174 Alice Johnson. [part\nread them over, feeling they were not meant for me, and the\nrecipient, beyond telling me they referred to matters known only\nto this one person who was dead, and that the writing of them,\nespecially the signature, bore a marked resemblance to that person's\nwriting, preferred not to discuss the subject. I have never seen\nthe writing in question.\nAs I regained perfect health I tried to free myself from this\ninfluence, for it used to give me cruel headaches and was very\nexhausting. I have often left my writing table and taken up\nneedlework or knitting till the force had spent itself. If my\nhand was not actively employed at these times it would clench\nitself, and make the motion of writing in the air.\nSince then I have felt ou three other occasions that some unseen\nbut very present personality was striving to transmit a message\nthrough me to a well-beloved. In every case the communication\nwas utterly unsought by me, and came as a complete surprise to\nthe recipient, who was always a recent acquaintance, never one of\nmy friends. My attention was always enforced, as it were, by a\nsevere pain in the head, which vanished when I had delivered the\nmessage. But these cases would take too long to describe, and one\nof them has no connection with automatic writing.\nSince I have spoken of illness, perhaps I ought to say that I\nhave only twice been ill in the last twenty years, and I am now a\nhealthy cheerful woman, thirty-five years of age. I prize my health\nand strength exceedingly, and it puzzles me a little that with it,\nand with no desire to consider myself exceptional, I do sometimes\nsee, hear, feel, or otherwise become conscious of beings and influences\nthat are not patent to all. Is this a frame of mind to be checked,\nor permitted, or encouraged ? I should like so much to know. My\nown people hate what they call \" uncanniness,\" and I am obliged\nto hide from them the keen interest I cannot help feeling in\npsychic matters.\nI have never been in surroundings that encouraged this interest,\nI have never been mesmerised, I have never attended a seance, for\nthe idea of anything connected with paid mediumship is peculiarly\ndisagreeable to me. I only discovered by accident, five years ago,\nthat I have the clairvoyant faculty.\nIn reply to my enquiries, Mrs. Holland sent me a fuller\naccount of her recollections of the incidents just referred to,\nsome at least of which seem to have been veridical. No\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter I. 175\ncontemporary records, however, existed, since she had sent or\ngiven the original script\u2014generally without even reading it\n\u2014\nto the persons whom it concerned. Some of these she had\nsince lost sight of, while the others were mere acquaintances,\nto whom she did not like to apply for corroboration of matters\ninvolving intimate personal details. Thus there is no means\nof ascertaining to what extent these early writings were veridical,\nand I therefore omit the account of them, quoting only a few\nsentences from it in the psychological section below, and pass\non at once to the period when the case came under my own\nobservation, that is, just as it began to be guided into definite\nchannels by Mrs. Holland's reading of Human Personality.\nFrom an evidential point of view, the interest and value of\nMrs. Holland's script depends to a great extent, as will be seen,\non the indications of telepathy manifested\u2014at first quite unex-\npectedly\u2014between herself and Mrs. Verrall, and the whole report\nwill show how greatly Mrs. Verrall has contributed to the\nresult, both by her co-operation in the experiments, and by the\ninvaluable help she has given me in the work of investigation\nand interpretation.\nMrs. Holland also has given me every possible help in the\nmatter. Not only has she answered fully and freely a very\nlarge number of questions, and herself volunteered much\ninformation, which I could not have obtained otherwise, about\nthe sources or possible sources of many of the statements in\nher script, but she has also accepted with the utmost readi-\nness any suggestion of mine as to experiments or methods of\nprocedure. Further, she has consented to remain for months\nat a time in ignorance of the results of these experiments,\nand has continued nevertheless to persevere with them.\nWhile never disclaiming her own strong; interest in the\no o\nmatter, she has always maintained an entirely impersonal\nand impartial attitude in regard to it,\u2014an attitude which\nmust be none the less welcome to psychical researchers\nbecause it is fortunately not quite unprecedented in our\nexperience of automatists. She has, in fact, realised that it is\nafter all in the normal course of events that an automatist and\nan investigator should act in co-operation and not in antagonism\nfor the advancement of knowledge.\nI wish to lay stress on this disinterested attitude, because\n\f176 Alice Johnson. [part\nthe somewhat minute and detailed analysis of her own\npsychology which she has from time to time given me in her\nletters, some parts of which are quoted in various sections\nof my report, might lead the reader to suppose that she\nattached an exaggerated importance to the minutiae of her\nmental life. But she only began to tell me of these things\nafter finding that I wished to hear them, and I know that\nher motive in doing so was simply to give me the fullest\npossible material for forming a judgment, without any idea\nof their publication.\nBut, with her permission, I include in my report passages\nfrom her letters which may be of interest to others besides\nmyself,\u2014partly because they give to a certain extent an\ninside view of the phenomena, which are naturally better\ndescribed in her words than translated into terms of my\nown. Though many of the sensations and experiences con-\nnected with the script are probably subjective in origin, it\nmay be that certain idiosyncrasies are correlated with veridical\nphenomena, in which case they would have a reflected interest\nof their own. And it may be that when we know more of\nthe whole subject, we shall find significance in some incidents\nthat now seem unimportant. It seems better, therefore, for\nthe present to err on the side of recording too much rather\nthan too little.\nCHAPTER II.\nFirst Period: September, 1903\n\u2014\nJanuary, 1904.\nGeneral Account.\nProm the psychical point of view, her first reading of Human\nPersonality formed an epoch in Mrs. Holland's life, and\nthenceforth her automatic writing was coloured largely by\nthe influence of that book. She had not known Mr. Myers\nduring his life-time, nor could she remember afterwards that\nshe had even heard his name before she read the book. But\nher own experiences and her own temperament had specially\nprepared her for the reception of it, and the personality of\nthe author strongly appealed to her.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 177\nUnder these circumstances it was not only natural but\nalmost inevitable that a great part of her writing should now\npurport to be inspired by him, or\u2014to a less extent\u2014by the\ntwo friends to whom his book is dedicated, Mr. Gurney and\nDr. Sidgwick.\nFor these personations it will be convenient to use the\nterm \" control \" in the way that it is commonly used in\npsychical literature\u2014viz. in the sense of something representing\nitself as a personality distinct from that of the automatist.\nFor evidence of the real existence of such a personality, we\nhave, of course, to look to the contents of the writings and\nnot to their dramatic form. Much of the contents in this\ncase deals with facts or reflections about facts within the\nnormal supraliminal knowledge of the automatist. There is a\nconsiderable proportion of matter relating to facts outside her\nsupraliminal knowledge, some of which has been traced to sub-\nliminal reminiscences, and some of which may never have been\nwithin her normal cognisance at all. There is also a certain\nproportion relating to facts which I am convinced were entirely\nunknown to her at the time the writing was produced. But\na good deal of the script cannot definitely be classed under\nany of these three heads, and it is further impossible to draw\nthe line between them. It is therefore convenient to use the\nterm \" control \" for all kinds and degrees of personation, irre-\nspective of the question whether the personality is or is not\npartially or completely independent of the automatist.\nBefore going further, I may remark that Mrs. Holland\npossesses both literary ability and dramatic powers of imagina-\ntion, combined apparently with a rapid perception and delicate\ndiscrimination of character. All these cpialities are to be\nfound in her script ; how far they account for its features as\na whole need not be considered at this point.\nThe writings of this first period are chiefly of interest\nfrom a psychological point of view, while incidentally they\nreveal the attitude of the automatist towards the script. 1\nwill first discuss certain psychological features, illustrating\nthem by quotations from the script, many of which will for\nconvenience be repeated in their context later on.\nOne of the earliest passages is a curious example of the\nefforts that seem so often to be made by the subliminal\n\fITS Alice Johnson. [part\nself to keep the supraliminal in ignorance\u2014at least for the\ntime being\u2014of the sense of what is being produced. It is\nwritten on two sides of a half-sheet of paper ; the first side\nbegins with the initial \" F.,\" and the second ends with the\ninitial \" M.\" ; the whole passage is divided into four short\nsections, the first three ending respectively in \"17\/,\" \" \/l\n\"\nand \"\/Ol.\" January 17th, 1901, was the date of Mr. Myers's\ndeath, mentioned in Human Personality ; but the simple device\nof separating these initials and items from one another was\ncompletely effective in its apparent object. I read the passage\na good many times before I saw what they meant and I\nfound that the meaning had entirely escaped Mrs. Holland's\nnotice.\nTwo days later came: \" 1873. 30 years ago. Cmrde\nA b i w Youth.\" I read the first five enigmatic letters as \" Com-\nrade\" with two vowels left out; the other four, \"A big,\" seemed\nmeaningless. Long afterwards in glancing through Human\nPersonality (Vol. I., p. 7), I came on this sentence: \"In\nabout 1873 . . . it became the conviction of a small group\nof Cambridge friends that the deep questions thus at issue\nmust be fought out ...\" It was then clear that the nine\nmysterious letters were merely an anagram for \" Cambridge.\"\nMrs. Holland again was quite unaware of their meaning till\nI pointed it out to her.\nThe same writins; goes on\n:\nIt lias been a long work\u2014but the work is not nearly over yet\n\u2014\nIt has barely begun\u2014 Go on with it\n\u2014go on\u2014 We were the\ntorch bearers\u2014follow after us\u2014 The flame burns more steadily now.\nE. G.\n1888.\nThe year 1888 was the date of Mr. Gurney's death, a fact also\nstated in Human Personality. Here, and in other similar pas-\nsages, the reference is unmistakable, and there soon begins to be\napparent a struggle between the supraliminal self of the writer\nand the supposed influences. The supraliminal self is obviously\nafraid of being led into attaching too much importance to\nthe writing. It is aware that some of the names are derived\nfrom its reading and both resents and resists their incursion\ninto the script. It doubts the use of the attempts and is\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 179\nnot very willing to persevere with them. Meanwhile the\nvarious \" controls,\" aided and abetted by the subliminal self\n(of which they may, indeed, be fragmentary manifestations),\nappear to be exerting great pressure on their side by various\narguments aDcl artifices to encourage the writer and persuade\nher to go on, e.g.\n:\n(September 19th, 1903.) You should not be discouraged if what is\nwritten appears to you futile\u2014 Most of it is not meant for you\n\u2014\nYou are the reporter\u2014 the recorder \u2014and need not be the critic . . . .\nDun't be in too great a hurry.\n(September 21st, 1903.) Do not feel that criticism need act in the\nleast as a fetter\u2014don't let it hinder you at all .... Nothing\nis unimportant, however much it seems so\n\u2014\nThere is no effort unavailing\n\u2014\nYou fail\u2014yet save another's failing.\n(November 25th, 1903.) Do try to forget your abiding fear of being\nmade a fool or a dupe. If we ever prompt you to fantastic follies\nyou may leave us. But we only wish you to give us a few passive\npatient minutes each day. It's a form of restless vanity to fear\nthat your hand is imposing upon yourself, as it were.\nThe \" Gurney control,\" who expresses himself rather strongly\nand brusquely, writes\n:\n(November 14th, 1903.) I can't help feeling vexed or rather angry\nat the halhhearted way in which you go in for this \u2014you should\neither take it or leave it. If you don't care enough to try every\nday for a short time, better drop it altogether. It's like making\nappointments and not keeping them. You endanger you own powers\nof sensitiveness and annoy us bitterly\u2014G.\nThe \" Myers control,\" on the other hand, makes his appeal\nto the sympathies of the automatist\n:\n(January 12th, 1901.) If it were possible for the soul to die back\ninto earth life again I should die from sheer yearning to reach you\n\u2014\nto tell you that all that we imagined is not half wonderful enough\nfor the truth .... If I could only reach you\u2014if I could only\ntell you\u2014I long for power and all that comes to me is an infinite\nyearning\u2014an infinite pain. Does any of this reach you \u2014reach\nany one\u2014or am I only wailing as the wind wails\u2014wordless and\nunheeded.\n\f180 Alice Johnson. [part\nIn these utterances, taken by themselves, there is clearly\nnothing to suggest more than a dramatisation by her subliminal\nself of personalities that had attracted Mrs. Holland's interest\nthrough the normal means of reading a book. The question\nwhether anything more than this is really represented in\nthem will be considered later on. Meanwhile I am bound\nto emphasise the large part played by Mrs. Holland's\nnormal knowledge in the construction of the various roles.\nThey came into existence first shortly after she had read\nHuman Personality, and it will be seen that passages from\nthis book are clearly to be traced in the script ; there is\nlittle or nothing in the characterisations that could not be\nderived from it directly or by inference by an intelligent\nand sympathetic reader. There are, moreover, a certain\nnumber of features that an intimate friend of Mr. Myers's\nwould see to be uncharacteristic or positively incorrect.\nFurther, the personalities become suddenly more vivid and\nrealistic at a later date, after Mrs. Holland had seen the\nportraits of Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney and Dr. Sidgwick in\nMr. Myers's posthumous work, Fragments of Prose and Poetry,\nand glanced at parts of the book itself, as described below,\np. 245 ; and again after she had seen reviews of the Memoir\nof Dr. Sidgwick early in 1906.\nAs usual in automatic writing, there are various different\nindications of which \" control \" is purporting to be present.\nOccasionally, but not very often, the \" control \" uses a\nsignature\u2014either in full, or in initials. Often the contents\nof the writing leave no doubt as to who it is. And, as\nusual, varieties of hand-writing are associated with the different\ncontrols, though they are not always used consistently for\nthe same one.\nMrs. Holland's own hand-writing is of a rather strongly\nmarked type\u2014clear, bold, round and legible. One marked\ncharacteristic in it is that the words are very disjointed,\nthe pen being lifted generally several times in the middle\nof every word, sometimes after every letter. The automatic\nwriting, on the other hand, is more sloping and more pointed\nand far more continuous than the normal, the words often\nrunning together without any break between them. This\nis the usual writing of the \" Myers control,\" but it is not\n\fLV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 181\nconfined to him, being apparently the normal type, if one\nmay call it so, of Mrs. Holland's automatic writing\u2014the\nform which it seems to tend naturally to take unless some\nspecial idea suggests a variation.\nThe \" Gurney control \" uses a more bold and upright style,\nwhich is sometimes almost as disjointed as her ordinary\nwriting. Of this style Mrs. Holland wrote later (November\n16th, 1905): \"When the writing changes from very sloping to\nupright, I always get the impression of a younger and more\nbrusque personality. The initial '\nG.' often comes then.\"\nAt the beginning of this period, pencil or ink is used\nindiscriminately. On November 18th, 1903, the \"Myers\ncontrol \" begins in pencil, then writes :\n\" Take a pen,\" and\nthe writing goes on in ink, \" That's well\u2014a pen is best when\nI am here\u2014pencil for the upright vehement writing,\" viz.,\nthat of the \" Gurney control \" ; and henceforth these two\ncontrols generally\u2014but not invariably\u2014use a pen or pencil\nrespectively.\nThere is no resemblance between their writings and the actual\nhand-writings of Mr. Myers and Mr, Gurney, nor\u2014so far as\nI am aware\u2014is there any reason for associating ink specially\nwith one and pencil with the other. It appears to be simply\na sort of subliminal device for keeping the two personalities\ndistinct ; nevertheless they often tend to merge into one\nanother,\u2014the suggestion being either that two influences\n\u2014\nreal or imaginary\u2014are present at once, or that one is being\ngradually displaced by the other.\nA similar subliminal device is manifested on Jan. 6th, 1904\n\u2014thus described by the script :\n\" Two influences\u2014that was\nwhy the pencil slipped from your fingers and flew across the\nroom then .... Don't you notice a new feature to-day\u2014that\nevery few minutes we make you take another pencil. It's\neasier for us, and it marks the change for you.\" Mrs. Holland\nnotes of the script produced on this occasion :\n\" This writing-\ntook a full half-hour, and my hand was very restless all\nthrough, and held the pencils (four lay by me and my hand\nkept on changing) in two very peculiar ways for two of the\nentries. At the end my hand felt shaken and pushed as it\ndid when I first began to get these writings, scrawling wildly\ntill it was stopped. The [word at the end of the script]\nM\n\f182 Alice Johnson. [part\n'stop' was from without entirely. I was willing to let it\nscrawl on and over to the next page if the impulse continued.\"\nOn May 23rd, 1907, Mrs. Holland writes of this occasion:\n\" I still recall clearly the curious sensation that accompanied\nthe word '\nstop.' My hand seemed to be taken, the wrist\nturned towards the left and then drawn off the paper. It\nis the only time I have ever felt '\nuncanny '\nin connection\nwith script.\"\nOccasionally\u2014but very rarely\u2014the script is guided or accom-\npanied by conscious impressions relating to it. Thus on Nov.\n7th, 1903, (quoted in full below) it says: \"I think it might\nbe better if the agent wrote the thoughts in her brain instead\nof keeping a vacant brain and a passive hand.\" It continues\nas if she were speaking in her own person, and in a hand-\nwriting intermediate between her ordinary and her automatic\nstyle :\n\" Very well, I will write down what I am thinking of\nbut my hand feels as if it wanted to scrawl and the words\nhave a tendency to run into one another. I find myself\npicturing a tall man, etc.\" Of this writing she notes :\n\" My\nbrain was far more influenced than my hand and that is very\nunusual.\" Probably she means by this that she was more\nconscious of the sensory than of the motor element in the\nautomatism.\nThe same conception is developed further on a later and\nespecially interesting occasion, January 12th, 1904, the script\nof which is given in full below, see p. 232.\nThe more purely subjective side of these dramatisations is\nrepresented sometimes by partial dissociations of consciousness,\nsometimes by definite sensations or disturbances.\nMrs. Holland says in her preliminary account\u2014already quoted\n\u2014that she used to have with the impulse to write or speak a\nsevere headache which vanished with the fulfilment and cessation\nof the impulse. In two of the cases described in the fuller account\nwhich I omit, she seems to have partially lost consciousness.\nThus, in the first: \" I shut my eyes. It seemed to me that\nthe pencil scribbled wildly, like a child pretending to write .\n.'\n.\nMy right arm seemed the only part of my body that was\nnot asleep, and I was only conscious of Mr. 1). saying now and\nagain, '\nWait a minute,' when he slipped fresh paper under\nmy hand. Then the influence suddenly passed ; I opened my\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 183\neyes feeling refreshed and alert, my headache was absolutely\ngone.\" Again, in the second case, when the impulse took the\nform of speech :\n\" Though I spoke English, I felt as if reading\naloud from a language I could pronounce but not translate. It\nseemed to come from my lips only. I was perfectly conscious\n;\nI watched the effect of mingled moonlight and electric light\non the deck before me . . . My voice went on, but I did\nnot grasp the sense of a single sentence.\" In continuation of\nthe same incident, next evening :\n\" I began to describe an\nelderly man, his character, manner and appearance, down to\nminute details, and this time I understood what I was saying,\nbut the words came without being chosen.\"\nOf the script in general, Mrs. Holland says :\n\" I am always\nfully conscious, but my hand moves so rapidly that I seldom\nknow what words it is forming.\"\nThe headaches of this early period have recurred only to\na slight degree and very rarely since. On the other hand,\nMrs. Holland reports later an occasional tendency to drowsi-\nness in connection with the writing which, if encouraged, might\nprobably develop into trance.\nOther slight pains mentioned may be due to ordinary\nmuscular exhaustion, occasioned by automatic contractures of\nthe muscles. Thus, of the script of Nov. 11th, 1903, three\nlarge MS. pp., Mrs. Holland notes: \"This took 2 0 minutes,\nand left my whole arm feeling very tired.\" Next clay two\npages only were written, and she notes: \"This took 10 minutes\nand was not in the least fatiguing.\" On Nov. 17th, after\nsome mirror-writing, written with the left hand, the script\nremarks :\n\" Your hand gets tired soon because it is not passive\nenough. Make it limp. At present the whole arm has to be\nmoved from the elbow. It is only your wrist and fingers that\nneed move really.\"\nOn Nov. 27th the Gurney control writes: \"The pain in\nyour shoulder is new to you, isn't it ? But it's slight and I\nthink it means that F.'s power is deepening. Let your hand\nbe more flexible and the shoulder will not suffer.\"\nOn Jan. 5th, 1904, Mrs. Holland not having found leisure\nfor the script since Dec. 5 th, the Gurney control writes\n:\n\" Why did you stop ? Your hand needs to be pushed and\ndragged now. All the scrawling and thumping again I hoped\n\f184 Alice Johnson. [part\nyou had done with for good\u2014[then in another writing]\u2014Yes,\nI know your arm is aching\u2014want of practice only.\"\nOn Jan. 7th, 1904, after a page of writing, the script\nsays :\n\" The reason you feel sleepy is that too many are\ntrying to come at once, and that is why the writing is so\nvague and scrawling again. Pull yourself together and think\nof one particular one\u2014Pen.\" Here Mrs. Holland notes :\n\" At\nthis point I had such a strong feeling of mal dc mer that I\nhad to go to my room for a few minutes.

In a letter\nto me written the same day, she says :\n\" To be interrupted\nwhen writing automatically gives me a jarred feeling and at\ntimes a feeling of dizziness which is very unpleasant.\"\nIt is natural enough that the subliminal self should try to\nfind an explanation for these different sensations and different\nbehaviours of the hand by associating them with different\nexternal influences, or different degrees of the influence, though\nthere is no evidence for any such causal connection. Neither,\nof course, must it be supposed that the scriptural attempts at\nexplanation, or the crude and often contradictory theories\nexpressed as to the nature and conditions of communication,\nnecessarily represent the views of Mrs. Holland herself; for\nthe views expressed in automatic writing frequently differ from\nthose of the automatist, who must no more be held responsible\nfor them than for opinions expressed by characters in his\ndreams.\nExtracts from Script.\nI will now give extracts from the script of this period,\ntaking them not in their strict chronological order, but in the\norder in which I received them from Mrs. Holland, and\nincluding many of the passages already quoted without their\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 185\ncontext above. The first was sent to me in a letter dated\nNovember 19th, 1903, which ran as follows:\n... I am glad to know that you agree with me as to the harni-\nlessness of automatic writing for a person of average common-sense.\nIts snare for me lies in the direction of boredom rather than of\nblind faith. However, in September, I experimented for one week,\nby spending a short time every morning in waiting for automatic\nwriting at 11 a.m. That is a good commonplace hour, when one is\nnot likely to be over-imaginative. I found the results disappointing,\nthough, when I looked over them the other day, there seemed to\nbe rather more continuity of thought than I had at first realized.\nI have not destroyed them yet, and if you care to see them I will\nsend them to you.\nSince then I have tried fitfully several times, and find verses on\nthe decline, and in their place come initials, names, and dates, which\nare irritating because it is impossible for me to trace them. For\ninstance, how can I find out if in the \" Old Parish Church \" at\nNantwich there is a plain grey stone slab recording the birth and\ndeath of John Collins, an old man who died in 1873 ? I had to\nlook up Nantwich in an atlas before I knew what county it was in\n!\nThen, again, I have never been in Cambridge, but in the two pages\nof automatic writing I enclose, what purports to be an address there\nis thrice given, and the third time it is stated to be Mrs. Verrall's.\nI remember that lady's name in connection with experiments with\ncrystal vision in Human Personality, but I have no means of learning\nif \" Selwyn Gardens \" is a real place.\nWill you forgive me for troubling you with the writing 1 I do not\nlike to suppress it, as it gave me the impression of some one very\nanxious to establish communication, but with not much power to do\nit, and no special brief message to convey as yet. My brain was\nfar more influenced than my hand, and that is very unusual. On\nthe second page * shows from where my hand began to move\nautomatically again. I feel sure I should recognise a portrait of\nthe man who wants to be identified if I saw one now, but I cannot\nbe sure if I have seen one already. I certainly never saw him\nactually, but I vaguely remember a portrait seen in some paper\ntwo or three years ago, but I cannot^remember the name below it.\nBy seeing, I do not mean that the figure appeared as an actual\nphantasm standing in the room ; I saw it \" at the back of the\nbrain,\" in the way that clairvoyant sights come to me.\n\f186 Alice Johnson. [part\n\" Lucy \" and \" Agnes Lysaght \" mean nothing to me, the last\nname has been written several times lately.\nThe script enclosed in this letter was written (as Mrs.\nHolland notes on it) on Nov. 7th [1903], at 11 a.m. It begins\nwith a scrawl ending in the initial \" F.\" The sentences in\nround brackets are in Mrs. Holland's normal hand-writing,\nbeing apparently questions addressed by her to the \" control.\"\nThe punctuation is generally represented by dashes and\ncapital letters.

[part\nI happened to see Mrs. Verrall the day after I received\nthis script, and I then told her that a lady in India had\nsent me some automatic writing containing her name and\naddress ; but that the lady had been reading Human Person-\nality, and the main points in her writing seemed to be derived\nfrom it. I did not show Mrs. Verrall this writing or tell\nher anything more about it until Oct. 1905. On November\n16th, 1905, I read to her the description of the man, as it\nhad occurred to me that it was not unlike Dr. Verrall, and\nshe agreed that there were many points of similarity. In\n1903 Dr. Verrall was 52, but looked older on account of his\ndelicate health. He had a beard as well as moustache\u2014more\ngrey than his hair ; when run down, he tended to have a\nnervous cough. His hands were well-shaped with long fingers\nwhich have become crippled and much bent from rheumatism.\nHe has never worn a seal ring. The other points mentioned\nare correct.\nAs to the remark in Mrs. Holland's letter, quoted above\n(p. 185), that she vaguely remembered a portrait seen in some\npaper two or three years earlier, which she thought might\npossibly be the source of her description, Mrs. Verrall tells\nme that no portrait of Dr. Verrall, as far as she knows, has\never appeared in an illustrated paper. There are two portraits\nof him in his house, but neither has been reproduced. A\nphotograph of him was taken about 1906, the one previous\nto that having been when he was under forty.\nOn re-reading the description later, Mrs. Verrall writes\n:\nThe attitude strikes me as particularly good. The trick of lean-\ning forward and gesticulating when interested in what he talks of\nis very characteristic. The use of the initials A. W. without the\nfinal V. is also characteristic in the case of Cambridge friends and\nespecially of Mr. Myers.\nAlso the phrase \"Is A. W. satisfied?\" is curiously parallel to the\nphrase in my script, October 6th, 1901: \"But A. W. V. must be\nsatisfied.\"\nThis latter phrase was used in connection with an ex-\nperiment described in Mrs. Verrall's Report on her script\n{Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XX. pp. 156-167 and 387-394), in\nwhich Dr. Verrall tried to convey three Greek words to her\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 899\ntelepathically. The report was not published until October,\n1906, but a brief abstract of this experiment appeared in the\nJournal S.P.E., May, 1903, including the phrase \"A. W. V.\n[i.e. Dr. Verrall] ought to be satisfied.\" I have every reason\nto believe (see below) that Mrs. Holland had not seen this\nor any other number of the Journal.\nThe description of the man in the script just quoted,\nthough certainly like Dr. Verrall, appears to be meant to\nrefer to a dead person (\" he seems to be summoning up the\nappearance of what he used to be \"), and some passages in\nthe later script make it clear that Mrs. Holland herself identified\nthe man described as Mr. Myers. The description is quite\nincorrect if applied to him.\nWith regard to the mention of Mrs. Verrall's address in\nthis script, in Human Personality she is spoken of as \" Mrs.\nA. W. Verrall, a lecturer at Newnham College,\" and her\naddress is not given. I thought it not unlikely, however,\nthat Mrs. Holland might have seen Dr. Verrall's address in\nWho's Who or some such work of reference, and have kept a\nsubliminal recollection of it. I wrote to her explaining that\nthere was strong evidence that facts that had been once\nknown and absolutely forgotten might remain in the subliminal\nmemory and emerge automatically, and that much in her\nwriting was clearly derived from reminiscences of Mr. Myers's\nbook, though some of it could not apparently be so explained.\nI asked her to tell me whether she had seen any of the\nS.P.R Proceedings or Journals, or what other books she had\nread on the subject. I said that in order to avoid giving\nhints which might be developed by her subliminal conscious-\nness, I preferred not to tell her at present which parts of her\nscript appeared possibly evidential, but I asked her to continue\nsending to me all the script she got.\nThis letter perhaps formed a point ele repere for the vision\nseen by Mrs. Holland on the night after she received it, as\ndescribed in the following letter dated January 12th, 1904:\nI am delighted to answer any questions that may help me to\nutiderstand how much of the automatic writing I get is due to\nsubconscious memory, and how much, if any, comes from other\ninfluences. I am so afraid of becoming a self-deceiver, charlatan\nmalcjri moi !\n\f190 Alice Johnson. [part\nI have never seen an}' of the Proceedings or Journals of the S.P.R.,\nand Mr. Myers' Human Personality is the only book on the subject\nI have ever read. I remember looking at Mr. Lang's Dreams and\nGhosts when it first came out, but 1 have not seen it since, and my\nmemory of it is limited to the story of a dog's ghost. Years ago\nI read two or three collections of ghost stories, of the Glimpses in\nthe Twilight type, and I re-read that particular collection the other\nday. In 1902 a friend sent me a MS. book of copied \"spirit\nwritings\" to read: flowery descriptions of the \"Happy Land,\"\nsigned with names like pantomime fairies, which I disliked intensely.\nI have never seen any other examples of automatic writing.\n... I am glad that you wish to see more automatic writing.\nIf I may send 3^011 all I get it will remove the scruples I have\nfelt about writing down \" messages \" I could not attempt to verify.\nPlease continue not to give me any clue as to the meaning or\nmeaninglessness of anything that I may send you ; I am very anxious\nnot to begin to think of \"hits and misses,\" and indeed I feel as\nif the less I thought of it, the less misleading it is likely to be.\nI will send you by this mail the September experiment of writing\nevery day for a week, to which I referred before, and also an\nexercise book in which I have written during November and quite\nlately. I had to give up writing for a month, because December\nis such a busy time here that I could not count on even half-an-\nhour undisturbed in the morning, and to be interrupted when\nwriting automatically gives me a jarred feeling, and at times a\nfeeling of dizziness which is very unpleasant. . . .\nThe names I know to be real, which occur here and there, always\ndistress me, but if I suppressed what had been written when it did\nnot suit my own taste, I should feel very dishonest.\nSince apparently trivial impressions have sometimes a meaning,\nI think I must tell you that on the night of January 4th I had\none of my vivid infrequent dreams, or rather \"visions of the night,\"\nfor they always seem to precede sleep. I was tired and neuralgic\nafter a week of late hours, and when I went to bed I darkened\nthe room completely, instead of leaving a small lamp burning as\nusual. Very soon, an unexpected light made me think that one of\nthe electric lamps in the next room had been turned on, until I\nsaw the light was too diffused to be coming through the chinks of\nthe door. As I watched it, it altered its character, becoming a\nlarge luminous patch with jagged edges, on a black background\nwhich it did not illuminate. This was a new experience for me,\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 191\nand I was very interested and confidently hoped to see a scene, or\nat least a face, appear in the centre of the light. Instead of this\nI suddenly seemed to be standing behind a man who was sitting\nat a large kneehole writing table. A long window was in front,\nbut I did not see anything through it. I wanted to see his face\nand moved round to the right, but his head was so bent that I\nonly saw a fine brow, grey hair, the points of his rather old-fashioned\nturned-down collar, and a loosely tied dark tie. He was busy with\nproofs and MS., and as I watched him he sighed heavily. Then I\nnoticed that the pen he wrote with left no mark on the paper,\nand it struck me that he was a shadow in real surroundings. At\nthe instant I came to myself again, in my dark room, and did not\nsleep for more than half an-hour after. Unless this impression has\nsome connection, symbolical or otherwise, with your letter which I\nreceived that day, I am at a loss to account for it. You will\nunderstand I do not ask if there is any connection ; I only wish to\nmention it to you.\nThere seems little doubt that this vision represented Mrs.\nHolland's subliminal conception of Mr. Myers, but, though not\nunlike him as far as it goes, it is too vague for identification.\nI now give in chronological order some extracts from the\nabove-mentioned batch of writings sent to me on January\n15th, 1904, which are chiefly interesting as illustrating the\ncharacteristics of the Myers and Gurney \" controls \" and their\ngradual development during this period.\nThere is little or nothing worth noting about the meagre\nand fragmentary utterances of the other controls, a few of\nwhich are included in these extracts. They are sometimes\nindicated more or less dubiously by variations in the hand-\nwritings, to which no names are attached. In other cases\noccur the names, John Collins, Agnes Lysaght, William Nixon,\nwhich I have not traced and suspect to be fictitious. Another\ngroup consists of: a dead child, whose mother was a casual\nacquaintance of Mrs. Holland's ; the lady called below \" Mrs.\nN.\" (see p. 287); and Lady Mount-Temple; all these being\npersons of whom Mrs. Holland had heard, like the Laurence\nOliphant control, which appeared for a short time in 1905\n(see p. 259).\n\f192 Alice Johnson. [part\nNote.\nThe words enclosed in round brackets in the following\nextracts are notes made on the script at the time by Mrs.\nHolland, giving the day and hour of the writing, the questions\nshe occasionally put to the controls, her own feelings or\ncircumstances at the moment, etc.\nThe initials or words in square brackets at the beginning\nof passages have been added by myself to show which control\npurports to be operative (as judged by the hand-writing or\ncontents), or the points where there is a definite change in\nthe hand-writing indicating some change of control. The\nMyers control is represented by the initial \"M.\" and the\nGurney control by the initial \" G.\" The indications, however,\nare often dubious and in many cases have probably no real\nsignificance.\nThe following passage, dated September 16th, 1903, is\nwritten on two sides of a half sheet of paper, the first side\nending with the number 17, and the second with the initial\n\"M.\" The date 17\/1\/01 was that of Mr. Myers's death,\nstated in Human Personality (Editorial Note). As mentioned\nabove, the separation of the initials and numbers from one\nanother prevented me for a long time from seeing their\nsignificance.\n(September 16th, 7.30 a.m.)\n[M.] F.\nFriend while on earth with knowledge slight\nI had the living power to write\nDeath tutored now in things of might\nI yearn to you and cannot write.\n17 |\nIt may be that those who die suddenly suffer no prolonged obscura-\ntion of consciousness but for my own experience the unconsciousness\nwas exceedingly prolonged.\nI\n1\nThe reality is infinitely more wonderful than our most daring con-\njectures.

About Christmas, 1905, I gave\nMrs. Verrall a large quantity of the early script to read,\nand she pointed out to me that the description applied\nclosely to her dining-room. She wrote on January 1st, 1906 :\n\" From '\nA room '\nto '\nvery dark '\nseems quite correct, though\nthere is a fourth window not noticeable from door. Bust 1\non pedestal quite wrong. Rest of description correct. On\nbookshelves are kept still some unbound magazines, etc., and\nthere used to be more papers and pamphlets.

It was appropriate to say\nthat interesting things had happened in the room and that\nsome men now dead still influence it, since it was naturally\nin that room that Mrs. Verrall's friends who were interested\nin psychical research had often been entertained, as well as\nmany other Cambridge men, some of whom are no longer\nliving.\nThe next passage is one of a small number where definite\nstatements with names are given which are probably quite\nimaginary. I have made enquiries at Nantwich and no trace\ncan be found of John Collins or his tombstone.\n1\nIt is a curious coincidence that a friend of Mrs. Verrall's, on being told\nof this description, remarked, \"But there is a bust in your dining-room.\"\nMrs. Verrall took him into the room and found that what he had vaguely\nsupposed to be a bust was really a large filter which stood in a rather dark\ncorner of the room.\n\f196 Alice Johnson.

Mrs.\nHolland apparently took it at the time to refer to Mr. Myers,\nthough, as will be seen, the script itself later repudiated\nthis interpretation. Next clay she saw in an Indian paper,\ndated November 10th, 1903, the announcement of the death\nof Lord Kowton. Afterwards she sent me this paper, contain-\ning the following notice :\n\" Obituary. London, Nov. 9. The\ndeath is announced of Lord Rowton,\" and told me that she\nhad met him in England some years before and had heard\nof his severe illness in 1902, but did not know he had\nbeen ill again. She ascertained later that the hour of his\nN\n\f198 Alice Johnson. [part\ndeath was 4.45 a.m. which is about equivalent to 10.45 a.m.\n(the hour of her script) in India. After hearing of his death,\nshe attempted to get from her script answers to various\nquestions about his illness, etc., and looked up the facts in the\nEnglish papers when they reached India. She found that\nthe statements in the script were partly correct and partly\nincorrect ; but in so far as they were correct, they do not\nseem to go beyond what she might have guessed from her\nknowledge of Lord Eowton. There remains the coincidence\nthat the description of a death is written at the time of his\ndeath. There is, however, nothing to suggest that the death\nreferred to has only just occurred ; the description would apply\nequally well to a long-past experience. Nevertheless the phrase\n\" I had many reasons for desiring to live\u2014the book for one\n\"\nwas appropriate to Lord Eowtou as well as to Mr. Myers,\nsince he had had the materials for a life of Lord Beaconsfield\nleft in his hands by the latter with the injunction not to\npublish anything for twenty years ; the time had now come\nand he had been planning the book.

Remember once again that the phantasm the so-called ghost is\na counterfeit presentment projected by the spirit. . . .\n(The writing ceased at 11.5.)\nThe theory here expressed as to the true nature of a\n\" ghost \" is no doubt derived from the first part of the chapter\non \" Phantasms of the Dead,\" in Human Personality, Vol. II.\n(see especially pp. 3-10). But Mrs. Verrall points out to me\nthe rather remarkable use of the words \" eidolon \" and \" simul-\nacrum,\" which do not occur in that chapter. The word\n\"Eidolon\" first occurs in Mrs. Holland's script on Nov. 7th,\n1903, in the communication addressed to Mrs. Verrall and\nquoted above (see p. 187). It is followed by some illegible\nscribbles, evidently representing an attempt to write Greek. A\nfew Greek characters are distinguishable, but no complete\nwords ; in fact, the whole effect is, I think, less like Greek\nthan would have been produced by a person ignorant of the\nlanguage who was deliberately trying to write it from his\nvisual memory of Greek phrases met with in English books.\nThese scribbles are followed by the words : Timor mortis.\n1\nBrowning, Rabbi Ben Ezra. \"Refused\" should be \"ignored.\"\n\f216 Alice Johnson. [part\nOn \" Eidolon \" and \" Simulacrum,\" Mrs. Verrall writes\n:\nHomer (Odyssey, XL 601) describes how Odysseus met in Hades\n\"great Herakles, his phantom (eiScoAov) ; himself (avrbs) rejoices amid\nthe immortals, etc.\" It is a famous passage, as the question of how\nHerakles came to be in Hades has been much discussed. It is the\npassage alluded to by Plotinus, in the extract quoted in Unman\nPersonality, Vol. II., p. 290.\nBut the point as regards Mrs. Holland's script is the scholarly\nand correct classical use of the words eidolon and simulacrum. This,\nfor instance, is Merry's note on another passage in the Odyssey,\nXL 213, where the eidolon of Odysseus' mother is allowed by\nPersephone to come :\n\" et'ScoAoi\/ is best represented by our word\n'phantom.' It is used almost identically with t^xv (spirit), as the\nimmaterial ghost that remains when the body is dead. But it\nimplies more than the notion of ^i>x7\n)> fi rst as conveying the idea\nof something unreal and illusive, and secondly as presenting a\nvisible though unsubstantial copy of the person whom it represents.\nThus [then various illustrations]. But the strongest passage for\ndeciding the use of the word, as meaning the unreal and phantom\nimage, is XL 601 [passage about Herakles], where the contrast\nbetween eiocoAov and auros (the man himself) is vividly brought out.\n. . . This notion of eiSwAoi\/ has many points in common with the\nLucretian simulacra.\"\nWhile we should not expect this usage to be known to one who\nwas not a classical scholar, it would be likely to be familiar\nto readers of Homer and Lucretius, and in the quotation from\nPlotinus in Human Personality we have direct proof (if it were\nwanted) that Mr. Myers knew the passage in the XL Odyssey, the\nlocus classicus for the special use of eiSwAov.\nOdysseus' meeting with the spirit of his mother in Hades is\nreferred to in Human Personality, Vol. II., p. 256, where two\nlines from the Odyssey (XI. 88, 89) are quoted. The words\nin question do not occur in these lines.\nThe passage from Plotinus. referred to by Mrs. Verrall, is\nthus translated in Human Personality (Vol. II. p. 290): \"The\nshade of Herakles, indeed, may talk of his own valour to the\nshades ; but the true Herakles in the true world will deem all\nthat of little worth. . .\n.\"\nAnother version which is likely to be familiar to Mrs.\nHolland is the following\n:\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter II. 217\n\" And as the auld-farrand hero sees\nIn Hell a bode Hercules\nPit there the lesser deid to please,\nWhile he himsel'\nDwells with the muckle gods at ease\nFar raised frae hell.\" 1\nBut in neither of these versions does the word e'!$w\\oi> or\nsimulacrum occur.

On two occasions only I myself have been able to\nperceive the surroundings I so desired to see\u2014once [illegible] at a\nMeeting and you all appeared to me as flat cardboard figures seen\nthrough a grey mist\u2014 The next time was a few weeks ago at\nhome . . .\nI would try so hard on the anniversary that is only nine days\naway now if I could be sure that you really wished and desired\nmy eidolon without any fear or reluctance\nAny terror would distress me unspeakably.\nIn my present state thoughts pain me more than wounds or\nburns could do while I lived\u2014 It is part of the stage through\nwhich I pass an evolutionary phase. . . .\nThis script seems to show a possible connection with Mrs.\nVerrall's of December 10th, 1901 (see Mrs. Verrall's Eeport,\nin Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XX., p. 213) in which the following\noccurs\n:\nBetwixt dark and light a gray figure in the bedroom not [to be\nfeared] 1\nyou will see on an anniversary \u2014note the date\u2014this year.\nPut the [conversation] on [paper] that is all I can see. Try other\nnights.\nHere, then, is the same idea of a phantasm, not to be\nfeared, to be seen on an anniversary\u2014which in Mrs. Holland's\nscript is indicated as that of Mr. Myers's death, January 17th.\nMrs. Verrall's script of Dec, 10th, 1901, also showed con-\nnection with that of Mrs. Piper, for on January 28th, 1902, at\na sitting of Dr. Hodgson's with Mrs. Piper in America, reference\nwas made by the Myers control to a \"vision\" of a figure which\nit was said had been seen recently by Miss Verrall. As a\n1\nThe words in square brackets are almost indecipherable in the original, but\nI follow Mrs. Verrall's interpretation of them, made without reference to\nMrs. Holland's script.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter III. 219\nmatter of fact, no such vision was seen either by Mrs. or Miss\nVerrall during this period. But at the same sitting with Mrs.\nPiper on January 28th, 1902, the control arranged with Dr.\nHodgson to try a definite experiment in appearing to Miss\nVerrall, and on February 4th claimed that he had succeeded\nin making himself visible to her. Again the attempt failed, but\na remarkable connection appeared between the circumstances of\nthe supposed vision and some script of Mrs. Verrall's produced\non January 31st, 1902 (see her Report, pp. 213-17). All\nthis, of course, happened without any knowledge on the part\nof either automatist as to the doings of the other.\nCHAPTER III.\nFirst Cross-Correspondence with Mrs. Verrall :\nThe Selwyn Text Incident.\nIn this chapter I have put together passages in Mrs. Holland's\nscript of December, 1903, and January, 1904, with certain\npassages in Mrs. Verrall's script of about the same period\nwhich seem to be more or less directly connected with them,\nthough, owing to the fact that I did not see Mrs. Verrall's\nscript at the time, no connection was discovered till nearly\ntwo years later.\nA summary of the circumstances will enable the reader\nto appreciate better the connection between the two scripts.\nAt this time (about the end of 1903), I knew only of\na few incidents in Mrs. Verrall's script and had seen very\nlittle of it. Nothing had been published on the subject\n;\nbut Mrs. Verrall had read two papers about it at Private\nMeetings of the Society, on October 17th, 1902, and April\n20th, 1903, brief abstracts of which had been printed in\nthe Journal S.P.R. for November, 1902, and May, 1903.\nDuring the latter part of 1903, as stated in Mrs. Verrall's\nReport on her script (published in October, 1906, Proceedings\nS.P.R., Vol. XX.\u2014See especially, pp. 295-298 and 419-423),\nrepeated efforts were made in it to give a message from\nDr. Sidgwick about three letters. On October 10th, 1903,\n\f220 Alice Johnson. [part\nMrs. Verrall was instructed by the script to ask Mrs. Sidgwick\nto give her a \" test question \" to be answered by it, after\nwhich further evidence was to be expected. Mrs. Verrall\nacting on this instruction, received from Mrs. Sidgwick the\nquestion :\n\" What was the last of Dr. Sidgwick's texts,\u2014the\none that belonged to the latter part of his life ?\n\" The\nquestion referred to a subject unknown to Mrs. Verrall, and\nthus described in the Memoir of Dr. Sidgwick (p. 125):\n\" During most of his adult life Sidgwick had some text\u2014\na\ndifferent one at different periods\u2014which ran in his head,\nrepresenting the key-note, so to speak, of his thought about\nhis own life. [Four texts belonging to the earlier periods are\nthen given.] Finally, from about 1890, 'Gather up the\nfragments that remain, that nothing be lost.'\n1 \" The Memoir\nwas not published till the end of February, 1906, and at this\ntime Dr. Sidgwick's texts can only have been known to his\nnearest relatives.\nMrs. Verrall told no one that she had received this question\nfrom Mrs. Sidgwick, and her script was\u2014for evidential purposes\n\u2014sent to Sir Oliver Lodge, as it was produced, in envelopes\nwhich he filed and kept unopened. The script now began a\nlong series of allusions to Faith, Hope and Charity and their\ncomparative merits, quoting part of I Cor. xiii. 13 (\"And now\nabideth faith, hope, charity, these three ; but the greatest of\nthese is charity \"), and finally attaching special value to the\nvirtue of Hope. Mrs. Verrall thought that these passages-\nmight be an attempt to describe the contents of a sealed\nenvelope\u2014perhaps one of the three letters already referred\nto\u2014left by Dr. Sidgwick ; or might merely represent guesses\nof the subliminal self, started by the suggestion that a text\nwas wanted.\nOn December 11th, 1903, Dr. and Mrs. Verrall went to\nAlgeria, and the writing was continued there. On December\n25th, it stated that she was to ask the question on the 17th\nof next month, and a reference closely following to \" Sidgwick's\nmessage,\" made it clear that the question meant was the one\nabout the text. Further this script quotes a text similar in\nmeaning to the one required, viz. :\n\" Use the daylight hours,\nfor the night cometh when no man may work.\"\n1\nSt. John, vi. 12.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter III. 221\nThe admonition to write on the 17th was repeated on\nJanuary 9th, 1904, and on January 17th, remarks about S,\na letter, an envelope and a seal, and the words \" not without\nhope \" were followed by the statement :\n\" The question is\nanswered,\" and later by :\n\" The text and the answer are one\nand are \"iven.\" Nevertheless, no definite statement as to a\ntext ivas given in this script, but again, on May 11th, 1904,\nthe script gave a clue which led Mrs. Verrall to a second\nparaphrase of the text required.\nThe passages in the script, though relating to Dr. Sidgwick,\npurported in general to come from Mr. Myers.\nMeanwhile Mrs. Holland, in India, was sending her script\nto me, and I occasionally showed passages of it to Mr.\nPiddington, but (at this time) to no one else. Throughout\nthe autumn of 1903 her script (large portions of which have\nbeen already quoted), expresses a strong desire on the part\nof the \" controls \" to communicate, which becomes specially\nintense in January, 1904, when it is stated on January 12th\nthat some special message is to be transmitted to Mr. Myers's\nfriends. The climax comes on January 17th, 1 904,\u2014the\nday on which, as we have just seen, Mrs. Verrall's script\nrefers to a sealed envelope, and states that the question is\nanswered and the text given. On this day Mrs. Holland's\nscript refers (1) to an attempt to get a message through,\n(2) to a sealed envelope, and (3) to a text, giving the reference\nonly, I. Cor. xvi. 13 (\"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit\nyou like men, be strong \").\nThis text, though not the one asked for by Mrs. Sidgwick,\nhas a certain special association with Mr. Myers and Mrs.\nVerrall, to be explained below.\nApart from the similarity of topics in both scripts on\nJanuary 17th, 1904, there are a number of minor corre-\nspondences between them during the whole period.\nBoth writers refer beforehand to the date, Jan. 17th, 1904.\nThe Holland-Myers (if I may coin the term) is clearly looking\nforward to this as the anniversary of his death (see references\non Nov. 20th, p. 203, Dec. 1st, 1903, p. 230, and Jan. 8th,\n1904, p. 218); the Verrall-Myers gives two specific directions\n(on Dec. 25th, 1903, and Jan. 9th, 1904) to write on Jan.\n17th. Mr. Myers attached great importance to anniversaries, a\n\f222 Alice Johnson, [part\nfact which was probably known to Mrs. Verrall and certainly\nunknown to Mrs. Holland. Both knew the date of his death,\nand this might have led to both producing writing on that\nclay; but it can hardly be held to account for the similarity\nbetween the two writings.\nIn both cases references are made to the difficulty of one\nsensitive working alone and the advantages of co-operation\n(Mrs. Holland, Sept. 21st, Nov. 7th, Dec. 1st and 5th, 1903;\nMrs. Verrall, Oct. 12th and 19th, and Dec. 7th, 1903).\nMrs. Verrall is told (Oct. 19, 1903) that evidence will\ncome to her later through others ; and Mrs. Holland (Jan.\n5th, 1904) that the message has a meaning not for her,\nbut for others, and, though the \" others \" are not specified,\nthat each automatist is to supplement statements given through\nthe other is a natural interpretation.\nThere is a certain resemblance between the descriptions of\ntheir own attitude given by the controls through both sensitives.\nThe Verrall-Myers speaks (Dec. 29th, 1903) of the voice\nof one crying in the wilderness; the Holland-Myers (Jan 5th,\n1904) of words said, shouted, sung to the wind, and again\n(on Jan. 12th, 1904), of one wailing as the wind wails,\nwordless and unheeded. The Holland-Myers (Jan. 6th, 1904)\nrefers to the missionary spirit longing to speak to the souls\nin prison ; the Verrall-Myers, in a very obscure passage (Feb.\n2nd, 1904), to slaves in prison, and prodigies done by the\npure, presumably on their behalf.\nFurther, the Verrall-Myers remarks (Dec. 27, 1903):\n\" Comes the message, but is not understanded of any \" ; and\nthe Holland-Myers (on Jan. 27th, 1904) expresses his bitter\ndisappointment that the message, on which apparently so\nmuch effort had been spent, had not made any real impression\non his friends.\nThis is strikingly appropriate, since, as a matter of fact,\nit was not until October, 1905, that any correspondence was\ndiscovered between the two series of scripts, while the minor\nresemblances were not observed till I was preparing this\nreport for publication.\nI now give in full the passages referred to, quoting in both\ncases from the original writings, since Mrs. Verrall has kindly\nlent me the whole of her script for the purposes of this\n\flv.] A utomatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter III. 223\npaper.

On that date (see below) the script is dealing\nwith the two constellations of Ariadne's crown and Berenice's\nhair, and involves an interesting cross-correspondence with\nMrs. Piper, as related in Mrs. Verrall's Beport (pp. 308-9 and\n427-29). It contains two side-allusions\u2014apparently arising\nfrom association of ideas : Berenice's hair suggests \" Mary\nMagdalene and the nard,\" and Ariadne, deserted and lamenting,\nseems to suggest the voice crying in the wilderness\u2014for the\nVulgate phrase vox clamantis is applied to her on Oct. 5th,\nwhile it is used more in its original sense on Dec. 29th.\nI italicise in this extract the words relating to this aspect\nof Ariadne.\n(Oct. 5, 1903. 6.50 p.m.)\n(In latin : Dawn made it with a great sound of conches, whilst\nthe breath of the west wind hung above.

M.'s letter in the charge of Dr. Hodgson ?\n\"\nthat being the envelope about which I have long thought the script\nhad been writing.

Cf. also Oct. 19,\n21, 23, Nov. 17 for Hope\u2014and earlier scripts (about Sept., 1903) for\ncontents of Envelope.\nI regard the script of January 17th, 1904, as the climax\nof this particular cross-correspondence, such as it is ; but I\nquote next a later passage which seems to show a possible\nconnection with Mrs. Holland's script of Jan. 6th, 1904\n(see p. 231), for the last words: \"Find this\u2014it happened\u2014it\nis a clue,\" appear to indicate that some connection is to be\nlooked for. The passage begins by describing the utterances\nof a prophetic and oracular voice \u2014perhaps a variant of the\nvoice crying in the wilderness\u2014and goes on to speak of a\nlarge prison, in which slaves are confined.\n(February 2nd, 1904.)\n(In latin and Greek : When I greatly wish, I cannot express to\nyou what I want to say.

It corresponds to\nthe Greek nvKa.op.ai, which is used in much the same senses, but seems to be\nspecially associated, at least once, with the Erinyes.

The description of the book\nsuggested to her a \" Temple Classic,\" since one set of the\nbooks in that series are fiat (i.e. thin) and green, with flexible\nbindings and wide margins. As the script was in the hand-\nwriting of the Sidgwick control, she asked Mrs. Sidgwick on\nNovember 21st, 1906, if she had any \"Temple Classics.\" Two\nThis last word is regularly used for Delphi itself as the seat of prophecy.

[part\nIn-\nthe passage next to be quoted, the original script shows\nsigns of emotional strain and intensity impossible to reproduce\nin a printed copy. The Gurney control, writing in pencil,\ntells the automatist that her hand will be left alone, and she\nis to write down a message transmitted to her brain. He\nthen tells her to take a pen. She does so and the passage\nthat follows is in her own ordinary hand-writing. Then she\nbreaks off, noting \" I am very restless, etc.\" The script begins\nagain in the writing of the Myers control, complaining that\nshe is not giving the method of experiment a fair trial.\nThus urged, she makes a fresh attempt in her ordinary hand-\nwriting and gives\u2014not quite correctly\u2014the first two lines of\nMr. Myers's poem, St. Paul. (Mrs. Holland told me later\nthat she had never read this poem, and was quite unaware\ntill I told her that she had quoted from it in her script.\nNevertheless she supposes, as I do, that she had probably\nseen these lines quoted somewhere, and that she reproduced\nthem from her subliminal memory.) After some general\nreflections, the hand-writing gradually changes again, as if\nby an overpowering impulse, into that of the Myers control,\nexpressing with passionate energy his desire to \" reach you\n\u2014\nreach anyone.\" Here the writing becomes large and emphatic,\nthen stops dead, and the Gurney control resumes in pencil,\n\" Why did you let your hand yield ?

The\nonly previous occasion on which this request was specially made\nwas in the script of November 7th, 1903 (quoted above,\np. 186), when Mrs. Verrall's name and address were given,\nand which also contains a certain amount of evidential matter.\nThe last script to be quoted in this connection was sent to\nme with some other in a letter dated March 10th, 1904, in\nwhich Mrs. Holland writes :\n\" I enclose a final page of very\nincoherent writing.

Comes the Jan. 27, 1904. I cannot feel\nOne more point is perhaps worth mentioning. The reader\nwho compares the general character of the two scripts can\nhardly fail to notice the emotional nature and the note of\npersonal appeal in the utterances of the Holland-Myers as\ncontrasted with the calmer, more impersonal, and more matter-\nof-fact tone of the Verrall-Myers.\nThe contrast may, of course, represent nothing more than\na difference in the automatists' own conceptions of the per-\nsonality ;\nfor, on any reasonable view of the facts, it is I think\ninevitable that the presentation of the personality should be\nlargely coloured by their normal knowledge of its supposed\noriginal.\nStill, it may be admitted that if Mr. Myers really knew\nwhat was going on and if he was really concerned in the\nproduction of the scripts, it would be natural and appropriate\nthat he should attempt to impress the two automatists in these\ndifferent ways. \u2022\nMrs. Verrall, a personal friend and trained\ninvestigator, was already familar with scientific methods and\nin close touch with other investigators. She did not require\nurging to go on with her writing, from which some important\nevidence had already resulted.\nMrs. Holland, on the other hand, was in an isolated position ;\nshe was conscious of the superficially trivial and incoherent\nnature of her script, and could not tell whether there was\nanything in it beyond a dream-like richauffe\" of her own\nthoughts. She would naturally shrink from exposing this to\nstrangers and thereby appearing to attach an unreasonable\ndegree of importance to it. We may suppose then that the\ncontrol realises her situation and tries to impress on her a\nvivid realisation of his own,\u2014his intense desire to provide\nevidence of survival. The reiterations in her script as compared\nwith Mrs. Verrall's,\u2014a point brought out rather strikingly in\nthe summary,\u2014denotes perhaps that a more strenuous effort\nis required in her case, in order that she may be persuaded to\nmessage, but is not under-\nstanded of any\nas if I had made any true\nimpression upon them.\nComparison of the Myers Controls.\n\f240 Alice Johnson.

In a letter dated Feb. 25th, 1905, she says:\n\" I cannot tell you how glad I should be to know if the long-\ning for recognition (it is such a passionate craving sometimes\nthat I find myself crying out :\n'\nIf I could help you \u2014Oh ! if\nI could only help you\n!\n' while I write) is a real influence\nfrom beyond or only my own imaginings. But why should\nmy imagination take that form ?

This feeling has been\nstrong enough to make me cry and to make me speak aloud.\nI do not often dwell upon it.

I have discontinued any practice of automatic writing for\nnearly a year, as the shock and jar of any chance interruption\nseemed out of all proportion to the value of anything I obtained.\nHowever this morning I had an unexpected impulse to write\n\u2014\nsentences which as usual mean nothing to me personally\u2014and I\nenclose the ''message,\" together with a sudden scribble which came\none evening last month.\nThe two pieces of script enclosed were :\n\u2014\n(Jan. 16th, 1905.)\nI am that one whose music\nWas never given voice\nI am the dumb musician\nWho made no hearts rejoice\nI went down to the silence\nMy years but half fulfilled\nThe brain's work unaccomplished\nThe empty hands unskilled.\nI will tell you who wrote that\u2014 He came away about 16 years\nago\u2014 He was very tall thin to emaciation\u2014a tender humourous [sic]\nwhimsical face with eyes that smiled oftener than his mouth.

It was opened on December\n13th, 1904, and its contents were then found to have no\nresemblance to what was alleged about it in the script. An\naccount of this experiment was printed in the Journal S.P.R.\nfor January 1905, which came out on January 17th. The\nWestminster Gazette of the same clay contained a paragraph\nstating briefly the facts given in the Journal, and this para-\ngraph was widely copied into other English papers. Mrs.\nVerrall's name was not mentioned in the newspaper accounts,\nonly Sir Oliver Lodge's, and similarly his name, and not\nMrs. Verrall's, appears in Mrs. Holland's script. All these\nfacts being of course familiar to me, I concluded that Mrs.\nHolland had most probably seen one of the newspaper\naccounts of the incident. I therefore wrote to ask her whether\n1\nSwinburne, The Garden of Proserpine :\n\" And. all dead years draw thither\nAnd all disastrous things.\"\n2\nD. G. Rossetti, For a Venetian Pastoral by Giorgione.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 248\nshe had read the script carefully after writing it and whether\nit suggested to her anything that she had ever seen in any\nprinted book or paper ; also whether she was aware of having\nheard anything at all in connection with the S.P.R, or any\nmembers of it since coming to England, and if so, what. I\nalso suggested that in future she should for evidential purposes\nnote any facts that she happened to hear or read about the\nS.P.R. or its members, with the date and source of the infor-\nmation. In reply to my letter Mrs. Holland wrote :\n\u2014\nFeb. 21st, 1905.\nI have never been in the habit of carefully reading over the\nautomatic writing that comes to me, unless I feel a personal appeal\nin it. In the case of what I sent you the other day I only\nlooked carefully at the first words to make sure they were legible.\nIt was a thing apart from me. However I will in future go over\nit carefully and try to trace out any connection. I very seldom\nhear the name of your Society mentioned, and as I am in the\nhabit of concealing the interest I take in it, I never hear any news\nconcerning it or its members. I have never seen any of the\nProceedings, and Human Personality is the only book in connection\nwith it that I have ever read.\nI remember an article in the December Fortnightly on the \"Pro-\ngress of Psychical Research \" ; but I read it hurriedly, and have\nonly a vague recollection that it advocated further study.\nI will do as you suggest in the future and note anything I may\nhear or read about the Society.\nI found that the article on \" The Progress of Psychical\nResearch \" (by Mr. F. C. S. Schiller) in the Fortnightly Review\nfor January, 1905, contained no mention of experiments with\nsealed envelopes or of Sir Oliver Lodge.\nI did not refer, however, to the subject again in writing\nto Mrs. Holland, as I was hoping to meet her later, and\nthought it would be best to discuss it fully in a personal\ninterview.\nThis interview\u2014the first I had with her\u2014took place on\nOctober 6th, 1905, and lasted about 2 A hours, when many\ntopics in the script were discussed. Among other things I\nshowed her an early passage describing the circumstances of\nthe death of a friend of my own, of whom I thought it very\n\f244 Alice Johnson. [part\nunlikely that she had ever heard. She said she had no idea\nwhat the writing was about, and remembered nothing of it.\nI then began to tell her in full the details of the actual\ncircumstances. Before I had got far, she suddenly interrupted\nme, saying, \" Oh, I know all about that\u2014it was so-and-so.\"\nIt appeared that she had seen this lady on one occasion only,\nhappened to know a little about her, and had heard of her\ndeath at the time, rather more than four years before the\nscript referred to it. She had been unaware, however, of the\nreference in the script, which was given in a somewhat veiled\nform, till I pointed it out to her.\nLater in the interview, I read over to her the script of\nFebruary 15th, 1905, quoted above, and asked if it conveyed\nany meaning to her. Apparently it did not. I then told\nher of the experiment of the sealed envelope and its result\n;\nthat it had been printed in our Journal for January, 1905,\nand had at once got into the newspapers, and been widely\ncopied ; and I asked her if she thought she had seen any\nreference to it. She answered very decidedly that she had no\nrecollection of ever seeing or hearing anything about it till\nthat moment. I asked if she thought it possible that she\ncould have forgotten it, if she had read it. She thought this\nimpossible, as she would certainly have been greatly interested\nin it ; she always noticed and read eagerly everything relating\nto Mr. Myers. She remembered the passage in Human Per-\nsonality recommending such experiments to be made (Vol. II.,\np. 499), and told me of another magazine article she had\nread some time ago which she thought might have contained\nreferences to the subject. (I afterwards read this article, and\nfound in it only a reference to supposed communications from\nMr. Myers through automatic writing.)\nAt a later interview with Mrs. Holland (May 29th, 1906)\nI showed her the paragraph in the Westminster Gazette about\nthe opening of the sealed envelope, and cross-questioned her\nagain as to the possibility of her normal knowledge of it. She\nrepeated that she was certain she had never heard of it till I\ntold her, and that she thought it quite impossible that she\ncould have seen it and forgotten it.\nI give this incident in full because it cannot fail to appear\nsuspicious to an outsider, and I know it to be Mrs. Holland's\n\fLV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 245\ndesire to suppress nothing that might lead to an adverse view\nof the phenomena. But I may point out that if she had\nread any of the newspaper accounts, she must have known\nthat I also should have read them ; that therefore my\nsuspicions would be at once excited by what looked like a\nreproduction from a source apparently so obvious, and that,\nunder the circumstances, the script could not be regarded as\nevidential. All this, I say, must have been clear to her if she\nhad seen a newspaper account.\nOn the other hand, the references to my friend's death\nmight well appear evidential, as it would have been difficult\nfor me to find out that she had known of it, unless she had\ntold me herself. Yet in this case she explained to me at\nonce the circumstances that had led to her knowledge of it,\nas she has clone in many other cases where the source of her\nknowledge or apparent knowledge was not obvious to me.\nIt may be worth adding that, as Mrs. Verrall informs me,\nSwinburne's Garden of Proserpine (a quotation from which\nappears in the script under discussion) used to be constantly\nrecited by Mr. Myers at sittings, and that she herself used\noften to ask him to recite it.\nThe next passages illustrate the effect of Mrs. Holland's\nnormal knowledge on the script. In a letter dated March\n6th, 1905, she says: \"About articles in papers referring to\nthe S.P.R., last autumn I remember one in the Morning Post\nby Mr. Andrew Lang about some Fragments in prose and\nverse (I cannot remember the proper name) by Mr. Myers.\nI found the book in a library presently and looked over it,\nhoping for something akin to Human Personality, but I was\ndisappointed. I am certain I have never read anything else\nof his.\"\nIn another letter (dated February 25th, 1905) she remarked\nincidentally :\n\" Did I tell you that I read very quickly and\nam a proverb in my family for '\ntearing the heart ' out of a\nbook or paper in a few minutes ? I fear this habit makes me\nvery sketchy.\"\nAt my first interview with Mrs. Holland on October 6th,\n1905, I asked her how long a time she had spent in looking\nat Mr. Myers's Fragments of Prose and.

[part\nsidering she said she did not think she could have spent more\nthan 8 or 10 minutes over it; as it was in a library where\npeople did not sit to read books, but only looked at them, and\nturned them over casually.\nNevertheless, the influence of the book is very marked ; it\ncontains, for instance, portraits of Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney,\nand Dr. Sidgwick, and the result is seen at once in the greater\ndefiniteness of her conception of the controls, whose personal\nappearance now begins to be described, though she is apparently\nunaware or but half aware of how she came to be acquainted\nwith it (see below, p. 264).\nThus :\u2014\n(February 21st, 1905.)\nThree stand together\n\u2014\nOne has a long white beard he is nearly bald His eyes are\ngrey very shrewd yet very kindly\u2014 His nose is rather long\n\u2014\nit is a scholar's face\n\u2014\nOne looks young\u2014 Tall and very thin \u2014long limbed and loose\njointed \u2014 He has a long mustache [sic] \u2014 The strong rounded chin\nis clean shaven\u2014 The face is long and the eyes look tired\u2014\nThe third man has a short pointed beard\u2014 His dark hair is\nthin and turning grey it has receded from his forehead making\nthe brow .look very lofty\u2014 He has fine dark eyes with something\npathetic and appealing in their expression\n\u2014\nHenry Edmund Fred\n\u2014\n(I was interrupted by a visitor for an hour and when I took up\nthe pencil again no more writing came\u2014 I cannot associate the\nabove with anything I have been reading or thinking.

I did not receive this script until\nthe end of January, 1904, and as Mrs. Holland told me at\nabout the same time that she was leaving India early in April\nfor a long visit to Europe, I replied that I thought I could\narrange for experiments of the kind suggested, but that it\nmight be better to put them off for the present, as she was\nlikely to be specially busy preparing for her move.\nThere was a gap of nearly a year in our correspondence\nand in her script while she was travelling. I heard from\nher again on Feb. 15th, 1905, as related above. Meanwhile\n1 kept the suggestion in mind, and on Feb. 24th, 1905, I\nwrote to her as follows :\n... I should like now to suggest an experiment to you, which\nI think might have interesting results. Would you be inclined to\ntry writing once a week on a certain day, which I would ask you\nto fix, and I would then arrange for a friend of mine who is also\nan automatic writer to write on the same day, and each of you to\nsend your writing to me to be compared, when I think it is\npossible that some correspondence might be found between the two\nsets of writing, or some evidence of telepathy between the writers.\nI have suggested this to my friend and she is very willing to try\nit. She suggested beginning the experiments as early as possible\nin March and continuing once a week, say for six weeks. Then\nif the results were successful, it might be worth going on longer.\nMy friend thought it might be best not to fix the time of day, as\nit might be difficult both for her and for you to keep to a regular\nhour, whereas if you wrote always on the same day, that would,\nI think, be sufficient for practical evidential purposes.\nI have not told her your name nor anything about you, except\nthat I have been receiving automatic writing from you for some\ntime, and that I thought you did not talk much to any one else\nabout it. I also mentioned that you lived in India but were now\nover here, and that you were married. ... If you will fix a day\nof the week and tell me when you will begin, I will ask her to\nbegin on the same day.\nMrs. Holland replied to me as follows\n:\nFebruary 25th, 1905.\n. . . The experiment you suggest interests me very much and I\nshould like to try it. Will you ask your friend to begin on next\n\fLV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 251\nWednesday, March 1st, and to try writing on each Wednesday in\nMarch and on to April 5th ? If I have a strong impulse to write\non other days, I will not ignore it, but I will only deliberately try\nfor writing on Wednesdays. . . .\nI then arranged that the experiments should begin on\nMarch 1st, the friend with whom I had arranged them being\nMrs. Verrall.\nMrs. Holland knew Mrs. Verrall by name, as she is men-\ntioned in Human Personality as \" Mrs. A. W. Verrall, a lecturer\nat Newnham College,\" in connection with experiments in crystal\nvision, a subject in which Mrs. Holland was specially interested,\nand the name had actually occurred, obviously as a reminiscence\nof Human Personality, in Mrs. Holland's script of Nov. 7th,\n1903 (quoted above, p. 186). In commenting on this script\nto Mrs. Holland, however, I had not mentioned Mrs. Verrall\nat all ; the latter had only begun to practise automatic writing\nafter Human Personality was written, and nothing about her\nscript had yet been published\u2014two brief abstracts only having\nappeared in the Journal S.P.E. (printed for private circulation).\nThere was therefore no ground for a guess on Mrs. Holland's\npart that Mrs. Verrall was her fellow-experimenter, whereas a\ngood many automatic writers\u2014-of whom I might have chosen\none\u2014are mentioned in Human Personality. When I talked\nto her about it some time later (May 28\/06) she assured\nme that she had never imagined Mrs. Verrall did anything\npsychic except crystal gazing, and that she had made no\nguess as to who her fellow-experimenter was and had not the\nslightest idea of it till I told her. Nevertheless, I do not think\nit can be stated with absolute confidence that the mention of\n\" Mrs. V.\" in her first day's script (see below) was beyond\nthe possibility of subliminal guessing.\nThroughout this series of experiments (and in all future\nones tried between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall) the writers\nheld no communication with each other at all, but each\nsent her writing to me and communicated only with me\nabout it.\nIf any statement was made in one writing purporting to\nrefer, or that I thought might refer, to the circumstances of\nthe other writer, I sent a copy of the whole or part of the\nscript to this latter for her comments.

On the ledge of the [drawing room] window looking\ninto the greenhouse\u2014on the greenhouse side \u2014were three pots of\ngrowing yellow tulips, \u2014the only flowers near any window.\nThe day was dull in the morning, but about 12 the sun came\nout and it was warm ; it rained heavily in the afternoon. The birds\nhave naturally been chirping lately. No traffic or roar of any kind in\nour road [Selwyn Gardens is not a thoroughfare] ... At 9 a.m.\n(about) I cleared away all cut flowers except the daffodils described\n;\ntill then there had been some red tulips.\nThe text, \" Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you\nlike men,\" is, as already said, inscribed in Greek over the\nfront gate of Selwyn College, this being the text of which\nthe reference only was given in Mrs. Holland's script of\nJanuary 17th, 1904, quoted and discussed above, see p. 234,\nwhere its connection with Mr. Myers and Mrs. Verrall is\nexplained.\nThat this text should occur again on the first day of\nMrs. Holland's experiments with Mrs. Verrall is to my mind\nthe most noteworthy point in the script, for, even supposing\nthat Mrs. Holland had subliminally guessed that Mrs. Verrall\nwas her fellow-experimenter, this could not account for the\nappropriate introduction of the text.\nMrs. Verrall's script of March 1st, 1905, written at 6 p.m.,\ncontains the following\n:\nv. iii. black letter text\n* * * *\nDon't identify it might alarm her.\nThe last sentence, perhaps, shows a vague general resemblance\nto the last paragraph of Mrs. Holland's script.

March 15th\nand March 19th, 1905, just quoted, were the first occasions\non which they have appeared in Mrs. Verrall's script, and they\nhave only recurred there once, viz. on September 5th, 1906,\nwhich seems to be a reminiscence of this occasion.\nProfessor Eichet is again referred to here. His presidential\naddress, delivered on Feb. 6th, 1905, was on the subject of\n\" metapsychics,\" a term which he coined to include all the\ntopics dealt with in psychical research. Brief reports of his\naddress, including the new word, had appeared in the papers.\nI found on enquiring from Mrs. Holland later (on Oct. 6th,\n1905) that she could not remember having seen any of these\nreports, or having heard the word \" metapsychics \" ; but she\nmay of course have seen and forgotten them. She could not\neven remember that she had ever heard of Professor Richet\n;\nbut as he is mentioned several times in Human Personality,\nshe must have seen the name there.\nI sent a copy of this script to Mrs. Verrall and she sent\nme the following notes on it\n:\n^f.

This is characteristic of Mr. Myers's\nname, as can be seen in any of his title pages ; he used to say that\nto spell it with a k was one of the blunders he should make when\nhe tried to communicate.\nIn her letter of March 24th, 1905, enclosing the script of\nMarch 22nd, Mrs. Holland wrote:\nI wonder if the jottings I enclose convey any meaning to you. It\nis an impression that has come to me very strongly within the last\nfew days and I have written it down to get rid of it.

Reserved to a fault. She\nis beginning to attain to a faith she once thought she had outgrown.\nThis description, which is not unlike the one given on Jan.\n5th, 1904 (see above, p. 212), might naturally be taken to\napply to Mrs. Holland's fellow-experimenter, and accordingly\nI sent it to Mrs. Verrall for her comments. She wrote on\nApril 4th, 1905 :\nMy husband and I think this description fairly good, as far as it\ngoes, though there are no very distinctive points. The eyes and lashes\nare entirely wrong ; but there is no other blatant misdescription.\nOf course, like every one of my age, I have lost many relatives and\nfriends. [The remarks about the trinkets, though not very definite,\nare certainly appropriate.] I have only had two dresses this winter\nthat were not black, one evening dress, grey, and a dull green day dress,\nboth with wide belts, but who does not wear wide belts ? I have\na trick with my lower lip of which I am aware, as it is due to a\ncriticism on my mouth made when I was a child. I am apt to\ndraw it in and let the upper lip project, showing the two front teeth.\nI think that Mrs. Verrall's friends would consider the\ndescription of character in many points very apt.\nThe last passage worth quoting during this series of experi-\nments occurs in Mrs. Verrall's script of April 5th, 1905 :\nA gate and beyond a common and a windswept sky hedges on\neach side of the gate\u2014alder and guelder rose not quickset\nlook through the gate to the western sky, and long straight lines\nof cloud with clear green blue sky between since the clearing.\nThat is all I see that peaceful landscape.\nOf this description Mrs. Holland wrote to me (April 11th,\n1905) : \"... the gate in the hedge looking to the western\nsky and a peaceful landscape applies to my surroundings last\nWednesday [i.e. April 5th].\" She told me later (May 28th,\n1906) that the description was applicable to the garden gate\nof her father's house, where she was then staying, but that\nthe particular trees mentioned were not characteristic.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter IV. 259\nDuring the next six weeks, Mrs. Holland was travelling on\nthe Continent. Meanwhile she attempted every Wednesday to\nconvey an impression and one definite word, chosen and noted\nby herself, to her fellow-experimenter. These impressions re-\nlated to the places that she was visiting. She sent me her\nnotes after returning to England ; but I found that in no case\nhad Mrs. Verrall's script shown any coincidence with the\ntopics selected.\nAfter this Mrs. Verrall tried for a few weeks (from May\n31st, 1905) to convey ideas chosen by herself to Mrs. Holland ;\nbut these experiments also were quite unsuccessful.\nFourth Period : May 31st to August 8th, 1905.\nMrs. Holland only produced seven pieces of script during\nthis period and there is little of interest to note about it.\nShe had now returned from the Continent but was moving\nabout a good deal, and it is possible that this produced an\nunsettled state of mind which was unfavourable.\nAs usual, much of the script purports to come from Mr.\nMyers, but there is a sudden development of a new control\n\u2014\nLaurence Oliphant, who predominates during this period.

I am familiar\nwith the lines, \" When the Invisible grows to fulfilment,\" and\n\"The woman-soul leadeth us upward and on,\" but I cannot remember\nif they have anything to do with each other, or where they come\nfrom.\nI have the impression that all the writing this time is meant to\ncome from one influence, and it is a new one, or nearly so. The\nuntidy marks at the end mean that I broke off in a fit of shivering,\nwinch I took to mean that I had written enough. There was\nnot the slightest approach to a trance condition, it was like a\nrather slow dictation. I have a funny confused impression of a\ngroup of three women and one man. One of the women is elderly.\nThe \" message \" comes from the man chiefly, but sometimes the\nyoungest woman of the three joins in, as it were. This sounds\nfantastic, but as the writing came before noon on a sunny morning,\nI did not dream it. Also if I note it down, I shan't worry about\nit, or attach undue importance to it.\nThis description appears to me to involve a kind of dis-\nsociation of consciousness which I suspect frequently occurs\nin cases of automatism. To Mrs. Holland's supraliminal\nconsciousness comes an impression of a group of three women\nand one man ; one is an elderly woman, the message comes\nchiefly from the man, but sometimes the youngest woman\njoins in. \" It is a new influence, or nearly so,\" she remarks.\nMeanwhile the writing done by her subliminal consciousness\nshows clearly that these persons are Laurence Oliphant, his\nmother, and his first and second wives,\n1\nwho have only pur-\nported to control once before, on May 31st. But for the\nmoment the recognition seems confined to her subliminal self;\nsupraliminally she only conceives of them as a group of persons\nunidentified.\nA similar experience is described on July 27th, 1905.\nHere she writes automatically the one word \" Maud,\" and\nthen goes on in her normal hand-writing\n:\nAutomatic script seems unwilling to come and instead I have an\nimpulse to note a waking dream last night.

A pale face,\nthat of a man no longer young ; a high brow, dark hair going\ngrey, a moustache and small pointed beard I think, but the chin\nwas drawn in and the chief impression given was that of the high\nbrow and the dark eyes that were at once penetrating and sad.\nNo impression of figure or dress, only the face. After a minute or\ntwo it went away and was followed by the face of a younger man\nwith a strong chin and a long moustache ; but almost before I\ncould realize this face it went, and an old man with white beard\nand glasses showed a fraction of a minute, and then it was all\ngone. The first face was the clearest, the last very dim and\nquickly gone. I cannot recall any portraits I have seen lately like\nthese faces, and I am not given to seeing faces in the dark.\nI had hoped for some interesting script this morning, but nothing\nwill come.\nThese three men are of course Mr. Myers, Mr. Gurney,\nand Dr. Sidgwick, and the description of them is almost\nidentical with that given in the reverse order in the script\nof Feb. 21st, 1905 (cpuoted above, p. 246), and followed there\nby the three names \" Henry, Edmund, Fred.\" The description\nis no doubt based on the portraits in Fragments of Prose and\nPoetry (though on each date a mistake is made in describing\nDr. Sidgwick. On Feb. 21st he is said to be \"nearly bald,\"\nand on July 27th to be wearing glasses. Neither of these\nstatements was true at any time). But Mrs. Holland does\nnot seem to recognise them supraliminally.\n\" Leckhampton,\" the name of Mr. Myers's house at Cambridge,\nis also given in Fragments.\nSome other cases of visions unrecognised will be given later.\nIn these cases the script seems to represent a stratum of\nconsciousness with a more retentive memory and in some\nrespects a fuller and more complete knowledge than the\n\flv.J Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 265\nnormal.

But\nwe see here also a restriction or inhibition of the normal con-\nsciousness, in that it is apparently unable for the moment to\nuse its ordinary faculties or to draw the most obvious inferences\nas to the persons represented in its visual impressions.\nThis restriction of the normal consciousness, shown here\nin a rudimentary and evanescent form, may perhaps be\nfavourable to the full development of the subliminal activity.\nIn any case it certainly seems correlated with it.\nThe same restriction may account in part for the difficulty\nthat automatists so often find in interpreting passages in\ntheir own script which are perfectly intelligible to another\nreader. \" My eyes were holden,\" Mrs. Holland said in one\nsuch case ; and Mrs. Verrall has often found the same, though\nher long practice in analysing her script from an outside\npoint of view has to a great extent overcome the difficulty.\nIt seems even possible that the sight of the script shortly after\nit has been produced may tend sometimes to reproduce in the\nwriter the dissociation of consciousness which originally accom-\npanied it, just as the act of carrying out a post-hypnotic\nsuggestion sometimes re-induces hypnosis. Of one passage\nMrs. Holland wrote (July 11th, 1907): \"On reading over\nthe script before sending it this passage conveyed nothing to\nme. I seem curiously dense concerning the script for two\nor three days after writing it.\"\nCHAPTER V.\nFifth Period\u2014Oct. 6th, 1905 to Feb. 18th, 1906.\nUp to this time I had given Mrs. Holland no information as\nto what statements in her script were possibly or apparently\nevidential. From the beginning I had impressed on her the\nfact that much of it was derived from her reading of Human\nPersonality, etc., though, I said, there were certain points that\ncould not be so explained. I purposely abstained from telling\nher which points or which passages interested me ; because\nI wished the writing to be as spontaneous as possible and\n\f2(36 Alice Johnson. PART\nnot to be guided in any way by my comments. In the\ncase of her experiments with Mrs. Verrall, I merely sent her\ncopies of some of Mrs. Verrall's script, asking her to tell\nme if anything in it related to her ; but in regard to her\nown script, I simply told her there were several points in\nher first writing that seemed applicable to my friend's sur-\nroundings,\u2014without indicating which they were,\u2014and that an\ninteresting point had occurred on one of the later days.\nOf course I explained to Mrs. Holland the reasons for my\nreticence, which she perfectly appreciated and readily acquiesced\nin. In fact, after my first explanation, she herself often begged\nme to go on keeping her in the dark, so that she might as\nfar as possible avoid being influenced in the writing by her\nown speculations as to interesting points. She wrote to me\non June 22nd, 1905: \"I very much prefer being 'in the\ndark ' for the present. If you were to tell me week by\nweek that this particular phrase carried a half sense, or that\nthese initials might have a meaning, my mind would inevitably\ntry to follow up clues and the outside character of the writing-\nwould vanish. That part of it is from outside I canuot\nhelp believing.\"\nI saw her for the first time, as I have already said, on\nOctober 6th, 1905, when she was staying in London for a\nshort time and came to the S.P.E. rooms at 20 Hanover\nScprare and we had a talk of about 2h hours on her script.\nThe account I now give is taken from my notes of this\ninterview, written two days later. The first incident is\nanother illustration of what is referred to at the end of the\nlast chapter, namely, the failure of her supraliminal to recog-\nnise something that is well known to the subliminal con-\nsciousness.\nI purposely gave her a chair facing Mr. Myers's portrait,\nbut said nothing about it. I saw that she noticed it almost\nat once ; she sat staring at it with so much fixity that I\nthought it probable she might go into a trance. She did\nnot appear to be listening to what I was saying, so I went\non talking about nothing in particular. Presently she said\nin an agitated manner :\n\" Who is that man ? I'm sure I've\nseen him before. I know him quite well.\" When I explained\nwho it was, she said she thought she must have seen the\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 267\nportrait before, though she believed it was not in Human\nPersonality. I showed her a copy of the same portrait in\nFragments of Prose and Poetry (which she had told me she\nhad once seen) and she recognised this as the source of her\nimpression. I told her that many things in her recent script\nwere obviously derived from this book.\nI enlarged on the importance of finding out how much\nof her script was due to reminiscences of things heard or\nseen casually and perhaps subconsciously, and asked her if\nshe could think of any kind of link between herself and\nMr. Myers, e.g. Lady Mount-Temple, whom she had mentioned\nin a letter to me. She said she had only seen Lady Mount-\nTemple once\u2014towards the end of her life\u2014probably in 1900.\nShe had then left Broadlands (where Mr. Myers knew her)\nand Mrs. Holland was sure she had not spoken at all of\nMr. Myers or of any of his associates in psychical research\nor of anything to do with the subject. She could not think\nof any other mutual acquaintance.\nAfter discussing some other topics in the script, I cross-\nexamined her about the references in her script of Feb. 15 th\n1905, to the opening of Mr. Myers's posthumous envelope,\nas described in the section on that incident (see above, p. 241).\nWe also discussed the mention of Professor Eichet in the\nscript (see above, pp. 252 and 255).\nMrs. Holland told me that she had never, she believed,\nseen a copy of the Proceedings or Journal ; that a little time\nback she had seen an advertisement offering a second-hand\nset of Proceedings for sale and that she had purposely abstained\nfrom buying it or looking for it anywhere in order to remain\nas ignorant as possible of S.P.E. affairs.\nShe asked me if 5 Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge, was really\nMrs. Verrall's address, as stated in her script (of Nov. 7 th\n1903), and if it was given in Human Personality. I told\nher it was correct and was not in Human Personality. She\nwas specially anxious on this point and seemed to remember\nthe writing clearly and to have thought of it on this occasion\nspontaneously. I told her that Mrs. Verrall was the lady\nwith whom she had been experimenting in the early part\nof this year, and she was much interested and seemed to\nrealise clearly who Mrs. Verrall was, whereas she had given\n\f268 Alice Johnson. [part\nno sign of recognition when I spoke of Professor Eichet,\nwho also is mentioned in Human Personality. Probably she\nremembered Mrs. Verrall's name because it was there connected\nwith the subject of crystal-gazing, in which she was specially\ninterested on account of her own experiences (see her letter\nof Nov. 19th, 1903, quoted above, p. 185).\nI then read over to Mrs. Holland her own script of March\n1st, 1905, the first day of her experiments with Mrs. Verrall\n(quoted above, p. 252), and told her what points in it were\ncorrect. I also told her that Mrs. Verrall's house was near\nMr. Myers's and that the text quoted by her on that day\nwas over the gateway of Selwyn College, which was near\nboth houses.\nI noted carefully all the information I gave to Mrs. Holland\non this occasion, in case any of it should re-appear later\nin her script. As a matter of fact one incident which I\ntold her, to which she paid little attention at the time and\nwhich she afterwards quite forgot, did lead to two visions,\nas will be related below (see p. 286). When she first told\nme of these visions, I had no recollection of having mentioned\nthe circumstances to her and should probably never have\nremembered it if I had not found it recorded in my notes.\nThe result of this interview was to confirm the impression\nI had already gained from my correspondence with her,\n\u2014\nthat Mrs. Holland was anxious to give me all and any informa-\ntion that could possibly throw light on her script, regardless\nof what conclusions it might lead to.\nAfter leaving London, Mrs. Holland wrote to me on Oct.\n17th, 1905 :\nIt was exceedingly natural that after my long talk with you\non Oct. 6th, I should dream of automatic writing ; but as I had\nnever before clone so, I noticed the dream particularly. In my\ndream I was \" trying \" for writing with a friend, the last person\nI should mention such experiments to in real life, and after some\ndelay a couplet, which I cannot recall, was written. The lines\nwere, I think, ten-syllabled and the words \"stars\" and \"light\"\nand \" peace \" occurred.\nThen came \"Keswick \"\n\" He asked life of Thee and Thou gavest him a long life, even\nfor ever and ever ;\n\"\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 269\nand the dream ended with my saying :\n\" Of course, that's on the\ngrave.\"\nCan you remember if you told me that this is Mr. Myers's\nepitaph? I feel as if I had got it from you, either consciously or\nunconsciously.\nMr. Myers was buried in the churchyard of St. John's,\nKeswick ; the text mentioned is not on his grave, but on\nthe memorial tablet to him in the church. I did not know\nthis at the time and had not mentioned the subject to Mrs.\nHolland ; but while talking to me she had had in her hands\nfor a few minutes his Fragments of Prose and Poetry, as I\nwas showing her the portraits in it. This text is quoted\nat the end of the Autobiography, and it is mentioned at\nthe beginning that Mr. Myers was born at Keswick, his\nfather being incumbent of St. John's Church, Keswick. That\nhe should be buried at Keswick and that this text should\nbe on his grave might therefore be an inference from state-\nments in the autobiography.\nI had now decided to take the first opportunity of introducing\nMrs. Holland to Mrs. Verrall. On September 27th, 1905, I\nhad seen Mrs. Verrall and told her that I was hoping to meet\nMrs. Holland before long and wished her to meet her some\ntime also. Mrs. Verrall suggested asking her to her house\nat Cambridge during the Christmas holidays. My next talk\nwith Mrs. Verrall on the subject was on Oct. 10th, four days\nafter my interview with Mrs. Holland, described above. I\ngave Mrs. Verrall a general account of this interview and then\ntold her for the first time of the statement in Mrs. Holland's\nscript of Jan. 17th, 1904: \"The sealed envelope is not to be\nopened yet,\" and asked her to look up her own script of that\ntime to see if there was any sort of coincidence with this in\nit. Further enquiry led to the discovery of what is described\nabove (Chapter III.) as the first cross-correspondence between\nMrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall. I now first looked up the\nreference 1 Cor. 16. 13. in Mrs. Holland's script of Jan. 17th,\n1904, and found that it was that of the text given in her script\nof March 1st, 1905, viz. the text inscribed on Selwyn College;\nand it was now that I first heard of Mrs. Verrall's attempt\nto get in her script the text asked for by Mrs. Siclgwick. The\ndiscovery of this \" cross-correspondence \" of course confirmed my\n\f270 Alice Johnson. [part\nview that it was desirable to have more experiments between\nMrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall.\nA Premonition ?\nAfter seeing me on the afternoon of October 10th, Mrs.\nVerrall returned to Cambridge. While in the train on her\nway to Cambridge she wrote some script in which\u2014apparently\na propos of nothing\u2014occurred the words :\n\" Arrange the date.\nNovember 16th not the later day.\" She attached no meaning\nto this. On October 19th, 20th, and 23rd, she was corre-\nsponding with a lady in London, who wished to see her on\npsychical matters. On October 27th, being in London, she\ntried to make an appointment with her dentist for Nov. 7 th\nor 8 th, those being the days on which the lady in London\ncould also see her. The dentist's earliest possible day was\nNovember 16th, and she accordingly arranged an appointment\nthen, though much annoyed at not being able to fit it in\nwith her visit to the lady. 1\nNext day (Oct. 28 th) I received a letter from Mrs.\nHolland, dated Oct. 27th, 1905, in answer to one of mine\nsaying that Mrs. Verrall wished to invite her to Cambridge at\nChristmas time. In this letter, Mrs. Holland expressed her\nregret at not being able to go to Cambridge, and added :\n\" I\nwonder is she [Mrs. Verrall] likely to be in town next month.\nI hope to be there for a week from Nov. 15 th.\"\nI, knowing nothing of Mrs. Verrall's arrangements, sent her\nthis letter and asked her if she could manage to come up to\nLondon during the week mentioned. She replied proposing\nNovember 16th (the day previously fixed with her dentist),\nand so it came about that she and Mrs. Holland first met on\nNov. 16th, not at Christmas time, which corresponds to the\ndirection of the script, \"Arrange the date. November 16th\nnot the later day.\"\nSecond Interview, Nov. 16th, 1905.\nMrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall met for the first time on\nNov. 16th, 1905, in my presence, this being also the first\ntime that any direct communication had passed between them.\n1\nAll these dates were furnished to me later from Mrs. Verrall's diary.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 'Ill\nI wrote an account of the interview the next morning, noting\nwhatever facts mentioned in the conversation were probably\nunknown to Mrs. Holland before, in case references to them\nshould turn up later in her script. These will be mentioned\nbelow where necessary.\nIn discussing some of Mrs. Holland's previous script, the\nfollowing points were mentioned\n:\n(1) That there was a quotation\u2014I did not say what\u2014from\nMr. Myers's poem St. Paul in her script.\n(2) That the writings of her Myers and Gurney controls\nbore no resemblance to the real handwritings of Mr. Myers\nand Mr. Gurney.\n(3) Mrs. Verrall remarked that the rather brusque and\nperemptory tone of Mrs. Holland's Gurney control was very\nmuch like the style of \" Mrs. Forbes's \" \" E.G.,\" and some\nstress was laid on this. In speaking of \" Mrs. Forbes,\" Mrs.\nVerrall used her real name. It is, I think, rather remarkable\nthat this name has never appeared in Mrs. Holland's subsequent\nscript.\n(4) I read to Mrs. Verrall the description of a man in\nthe script of Nov. 7th, 1903, and she gave her opinion as\nto what points in it correctly applied to Dr. Verrall.\n(5) We told Mrs. Holland about the premonition in Mrs.\nVerrall's script that the text asked for by Mrs. Sidgwick was\nto be given on Jan. 17th, 1904, which seemed to have a\nsort of fulfilment in her own script of that date ; that she\ndid not give the right text, but a reference to one that had\na distinct association with Mr. Myers and Mrs. Verrall and\nwas given in full by her on March 1st, 1905.\n(6) I told Mrs. Holland of Mrs. Verrall's \" premonition \" of\ntheir meeting on this date.\n(7) Mrs. Verrall said that the text Mrs. Holland had\ndreamt of (see above) was on Mr. Myers's grave. (This was\nnot quite correct. As stated above, the text is on the\nmemorial tablet in the church, not on the grave.)\n(8) A propos of two Christian names, hitherto unidentified,\nin Mrs. Holland's script, Mrs. Verrall said she thought they\nmust be Mr. and Mrs. \" N.\" Mrs. Holland said she knew\nnothing about Mr. and Mrs. N. This was not literally correct.\nShe knew neither of them personally (which was probably\n\f272 Alice Johnson. [part\nwhat she meant), but Mrs. N., who had died twenty years\nbefore, soon after her marriage\u2014in 1886 \u2014had been well\nknown to a cousin of hers, who had frequently mentioned her\nin her letters of that date to Mrs. Holland in India. A piece\nof script giving some details about Mrs. N.'s will was later\ntraced by Mrs. Holland to a passage in one of these early\nletters. All this information, of course, I owe to her. This\nis one of the most marked instances in her history of the\nre-emergence of a long-forgotten idea and will be related\nbelow (see p. 287). Here I will only draw attention to the\nfact that it was through Mrs. Holland's own care that the\nunevidential character of the incident, which at first sight\nappeared very impressive, was discovered.\nOn this occasion Mrs. Holland gave me further information\nas to her family history and connections.\n\" Spectator \" Eeview of Maxwell's \" Metapsychical\nPhenomena.\"\nIn a letter dated Oct. 27th, 1905, Mrs. Holland told me\nthat she had read a review in the Spectator of Oct. 7th of\nDr. Maxwell's book, Metapsychical Phenomena, prefaced by Pro-\nfessor Eichet and Sir Oliver Lodge. The review, I found, was a\nlong one, going into many details of the phenomena, which it\ncriticised very sevei'ely ; and it is clearly responsible for much\nof the matter of the script produced during this period. The\nscript is by no means a mere reproduction of the review ; it\ntakes rather the attitude of one who has read it and has\nformed an independent view of the facts, showing indeed in one\nor two instances what looks like an independent knowledge\nof them. Great anxiety is shown by both the Myers and\nGurney controls\u2014expressed, as usual, more emphatically by\nthe latter\u2014lest the S.P.R should be carried away by the\nmarvellous reports and lest \" the ruin of all we have been\nworking for so long should ensue.\" The warning is reiterated\nagain and again.\nMy readers may remember that, besides the appearance of\nDr. Maxwell's book, the most salient \" occult \" events of this\nperiod were the Greek script of \" Mme. X.,\" later described\nand discussed at great length in Proceedings, Part LI. (Dec.\n\flv.] Atitomatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 273\n1905), and the famous Algerian \"materialisations.\" In regard\nto these matters, the attitude of the \" controls \" has an\nundoubted resemblance to that of some members of the S.P.K.,\n\u2014myself among others. Whether it really represents in any\nway an actual view taken by Mr. Myers and Mr. G-urney is\nof course an open question. But it has to be remembered\nthat these controls, or at least the Myers control, have in\nthe course of the script produced evidential matter pointing\ntowards personal identity ; and it has frequently been argued\n\u2014I think with a certain show of reason\u2014chat any evidential\nmatter produced by a control tends to support its general\nclaim to genuineness. I offer this case, then, for the considera-\ntion of persons who are accustomed to maintain this argument.\nFor my own part, I cannot admit its validity. I think\nthat each part of the script must be judged primarily on\nthe sole ground of its own evidential character. Mr. Myers\nmay have taken the view here attributed to him, but there is\nno real evidence that he did, and even if there were such\nevidence, no one would be bound to agree with him.\nThe review of Dr. Maxwell's book, which, as I have said,\nis the undoubted source of much of this script, appeared on\nOct. 7th, 1905. Nevertheless it was not until Nov. 19th\nthat the script touched in any way on the topic of phenomena\nanalogous to those treated of in the book.\nAbout this time Mr. Feilding was making arrangements\nto attend some sittings with Eusapia Paladino in Paris, and\non Nov. 19th he came to discuss the matter with me and\nto look at some of my records of the sittings at Cambridge,\nwhich have never been published in full. He was with me\nfrom about 3.30 to 6.30 p.m., but I had also spent most of\nthe morning in looking out the records for him and consequently\nhad had the subject much in my mind for most of the day.\nMrs. Holland's script of Nov. 19th, 1905, was written at\n1 1 a.m. as follows :\n*****\n[M.] It is perhaps unfair to state that is too credulous\nbut his peculiar constitution of mind lends itself to the machina-\ntions of fraud.

But the\n1\nR. L. Stevenson.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 275\nwhole topic of physical phenomena was very much in the air at\nthat time. On October 27th, 1905, at a Private Meeting\nof the S.P.E., Sir Oliver Lodge had described a visit of his\nto Dr. Maxwell at Bordeaux for the purpose of attending\nsittings. At these sittings raps had been obtained, generally\nwith contact, and on one occasion a slight movement of a\ntable without apparent contact. Sometimes small lights were\nseen moving about near the medium. Also the medium\nhimself exhibited luminosity, both on his skin and on his\nclothes, after exposure to light, the effect being like that\nproduced by calcic sulphide. Precautions were taken by the\ninvestigators to prevent the artificial use of calcic sulphide\nby the medium and Sir Oliver Lodge suggested that the\nluminosity might be a natural physiological or pathological\nphenomenon.\nThe phrase in the script \" The luminous paste is an\ninvention of his own \" is perhaps intended to apply to this\nphenomenon. The S.P.B. meeting was a private one and\nconsequently no press reporters were present, and it was\nfirst reported in the Journal for December. Sir Oliver\nLodge, however, had addressed two public meetings on\npsychical research during November, one at Oxford on Nov.\n13th, where he gave a general discussion of its bearing on\nscience and religion, and one at Birmingham on Nov. 17th,\nwhen he referred especially to the Greek script of \" Mine.\nX.,\" each being reported in the papers of the following day.\nAt my third interview with Mrs. Holland, on Nov. 21st,\n1905, when she brought me the script of Nov. 19th and\n20th, I questioned her in detail as to what papers she had\nbeen seeing and whether she had read anything about Sir\nOliver Lodge's addresses in them. She o-ave me full\nparticulars in answer to my questions and assured me she\nhad seen nothing in any papers about any S.P.E. topics\nsince the Spectator review of Maxwell's book. She told me\nshe was greatly interested in Sir Oliver Lodge and would\ncertainly have noticed anything she had seen about him. Of\ncourse I told her nothing about my own views of the recent\nphysical phenomena.\nThe odd attempt to get the name of Eusapia Paladino (who\nis mentioned in the Spectator review) \u2014\" Palladia\u2014Euphronia\n\f276 Alice Johnson.

On\nMonday, Dec. 11th, he was to have read a paper at the\nS.P.R. On Dec. 8th he wrote to me about his engagements,\nsaying \"... a furious cold has seized me and I am good\nfor nothing. The only thing to do is to get out of every-\nthing possible and to go straight home. I earnestly trust\nI shall be well enough to come up again on Monday.\" He\ngoes on to ask what I can arrange for the meeting if he\nis not able to come. He was not, after all, able to come\nand his paper was read instead. This was the beginning of\na serious attack of influenza, as the result of which he was\nordered abroad for the winter. In a letter dated Dec. 19th\nhe told me that it was on the evening of Dec. 7 th that\nhis cold developed,\u2014that is, the date of Mrs. Holland's script.\nAs he had to give up several engagements, his indisposition\nwas mentioned in the papers by the 11th. It was therefore\nunfortunate that the script was not sent to me until Dec. loth.\nIn the letter enclosing it, Mrs. Holland wrote :\n\" I am sorry\nnot to have sent you these writings sooner, but my Mother\nhas been very unwell . . . and one of the servants ill for\ndays, so I have been domestically busy.\"\nIn replying, I told her of the coincidence with Sir Oliver\nLodge's indisposition and asked her in future to send me\neach piece of writing, if possible, immediately after it was\nproduced.\nShe replied on Dec. 19th:\n...

No\nname was mentioned, but the place \" Clapham \" sufficiently\nidentified him. I therefore sent a copy of the script to Mr.\nGrove, on the chance of its havino- some relevance for him.\no\nHe told me on Jan. 21st, 1906, that Mr. Myers had not\nknown him till he was about 23 years old; and that he was\n1\nThis is the Zodiacal sign for the constellation of Cancer.\n\f280 Alice Johnson. [part\nin no such anxiety as the script suggested about his own\nhealth, but had for some time been anxious about his wife in\nthat particular respect.\nOn April 10th, 1906, I saw Mr. Grove and had some talk\nwith him about Mrs. Holland's script. He told me in regard\nto his wife's health, that cancer had been feared, but the\ndoctors were now satisfied that the fear was unfounded. On\nMay 15th, 1906, an operation was performed and the doctors'\nopinion was justified.\nAll this had been kept extremely private and was known\nto very few persons. I knew nothing of it until I had\ncommunicated with Mr. Grove about the script.\nThe script, however, certainly seems to refer to an anxiety\nof Mr. Grove's on his own behalf, not his wife's, though most\nof it would be also appropriate if applied to his anxiety about\nher. But this of course detracts from its evidential value\n;\nso much so that both Mr. and Mrs. Grove, who are certainly\nnot prejudiced against the belief in spiritistic communications,\nrefused to attach importance to it.\nIt may, however, be worth mentioning that very soon after\nmy talk with Mr. Grove, Mrs. Holland met him at a house\nwhere she was staying from April 12th to 19th. She after-\nwards told me (on May 28th, 1906), that on this occasion\nshe had had a strong impression, which she did not mention\nto him, that he was in some special anxiety about a very\nnear relative, perhaps his wife or a daughter. I never told\nher, and I feel sure that she never knew, what the real\nfacts had been until she saw them in the proofs of this\npaper.\nMr. Grove's chief anxiety, as he tells me, had been during\nJanuary, February, and March. He thinks it was in March\nthat they consulted two doctors, who told them that the case\nwas not malignant, but that a small operation would be\nnecessary. At the time he met Mrs. Holland, therefore,\nhis anxiety was no longer acute. For various reasons the\noperation was not performed until May 15th, 1906 ;\nit was\nsomewhat more severe than had been anticipated, but all went\nwell.\nAfter learning that the script of January 9th, 1906, was\nto a certain extent veridical, I was reminded of an earlier\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 281\npassage which was possibly intended to refer to the same subject,\nas follows\n:\n(June 14th, 1905) . . . [G.] She is wakeful and weary\u2014her hair\nhangs loose\u2014dark hair that waves a little \u2014 A blue dressing gown\nand such a pale tired face\u2014 No\n\u2014\nno not what she fears\u2014not\nmalignant.\u2014 Diet not the knife\u2014a vegetable diet almost entirely\n\u2014\nstimulants to be dropped by degrees\n\u2014\n* * * * * *\nMr. Grove tells me in relation to this script that the cause\nof their anxiety \" had been going on after a fashion for some\nyears.\" They were by no means convinced that the case was\nmalignant, \" but (he writes) naturally anything that may\npossibly have that character gives some anxiety.\" The general\ndescription was not inappropriate to Mrs. Grove's condition at\nthat time ; she had for some years been overdone. \" Diet,\nlargely vegetable and without stimulants, was recommended\nand practised at one time,\u2014quite possibly about that time.\"\nMrs. Grove had a dark blue dressing-gown.\nAnniversaries and the \" Scribe \" Incident.\nThe next two scripts to be quoted illustrate again the\npersistence of recollection of the anniversaries of Mr. Myers's\ndeath (Jan. 17th, 1901), and birth (Feb. 6th, 1843). In\nthe first is repeated almost verbatim a sentence from the\nscript of Dec. 1st, 1903: \"It will soon be three years now\nand yet I seem no further from earth, though perhaps no\nnearer, than I was that January day.\"\nThis script also repeats for the last time its warnings against\ntoo great credulity.

This impression has\ncome like an order, chiefly at sleeping and waking, and is vaguely\nassociated in my mind with the date 1837. When I once begin,\nI will try to go steadily on again.\nI enclose a cutting from a stray number of the Tribune, the only\nmention I have seen of Dr. Hodgson's death. I hope it is true\nabout the message having come.\nThe cutting from the Tribune sent to me by Mrs. Holland\nis dated Jan. 22nd, 1906, and headed \"Alleged messages from\nDr. Hodgson.\" It gives one of the numerous reports which were\ncurrent in America shortly after Dr. Hodgson's death as to\nan alleged \" message \" from him to Professor Hyslop having\nbeen communicated through a medium, in this case stated\nto be \" a Detroit citizen.\" The paragraph is in the form of\na telegram from New York, dated Jan. 21st, and states that\nDr. Hodgson \" died at Boston a month ago,\" no details of\nthe death being given. Not long after this, as we shall see,\nhe begins to appear as a \" control \" in the script.\n1\nRomeo and Juliet, Act II. Scene 3.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 283\nThe date 1837 mentioned by Mrs. Holland in connection\nwith Feb. 6th puzzled me. It recurred in the script of\nFeb. 6th, 1907, and I afterwards learnt from Mrs. Holland\nthat she always associated Feb. 6th with Henry Irving and\nthought he was born on Feb. 6th, 1837. (He was really\nborn on Feb. 6th, 1838.) In the script to be next quoted,\nhowever, the association of Jan. 17th with Feb. 6th makes\nit clear that the reference is to Mr. Myers.\n(Thursday, Feb. 6th, 1906. 11.10 p.m.)\n[?] My mouth is bitter with the taste of laudanum \u2014\nA dress suit\u2014who could associate the idea of rest or sleep with\na dress coat\u2014 A strange grotesqueness\n\u2014\nIt was very cold\u2014\n-\n[M.] I purposely let Jan. 17 go by the time for honouring or\nlaying stress on that day is over let it be the birthday not the\ndeathday now\n\u2014\nA great loss for you on your side \u2014-but a gain on the other.\nHe may prove a communicating power soon\u2014 This scribe can be\nimposed upon by a trick message a matter of mere fancy while a\ntest message passes unperceived\u2014 Has not Margaret tried 1\n*****\nAsk her to be in London on the 19th.

The time, therefore, was now nearly up. As a matter\nof fact, after a break of nearly three months, Mrs. Verrall\nresumed automatic writing on Feb. 9th, 1906, when a series of\ncross-correspondences with Mrs. Holland was started (see below,\np. 310).\nOn Feb. 9th, 1906, I read Mrs. Holland's script of Feb. 6th\nto Mr. Piddington and he at once remarked on the peculiar\n\f284 Alice Johnson. [part\nuse of the word \" Scribe \" as equivalent to \" medium,\" which\nI had not particularly noticed. It is to be observed also\nthat the word is repeated, as if to draw our attention to it.\nMr. Piddington told me that when he was staying with Mrs.\nVerrall in January, to discuss with her the Report on her\nscript which she was then preparing for publication, he had\nsuggested to her the use of the word \" scribe \" in the sense\nof the writing personality. She accepted the suggestion and\nthe word was used in her Report in Proceedings (published\nin October, 1906). At this time it was new to all of us;\nthe suggestion was a quite original one of Mr. Piddington's\nand he had not mentioned it to me. Apparently the only\npeople who could have had it in mind were he and Dr. and\nMrs. Verrall.\nMr. Piddington's own statement is\n:\nFeb. 10, 1906.\nYesterday afternoon Miss Johnson read to me the last piece of\nscript received from Mrs. [Holland]. In it the word \" scribe \" is\ntwice used to mean a writer of automatic script. The first time\nthere follows immediately a reference to Mrs. Verrall. The second\ntime \"scribe\" is said to be a better word than \"medium\" to\ndescribe an automatic writer.\nIn the latter part of January I was staying with Mrs. Verrall\nat Cambridge for the purpose of reading through the second part\nof her paper on her own phenomena. I suggested that, instead of\nusing the phrase \"my hand,\" and other phrases of the kind used\nby Mrs. Verrall to differentiate her automatic from her voluntary\nself, the expression \"The Scribe\" should be used to describe \"Mrs.\nVerrall II.\" She accepted my suggestion, which was likewise approved\nby Dr. Verrall, with whom we discussed it. I had not at the time,\nnor have I since, ever seen the word Scribe used in such a sense.\nI record my recollections of this incident before having heard\nwhether Mrs. Verrall remembers it ;\nalthough I have not the least\ndoubt but that she will perfectly recollect it, and I think Dr. Verrall\nwill also. . . .\nJ. G. Piddington.\nI had already sent Mrs. Verrall a copy of the script and\nshe had returned it to me with comments on several points,\nbut not on the word \" Scribe.\" I wrote again to ask if she\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 285\ncould confirm Mr. Piddington's recollection of his talk with\nher on this word, and she replied :\nFeb. 14, 1906.\nMr. Piddington stayed here Jan. 11th to Jan. 15th, and it was\nprobably Jan. 12th or 13th that he suggested the use of the word\nscribe to represent \"the producer of the script\" as distinguished on\nthe one hand from my normal self, on the other from supposed\ncommunicators. The word scribe is thus, you will see, not precisely\nequivalent to medium in the ordinary sense, but it is appropriate\nas used by [Mrs. Holland].\nI read that sentence of hers through several times, as I was sure\nthat something of value was contained in it, but I could not see\nwhat to make of it. The form of the sentence, \"this scribe can\nbe imposed upon by a trick message,\" suggested that an actual\nmessage, not trick, was in process of statement, but I could not\nsee the message. All is explained by the use of the word scribe,\nwhich makes an excellent test word. . . .\nMy husband corroborates the above statements as to the use of\nthe word scribe, and the date of Mr. Piddington's visit is fixed by my\ndiary. I have not mentioned the suggested use of scribe in this\nsense to any one, till yesterday, dictating to my secretary, I came\nacross a place in my paper where its use was possible ; but I rejected\nthe idea in that case.\nMargaret de G. Verrall.\nMrs. Verrall's remark that she was unable to recognise the\nsignificance of the sentence about the \" Scribe,\" although sure\nthat there was something in it, is interesting as another instance\nof the automatist's want of recognition of points, though in this\ncase the want of recognition extends to the performance of\nanother automatist.\nIt must be added that Mr. Piddington some time later came\nacross an obscure and anonymous American book, entitled\nLetters from a Spirit (published by the Abbey Press, New\nYork, May, 1903), a transcript from automatic writing, in the\npreface to which the automatist speaks of himself as \" The\nScribe.\" Ic seems very unlikely that Mrs. Holland should\never have seen this book ; but even if she had, there remains\nthe coincidence that the word \" scribe \" is twice used as\nequivalent to automatist in her script very shortly after Mr.\nPiddington had suggested it to Mrs. Verrall.\n\f286 Alice Johnson. [PAKT\nSubliminal Reminiscences.\nTwo incidents occurring at about this period illustrate in a\nstriking manner the possibility of recrudescence of memories\nthat have completely lapsed from the normal consciousness,\nand show at the same time the practical difficulty of proving\na person's ignorance of almost any event in the past, and the\nconsequent necessity for caution in attributing knowledge of\nany such event to a supernormal cause.\nIn the first case, Mrs. Holland had heard of the incident\nonly a few months before it was represented to her through a\nhallucination ; but she had paid so little attention to the\nrecital that apparently she forgot it immediately afterwards.\nIn the second case she had been deeply interested at the time\nin what she heard ; but the event had entirely faded from\nher memory before she reproduced it\u2014twenty years later\u2014in\nher script.\n(1) An, Apparition.\nIn a letter dated December 19th, 1905, Mrs. Holland\ndescribes an apparition recently seen by her as follows\n:\nOn Wednesday evening [Dec. 13th], at 9.30 (my father was out\nand I had just put my mother to bed), when I came briskly into\na small and very brightly lighted room, I saw the figure of a very\ntall, thin man, dressed in grey, standing with his back to the fire.\nHe had a long face, I think a moustache\u2014certainly no beard\u2014and\nsuggested young middle age ; but at my second step forward he\nwas gone. I had been thinking only of a business letter I was\nabout to answer, and cannot explain the tall grey figure at all. I\nhave seen nothing of the kind since 1901. I have gone into that\nlittle white sitting-room many times since, at all kinds of hours,\noften hoping to see the grey figure again, but I have not been\nfortunate.\nThe description suggested Mr. Gurney to me, but I made\nno comment on it to Mrs. Holland. On March 11th, 1906,\nshe wrote\n:\nDo you remember the tall man in grey I saw here one evening\nin the winter? The other morning I went into a small room next\nmy own, thinking only of putting away an evening dress. The tall\nfigure in grey was lying on the bed in a very Aung-down, slack-\njointed attitude. The face was turned from me, the right arm\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 287\nhanging back across the body, which lay on the left side. I started\nviolently, and my foot seemed to strike a small empty bottle on\nthe floor.\nThe figure was gone in an instant, as before, and though I looked\ncarefully I could find nothing on the floor to even suggest the\nbottle I had kicked.\nI know this house has no story even remotely connected with a\nsuicide or an over-dose of any drug, so I don't understand it at all.\n1 had not been stooping or tiring my eyes in any way.\nOn March 29th, Mrs. Holland wrote to me that the date\nwhen she saw the second apparition was either Feburary 27th\nor 28th.\nMr. Gurney died from an accidental over-dose of chloro-\nform, probably taken for neuralgia or insomnia, on June\n22nd, 1888. I was at first much puzzled to account for the\ndetails of the second apparition, since the manner of his\ndeath is not, of course, mentioned either in Human Personality\nor in the obituary notice of him in Mr. Myers's Fragments\nof Prose and Poetry. Later, however, I found from my notes\nof my first interview with Mrs. Holland on October 6th,\n1905, that I had myself told her the main facts. On May\n2 8th, 1906, I saw her again and reminded her of this. She\nsaid she had entirely forgotten it (as I had) and was doubtful\nif she could remember it even when reminded of it ; and that\nshe took very little interest in Mr. Gurney, being mainly\ninterested in Mr. Myers.\n(2) \"Annette.\"\nThe following is another instance of the re- emergence of\na forgotten piece of knowledge, the source of which might\neasily have escaped detection. In this case I substitute\nfictitious initials or names for the real names of the persons\nconcerned. I referred above to Mrs. Verrall's identification of\ntwo Christian names, \"Annette\" and \"George,\" that had recurred\nseveral times in Mrs. Holland's script (unrecognised by herself),\nas those of Mr. and Mrs. \" N.\" Mrs. 1ST. was married in 1885,\nand died in 1S86, when her child, a boy, was born; the child\ndied soon after.\nIn Mrs. Holland's script of January, 1904, and February\nto August, 1905, are eleven references to \"Annette,\" speaking\n\f288 Alice Johnson. [part\nof \"George,\" her house, and the date (of her death), 1886,\nher child (always, however, referred to . in the script as a\ngirl), her sisters, etc.\nOn March 19th, 1906, Mrs. Holland wrote to me:\nWhile I was \"scribing\" the other day, I jotted down a message\non a separate piece of paper and presently sent it to the lady for\nwhom I thought it came. She finds it significant and now I want\nher to see the various messages in the script I sent from India\npurporting to come from [Annette] .... The message that came\nthe other day was not signed but [Mrs. 0.] has . . . definite\nreasons for connecting it with a friend called [Annette] ....\nI sent Mrs. 0. a copy of extracts from the script about\nAnnette and in reply she gave me the following information\nin a letter dated April 2nd, 1906.\nThe script that Mrs. Holland sent her was :\nTell Mary to rest and let pain and anxieties flow over her and\npass away. She must not brace her nerves to resist\u2014but relax\nand float \u2014 Tell her this comes from the friend who loved cradles\nand cradled things twenty years ago.\nMrs. 0. told me that she had known Mrs. N\". intimately,,\nespecially during her brief married life, and added :\nShe used to talk of the comfort and joy of birds in their nests\nand of protected snug children and all cradled things, and in her\nwill she left me the Chippendale cradle that she bought for her\nbaby son. About nine years ago a message came to me (from what\nsource I do not now recollect) which said: \"Tell her that she has\nthe cradle and I have the child.\" This message came to me a few\nmonths after I had lost my own boy, aged 3\u00a3 years, of scarlet\nfever \u2014in the winter of 1892-3. It might refer to my child or more\nprobably to her own son.\n[Mrs. 0. went on to quote from a letter of Mrs. Holland's to her,\nwritten after she had been told of the significance of the cradle\nmessage :]\n\"I am deeply interested in what you tell me, not only because it\nexplains that particular 'message,' but because I think it may be a\nclue to others that came long ago. The first time I ever stayed at.\n[Mrs. O.'s father's house] was in the autumn of 1895, and I\nwell remember that I could not get to sleep one night and my\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter V. 289\nhand scrawled again and again '\n[Annette]\u2014let [Annette] speak to\nMary' ...\"\n[Mrs. 0. adds :] Mrs. [Holland] has never been in my house in\nLondon, nor have I ever spoken to her myself about [Annette]\nand . . . she was in India during the time of [Annette's] engagement\nand brief married life and death I have always known [Mrs.\nHolland] very slightly, as her cousins, the were intimate\nfriends of our youth, but I have not really had opportunity for\nconversation until we met in my sister's house a few weeks ago.\nAs to the dates referred to, Mrs. Holland states that she\nwas in India without coming home from 1883 to 1890. The\nmessages from \"Annette\" to \"Mary\" came in 1895, \"when\n(she writes) I always destroyed the script.\" She had already\ntold Mrs. 0. that she remembered \" in long ago letters from\nmy cousin [mentioned by Mrs. 0. above] adoring references\nto [Annette N.] \" and I now asked her to try to find out\nwhether this cousin could have told her the details about\nthe cradle. On April 11th, 1906, she wrote to me:\n... I had hoped the \" cradle message \" was a fact unknown to\nme, but it proves to be only the subliminal memory. I have\nfound some of my cousin's letters to me in our girl days, which I\nthought I had left in India; those written in 1886 are rather in\nfragments. I must have lost or destroyed some pages, but an\nundated sheet tells of the sad circumstances of Mrs. [N.'s] death, a\nlater letter tells of her having left a will, and a third gives some\nextracts from it and goes on to say :\n\" She left her baby's cradle\nto Mary [0.], for many reasons, the last of which was '\nbecause I\nlove all cradles and cradled things' \" Strange that the very words\nshould float up in my mind and yet the context be forgotten.

When I was\nlast in London I lunched with my cousin, and admired a turcpioise\npin on her toilet table. \"It belonged to [Annette N.] ; she left it to\nmother, and mother lent it to me lately.\"\nSo the connection is clear, and its coincidence with the other\ncradle message [i.e. the other one mentioned by Mrs. 0.] is only a\npretty chance.

[part\nCHAPTER VI.\nSixth Period\u2014February 21st to April 11th, 1906.\nSecond Series of Experiments with Mrs. Verrall.\nMy next (fourth) interview with Mrs. Holland was not, as\nsuggested by the script of Feb. 6th, on Monday, Feb. 19th,\nbut on Wednesday, Feb. 21st, 1906. Mrs. Verrall was also\npresent and later Mr. Piddington came in. We told Mrs.\nHolland of the \" Scribe incident \" just related ; it was also\nmentioned that Sir Oliver Lodge was still abroad\u2014near Spezia\n\u2014recruiting after his illness in December ; and Mrs. Verrall\ntalked a little about the report on her script which she was\nthen writing.\nOn this occasion both Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall tried\nto write automatically, sitting in the same room at a little\ndistance from one another. There was no coincidence between\nthe two writings.\nAfterwards Mrs. Holland tried crystal-gazing ; but most of\nher visions were obviously suggested by the circumstances\nof the moment, viz.\n:\n(1) a scene in the Lake Country, after talking of Keswick ;\n(2) two faces, a man with dark eyes and grey beard and\na shorter man looking over his shoulder, with florid\ncomplexion and heavy eye-brows ;\n(3) a street in some large Italian town (probably Rome).\nWith Mr. Piddington holding the crystal\n:\n(4) details in a suburban scene. (Mr. Piddington was then,\nas she knew, staying at Surbiton.)\n(5) An old-fashioned round table, with claw legs; two or\nthree books, one open, and old-fashioned maps on it.\n\" Nothing remains but a big map, the States of\nAmerica\u2014not clear\u2014a dull map.\"\nThis last vision was the only apparently veridical one of\nthe series.

Mrs. Verrall and I knew of his\nintended journey ; but Mrs. Holland did not.\nAs to the two faces (No. 2) no remark was made to Mrs.\nHolland, but I supposed at the time that the first was Mr.\nMyers, with whose portrait she was now familiar, and the\nsecond Dr. Hodgson, of whose personal appearance I believe\nshe knew nothing, but who is described similarly, though more\nin detail, in her script of Feb. 28th, 1906, quoted below.\nDuring this visit to London, Mrs. Holland also met Mr.\nFeilding, whose name shortly afterwards begins to appear in\nher script.\nShe returned on February 26th, 1906, to her father's house\nin the country, and on February 28th the second series of her\nexperiments with Mrs. Verrall began ; \u2014both writers as before\nsending their scripts to me, without any communication with\neach other.\nIt will be seen that this series begins with a greatly\nincreased knowledge on Mrs. Holland's part of the personnel\nof the S.P.E.

[part\nI sent Mrs. Verrall extracts from the passages following\nthis, on which she sent me the following notes\n:\nMarch Wth, 1906.\n(1) This sentence suggests a reminiscence of the excessive trouble\nwhich the accents gave me in the X. script [i.e. Mrs. Verrall's\narticle on the Greek script of \"Madame X.\" published in the Pro-\nceedings, Part LI., Dec. 1905, of which I believe Mrs. Holland knew\nnothing].\n(2) and (4) On Wednesday, March 7th, I went to the Botanical\nGardens to see the bulbs, because on Wednesday morning my own\ngarden was full of bees (the first noticed this year) and I knew\nthat bees meant open bulbs. But they had dug up the bulb beds\nand are apparently altering the arrangement. The quince-tree is\nunidentified.\n(3) These words are perfectly intelligible and very interesting.\n[They constitute another cross-correspondence, to which a separate\nsection is devoted below, p. 297.]\n(5) I saw the first butterfly (peacock) on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n(6) All this week I have been writing with the white china\ncontainer taken out of my ink stand\u2014a horrid object, not at all to\nbe admired.\nAs to (7), in a letter written on the following day, Mrs.\nHolland says :\nTowards the end of the script yesterday I was very much worried\nby feeling after a name or names that eluded me. Some foreign\nname beginning with H. I was certain of, though \" Hugo \" did not\ncontent me. \"Berg\" I was satisfied with, only I wanted something\nbefore it ; and the impression of groping after some fact I could\nnot get was so strong that I rather wonder if the enclosed paragraph,\ncopied from to-day's paper, has anything to do with my puzzle\nyesterday. . . .\nThe paragraph was from The Daily Express of March 8th,\n1906, and runs as follows:\nBerlin\u2014Wednesday, March 7th. Dr. Hermann Lorberg, the\neminent Professor of Physics at the University of Bonn, met with\na fatal mountaineering accident to-day. He was exploring Mount\nVenus, near Bonn, when he fell from a great height and was instantly\nkilled.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 297\nIt seems to me clear that the coincidence between this\nevent and the script is purely accidental, partly because it\nis so far from exact, and partly because there are no accessory\ncircumstances suggesting any connection with Dr. Hermann\nLorberg. As an instance of chance coincidence it may, I\nthink, be profitably compared with the coincidences which\nseem to be produced by telepathy.\nThe \" H. M. Minster Berg Hugo \" of the script is, I do not\ndoubt, Dr. Hugo Miinsterberg of Harvard University. Com-\nments on this passage will be found in the section on the\nHodgson control below, p. 306.\nMrs. Verrall's script of March 7th, 1906, is treated of\nunder the cross-correspondence \"Eoden Noel\"\u2014below, see p. 316.\nCross-Correspondence\u2014March 7th, 1906.\n\" Ave Roma Immortalis.\"\nTo explain this, it is necessary again to quote several\npassages from Mrs. Verrall's script, as follows.

She told me that she\nhad recognised at the time in her script of March 2nd\nthe reference to the JEneicl\u2014the vain defence of Troy against\nthe Greeks\u2014but that the second Latin passage had no\nmeaning or association for her. Dr. Verrall, to whom she\nshowed the script on March 2nd, said then that he saw\na connection between the two Latin passages, but did not\ntell her what it was. On March 4th he said, on seeing the\nscript of that day, that the same intention was shown in\nthe words \" Pagan and Pope,\" etc. Mrs. Verrall still did\nnot know what he meant. On March 11th she received\nmy copy of extracts from Mrs. Holland's script of March\n7th and read it to Dr. Verrall. He then said that the\nsentence :\n\" Ave Pioma immortalis. How could I make it\nany clearer without giving her the clue ?\n\" applied appro-\npriately to the same thing.\nLater in the day he told Mrs. Verrall that her script of\nMarch 2nd had reminded him of Raphael's picture of Attila\n1\nCrux significationem habet.

II. (2) the Pope. When I read\nhim the script he said that he saw what it was driving at. I did not.\nMarch 4th seemed to him to add a fresh point and [Mrs. Holland]\non March 7th completes the allusion.\nThe story told me this morning is this. Allusion on March 2nd\nto Raphael's picture of Leo's meeting with Attila, and Attila's\nvision of St. Peter and St. Paul. On March 4th my script carries\nthe allusion to the picture further in \"Pagan,\" \"reformer\" and\n\"Crucifer.\" 1 What of standard-bearer? Possibly on March 5th\n\" Leonis \" and \" claviger \" are further attempts. [Mrs. Holland's]\nallusion :\n\" Ave Roma immortalis. How could I make it any\nclearer without giving her the clue?\" seems to complete A.'s\nthought.\nThe following is a copy of Dr. Verrall's original note on\nthis point, written in Mrs. Verrall's diary.\nMarch llth, 1906. 7 p.m.\nI have read the above. ... It is quite correct in all that\nconcerns me. The reference to JEneid II. and the phrase \" pr.\ninter p.\" with the \" frater etsi non, etc.,\" did in fact instantly\nrecall to me the picture mentioned (doubtless only because I am\nspecially familiar with it) ; and it was to this picture that I\nreferred when I said that I had a guess \" what it was driving\nat,\" or something to that effect. The rest all followed as described.\nA. W. V.\nThe picture is the well-known one in the Stanza d'Eliodoro\nin the Vatican. The Pope sits on a white palfrey, a cross-\nbearer riding on his left and cardinals on his right. Attila\non a black horse is in the middle of the picture, with a\nstandard-bearer in the background on his right and a group\nof mounted Huns beyond. St. Peter and St. Paul are descending\nfrom the sky, both bearing swords, and St. Peter also holding\na large key or keys in his left hand. In the background is\nseen the city of Eome, with the Coliseum and aqueducts.\n\f300 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe picture was of course known to Mrs. Yerrall, but,\nshe writes, had certainly not been recalled to her mind,\nconsciously at least, by her script.\nAnalysing the references here, we find\n:\n(March 2nd, 1906.) The reference to Troy in the first\npart of the script introduces the idea of the defence of a\ncity against an invading host ; Hecuba points out to Priam\nthe inadequacy of his material weapons in the defence of\nTroy. Leo, on the other hand, opposed Attila with moral\nor spiritual weapons of defence, which saved the new Troy\n\u2014\nRome.\n\" First among his peers \" is a phrase often applied to the\nPope.1\n\" With him a brother related in feeling though not in blood.\"\nTaking the Pope in this case to be St. Peter, the brother\nwould be St. Paul ; or the two brothers in feeling might\nbe the Pope and St. Peter.\n(March 4th, 1906.) \"Pagan and Pope,\" appropriate to\nAttila and Leo.\n\" The Stoic persecutor and the Christian\u2014 Gregory not Basil's\nfriend ought to be a clue.\" This is all very dubious. No\nsatisfactory interpretation of the \" Stoic persecutor and the\nChristian \" has been suggested.\n\" Gregory not Basil's friend,\" may mean, not Gregory\nNazianzen. Perhaps the Gregory meant is Gregory the Great,\nthe Pope to whom the phrase \" Primus inter pares \" seems for\nhistorical reasons specially appropriate. There is, however, a\nmistake somewhere,\u2014possibly in the introduction of the Stoic\npersecutor, \u2014for the script says \" you have it not quite right\n\"\nand it goes on in large and emphatic writing, as if with a\nstruggle to correct itself:\n\" Pagan and Pope and Reformer\u2014all enemies as you think \"\n\u2014\nthat is, as I interpret, you might naturally suppose that the\nthree types would all be hostile to one another ; but in this\n1\nIn spite of enquiries made in Cambridge, London, and Rome, through\nMrs. Verrall and other friends of mine, I have been unable to find the\norigin of the familiar phrase \"Primus inter pares.\" It occurs, however, in\nan article on \"The Papacy in its relation to American ideals,\" by the Rev.\nL. H. Schwab, in The Hibbert Journal for January, 1908 (p. 276), as follows :\n\"Any attempted compromise [with the claims of the Papacy] as of a 'primus\ninter pares.'\n\"\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 301\ncase the Pope and Reformer, namely, Leo (or Sc. Peter) and\nSt. Paul, are combined against the Pagan, Attila.\n\" The Cross-bearer who one day is borne \" may have a\ndouble reference,\u2014to the cross-bearer in the picture and to the\nlegend of St. Peter's martyrdom.\n\" The standard-bearer is the link \" may refer to Attila's\nstandard-bearer, who may be called a link in the sense that\nhe furnishes one more thread of connection between the script\nand the picture,\u2014-in particular because he suggests Attila\nhimself, who hitherto has been less specifically described than\nthe other important personages, being merely called the Pagan.\n(March 5th, 1906). The word \" claviger \" may be equally\nwell translated \" club-bearer \" or \" key-bearer.\" In this case\nit would naturally be interpreted as the \" key-bearer \" \u2014St.\nPeter\u2014and the phrase may mean \" The key-bearer in Leo's\nskin \"\u2014that is, St. Peter as represented by Pope Leo. But\nthe phrase \" lion's skin \" seems to suggest the other meaning\nof claviger, viz. the club-bearer or Hercules. This leads on\nto the next sentence, \" There stand the columns where Calpe\n[Gibraltar] has been left,\"\u2014suggesting (says Mrs. Verrall) the\ncolumns of Hercules, which in turn suggest another reference\nto columns :\n\" columns broken by incessant reading \" ; \u2014a quo-\ntation from a well-known line of Juvenal, Satire I. 13, referring\nto readers who recited or declaimed with so much emphasis\nas to break the columns of the hall in which they were\nspeaking.\nIt may perhaps be argued that all this is a fanciful interpre-\ntation and that the script was not referring to Raphael's picture\nat all. The points of resemblance between the description or\ndescriptions and the picture may be thought to be merely\naccidental ; for there are no doubt many features in the picture\nwhich are absent from the description. Indeed the central\nidea of the picture\u2014the miraculous deliverance of the sacred\ncity of Rome from the barbarian\u2014is completely omitted from\nthe description,\u2014unless it is intended to be suggested by con-\ntrast with the case of Troy.\nBut, whether or not the script of March 2nd was really\nreferring to the picture, it did undoubtedly suggest the picture\nto Dr. Verrall, through the conjunction of the two notions of\na weak defender and a Pope, and he was confirmed in this\n\f302 Alice Johnson. [part\ninterpretation by the script of March 4th. After this he\nwas on the look-out for further unmistakable allusions in\nMrs. Verrall's script, and when she read him Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 7 th, he saw at once its appropriateness to the\nincident and the important addition to her own version\nfurnished by the phrase : Ave Roma immortalis (\" Hail\n!\nImmortal Eome !\n\")\nIt is important to note that Mrs. Verrall's script of March\n2nd specifically declares that its statements are unintelligible\nin themselves and will be explained by what will come through\nanother automatist. \" Both these will send a word to you\nthrough another woman. After some days you will easily\nunderstand what I say.\" Again on March 5th her script\nasserts its own incompleteness :\n\" Jam finis. No, you have\nleft out something.\"\nThe explanation was given and the omission supplied on\nMarch 7th by Mrs. Holland's phrase: \" Ave Eoma immortalis,\"\nwhich, as symbolic of the sentiment of the Pope and St. Peter,\ncorresponds to Mrs. Verrall's :\n\" Both these will send a word to\nyou through another woman;\" and, by the mention of Eome,\nclinches the reference to the picture.\nIf it be admitted that the connection between the two\nscripts goes beyond what can reasonably be put down to\nchance, three explanations are possible: (1) though Dr. Verrall\nthought very little consciously about the subject except when\nactually seeing the script, the whole topic was in his mind,\nand a fragment of it may therefore have been transmitted\nthence telepathically to Mrs. Holland. (2) Again, it may have\nbeen transmitted telepathically from his mind to Mrs. Verrall's\nand from her to Mrs. Holland. (3) Mrs. Verrall may have\ninterpreted her script subliminally and conveyed the idea of\nit telepathically to Mrs. Holland.\nBut none of these hypotheses explains the fact that Mrs.\nHolland's script reproduced nothing that had appeared in\nMrs. Verrall's, but supplied instead the missing factor that\nwas required to complete Mrs. Verrall's allusions. And the\nsentence that follows the phrase in Mrs. Holland's script\n:\n\" How could I make it any clearer without giving her the\nclue ?\n\" indicates what I believe to be an important\u2014if not\nessential\u2014feature of the case, \u2014the deliberate intention of the\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 303\ncontrol to prevent Mrs. Verrall from understanding or guessing\nthe meaning of her script ; and by this means to prevent her\nfrom conveying it telepathically to Mrs. Holland. This point\nis discussed further in Chapter VII. on \"The Theory of Cross-\ncorrespondences.\"\nI may add that just as various names and phrases in\nMrs. Verrall's script led on by association to a number of\ntopics connected only very indirectly if at all with the main\nconception (e.g. the Stoic Persecutor, Hercules, etc.) ; so\napparently the mention of Rome led on in Mrs. Holland's\nscript to the idea of Mr. Myers's last illness ; for the next\nsentence is \" How cold it was that winter\u2014even snow in\nEome\u2014we might have stayed at home for that.\" It is true,\nas I find from a letter of that date, that there was snow\nin Eome in January, 1901, but the statement is not, of\ncourse, evidential.\nThe Hodgson Control.\nIn February, 1905, as mentioned above, Mrs. Holland found\nthat the automatic writing was beginning to make her feel\nfaint or sleepy. The condition was obviated at the time\n\u2014\napparently by my suggestion to her. It now began to recur.\nOn Feb. 17th, 1906, she wrote to me:\nThe enclosed writing [that of Feb. 9th quoted below] dates from\nseveral days ago. I was able to try it early in the evening for once,\nand I was anxious to see if the almost stupour which writing has\nbeen causing lately was due to late hours and writing in bed. I\nfound that even when I was not tired (and sat in a stiff chair well\naway from a table, with nothing to support arms or head), a few\nmoments of writing made me feel at once very sleepy and ex-\nceedingly loquacious. I fancy that under favourable conditions my\nautomatic writing would change (for a time at any rate) into trance\nor semi-trance conditions with spoken words instead of written\nones.\nTwice or thrice lately, just before falling asleep at night, I have\nheard fragments of talk which I know are not actual conversation,\nand as I am in my usual excellent health, perfectly free from\nexcitement or brain fag of any kind, I can only ascribe them to a\npossible new attempt at communication.\nIt will be observed that this condition seems to coincide\n\f304 Alice Johnson.

The first letters\nare formed from the name \" Richard Hodgson \" by substituting\nfor each letter of the name the letter following it in the\nalphabet ; the numbers represent the same name by substituting\nfor each letter the number of its place in the alphabet.\nI asked Mrs. Holland if she had ever played at conundrums\nof this kind. She told me that as a child in the nursery she\nhad played at a \" secret language \" made by using either the\nletter before or the letter after the real one. But she had\nnever practised or thought of using numbers in this way. She\nnoted afterwards :\n\" When my hand wrote them I thought they\nwere an addition sum and hoped [my subliminal] would add\nit very correctly and quickly. [My supraliminal] is very poor\nat figures.\"\nAs to the rest of the script\n:\nDr. Hodgson died suddenly of heart-disease while playing a\ngame of handball at the Boat Club in Boston, on December\n20th, 1905. There was no preliminary illness, as suggested\nin the script. At a subsequent interview with Mrs. Holland\n(on May 28th, 1906), I told her a propos of this script that\nI was making enquiries but had not yet learnt if anything in\nit was correct. She then asked me if he had died of heart-\ndisease, as she said she knew nitrate of amyl was given for\nheart failure, and she suggested this as the interpretation of\nthe words \" Nitrate of amyl\u2014probably too late even if it had\nbeen thought of.\"\nBefore making any further comments, it will be convenient\nto quote here all the remaining script of this period (Feb. to\nMay, 1906) which purports to relate to Dr. Hodgson. The\nfirst two passages are quoted with their context elsewhere\n(see pp. 292 and 295).\n(Feb. 28th, 1906.)\nDickon of Norfolk1\n\u2014is that far enough away from the real name 1\nI'll describe R.

On May 25th,\n1906, he wrote as follows:\n[In regard to the script of Feb. 9th, 1906], after the experience\ngained in the last four weeks, during which I have been going\nthrough all R. H.'s papers, I have no hesitation in saying that to\nrepresent R.

H. this morning\n(May 25, 1906) at 8.15 a.m. I thought I had seen on some of R.\nH.'s papers some kind of reference mark like K. 57; but felt no\ncertitude as to this.\n\fLV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 307\nAt 9.25 a.m. I reached E. H.'s old rooms at 15 Charles Street,\nand after a few minutes noticed a pile of note-books marked by\nHenry James, Jr., \"College note-books.\" Among them I noticed a\ndilapidated note-book of different size and colour and make, and\nproceeded to look at it out of mere curiosity. On the front cover\nR. H. had written \"The Eternal Life.\" Inside ate two loose sheets\non which R. H. had made rough notes for an article which he had\napparently intended to write in answer to Prof. Miinsterberg's book,\nThe Eternal Life. It is known that R. H. was much incensed\nby Miinsterberg's book and intended to reply to it. On the back\ncover R. H. had written in pencil the following :\n\" R. H. R.

H.\n[Script of March 7th, 1906.] In view of what has been said above\nabout Prof. Hugo Miinsterberg, the obvious reference to him here is\nquite appropriate. \" Why are they so brutally dense ? H. I always\nhad a quick temper.\" These phrases are very like the \" R. H.\ncontrol \" sayings through Mrs. Piper.\nJ. Gr. PlDDINGTON.\nI sent a copy of these passages in the script later to\nProfessor James's son, Mr. Henry James, Junr., who had been\nappointed one of Dr. Hodgson's executors, and he wrote to me\n:\nJuly 29th, 1906.\nThe lines [\"a printed address on the sheet of paper, etc.\"\u2014script\nof Feb. 9th, 1906] suggest this to me, \u2014that Hodgson is struggling\nto procure the return of letters or papers which he tries to describe.\nMr. Piddington will tell you that the Piper control has abounded\nwith this sort of request. . . .\nI know of no place in Boston frequented by Hodgson where there\nwas a wide prospect from the windows unless possibly the Union\nBoat Club, where he died. Its windows overlook the Back Bay to\nsome hills beyond. . . .\nHe wore a gold watch chain on which I find that there is a gold\ncigar-cutter of the ordinary type\u2014not at all horse-shoe shaped. I\nfound an old seal, the stone of which was broken, and which had\na female figure cut on it. It was not worn at the time of his\ndeath. . . .\n[In regard to the script of May 16th, 1906] the foliage of one of\nour American maples turns a very brilliant red in the autumn, and\nits minute flowers are a most brilliant red in the spring. 1\nThe lines\nmight be a quotation from some American poem, or something of\nHodgson's own. . . .\nI think that the phrases at the end of March 7th are rather like\n1\nThe spring red, which is specially referred to in the script, is probably a far\nless familiar fact to English people than the autumn red, and Mrs. Holland\nbelieves that she had never heard of it.\n\flv ] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 309\nHodgson, as Mr. Piddington says ; but if one can refine on what\nis already so refined, they are more like Mrs. Piper's Hodgson\ncontrol.\nThe description of Dr. Hodgson's personal appearance (given\non Feb. 28th) seems to me characteristic; but as his portrait\nhas been published more than once in illustrated magazines, it\ncannot be evidential. Mrs. Holland believes, however, that she\nhas never seen a portrait of him, and that she had never heard\nof him till she read Human Personality.\nOn March 7th, the various attempts made at the name Hugo\nMunsterberg are comparable with the feeling after the name\nEusapia Paladino referred to above (p. 274); but whereas in that\ncase there is clearly an effort of memory to recall the name,\nin this the partial emergence is possibly a telepathic effort\n;\nfor Mrs. Holland, as she told me later, had never heard of\nProf. Munsterberg, who teaches Psychology in Prof. James's\nDepartment in Harvard University and has written against\npsychical research.\nThere is a certain interest in the resemblance between the\nkinds of remarks made by the Hodgson control through Mrs.\nPiper and through Mrs. Holland. Mrs. Piper was of course\nwell acquainted with Dr. Hodgson in life, and it was there-\nfore natural that in her trance condition some of his\ncharacteristics should come out vividly and indeed in a some-\nwhat accentuated form. But no report of the sittings with her\nsince his death had been published and there was, so far as I\ncan see, no normal channel through which her trance conception\nof him could have filtered through to Mrs. Holland.\nA similar resemblance was found, as mentioned above (p.\n271), between the Gurney controls of Mrs. Forbes and of Mrs.\nHolland. Here again Mr. Gurney in his life time was known\nto Mrs. Forbes but unknown to Mrs. Holland. She knew\nboth Mr. Gurney and Dr. Hodgson by name through Human\nPersonality, but there is nothing in that book to suggest in\neither case the particular characteristics exhibited by these\ncontrols in her script.\nI may add that the Christian name following \"K 57\" in the\nscript of Feb. 9th, 1906, and coming at the end of the extract\nfrom the script of Feb. 28th (p. 306), is that of a lady referred\nto in Dr. Hodgson's report on his sittings with Mrs. Piper in\nu\n\f310 Alice Johnson. [part\nProceedings, Vol. VIII. Of this lady \" Phinuit \" remarked \" The\nsecond part of her first name is sie.\" Dr. Hodgson after-\nwards told him the full name, but this was not published, the\nlady being spoken of in the rest of the report as \" Q.\" It was\nthe full Christian name which was given by Mrs. Holland, who\n\u2014it is to be remembered\u2014had not seen the Proceedings at all.\nOn Peb. 28th the script said \"The young wife died so long\nago that perhaps some people forgot her.\" \" Q.\" died in\n1879, but she was, I believe, never married. The name had\nalso occurred in Mrs. Holland's script on Dec. 1st, 1905\n(i.e. 19 days before Dr. Hodgson's death), at the beginning of a\npassage which has apparently no connection with what comes\nbefore or after it, as follows\n:\nThus the name occurs three times in apparent connection\nwith Dr. Hodgson, for I hazard the conjecture that the Greek\ncross here may represent the symbol of Mrs. Piper's main\ncontrol Eector, and so indicate a connection with Dr. Hodgson.\nIn Mrs. Verrall's report of her script, she states (Proceedings,\nVol. XX. p. 77) that the Greek cross occurs in it as a\nsymbolic signature on nine occasions, and on six out of the\nnine reference is made in the script either to Dr. Hodgson\nor to Mrs. Piper, while on another occasion it is stated to\nbe the sign of Eector.\n1\nOne of the drawings of the Greek\ncross produced by Mrs. Verrall's script on Jan. 31st, 1902\n(op. cit. pp. 78 and 404) is very similar to the above by Mrs.\nHolland.\nTwo Crcss-correspondences.\n(1) \" Not in the Plectra\" and (2) \"Henry was not ?nistctken.\"\nOn Feb. 8th, 1906, I sent Mrs. Verrall a copy of Mrs.\nHolland's script of Feb. 6 th (quoted in the preceding chapter,\n1\nIt was the sign used by the Rector control of Mr. Stainton Moses ; see\nProceedings, Vol. IX. p. 285 and Vol. XI. p. 41.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 311\np. 283) including an attempt \u2014here reproduced\u2014to write some\nGreek words.\nMrs. Verrall did not happen to note at the time, and\n\u2014\nowing to the illegibility of a postmark\u2014it cannot now be\npositively proved, whether or not she received this script\nbefore 10.20 a.m. on Feb. 9 th when she wrote the script to\nbe next quoted. The point being doubtful, we must obviously,\nto be on the safe side, assume that Mrs. Verrall did see\nMrs. Holland's script before producing her own, which contains\na certain Greek line, and in that case it may possibly be\nsurmised that Mrs. Holland's script suggested to Mrs. Verrall\nthat an attempt was on foot to make the former write\nGreek automatically, whereupon Mrs. Verrall's script proceeded,\nas it were, to set her a specific Greek quotation to be\nreproduced.\nIn regard to the second cross-correspondence, it is to be\npremised that Mrs. Verrall knew at this time that the Life of\nDr. Sidgwick, referred to in her script, was about to appear,\nwhereas Mrs. Holland probably did not know this.\nThe following are the passages in Mrs. Verrall's script\nbearing on these points\n:\n(Feb. 9, 1904 [really 1906]. 10.20 a.m.)\n(In Latin and Greek : They grow faint, but (are) not without\nputting together.

It may be taken to apply\nto the Greek line quoted by Mrs. Verrall for the third time\non Feb. 28th, for this line, Mrs. Verrall tells me, is the\nburden of the chorus relating to the expedition to Troy and\nthe sacrifice of Iphigenia (iEschylus, Agamemnon, 124, 125).\nThere is a certain point, Mrs. Verrall thinks, in mentioning\nthe Electra in this connection, because the Electra (of Sophocles\nand Euripides) is equivalent to the second play (Libation\nBearers) of the iEschylean Trilogy, of which the Agamemnon\nis the first ; so that Mrs. Holland's script might be taken\nto mean : the line is in the Trilogy, but not in the second\nplay ( = Electra), which was true.\nIt should be added that Mr. Gilbert Murray's translation of\nEuripides' Electra, published in 1905, was being performed in\nLondon at about this time, though I do not think this can\nbe considered enough to account for the connection between\nthe two scripts.\nReturning now to the prediction in Mrs. Verrall's script of\nFeb. 9th, 1906, quoted above, that she would find \"two clues\n\f314 Alice Johnson.

Balfour and to a basket\nassociated elsewhere with Dr. Sidgwick, as follows\n:\nI wrote in the Alps [the script of July 8th, 1901, was written\nin the Eiffel Alp] about a talk in the College Court on a Sunday\nwith your husband\u2014not for her to recognise but for him\u2014 Then\nother things were mixed in, \u2014the play and the rest. But now ask\nhim to recollect in the Long\u2014we talked about our work His has\nbeen largely carried out, mine not. He must remember. It is so\nplain to me. Now sign initials F M B\nIt seemed uncertain whether this communication purported\nto come from Dr. Sidgwick or from Mr. Balfour. In any case\nDr. Ar\nerrall, to whom it seemed to relate, had no special\nrecollection of such talks as were described.\nIn the Memoir of Dr. Sidgwick (p. 589) is given a letter\nwritten on May 29th, 1900 (two days before the operation\nperformed in the hope of prolonging his life), to his old friend\nSir George Trevelyan, in which the following occurs\n:\nMy thoughts go back to the old days when we walked round\nthe cloisters and talked of Life and the spirit in which it should\nbe lived. You have fulfilled your promise better than I.\n1 \" The Cloisters \" would to anv Trinity mau mean the cloisters of Trinity\nCollege.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 315\nThis passage coincides strikingly with the script in that it\nspeaks of a talk in the (Trinity) cloisters with some one who,\nDr. Sidgwick considered, had been more successful than him-\nself in carrying out his plans for his life-work. But here\nthe talk was with Sir George Trevelyan, whereas the script\nrefers it to Dr. Verrall.\nMrs. Holland's script of Feb. 28th, 1906 (see above, p. 293),\ncontains the phrase :\n\" Henry was not mistaken \" (\" Henry \" in her script always\nmeaning Dr. Sidgwick), which applies well to what was\noccupying Mrs. Verrall's mind on that day.\nOn receiving from me on March 6th a copy of Mrs.\nHolland's script, Mrs. Verrall wrote to me\n:\n\" Henry was not mistaken \" closely corresponds with my own\npreoccupation on [Feb.] 28th connected with a clue in the [Memoir\nof Dr. Sidgwick] to something in my script. Mrs. Sidgwick will\nconfirm. I told her that confirmation from [Mrs. Holland] was\nwanted and this is exactly appropriate.\nOn this point Mrs. Sidgwick sent me the following note\n:\nMarch 6th, 1906.\nMrs. Verrall called on me on Wednesday, Feb. 28th, and told\nme she had procured a copy of my husband's memoir, published\nthe day before, and was eagerly reading it, as her script had said\nthat the book would furnish two clues. She thought that one of\nthese was in the great resemblance between something contained\nin the script of two or three years ago about talking in the cloisters\nof Nevile's Court with a passage in my husband's letter to Sir George\nTrevelyan, quoted on p. 589 of the book, though there were some\ninconsistencies showing a mistake somewhere. (I have given the\nsubstance of our conversation. I am not sure that the word\n\" mistake \" was used.) She told me that it was the day on which\nshe and Mrs. [Holland] sat for automatic writing simultaneously,\nand said it would be very interesting if Mrs. [Holland's] script were\nto show any indication of this matter which was occupying her (Mrs.\nVerrall's) mind so much. The resemblance between the passages\nin the letter and in the script seemed to me very striking.\nMy conversation with Mrs. Verrall took place between 8 and\n9 p.m.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\n\f316 Alice Johnson. [part\nCross-correspondence.\nBoden Nod.\nRecurring once more to the prediction in Mrs. Verrall's script\nof Feb. 9th, 1906: \"In the Life of Sidgwick you will find\ntwo clues to what I have said to you, two only\u2014follow the\nthread \" ; Mrs. Verrall soon found what she took to be the\nsecond clue, namely, an explanation of some phrases in her\nscript of Jan. 17th, 1904 (quoted above, p. 226), unintelligible\nto her at the time, about the \" Wanderer on the Way \" and\n\" Hope's vision which is the true one and leads on the\nPassionate Pilgrim.\" Some other phrases about the same time\nand apparently relating to the same topic were :\n\" my pilgrim\nfoot,\" \" the ways we walked together,\" \" wander at will . . .\nwandering still.\"\nMrs. Verrall now read in the Memoir (see her Report,\np. 298) a letter in which Dr. Sidgwick, speaking of the\nquestion of immortality, says :\n\" There was one line of thought\nI wanted to suggest, in which, from time to time, I find a\nkind of repose,\u2014which, curiously enough, I find is that in\nwhich Browning's poem on the subject (' La Saisiaz '\n) con-\ncludes. It is that on moral grounds hope rather [than]\ncertainty is fit for us in this earthly existence.\" This\nled Mrs. Verrall to read La Saisiaz, which to the best of\nher belief she had never read before. It describes the sudden\ndeath of a friend, after which the poet takes alone the walk\nwhich they had planned to take together, and debating with\nhimself the question of immortality, concludes as described by\nDr. Sidgwick. Some expressions in the poem bear a certain\nresemblance to the phrases just quoted from Mrs. Verrall's script,\nand the whole may not inaptly be described as an account\nof the vision of hope which comes to the wandering pilgrim.\nAs Mrs. Verrall observes, the likenesses between the script\nand the poem may, in spite of her impression to the contrary,\nbe due to a latent knowledge of the poem, or of some account\nof it, in her mind. But it is interesting that the phrases\nshould be associated with Dr. Sidgwick's name ; for this script\npurports to be an attempt to produce a verifiable message\nfrom him in answer to Mrs. Sidgwick's question about the\ntext (see above, p. 220), while afterwards a certain verification\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 317\nor explanation of the phrases was found in a letter of which\nMrs. Verrall certainly had no normal knowledge, written by\nDr. Sidgwick in 1878 to a friend of his with whom she was\nnot acquainted.\nThis friend was Mr. Eoden Noel, and the letter (see Memoir,\np. 338) was about his poems written in memory of his little\nson Eric, and published in 1881 under the title of \"A Little\nChild's Monument.\" Mrs. Verrall had been chiefly interested\nin the part of the letter dealing with La Saisiaz, but it may\nbe surmised that Eoden Noel's connection with it led\u2014whether\nnormally or supernormally\u2014to the verses produced in her\nnext script, which I now quote. Mrs. Verrall did not in any\nway associate this script with Eoden Noel at the time, and\nremains convinced, after my later discussion of it with her,\nthat she had never read any of his poems.\n(March 7, 1906. 11.15 p.m.)\nS let it come. Myriad red buds and in each the promise of a\nflower and fruit to come. But you must wait.\nCan't you see Mrs. [Holland] soon 1 Send her something of yours,\na ring that would help her\nShe wrote earlier to-day in the afternoon alone.

I sent her a copy of Mrs.\nVerrall's script of March 7th, 1906, and she wrote to me\nthat it did not apply to her at all, nor apparently did the\nverses suggest anything to her. But her next script gives\nthe date May 26th, 1894, which I found to be that of\nRoden Noel's death, and definite references to him appear\nshortly afterwards. She told me later that she (like Mrs.\nVerrall) knew little or nothing of him, but thought she had\nseen one or two poems by him in some volume of selections.\nBefore writing the script to be next quoted, Mrs. Holland\nhad, as she told me a few days later, read two reviews (in\nthe Westminster Gazette and Daily Chronicle) of the Memoir\nof Dr. Sidgwick, but had not seen the book itself. She knew\nnothing of Mrs. Verrall having found in it points bearing on\nher script, but knew, of course, that we should be greatly\ninterested in it on other grounds. The normal cause, then,\ninfluencing the script quoted below would be the reviews of\nthe Memoir, known to her normal consciousness ; to which may\npossibly be added a subliminal recollection of the date of Roden\nNoel's death, evoked by a subliminal recognition of the resem-\nblance between Mrs. Verrall's verses and his. His name is\nnot mentioned in either of the two reviews, so that they could\nnot have suggested to her any connection between him and\nDr. Sidgwick. The following is her script\n:\n(March 11th, 1906.)\nYou find all that has arrived thus far too nebulous\u2014and under\nexisting conditions it is not surprising it should be so \u2014 Let us\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 319\nfirst establish a recognised channel of communication that has\nalready taken years and may take years longer\u2014very possibly\n\u2014\nafterwards the quality of the messages may improve and become\nmore definite.\nThis is for A. W. Ask him what the date May -J 6th 1894\nmeant to him\u2014to me\u2014and to F. W. H.\nI do not think they will find it hard to recall but if so\u2014let them\nask Nora.\nWe no more solve the riddle of Death by dying than we solve\nthe problem of Life by being born\u2014 Take my own case \u2014 I was\nalways a seeker\u2014until it seemed at times as if the quest was more\nto me than the prize\u2014 Only the attainments of my search were\ngenerally like rainbow gold alway beyond aud afar\u2014 It is not\nall clear\u2014I seek still\u2014only with a confirmed optimism more perfect\nand beautiful than any we imagined before\u2014 I am not oppressed\nwith the desire that animates some of us to share our knowledge\nor optimism with you all before the time. You kuow who feels\nlike that but I am content that you should wait. The Solution of\nthe Great Problem I could not give you\u2014I am still very far away\nfrom it and the abiding knowledge of the inherent truth and Beauty\ninto which all the inevitable uglinesses of Existence finally resolve\nthemselves will be yours in due time. . . .\nIn sending me this script Mrs. Holland wrote\n:\n[I enclose] some unexpected script, which wrote itself very easily\na few minutes ago. By writing itself I mean there was not the\nfrequent feeling of striving and groping. I wonder if you can fit\na name to it; it is certainly not \" F. M.\" or \" E. G.'\n:\nHow glad\nI should be if the date given was a definite bit of evidence from\nDr. Hodgson; but I know I am meant to be kept in the dark\njust now, so please take this last sentence as not written. . . .\nThis shows that Mrs. Holland did not, at least consciously,\nassociate the date with Mr. Roden Noel. Nor did \" A. W.\"\n(Dr. Verrall), though he knew him slightly. He was also\nknown, though not intimately, to \" F. W. H.\" (Mr. Myers).\nIt was, however, appropriate that we should be told to ask\n\" Nora \" (Mrs. Sidgwick) if we could not find out for ourselves,\nsince he was an intimate friend of Dr. Sidgwick's.\nThe reflections that follow (\" We no more solve the riddle\nof Death by dying,\" etc.), which purport to be inspired by Dr.\nSidgwick, are clearly derived from the review in the Westminster\n\f320 Alice Johnson. [part\nGazette. From this review,\u2014which takes up nearly two columns\nof the paper, and deals with many different topics out of the\nbook,\u2014it is not unnatural that Mrs. Holland's subliminal self\nshould select for paraphrase in her script an extract from a\nletter addressed to Mr. Myers, especially as the review states\nthat the latter described it as the most interesting letter he had\never received from Dr. Sidgwick. The extract is as follows\n:\nMy difficulty is that I cannot give to principles of conduct either\nthe formal certainty that comes from exact science or the practical\ncertainty that comes from a real Consensus of Experts. And I feel\nthat your peculiar phase of the \" Maladie \" is due to the fact that\nyou demand certainty with special peremptoriness\u2014certainty estab-\nlished either emotionally or intellectually. I sometimes feel with\nsomewhat of a profound hope and enthusiasm that the function of\nthe English mind, with its uncompromising matter-of-factness, will\nbe to put the final question to the Universe with a solid, passionate\ndetermination to be answered which must come to something. How-\never, in the meantime we have to live on less than certainty, which\nfor you is peculiarly difficult. (Memoir, p. 259.)\nThat Mr. Myers attached particular value to this letter is\nshown by the fact that it is the one letter quoted in his\npaper, \" In Memory of Henry Sidgwick \" (Proceedings S.P.K.,\nVol. XV. p. 455).\nThe extract just quoted is clearly the basis of this\npassage in the script :\n\" I am not oppressed with the desire\nthat animates some of us to share our knowledge or optimism\nwith you all before the time. You know who feels like\nthat, but I am content that you should wait.\" Yet there\nremains the remarkable coincidence that the sentiment repre-\nsented in Mrs. Holland's script should resemble so closely the\n\" clue \" just found in the Memoir by Mrs. Verrall to her own\nearly script,\n\u2014\" that on moral grounds hope rather than certainty\nis fit for us in this earthly existence,\"\u2014and that this should\nbe associated in Mrs. Holland's script with the date of Eoden\nNoel's death, whereas it was in a letter to Eoden Noel that\nMrs. Verrall had found her \" clue.\"\nMrs. Holland's next script begins as follows\n:\n(March 14th, 1906.) Eighteen fifteen four five fourteen\u2014 Fourteen\nfifteen five twelve \u2014 Not to be taken as they stand. See Rev.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 321\n13\u2014 18\u2014 but only the central 8 words not the whole passage\u2014 It\ndoes not do to be clearer under existino- circumstances\n*****\nH.

The numbers\nin that case, however, were written in figures and arranged in\ntwo columns, looking like addition sums. The fact of their\nbeing written in words in the case of Eoden Noel probably\nprevented her supraliminal self from recognising that the same\nform of conundrum was being used again.\nI have not found any significance in the date \"June 1st\n1881 \" (the query after \" 1881 \" is part of the original script).\nThe next passage which I take to refer to Eoden Noel\noccurs in Mrs. Holland's script of March 21st, 1906 (quoted in\nfull below, see p. 335). It begins in blank verse, as follows:\nA golden haze hung o'er the dying day\nAnd dimmed the rising radiance of the stars\nThe tender mist from where the river winds\nEose in transparent veils of thinnest lawn\nA mist more felt than visioned\n\u2014\n1\nIn the trees\u2014the smaller birds were clamourous while\nthe rooks\n1\nThe line begins at this point in the original, though, according to the metre,\nthe words \"in the trees\" obviously belong to the end of the previous line.\n\f322 Alice Joltnson.

The blank\nverse seems Tennysonian in general intention, and the description\nis suggestive of the Cambridge \" Backs,\" in which rooks are a\nrather prominent feature. The whole may be taken to refer\nto Dr. Sidgwick's early life and friendships at Cambridge,\nPioden Noel being a friend of his when he was an under-\ngraduate ; and the sentence :\n\" Was I a drone ? At least\nthere was honey within my reach, even if I brought none to\nthe hive,\"-\u2014may be taken to mean that Boden Noel was\na man of strong poetic sensibilities, although his own contri-\nbutions to literature met with little recognition.\nThis whole interpretation may no doubt appear fanciful, but\nin support of it I quote from a letter written by Dr. Sidgwick\nimmediately after Mr. Noel's death to his widow :\nI have been thinking ... of the early years of our friendship\nwhen we talked and wrote to each other, in the eagerness of youth,\non all things in heaven and earth. I have always felt that though\nhe was keenly disappointed by the world's inadequate recognition of\nhis genius, he did his work in life none the less resolutely and\nbrought out his great gifts and remained nobly true to his ideal\n(Henri\/ Sidgwick; a Memoir, p. 531).\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 323\nThe idea symbolised in the script,\n\u2014\"at least there was\nhoney within my reach,\"\u2014is again expressed in a letter from\nDr. Sidgwick to Mr. Noel's sister, Lady Victoria Buxton (op.\ncit. p. 531).\nI . . . never came away from a talk with him without feeling\nafresh the variety and richness of his nature and his sensitiveness to\nall things beautiful in nature and all things noble or pathetic in\nhuman life. I never knew any one who seemed more at home in\nthat higher region of thought and feeling,\u2014into which some of us\nrise occasionally with some effort, \u2014where the great realities of human\nlife and destiny are not only intellectually grasped, but felt with full\nintensity.\nIt is to be noted that this last passage is quoted in the\nPreface to The Collected Poems of Eoden Noel, brought out by\nhis sister in 1902,\u2014from which book, as observed below, many\nof the references to him both in Mrs. Holland's and Mrs.\nVerrall's scripts are derivable, though they both believe that\nthey have never seen it.\nI quote next a piece of script by Mrs. Verrall. At the\ntime of writing this, Mrs. Verrall had not seen Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 14th about Eoden Noel, but had seen that of\nMarch 21st. I think it extremely improbable, however, that\nthis latter should have suggested Eoden Noel to her. She\nwrote as follows\n:\n(March 25th, 1906. 11 p.m.) (In Latin: A philosopher nor\nwithout ambition; clearly denoted, although not recognised.) 1\nA cap of liberty not worn. There is a cap a three-cornered cap\nand a tassel more like this\n[Three rough drawings of a cap occur in the middle of the last\nsentence.]\nThis script was not sent to me at the time, as it was not\nwritten on one of the days fixed for experiments between the\ntwo automatists, so that I did not see it until I was preparing\nthis report.\nThe description is of course vague and might apply to a\ngood many persons ;\nyet, as far as it goes, it is certainly\nappropriate to Mr. Noel. When I showed it to Mrs. Sidgwick\n1\nPhilosophus nec sine ambitu\u2014bene designatus etsi non coguitus.\n\f324 Alice Johnson. [part\nand asked her if she did not think it suggestive of him, she\nsaid at once that it seemed to her a very good description of\nhim. One of the deepest interests of his life was philosophy,\nand he was certainly not without literary ambitions, as\nmentioned above. He had a keen and vivid sympathy with\nthe poor and oppressed\u2014whether classes or nationalities\u2014and\nmany of his poems refer to subjects of this kind ;\nsee, e.g.,\nGaribaldi and The Red Flag. The \" cap of liberty \" of the\nscript may be regarded as symbolical of this sentiment in him.\nThe phrase \" clearly denoted, although not recognised,\" seems\nto indicate that the person has previously been designated in\nMrs. Verrall's script, but not yet identified ;\nwhich, as we\nhave seen, was true of Roden Noel.\nThe next reference to Roden Noel by name in Mrs.\nHolland's script occurs on March 28th, 1906, as follows:\nHow loudly that clock strikes [the script was begun at midnight,\nand probably a clock had just struck].\nPercival. Roden Noel\u2014Settle\u2014Seattle Seittle \u2014Cornwall\u2014Where\nthe one long street seemed to lead directly to the blue sea.\nClear eyes under a broad brow\u2014a shock of grey hair that was\nstill thick. Not tall\u2014Do you remember the velvet jacket. Patter-\nson. No the long pipe \u2014not the little short old one\n\u2014\nBoth Roden Noel and Mr. (A. J.) Patterson were, Mrs.\nSidgwick tells me, undergraduate friends of Dr. Sidgwick's, so\nthat there is a certain appropriateness in their being mentioned\ntogether. Mr. Patterson is mentioned as a friend and corre-\nspondent of Dr. Sidgwick's in the Westminster Gazette review\nreferred to above, in which Roden Noel's name does not\noccur.\nThe latter's personal appearance, which is correctly described\nin the script\u2014including the velvet jacket which was char-\nacteristic of him-\u2014is shown in the portrait prefixed to his\nCollected Poems, published in 1902. In the preface to this,\nthe date of his death is mentioned, and the extract quoted\nabove from the letter to his sister from \" his friend, the late\nDr. Henry Sidgwick \" is given. The same book contains poems\nof his about Cornwall.\nIn regard to Mrs. Holland's conscious knowledge of all these\nmatters, I saw her on May 28th, 1906, and went rapidly\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 325\nthrough with her most of the script that she had written up\nto that date. When we came to the script of March 11th,\n1906, she asked me if the date \"May 26th, 1894 \" had any\nsignificance. I told her it was the date of Eoden Noel's death\nand showed her the later references to him. She said she\nhad not interpreted, nor\u2014I understood\u2014attempted to interpret\nthe script of March 14th; that she knew nothing of Eoden\nNoel beyond his name and one or two sonnets which she\nhad read in a book of selections. She felt sure she had never\nseen a portrait of him or heard of his wearing a velvet jacket.\nI did not tell her of the references to him in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript, since I had not then detected them.\nAfter discovering the resemblance between Mrs. Verrall's\nverses of March 7th, 1906, and Eoden Noel's poem, I wrote\nto Mrs. Holland on Feb. 6th, 1908, reminding her that\nthese verses (which I then quoted again) had occurred in\nMrs. Verrall's script early in 1906, and adding: \"I want\nto know if you recognise this\u2014especially the first three\nlines\u2014or if it strikes you as being like any verses you\nknow, and if so what. Please think carefully over this. It\nmay suggest an author to you, if not a poem.\"\nMrs. Holland replied :\nIn answer to your question about the verses in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript early in 1906, \"Tintagel and the sea that moaned in pain,\netc.,\" as soon as I read them, I said \"Eoden Noel, of course!\"\nthough, as my knowledge of his poems is limited to the two . . .\nquoted in the Oxford Book of English Verse, 1\nI could not explain\nwhy the name occurred to me. But on looking up my script for\n1906, I see it is given in figures on March 14th and in words on\nMarch 28th.\nI then sent Mrs. Holland the first proofs of this chapter,\nsaying that these would show why I had asked the question\nand asked further :\n\" Did you say Eoden Noel because you\nremembered that you had had references to him early in\n1906 and from that inferred the right answer to my question?\nOr [do you think that] you subliminally recognised the\nverses, either when you first saw them in 1906, or when\nI quoted them to you just now ?\n\"\n1\nThe poem \"Tintadgel\" is not one of these two.\nX\n\f326 Alice Johnson. [part\nMrs. Holland replied to me on April 16th, 1908:\nI can only conclude that my exclamation :\n\" Roden Noel, of\ncourse\n!\n\" after reading Mrs. Verrall's verses quoted in your letter\nwas due to a telepathic influence exerted by your letter. The verses\nmeant nothing at all to me when you sent them to me before,\nand I have read nothing since that throws any light upon them.\nThe conviction came instantly, as an impression gained from a\nletter often does come with me. I remembered afterwards that\n\" Percival\u2014Roden Noel \" had been written in my script before\nwhat purported to be a description ... I know I have never\nseen a volume of his poems. The one sonnet quoted in Sonnets of\nthis Century and the two short poems in the Oxford Book of English\nVerse are all that I know of his writings\u2014no reference to Cornwall\nin them. I can speak of this with certainty, for I am very fond\nof verse and always remember if I come across a volume by a\nminor poet whom I have seen quoted.\nIt had before been obvious to me, from the numerous\nquotations in Mrs. Holland's script, that she read a good\ndeal of poetry and remembered a good deal of what she read,\nand she has generally been able to tell me at least the\nauthor, if not the source, of the quotations. I had also\nlearnt incidentally through a friend of hers of a small\ninstance showing a remarkably retentive conscious memory\nof poetry on her part. All this goes to confirm her belief\nthat she would have known if she had seen Roden Noel's\npoem.\nTo sum up the various items relating to this topic, it will\nbe seen that in neither of the scripts does a single statement\noccur that is provdbly unknown to the writers. Neither of\nthem recognises what her script is referring to ; to both, when\nI interpret it to them, the facts appear as something not only\nunfamiliar, but completely new, as if heard for the first time.\nAnd it is not unlikely that they were actually heard then for the\nfirst time. But since they are all either stated in or derivable\nfrom printed sources, it is impossible to prove that Mrs. Verrall\nand Mrs. Holland had not once seen these sources, which might\nhave been utilised by their subliminal memory.\nThe productions of neither automatist, then, taken alone, can be\nregarded as clear evidence of communication from an indepen-\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 327\ndent external intelligence, such as the surviving individuality\nof Dr. Sidgwick or of Mr. Noel. The important point in this,\nas in many other cross-correspondences, lies not in either\nscript taken by itself, but in the connection between the\ntwo,\u2014in the fact of the same topic occurring in both, though\nin very different forms, and recognised by neither writer.\nCoincidental Reference to Physical Phenomena.\nMrs. Holland's script of March 14th, 1906, the first part\nof which is quoted above, p. 320, goes on:\nHow M.

W.\") mental attitude in\nregard to it seems to me remarkably appropriate. The next\nsentence no doubt refers to the same matter, \" P.\" being Mr.\nPiddington, with whom Mrs. Verrall had had much discussion\nabout the publication of her Report. The sentence, however,\ndoes not represent his view at all correctly.\nThe second part of the script, the last passage of which is\nsigned by the Gurney control, recurs to the subject of\n\f328 Alice Johnson. [part\n\" physical phenomena \" treated of in the script during the\nlatter part of 1905. I do not know if the device suggested\nfor producing \" spirit touches \" has ever been used by mediums.\nOn March 13th, the day before this script was written, I\nhad received from Mr. Andrew Lang an Algerian paper, Lcs\nJVouvellcs, of March 5th, 1906, containing an attack by Dr.\nEouby (of Algiers) on the Algerian \" materialisations \" reported\nby Professor Eichet. I at once wrote to Dr. Eouby asking\nfor further information, and discussed the subject with Mr.\nFeilding either on March 13th or 14th. I mentioned above\n(p. 273) that Mrs. Holland's script first referred to \"physical\nphenomena \" on the day that I had had a special discussion\nwith Mr. Feilding about Eusapia Paladino. Here again, after\na long interval, she recurs to the subject just when it was\noccupying our minds to an unusual extent.\nEeports of the Algerian sittings had appeared in the Annals\nof Psychical Science for October, 1905, and following numbers,\nand Dr. Eouby's attack was first mentioned in the Annals\nin April, 1906. Mrs. Holland saw these accounts for the\nfirst time in the middle of the latter month.\nExperiments with Mrs. Vekrall on the supposed influence\nof inanimate objects.\nMrs. Holland had received from me a copy of Mrs. Verrall's\nscript of March 7th, containing the sentence:\n\" Send [Mrs. Holland] something of yours, a ring, that would\nhelp her\"; and wrote to me on March 11th, 1906: \"The\nsuggestion about the ring interests me. Would Mrs. Verrall\ncare to try the experiment of exchanging rings for a few\nweeks ? One that she has had a long time would be the\nbest. If so, will you let me know and I will send her one\nof mine direct.\"\nI conveyed this suggestion to Mrs. Verrall, asking her if\nshe would send a ring direct to Mrs. Holland. She did so,\nwith the following message only\n:\nThis ring has never been worn by any one but me and has been\ntaken straight from my finger. I am leaving home to-morrow for\na round of visits ;\nmy letters will be forwarded, but if you would\nlike to send me a ring of yours, which I should much like to try,\nwill you wait till April, when I shall be at home again.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 329\nMrs. Holland received the ring by the first post on the\nmorning of March loth, and immediately after receiving it, had\nan impression which she noted down at once and sent to Mrs.\nVerrall the same day, in a letter in which she said\n:\nMarch 15th, 1906.\n. . . While I was dressing this morning and thinking of you\nand the ring, I had such a vivid impression of a room that I noted\nit down instantly and send you a copy of my notes. As it was\nnot automatic script, I spare you my untidy pencil scribble. The\nlady in brown hardly seemed to be you, but the room had to do\nwith you. . . .\nThe note enclosed was as follows\n:\n(March 15th, 1906. 8.45 a.m.)\nA dining room, narrow for its height, a long room. Dull red\npaper on the wall ; brown wood dado or high wainscot. A great\ndeal of brass about the fireplace. Table laid for a meal, bright\nfire. Something Egyptian in the room, or else ornaments of an\n\" Egyptian pattern.\"\nLady in brown dress reading letter. Is it Mrs. V. 1\nAn elaborate coffee-making machine and a silver urn.\nGreen-handled knives.\nHoneycomb. Indian tree patterned china.\nMrs. Verrall sent me this letter with its enclosure in its\noriginal envelope, showing that Mrs. Holland had addressed it\nto her at Cambridge, from whence it had been forwarded to\nher to the house of \" Mrs. Forbes,\" where she was then\nstaying. I must again remind the reader that this happened\nsome time before the publication of Mrs. Verrall's Eeport on\nher script, in which \" cross-correspondences \" with Mrs. Forbes\nare described. It seems impossible, therefore, that Mrs. Holland\ncould have been led by any normal means to guess where\nMrs. Verrall was going. Even if she had known the address\nit would not have helped her much, for Mrs. Forbes, whose\nconfirmation of the case is given below, told me later, that\nshe did not know Mrs. Holland and, as far as she knew,\nthey had no mutual friends or acquaintances.\nMrs. Verrall wrote to me that she had not replied to Mrs.\nHolland's letter, but that both Mr. and Mrs. Forbes agreed\n\f330 Alice Johnson. [part\nthat the description recalled their dining-room unmistakeably.\nMrs. Verrall's full report to me was as follows\n:\nMarch 17th, 1906.\nNote on '\n' Impression \" received from [Mrs. Holland] on Friday evening,\nMarch 16th, 9 p.m., at above address.\nDining-room : not narrow for height ;\nlarge room rather than\nlong.\nDull red paper.\nBelow two windows is brown wood panelling and there is a door\nopposite, brown to match. The mantelpiece, brown oak, reaches to\nthe bottom of the frieze, i.e. to same height as paper. Beside it\noak book-shelves cover the wall. There is a dark oak sideboard\nand other dark oak furniture, standing against the wall. I had\na strong impression of brown wood and red, and had to go into\nthe room to see whether there was a dado. Great deal of brass about\nfireplace, viz. fender, etc., \"basket grate,\" two huge brass plates and\na large brass pot on mantel shelf.\nTable laid for meal often some time before meal ;\ne.g. on my\narrival at 5.30 p.m. the laid dinner table was conspicuous in the\nfirelight, through the always open door to the hall.\nMost conspicuous and distinctive object in room is a large Cairene\nscreen, of which I am particularly fond. It has the regular Egyptian\npattern work in dark wood.\nOn Thurs., Mar. 15, there were 3 ladies in the house: Mrs.\n[Forbes] never wears colours ; Mrs. W. is a widow ; Miss H. L. in\nbrown tweed, brown shoes and stockings, a conspicuously brown\ndress, which suits her striking colouring.\nCoffee making an elaborate affair, very, but no machine in the\ndining room.\nMuch silver on table, but no urn. On Thurs. morning, large tea\npot, large coffee pot, and silver pot with flowers. 4 silver candle-\nsticks in the evening.\nNo green-handled knives.\nHoneycomb always, and always cut with a knife, not a spoon.\nThree large oriental china jars on cabinet, the centre one with a\nvery conspicuous tree on it.\nNote. On Thurs. 15th, I only reached here at 5.30 p.m., so the\nimpression on [Mrs. Holland] was not by direct telepathy from me.\nI had not seen the brown lady before this visit, and the oriental\nchina was no part of my conscious recollection. The Cairene screen\nwas familiar, though I had not thought of it before coming here.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 331\nThe house was known to Mr. Myers, and to Dr. Hodgson. The\naddress had not been given to [Mrs. Holland].\nI knew that Mrs. Verrall was going to Mrs. Forbes's house\non that day, but I have never seen the house myself, nor\nheard it described. Mrs. Forbes sent me the following con-\nfirmation :\nApril 8th, 1906.\nMrs. Verrall arrived on Thursday, March 15th, at about 5.45 p.m.\nI am not quite sure that she did not catch the earlier train, but I\nthink not. The dining room here is a long room, but not a narrow\nor a low one. The walls are papered with a rather dark crimson\npaper and all the wood work and furniture is dark brown, wood\nstained, no paint. Under the large windows is high wainscotting,\nas high as an ordinary dado, and the effect of the room is red above,\nbrown below. The fireplace is a very large one with an old brass\nfender and a brass arrangement for keeping plates hot. Above is\nan oak shelf with a large brass ewer upon it, and above again,\nagainst the frieze, are two large round brass dishes. The table\nis left laid, with flowers and silver upon it, all day. There is usually\na bright fire in a large brass grate with dogs. The room is so large\nthat it is divided by an Egyptian screen, brought from Egypt by a\nfriend. There is some blue and white Indian china, with trees upon\nit. A friend, dressed in brown, was staying in the house. At\nbreakfast there was honey, in the comb, on the table.\nThe wrong things in this description are :\n\\. The narrowness of the room.\n2. Coffee machine and silver urn.\n3. Greemhandled knives.\nThere was a good deal of silver on the table, but no urn.\nN.B.\u2014We had breakfasted at a little after eight, and no doubt\nspoke of Mrs. Verrall coming that day.\nNo information was given to Mrs. Holland as to the\ncorrectness either of this impression or of her script written\nduring the period of Mrs. Verrall's visit to Mrs. Forbes until\nconsiderably later. It will be seen that a good many veridical\nstatements were made in it during this time, and it may be\nconjectured that the association between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\nForbes created a specially favourable condition for telepathic\ncommunication. But it must not be overlooked that the same\nassociation gives Mrs. Holland's script a double chance of scoring\n\f332 Alice Johnson. [part\nsuccesses, since her statements might be taken to refer either to\nMrs. Verrall or to Mrs. Forbes\u2014possibly also to other visitors\nstaying in the house\u2014and a certain degree of ambiguity is\nthus introduced.\nMrs. Holland's first script written while holding Mrs. Verrall's\nring was as follows\n:\n(March 17th, 1906. 11 p.m.)\n(1) It dates from more than twenty years ago.\n(a) What a deep shade that great tree casts\u2014it would shelter a\nparty of conspirators Once it did\n\u2014\nIn the little wood\u2014the grave is there\u2014All ground is consecrated\nunder God's sky\n\u2014\nHer father loved her dearly but he did not always understand and\nshe was only a child when her mother died\u2014 She was very different\nfrom the others\n\u2014\n(2) The heart has no age\u2014and she was always old for her years\n\u2014\nso why notice any disparity \u2014they never felt it.\n(1) One of the first among the wedding gifts.\nSincerity and singleness of purpose are the keynotes\n\u2014\n(3) It was the illness nearly 11 years ago that mattered most\nA life that leads harmonious days\nA straight bar brooch set with small stones\u2014 The lost one was\nthe shape of a tiny buckle set with seed pearls\u2014that was on the\nriver bank\u2014 We are not met [sic] to keep our trifling possessions\nall our lives long\u2014we should enjoy them for the sake of their tender\nassociations or their own intrinsic beauty for a term of years or\nmonths and then pass on the pleasure of them to a new owner\u2014\nNever regret a lost jewel\u2014it has fulfilled its part in your life \u2014let\nit pass on\n\u2014\n(b) The masculine reasoning is enlivened and alleviated by such\nflashes of purely illogical feminine intuition that it robs her intellect\nof half its terrors and supplies her greatest charm\u2014consistent clever-\nness is so alienating\n(4) \"A young maid, with the bluest eyes.\" 1\n(a) The tree here described was identified later as an old\nyew tree with branches coming down to the ground at Whit-\ntingehame, Mr. A. J. Balfour's Scotch estate. Mrs. Holland had\nmet Mr. Balfour while she was staying in London a few weeks\nbefore this, and there were several references to him in the\n1\nR. Browning, Colombe's Birthday, Act I.\n\fLV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 333\nscript afterwards, but nothing more of an interesting or eviden-\ntial character. The tree in question is close to a little wood,\nwhich contains the grave in which Lady Blanche Balfour and\nher son, Mr. F. M. Balfour, are buried. In a short Life of\nLady Blanche (by Dr. James Bobertson, published in 1897),1\nwhich contains a picture of the grave, showing that it is among\ntrees, the place is described as \" an ancient churchyard,\" but\nthere are now no indications of this. No mention is made in\nthe Life of the old yew tree. Lady Blanche was twelve years\nold when her mother died.\nA few weeks later Mrs. Holland, knowing nothing of the\nverification of these points in her script, met Mr. Balfour again,\nand on this occasion it happened that she was asked to try\nsome experiments in crystal-gazing. When Mr. Balfour held\nthe crystal she saw (as she tells me in a note written the\nsame evening)\nthe figure of a bishop, then a big dark overshadowing tree, but not\nvery clearly. . . . Mr. B. asked if the tree was dark or light. I\nsaid \" The picture has gone vague, but I have a funny impression\nof conspiracy, but how can one connect the Gunpowder Plot with a\ntree T\" Mr. B. [said], \" You are thinking of a real tree, but not\nthe one I was thinking of,\" and it turned out that he was thinking of\na tulip tree in England, while [two of his friends who were looking\non] thought of an old yew tree at Whittingehame, where the plot\nto blow up Darnley is supposed to have been discussed.\nSir Oliver Lodge, who was also present, sends me a note in\nconfirmation of this account. Mrs. Holland believed that she\nhad never heard of this tree before, but Mrs. Sidgwick tells\nme that the tree and the tradition about it are well-known in\nthe neighbourhood and mentioned in guide-books, so that this,\nlike many other incidents in Mrs. Holland's script, may possibly\nbe due to a subliminal recollection.\n(b) It is hardly necessary to say that this description is\nobviously meant to apply to Mrs. Verrall.\nOn the points in the script marked by numbers in brackets,\nMrs. Verrall informed me\n:\n(1) This seems to apply to her ring, lent to Mrs. Holland.\nIt had been sent in its original case, marked with her initials\n1\nThis Life is practically a reprint of two articles in Good Words for April\nand May, 1896.\n\f334 Alice Johnson. [part\n\" M. de Gr.\" The initial of the surname was absent, because\nthe ring had been given to her on her last birthday before\nher marriage\u2014partly as a birthday and partly as a wedding\npresent. It was therefore true that it was \" one of the first\namong the wedding gifts,\" but this might perhaps have been\ninferred from the absence of the last initial,\u2014from which\nagain might follow the approximate date, \" more than twenty\nyears ago.\"\n(4) This may refer to Miss Verrall, who, her mother tells\nme, was remarkable as a child for her blue eyes, so much so\nthat she used to be called the \" blue-eyed maid \" in her family\ncircle.\n(2) and (3) may be taken to refer to Mr. and Mrs. Forbes,\nbetween whom there is fourteen years' difference in age. Mr.\nForbes had a serious illness at the end of 1896 and the\ngreater part of 1897. \"This illness (Mrs. Forbes wrote to\nme) changed our lives completely.\" He had an earlier illness\nnot long after their marriage, from which he made a complete\nrecovery. This perhaps explains the use of the word \" most\n\"\nin the script.\nCross-Correspondence.\nPosilipo.\nThe next day of experiment was March 21st, 1906, when\nMrs. Verrall wrote the following\n:\n(March 21, 1906. 11 p.m.)\n(1) overland route arrival next month. Massiliotes terragenae\nand bright the last gleams of the lingering sun, o'er olives old\nand hoary.\n(2) Posilippo [sic] and a terrace there\u2014blue sea beyond the marble\nbalustrade.\nNo I can see no more here. But say Goodnight.\nYou could meet Mrs. [Holland] in April before Easter I think\n\u2014\nand she conies to you later in the spring.\nOn this script Mrs. Verrall sent me the following notes\n:\nApril 1st, 1906.\n(1) Terrigenae (earth-born) means indigenous inhabitants. Mas-\nsaliotes is the Greek word for natives of Massalia (Marseilles).\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 335\n(2) Posilipo near Naples is the site of Virgil's tomb : it is on a\nhill called from a villa. It is covered with remains of Roman\nvillas and has many \" points of view \" including openings in a long\ntunnel through which the road runs. There are views from an inn\nand a terrace, but I can find no \" marble balustrade.\" This infor-\nmation comes from a guide book and is new to me.\nI know Marseilles, but not Naples etc.\nBoth these topics, (1) and (2), had a certain relevance to\nMrs. Holland.\n(1) I sent a copy of the script (all but the last sentence\nin which she is referred to) to her on March 24th, and\nshe wrote to me on March 29th:\nIs \" Massiliotes \" a shot at Marseilles 1 My father starts from\nthere next month to go to Sicily and Greece and other lovely\nplaces, where he will doubtless see \" olives old and hoary \" and\n\"blue sea.\"\n(2) As shown below, the first sentence of Mrs. Holland's\nscript of March 21st, 1906, written at 10.10 p.m., is:\nThey have all been trying in turn but some of them are not\nserious\u2014 Margaret and Helen are\u2014 M. saw a real place that\nlast time but she has never seen the place itself and did not\ndescribe it very clearly.\nMrs. Verrall had mentioned to Mrs. Holland when they met\non Nov. 16th, 1905, that she had a daughter Helen, and I\nthink some reference was made to experiments with her. Her\ndaughter was not with her during her visit to Mrs. Forbes, but\nshe did a good deal of experimenting with Mrs. Forbes and\none or two ladies who were staying in the house in planchette\nwriting, crystal-gazing, etc. The phrase \" M. saw a real place\nthat last time but she has never seen the place itself\" is true\nif applied to Mrs. Verrall's script about Posilipo just quoted.\nI now quote Mrs. Holland's script for this day produced\nwhile she was wearing Mrs. Verrall's ring\n:\n(Wed. March 21st, 1906. 10.10 p.m.)\n(Before I begin to write I should like to record I have just seen\nsomething in a crystal. The \"crystal\" in this case was a glass\npaper weight.

[part\nAbout the veridical statements in the script, marked with\nnumbers in brackets, Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes gave me the\nfollowing information :\n(1) The cross-correspondence involved in this has just been\ndescribed, see above, pp. 334-5.\n(2) There are two windows in Mrs. Forbes's drawing-room,\none a large bow, the other a small window, both looking south\ninto the garden. There is a stream in the garden which can\nbe seen from one of these windows. It was in this room\nthat Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes did planchette writing-\ntogether.\n(3) Mrs. Forbes writes (April 8th, 1906): \"There is honey-\nsuckle outside the window on the house, and there was a\nPyrus Japonica, but all except a small shoot has died. No\nPassion flower.\"\n(4) \" Frank \" is Mr. Forbes's name, but there seems to be\nno point in the statement that he paid a heavy price, nor is\nthere any association of the name Daisy with him.\n(5) On the day when this script was written, March 21st,\nMrs. Verrall and Miss H. L. (the \" brown lady \" of Mrs.\nHolland's impression, see above, p. 329) were trying experiments\nin crystal-gazing, when Mrs. Verrall asked Mrs. Forbes if she\npossessed an inlaid musket, as one had been described in her\nscript of August 26th, 1903.1\nMrs. Forbes said she had an\ninlaid weapon of another kind -and brought it in from the hall\nto show her. It turned out to be a dagger, nine or ten\ninches long, part of which was much worn.\n(6) Mrs. Verrall suggested that this might refer to a dog\nbelonging to Mrs. Forbes with whom they used to play at\nhiding things in the room for him to find.\n(7) \"F.\" may mean Frank (Mr. Forbes).

The figure under\nCancer may be meant for the aspect of Opposition, or possibly\nVenus again. In the next drawing the triangle and square\nprobably denote two of the aspects, Trine and Quartile, the\ndivided circle being perhaps the beginning of a second attempt\nto draw a horoscope.\nMrs. Forbes tells me that Mr. Forbes used to be much\ninterested in drawing nativities, but she thinks the last one\nhe drew was her own, about thirty years ago, before their\nmarriage. She suggests that the Moon, which is specially\nconspicuous in Mrs. Holland's horoscope, is perhaps meant to\nsymbolise her Christian name, Diana.\nMrs. Holland's script of March 28th, 1906, begins with the\npassage about Eoden Noel, quoted above, p. 324, then\ngoes on\n:\n\" A new dress not a black one this time. A coral charm\n\u2014\nhandshaped.\" Then after some references to Mrs. Sidgwick\nand her family, it ends with a reference to Fawcett (see below,\np. 343).\nMrs. Verrall notes on this (April 10th, 1906):\nSome time ago, I think on Feb. 2nd, I called on my dressmaker\nto arrange for an evening dress, which I intended should be black.\nShe, however, insisted on a colour, and I eventually agreed. About\nMarch 11th I appointed March 31st to be fitted, and on March 31st\nwas fitted for the dress in question.\nIn a letter dated March 29th, 1906, enclosing this script,\nMrs. Holland wrote :\nBefore I fell asleep last night, I saw an absolute procession of faces,\nsmall and clear like crystal visions. ... A clean-shaven elderly\nclergyman face was the best of the number ; a thin, pale youth, like\na plainer, sturdier Keats, the most interesting.\nOn this night Mrs. Verrall was staying at the house of\na clergyman friend (Mr. M. A. Bayfield) answering to\nthis first description, which, however, might apply to many\npersons.\n\f340 Alice Johnson. [PART\nOn the same night, Mrs. Verrall wrote as follows :\n(March 28th, 1906. 11 p.m.)\nShe has quite another gift\u2014Divine Remembrance not Vision\n\u2014\nYou forget what we tell you\u2014 There was something for you to\nwrite but it comes not. It should have been recorded three days\nago. There is a picture of a boy about thirteen or less a slim\nfigure in blue alone with no one else in the picture, a portrait, there\nis a dog with him. It hangs on the right of the wall as you look.\nBrown curls and a round head a full length portrait. Ask about\nthat. The other boy has a pony but he did not ride, this one I\nmean.\nBut I have not made her understand.\nI sent a copy of this to Mrs. Holland, and she wrote to\nme on April 5th, 1906 :\nThe \"picture of a boy\" referred to in the script of March 28th\nis just like the portrait of Uncle Rupert described in The Story of a\nShort Life by Mrs. Ewing. I had been reading this story and\nthinking over it exactly three days before the 28th, because I was\nchoosing some books \u2014delights of my own youth\u2014to give to a friend's\nlittle daughter, and wondered if this one was too unbearably pathetic\nfor a sensitive child.\nMrs. Holland told me later (May 28th, 1906) that she\nthought \" the other boy [who] has a pony \" was the hero of\nanother of Mrs. Ewing's stories, Jaekancqoes, which she had\nbeen reading on the same occasion.\nOn looking at these two books, I found that the picture of\n\" Uncle Rupert \" is described as a painting by Vandyck of a\nyouth of sixteen, a young cavalier, dressed in \" pale-hued satin\n\"\nwith \" falling hair,\" and with his hand resting on the head\nof a dog. Since the boy is spoken of as \" standing for his\nportrait,\" this may be supposed to be full length, and it is\nso represented by the artist who illustrates the book. \" Uncle\nRupert \" is an ancestor of the child hero of the story, who\n\" did not ride,\" as he was crippled by an accident at the age\nof six, and died a few months later. The hero of the other\nstory, Jackanapes, had a pony, which figures prominently in\nthe book.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 341\nCross-Correspondence.\nFawcdt.\nMrs. Holland's script of Feb. 9th, 1906, begins:\nThe insurance should be claimed\u2014 No not in the New York Co.\nthe other \u2014 Fawcett\u2014no\n\u2014\nIt goes on to write a conundrum for the name \" Kichard\nHodgson\" (see section on the Hodgson Control, p. 304) apparently\nquite unconnected with the first sentence.\nWhen Mrs. Verrall met Mrs. Holland in my room on\nFeb. 21st (see p. 290) the whole of this script was dis-\ncussed, and Mrs. \"Verrall then mentioned that the name Fawcett\nhad significance for her. It was at this time that several\nnotorious failures of American Insurance companies were taking\nplace.\nOn Mrs. Verrall's side were the following references to\nFawcett :\nOn January 9th, 1904, her script referred to the name in\nconnection with a message forming part of a cross-correspondence\nwith Mrs. Forbes (for a full account of which see Mrs. Verrall's\nReport, pp. 265-6), but the name did not appear in Mrs. Forbes's\nscript.\nMrs. Verrall had some relatives of this name ; a Mr.\nWilliam Fawcett was first cousin to her mother, and the\n\" Carrie or Caroline \" mentioned in two sittings of Mrs.\nVerrall's with Mrs. Piper, November 25th and 27th, 1889,\nwas identified by Mrs. Verrall as his wife. In the report of\nthese sittings (see Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI. pp. 584-89)\nthe name Fawcett is not mentioned at all, only the Christian\nnames being given.\nOn March 20th, 1906, Mrs. Verrall was trying planchette\nwriting with Mrs. Forbes, and gives me the following account\nof it, written from notes made at the time\n:\nReference was made first to people called Hill [the name of some\nacquaintances of Mrs. Forbes], then :\n\" Would it make you happy to\nhave more evidence. Edward. Edward Hill will make it clear.\"\nThen other statements and after an interval: \"Better be quick, as\nY\n\f342 Alice Johnson. [part\nwe have more to say. Open the last morning's paper and look for\nthe lost word.\"\n(Question: What part of paper 1)\n\" Marriages and deaths. Hill who writes was well known to Hill\nwho died. Will you try to find my lost name in the column.\nEdward was wrong. Over the column is my lost name.\"\nWe decided that the \" last morning's paper \" must mean the\nmorning paper most recently arrived and there heing no other paper\nin the house we fetched [the local paper] of March 20th from the\ndining-room. Neither of us had seen it. The first name in the\nBirths, Marriages, Deaths column was Fawcett. 1\nI then remembered that William Fawcett's two maternal uncles\nwere called Hill and Edmund, and thought these were perhaps\nintended by \"Edward Hill, Edward wrong.\" I told Mrs. Forbes\nthat the name \" Fawcett \" had been connected with me by [Mrs.\nHolland]. (I referred to the occurrence of the name in her script\ndiscussed by Miss Johnson and myself on Feb. 21st, 1906, when I\ntold her the name had a meaning for me.) Planchette then wrote :\n\" Ask [Mrs. Holland] to give my lost name. She must be asked.\nSend what I write to her.\"\nWhen I wrote out the incident [the same evening] I remembered\nthat there had been a previous attempt [in my script of Jan. 9th,\n1904] to connect Fawcett with Mrs. Forbes, which had been unsuc-\ncessful. I had been reminded of that incident on March 19th, but\nhad not mentioned it to Mrs. Forbes.\nIf we suppose an attempt on Jan. 9th, 1904, to convey the name\nFawcett to Mrs. Forbes, it is not inappropriate, since the attempt\nfailed, to describe the name as lost.\nThere seems no possibility that either Mrs. Forbes or I was\nnormally aware that the name Fawcett headed the announcement\ncolumn of the local paper. We ascertained that the announcement\nwas not in the Times nor in the local paper of Monday, March 19th.\nNeither of us knows the Fawcetts in question.\nMrs. Verrall did not, as suggested by Planchette, send\nany information about her script to Mrs. Holland, but sent\nme a brief summary of the above incident on March 22nd,\n1906, so that I might be on the look-out for the name\nFawcett.\n1\nMrs. Verrall sent me part of the paper to show this. The part she\nsent contained the title and date and the greater part of the column\nreferred to.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 343\nOn March 28th, 1906, Mrs. Holland's script ends with\nthis passage\n:\nThis script was written when Mrs. Holland was staying\nwith some friends near Salisbury, and I noticed that the letter\nenclosing it was written on a sheet of paper with a crest\nclosely resembling the drawing after \" Maida,\" and with the\naddress ending in \" Salisbury \" impressed on it. This drawing\nsuggested that the heading of the paper had been strongly\nimpressed on her subliminal consciousness, and it may be\nsurmised that the name \" Salisbury \" had evoked the idea of\nHenry Fawcett, who was so closely associated with the place.\nThat Henry Fawcett is intended is shown clearly by the\nreference to blindness.\n\"Feb. 28th\u2014no, earlier\" seems to mean that he has been\nmentioned before, at some date earlier than Feb. 28th, and\nthis might refer to the \" Fawcett \" mentioned in Mrs. Holland's\nscript of Feb. 9th, 1906, quoted above, p. 341.\nOn March 31st Mrs. Verrall came to see me, and I dis-\ncussed with her some of Mrs. Holland's recent script. We\nthen referred to the script of Feb. 28th (quoted above, p. 291)\nto see if there was any apparent connection with Fawcett in\nit. It contained the following passage\n:\nIt was first started when we were all sitting under the cedars at\nBroadlands. While the sunset flared crimson on that noble window.\nIn Mrs. Holland's script, Broadlands (the house of the late\nLord Mount-Temple) is generally associated with Mr. Myers,\nand has been several times referred to above. It is also the\nfact, however, that Lord Mount-Temple was a friend of Mr.\nFawcett's and associated with him politically, especially in\nhis work for the preservation of commons and open spaces.\nHe also used to fish in the Itchen at Broadlands.1\nHenry F, darkened windows then.\nFeb. 28 th no earlier.\nThese facts are given in the Life of Henry Fawcett, by Leslie Stephen.\n\f344 Alice Johnson, [part\nFurther, Mrs. Verrall wrote to me on April 1st, 1906, that\nher cousin, Mrs. Fawcett, above mentioned, once stayed at\nBroadlands on a special occasion, and she tells me that the\nname Broadlands is in her mind associated mainly, if not\nsolely, with this visit of her cousin's to it.\nMrs. Holland's next reference to Fawcett is on April 4th,\nNo further losses\nThe bench under the cedar\n\u2014\nWe missed the mountains sometimes\nF. a blue jewel\u2014set in a ring \u2014or else in a brooch\u2014 Tell\nMargaret not to lose another earring\u2014the hearthrug-\nHere Fawcett, the blind Postmaster General, is clearly\nindicated by the dark spectacles, the letter and the whip,\n\u2014\nthe whip being perhaps an allusion to the fact that, though\nblind, he hunted.\n\" isTo further losses \" seems a reference to the Insurance Co.\nmentioned on Feb. 9 th.\n\" The bench under the cedars \" seems another reference to\nBroadlands.\n\" F. a blue jewel etc.\" Mrs. Verrall wrote to me on\nApril 10th, 1906: \" F. is the initial of my sister's name\n[Mrs. Verrall's only sister] and she has a blue jewel in a\nbrooch which came to her from a Fawcett.\" This brooch\nbelonged to Mrs. W. Fawcett.\nThus the script seems to contain again allusions to the\ntwo quite distinct Fawcetts, Henry Fawcett and Mrs. Verrall's\nconnections of the same name.\nIn answer to questions on the subject, Mrs. Holland told\nme that neither she nor any of her family had known Mr.\n\flv\\] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 345\nHenry Fawcett. She has connections living in Wiltshire, with\nwhom she often stays, but they did not go to live there till\n1894, whereas he died in 1884.\nExperiments with Mrs. Forbes on the Supposed Influence\nof Inanimate Objects.\nOn March 29th, 1906, Mrs. Forbes happened to be in\nLondon and came to see me, and we discussed the passages\nin Mrs. Holland's script that seemed to have reference to her.\nShe suggested that I should send Mrs. Holland a glove of hers,\non the chance that this might facilitate messages, and left\nwith me for the purpose one of the gloves that she was then\nwearing.\nI sent the glove to Mrs. Holland, saying merely that a\nfriend of mine had asked me to send her a glove with the\nrequest that she would try two or three times to get script\nor crystal visions with it. I did not of course mention any\nname, and there could have been nothing whatever to suggest\nthat the glove came from the lady with whom Mrs. Verrall\nhad just been staying,\u2014especially as I had followed my usual\ncustom of making no comment to Mrs. Holland on the correct-\nness or otherwise of her recent script.\nWith this glove Mrs. Holland tried several experiments on\nMarch 31st and April 1st, and recorded both crystal-visions\nand impressions obtained in connection with it, as well as\nscript, as follows\n:\n(Sat.

I think it would be useless to discuss\nthem, as they might apply to any one who had had sorrow in a\nlife as long as mine.\n[I may add that Mrs. Forbes, as readers of Mrs. VerralPs Report\nwill be aware, lost her only son in the South African War, and\nmost of her automatic writing referred to in Mrs. Verrall's Report\npurports to be inspired by him. It is therefore specially appropriate\n\f348 Alice Johnson. [part\nto speak of the strength of \" the influence that comes down, comes\nback.\" Much evidential matter has been contained in this writing.\n\u2014\nA. J.]\n(10) I do not recognise the triangular jewel or the circular ruin. 1\n(11) The violets are a great feature of this place, wild and\ncultivated.\nFrom April 12th to 19th, 1906, Mrs. Holland was staying\nat the house of some friends of hers, where Sir Oliver Lodge\nhappened also to be staying. This was the first time that\nshe had met him. Sir Oliver Lodge had heard from me of\nher script, and now had some talk with her about it. He\nalso showed her some of the proofs of Mrs. Yerrall's Eeport\non her own script, most of which was then in print, though\nnot published till October, 1906. (It was from Mrs. Holland\nherself that I heard of her having seen these proofs. Sir\nOliver Lodge had forgotten to tell me.)\nFrom this date onwards, therefore, it has to be assumed\nthat everything mentioned in Mrs. Verrall's Eeport may\npossibly be within Mrs. Holland's normal knowledge. A long\nsection of this Eeport (Chapter XL pp. 219-275) is concerned\nwith the cross-correspondences between the scripts of Mrs.\nVerrall and Mrs. Forbes, and although I told Mrs. Holland\nnothing about the owner of the objects I next sent to her\n(see below) it seems not impossible that she may have guessed\nsubliminally that they had belonged to Talbot Forbes, though\nsupraliminally she made another guess.\nI will now give in full the script of this period which seems\nto relate to Mrs. Forbes, explaining later what details in it\nmight have been derived from Mrs. Verrall's Eeport.\nAs just mentioned, the script Mrs. Holland had produced on\nMarch 31st and April 1st in connection with Mrs. Forbes's\nglove had been correct in several particulars, and Mrs. Forbes,\nwishing to continue the experiments, decided to send Mrs.\nHolland (through me) something that had belonged to her son.\nAfter considering for a little time what to select, she sent me\non May 17th, 1906, a glove of his and a Japanese bronze bird\nwhich he had kept on his mantelpiece at school. The glove,\n1\nMrs. Holland tells me that she now (April, 1908) traces the triangular shape,\ncircular ruin, and skull, to an essay on Magic by Mr. W. B. Yeats in a book she\nhad been rt ading just at that time.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 34i>\nas I noted before sending it on, was a grey suede with black\nstripes on the back, marked \" Made in France ;\n\" obviously\na man's glove, which had been worn probably not more than\na few times and had some little spots on it, as gloves do\nthat have been lying by for some time. It had no name or\ninitials on it, and I looked carefully over it to see if any\nother indications were given, but could find none. I sent it\nand the bird to Mrs. Holland on May 18th, 1906, with this\nletter\n:\n... I wonder if you would mind trying another experiment of\nthe kind I asked you to do a little while ago. These two objects\nalso come from a friend of mine who has heard something about\nyour script and would be very glad if you would try what writing\nyou can get with them. I think it might be worth trying two or\nthree times. Would you mind bringing back the bird with you on\nMay 28th [when Mrs. Holland had arranged to come and see me\nin London]. The owner says it is not necessary to return the glove.\nThe expressions used in this letter were chosen to avoid\nsuggesting to Mrs. Holland that the objects came from the\nsame person as the owner of the glove sent before, and as a\nmatter of fact she guessed that they came from Mr. Feilding,\nand had some connection with Mr. Myers, as explained below.\nMeanwhile, a piece of script written by Mrs. Holland on\nMay 15th, 1906,\u2014i.e. two days before Mrs. Forbes sent the\nobjects, but during the time that she was thinking of what\nto select,\u2014contains a description of a man whom Mrs. Verrall,\non being told of it, thought she recognised and whom she\nlater identified as Mr. Forbes. The description is as follows :\n(May 15th. 10.15 p.m.)\nBetter take foreign paper since I come from so far away \u2014 He\nis sitting in the arm chair\u2014the big leather one\u2014that is so comfortable\nand so old \u2014 It was red once but it has faded to a friendly\nfamiliar brown\u2014 His right hand is holding his left ankle\u2014inelegant\nbut characteristic. Very thin but it's a big frame\u2014Grey hair that\nwants cutting\u2014 His eyes have a trick of half shutting when he\ntalks earnestly\u2014 Eye glasses probably mislaid as usual. He never\nerred on the side of foppery in dress he might be neater without\nharm\u2014that shape of collar was always all his own-\u2014 \"What do\nappearances matter save to establish identity.\n\f350 Alice Johnson. [part\nCan you imagine him happy without hooks ?\nConditions have changed indeed.\n[After this comes a passage ahout wireless telegraphy, a topic\noften referred to in the script, followed by :]\n\" All cannot be the first of all\n\"\n1\n[Talbot]\nCary\u2014Carew\n\u2014\nFowey. The Duchey\n*****\nIsis\nFrom the ancient lotus symbol\n\u2014\nThe inevitable lily\n\u2014\nPurity\u2014 Immortality\n\u2014\nDetachment from Earthly Care \u2014\nKarma\u2014no\n\u2014\nOm mani pudmi Ora !\n$\n*****\nMrs. Holland tells me that these last words mean :\n\" Oh\nthou jewel in the lotus, thou !\n\" and that the drawing that\nfollows is a rough attempt to depict the seed-vessel of the lotus,\na frequent ornament in Buddhist carving. \"The 'jewel in the\nlotus ' (she says) symbolises purity as well as heavenly wisdom,\nand is sometimes rendered as the '\nthe heart of the lily.'\n\"\nAs to the description of the man, Mrs. Verrall wrote to\nme on June 1st, 1906 :\n[Mr. Forbes] is a tall man, not stout, with large frame, on which\nhis clothes hang rather loosely. He is grey. He almost closes his\neyes when he speaks. He has a habit of leaning back in his low\nchair, with the left leg crossed over the right, and places his finger\ntips together, and I have certainly seen him hold his left ankle in\nhis right hand. He has a habit of rocking slightly to and fro when\namused.\nI can't remember details of [Mrs. Holland's] description, but, as I\ntold you, the man seemed familiar and I suddenly remembered of\nwhom I was reminded.\nMrs. Forbes, to whom I sent the script later, wrote to me\non July 4th, 1906 :\n1\nChristina Rossetti.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 351\n\"The big arm chair.\" [Mr. Forbes's] chair is one he had made at\nCambridge 40 years ago, and is, he says, the most comfortable chair he\nknows. It is covered with red leather, shabby in places, but not\nactually brown. I do not think the attitude very characteristic, but\nthe thinness and the hair are specially characteristic, and he has a\nhabit of almost shutting one eye when he looks carefully at anything.\nThe \"dress\" and \"collar\" bits are specially good. He has collars\nmade for him\u2014turned down collars, lower than is usual. He has\nmany books and loves them.\nIn answer to further questions, Mrs. Forbes wrote to me again:\nJuly 7th, 1906.\nThe eye-glasses have no meaning for [Mr. Forbes]. He has never\nworn any, but he is very short-sighted and often loses things and\nhas to search his pockets. . . . My son used eye glasses always. . . .\nAs to the later points in the same script, \" Talbot \" is the\nname of Mrs. Forbes's son. (The real name was given in the\nscript, for which I have substituted the pseudonym used in\nMrs. Verrall's Ile])ort.)\n\" Fowey. The Duchey \"\n\u2014no doubt the Duchy of Cornwall,\nFowey being in Cornwall, which is referred to in the earlier\nscript in connection with lioden Noel. There is a poem of his\nentitled Foxvey. This seems entirely unconnected with all the\nrest of the script.\n\" Isis \" (Mrs. Forbes writes) \" might be the association with\nthe Thames, which was strong, unbroken, all Talbot's life.\"\nThe lily, she tells me, is on the shield of his school, and\n\" Blessed are the pure in heart \" is written on the stone over\nhis grave. The lotus flower is stamped on all his Tutor's books\ngiven as prizes, and is also stamped in gold on a picture of\nSir Galahad given to him by his Tutor. This lotus has nothing\nto do with the school arms, which consist of three large lilies,\nsurmounted by a fleur de lys and a leopard.\nThe next script to be cpaoted in this connection is dated\nMay 22nd, 1906. In the letter enclosing it and acknowledging\nthe bird and glove, Mrs. Holland wrote\n:\nMy impression on touching them before I read your note was that\nthe glove had belonged to a man dead some years ago, and that the\nbird had been a paper-weight he had used. I have been waiting for\nthese impressions to fade before I try any script.\n\f352 Alice Johnson. [part\nThe script accordingly was written late at night. The idea\nthat the glove belonged to a dead man might, I think, have\nbeen suggested by its appearance, since, as remarked above, it\nlooked as if it had been lying by for some time. The script\nwas as follows\n:\n(Tuesday. May 22nd, 1906. 11.45 p.m. \u2014with glove and bird.)\nBut it should not have been cleaned\n\u2014\n(a) It is the wiring\u2014the electric lighting in the John St. house\nthat is dangerous\u2014 The terms of the fire insurance too need super-\nvising\u2014 Denbigh.\n(b) An old Roman wall\u2014the pyramid is near\n\u2014\nHere lyeth one whose name was writ in water\n\u2014\nA scroll of crystal blazoning the name of Adonais.\n(1) In my own room\u2014where the deep green colour predominates\n\u2014\nAnd a trifle becomes a relic\n\u2014\nCol. ii 5.\nWhat need to sorrow since our hope is certain\nWhat need to languish though the night seem long\nStars are ablaze beyond Earth's misty curtain\nSorrow and silence shall have end in song\n\u2014\n* * * * *\nThe first sentence, \" But it should not have been cleaned,'*\nno doubt refers to the glove.\n(a) The passage about the electric wiring I took to refer\nto Mr. Feilding, since he has a house in John Street and is\na son of the late Lord Denbigh and brother of the present\nEarl. I therefore sent it to him for his comments. He\nreplied on May 24th, 1906:\nFor some time past I have been deluged with advertisements from\nMessrs. Gillow as to the need of fire insurance policies getting\nsupervised. These have made some impression on my mind, and I\nhave put them aside with the intention of applying to them to\nvalue, as they suggest is necessary. So far so good. But it is possible\nthat everybody else who is a householder has been similarly deluged.\nI have had, I think, no less than four communications, and my\nsusceptible mind was so influenced that had the house not been let,\nI should have succumbed to what is certainly very persuasive and\nwhat appears to be very sensible advice.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 353\nNevertheless, in the interests of science, Mr. Feilding did\nhave the electric wiring at his house tested the next day, and\nsent me the report of the electricians, which was as follows :\nMay 25th, 1906.\n5 John St.\nWe have tested the electric wiring at above and find that there\nare two defective circuits . . . There are leakages on these which\nshould be remedied as soon as convenient. . . . The other circuits\nare very fair. ...

So far as it is possible\nto ascertain the R.W. pipe is now sound, but it is not possible to\nsay how far the rust has penetrated.\nWriting to Mrs. Holland later (Aug. 22nd, 1906) Mr.\nFeilding says :\n\" I had the electric light system in my house\ntested, with the result that a very serious leak, which might\nhave proved dangerous, was discovered. The rectification is\nvery obvious in the electric light bills since.\"\nT saw Mrs. Holland on May 28th, 1906, when she was\nspending a few days in London, and spent an afternoon\ngoing over the whole of her script with her from the beginning.\nSome time before we got to the date May 22nd, 1906, she\nremarked that she had associated the man's glove with Mr.\nFeilding and had imagined that both it and the bird were\nsomehow connected both with him and with Mr. Myers. She\ndid not seem to be at all aware that she had written anything\nabout either of them in connection with the glove. I told\nher that Mr. Feilding had nothing to do with either object,\nbut that they were connected with Mr. Myers indirectly, at\na sort of second or third hand, the owner being associated\nwith the main group of controls {i.e. Mr. Myers and Mr.\nGurney). I was of course aware that since she had seen the\nproofs of Mrs. Verrall's Eeport, this remark might lead her to\nguess that it was Talbot Forbes (see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 220,\nfoot-note). I then told her of the verification of the statement\nin her script about the electric wiring and questioned her\nclosely as to whether she could have heard of Mr. Feilding's\nconnection with John Street and Lord Denbigh. She told\nme all she could remember of the occasion in February\n1906, when she had met him at a dinner party in London\n\f354 Alice Johnson. [part\n(as mentioned above, p. 291). She was confident that she\nhad not heard either the address of his house or the name of\nhis brother. It seems possible, however, that these points\nmay have been casually mentioned on this occasion, overheard\nby her,\u2014consciously or subconsciously,\u2014and afterwards for-\ngotten. No weight therefore can be attached to their appear-\nance in the script, and it may even be supposed that Mrs.\nHolland's guess that the glove was Mr. Feilding's evoked a\nsubliminal recollection of details she had heard about him.\nTwo days later I saw Mr. Feilding and asked what he\ncould remember of his meeting with Mrs. Holland on this\noccasion. His account was substantially the same as hers,\nexcept in one particular. She had told me that he had talked\nto her about Mrs. Forbes's script, of which she had afterwards\nread in the proofs of Mrs. Verrall's Report. I asked if he\nhad called her Mrs. Forbes, or given her real name (which\nI did not mention). She replied that he had called her Mrs.\nForbes, and she supposed that was her real name. Now\nI was practically certain that Mr. Feilding did not know\nat that time that the pseudonym Forbes had been chosen,\nand I thought it very unlikely in any case that he should\nhave mentioned the topic to Mrs. Holland. I asked him if\nhe had done so, and he said he was certain he had not, nor\ndid he then know of the pseudonym. It seemed clear there-\nfore that his recollection was correct, and that Mrs. Holland\nhad first heard of Mrs. Forbes from Mrs. Verrall's proofs. This\nis one of several occasions on which I have found that her\nmemory, like that of other people, is not always quite accurate.\nAs to the question whether she too had seen advertisements\nof insurance agents and valuers such as had been sent to Mr.\nFeildino1\n, Mrs. Holland wrote to me later :\nJune 9fch, 1906.\nAbout the script of May 22nd anent the John Street house, I had\nnot been seeing anything about electric lighting. We are off the\ntrack of such advertisements here, where we burn only innocent oil\nlamps. My only thoughts about fire insurance had been in connection\nwith the San Francisco disaster [i.e. the great earthquake] a month\nbefore. I have, however, a deep distrust of electric wiring and a\nspecial horror of fires since that big one at the Glen in Feb. 1905,\nso there was a deeply worn channel in my mind ready to convey\n\fLV.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 355\nthat message. That accounts perhaps for its unwonted coherence\nand common sense.\n(b) \" An old Roman wall \" etc. This obviously refers to\nthe Protestant cemetery at Rome, with the pyramid of Cestius\njust outside the wall overshadowing the graves of Keats and\nShelley. \" Here lyeth one whose name was writ in water\n\"\nis the end of the inscription on Keats's grave (\" lyeth \" should\nbe \" lies \"), and the next line refers, of course, to Adonais,\nShelley's poem on Keats. There is a memorial tablet to Mr.\nMyers in the same part of the cemetery.1\nOn the next passage in the script, marked (1), Mrs. Forbes\nwrites\n:\n(1) \"In my own room.\" The small room in which I write is\npapered with a deep green colour. In it I have collected all the\nlittle possessions of my son. The bronze bird I sent came from\nthe chimney piece there, where many \"trifles\" lie, all now \"relics.\"\nEvery night I lean out of the window and look at the stars before\nI get into bed, so at 11.45 p.m. my thoughts would probably accord\nwith the lines, \" What need to sorrow \" etc., and the verse, Col. ii. 5.\nThis verse is :\n\" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet\nam I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order\nand the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.\"\nMrs. Holland wrote again with the glove and bird on May\n23rd, 1906. Most of this script seems to have no connection\nat all with Mrs. Forbes, but at the end, with an abrupt and\nmarked change of hand-writing into one closely resembling\nMrs. Holland's normal hand, come the phrases :\nThe Winged Victory.\nLime blossoms wait for June\n\u2014\nThe sleepy bird has waked its way.\nThe mention of \" the sleepy bird \" seems to indicate that\nthis passage refers to its owner. (The bird had its head turned\nround and lying back, as if asleep.) Mrs. Forbes told me\nthat she had given the \" Winged Victory \" of Pompeii to the\nchapel of her son's school, as a memorial of him. This was a\nreproduction of the same Victory as that mentioned in connection\nwith Mrs. Holland's crystal- vision marked (6) on March 31st\n1\nThis is the first of many references to this cemetery in Mrs. Holland's script.\n\f356 Alice Johnson. [part\n{see p. 346). Mrs. Forbes's own statuette is exactly as the\nstatue was found, with one arm missing. For the chapel the\nmissing arm was restored and is stretched out, the hand\nholding a wreath. \" June \" is appropriate in this connection,\nas the yearly festivity of the school is in June, and the \" sleepy\nbird \" was a school possession of Talbot Forbes, so that all the\nphrases quoted show a possible connection with his school.\nThe next script was produced on May 30th, 1906. It\nwas not written with the glove and bird, but Mrs. Forbes (to\nwhom I sent a copy of all the script of this period in case\nshe should see significance in any of it) thought it suggestive\nof some connection with her son, the initial of whose Christian\nname was given in it. Here again, it is only the last part\nof the script, again marked by a difference in the hand-\nwriting, that she thought significant. It is as follows\n:\nOnly the plainest truth will be of any help.\nThe bat's Wing.\nNot now. [T.] ]\n1\nThe real initial of Mrs. Forbes's son, called in this paper \"Talbot,\" is given\n'here.\n2\nR. Browning, Any Wife to Any Husband.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 357\nOn this Mrs. Forbes comments\n:\nJuly 4th, 1906.\n[T.] looks like a boy's initial. The double wine-glass or hour-\nglass suggests to me a favourite trick, \u2014two wine glasses, one of water,\none of wine, the contents of which change places. The pot has also\nan association for me, and the butterfly is a thing [Talbot] would\nchoose as a sign, for we made a collection together and he was very\nmuch interested in Entomology. The butterfly cabinet is in the\nroom spoken of above, and also a sofa on which [Talbot's] dog always\nslept at night. Altogether the [T.] and the illustrations are very\nsuggestive to me.\nMrs. Forbes adds later\n:\nThe wine-glass trick was one that used to interest [Talbot], but\nI was the performer. There is a photograph of a flower in a\nbrass pot, rather like the drawing, which was taken by my son\nwhen we first started photography. It was a success, so he was\nrather pleased with it, and it is something he would know I\nshould remember. Also we had a puppy which he very often\nphotographed at the same time. It was a great favourite and\nhis own possession ; it always slept on a big sofa. He was making\na collection of butterflies and moths and spent much time over it.\nThe pot and the butterfly and the puppy are as distinctive of\nthe holidays at this house as the three lines above are of the\nschool.\nFinally some possible references occur in a passage in some\nscript written on June 25th, 1906, Mrs. Holland being then\non board ship on her way back to India. She had before\ngoing returned to me the bronze bird, but at my request had\nkept the glove, though, as far as I know, she did not use it\nin connection with this or any subsequent script. This script\nwas written in response to a special impulse on a Monday, that\nis, not on the regular day\u2014Wednesday\u2014fixed for simultaneous\nwriting with Mrs. Verrall. The passage I quote is in the\nhand-writing of the Gurney control, except for the two con-\ncluding lines of verse :\nBut the normal reaction was lacking.\n\"Semper fidelis\"\nNot on the ring but in the shield.\nz\n\f358 Alice Johnson. [part\nPoor little dog\u2014she was grieved about it and no wonder. G.\nBeyond the lawn the lilies hold their sway\nUnshadowed by the rose of yesterday.\nAs already stated, some of Mrs. Forbes's script purports to\nbe from Mr. Gurney. She writes of the above (July 4th,\n1906):\n\"Poor little dog.\" [Talbot's] dog died early in the year; it was a\ngrief to us.\n\" Beyond the lawn ...\" I have had the lilies moved and put\ninto a long bed in the rose garden. You approach them by the\ntennis lawn.\nIt will be seen that the grounds for connecting this last\npassage with Mrs. Forbes are but slight, while the connection\nis not certain in some of the previous cases.\nWe have now to consider how many of the statements\napparently connected with Mrs. Forbes, in the part of Mrs.\nHolland's script which was produced after she had seen the\nproofs of Mrs. Verrall's report, might have been derived from\nher recollections\u2014supraliminal or subliminal\u2014of the report.\nThe following topics occur both in the script and in the\nKeport\n:\n(1) Mrs. Holland's script of May 15th gives a description\nof a man, identified as Mr. Forbes by Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\nForbes. The only reference to Mr. Forbes in Mrs. Verrall's\nBeport is on p. 267, as follows: \"A letter from Mr. Forbes\nto her at Cranford will go this month.\"\n(2) Mrs. Holland's script of May 15th gives the real\nChristian name of Mrs. Forbes's son. He is called Talbot\nin Mrs. Verrall's Beport, but I think I recollect that in one\npart of the proof the real name was printed by mistake, and\nof course corrected before publication.\n(3) Mrs. Holland's script of May 16th contains the phrase\n\" Ask Clara Forbes about the wreck.\" There is, as far as I\nknow, no significance in this in connection with Mrs. Forbes,\nbut I regard it as a mis-recollection of her Christian name\nDiana, mentioned in Mrs. Verrall's Beport, p. 222.\n(4) On June 25th Mrs. Holland's script refers to a little\ndog. Mrs. Verrall in her Beport, p. 269, speaks of \"the\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 359\ndog,\" and on p. 271 mentions that Mrs. Forbes was accus-\ntomed to have two dogs constantly with her.\n(5) Mrs. Holland's script of June 25th (a) purports to come\nfrom Mr. Gurney, who is mentioned several times in Mrs.\nVerrall's Eeport as associated with Mrs. Forbes's script, and\n(b) speaks of lilies and roses. Lilies formed the subject\nof two cross-correspondences between Mrs. Verrall and Mrs.\nForbes (Eeport, pp. 234 and 256), and Mrs. Verrall (op. cit.\np. 224, foot-note) says that Mrs. Forbes's garden was full of\nassociations with her son, and that allusions to certain flowers\ngrowing in it had been made in her sittings with Mrs.\nThompson.\nSummary of References to Mrs. Forbes.\nTo sum up the veridical statements apparently relating to\nMrs. Forbes, the following were obtained when Mrs. Holland\nwas in complete ignorance of her :\n(1) March 15th. Description of Mrs. Forbes's dining-room.\n(2) March 2 1 st. Some further details about her house, etc.\n(3) March 31st and April 1st. A few trivial details.\nAfter seeing Mrs. Verrall's proofs, Mrs. Holland obtained\n:\n(4) May loth. Description of Mr. Forbes (whose name\nonly is mentioned by Mrs. Verrall), the real Christian name of\nTalbot Forbes, and references to the lotus and lily, appropriate\nto him.\n(5) May 23rd. Mention of the Winged Victory, appro-\npriate to his school.\n(6) May 30th. The initial \"T.\" with drawings (double\nwine-glass, flower in pot, butterfly, and dog on sofa) appropriate\nto his holidays at home.\n(7) June 25th. Mention of dog, lilies and roses.\nOf these, it seems that only the references on June 25th\nand perhaps the Christian name could have been derived from\nMrs. Verrall's Report, in which nothing is said of Talbot\nForbes's school or of his boyhood.\nDiscussion of the Psychometric Theory.\nWe may now consider whether there is any ground for\nsupposing that what is called \" psychometry \"\u2014that is, an\n\f360 Alice Johnson. [part\nalleged influence emanating from an inanimate object\u2014played\nany part in producing the veridical statements in Mrs. Holland's\nscript discussed in this section. It has been shown that\n:\n(1) On receiving Mrs. Verrall's ring Mrs. Holland had a\nremarkably correct impression (on March loth, 1906,) of a\nroom in Mrs. Forbes's house to which Mrs. Verrall was going\nthat day.\n(2) On trying again with the ring, Mrs. Holland obtained\nstatements, some of which were appropriate to Mrs. Verrall,\nsome to Mr. Balfour and his family, and some to Mrs.\nForbes (on March 1 7th) ; some correct statements about\nwhat Mrs. Verrall was then doing at Mrs. Forbes's house,\nand about the house ; also a passage which T have classified\nunder the \" Eoden Noel\" cross-correspondence (on March 21st);\na trivial statement about Mrs. Verrall's dress, and references\nto Eoden Noel and Fawcett (on March 28th). None of this\nhas any connection with the past history of Mrs. Verrall's ring.\n(3) With Mrs. Forbes's glove, Mrs. Holland obtained (on\nMarch 31st and April 1st) some correct statements about\nMrs. Forbes.\n(4) While Mrs. Forbes was thinking about sending some\nobjects that had belonged to her son, but two days before\nshe actually sent them, Mrs. Holland's script (on May 15th)\ngave a description of a man, identified as Mr. Forbes by both\nMrs. Verrall and Mrs. Forbes, and later in the same script\nthe name of her son appeared, and some statements appro-\npriate to him.\n(5) On receiving the objects sent by Mrs. Forbes through\nme, Mrs. Holland guessed that they belonged to Mr. Feilding\nand had also some connection with Mr. Myers, and (on May\n22nd) her script stated correctly that the electric wiring in\nMr. Feilding's house was in a dangerous condition, referred to\nthe cemetery at Eome which contains a memorial tablet to\nMr. Myers, and then went on to some statements appropriate\nto Mrs. Forbes. On May 23rd with Talbot Forbes's glove\nand bird comes the reference to the Winged Victory; but\nthe statue of the Winged Victory had been given to his\nschool after his death, and so had nothing to do with these\nobjects. On May 30th, without the objects, several appro-\npriate points are mentioned and associated with his initial\n;\n\fLV\\] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 361\nand later (on June 25th) there is a passage perhaps intended\nto relate to him.\nThus it appears that some of the most appropriate or correct\nstatements in this series were not obtained in connection with\nany of the objects, but (in one case) before they came into\nMrs. Holland's hands ; and that the veridical statements in\nher script had little or nothing to do with the past history\nof the objects, but were concerned rather with the past or\npresent doings or surroundings of their owners (Mrs. Verrall\nand Mrs. Forbes), or of other persons unconnected with\nthem. Further, that Mrs. Holland's script was clearly led\ninto certain tracks,\u2014in the case of Mrs. Verrall by her\nknowledge of the owner, and in the case of Mr. Feilding and\nMr. Myers by her guess at him.\nThe whole series is of just the same character as the\nwritings produced without any such objects and, in so far as\nthe statements are veridical and evidential, they point\nfar more to telepathy from Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Forbes, or\nMr. Feilding than to any influence emanating from the\nobjects.\nIt may be noted also that, as in all \" psychometric \" experi-\nments, it is impossible for the sensitive to avoid drawing some\ninference\u2014conscious or subconscious\u2014from the appearance or\nnature of the objects. Thus Mrs. Holland cannot help observ-\ning that Mrs. Verrall's ring comes in a case marked with the\ninitials of her Christian names only ; she cannot help seeing\nthat the man's glove has been lying by for some time.\n\" Psychometric \" experiments, in fact, are in some respects\nanalogous to experiments in thought-transference when there is\ncontact between the experimenters, or when they are in sight\nor hearing of each other and therefore unable altogether to\navoid giving or receiving some indications as to what is to\nbe transferred. In the case of psychometry also, the sight or\nfeeling of the object may sometimes mislead the sensitive, and\nwill tend probably in all cases to bring the supraliminal\nconsciousness into play, and so interfere to some extent with\nthe action of the subliminal.\nTo return to the experiments with Mrs. Verrall : Mrs.\nHolland's next script was on April 4th, 1906, as follows:\n\f362 Alice Johnson. [part\n(Wednesday. April 4th, 1906. 10.30 p.m.)\nI think it is really time that something definite should be arrived\nat\u2014 Boston has been curiously dilatory in the matter\n\u2014\nHas there never been a case of a dead man speaking through a\ntelephone 1 If not there soon will be\n\u2014\n\" And I shall smile though underground \"\n\u2014\n1\nBefore the largest chestnut tree in Trinity blossoms\n\u2014\nShe will understand at Easter\n\u2014\nThe scribe [sic] own thoughts are very obtrusive to-night\u2014 How\nare we to influence so stiff a hand\nDrop preconceived notions.\n*****\nMost of the latter part of this script, omitted here, is quoted\nin the section on \" Fawcett,\" see p. 344. The first part seems\nto express a general desire on the part of the control, either\nto produce evidence, or to have the evidence already produced\nproperly understood. \" Boston \" probably means Dr. Hodgson.\nThe chestnut trees in Trinity are a conspicuous feature of the\nmeadow at the back of the College in the spring and autumn.\n\" She will understand at Easter \" 1 took at the time to\nrefer to my pre-occupation with the \" cross-correspondences\n\"\nwhich I was then studying in the proofs of Mrs. Verrall's\nBeport, of which Mrs. Holland knew nothing at this time. I\nhad been discussing these with Mr. Piddington and was\nconvinced that there was some special significance in them\nthat we had not yet understood. The theory propounded in\nthe next Chapter on Cross-correspondences was simmering\nin my mind, but first came to me clearly on the afternoon of\nApril 12th, 1906, the Thursday before Easter. On coming\nback to London after Easter, I mentioned it to Mr. Piddington,\nand he accepted it as the probable solution. The whole of\nthe script, up to and culminating in this phrase, seems to\nimply that we were on the verge of some definite step. How\nfar the implication was justified, the reader must judge from\nthe next Chapter.\nMrs. Verrall's script of the same day was as follows\n:\n(April 4, 1906. 11 p.m.)\nBut to-night there were three glasses on the table\u2014why is that 1\n1\nBeaumont and Fletcher, The Dead Host's Song.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VI. 363\nChess red and white man and elephants for the castles\u2014and the\nred wins in three moves.\nThere was a meeting at the corner of a street, where the road is\nwider.

Ask\nfor them\u2014gold and coral.\nOn seeing a copy of this, Mrs. Holland wrote to me on\nApril 11th that none of it had any meaning for her except\nthe description of the meeting. She says\n:\nOn the 7th \"there was a meeting at the corner of a street where\nthe road is wider,\" but not \" face to face.\" I ran after some one\nto end a misunderstanding. . . . She was a little \"pleased,\" I think.\nIt was certainly \" not by arrangement\n;\n\" she had returned after\nyears away.\nC ROSS-CORRESPONDENCE.\nEheu Fugaces.\nThe next scripts were written on April 11th. Mrs. Verrall's\nwas as follows\n:\n(April 11, 1906. 11 p.m.)\nNuneaton or some such word was wanted\nIt was not for that he went went away in the long ago\n\u2014\nBells and a whip, and snow upon the ground bright sunshine and\nhard frost\u2014they drive together over frozen roads.

The first\npart seems an imaginary description of an elopement ; then\n\" something fluttered and was gone \" ; then the quotation from\n\f364 Alice Johnson. [part\nTennyson's Maud, \" and the black bat night has flown\" etc.\n;\nwhich leads on to the idea of another kind of flight, \" on bat's\nwings rides Queen Mab.\" And the script declares that there\nhas been \" an effort to have the same words this time.\"\nThe effort seems to have been successful, for Mrs. Holland's\nscript of the same day, after a passing reference apparently\nto the eruption of Vesuvius which was then going on,\nexclaims :\n\" Eheu fugaces.\" 1\nIn the letter dated April 12th enclosing this script, Mrs.\nHolland wrote to me of her experiments with Mrs. Verrall\nthat she wished to continue the Wednesday writings, and she\nadded, \" I can't be content till we get the same message.\"\nThis corresponds rather strikingly with the phrase in Mrs.\nVerrall's script (which, of course, she had not then seen, as\nI only sent her a copy of it on April 16th): \"There is an\neffort to have the same words this time.\" I do not remember-\nthat Mrs. Holland has made a similar remark at any other\ntime. That the idea was prominent in her mind at the\nmoment is shown by the fact that, writing to Mrs. Verrall\non the same day, she said :\n\" I hope we shall keep up our\nWednesday writing wherever I am. I can't help believing\nthat we shall be tuned into accord some day and register\nthe same messages ; but it may take years and will certainly\ntake patience.\" w \u2022\nTt will be noticed that here again, as in the cross-cor-\nrespondence, \" Ave Eoma immortalis,\" Mrs. Verrall gives an\nelaborate description, involving much repetition, whereas Mrs.\nHolland sums up the whole conception in a single phrase,\nand in both cases in a Latin phrase,\u2014familiar enough, no\ndoubt, but one would hardly expect to find Latin at all in\nthe script of a writer who does not know the language.\nThe whole of Mrs. Holland's script of this date is as\nfollows\n:\n(Wednesday, April 11th, 1906. 11.30 p.m.)\n(1) A great black shadow and the sound of a wailing wind\u2014Eheu\nfugaces. 2\n1\nHorace, Odes, ii. 14.\n2 Mrs. Verrall points out that the words \"black\" and \"wailing\" both occur\nin the Ode which begins Eheu fugaces.

Mrs. Holland knew that Mrs. Verrall\nhad been away from home and that she would be back some\ntime in April, and was waiting for her return to send one of\nher rings, so that Mrs. Verrall might try automatic script\nwith it. On April 11th (the clay of this script) I wrote to\n\"Visendus ater flumine languido\nCocytos errans.\"\ni.e., \"We shall have to see the black River of Wailing, wandering with\nsluggish stream.\"\n\f366 Alice Johnson.

I had never seen an owl so distinctly,\nand went to tell Helen of the occurrence, which interested me.\"\nMiss Verrall added :\n\" To the best of my belief, Thursday was\nthe date.\"\nOn the other hand, Mrs. Holland tells me that one of the\nmilder terms of abuse used in India is ooloo or ooloo hi butcha\n(owl's child), and that at the time she regarded the phrase\n\" An owl this evening \" as being addressed to herself by the\nGurney control.\nI quote one more script, to complete the reference to Yately\nlioad, Birmingham, mentioned on April 11th.

J. Ashley lived at 3 Yateley Road,\nEdgbaston, Birmingham, the address given in the script of\nApril 11th. He sent a copy of the sentences on this topic\nto Professor Ashley, asking if there seemed to be anything\nsignificant about them, and Professor Ashley replied\n:\nMay 24, 1906.\n1866 a token. 1866 was the year when I was most seriously ill\nin my life. They called it \"general debility,\" and I was set up by\nbeing sent down to AVales and by abundant coddiver oil. But for\nthe country home of my grandparents to which I could be sent, I\nmight easily have pined away in a Bermondsey which was more\ninsanitary then than now probably. Some circumstances of my\nillness made a great impression on my imagination. . . . the enter-\ntaining literature for children which came most easily within [my]\nreach took the form of little bundles of coloured tracts\u2014 pink, bluish,\ngreen, etc., about missionaries ! I have always supposed I remembered\nhaving my bed littered with these, of divers hues. . . . Doubtless\nthe whole episode impressed [my parents] and me. But I am pretty\nsure the year 1 866 didn't stand out in their minds. Certainly it\ndidn't in mine ;\nthough when your note arrived I thought it probable\nthat was the year. And there are at least half-a-dozen other years\nin my life which would have seemed very significant, if they had\nhappened to be in the communication.\nThe second Emperor of that name conveys absolutely nothing to\nme. ... It may be worth mentioning that sometimes in indexes\nmy name stands under that of the Lord Ashley of the Factory Acts\n(Shaftesbury). [In one] it appears thus:\nAshley, Lord. See Shaftesbury.\nAshley, Professor, 456, 584.\nThere and elsewhere I am \" second of the name \"\n\u2014unworthily. . . .\nObviously no evidential value can be attached to the mention\n\f368 Alice Johnson. [part\nof an address such as that of Professor Ashley, which is to be\nfound in books of reference (Who's Who, for instance), as it is\nimpossible for Mrs. Holland to be sure that she had not at\nsome time happened to see it. It seems to me indeed probable\nthat it was a subliminal recollection, which emerged because\nher mind was rather full of Sir Oliver Lodge at the time, and\ntherefore unconsciously on the scent for any association with\nBirmingham.\nIn the same way I suspect that the presence of Dr. Sidg-\nwick's friend in the house evoked what was certainly a\nsubliminal recollection of something she had read about him,\nfor his habit of standing or pacing about with one hand in his\nbeard was mentioned in the Daily Chronicle review of the\nMemoir of him, which she had read (see above, p. 318). In\nthis case, as in many others, it was only through Mrs. Holland's\ngreat care in noting and sending me information about points\npossibly bearing on her script that I could trace the source\nof this passage. But the fact that so many passages have\nbeen traced to sources of this kind shows that the utmost\ncaution is necessary in estimating all the others which might\nconceivably have a similar origin.\nThe whole study of this case tends to confirm the view\nthat no statement in automatic script that has ever been in\nprint, or is of such a nature as to be known to a good many\npeople, can be regarded as really good evidence of supernormal\nknowledge. It follows that statements about events in the\npast can hardly ever afford good evidence, because, as time\ngoes on, there is always a possibility of more and more people\ngetting to know about them, and happening to mention them\nto the automatist.\nThe \"Scribe incident\" mentioned above (see p. 283) is a\ngood instance of an event that had occurred so recently that\nwe were able to determine that the knowledge of it was con-\nfined to a certain small group of persons. After a few months,\nwe should have been less confident about it. Of course the\nbest evidence for an automatist's ignorance of an event is\nafforded by cases where the event is actually occurring else-\nwhere at the time the script is being produced, and a good\nmany instances of this kind have been given in this paper.\nBut owing to the careful and systematic means taken by\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 369\nMrs. Verrall and Mrs. Holland to have their scripts preserved\nand properly annotated, statements which are not actually\ncontemporaneous may often afford excellent evidence, since we\nknow the date when, if ever, each fact became normally\nknown to the writer. Thus, some of the cross- correspondences\nwere not quite contemporaneous, but (except in the cases\nindicated) all occurred when one writer was completely in the\ndark about the references of the other to the same topic.\nIn the analysis at the beginning of the paper, I have tried, for\nthe convenience of the reader, to indicate which cases are best\nworth study from an evidential point of view up to the end\nof the period dealt with here. The later portions of the script\nmust be left to be dealt with later. Meanwhile in my next\nand final chapter, some theoretical considerations are discussed.\nCHAPTEE VII.\nThe Theory of Cross-correspondences.\n\"It is not we who are in reality the discoverers here. The ex-\nperiments which are being made are not the work of earthly skill.\nAll that we can contribute to the new result is an attitude of\npatience, attention, care ; an honest readiness to receive and weigh\nwhatever may be given into our keeping by intelligences beyond\nour own. Experiments, I say, there are ;\nprobably experiments of\na complexity and difficulty which surpass our imagination ; but they\nare made from the other side of the gulf, by the efforts of spirits\nwho discern pathways and possibilities which for us are impene-\ntrably dark.\"\n\u2014\n(Human Personality, Vol. II. p. 275).\nIn Human Personality Mr. Myers hints more than once at\na favourite theory of his that the influence of science on\nmodern thought is not confined to this life alone, but may\nbe carried on into the next, and so tend to improve the\nevidence for communication from the dead. The latter, he\nsuggests, are coming to understand more and more clearly\nwhat constitutes really good evidence, and may gradually\ndiscover better means of producing it. For the heading of\nthis chapter I have chosen the passage in which he formulates\nthis conjecture most .\nclearly, since it would seem from our\n\f370 Alice Johnson. [part\nrecent investigations that some such experiments as he there\nforeshadowed may actually be taking place.\nAmong the incidents related in this paper that seem to\npoint to some form of supernormal communication between\nMrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall, two main types are to be dis-\ntinguished : (a) those in which one automatist refers to events\nhappening to the other, or to some more or less marked\nfeature in her surroundings, of which the first writer can\napparently have no normal knowledge ; and (b) those in which\nindependent references to the same tojic occur at about the\nsame time in the scripts of both writers. It is to the latter\ntype only that I apply the term \" Cross-correspondence.\"\nI will first briefly summarise the results already obtained\nalong these lines.\nMr. Myers and Dr. Hodgson made attempts at different\ntimes to obtain connections between the utterances\u2014either\nspoken or written\u2014of different automatists. It is by no\nmeans easy even to obtain suitable conditions for trying such\nexperiments, and unfortunately, as far as I am aware, no\ncomplete record of these attempts seems to exist. Some\nreferences to them, however, occur in a number of letters\nwritten by Mr. Myers to Mrs. Thompson from July, 1898,\nto January, 1901, and Mrs. Thompson has kindly allowed me\nto read these letters and to quote here from them. The\nearliest mention of the subject that I can find is on October\n24th, 1898, as follows:\n\"Dr. Hodgson is staying on in America for the winter,\nsitting with Mrs. Piper. It would be grand if we could get\ncommunication between the '\ncontrols ' on each side.\"\nOn July 31st, 1899, referring apparently to some such\ncommunication, Mr. Myers writes :\n\"It is a small matter; but I hope it may be the beginning\nof that spiritual intercourse between the Hampstead and\nBoston centres which we so much desire.\"\nOn November 29th, 1899, Mr. Myers expresses the hope\nthat Mrs. Thompson may meet another sensitive in his house.\n\" Your spirits might travel (he writes) between drawing-room\nand study.\"\nOn December 2nd, 1899, he explains further his plans for\nexperiments between Mrs. Thompson and this lady, who, he\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 371\nsays, \" is anxious to see you repeatedly . . . partly that\nyour attendant spirits may make acquaintance and may be\nable to transmit messages. I think this an excellent plan\nand am very glad that she desires it. The evidential draw-\nback in the world's eyes (possible plottings together !) is quite\nnullified by the power of ourselves suggesting words for [her]\nto say through you, or for you to say through her. . . .\nI think it really important and possible to get your spirits,\nhers, and Mrs. Piper's, to co-operate in their world and use,\nperhaps, each sensitive's brain indifferently.\"\nThe next and last reference to the topic in these letters is\non August 2nd, 1900, when Mr. Myers suggests the possibility\nof communication between the \" controls \" of Mrs. Thompson\nand those of the lady who is called \" Miss Eawson \" in Mr.\nPiddington's paper referred to below. Mr. Myers writes that\nhe hopes to go on in a few days' time from a sitting with\nMrs. Thompson to one with \" Miss Eawson,\" and that then,\nperhaps, a communication between the two groups of \"con-\ntrols \" might occur.\nA phenomenon somewhat analogous to this connection be-\ntween two groups of controls was exemplified in the experi-\nments of Dr. van Eeden with Mrs. Thompson (see his paper on\nsitting's with Mrs. Thompson in Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XVII.,\nespecially pp. 86-7 and 112-115). Dr. van Eeden, having\ncultivated the power of controlling his own dreams, so as to\nbe able to dream of performing actions which he had planned\nwhile awake, arranged with Mrs. Thompson that he would\noccasionally call Nelly (her \" control \") in his dreams after\nreturning to Holland, and that if she heard him calling she\nshould tell Mr. Piddington, who was in charge of the\nsittings, at his next sitting. On three occasions in January\nand February, 1900, some success was obtained in these\nexperiments ; that is, Nelly stated that she had heard Dr.\nvan Eeden calling and had been to see him ; the dates she\ngave were approximately, though not exactly, the same as\nthose recorded in his diary of dreams ;\nbut on each occasion\nshe gave details, which were afterwards verified, as to his\ncircumstances at the time. On a fourth occasion (April 19th,\n1900), when Nelly stated that she had been to see Dr. van\nEeden, he had no dream of her at the time, but she gave a\n\f372 Alice Johnson. [part\ndescription of his condition which corresponded with what it\nhad been during the early part of the same month.\nA case of a somewhat similar kind is recorded in Dr.\nHodgson's report on Mrs. Piper {Proceedings, Vol. VIII.\np. 120), where Mr. M. N. relates that Mrs. Piper's control,\n\" Dr. Phinuit,\" had said that he had tried to influence Mr.\nN.'s dying father about certain matters connected with his\nwill. Later Mr. N.'s sister, who had been with their father\nat the time, told him that he had repeatedly complained of\nthe presence of an old man at the foot of his bed, who\nannoyed him by discussing his private affairs.\nSome interesting connections between the automatisms of Mrs.\nThompson and those of other sensitives are recorded in Mr.\nPiddington's paper \" On the Types of Phenomena displayed in\nMrs. Thompson's Trance \" in Proceedings S.P.P., Vol. XVIII.\npp. 104-307. In one case (see pp. 205-208), during a sitting\nof Mr. Myers's with Miss Pawson at Valescure on the after-\nnoon of December 22nd, 1900, a soi-disant Mrs. Thompson\n\"possessed\" Miss Pawson for a minute or two. Mr. Piddington\nheard of this from Mr. Myers, and at his next meeting with\nMrs. Thompson on January 1st, 1901, she told him in reply\nto a question that on the afternoon of December 22nd, she\nwas resting in her own house at Hampstead and slept part of\nthe time. After telling him this she became entranced, and\nduring the trance Nelly told him that she had been to see Miss\nPawson on the day in question. The hour of Mrs. Thompson's\nsleep and Miss Eawson's experience did not exactly coincide.\nIn the last section of Mr. Piddington's paper (op. cit., pp.\n294-307), he describes \"a few other instances of apparent\nconcordance between the trance-utterances of Mrs. Thompson\nand those of Miss Pawson, and the automatic writing of the\nlady whom [we call Mrs. Forbes], of which the prima facie\nexplanation is either that Mrs. Thompson in trance becomes\naware of the content of their automatic speech or script, or\nthat one and the same control has conveyed similar communi-\ncations through two different mediums.\"\nFull details of these cases are given by Mr. Piddington,\nand he concludes\n:\nThe resemblances quoted above are far from complete; they are\nsuggestive rather than indicative of supernormal agency; yet I\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 373\ncannot ascribe them to chance. If they are not supernormal, I\nwould attribute them to the minds of both automatists having\ndeveloped from similar data in their common possession similar\nfantasies, accordant with the general trend of ideas that runs through\nspiritistic manifestations. But at least I claim for them serious study,\nfor could we be fortunate enough (and I am rather sanguine that\nwe may be) to multiply analogous and more clinching instances of\nthe same phenomenon, it would open up one of the most promising\nlines for observation, and even, perhaps, for experimentation\n(p. 307).\nMr. Piddington's remark that some correspondence may\nresult merely from similar trains of ideas in the minds of the\ntwo automatists should certainly be kept in view in the in-\nterpretation of all such cases, and it may perhaps be held to\naccount for some of the cross-correspondences in my report.\nBut his insistence on the importance of this type of pheno-\nmenon and his hope that it would lead to good results in\nfuture have, I think, been amply justified by the recent rapid\ndevelopment of cross-correspondences\u2014a development which has\ntaken place since Mr. Myers's death.\nThis was shown first in Mrs. Verrall's script, and a consider-\nable section of her Report on it (pp. 205-275) is devoted to an\naccount of the cross-correspondences between her script and the\nscript or automatic speech of other automatists. One of the first of\nthese, in May, 1901, was with Mrs. Thompson {op. tit., pp. 207-9),\nand a striking case occurred with Mrs. Piper (pp. 213-17); but\nthe most important were the long series with Mrs. Forbes, dating\nfrom February, 1901, onwards. In this account Mrs. Verrall\nincludes under the common term of \" Cross-correspondence\n\"\ncases where one automatist describes correctly some fact about\nthe other, and those where references to the same topic occur\nindependently in the two scripts ; but a considerable proportion\nof the cases are of the latter type, to which I think it most\nconvenient to restrict the term.\nIn studying these in proof in the early part of 1906, I\nwas struck by the fact that in some of the most remarkable\ninstances the statements in the script of one writer were by no\nmeans a simple reproduction of statements in the script of the\nother, but seemed to represent different aspects of the same idea,\none supplementing or completing the other. Thus, in one case\n2a\n\f374 Alice Johnson. [part\n(p. 223), Mrs. Forbes's script, purporting to come from her son\nTalbot, stated that he must now leave her, since he was looking-\nfor a sensitive who wrote automatically, in order that he might\nobtain corroboration of her own writing. Mrs. Verrall, on the\nsame day, wrote of a fir-tree planted in a garden, and the script\nwas signed with a sword and suspended bugle. The latter was\npart of the badge of the regiment to which Talbot Forbes\nhad belonged, and Mrs. Forbes had in her garden some fir-\ntrees, grown from seed sent to her by her son. These facts\nwere unknown to Mrs. Verrall.\nIn another case (pp. 241-245)\u2014too complicated to sum-\nmarise here\u2014Mrs. Forbes produced, on November 26th and\n27th, 1902, references, absolutely meaningless to herself, to a\npassage in the Symposium which Mrs. Verrall had been read-\ning on those clays. These references also applied appropriately\nto an obscure sentence in Mrs. Verrall's own script of November\n26th, and on December 18th attempts were made in Mrs.\nForbes's script to give a certain test word, \" Dion \" or \" Dy,\"\nwhich, it was stated, \" will be found in Myers' own . .\n.\"\nMrs. Verrall interpreted the test word at the time, for reasons\ngiven, as \" Diotima,\" and a description of the same part of\nthe Symposium, including the mention of Diotima, did occur in\nHuman Personality, which was published about three months\nlater, in February, 1903. Further references to the Symposium\nappeared in Mrs. Forbes's script in the early part of 1903\n(see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 246).\nIn another case (pp. 269-271), October 16th, 1904, Mrs.\nVerrall's script gave details, afterwards verified, of what\nMrs. Forbes was doing, and immediately afterwards Mrs. Verrall\nhad a mental impression of Mrs. Forbes sitting in her drawing-\nroom, with the figure of her son standing looking at her.\nMrs. Forbes's script of the same day, purporting to come from\nher son, stated that he was present and wished she could see\nhim, and that a test was being given for her at Cambridge.\nI became convinced through the study of these cases that\nthere was some special purpose in the particular form they\ntook,-\u2014all the more because in Mrs. Verrall's script statements\nwere often associated with them, apparently to draw attention\nto some peculiar kind of test,\u2014described, e.g. as superposing\ncertain tilings on others, when all would be clear.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 375\nThe characteristic of these cases\u2014or at least of some of\nthem\u2014is that we do not get in the writing of one auto-\nmatist anything like a mechanical verbatim reproduction of\nphrases in the other ; we do not even get the same idea\nexpressed in different ways,\u2014as might well result from direct\ntelepathy between them. What we get is a fragmentary utter-\nance in one script, which seems to have no particular point\nor meaning, and another fragmentary utterance in the other,\nof an equally pointless character ; but when we put the two\ntogether, we see that they supplement one another, and that\nthere is apparently one coherent idea underlying both, but only\npartially expressed in each.\nIt occurred to me, then, that by this method, if by any, it\nmight be possible to obtain evidence more conclusive than any\nobtained hitherto of the action of a third intelligence, external\nto the minds of both automatists. If we simply find the same\nidea expressed\u2014even though in different forms\u2014by both of\nthem, it may, as I have just said, most easily be explained by\ntelepathy between them ; but it is much more difficult to\nsuppose that the telepathic perception of one fragment could\nlead to the production of another fragment which can only, after\ncareful comparison, be seen to be related to the first.\nThe weakness of all well-authenticated cases of apparent\ntelepathy from the dead is, of course, that they can generally\nbe explained by telepathy from the living. If the knowledge\ndisplayed by the medium is possessed by any person certainly\nexisting,\u2014that is, any living person,\u2014we must refer it to that\nsource rather than to a person whose existence is uncertain,\n\u2014\nthat is, a dead person. To do otherwise would be to beg the\nwhole question at issue, for the very thing to be proved is\nthe existence of the dead person.\nHitherto the evidence for survival has depended on state-\nments that seem to show the control's recollection of incidents\nin his past life. It would be useless for him to communicate\ntelepathically anything about his present life, because there\ncould be no proof of the truth of the communication. This\nis the fundamental difference between the types of evidence\nfor telepathy from the living and for telepathy from the dead.\nAnd the fact suggests a certain conception as to the nature\nof survival propounded by Dr. Leaf in his review of Human\n\f376 Alice Johnson. [part\nPersonality, in the Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. XVIII. pp. 53\net seq. He says :\n[The evidence] seems to me to show that after the death\nof the body there remains a more or less coherent complex of\nmemories which is accessible to the subliminal self of certain living\npersons. What I do not as yet see is that this complex has such\ncoherence as can enable us to consider it a personality. . . . The\nevidence seems to point rather to an alternative which is at least\nconsistent with analogy . . . that, as the physical body only gradually\ndissolves into its elements after death, so the spiritual retains for a\ntime a certain coherence which is no proof of life. ... It may be\npossible for peculiarly gifted living spirits to behold the gradually\ndisintegrating spirit, and bring us word, with more or less com-\npleteness, of what the spiritual man was during life (pp. 56-7).\nAgain, he says (p. 5 9):\n[The evidence] proves, I think, that memories of the dead survive\nand are under special conditions accessible to us. But I do not see\nthat it proves the survival of what we call the living spirit, the\npersonality\u2014a unit of consciousness, limited and self-contained, a\ncentre of will and vital force, carrying on into another world the\naspirations and the affections of this.\nI venture to think that some of the evidence obtained since\nDr. Leaf wrote has a certain bearing on this argument.\nEvidence for telepathy from the dead, as he implies and as I\nhave just stated, has hitherto mainly referred to events in the\npast. Now, telepathy relating to the present, such as we some-\ntimes get between living persons, must be stronger evidentially\nthan telepathy relating to the past, because it is much easier\nto exclude normal knowledge of events in the present than of\nevents in the past. But it has been supposed impossible that\nwe could ever get this kind of evidence for telepathy from\nthe dead ; since events in the present are either known to\nsome living person, in which case we could not exclude his\ntelepathic agency; or they are unknown to any living person,\nin which case it would be difficult or impossible to prove that\nthey had occurred.\nIn these cross-correspondences, however, we find apparently\ntelepathy relating to the present,\u2014that is, the corresponding\nstatements are approximately contemporaneous,\u2014and to events\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 377\nin the present which, to all intents and purposes, are unknown\nto any living person, since the meaning and point of her script\nis often uncomprehended by each autoniatist until the solution\nis found through putting the two scripts together. At the\nsame time we have proof of what has occurred in the scripts\nthemselves. Thus it appears that this method is directed\ntowards satisfying our evidential requirements.\nNow, granted the possibility of communication, it may be\nsupposed that within the last few years a certain group of\npersons have been trying to communicate with us, who are\nsufficiently well instructed to know all the objections that\nreasonable sceptics have urged against the previous evidence,\nand sufficiently intelligent to realise to the full all the force\nof these objections. It may be supposed that these persons\nhave invented a new plan,\u2014the plan of cross-correspondences,\n\u2014\nto meet the sceptics' objections. There is no doubt that the\ncross-correspondences are a characteristic element in the scripts\nthat we have been collecting in the last few years,\u2014the scripts\nof Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Forbes, Mrs. Holland, and, still more\nrecently, Mrs. Piper. And the important point is that the\nelement is a new one. We have reason to believe, as I\nhave shown above, that the idea of making a statement in\none script complementary of a statement in another had not\noccurred to Mr. Myers in his life-time, for there is no reference\nto it in any of his written utterances on the subject that I\nhave been able to discover. Also, it seems to me almost\ncertain that if he had thought of it durina,' his life-time, I\nshould have heard of it while helping him in the publication\nof Human Personality, or he would have mentioned it to some\nof his friends and colleagues in the S.P.R. Neither did those\nwho have been investigating automatic script since his death\ninvent this plan, if plan it be. It was not the automatists\nthat detected it, but a student of the scripts ; it has every\nappearance of being an element imported from outside ; it\nsuggests an independent invention, an active intelligence con-\nstantly at work in the present, not a mere echo or remnant\nof individualities of the past.\nThis theory of the cross-correspondences seemed confirmed\nby some of the phrases in Mrs. Verrall's script which were\nquoted incidentally in her Report, as well as by some of the\n\f378 Alice Johnson. [part\nobscure Latin words, which she says were used in special\nsenses, unintelligible to her at the time. Thus she writes\n(see her Report, p. 39) :\nThere are further a few cases of words apparently used in a special\nsense, though they have so many possible meanings that it cannot\nbe decided with certainty what is intended by their use in the script.\nFor instance, repeated injunctions are to be found for the application\nof processes described as destringere [to unsheathe], nexere [to weave\nor bind together], superpomre [to superpose], to the words of the\nscript ; in particular, it is constantly urged that if some words were\ntaken, sume, and some process of superposition were then applied,\nsuperpone, sense would be seen where now there is apparent nonsense.\nBut no definite directions have ever been given as to this process\nof superposition, and the later writings contain few references to it.\nAll these phrases appear to me efforts to express in different\nways the idea of the supplementary parts of a cross- corre-\nspondence, which, when properly \" superposed,\" \" woven together,\"\nand \" unsheathed,\" become clear. The same notion is, 1 think,\nexpressed in yet another form in the following passage from\nan automatic poem written by Mrs. Verrall on July 20th, 1904,\nwhen experimenting simultaneously with \" Miss Eawson,\" (see\nher Report, p. 36 2):\nSo flash successive visions in a glass\nthe while we dreaming scarce behold them pass.\nYet all the while on the awakened soul\neach flitting image helps imprint the whole\nand superposed on what was first impressed\nfills so the outline, colour, and the rest,\nand while we only watch the master's hand,\nno glimpse vouchsafed us of the building planned,\nstone upon stone, the battlements arise,\ntill the fair fabric flashes in the skies.\nLater, I asked Mrs. Verrall to look through all her script\nup to Easter, 1906, and make a complete list of passages in\nit bearing on this theory of cross-correspondences, and I quote\nhere a number of the more definite of these passages, using\nMrs. Verrall's translations of the Latin and Greek phrases in\nthem. It will lie seen that much of the early script is uncon-\nstruable and only approximations to the meaning can be given\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 379\nin translation.

Monas means \"a unit\" and ducts means the number \"two,\" so that\nthese verbs ought to mean \"to make one\" and \"to make two.\" Monazein is\nused in Greek in the sense of \"to be alone,\" and duazein is used in the sense\nof \"to couple.\" The word monei in the script of April 3rd, 1901, does not\nexist. It is obviously meant to be connected with memos (alone), but the form\nis incorrect.\n\f380 Alice Johnson. [part\n(Aug. 16th, 1901.)

There is a word stochazesthai which means to\nguess, but this is only used in the passive form and the first syllable has o only\nnot oi.\nThere is a word sioicheion which means \"element\" or \"uncompounded thing.\"\nThere are many derivates from this, but none could be formed with a, as\nstoichazein. It seems, however, that some supposed derivative of stoicheion is\naimed at, at least on March 19th, 1902, where it is combined with the word\nsunthetos. For the two words stoicheion and suntheton are contrasted by\nAristotle as meaning respectively \"primary element\" and \"thing compounded.\"\nThe meaning on September 28th, 1901, is quite uncertain, and on July 13th,\n1902, the word sunstochazei must, I think, be a part of stochazesthai. It has\nthe o and not the oi, and the addition of the preposition sun makes no sente\nin any word derived from stoicheion.\nThere is also a word stoichas (stem, stoichad-) meaning \"lying in rows or\nlines.\" The word was not known to me till I found it in Liddell and Scott's\nlexicon. Stoichazein would mean \"to make a stoichas,\" and therefore on\nSeptember 28th, 1901, the meaning might be \"arrange in rows; in mysteries\nI weave,\" etc. On March 19th, 1902, the meaning would be \" why then do-\nyou arrange in rows? it is better to receive,\" etc., but in this case the\nopposition with suntheton disappears. Considering the general tendency of the\nscript to make up verbs from nouns without much attention to philology, I do\nnot think reliance can be placed on exact forms of Greek, and I should not\nbe surprised at finding stoichazein used to mean \"make a stoicheion,\" though\nit ought to mean \"make a stoichas.\"\n:!\nNutans superponit magno labore nec sine artificis adiumento.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 381\nthe friends see together the same light is the force that we use for\nthis letter.\nThus Mrs. Verrall's script contains a phrase indicating that\na cross-correspondence is occurring ; while Mrs. Forbes's script,\nwhich seems to show some slight connection with Mrs. Verrall's,\nrefers\u2014as I take it\u2014to some faint telepathy between the\nliving, similar to and perhaps reinforced by telepathy from\nthe dead (see Mrs. Verrall's Report, p. 226).\n(Dec. 10th, 1901.)

Mrs. A^errall knew nothing either of\nMr. Constable, or of his plan, at the time her script was\nproduced ; but this script seems to show a knowledge of Mr.\nConstable's desire, and at the same time an intention to satisfy\nit,\u2014not as he had planned by getting the same statement\nthrough both automatists, but by getting part through one and\npart through the other.\n(Nov. 3rd, 1902.)

But there will be no sensations in what I say\u2014it\nwill be aimed at something quite other and only a long trial can be\nof any use. Begin now to write the words I give . . .\nAs is well known, various attempts had been made in Mrs.\nVerrall's script during 1903 and 1904 to give the contents\nof a sealed envelope left by Mr. Myers (see her Report, pp.\n299-301 and 423-425). These attempts seemed first to refer\nto an envelope said to have been left with Dr. Hodgson\n;\nbut it turned out that Dr. Hodgson possessed no such envelope.\nLater,\u2014especially in July, 1904,\u2014specific statements were made\nabout a sealed envelope left with Sir Oliver Lodge, who did\nactually possess one. Mrs. Verrall tells me that she had\nalways regarded the script of Aug. 10th, 1904, quoted above,\nas suggesting that a new type of experiment\u2014she did not\nunderstand what, but something different from the experiments\nwith sealed envelopes\u2014was to be tried, for she considered\nthat the script had already completed all it could say about\nthe envelope. The most specific statements about the envelope\nwere made during July, 1904, and the only references after-\nwards were: (1) on Aug. 14th, 1904, \"in one envelope the\nreference to Love, in the other to Hope. And you will not\nlook\u2014Faith is not yours\"; and (2) on Nov. 25th, 1904,\nanother exhortation to open the envelope. This was done on\nDec. 13th, 1904.\nMrs. Holland's reference on Feb. 15th, 1905, to the opening\nof this envelope has been related and discussed above (see\np. 241), and it will be remembered that, as far as we can\nascertain, she had no normal knowledge of any of the circum-\nstances until Oct. 6th, 1905. Yet on Aug. 8th, 1905, her\nscript contained the following\n:\nI want you all to devise a better test. The sealed envelopes are\nnot the best. Set your wits to work.\nAt the time this was written, I knew nothing of the similar\nsentiment in Mrs. Verrall's script, which, it will be seen,\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 385\napplies appropriately to my conception of a cross-correspondence\nas something (a) which the automatist herself \" will probably\nnot understand,\" since it is purposely obscure ; but (b) \" the\ntruth will be manifest \" when \" you can compare your own\nwords with another's \" ; further (c) \" there will be no sensations\nin what I say\u2014it will be aimed at something quite other, and\nonly a long trial can be of any use\n' ;\n; that is, as I understand\nit, there will be no startling results, which will appeal at\nonce to all the world as conclusive evidence of communications\nfrom the dead ; that is not even the aim ;\nonly by a long\nseries of cautious and tentative experiments can we hope to\narrive at the truth.\nThe following is again from Mrs. Verrall's script\n:\n(Aug. 21st, 1904.) But the end is not yet nor here\u2014write only,\ninterpret not \u2014record the bits and when fitted they will make the\nwhole.\nAnother metaphor, apparently intended to express the same\nidea, occurs in the script of July 11th, 1905, as follows:\nA broken thread can you not mend and the\nscattered fragments place to perfection.\n(In Greek : It was not without him who sets\nall in order.)\n(In Latin : You ought to unite the parts converging into one. The\nfigure which is made from them should be contemplated not only\nby you but by others well versed in figures. In the midst is a\nlight with flashing rays, a bright star in the sky.\nLike the light-bearing star that rules the seasons,\nwandering by night, hidden by the light of the\nsun, which yet wanders ever in the heavens night\nand day, though it cannot be perceived when the\nsun reigns.) 1\nAnd so many things seen not, except from the depths\nof Truth's Well, but always there waiting for the seeing mind.\n1\novk fjv avet> rod iravra kog\/aovvtos. eonvergentes in unum sociare debes \u2014figura\nquae ex iis efficitur contemplaiida non tibi solae sed ceteris figurarum bene\neruditis. in medio lux cum radiis fulgentibus\u2014Stella in caelo lucida.\nLucifero similis astro i 11 i qui tempora regit, nocitvagus, lumine solis adopertu?,\n\u2014qui quidem semper in polo errat dies atque noctes etsi non percipi potest\ncum regnat Sol.\n\f38G Alice Johnson. [PAKT\nThe metaphor with which the above script opens seems to\nbe a reminiscence of some earlier utterances. On Feb. 13th,\n1902, had occurred the phrase: \"Berries or pearls on a\nstring, and the string breaks but they are not lost\u2014scattered\nthey were.\" Still earlier, on April 14th, 1901, reference had\nbeen made to \" pearls before swine, my [pearls] perhaps\nvalueless to you [i.e. Mrs. Verrall].\" This earliest reference\nis probably a half-humorous complaint that the sayings of\nthe control are not appreciated. The next one, about pearls\non a string which is broken, may be taken to mean the\nfragments of a cross-correspondence,\u2014the same notion being\nfurther developed and amplified on July 11th, 1905, and\napparently symbolised by the drawing of incomplete arcs of a\ncircle.\nThe next passage occurs in Mrs. Verrall's script of Feb. 9th,\n1906, in connection with the cross-correspondences with Mrs.\nHolland :\n\" Not in the Electra,\" and \" Henry was not mis-\ntaken \" (see above, p. 310).\n(Feb. 9th, 1906.) (In Latin and Greek: They grow faint, but are\nnot without putting together. So what has been believed by the\ndisciples, if compared with certain other things, adds parts of wisdom.\nIf not all, why not some'? For instance, this:) 1\nWe must now consider how far the actual cross-correspond-\nences between Mrs. Holland and Mrs. Verrall recorded in this\npaper conform to the type described.\n(1) The first one, the \"Selwyn text\" (see above, pp. 219 ct seq.)\nis difficult to estimate, since it consists of a number of more\nor less similar passages in the two series of scripts. In each\ncase, taken alone, the similarity might certainly be put clown\nto chance, but the cumulative effect of the large number of\nsimilarities, together with the marked appropriateness of some\nof the phrases to the circumstances, seem to show that\nsomething beyond chance is at work. Yet we cannot say\nwith any confidence what central idea is intended to be\nconveyed by this somewhat miscellaneous medley. If it was\nOr. Sidgwick's text, Mrs. Verrall obtained only two rather\n1\nEvanescent oi'5' dvcv <7Vp8rjfj.aTOS. to. d' oiv deSoy\/xeva reus fxaOrjrais TrapaXijcj.dei'Ta\nKal aAXois na'iv fxa6i]aeus pApt) -rrpoafytpa. Si lion omnia, cur non qnaedam ?\nHaec :\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 387\nvague paraphrases of it, and Mrs. Holland did not obtain it\nat all. On the other hand, the text given by Mrs. Holland\nmight be regarded (for the reasons given in the full discus-\nsion of it) as an attempt by Mr. Myers to give a test of\nidentity chosen by himself; and to this conjectural situation\nMrs. Verrall's contemporary phrase, \"The question is answered\nand the text given,\" is not inappropriate.\n(2) The cross-correspondence of notes of music, on March\n15th-22nd, 1905 (see p. 254) is, on the other hand, a very\nsimple one, and not in itself evidential of anything beyond\ndirect telepathy between the two automatists.\n(3) \"Not in the Electra \" and \"Henry was not mistaken\"\n(p. 310) are instances of remarks being made by one writer\nwhich are distinctly appropriate to something which has been\nsaid in the script of the other.\n(4) \" Eoden Noel\" (p. 316) is an excellent illustration of\ndetails given in one script which it would be very difficult\nto refer to direct telepathy from the other ;\nbut, as explained\nin the full account, the weak point here is the impossibility\nof excluding the writers' subliminal knowledge of the facts\nmentioned, in which case the whole might be put down to\nsubliminal association of ideas on both sides. Tor the train\nof ideas in Mrs. Holland's case may conceivably have been\nstarted by a subliminal recognition of the similarity between\nMrs. Verrall's verses and Koden Noel's poem.\n(5) \"Ave Eoma Immortalis \" (p. 297) is the clearest case\nof what I regard as a typical cross-correspondence, in that a\nnumber of details of the picture, quite unintelligible to\nherself, were given by Mrs. Verrall, while a single other\nimportant detail, clinching the whole matter, was given by\nMrs. Holland, accompanied by a remark implying that Mrs.\nVerrall had been purposely kept in the dark. Even here,\nhowever, since Dr. Verrall saw Mrs. Verrall's first script soon\nafter its production, and associated it mentally with the picture,\nthere was one person who had in his mind the idea to be\nconveyed, and it is therefore not impossible that Mrs. Holland\nmay have received it telepathically from him. If so, however,\nwhy did she add \" How could I make it any clearer without\ngiving her the clue ?\n\" Eor this certainly was not derived from\nany idea at least consciously in Dr. Verrall's mind.\n\f388 Alice Johnson. [part\n(6) \" Posilipo \" (p. 334) is another case where Mrs.\nHolland's script comments very appropriately on Mrs. Verrall's\n\u2014\" M. (she says) saw a real place that last time, but she\nhas never seen the place itself.\" On the same day Mrs.\nVerrall writes a description of Posilipo, which she has never\nseen.\n(7) \" Eheu fugaces \"\n(p. 363) is a case where Mrs.\nHolland's script sums up in one apt paraphrase an idea\nrepeated in several different forms by Mrs. Verrall.\n(8) \"Fawcett\" (p. 341). In this case Mrs. Holland\nobtained the name Fawcett eight days after Mrs. Verrall had\nbeen led to it through planchette writing with Mrs. Forbes,\nthe planchette saying that Mrs. Holland must give it too.\nMrs. Holland connected the name\u2014-no doubt through a natural\nassociation of ideas\u2014with Henry Fawcett, but gave some\ncorrect details connected with the Fawcetts to whom Mrs.\nVerrall's writing referred.\nThese cases, though by no means so numerous as we might\nwish, are yet sufficiently so, I think, to form a basis for\ndiscussion.\nProbably the first point which will strike every careful\nreader will be that evidence for mere connection between the\ntwo series of scripts would be more satisfactorily provided by\nidentical statements than by similar or supplementary state-\nments ; for the odds against identical statements occurring in\ntwo scripts are clearly much greater than the odds against\nthe occurrence of similar statements. And, of course, in\nordinary experiments in telepathy, we value complete suc-\ncesses much more than partial ones, other things being\nequal.\nThe whole amount of connection shown between the scripts\nwill, I think, be admitted to be beyond what could have\nbeen produced by chance, and among the simpler cases are\nsome which may be called \" complete successes.\" Thus the\n\"Scribe incident\" (p. 283), the coincidental statement about\nSir Oliver Lodge's illness (p. 277), and the description of\nMrs. Forbes's dining-room (p. 329), by Mrs. Holland ;\nand\nMrs. Verrall's coincidental statement about Carpaccio's St.\nUrsula (p. 254); may all be described as successes complete\nof their kind, since apparently there was success in what was\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland, Chapter VII. 389\naimed at. On the other hand, the statement about \" Mr.\nGrove\" and cancer (p. 279) may be described as an incomplete\nsuccess, since it was true of Mrs., not of Mr. Grove, and so\napparently came near, but fell short of, its aim.\nThe question then arises whether the cross-correspondences\nshould be regarded as cases of telepathy between the two\nautomatists\u2014only partially successful ;\n\u2014or cases in which some\nthird agency, external to both of them, was endeavouring to\nproduce some rather different result.\nAssuming that the controls are actually trying to communi-\ncate some definite idea by means of two different automatists,\nwhom at the same time they are trying to prevent from\ncommunicating telepathically with one another, what the\ncontrols have to do is to express the factors of the idea in so\nveiled a form that each writer indites her own share without\nunderstanding it. Yet the expression must be so definite that,\nwhen once the clue is found, no room is left for doubt as\nto the proper interpretation.\nIt will be seen that, ex hypothesi, the idea must be pre-\nvented from reaching the subliminal consciousness of the\nautomatists ;\nyet we cannot be certain in any case that it has\nbeen so prevented, as we can only interrogate their supraliminal\nconsciousnesses. It is conceivable, however, that the controls\nare more capable than living persons of manipulating their\nown telepathic faculties. Just as we in ordinary conversation\ncan say what we like and abstain from saying what we wish\nnot to say ; so it is possible that the controls can telepathically\nconvey certain things to the automatists, stopping short at\nwhatever point they choose, and thus excluding subliminal\ncomprehension of the underlying ideas.\nPerhaps the most serious practical objection to the\nhypothesis that the controls invented this special plan of\ncross-correspondences would be that it might have been a\nsubliminal invention of Mrs. Verrall's, since it is on her script\nthat the hypothesis is chiefly based, and it is there that we\nfind the most complete exposition of it.\nThere are, however, a few indications of it in Mrs. Holland's\nscript also, quite independently of Mrs. Verrall's. Thus we\nfind in Mrs. Holland's script on September 21st, 1903, the\nday on which the description of a room afterwards identified\n2 b\n\f390 Alice Johnson. [part\nas Mrs. Verrall's dining-room was written (see p. 194), the\nfollowing\n:\n\" There is no effort unavailing,\nYou fail\u2014yet save another's failing,\nOne person alone does so little.\"\nAgain on November 7th, .1903, the day when the descrip-\ntion of a man, probably Dr. Verrall, was given (see p. 186),\n\" The agent 1\nis all alone, and that makes it hard.\"\nSee also the passages dated Dec. 1st and 5 th, 1903,\nand Jan. 5th, 1904, quoted on p. 238 under the heading\n\" Co-operation between different sensitives,\" all these being\nconnected with the first cross-correspondence with Mrs. Verrall.\nAgain, on February 22nd, 1905 (for context see p. 246),\nthe control, complaining of the difficulties of communication,\nremarks :\n\" The influence of my friends near at hand might\nbe able to combat this, but then thought-transference would\nmake yet another difficulty,\"\u2014that is, the script recognises\nthat what is desired is to transcend telepathy between the\nliving.\nThe most definite passage bearing on this point in Mrs.\nHolland's script is the one already quoted in connection with\nthe cross-correspondence :\n\" Ave Roma immortalis,\" viz. \" How\ncan I make it any clearer without giving her the clue ?\n\"\nThese passages are few in number, and\u2014-except the last\n\u2014\nare vague and rather indefinite. No special significance could\nbe attached to them if it were not that they seem, as far\nas they go, to confirm the far more numerous and specific\nstatements in Mrs. Verrall's script.\nYet it may be noticed that all of them, except the one\noccurring on February 22nd, 1905, are connected with evi-\ndential or would-be evidential portions of the script,\u2014portions\nwhich there is some reason to attribute to an intelligence\nexternal to Mrs. Holland's own mind. And this is of course\nthe strongest ground\u2014indeed, the only ground\u2014for attributing\nthese phrases also to an external intelligence.\nSimilarly, if we extract from Mrs. Verrall's script all the\npassages which I take to relate to the theory of cross-\n1\nMrs. Holland not being very familiar with psychical nomenclature some-\ntimes uses this term almost in the meaning of \"percipient.\" The context\nhere shows that it means the automatist.\n\flv.] Automatic Writing of Mrs. Holland. Chapter VII. 391\ncorrespondences, and consider them apart from their context,\nthere is nothing evidential in them, for the theory expounded\nis obviously not beyond Mrs. Verrall's inventive capacity,\nthough she did not grasp it at all at the time.\nBut most of the passages occur in close connection with\nactual cross-correspondences and are clearly intended to relate\nto them ;\nthey form, in fact, a sort of running commen-\ntary on them. How, then, could Mrs. Verrall\u2014from her\nnormal subliminal resources alone\u2014have made remarks so\nappropriate to facts unknown to her at the time ? For she\ndid not of course know of the cross-correspondences till some\ntime after they had occurred.\nAll the circumstances suggest, I think, that one and the\nsame intelligence, or group of co-operating intelligences, was\nresponsible both for the cross-correspondences and for the con-\ntemporary comments on them.\nNevertheless, for anything like an adequate proof of the\nagency suggested, far more instances, and instances of a more\ncogent kind than any included in this report, are obviously\nneeded. The evidence in regard to cross-correspondences here\nadduced, though in my view well worth consideration, is slender\nenough in proportion to the superstructure of hypothesis which\nI have based on it. It is, in fact, so slender that I should\ncertainly not have ventured to bring forward such a hypothesis\nnow, were it not for the further evidence pointing in the same\ndirection in the more recent portions of Mrs. Holland's script,\nwith which I hope to deal later, and especially for the im-\nportant series of cross-correspondences recently obtained between\nMrs. Verrall, Mrs. Piper, Miss Verrall, and Mrs. Holland, which\nwill be described in Mr. Piddington's forthcoming report.\n\f392 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEW.\nThe Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism, fraudulent and genuine. By\nHereward Carrington. Illustrated, 12mo. Cloth. $2 net.\n(Boston, U.S.A. : Herbert B. Turner & Co., 1907.)\nThis is an exceptionally interesting and instructive book by an\nexceptionally qualified writer. Mr. Hereward Carrington's name\nrequires no introduction to readers of the S.P.R. Proceedings.\nThe aim and raison d'etre of his work the author sums up thus\n:\n\"The investigations of the Society for Psychical Research,\" he\nsays, \"... have demonstrated the fact that supernormal pheno-\nmena do occur, but whether the physical phenomena are to be\nconsidered as such is a question that remains still undecided.\" Mr.\nCarrington accordingly divides his book into two parts. In the\nfirst he deals with the fraudulent phenomena, the methods used to\nproduce spurious \"manifestations\" being exhaustively described; in\nthe second with the apparently genuine, i.e. with those incidents in\nthe literature of the subject for which the writer fails to find a\nsatisfactory explanation on normal lines. I regret to add that this\nsecond part of the book is by far the shorter and less interesting.\nMr. Carrington seems to have quite an extraordinary knowledge\nof conjuring and pseudo-mediumistic tricks, and throughout the four\nhundred pages of his book he almost unceasingly opens up in this\ndirection such vistas, that the uninitiated reader's breath is simply\ntaken away. For my own part I must say that after a perusal of\nhis work I feel much more strongly than I ever did before that in\nview of the boundlessness of human ingenuity \u2014especially of the\nmisdirected kind\u2014and of the unimaginable variety of the methods\nused to produce the desired effects,\u2014the evidence of the average\nhonest and intelligent observer (at least when dealing with the\nAmerican professional) is certainly of little weight. The conviction\neven is beginning to dawn upon my mind that there may be\nregions in which only exceptional evidence coming from peculiarly\n\fLV.] Review. 393\nable and previously trained eye-witnesses should be at all taken\ninto account. To leading members of the S.P.R. this is of course\nno new conclusion ; but for my own part never did I feel more\ninclined to share it than after studying Mr. Carrington's book.\nAfter a few pages on some American celebrities of by-gone days,\nand on Eusapia Paladino and Madame Blavatsky (pp. 3-18) Mr.\nCarrington devotes a whole chapter (pp. 19-47) to a detailed\nexamination of the Slade-Zollner investigation. This he conclu-\nsively and without difficulty shows to have presented many weak\npoints, which in fact are already so well known (see e.g. Podmore's\nModern Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. 190-194) that they need no repeti-\ntion. It is interesting, however, to note in this connection that one\nof Zollner's experiments, or rather observations\u2014the vanishing and\nsubsequent reappearance of a table\u2014Mr. Carrington cannot explain\nwithout having recourse to a visual hallucination as a possible\nexplanation (p. 28). The famous \"knots on an endless cord,\" the\ntwo wooden rings incident and other matters the author seems to\nme to have disposed of very satisfactorily, though his criticisms do\nnot embrace everything Zollner has described (e.g. the appearance\nof knots on two leathern bands, Transcendental Physics, p. 81).\nBut surely Mr. Carrington ought not to include in his negative\nevidence (p. 40) Professor Fullerton's (of the Seybert Commission)\npersonal interviews with Fechner, Scheibner, Weber, and Zollner\nin 1886, since the latter had died four years previously (in 1882).\nMr. Carrington must have glanced too hastily over Professor\nFullerton's account in the \"Seybert Commission's Report,\" pp.\n104-114.\nAfter a chapter on the \"Psychology of Deception \"\n(pp. 48-63),\nillustrating some of the general methods in use with conjurers and\nmediums, the writer proceeds to review the various categories of\nfraudulent \" manifestations \" one after another. We are shown the\ndifferent devices used to produce fraudulent table-lifting (pp. 73-76),\nraps (pp. 77-83), and so finally come to \"slate-writing\" (p. 84).\nAfter briefly mentioning the story of Eglinton's \" psychography\n\"\nversus Mr. S. J. Davey's, Mr. Carrington takes us into all the\nsecrets of the American professional \" slate-writer.\" The number\nof the methods he describes is simply bewildering and the clever-\nness of some of them quite amazing. I will select one instance\nonly (p. 134).\n\"I shall now describe a slate-test in which writing is obtained\nbetween examined and marked slates that are so sealed and fastened\n\f394 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\ntogether that it would be an utter impossibility for the medium to\nopen the slates in the slightest degree. The slates are free from\nwriting or preparation of any kind when they are placed together,\nand they are fastened by the sitter himself after a small piece of\nchalk has been placed between them.\" The sitter then first screws\nthe frames of the slates together, not only at the corners but also\nat other places. He then \" covers the heads of these screws with\nsealing wax, after which he proceeds to fasten or gum the frames\nof the slates together all the way round with strips of sticking\nplaster, securing these in place, and finally sealing the frames together\nin several different places, placing his signet on the seals. If he\nchoose he may glue the wooden frames of the slates together\nalso.\" This operation has probably occupied many minutes ; but after\nthe slates have been held under the table for perhaps a minute,\nand are opened and examined, a \"message\" is found upon the\ninner surface of one of them\u2014to the intense amazement of the\nsitter, and, I may add, of the reader also.\nIn this case, it would appear, the piece of chalk (not slate pencil)\nwhich had been placed between the slates is no ordinary chalk,\nbut is made of a compound of powdered chalk, water, glue, and\niron filings all blended together and allowed to become dry and\nhard. \" When the slates are placed under the table the medium\nextracts from his sleeve or elsewhere a magnet, and with this he\ntraces a series of letters on the under side of the bottom slate in\nmirror writing. The iron filings of the mixture will follow the\nmagnet, and the chalk will write on the slate in the regular manner.\nThe medium locates the piece of chalk in the first instance by\ntipping the slate at an angle so that the chalk will run into one\ncorner. He first of all places the magnet in that corner and drags\nthe bit of chalk to the middle of the slate before proceeding to\nwrite out the message.\" Surely after this, as the French say, il n'y\na plus qu'a tirer Vichelle.\nI have found in this chapter no reference to those few cases\nwhen sitters are alleged to have seen the pencil write at a slate-\n-vvriting seance (the most notable evidence being that of Professor\nElliott Coues and Mr. Emmette Coleman with Mrs. Francis, Eeligio-\nPhilosophical Journal, Feb. 27th, 1892, and M. \"Harry Allis \" with\nSlade, Dr. Gibier's L'Analyse des Choses), but I confess Mr. Carrington's\nexposures are so crushing and his criticisms so destructive that I\n.lack courage to lay much stress on these few enigmatic incidents.\nIn chapter VII. (pp. 1 43-167) we meet with various \"rope-tying\"\n\fi,v.] Review. 395\ntests, past and present, and old acquaintances such as Miss A. E.\nFay and the Davenports (Mr. Carrington has, by the way, unearthed\nan account by Houdin of the Davenports' performances, which,\nextraordinary as it may appear, had escaped the knowledge of so\nwide a reader as Mr. Podmore) ; in chapter VIII., with such things\nas \"spirit-posts,\" \"spirit-sacks and handcuffs\" (pp. 168-185); and\nperfectly dazed with the writer's extraordinary and sometimes, I\nconfess, hardly credible revelations of what trickery alone can do,\nwe come to \"holding tests\" (p. 186). This chapter is of peculiar\ninterest to me ; the reader will presently see why.\nMr. Carrington shows the various ways in which the medium or\nconjurer can manage to get one hand free :\n(a) When hands are joined round the table and in mutual contact\nthrough each sitter's little fingers.\n(h) When the sitter's hands are in contact soi-disant with the two\nhands of the medium, he (or she) substituting, in fact, one of his\n(or her) hands for two (turning it so as to lie across the sitter's\ntwo hands).\n(c) When the sitter who is on the medium's right-hand side\ngrasps his right wrist, while the medium himself grasps the left-hand\nsitter's wrist.\n(d) When two \" investigators \" and the medium are sitting side\nby side, under cover of a curtain pinned across them and attached\njust helow their necks\u2014the medium pretending to grasp his\nneighbour's arm with both hands, whilst managing, in fact, to get\none hand free. 1\nSuch are, according to Mr. Carrington, the main methods of \" hand-\nholding\" which permit \"escape.\" But I have not found in this chapter\n(or in others) any evidence showing me that a medium can get his\nhand free when both of them are securely held by the sitters in the\nproper sense of the word. In fact, it is obvious that this method of\ncontrol is evaded by the profession.\n1\nTo do this \" sometimes . . . the medium has concealed in his right hand\na piece of sheet lead about two inches square,\" which when \"he places his\nright hand over the arm of the sitter he simply bends . . . round the arm of\nhis victim, and he is then free to remove his hand at any time without fear\nof detection.\" And to make the illusion of continued contact quite perfect\n\"a further improvement was made. A spring clasp was used to each end of\nwhich was soldered a pox-tion of a hand, the thumb on one end and the four\nfingers on the other. These were made of rubber, and when the spring clip\nwas opened and the fingers and thumb clasped on opposite sides of the arm,\nthe illusion was perfect\" (p. 195). Truly one stands aghast at such cleverness.\n\f396 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nNow at the seances of Stepan Sambor, a Russian professional\nphysical medium who died some years ago, his hands were almost\ninvariably held, i.e. grasped in such a way as to make release in any\nof the ways suggested by Mr. Carrington impossible. And never did\nSambor in my experience object to this kind of holding.\nAnd yet I undoubtedly did in the course of my 105 sittings with\nhim observe things which could be explained only on the supposition\nthat one of his hands had been released and which no machinery of\nany kind nor collusion would do. I refer chiefly to incidents which\nseemed to indicate \"passage of matter through matter,\" such as\nchairs being threaded on the medium's arm without his hands having\nbeen (apparently) released for a second.\nApart from this, the very fact of a professional medium allowing\nfrom the very beginning and throughout his career this method of\ncontrol (which seems to be so carefully avoided by his colleagues,\nnot excepting the most famous, such as Eusapia) affords in my eyes\nto a certain extent the presumption that he may have possessed some\nauthentic \"power\" after all.\nTo return to Sambor's \"chair-threading.\" I made a special study\nof it at the time and described my experiments in detail in the\nAnnales des Sciences Psychiques for 1900 and 1902, and elsewhere; and\nthough were I now to rewrite those articles of mine they would\nassume quite a different appearance, the fact remains that, under\nvery good conditions of hand-holding, we repeatedly and with different\nsitters did witness this curious fact\u2014of the medium's arm getting in\nsome mysterious way inside the opening in the back of a chair (not\nhis own) when his neighbours were perfectly convinced they had not\nreleased his hands for a quarter of a second.\nSo much remains to my mind unshaken to the present day. And\nbefore believing that trickery, in the usual sense of the word, was\npossible under those conditions, I shall require an undoubted conjurer\nto do the same thing for me. Until this is done, \\ prefer to admit\nthat some kind of suggestion was at work, \u2014suggestion not expressed\nin words, and perhaps even unconsciously exerted by the \"entranced\"\nmedium. 1\n1\nThis conclusion seems to me decidedly supported by some isolated incidents\nconnected with these curious chair experiments and which would point to tactile\nhallucinations more or less induced at the very least. Here is one such case.\nMme. Yudenitch, a lady spiritualist personally known to me, writes to me on\nMarch 11\/24, 1904 :\n\"As for the chair it happened thus : I was sitting next to the medium when\nsuddenly the chairs were pulled away from under me, the medium, and the\n\fLV.] Review. 397\nSo much to show that even Mr. Carrington fails to explain every-\nthing.\nIn chapters X.-XIV. (pp. 206-276), dealing with \"spirit-photo-\ngraphy \" and materialisation, we still have the same unending tale\nof gruesome fraud all along the line. A few pages (pp. 224-230) on\n\" paraffin mould-tests \" should be read in connection with the chapters\nin M. Aksakoffs Animismus unci Spiritism\/US, devoted to the same\nsubject. Of a well-known case to which M. Aksakoff (unfortunately,\nI think) attached his name, Mr. Carrington very satisfactorily disposes.\nIt is the famous incident of the \" dematerialisation \" of Mrs. D'Esper\nance's legs at Helsingfors in 1893. Mr. Carrington conclusively shows\nthat this \"phenomenon\" admits of an absurdly easy explanation\n(pp. 235-236 ; see also Proceedings of the American S.P.R., Vol. I,\nPart I., pp. 131-168), and thus leaves it literally without a leg to\nstand upon.\nMethods used in simulating \"gradual materialisation,\" as if from\nthe floor, are described (pp. 257, 258), also various ways of smuggling\n\" spirit-clothes \" into the cabinet. Much stress is sometimes laid by\nspiritualists on accounts of test seances for materialisation at which\n\"forms\" dressed in white flowing robes appeared after the medium\nhimself (or herself) had been subjected to a thorough searching.\nWhen one reads, however, that these \" robes \" are made of such fine\nmaterial as to find room in a dummy watch, a purse, a letter, or even\nin a hollow boot heel (p. 250), one may be excused for not attaching\nundue importance to such \" searchings.\"\nIt should be noted, however, that Mr. Carrington thinks it\n\" conceivable that such a thing as genuine materialisation exists as\na fact in nature\" (p. 237), and refers in this connection to Sir W.\nCrookes's experiments with D. D. Home, and even to M. Charles\nRichet's recent sittings at Algiers, which he thinks \"most extra-\nordinary ; \" why, he does not explain, since, apart from the name of\nthe chief witness, the sittings in question do not seem to have\ngentleman who was sitting on his other side, so that we had to get up, and the\nchairs behind us were somewhat moved about ; then the medium began to move\naside his hand, together with mine, and at this moment I felt one chair hanging\non my arm and so stated to those present, who advised me to [bring the lower\npart of my arm close to the upper part]. I had hardly done so when a second\nchair appeared on the same arm (the feeling was as if my arm had been lightly\nstruck with a wooden object). Having squeezed both chairs I experienced the\nstrange feeling as if their backs, which were upon my arm, had parted in two, and\nthen [the chairs] fell on the floor at once, thus freeing my arm.\"\nCurious, is it not ? And this is not an altogether unique experience.\n\f398 Co ant Perovsky -Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\npresented anything exceptional so far as \"conditions\" were con-\ncerned, and, as is well known, many suspicious circumstances have\ntranspired since.\nThe three following chapters, ending Part I., on \" Sealed letter-\nreading,\" \"Mind-reading performances,\" and \"Trance and test-\nseances,\" are, strictly speaking, out of place in a book devoted to\n\" physical phenomena,\" but with this reservation are nevertheless\namong the most instructive. In the first of these we see again\nthat seemingly the most perfect \"tests\" almost invariably fall an\neasy prey to the medium's cunning. This never-ending tale of\nprecautions baffled, however elaborate and ingenious, ends by pro-\nducing on the disheartened reader's mind an impression of perfect\nhopelessness. What : if such \" conditions \" and \" tests \" are of no\navail, can any experiments be of any use 1 Scepticism in answer to\nthis question is legitimate. But before one has had time to pause\nand consider a possible solution, Mr. Carrington takes us two steps\nfurther into the same extraordinarily fertile though unwholesome\nregion. In the chapter on mind-reading performances (291-311),\nafter a few pages on genuine \" muscle-reading,\" we are treated to an\nexposure of the methods used by professional mind-readers on the\npublic stage ; and here I stand bewildered again. Let the reader\nconsider, for instance, the following passage (p. 305)\n:\n\" I next give a very clever test, in which the assistant stands in\nfront of a black-board, with chalk in her hands, and writes upon\nthe board whatever number, date, card, etc., is whispered into the\nperformer's ear when he is amongst the audience, not a word being\nspoken throughout this test, and it is obvious that there is no\ncommunication of any sort between performer and assistant. The\nperformer moves freely amongst the audience, the only condition\nrequired being that absolute silence be maintained.\"\nIn such performances, it appears \" the assistant upon the stage\nbreathes deeply and regularly, so that the performer can see the\nmovement of her shoulders from where he stands, care being taken\nhowever not to overdo this part of the performance and render the\nmovement noticeable to any person in the audience. The performer-\nstarts his assistant by making some slight noise, and from that\ninstant the silent counting begins. . . . After she (the assistant)\nhas counted up to a certain number, the number required (i.e. after\nshe has taken that number of breaths), the performer interrupts\nher breathing, and the assistant knows the number to place upon\nthe board. The counting then begins again from the moment the\n\fLV.] Review. 399\nsound of chalk ceases to mark the blackboard \u2014the performer again\ninterrupting the breathing at the next number or letter, as the case\nmay. be, by again making a slight sound or movement. This\nprocess is continued until the whole message is communicated, thu\nassistant writing down each word or figure in turn, no word being\nspoken throughout the entire performance.\"\nBut it appears that there is another method also\u2014and even far\nsuperior. \" Instead of the breathing being necessary, the performer\nand his assistant have substituted a method of counting mentally and\ntogether. It is a known fact that the beats for common time are\nalways the same in music, therefore, with little practice, it is easy\nfor two persons starting on a given signal to count at the same\ntime and rate, and when another signal is given to stop, and of\ncourse they will both have arrived at the same number. The\nperformer and his assistant count together mentally until they are\nsure that they both count in exactly the same time, when the\nhardest portion of this method will have been overcome. The\nsignals of when to stop and when to commence have now to be\nlearned. . . . Suppose the date of a coin is to be trans-\nmitted. It is generally understood that most coins begin with\nthe figure 1, and that much may be taken for granted. The\nperformer stands up at the blackboard, his assistant being at the\nopposite side of the stage and awaits her replies. She begins\n:\n'The first figure I see is a 1.' From the instant she has ceased\nspeaking, both she and the performer begin counting together.\nSuppose the next number is an 8. The performer waits until he\n(and, consequently, his assistant) has mentally counted eight breaths\nbefore he marks upon the board, when he writes the figure 1 as\ndirected. The assistant now knows that the next number is eight,\nand so states. Before marking down the 8, however, the performer\nwaits until they have both counted up to the next number on the\ncoin, say 9. After mentally counting nine, then, the performer\nwrites down the 8 previously given, and the assistant hearing the\nsound of the chalk knows the number next in order, and so on\nindefinitely. Both performer and his assistant keep just '\none\nahead ' throughout : the sound of the chalk on the blackboard being\nthe signal for when to stop and when to commence\" (pp. 306-7).\nSlight variations of the method will do for numbers on bank-\nnotes, etc.\nIn the chapter on \"Trance, test seances,\" etc., ending Part I.,\nwe read (pp. 312-318) of the various devices used to get information\n\f400 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nabout personal matters connected with possible sitters ; of\n\" brotherhoods \" of mediums, each member of those organisations\nbinding himself to turn into the \"public fund\" any information he\nmay obtain about sitters, their deceased friends and relatives; of\n\"Blue Books\" (containing as many as seven thousand names for one\ntown alone) circulated in great secrecy among members of these\nbrotherhoods, etc.\nPart II. of Mr. Carrington's book we can, unfortunately, go\nthrough much quicker. Believing, as he does, that there may be\nin nature some genuine mediumistic physical phenomena after all\n(and he again, I fail to understand why, includes \" trance \" and\nMrs. Piper in this category), Mr. Carrington proceeds to give us\nspecimens of cases of \" raps,\" \" telekinesis,\" and the like, which he\nthinks convincing (pp. 340-371). He will permit me to say that I\ndo not consider his lists altogether satisfactory. All references\nto Jacolliot's experiments with his fakir I would have omitted\naltogether. Then there is Sir William Crookes and his statements\non the various raps he observed with Mrs. Fox-Jencken. These\npassages have already been quoted ad nauseam, and reproduced as\nthey are without any further additional details, in view again of\nall the various \"incidents\" which have occurred since Sir William\nwrote the lines in question (some 35 years ago), these brief state-\nments, even from so high an authority, carry now to the mind\nlittle conviction. Such is at least my impression. On the other\nhand, M. Maxwell's cases quoted on pp. 342-345 are distinctly very\ngood\u2014or at least some of them are \u2014and look encouraging. We\nwant only more of such experiments, but I am afraid a good man}'\nmore, to settle the question in the affirmative\u2014and it would be\nonce for all !\nI regret to note that in the chapter on \" telekinesis \" we meet\n(p. 364) Jacolliot and Covindasamy again, but we see no reference\neither to Count de Gasparin and Professor Thury, to Sub-\nCommittee Number I. of the London Dialectical Society, or to Dr.\nDariex's excellent case (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VII., pp. 194-198).\nTurning to D. D. Home (p. 372), Mr. Carrington begins by\nasserting somewhat too emphatically, I am afraid, that fraud was\nnever detected at any of Home's seances, \" nor was it even\nsuspected (!) on any occasion,\" also that \"he insisted upon as much\nlight as possible on all occasions.\" We are also told a little further\non that Sir William Crookes's accordion tests took place \"in full\nlight\" (p. 376). Such inaccuracies are distinctly unpleasant to meet\n\fLV.] Review. 401\nwith in a scientific work like Mr. Carrington's. I strongly suspect\nthat the amount of light admitted at most of Home's seances was\npoor, and I beg to refer Mr. Carrington in this connection to\nsome passages in Sir. W. Crookes's \"Notes of seances with D. D.\nHome\" in Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI., pp. 98-127. I also think that\nthose who have had a large experience of seances, especially \" light\n\"\nones, will agree with me that at a certain point too little light may\nbe worse, so far as observation is concerned, than unpretentious\ndarkness! Suspicious circumstances were undoubtedly observed at\nHome's seances (see Mr. Merrifield's evidence in S.P.R. Journal, May,\n1903, pp. 76-78, and compare his account of the seance in question\nwith the author's description of some feats of Monck's on\npp. 246-24 7). In saying this, I distinctly repudiate all idea of\ncasting doubt on the whole of Home's phenomena, but merely wish\nto protest against unnecessary exaggerations.\nThere is one of Home's manifestations which I have long thought\nto be one of the most enigmatic of all, not less perhaps than the\n\"elongations,\" \" levitations,\" and \"fire-tests\" which Mr. Carrington\ndiscusses at some length, and yet there is no reference to it in his\nchapter on Home at all, though he just mentions it elsewhere\n(p. 237) when speaking of the possibility of genuine materialisation.\nIt is the fact recorded by many observers (Sir W. Crookes and\nCount Alexis Tolstoy, a distinguished Russian writer and poet,\namong many others) of the gradual melting away of the \" spirit-\nhands \" in the sitter's hand when grasped. I do not believe that\nsuch a feat has ever been attempted by conjurers (no trace of\nanything of the kind is to be found at any rate in Mr. Carrington's\nwork), and, until this is done, I think that prima facie there is in\nthis evidence for something \"supernormal.\" Tactile hallucination\nis, of course, not excluded in such cases, but the very fact of the\ninducing of such tactile hallucinations with different observers not\nhypnotised is very interesting ; and when we read of the undoubtedly\nobjective movements of objects performed by apparently similar\n\"spirit-hands\" at Home's sittings on other occasions, we see\nthat the hallucination theory itself becomes a trifle more complicated.\nIt should be added that Mr. Carrington repudiates this theory as\napplied to Home's manifestations (p. 393).\nWith Mrs. Piper (two pages only in chapter XXII.) I will not\nconcern myself, merely taking the liberty of reminding the reader\nthat the reflections and criticisms suggested to me by this famous\ncase in my \"Appendix\" to my Russian translation of Mr. Podmore's\n\f402 Count Peruvsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\n\" Modern Spiritualism \" were excellently summarized by Dr. Leaf\nin Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIX., pp. 402-404.\nBefore concluding, I wish to emphasise my conviction of the very\ngreat usefulness and practical importance to \"Psychical Research\"\nof Mr. Carrington's work\u2014or rather of the first part of it. As an\nexposer of conjuring and \" mediumistic \" devices he in my opinion\nstands unsurpassed, and there can be no doubt that his volume\nhas dealt professional mediumship a most sensible, I should perhaps\nsay a crushing, blow. It is true that the corporation has already\nsustained many blows, and shows no sign of finally quitting the\npublic stage. Human credulity (with special reference to Spiritualistic\ncredulity) is in fact unfathomable, and will, I am afraid, always\nprove so. But surely after closing the Physical Phenomena of\nSpiritualism, one can hardly resist the conclusion that the case for\nsuch phenomena, as produced by American professional mediums of\nthe present day, is almost hopeless.\nBut physicians are not justified in leaving without examination\nand help a patient reputed or even positively known to be in a\nhopeless state. And it seems to me that Psychical Researchers are\nprecisely in the physicians' position. As researchers they are bound\nto investigate and study, even when there is very little chance of\ntheir getting anything on the positive side. If they refuse, they\ncease to be Psychical Researchers. I do not mean by this that any\none who claims to be a materialising or slate-writing medium has\na right to the Society's attention. Surely not. But I think that\nto leave without examination all the \" manifestations \" of professional\nmediums because a great many of them were exposed at one time\nor another, would not be a wise policy. Of course, only evidence\ncoming from specially qualified persons should be given a serious\nhearing.\nAnd now may I be allowed a short digression \u2014personal but not\nwithout general interest'*\nThere is one source of possible error in the same region to which\nMr. Carrington has hardly referred, I think, in his book and to\nwhich I wish to call the reader's attention. It is practical joking,\nof very bad taste no doubt, on the part of one or other of the sitters.\nI emphasise : it is anonymous practical joking, merely for the fun\nof the thing\u2014which may, in fact, remain unknown to the medium,\n\u2014\nhe not being in conscious collusion. It seems to me quite possible\nthat such a hypothesis may account for more than one \"mediumistic\"\nmystery.\n\fLY.] Review. 403\nFor my own part I am inclined to think, alas ! that such is the\nprosaic cause of some of the best things I saw some years ago with\nSambor, and later on with three non-professional mediums, including\nLuba Morosoff, the \" Vladikavkaz girl,\" whose (Poltergeist) phenomena\ncreated a certain stir in the Russian press in the spring of ] 904.\nFor among the manifestations which I then observed there were\nseveral which the medium could hardly have produced unaided, and\nthere was at least one with which she absolutely could not have\nbeen concerned : a Greek tenth century (I think) coin of unknown\norigin suddenly falling down on the floor in my study (where we\nhad just been sitting) when Luba Morosoff was in a different part\nof the lodgings. Previous preparation a la Meb (Podmore's Modern\nSpiritualism, Vol. II., p. 324), was absolutely out of the question.\nIt should be added that in all these cases the \"circle\" was not a\npromiscuous one, but more or less formed by myself and composed\nof persons seriously interested, of good social or official position,\nsome of them sufficiently sceptical ; a very good circle indeed, which\nseemed to offer every guarantee.\nAnd yet a terrible suspicion entered then and still remains in my\nmind that a certain member of this circle (very well known to me,\nand with whom I have long been on the best of terms), a very\npleasant, intelligent and gifted gentleman, did simply dupe us\nsystematically and throughout.\nMy suspicions (shared by several other members of the circle)\nwere aroused first of all by the fact that our seances were remark-\nably successful if M. X. was present (and sitting close to the\nmedium) and were dismal failures when he was absent. By a pro-\ncess of elimination and comparison we soon arrived at the conviction\nthat we could not suspect any one else. And after the Greek coin\nincident our suspicions grew so irresistible that I thought it best\nnot to conceal them from X. himself.\nI do not wish to minimise the fact either that he did not appear\nparticularly astonished or offended at my question, or that he gave\nme repeatedly and apparently without any hesitation his word of\nhonour that neither at this nor at any other seance did he ever\ncheat us.\nThis of course precluded all further discussion. Our mediums\nvanished from the scene, and here the matter stands to the present\nday. We have no positive proof that X. did deceive us ; we have\nonly somewhat suspicious circumstances (both the one I have men-\ntioned and others of later origin, but, I repeat, not decisive). Socially\n\f404 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part lv.]\nspeaking, I have no right whatever to doubt his word. And so i\nought to have no other alternative but to swallow almost every variety\nof \"physical phenomena\" vouched for by Spiritualists, including\n\" apports \" which were of especial frequency. And yet, with all due\nrespect to X., I hesitate, and so do still other members of the circle.\nBut see what this practically, and independently of the question\nwhether X. told me the truth or not, amounts to. For years I had\npursued my investigations, always hoping to see at last something\nwhich the medium absolutely could not have simulated. There was\ngenerally a loop-hole. At last I seemed to have got what I wanted.\nIn my own trusted circle, under very good conditions, I observed\n\"manifestations,\" some of which seemed really and truly out of the\nmedium's reach. But it was only to find myself in face of an\naltogether new problem. My suspicions as to the part played by X.\nmay be unfounded after all. But, alas ! so far as my personal con-\nviction is concerned, nearly everything\u2014Sambor's chairs excepted\n\u2014\nhas to be begun anew. This is the sad moral of the story.\nAnother remark, and a last one. Let it be noted that if X, did\ndupe us, our suspicions were aroused chiefly because he overdid his\npart. If he had confined himself to movements of objects and\n\"touches,\" we should not have suspected foul play, provided that\nthe medium could not have done such things himself. It was chiefly\nthe stream of \"apports\" that we could not withstand. Otherwise\neverything would have gone on quite smoothly, and we should have\nenjoyed to the present day the bliss of belief. Let possible practical\njokers remember this !\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\n\fPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nPART LVI.\nFebruary, 1909.\nT.\nTHE ALLEGED MIRACULOUS HAILSTONES OF\nEEMIREMONT.\nBy M. Sage.\n[The events described in this paper took place on May 26 th,\n1907. They seem to have attracted but little notice at the\ntime, and it was not until the early part of the year 1908\nthat any information about them reached us. Later, a foreign\nmember of the Society drew our attention to a more detailed\naccount in La Croix, and kindly offered to pay the expenses\nof whatever investigation into the matter might then be found\npossible.\nWe were fortunate in being able to secure the services of\none of our Honorary Associates, Monsieur M. Sage, who visited\nEemiremont in September, 1908, and spent some time there\ncollecting information and evidence. We give below his Eeport\non the case, together with the documentary evidence which he\nobtained.\n\u2014\nEd.]\nVoici le compte-rendu, aussi exact cpie possible et d'apres les\nnotes prises au moment meme, de l'enquete qu'au nom de la\nSociete vous m'avez demande de faire a Eemiremont, sous-\n\f406 M.

Sa valeur artistique est\nmediocre a. mes yeux, mais je suis sur ce point tout a, fait\nincompetent. En tout cas on ne peut apprecier que la tete\nde la mere et celle de l'enfant, car tout le restant des deux\ncorps, s'il existe, est recouvert d'un vetement triangulaire en\netoffe rayee d'or. Depuis mai 1907 la tete de la madone\nest surmontee d'un diademe. L'ensemble me rappelle quelque\nantique idole on quelque icone byzantine. Les lignes de l'image,\nen tout cas, sont tres simples\n:\n1\nc'est la un detail qu'il faut\navoir present a l'esprit pour cornprendre comment a pu se\nformer l'illusion qui va nous occuper.\nD'apres l'histoire ou la legende, cette statue fut donnee par\nCharlemagne, a son retour dTtalie, a un couvent de femmes\nsitue\" sur une montagne (le Saint-Mont) au sud-est et non loin\nde l'emplacement actuel de Eemiremont. Le 13 aout 910,\nles religieuses, fuyant devant les Huns, vinrent s'installer dans\nla bourgade, berceau du Eemiremont actuel, emportant la statue\nentre autres. Dans la conversation que j'ai eue avec Mr\nle\ncurd de Etienne, celui-ci a remarque que la grele, miracu-\nleuse a. ses yeux, de 1907 avait suivi le meme trajet que\nN.-D. du Tresor, lors de son transferement en 910; il y voyait\nune preuve de plus que cette grele etait surnaturelle : c'est\npeut-etre abuser un peu du droit qu'a chacun de nous de faire\ndes rapprochements. (Lire a ce propos sa deposition.)\nDepuis les origines jusqua nos jours le peuple de Eemire-\nmont et des environs croit que N.-D. du Tresor a le pouvoir\nd'arreter les catamite's, telles qu'incendies ou tremblements de\nterre, ou plus simplement de faire pleuvoir quand la secheresse\nse prolonge, ou de ramener le soleil quand la pluie tombe\n1\nVoir la medaille jointe au present compte-rendu (Fig. 1).

Pendant plusieurs jours le peuple campa au\nmilieu des prairies.

(Voir la. Notice historique,\npages 415-6.)\nDepuis lors cette procession, dite du Tremblement, a eu lieu\ntous les ans.\nLe cure actuel de Eemiremont, Mr\nl'archipretre Vuillemin,\na toujours eu une devotion profonde pour la inadone du pays.\n\" Oui, monsieur, je l'aime beaucoup,\" m'a-t-il dit k moi-meme.\nSon vceu le plus cher fut toujours d'en obtenir le couronnement.\nCertes, il serait facile de gloser la-dessus et sur beaucoup\nd'autres details de l'histoire que je raconte : un esprit scienti-\nfique tombe d'etonnement en stupefaction. Mais il convient ici\nde constater et non pas de s'abandonner a de faciles ironies.\nEn France, et dans d'autres pays aussi sans doute, les manifes-\ntations de I'esprit religieux sont souvent, beaucoup trop souvent,\ndignes du fetichisme le plus grossier.\nEnfin S.S. Pie X, comblant les vceux de Mr\nl'abb6\nVuillemin, ordonna le Couronnement ofnciel et liturgique de\nN.-D. du Tresor. \" On entcnd par la, disait le Rulletin\nParoissial de Eemiremont, facte par lequel le Souverain Pontife,\na la prttrc qui lux est adressie, be'nit et impose, par un de'Ugue'\nspecial, une riche couronne a une statue vSne'rable.\"\n\f408 M.

Ce dernier, connu pour sa combativite, etait alors\ndans les plus mauvais termes avec le gouvernement de la\nEepublique. Enfin Mr\nl'abbe Vuillemin avait fait reporter,\ntoujours dans le but de donner plus d'eclat aux fetes, la\nProcession du Tremblement, k cette meme date du 20 mai 1907.\nMais le Conseil Municipal craignit des troubles dans la rue,\nles partis clerical et anticlerical 6tant tres montes l'un contre\nl'autre ; et par un arrete en date du 13 mai 1907, il defendit\nla Procession. (Voir le resume\" des motifs de l'interdiction qui\nm'a ete remis par Mr\nle secretaire de la mairie de Itemiremont,\ndocument N\u00b0 2.) Grande colere au camp des clericaux ! La\nprocession ne put avoir lieu qu'a, l'interieur de l'eglise.\nPour se rendre compte de l'6tat des esprits, il faut lire le\nDiscours prononcS dans l'eglise de Itemiremont a I'occasion du\nCouronnemcnt de N.-D. du Tre'sor, -par Mr\nVahbS Rollin.

Un orage survient\nvers le soir, accompagne de grele. Je ne m'attarderai pas a\ndecrire cette grele : on en trouvera plusieurs descriptions, a peu\npres concordantes, dans les documents annexes au present compte-\nrendu.

L'orage enfin se termine par une troisieme grele, dont\nles grelons sont extraordinaires par leur grosseur, leur forme et\nleur maniere de tomber. Beaucoup ont la grosseur d'un ceuf\ncle poule ; ils sont ovoides et plats sur une de leurs faces ; ils\ntombent lentement, lourdement et a distance les tons des autres\n\"\n(op. cit. page 86).\nCeux qui croient aux grelons miraculeux aiment a insister\nsur deux points.

Petits\ncommerc;.ants, ouvriei's ou paysans, ils sont tous sans la plus\nlegere teinte d'(3ducation scientifique, et pas un n'est capable\nmeme de concevoir qu'il faut se defier cle nos sensations,\nlesquelles sont souvent trompeuses. \"J'ai vu, vous disent-ils,\ndouteriez-vous de ce que j'ai vu ?\n\" Si vous repondiez \" oui,\"\nils vous considc^reraient non seulement comme tres impoli,\nmais surtout comme affiige d'une systematique mauvaise foi.\n\flvl] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 413\nOr, alors qu'en pareille matiere, l'affirmation d'hommes\nrompus a, l'observation exacte ne vaudrait pas grand'chose en\nl'absence de toute trace materielle, que pent valoir raffirmation\nd'un concierge, d'un paysan, d'une femme ou d'un enfant ?\nSurtout quand ils sont sous l'evidente influence d'une passion\nprofonde ? Aucun n'eut meme VicUe de pliotographier un grSlon.\nPassons-les en revue\n:\n(1) Mr\nl'abbe Minod m'a communique sous sa signature la\ndeposition d'un des temoins qui ne veut pas etre nomine\n(document N\u00b0 7).\n(2) Mme\nJeangeorge m'a donne son attestation en l'absence\nde son mari.

Ces temoins\nsont assurement tous de bonne foi, mais, rep^tons-le, de qualite\nmediocre. Dans le camp oppose on n'a pas d'opinion, on n'a\nrien vu.\n\f414 M. Sage. [part\nCependant la maniere de voir de ce camp a et6 tres bien\nexposee par Mr\nUnger, secretaire de la mairie de Remiremont,\ndans une lettre qu'il ^crivit en reponse a un litterateur\nhollandais (dont j'ai eu l'^tourderie de ne pas prendre le\nnom) lequel, composant un ouvrage sur la Valeur du\nTemoignage humain, a sollicite des eclaircissements aupres de\nla mairie. Le maire signa cette reponse. J'esperais qu'il en\nferait autant pour la copie textuelle que j'en ai prise, mais\nil s'y est refuse sans que j'aie pu m'en expliquer le motif.\nJe garantis quant a moi ne pas y avoir change un mot\n(document N\u00b0 17).\nLe frere du secretaire de la mairie, M1\"\nGeorges Unger,\nqui etait present au moment de la grele, a bien voulu me\ndonner son attestation ecrite (document N\u00b0 18). Get homme\nest eclaire, calme, sans passion, et son temoignage a une tres\ngrande valeur.\nLa presse naturellement s'est beaucoup occupee de cette\naffaire. L'Ind4pendance de VEst, un journal anti-clerical, accusa\nMr\nl'archipretre Vuillemin d'avoir machine tout cela pour\ngagner de l'argent. C'etait assurement une calomnie ; en tout\ncas rien ne prouve cette machination. Quant a moi je ne\ncrois pas Mr\nVuillemin capable d'un aussi bas calcul. Sa\nfoi est puerile, mais elle est sincere. L'lnddpendance de VEst,\nd'abord acquittee k Bar-le-Duc, a ete le'gerement condamnee\nen appel (voir les coupures de journaux annexees au present\nrapport, avec les autres documents).\nEnfin il semblerait qu'une grele analogue k celle de\nEemiremont est tombee le 2 juillet 1908 a Bagnols, dans le\nVar. Le nombre des temoins, toutefois, n'est que de trois.\nUne enquete a ete\n-\nfaite, sur l'ordre de l'eveque, le 13 juillet\n1908.

Elle massacre les verandahs, brise les carreaux, mais,\nchose singuliere ! elle respecte les legumes et les fleurs des jardins.\nL'orage enfin se termine par une troisieme grele, dont les grelons\nsont extraordinaires par leur grosseur, leur forme et leur maniere de\ntomber. Beaucoup ont la grosseur d'un ceuf de poule ; ils sont\novoides et plats sur une de leurs faces ; ils tombent lentement,\nlourdement et a distance les uns des autres.\nA 6 h. 1\/1 l'orage 6tait termine et le ciel reprenait sa ser6nite.\nBientot on chuchote en ville une rumeur etrange\n:\n\" Notre-Dame du TrSsor, disait-on, a eu sa procession! . . .

II nous laisse\nen face du temoignage de plus de Cent personnes qui, sous la foi du\nserment, affirment avoir vu l'image de Notre-Dame du Tresor dans\nles grelons qu'ils ont eus entre les mains et sous les yeux.\nQue faut-il penser de leurs constatations 1 L'empreinte de la\nMadone etait-elle dans leur imagination seulement, ou en realite\nsur les grelons nommes grelons-medailles, parce qu'ils portaient,\ncomme les medailles du Couronnement, l'image de Notre-Dame du\nTresor 1\nCette question a une importance capitale : la est le nceud de\nl'enquete. Elle devait done porter surtout son controle sur la\nvaleur des constatations, de maniere a ecarter Yillusion et la\nsuggestion et a mettre ainsi dans un relief saisissant l'autbenticite\nde nos grelons.\nEn voici les resultats\n:\n1\u00b0\/ Les constatations ont ete simultanees, concordantes et precises.\n\f420 M. Sage. [part\nElles out eu lieu en mime temps, le meme jour et a la meme\nheure, vers 6 heures du soir, sans que Ton puisse dire quelle a ete\nla premiere.\nElles sont concordantes : toutes affirment la presence de l'image de\nNotre-Dame du Tresor sur les grelons. Les divergences qu'elles\npresentent ne portent que sur des d6tails et sont imputables a l'etat\ndes grelons au moment oil se sont faites les constatations.\nElles sont enfin d'une precision remarquable. Ce n'est pas une\nforme vague que les temoins ont vue, mais une effigie absolument\nnette, minutieusement detaillee et rigoureusement conforme a la\nmedaille frappee en souvenir du Couronnement.\n2\u00b0\/ Les constatations ont eu lieu a plus de vingt endroits diffe-\nrents, eloignes les uns des autres de plusieurs centaines de metres,\net meme de plus d'un kilometre, comme Saint-Etienne, Moulins,\ncommune de Saint-Nabord.\n3\u00b0\/ Elles se produisent a peu pres toutes de la meme maniere.\nLa curiosite les provoque et, a chaque endroit, le premier t6moin du\nfait extraordinaire en est tellement stup6fait d'abord, puis ravi, qu'il\ns'empresse d'eu faire part a son entourage, soit pour lui faire partager\nsa joie, soit pour s'assurer qu'il ne s'est pas trompe, de sorte que\ndans chaque centre de constatations il y a de deux a neuf temoins\nqui se controlent eux memes.\nPlusieurs ajoutent a ce controle la confrontation des medailles\nqu'ils portent sur eux avec celle des grelons : leur similitude est\nparfaite. En meme temps, ils ecartent les grelons sur lesquels ils ne\nvoient rien : tons, en effet, n'avaient pas l'image de la Madone.\n4\u00b0\/ Les constatations ont enfin pour resultat de produire imme-\ndiatement, dans l'ame des temoins, une conviction intime, profonde\net indestructible.\nVous avez entendu, Monseigneur, quelques depositions et Votre\nGrandeur sait avec quelle chaleur de conviction elles ont ete faites :\n\" Je donnerais tous mes membres \" disait l'un, et \" jusqu'a la\nderniere goutte de mon sang\" disait un autre, \" plutot cpie de dire\nque Notre-Dame du Tresor n'etait pas sur les grelons et que je ne\nl'ai pas vue.\"\nJ'ajoute deux faits, car l'exemple sera toujours la voie la plus\nrapide et la plus sure pour saisir la verit6.\nA Saint-Etienne, Mm0\nAndre, mere de famille, etait chez elle\npendant l'orage de la Trinite. Son mari, instituteur en retraite, etait\nabsent : il assistait a une seance de patronage. Poussee par une\ncuriosite bien legitime, elle ramasse quelques grelons qui la frappent\n\flvi.] The Alleged Miraculous Hailstones of Remiremont. 421\nle plus par leur grosseur et par leur forme. La voila saisie et pro-\nfondement emue : C'est l'image de Notre-Dame du Tr6sor qu'elle\nvoit d'une facon tres distincte.\nEn bonne epouse, elle pense immediatement a son mari qui doit\nrevenir a la maison dans quelques instants, et au lieu de jouir en\nego'iste du spectacle touchant et extraordinaire qu'elle a sous les\nyeux, elle cherche le moyen de retarder la fonte de ses precieux\ngr 61 ons.\nElle y reussit. De retour au foyer, son mari les voit et les\nexamine. II est stupefait. Sa femme ne s'etait pas trompee, il le\nconstate avec joie.\nEn paroissien bien avise :\n\" Marie, dit-il alors a l'une de ses filles,\nil faut porter ces grelons a M. le Cure.\"\nCelle-ci obeit. L'accueil fut plus que froid. Le pasteur ne voulut\nd'abord nj rien entendre, ni rien voir. Sur les instances reiterees,\ntres pressantes de sa paroissienne qui lui pr6sente les grelons, il se\nresigne enfin a abaisser les yeux. Ties etonne de ce qu'il voit, il a\nrecours a ses lunettes pour mieux s'assurer de la realite de l'image\nde Notre-Dame du Tresor. L'heureux cure est anjourd'hui l'un des\napotres les plus ardents des grelons-medailles.\nA Remiremont, Alcide Jeangeorge, age de 44 ans, et Marie-Clarisse\nParmentier, son epouse, agee de 39 ans, avaient loue un lot de\nterrain dans les jardins ouvriers. Voyant tomber la grele avec fracas,\nils sont desoles en songeant a leurs legumes. L'orage passe, ils s'en\nvont tristement voir s'il en reste quelque chose. Quel n'est pas\nleur etonnement de voir d'une part que leur jardin n'a pas de mal\net d'autre part que les allees sont couvertes de grelons ! Ils en\nramassent quelques-uns : ils y voient l'image de Notre-Dame du\nTresor bien marquee avec l'Enfant-Jesus, la couronne et la robe.\nEn s'en retournant chez eux, ils trouvent sur le bord du canal\nde l'Est des grelons bien conserves, ils en ramassent aussi plusieurs\noil l'image de la Vierge est parfaitement visible.\nMme\nJeangeorge a l'idee d'en emporter dans son tablier pour les\nmontrer a des parents qui se trouvent sur leur chemin, au Rang-\nSen6clial. On compare aux medailles que Ton a sur soi les grelons\nqu'on a sous les yeux : la ressemblance est parfaite.\nVoila deux faits : je pourrais en ajouter d'autres, car ce qui s'est\npasse dans ces deux centres de constatations s'est reproduit avec\nquelques legeres modifications dans tous les autres.\nD'autre part, vous avez lu, Monseigneur, les remarques qui en\nprecedent le recit. A cette double lumiere, le simple bon sens\n2d\n\f422 M.

Ces trous\nresterent visibles pendant plus de deux mois aux endroits oil la\nterre n'avait pas ete remuee, notamment sous les arbres.\n\" Ces grelons n'avaient pas ete inoffensifs partout, car sur les\ntoits des usines, 1,400 grandes vitres, dont les eclats allerent se\nloger sur les metiers, causerent par leur chute des degats assez serieux,.\nexcepte toutefois dans la bourse des vitriers.\n\" D'apres des renseignements que je crois exacts, la bande de\nterrain visitee par les gros grelons n'avait pas plus d'un kilometre\nde large, allant du Saint-Mont au fort de Remiremont, traversant\nles etablissements industriels de Saint-Etienue. Quelques-uns s'egarerent\nseulement jusqu'a Moulins (Saint-Nabord).

Claude.\n(17)\nDeposition de M. linger, Secretaire de la Mairie de Remiremont.\nII est exact que le dimanche 26 mai 1907, un orage d'intensite\nnioyenne eclata sur Remiremont vers 4 h. de l'apres-midi. A la\nfin de l'orage vers 4-^, apres une accalmie de quelques minutes, la\npluie revint de nouveau et fit place a des grelons de grosseur\nordinaire. Cette chute de grele dura 8 a 10 minutes, puis les\ngrelons se rarefierent mais augmenterent de volume ; ce fut bientot\nune chute d'enormes grelons, tombant a intervalles tres courts (1 ou\n2 secondes), mais bien moins nombreux que les petits grelons du\ndebut qui, eux, etaient tombes serres, conime tombe d'habitude la\ngrele.\nCes gros grelons tombaient peu serres et presques regulierement ;\non les voyait labourer la terre des jardins, dans laquelle ils s'enfon-\n^aient en partie, ou bien se briser en eclats s'ils tombaient sur le\npave. Le vent etait f'aible ou nul. Inutile d'ajouter que les serres,\nles hollandaises, etc., eurent environ la moitie de leurs carreaux brises.\nDes verres \" cathedrale \" (verres depolis epais de 1 centimetre) furent\nraenie brises ou fendus malgre leur epaisseur.\nLa chute de ces enormes grelons dura environ 3 ou 4 minutes\net le temps redevint calme.\nTout le monde sortit alors examiner ces grelons; quelques-uns\nmesuraient 5 centimetres de diametre sur 2 ou 3 centimetres\nd'epaisseur. Les grelons qui s'etaient brises laissaient voir nettement,\nen raison de leur grosseur exceptionnelle, le noyau central et les\ncouches concentriques bleuatres cpii l'entouraient. Ces lignes\nsuivaient la forme des grelons et, dans ceux qui etaient de forme\novale, ces lignes concentriques prenaient une forme ovale et sinueuse.\nCe sont ces dernieres particularity qui firent illusion a un certain\nnombre de personnes, en leur faisant voir, dans quelques grelons,\nune sorte de contour ovale, peu regulier, pouvant a la rigueur ressembler\nvaguement a une silhouette humaine.\nVoici, d'un autre cote, le facteur psychologique qui d6termina la\ncroyance en des images surnaturelles.\n\f432 M. Sage. [part\nHuit jours avant s'etaient tenues de grandes fetes religieuses a\nRemiremont : on avait fete le couronnement d'une statue de N.-D.\ndu Tresor, madone de la localite. Le clerge avait donne a ces\nfetes le plus grand retentissement possible, si bien que la piete\ndes fideles etait, on peut le dire sans exageration, demesurement\nexaltee. Une procession qui devait avoir lieu fut interdite par\nle Conseil municipal, ce qui n'etait pas pour calmer les esprits.\nCes details etaient indispensables pour bien faire voir comment\nprit naissance la croyance en un miracle.\nLe lendemain seulement de la chute de la grele, le bruit se repandit\npeu a peu en ville que certaines personnes avaient vu nettement\nl'image de N.-D. du Tresor dans les grelons. Aucune personne\nsensee n'y ajoutait foi ; la presse catholique locale n'en souffia mot.\nLe clerge lui-meme n'en parla pas dans le compte-rendu des fetes\nde son bulletin paroissial. II paraissait fort incredule comme les\n9\/10\nes\nde la population. Cependant sous la pression evidente des\ndevots, et surtout, dit-on, de certaines devotes influentes, il se\ndecida a en referer a l'autorite diocesaine qui ouvrit une enquete\n;\ncelle-ci conclut a l'authenticite du fait qui a ete soumis a un\nsavant, M* de Lapparent, d'apres VEMle de VEst N\" du 19\/12\/07.\nCe dernier a declare en substance qu'il croyait en son for interieur\na la materialite du fait, mais que au nom de la science il ne pouvait\nrien dire sans avoir entre les mains un des fameux grelons.\nCette reponse me semble synthetiser parfaitement la morale a\ntirer de l'aventure.\nAujourd'hui la croyance dans les \" grelons-medailles \" a atteint\ntous les fideles ; il est surprenant cpa'en dehors de quelques-uns\nd'entre eux, personne n'ait rien remarc]ue. 11 est encore plus\nsurprenant qu'on n'ait pas meme songe a photographier l'un de\nces grelons. Aujourd'hui on nous annonce que l'image etait en\nrelief, alors qu*au debut elle etait seulement dessinee.

This view, for instance, was advanced in the\nearly seventies by Professor Balfour Stewart to explain Sir\nW. Crookes's experiments with D. D. Home, and was tentatively\nbrought forward a few years later at Glasgow before the annual\nmeeting of the British Association by Professor Barrett. In\n1885 Eduard von Hartmann in his work Der Spiritismus,\nwhile admitting most of the phenomena under consideration,\ndrew the line at \" materialisation,\" which he also explained\nby hallucination induced by the medium. And\u2014not to make\nthis list too long\u2014in more recent years the same view has\nfound an eloquent advocate in Mr. Podmore. After an ex-\nhaustive analysis of the possibilities of conjuring in such a\ncase as Home's, he finds himself driven to the conclusion that\nin this medium's performances we seem to have before us\nsometimes actual sense-deception, \" though of the type which is\ncommonly known as illusion rather than hallucination\n;\n\" and\nhe even seems inclined to extend this explanation to other\ncases recorded of mediums whose reputation leaves much to\nbe desired indeed, and cannot in any degree compare with\nHome's.1\n^Modern Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. \"245-246.

To some readers it\nmay appear that some\u2014but I do not think many\u2014of the cases\nI am going to quote are of too prosaic an origin to deserve\nthe honour of a scientific discussion. Be this as it may, I\nhave thought it desirable to make the above reservation.\nI also wish it to be understood that in my review of the\nevidence I shall exclude the whole domain of Eastern and\nFar Eastern Magic. I am of course well aware that, though\nthe opinion of so eminent an expert in these matters as the\nlate Dr. Hodgson only a few years ago (in 1893) was that\n\" we have before us no real evidence to the manifestation by\nIndian jugglers or fakirs of any marvels beyond the power of\ntrickery to produce,\"\n1\nsome striking cases have come to light\nin recent years which seem truly to point prima facie to\nwritten upon ? or\u2014on the contrary\u2014that a notorious and repeatedly exposed\ntrickster can produce at times genuine and astounding phenomena?

Meanwhile\nit should be borne in mind that certain modes of deception\nmay after all have been developed in the East and remained\nunknown to the Western races, so that an explanation which\nwould lit a fakir's performance might be quite inappropriate\nin a European seance-room. It should be also borne in\nmind that on the only occasion when the well-known story\nof the photographing of Indian conjurors (without their tricks\nbeing reproduced on the photographic plate) assumed a concrete\nform capable of being investigated, it proved to be a hoax.2\nBefore we start on our review of the evidence for and\nagainst the objective reality of the so-called \" Physical\nPhenomena \" in Europe and America, we have a serious objec-\ntion to answer at the outset. It will be this : that irrefutable\nproof of that objective reality has already been furnished long\nago. Thousands of slates have been written upon \" directly\n\"\nat slate- writing seances and the writing has invariably remained,\neven when\u2014a circumstance at first sight particularly suggesting\nhallucination\u2014the writing was done in full view.3\nScores of\nJ\nSee Journal S.P.R., Nov. 1904, pp. 299-306, 306-308, and Feb. 1905, p. 30.\n2\n1 do not wish, however, to minimise the following fact. Some two years\nago I happened to meet an officer of the Russian navy, Captain B.-K., who\nrelated to me that when in India some time previously he saw a fakir come\non board his ship and give a performance which included several tricks, and,\nI think, the rope-climbing trick among others. A doctor who was present\nattempted to take a photograph of the tricks and failed to get anything\non the plate. I naturally tried to obtain a written statement from Captain\nB.-K., but failed in this in spite of repeated and urgent requests. As a\nreason for not complying with them he gave this \u2014that he did not know the\ndoctor's address, and that his testimony alone would be worthless ! For the\nincident referred to in the text see Journal S.P.R., Vol. V., pp. 84-6.\n3\nSee, for instance, Mr. Edward T. Bennett's account in \" M. A.(Oxon)'s\n\"\nDirect Writing by Supernormal Means, pp. 19, 20. I know of one or two\ninstances at first hand when a pencil (as in Mr. Bennett's case) was seen\nto write in a tolerably good light.\nIt is of course impossible to appreciate the evidential value even of such\ncases without a thorough knowledge of all the attending circumstances, the\npersonality of the witnesses, etc. That the visibility of the writing is no proof\nin itself of the authenticity of the phenomenon the case of Mrs. Francis, a well-\nknown American slate-writing medium, clearly shows. It has been repeatedly\n\flvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 439\n\" materialised spirits \" have been weighed and photographed or\nhave left behind them specimens of their hair or some part\nof their attire. Not only so, but we have cases when the\nphotographic plate has registered images or forms which to\nthe sitters' eyes were invisible. Many objects\u2014of a very\nmundane and common-place nature, but of presumably unknown\norigin\u2014have appeared at seances in an enigmatic fashion and\nhave invariably\u2014or at least almost invariably\u2014remained after.\nTables apparently suspended in the air (as with Eusapia\nPaladino) have been photographed ;\n\" spirit-hands \" have left\ntheir impression on smoked paper, or paraffin casts have been\ntaken of them ; knots have been tied in endless cords\u2014and so\non almost ad infinitum.\nThen we have the whole mass of the \" Poltergeist \" pheno-\nmena (as distinct from \" hauntings \") supposed to be of the\nsame character as the physical manifestations of the seance-\nroom. Surely the vast amount of crockery (chiefly, it is\ntrue, of the cheaper kind !) broken in this connection in the\ncourse of the nineteenth century alone is such as to compel\nconviction without further discussion that such incidents (in\nasserted that at her sittings, part of the slate having been withdrawn from\nunder the table, the pencil could be seen to write the end of a word ; and\nDr. Elliott Coues, according to his own account, saw it write a whole sentence.\nAnd yet here is the explanation of her method. Mr. Hereward Carrington\nwrites to me :\n\"[Mrs. Francis] uses a cardboard slate, and on it places a small piece of\npencil. First, she holds the slate just under the table, for a few moments, then\nabove the table, and one can see the pencil jumping about on the slate, and\napparently finishing the writing. It is very convincing, and Dr. Hyslop did\nnot see how it was done when he had his sitting ; but subsequent observation\nand experiment explained it.\n\"When the slate is under the table, she stretches out the first finger, places\nit on the pencil, and scrawls a few words on the slate. This is all that appears.\nShe then lets the pencil slide down to the spot over the last few words. Then\nshe takes the slate out from under the table, and holds it so that part of her\nhand covers the writing\u2014the last few words. She also keeps moving the slate\nabout, as though to prevent the pencil from hopping off the slate on to the\nfloor. The pencil is dancing up and down, apparently just finishing the writing.\nThis is effected as follows : I have stated that the slate is of cardboard. She\nhas rubbed rosin over the first finger, and she draws or rubs this ringer over the\nunder side of the slate. The jarring causes the cardboard to vibrate, and the\nsmall piece of slate-pencil is thereby caused to jump up and down, and gives\nthe exact appearance of finishing the writing. The illusion is perfect, if well\ndone. Dr. Hyslop and I practised it, and became quite dexterous !\n\"\n\/\n\f440 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [PART\ntheir great bulk, at least) are of the most objective kind\npossible.\nThe objection in question seems to me to have considerable\nweight, and I do not see how it can be met except in the\nfollowing way : that nearly all such phenomena, whether of\nthe spontaneous or the experimental kind, must be presumed\nto be fraudulent\u2014even when by no means proved such, as\nin Mr. Beattie's case,\u2014almost the only exception being made\nin Home's favour and, possibly, i n that of a very, very few\nnon-professional mediums. There is certainly some excuse for\nsuch a rejoinder, seeing that Home's phenomena seem as described\nto have been, broadly speaking, so much superior to those of\nany other known medium ; but on the whole the necessity\nof drawing such a distinction\u2014which may well seem quite\nartificial\u2014and consequently of ignoring an overwhelming mass\nof data, places us, I should say, in a somewhat delicate position.\nStill, let us turn to an examination of Home's phenomena.\nSome of them\u2014I refer of course to Sir W. Crookes's experiments\nwith the board and spring-balance fitted to a registering\napparatus\u2014having already been proved to be objective beyond\nthe possibility of cavil, we need not concern ourselves with\nthe ordinary \" telekinetic \" incidents of his seances, and will\nproceed at once to what was one of the most striking features\nof these sittings\u2014the appearance of \" spirit diands.\"\nFor this \"phenomenon\" we have an imposing mass of\ntestimony. Much of it is no doubt quite worthless; much\ncould probably have been explained by fraud, and in this\nconnection we have at least one suspicious incident on record.\n1\nBut a good many incidents as described seem by no means\neasily to lend themselves to such an explanation.\nBe this as it may, we have\u2014leaving aside for the present\nthe fraud hypothesis\u2014two theories by which to account for\nthese hands. Either they were due to hallucination or illusion,\nthat is, either they did not exist at all or some other object\nwas mistaken for them, perhaps through suggestion by the\nmedium ; or they were actual \" projections \" from the body of\n1\nSee Journal S.P.fi. for January and May, 1903.

Thus in Sir W. Crookes's words :\n\" A\nflower or other small object is seen to move : one person present\nwill see a luminous cloud hovering over it, another will detect\na nebulous-lookino- hand, whilst others will see nothing but\nthe moving flower.\"\n1\n(2) That when tightly grasped by the hand of one of the\nsitters such hands would\u2014sometimes at least\u2014slowly melt away.\nTo quote Sir W. Crookes again :\n\" I have retained one of these hands in my own, firmly resolved\nnot to let it escape. There was no struggle or effort made to get\nloose, but it gradually seemed to resolve itself into vapour and\nfaded in that manner from my grasp.\"'2\nBoth these circumstances do no doubt tell strongly at first\nsight in favour of the theory that hallucinations were in some\nway or other induced by Home. With regard to the first\ncircumstance\u2014since we know of course that there are various\ndegrees of suggestibility\u2014it might be presumed that those\npersons who saw a whole \" spirit-hand \" at Home's seances were\nmore liable to suggestion than those who saw only a \" luminous\ncloud,\" and still more than those who saw nothing. In fact\nthe truth of some such explanation would seem prima facie\nalmost obvious.\nThe same might be said of the second circumstance. The\n\" hand-melting,\" which has, I think, never been imitated by\nconjurors, would involve another kind of hallucination\u2014this\ntime tactile, of an unusual kind, but of no very great intrinsic\nimprobability.\nIt has been suggested, by the way, that such an impression\nmay have been due to the medium's hand being slowly and\ngradually withdrawn.

Crookes and\nRobert Bell (who says he knows no analogy \" in connection\nwith the sense of touch by which he could make the nature\nof that feeling intelligible\"\nl\n) seem clearly to show such an\nexplanation to be inadequate.\nNow let us consider the other side of the question. The\nfollowing circumstances would seem to show that Home's\n\" spirit-hands,\" whether fraudulent or genuine, were objective\n:\n(1) The fact that such hands were seen by an enormous\nnumber of persons at different times and very often by several\npersons simultaneously.\nOf course if we credit Home with an extraordinary power\nof suggestion, this objection is of no consequence. But the\nsecond one is much more to the point\n:\n(2) These \" hands \" are constantly described as performing-\nactions with a permanent result, e.g. moving objects from one\nplace to another. It is hardly necessary for me to quote\ninstances, as such might be found in abundance in any book\nor paper of reasonable length dealing with the mediumship of\nHome.\nAnd in this connection it is a striking fact that when such\nundoubtedly objective movements of objects were taking place,\nsome of the sitters also would see only the object moving,\nwhilst others would see a hand carrying it. One or two\ninstances may be given. In Sir W. Crookes's \" Notes on\nseances with D. D. Home \" the following incident is recorded\nas having occurred at the sitting of duly 16th, 1871:\nA message was given :\n\" It is impossible for matter to pass through matter, but we will\nshow you what we can do.\"\nWe waited in silence. Presently Mrs. Wm. Crookes said she\nsaw a luminous appearance over the bouquet [in the centre of the\ntable]. Mr. Wfalter] Crookes said he saw the same, and Mr. Home\nsaid he saw a hand moving about.\nA piece of ornamental grass about 15 inches long here moved out\nof the bouquet and was seen to slowly disappear ... as if it\nwere passing through the table.\n1\nD. D. Home, his Life and Mission, p. 54.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 443\nImmediately after it had disappeared through the table Mrs. Wra. C.\nsaw a hand appear from beneath the table between her and Mr. Home\nholding the piece of grass. It brought it up to her shoulder, tapped it\nagainst her two or three times with a noise audible to all, and then\ntook the grass down on to the floor, where the hand disappeared.\nOnly Mrs. Wm. C. and Mr. Home saw the hand, but we all saw\nthe movements of the piece of grass, which were as I have described.\nAt another sitting\nMrs. Wm. Crookes saw a hand and fingers touching the flower in\nMr. Home's buttonhole. The flower was then taken by the hand and\ngiven to Mrs. I., and the green leaf was in a similar manner given\nto Mr. T. Mrs. Wm. C. and Mr. Home saw the hand doing this,\nthe others only saw the flower and leaf moving through the air.\nA little later at the same seance \" a hand was seen by some\nand a luminous cloud by others pulling the flowers about which\nwere in a stand on the table. A flower was then seen to be\ncarried deliberately and given to Mrs. Wr. C.\"\n1\nOne more detailed instance must suffice. Viscount Aclare\n(now Earl of Dunraven) tells us that at a stance held in\nMarch, 1869, at Garinish, a cottage of Lord Dunraven's on\nthe Kerry coast, the sitters (Lords Dunraven and Aclare and\nMajor Blackburn)\nall heard a movement about vase N [one of the vases of flowers\nplaced on the small table round which the party were seated], and\nHome and I [Lord Adare] both saw a hand upon it ; I said that\nthe vase was moving, Home insisted that it was not, and requested\nme to place my hand upon it; I did so and found that it was\nmoving slowly round, but the sound we heard was caused by the\nhand rubbing against the side of the vase ; I saw the hand all the\ntime. We now heard a rustling among the flowers and Home said:\n\" The fingers have closed over a flower and taken it away.\" I did\nnot see the flower taken, but the hand at that moment disappeared.\nHome and I both observed a hand rise above the edo;e of the table\nnear the window and place a flower upon it ; I then lost sight of\nthe hand, but Home said he saw it carry the flower across the table\nand place it near my father ;\nmy father saw the flower all the\ntime moving as it were of itself, for he could not distinguish the hand\nthat conveyed it. He took the flower and asked if it was for him.\nProceedings of the H.P.E., Vol. VI., pp. 116, 120, 121.\n\f444 Count Perovslcy-Petvovo-Solovovo. [part\nThe following was spelled out: \"Yes, and we will give you another\nsoon.\" My father remarking that he was very anxious to see a\nhand, the following messages were given :\n\" Place your hand over\nthe flowers.\" He did so over vase N and we all heard \u2014and my\nfather, Home and I saw\u2014a hand moving among the flowers. \"Now\non them.\" He did so and the hand became much more distinctly\nvisible to him. I said to my father :\n\" I suppose you were told\nto place your hand there in order that they might draw some power\nfrom you to enable them to make the hand sufficiently material\nfor you to see it distinctly.\" \" Yes,\" was answered by three loud\nraps. Sacha's (Home's wife's) miniature was now carried from\ntable B and placed upon our table ; none of us saw anything\nsupporting it, but we observed it placed quietly upon Home's hands,\nand then gliding off them it moved across the table until it remained\nstationary on the corner near the window. . . . Home and I now\ndistinctly saw a hand place little Dannie Coxe's photograph on the\nedge of our table next the window and then push it a little\nfurther on to the table. . . . Home and I perceived a whole arm.\nand hand between our table and the window, it was slightly\nluminous and appeared whiter than the white table-cloth. The hand\npushed the accordion, F, along the shelf, S, and then grasping it\ntook it off ; the accordion fell, but not heavily, to the ground. All\nsaw and heard the accordion moved. 1\nNow, what do such incidents as these show us ? Simply\nthis : Had the objects not been undoubtedly moved and not\nchanged their place, we should certainly have been justified\nin seeing in the inability of some of the sitters to see the-\nsupposed spirit-hand while others saw it plainly\u2014a strong\nproof of its hallucinatory origin. But the case turns out to be\nquite different. We must look for the \" something \" which\ndisplaced the accordion, the flower or the bell.\n2\nAnd here\nthe very diversity of the impression made by the moving\nobject on the sitters' retinae would seem to afford a slight\npresumption in favour of the supernormal origin of the move-\nment. For we may, I think, not unreasonably suppose that\nhad the movement been produced artificially, all the sitters\nwould have seen more or less the same thing.\n1\nExperiences in Spiritualism, by Viscount Adare, p. 135.\n2\n\"I had been invited by the late Mis. Milner Gibson,'' says Dr. Hawksley,\n\" to meet a number of friends and Mr. Home at her house in Hyde Park Place.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 445-\nIn view of the undoubtedly objective character of many\nactions performed by Home's \" spirit-hands,\" it may be\ndoubted whether even the \" hand-melting \" above referred to\nis a decisive proof of the subjective nature of these hands.\nAt any rate if this phenomenon experienced by so many of\nHome's sitters was purely subjective, we have still to account\nfor the movements of objects performed by these very hands.\nThus Dr. Garth Wilkinson tells us how in the spring of\n1855, at his very first seance with Home, having put his\nhand under the table he felt a bell being placed in it.\nEvery hand but my own being on the table I distinctly felt the\nfingers up to the palm of a hand holding the bell. It was a soft,\nwarm, fleshy substantial hand, such as I should be glad to feel at\nthe extremity of the friendship of my best friends. But I had no\nsooner grasped it momentarily than it melted away, leaving my\nhand void with the bell only in it. . . d\nDr. Wilkinson adds that he is as sure the limb he felt\nwas a human hand \" of extraordinary life \" and not Home's\nfoot as that the nose of the Apollo Belvidere is not a horse's\near. I have always thought it a matter of regret that so\nlittle attention seems to have been paid, as a general rule,\nto the position of Home's feet by his sitters, not even\nexcluding the most famous. But here what we want to have\nexplained is not the movement of the bell, but the impression\nof the \" spirit-hand \" melting in his experienced by Dr.\nWilkinson.\nI will give one more instance of the curious behaviour of\nIt was a summer's evening about eight o'clock, and I sat near to a large\nwindow, against which stood a table, and on the table an ordinary large bell.\n... A request was made, I forget by whom, that the bell should be conveyed\naway by spiritual influence. Sitting very near to the bell I distinctly saw a\nwell-shaped hand appear on the table, and after resting there a short time\nthe hand rose, grasped the bell and carried it away we knew not where.\nWhile the hand rested on the table I rose from my seat, went to the table,\nand without touching the hand, examined it by careful inspection.

It should be said that a grate of glowing\n\u2022coals directly in front of the party gave what Mr. Burr describes\nas \" a good light.\"\nA sheet of paper which lay on the floor\nwas taken from the floor, slowly lifted up and placed upon the table,\nas I can affirm, without the aid of a human hand. Sitting at the end\nof the table where this was done, I was enabled to see the whole of\nthis proceeding. The paper was placed upon the edge of the table,\nand so near my hand as to touch it. I saw plainly and clearly the\nhand that held the paper. It was evidently a lady's hand\u2014very\nthin, very pale, and remarkably attenuated. The conformation of\nthis hand was peculiar. . . . The hand also narrowed from the\nlower knuckles to the wrist where it ended. All this could be\nseen by such light as was in the room, while the hand was for a\ntew moments holding the paper upon the edge of the table. . . .\nThis hand, according to Mr. Burr, took a pencil and began\nto write. \" This was in plain sight, being only shaded by\n\u2022\none of the circle who was sitting between the paper on the\ntable and the fire.\" \" The hands of each one present were\nupon the table in full view.\" Mr. Burr bent down close\nto the hand as it wrote and ascertained that it \"extended no\nfurther than the wrist.\" When he brought his face still\ncloser to it the hand dropped the pencil and vanished. The\nwriting on being examined proved to be the name \" in her\nown proper handwriting \" of a relative and intimate friend\nof one of the circle, who had died a few years previously.\nThe hand afterwards came and shook hands with each one\npresent. I felt it minutely. It was tolerably well and symmetri-\ncally made, though not perfect, and it was soft and slightly warm.\nIt ended at the wrist.\nIn a letter written in 1887 to Madame D. D. Home (author\nof D. D. Home, his Life and Mission and The Gift of D. D.

Then the hand sought to withdraw from mine. I\nwould not let it. Then it pulled to get away with a good deal of\nstrength. But I held it firmly, resolved to see what it was. . . .\nWhen the hand found it could not get away it yielded itself up to\nme for my examination : turned itself over and back, shut up its\nfingers and opened them, let me examine the finger-nails, the joints,\nthe creases. It was a perfect human hand, but white as snow, and\nended at the wrist. I was not satisfied with the sense of sight to\nprove this\u2014I wanted the concurrent testimony of other senses\n;\nand I swung my arm up and down where the arm belonging to\nthis hand should have been . . . but no arm was there. Even\nthen I was not satisfied. Turning this strange hand palm towards\nme, I pushed my right forefinger entirely through the palm till it\ncame out an inch or more visibly from the back of the hand. In\nother words I pushed my finger clear through that mysterious\nhand. When I withdrew it, the place closed up, much as a piece\nof putty would close under such circumstances\u2014leaving a visible\nmark or scar where the wound was, but not a hole.\nWhile I was still looking at it, the hand vanished quick as a\nlightning-flash. It was gone. 1\nThe same hand\u2014be it observed\u2014which had just given\na palpable proof of its objectivity by writing before the eyes\nof the sitters.\nIt goes without saying that we must not attach to this\nnarrative any decisive importance : Mr. Burr describes the most\nstartling episode more than thirty years after its occurrence,\nand\u2014and this is the main thing\u2014we do not know in what\nlight we must consider his capacities as a witness, especially to\nsuch astounding facts. Now, in the realm of Psychical Eesearch\nthe personality of the witnesses is of course everything ; and\nit should always be remembered (this fundamental circum-\nstance is too often, I think, lost sight of) that two precisely\nanalogous statements when made (in all honesty) by X and Y\nmay be absolutely worthless in one case and worthy of all\n\u2022credence in the other.

In view of this fact, the \" relative visibility\n\"\nof these hands in some cases proves nothing ; nor is the\n\" hand-melting \" itself decisive evidence.\nNow, if I am told that the objective, and in some cases\nthe permanent, character of the actions performed by the\n\" hands \" is after all no positive proof that the hands supposed\nto produce them were equally objective, I will answer that we\nmust surely draw the line somewhere. I have already met\nthe adherents of the illusion theory more than half way by\nadmitting provisionally that some incidents attested by a,\ncrowd of witnesses at different times and very often by several\npersons simultaneously (and verified in some cases by more\nthan one sense) may have been non-existent. But beyond this\nI am not prepared to go. If a supposed spirit-hand or appari-\ntion can be proved to have accomplished a more or less\ncomplicated action\u2014for instance, to have written a word or\nto have carried an object across the room\u2014I maintain that,\nthis is, broadly speaking, a proof of its reality (I say of\ncourse \"reality,\" not necessarily \"authenticity\"). If there are\npeople who think otherwise, I think that the onus probandi\ndevolves upon them.\nLet us, at any rate, see how such a theory would work in\nthe following case. Eeaclers of the S.P.R. Proceedings will find\nin them 1\na condensed account by Dr. Leaf of a sitting held\nin St. Petersburg in the spring of 1893 with a Prussian medium\n1\nVol. XIX., pp. 407-409. I had lately occasion to talk the matter over\nwith Dr. Lestchinsky, one of the sitters ; and he entirely confirmed to me\nthe startling character of the phenomena and the deep impression they made-\non him. I say this with special reference to p. 407, footnote.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 449\nnamed Nikolaeff, by six doctors who were members of the\nEussian Society for Experimental Psychology. After he was\nentirely stripped and dressed in a garment provided by the\nsitters which contained nothing white of any kind and the\ntwo seance-rooms had been thoroughly searched, Nikolaeff was\nplaced in a chair in a side-room behind a portiere in front of\nwhich the investigators seated themselves armed with opera-\nglasses for better vision. There was enough light in the room\nto see the medium's features and even fingers, his hands resting\non his knees. Under these conditions and the curtain having\nbeen withdrawn, raps and noises of every description, some of\nthem almost deafening, began to be heard in the medium's\ncabinet. Then luminous clouds began to appear beside Nikolaeff,\nout of which first one hand then another gradually formed\nitself and executed all kinds of movements : now Hitting\nthrough the air, now audibly snapping their fingers, now\nviolently knocking on the medium himself, on his chair, on\nthe wall, the ceiling, the side-board and a settee which stood\nin the \" cabinet \" ; in this case the blows were heard \" three\nrooms off.\" Sometimes these hands rose above the medium's\nhead, at others they would extend down as far as his feet.\nHere we have to suppose a collective hallucination, both\nvisual and auditory, affecting six persons for a very appreciable\nlapse of time. This is already somewhat hard to believe.\nBut when we read that later on one of these luminous hands\nwas seen to come close to the hanging lamp and, after rapping\nupon the glass violently, suddenly pulled off the silk lamp-\nshade and threw it towards the sitters in such a way that one\nof them involuntarily ducked : and that still later another\n\" hand \" pushed the settee violently towards the sitters, bringing\nit almost close to the curtain, we cannot but feel that here\nhallucination breaks down altogether. The throwing of the\nlamp-shade and the displacing of the settee, to whatever cause\ndue, were at any rate of an objective character. Well, does\nthe illusion theory help us to understand how these things\nwere done ? Just the reverse. It merely complicates matters\nand nothing more.\nWhen we come to another and similar series of incidents\u2014\nthe appearance of full-form phantasms, we again constantly\nmeet with cases when out of several sitters only one would\n\f450 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nsee a spirit-form.\n1\nAnd in some cases the hypothesis of a.\npurely subjective origin for such incidents would at first sight\nseem the more natural since they obviously appear to have\ndeveloped after a suggestion made by the medium.\nLet us begin with one of the least impressive episodes.\nViscount Adare tells us that on a certain occasion Home\nhad to drop some lotion into his eyes. I dropped it in for him and\nthen put the lights out. Almost immediately he said: \"What a\ncurious effect that stuff has had, I see the most beautiful little\nlights before me.\" I said: \"That is not the effect of the drops;\nyou said wlfen in a trance that we should see lights.\" . . . He\nwent back to bed and then I began to see . . . the most beautiful\nlittle phosphorescent lights moving. 2\nIn the following case again both the visual and the auditory\nimpressions are clearly traceable to suggestions made by Home,\nand as Lord Adare was the only other person present during\nthe manifestation, the case seems comparatively easy of solution.\nBriefly stated it happened thus. Lord Adare had seen in the\npapers the announcement of the death of Adah Menken, an\nAmerican actress, with whom both he and Home had been\nslightly acquainted. On the following morning he got a letter\nfrom Home saying Adah Menken had been to visit him and\nwas anxious to come when he and Lord Adare were together. On\nreturning to London Home came to stay at Lord Adare's at\nthe latter's request. Both felt very nervous the whole evening.\nAfter they had gone to bed and put the lights out they began\nto hear music \" powerful and distinct.\"\nHome said that the music formed words : that in fact it was a voice\nspeaking and not instrumental music. I could hear nothing but\nthe chords like an organ or harmonium played at a distance. Home\nbecame quite excited because I could not distinguish the words . . .\nHe asked the spirits if possible to make the words sufficiently\nclear for me also to hear them. 3\n1\nIn other cases, on the contrary, all the sitters would see lights and forms\nbut one. Mrs. Honywood tells us that a sitting she could at no time \"dis-\ntinguish any form or positive figure or see any eyes save our own,\" whilst\nthe several persons present continually saw abnormal appearances of every\ndescription (Dialectical Society's Rejjort, pp. 366-369).\n2\nExperiences in Spiritualism, p. 52. 3\nIbidem, p. 34.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 451\nThe music became louder and louder until Lord Adare dis-\ntinctly heard the words :\n\" Hallelujah, praise the Lord, praise the\nLord Almighty.\n-\n' \" It was no imagination or the result of\nanxiety on my part to hear the same as Home did. Every\nnow and then I could not distinguish words, although he said\nhe could ; but I repeatedly heard the words above mentioned\nas plainly as possible.\"\nHome then suoqested to Lord Adare that he heard the\nwords \" Adah Isaaks Menken \" pronounced, but Lord Adare\ndid not. Then, the room being very nearly dark,\nwe both saw as it were a luminous cloud about the middle of the\nroom, over the table, and another luminous clouddike body floating\nin the air. Occasionally I saw a luminous form standing at the\nfoot of Home's bed which he did not see, and he at one time saw\na similar appearance at the foot of mine which I failed to perceive ;\nwe distinctly heard the rustling of a silk dress moving about the\nroom. Home and I had called on Menken at her hotel one day\nlast year and she then had on a very heavy silk dress : it appeared\nas though she caused the rustling of this dress to be heard by us.\nAt one time I heard some one moving, and on looking over towards\nHome's bed I saw her quite plain (as did also Home) as a white\nslightly luminous body ; I could clearly see the folds of the drapery.\nIn passing between him and the window Home said she obstructed\nthe light. She moved up from near the foot of his bed where I\nfirst saw her, making as loud a rustling noise as a living woman\nin a heavy silk dress would do, to the head of his bed, bent over,\nput her hands upon his head and disappeared. 1\nSuch a case as this is sure to enlist the particular sympathy\nof the adherents of the hallucination theory. We have, as it\nwere, in Lord Adare's account several separate suggestions of\nHome's recorded. First he lets his friend know that the\nAmerican actress has already paid him a visit and will soon\npay another\u2014thus preparing the ground, it may be said, for a\nvisual hallucination. Then he seizes upon some real or imaginary\nsound to state that he hears sounds of extramundane origin \\\nthen he urges upon his companion that a voice is speaking,\nnot music playing ; this time the 'supposed \" suggestion \" appeal's\nto work with more difficulty, but at last Lord Adare gives in ;.\n1\nExperiences in Spiritualism, p. 35.\n\f452 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nand though another suggestion (that of hearing the actress's\nname) apparently fails, the road is clear, and Home's friend\nnow sees what the medium wants him to see.\n1\nHow simple and easy an explanation ! Nor do I at all\ndeny that (leaving out of account the hypothesis of fraud) it\nwould be, broadly speaking, by far the most natural if this\ncase had stood alone, or if all other cases of apparitions\nseen in Home's presence had presented the same character.\nIf so, well and good ; if not, we must look out for another\nexplanation ; and should the hallucination theory prove inade-\nquate in other cases, we should certainly be justified in hesitating\nto apply it to this one also.\nI will therefore mention a case when the supposed \" spirit-\nform \" was seen by several sitters. On the evening of February\n9th, 1869, Lord Adare, Captain Gerard Smith, and Dr. Gully\nof Malvern assembled together with Home in Lord Adare's\nrooms in London. The company were sitting in a small room\nthe objects in which were made dimly visible by the faint\nlight that came in from the window near which Home was\n\"impressed \"\nto place himself, saying: \" Sacha will try and make\nherself visible to you.\" And then another form beside his\nown\u2014that of his late wife\u2014grew into distinctness.\nHer form (wrote Lord Adare the next day) gradually became\napparent to us : she moved close to Home and kissed him. She\nstood beside him against the window intercepting the light as a\nsolid body, and appeared fully as material as Home himself: no\none could have told which was the mortal body and which the spirit.\nIt was too dark, however, to distinguish features. I could see that\nshe had her full face turned towards us, and that either her hair\nwas parted in the middle and flowed down her shoulders, or that\nshe had on what appeared to be a veil.\nAt Lord Adare's request Captain Gerard Smith wrote to\nhim certifying that he had also seen the \" spirit-form,\" and\ndescribing the apparition as follows :\nHome rose and stood at the window with his right arm extended,\nand the spirit seemed to sweep down, until it rested with both hands\non his outstretched arm, looking up into his face. From the position\n'Instances of such \"suggestions\"' might be greatly multiplied. See one\nfurther on.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 453\nin which I sat the profile of the face was perfectly visible to me,\nand when the two faces approached each other to kiss, there was\nno apparent difference in the degree of density of the two figures. 1\nApart from the question whether conscious trickery is excluded\nin this episode, it will be admitted that the hallucination hypo-\nthesis is considerably strained by it, for we should have to\nsuppose that the apparition is \" suggested \" by Home to three\npersons simultaneously, the impressions of at least two of them,\nand probably those of all three, apparently coinciding pretty\nclosely. Yet though strained, the theory in question may\nstill be said to hold the field, as neither was the apparition\nphotographed nor did it leave any permanent traces on the\nmaterial world ; and we still want something more to disprove\nit definitely.\nLet us then consider the following incident. The narrator,\nit is true, was a powerful physical medium himself, but, as we\nshall presently see, we have most important corroborative\nevidence.\nOn May 7th, 1873, the Rev. W. Stainton Moses attended\na seance with Home at Miss Douglas's, 81, South Audley Street.\nThe sitters, besides himself and Miss Douglas, were Mrs. Home,\nSerjeant Cox, and Mr. and Mrs. W. Crookes. After sitting round\nthe table for fifty minutes, during which time Stainton Moses\n\" felt power drawn \" from him and was partially entranced, there\nwere some faint raps both on the table and on Stainton Moses's\nchair. Then the accordion, on being taken by Home and held\nunder the table, \" played a strange weird melody unlike anything\nearthly I ever heard.\" \" The table rocked about like a ship\nat sea, groaned and finally separated at the joint \"\u2014but as\nnothing came out of it, it was joined again. Then a chair\nmoved of itself, the sitters ascertaining that \" direct gaze would\nparalyse the movement at once,\" till at last Home became\nentranced, rose and went into the inner dining-room, taking\nthe accordion with him and placing it on the dinner-waggon.\nThe fire-light was lowered, the reading-lamp was put out of the\nroom, the gas behind the window at the end of the room was\nlowered, and we sat in gloom, the window at the end showing out\nin bold relief. During the evening Home stood near the fire-place\n1\nLord Adara's Expzriences in Spiritualism, pp. 95 and 177.\n2F\n\f454 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nand kept us informed of his position. . . . We all saw a hand\ndescend from the top of the curtain and play the accordion. It was a\nlarge hand and its reflection on the window blind was strong.\nAfter this a head showed in similar way. When Mrs. Crookes was\ntold to go into the room and occupy the chair marked in the plan\n[near the window], a form was materialised as far as the middle.\nIt floated near the folding doors and advanced towards Mrs. Crookes,\nwho screamed and it vanished.\nLady Crookes (in 1893) certifies this narrative to be an\n\" accurate account ... of one of the most interesting seances\n\"\nshe \" ever had with Mr. Home.\" She says that the gas behind\nthe window in the back dining-room (where she had been led\nby Home) \" was bright enough to show everything in the room\ndistinctly.\"\nMr. Home then left me and stood between the two rooms. The\naccordion was immediately taken from his hand by a cloudy appear-\nance which soon seemed to condense into a distinct human form,\nclothed in a filmy drapery, standing near Mr. Home between the two\nrooms. The accordion began to play . . . and the figure gradually\nadvanced towards me till it almost touched me, playing continuously.\nIt was semi-transparent, and I could see the sitters through it all\nthe time. Mr. Home remained near the sliding doors. As the fio'iire\napproached I felt an intense cold, getting stronger as it got nearer,\nand as it was giving me the accordion I could not help screaming.\nThe figure immediately seemed to sink into the floor to the waist,\nleaving only the head and shoulders visible, still playing the accordion,\nwhich was then about a foot off the floor. Mr. Home and my husband\ncame to me at once, and I have no clear recollection of what then\noccurred, except that the accordion did not cease playing immediately.\n. . . I have always regretted that my want of presence of mind\nbrought the phenomena to so abrupt a termination. 1\nHere, I submit, we have good evidence that the apparition,\nwhether genuine or fraudulent, was at least objective, since\nit was able to carry an accordion across the room and lay it\non a certain spot altogether different from the one it had occupied\na few moments before. It seems impossible to believe that\nthe experience of the sitters on this occasion was hallucinatory,\n1\nProceedings S.P.It., Vol. IX., pp. 309-311; cf. Sir W. Crookes's Researches,\np. 94.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 455\nso I do not see much use in postulating such an explanation\nin other instances which, taken by themselves, are no more\nextraordinary than the accordion-playing phantom. As for the\nrejoinder that the objectivity of the movements performed by\nthe accordion may be after all no proof of the objectivity of\nthe apparition, I beg to refer the reader to what I said in\nanswer to a possible similar objection as to the \" spirit-hands.\"\nOnce we think it proved that the apparition in the case\nwe have just been considering was no hallucination\u2014we need\nnot postulate hallucination to explain the apparition of a form\npurporting to be Home's deceased wife,\u2014whether to three\nwitnesses or even to one only ; nor that of \" Adah Menken \"\nto Lord Adare, nor many similar incidents. And we need\nnot concern ourselves either with the general liability to purely\nsubjective hallucinations which seems in fact to have been the\nspeciality of many of Home's sitters ; or with the abnormal\nappearances of every description seen constantly by Lord Adare\nand Lord Lindsay ; or with the \" magnificent white flower as\nlarge as a dinner-plate and with long purple stamens \" which\nsuddenly appeared on a chair close beside Lady D. one evening\nas she sat in her drawing-room in company with Home, only\nto \" melt into the air \" two minutes later\n;\n1\netc., etc. Many\nsuch impressions were no doubt purely subjective, but this\ndoes not help us to understand the main incidents.\nSo much for some of the most striking of Home's phenomena.\nIt is true that there still remain others to be accounted for.\nHere my task will be less easy. It is difficult to prove the\nobjective reality of such a thing as \" elongation \" if the evidence\nof several persons testifying to the fact is deemed insufficient\n;\n2\nand I think the same must be said of the levitations of which,\nas Sir W. Crookes wrote in the early seventies, \" there are at\nleast a hundred recorded instances.\" Though much of this\nevidence is undoubtedly worthless, we still have Sir W. Crookes's\ntestimony that he saw Home completely raised from the floor\nof the room on three separate occasions, and some striking\n^Dialectical Society'* Report on Spiritualism, p. 328.\n2\nAs many as nine or ten in one instance, it would appear (D. D. Home, his\nLife and Mission, p. 290). Among the persons present were Lords Lindsay\nand Adare, Mr. H. T. Humphreys, a journalist, and Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall,\nin whose house the seance took place. I repeat again that it is not the\nauthenticity but the objectivity of the phenomena that I am championing.\n\f456 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nstatements from Lord Lindsay (now Earl of Crawford), Lord\nA dare, and others. In 1868 in Lord Lindsay and Mr. Hawkins\nSimpson's presence \" in good light \" Home \" was levitated slowly\nand swaying from side to side in air . . . on to the sofa, no\none near him or myself\" (Mr. Simpson).1\nIn March, 1869,\nat Adare Abbey Home was seen by three witnesses (the Earl\nof Dunraven, Viscount Adare and Captain Wynne) to float at\na height which carried him over a broken wall two feet high\nwithout his having touched it. \" The distance that we saw\nhim thus carried must have been at least ten or twelve yards,\"\nsays Lord Adare.'\n2\nBut of course all this must go for nothing,\nas well, I suppose, as Home's celebrated flight at Ashley House\non the 16th of December, 1868, though here the probability\nthat the performance in question was objective seems to me\nnot inconsiderably enhanced, and the position of those who\ncling to illusion as an explanation made more difficult by the\ncircumstance that\u2014his real or imaginary flight over\u2014the medium\ndid undoubtedly find himself in a room which lie had left (in\na perfectly natural way) some time previously.3\nI add here a case of \" levitation \" kindly communicated to\nme by Miss Johnson, and hitherto unpublished. Of the narrator,\nMiss Johnson writes :\nMr. Warndorfer (an Austrian member of the S.P.R.) contributed\nthe report of a Poltergeist case printed in the Journal for May, 1907.\nHe is an unusually intelligent and competent observer, of long experi-\nence. I met him for the first time on January 17th, 1908, and\nheard then of many experiences of his. Among other things, he\ntold me of a case of apparent levitation, which he had witnessed.\nAt the time lie had been a good deal impressed by this, but on\nthinking it over some months later, and trying to recall all the\n1\nJournal S.P.B., Vol. IV., p. 123.\n2\nThe Gift of D. D. Home, p. 111. In more than one case Home is said\nto have made pencil marks upon the ceiling when \"levitated\" {Dialectical\nSociety's Report, pp. 190, 194). But we are not given any details.\n3\nThere seems to me to be a flaw in Mr. Podmore's criticism of this famous\ncase in this very point (Modem Spiritualism, Vol. II., pp. 255-258). He\ndoes not apparently deny that just after his (supposed) levitation was over,\nHome did return to the room in which the three sitters were. If so, by\nwhat means? If it was simply through the door, whereas all three believed\nhim to have come through the window, Mr. Podmore, I think, ought to\nhave stated this plainly and not left us in doubt.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 457\ncircumstances, it struck him as very odd that there was a complete\nand abrupt gap in his memory at a certain point. This led him\nto suspect that some dissociation of consciousness had occurred, during\nwhich he might have been hallucinated. He was certainly in no\ncondition of abnormal excitement at the time.\nThis case occurred in Bohemia in 1906. K. is the foreman of a\nfactory there, which Mr. Warndorfer sometimes has occasion to\nvisit. K. has now left the place and been lost sight of, so that\nhis testimony cannot be obtained. Alice Johnson.\nThe following is Mr. Warndorfer's own account\n:\no\nAt the sitting four persons took part. The foreman K., his wife, a\nwoman of about 50, very hysterical, the medium and myself. The\nmedium is the wife of the editor of a small local (Bohemian) paper\n;\nshe is not a professional medium and came on being invited ; I paid\nher travelling and other expenses. She had been recommended to\nme as a trance-speaker and clairvoyant : at previous sittings she\nhad delivered speeches and given messages which, though quite\ninteresting, had no evidential value whatever. We sat in the corner\nof the foreman's parlour\u2014see sketch\u2014which was half in the dark ;\nthe light came through the open door from a lamp; the light was\nsufficient to see the features of all the persons clearly ; I think one\ncould have read ordinary print.\nFebruary 7th, 1908.\nLamp\nCi pboard .\nA.

[PAPvT\nAfter a few minutes, Mrs. K. had an attack of hysterical twitch-\nings, threw her arms and legs about and finally fell off her chair\nand remained, all in a heap, under the table, her head resting on\nher knees ; she was left there, so as not to disturb the medium\nand K. saying that he was not anxious about her. The medium\nhad in the meantime risen from her chair waving her arms in\na circular movement ; her body was stiff, her eyes closed and she\nleaned backward. The foreman got up and stood behind her with\nhis arms spread out in order to protect her against knocking\nagainst two high cupboards, forming an angle behind her. She\nbreathed heavily and after a few moments rattled in the throat\n;\nK. spoke to her soothingly and made passes round her, all the\nwhile standing close behind her (between her and the chests). I\nsat quietly watching her, when suddenly there were two very loud\nknocks, seemingly on the wall below the window opposite, and\nshe appeared to be floating horizontally above the table, about a\nfoot from it, her head on or near K.'s chest, her arms still waving\nabout and her feet kicking frantically in the air, so that I had\nto jump up in order to avoid being kicked in the face ; I remember\nseeing her (after I stood up) clear above the table, for about\nhalf a minute ; her skirt did not touch the table, she was free in\nthe air, except perhaps her head and the back of the neck, which\nmay have rested against K.'s chest. She breathed so heavily now,\nthat I was afraid she might suffer seriously, so I made some passes\nover her body in the air and then down her body from the shoulders\nto her feet, when she stood on the ground, which soothed her at\nonce and brought her back from the trance ; she spoke a few words\nand was not aware of what had happened.\nWe awakened Mrs. K. who asked at once :\n\" Now, have you\nseen them?\" \"Whom?\" \"Why, the two men, who knocked and\ncame in from there (pointing to the window) and carried her (the\nmedium) about on their shoulders.\" So far as I know Mrs. K.\nwas fast asleep under the table, with her head on her knees ; I\nam not sure, however, whether or not she saw the medium above\nthe table; she may have done so, without my noticing it. I\nspoke to K. about the phenomena, immediately afterwards and\nagain later on; I omitted, however, what a more efficient investi-\ngator would have done at once, to ask him what he had seen and\nto preserve his record, independent of mine. I remember to have\nspoken with him about the medium's floating, and mentioning the\nfact that it could not be considered a case of clear levitation as\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 459\nthe medium seemed to have touched his body at least with her\nhead and perhaps her neck ; he related the occurrence to the\nmedium and to his wife, and conversation concerning it was carried\non for some time, but his perceptions may have been tainted by\nmine ; he was evidently very pleased at something remarkable having\noccurred at his house in my presence and he would have, most pro-\nbably, willingly accepted and believed any suggestions given by me.\nI considered the case a very interesting and good one till it struck\nme one day, in thinking the matter over, that I could not recall how\nthe medium got down from the floating into the standing position; I\nhave a hazy idea about her getting up ; I clearly remember her\nleaning back further and further, her body being quite stiff, and\nthink I recollect a kind of stepping movement before I had her feet\nclose to my face ; I distinctly remember her feet kicking at my face\nand the sight of her rather shabby stockings and shoes ; but from\nthe moment when I made passes over her horizontal body till the\ntime when she woke up, standing, still under my passes, I cannot\nrecall the movements of her body; there is an absolute blank in\nmy memory. Possibly I got flurried by her laborious breathing\nand the fear that she might suffocate ; I do not think so, however,\nas I was very quiet and not at all excited during the seance,\nhaving assisted at a good many before and not being of a very\nexcitable temperament. I have come to the conclusion therefore\nthat I may have been under a hallucination when I believed her\nto float above the table ; what could have evoked such a hallucina-\ntion I could not tell, as I only expected to hear a speech or some\nclairvoyant description ; what speaks in favour of the hallucination\ntheory would perhaps be the circumstance that the medium never\nbefore, nor for some time afterwards, showed any physical pheno-\nmena. I therefore give you the case more as one of a possible\ncurious hallucination than as one of levitation. If you wish, I can\ntry and get a report from K. .\nw..\n\u201e\u201e\u201e\nJ \u00b0 1\nA. \\\\ ATiNDORFER.\nI have no comments to offer on this case. My assertion\nthat I see no particular grounds for believing in the subjective\ncharacter of the supposed levitation would be of course as\ngratuitous as Mr. Warndorfer's declaration that he believes\nhis experience to have been hallucinatory. I will content\nmyself with remarking that the \" absolute blank \" which, as\nit seems to him, did occur at a certain point in his memory\ndoes not appear to me to be a decisive prpofe\nof an abnormal\n\f460 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nstate. I am not at all sure such blanks are not to be\nmet with in ordinary life and under quite commonplace\ncircumstances.\nEeturning to Home's case, we may next consider the \" fire-\ntest,\" the handling of coals, etc., and causing other people to handle\nthem,\u2014a circumstance which at least one very able critic of\nthe Home evidence has apparently left unnoticed. I confess I\ndo not always see where the element of illusion can creep in\nin the very numerous accounts referring to these episodes.\nWe constantly read of red-hot coals and hot lamp-chimneys\nbehaving just as they should in the natural course of things\n;\nof Captain Gerard Smith getting a blister on his finger after\ntouching a glass chimney which had just been found quite\ncool to the touch by Lord Lindsay and Mrs. Honywood,1\nof\na large red-hot mass of coal which, after it had been handled\nwith immunity by Home first and then by Lady Gomm, on\nbeing laid upon a sheet of paper caused it to blaze directly ;\n2\nof a match which instantly ignited when brought into contact\nwith a chimney which Home had apparently left for four\nor five minutes in the fire-place among the glowing coals\n(after which, we are told, he \" thrust the heated glass into\nhis mouth applying especially his tongue to it\n\"\n3\n), etc. In\nthese cases it cannot be supposed that suggestion and illusion\nmade a roomful of people mistake an inoffensive orange for\na \" red-hot mass of coal \" or a genuinely cool lamp-chimney\nfor a hot one. But if not, what happened ? The objects in\nquestion must have been handled by some one to produce\nthese effects\u2014and, if so, how could they, under the circumstances,\nhave been so handled with impunity ?

To adopt such a theory seems to\nme to strain incredulity (should it not rather be called credulity\nthe other way ?) to the utmost.\nNow if I am told that I have been writing this under a\nmisconception of the theory ; that if suggestion there was, it\nmust have worked in one sense only\u2014that of ensuring immunity\nfor the sitters who went through the \" fire-ordeal \"\u2014I will\nanswer that this is no explanation ; and that what we want\nto know is precisely how suggestion can have protected Home's\nsitters not only from the feeling of intense pain which must\nhave been felt under the circumstances, but also from physical\neffects ?\nSo much for the most startling of Home's \" manifestations.\"\nI have attempted to show that as applied to them the theory\nof suggested hallucination does not cover the whole ground\n(in some cases is even obviously unsatisfactory), and that it\ncannot, by any means, give us an adequate solution of the\nwhole mystery.\nI have left for the end of my examination of the Home\nevidence a case which seems at first sight to present a real\ndifficulty for my argument : I refer to a well-known instance\nwhen a landscape was made visible to several persons in a\ncrystal ball at one of Home's seances. Our chief witness\nis the Master of Lindsay, who says\n:\nAnother time at Mr. Jencken's house I saw a crystal ball placed\non Mr. Home's head emit flashes of coloured light, following the\norder of the spectrum. The crystal was spherical, so that it could\nnot have given prismatic colours. After this it changed, and we\nall saw a view of the sea, as if we were looking down at it from\nthe top of a high cliff. It seemed to be the evening, as the sun was\n\f4G2 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [pakt\nsetting like a globe of fire, lighting up a broad path over the little\nwaves. The moon was faintly visible in the south, and as the sun\nset her power increased. We saw also a few stars and suddenly\nthe whole thing vanished like shutting the slide of a magic lantern;\nand the crystal was dead. This whole appearance lasted about ten\nminutes. . . .\nThere were two candles and a bright fire burning in the room. 1\nAnother gentleman, Mr. J. Hawkins Simpson, has given (in\na letter to Dr. Edmunds, Secretary of the Dialectical Society)\nthe following version of the same episode\n:\nA large landscape view as carried in my brain was made perfectly\nvisible in a spherical crystal to every one in a dark room, although\nthe individuals composing the party occupied places opposite to each\nother, and no one except Mr, Home, who held the crystal, was within\nthree feet of the crystal. . . . Colours were similarly produced,\nthough I could not gather that any brain then present was the\nexciting cause. Every colour of the rainbow was given brilliantly,\nespecially the violet of a very opaque character ; and that (as rapped\nout) \"to show the violet as seen by disembodied spirits.\" 2\nThat is, I believe, all the information we possess regarding\nthis interesting incident. Meagre as it is, we find in the\nstatements coming from our only two witnesses an important\ndiscrepancy. According to one there were in the room two\ncandles and a bright fire burning. The other says the room\nwas dark.\n3\nWe do not know either the names or the number\nof the persons present, nor\u2014which is particularly important\n\u2014\nhow far their impressions actually coincided ; nor how far\nthey were independent of one another ; nor whether the\nmedium spoke or preserved silence ; in fact, we hardly know\nanything beyond the bare fact of the vision. And Mr.\nHawkins Simpson's account in particular is so loose and\nscanty that we do not even feel sure that the two last\nsentences I have quoted refer to the same episode as Lord\nLindsay's.\n1\nDiabetica!, Society's Report, pp. 206-207.\n2\nIbidem, p. 259.\n3\nSo great is the discrepancy, indeed, that I should have thought the two\nwitnesses were referring to two separate incidents did not one \" who ought\nto know'\"\u2014.Mine. Home\u2014explicitly state the contrary (The Gift of D. D.\nHome, p. 252-253).\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 463\nStill, unsatisfactory as the evidence is, it is first-hand testi-\nmony coming from trustworthy witnesses and so cannot be\ndismissed without further consideration. Moreover, Lord\nLindsay and Mr. Simpson's experience is not unique. In a\nvery interesting case printed a few years ago in the S.P.B.\n\u2022Journal} which I will now quote, we have also au instance\nof apparent collective vision in a mirror affecting not less\nthan four persons. The incident occurred in May, 1904, at\n15 , Switzerland, Mrs. C. (a friend) being the medium.\nHere is the evidence of one of the witnesses, Mrs. A., given\nin a letter written shortly after the event to Mrs. H. J.\nWilson, an Associate of the S.P.B., who is intimately\nacquainted with all of them, and who first reported the case\nverbally to Miss Johnson\n:\nIt was in my bedroom at B , Switzerland. Mrs. C was\nthe medium. She was seated facing the long mirror in my ward-\nrobe, and we, that is C. [Mrs. P., sister of Mrs. A.], A. [the\ndaughter of Mrs. A.], Mrs. H., and myself, were seated just be-\nhind her, also facing the mirror. Mrs. C was not in trance.\nIn a very short time we saw my father's face form over Mrs. C.'s\nface (in the mirror), and then S 's face, two or three times fol-\nlowing. She was smiling and looking hard at us, her two sisters.\nThen she faded away, and a long corridor came, with a large hall\nor room at the end of it, brilliantly lighted up. Many figures were\nwalking about, but my figure and E.'s [Mrs. A.'s son] were the\nmost prominent\u2014there was no mistaking them. I recognised my\nown figure walking about, and leaning forward to talk. That was\nall, as it was rather late, and time to go to bed.\nS., the sister of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P., had died in March,\n1904; E., the son of Mrs. A., was living at the time, and\nin London.\nThe account of the other sister, Mrs. P., was dictated by her\nto Mrs. Wilson, and sent to Miss Johnson enclosed in a letter\nfrom Mrs. Wilson, dated October 3rd, 1904. It is as follows:\nIt was at B , about May 1st, 1901, at 8.30 p.m. The elec-\ntric light was full on all the time, shaded only by a piece of silver\ntissue paper. There were present Mrs. C (the medium), Mrs.\nA ,\nA., Mrs. H , and myself. Mrs. C. sat in front of a mirror,\nl\nVol. XII., February, 1905, pp. 17-21.\n\f464 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nMrs. A. and I sat just behind her, and the other two to right and\nleft of us respectively. Behind us was the bedroom wall, and a\nwashing stand against that, with a small mirror over it. The\nmedium was not entranced. I saw S 's face form on Mrs.\nC 's face, followed by that of old Mrs. P . Then came a\nfull-length figure of my father in the mirror, in his robes, very like\nthe portrait. He looked benignant and rested, with lines of face\nmuch smoothed away. This faded, and then all perceived a long\npassage in the mirror, at a guess about 25 feet long, with bay\nwindow at the end, and sunshine streaming through. There was\na window seat, and two figures standing by it, unrecognisable.\nThen third figure appeared, also unrecognisable. They seemed to\nlook out of window and converse. Medium then became tired.\nThe next account, written in October, 1904, is from Miss\nA., and is as follows\n:\nMother, Mrs. C , Aunt C [Mrs. P.], another lady, and\nmyself, were all seated in front of a large pier glass, Mrs. C\n(the medium) being slightly nearer the glass (say 3 inches) than the\nrest of us. The gas was turned down to about half its strength.\nPresently, after sitting ten minutes or so, we saw what appeared to\nbe a white mist rising up in front of the medium's reflection, and it\nfinally resolved into a good and distinct likeness of Grandad. When\nwe recognised it the figure smiled and nodded its head. Then a\nlikeness of Aunt S appeared, not so distinct, but perfectly easy\nof recognition, after which a lady appeared unknown to four of us,\nbut recognised by the lady who was sitting with us.\nFor a time we saw nothing but mist again, but it gradually\ncleared, and a long corridor became visible with a door at the further\nend evidently opened inwards, and screened on the side nearest us\nby looped curtains, through which we saw into a brilliantly lighted\nroom, whether bright sunlight or artificial light we could not tell.\nFigures too distant to be recognised came and went in the room,\nand once a girl in what appeared to be bridal dress stood just be-\nhind the opening of the curtain. Then the doors appeared to be\nshut for a time, but presently opened, and two figures pushed aside\nthe curtains and came down the corridor towards us, talking. We\nrecognised them as Mother and E . Then the picture faded\nagain and we closed the sitting. This is to the best of my recol-\nlection, but as I took no notes at the time, I may easily have\nforgotten details.\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 465\nIn answer to further questions Miss A. writes :\nOctober Uth, 1904.\nThe likenesses were formed on Mrs. C 's image in the glass,\nas it were, transforming her features into those of the persons re-\npresented. Her own face, as distinct from the image, was unchanged,\nexcept that the eyes were closed, while the faces in the glass all\nhad their eyes open. This is an interesting point, I think.\nThe fourth witness, Mrs. H., dictated her account to Mrs.\nWilson in the early part of November, 1904, as follows:\nI first saw the head and shoulders of an old clergyman with grey\nhair\u2014no beard ; he wore the old-fashioned \" Geneva bands \" that the\nclergy used to wear. I did not recognise him, but heard Mrs. P\nand Mrs. A\u2014\u2014 say it was their father. I did not see him on\nthe medium's face, but in a corner of the mirror, apart from the\nmedium. I also heard Mrs. P and Mrs. A say that they\nsaw their sister, but I did not see her. After this we saw a ball-\nroom in the mirror, very brightly lighted, with people walking\nabout in it. I did not recognise any of them. I ought to have\nsaid that at first I saw a curtain across the room, and it was when\nit was withdrawn that I saw the people walking about.\nThe room we were sitting in was lighted by a candle.\nOn this case, the Editor comments as follows\n:\nIt is unfortunate that the witnesses did not record their impressions\nat the time, or immediately afterwards, since it is clear that in some\nrespects their present recollections are not quite correct. Thus Mrs. P.\nsays: \"The electric light was full on all the time, shaded only by a\npiece of silver tissue paper.\" Miss A. says :\n\" The gas was turned\ndown to about half its strength.\" Mrs. H. says :\n\" The room we\nwere sitting in was lighted by a candle.\" One or other of these\ndescriptions must be inaccurate, unless all of them are incomplete.\nIt must however be remembered that we hardly ever find two\npeople giving exactly the same description even of ordinary events,\nand we very seldom have the opportunity of comparing together\nas many as four independent accounts of the same occurrence.\nWhenever we did this, we should probably find quite as much\ndisagreement as in the present case.\nThe position of the medium in relation to the mirror and to the\nsitters is described in very similar terms by Mrs. A., Mrs. P., and\n\f4b'6 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nMisa A., except that Mrs. A. and Mrs. P. say that they sat just\nbehind the medium, while Miss A. describes the medium as being\nonly \"slightly nearer the glass (say 3 ins.) than the rest of us.\"\nWhen we come to the descriptions of the figures seen in the\nmirror, the discrepancies are far more marked. There is, of course,\nno proof of inaccuracy in this, because it is quite possible\u2014not to\nsay probable\u2014that the hallucinations were not the same to all the\npercipients. Miss A. is the only one who describes the appearance\nof a white mist in the mirror preceding the appearance of the\nfigures. (Our readers will remember that this appearance is a familiar\nexperience with crystal-gazers, whether as a preliminary to subjective\nor to veridical visions.) With regard to the individual figures seen :\n(1) As to the father of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P., Mrs. A. and Miss A.\nsay that they saw his face form over Mrs. C.'s face in the mirror,\nMiss A. adding that the figure smiled and nodded its head. Mrs. P.\ndescribes a full-length figure of her father in the mirror, in his robes,\nthe figure having no connection with the medium's reflection in the\nmirror. Mrs. H. describes the head and shoulders of an old clergyman\nwith grey hair and \"Geneva bands,\" \"not on the medium's face,\nbut in a corner of the mirror, apart from the medium.\" (2) The\nsister of Mrs. A. and Mrs. P. was seen by both of them and by\nMiss A. in a similar manner\u2014her face forming over the medium's\nface in the mirror; but not seen at all by Mrs. H. though she\nheard the others saying they had seen it. (3) \" Old Mrs. P.\" is\nmentioned only by Mrs. P. (-f) An unrecognised lady is described\nonly by Miss A. (5) In the scene of the long corridor, with a\nbrilliantly lighted room at the end, and figures walking about in\nit, all the figures were unrecognised, except those of Mrs. A. and\nher son, which were recognised and described (though somewhat\ndifferently) by Mrs. A. herself and her daughter.\nThese various discrepancies may arise either from actual dissimi-\nlarities in the hallucinations, or perhaps from inaccuracies in the\nrecollections of the witnesses, or possibly from a combination of\nboth causes ;\nbut, however this may be, there seems no doubt\nthat the hallucinations were to a great extent similar. The case\nthen affords a striking proof of the possibility\u2014so often denied\n\u2014\nof producing hallucinations in several persons at once by mere\nsuggestion and expectancy, without hypnosis or any such process.\nNo verbal suggestion even was employed by the medium ; for\nMrs. Wilson, having made special enquiries on this point, tells us\nthat Mrs. C. closed her eyes and did not speak during the sitting\n;\n\flvi.J Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 467\nthe sitters, however, did describe what they were seeing to one\nanother during the time of the vision.\nIn considering such a case, however, the question first natur-\nally presents itself: what part did the medium really play in\nthe whole incident ? And was her presence an essential sine\nqua non ? Neither in Home's case nor in Mrs. C.'s do we\nknow whether the medium willed his sitters to see particular\nimages\u2014surely an important circumstance. May not his or her\npart have been mostly passive ? We know of other cases of\ncollective crystal or mirror-vision, sometimes in the absence of\nany recognised medium, and it may be asked whether there is\nafter all so wide a gulf between two such cases as Mrs. C.'s\nand, e.g. Miss Grieve's ?\n1\nThe latter episode seems to me to\nafford some good evidence for thought-transference, since it is\nalleged that both Miss Grieve and her friend preserved silence\nthroughout the vision ; in the former case, on the contrary, the\nsitters described to each other what they were seeing, though\nthe medium did not speak. But whether we admit that\nthought-transference, perhaps helped by verbal suggestion, did\noperate in the case of our four witnesses or not, I repeat we\nhave no evidence that they saw what the medium wanted them to\nsee ; and until we have such evidence, similar cases, however\ninteresting, can hardly prove the possibility of inducing\ncollective hallucinations.\nBut apart from this and in any case, there must surely be a\ndifference between the mental attitudes of two persons, one of\nwhom sees an image in a mirror, while the other beholds a\nscene enacted or a \" form \" moving in a room ; and even\nsupposing some mediums occasionally have power to cause their\nsitters to see images at will, e.g., in the narrow circumscribed\nsphere of a crystal ball (which from the very nature of the\nexperiment these sitters must know to be purely subjective), it\ndoes not necessarily follow that they will have equal success\nwhen dealing with the seance-room instead of a crystal, and\nwhen it comes to making the persons present believe in the\nobjectivity of the forms and of the more or less complicated\nincidents to be seen.\nSuch an inference does not seem to me logically inevitable.\n1\nS.P.E. Journal, Vol. X., Nov. 1901, pp. 134-136.\n\f468 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nDo I therefore positively deny that it is in hallucinatory\nimpressions, more or less deliberately induced by the medium,\nthat we must look for an explanation of some incidents con-\nnected with spiritistic seances ?\nI do not.\nWhen an abnormal impression is experienced by only one\nsitter at a time (whether this sitter is or is not peculiarly liable\nto purely subjective hallucinations) ; when the explanation by\nfraud seems to present serious difficulties, and when we have\nno other positive evidence for the authenticity of the \" pheno-\nmenon \" supposed to have occurred, then I think we are logically\nbound to accept, at least provisionally, the explanation that the\nsitter in question (and may be even many sitters in succession)\nwas subject to a hallucination or to an illusion of the senses.\nLet us take for instance a \" manifestation \" I have often\nwitnessed (and described\nl\n) at the sittings of the late Eussian\nmedium, Sambor. Chairs would be frequently threaded on his\narm without, according to his neighbours, his hands having been\nreleased for a moment. And this would occur almost ad\nlibitum : persons who had never attended a seance in all their\nlife being sometimes equally privileged with the medium's\nhabitue's: men and women, young and old, sceptics and\nbelievers.\nA wide experience of Sambor's sittings left on my mind at\nthe time the impression that this chair-threading was not due\nto conjuring\u2014at least conscious conjuring\u2014on the part of the\nmedium, and that we must search for some other clue. Of\ncourse two explanations only are possible : either we had in this\ncase an instance of the \" passage of matter through matter,\"\nor there must be in the experience a hallucinatory element.\nThe first explanation I now reject, because to believe such\na thing possible one must have incontrovertible proof, and this\nproof we failed to get in the course of our experiments. Nor\ndo I think it has ever been got elsewhere.\nThere remains therefore only one other alternative : as I have\njust said, a hallucinatory element must have come in somewhere.\nEither the sitters, all of them, were mistaken in their impression\nthat a chair was hangins: on So-and-So's arm, when in fact it\n1\nSee Annates des Sciences Psychiques for 1899, 1900, 1902, and 1904 passim,\nand Proceeding* S.P.B., Vol. XXL, pp. 396-7.\n\flvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 4G9\nquietly stood by (an \" explanation \" which I utterly and un-\nhesitatingly reject) ; or the medium's neighbour was mistaken in\nhis conviction that he had not let go Sambor's hand for a\nquarter of a second, and there must have been a moment\nwhen he felt a hand to be in his when in fact there was none.\nSince not only was it to the medium's interest to create\nsuch an erroneous impression, but it can hardly have originated\nspontaneously (in the beginning at least) in the sitter's mind, it\nmust have come, in some way or other, from Sambor. Since no\none, I believe, ever heard him make a corresponding verbal\nsuggestion, the suggestion must have been mentally made ; and\nI may perhaps go one step further and add that I am\nprepared to admit it may have been made unconsciously.1\nImprobable as such an explanation may appear (to specialists\nin hypnotism and suggestion in particular) it is of course a\nthousand times more plausible than the \" passage of matter\nthrough matter \" ; and so there seem to me to be good reasons\nfor holding to it. I will adopt a much simpler one after a\nconjuror has proved to me that unnoticed liberation of a hand\nunder Sambor's conditions is possible, but hardly before.\n2\nIn the present instance we are therefore quite justified,\nlogically, in framing such a theory. But suppose the \" passage\nof matter through matter \" should ever be scientifically\nestablished, our theory would then have to be in all probability\nabandoned as inadequate and unnecessary. But I think such\na day will not come for a long while.\nWhy, it may be asked, did I not admit a similar explanation\nfor the melting of the \" spirit-hands \" at Home's seances ?\nSimply because it would not have helped us to understand\nmany other incidents connected with these same \" spirit-hands.\"\nWhen these incidents have been explained away and nothing\nleft of them, then I am ready to accept a suggested tactile\nhallucination as a very plausible explanation.\n1\nOn this (supposed) suggestion and consequent illusion of the sense of touch\nother hallucinatory impressions\u2014 this time spontaneous\u2014may have sometimes\ngrafted themselves, as in Madame Youdenitch's experience (S.P.P. Proceedings,\nVol. XXI., p. 396, footnote).\n2\nSee also on the same subject my letter in S.P.JR. Journal, Vol. XIII.\n(October, 1908), p. 295, in reply to Mr. Baggally's criticism (supposed premature\nextinguishing of candle).\n2g\n\f470 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nSome episodes connected with \" materialisation \" seances,\nespecially in America, are also quoted sometimes as evidence of\nthe mediums' power to influence their sitters, in a certain sense,\nand engender illusions in them. I refer chiefly to cases of the\nsupposed \" recognition \" of dead relatives and friends. Such\ncases seem to be frequent.\n1\nTo quote Professor H. H. Furness's\nwords :\nIt is, I confess, a very puzzling problem ... to account for\nthe faith, undoubtedly genuine, which Spiritualists have in the\npersonal reappearance of their departed friends. Again and\na\u00b0ain have I asked those who have returned from an inter-\nview with a spirit at the cabinet to their seats beside me\nwhether or not they had recognised their friends beyond a per-\nadventure and have always received an affirmative reply, sometimes\nstrongly affirmative. . . . Again and again men have led round the\ncircle the materialised spirits of their wives and introduced them\nto each visitor in turn ; fathers have taken round their daughters,\nand I have seen widows sob in the arms of their dead husbands.\nTestimony such as this staggers me. Have I been smitten with\ncolour blindness ? Before me, as far as I can detect, stands the\nvery medium herself, in shape, size, form and feature true to a\nline, and yet, one after another, honest men and women at my\nside, within ten minutes of each other, assert that she is the absolute\ncounterpart of their nearest and dearest friend, nay that she IS\nthat friend. 2\nAn instance may be given more at length. Mr. William\nMore of Denver, Colorado, personally known to Miss Johnson,\nwrites to her as follows on September 19th, 1906 :\nAs per your request I herein give you a short account of my\nexperiences some years ago in a series of materialisation seances,\nheld in Denver during the years of 1880 and 1881.\nHave been a resident of Denver continuously since 1879 ; the\nfollowing year my attention was called to the mediumship of a\ncertain Mrs. Miller [now Mrs. Wilcox] then a resident of Denver,\ncoming here from Tennessee, her native State. I also met her father,\nTittle by name, a contractor and builder ; he told me these mani-\nfestations in one phase or another had followed her from infancy.\n1\nSee, for instance, Pnychinche Studien for 1897, for Mr. Aksakoff's description\nat great length of one such case with Mme. rt'Esperance.\n2\nSeybert Commission's Report, pp. 150, 151.\n\flvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 471\nThis is the medium referred to by Bishop Watson of the South\nMethodist Church, and who published his experiences in a series\nof books entitled The Clock struck one, two, three, etc. However, the\nphases which came to my attention were materialisation and de-\nmaterialisation, these varying all the way from personation and\ntransfiguration to the clear independent form. The personnel of\nthe circle contributed largely towards success or failure in produc-\ning the highest phase, viz., \"distinct independent form materialisation.\"\nHave seen the conditions so poor that personation of the entranced\nmedium alone could be had ; but often that phase furnished remark-\nable tests as to character and personal traits of the communicating-\nspirit. The first circle I attended, I assisted Mr. Miller to put up\nthe cabinet, which was a simple four-sided screen, made of dark\ngrey blankets hung on a rough wood frame ; the blankets hanging\nso as to part in front. In the cabinet was a lounge or chair\nfor the entranced medium to recline on. Mrs. Miller was searched\nby a committee of ladies, who certified that both her outer and\nunderclothing was entirely black, then a minute search was made\nof the cabinet and surroundings; windows and doors sealed, the\nmedium tied and light shaded. After singing some familiar song\nor hymn, the voice of Eed Face, the Indian control, generally spoke\nout loud and distinct. Then faces and hands were plainly seen,\nas well as balls of light on the carpet and round the room. These\nlight balls often showed faces, and later on full forms would shape\nthemselves and disappear in front of us.\nWhen the full power had been attained, Eed Face called the\nindividual sitters wanted by the spirit to the cabinet ;\nthey entering\nand generally finding the medium entranced. When I was called,\nI shook hands with the form of a lady, who seemed greatly distressed\nthat I did not at once recognise her; sobbing she said, \"William,\ndon't you know your mother 1\n?\" Her voice then sunk so low I\ncould not hear, and she moved towards a stand where there was\npaper and pencil, but before she wrote anything the pencil dropped\nfrom her hand, and she and I stooped down to search for it ; but\nthe excitement attendant on meeting me broke her down so much\nthat she requested feebly to be assisted back to the cabinet. From\nthe time she left the cabinet till she retired back, she leaned\nheavily on my shoulder, and I felt this weight up to the front of the\ncabinet, when she dematerialised suddenly. Later at other seances\nhave seen her walk stronger, but always very lame. Neither Mrs.\nMiller nor any other person in Denver were aware that my father\n\f472 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nhad married twice, and that the lady then known as Mrs. More was\nnot my mother, as I nor anyone in the family had ever mentioned\nit, nor that my mother had died after losing a limb on the operating\ntable. All this, together with expressions and peculiar mannerisms,\nconvinced me that this was really my mother. Another circle I\nwas present at ; after the routine opening work, the form of a\nyoung man apparently about eighteen or twenty years old came\nand shook hands with me. I disclaimed his acquaintance, but he\nassured me that he had seen me at several public meetings, and\nhis name was Van Scotten. I replied, \"Why, you are only out of\nthe body little over two months, and I know your father and\nmother well.\" He said, \"That is the reason I came to you, and\nplease tell them I am all right, and no need to grieve for me.\" For\nthe previous few seconds I felt his hands slowly drawing from\nmine, which soon became a strong pull, I keeping m}^ eyes on him\nsteadily all the while ; and there in front of me was the form and\nfeatures of the young man changing rapidly to that of Mrs. Miller\nthe medium ; a clear case of transfiguration. The light was strong\nenough to see the form and clothing distinctly, of first the young\nman and [then the] gradual change to that of Mrs. Miller. Again\nI have seen her arm thrust through a chair or other solid article\nof furniture, and when I grasped her hand the arm seemed to\ndematerialise, while the chair or other article fell off. Then I have\nseen the objectifying of lace and white embroidered garments, by\nthe temporary forms or the entranced medium \u2022 yard after yard\nof fine delicate lace made generally from a small nucleus of white\nlight in the palm of the hand; piece after piece of the wonderful\nfabric handed to the sitters, with the injunction to hold on to it,\nbut two minutes or less was the limit they could retain it. This\nwas done to illustrate how the white garments of the ladies as well\nas the magnificent robes of bishops and clowns succeeded each other\nin dazzling array at these remarkable sittings.\nWilliam More.\nMiss Johnson adds :\nI met Mr. More, who is a convinced Spiritualist, and had a long\ntalk with him about his experiences. I cross-questioned him\nespecially about the case of \" transfiguration \" when the form and\nfeatures of the young man changed into those of Mrs. Miller. He\nassured me that he saw the young man's face in a perfectly clear\nand distinct manner; there could be no doubt but that it was a\nman's face; and he spoke like a man. It was while he was\n\fLVI.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 473\nactually looking into the face that he saw the change come over it,\nas it turned into the face of Mrs. Miller, which he then saw as\nclearly and distinctly as he had seen the man's face.\nI enquired about the clothing of the form. Mr. More said the\nyoung man was dressed in ordinary man's clothes, but when the\nform changed into that of Mrs. Miller, he saw that she was wearing\nordinary woman's clothing and not drapery of any kind.\nAlice Johnson.\nMany more instances of the kind might of course be adduced.\nIn estimating their evidential value we must first of all bear\nin mind the circumstance that the presumption against the\ngenuineness of professional \" materialisation \" seances in America\nis overwhelming. In view of this fact we should, I think,\nneither attach particular importance to prima facie enigmatic\nincidents scattered here and there in the sitters' accounts\n(unless these accounts be drawn up by persons peculiarly\nqualified), nor credit the so often exposed trickster who styles\nhimself a materialising medium with any genuine uncommon\npower without very serious reasons. Fraud without any\nadmixture is the most probable explanation, which must be\nabandoned only when irresistibly proved to have been inadequate.\nAs for the \" recognitions \" themselves, I see no reason to\nthink that, in most cases at least, the medium himself or\nherself does not play in them a purely passive part. My\ngrounds for this opinion are that these '''\nrecognitions \" at\nmaterialising seances are precisely similar to \" recognitions \" in\nthe domain of so-called \" spirit-photography,\" where it is certain\nthat, in many cases at least, the illusion which gave rise to\nthe identification of a photograph as the image of a departed\nfriend sprang from the sitter himself without any prompting-\nwhatever from any one. 1\nNot only so, but we even know\nthat after Buguet, the famous French \" spirit photographer,\" had\nconfessed in the course of his trial that he had practised trickery\nthroughout, many, if not most of his dupes, found it impossible\nto relinquish their faith, on the ground that they had obtained\nat their sittings with him unmistakable likenesses of those\ndear to them. When we take into account that the conditions\n1\nSee on the subject the chapter on \"Spirit Photography\" in Mr. Podmore's\nModern Spiritualism and Mrs. Sidgwick's article in Proceedings S.P.E.,\nVol. VII., p. 268.\n\f474 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [pakt\nunder which these \" spirit-photographs \" were generally taken\nwere far less sensational and awe-inspiring than those of a\nsitting for materialisation (and, I believe, were even sometimes\ntaken in the sitters' absence and sent them by post), I find\nthat such \" recognitions \" a tete reposic, and to which the\nSpiritualists in question afterwards so obstinately clung under\nthe prosaic conditions of every-day life, are much more to be\nwondered at than those taking place under far more propitious\ncircumstances from the emotional point of view : only imagine\n\" the darkened room, the music, the singing, the pervading hush\nof expectation, the intensely concentrated attention, the strained\ngaze at the dark cabinet and at its white-robed apparitions. ...\" 1\nNo wonder at all if under such circumstances a strongly\nmarked illusion, if not a pure hallucination, occurs now and\nthen, and the sitter really and truly believes himself to be-\nhold a deceased friend or relation true to a line, and then,\nwhen his state of emotion has begun to subside, thinks (as\nin Mr. More's case) that he really sees the features of the\napparition gradually merge into those of the medium.2\nSuch\n1\nSeybert Commission's Report, p. 151.\n2\nHere is a case where such an impression of \" transfiguration \" was obviously\npurely spontaneous. Mr. W. B. Hodgson, a young journalist, writes to Miss\nJohnson (to whose kindness I am indebted for this case also) on May 23rd, 1905 :\n\" The experience I mentioned in our conversation the other day happened\nabout seven years ago.\nI was in the office of a newspaper in the City, the room being on the top\nfloor with large windows, so that the light was good. The door opened,\nand some one entered. As he must have passed through the outer office the\npresumption was that it was some one I knew. I looked at him and jumped\nto the conclusion that it was a friend I had not seen for a long time. . . .\nI rose, walked towards him with hand stretched out, and welcomed him. I\nseemed to see the face of my friend quite clearly. But as I got within a yard\nor so, the face of my friend seemed visibly to melt, and the outlines of the\nfeatures to fuse as though they had been wax before a strong fire. For an\ninstant there was chaos, and then there emerged the features of a total stranger,\nand I saw I had been mistaken.\nThe mistake strongly impressed me at the time, especially the way in which\nthe features of my friend suddenly seemed to flow into the new form of the\nstranger. I suppose that upon some trivial point of resemblance (which I was\nunable to identify) I had built up a mental image which lasted till the\nimpression of the real approaching face grew too strong to be denied.\nAt this distance of time I cannot recall the name of the imaginary friend,\nnor the business of the real stranger\u2014only the one fact of the apparent\n'fusing' of the features. I suffer from myopia and astigmatism, and use\nslightly concave glasses for distant vision. ...\"\n\flvi.] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 475\nfacts are not open to doubt, but what we want to know is,\nwhether they may not be of a purely spontaneous character\nrather than of external origin ; and whether they can assume a\ncollective character.\nComparison of \" recognitions \" in the realm of spirit photo-\ngraphy and in that of materialisation conclusively shows us,\nI think, that we need not necessarily look to such an external\norigin for an explanation.\nStill, that repeated verbal suggestion, especially with \" trained\n\"\nsitters, can occasionally, as might a priori be expected, bring\nabout some positive results, I do not deny ; and beg to refer\nthe reader in this connection to Professor Harlow Gale's \" Study\nin Spiritistic Hallucinations,\" printed in the Proceedings S.P.P.,\nVol. XY., pp. 65-82. But I think that any impartial reader,\nafter studying the evidence adduced by Professor Gale, will agree\nwith me that on the whole these results are meagre, and cannot\nin any degree bear comparison with the incidents of an ordinary\nseance for physical phenomena or \" materialisation.\"\n1\nOn the whole, therefore, though I think there is some\nevidence that in certain cases false sense-perceptions can shape\nand colour the sitter's impressions at a spiritistic seance, I do\nnot think we must generalise from such incidents, or that we\nshould build on them a theory of such \" phenomena \" as\nHome's.\nAnd though I do not deny that such false sense-perceptions\ncan occasionally be induced from without, i.e. by the medium,\nI see every reason to believe that very similar illusions can\noriginate in men and women under conditions which practically\nexclude the possibility of external suggestion.\nStill, in some very exceptional cases (e.g. that of Sambor's\nchair-threading) I am ready to admit that illusion induced by the\nmedium is the most reasonable explanation, but I admit it only\nprovisionally, and because on the one hand the possibility of\nconjuring under such conditions does not seem to me sufficiently\n1\nThus some of \"Dr. S.'s\" (the medium's) habituds saw figures equally well\nwith hands held before the eyes, or with eyes closed ; some never saw any-\nthing ; others would see the \"face transfiguration\" only \"on fixating with\neffort and extreme tension;\" some had already seen \"figures\" before making\nDr. S.'s acquaintance (pp. 77-79). I think it may be said in all impartiality\nthat the residuum left after all this discounting is small, when al the accompany-\ning circumstances are taken into account.\n\f476 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nproved, and, on the other, because we have, broadly speaking, no\nother evidence (I mean, no irrefutable evidence) of the occurrence\nof the phenomenon in question.\nAs for the possibility of the medium being able to induce\na collective hallucination in several sitters in the waking state\nat once, I see no good evidence for it. Barring, as I said\nin the beginning of my paper, and for the reasons there specified,\nEastern conjuring, I see no reason to think that any one has\never been able to make a roomful of people, or even three or four\npersons believe (if sitting in the light) that he was holding-\nred-hot coals or floating in the air, if in fact he was doing\nnothing of the kind. I do not think we have any grounds\nfor admitting that Home could have caused Lords Lindsay and\nAdare and Captain Wynne to see him outside the window when\nhe was inside the room, nor that he could have caused three\npersons to see the form of his late wife leaning against him,\nif all around him there was but empty space. Let us remember\nthat in his case alone, to mention no others, such an assumption\nhas been repeatedly proved to stand in direct contradiction to\nfacts. And before believing anything of the kind possible we\nmust insist on new and good evidence.\nThe hallucination hypothesis should also, I think, be avoided\nunless urgently necessary for another reason. Once we have\nadmitted it (or at least the hypothesis of collective and induced\nhallucination) in one case, we see that, unless we refuse to be\nconsistent and do not draw a purely arbitrary line somewhere\nquite illogically, it will quickly lead us into the region of infinite\ndoubt. If a medium can cause several sitters to believe they\nsee a materialised hand where there is only \" viewless air\n;\n\"\nor that they behold him floating in space when he has not\nleft his chair, we are logically bound to infer that he may\nalso prevent their seeing some actions of his or even his own\nperson,\u2014may, in fact, induce in them not only positive, but\nalso negative hallucinations. For I wonder on what grounds\nwe could declare such a thing impossible ? I consequently\nsubmit that, if Nikolaeff was able to engender in his six sitters\nthe belief that they saw luminous hands first gradually forming\nthemselves, then floating in the air, and heard these hands\ndeal vigorous blows in different places when nothing of the\nkind really occurred, he might have been equally able to prevent\n\flvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 477\nthem from seeing how he himself pulled off the silk lamp-shade\nand threw it towards the six doctors. So must Home have\nbeen able to induce in his clients the belief that certain actions\n(for instance, \" direct writing \" in Mr. Burr's case) were per-\nformed under their eyes by materialised hands, when in fact\nhe did these things himself, merely suggesting a negative\nhallucination to the persons present. Why is one supposition\nmore improbable than the other ? But see to what straits we\nshould finally be driven if we adopt this one. In a region\nwhere serious investigation worthy of the name is already so\ndifficult, not to say almost impossible, we shall finally hopelessly\nentangle ourselves in the factitious obstacles we are cheerfully\nraising with a fertility of imagination\u2014I think, misdirected\n\u2014\nwhich may well evoke admiration.\nFor my own part I lay it down as a general proposition,\n\u2014\nand I consider that I am entitled to it, not only by the every-\nday experience of mankind for many centuries, but also by\nthe study of these so-called \" Physical Phenomena,\" whether\nfraudulent or genuine,\u2014that the testimony of several sane,\nhonest and intelligent eye-witnesses is, broadly speaking, proof\nof the objectivity of any phenomenon. If there are people\nwho maintain an opposite view, why, let them make experiments\nthemselves.\nThere may be and often is on the part of these several\neye-witnesses misinterpretation of the object seen ; distortion\n(in the retrospect) of the impressions primarily received ;.\noccasionally a pure hallucination of memory perhaps ;\nbut, I\nrepeat, I do not think we have serious grounds for believing\nthey can be made to see something non-existent. Nor do\n1 think we are entitled to suppose that such \" misinterpretation\n\"\nof a real scene or object can assume in several persons\n(intelligent and sane !) such gigantic proportions as, for instance,\nto make them mistake a man who simply \" thrust his head\nand shoulders out of the window\n\" 1\nfor a man floating in the\nair outside the window. For what, I ask, would be the difference\nbetween such an \"illusion\" and a pure \"hallucination?\" Evidence\nthat such things are possible may be forthcoming some day.\nAs yet I see very little of it.\nBut, it may be asked, did I not say at the beginning of my\n1\nMr. Podmore's Studies in Psychical Research, p. 121.\n\f478 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\npaper that no one who has studied the evidence collected by\nthe S.P.R. can doubt the existence of collective hallucinations ?\nNor do I doubt it. But these are hallucinations either\nspontaneously originating in one person and transmitted, so\nto say, to another, or telepathically induced by a third person\nat a distance. And then, il faut nous entendre. Personally\nI should not be at '\nall disinclined to invite those who shared\nin such a strange and collective experience to prove that it\nwas of a hallucinatory character, though such a request could\nhardly be complied with in most cases. And I should have\nmade my invitation especially pressing in connection with\ncertain cases of \" apparitions \" seen in haunted houses. If\nI agree to call them hallucinatory, it is on my part almost\nexclusively a matter of courtesy !\n1\nWere I now asked whether, if I decline to explain away\nby false sense-perception most of the cases mentioned in my\npaper, it must follow that I fully believe in their genuineness,\nI should certainly answer :\n\" No.\"\nImpressed as I am, in common, I believe, with all serious\nstudents of the subject, with much of the Home evidence, I\ncannot but think that it presents serious drawbacks. The\nremoteness of the \"incidents\" and the impossibility of repetition\nwhere there is such urgent need for it ; the almost unlimited\npossibilities of conjuring ; the numberless exposures of other\nmediums ; the fact that a great many and probably most of\nHome's clients seem to have been by no means scientifi-\ncally qualified for an investigation of his claims, and that\ntheir testimony may be worth not more than that of many\nSpiritualists of the present day, which we are bound to reject\nwithout hesitation (for in this curious region the most positive\nstatement coming from the most honourable and \u2014in general\nworldly matters\u2014the most sane man may be absolutely value-\nless) ; the part which may have been played now and then\n'\"This hypothesis [\"that the apparition is something belonging to the\nexternal world\"; \"that like ordinary matter it occupies and moves through\nspace\"] involves us in many difficulties. . . . Nevertheless I am bound to\nadmit that there is some little evidence tending to suggest this theory. For\ninstance ... A considerable amount of clear evidence to the appearance of\nghosts to independent observers in successive points in space would certainly\nafford a strong argument for their having a definite relation to space \" (Mrs.\nSidgwick in Proceedings S.P.B., Vol. III., p. 146).\n\flvl] Hallucination Theory of Physical Phenomena. 479\nby practical joking\n;\n1\nthe frequent looseness of the conditions\nat the sittings (in many cases it is practically certain Home\ncould have imposed any conditions he chose) ;\nfinally, the\nfact that even his career, however different in this respect\nfrom that of other physical mediums, is not entirely free\nfrom suspicious incidents :\n\u2014all these circumstances stand very\nmuch in the way of our definitely accepting Home's phenomena\nas genuine. And as years roll by and no worthy successor\nof his appears on the public stage ; as new and hitherto\nunsuspected sources of error spring into view ; as the general\nunreliability in such matters of almost all persons except\nspecially qualified experts becomes more and more obvious,\n2\nscepticism appears more and more legitimate and natural,\neven when it extends to facts in the past which may have\nseemed impregnable for many a decade.\nIt seems to me that for very obstinate disbelievers in\n\" Physical Phenomena \" such a line of argument (though I\ndo not say I am quite in sympathy with it) may yet prove\nmore fruitful than a theory built, so to say, \" in the air,\"\nand for which support is to be sought in some measure even\nin the cabinet of the American materialising medium !

Still that frequent\nunreliability of unpaid mediums is both curious and dis-\nheartening !\nM. Schilkine writes :\nAwil, 1906.\nDurant les hivers des annees 1896 et 1897 nous avions forme un\npetit cercle, arm d'observer les phenomenes spirites, dans une serie\nde seances organisees avec toute la circonspection que ce genre\nd'etude necessite. Outre les soussignes, nous admettions parfois dans\nnos reunions des personnes de notre connaissance et notamment\nun jeune officier du regiment de Novotcherkask, M. P. K., tue en\n1905 a Mukden. M. K. paraissait done d'une force mediumique\nconsiderable et donnait pendant nos seances les signes caracteristiques\nde la transe mediumique. Le probleme que nous nous etions pro-\npose, entre autres, etait d'obtenir le mouvement des objets par la\nforce mediumique seule, sans contact et dans des conditions qui\nexcluraient toute incertitude quant a la realite et l'authenticite des\nmanifestations. Nous employions pour nos experiences une petite\ntable a trois pieds. Au debut, les mouvements ne se produisaient\nqu'avec le contact de nos mains unies en chaine mediumique. Dans\nla suite, sans rompre la chaine, nous essayames de lever nos mains\nde dessus la table, en priant les esprits d'en continuer le mouvement.\nNous avons reussi a l'avoir, mais presque toujours dans une obscurite\nplus ou moins complete. Nous constations le mouvement, soit au\nbruit que les pieds de la table faisaient en glissant sur le parquet,\nsoit au contact dont elle effleurait nos genoux et nos pieds,\npendant ses oscillations. Souvent la table tombait sur les genoux\nde quelqu'un d'entre nous, se relevait pour retomber sur ceux d'une\nautre personne, et ainsi de suite. Lorsque le phenomene faiblissait\nnous remettions nos mains sur la table pour lui communiquer la\nforce necessaire, et les mouvements reprenaient aussitot.\nEnfin, a l'une des seances de l'annee 1896 (nos souvenirs varient\nentre les dates du 28 octobre et du 18 novembre) sur le conseil des\n\" esprits \" obtenu au moyen du proced6 de l'alphabet, nous avons\nallume une lanterne rouge (de celles qui servent pour le developpe-\nment des plaques photographiques), et nous avons vu les mouvements\nde la table, libre de tout contact. La seance avait lieu dans le\nlogement de MM. Schilkine, et dans la piece, oil la manifestation\ns'est produite, en plus des soussignes, se trouvait M. P.

Les soussignes\nse tenaient debout autour de la table, les mains en chaine mediumique\net elevees d'un demi-metre au-dessus de la table. Nous nous voyions\nde la tete aux pieds et ne pouvions manquer de nous convaincre que\nrien ni personne ne touchait a la table. A notre priere, les mouve-\nments se produisirent ; la table glissa sur le parquet, en se penchant\nde tous les cotes, comme si elle prenait son elan. \u2014enrin elle se\nsoiileva completement de terre, de ses trois pieds, et se maintint a\nune hauteur de dix a vingt centimetres, pendant deux, trois secondes.\nNous avons remarque que le mouvement de nos mains en l'air\navivait celui de la table, en la dirigeant du cote voulu.\nCette manifestation ne se repeta plus dans des conditions de\ncontrole aussi scrupuleusement certaines.\n(1) Extract from M. Schilkine's letter to me, dated May 1 [14] 1906.\nI send you an account of our experiments on table-movements. . . .\nFor the complete truth of all we have written down we can vouch.\nWe have also recalled many interesting things, partly even written\ndown at the time by Mme.

Schilkine's letter to me, dated May 2\/15.\nThe late K. did, in fact, confess to us having, by way of a joke,\nsimulated mediumistic phenomena in some circle (some relations of\nhis, I think, so as to \"scare\" old people: I cannot recall it for\ncertain) ; still with us he always was extremely serious, and seemed\nto value much the reputation of an interesting medium. This did\nnot prevent us from suspecting in some cases that precisely in order\nto sustain his reputation he, like apparently most other mediums,\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of acting as an assistant to\nthe spirits\u2014 and a more eager one than from our standpoint would\nhave seemed desirable. Still, I must honestly confess that K. was\nnever directly caught simulating phenomena; and our suspicions\nare based on the same \"internal conviction\" as many suspicions about\nother mediums with whom I had experiences later on together\nwith you.\nTTherkse Zakrzevska.\n(Signed) -\nD. Schilkine.\n\f482 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nAs for the table phenomenon we have described in particular\u2014it\nis positively impossible to suspect K. of anything in this case : he\nwas too far away from the table, and owing to the conditions of\nthe seance, and to the carefulness of the control (which was the\ngreater, since we always had in view the inclination to \" augment\n\"\nphenomena proper to mediums), it is quite impossible to suppose\nsome mechanical appliances with which K. could have moved and\nraised into the air the table 1\nfrom a distance. The table was ours\n(it is in my rooms still); during the phenomenon we were rather\nclosely surrounding it, there was light in the room. The most adroit\nconjuror could not have done anything under these conditions.\nThe seance described is precisely interesting in this\u2014that even if\nthree persons out of those present had agreed by combined endeavours\nto deceive the fourth, it is my profound conviction that they would\nnot have succeeded in producing the phenomenon of table-moving\nin the way it occurred.\nIt must be noted that K.'s presence at our sittings was not a\nnecessary condition of their success. We had phenomena without\nhim ; but the \"physical\" phenomena proper were rarer and weaker.\nAt first K. sat with us in the chain. Once the \"spirits\" demanded\nthat he should sit at a distance outside the chain. We were glad\nit was so, and later on we generally insisted that sittings should\ntake place precisely in this wr\nay (of course when there was enough\nlight in the room to see the sitters).\nIn conclusion I will take the liberty to reassert that if we were\nof \" sound mind and firm memory \" 2\nduring the seance described,\nthe movements of the table must undoubtedly be considered as\noccurring without any contact whatsoever. . . .\nD.

The former\nrecounts the facts from the more objective point of view of the\nman of science; the latter from the more subjective point of\nview of the cultivated man interested in philosophy and religion.\nHence it is the latter case that affords us the best insight\ninto the psychology of the sitter, and Lord Adare's Experiences\nin Spiritualism with Air. D. D. Home is a valuable psycho-\nlogical document, for in the long series of events happening\nto one person, and recorded by him pretty fully and almost\ncontemporaneously, enough details are given to show us, as it\nappears to me, how his mind became gradually educated under\nthe influence and by the suggestions of the medium. \" And\n\f484 Alice Johnson. [part\nif these things are done in the green tree, what shall be done\nin the dry ?\n\" To illustrate my arguments, therefore, I use\nchiefly instances taken from Lord Adare's book.\nBut first one remark is necessary to guard against possible\nmisapprehensions. It is difficult to obtain an unimpassioned\nhearing for the hypothesis that a certain number of alleged\nphysical phenomena can be explained as hallucinations or illu-\nsions experienced by the sitters, because there are still many\npersons who cannot disabuse themselves of the idea that to\nsuggest that a man has had a hallucination is tantamount to\nan accusation of want of mental balance. It is of course true\nthat some persons of unbalanced mind are liable to hallucina-\ntions, though many other unbalanced persons are not. But it\nis equally true, and must be well known to readers of Phantasms\nof the Living and of our Proceedings that many of those who\nhave experienced hallucinations are at least up to the average\nof mankind in intellectual capacity and sanity. \" Calculating\nboys \" are sometimes imbecile ; but we should not argue from\nthat that the mathematical faculty was in itself a morbid\nsymptom. Hallucinations, too, are occasionally associated with\nmorbid physical conditions, but in that case they are\ngenerally of different types from those which occur to people\nin normal conditions.\n1\nIn fact, the process of hallucination is in itself, as Mr.\nMyers insists in his chapter on \" Sensory Automatism \" in\nHuman Personality, an expansion of a natural faculty\u2014the\nfaculty for visualising or externalising ideas that exist con-\nsciously or subconsciously in the mind ; and this faculty may\nbe utilised as a means of psychological study. We have\nnow come to the stage at which motor automatism may be\nconsidered on its own merits. If it is said that a member\nof the S.P.B. Council writes automatically, the statement is\nnot supposed to convey a covert insult to that member. Why\nshould it be thought more insulting to suggest that a member\nof the Council or of any other scientific body may visualise\nautomatically ?\nCertain kinds of visual automatisms may, it is true, be\nattributed to such a person without offence. It would be\n1\nSee Mr. Piddiugton's review of Dr. Head's Goulstonian Lectures for 1901,\nin the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XIX. p. 267.\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 485\npermissible to say that he had seen an apparition of an\nabsent friend, i.e., that he had seen a person who was\nnot there. It should then be equally permissible to suggest\nthat if he saw a person suspended in the air, that person\nmight have been standing on the ground. For, whereas\nthe first case would be a hallucination, the second would only\nbe an illusion ;\nthat is, in the first case the perception would\nbe much more at variance with the external facts than in the\nsecond. The fact is that every one may occasionally experience\na hallucination, and every one is constantly liable to illusions\n;\nand no intellectual discredit can attach to either. The question\nof intellectual capacity comes in only in relation to inferences\ndrawn from one's perceptions.\nHere we touch on the fundamental difference between the\nevidence for psychical and that for physical phenomena. In the\nformer case, we are dealing primarily with mental impressions ;\nin the latter with the inferences drawn from mental impressions\nas to external physical facts. The latter case, then, introduces\nmany possibilities of error which cannot occur in the former.\nI have argued this point fully in my paper on \" Sittings for\nPhysical Phenomena in America \" (Proceedings, Part LIV., pp.\n128-131) and need not repeat it here.\nIn the purely psychical cases, people do not as a rule draw wrong-\ninferences as to external facts. The man who sees an apparition\nis not likely to infer that the person represented by it is actually\npresent, because such a mistake could generally be easily corrected.\nHe is only concerned in the first instance with his own mental\nimpression, and this can be ascertained and noted before and\nindependently of any enquiry as to the relation it may or may\nnot have with some external event, such as the death of the\nperson represented. If, however, our hypothetical percipient\nsees a man rise unsupported in the air, his first thought might\nnaturally be to infer that the man did rise, and the burden of\nthe enquiry is at once shifted to the question whether this\ninference is correct. We cannot here first note the mental\nimpression and then go on independently to examine the external\nfact to which it is supposed to correspond, for there may be\nno evidence for the fact beyond the mental, impression.\nConsequently it is, as a rule, much more difficult to prove\nthat an alleged \" physical phenomenon \" has taken place than\n2h\n\f486 Alice Johnson. [part\nto prove, say, a case of telepathy ; for the former depends much\nmore often than the latter on the unsupported testimony of the\nsenses.\nIn ordinary life we are constantly testing and correcting the\ndirect testimony of our senses through the repetition of experi-\nences under varying conditions, so that by striking a sort of\naverage, we get a roughly reliable result. In the case of\n\" physical phenomena \" there may often be no opportunity for\nthe necessary tests or corrections, and consequently grave reason\nto distrust the pronouncement of the senses regarding them.\nIn order to establish any new facts, it is necessary to criticise\nthe evidence as stringently as possible. The superficial observer\nis apt to think that criticism tends to discourage the worker and\nto confine and obstruct advance. I believe that in the long run\nits effect is exactly the reverse. I believe that by the severity\nof our criticism of the evidence for telepathy from the living and\nfrom the dead we have actually both stimulated its production\nand improved its quality. It seems to me therefore worth while\nto point out certain flaws in what has generally been regarded as\nthe best evidence for physical phenomena, in the hope that fresh\nevidence free from the flaws inherent in this may be forthcoming.\nComing to the consideration of concrete cases, we find com-\nparatively few to which the hypothesis of hallucination can be\napplied ; the more practical question is whether illusions, which\nare of course far commoner than hallucinations, cannot account\nfor a good many of the cases that are not to be explained by\nfraud.\nHome's \" Spirit-hands.\"\nIn the case of Home's \" spirit-hands,\" Count Solovovo argues\nthat, though certain features (especially the fact that they\nwere sometimes invisible to some of the persons present) sug-\ngested that they were hallucinatory, others (notably the fact\nthat objects were often moved by them from one place to\nanother) seemed to show that, whether fraudulent or genuine,\nthey were objective. Yet the hands that moved objects were\nalso occasionally invisible to some persons present. This\n\u2014\naccording to Count Solovovo\u2014tends to prove that in all cases,\neven when invisible, the \" spirit-hands \" were objective.\n\flvl] The Education of the Sitter. 487\nI should like to point out, first, the a priori difficulties\nof regarding these hands as genuinely supernormal. One\nhesitates to accept the alleged facts of \" materialisation\n\"\nbecause it is entirely contrary to ordinary experience that\nmatter should suddenly become organised and as suddenly\nbecome disorganised and dissipated from no apparent cause.\nConsequently, a great deal of excellent evidence would be\nrequired to justify a belief in such a fact.\nStill, in the case of some of the spirit-hands referred to by\nCount Solovovo, the temporary organism, so long as it exists,\nbehaves like any other matter. Thus, the hand carries a\nflower across the room\u2014as any other hand might\u2014over-\ncoming apparently by its own muscular force the force of\ngravity and the resistance of the air. Then it apparently\ndissolves into nothing.\nBut we meet with an altogether different problem and a\nphenomenon still more remote from our ordinary experience\nwhen we find that the spirit-hand that carries the flower\nappears to one person like a hand, to another like a luminous\ncloud, while to a third it is invisible altogether. Here is a\nkind of matter which is not only temporary in character\u2014\na\nfact in itself extraordinary enough\u2014but exhibits another quite\nunprecedented characteristic in the arbitrary selectiveness of\nits effects on other matter. In order to be visible at all, it\nmust reflect light. How does it manage to reflect light that\naffects the retina of one person and not the retina of another ?\nWe may reply that the difference must lie in the retinae, one\nbeing more sensitive than the other. But we do not find the\nsame difference of sensitivity in regard to the light reflected\nfrom ordinary objects. It seems to follow then that the light\nreflected from the spirit-hancl is a peculiar kind of light, lying\noutside the limits of the ordinary visible spectrum. But in\nthat case, why is not the person with the more sensitive\nretina constantly affected by it ? For of course all ordinary\nobjects are constantly giving off radiations outside the limits of\nthe visible spectrum ; but our supposed sensitive apparently\ndoes not perceive them.\nWe then seem driven to suppose that not only does the\nspirit-hand consist of matter of a temporary kind, but that\nwhile it exists, it exhibits all sorts of unaccountable excep-\n\f488 Alice Johnson. [part\ntions to the ordinary behaviour of matter, for each one of\nwhich we have to postulate a separate explanation, while\nfor none of these explanations is there any evidence beyond\nthe special facts which it is called in to explain.\nAdmitting, however, that the \" spirit-hands \" that moved\nobjects were objective, if only temporarily so, let us consider\nwhether the different impressions they produced on different\nsitters were not due to these latter being differently situated\nfor normal perception.\nIn the first case (apart from the statements of Home) quoted\nby Count Solovovo, the room being \" lighted by means of two\nspirit lamps with soda flames placed on the top of the gaselier\"\n(Proceedings, Vol. VI. p. 116), Lady Crookes saw a hand\nappear from under the table between her and Home carrying\na piece of grass 1 5 ins. long, \u2022\nwith which it tapped her\nshoulder. The other sitters only saw the grass moved, but\nfrom their position, as shown in the plan (on p. 115), it seems\nprobable that the hand would normally have been hidden\nfrom them by the table or by Home himself intervening.\nIn the second case (pp. cit. p. 120), the room being-\nilluminated by two spirit-lamps (as stated on p. 117), or by\nthree (as stated on p. 118), Lady Crookes was the only one\nto see the hand touching the flower in Home's button-hole\n;\nbut as she was sitting next to him, she must have been\nin the most favourable position for seeing it.\nAgain, at the same seance (p. 121) \"a hand was seen by\nsome and a luminous cloud by others, pulling the flowers\nabout.\" The mention here of a \"luminous cloud,\" and on\nthe previous page of a \" luminous hand,\" suggests that the\nlight given by the two (or three) spirit-lamps must have\nbeen very dim, or this luminous appearance could hardly have\nbeen perceived. Here again it seems possible that the varying\nimpressions of the sitters may have been due simply to some\nhaving better sight than others, or being in a better position\nfor seeing.\nAnd so on through all the cases referred to by Count\nSolovovo. If these hands had been completely invisible to\nsome person with normal sight looking directly at them in\na good light, we should then have good evidence that they\nwere hallucinatory. The amount of variation in their appear-\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 489\nance does not seem to me to show that there was anything\nabnormal about them, i.e. anything inconsistent with the\nsupposition that -they were either Home's own hands or dummy\nhands.\nThis, in fact, seems to be practically Count Solovovo's view.\nAs he remarks, we have at least one very suspicious case\non record (that recorded by Mr. Merrifield in the Journal\nS.P.E., Vol. XI. p. 76, May 1903); and I do not remem-\nber any case in which the hands were observed by touch as\nwell as by sight to be completely detached, except in the\naccount by Mr. Burr, quoted by Count Solovovo.\nAnd in this connection it seems to me very significant that\nthere is such a marked difference between the account written\n\u2014or at all events published\u2014in 1863 (in Home's Incidents\nin My Life, pp. 59-61), eight years after the event, and\nthat written in 1887, thirty-two years after the event. The\nincidents seem to have grown amazingly in Mr. Burr's recol-\nlection in the interval. If he really subjected the hand to\nthe stringent and conclusive tests mentioned in his second\naccount, what possible reason can he have had for omitting\nto refer to them in any way in his first account ? The\nobjective nature of the hand seems well established in both\naccounts ; those circumstances which would establish its in-\ndependence of the medium are mentioned only in the second.\nFor the appearance of a hand ending at the wrist could, of\ncourse, be produced by the well-known trick of covering the\nrest of the arm with a dark cloth.\nIn the case of Nikolaeff again (quoted by Count Solovovo,\np. 449, above), the objective character of the hands seems well\nestablished, while the main evidence for their supernormal\ncharacter seems to be that the sitters thought they saw the\nmedium's hands at the same time. Whether or not these latter\nwere dummy hands, the evidence is insufficient to show.\nHome's \" Pull-form Phantasms.\"\nAs to the \" full-form phantasms,\" I have nothing to add\nto Count Solovovo's forcible description of the effect of Home's\nrepeated suggestions on Lord Adare's mind, except that I see\nno reason why the same medium should not use different methods\non different occasions, according as each seems best calculated\n\f400 Alice Johnson. [part\nto produce the effect at which he is aiming. If suggestion\nfails (and, as I shall show later, there is evidence of its fairly\nfrequent failure in Home's case), why not fall back on\nmechanism, when it can be used without too much risk ?\nThus the \" spirit form \" of Sacha, seen by Lord Adare,\nCaptain Gerard Smith, and Dr. Gully, may have been a col-\nlective hallucination, or a material object ; the records are quite\ninsufficient to show which.\nAgain, in the case of the form seen at the seance of May\n7th, 1873, the evidence is dubious. Mr. Stainton Moses,\napparently writing at the time or immediately afterwards\n(Proceedings S.P.K., Vol. IX. p. 310), says that the room was\nso dark that Home kept them informed of his position ;\n\" Now\nDan is here ; now Dan is touching the, etc., etc.\" He then\nspeaks of a hand (there is nothing in the account to prove\nthat this was not Home's hand) that played the accordion,\nand later he describes a materialised form that \" floated near\nthe folding doors and advanced towards Mrs. Crookes.\" Lady\nCrookes's account (written twenty years later) shows consider-\nable discrepancies with that of Mr. Moses. She describes the\nlight as sufficient \" to show everything in the room distinctly\n\"\n(why then did Home have to describe his position to the\nsitters ?), and according to her it is the materialised form\nwhich takes the accordion and approaches her playing it. In\nthe very brief account of what appears to be the same incident\nby Sir W. Crookes {Researches in the Phenomena of Spiritualism,\np. 9 4), it is again said that \" a phantom form . . . took an\naccordion in its hand and then glided about the room playing\nthe instrument.\"\nIn general it seems to me impossible to draw any trustworthy\ninferences from the details of occurrences which are described\nby the different witnesses, or by the same witness at different\ntimes, in very varying manners. And the very serious dis-\ncrepancies between the witnesses in such cases has been, I\nthink, too often overlooked, and even perhaps to some extent\noverlooked by Count Solovovo.\nLevitations.\nTo illustrate the way in which various sources of error,\n\u2014\nsuggestion by the medium, self-suggestion by the sitters, mal-\n\flvi.] The Education of the Sitter. 491\nobservation or misdescription, and illusion,\u2014may all be combined\nin one incident, I will try to reconstruct from the sceptical\npoint of view one of the most famous events in Home's\ncareer,\u2014his alleged flight from one window to another at Ashley\nHouse,\u2014which Count Solovovo challenges the sceptic to explain.\nIn the first place, all the three witnesses, Captain Wynne,\nLord Adare, and the Master of Lindsay, had received suggestions\nof various kinds betor*ehand, which had often been effective. For\ninstance, Captain Wynne (Experiences, p. 63) had been told that\ncertain sounds on his pillow and shaking of his bed were\nspiritually produced, and that he would \"soon be able to have\nraps.\" Lord Adare and the Master of Lindsay afford two of\nthe most marked instances of \" the general liability to purely\nsubjective hallucinations which seems (as Count Solovovo says)\nto have been the speciality of many of Home's sitters.\" A few\nexamples of this have been quoted, but no one can read Lord\nAdare's Experiences without being struck by the careful daily and\nnightly training in suggestibility to which Home had subjected\nhim, apparently with considerable success. He seems to have tried\nhis hand with equally fortunate results on the Master of Lindsay.\nThus, on Nov. 20th, 1868 (p. 73), \"Lindsay and Home heard\na voice, and we all heard a spirit moving about the room.\" Soon\nafterwards Home \" began speaking of the strange and horrible\ninfluences about the Tower (Lindsay is quartered at the Tower).\nHe said,\n1\nThey are very dreadful, but can do no harm ;\nthey\nare obliged to remain at the Tower,'\" and then went on to\ndescribe several of them. \" Turning to Lindsay, he said, '\nYou\nwill have a curious manifestation at the Tower, quite alone.'\nLindsay asked him about it. '\nI must not tell you anything\nabout it.' \" This reticence seems prudent, and, as might be\nexpected, a few days later (see p. 77), \"Lindsay called; he\nsaid that he had had strong manifestations that evening\nwhen alone, and had been told to go to Ashley Place.\" At\nthe previous seance he had seen \" spirit forms.\" At this one,\nThe room was nearly dark. We had physical manifestations.\nHome went into a trance; he walked about the room for some\ntime, arranging the light and talking to himself; he then opened\nthe window, drawing the curtains, so that we could see nothing\nbut his head, and got outside the window. This frightened us, and\nLindsay wanted to stop him, but did not. Presently he came back\n\f492 Alice Johnson. [part\nand told us that we had no faith whatever, or we would not have\nbeen alarmed for his safety. 1\nHere seems to have been the first rehearsal of the scene\nthat was enacted with considerably more dramatic effect on the\nnext occasion. Later in the same seance, a discussion was carried\non between two supposed spirits, both speaking through Home,\nas to how he might be lifted up in the air. It was arranged\nthat he should be lifted first on to the back of Lord Adare's\nchair, and Lord Adare then felt his feet there, but was soon\nobliged to let go of them, as he appeared to be lifted up and\ncarried to the other side of the room, when Lord Adare was\ncalled over to him, \" took his hand and felt him alight upon\nthe floor.\" This being done in complete darkness, there was\nno evidence of any real levitation, but it probably served to-\nprepare the minds of the sitters for the crowning effort, for\nimmediately afterwards, Home remarked (p. 79), \" We will lift\nDan up again better presently and in a clearer light, so that\nyou can see better.\"\nThe next seance was the eventful one of Dec. 16th, 1868,'2\nthe sitters being Captain Wynne, the Master of Lindsay and Lord\nAdare. There was no light in the room, except what little came\nfrom the window. (The hour is not stated, but it seems as\nusual to have been late at night.) Presently\nLindsay saw two spirits on the sofa and others in different places.\n. . . A chair moved of itself from the wall up to the table between\nHome and Charlie [Captain Wynne]. Charlie said he could feel\nthat there was some one there, but he saw nothing. Lindsay per-\n1\nThe same incident is described rather more dramatically in Human Nature^\nVol. III. p. 50, by H. D. Jencken on the authority of \"the Hon. the\nM ,\" i.e. The Master of Lindsay. Mr. Jencken, writing in December,.\n1868, says: \"Mr. Home had placed himself at the window, which lie opened,,\nand deliberately stepped upon the ledge outside, looking on to the street, some-\nSO feet below, with utter unconcern. The Honourable the said he-\nshuddered, alarmed at what he was witnessing. Mr. Home noticing this stepped\ndown and reproached his friend, saying :\n'\nLittle faith, little faith ; Daniel will\nnot be injured !\n'\n\"\n2\nThe date of this stance is generally given thus ; but Lord Adare's account\n(Experiences, p. 80) has the heading: \"Seance at 5 Buckingham Gate, Wed-\nnesday, December 16th,\" and opens with the words \"On Sunday last, etc.'*\nIt seems then that the seance really took place on Sunday, December 13th,,\n1868 ; and that the account was written ou the following Wednesday.\n\fThe Education of the Sitter. 493\nceived the figure in the chair, and said he was leaning his arm on\nCharlie's shoulder. . . . [Home, in the character of this spirit] laid\nIds head upon my [Lord Adare's] hand on the table and sobbed\nviolently ; two or three tears fell upon my hand. Home: \"Do you\nfeel how hot his tears are?\" Adare: \"Yes, I do.\" Home: \"They\nwill leave a mark of blood upon your hand.\" . . . Home told me\nto go into the next room and look if the tears had left any mark\nupon my hand. I perceived a very slight red mark. When I\nreturned he told me to stretch out my hand. I did so, and Dannie\nCox [a spirit] touched it with the tip of his finger and said, through\nMr. Home, \"You will see the marks plainer in the morning.\"\nThey were rather plainer, but still indistinct, when I awoke the next\nday (pp. 80-82).\nThis little incident looks like a rudimentary case of stig-\nmatisation.1\nOther instances of effects apparently similar to some\nof the most commonplace effects of hypnotic suggestion will\nbe referred to below.\nEeturning to the central event of the seance, we find the\nsitters now in good trim, with their minds well prepared to\naccept any suggestion that may be made to them.\nHome then got up and walked about the room. He was both\nelongated and raised in the air [apparently in almost complete dark-\nness]. He spoke in a whisper, as though the spirits were arranging\nsomething. He then said to us :\n\" Do not be afraid ; and on no\naccount leave your places\n;\n\" and he went out into the passage.\nLindsay suddenly said :\n\" Oh, good heavens ! I know what he is\ngoing to do; it is too fearful.\" Adare: \"What is it?\" Lindsay\n\"I cannot tell you, it is too horrible! Adah [Menken] says that I\nmust tell you ; he is going out of the window in the other room\nand coming in at this window \"\n(p. 82).\nHere then we see the sitters' minds raised to the highest\npoint of horrified expectancy, Home having uttered vague hints\nof a possibility of this kind at a former sitting, and his hints\nhaving been elaborated and formulated by the excited imagina-\ntion of the Master of Lindsay. The narrative continues\n:\nWe heard Home go into the next room, heard the window thrown\nup, and presently Home appeared standing upright outside our\n1\nFor some of the most instructive cases of this phenomenon, see Human\nPersonality, Vol. I. pp. 491-9.\n\f494 Alice Johnson. [part\nwindow; he opened the window and walked in quite coolly\n(p. 82).\nThe Master of Lindsay's account, given to the Committee\n\u2022of the Dialectical Society on July 6th, 1869, is:\nHome . . . first went into a trance and walked about uneasily ;\nhe then went into the hall; while he was away I heard a voice\nwhisper in my ear, \" He will go out of one window and in at\n-another.\" I was alarmed and shocked at the idea of so dangerous\nan experiment. I told the company what I had heard, and we\nthen waited for Home's return. Shortly after he entered the room.\nI heard the window go up, but I could not see it, for I sat with my\nback to it. I however saw his shadow on the opposite wall ; he\nwent out of the window in a horizontal position, and I saw him\noutside the other window (that in the next room) floating in the air. 1\nIt is difficult to understand how the Master of Lindsay,\nsitting with his back to the window of one room, could have\nseen Home floating outside the window of the other room.\nWe can only suppose that he is describing what he imagined\nwas happening, not what he saw.\nSimilarly Captain Wynne, writing to Home on February 2nd,\n1877, gives no description of what he saw but merely says:\nI was present and a witness. . . . The fact of your having gone\nout of the window and in at the other I can swear to . . ?\nHere arain is an obvious confusion between observation and\nO\ninference, as none of the witnesses was in a position to see\nHome go out of the first window.\nWriting of the same incident on July 14th, 1871, the\nMaster of Lindsay says :\nWe heard the window in the next room lifted up, and almost\nimmediately after we saw Home floating in the air outside our\nwindow. The moon was shining full into the room ;\nmy back was\nto the light, and I saw the shadow on the wall of the window-sill\nand Home's feet about six inches above it. He remained in this\nposition for a few seconds, then raised the window and glided into\nthe room feet foremost and sat down.3\n1\nReport on Spiritualism of the Dialectical Committee, p. 214.\n2\nD. D. Home: His Life and Mission, pp. 306-7.\n3 Modem Spiritualism, by F. Podmore, Vol. II. p. 255. Mr. Podmore's\n-account is quoted from The Spiritualist, Vol. II.\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 495\nIn regard to the moonlight, Mr. Podmore points out that\nthe seance took place on Dec. 16th, 1868, two days after\nnew moon,1\nand Lord Adare, whose account seems to be almost\ncontemporary, says that immediately afterwards he went into\nthe next room with Home, who professed then to show him\nhow he had gone out of the first window. He appeared to be\nswung out and in, but \" it was so dark I could not see\nclearly how he was supported outside\" {Experiences, p. 83),\nthough there seems no reason to suppose it was not on the\nstone balustrade.\nLater in the seance \" Lindsay and Charlie saw tongues or\njets of flames proceeding from Home's head. We then all\ndistinctly heard, as it were, a bird flying round the room,\nwhistling and chirping, but saw nothing, except Lindsay, who\nperceived an indistinct form resembling a bird\" {op. cit., p. 83).\nThese incidents seem to have been hallucinatory, since they\nwere not perceptible to all the sitters, and, if so, further\nevidence of a generally suggestible condition on their part is\nfurnished.\nAs to the levitation which Count Solovovo challenges us to\nexplain, two hypotheses may occur to the reader. The rooms,\nsays Lord Adare, were on the third floor of the house. Outside\neach window was a small balcony or ledge, 19 inches deep,\nbounded by balustrades, 18 inches high. The space between\nthe balustrades of the two windows measured 7 ft. 4 ins.,\nso that Home could not normally have passed outside the\nhouse from one to the other unaided. He might, however,\nhave done so by means of a board laid across from\none balustrade to the other,\n2\nor by a ladder, but this would\nprobably have involved an accomplice. A far more probable\nhypothesis is that he did not go outside at all, but crept\nback noiselessly into the room he had just left, made his\nway round in the darkness to the window, and then\nmounted on to the window-sill, standing inside, while the\nspectators believed him to be outside the window. He might\n1\nOr, as I have pointed out above, see foot-note ante, on Dec. 13th. I find\nfrom an almanac of 1S6S that new moon was on Dec. 13th.\n2\nAs far as I can understand from the record, though it is not quite clear on\nthis point, Home was staying in the house at the time, and so must have had\nopportunities of making preparations.\n\f496 Alice Johnson. [part\nthen have opened the window and stepped down into the\nroom, thus giving them the impression that he had come in\nthrough the window.\nThis illusion would not, I think, be difficult to produce in\nthe almost complete darkness of such a sitting. I have tested\nmy own capacity for determining, under rather better condi-\ntions of light, whether a man who was standing on a window-\nsill, was outside the window or inside it, and I found that\nI could not see on which side he was. In Home's case the\nsitters had been led to expect that he would appear outside\nthe window, which, it is to be noted, they were forbidden to\napproach, for Home had said to them before he left the room,.\n\" On no account leave your places.\" It must also be noted\nthat, if Home had tried to produce the illusion by this\nmeans and failed\u2014if, that is, the sitters had perceived that he\nwas inside and not outside\u2014no harm would have been done, for\nhe could easily have passed it off by saying there was not\n\" power \" enough to do it that night and making some excuse,,\nif one was demanded, for his position.\nThe importance that has been attached to this case seems\nto me to have arisen merely from its sensational character,,\nbecause it looked as if a great risk had been run. Eviden-\ntially, it is not strong ; for it occurred in a very bad light,\nand to three witnesses of suggestible temperament, whose\nminds had been carefully and skilfully prepared beforehand,\nand who experienced undoubted hallucinations at this very\nsitting both before and after the \" levitation.\"\nThe two instances of levitation recorded by Sir W. Crookes\n(Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. VI. pp. 119 and 126) are far stronger,\nfor they seemed to have occurred in fairly good light, though\nthey too may possibly be explained as collective visual illusions.\nOn the other hand, this explanation can hardly apply to two\nother instances described very briefly by Sir William Crookes\nat a meeting of the Society on Oct. 26th, 1894 (see Journal\nS.P.B., Vol. VI. p. 342), as follows:\nOn another occasion I was invited to come to him [Home], when\nhe rose 18 inches off the ground, and I passed my hands under his\nfeet, round him, and over his head when he was in the air.\nOn several occasions Home and the chair on which he was sitting\nat the table rose off the ground. This was generally done very\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 497\ndeliberately, and Home sometimes then tucked up his feet on the\nseat of the chair and held up his hands in view of all of us. On\nsuch an occasion I have got down, and seen and felt that all four\nlegs were off the ground at the same time, Home's feet being on the\nchair.\nUnfortunately there seems, as far as 1 can discover, to be\nno contemporary record of these occasions when the levitation\nwas stated to be not only plainly visible, but tested by the\nsense of touch.\nThe Fire Test.\nComing to the \" fire test,\" some cases of this, as displayed\nby Home, have always appeared to me among the most\ndifficult of his performances to explain away, either by the\nhypothesis of any mechanical trick or by that of illusion.\nIn regard to tricks : chemical methods for procuring immunity\nfrom burning might have been used by Home for his own\nhands, but hardly for those of his sitters. It is possible to\nhold a kettle full of boiling water on one's hand for a moment,\nthe hand being protected by an intervening layer of steam\nformed from its own moisture, but the protection would only\nlast for a very short time. Mr. Baggally tells me that if a\nhandkerchief be stretched tight over a small plate of cold\nmetal, such as the back of a watch, a red-hot coal may remain\non it for a few seconds without burning it. All these are\nknown methods, and it seems not impossible that Home may\non occasion have resorted to them.\nI am inclined to think that suggestion may also have\nbeen used occasionally. In that case we should have to\nsuppose that, by some sleight-of-hand, Home was able to\ncreate the impression that he was taking a coal out of a\nred-hot fire when he really took it, say, out of his pocket,\nand we should have further to suppose that he made his\nsitters believe it was red-hot when it was only, say, painted\nred. This supposition would at least be not inconsistent with\nthe cinder dust left in the hair of Mr. Hall after the (sup-\nposed) red-hot coal had been placed in it (Lord Adare's Experi-\nences, pp. 178-9). But, says Count Solovovo, in this as in\nsome other cases (see also pp. 146-7) these alleged hot\nlamp chimneys or coals burn some people and not others.\n\f498 Alice Johnson. [part\nOccasionally it seems to me that this could be explained, not by\nthe hypothesis that Count Solovovo mentions only to dismiss,\n\u2014\nviz. that some of the sitters were somehow rendered immune from\nthe heat,\u2014but on the contrary, by supposing that the chimney\nor coal was not really very hot, and that the effect of burning\nand blistering was produced in the case of Captain Gerard\nSmith's finger (Dialectical Society's Report, p. 361), by suggestion,\nas in a number of cases referred to in Human Personality,\nVol. I. pp. 495-7.\nThis hypothesis, however, does not apply to cases where a\nsitter is not burnt by a (supposed) red-hot coal which does\n(apparently) burn some inanimate object, such as a piece of\npaper (Lord Adare's Experiences, p. 179). Here we should\nhave to suppose further that Home had contrived by some\nother means to set fire to the paper.\nBut when we come to the first case described in Lord\nAdare's book (pp. 67-68), where Home not only takes coals-\nout of the fire, but places \" his face right among the burning\ncoals, moving it about as though bathing it in water,\" and\nafterwards holds his finger for some time in a candle-flame\n;\n1\nor to the two cases recorded by Sir William Crookes, when\nhe observed that Home stirred the hot coals of the fire about\nwith his hands (Proceedings S.P.E., Vol. VI. pp. 103-4), Sir\nW. Crookes on one occasion standing close to the fire and\nstooping down to it as Home put his hands in ; we can hardly\nexplain away these occurrences without assuming either a\nwholesale incapacity for observation, or an abnormal condition\nof consciousness.\nQuasi-Hypnotic Effects.\nBut have we any other evidence, besides that afforded by\nsome of the fire-tests, of effects produced on Home's sitters-\nanalogous to the effects of hypnotic suggestion ? I think we\nhave. I quoted above the red mark that appeared on Lord\nAdare's hand after Home had wept two or three tears on it ;.\nfor it can -hardly be supposed that these tears were actually\nhot enough to produce a mark.\nAgain (see Lord Adare's Experiences, p. 68) Home says he-\nwill withdraw the moisture and scent from some flowers; then\n1\nNote, however, that after these performances Home remarked that he must\nwash his hands.\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 499'\nhe rubbed Lord Adare's hands, \" imparting the odour of the\nflowers to them ... he also nipped the moisture and with\nit the scent from his fingers to each person.\" Later (p. 76)r\nHome having \" magnetised \" some water, Lord Adare is told\nto take some of it night and morning as a cure. Then comes\na curious story of brandy being made weak (p. 78) by Home\nmaking passes over the glass and flipping his fingers over it,\n\" sending a strong smell of spirit through the room ; in about\nfive minutes he had made the brandy as weak as very weak\nbrandy and water ; it scarcely tasted at all of spirit ; both\nLindsay and I tasted it at the moment, and also some time\nafter the seance was over.\"\nAgain {op. ext., p. 90)\n:\nHome then made some very curious experiments with flowers\n;\nhe separated the scent into two portions\u2014one odour smelling\nexactly like earth, the other being very sweet. . . .\n[Later in the sitting, Home went out of the room and then]\nreturned, holding in his hand half a lemon, freshly cut; he handed\nit to each of us to taste. He laughed and said, \" Yes, it is very\ngood, is it not\n1\n? So refreshing.\" He then held it up above his\nhead and said, \"We will withdraw all the acid flavour from it.\"\nA yellowish light came over the lemon ; he held it up for some\nlittle time and said, \"Now taste again.\" He held it out to me,\nbut the room being rather dark I bobbed my nose against it, and\ntherefore tasted nothing. All the others tasted it, and described it\nas most disagreeable, having no odour, and the flavour being a sort\nof mawkish alkali ; some describing it as like magnesia ; others as\nlike washing soda. Home laughed and said, \"We will take the\nnasty taste away presently.\" . . . [Later, having stated that the\nacid would now be restored to the lemon], he held the lemon up\nand a rose-coloured flame, or rather light, came over it. After a\nlittle, he gave it to those who had tasted it the second time ;\nthey\nsaid that it was quite good and fresh, and that all the natural scent\nand flavour was restored to it.\nThese incidents irresistibly recall the ordinary platform\nhypnotic experiments of making subjects eat, say, pieces of\nsoap or candle under the impression that they are pieces of\ncake. It is of course well known that some simple delusions\nof this kind can be imposed on many persons without hypnosis,\n\f500 Alice Johnson. [part\nand it certainly looks as if Home had the capacity for doing\nthis.\nThere are, further, indications too numerous to quote in full\nof persons at his sittings partially or completely losing either\ntheir consciousness, or their control over their muscles\u2014which\nmay, one would suppose, involve some change in the con-\nsciousness.\n1\nThus, Mr. Holt at his first sitting becomes much\naffected ; his hands are taken possession of and violently\nagitated ; his arms are drawn back behind his chair (Lord\nAdare's Experiences, p. 22). It is this agitated gentleman who\nis specially called upon by Home to observe the details\nof the process of \" elongation \" of the medium on this\noccasion. At the same sitting one of the ladies present\nbecomes entranced. Lord Adare says (p. 28, foot-note) that\nhe has often \" seen people's hands taken possession of and\nagitated during seances,\" and \" the same thing has occurred\nto myself.\" At another seance (p. d-4) Count Eonicker\nwas present, \" and his magnetic influence was so strong\nthat it made us all more or less ill.\" At a sitting ten days\nafter the window levitation episode, the Master of Lindsay fell\ninto a trance, and at first could not speak. After waking, he\nsaw spirit forms (p. 89). Mr. Lawless feels a sensation as if\na hot stream flowed into him when Home's hand is pressed\nagainst the back of his neck, and later he and Miss Smith\nbecome hysterical (p. 99). On March 2nd Mrs. Blackburn\nbecomes slightly under influence and a good deal agitated.\nHome tells her this is caused by two spirits whom he can see\nstanding behind her and magnetising' her. Meanwhile Mr.\nLawless is again hysterical (p. 105). Two days later the same\nthing happens to Mrs. Blackburn again, and Home tells her\nshe is coming under spirit influence (p. 109). On a third\n1\nSensations of this kind are sometimes regarded as indications of a super-\nnormal power on the part of the medium in whose presence they occur. Mrs.\nSidgwick, in her paper on \" Results of a Personal Investigation into the Physical\nPhenomena of Spiritualism\" (Proceedings S.P.E.., Vol. IV. p. 55), observed\nduring an undoubtedly fraudulent performance that \" the gentleman who held\nthe medium's left hand, and who was not placed so as to be able to see what\nwas going on, was of a sensitive organisation, and felt during the performances\nthe sensations which he always experienced at successful spiritualistic seances,\n\u2014\nshudderings and convulsive movements of the arms, I think they were\u2014which\nshows that sensations of this kind afford no evidence of the genuineness of the\nmanifestations.\"\n\fThe Education of the Sitter. 501\nrepetition of the same, he makes passes over her, suggesting\nthat her mediumistic powers will be developed (p. 117).\nThese passes seem to have been used with effect on other\noccasions, and notably if made by Home when in a trance\ncondition. Thus (p. 86) \"Home was taken possession of, his\nhands and arms became partially cataleptic, and he made passes\nin this condition over Augusta [Gore] for some time, then\nstooping down he made passes under the couch [on which\nshe was lying], which Augusta said she felt distinctly.\" At\nthe same seance\u2014it is not clear whether before or after the\npasses\u2014she sees \" spirit-forms,\" apparently seen by no one\nelse.\nAgain (pp. 133-4) Home, under influence, makes \"mesmeric\npasses \" over all the sitters, and repeats them after an interval.\nThis was at one of the sittings referred to by Count Solovovo,\nwhen \" spirit hands \" were (after the passes) seen by the\nsitters.\nA much more striking scene occurred at a later seance\n(pp. 153-5), when Mr. J. and Lord Adare were the only\nsitters. After Home had gone through a realistic series of\ndramatisations, which were interpreted as representing scenes\nin the life of Mr. J.'s brother, Mr. J. fell into a deep trance,\nsobbed violently, spoke in Arabic with great rapidity, and\ncalled his brother's name, evidently referring to the scenes just\nenacted by Home, who had finally to wake him up from the\ntrance.\nAgain (p. 163), the sitters remaining behind after a seance\nwith Home, the Master of Lindsay was first mesmerised by Mr.\nBergheim, and on waking mesmerised Mr. Bergheim in his turn.\nMr. Bergheim became very uncomfortable, and said he was\nbeing \" cross-mesmerised.\" On waking he said that the last\nthins; he recollected before becoming entranced was seeino- a\nfigure or form of some sort standing beside the Master of\nLindsay. The experiment was repeated, and he again imagined\nhimself under the influence of some spirit ; then he said the\nspirit had gone away, and that the Master of Lindsay could\nnot wake him without its help, and implored him to bring it\nback. They opened the door and told him it had come back,\nwhich seemed to satisfy him ;\nthen he soon awoke, but was\nin a nervous state for some time.\n2i\n\f502 Alice Johnson. [part\nAll these incidents seem to me to point to a very suggestible\ncondition on the part of the sitters.\nIn connection with this subject I may briefly refer to an\nexperience of my own at my second sitting with Eusapia\nPaladino. The sitting, like many of those with Home, was\nheld in almost complete darkness, and I was supposed to be\ncontrolling Eusapia's left arm and hand, while Mr. Myers was\ncontrolling her on the right. At that time I had had little\npractical experience in the kind of holding that is required\nunder such circumstances, and I apparently let the hand and\narm on my side get free. Various phenomena followed, all\neasily within the capacity of this hand, if free,\u2014such as touches\non my head, back, etc. Quite apart from these phenomena,\nI went through a series of curious hallucinations of an almost\nindescribable kind,\u2014indescribable because they were so unlike\nany ordinary sensations. There was no break in consciousness,\nbut the condition was, T have no doubt, a slightly abnormal\none, and one in which I could not depend on my own powers\nof observation as to the actual events of the sitting.\nIt was my recollection of this occasion that made me inclined\nto think that Mr. Warndorfer might have been in a somewhat\nsimilar condition when he witnessed the \" levitation \" described\nabove in Count Solovovo's paper, p. 457.\nOccasional In efficacy of the Suggestions.\nFurther evidence of Home's practice of suggestion is to be\nfound in many instances given in Lord Adare's report where\nthe suggestion failed to take effect. Failures of this kind\nhave, as has often been remarked, no tendency to discredit a\nmedium. If a professed conjurer fails, it is put down to want\nof skill on his part. If a medium fails, he can generally\ncharge it on the want of spiritual capacity of the sitter.\nThe case of Adah Menken (Lord Adare's Experiences, pp. 34-7)\nhas already been referred to by Count Solovovo in this con-\nnection. Here Home could, it seems, only partially produce\nthe effect at which he was aiming.\nOn another occasion (pp. 56-59), just after the death of\nDannie Cox, Home took Lord Adare in the middle of the\nnight, and in complete darkness, into the drawing-room in which\n\fLvr.] The Education of the Sitter. 503\nthe child's coffin was placed, and told him to raise the lid of\nthe coffin, when he heard a slight rustling inside, and then\ntook him back into his bedroom and said to him :\n\"Little Dannie is there between you and the light; can you\nnot see him'?\" \"No,\" I said, \"I cannot.\" He laughed and said,\n\"Dannie would make himself appear as white; but he cannot just\nyet; he has so recently come to us. He will try and make himself\nvisible as a dark shadow to you.\" I still said that I could see\nnothing. \" Ah, never mind !\n\" Home said ; and holding one of my\nhands in his, he stretched it out in the dark and said, \" Dannie\nwill let you play with it first.\" I perceive a strong scent, as it\nwere, blown over me and felt a flower touch my fingers and then\nwithdraw itself. Presently I felt a little soft hand touch mine, and\na flower was given me. I then felt a strong tremor run through\nHome's hands, and he spoke as little Dannie and said, \" You must\nget into bed cpuickly ; Dan is going to awake ; if you would like\nvery much to see what you have got, you can make an excuse to\nlight a candle presently.\" Accordingly, after Home had awoke, I\nlit a candle, and found I had been given a purple- and white\npetunia that had been placed in one of the little hands in the\ncoffin.\nThe account shows, it may be noted, that Home would\nhave had no difficulty in abstracting the flower in question\nfrom the coffin.\nAfter a few more seances, in one of which Dannie was\nsupposed to manifest, the suggestion was repeated with greater\neffect (see p. 65), again in Lord Adare's bedroom, which he\nshared with Home and which seems to have been the scene\nof much of his training as a sitter. First, Home entranced\nand in bed, speaks as little Dannie and tells Lord Adare to\ncome and sit on his bed, which he does, remarking that he\nwished to see manifestations. Then\n:\nWe heard a spirit come in and walk about the room ; and per-\nceived a light near the ceiling. Little Dannie Cox then came and\nmoved away a pillow that Home had over his feet. He stroked\nand pulled my feet and sat on them. . . . We also saw the same\nsort of little star we had seen at Stockton. He then said, \"Now\ngood-night \" and stood upon the foot of the bed. I saw him distinctly\nas a shadowy figure, of the same size as his mortal body, with\n\f504 Alice Johnson. [part\napparently some loose drapery on. His hand was stretched out\ntowards us waving about. The hand and arm were directly between\nme and the window and interrupted the light as palpably as if\nmade of solid flesh and bone.\nAgain (p. 63), Home tells Lord Adare that \"A has just\ncome in ; he has come bustling into the room ;\nyou heard\nhim.\" Lord Adare replies, \" Well, I heard a noise as if the\ndoor had been opened.\" \" Yes,\" says Home, \" that was him ;\nyou will always know when A. comes ; he will make a\nsound like that at the door.\" Here we see the partial failure\nskilfully covered up. Similarly (p. 64) Home says: \"You\nwere magnetised just now, and you heard a spirit shout.\" Lord\nAdare replies, \" I am not aware that I did.\" Home rejoins,\n\" You did not notice it ;\nyou did not know what it was and\nyou did not pay any attention to it ; but you heard it.\"\nOn a later occasion (p. 72) Home gives a graphic account\nof a vision he professes to see at night of a race-course and\nmen betting and then fighting, but only succeeds in getting\nLord Adare to hear a sound as of a horse galloping and a\nnoise in the corner of the room like a blow struck.\nI have already referred to the promised levitation which\nfailed to take place (p. 79), but preluded the successful attempt\nat 5 Buckingham Gate on Dec. 16th, 1868.\nAgain, he tries to persuade Lord Adare that the latter has\nhad a certain dream (p. 85), after ascertaining that he could\nnot remember what he had dreamt the night before.\nSimilarly (p. 148), while sitting up together in the evening\nin Home's room, they hear raps on the door, and Home says,\n\" Your grandfather has come in ; do you not see him sitting\nin that chair yonder ?\n\" \"I see no one,\" I answered, \" which\ngrandfather do you mean ?\n\" \" Your father's father ;\nyou will\nat any rate hear him.\" Accordingly Lord Adare hears a sound\nas if some one sitting on the chair had put his foot on the\nground, and then sees the chair move from a distance up to\nthe table, apparently untouched.\nAlternation of Suggestion and other Methods.\nThe incident just cpuoted is a possible instance of the alter-\nnation of suggestion and other methods. Home may easily\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 505\nhave had some arrangement for moving the chair. But the\nincident would have been more impressive if the grandfather\nhad been seen moving it, so he tries to make Lord Adare\nsee his grandfather, but only succeeds in making him hear a\nvague sound. As a rule, he can only produce definite visual\nhallucinations in complete or partial darkness.\nSuggestion is of course a safer method to use than a\nmechanical contrivance which may be discovered, but why\nshould not a medium adapt himself to circumstances, and use\none or the other or both ? Thus the visions seen by Lord\nAdare in his bedroom at night were probably all hallucinatory.\nBut the materialisation of Adah Menken, described by Lord\nAdare (p. 145), seems to me of a familiar objective type.\n[The room having been darkened] Home went into a trance. . . .\nWe all saw a very curious appearance form itself above his head ;\nit looked at first like a lace handkerchief, held out by a stick or\nsupport of some sort ;\nsoon, however, it became more distinct, and\nappeared to be a shadowy human form enveloped in drapery ; it was\nabout two feet in length. Some one present remarked that it\nexceedingly resembled a \" vignette \" heading one of Adah Menken's\npoems. Home said (speaking as Menken), \"Yes, that is it, that is\nwhat I wish to imitate ; I will try and make my form visible to\nyou.\" The surface of the wall to Home's right became illuminated\nthree or four times ; the light apparently radiating from a bright\nspot in the centre. Across the portion of wall thus illuminated we\nrepeatedly saw a dark shadow pass; it appeared to me rather the\nshadow cast by a solid substance than the actual form itself. Home's\ncollar stud dropped on the floor, and a spirit [Home ?] brought it\nand placed it on my head, touching my brow while doing so.\nThe full account (see pp. 95 and 177) of the apparition\nof Sacha, referred to by Count Solovovo, again suggests strongly\na \" materialisation \" manipulated by Home, on whom, it is to\nbe remembered, no restrictions whatever were placed in any\nof these sittings.\nBecognition.\nThese cases lead us on to consider what kind or degree of\nillusion is involved in the \" recognition \" of materialised forms\nor spirit photographs, and how far such an illusion is induced\n\f506 Alice Johnson. [part\nby the medium, or whether it originates spontaneously in the\nsitters. In the case of Adah Menken just quoted the medium\nseemed to have profited by a casual remark of one of the\nsitters to suggest the identification ; while in the second case\nhe himself told them that the form was Sacha. In neither\ncase, however, does it appear that any distinct resemblance to\nthe supposed original was perceived by any of the sitters,\nand in this respect the cases are similar to many materialisa-\ntions produced by professional mediums, where it is simply\nassumed that certain forms represent the first person thought\nof by the sitter with whom they are supposed to be\nconnected.\nYet no one who has attended such sittings and carefully\nwatched the proceedings can, I think, doubt that occasionally\nsome sitter really sees a very close resemblance in one of\nthe faces to some intimate friend of his. In cases where the\nidentity of the medium with the form is detected, as in the\ncase recorded by Mr. More (quoted above by Count Solovovo,\nwith which may usefully be compared the, case of Mr. W. B.\nHodgson, see above, p. 474, footnote); or in the case of\ncollective vision in a mirror (quoted above by Count Solovovo,\np. 463), this phenomenon is called by believers \"transfiguration.\"\nIn other cases it is called \" materialisation.\"\nThat there is at least a very frequent element of illusion\nin these cases is proved by the fact that different sitters\nvary widely in their impressions of them. I quote the\nfollowing instance from notes of my own.\nJune 20th, 1905.\nMr. A. E. H., a member of the American Branch, who called here\nthis morning, gave me a long account of his experiences in seeing\nmaterialised forms. It appeared that he had been investigating the\nsubject for some 20 years, and had concluded that most mediums\nwere fraudulent. But there were two or three whom he had ex-\nperimented with a long time and believed to be genuine, or at least\nthat some of their phenomena were so.\nHe told me this incident among others : On one occasion he had\nvery clearly recognised the face of a friend of his, seen in a\nperfectly life-like manner, the colour and form of the face exactly\nlike life and exactly like the person. A friend of his, looking\nat the same face, saw only a vague luminous clouddike thing\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 507\nwith no features. On the same occasion, this friend saw quite\ndearly and recognised the face of some friend of his in what\nappeared to Mr. H. a vague, luminous, cloud-like thing with no\nfeatures.\nHere one or other of the percipients must have been under an\nillusion. Similarly when Professor Furness (as quoted by Count\nSolovovo) saw the medium in the forms recognised by other sitters\nas their friends, either he or the other sitters must have been\nunder an illusion. For the purposes of my argument, it makes\nno difference whether it is the believer or the sceptic that was\ndeluded ;\nI merely maintain that illusion there was, and that of\na pronounced kind.\nProbably most people are not aware of the differences in faces\nthat are produced by different accessories, or, in particular, by\ndifferences of illumination, and therefore do not know how easily\nmistakes in recognition may be made. Some years ago, after\nwitnessing the \" materialisations \" of Husk and Craddock, and\nhearing from a number of people how much they had been\nimpressed by seeing forms which they recognised, I tried experi-\nments on this point, as follows\n:\nOn May 17th, 1905, seven persons, (five of whom were members\nof the S.P.R.) came to the Pooms at 20 Hanover Square at my\ninvitation to witness experiments in sham materialisations, my object\nbeing to test how far they would recognise or fail to recognise the\nfaces of persons slightly disguised, but well known to them.\nThe room was arranged as is usual for sittings for materialisations,\nthat is, it was darkened as completely as possible, with a cabinet\nin one corner, near to which the sitters were arranged in a semi-circle.\nThe performers entered the cabinet from a door opening into the back\nof it.\nThere were three performers who played the part of materialised\nforms, viz. myself and one of the Assistant Secretaries, both, of us\nbeing well known to most of the sitters, and a third lady who was\nonly known to one or two of them.\nThis lady took the first part and dressed herself in drapery with\na head-dress supposed to be Persian. She came out into the room,\nholding a luminous slate up to her face, and spoke in a low voice\none or two Hindu phrases which she happened to know.\nThe Assistant Secretary with the help of a very obviously false\nmoustache and turban posed as a Hindu. The sitters, who were\n\f508 Alice Johnson. [part\nasked to note their impressions, described her variously as a young\nIndian, an Egyptian, or of the Hindu type.\nI appeared as a nun, with drapery over the head. I was interested\nto find that this simple disguise led the sitters to estimate my age\nvariously as from 18 to 25 ; for I had lately been told by a man\nwho had been attending Husk's materialising seances that one of the\nforms that came to him was a young man of about 18 or 20, and\nthe medium being about 50, it would have been impossible, he said,\nfor him to personate such a young man. Husk was accustomed to\nuse a luminous slate such as we were using to show the faces of\nthe \"spirit\" forms.\nAt this experimental sitting, not one of the performers was\nrecognised at any time by any of the sitters, and this in spite of\nthe fact that they knew the performance to be a sham and therefore\nwere not open to any emotional influences that might have interfered\nwith their powers of observation. They knew too that my assistants\nand I were likely to be among the performers; yet the only one\nwhom they thought they recognised was the assistant who happened\nnot to be there.\nPossibility of Negative Hallucinations.\nCount Solovovo remarks that if we admit that positive\nhallucinations may occur at seances, \" we are logically bound\nto infer that [the medium] may also prevent [his sitters'] seeing\nsome actions of his, or even his own person,\u2014may, in fact,\ninduce in them not only positive, but also negative hallucina-\ntions.\" I think this actually does occur not infrequently, and\nI quote an instance of it from Mr. Podmore's Modem Spiritualism,\nVol. II., p. 217, in connection with a slate-writing seance given\nto his brother, Mr. Austin Podmore, by Mr. S. J. Davey,\nMr. A. Podmore held in his left hand a slate the other end\nof wMch was held by Mr. Davey. He then unlocked a double\nslate given to him by Mr. Davey, put three pieces of chalk,\nred, green and grey, inside, locked it up again and placed the\nkey in his pocket and the. slate on the table where he could\nwatch it. His account continues :\nAfter some few minutes, during which, to the best of my belief.\nI was attentively regarding both slates, Mr. D. whisked the first\naway and showed me on the reverse a message written to myselL\n\flvi.] The Education of the Sitter. 50&\nAlmost immediately afterwards he asked me to unlock the second\nslate, and on doing so I found to my intense astonishment another\nmessage written on both the insides of the slate\u2014 the lines in alternate\ncolours and the chalks apparently much worn by usage.\nMy brother tells me that there was an interval of some two or\nthree minutes, during which my attention was called away, but I\ncan onby believe it on his word.\nAustin Podmore.\nMr. Frank Podmore adds :\nMr. Davey allowed me to see exactly what was done, and this is\nwhat I saw. The \"almost immediately\" in the above account\ncovered an interval of some minutes. During the interval, and\nindeed throughout the seance, Davey kept up a constant stream of\nchatter. . . . Mr. A. Podmore, absorbed by the conjurer's patter,\nfixed his eyes on Davey's face, and the latter took advantage of\nthe opportunity to remove the locked slate under cover of a duster\nfrom under my brother's nose to the far end of the room, and\nthere exchange it for a similar slate, with a previously prepared\nmessage, which was then placed by means of the same manoeuvre\nwith the duster in the position originally occupied by the first slate.\nThen and only then the stream of talk slackened and Mr. A.\nPodmore's attention became concentrated upon the slate, from\nwhich the sound of spirit writing was now heard to proceed. To\nme the most surprising thing in the whole episode was Mr. A.\nPodmore's incredulity when told that his attention had been\ndiverted from the slate for an appreciable period.\nHere then it seems that Mr. Davey had got up from his\nplace and walked over to the other end of the room and\nback again without the sitter being aware that he had done\nso, and this in full light, with a sitter whose whole attention\n(as he himself believed) was being directed to his movements.\nCount Solovovo maintains that we are not entitled to\nsuppose that misinterpretation can assume such gigantic pro-\nportions as to make several people mistake a man who thrust\nhis head and shoulders out of the window for one who was\nfloating in the air outside the window. My reply would be\nthat a very small error in perception may sometimes lead to\na very large error of inference. I have suggested that when\nHome was believed to be standing outside, he was perhaps\nreally standing inside.' If so, this, as far as the perception\n\f510 Alice Johnson. [part\nof the witnesses was concerned, would have involved but a\nslight illusion in regard to the relative positions of Home and\nthe window, and one which I find is easily induced, at least\nin myself. But it would involve a very large error of inference\nto suppose that Home had come to the window from the\noutside if he had really come from the inside.\nDuring the sittings with Eusapia Paladino at Cambridge in\n1895, I experienced an illusion of position of a kind which\nis known to be frequent in darkness, which I described at the\ntime as follows :\nWith regard to the [supposed head of John King] I noticed a\ncurious illusion which I cannot explain, viz. that while something\nin tlie appearance suggested to me that the \"head\" was on a\nlevel with the further end of the table \u2014which Eusapia's head\ncould hardly have reached unless she stood up and leant far for-\nward \u2014something else gave me the impression that the \"head\" was\nonly at the point that she could easily have reached without stand-\ning. She was actually sitting at the time, and I have no doubt\nthat the latter impression was the correct one. But if this second\nelement in the perception had been missing, I should have thought\nI had seen a head in a position where it was almost impossible\nfor Eusapia's head to be. 1\n[Subsequent observation showed that this\nhead was practically in the position of Eusapia's head and undoubtedly\nidentical with it.]\nI will quote one more instance of spontaneous illusion or\nhallucination as to the real position of an object, sent to me\nby Mr. F. C. Constable, of Wick Court, near Bristol, who\nwrites\n:\nI have frequently to walk from my house to the village club. The\nroad outside the house runs, for perhaps twenty yards, with trees\non one side and an iron fencing on the other. Then comes a five-\nbarred gate which I have to open to pass through into an open\nfield. The road is naturally very familiar to me.\nAt nightfall when, on leaving the light of the house, I can at first\nsee nothing and, later on, only the path very dimly, and objects\ndimly definite but at a yard or two, the following false visualization\nis of almost common occurrence. I see the bars of the gate before\nme, crossing my path, before I come to the material gate. For\n1\nJournal S.P.R., Vol. VII. p. 15S.\n\fLVI.] The Education of the Sitter. 511\ninstance : last night it was so dark I walked from the path on to\nthe grass. As I felt my way back to the path and raised my eyes\nthere were the bars of the gate before me. I put out my hand,\nfelt nothing and walked on some steps before I reached the gate\nitself. This false visualization has occurred, very possibly, twenty\nor thirty times during the last three years, and, carefully dissecting\nmy experience, I am of opinion the false visualization is, to me,\nas real and definite as visualization resulting from the material.\nI should perhaps state that this false visualization is unique in\nmy experience.\n[Later Mr. Constable adds :] Last night walking to the club I\ndetermined to \"bilk\" the hallucination. As I walked I marked a\ntree on my right and said to myself \" now the gate is within three\nfeet of me.\" I looked. There was the gate. I walked to it. It\nwas not there, but some six or seven feet distant. I looked again\nat the tree (remember it was but a dim shadow in the darkness)\nand saw I had mistaken it for another.\nA clear case of a visual hallucination raised by a false association\nof ideas.\nF. C. Constable.\nIt appears to me that simple and slight errors of this kind,\nwhether occurring spontaneously or suggested by the medium,\nmay account for a good many supposed telekinetic phenomena\n;\nsince through such errors, which would, of course, be chiefly\nliable to occur in a bad light, the medium might appear to be\nat a little distance from objects with which he was really in\ncontact.\n\f512 Count Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nNOTE ON MISS JOHNSON'S PAPEE.\nBy Count Peeovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\nI have read Miss Johnson's paper on \" The Education of the\nSitter \" with the greatest possible interest and sympathy.\nHer arguments have struck me as being presented in a\nvery forcible way ; and I willingly admit that there is in\nthem a good deal of apparently good evidence tending to\nindicate suggestion on Home's part as a plausible explanation\nof some at least of his marvels.\nBut we have still to give full weight to the following\ncircumstances : (a) that whilst some of Home's phenomena\nhave been proved objective beyond a doubt, none have ever\nbeen undoubtedly shown to be hallucinatory; (5) that, apart\nfrom Home, there exists an overwhelming mass of evidence\nshowing the most startling \" phenomena \" of Spiritualism to\nbe objective, to whatever cause due.\nFor with regard to the last point, it must not be lost sight\nof that the distinction drawn between the \" manifestations\n\"\nof Home and those of other mediums is purely arbitrary.\nIf Home's manifestations were authentic, those of some other\nmediums must have been equally genuine : if all other physical\nphenomena are spurious, then Home's must have been fraudu-\nlent also.\nIt should also be borne in mind, I think, that here, as\nin every-day experience, the most plausible explanation may\nafter all not be the true one. Misdescription, illusion pure\nand simple, and illusion combined with fraud may work very\nwell as explanations in ninety-nine cases ;\nbut when we come\nto the hundredth there may turn out a circumstance which\nwill clearly show such a hypothesis to be inadequate ; and if\nin one case, why not in others ?\n\flvi.] Note on Miss Johnson's Paper. 513\nFrom this point of view, let us consider a characteristic\ninstance. Mr. T. Adolphus Trollope narrates how at one of\nHome's sittings in Florence\na middle-aged Italian gentleman of the Jewish persuasion asked\nthat the spirit of his father, who, it was stated by the medium,\nwas present, should mention where he and his son, then communi-\ncating with him, last met on earth. It should be stated that the\ninquirer, having abandoned the faith of his fathers, professed entire\ndisbelief in any existence of the soul or any future life. The answer\nto his query was spelled out in the manner I have already described\n[i.e. through raps] a certain Italian city being named. I watched\nthe face of the sceptical inquirer as the letters were \" rapped out\n\"\nand gradually completed the name required. And I needed no\nconfession of the fact from him to know that the answer had been\ncorrectly given. I thought the man would have fallen from his\nchair. He became ghastly pale and trembled all over. . . -\n1\nHere the explanation almost lies on the surface, and\nthere cannot be any doubt that it could tit many cases.\nBut suppose it is undoubtedly disproved in but one clear\ninstance, what then ? Are we to maintain that the experience\nof the \"Italian gentleman of the Jewish persuasion\" is still\nto be put down to Home watching the expression of his face\nat the appropriate letter when we read that at another seance\nat Mr. Trollope's house,\nthere was present a well-known and much respected English banker\nestablished in Florence, a hale, robust, cheery sort of man. . . .\nA \" spirit \" was announced as having come for him. Who is it 1\nA name was rapped out in the manner described. The elderly\nbanker declared that he never had any friend or relative of that\nname, and had never heard it before. A second time the name was\nspelled out, while the banker sat thrashing out his recollections.\nSuddenly he struck his forehead with his hand and exclaimed :\nu By Heaven, it is true ! Nancy ! (I forget the name). She\nwas my nurse in Yorkshire more than half a century ago !\n\" . . .\nTaking into consideration the total severance of the old banker's\ninfancy both as to years and locality from any of his then surround-\nings, the fact that it was so long since he had heard the name in\n1\nWhat I Remember, by T. Adolphus Trollope, Vol. I. pp. 391-392. I am\nindebted to Miss Johnson for this reference.\n\f514 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [pakt\nquestion mentioned that he had himself entirely forgotten it, and\nthe further fact that there was nobody at Florence who had any\nconnection with him or his family in his early years, and the cir-\ncumstance that he that evening saw Mr. Hume for the first time\n\u2014\nI confess that it seems to me that the improbability of any proposed\nexplanation of the mystery must be incalculably great indeed for\na solution, the improbability of which approaches so very near to\nimpossibility, to be preferably accepted. 1\nFrom which it follows that the theory which presented\nitself almost irresistibly to the reader's mind as an explanation\nof the first incident' proves in the present instance utterly\ninsufficient ; and should consecpuently hardly be pressed too\nmuch as a general solution of a certain category of the Home\nmysteries.\nSo it may be with regard to many of the incidents\nadduced by Miss Johnson in her paper. Taken separately^\nthey seem to point to \" suggestions \" as not only the most\nnatural, but the almost inevitable explanation. But it does\nnot follow that this is necessarily the true one.\nAt the same time it goes without saying that if we postu-\nlate : (a) the general untrustworthiness of the accounts of\nHome's stances ; (&) the probability of his having been able at\ntimes to impress hallucinations or illusions on some of his\nsitters ; and (c) especially the possibility of such impressed\nillusions being sometimes (as suggested by Miss Johnson)\ncoupled with fraud, we shall have dealt the Home evidence a\nmost damaging blow.\nPoint (a) is perhaps the most worthy of note and the\nmost discouraging. And it is especially to be regretted that\nthere are unsatisfactory features even in our best Home\nevidence,\u2014that coming from scientists of world-wide fame.\nFor, with all due respect to them, it seems to me distinctly\nunsatisfactory that the most startling incidents should be\nsometimes described in a few lines of print only ; that in\nother cases recollections more than twenty years old, and\napparently not based on any contemporary notes, should be\ndeemed sufficient ; and that we should be told again and\nagain that such and such phenomena occurred under specially\npre-arranged conditions, without, at least in most cases, being\n1\nNational Jieview, May 1890, pp. 306-307.\n\fNote on Miss Johnson's Paper. 515\nshown what these conditions were. And if such drawbacks\noccur in our best testimony, what wonder if witnesses of\nmuch inferior scientific standing do not conform to the\nrequired standard.\nAgain, Miss Johnson thinks it \" very significant \" that\nthere should be so wide a difference between Mr. Burr's first\naccount of his experience with a materialised hand published\nin 1863 and that given in Mme. Home's work 32 years\nafter the event. I also think such a discrepancy unfor-\ntunate from the positive side ; but I do not see in this a\ndecisive proof that Mr. Burr was labouring, in 1887, under\na hallucination of memory. It is perhaps possible, though,\nI admit, not very probable, that if Mr. Burr abstained in\n1863 from recounting the whole of his experience, it was\nsimply because the public at large were less prepared then\nfor such a thins; as a materialised hand with a human fore-\nfinger pushed right through it, than they could be supposed\nto be a quarter of a century later, after the public stage\nhad long been occupied by Slade, Eglinton and other marvel-\nmongers, and after so many persons of scientific eminence had\n\" endorsed \" the most stupendous mecliumistic miracles.\nTo my mind the main thing is not why Mr. Burr omitted\nto mention in 1863 a fact on which he dwelt at length in\n1887, but what kind of witness he was. If he resembled\nin this respect some Spiritualists with whom I have the\npleasure of being personally acquainted,\u2014well, I can only say\nI should reject his testimony unhesitatingly if brought forward\neven thirty- two days, not years, after the event.\nBut to return to illusion versus the \" Physical Phenomena.\"\nQuite lately, at the S.P.B. meeting of June 29th, 1908, we\nhad the old story of the photographing of the Indian fakirs\nbrought to the front again, and this time by an undoubted\neye-witness {Journal S.P.R., Vol. XIII. p. 273, July, 1908).\nHere, I think, is the crux of the whole matter. Let Dr.\nMehrji properly authenticate his story, and the old controversy\nwill be brought very near a definite settlement. Till this is\ndone, all this theorising, whether for or against the objectivity\nof the \" Physical Phenomena,\" appears to me little more\nthan beating the air. What we want is new facts, and I\nearnestly trust we shall get them.\n\f516 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nSUPPLEMENT.\nREVIEWS.\nPsicologia e \" Spiritismo\" : Impressioni e note critiche sui fenomeni\nmedianici di Eusapia Paladino, by E. Morselli. (2 vols. Fratelli\nBocca, Turin, 1908.)\nThe fame of Professor Morselli as a nerve-specialist and psychologist\nis world-wide, and his pronouncements on the mediumistic pheno-\nmena of Eusapia Paladino cannot therefore but excite considerable\ninterest. The book before us, in two thick volumes, consists of\nthree parts, besides a valuable bibliography of the literature of\nmodern spiritualism and Psychical Eesearch, and Professor Morselli\napproaches the subject with a wide, if not in every case deep, 1\nacquaintance with this literature. Part I. treats of modern spiritual-\nism and mediumship generally, and gives a brief history of Eusapia\nPaladino. Part II., which occupies the greater part of the book,\nconsists of descriptions (written on the night of the sitting or as\nsoon after as possible) of the twenty-eight sittings the author has\nhad with her. Twenty of these sittings took place in 1901 and\n1902, and six in the winter of 1906-7. It is these last six which\nhave excited most interest among psychical researchers in this\ncountry, doubtless because much publicity was given to them\nthrough the Italian daily press ; but it is interesting to note that\nProfessor Morselli himself considers them inferior to the earlier\nones, and that he is of opinion that Eusapia's mediumship has\ndeteriorated. 2\nA great deal of general discussion, psychological,\nbiological, theoretical and critical, accompanies the narrative, and\n1\n1 have noticed some misunderstandings and misrepresentations of passages\nfrom works with which I am acquainted, but possibly this may only be due\nto quoting from memory or from inadequate notes.\n2\n1 do not think that, as described, any of Professor Morselli's experiences\nappear as striking as those of Sir Oliver Lodge on the lie Roubaud.\n\fLVI.] Review. 517\nthe author is specially interested in demonstrating that the spiritual-\nistic hypothesis is unreasonable, superfluous and absurd. 1\nThe third part of the book, which is quite short, is a sort of\nsummary of Eusapia Paladino's \" mediumistic \" phenomena and the\nvarious hypotheses held concerning them. Professor Morselli's own\nconclusion is that the great majority of the phenomena that occur\nat her seances are genuine manifestations of some kind of super-\nnormal activity to be explained by hitherto unknown psychical\nforces connected with the human organism. A few of those\ndescribed may, he thinks, be due to illusion, and a small propor-\ntion\u2014say 10 per cent, or less\u2014are due to fraud (Vol. L, p. 312).\nFor none is a spiritualistic explanation required, and \"John King,\"\nEusapia's \"spirit guide,\" is not a real entity.\nTo the views expressed in this last sentence we may safely assent.\nIt is difficult at least to conceive how any serious student can\nsuppose that the hypothesis of the agency of \" spirits \" would render\nEusapia's phenomena more intelligible. But we need not dwell on\nthis, for the previous question\u2014whether there are any supernormal\nphenomena to explain\u2014occupies the field, and the more important\npoint is not to prove the absence of spiritual agency, but to prove\nthe absence of tricks. To the present Avriter it does not seem that\nin Professor Morselli's work quite enough attention is given to\nshowing that trickery was adequately guarded against, or that a\nsufficient margin is allowed, beyond what within known laws of\nnature is apparently possible, to justify the assumption that these\nlaws have been transcended.\nAs Professor Morselli says, there is a great sameness about the\ngeneral scheme of Eusapia's seances. After reading his book, I again\nread through the notes of the Cambridge sittings of 13 years ago,\nx\nIa proving this he sometimes uses rather double-edged arguments. Thus\nlie takes pains to point out that the position and nature of, eg. the touches\nare generally such as they would be if sometimes Eusapia's hands and some-\ntimes her feet were used to produce them. For example, only the sitters\nnext to her are touched on the side, as it were with her feet. More distant\nsitters are touched, if at all, on the back of the hands (on the table) or on\nthe face (cf. Vol. I., p. 276), as it were with her hand. It is as if, Professor\nMorselli says, Eusapia had the idea of touching thus\u2014as if she represents it\nthus to herself. He draws the inference that we are not dealing with any\npsychological entity other than hers, but that her powers are increased,\nexteriorised, by means of some unknown biological law. It is obvious that\nthe facts mentioned may equally point to trickery, if we can suppose a hand\nor foot free.\n2k\n\f518 Mrs. Henry Siclgwick. [part\nand was struck afresh with this. With us, as with him, the\nsittings usually began with movements and levitations of the table,\noften in a goodish light. The phenomena that followed\u2014touches,\ngrasps, movement of objects, appearances as of hands or other\nextensions of Eusapia's limbs, and occasionally lights, depended\nevidentially almost entirely on adequate holding of her hands and\nfeet in a poor light, or almost complete darkness. I may remark\nin passing that our conditions of holding seem to have been, on\nthe whole, better than those in use at Professor Morselli's sittings,\nfor whenever Eusapia would allow it, we held her feet with our\nhands instead of trusting to contact between the sitters' feet and\nhers. There is one respect in which the plan of the sittings seems\nto have developed since 1895, namely, in the importance of the\npart played by the curtained recess. At Cambridge no dark cur-\ntained recess was specially provided. There were window curtains\nin Mr. Myers's drawing-room where we sat, and also curtains\nbetween two parts of the room. Both these sets of curtains were\nused at different sittings \u2014the table being placed near them at first,\nor moved there after the sitting had began. By supposed super-\nnatural force the cm'tains were from time to time thrown forward\nover the sitters or between Eusapia and those next to her. 1\nBut\nthey played a less important part than at Professor Morselli's\nsittings, and there were no thin black curtains hung between the\nordinary heavy curtains to serve as a veil between the sitter and\nthe hands that touched him. Nor were the objects for use at the\nseance placed behind the curtains at Cambridge.\nIn another respect, Professor Morselli's experiences differed from\nand went beyond ours. He had, and we had not, a sitting for\n\" Materialisations.\" This\u2014it was his twenty-second, and took place\nin March, 1902\u2014he regarded as the high-water mark of Eusapia\nPaladino's manifestations. She was tied to a camp bedstead on\nwhich she lay behind the curtains, and half-length figures with\nhead enveloped as with a scarf (or once as with a frilled cap),\nappeared at the openings in a poor light. Readers will probably\ndiffer as to whether this adds to the Aveight of evidence for the\ngenuineness of Eusapia or the reverse. So far as I can judge of\nthe conditions from Professor Morselli's description of them, I do\nnot think we should have regarded them as convincing in the case\n1\nOne of the few unexplained phenomena which occurred at Cambridge was\nconnected with a curtain just behind the medium, which on one occasion,\nin a good light, bulged out several times as though there were wind behind it.\n\fLVI.] Review. 519\nof the \"materialisations\" I have personally witnessed with other\nmediums. These other mediums, however, failed to satisfy us, and\nsooner or later were caught personating the materialised spirit by\ninvestigators less scrupulous about seizing the \" spirit \" than our-\nselves.\nMaterialisations of this sort, showing faces and forms, are recorded\ncomparatively rarely with Eusapia, but they may be said to be led\nup to by the phenomena that are of constant occurrence. For the\ntouches felt at almost every seance are supposed to be made by\nmaterialised hands, and sometimes these hands are seen. Some-\ntimes, too, a roundish object suggesting a head appears silhouetted\nagainst some faintly-illuminated background, or some faintly-illumi-\nnated limb or other object appears against the darker background.\nAt some of Professor Morselli's sittings what were taken for parts\nof a human form were felt pressing against the curtains from\nbehind. There was no question of an accomplice, and on some\noccasions sitters were allowed to look behind the curtains and saw\nnothing. It is not clear, however, whether such looking was always\nsimultaneous with the touches, and even if it was, supposing these\nto be done by Eusapia's hand or arm (as the description sometimes\nsuggests to the reader), a person giving a rapid glance in a very\npoor light and expecting to see a whole figure might easily be\ndeceived. These materialised limbs, whether seen or only felt, seldom\neven appear to operate beyond the reach of the medium's own\nnatural hands or feet or head,1\nand the reason for taking them to\nbe anything else is simply that her limbs are supposed to be held\nor watched by the sitters.\nI may illustrate this by some experiences at Cambridge. At the\nfirst sitting of the Cambridge series, after various phenomena had\noccurred, I (and others) saw a hand between me and the window.\nAt first I thought it was Eusapia's hand, but Mr. Myers said he\nwas holding her hand on her lap at the time. Later in the sitting\nEusapia said that John King was coming out from the curtain\n1\nProfessor Morselli thinks that sometimes hands operated and objects were\nmoved beyond Eusapia's reach, and this was also occasionally thought by some\nobservers at the Cambridge sittings. But there is at the sittings so much\nmoving of the position of the whole circle, including the medium, so much\nrestlessness altogether, and so much difficulty in ascertaining what were the\nexact relative positions before the phenomena, that it is difficult to get clear\nevidence on this point. Moreover, careful experiments would be required to\ndetermine the limits of possible reaching, which are wider than is often\nsupposed.\n\f520 Airs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nbehind her. Presently several of the sitters saw a white object\nwith a rounded point to it moving behind Mr. Myers, who sat at\nEusapia's right hand, and against whose shoulder her head was\nresting. Mr. X., who was next but one to her on the same side,\nwas new to the phenomena, and apparently did not realise that\n\" grabbing \" without leave was against rules. H e put out his hand\nand touched the object, which thereupon drew back. He said it felt\nlike a hand, or at all events something more solid than the cur-\ntain (which had been moving about previously). Afterwards, \"John\nKing\" said he had used the medium's handkerchief to produce this\nphenomenon, and asked where the handkerchief was, thinking appa-\nrently that Mr. X. had taken it. After the sitting, Eusapia's\nhandkerchief was found lying behind the curtain. It is obvious\nin this case that, if Eusapia had got her right hand free, she was\nin a convenient position to use it to produce this phenomenon.\nAgain, at a certain point of the second sitting of the series,\nEusapia was standing up, Mr. Myers had her left hand, and Mrs. (after-\nwards Lady) Stanley her right hand. I was in charge of her feet,\nand was consequently lying on the floor holding them. As I looked\nup from that position, the ceiling made a light background, against\nwhich I saw silhouetted what looked exactly like Eusapia's right\narm and hand lifting a chair and placing it on the table. After\nthe chair was on the table, I similarly saw against the ceiling\nEusapia's arm and Lady Stanley's apparently holding each other by\nthe hand. I did not see any transition. Lady Stanley reported\nthat on this occasion Eusapia had drawn her (Lady S.'s) hand to\nher (E.'s) body, and the pressure on her hand became that of two\nfingers. The chair was lifted on to the table, and then the fingers\nleft Lady Stanley's hand, and Eusapia's cool hand returned and\nclosed over it.\nIt may be asked why, after experiences like these, we did not\ngive up the sittings, convinced that we had to do with a trickster,\nespecially with the warning of Signor Torelli Viollier, repeated by Pro-\nfessor Richet, in our minds. No doubt the events above described were\nsuspicious ; but we had behind us the seances at the ile Eoubaud\nwhich had so greatly impressed Sir Oliver Lodge and Mr. Myers\n;\nphenomena, like the best of those on the island, might be coming.\nBesides, we had so far no proof of trickery. Lady Stanley felt and\ndescribed very accurately the way the hand resting on hers nar-\nrowed till it became like two fingers 1\n; but they were fingers, of that\nl\nSee Journal S.P.R., Vol. VII., p. 150.\n\fLVI.] Review. 521\nshe was sure, and where did the fingers come from if the other\nhand was well held? We had not yet traced the drawing of the two\nhands together and the substitution of part of one for the other.\nSo we went on, sometimes depressed but sometimes cheered up\nagain, through twelve sittings. Others besides Lady Stanley noticed\nthe narrowing of the hand, and sometimes the brief gap in the\ncontact which she had so carefully described, but still no one\nobserved the actual substitution of one hand for the other. We\nthought the sittings on the whole sufficiently successful and impres-\nsive for it to be worth while to invite eminent men of science, and\non one occasion a well-known conjurer, to witness them.\nMr. Hodgson arrived from America after the twelfth sitting.\nWhat he did was to systematise the observations. He was, of course,\nan experienced observer, and had given much attention to tricks\nof various kinds, both as practised by mediums and by professional\nconjurers. At his first sitting he observed the narrowing of the\nhand as Lady Stanley had done. It was at his second sitting, the\nfourteenth of the series, that he was able to observe the whole pro-\ncess of substitution, and the way one hand represented both while\nthe other was free. The more important part of the report of this\nsitting was printed in the S.P.R. Journal, Vol. VII., pp. 151-5, and I\nneed not repeat it here. After this others of us were able to observe,\nover and over again, the process of freeing a hand or a foot. It was\ndone with skill, care and caution, 1\nand evidently with deliberation.\n1\n1 should like to say that after our Cambridge experiences I realised that\nsecure holding under the conditions allowed is much more difficult than I\nhad previously supposed, and I should not now attribute unusual gullibility\nto any one who failed to detect the substitution. I say this because I expressed\na different view after certain experiences at Carqueiranne. See Journal,\nVol. VI., p. 340. On that occasion I held the left hand, and Dr. Segard was\nresponsible for the right hand. An accordion placed near was passed on to\nthe table between Dr. Segard and the medium at about the level of their\nshoulders, and against a faintly-illuminated background I could see it being-\nbrought forward by what looked like the outline of a hand and arm, which\nI should have felt sure were Eusapia's right hand and arm, had not Dr. Segard\nbeen sure he was holding her right hand. Later, each time Professor Richet,\nwho was under the table holding Eusapia's feet, said he was touched, I could\nsee her stooping about as much as was, I should judge, required in order to\ntouch him with her right hand. Each time I asked Dr. Segard whether he\nwas really sure that he was holding the right hand, and he said he was.\nSince our Cambridge experiences I have felt no doubt that the right hand\nwas free, and that I had allowed the left hand with mine holding it to approach\nDr. Segard and represent two hands. But I do not now think this argues\nunusual ineptness as observers either in Dr. Segard or myself.\n\f522 Mrs. Henry Sidgwick. [part\nAfter studying the notes of our previous experiences, and compar-\ning with them what we now perceived, we felt no doubt that the\ntrick had been practised throughout, and that no holding under any\nsuch conditions as prevailed at Eusapia's sittings is to be relied on.\nWe, and especially Mr. Hodgson, have been blamed for allowing\nEusapia to get her hand free when we began to see what was\nhappening. 1\nI cannot understand this point of view. When there\nseems to be a clue to the modus operandi the only scientific pro-\ncedure is surely to follow it wherever it may lead\u2014whether to\nexposure of fraud or proof of genuineness. Before we realised the\nclue, through twelve sittings, we had done our best under such\nconditions as Eusapia would allow to obtain phenomena of whose\ngenuineness we could feel no doubt, so that she had had every\nopportunity of proving her powers to be supernormal, if proof was\npossible. The result was that the evidence depended almost entirely\non the holding of hands and feet, and in connexion with this hold-\ning there were suspicious circumstances. It became, therefore, of\nthe utmost importance to follow any clue which might enable us\nto estimate the value of holding such as Eusapia allowed.\nI have dwelt thus long upon our experiences at Cambridge,\nalthough so much of the tale has been already told, partly because\nI do not think Professor Morselli has altogether understood what\nhappened there, and partly because it enables me to bring out\nclearly in what resjjects and why my judgment differs from his.\nHe is evidently a good and careful observer, he is aware that\nEusapia Paladino does sometimes trick, and has, in fact, himself\n1\nThere is another matter in which we have been blamed. A legend has\ngrown up in France and Italy that we treated Eusapia Paladino unkindly. I\ndo not know whether she is herself responsible for this legend. If she is, it\nis perhaps not unnatural, but I think it is ungrateful. We did our best to\nkeep her happy and amused, and took a great deal of trouble about it, and\nas far as we could judge were fairly successful, except during a day or two\nwhen she was not well. She lived in Mr. and Mrs. Myers's house, and lived\nwith the family. She constantly played croquet in the garden with the\nchildren, and after Mr. Hodgson came she played with great gusto with him ;\nwe used to take her out shopping (at our expense), in which she delighted,\nand to take her out for carriage drives and sight-seeing expeditions, e.g. to\nLondon. Professor Morselli speaks of some offensive searching to find trick\napparatus to which she had been exposed somewhere, and suggests that it\nwas at Cambridge. The nearest approach to this that I ever heard of was\nthat on one or two occasions, after a good stance, Mrs. Myers accompanied\nher to her bedroom when she went up to bed, helped her to undress, and\nfolded her clothes for her.\n\fLVI.] Revieiv. 523\nsometimes detected her in trickery or what looked suspiciously like\nit. But he appears to think that when on any particular occasion\ntrickery has not been detected by sensible persons responsible for\nwatching the medium, the presumption is that it has not occurred.\nIn this I cannot agree. I have not the same confidence that he\nhas in my own or any one else's powers of continuous observation,\nespecially in darkness or semi-darkness ; and when it has been\nshown that a medium systematically practises trickery, the pre-\nsumption, I think, is that on any particular occasion when an\nunexplained phenomenon takes place, an opportunity for trickery\nunobserved by the investigator has been found. It must be\nremembered that the medium is not bound to produce phenomena\nat any given time. If no opportunity occurs nothing need happen.\nIn this a tricking medium is at a great advantage as compared\nwith an ordinary conjurer.\nI do not profess to explain everything that is described by Pro-\nfessor Morselli. Most of it is not difficult, if a free hand or foot\nis granted ; but I think there are other tricks, and any explanation\nof them I might offer would be conjectural. I may point out that\neven a professional conjurer could not probably explain a conjuring\ntrick with which he was unfamiliar from the description of a witness\nwho had not detected it. It is because essential points have not\nbeen observed that the observer has been puzzled. Mr. S. J. Davey's\nexperiments give proof of this, if proof be needed.\nSome phenomena which the freeing of a hand or foot will not\nexplain should be mentioned in addition to the materialisation\nphenomena already referred to when the medium was tied to the\nbed behind the curtain. On another occasion (Vol. I., pp. 441-6),\npart of the experience described seems to require her to have freed\nherself completely, so as to be able to leave the table and go behind\nthe curtain. Of a different kind, but again not depending I think\non failure in holding hands, are certain levitations of the table,\nespecially one described in Vol. I., p. 424. Mr. Hodgson gave some\nattention to this subject, and was himself able to hold up a heavy\ntable a foot off the ground in a manner resembling Eusapia's, by\npassing a band round his shoulders, under his waist-belt, and round\na leg of the table. In the particular case above referred to, the\ntable seems to have risen too high for this method. Experiments\nin the raising of tables by this and other mechanical means should\nbe tried, if importance is to be attached to the phenomenon.\nAnother phenomenon, where there is no question of holding hands\n\f524 Mrs. Henry SidgwicL: [part\nor feet, was the movement of a small bell along the table and\nother movements of objects in a good light in a manner which\nwould be explained if we could suppose the use of a thread (see\nVol. L, p. 425, and Vol. II., pp. 202-3).\nOne more point. Importance has been attached to the question\nwhether Eusapia Paladino is genuinely entranced during the occur-\nrence of at least part of the phenomena. I think it probable that\nshe is. Professor Morselli thinks so, and he and other medical\nobservers ought to know. This might be important if it were our\nbusiness to decide on the degree of moral blame attaching to the\nnormal Eusapia, though I think that a strong case could be made out\nfor collusion between her normal and trance consciousness. But in\ndeciding the matter actually before us, namely, what the evidence\nis for attributing the physical phenomena produced by Eusapia to\nhitherto unknown powers, the question whether she was entranced\nseems to me of no importance whatever. Systematic trickery may\nbe practised in a frequently recurring auto-hypnotic condition as well\nas in a normal one.\nIn conclusion, Professor Morselli's work gives the added weight\nof his authority to that of other eminent persons who have con-\nvinced themselves that Eusapia Paladino, notwithstanding trickery,\ndoes exhibit phenomena which cannot be explained by known\nphysical or biological laws. He admits, however, that in order to\nobtain any real understanding of these extended biological powers,\nexamination of them in the case of some person who will allow\nreal scientific experiment is necessary, and he does not intend to\nspend more time on Eusapia. If, in spite of all that has been said\nabout her, I personally still doubt whether the prima facie case for\nbelieving in a residuum of genuine phenomena in her case is\nsufficient, it is owing to a long course of experiment and disillusion-\nment with fraudulent physical mediums. Nevertheless I do not\nat all deny that there are grounds for thinking that such extended\npowers do exist, and if so, their investigation is very important.\nOur hope of discovering the truth about them lies in their being\ndeveloped in private persons willing to take trouble and allow in-\nvestigation, and should Professor Morselli's work stimulate and lead\nto the discovery of such persons, it will not have been thrown away.\nEleanor Mildred Sidgwick.\nP.S. \u2014Since the above review was written, an investigation of\nEusapia Paladino has been carried out for the Society for Psychical\n\fLVI.] Revieiv. 52o\nResearch by Mr. Feilding, Mr. Baggallj', and Mr. Carrington\u2014all\nexperts in the tricks of physical mediums\u2014and I understand that they\nhave come substantially to the same conclusion as Professor Morselli.\nTheir reports will doubtless appear in a future Part of the Proceeding*.\nE. M. S.\nThe Naturalisation of the Supernatural, by Frank Podmore.\n(G. P. Putnam's Sons; New York and London, 1908. 374 pp.\nPrice 7s. 6d. net.)\nThe title of this most attractive and very useful book is un-\ndoubtedly to a certain extent misleading. If by \" naturalisation\n\"\nis meant\u2014as seems indeed obvious\u2014\" explaining away on natural\n[in the everyday sense of the word] lines,\" then Mr. Podmore\nleaves a good deal unexplained. Practically out of the whole domain\nof Psychical Research, 11\nPoltergeists \" and clairvoyance at close\nquarters seem to be almost the only two groups of alleged \" pheno-\nmena\" towards which he still maintains an uncompromisingly negative\nattitude. That he should admit the reality of telepathy (and by\nthe way, whilst fully realising the stupendous difficulties which stand\nin the way of a physical explanation, Mr. Podmore sees grounds for\nhoping that these difficulties may ultimately diminish, see p. 14) is\nof course not to be wondered at. But the position he has taken\nup in the work under consideration especially towards the spirit-\nhypothesis and even, to a certain extent, towards the \"Physical\nPhenomena of Spiritualism \" appears to me more unexpected. It\nstrikes me as somewhat significant that the chapter on \" Spiritualism\n\"\n(chiefly devoted to recounting Davey's slate-writing feats) should,\nclose as follows\n:\n\"It cannot be said that these recent researches [with Eusapia\nPaladino] have done much to strengthen the case for Eusapia's\ngenuineness. . . . But if we can attach little weight to the records,\nit is impossible not to be impressed by the scientific standing and\nthe obvious sincerity of the witnesses . . . [who] have no manner\nof doubt that they have witnessed in Eusapia's presence phenomena\ninexplicable by any known force. If they do not enable us to share\ntheir conviction, they at any rate compel us to hold our judgment\nin suspense. There is at any rate a problem here, for the solution\nof which we must wait. If the things are genuine, we want to\nknow how they are done ; if fraudulent, how it is that so many\ncompetent observers have come to believe in their genuineness\n\"\n(pp. 201-2).\n\f526 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo, [part\nMore suggestive still are many passages in the sections of the\nbook dealing with such topics as \"Communication with the Dead\"\n(Ch. IX.), \"Messages received through trance and automatism\"\n{Ch. XII), \" Haunted Houses\" (Ch. XI.) and the inevitable Mrs. Piper\n(Ch. XIII.). Mr. Podmore admits that \"those investigators who\nof recent years have given the closest study to the case of Mrs. Piper\nand other automatists have been led to attach increasing weight\nto the hypothesis of some form of spirit-communication \"\n(pp. 207-8)\n;\nhe does not deny that \" we have clearly no right to lay down a priori\na standard to which spirit-communication should conform \" (p. 208)\n;\nand a propos of Professor Miinsterberg's preposterous statement\n{Psychology and Life, p. 252) :\n\" [With regard to the question] whether\ndeparted spirits enter into communication with living men by mediums\nand by incarnation the scientist does not admit a compromise\n;\n... he flatly denies the possibility . . . the facts as they are\nclaimed do not exist and never will exist,\" he says :\n\"The man who at the present stage of the enquiry invites us\non the strength \u2014or weakness\u2014of the evidence so far available to\nacclaim the proof of human immortality, may be doing serious injury\nto his own cause. But the other man who, because our present\nignorance does not enable us to decide what is the true meaning\nof these elusive 'seemings,' condemns the whole enquiry as abortive,\nhas surely no title to speak in the name of science \"\n(p. 210).\nMr. Podmore thinks that if some peculiarly striking cases accumu-\nlated by the Society for Psychical Research should ultimately be\nmultiplied, the conclusion of post-mortem agency \" would no doubt\nappear less dubious\" (p. 274); he admits that \"the assumption of\nan alien personality speaking through the entranced person \" has\nbeen in certain cases made \"by observers whose training and special\nknowledge render them peculiarly qualified to form a judgment in\nsuch matters \" (p. 284, footnote) ; and he winds up his account of\nMrs. Piper by pointing out, though, it is true, in a dubious form,\nthat \"in certain cases, at any rate, we may come somehow into\ncontact with the minds of the dead \"\n(p. 329). As we see, in spite\nof the book's delusive title, a good deal of the \" Supernatural \" has\nnot been \" naturalised \" by Mr. Podmore.\nAs I have just mentioned Mrs. Piper by name, I may as well\npoint out that I do not consider all the samples of the evidence\nbrought forward by the author in the chapter dealing with the\ncelebrated Boston Pythoness as altogether satisfactory. I must\nespecially protest against Mr. Podmore's summing up in less than\n\fLVI.] Revieiv. 527\ntwo pages (pp. 317-318) of such an episode as \"Uncle Jerry's\" in\nMrs. Piper's English sittings in 1889. The account is given, it is\ntrue, in Sir Oliver Lodge's words, but slightly abridged ; but in\nProceedings, Vol. VI., where the same account is printed, the reader\nmay also find, if he chooses to, the original notes of Sir Oliver's\nsittings covering many pages, and I think that after he has waded\nthrough, his impression may be somewhat different. For in such\nhighly-condensed accounts, especially if drawn up by a sympathetic\nobserver, stress will naturally be laid on the chief episodes, many\nattending circumstances and seemingly unimportant details being-\nomitted and the \" messages \" being given not in the piecemeal fashion\nin which they occurred, but in a coherent and impressive form, with\nthe main facts standing out in bold relief. But in Sir O. Lodge's\naccount mention is at least made of some of \"Uncle Jerry's\" mes-\nsages being false (p. 459), whilst in Mr. Podmore's all reference\nto this circumstance has dropped out. The impression on the\nuninitiated reader's mind may consequently be the deeper\u2014but it\nwill be an impression to a considerable extent erroneous. (With\nthe circumstance that many, if not most, of the incidents narrated\nfor evidential purposes by \" Uncle Jerry \" were exactly such as arise\nin the experience of almost nine out of ten human boys I am not\nconcerned here.)\nMr. J. T. Clarke's account of his sitting with the same medium\n(pp. 311-316) is more satisfactory, technically speaking; but much\nin Phinuit's statements to him which he thinks very remarkable\nstrike me as much less so, and I believe that, after an inspection\nby no meaus too severe, but little remains even as evidence of\ntelepathy. The most curious thing is that Mr. Podmore should not\napparently disapprove of Mr. Clarke putting down as \"correct\"\nsuch statements as \"there is lots of trouble all over you, but I see\nlight beyond . . . you will wade through it all right in the end \"\n\u2014\nwhich statement bears a most suspicious resemblance to the common-\nplace fortune-teller's twaddle ; nor of the same gentleman writing-\nin all seriousness :\n\" My child was in Germany at the time, and thus lived in my\nmemory rather than in my daily view. Hence although the\nmedium felt that she was alive . . . her personality was yet spoken\nof as 'in the spirit.'\n\"\nPhinuit, it should be said, in answer to a question as to the\nwhereabouts of the sitter's daughter, had begun by saying: \"She\nis in the spirit,\" but had quickly added :\n\" That is to say, her\n\f528 Goun t Perovshy-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nspirit is here, but her body is at a distance.\" One may conclude,\nwithout being a hypercritical person, that Phinuit's correction was\ndue merely to Mr. Clarke having betrayed in some wajr\nthat the\nfirst shot had been wide of the mark. This gentleman prefers\nanother explanation; but does Mr. Podmore endorse itl\nI also think that a statement such as that the sitter has an\nuncle named John (on which, by the way, Phinuit did not insist\nwhen contradicted) even if proved correct afterwards, should not be\nconsidered particularly evidential (p. 313); nor do I find much\nresemblance between two such names as Williamson (first said to be\nWilliams) and Lambertson (p. 312); nor do I think that \"changing\"\nmy \"house\" is identical in meaning with my wife being \"away\nfrom her house\" (p. 315) ; nor does it strike me as very extraordinary\nthat a piano and a clock should be the chief features of two particular\nrooms (p. 316). It is, I think, somewhat unfortunate that such\na sitting should have been brought forward by Mr. Podmore as a\nsample of the Piper evidence, and presumably a particularly favourable\none.\nThe \" G. P.\" communications, indeed, stand on a different footing.\nBut here objections of another kind arise.\nThe question which will naturally first present itself to the reader\nis: What opportunities did Mrs. Piper have to obtain information\nabout G. P., his friends and circumstances, by normal means % The\nfact that in other cases she undoubtedly made no private enquiries\n(for in the great majority of cases the poorest amateur detective\nwould have done far better than her \" controls \") is after all no\ndefinite proof. There may have been exceptional facilities in\nG. P.'s case. (He died in New York in 1892, and Mrs. Piper\nwas there at the time.) If so, what importance can we attach,\nfor instance, to G. P. having mentioned to the Howards by name his\nfriends Berwick and Orenberg 1 (Mr. Podmore, p. 325). The question\nis : Could or could not Mrs. Piper have learnt by normal means that\nG.P. had friends of that name 1 If she could not, this ought, I\nthink, to have been so stated, possibly with the grounds for such\na conclusion. If she could\u2014well, the incident is evidentially worth-\nless, and if so, what is the use of adducing it? Taking a professional\nmedium's honesty for granted in an enquiry involving issues so\nmomentous, even in one particularly striking instance, seems to me a\nrisky thing.\nI say \" particularly striking \" because, as a general rule, the Piper\nspirits so persistently avoid giving surnames, whilst revelling in\n\fLVI.] Revieiv. 529\nChristian names (especially of the William-Mary-John type). This\nis already bad enough ; and so it is the more unfortunate that\nsuch a rara avis as this \" Berwick-Orenberg \" incident should be\napparently open\u2014without, I think, undue straining\u2014to a natural\ninterpretation.\nThis avoiding of surnames is indeed a very curious thing. I can\nunderstand an order of existence in which all names, Christian and\nothers, should be dropped, though I do not well see what could\nbe used instead with equal convenience. But on what charitable\nhypothesis can we understand the persistence of one set of names\nand the discarding of the other 1 And, again, suppose there were\nonly three surnames in existence for Englishmen and Americans,\n\u2022 say Smith, Jones and Roberts : would it be too hard on Mrs. Piper\nto conjecture that they would turn up much oftener than they\ndo now 1\nTo return to G-. P., Mr. Podmore, who notes in passing (p. 328)\nthat even that spirit has on more than one occasion evaded test\nquestions put to him, might have added, I think, that not content\nwith this, Gr. P. has repeatedly given false information (Proceedings,\nVol. XIII., p. 303, 334, 335). He is also responsible for corroborat-\ning false statements made by other Piper spirits .(Proceedings, Vol.\nXV., p. 24) and his way of constantly referring to books lent to his\nfriends without ever giving the title of the book is distinctly\nirritating.\nI confess I am to a certain extent in sympathy with Mr. Andrew\nLang when I find him saying\n:\n\"If Mr. H., or Phinuit, or G. P. were honourable spirits [i.e. what\nthey pretend to be] they would say they don't know, when they\ndon't know. They would not give false information, '\nnatural enough\n'\n(easily guessed) but totally wrong\" (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV.,\np. 42).\n'\nAnd again :\n\"That spirits in the next life making use of Mrs. Piper's brains,\nnerves, voice and hands, should be confused is intelligible. But\nwhy should they be impudently mendacious, absurdly ignorant and\nfurtively evasive; fluent in twaddle and 'groping' when a simple\nquestion as to something familiar to them when alive is asked?\"\n{ibidem).\nOf course such a picture, if intended for Gr. P., is too darkly\n\u2022coloured ! I admit that some incidents connected with him are\ndecidedly startling (perhaps chiefly those which we are not\n\f530 Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo. [part\nallowed to know in detail : see especially Proceedings, Vol. XIII. pp.\n321-322) but precise^ in order to appreciate them at their true\nvalue we must have all the features of the episode before us in\nequal prominence, positive and negative. Otherwise Mr. Podmore's\nreaders (especially if his reputation of an out-and-out sceptic has\nreached them) will be apt to become too frantically enthusiastic\nabout G. P. and other Piperites, and surely frantic enthusiasm is not\na mood suited for our researches !\nAgain, remarkable as is the fact that many of G. P.'s former\nfriends became convinced, after sitting with Mrs. Piper, that they\nhad been conversing with him in propria persona, Mrs. Sidgwick's\nvery pertinent remarks on this subject may, I think, advantageously\nbe read. Says she :\n\" The representation given of the deceased person must from the\nnature of the case be of a very limited kind. For instance, when\nthe soi-disant G. P. communicates, he usually does so in writing, the\nwhole of Mrs. Piper's body except the hand being in an inert con-\ndition. At the best, therefore, he is limited to the words he writes\nand to the possibilities of dramatic representation of a person's\nwhole maniere d'etre through the movements of the hand alone. The\nhand-writing ... is not like that of the living G. P. The case is not\nmaterially improved when the communication is by spoken words,\nfor gesture and expression and voice are still excluded from the like-\nness and the '\nlanguage shows a tendency to depart more or less\nfrom the language that would have been used by the communicator\nwhen living.' 1\nA likeness under these circumstances must bear to*\na full dramatic representation of a person somewhat the relation\nthat a clever pen and ink sketch done in a few strokes bears to a\nfinished portrait in oils\" (Proceedings, Vol. XV., p. 21).\nIn short, most of such impressions, however convincing personally,\ndo not easily lend themselves to scientific estimation, and can hardly\neutrer en ligne de compte. (See in the same article by Mrs. Sidgwick,\na little further on, mention of a case when the personation of G. P.\nwas not thought successful, the sitter, Mr. Marte, also carrying on\nwith G. P. a conversation on \" philosophical \" subjects ; and a very\nqueer conversation on G. P.'s side it was, see pp. 26-7.)\nI do not deny that it is very remarkable that (Mr. Podmore, p. 326)\nG. P. recognised all his friends who visited Mrs. Piper under assumed\nnames, in no case making a mistake. Still with all that\u2014though\nthis must be of course a question of \"personal equation\"\u2014I must\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XIII., p. 332.\n\fLVI.] Review. 531\nsay that after reading one such narrative as \" Miss Morton's \" (Mr.\nPodmore, pp. 266-271, in the chapter on \"Haunted Houses\") I\nhave felt myself nearer something like an invisible world than after\nperusing hundreds of pages of the Piper records.\nTurning to other sections of the book, I will make one general\nremark-. It seems to me that somewhat undue prominence is given\nby Mr. Podmore to dreams as evidence of supernormal faculties.\nHe makes up a very conclusive case against them from this point\nof view, giving at length the various reasons for their evidential\ninferiority (pp. 76-80) ; but theory is one thing and practice another,\nand throughout the 365 Da\u00b0;es of Mr. Podmore's book we meet with\ndreams not infrequently. That the amount of coincidence involved\nin such a case as the one quoted on p. 343, where the percipient\ndreams of ducks buried in sand with heads protruding at a certain\nspot, only to learn a few hours afterwards that her dream corresponded\nexactly with actual facts, is such as to make explanation by\nchance coincidence extremely improbable, there can be no doubt\n;\nbut in this respect the incident in question is almost, though not\nquite, unique ; and some of the other instances of dream-fulfilment\ngiven in the book seem to me decidedly less striking and hardly\nbeyond the scope of chance coincidence, which no doubt gives\noccasionally results equally striking, as anybody, and I in par-\nticular, can testify from personal experience.\nShould not therefore dreams, and death dreams in particular, be\ngiven a wide berth in \" Psychical Research \" as a general rule,\n\u2014\na rule which should be infringed in very exceptional cases only 1\nBut it is perhaps time to bring this review to a close. I can only\ntake leave of Mr. Podmore's unusually interesting, very candid and\nvery much up-to-date book with hearty wishes for its success. May\nit very soon reach a second edition to begin with, in which case\nI would suggest to Mr, Podmore the desirability of depriving the\nlate Mr. Aksakoff of a title \u2014that of Professor\u2014which he never-\npossessed (p. 292).\nPerovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo.\ni\n\f\fFORMER PRESIDENTS OF THE SOCIETY FOR PSYCHICAL\nRESEARCH.\n1882-1884.\n1885-1887.\n1888-1892.\n1893.\n1894-1895.\n1896-1899.\n1900.\n1901-1903.\n1904.\n1905.\n1906-1907.\n1908.\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick,\nProfessor Balfour Stewart, F.R.S., -\nProfessor Henry Sidgwick,\nThe Right Hon.
