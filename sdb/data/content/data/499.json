An obituary will be\npublished in Proceedings.\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL POR 1940\nThe work of the Society has, owing to conditions created by the\nwar, been carried on during the past year under great and increasing\ndifficulties. Some forms of research have become impracticable, and\nmeetings of the Society, of which five were held in the first half of\nthe year, were discontinued in the latter half. The Council wish to\nreaffirm the policy set out in their last Annual Report of carrying\non the Society's \" activities, in research, publication and the holding\nof meetings, as fully as war conditions will permit \".\nThe Council particularly regret the loss of contact, due to the\nextension of the war, with psychical researchers in many Continental\ncountries.\nThey are glad to report that all the officers of the Society, including\nthe caretakers, have so far escaped personal injury, that no damage\nhas been done to our Library and archives, and no serious damage\nto our premises.\n(1) Research Work, (a) The Research Officer's Report. Some\nexperiments in card guessing and the paracognition of drawings,\nwhich were carried out during the early part of the year with a sub-\nject who had shown promise in previous tests, produced no evidence\nfor any paranormal effect. It seemed that the earlier faculty\u2014if\nindeed it were anything more than a series of lucky shots\u2014had been\ninhibited by the confused conditions of the war and the subject's\nreactions to the idea of military service.\nA number of spontaneous cases has been sent in\u2014though fewer\nthan in normal times\u2014and one has been printed in the Journal.\nThe remainder, after full examination, have been filed for reference.\nAccounts have been received of experiences which, though show-\ning little or no evidence of the operation of a paranormal faculty,\nare nevertheless of interest psychologically as having a possible\nbearing on the process of paranormal cognition. It is perhaps not\nsufficiently widely known that accounts of any unusual experiences,\nwhether from dream material or waking consciousness, are gladly\nreceived by the Society, and that the usual confidence will be ob-\nserved as to names and addresses. Dreams showing an ostensibly\nprecognitive content, but which proved in fact not to be veridical,\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 Annual Report of the Council for 1940 3\nare especially valuable owing to their being so rarely recorded,\nthough apparently of common occurrence.\nFurther progress has been made by Mr Redmayne with his work\non paracognition. Some of the improvements to his apparatus,\nwhich vrere foreshadowed in his paper in Proceedings, have been\ncarried out, and the results of a number of experiments with various\nsubjects have been communicated to the Research Officer. The\nanalysis of these is not yet complete.\nA number of communications has been received purporting to\ngive clues to the contents of the sealed envelope deposited with the\nSociety by the late Sir Oliver Lodge. All these will be carefully\nexamined when the time conies for opening the envelope. The\nattention of Members is invited to the suggestions in the Journal\nfor September- October ; if these are carried into effect, the evidential\nvalue of the experiment will be greatly enhanced. In view of\npublicity given by the press to the experiment, similar suggestions\nhave been made in letters published by Light and The Psychic News.\n(b) Other Research. Mr Whately Carington has continued his\nexperiments on the paranormal cognition of drawings. The results\nof the first five of these were described in detail in Part 162 of the\nProceedings (June 1940). Later than these, an experiment carried\nout at the end of 1939 intended to test the difference, if any, between\nthe results obtained when the originals were known, and when they\nwere unknown to the experimenter, has been scored and analysed.\nThe result was null, but this is probably attributable to the sections\nof the experiment being insufficiently separated in time rather than\nto knowledge on the part of the experimenter being ineffective.\nA more important experiment was organised in the spring of 1940.\nIn this, experimenters and groups of percipients from ten different\nUniversities in the British Isles participated. Five independent\nexperimenters drew and \" displayed \" originals in five separate, but\npartially contemporaneous, experiments, while the ten groups of\npercipients, arranged in pairs, tried to reproduce them. The result\nwas highly successful in the sense that the percipients as a whole\nscored to a significant extent more hits on the fifty originals used\nin these experiments than did the percipients of the first five ex-\nperiments ; on the other hand, they quite failed to distinguish be-\ntween the originals at which they were supposed to be aiming and\nthose at which they were not. This result seems likely to lead to\ninteresting theoretical conclusions.\nIt is hoped to publish full details of these two experiments shortly.\nFurther experiments are in progress, with special reference to\nevolving a repeatable technique such that any competent person\n\f4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1941\nwho cares to take the trouble can obtain positive results without\nundue labour.\nMr Soal is carrying out further experiments with one of the two\nsubjects whose work, reported in a recent paper, showed displace-\nment effects in the guessing of Zener cards. A method is being used\nwhich, while it retains the statistical principle of the Zener cards,\npermits of the objects of presentation being varied from one experi-\nment to another. It has also been arranged for the subject and the\nexperimenters to be in different rooms. Interesting results have\nalready been noted and if these continue it should be possible to\ndecide whether the apparent precognitive effects are to be inter-\npreted as a telepathic prevision by the subject of future mental\nstates of the agent.\nDr Hettinger has been preparing for the press a second volume on\nthe experiments conducted by him at King's College, London Uni-\nversity. Arrangements for further experiments by him, on dif-\nferent lines, which were upset by war conditions last autumn, will\nbe put into effect as soon as practicable.\n(2) Financial Position. It is too early to attempt to forecast the\nultimate effect of the war on the Society's finances, but the immedi-\nate strain is obvious. The tenant of the upper part of 31 Tavistock\nSquare has, to his great regret, found himself compelled to terminate\nhis tenancy by notice expiring at Christmas 1940, and it is very\ndoubtful whether in present conditions any other tenant could be\nfound. Moreover, while the Society's income from investments\nremains exempt from tax, the Inland Revenue Authorities have\ndecided against the Society's claim to recover tax on Subscriptions\nunder the Deeds of Covenant executed by some of our Members.\nFortunately the position of the Research Endowment Fund is quite\nsatisfactory, and the Trustees of that Fund have offered to make a\nrecommendation to the Council that assistance be given to the\nGeneral Fund in case of urgent necessity. On a comprehensive view,\ntherefore, there is no immediate cause for alarm, so long as every\nreasonable economy is practised, and (still more important) our\nMembers give the Society that degree of support which the Council\nconfidently expect.\n(3) Blennerhassett Trust. The Council wish to express their warm\nappreciation of the action of Mrs Blennerhassett, daughter of\nFrederic Myers, in founding a Trust, of which particulars were given\nin a recent Journal, for the advancement of Psychical Research.\nThey welcome the encouragement given to opening up \" novel lines\nof enquiry \", and the evidence of growing academic recognition of\nour subject shown by the acceptance by New College, Oxford, of the\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 Annual Report of the Council for 1940 5\nresponsibility for administering the Trust in the event (may it long\nbe deferred!) of the Society ceasing to exist.\n(4) Perrott, Studentship in Psychical Research. The Council con-\ngratulate the selectors at Cambridge on their appointment of Mr\nWhately Carington as first holder of the Studentship, particulars of\nwhich were recently published in Proceedings ; with equal warmth\nthey congratulate their colleague on his appointment. He began\nhis tenure of the Studentship in the Michaelmas term of 1940,\ncontinuing as Perrott Student the researches on paranormal per-\nception of drawings which he had previously been conducting for the\nS.P.R. in collaboration with their Cambridge Committee. Under the\nregulations of the Perrott Foundation, Trinity College, Cambridge\nappoints and pays one or more Supervisors, whose duty it is to keep\nin touch with the Student and his work. The College appointed\nMr Chambers, of the Psychological Laboratory at Cambridge, and\nDr. R. H. Thouless, who had been a valued member of the Cambridge\nCommittee from the outset. The S.P.R. had been paying Dr Thou-\nless an honorarium of \u00a310 per annum, out of the grant made for\nthe Cambridge experiments from the Research Fund, for the very\ngreat amount of time and trouble which he gave to the work of the\nCommittee. Dr Thouless remains a member of the Committee, but he\nhas generously declined to accept any payment from the Society for\nhis work in this connexion so long as he is being paid by the Per-\nrott Fund for supervising Mr Whately Carington's present research.\n(5) Presidency. Professor H. H. Price was re-elected for a second\nyear. The Council wish to place on record their warm appreciation\nof the active part he has taken in the Society's work, notwith-\nstanding the fact that he is engaged in special war work in addition\nto his ordinary academic duties.\n(6) Changes on the Council. In Sir Oliver Lodge the Council lost a\ncolleague of very long standing and the highest distinction, who had\nplayed a leading part in biiilding up the Society and shaping its\npolicy ; and in Mr Oliver Gatty, a young man of brilliant promise both\nin Science and Psychical Research : obituary notices of both have\nbeen published in Proceedings. To fill the vacancy among the elected\nmembers caused by Sir Oliver's death, the Council appointed the Rev.\nC. Drayton Thomas, who has for several years been a co-opted mem-\nber. Mr' G. N. M. Tyrrell, with whose work all our members are\nfamiliar, was co-opted to the Council in the early part of the year.\n(7) Corresponding Members and Hon. Associates. The Council\nhas elected as Corresponding Members two American psychologists\nwho have made important contributions to Psychical Research, Dr\nGardner Murphy and Dr J. B. Rhine. Miss H. Carruthers and Miss\nA 2\n\fO CO CO\n\u2014 H CO COOOHOOOiM'tO C O\nH\nc\u00a3> Is- ^ o lTj CO OOuO-^ClOliiOtNOO t- cs\n1\u20141 rH HHH pH \u2014\nkO r-l lO LO H lO CI H ifl iO O O CD iC\nr-l CO uO CM iH r-l CM OS\nCO CM H CO r-t\niH r-l i ' o \u00a9 HO ' O CM 00 CO O\ni-( iH rH\nCM CO o o lfi o OONN^tO\ncot> Oi CD tD uO o m o w n co\nCIO CO <N I>\ne+*CM r-l rH CM\n= I- -\nsi\nft, 5!\nft,\n-\n(3 O\nB5ft,sa\n\u2022\nfc> ft.\n\u00ab C ;i ? 3\noh\nO ^ oa fc* o ^\nSgcftjgS\ng o S&j 5 o\n- -\n1 58\n34 >\n3 L..\nC-J | SO\n<M 1 00\nIS\na\no o\n* 3\nk c2 -a\nS3\"\"\nl-H (- (- P\n<L>\nw 00 CU\nS S r- 3\n\u00a9 \u00a9 o\n1 - CO oo\nI\u2014\n1\nCO CO rH ifj\nCM ifl CM\ni-\nI- O CO O OS\nkO Ol O iC Gl\nOJ 01 rH\n\u2022H t- O\n<N rH -+\n00\n00\nS a =\nIohP\n\fUS o\nCO o CO\n\u2014\n1\n\u2014\no ~ 1 N\n>a\n'\n&1\neg\n, ^\n3\n5, a\ntS\nCO o\no CO\nc\n\u00a9\nO CO Tt*\nrl ^2 ^ ai\n2 o o ^ S\nf no\n3 c a\no o\nl-H\nr-i\nin o\nCO\n-\nr CS\n1\u2014\n1\no CI O O O\nz cq \/.\n(M\no o\nr-f\nr-i O\no o\n=\u00ab r-l\nb H O CO\nCO O O CO\n<M O \u00a9 O\nGl CO r-l\n\u00bb o o\n!)

After Sir Oliver Lodge's death his family kindly per-\nmitted the officers of the Society to select such of his books as they\nconsidered would be useful additions to our Library, and the Council\nwish to place on record their thanks for this valuable gift, which\nincludes some works rare in this country.\nIn addition to Members and Associates who consulted books in\nthe Library, 43 Members borrowed books, the total number of books\nlent to Members being 178. 60 books were borrowed by members\nof the public through the National Central Library for Students.\n(9) List of Recommended Literature. Members will probably often\nhave been asked by friends, who have recently developed an interest\nin our subject, to recommend them useful books to read, and also\nfor assistance in finding their way through the maze of our many\nvolumes of Proceedings and Journal. To such students the review\ncolumns of the Press, which frequently give the warmest praise to\nbooks on Psychical Research of no serious value, are worse than\nuseless as a guide. In order to meet the need of enquirers the Council\nhave collaborated with the National Book Council in the publication\nof a pamphlet, of which a new edition has recently appeared,\ngiving a list, classified in accordance with the different branches of\nour subject, of books and papers likely to be of real help both to\nbeginners and to more advanced students. The scale of the pam-\nphlet regrettably prevents reference to several useful books and\npapers, but the Council strongly advise members, especially those\nwho have recently joined, to obtain a copy (price Id.) from the\nAssistant Secretary, and to ask the Society's officers for advice,\nwhich they will gladly give, as to other literature.\n(10) Combined Index to Proceedings and Journal. There have\nbeen published in the past two volumes of a Combined Index of\nS.P.R. Proceedings and Journal, the first covering the period 1882-\n1901, and the second 1902-1913 : since then no further instalment\nhas been issued. It has long been felt that a new volume is impera-\ntively needed, and the Council have appointed a Committee to super-\nvise the preparation of a volume which, if financial and other con-\nditions permit, it is hoped to issue in 1942, the year of the Society's\nDiamond Jubilee.\n(11) Obituary. Among leading Members of the Society who have\ndied during 1940 may be mentioned (in addition to Sir Oliver Lodge\nand Mr Gatty) Sir Joseph Thomson, O.M., Miss Alice Johnson, Mr\nNathaniel Wedd and Dr Crandon : obituary notices of Sir Joseph\nThomson and Miss Johnson have been published in Proceedings.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1941\n(12) Membership of the Society. During the year 12 new Members\nwere elected, also 2 Corresponding Members and 2 Hon. Associates\nwere elected. The total loss from deaths, resignations and other\ncauses was 47 Members and 14 Associates, leaving a net decrease of\n35 Members and 10 Associates. The total membership of the\nSociety now stands at 606.\n(13) Publications. Three Parts of the Proceedings were published\nduring the year, Part 161 in May, Part 162 in June, and Part 163 in\nNovember.\nThe Secretary's sales to the general public amounted to \u00a346 5s. 9d.,\nan increase of \u00a321 on last year, and to Members of the Society,\n\u00a33 lis. 0d., and through the Society's agent in the United States,\n\u00a36 13s. lOd.\n(14) Meetings. The following Meetings have been held during\nthe year\n:\n17 Jan. The Sixth F. W. H. Myers Memorial Lecture. \" Psychical\nResearch and Theology \" by the Very Rev. W. R.\nMatthews, D.D.\n28 Feb. \" Experiments in Long-Distance Telepathy between\nLondon and Athens \" by Mr C. V. C.

Abdy Collins.\n29 May \" The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty \" by Dr J. Hettinger.\nTHE PRESIDENT ON TELEPATHY AND\nCLAIRVOYANCE IN RELATION TO PHILOSOPHY\n(In the last number for 1940 of the quarterly journal, Philosophy,\nthe President discusses a number of points concerning the import-\nance for philosophers of the evidence for paranormal faculties. 1\nFor the interest of members who do not ordinarily come across the\nphilosophical journals, we reproduce here a few extracts from his\narticle, with the kind permission of the Editor of Philosophy. It\nwill be understood that these extracts are taken out of the context\nof Professor Price's general argument and should be read as isolated\nquotations (mainly on telepathy) which do not represent his con-\nsecutive presentation of his subject. For this, the whole article\n\u2014\noriginally a paper read to the Jowett Society, Oxford\u2014should be\n1 \" Questions about Telepathy and Clairvoyance\", by Professor H. H. Price :\nPhilosophy, Vol. XV, No. 60, Oct. 1940, pp. 363-385.\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 The President on Telepathy and Clairvoyance 11\nstudied. Philosophy is available to members in the Society's\nLibrary.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nPsychical Research proper\u2014the systematic attempt to investigate\nsupernormal phenomena by scientific methods\u2014only began in\nearnest in the year 1882, when the English Society for Psychical\nResearch was founded. (It is interesting to remember that one of\nits founders was the Cambridge philosopher Henry Sidgwick.) For\nsome fifty years now the published Proceedings of the Society have\ncontained a mass of very carefully sifted evidence concerning super-\nnormal phenomena of all sorts. There are similar societies in other\ncountries.\nPor many years the devoted labours of these bodies made little\nimpression. Official science, with a few illustrious exceptions, was\nfrankly hostile ; the educated public was for the most part con-\ntemptuous ; and philosophers went on writing their books about\nmind and matter exactly as if supernormal phenomena had never\nbeen heard of. But in the last thirty years or so there has been a\ngradual change of opinion, partly because the mass of good evidence\nhas now become so great, and partly because our prejudices have\naltered, and we are now willing to believe that even the physical\nworld is a much queerer place than our grandfathers supposed.\nMost educated people are now prepared to admit the occurrence of\nsupernormal cognitive phenomena at least. At any rate they are\nprepared to admit the reality of Telepathy and Clairvoyance, and\neven to give a fair hearing to the case for Precognition. Here I\nthink that the educated public is quite right. The evidence for\nTelepathy and Clairvoyance is both abundant and good ; and the\nevidence for Precognition\u2014the most paradoxical, perhaps, of all\nsupernormal phenomena\u2014is very considerable.\nI say that the educated public is now prepared to accept these\nthings. But the philosophers, for the most part, have lagged behind.\nThey do not so much reject them as ignore them. Now this attitude\nseems to me indefensible. If Telepathy and Clairvoyance do occur\n\u2014\nand I see no way of denying it\u2014then surely they must be extremely\nimportant. For it will follow that the human mind has powers\nentirely different from sense-perception, introspection, memory, and\ninference. If Precognition occurs, we shall probably have to revise\nour theories of Time and Causation in the most drastic manner.\nEven Haunting raises some pretty problems for the student of\nPerception. I am afraid there is some truth in the taunt of Professor\nvon Mises. Philosophers, he says, are always on the side of the big\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1941\nbattalions ;\nthey erect the scientific conclusions of the last genera-\ntion into a priori truths.\nSo far I have been trying to convince you that philosophers ought\nto take an interest in Psychical Research, and that if they do not\nthey are not doing their job. But exhortation is uphill work, and\nmay even bring a good cause into odium. It is better to show by\nexamples that Psychical Research does raise philosophical problems :\nproblems, moreover, which are so curious and so interesting that,\nonce we see what they are, we shall want to discuss them, whether\nwe feel it is our duty or not.\nIn spontaneous cases, which first drew attention to the pheno-\nmenon [of telepathy], the agent is usually undergoing some crisis or\nother ; for example, \"he is involved in an accident of some kind, such\nas a shipwreck or a railway accident, or he is seriously ill, or at the\npoint of death. He usually, but not always, has some emotional\nlinkage with the percipient ; for example, he is a near relative or\nan intimate friend. The percipient's experience varies extremely.\nSometimes it is no more than the emergence of an unaccountable\nconviction about the present situation of the agent, accompanied\nby a feeling of distress or anxiety. Sometimes the experience takes\nthe form of a vivid and detailed visual hallucination\u2014the seeing of\na \" telepathic phantasm \" or \" apparition \". In the best cases the\nhallucination is found to correspond in detail with the agent's\nsituation at the time. Sometimes, again, there is no hallucination,\nbut there is a vivid \" sense of presence \". The percipient \" feels \",\nand feels intensely, that the agent is there in the room, though he\nsees nothing. At other times the hallucination is auditory, or, again,\nit may be both visual and auditory. In one interesting case, the\npercipient wakes up in the morning and has a visual hallucination\nof a half-sheet of notepaper lying on the pillow ; the paper contains\nthe written words \" Elsie was dying last night \". The one person\nwhom the percipient knew with that name did in fact die on the\nnight in question. Sometimes, again, the \" message \" is conveyed\nin the form of a vivid and detailed dream. In view of these great\nvariations, it is natural to suppose that the original telepathic\n\" impact \"\u2014whatever its nature may be\u2014is always received uncon-\nsciously, and that the precise form in which it reaches consciousness\ndepends upon the permanent idiosyncrasy or temporary state of the\npercipient. Sometimes, perhaps, the impact, or rather the effect of\nit upon the percipient's unconscious, is \" repressed \" during waking\nhours, and only emerges in sleep, in the form of a dream-image.\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 The President on Telepathy and Clairvoyance 13\nBut we are not confined to the evidence of spontaneous cases,\nnumerous and striking though these are. Telepathy has also been\ninvestigated experimentally.\n[A noteworthy result of card experiments]\u2014a result which one\nwould never have anticipated from a study of the spontaneous cases\n\u2014is that very frequently there appears to be nothing cognitive about\nthe phenomenon at all, in any ordinary sense of the word \" cog-\nnitive \" ; it seems to be purely motor. The percipient just calls out\nthe suit of the card, and in a long series of trials he gives the right\nanswer in a proportion of cases which exceeds the chance expecta-\ntion. He does not see or feel anything in particular. He just utters\nwords, and in such and such a proportion of cases they are found\nto be the right ones.\nIf Telepathy is not a form of knowing, but rather an experience\nwhich is caused by and more or less closely corresponds with an\nexperience of someone else, how are we to conceive the causal\nprocess involved? As we have seen, it seems to be of a purely\nmental sort. Now I think this has an important philosophical\nconsequence. The plain man, and even the plain philosopher,\nassumes with Descartes that the world of minds is divided up into\na number of separate and as it were isolated mental substances.\nNo mind, it is supposed, has direct causal relations with any other\nmind, nor indeed with anything at all except its own brain. But\nit now appears that this view is true only of the conscious part of\nour mental life. When we consider unconscious mental processes\n\u2014\nthose which their owner is not, or perhaps cannot be, aware of by\nintrospection\u2014there seems to be no such isolation. It appears that\nmy unconscious may on occasion stand in direct causal relations\nwith yours. The facts of Dual and Alternating Personality have\nalready made us doubt whether the unity of any one mind is quite\nso absolute and unconditional as our predecessors supposed ; it now\nappears that the diversity of different minds is not absolute and\nunconditional either. It begins to look as if both the unity and the\nisolatedness of a single mind were the result of certain special re-\nstrictive conditions, which are generally but not always fulfilled ;\nor perhaps not even that, but rather a mere appearance arising from\nthe extremely limited and superficial character of ordinary self-\nconsciousness. The hypothesis of a \" Collective Unconscious \",\ncommon to all human minds, which certain speculative writers have\nsuggested, begins to look more plausible. Let us consider for a\nmoment what this hypothesis would amount to. What sort of unity\nwould this Collective Unconscious have, if it existed? So far as I\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jah.-Feb. 1941\ncan see, its unity would be purely causal. The causal relations\nbetween Smith's mind and Brown's would be the same in kind as\nthe causal relations within either of them, and equally direct. The\nCollective Unconscious would not be a \" thing \", but rather a \" field\n\"\nof (purely mental) interaction. In fact, the phrase \" Collective\nUnconscious \" would just be a way of saying that unconscious\nevents in one mind can directly produce unconscious events in any\nother ; from which it would follow that the distinction between\nunconscious mental events \" in me \" and unconscious mental events\n\" in you \" is no longer a hard-and-fast one. Now this hypothesis\nmay seem altogether too speculative, and it would certainly need a\ngood deal of clarification before we could accept it ;\nnevertheless,\nthe existence of Telepathy does suggest that some hypothesis on\nthese lines is true, or at any rate nearer the truth than the common-\nsense view, which regards the mental world as a mere collection of\ncausally isolated mental substances.\nTHE PHYSICS AND PHYSIOLOGY OF FIELD DOWSING\nA Statement by Mr J. C. Maby\nA belated review by \" C. C. L. G.\" of The Physics of the Divining\nRod, by T. B. Franklin, M.A., F.R.S.E., and the present writer, has\nat length appeared in the S.P.R. Journal (No. 569-70). This review\nnot only entirely fails to describe the wide scope, thorough nature\nand fundamental implications of a monograph on a subject of\nunquestionable importance to students of Psychical Research\u2014especi-\nally on the physical side ; but it is also inexact and misleading in its\nvery meagre statements and inferences. I trust, therefore, that the\npresent article, by way of rejoinder and fulfilment, may be acceptable\nto those members of this society who are genuinely interested in\ndowsing science and what Continental writers term radiesthesia.\nFor many physical phenomena of an apparently supernormal kind\nwould appear to be at least related to dowsing type phenomena, and\nnot only clairvoyance and some forms of psychometry but even the\nsimpler forms of telepathy are probably involved in some degree.\nNo one should resent fair criticism, if constructive, but an author\nmay properly protest against mis-statements, innuendoes and insinu-\nations, especially when he has devoted many years of very laborious\nand costly research on approved scientific lines to an intricate subject,\nas Mr Franklin and I have done with Dowsing\u2014the more parti-\ncularly when a critic is not, apparently, in a position of authority\nwith respect to the subject in hand. Moreover, in this case, our\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 The Physics and Physiology of Field Dowsing 15\nposition is the stronger in that only two other reviewers (which have\nincluded physicists and engineers) have thought fit to adopt a like\nantagonistic attitude ;\nand they were, in fact, notoriously ignorant\nof the subject on which they had the temerity to write prejudicially\nand also inexactly. Many others, however, even where they have\nexpressed certain reservations or pointed to some omission from\nour published work, have been in agreement in welcoming very\nwarmly what is (despite a wide previous literature on Dowsing of a\nsemi- or pseudo-scientific kind) virtually a pioneer work ; and our\nthoroughness in attacking an exceptionally wide and complex\nproblem has also been appreciated. Whereas, finally, we have the\nexpress approval of most of the best known and most expert dowsers\nand their investigators, at home and abroad, regarding both our\nmain observations and interpretations.\nHad we been able to confirm the psychological hypothesis, as set\nforth by Barrett, Besterman, Osty and others, including myself at an\nearlier stage of our enquiry,1\nwe might, no doubt, have looked for a\nwarmer reception by the S.P.R. (typified by \" C. C. L. G.\"). But\nwhat we actually found as a result of several years of continuous in-\nvestigation in field and laboratory, aided by many of the best British\ndowsers and amateur dowsers, radio engineers, electro-medical\nmen and members of the British and French societies for dowsing\nand radiesthesia, was quite the reverse. In short, we found that,\ndespite the undeniable interference or, alternatively, assistance of\nwhat are now commonly known as autosuggestion, telepathy, clair-\nvoyance and psychometry in the case of one class of more \"\npsychic\n\"\ndiviners, the ordinary \"straight\" field dowser {e.g., the average\ncountry water diviner) was either very rarely or not at all influenced\nin such psychological ways. In other words, ordinary dowsing\nappears to us unquestionably and demonstrably to be a special\nphysiological faculty which is susceptible of a purely physical\nexplanation on classical scientific lines. And to provide such an\nexplanation, once having discovered the essential clues, was the main\ntask which we set ourselves in our book, and that in a relatively\ncomplete and detailed manner.\nThe Continental term radiesthesia, applied to ordinary dowsing,\nis, therefore, seen to be essentially valid after all ; while the perpetual\ncontentions betwixt the physical and psychical schools of thought\nare immediately referable to the two alternative forms of divining\n(with the first of which our book primarily deals), namely, physio-\nlogical dowsing (radiesthetic) and psychological divination (extra-\n1\nVide \" The Psychical Element in Dowsing \", B.S.D. Journ, II. 9 (1935) and\nother papers and lectures by the present writer.\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1941\nsensorial). But of these it does not take long to ascertain that the\nformer is both the more usual and the more reliable ;\nthough, in\nimaginative and suggestible people it may, if they are not very\ncautious and self-critical, provide a point of initial departure towards\nthe latter : much as a Kilner dicyanine screen may, in some cases,\naid the development of true clairvoyance, or a crystal ball, a bowl of\nwater, a bed of sand and so forth, by encouraging the imagination\nand inducing an auto-hypnotic, trance-like state.\nThe psychological aspects of divining we have gladly referred\nback to Psychical Research, along with psychometry and the rest.\nBut it is unreasonable, to say the least of it, for parapsychologists to\nresent the fact that we happen to have struck the final blows upon\na wedge of scientific observation that has at length cleft asunder the\ntwo components of the subject. For what we have, with the in-\nvaluable help of many past investigators and present exponents of\ndowsing, managed to do is, surely, a most charitable act towards\nPsychical Research ; since this work has, if those interested will be\ngood enough to read our book with patience and impartiality,\neffectively cleared the field of what was heretofore an impenetrable\nentanglement. Henceforward, however, it should be possible to say\nwith some certainty which are the sheep and which the goats. And\nwe have, happily, been able to adapt or devise several types of\nelectromagnetic automatic recording instruments on the one hand,\nand suitable myometers or \" tonometers \" on the other (replacing\nor complementing the traditional forked rod, pendulum, etc.), in\norder to delineate and estimate the relative strengths of the dowser's\nfields of force and zones of radiation. And all these several methods\nhave very nicely interlocked with, and checked up against, one\nanother. In short, granted suitable conditions and experimental\nskill, the automatic physical instruments were found to give almost\nperfect correlation, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the defini-\ntive reactions of the most reliable physiological dowsers, so that we\ncan now propose the new name Radiographic Prospection in place\nof Dowsing for those who understand their business and who find\nthat the public or their employers shy at the traditional hocus-pocus\nimplicated in the terms Dowsing and Divining, much as scientists\ntend to take fright at the term Spiritualism while condoning Para-\npsychology or Psychical Research.\nThe general public and prospective clients have always main-\ntained a fairly firm, if sometimes wavering, faith in the ordinary\ncountry dowser and his modern, more scientific and better educated\ncounterpart ;\nalthough they (rightly, I believe) tend to mistrust the\n\" psychic \" diviner, who, however sincere and enthusiastic, is prone\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 The Physics mid Physiology of Field Dowsing 17\nto crankiness, if not indeed charlatanism, and who is a very uncertain\nquantity. For, whereas the former bases his craft on certain neuro-\nmuscular reactions and secondary sensations of a concrete, however\ndelicate, sort, the latter is a moody fellow, who has runs of \" luck\n\"\nonly when the spirit so moves him\u2014like our mediums and auto-\nmatists. His percentage successes, therefore, may, if he is a good\ndiviner, average around 30%, say ;\nthough they will often fall to\nchance-guesswork level when he is upset or out of sorts, but rise to\nconsiderable heights on occasion when his e.s.p. faculty is at its best.\nHe is also naturally affected by the positive ideas of bystanders or\ninterested employers (by what I have called telepathic suggestion)\nin what may or may not be a helpful sense, and by the mental jar-\nring of discordant or antagonistic minds ; whereas the \" straight\n\"\nphysiological dowser is unaffected in this way, unless, indeed, some\nbystander happens to emit powerful emotional (short-wave) radia-\ntion in the Cazzamalli \" psycho-radiant reflex \" sense\u2014which I have\nfound to cause very definite dowsing reactions in suitably sensitive\nsubjects at relatively close quarters. And this occurs, presumably\n(fuller investigations to follow) in an ordinary physiological dowsing\nsense, in accordance with our own physical theory and Cazzamalli's\nshnple \" telepathic \" experiments ; though it may have nothing\nwhatever to do with detailed \" psychic \" telepathy of the kind which\nconcerns parapsychologists.\nBut the proof of a pudding is in its eating. I am, therefore,\npleased to be in a position to state without fear of contradiction\n(clients' affidavits in hand) that since our physical theory of dowsing\nand the resultant field technique were worked out, following upon\nour long investigation of dowsers and dowsing, there have been only\nthree partial failures out of thirty radiographic prospections for\nwater and minerals, using only the forked rod (modern form) and\nsuitable reaction meters, either as to exact location, depth below\nground or relative magnitude (or yield) ; and those failures can now\nbe traced to purely physical complications, such as lateral re-\nfraction of the radiation by inclined rock strata, for instance. And\nthis takes no account of my colleague's long list of remarkable and\ndetailed successes with his special Hertzian receiver, the data from\nwhich he is now in a position to check by means of the rod and our new\ndow'sing technique to quick advantage. . . . Our published observa-\ntions and conclusions cannot, therefore, be far wide of the mark.\nThe War Office, Air Ministry and Admiralty in this country,\nfollowing the earlier lead of the French and German governments\nsome years ago, are, moreover, now showing a very real interest in\nthis type of work ; and several of the best modern dowsers have done\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan. -Feb. 1941\ngood service in connection with war problems and public works\nduring the past year. One may hope, therefore, that scientific dows-\ning has at last reached its adolescent stage, comparable with that of\nwireless in the early days of Lodge, Branly and Marconi. Nor is\nthere any serious objection to the supposition that dowsing may, in\ntime, rival wireless telegraphy and telephony in value and utility\nin many different fields, once the initial difficulties and scientific\ninertia are transcended.\nIn our book, in addition to the presentation of a general thesis\non radiographic prospection and the vindication of physiological\ndowsing as practised by the most reliable and sensible exponents of\nan ancient and firmly established craft, we have devoted passages or\nsections to other aspects of the subject, which we have endeavoured\nto correlate to the central facts and physical theory. For instance,\nthere is a concise history of the subject from early days up to the\ntime of our own investigations, with special reference to physical\nand scientific enquiries, followed by a moderately full discussion of\nthe work and ideas of the Mesmer, Reichenbach, Boirac, Abrams,\nWigelsworth, Boyd, Richards, Regnault and Eeman schools of\nelectro-medical thought (to mention a few outstanding names), with\nregard to theories of rays, emanations, \" animal magnetism \", etc.,\nand their evident connection with neuro-muscular responses of the\ndowsing category. Whereas, in later chapters, the biological effects\nof short-wave Hertzian radiation and corpuscular electronic emana-\ntions, X-rays, gamma rays, ultra-violet rays, the effects of radio-\nactive deposits and the probable role of cosmic radiation, etc., are\ndiscussed together with fresh experimental evidence of those effects\non plants, animals and sensitive human beings such as dowsers and\nweather sensitives. And the apparent connection between the solar\nand lunar electromagnetic cycles and mean dowsing ray intensity,\non the one hand, and organic growth, vitality and certain functional\ndisorders such as rheumatism, arthritis, cancer and asthma, on the\nother hand,' is emphasised.\nDespite the insinuations of our present reviewer (which I shall\nnext proceed to dispose of), we can, I am confident, fairly claim\nscrupulously and consistently to have adhered to classical scientific\nmethods of experiment and analysis throughout this long and diver-\nsified investigation ; and such omissions or occasional lack of fine\ndetail in the presentation of the published work is due solely to lack\nof sufficient space and funds to allow of expansion of a monograph\nthat is, it seems, already over protracted and technically detailed for\nthe average reader. That fact we must regret, though it cannot be\nhelped.\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 The Physics and Physiology of Field Dowsing 19\nFinally, here are my answers to \" C. C. L. G.'s \" subversive innuen-\ndoes, which I must encounter for the sake of modern dowsing, even\nthough they would appear to be scarcely worth the powder and shot.\n(1)\n\" Astonishing \" discoveries are usually made with the aid of\nsimple instruments backed by careful observation and logical\nreasoning. And anyone who doubts this is simply ignorant of the\nhistory of Science. Criticism of our work on that score is, therefore,\nof no real account, unless we were shown to be either scientifically\nincompetent (a point that has never been raised against either Mr\nFranklin or myself in the course of many years of experiment,\nauthorship, lecturing, etc.) or else uncommonly ingenious liars.\n(2) With regard to the graphs in our book, be it noted that only\ntwo out of twenty-eight, and those two are not true graphs, lack the\nnumerical scales about which our reviewer complains that only \" a\nfew show scales of numbers at the bottom and at the left-hand edge\".\nHis statement is, therefore, demonstrably untrue: And for the rest,\nnote that although it is true that the ordinate numbers were omitted\nfrom eight of the graphs, that was done for sake of clarity in printing\nsmall figures, as these had more than one curve (in order to demon-\nstrate correlations), and the scales of values for the different curves\nwere not similar. Whereas actual values for the same kinds of data\nwere given elsewhere. Again, it is also true that eight more graphs\nhad ordinate scales of \" arbitrary units \" ; the reason being simply\nthat absolute or standard units were in no way essential to the tests\nor arguments, as will be apparent to anyone seriously interested in\nthe problem. Moreover, as most of these graphs represented\naveraged results of many hundreds of readings or were sometimes\nslightly smoothed for diagrammatic clarity, ordinate values such as\nmillivolts, gausses, dynes, etc., would not possess a proper meaning.\nAnd, finally, it is quite common in the best scientific journals to\nstate \" arbitrary units \" or even omit a numerical scale altogether\nin some instances.\n(3) As a corollary to the foregoing, I may say that it is not at all\nnecessary in this class of investigation, where relative field strengths,\netc., are what matter, to calibrate all measuring instruments in\nabsolute or standard units. That would waste much valuable time,\ncost much money and prove nothing in addition, unless, of course,\nreadings at one place or time are to be compared with those taken at\nanother place or time ; in which case we were always careful to\nstandardise and calibrate as need be.\n(4)\n\" Vagueness \" or \" insufficiently detailed descriptions \" have\nalso been cited by one other sceptical reviewer, and cannot, perhaps,\nbe entirely denied in certain passages ;\nalthough most readers put\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1941\nthe shoe on the other foot, and complained of excessive detail and\ntechnicality! And this only goes to show how impossible it is to\nplease all parties in a work of this class where (a) space and money\nare limited, and (6) readers of such diverse mentality as engineers,\nphysicists, doctors, biologists and psychologists, not to mention un-\nscientific dowsers and lay readers, must all be catered for at the same\ntime. So we were compelled to compromise. But this was explained\nin the book {vide pp. 4-5), and an offer plainly made to provide any\ninterested experimenter with the requisite detailed data or descrip-\ntions. Moreover, many competent persons have shared in or\nwitnessed most of our observations and tests, and any further appli-\ncant is welcome to do so, should he fail to repeat such effects for\nhimself. This objection, therefore, likewise falls to the ground.\n(5) As for our not having previously published these (partly\nnovel) results in detailed form in scientific journals, other than those\nespecially devoted to dowsing and radiesthesia\u2014in which one might\nsuppose such a specialised subject could best be ventilated\u2014surely\nthe same thing is true of many previous researches, often of the\ngreatest merit and importance, including some printed in the S.P.R.\nProceedings, for instance\u2014a periodical that many \" orthodox\n\"\nscientists have and still do regard with suspicion or contempt. That\nfact, however, in no way invalidates such researches. Moreover,\nthere were two other cogent reasons for the plan we adopted {vide,\nfor one, p. 4 of our book) ;\nnamely, that we wished first to be able\nto present a single tolerably coherent picture of the whole business\nall at once, including an appeal to the general reading public ;\nand,\nsecond, that no ordinary society or scientific journal would, hereto-\nfore, accept papers on so \" superstitious \" or \" mystical \" a subject\nas dowsing is \" orthodoxically \" held to be. Directly our book\nappeared, however, papers and lectures were requested by several\nscientific societies, including the Royal Society of Arts {vide R.S.A.\nJourn. for Apr. 19th, 1940; also Psychic Science, XIX, 3). And,\nbut for the war, the subject is now progressing very satisfactorily.\n(6) We are, of course, fully aware that more than one road leads\nto Rome. And to speak of our \" astonishing disregard for all other\npossible explanations of the variations of the readings of (our)\ninstruments, upon which these claims are supposedly based \", is,\nfrankly speaking, sheer rubbish and scientific libel. For instance,\nour instruments were so designed and\/or applied to each special\nproblem as to give answers \" Yes \" or \" No \" to specific questions,\nthus :\n\" Can a zoned or undulatory (standing wave) field of Hertzian\nradiation, exactly corresponding in both form and relative intensity\nto that defined by a skilled dowser's reactions (acting first, without\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 The Physics and Physiology of Field Dowsing 21\nhis or our foreknowledge of what we expect in advance) in the\nneighbourhood of a subterranean water vein, for instance, be\nrecorded clearly by such and such a radio receiver, operating at such\nand such a frequency ?\n\" And we found that the answer to this and\nmany similar questions was undoubtedly in the affirmative. Hence,\nthe only speculative element in our work has been not with regard\nto the physical or physiological facts {e.g., the objectivity of such\nelectromagnetic patterned fields and the dowser's reactions thereto,\nwhich we carefully guarded against possible autosuggestion, tele-\npathic transfer or normal sensory indicia), but with regard to the\nultimate explanation of some of those facts {e.g., the initial energising\nfactor, whether of cosmical, solar, geomagnetic or artificial origin,\nor the predisposing physiological cause in dowsing sensitivity). Nor\nhave we been dogmatic on such points, although we felt justified in\nmaking temporary hypothetical deductions from the sum total of\nthe evidence available, which is very considerable.\n(7) If our critic were better versed than he appears to be in the\nsubjects of dowsing and radiology, he would not, I think, venture\nupon his concluding witticism about a dowser's muscles getting\n\" jammed by all the short-wave radio now being broadcast \". For\nthe fact is, apparently, that such artificially generated energy\nshould, and does, contribute to the resultant Hertzian fields (that\nconcern the dowser) surrounding oscillating conductors, and hence\ncontributes also (though without call for precise electronic syntonisa-\ntion) to the dowser's neuro-muscular response in those fields. But,\nowing to the fact that short-wave broadcasts projected horizontally\nalong the Earth's surface are not appreciably penetrative in a vertical\ndirection, as contrasted to the downcoming vertical ( ? cosmic or\nionospheric) radiation that we have been led to postulate (and for the\nexistence of which there is other \" classical \" evidence outside our\nown work), such artificial sources are not likely to energise sub-\nterranean conductors to any extent. If, however, short-wave\noscillators of an artificial kind or certain other forms of electro-\nmagnetic machinery are near at hand, the natural dowsing fields\nwill be confused thereby, as my colleague has shown by tests before\na critical scientific meeting and also at the B.B.C. television station\nin London. And much else might be said on this head that would,\nhowever, be too lengthy and out of place here.\nMay I, therefore, conclude this brief description of our work on\ndowsing, which was undertaken under the aegis of the British\nSociety of Dowsers, and my answer to \" C. C. L. G.'s \" criticisms of\nour book by asking those who are genuinely interested in this un-\ncommonly fruitful and interesting subject to be so good as to read\n\f22 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan. -Feb. 1941\nthe book itself. Or, alternatively, Mr Franklin, I, or Col. A. H. Bell,\nPresident of the B.S.D., would, I am sure, be very glad to answer\nany enquiries direct or to arrange for suitable demonstrations of the\nphenomena in question, which are perfectly objective and repeat-\nable to order, and hence \" scientific \".\nJ. Cecil Maby, B.Sc, A.R.C.S., F.R.A.S.,\nMember of the British Society of Dowsers\nInvestigation Committee.\n(Some delay in reviewing the book was due to the death of Mr\nOliver Gatty, who, as an investigator well versed in physics, had it\nunder consideration at the time when his activities were abruptly\nended. There is no substance in Mr Maby's suggestion that the\nSociety desires to discount normal scientific explanations of pheno-\nmena, and, indeed, Mr Maby has himself more than once criticised\nthe Society in the opposite sense.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nCORRESPONDENCE\nParanormal Cognition of Drawings\nSir,\u2014I am staggered by Mr Carington's letter in the November-\nDecember Journal, and as much by its tone as its contents. My\nquery related to Mr Carington's report, not to his investigation, for\nI hoped that the omission to which I pointed was in his recording\nand not in his experimental technique. It now appears that the\nlatter explanation is the true one and moreover that Mr Carington\ndefends his procedure. What are we to make of this and of Mr\nCarington's tone? \" I did not regard . . . and do not propose \"\u2014\ndoes the Perrott Student (whom I congratulate most sincerely)\nreally intend off his own bat to make such fundamental changes in\npsychical research methods? Mr Carington's few lines in fact con-\ntain some revolutionary propositions. He has conducted an experi-\nment based on the display of given drawings at given times ; the\nwhole thing rests on the statement that the specified drawing was\nin fact displayed on the specified occasion ; and I have asked for\nevidence of this. It is certainly a radical innovation to resent such\nan inquiry, and I am afraid that Mr Carington is being ingenuous\nin calling my request \" ingenious '\",\nfor nothing could be more\nelementary ; and I fear that he is something more than ingenuous\nin his deplorable and quite irrelevant reference to the veracity of\nhis wife and himself. Mr Carington knows better than that. He\nknows, for instance, that control is required to guard against error\nas much as against fraud ; he also knows that it is improper to\n\fJan.-Feb. 1941 Correspondence 23\nclaim exceptions and immunities for oneself. Mr Carington's last\nsentence contains the most remarkable proposition of all : that an\ninvestigator's ipse dixit should be accepted failing \" positive ante-\ncedent evidence of charlatanry \" on his part. Shades of Sidgwick\nand Hodgson\u2014shades, indeed, of pretty well everybody! Nobody\nwants to have the canons of scientific methodology rehearsed again\nat this date, and I will merely state once more, as one of the funda-\nmental bases of scientific procedure, the rule that every non-\nrepeatable experiment must be carried out under conditions which\nare proof against error (including fraud, which in the last analysis\nis a form of error). This rule has been defended by the S.P.R.\nagainst all comers, and I am sure that Mr Carington does not dispute\nit. Why, then, the aggrieved tone of his letter, and why did he\nfail to take the very obvious precaution in question\u2014for he cer-\ntainly does not expect us to take seriously his suggestion that no\nreliable witness Avas available in Cambridge?\nYours, etc., Theodore Besterman.\n(Unless the evidence of a wife is to be wholly ruled out of court\nin experimental research, as in criminal law, the question at issue\nseems to be whether it was desirable to have an expert witness in\nthis case.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nSir,\u2014The recent letters of Mr Besterman and Mr Whately Caring-\nton to the Journal (Vol. XXXI, pp. 136, 209) raise questions of\nconsiderable interest.\nSo far as the case under discussion is concerned I have no doubt\nthat Mr Carington acted very wisely in confining all knowledge of\nthe original drawings to himself and his wife. Nor would anyone\nwho knows Mr Carington suggest for a moment that the facts of\nhis experiments are otherwise than he has reported them.\nBut at the present stage of Psychical Research it seems to me\nthat experimenters should take every precaution to safeguard them-\nselves against any possible accusation that their work contains loop-\nholes through which the data could have been deliberately falsified.\nIt is of course possible for an experimenter to take a long-range\nview and argue as follows : \"I have conducted such and such\nexperiments and obtained results which I have described. I have\nin my report given a clear and adequate account of the precautions\ntaken to prevent normal leakage. If people suggest that I could\nhave faked the data I am not interested since, if the results are\ngenuine, as I believe them to be, they will sooner or later be verified\nby other experimenters and their truth be universally established.\"\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1941\nNow while this is a perfectly tenable position, and one which may\nbe justified by posterity, I do not think that its adoption is likely\nto be in the best interests of present-day Psychical Research. For,\nat present, experience shows that we are not able to guarantee that\nresults obtained by one experimenter will be confirmed by others\neven when the same subject is employed, and this may probably be\nthe case for many decades to come.\nUnless there is adequate control of the individual experimenter\nit seems to me that there is nothing to prevent a host of intelligent\nbut unscrupulous persons who desire kudos for themselves from\nconducting faked investigations which claim to confirm, say, the\nlow-scoring observations of Murphy and McTave. This might result\nin a deplorable state of chaos which would set back the clock of\nPsychical Research for generations. It is to be hoped therefore that\nall experimenters who obtain positive results will invite other\nresponsible investigators to witness their experiments and to super-\nvise every detail of their technique. Such collaboration does not\nof course obviate the possibility of collusion of a fraudulent kind\nbetween investigators, but it does minimise the opportunities for\nfraud on the part of an individual experimenter. But it avails\nnothing to have witnesses unless such witnesses are sufficiently\ntrained to detect loopholes both for fraud and for ordinary sources\nof error.\nYours, etc., S. G.

Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E.,\nin the Chair.\nThe following Members were present : Mr Staveley Bulford, Miss\nL. M. Corry, Mrs Oliver Gatty, Mrs A. P. Goldney, Sir Robert\nGower, Mr C. V. C. Herbert, Miss I. Jephson, Sir Lawrence Jones,\nBart., Mrs K. Richmond, Mr W. H. Salter and Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell\n;\nalso Mr Kenneth Richmond (Hon. Associate).\nThe Hon. Secretary read the Notice convening the Meeting.\nAs the Hon. Treasurer was absent on active service and the\nDeputy Hon. Treasurer unable to be present, the Hon. Secretary\npresented the accounts, together with the Report. He said that\nthe loss of the tenancy of the upper part of the building was a\nserious matter for the Society, and there was at present little\nprospect of getting another tenant. He did not however think that\nthis would seriously hamper the work of the Society, as the Research\nEndowment Fund now bore few expenses. The acting Treasurer,\nMr Saltmarsh, had conferred with the trustees of the Research\nEndowment Fund, and also with the trustees of the Myers Me-\nmorial Fund, and it had been agreed that to some extent these two\nFunds should as a temporary measure help out the General Fund,\nin case serious difficulties arose, which so far had not been the case.\nAlthough we had got to go rather cautiously, he did not think we\nneed for financial reasons curtail our programme either of meetings,\npublication, or of research.\nB\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MARCH 1941\nThere seemed to be a great decline in interest in spontaneous\ncases\u2014he himself had received very few since the outbreak of War,\nand there had been a decline even before the War. Again, there\nwas undoubtedly a very considerable dearth of mediums worth\ninvestigation, and if any members heard of promising results with\nmediums he hoped they would report them to the officials of the\nSociety. We could then, even under war conditions, carry out\ninvestigation, if there were any suitable material.\nAs to meetings, there had been quite a good programme up to the\nsummer holidays last year, but owing to the Blitzkrieg in the\nautumn, meetings had then been suspended. Efforts were being\nmade to arrange some meetings this year. It had occurred to him\nthat members living outside London, in places like Oxford and\nCambridge, and some other towns as well might be able to organise\nmeetings in those towns.\nA discussion followed, in which several Members took part, when\nsuggestions were made as to possible lines of research, and of papers\nfor meetings.\nMr Salter moved the adoption of the Balance Sheet and the\nAnnual Report. This resolution was seconded by Sir Robert Gower,\nand carried unanimously.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for\nelection to membership of the Council, other than the six members\nwho retired by rotation and sought re-election. The following six\nmembers were accordingly unanimously elected : Professor C. D.\nBroad, Mr W. Whately Carington, Professor E. R. Dodds, Miss Ina\nJephson, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton, G.B.E.. and Dr Maurice B.\nWright.\nMessrs Miall, Savage, Avery & Co. were re-elected Auditors for\nthe forthcoming year.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL\nThe 381st Meeting of the Council was held at 31 Tavistock Square,\nLondon, W.C. 1, on Wednesday, 26 February 1941, immediately\nafter the Annual General Meeting, the Hon. Mrs Alfred Lyttelton\nG.B.E., in the Chair. There were also present : Sir Robert Gower,\nMiss I. Jephson, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Mr W. H. Salter and\nMr G. N. M. Tyrrell ; also Mr Kenneth Richmond, Editor of the\nJournal, Mr C. V. C. Herbert, Research Officer, and Miss E.

Thomas of Detroit, Michigan, on 21\nNovember, 1940, from the result of an auto collision not far from\nthe Orchard Lake cottage which figured in his books, brought to a\nclose the career of one of the foremost figures in American psychical\nresearch.\nDr Thomas was born in Parker City, Pennsylvania, in 1874. He\nstudied at the University of Michigan where he received the degree\nof Bachelor of Laws in 1898. Subsequently he studied psychology\nand education at the University of Chicago, Columbia, Harvard,\nand at Duke University. He received the degree of Master of Arts\nin 1915. In 1933, after working for several years on a psychical\nresearch project at Duke, he was given the degree of Doctor of\nPhilosophy.\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MARCH 1941\nThis is probably the first doctorate awarded in the United States\nfor a study in this field. His thesis, An Evaluative Study of the\nMental Content of Certain Trance Phenomena, was a meticulous\nexamination into the paranormal content of statements of trance\nmediums. Proxy sittings were used as a method of approach and\ndevious means were employed to guard the identity of the investi-\ngator and to exclude normal knowledge. Several new methods of\nevaluation and treatment were developed by Dr Thomas in the\nstudy of his data. Two less formidable volumes by Dr Thomas\nwere published by the Boston Society for Psychic Research. The\nfirst, published in 1929, was entitled Case Studies Dealing With\nSurvival. It contained some of the crucial material brought to light\nin 214 sittings with 17 mediums, 16 of them in England. Most of\nthe material centred around the personality of Dr Thomas's deceased\nwife, E. L. T. A second volume, Beyond Normal Cognition, published\nin 1937, contains further proxy material, much of it received through\nMrs Leonard, together with an exposition of Dr Thomas's method of\nevaluation. Both volumes contain excellent cross-correspondences\nand intriguing evidence bearing on survival. A third study of trance\nmediumship was in preparation at the time of his death but was not\nready for publication.\nDr Thomas was working for his doctor's degree at Duke University\nat the time of the first beginnings of the investigation there into\njjarapsychology, under the direction of Professor William McDougall.\nDr J. B. Rhine and Dr Louisa E. Rhine collaborated with him in\nproducing his Case Studies. Professor William McDougall wrote the\nforeword to Beyond Normal Cognition. Dr Thomas was a member\nof the S.P.R. for many years and a member of the Boston S.P.R.\nfrom its beginnings. His interest in the field went back before 1900,\nbut his interest was casual until after a sitting with Mrs M. M. Soule\nof Boston in 1926. Shortly thereafter he decided to undertake a\ncautious and thorough investigation of the trance mediumship field.\nLike William James, he described the research as \" dredging in a\ndirty sea \" ; but he found that enough of value was brought up to\njustify continued dredging.\nOne of Dr Thomas's hopes, which he did not live to see realized,\nwas to see a union re-established between scientific psychical re-\nsearch organizations in America and England. Terminating after\nthe death of Richard Hodgson in complete separation, Dr Thomas\nbelieved that the research in these countries would benefit greatly\nby a strong unified organization of research groups in both.\nAside from his work in psychical research and psychology, Dr\nThomas had a distinguished career in the field of Michigan education.\n\fMAECH 1941 Experiments in Telepathy 29\nTo those who knew him personally, Dr Thomas was an efficient\nand indefatigable worker, but one so self-effacing and quiet that\nhe never received the publicity which should have been his due. He\nwas a keen psychologist, possessed of extraordinary insight and\nshrewd judgement. His dry sense of humour, and his kindly sympa-\nthetic helpfulness, endeared him to his friends. His careful sug-\ngestions were valued and appreciated by those who worked with\nhim in psychical and educational fields. I feel fortunate to have\nknown him and to have worked with him, to whatever small extent.\nEdmond P. Gibson\nEXPERIMENTS IN TELEPATHY WITH DR. GILBERT\nMURRAY\nBy H. de G. Salter\nThis is an account of some experiments in telepathy which were\nmade in May, 1931, when my husband and I were the guests of\nDr Gilbert and Lady Mary Murray at their house, Yatscombe,\nBoar's Hill, Oxford. It is taken from a lecture I delivered in the\nSociety's rooms on the 16th November, 1938. The account follows\nverbatim the contemporary notes made by Lady Mary Murray and\nmy husband, except that in two cases initials are substituted for\nnames, and that I have added, in square brackets, some notes to\nexplain allusions to persons and things mentioned. I have also given\nconsecutive serial numbers to the experiments for convenience of\nreference.\nThe experiments took place on the evenings of the 23rd and 24th\nMay, and the conditions under which they were made are described\nin notes made by myself and my husband later in the evening of\nthe 23rd. On the morning of the 25th May my husband and I made\ncertain experiments between ourselves to test the possibility of\nauditory hyperaesthesia, which has been suggested as an explana-\ntion of the results of earlier experiments with Dr Murray : see\nProc, Vols. XXIX and XXXIV. His contemporary notes of the\ntests made on the 25th May are printed at the end of the records\nof the experiments of the two previous evenings.\nMy note of the 23rd May is as follows :\nThe experiments took place in the drawing-room of Mr\nMurray's house, Yatscombe, Boar's Hill, Oxford. Mr Murray\nleft the room and the door was closed before the subject was\nchosen. After the subject had been chosen and written down\nLady Mary Murray went to the door and opened it. The floor\nB 2\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MARCH 1941\noutside was uncarpeted. I noticed that Mr Murray's footsteps\nwere always clearly audible coming towards us from some dis-\ntance ; I counted as a rule seven footsteps before lie reached\nthe drawing-room door, and never, I think, less than six.\nAfter he entered the room nothing was said by any experi-\nmenter, except what has been noted in the record, until after\neach experiment was concluded.\nThis is my husband's note of the same date with a sketch plan :\nThere were present (besides G. M.) Lady Mary, Helen and self.\nDining - Room\n\u2014jjDooRT]\u2014\nASSAGEj\nFIRE\nLADY M\nCHAIR\nn\nSELF\nH\nCHAIR\nDoor\n[Note. \u2014Dotted lines \u2014 and words in square brackets\nadded later to explain position of dining-room.]\nOn each occasion G. M. [Dr Gilbert Murray] went out, shut-\nting the door behind him, the rest of us remaining seated.\nNothing was said in his presence as a clue to the subject of\nthe experiment, except that in one or two cases the agent was\nindicated beforehand, e.g., when I was agent.\nDuring G. M.'s absence the conversation was in low voices.\nI do#\nnot think it could normally be heard even by a person\nstanding just outside the closed door of the room.\nWhen the subject had been chosen and noted in writing,\nLady Mary went and opened the door, returning to her seat\nat once without a word.\nWithin a few seconds of the door opening G. M.'s steps could\nbe heard coming along the passage (uncarpeted). I counted\nthe steps every time and there were never less than seven before\nhe entered the room. There was no doubt in my mind that he\nwas at some distance from the door when opened by Lady Mary.\n\fMARCH 1941 Experiments in Telepathy 31\nOn entering the room he took the agent's hand. Sometimes\nthe answer came at once, e.g., \" Switzerland and glaciers \". In\nthe case when I was agent he held my hand for (I judge) 30\nseconds before speaking. There was never any fishing or beating\nabout the bush. None of the incidents had been discussed\nbetween the Murrays and ourselves.\nAlthough these notes merely state that, before each subject was\nchosen, Dr Murray went from the drawing-room into the passage,\nthe drawing-room door being closed, it was understood that he went\ninto the dining-room and remained there till summoned, and I have\nno reason to suppose that this was not the case. I now pass to the\nrecord of the experiments.\nDate. May 23, 1931.\nPresent : G. M., Lady Mary Murray, W. H. Salter, H. de G.\nSalter.\n1\nH. S. I think of a time long ago when Mr Murray was with\nus in Switzerland and there was a trapeze outside the hotel,\nand he hung upside down and all the money fell out of his\npockets. We were amused.\nG. M. A feeling of old times and your father and mother\nand Jane Harrison.\n[Note by H. S. The date of the incident, as stated by Mr Murray,\nwas \" long ago \", about 1900. My father and mother were there.\nJane 'Harrison was not a member of the party at the time of the\ntrapeze incident, but she joined us shortly afterwards. It will be\nobserved that Mr Murray got the general atmosphere right, but\ncould not get any impression of the particular scene. He told me\nafterwards in conversation that he did not remember the incident.]\n2\nH. S. A play I went to see the other day ; Robert Browning\ngoing to see Elizabeth and pulling up all the blinds to let the\nsun in, at Wimpole Street.\nG. M. No.\n3\nH. S. Something fantastic. H. G.

Wells, don't know what\nhe's doing, seems to be looking rather fat and smiling.\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1941\n[Note by H. S. The only impression clearly obtained was of H. G.\nWells and a general impression that the incident was cheerful.]\n4\nH. S. (subject suggested by M. M.). Einstein receiving his\ndegree.\nG. M. Oh, I know this, there's great applause, it's Einstein\nhaving his degree.\n(After he had been told it was M. M.'s suggestion.) I did\nsuspect it wasn't Helen.\n5\nH. S. I think of my mother climbing in Switzerland and a\nguide pulling over a crevasse and she fell down and hung on a\nrope.\nG. M. This feels like Switzerland and glaciers and things.\n(Not an incident I know?) I should think it was your mother\nfalling into a crevasse.\n[Note by H. S. This incident occurred when I was quite a small\nchild. I was not with my mother at the time, nor was Mr Murray.\nWhether he had ever been told the incident I cannot say.]\n6\nH. S. S. M. and myself riding together on a very fat cob,\nbareback.\nG. M. No, a faint impression of a fat and rather gaily dressed\nwoman.\n[Note by H. S. S. M. and I were playfellows as children and used\noften to ride together on a fat cob. The only impression clearly\nconveyed here seems to have been the idea of fatness ; the cob was\nin fact a female.]\n7\nI\nH. S. (subject suggested by M. M.). Jane Harrison angry\nwith Belloc in the study at Barford.\nG. M. [to H. S.] I think this isn't you. Well, the thing I'm\ngetting is something that I don't think you know. Is it you?\nIf it's you, Mary, it's Miss Harrison and Belloc, when she bit\nher lip.\n8\nW. H. S. Macbeth and the Three Witches.\nG. M. The thing that comes to me is \" Her husband's to\nAleppo gone, Master of the Tiger \".\n\fMARCH 1941 Experiments in Telepathy 33\n[Note by H. S. The answer is of course appropriate, the words\nbeing spoken by one of the witches in \" Macbeth \".]\n9\nM. M. I think of the cathedral at Lund in 1916 when they\nwere apologising because the little privatdozent only spoke\nGerman.\nG. M. I think it's something to do with Sweden. Is it?\nM. M. Yes.\nG. M. That little man shifting about in the cathedral at\nLund, because he could only speak German.\n(He added here, \" I think that's because there is a roll,\ndiploma or something from Sweden in the hall.\")\nContemporary note by W. H. S. There was lying in the hall a\nroll of cartridge paper wrapped round the middle with brown paper.\nLength about 30 inches. It had not come through post but by\nhand, and was in fact a drawing by Emery Walker of Hertford\nCollege ;\nnothing to do with Sweden or to suggest a connection\nwith Sweden. A real Swedish Diploma had come by post a few\ndays before.\n[Later note by H. S. This is a good example of G. M. inventing\nsomething to use as a peg on which to hang a veridical impression.\nCompare the incident of the horses' hooves quoted in Proc. XXIX,\npp. 60, 92, 93.]\n10\nM. M. Stephen [Dr Murray's son] arriving here about 2 in\nthe morning with his wife and a strange mottled greyhound.\nG. M. No, I shan't get this. I've got a feeling of being up\nlate, tiredness.\nM. M.

The incident was a real one and happened when\nI was a child. I do not think Mr Murray is likely ever to have\nheard of it. Here the place was rightly named and the fact that a\nliterary man was concerned.]\n13\nM. M. An old Greek scholar who went to Harvard hospital\nto have his burnt hand dressed.\n(This experiment was not tried owing to a telephone dis-\nturbance and a visitor.

Come into the garden, Maud,\nFor the black bat night has flown. (Tennyson.)\nG. M. (entering). This feels like a poem, \" Come into the\ngarden, Maud.\"\n\fMARCH 1941 Experiments in Telepathy 35\n17\nW. H. S. I'll take a classical subject which is also a picture.\nTurner's picture of Ulysses deriding Polyphemus.\nG. M. It isn't a picture is it ?\nW. H. S. Yes.\nG. M. I don't think I can get it. A sort of Turner picture,\neffects of light.\n[Note by W. H. S. \" Effects of Light \" are of course characteristic\nof Turner's pictures : the Polyphemus is a conspicuous example.]\nThe note which my husband made on the 25th May of our experi-\nments that day to test the possibilities of hyperesthesia runs as\nfollows :\n\" To test the results of last night's experiments from the point of\nview of hyperesthesia, Helen read a passage taken at random from\na book (Pride and, Prejudice) consisting of a single sentence. This\nshe did three times. The first time I went into the dining-room and\nstood by the sideboard, the dining-room door open. The second\ntime I stood at the end of the passage (from the drawing-room).\nThe third time outside the closed door of the drawing-room. The\nfirst two times I heard absolutely nothing. The third time I heard\nthe sound of Helen's voice, but not a word.\n\" As a further test Helen went out of the drawing-room and stood\nin the passage about three yards from the closed drawing-room door.\nI took a book at random (Harry Richmond) and read from paragraph\non p. 216 beginning '*\nI wanted bloom \" down to line 13 of paragraph,\nlife and death \", at which point Helen came in. I began reading\nat about the level of voice used in the room last night and got\ngradually louder and louder ; at the point Helen came in I was\nfairly declaiming and talking much louder than in ordinary con-\nversation. Helen said she caught the words \" almost invariable\n\"\n(11. 9 and 10), and that these were the first she heard distinctly.\nShe thought that soon after she went out she heard the word\n\" down \" and this is in fact in line 2 of the paragraph. I was\nstanding in the middle of the drawing-room facing the closed door\nas I read. The house was quiet. During the experiments last night\nneither Helen nor I faced the door when speaking.\nThird test . I sat in the chair in the drawing-room facing the fire,\ni.e., away from the door, and read from a book A Doll's House,\nArcher's translation, p. 60, Hehner's long speech. Helen stood\noutside the dining-room door. She came in at the end and said,\n\" Did you read the word '\npossible ' \" ? The word \" impossible\n\"\n\f36 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MARCH 1941\nappears towards the end of the speech [line 11]. I began reading\nat the level of last night's talk and gradually raised my voice a\nlittle, but not much.\"\nHyperaesthesia, or some form of unconscious sense-perception,\nhas always been accepted by Dr Murray as an explanation, or\npartial explanation, of the results of experiments with him : indeed\nhe himself put it forward in his Presidential Address (Proc, Vol.\nXXIX, pp. 61 and 62). The evidence for and against, derived from\nthe first series of experiments with him, is further discussed at\npp. 73-79 of the same volume. In the second series of experiments\nreported in Proc, Vol. XXXIV, the distance between agents and\npercipient was greater to an extent rendering any hyperaesthesia\nof the recognised senses a much less probable explanation.\nThere is not, I think, in the experiments I am reporting any\ninstance parallel to the cases of apparent mishearing quoted on\npp. 73-75 of Vol. XXIX, which would provide internal evidence\nfor hyperaesthesia, and the tests by my husband and myself, which\nhave just been described, convinced us that a very high degree of\nhyperaesthesia would have to be postulated, to account in any\ndegree for the results. So far as these particular experiments go,\nwe see no reason to postulate it.\nThe interruption on the second evening was most regrettable, as\nit cut short the experiments and prevented such variation of con-\nditions as might otherwise have been attempted, with a view to\nobtaining clues to some of the problems awaiting settlement.\nIn the two evenings seventeen experiments were attempted and in\nsixteen an answer was given. No. 13, which was interrupted before\nan answer could be given, has been excluded from the analysis given\nbelow. In this analysis I have classified the subjects as follows :\nI. Literary or artistic.\nII. Incidents personally connected with Dr Murray.\nIII. Incidents not personally connected with him, but known\nto him.\nIV. Other real incidents.\nV. Imaginary incidents.\nThe degrees of success are graded thus : A correct or nearly so,\nB correct as to some notable element, C mainly incorrect, but not\nentirely, D complete failure.\nThere were three agents, M. M. = Lady Mary Murray ; W. H. S.\n= my husband ; H. S. = myself. In some instances where I acted\nas agent, the subject was suggested by Lady Mary Murray : these\nI have classified as if she had been the agent.\n\fmarch 1941 Experiments in Telepathy 37\nTable I\nExperiment No. Subject Agent Grade\n23\/5\/31 1 II H.

Even, however, if these\nbe disregarded, and only Groups II, III, IV, covering real incidents,\nbe counted, Lady Mary Murray was obviously more successful than\nI was.\nIt may be said of these experiments that they prove nothing, and\nI should be the first person to admit that they were not carried out\nunder laboratory conditions ; at the same time both my husband\nand I are firmly of opinion that the conditions were good enough\nto exclude any form of normal leakage : if Dr Murray could over-\nhear what the agents said to each other in the drawing-room with\nthe door shut, then his auditory hyperaesthesia is certainly not, in\nthe ordinary sense, normal.\nNor of course are experiments with \" free \" material, and on a\nsmall scale at that, capable of being evaluated with precision. But\nthere are some problems regarding telepathy which it seems to me\nare more likely to be solved by the use of \"free\" material of\nintrinsic interest to agent and percipient than by any other method.\nAN EXAMINATION OF MR J.

This\nresulted -apparently from the Society's Review (Journal, Vol.\n\fmarch 1941 \" The Physics of the Divining Rod \" 39\nXXXI, p. 215) of The Physics of the Divining Rod, by Mr\nFranklin and himself which I was asked to write. My first reaction\nwas to ignore Mr Maby's Statement which seemed to me to savour of\nabuse : e.g. he accuses the reviewer of subversive innuendoes,\nwhich he must encounter for the sake of modern dowsing, and says\nhe may properly protest against mis-statements, innuendoes and\ninsinuations, and more particularly so when a critic is not apparently\nin a position of authority with respect to the subject in hand.\nSince, however, the Society has thought fit to devote some eight\npages of the Journal to Mr Maby's disparagement of my Review\n(doubtless on account of the interesting light which it throws on his\nviews regarding what he considers he has accomplished in the\ndirection of establishing a rational and scientific basis for some of\nthe phenomena of dowsing) I consider it is in the interests of the\nSociety that I should take a little time and trouble in examining\nMr Maby's conclusions, and ignore the abuse.\nThe Society invited a physicist, and not a dowser, to do the\nreviewing because the chief novelty in the book is a claim that\nphysical apparatus in the vicinity of electrically conducting bodies\n(including flowing water) is affected by them through certain rays\nor radiations, and that it is these which are responsible for some, at\nleast, of the \" dowsing reactions.\"\nThe importance of such a discovery, if true, can hardly be over-\nestimated. On p. 421 of The Physics of the Divining Rod it\nis stated :\n\" Every conductor in air appears to be surrounded by\na very local field of ionising |>articles \" ; and again on the same\npage : \"In the conductors themselves points of reaction can be\nfound at certain positions which also change at intervals ; these\npoints of reaction and their changes of position correspond to\nstanding waves upon the conductors.\" These assertions are\nopposed to those of physicists based on ordinary laboratory ex-\nperience with conductors in air, and, if true, would require some\nexplanation of why no such effects are being noticed in the labora-\ntory every day, especially when one considers that \" conductors\nin air \" are a part of the apparatus used in every single electrical\nmeasurement.\nCan a reviewer be blamed, when he is presented with reiterated\nclaims made in technical language, of whose meaning he can have\nno doubt, and which are opposed to common experience, for pointing\nout the fact that no single record of any observation which might\njustify such claims is either given in the text or specifically referred\nto in print elsewhere? One gathers, on reading pages 19 and 20 of\nMr Maby's Statement, that his reply is \" yes,\" and he proceeds to\n\f40 J'ournal of Society for Psychical Research march 1941\nshow how in seven numbered paragraphs which contain many\nunsupported assertions requiring careful consideration.\n(1) Of all the \" astonishing \" discoveries which have been made\nin Physics during the last (say) ten years, I wonder whether Mr\nMaby, or indeed anyone else, could mention three which were \" made\nwith the aid of simple instruments backed by careful observation\nand logical reasoning.\" Surely it is true that, where ionising\nparticles and electromagnetic radiation are the subjects of novel\nexperiments, the apparatus required is, in general, both expensive\nand complicated.\n(2) and (3) (I quote) \" With regard to the graphs in our book, be\nit noted that only two out of twenty-eight, and these two are not\ntrue graphs, lack the numerical scales about which our reviewer\ncomplains that only '\na few show scales of numbers at the bottom\nand at the left-hand edge.' His statement is therefore demonstrably\nuntrue.\" I have the book before me and note that there are 28\ngraphs of which not more than 18 are described as referring to\nphysical measurements in the accepted meaning of this expression.\nOf these eighteen, no less than fourteen show but one numbered\nscale\u2014the time scale at the bottom. The four remaining graphs\nhave indeed two numbered scales, but no actual readings are\nshown, the ordinate being in every case a mean or \" smoothed\n\"\nvalue. It seems unfortunate, to say the least, that the only\nexample of a direct observation which Mr Maby has put forward\nin support of his views, an observation undoubtedly made by\nhimself on his own book, should be entirely erroneous, the only\nfortunate feature being the ease with which, in this case, the ob-\nservation may be repeated at any time by any of our members\nwho have the good fortune to possess a copy of \" The Physics of\nthe Divining Rod.\"\n(4) In this paragraph Mr Maby tells us that he and his collaborator\nMr Franklin were compelled to compromise as regards the detail\nand technicality of the work because readers of diverse occupations\nand mentality must all be catered for at the same time.\nBut why must they? Most of the great scientific discoveries in\nour times were first published in technical form ;\nmonographs and\npopular expositions came later when general acceptance of the\nnew material, as a consistent part of our knowledge of the subject,\nwas attained.\n(5) I am not aware that any accounts of discoveries in Physics,\nother than those of the authors of The Physics of the Divining Rod,\nhave first appeared in connection with investigations of subjects\nusually considered to be in the field of Psychical Research. There\n\fMARCH 1941 \" The Physics of the Divining Rod\n\"\n41\nhave, however, been some experiments, such as those of Lord\nRayleigh on luminous effects from magnets, which gave results in\nagreement with what might have been expected from well esta-\nblished theory.1\n(6) I find this paragraph rather obscure. Mr Maby writes :\n\" Can a . . . field of Hertzian radiation ... in the neighbourhood\nof a subterranean water vein, for instance, be recorded clearly by\nsuch and such a radio receiver, operating at such and such a\nfrequency? And we have found the answer to this and many\nsimilar questions was undoubtedly in the affirmative.\" If this\nmeans that an underground stream is the cause of a radio-set's\npicking up radiation of a definite frequency which it would not have\ndone but for the presence of the stream, then, if confirmed, a novel\nfeature of the physical world has been disclosed. If, on the other\nhand, the radiation in question was first produced by means of a\nradio transmission set, and reception on another set was considered\nto be different in the vicinity of the stream from what it would have\nbeen had no stream been there, then the conclusions may be very\ndifferent. Many factors would have to be considered, and it would\nbe wise to adopt a sceptical attitude regarding any novel concepts\nuntil one is in possession of all the relevant facts, and thus able\ncorrectly to assess \" the sum total of the evidence available.\"\n(7) A considerable part of the skill of the trained research worker\nlies in his ability to give a clear and concise account of such details\nof his experiments as are necessary to ensure their successful\nrepetition. He does not say '*\ncome up and see me some time,\nand I shall be very glad to answer any inquiries direct or to arrange\nfor suitable demonstrations of the phenomena.\" Nor does he reach\nhis conclusions, even though they are tentative, through a host of\nirrelevancies and a plethora of non sequitur.\nI do not claim to be an authority on Dowsing, but I have had\nsome twenty years' experience of the supervision of Scientific\nResearch in a University. I submit that, in reviewing The Physics\nof the Divining Rod, I confined my remarks to certain aspects of\nthe work upon which I was well qualified to remark, and I am glad\nthat Mr Maby has now had the opportunity of giving members of\nour Society a fuller account of the very wide scope of his book.\nC. C. L. Gregory.\n1\nProceedings, Vol. XLV, p. 19.\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1941\nCORRESPONDENCE\nParanormal Cognition\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014Every student of Psychical Research will welcome the recent\noutspoken and courageous article by the President 1\nin which he\nemphasises the growing necessity for philosophy to take into its\npurview the facts of telepathy and clairvoyance with all their far-\nreaching implications. Thanks largely to the adoption of the methods\nof the psychological laboratory, first-class experimental evidence for\nboth telepathy and clairvoyance as well as evidence for precognition\nis steadily accumulating both in this country and in America.\nColumbia and Duke Universities have shown the way, and we have\nnow the Perrott Studentship at Cambridge, but the psychologists\nof the English provincial universities still lag behind, clinging with\na curious conservatism to outmoded conceptions of the relations of\nbody to mind in spite of the revolution in Physics which has replaced\nthe crude mechanistic theories of the Victorian era by others more\nin accordance with the views of Kant.\nBut the main object of this letter is to discuss an interesting\nsuggestion contained in the President's article and quoted on p. 13\nof the January-February Journal. Professor Price remarks that in\nthe card-guessing experiments there frequently appears to be nothing\ncognitive at all but merely a motor reaction to a stimulus which\nreaches the percipient's mind in some unknown way. That is to\nsay, the subject who is guessing does not appear to receive a mental\npicture of the card that is being looked at, but responds almost\nautomatically by calling out or writing down a symbol.\nNow in rapid card-calling there is much to suggest that, in a\nsuperficial sense, this is true. In the case of the subject with whom\nI am experimenting at present, for example, the subject writes down\nalmost without hesitation at each guess one of the five letters E, G,\nL, P, Z, these being the initials of five names of animals. The\nrecording of 50 guesses takes only four or five minutes. The per-\ncipient tells me that generally he receives no mental picture of the\nanimal but only a verbal image of the initial letter. But the subject\nappears to be in a normal mental state and to know perfectly well\nthe letter he has just written for he will often pass remarks such\nas \" I feel that one is quite wrong \" or \" I shouldn't be surprised\nif the last four prove to be all correct \".\nIn still more rapid guessing such as takes place in the experiments\nof Mr Tyrrell the opening of the boxes would appear to be as \" auto-\n1\nPhilosophy, Vol. XV, No. 60, pp. 363-385.\n\fMARCH 1941 Correspondence 43\nmatic\n'\n' and spontaneous as is the striking of the keys by a skilled\npianist or typist.\nBut this apparent automatism I venture to think merely means\nthat consciousness has been displaced to another level of the per-\nsonality but not obliterated. A beginner at the piano has most of\nhis conscious attention concentrated on the playing of the correct\nnotes, but when he has built up the necessary mental organisation\nfor this essential task the accompanying consciousness becomes dis-\nsociated from the normal personality which is now free to deal with\nthe nuances of expression and interpretation. I accept indeed the\nviews of Janet that any kind of complex mental effort is accom-\npanied by a corresponding consciousness at some level or other of\nthe personality. I myself possess the gift of being able to write\nverse without being conscious of the words my hand is writing\nthough ever and again whole phrases flash back into my normal\nconsciousness. Now such communications as those purporting to\nemanate from Oscar Wilde are evidence to me not only of sub-\nconscious mental activity but of an organised literary personality.\nBy a \" personality \" I mean a self-conscious being, similar in many\nrespects to my waking self, but exhibiting literary tastes which often\nappear alien to my normal consciousness and employing forms of\nliterary expression which I have never cultivated. I am not of\ncourse here concerned with the question whether these conscious\norganisations which manifest by automatic writing and which claim\nto be \" Oscar Wilde \" or \" Conan Doyle \" are in any true sense\nsurvivals of the living men they impersonate.\nBut I do suggest that from a literary standpoint they appear to\nbe well-developed personalities. In ordinary table-tilting experi-\nments the personalities which manifest are often of a more limited\nand rudimentary kind.\nNow in my recent paper on card-guessing [Proceedings, Part 162,\np. 193] I have given reasons for the belief that there sometimes exist\nin the mind of the subject or guesser rudimentary conscious organi-\nsations which not only receive the telepathic knowledge but appear\nto be aware when they have failed to transmit it correctly to the\nwaking mind. In some cases there seemed to be a process of mental\n\" exorcism \" employed by the subconscious entity to get rid of a\ndisturbing image. Of course it is much too early to generalise from\nresults obtained in any single series of experiments, but it is worth\nwhile to remark that Mr Tyrrell also has given his reasons for sup-\nposing that there are controlling \" psychic entities \" in Miss John-\nson's mind which to some extent determine the success or failure\nof the experiments.\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1941\nOur inability to understand the likes and dislikes of these entities\nmay conceivably account for many of the failures to obtain suc-\ncessful results in card-guessing experiments. If we could only\nestablish communication with them\u2014by means of automatic writing\nfor instance\u2014I believe we should have gone a long way towards\nunderstanding the conditions under which telepathy and clairvoy-\nance take place.\nBut, however that may be, I feel reasonably certain that success-\nful card-guessing calls into play very complex co-conscious organi-\nsations and rudimentary personalities existing below or above the\nlevel of ordinary waking consciousness, and that what is involved\nis something far different from a mere automatic motor response to\na telepathic stimulus. Yours, etc., S. G. Soal.\nSir,\u2014I am indeed sorry to have disturbed Mr Besterman's\nequilibrium, and still more so that he should take exception to the\ntone of my letter. None the less, I fear I must stick to my guns\nas regards the point at issue.\nEvery serious student of psychical research knows that there are\nmany situations (as sometimes in other sciences also) in which it is\nnecessary to guard against the possibilities of malobservation,\nmisremembering, auto- or heterosuggestion, wishful thinking, and\nthe like ; and that all experiments of whatever nature should be so\nconducted as to reduce the likelihood of error to a minimum.\nBut if I report that on a certain evening I drew and put up in my\nstudy a picture of a Butterfly, whereas I actually drew and put up\na picture of a Balance, there is no scope that I can see for any of\nthese possibilities or, humanly speaking, for \"error\" as ordinarily\nunderstood : I am either certifiably insane, or a plain liar. There\nis no question here of controlling a medium in the dark, or of\n\" remembering \" a veridical dream after the occurrence of the\nverifying episode, or of not allowing a photographic plate-holder\nout of one's sight, or anything of that kind ; it is a matter of\nreporting correctly or incorrectly an action about which there can\nbe no possible doubt or ambiguity. 1\nNor is there any question,\nfrom the circumstances, of the experimenter (myself or another)\nbeing subject to the misleading suggestions of a medium or presti-\ndigitator.\n1\nSufficiently gross carelessness in handling the originals, coupled with a\ndefective memory, might result in the order of the originals within a particular\nexperiment being misreported, if no note were made at the time of which\noriginal was used on which day. But even this would not affect the main\nresults (Section IVa of my paper), while appropriate notes were in fact made.\n\fMABCH 1941 Correspondence 45\nIn other words, despite Mr Besterman's implied disclaimer, the\npoint essentially is one of veracity and not of \" error.'\"\nNow, I don't particularly mind, from the personal point of view ;\nfor I do not suppose that Mr Besterman is accusing me of fabricating\nthe whole business by stating, after seeing the drawings, that\noriginals were used which were in fact not used. Nor do I wish to\nadopt an attitude of hauteur and truculence ;\nand least of all to\nclaim for myself \" exceptions and immunities \" denied to others.\nOn the contrary, it is entirely on public and not on private\ngrounds that I protest against the suggestion that any reasonably\nsane and responsible experimenter, reporting an act about which\nthere can be no possible doubt or ambiguity, is automatically suspect\nof inveracity (and I have just shown that there is virtually no\nalternative) just because he happens to be conducting an experiment\non paranormal cognition and not on, say, the relative intelligence\nquotients of blondes and brunettes.\nAny such allegation is, I venture to assert with all deference, no\npart of \" the canons of scientific methodology,\" but a wholly\ngratuitous and arbitrary dictum such as no sensible person would\nentertain for a moment.\nMoreover, the general adoption of such a standpoint might well\nbe highly pernicious. Almost our principal aim at the present\ntime should be (and mine certainly is) to remove experiments of\nthis sort from the domain of the private and exceptional to that\nof the public and commonplace. I very much doubt whether this\nwill be achieved solely by the performance of experiments, however\nsuccessful, by individual psychical researchers (myself or others),\nno matter how long a regression of witnesses of witnesses of witnesses\nwe may introduce : such experiments, in my judgement, however\nimportant and informative they may be, cannot have much more\neffect on the scientific world as a whole than establishing a prima\nfacie case for systematic and independent investigation, and\ndeveloping the most promising technique for use in it.\nWhat we want to see is experiments of this general kind, and\nresearches arising out of them, being conducted, almost as a matter\nof course, by every worth-while psychological department in the\ncountry ; but we shall not accelerate this state of affairs if we lay\nit down in advance that everyone who touches the subject is ipso\nfacto transformed into a fool or a knave. Does Mr Besterman\nreally suggest that, if Professor X of University Y is good enough\nto undertake an experiment of this sort, we should repudiate his\nresults on the ground that he cannot be relied upon to report\ncorrectly whether he drew a Hawk or a Handsaw on Tuesday night ?\n\f46 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1941\nOr does lie seriously consider that the situation is parallel to that\nof an eminent chemist, say, being spoofed by a physical medium\nin the dark?\nIncidentally, why does he imply (p. 23, lines 8 and 9) that my\nexperiments are \" non-repeatable \" ? I should have thought myself\nthat their repeatability (the importance of which I did not fail to\nstress in my paper) was just about their most striking and satis-\nfactory feature. It is true that to carry out five experiments on\nthe scale of those reported is laborious, but this has nothing to do\nwith \" repeatability \" in the relevant sense. What matters is that\nI did not use specially selected \" sensitives,\" or rely on hypnosis or\ndrugs or dissociated states, or find it necessary to impose special\nconditions ; on the contrary, I used (if I may say so) quite ordinary\nsubjects working for the most part wherever and under whatever\nconditions they pleased\u2014and what more one wants to constitute\nrepeatability in a psychological experiment I should be interested\nto learn. At the present time, moreover, experiments of the same\ntype are being repeated, with considerable success, on various scales\nin various places and by various people ;\nthough not, I regret to\nsay, by Mr Besterman.\nNo : I think the Noble Shades whom Mr Besterman so piously\ninvokes still walk untroubled in the Elysian fields ; but I am much\ntempted to suggest , in all amiability, that he himself is \" staggered\n\"\nmainly because he had not a leg to stand upon!\nI am Sir, etc.,\nWhately Carington.\nMr Collins's Pamphlet\nSir,\u2014I observe that from time to time you give space to authors\nto reply to criticisms in reviews of their books, and I should like to\nsay a few words about Mr Bichmond's reasoned and not entirely\nunsympathetic review of my paper \" Why I do believe in Survival \".\nI must apologise first to him for overlooking his presence when\nI read my paper. This is due to my unfamiliarity with the appear-\nance of most of the officers of the Society.\nMy main object in writing the paper was as a protest against the\nattitude adopted by Professor Dodds that the only evidence worth\ndiscussion is that received through mediums, and his statement that\nphysical phenomena \" do not come much in question here, since the\ngreat majority of them do not afford even prima facie evidence of\nsurvival \". Although the Society as such professes to have no views,\nthis is the view that seems now to guide those with influence in it.\n\fMAECH 1941 Correspondence, 47\nIndeed it is obvious to anyone who reads through the Proceedings\nof recent years that the attention of the Society is focused on\nmessages received through mediums and experimental work on\ntelepathy and clairvoyance. It is impossible to argue the matter\nhere. All I will say is that at least I am only following the views\nof Myers and Camille Flammarion regarding apparitions, of Sir\nWilliam Barrett about death bed visions, of Geley and Lombroso\nin respect of materialisations and those of Sir Oliver Lodge in con-\nsidering that survival is established by evidence taken as a whole.\nAt any rate I only wished to draw the attention of the Society to\nthe impasse they had reached and to try to draw them back to\nthe lines on which the founders worked. Mr Richmond agrees that\nthere is something in this line of argument and my only regret is that\nmy paper will not be on record either in the Proceedings or Journal.\nThere is one point at least on which Mr Richmond has hardly\ndone justice to my argument and that is in regard to the functioning\nof consciousness outside the body. He criticises the importance\nwhich I attach to the etheric body and \" its aptitude for travelling\nin space \" on the ground that it is a physical hypothesis for which\nno physical evidence is established but does not even mention those\ncases which I regard as the most important, namely those in which\nthe individual in full consciousness observes his body from the out-\nside. He does say however that \" the mind fairly readily forms\nnon-factual images and impressions of bodily location \". This is a\nqueer remark because it is not a question of bodily location, in the\nsense of the physical body. In any case I am not clear whether it\nis meant to cover this type of case ; but I would like to quote a\nsentence from a resume of a lecture delivered by Mr Richmond\nhimself at the British College of Science on February 3, 1937 (page\n50, Psychic Science, April 1927) :\n\" Scientifically we have no proof\nof our own existence or anyone else's, our starting point is what we\nare told by our own minds.\" This is a restatement of the dictum\nof Descartes \" Cogito ergo sum \"\n\u2014in connection with which I quoted\nProfessor Bozzano as saying \" Psychologically speaking the fact of\nfeeling oneself existing personally in the fullness of sentient and\nconscious faculties, outside the body and contemplating the body,\nis a fact worthy of profound meditation.\" I feel this is a good\nexample of the type of evidence to which the Society is paying little\nor no attention : yet as shown in my article in Light for September 19\nthese are facts which are capable of experimental verification, even\none might say to physical proof to some extent.\nMr Richmond considers that my paper is \" little more than a\nseries of argued assertions, distinguished by consistency of aim rather\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march 1941\nthan cogency of reasoning \"'.\nAs I pointed out with great emphasis\nit was only intended as an outline of the case and it was only possible\nto present an outline. Argument in detail was out of the question.\nThe actual cases cited were of little importance and I was perfectly\nready to omit any which were considered insufficiently established.\nWhat types of evidence are established is a matter of opinion, and\nfrom among the men of science of standing who have really studied\nthese phenomena I think I could cite more supporters than Mr Rich-\nmond. That my inferences from them are illogical, I most strongly\ndeny.\nI have now published my paper at my own expense. In the hope\nthat I might reach a larger number of the members and also recoup\nsome small part of the cost, I offered the Society a number of copies\nat cost price (8d.) to circulate to members along with the Journal,\nbut this offer too was refused. I can only hope now that members\nwill take the trouble to send a shilling to the address below, so that\nthey may judge for themselves.\nYours faithfully, B. Abdy Collins.\n16 Penhelig, Aberdovey.\n(The remark that \" the mind fairly readily forms non-factual\nimages and impressions of bodily location \" applies, quite strictly,\nas against the contention that any such images and impressions\nshould of themselves be regarded as veridical. The impression of\nbeing \" outside \", and perceiving, one's own body is an impression\nthat the bodily location is separated from the location of the perceiv-\ning self. There does not appear to be any evidence to show whether\nthis impression corresponds with a fact of bi-location. Mr Collins\nhas no need to \" deny \" an illogicality which was not imputed to\nhim : an argument can be logical as far as it goes without being\ncogent. The course suggested, of circulating members' pamphlets\nwith the Journal, has never been followed by the Society, and if ever\nadopted would have created awkward precedents.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nSir,\u2014Mr Abdy Collins in his preface to Why I do believe in\nSurvival records the impression that no officer of the Society was\npresent when his paper was read on 1940, April 24, and you, Sir,\nin your review (Journal S.P.R., Vol. XXXI, p. 210) claim to have\nbeen the sole officer who was free to attend.

M. Bishop, is a\nmember of the Society, and sent the material for our files, rather as\na contribution to discussion of the subject than as an addition to\nevidence. It will be seen that circumstances did not favour the\ncollection of supporting evidence concerning the dreams and corre-\nsponding facts which are detailed below, also that as evidence of\nprecognition, as distinct from telepathy or chance-coincidence, the\nmaterial varies considerably in quality. But such is the nature of\nthe material which we obtain on actual investigation of the subject,\nand Miss Bishop allows her notes to be printed here as an example\n\fApril-May 1941 Foreknowledge in Dreams 51\nof such mixed material and of the ideas that occur to a student of\nthe subject in trying to sort out the explanations for experiences of\nthis kind in an orderly way. It is of considerable help in the sifting\nout of paranormal factors in the recorded experiences which we\nreceive when the experients can give as clear an account as possible\nof all the operative factors known to themselves.\n\u2014\nEd.)\nIn 1935, having recently read J. W. Dunne's book An Experiment\nwith Time, I decided to watch my own dreams with his theory in\nview. I was unable to follow Mr Dunne's analysis of the nature of\nTime, but since I have been all my life a vivid dreamer and in the\nhabit of remembering many, if not most, of my dreams for some\nhours or days afterwards, it seemed possible that I should discover\nwhether I was to any extent dreaming the future.\nDuring the autumn of 1935, therefore, I kept a file in which I\nnoted a number of dreams which might relate to future events. I\nincluded any dream which was of such a nature that I should have\ntaken it for granted that it related to the event had that event\nhappened before, rather than after, the dream. Taking this as my\ncriterion, I collected in a few weeks a dozen or so dreams which\nmight be cases of precognition.\nUnfortunately I had no means of obtaining supporting evidence\nsince I live alone and have no one to whom I could relate the dreams\nbefore the arrival of the material to which they seemed to relate.\nHad I been able to obtain such evidence, I should have sent the\ncollection to Mr Dunne or the S.P.R. at the time. However, I was\nsatisfied, both from Mr Dunne's book and from my other reading,\nthat we already have a good deal of well-supported evidence to\nshow that some people, in some circumstances, can and do glimpse\nthe future. It was therefore of more interest to me to see whether\nI could throw some light on the circumstances in which such glimpses\ntake place.\nSince I am not a professional philosopher, I decided to leave the\nquestion of the nature of Time to God and the metaphysicians and\nstudy my dreams from the psychological point of view. It is in the\nhope that my notes on this subject may be suggestive that I send\nthem to the S.P.R., with a table which gives details of the majority\nof the dreams to which they refer.\nNotes on the dreams detailed in the accompanying table.\nI. My first observation was that, although my waking interests\nand my reading are mainly of an intellectual nature (I was reading\nchiefly psychology at the time), not one of the dreams related in\nany way to my intellectual interests.\nC 2\n\f-\n-\ns\no\no\n\u2014\nCO\n\u2014 B\n- 1\nB o\no .a\nw =\na ^\n. & . _S 2 o3\ni-H CB f^l 43 .5 CB <\nj_i ,-- \u2014 U\nis\n\"3\nO o3\n^ ,\n43 E\nO o3 .\nB <\n2 o .\n!\n~ a\na s\n-\na\no\nco >\n_ CB \u00abB\n-o E CD >\n\u2014 Hi g s\n9 A I?\n\u2014 \u2014\no3 o3\n\u00a33 +=>\nCB\nP-fi 43-=\n> -\n:\n- > -a -e\n\u2022 r S cj 3\n3 CB O CD\n1\ncb a ft\ni, E CB\nCB\n>~.

The subject-matter of the dreams was of an apparently trivial\nnature and completely useless from the practical point of view, i.e.\nas material for action.\nIII. In almost every case, however, the subject, though apparently\ntrivial, was one which had for me personally a strong emotional\nsignificance. This point seems to me to be of importance. I there-\nfore append a note on each of the dreams considered from this point\nof view.\nDreams 1, 2, 14.\nWhen a young child, I was at the seaside with my father. He\nwas carrying me in his arms and wading in the sea when a big wave\nswept him off his feet and covered us both. I was terrified\u2014it was\nmy first intimation that my father's protection was not infallible.\nSince then I have always feared waves and the incoming tide.\nThese three dreams are therefore linked with a subconscious fear.\nDream 3.\nWhen a child, a joint in one of my feet was dislocated and the\nresulting slight enlargement of the foot has always been a trial to\nme both because I hate deformity and because of a love of dancing.\nPerfectly-shaped feet have therefore a strong emotional significance\nfor me.\nDream 4.\nThirty years or so ago I read an account of the cruelties involved\nin the fur trade. Since then I have worn only \" fabric furs \" and\nhave such a horror of real fur that I dislike touching it. This dream\nis therefore linked with a subconscious disgust.\nIn addition, I have all my life been very interested in dress, the\nmore so because as a child my clothes were so severe and ugly that\nthey were a continual trial to my growing sense of beauty. This\ndream has therefore a double emotional link.\nDream 5.\nI have always had a tendency to forget my umbrella, and , as my\nincome had recently dropped, I could no longer afford the habit of\nlosing my belongings. This is probably the emotional link with the\nsubject of lost property.\nDream 6.\nI am very fond of animals (though nervous of some wild ones),\nso much so that I have for over thirty years abstained from eating\nmeat.\n\fApril-May 1941 Foreknowledge in Dreams 57\nDreams 7 and 13.\nI am so attached to my little dog that anything involving or\nsuggesting her is of strong emotional significance to me.\nDream 8.\nFor private reasons, Persian rugs happen to have for me a strong\nemotional significance.\nDream 9.\nSee note on dream 4.\nDream 10.\nProbably telepathic, the emotional link being my friendship with\nthe other dreamer.\nDream, 11.\n\"\nI have all my life had an instinctive fear of heights, so much so\nthat though I lived in Switzerland for years I never dared to climb.\nThis dream is therefore linked with a subconscious fear.\nDream 12.\nNo clear emotional significance. As the details do not correspond\nvery exactly, I should regard this dream as a coincidence save that\nit is a curious dream and otherwise unaccountable.\nFrom the above analysis, it appears that although these dreams\nseem trivial they are, in fact, selected dreams. Moreover, they are\nselected in exactly the same way as most dreams are selected, i.e.\nby their emotional significance for the dreamer.\nIt seems likely that the dreams emoted in Mr Saltmarsh's book\nForeknowledge are selected in the same way, though the dreamer\nhimself can best analyse his dreams in this connection.\nDamage to a new carpet must have had an emotional significance\nfor Mrs Mackenzie (pp. 54-5). The Mrs C. who dreamed that she\nwas followed by a monkey is stated to have had\n'\n' an intense horror\nof monkeys \". As regards the elderly Quaker who dreamed the\nresult of the Derby, Mr Saltmarsh says that such a precognition is\ninappropriate and \" we can assign no reasonable explanation of the\noccurrence \". But he also says that the Quaker was \"an ardent\nopponent of betting \", i.e. the Derby, though forbidden to his\nconscious thoughts, had a strong emotional significance for him.\nAn \" ardent opponent \" of betting cannot be, psychologically speak-\ning, \" entirely uninterested \" in horse-racing. He is, on the con-\ntrary, at least as interested in it as Lady Astor is interested in the\nbrewers! One might even imagine the worthy Quaker's dreaming\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April-May 1941\nmind noting the winners in the spirit of the devout monk who,\nwhile consciously faithful to his vows, was heard to murmur, as he\nroused from sleep, \" God is merciful. One has dreams!\n\"\nIV. In the case of the majority of these dreams it is apparent that\nthe material was already in existence, though it had not yet reached\nme, at the time of the dream, since they seem to relate to material\ncontained in my next morning's newspaper. (It may perhaps be\nrelevant to mention that I was leading a very quiet life at the time,\nso that the paper was the chief event of my day.) Dream 11 and\npossibly dream 2 might, if they stood alone, be best explained as\ncases of clairvoyance in space, i.e. I may have seen clairvoyantly\nthe incidents in question. But in the majority of cases if foreknow-\nledge is excluded it would presumably be necessary to suppose that\nthe subject-matter of the newspaper articles was conveyed to me\nby some form of telepathy between myself and the writers. The\nsupposition that I am in telepathic communication with an indefinite\nnumber of (to me) unknown journalists in Fleet Street seems to me\nmore fantastic than the theory that my dreams offered me advance\nknowledge of material which came my way in the normal course of\nevents a few hours later.\nI think therefore that the simplest explanation of the series is\nthat my dreaming mind has the power, on occasion, to see my day's\nactivities in advance and to pick out bits of material which are of\nemotional significance to me personally.\nV. In the autumn of 1935 I was convalescing from a serious illness.\nI had been ill throughout 1934 with nervous exhaustion, insomnia\nand intermittent periods of somnambulism (dissociation) and was\nstill somewhat nervously exhausted in 1935. This may have some\nconnection with the fact that most of the dreams I collected were\nin the first few months after I decided to watch them (autumn 1935).\nLater, I had very occasional dreams of this type. I observed,\nhowever, that these were mostly on nights when for one reason or\nanother I was sleeping less well than usual.\nIn my case, therefore, there seems to be a relation between nervous\ndisturbance and precognitive (or clairvoyant) dreaming. It is as\nthough when my nerves are at rest my dreaming mind is content\nto chew the cud of past happenings. When I am in a disturbed\nstate, on the other hand, the dreaming mind has a tendency to peer\naround to see what is ahead. It would be of interest to know how\nfar other experimenters have noted any relationship between nervous\ndisturbance and precognitive or clairvoyant dreaming.\nVI. There seems to be nothing, either in the material given by Mr\nSaltmarsh or in my own experience, to suggest that the capacity\n\fApril-May 1941 A Personal Experience 59\nto glimpse the future is a power which is developing as evolution\nproceeds. If anything, the evidence seems to point the other way.\nThe glimpses obtained are apparently determined by the dreamer's\nemotions rather than by his intellect or his will, and though warnings\nare sometimes conveyed, such dreams are in the main useless as\nmaterial for action. Moreover, there seems to be evidence that\nprimitives and even the \" lower animals \" are capable of foreknow-\nledge.\nIt seems possible, therefore, that these intermittent and often\nuseless glimpses of the future are stray survivals from an earlier\nstage of evolution, when the \" specious present \" was wider than\nnow. Our sense of sight has developed throughout the ages from\na vague and diffuse awareness of light, which one finds even in\nplants, to the accurate but narrowly-focussed mechanism of the\nhuman eye. May it not be, therefore, that perception has become\nsimilarly narrowed to the compass of a relatively brief \" specious\npresent \"? Humanity has, so to speak, put on blinkers, the better\nto deal with the practical demands of the present moment. The\nindividual soul, a tiny fragment of the universal consciousness, has\nevolved for itself an organism capable of action only within narrow\nlimits, not because the future is unknowable, but because its grasp\nmust be limited if it is to act with precision.\nKnowledge of the future is certainly hard to reconcile with the\ntheory that memory depends on enduring traces in the physical\nstructure of the brain (p. 91 of Foreknowledge). There is, however,\nat least a strong case for the rival theory that it depends on records\nin what Professor McDougall calls \" psychical structure \". We know\nso little of the scope of such a structure that it would be rash to\nexclude the possibility that it is in contact with a wider \" specious\npresent \" than our limited physical senses are able to span.\nMay it not be, then, that at some level, subconscious or super-\nconscious, of our being, we all live, though we are seldom aware of\nit, in a world where we are \" not blinded by our eyes \"?\nGrace M. Bishop\nA PERSONAL EXPERIENCE\nThe following record was sent to us by Mrs Charlotte Bacon, a\nMember of the Society and the author of Infinite Traveller, reviewed\nin Part 162 of Proceedings ; the experience described being that of\na friend, a former Associate of the Society, who is clearly accustomed\nto accuracy of statement. It may have come in the form of a\nhypnagogic vision of peculiar intensity, which could be classed\n\f60 Joumal of Society for Psychical Research April-May 1941\nwith those described in Mrs Leaning's extensive paper on hypna-\ngogic visions in Proceedings, Vol. XXXV. The experience, however,\nis beyond the usual range of such visions both in its powerful\nemotional content and in its impression of brilliance and colouring\noutside the ordinary visual scope and not to be adequately described\nin words. The impression of light in the room mentioned inde-\npendently by the experient's husband could suggest that the vision\nhad some objective character, unless we suppose this impression to\nhave been of telepathic origin.\nMrs Bacon wrote as follows :\nI enclose an account of a \" Vision \" sent to me by the \" Seer \",\nan intimate friend\u2014the Roberta Williams mentioned in my Acknow-\nledgments in Infinite Traveller. In regard to Mrs Williams' quali-\nfications as a witness I may say that she was a \" Clough \" scholar\nat Newnham, where she took the Mathematical Tripos, and is a\nkeen student of modern psychology. It is with her consent that\nI send this account to you.\n\" Early in January 1941 I received very bad news which was a\ngreat shock to me. My agony of mind was such that it was quite\nimpossible for me to sleep. I lay wide awake staring towards the\nwindow which was of course completely blacked out.\n\" Suddenly to my utter astonishment I saw what looked like a\nragged curtain\u2014with holes in it, and through these rents and holes\nshone brilliant stars. As I watched, the curtain split right down\nand revealed shapes and forms of the most marvellous colours\nimaginable bathed in a living and dazzling light which lighted up\nthe whole room. These forms seemed to have an objective quality\nentirely different from the colours I have sometimes seen when\nsitting in the dark. I was so amazed and startled that I just lay\nstaring at the beauty of the scene revealed to my awed gaze and\nit was some minutes before I began to wonder what its significance\nmight be. I then tested it by shutting and opening my eyes several\ntimes ; but each time that I looked it was still there. I then turned\nover in bed and looked at the other side of the room to see if the\nvision followed my eyes, but it did not move, and when I looked\nagain towards the window it was still in the same place. I cannot\nsay how long it stayed, but I do know that it brought with it an inde-\nscribable feeling of awe and reassurance and deepest thankfulness.\n\" I slept but little during the night, and in the morning my\nhusband who was sleeping in the same room said to me, \" Why\ndid you light up the room in the night? \" 1\nI answered that I had\n1\nMr Williams confirms this in a letter to the Editor.\n\fApeil-May 1941 Correspondence 01\nnot done so and he replied, \" Well! When I woke up, once, in the\nnight, the room was full of light.'\n\" At breakfast I asked one of my daughters, who is an eye\nspecialist, whether the shock or any physical condition of my eyes\ncould account for what I saw. She asked me whether, when I moved\nmy eyes, the stars and colours moved with them, and my answer\nwas '\nNo '.\n'In that case ', she said, '\nthere is no physical explana-\ntion that I know of.'\n\"\nM. R. Williams\n(nee M. Roberta Atherton)\nFurther details given in answer to my questions. C. B.\n1. \" There are heavy lined curtains to the windows of my bed-\nroom and behind them are black-out curtains stretched tightly\nagainst the windows.\"\n2. \" The '\nshapes and forms '\nwere certainly not human and not\nof any mathematical or even describable form\u2014more like cloud-\nforms, but, in substance not in the least like clouds because they\nwere not nebulous, more like pieces of colour with defined but soft\nedges. . . . The brilliant light coming from behind them illuminated\nall their marvellous colours.\"\n3. \" The shapes of these pieces did not remain constant but they\ndid not meet or merge.\"\n4. \"I cannot say that every colour in the spectrum was there,\nindeed they none of them seemed like colours in the spectrum\nbecause they were so much more brilliant. The wonder and glory\nof these colours and their living light was something quite new in\nmy experience.\"\nCORRESPONDENCE\nHYPERAESTHESIA ?\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014I have read Mrs Salter's interesting article in the Journal\nfor March 1941 on experiments with Dr Gilbert Murray. I have\noften read about hyperesthesia in this connection. But what is\nreally meant by this expression ? And have we any positive evidence\npointing to such a supposed faculty intervening in telepathic tests ?\nOf course some people can hear better than others. Let us, for\nsimplicity, take only those in their prime (not deaf from age) and\n\f62 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April-May 1941\nexclude also those suffering from recognisable diseases of the ear.\nThen if we test the minimum intensity audible of say a tuning-fork\nof suitable pitch we shall get a frequency curve of this kind :\nAcuity of hearing.\nThe highest ordinate of the curve represents the comparative size\nof the largest group of people, and the corresponding abscissa repre-\nsents the acuity of hearing on a suitable scale. How are we to dis-\ntinguish on such a curve the group who possess hyperaesthesia ? If\nonly the part of the curve shown as a continuous line is found in\nreality, then the only meaning that can be assigned is that hyper-\naesthesia is hearing somewhat better than in the ordinary.\nIf, on the other hand, the curve were found to include the dotted\nportion, there would be some ground for saying that a group of\npersons exists quite distinct from the ordinary who can hear much\nfainter sounds, and, in fact, can exercise hyperaesthesia\u2014hyper-\naesthetes I may call them.\nAural surgeons commonly make tests of hearing with a tuning-\nfork. I wonder if they have ever encountered anything of the\nkind? I doubt it. And without such evidence, hyperaesthesia has\nreally no definite meaning.\nIn my experiments on seeing fight near a magnet, I tried to\ninvestigate this question for sight, and failed to find any indication\nthat there are visual \" hyperaesthetes \".\nThe matter cannot be carried further without statistics as to\nwhat people actually can hear. But, to express it roughly, it would\nprobably be found that most young people (twenty-five, say) have\nabout the same power of hearing, and that the idea of people who\ncan do wonderful feats in that way is a myth.\nYours, etc.,\nRayleigh\nParanormal Cognition\nSir,\u2014I really do not understand why experimenters in Para-\npsychology should be suspected of deliberately faking their results\nany more than investigators in the field of normal Psychology. The\n\fApril-May 1941 Correspondence 63\nsuggestion that serious students of Psychical Kesearch are probably\neither frauds or fools or both is a gratuitous insult to our subject\nand should be disregarded by every honest investigator.\nIf one is engaged in experiments in Extra-Sensory Perception\nwhere there are often unsuspected sources of error it is one's bounden\nduty to call upon the assistance of other competent investigators\n\u2014\nnot, indeed, as a test of one's own veracity\u2014but on the principle\nthat two or three heads and pairs of eyes are better than one. By\nlaying open one's experiments to the inspection of colleagues, sources\nof error and faults in technique may come to light which would\notherwise have been passed over. It is also advisable to have helpers\nto assist in the checking-up of results so as to avoid errors. But it\nis another matter to suggest that Mr Carington ought to have called\nin witnesses to testify that he exhibited a \" hawk on Tuesday night\nand not a handsaw \". This is merely ludicrous. What Mr Bester-\nman and others fail to realize is that men of science are, as a rule,\nnot in the least interested in the methods of the Law Courts. They\ninfinitely prefer to read accounts of experiments which can be re-\npeated indefinitely and at their leisure.\nThis demand for witnesses and ever more witnesses comes, I\nnotice, almost always from laymen who are obsessed with the\nerroneous idea that science progresses by imitating the methods of\nthe examining counsel. Scientific workers seldom question the per-\nsonal honesty of their colleagues, but confine themselves to criticism\nof the techniques employed and the precautions taken in order to\navoid error. Mr Carington is trying to devise, with I understand\nconsiderable success, a repeatable experiment. If, as we hope and\nbelieve will be the case, Mr Carington's results are obtained by\nindependent workers in a score of laboratories, such criticisms as\nthose of Mr Besterman will count for nothing.\nIn a previous letter I touched on the advisability of safeguards\nagainst irresponsible criticism, but after reading Mr Carington's\nadmirable defence I agree that it is probably wiser to ignore such\nirrelevancies.\nI am, Sir, yours faithfully,\nS. G. Soal\n(This discussion is now closed. It has served to draw a clearer\nline between safeguards against experimental error and against mal-\npractice. On the point which Mr Soal makes, that scientists are not\ninterested in evidence other than the verifiable facts themselves, the\nposition has also been lucidly defined by Professor Bergson in his\nPresidential Address, Proc. LXVII, pp. 464, 466.

If any others feel that\nthey could undertake this sort of work, I hope they will let me\nknow, for I need as many experiments of this type as I can possibly\ncollect.\nEven more pressing, however, is my need for a few independent\nscorers, and I should be most grateful if any member who is willing\nto co-operate in this way would communicate with me. The amount\nof work involved would in no case be heavy, and could be done\nat any time convenient to the scorer\u2014the important thing is that it\nshould be done by someone other than myself.\nI am, Sir, etc.,\nWhately Carington\nOmmen\nSennen Cove\nCornwall.\nREVIEWS\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. 4, No. 2, December 1940.\nThe Editors make the welcome announcement that the Journal\nwill be published quarterly during 1941, thanks to the generosity\nof three anonymous contributors. The first, and chief, article is a\npaper on \" Studies in Extra-Sensory Perception. A Review of all\nUniversity of Colorado Experiments \" by Martin and Stribic. This\nis a highly important contribution to the literature of the subject ;\nit reports full details of four series of experiments, comprising 12,470\nruns and extending over a period of three years. Three, out of these\nfour, gave significant results. Control series were obtained by\nreverse matching and these showed a Critical Ratio (C.R.) of 1-00,\nor exactly chance scoring. Precautions, such as screening, were\ntaken to eliminate sensory clues, and the \" Down Through \" tech-\nnique was utilised throughout, with the exception of certain varia-\ntions, in particular with one subject who had shown high scoring\nability with whom the \" Up Through \" method was also used.\nAdequate supervision of the experiments was provided and great\ncare exercised in checking records for \" recording error \". Full\ndetails are given in a very large number of tables showing, among\nother things, comparison with predictions on the binomial hypo-\nthesis, hit frequencies in respect of card position, daily fluctuations\nin scoring, etc. There are also many graphs. In regard to these\n\fApril-May 1941 Reviews 65\nlatter, it is a pity that the lettering is so small : I was unable to read\nit without the aid of a magnifying glass.\nOther interesting experimental variations were tried besides the\nUp Through technique referred to above, such as laying out all\n25 cards in a row, properly screened of course, and the subject\nreading from left to right and vice versa. This is called \" Equal\nExposure \" or E.E. : laying out ten packs in a row behind the\nscreen and then placing one in a central position, which pack was\nto be the E.S.P. target : delaying knowledge of the score, etc.\nThese variations are of great importance and further experimenta-\ntion with them and others of a similar nature might profitably be\nundertaken. The results tend to show that the subject has some\npower of directing his E.S.P. faculty to a particular target out of\nseveral, e.g. as in reading Up Through instead of Down Through.\nThe whole paper merits a most careful study by those who are\nseriously interested in the research, not only on account of the high\nsignificance of some of the results, but, more particularly, because\nof the wealth of detail published.\nThe other report of experimental work is a paper on \" Variation\nof Time Interval in Pre-Shuffle Card-Calling Tests \" by Lois Hutchin-\n\u2022son. The object of this research was to obtain precognitive know-\nledge of card position and to contrast results obtained for intervals\nof one day and ten days. In the first series subjects were not told\ntheir scores until twenty days after the experiment began, in the\nsecond they were told daily after checking. Sensory clues were, of\ncourse, excluded by the nature of the experiment. As regards\nrecords, exceptional care was taken.\nThe first series yielded results of no significance for either the\none-day or ten-day intervals ; in the second, though the ten-day\ngroup showed no significance, the one-day group gave a OR. of\n3-11 and the difference between the two groups a OR. of 3-21.\nThe paper ends with an adequate discussion and a statement of\ntentative conclusions.\nThe remaining papers deal mainly with the statistical side of\nE.S.P. research. In an article by Dr Feller criticisms are raised on\nthree main grounds, viz. Shuffling, Selection and Optional Stopping.\nThese are answered by Greenwood and Stuart. Though some of\nthe arguments require technical knowledge for full understanding,\nthere is much in these two articles which can be appreciated by\nnon-mathematical readers. Foster deals with \" A Perception Ratio\nStatistic for E.S.P. Tests \" and \" To E.S.P. Diametric \" in two short\narticles. Dr Ellson criticises Pratt's use of Chapman's Statistics\nand this criticism is answered by Pratt.\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research April-May 1941\nThe number closes with some short extracts from the comments\nmade by the Board of Review, a novel and extremely useful feature\nwhich might with advantage be continued and possibly expanded.\nH. F. S.\nWidening Horizons. By Baron Erik Palmstierna. John Lane.\n9s. 6d. net.\nThis is a book of edification rather than of research, and deals\nchiefly with unverifiable pronouncements which must be weighed\nby individual opinions as to their merits. The records that are\npresented consist largely in questions put to Mrs Fachiri's controls\nand their replies and subsequent reflections upon the problems that\nare raised. Baron Palmstierna .renews the claim that \" the sub-\nconscious mind \" can have little or no part in the productions of\nthis mediumship, and it is a relevant fact that the messages them-\nselves can definitely contradict accepted views of subliminal action :\nfor instance, a question is put on the view that \" some dreams\nare the result of repressions and conflicts in the individual \". The\nimmediate reply is, \" That is nonsense \" ; dreams are reminiscent\nof nocturnal journeyings out of the body, \" or recollections from\nyour spirit life \". This persistent discounting of subliminal activity,\nmay have its pitfalls for readers who are new to the difficulties of\nautomatism and inclined to believe that it opens up a royal road,\nan unquestionably clear channel of authentic communication. Such\nan idea has too often led to painful disillusionments. Another ques-\ntion that needs thought is that of the adequacy of the language of\nautomatism to express what may be the inspiration of the message.\nTo take a recurrent example, the modus operandi of spiritual forces\ninterpenetrating the material world is continually explained in these\nmessages by reference to \" waves \", and the use of the term is so\nfrequent and facile that it conveys little meaning. We even find\nthat lifeless matter is described as being surrounded by stationary\nwaves, a conception of which it is not easy to make sense. On the\nwhole, the messages have less effect of conveying hints of significant\ntruth than those in Horizons of Immortality, and at times seem to\ndescend to an unsatisfying glibness, but there remains an interesting\nquality about them, and at their best they often give food for\nthought.

Pp. 214. $2.00 net.\nThe word Psychology is to-day used in such an elastic way\n\u2014\nat one moment to denote the laboratory work of graphs and measure-\n\fApril-May 19-11 Reviews 67\nmerits, at another the living, empirical, hit-or-miss procedure of\nthe psycho-analytic consulting-room, that the reader may wonder\nwhich aspect of this myriad-sided subject will be under discussion.\nPmt the author uses the word in the sense in which it is defined in\nthe Oxford Dictionary\u2014'\"'\nThe science of the nature, functions, and\nphenomena of the human soul or mind \"\n\u2014and the book should prove\nto be, both for psychical researchers and the intelligent public, a\nstimulating picture of the many unexplained and puzzling facts\nwhich still have to be explored and proved before they can be\nassimilated into the body of scientific and philosophic thought.\nMr Carrington's aim throughout is to plead the great importance\nof psychical research, and to show how revolutionary must be the\nchange in all our philosophic conceptions once the strange facts of\npsychical phenomena are so well proven and established that they\ncan no longer be ignored. This plea has of course been as it were\nthe theme-song of researchers ever since the Psychical Research\nSociety was founded, but the author has summarised the subject\nin such a comprehensive and readable way that one is struck afresh\nboth by its strangeness and its far-reaching import.\nThe book is divided conveniently into four parts. Introduction ;\nPsychology in the Light of Psychic Phenomena ; Some Sittings with\nMrs Piper ; On the Mechanism of the Acquisition of Supernormal\nKnowledge, and an Appendix, Some problems of Philosophy in the\nLight of Psychic Research. There is a short index of names.\nIn the first part the author shows that the main obstacle to the\nacceptance of the facts of psychic research is the mechanistic view\nthat brain -and mind are inseparably connected, and that neither\ncan live or function without the other. Opposition hinges almost\nentirely on this fundamental concept. He admits, naturally, that\nthe actuality of supernormal phenomena must be further established,\nand he analyses, briefly, their various forms. His headings include\nOriental psychology, the mind-body problem, dreams, multiple per-\nsonality, obsession, hypnotism, apparitions, the psychology of com-\nmunication\u2014these are only a few of the subjects touched upon.\nTo illustrate communication, which the author considers \" the\nfinal problem, the most crucial and the most important of them all \",\nsome sittings with Mrs Piper are given, which are representative of\ntrance sittings and illustrate the strange sequence of events, the\nveridical knowledge\u2014also the mistakes and puzzles with which\nresearchers are familiar. There are some letters from Mr George\nDorr discussing these sittings, but the general discussion as to the\nconflicting theories of telepathy, clairvoyance, etc., is left till the\nnext section on The Mechanism of the Acquisition of Supernormal\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Apml-May 1941\nKnowledge. Here the subconscious mind is discussed, and the\nauthor considers that the conception of the unconscious must be\nmade to include supernormal phenomena. He sketches a scheme,\nillustrated by a diagram, of our unconscious mind, and suggests that\nwe may also have to admit the existence of a superconscious function,\nand refers to Mrs Lyttelton's book, Our Superconscious Mind, in\ncorroboration of this. Another diagram suggests the various\nchannels by which knowledge from the subconscious mind finds its\navenues of expression. Such diagrams are admittedly arbitrary\nand personal, but serve again to remind the reader of the vastness\nand variety of the subject. Some interesting introspections are\nquoted from well-known mediums\u2014Mrs Osborne Leonard, Mrs Helen\nHughes, Mrs Edith M. Thomson and others, including Miss Goodrich-\nFreer ; there is a case-history of some striking telepathic or clair-\nvoyant experiences and the subject's theories as to the modus\noperandi\u2014theories which may represent to some extent those held\nby the author. He quotes an introspection by Mrs Carrington made\nafter her experiences with ether administered for an operation, and\nends by making a plea for correlating both psychical and mystical\nexperiences as a basis for the coming science.\nIn the fourth section the author touches on the leading concep-\ntions of philosophic thought with regard to mind, brain, and con-\nsciousness, the outer and the inner world, and their relationship.\nHe deduces from this review the reality of the inner world, and again\npoints out the main difficulties in forming an idea of this relation-\nship.\nThe author might perhaps have emphasised the fact that good\nprogress has been made of late in the knowledge of human per-\nsonality and the unconscious mind, owing to the experiences of\npsycho-analysis ; he might perhaps have ventured a prophecy as\nto the great importance of the new statistical approach shown in\nthe work of Mr Whately Carington, Mr Soal, and Dr Rhine, but\nwith his last sentence and final conclusion few psychic researchers\nwill disagree, that \" Psychic science ... is doubtless destined to rule\nand dominate the whole world of thought, and to influence the belief\nof humanity as to its ultimate destiny and the meaning of life \".\nIxa Jephson\n\fNo. 576-577\u2014Vol. XXXII June-July 1941\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research\nThe Rooms of the Society will be closed after Thursday, 31 July,\nuntil Monday, 15 September.

We now\nlearn the still more welcome news that the Boston Society for\nPsychic Research has been amalgamated with the American Society,\nand that the two Societies will henceforth function under the name\nof the American Society for Psychical Research, with headquarters\nat 40 East 34th Street, New York City.\nMrs Allison writes as follows: \" At a meeting in January 1941.\nDr George H. Hyslop, son of Dr James H. Hyslop, was elected\n\f70 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nPresident of the American Society, to the gratification of everyone\ninterested in serious psychical research. At the same meeting Dr\nGardner Murphy, who has been on the Council of the Boston Society\nsince its formation in 1925, was elected a trustee of the American\nSociety, and appointed chairman of the Research Committee. A\ngeneral reorganization followed.\n\" The Council of the Boston Society and the Board of Trustees of\nthe American Society, after careful consideration, decided that an\namalgamation at this time would be advantageous to all concerned.\nAs conditions in Europe have naturally limited the distinguished\nwork that has been carried on there, it appeared self-evident that\nunited effort in this country was necessary.\n\" The amalgamation was therefore effected as of May 1, 1941 and\nthe two societies will now function as one society under the name of\nthe American Society for Psychical Research.\n\" Besides Dr Murphy, three members of the Council of the Boston\nSociety have been elected as trustees of the American Society.\nThey are : Mr H. Addington Bruce, Mr Waldemar Kaempffert and\nMrs Edward Wood Allison.\n\" The membership of the Boston Society is about equally divided\nbetween residents of Boston and its vicinity and those living in other\nparts of the country. Plans are under way to form a group to carry\non activities in Boston. Mr Bruce will be the chairman and Dr\nMurphy and Mrs Allison will represent the interests of the Boston\nGroup in New York.\n\" The library of the Boston Society remains in Boston. It has been\ndeposited at the Boston Medical Library, 8 Fenway, where the books\nwill be at the disposal of members.\n\" Plans are under way to establish a Hyslop-Prince annual Fellow-\nship, the purpose of which is two-fold : to furnish an opportunity for\ncarefully selected university students to familiarize themselves with\nthe great traditions of psychical research and its important literature;\nand also to enable them to carry out original research projects under\nproper supervision. This fills a long-felt need, as nothing seems more\nimportant than attracting young people to the work in order to safe-\nguard its future.\n\" The members of the Society will in the future receive regular pub-\nlications.

Their previous results, which\nhad shown no significance in respect of the card at which their guess\nwas aimed, were among those re-examined for an effect which Mr\nCarington had detected in his research into the paranormal cognition\nof drawings : a tendency to score beyond chance probability, not\nupon the picture aimed at, but upon the picture immediately pre-\nceding or following it. In the case of these two percipients this\neffect was also discovered by Mr Soal ; and he has lately been con-\nducting further intensive experiments with one of the percipients,\nMr B. S., whose faculty shows special points of interest.\nCertain results of this work, which is still in progress, seem\nsufficiently definite and assured to be recorded in the Journal. The\nnotes printed below are reports which I sent to Mr Soal and Professor\nBroad after acting as observer of the experiments upon two occasions,\nand appear in this form by Mr Soal's permission. They thus repre-\nsent the personal impressions and current comments of one eye-\nwitness.\nTo give, first, some idea of the experimental method used by Mr\nSoal and of the conditions obtaining, in so far as these will not be\nexplained in the notes which follow : the experimenter's table is\nplaced in one room, Mr B. S's studio, and Mr B. S., the percipient,\nsits in an adjoining room with the door closed between the two\nrooms. On one side of the table sits the agent, Miss Elliott. 1\nIn\nfront of her five picture cards, previously shuffled, are laid face\ndownwards. The pictures are of five different animals, and the aim\nof the percipient in the other room is to obtain a correct impression\n(visual or other) by which he can rapidly note down which of the\nfive animal cards is being picked up and looked at by the agent at\nany given moment. He makes his notes upon a prepared score-\nsheet by writing down initial letters for the animals\u2014E for elephant,\nG for giraffe, and so on. The effect thus aimed at is presumably\ntelepathic ; when it is desired to make a test for clairvoyant effects,\nthe agent does not look at the faces of the cards as they are selected.\n(This is not a rigorous test to exclude telepathy, since after some use\nthe backs of the cards may become distinguishable by slight effects\n1\nExcept on one or two occasions it has not been found possible to obtain\nsuccessful results with persons other than Miss Elliott acting as agent.\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nof wear : but it has been found in practice that no significant results\nare obtained when the agent does not look at the faces of the cards.)\nSelection of the cards is effected as follows. The agent's half of\nthe table is divided from the other half by a screen of plywood, in\nwhich is a rectangular aperture so placed that the agent cannot see\nthrough it what manipulations are carried out on the other side.\nHere the experimenter has five cards numbered 1 to 5, and a pre-\nviously prepared list of numbers from 1 to 5 in random sequence.\nAs he comes to each number in the list he takes up the corresponding\nnumbered card and holds it up to the aperture. (At this moment\nhe shouts \" Next! \" to the percipient in the other room, as a signal\nfor him to record his next impression ;\nhaving done so, the per-\ncipient shouts \" Right! \" as a signal for the next card to be selected.)\nOn seeing the number in the aperture, the agent selects the 1st, 2nd,\n3rd, 4th or 5th card of the row lying face downwards before her,\ncounting from left to right.\nBy this method selections were made and signalled at a rate of\nabout one every two seconds. To make tests with a series that\nshould not be predetermined, and also when a more rapid process of\nselection and calling was required, the list of numbers and the\nnumbered cards were replaced by a bag or bowl containing a quan-\ntity of oounters of five different colours, each colour being taken to\nrepresent one of the numbers from 1 to 5. The experimenter then\nmade random selection, by touch, of a succession of single counters\nand held them in turn up to the aperture, the agent proceeding as\nbefore, but having the different mental process to carry out of\nselecting a card according to the agreed meaning of the colour\npresented. By this method calls of \" Next \" were made at intervals\nof roughly 1 second, the answering call of \" Right \" from the per-\ncipient in the next room being eliminated.\nI have recorded in my notes that I was able to observe no means\nby which relevant sensory clues could pass between the experimenter\nand the agent. On the occasions when I was witness of the procedure\nat the experimenter's table I myself shuffled the cards before each\nexperiment, out of sight of the experimenter, who thus had no\nopportunity, until the experiment was ended, of knowing in what\norder they were placed before the agent.\nWhat follows is the substance of my two reports. It will be\nrealised that points of comment and criticism which arise were\nnoted as a matter of co-operation with Mr Soal, who was in process\nof devising as watertight a technique as possible to suit the partic-\nular circumstances in which the work was carried out. I may remark\nalso that it was my business as an investigator to see whether any\n\fJune-July 1941 Paranormal Cognition 73\nmethod was physically possible by which Mr B. S. might be obtain-\ning sensory clues: I did not and do not consider that there was any\npsychological Likelihood of his wishing or attempting to do so.\n28 Feb. 41, 4.30\u20146.30 p.m.\nExperimenter, Mr Soal. Agent, Miss EUiott. Percipient, Mr B. S.\nSubject of test, 5 cards depicting animals, in random sequence.\nConditions of Experiment\nThe experimenter's table was at one corner of a large, windowless,\nbasement studio. Three entrances to this studio were in use,\nopening through the walls remote from this corner :\n(1) Entrance, closed by a door during the experiments, to the\nroom in which Mr B. S. sat to record his impressions.\n(2) Entrance to another room which communicated by an open\ndoorway with the room in which Mr B. S. sat. During the 4 occa-\nsions on which I sat with Mr B. S. while he filled in a record sheet\n(of 50 guesses each time), there were 2 occasions when a young lady,\nprobably a business assistant of Mr. B. S., was visible through the\nopen communicating doorway. Mr B. S. did not look up at her from\nhis record sheet, and on both occasions fidgetted and paused as\nthough distracted by the sound of her movements. The circum-\nstance suggested no suspicion to me, but it might be well to ehminate\nany conceivable communication, during experiments, between Mr\nB. S. and members of his staff who have access to the studio\u2014al-\nthough I can imagine no way in which relevant information could\nthus be conveyed to Mr B. S. Nothing could be seen from entrance\n(2) of the cards on the agent's side of the table : the screen was in\nthe way. Standing at entrance (2) with a view of the table, one\ncould not see or be seen by Mr. B. S. where he was sitting.\n(3) Entrance to photographic workroom into which Mr B. S.\nwent, at intervals between experiments, to attend to prints which\nwere undergoing a glazing process. I followed him into this room two\nor three times and saw nothing to suggest the use of any optical\nor photographic device relevant to the experiments, supposing that\nany such device could be of use.\nConsidering that Mr B. S., as a professional photographer, would\nhave knowledge and equipment suitable for the arrangement of\nsome device for obtaining a clandestine view of the experimenter's\ntable, I looked carefully for anything suspicious on these lines, and\nobserved nothing. I do not, in any case, see how any such device\ncould achieve the precognitive results which were the only positive\nones obtained during my visit.\nI may note, here, that while sitting with Mr B. S. I observed that in\n\f74 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nrecording his impressions, by filling in the initial letters for animals\nupon the record sheets before him, he placed these initial letters in\ncorrect succession so as to correspond on the sheets with the random\nseries used at the experimenter's table. In particular, the initials\nwere not displaced so as to give a subsequent impression of a pre-\ncognitive effect which had not in fact occurred. The conditions\nwould not preclude this in experiments during which the percipient\nsits alone, though no fallacious positive precognitive effect would\nresult unless he were obtaining either correct paranormal impres-\nsions or sensory clues with regard to the cards selected at the\nexperimenter's table.\nNotes on the Course of the Experiments\nIt will be convenient to describe as one experiment the making\nand recording of a sequence of 50 guesses, this being the number\nrecorded on one record-sheet, and there being more or less of a break\nbetween one sequence of 50 and the next. 8 sheets were filled in\nduring my visit.\nMr Soal calls \" Next \", loud enough to be heard in the room\nwhere Mr B. S. sits, at the moment when he presents a numbered\ncard at the partition window, thus indicating to Miss Elliott which\nof the 5 cards to pick up. Mr B. S. calls \" Right \" when he has\nrecorded his guess. Occasionally the call of \" Right \" preceded the\ncall of '\"\nNext \" or was practically simultaneous with it. When\nsitting with Mr B. S. I observed that on a number of occasions (see\nbelow) he wrote down the initial letter on his record-sheet about\n1 sec. by stop-watch before Mr Soal's \" Next \" was heard, but waited\nto call \" Right \" until he heard Mr Soal's call. When he called\n\" Right \" before hearing the call of \" Next \" he appeared to do so\nautomatically on completion of the act of writing down the initial,\nand as though under some pressure from the urgency of the impres-\nsion received. It might be of interest to have some record-sheets\nfilled in by witnesses sitting with Mr B. S., for the purpose of noting\nthe occasions when (a) his writing down of the initial, and (6) his\ncall of \" Right \", precedes Mr Soal's call of \" Next \", so that the\ncorrectness of these guesses may be compared with that of guesses\nwhich do not run ahead of Mr Soal's call of \" Next \", These\n\" advanced \" guesses, also, might be correlated with cards two in\nadvance of the selected card.\nWhen, as frequently happens, the sequence of calls, \" Next \"\n\u2014\n\" Right \"\u2014\" Next \"\u2014\" Right \", falls into an even rhythm, the\ninterval between one \" Next \" and the following one varies only\nbetween T8 and 2-2 sees. In the two longest periods of this regular\n\fJune-July 1941 Paranormal Cognition 75\nrhythm which I observed, there was one in which Mr B. S. was\ncomfortably writing down the initials at or immediately after the\nmoment of Mr Soal's call, and himself calling \" Right \" about 1 sec.\nlater than the call (7th exjoeriment) ; and one in which he was\nwriting down the initials regularly before Mr Soal's call, and himself\ncalling \" Right \" almost at the moment of Mr Soal's call (5th\nexperiment). In the latter case he showed signs of mental dis-\ncomfort after (not during) the completion of the record-sheet, and\ndid not think he had done well : actually, he had 11 correct pre-\ncognitive guesses in the first 25 on this sheet, but dropped to 3 pre-\ncognitive in the second 25.\nI should say that Mr B. S's impressions \" want \" to over-run the\nrate at which Mr Soal's calls can be made ; that this speeding-up\npressure is uncomfortable, and that he tries to keep clown to an easy\nrhythm corresponding to that of Mr Soal's calling ; but he remarked\nto me, \" If I get it I must put it down \", and he seems often to be\ndriven by this urgency to an acceleration which may or may not\nsettle down again into a rhythmic series of recordings ahead of Mr\nSoal's calling.\nBefore the 5th experiment he asked for slower calling on Mr Soal's\npart, but during the experiment asked for more speed. I should say\nthat the attempt to get down to a slower rhythm had the reverse effect\nfrom his intention : his impressions ran ahead of Mr Soal's calling,\ngiving positive precognitive results in the first half of the experiment ,\nbut a low precognitive score in the second half, when, presumably,\nhis acceleration had to be checked from racing further ahead.\nI should be inclined to try the experiment of following Mr B. S's\nacceleration, when it occurs, up to the maximum rate at which he is\nable to fill in the initial letters on his record-sheet, postponing the\nprocess of card-selection at the table meanwhile : i.e., to leave the\ncards alone and continue to call \" Next \" more and more closely\nto the moment at which Mr B. S. calls \" Right \", until the end of\nthat record-sheet is reached, and then to see (from the list of pre-\nselected numbers) if any result has been produced comparable to\nthe results of \" down-through \" calling in Rhine's experiments.\nNotes during Individual Experiments :\nExpt. 1. (K. R. at experimenter's table.) One \" Right \" heard\nat the moment when the number-card was presented at partition\nwindow ; one about -2 sec. before. Other calls of \" Right\n\"\nfollowed after the presentation of number-cards but preceded\nor coincided with the agent's turning-up of the picture card\n(Score not significant.)\n\f76 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nExpt. 2. (K. R. at experimenter's table.) In no instance in this\nseries did the \" Right \" precede the turning-up of the picture\ncard. (Precognitive score 18\/48.)\nExpt. 3. (K. R. at experimenter's table.) One \" Right \" (the\nfirst) came about -2 sec. before, one other simultaneously with,\nthe turning-up of the picture card ; the rest were subsequent.\n(Precognitive score 16\/48.)\nExpt. 4. (K. R. sitting with Mr B. S.) In 17 instances (distribu-\ntion of these not noted) the initial was written down, or had\nbegun to be written, when Mr Soaks \" Next \" was heard.\nMr B. S. remarked after finishing the sheet, \" If I get it I must\nput it down \". (Clairvoyance expt. : no positive result.)\nExpt. 5. (K. R. sitting with Mr B. S.) 34 of the initials were\nwritten down, or in process of being (rapidly) written, when\nMr Soal's \" Next \" was heard. 25 of these 34 were in sequence,\nroughly Nos. 20 to 45.\nMr. B. S. said afterwards that this expt. \" did not feel good \",\nand was slightly agitated and restless. (The count showed 11\nprecognitive hits in the first 25, 3 in the second). My impression\nwas that his slight nervous distress came not from the fact of\nspeeding up, but from trying to impose the necessary check\nupon acceleration. His hand holding the pencil twitched after\nwriting down an initial as though impatient to go on at once to\nthe next.\nExpt. 6. (K.R. at experimenter's table.) Mr B. S.'s call of\n\" Right \" came regularly about 1 sec. after Mr Soal's \" Next \".\n(Precognitive score 21\/48.)\nExpt. 7. (K. R. sitting with Mr B. S.) Mr B. S. wrote down all\nthe initials either at (2 or 3 times), or immediately after Mr\nSoal's call, the rhythm seeming easy and comfortable. At the\nend he remarked, \" That should be rather good \". (Clairvoy-\nance expt. : no positive result.)\nExpt. 8. (K. R. sitting with Mr B. S.) Course of events very\nsimilar to that in Expt 7. Subsequent comments by Mr B. S. :\n\" That felt quite good \", and\u2014indicating the 2nd column of\n25 guesses\n\u2014\" Quite likely you'll get more on the actual card\nin this lot.\" In fact, 6 were correct out of these 25, on the actual\ncard : the total precognitive score was 20\/48.\nIf these few observations on the relation between percipient's\nexpectation and actual result are typical, it looks as though Mr B.\nS's impressions of success have not much relation to fact, and they\nmay represent a \" referred \"feeling which actually arises from success\n\fJune-July 1941 Paranormal Cognition 77\nin arriving at a comfortable rhythm. It is possible that this easy\nrhythm\u2014a successful adaptation to the exterior tuning conditions\ndetermined by the rate at which cards can be selected and presented\nat the experimenter's table\u2014could be made habitual only at the\nexpense of the successful registration of paranormal impacts (or\nparanormal prehensions). On the other hand, an easy, rhythmic\nprocedure seems at times to go with significant scoring, and if this\nis so it should be worth while to try to maintain the conditions in\nwhich this happy conjunction occurs. The tension and discomfort\nconnected with Expt. 5 may represent the emergence into con-\nsciousness of a kind of stress which is part of the process of successful\nscoring, but too much stress probably fatigues the faculties involved\nand operates against further success, whereas the combination of\ngood scoring with an easy rhythm would favour long sequences of\nsuccess. Mr B. S., however, is of a type that gets results in general\nthrough tensions and nervous cross-currents, and it may be that\nrelaxion and smoothness of rhythm would not be greatly conducive\nto success in his particular case. But some study of the rhythms\ninvolved, and tentative experiment concerning them, might be\nenlightening. Of course, the more data we can have established\nabout the timing that occurs in these rapid precognitive phenomena,\nthe better we shall understand the conditions required for their\nproduction.\nExperiments conducted on 21 Mar. 41, 5 to 7 p.m.\nThe conditions of experiment resembled those noted in my first\nreport, with the following exceptions :\nSelection of cards at the experimenter's table was not by pre-\ndetermined random series of the numbers 1 to 5, but by undeter-\nmined random series obtained by the use of counters of 5 different\ncolours. Selection of the counters by touch was carried out by Mrs\nGoldney, who also gave the call of \" Next \" to Mr B. S. in the next\nroom.\nOn the agent's side of the table Miss Elliott had the 5 cards\nfurther screened from any possible observation by a box with its\nopening towards herself.\nAll three entrances into the studio, and also those into the room\nwhere Mr B. S. sat, were closed during the experiments, when only\nMr Soal, Mrs Goldney and Miss Elliott were present in the studio.\nMr B. S. did not enter the photographic workroom between exjjeri-\nments.\nDuring the 1st experiment (3 sheets of 50 guesses each) a lady\nassistant of Mr B. S. was working at a photographic retouching table\n\f78 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nin the room where he sat. She finished her work and left before the\nfollowing experiments. I observed no communication between her\nand Mr B. S., and satisfied myself that the retouching table was\ninnocent of any suspicious apparatus.\nApart from the elimination of any remote possibility of signals\nbeing physically conveyed to Mr B. S., I may note that I see no\npossible means by which any such signals could be of the least use\nfor producing the precognitive phenomena observed. On this\noccasion I sat with Mr B. S. throughout the series of experiments and\nnoted that, as before, he wrote down the initial letters on his record\nsheets in the proper spaces to correspond in numerical order with\nthe calls heard from the next room, and could in no way have\nproduced faked precognitive results. It is obvious that even if he\nhad had a television screen before him giving a plain view of each\ncard as it was selected, he would have been no better able to note\nthe succeeding cards before they were selected. Any method of\nfraud whatever, to produce apparent precognitive effects, would\ndepend on (a) displacement of the initials on his record-sheets or\n(b) letting the writing down of the initials lag behind the calling\nfrom the next room. Neither of these things occurred, except one\nbrief period of lag which will be noted and was not associated with\nany positive result.\nIf, however, they may be thought to have occurred during any\nprevious experiments during which Mr B. S's procedure in filling in\nhis record-sheets was not watched, the present elimination of remote\npossibilities of sensory clues makes it the more unlikely that any\nsuspicion concerning previous experiments can be worth consider-\ning, since positive scores continue to be recorded under the more\nprecisely controlled conditions.\nExperiments Observed. (K. R. sitting with Mr B. S. throughout.)\nIn none of these experiments did Mr B. S's writing down of\ninitials on his record-sheets run noticeably ahead of the calls\nof \" Next \", as they did in the experiments I last observed :\nthe initials were put down at or soon after the calls\u2014in every\ncase before the following call, except at the one point to be\nnoted below.\nIn this report I will describe as one experiment the making\nand recording of a sequence of 150 guesses (3 record-sheets),\nthis being the number made at one sitting, before a break was\ntaken and the results inspected.\nExpt. 1. Interval between the calls of \" Next \" from the studio,\nabout 2 sees., Mr B. S's call of \" Right \" occurred pretty regu-\n\fJune-July 1941 Paranormal Cognition 7!)\nlarly about half-way between the calls of \" Next \" ; his writing\ndown of initials varied between virtual simultaneity of the call\nof \" Next \" with the commencement of the initial, and approxi-\nmate simultaneity of this with the call of \" Right \". Rhythm\nnotably more easy and flowing than in the expts. I observed\non 28 Feb. 41.\nSheet 1. Mr B. S. remarked on finishing it, \" that should be\nrather good \". (Precognitive score 23\/48.)\nSheet 2. Several calls of \" Next \" in the 2nd 25 were at longer\nintervals than 2 sec, one especially long with audible talk\nfrom the studio. (Precognitive score 23\/48.)\nSheet 3. More regular, but at times slightly faster calling\u2014two\ntimed intervals when speeding-up was noticeable were of 1-6\nsec. between one \" Next \" and the following one. (Precognitive\nscore 15\/48.)\nAt the end of this expt. Mr B. S. said he felt the beginnings of a\ntypical fatigue and headache which he experiences after this\nwork. He compared his feeling while completing Sheet 3 with\nthat of a bather who is getting tired after swimming some\ndistance and has lost the sense of freshness and invigoration\nfelt at the beginning of the swim. He had appeared quite easy\nduring the expt.\nExpt. 2. A change of method was introduced, Mrs Goldney, still\nusing coloured counters, calling \" Next \" at intervals (when\nthese could be kept regular) of 1-4 sec. or less while Mr B. S.\nrecorded his guesses without giving the answering call of\n\" Right \". During stretches of regular calling at this rate, Mr\nB. S. was writing down initials almost continuously, apparently\nat a comfortable speed.\nSheet 4. After completing this sheet Mr B. S. remarked that the\ncalling felt too quick for impressions to come through :\n\" the\nmind just puts things down \"\n\u2014\ni.e., apparently, only a motor\nresponse is consciously experienced.\nSeveral breaks occurred in the regularity of calling, owing to\ndifficulty of always picking up one counter at a time when\nmaking random selection rapidly and by touch alone.\nSignificant precognitive scoring on the card two ahead of the\ncard selected was found to begin with this sheet : successes\n13\/46.\nSheets 5 and 6. Much smoother calling, Mrs Goldney's fingers\napparently growing accustomed to random selection by touch.\n(-2) successes, 9\/46 and 22\/46.\nMr B. S. remarked at the end of this expt. that it was comfortable\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nwork while the rhythm was regular but that any break in the\nrhythm gave a jolt and a confused feeling.\nPrecognitive scores on the card 1 ahead of the card selected were\nfound not to be significant in this expt., and a count was made\nof scores on the card two ahead, with the results noted above.\nSuch results, it was suggested in my last report, might be found\nto occur at the then rate of calling when Mr. B. S's impressions\nwere running in advance of the calls. The more rapid method\nnow introduced seems to meet Mr B. S's tendency, as then\nobserved, to run ahead of the calling, and to correspond with his\ncomfortable maximum speed for recording impressions by the\nwriting down of initial letters, with the effect of shifting his\ntelepathic \" view \" of the card-images seen by the agent to\nthe card two in advance of that in her present-time field of\nvision. It may be that his precognitive perception has got\nused to working with a time-focus in the specious present 2\nsees, in advance of the agent's sensory \" present moment\n\"\n(2 sees, being the customary interval between presentations\nhitherto), and that this determines his selection of the image\nnearest in time to 2 sees, ahead. 1\nIt was decided that the more rapid method of calling should\nbe continued in the next expt., with a view to confirming the\napparent results of this method.\nExpt. 3. Sheet 7. Mr B. S. called \" Stop! \" half-way through the\nfirst column of 25 guesses, and then \" Right \" after a pause of\n2 or 3 sees. He explained after completing this sheet that hav-\ning looked at the coloured counters during the conversation in\nthe studio after expt. 2, he had found himself, in Sheet 7,\ngetting impressions of colours and wanting to write down the\ninitial letters of colours. He had in fact put down \" W \" for\nwhite in one place, and this was followed by a gap in his record\nof guesses. He said that he would be able to prevent this effect\nfrom occurring. Apparently the confusion caused by competing\nimages is responsible both for gaps on this Sheet and for a hitch\nthat occurred later (see note on Sheet 9). (-2) successes, 14\/35.\nSheet 8. The first 25 calls came at intervals of very little over\n1 sec, the second 25 at intervals of less than 14 sec. (-2)\nsuccesses, 11\/46.\nSheet 9. Intervals less than 1-4 sec. in first 25, just over 1 sec. in\nsecond 25. In the second 25 Mr B.

R.\n\fJune-July 1941 Paranormal Cognition 8]\nfor about 2 sees. ; he then wrote down 5 or 6 initials after the\nsubsequent calls were heard, until by writing rapidly he had\ncaught up with the lag caused by this delay. After finishing\nthis Sheet he spoke of having got confused and said that the\nsecond 25 was \" not so good \". In fact the precognitive score,\ntwo ahead, was 10 on the first 25 and 5 on the second. (-2)\nsuccesses, 15\/46.\nAlthough the calling at the slower rate, in Expt. 1, was accom-\npanied by an apparently easy and rhythmic response from Mr B. S.,\nand the subsequent faster calling involved occasional checks in the\nrhythm through difficulty in rapid manipulation of the counters,\nbesides the confusions that arose from the intrusion of colour-images,\nmy impression was that the faster rate in Expts. 2 and 3 was easier\nfor the percipient. He did not mention fatigue or headache after\nthese expts., and seemed quite fresh at the end of them.\nIt would be interesting if one could find out whether the intrusion\nof colour-images coincides with any momentary stress in the agent's\nmind in the process of rapidly translating the colour of the counter\npresented into its significance as indicating a particular card : it\ncould be expected that when her mental process passes smoothly\nfrom perception of the colour to immediate choice of the indicated\ncard, there would be less tendency of the colour-image to become\nisolated in her mind for a moment in which it might be \" caught\n\"\nby the percipient's mind. If this is so, it seems likely that as Miss\nElliott gets more accustomed to the rapid translation of colour-\nsignals, the tendency to confusion in the perceptions received by\nMr B. S. will decrease. Also Mr B. S. should be able with further\npractice to inhibit the cognition of colour-images.\nThe (-2) successes, Mr Soal has since informed me, give a value\nfor x of 4-76 x Standard Deviation. This is subject to re-evaluation\nwith allowance for imperfectly random series in the method of\nselection by coloured counters, though any difference should be of\nslight effect. The results obtained are undoubtedly impressive and\nof great theoretical interest.\nMr Soal's habitual exactitude in method is well known, but I may\nnote for completeness that I observed all the processes of checking up\nresults in detail on the record-sheets and saw no loopholes for error.\nTo give an idea of the numerical results up to the time of my\nsecond visit, I append two tables : the first, prepared from Mr\nSoal's figures by Mrs Goldney, represents the percipient's guesses\nas compared with the card one ahead of the card ostensibly aimed\nat.

R.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nCORRESPONDENCE\nHyperaesthesia\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir, \u2014Lord Rayleigh's letter in the April-May number of the\nJournal raises points of great interest to the layman, especially\nregarding sight. I have no expert knowledge, but I always imagined\nthat over and above what sight he called supernormally good sight,\ne.g. the ability to see clearly at a great distance or to see smaller type\nin greater detail than most, there might exist persons with a greater\nrange of sight, i.e. with eyes responsive to a greater range of wave-\nlengths than the normal, such as are commonly known as infra-red\nor super-mauve (?) rays. In the same way, I imagined that photo-\ngraphic plates can record stars radiating light within the normal scale\nbut yet undiscernible by the human eye and also, if behind quartz\nlenses, reproduce rays above the ordinary scale. It is the latter\nkind of sight, if it existed, that might explain the supposed ability\nof clairvoyants to discern spirit forms, not visible to the ordinary\neye, if, that is, such ability is to be explained by an extension of the\nordinary range of sight, and the forms seen are objective and not\nhallucinations. Do I understand Lord Rayleigh to mean that he\nhas never found any such extended powers of sight? If it is possible\nto test sight in this way, it would be interesting to test the sight of\na medium like Mrs Helen Hughes. The question whether their\nvisions were objective or merely hallucinations, whether veridical\nor not, might thus perhaps be settled and a very interesting point\noften debated finally decided.\nYours, etc.,\nB. Abdy Collins\n(The photographic plate records invisibly faint stars as the result\nof prolonged exposure.

Ed.)\nREVIEWS\nExploring the TJltra-Perceptive Faculty. By J. Hettinger, Ph.D.\nRider. Pp. xii+172, with 151 Illustrations. 12s. 6d. net.\nThis book cannot be intelligently considered except as a sequel to\nits predecessor, The Ultra-Perceptive Faculty, reviewed in the\nJournal for May-June, 1940 ; and even then it is extremely difficult\nto assess it at all fairly.\n\fJune-July 1941 Reviews 85\nIn his first book Dr Hettinger described no fewer than 623 experi-\nments with two different \" psychometrists \", yielding 6631 items\n(i.e., distinguishable statements) for analysis. These were sub-\nmitted to various forms of statistical or quasi-statistical treatment\nand led to the conclusion\u2014rightly, I think\u2014that the number of\nstatements which proved relevant to the subjects (owners of the\nobjects psychometrised) could not plausibly be attributed to chance,\nrational inference, or other normal explanation. So far, so good.\nDr Hettinger then had the really brilliant idea of causing his\nsubjects to read suitable periodicals, notably illustrated papers, at\nthe same time that the psychometrist was describing her impressions,\nin the hope that she might pick up, so to say, the contemporary\nmental content induced by the illustrations, etc. The two proced-\nures were synchronised, and suitable notes were made at approxi-\nmately one-minute intervals by subject and experimenter so that\nthe picture, etc., being looked at when the psychometrist made any\nparticular statement could be identified. A large number of \" hits\n\"\n\u2014585 are claimed out of a total of 3513 items\u2014was obtained in this\nway, and the present volume is mainly devoted to presenting a\nselection of these together with reproductions of the actual illus-\ntrations concerned. If these can be taken at anything like their face\nvalue, as I should think is probable, there can be no doubt that this\nhappy inspiration has resulted in one of the most important contri-\nbutions to experimental method that has yet been devised.\nUnfortunately however, Dr Hettinger has virtually abandoned, in\nthis work, all attempt at quantitative assessment or statistical con-\ntrol. The book accordingly presents the evidence at a level on which\nthe appeal to the reader is essentially of the form \" Surely we cannot\nattribute such remarkable hits as these to mere coincidence \" rather\nthan \" The probability of such hits being due to chance coincidence\nis no more than one in so many \". For very many people this kind\nof appeal is more persuasive than any statistical treatment, and as\nsuch it will doubtless be good propaganda, in the same sort of way\nthat Mr Upton Sinclair's Mental Radio was good propaganda ; but\nscientifically speaking it represents a retrogression from his earlier\nwork.\nAgainst this, Dr Hettinger will doubtless protest (as indeed he\ndoes in the text) that having once established the reality of the\nphenomena to a high degree of probability it would be waste of time\nto do it all again. I sympathise : but the phenomena he established\nin his first book are not identically similar\u2014though doubtless closely\nakin\u2014to those he presents here ; so that when, for example, he\ninvites us to consider the type of relation (distortion, etc.) between\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nan illustration and the synchronous statement, we can form no idea\nat all of how likely it is that the hit concerned is paranormal as\nopposed to chance-determined. The hits of the previous work were\nall personal to the subjects, and 322 of this type were found in these\nexperiments ;\nstrictly, the argument from the earlier work applies\nto these alone, and can only be extended by analogy to the \" picture-\nhits \" with which the second book is concerned\u2014and even so not\nquantitatively.\nIn view of the immense amount of work that Dr Hettinger has\nevidently expended on the subject, it seems a thousand pities that he\ndid not arrange for each set ofimpressions to be scored by an indepen-\ndent and uninformed judge against the issue of the periodical actually\nused and one immediately preceding or following it. The chance of\nthe \" right \" issue being marked higher than the \" wrong \" would, of\ncourse, be one half in each case, and if a significant result had been\nfound (as I have little doubt that it would) we should have had a\nfirm basis for supposing that in this picture work also we were dealing\nwith a real effect ;\nthough, of course, even this could never tell us\nthat any particular hit was genuine. Dr Hettinger, on the other\nhand, seems content to assume that, because the earlier work showed\na significantly high proportion of successful hits, therefore every\napparent success in these experiments is paranormal\u2014and this is a\nmanifest non sequitur.\nMoreover, if scoring had been done on these lines, we could have\ngone on to classify the various types of apparent distortion, etc.,\nand we might perhaps have found that certain types occurred\nsignificantly more often among the \" right \" judgements than among\nthe \" wrong \" ; if so, we should have made a real advance, which I\nsee no other way of making at present, towards a fuller under-\nstanding of the psychological processes involved.\nIs it even now too late to do something on these lines, by obtaining\nthe necessary back numbers of periodicals and enlisting the services\nof judges who have not yet seen any of Dr Hettinger's illustrations?\nIf so, it would enormously enhance the value of an already important\npiece of work.\nI trust that nothing I have said above will be taken as an undue\ndenigration of Dr Hettinger's great and notable efforts. These two\nbooks place him quite definitely among the select few whose work\nmust be taken seriously ; but the need for quantitative results,\nsuch as cannot be brushed aside by lazy sceptics as \" mere coinci-\ndence \" is so great, and the methods of obtaining them so few, that\na return to exact methods of assessment is greatly to be desired.\nw. w. c.\n\fJune-July 1941 Reviews 87\nNothing Dies. By J. W. Dunne. Faber. 3s. 6d. net.\nIn this small book Mr Dunne sets out his theory of existence in\ntime, or at least indicates the nature of the theory, for readers who\nare unversed in science and mathematics. He appeals, therefore,\nto our experience as observers of events, and remarks that we cannot\nobserve them wholly from the outside. Our external world is bound\nup with our internal world of cognition. Here phenomena depend,\nfor us, upon the direction of our attentive focus. Here, also, we\nseism to be aware of a series of \" selves \" : I can focus my attention\nnarrowly upon an exterior event or, more widely, upon that event\nwith myself in relation to it\u2014thus bringing it more into relation\nwith my total experience in time. The observing \" I \" and the\nobserved \" myself \" seem distinct. And as soon as I direct my\nattention to their relationship, another less time-bound \" I \" seems\nto have sprung into being : the \" I \" which can overlook my self\nwhich is observing myself. And so on, in an endless sequence of a\ntype known as an infinite regress. Many thinkers find it most\nconvenient to dismiss this kind of sequence as a blind alley of\nthought, a phenomenon of mental action which can have no signifi-\ncance. Mr Dimne maintains that the phenomenon throws light\nupon the nature of being, and bases upon it his doctrine of Serialism.\nThe great interest of this theory for psychical research is the way\nin which it presents personality as an open system\u2014indeed an\nillimitable system. To quote two corollaries :\n\" The description of\nmind made by any science of yours must be, always, an inadequate\ndescription of the mind that can make that science.\" \" We have\nalways more knowledge than we suspect ourselves of possessing.\"\nThis follows if our personality comprises, as Mr Dunne puts it, a\nseries of knowers each of which is aware of an inferior knower and\nis known by a superior knower. (\" Thus \", he adds, \" the ultimate\nknower can never be discovered \"\u2014\" never \", we must presume,\nwithin time as we at present understand it.)\nMr Dunne does not seem yet to have dealt with a pitfall for thought\nwhich is involved in an infinite regress. He himself takes the fact,\n\" every child had a father \", leading to the proposition, \" every\nfather had a father \", as an example of a regress ;\nnot, presumably,\nof an infinite regress, since as we take the series back towards the\nbeginning of life on the planet we find that it tails off into nothing.\nAt an early enough stage in evolution the terms \" child \" and\n\" father \" dwindle in meaning, and their meaning finally dis-\nappears. In this case we know enough to be able to observe that the\nregress is not infinite. The question is whether we ever know enough\nto assert that a regress in concrete terms is infinite. In any case,\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nit seems impossible to know what is happening to the meaning of\nour terms as we string them out into an infinite series. Mr Dunne,\nindeed, says that \" the regress denies you further knowledge \", but\nadds that \" it will give you nothing but the same answer as before,\ncast in a more complex form \". An unresolved paradox seems to\nbe that Serialism claims \" further knowledge \" on the basis of a\nrepetitive series which denies it.\nBut if Mr Dunne does reason about his series of numerically\ndifferent \" selves \" or \" knowers \" beyond the limits within which\nwe can attach any secure meaning to these terms, it would be futile\nto reject the significance of his reasoning so far as we do know what\nhe is talking about. At the observable end of the series the meaning\nof \" self \" appears to expand rather than diminish. We may think\nof it as expanding, at the wiobservable end, into the transcendent,\ninstead of dwindling (like the meaning of \" child \" and \" father \")\nto a vanishing-point. So far as we can observe the expansion, we\ncan follow the inference that it points to something illimitable in the\nnature of personality.\nThis brief and relatively simple book should meet the require-\nments of many who cannot see the wood for the trees in Mr Dunne's\nmore extended and technical arguments. K. R.\nThe Truth about Spiritualism,. By The Master of the Temple.\nStudent Christian Movement. 2s. net.\nIn his foreword Harold Anson writes that he wants \" to impress\nupon professing Christians the importance of not pouring scorn upon\nevidences and experiences which are in great part similar to those\nupon which the events which formed the foundation of the primitive\ngospel rest \", and he then in a succinct way runs through the various\nevidences for psychical occurrences, emphasising specially those\n\u2014\nsuch as levitations, materialisations, appearances of the dead, clair-\naudience, clairvoyance\u2014which are paralleled in gospel narratives.\nThere is of course nothing new in this to students of psychical re-\nsearch, but the fact that a prominent churchman should pronounce\non the value to the Christian religion of research into the strange\nsupernormal faculties of man, and the evidence they supply for some\nof the supernatural elements in the gospel story,\u2014this is of great\nimportance and value. Although the Master of the Temple con-\nsiders the resurrection of Jesus the vital indispensable foundation of\nthe whole faith, he frankly confesses that he does not think the\nevidence for it comes up to scientific standards. His argument is\nrather that many occurrences for which there is strong testimony,\n\fJtJNE-JlTLY 1941 Reviews\npoint not only to the possibility of appearances after death, but to\nthe reality of a life beyond, and different from, the one in which we\nare immersed.\nThe two chapters, one called \" Immortality as understood by\nSpiritualists \", and \" The Christian Doctrine of Immortality \",\nwith which last the book ends, are impressive summaries of what\nbeliefs the results of psychical research of the last fifty years may\nsanction and stimulate, and of the Christian's modern interpretation\nof immortality.\nAfter quoting the opinion of the Dean of St. Paul's, Dr Walter\nMathews, that \" there is a residuum of estabhshed facts which prima\nfacie suggest the hypothesis of survival \" ; Mr Anson concludes :\n\" I\nshould myself go somewhat further, and say that the facts make\nsurvival an assured truth, but that it is a survival of something\ndeeper and more fundamental than the personality with which we\nare ordinarily familiar in the commerce of terrestrial life.\" It will\nbe understood from this short review, that the book is not intended\nto be a contribution to psychical research, as such, but as a rational\nexplanation of its value to religion of all kinds, and the author con-\ntends, pre-eminently to the Christian religion.\nThose who are constantly asked to recommend books which may\ngive a rational account of the evidence for survival, and at the same\ntime induce faith in what is called revealed religion will be grateful\nto the Master of the Temple for this temperate and impartial study\nand its final conclusion. \" The Christian Faith does not teach an\nimmortality which consists of a gradual absorption into God, involv-\ning a loss of individual being.\" E. L.\nWitchcraft. By Charles Williams. Faber. 12s. 6d. net.\nThis book does not deal with witchcraft in relation to any para-\nnormal faculties that may have been involved in its manifestations,\nbut is of considerable interest as an able historical study, backed by\ncareful and intelligent research ; and the writing has the real vitality\nthat springs from a disciplined imagination trained to a sensitive\nexpressiveness. It is even more a study of the insensate cruelty let\nloose in witch-hunting than of witchcraft itself. The whole picture\nillustrates through the centuries the horrible tangle of superstition,\ncruelty and fear out of which such things as mediumship have only\nrecently extricated themselves. Witchcraft and the suspicion of it\narose in close association with the psychically \" sensitive \" type,\nthough the general evidence, and the impression conveyed by Mr\nWilliams's study, suggest that psychical phenomena had little part\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nin manifestations that were chiefly of power-craving in a disordered\njumble with hatreds and illicit passions. They could and did, how-\never, bolster up the claim to occult powers, as in the episode retold\nin Mr Williams's admirable sketch of James I's mentality in its\ncontact with the problem\u2014the \" witch \" Agnes Sampson, under\nthreat of the law, declining to benefit by the royal scepticism, and\nputting forward in proof of her magic quality what may have been\na telepathic impression of the king's private conversation with his\nbride. The king swore \" that all the Devils in Hell could not have\ndiscovered the same \", but must still have felt dubious about Agnes's\nstory of two hundred witches who went to sea in sieves, drinking\nwine as they floated. K. R.\nPsychic Science, Vol. XX, No. 1, April 1941.\nWe are glad to receive the first issue of \" Psychic Science \" under\nthe editorship of our member, Mr Abdy Collins, to whom we wish\nall success in his new duties. Among other matters of interest will\nbe found a declaration of policy by the International Institute for\nPsychic Investigation, of which \" Psychic Science \" is the quarterly\nJournal. The Council of that body declare that it appears to them\nthat through the researches that have been conducted and the\nevidence which has been carefully accumulated and sifted over this\nperiod by the Society for Psychical Research, other societies and\ninstitutions and independent workers in this and other countries, the\nexistence of certain phenomena, which no one of any standing\nwould have claimed to be substantiated in 1882 (the year when\nour Society was founded), has now been clearly established and\npublicly recognised by persons of eminence in the world of Science\nand Philosophy.\nAfter naming some of these phenomena, the Council of the Insti-\ntute proceeds : \"In the light of all these facts, the Council feels that\nthe adoption of a purely negative attitude towards the question of\nsurvival is no longer warranted. . . . All members, whether they\nconsider survival proved or not, must agree that there is much to\ninvestigate with an open mind before we can hope to understand\nwhat we now call supernormal phenomena.\"\nThis declaration is followed by a programme of psychical research\nby Mr Abdy Collins, in the course of which he refers several times\nto the paper which he read to the S.P.R. in April, 1940, and states\nthe case against an approach to the question of survival on too narrow\na front. Of the specific lines of investigation perhaps the most\ninteresting is a more extensive study of death-bed scenes. Mr\nCollins, who attaches great importance to the evidence of death-bed\n\fJune-July 1941 Reviews 01\nphenomena, suggests that a census of them should be taken with the\nassistance of a broadcast appeal, that an enquiry among peoples\nand tribes throughout the world should be made and that photo-\ngraphs should be taken at death-beds as a matter of routine at some\nof our hospitals, with a view to possibly obtaining photographs of\nthe departure of the soul similar to those claimed by Dr Baraduc\nto have been obtained by him.\nIn his programme Mr Collins speaks of \" Investigations on present\nlines \" into materialisation, direct voice, direct and authentic\nwriting. This raises the question what \" present lines \" Mr Collins\nmeans, since it is unfortunately the case that the standards of experi-\nment and observation upheld by the Society have not always been\nfollowed by other enquirers. It is to be hoped that under Mr\nCollins's guidance the International Institute for Psychic Investi-\ngation will endeavour to uphold a high standard of evidence in these\nmatters. W. H. S.\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. 5, No. 1, March 1941.\nThis issue of the Journal of Parapsychology contains only one\nmajor article, viz. a report, \" Experiments bearing upon the Pre-\ncognition Hypothesis. Ill : Mechanically Selected Cards \", by Dr J.\nB. Rhine. Earlier experiments with hand-shuffled cards had given\nsignificant results, but the hypothesis of precognitive E. S. P. had,\nin such cases, to compete with that of the \" E. S. P. Shuffle. \"\n; that\nis to say, that the order of the cards in the shuffle, which, of course,\ntakes place after the call has been made by the subject, is in some\nway and to some extent determined by awareness of the record of the\ncalls. In order to exclude this possibility Dr Rhine devised experi-\nments wherein the shuffling was mechanically performed. Two short\nintroductory series were carried out and these both gave a negative\ndeviation, indicating the possible existence of a score-depressant\nfactor. The main series consisted of two divisions, in one of which\nthe subjects were Adults, in the other Children. The procedure was\nfurther differentiated by offering rewards for success in some runs\nand comparing the results with those of other runs for which no\nreward was offered. Matching technique was used throughout, that\nis to say, the subject laid out the cards, face-downwards, against an\nempty set of positions in which target cards were subsequently\nplaced after mechanical shuffling : 1108 runs were done in the Adult\ngroup and 500 by the Children. The first yielded a total negative\ndeviation of 239, average - -216, this gives a Critical Ratio of 3-59\nbased on theoretical standard deviation and 344 based on empirical,\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research June-July 1941\nboth of which are significant. The Chi-square of the fit to a binomial\ndistribution gives a probability of -G0035. For the Children the total\ndeviation was positive = 123, average -246, C. R. 2-75 theoretical and\n2-63 empirical. Chi-square evaluation gives a probability of -012,\nall of which are significant except the last which slightly exceeds the\ncriterion.\nThe negative deviation for the Adults was as had been expected.\nThe comparison between Reward and No-Reward was suggestive but\ninconclusive.\nThe paper contains a discussion of various counter-hypotheses,\nalso of the causation and implication of negative deviations. In an\nAppendix Dr Rhine gives a brief summary of all known precognition\nexperiments up to June 1939 and in a table shows the combined\nresidts.\nI was pleased to see that the feature introduced in the previous\nissue, of giving extracts from the comments of the Board of Review\nhas again been included. The criticism, all of it very frank and some\nof it severe, constitutes a most valuable aid to the reader in forming\nhis opinion.

For the information regard-\ning his career given below we are indebted to the address delivered\nto the Boston Society by Mr Addington Bruce, and printed in the\nsummer issue of the Journal of the American S.P.R.\n\fOctober 1941 Obituary Notice 95\nIn his early years Elwood Worcester enjoyed the advantages of\na happy home, where his education made such progress that at\nthirteen he was able to matriculate into Kochester University. But\nowing to his father's financial reverses and death, he had to abandon\nfor the thne being all thoughts of the university and to help in\nsupporting the family by taking work in the freight office of a\nrailway company. There one day, eating his lunch out of a tin pail\nin gloomy mood and gloomy surroundings, he saw the yellow wall\nopposite him suddenly become bright, though there was no sun-\nshine. The wall grew brighter, and he heard a voice say distinctly,\nBe faithful to me and I will be faithful to you.\"\nThis experience made so great an impression on Worcester that\nhe started at once on a course of self-education, rising every morning\nat five and devoting to his studies every moment not occupied by\nhis work for the railway. After a year the family fortunes improved\nsufficiently to enable him to go to Columbia University. He worked\nhis way through this, and through the General Theological Seminary\nin New York, and then took a post-graduate course in psychology\nand philosophy under Wundt and Fechner at Leipzig. There he\ngained a knowledge not only of psychology but of general scientific\nmethod. On returning to America he took over the dual post of\nchaplain and professor of psychology and philosophy at Lehigh\nUniversity, where he made a special study of medical psychology.\nSix years later he was called to St Stephen's Church in Phila-\ndelphia, where one of his parishioners was the nerve specialist, Weir\nMitchell. In one of their many conversations Mitchell said to him,\n\" Rector, if you and I should get together and establish a work for\nthe sick, basing it on sound religion and sound science, we could\nput Dr \u2014:\n\u2014 (mentioning a person he detested) out of business.'\nTheir friendship was a preparation for, and a stimulus to, the healing\nwork Worcester started at his next church, Emmanuel Church.\nBoston, which gave its name to what came to be known as the\nEmmanuel Movement.\nHe thus became, in Mr Bruce's words, \" a pioneer in social\nendeavour of a sort to which the Protestant Episcopal Church had\nto learn to become accustomed \". The work met with criticism in\nvarious quarters, to which Worcester replied in his book, Body,\nMind and Spirit. Through it he first became keenly interested in\npsychical research, and formed a close friendship with James Hyslop.\nAfter Dr Hyslop's death \", says Mr Bruce, \" some members felt\nthat the American S.P.R. had begun to diverge from the type of\nscientific research which it had carried on under his direction and\ninspiration. Dr Worcester, always a scientist as well as a clergyman\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1941\nand scholar, was moved to establish an independent psychical\nresearch society in Boston. He was fortunate in being able to secure\nat the outset the assistance of Dr Walter Franklin Prince, for some\ntime Dr Hyslop's assistant in research.\" The value of Dr Prince's\nwork is too well known to our members to need further elabora-\ntion. The two societies are now happily reunited under the Presi-\ndency of Dr George Hyslop.\nDr Worcester also had remarkable powers of physical endurance,\nwhich found an outlet in fishing and big game hunting. Mr Bruce\nmentions as his outstanding characteristics, \" his selflessness, his\nlove of truth, and his eagerness to help others and to promote\nreligious faith among the masses of men by demonstrating the\npractical helpfulness of religion.\"\nEXPERIMENTS IN TELEPATHY, JUNE-JULY 1941\n[Report contributed by Mr Donald West, a Member of the Society, ivhose\nfather, Mr J. C. West, acted as percipient in the experiments.]\nAbstract.\nThe percipient was, in all cases, asked to guess which of five\narticles, all known to him, was being \" concentrated upon \". 2000\ntrials were carried out, using a variety of materials. The results\nshowed a fairly steady increase in the percipient's telepathic\nfaculty as the experiments proceeded. The success varied con-\nsiderably with the type of material used. When the percipient was\nasked to guess more slowly he had no success whatever.\nThe Types of Material used were :\n(a) The numbers 1-5. (375 trials.)\n(b) The five symbols, circle, triangle, cross, etc., as on Zener\ncards. (375 trials.)\n(c) Coloured discs, red, white, blue, pink and green. (375 trials.)\n(d) 1st set of five drawings. (125 trials.)\n2nd set of five drawings. (300 trials.)\n3rd set of five drawings. (300 trials.)\n(e) Five tastes, alum, salt, soap, sugar and pepper. (50 trials.)\n(\/) The Zener type guessed slowly. (100 trials.)\nThe number of trials allotted to each type was not designed to\ngive greater prominence to those types in which the percipient\nhappened to have more success, quite the reverse, if anything.\nTechnique.\nIn all the experiments the percipient was separated from the\nmaterial to be discerned by a wardrobe. The screening device was\n\fOctober 1941 Experiments in Telepathy, June-July 1941 97\nthus perfect. The numbers used were contained on a small pack\nof 25 cards, which were run through continuously and then re-\nshuffled, the percipient endeavouring to guess the top card. The\nZener figures were inked by myself on five identical pieces of card-\nboard, which were placed face downwards. One would be turned\nover and the percipient asked to guess which it was. When the\nsame card was repeated it was always turned over and back again,\nin order not to give the fact away to the percipient. Exactly the\nsame procedure was used in the case of the pictorial types, the\ndrawings being inked on identical slips of paper. In the case of\nthe coloured discs they were placed in a row on a piece of cloth.\nThey were the ordinary smooth \" tiddly-wink \" counters, and one\nwould be silently slid away and placed on its own, the percipient\nbeing asked to guess which one it was. In the case of the tastes,\nthe substances were all powdered and placed in five approximately\nequal piles. The finger would be moistened and the top of the\nappropriate pile, and then the tip of the tongue touched, the per-\ncipient being asked to guess simultaneously. In all cases the relative\nposition of the five objects was carefully concealed from the per-\ncipient, and, moreover, the screening arrangements would not have\nallowed the percipient to see the movements of my arms, or indeed\nany part of my body, so that even if he had known the relative\npositions of the objects it would not have helped him.\nExcept in the case of the trials in which the percipient was\nspecially asked to guess slowly, his attempt came only a second or\nso after my saying \" guess \".\nEach article was given a number from 1 to 5, and an arbitrary\nseries of these numbers was obtained by the use of four dice and\nseveral packs of cards. This series was carefully concealed\nfrom the percipient. At each of the experiments the cards would\nbe turned over, the discs slid or the substances tasted in the order\nprescribed by this series.

In some cases it appeared that the percipient was having con-\nsiderable retrocognitive success, but no normal success. Detailed\nexamination showed that this effect was not general. As a whole the\nretrocognitive success was less than would be expected from chance\ncoincidence. In those series in which the normal deviation was\nnegative, the retrocognitive deviation was, as a rule, negative also,\nbut not so much so. Dja for all the series in which the percipient\nhad a negative deviation was -:^L= -3-23.

J. E. Ellis. The\nconditions were exceedingly stringent. The experiments were carried\nout with the percipient and myself alone in my study. His wrists\nwere fastened to the arms of his chair with gummed paper, and his\nhead, leaning back on the afore-mentioned wardrobe, was held in\nposition with gummed paper round his neck. The cards, moreover,\nwere placed well inside a cupboard.\nThe results obtained confirmed my previous observations with\nthis percipient, when I found that he had quite a remarkable tran-\nsitory brilliance on certain days, but on others his \" power \" would\nbe only feeble. On the first occasion (24th June) he guessed correctly\n21 out of the 50 cards, giving a deviation of nearly -i times the\nstandard error. On the second occasion (2nd July) he guessed cor-\nrectly only 10, giving no deviation at all. The total deviation for\nthe 100 trials was thus only 2\u00a7 times the standard error. In any\ncase the number of trials with this percipient are at present too few\nto warrant any definite conclusion.\nTELEPATHY IN MACBETH?\nBy Hans Ehrenwald, M.D.\nFirst Witch : All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\nSecond Witch : All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Candor!\nThird Witch : All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!\nThe works of Shakespeare have always been considered more than\ndeliberate inventions of a playwright, however great his genius.\n\f100 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1941\nThey have been felt as living creations of nature, as\nFictions in form, but in their substance truths.\nThis is why his characters are familiar to us as living persons, why\nthey have been subjected, to laborious character-study by genera-\ntions of scholars from many points of view. Psycho-analysts, more\nrecently, have contributed the deep psychological analysis of such\ncharacters as Hamlet, Richard III and Portia, and it is from this\npoint of view\u2014in conjunction with that of psychical research\u2014that\na few remarks may be made on the subject of the Weird Sisters in\n\" Macbeth \" and their prophecy.\nMacbeth, when hailed by the witches as Thane of Glands, Thane\nof Cawdor, and as \" king hereafter \", is deeply impressed. He first\nrejects the idea, but only to be entangled in the fight between the\nconflicting forces of his nature that entice him to\nyield to the suggestion\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs.\nShakespeare's critics are wont to regard the figures of the three\nwitches and their prophecy as \" one of the incitements to the deed\ncontributing to its plausibility \".1\nTaken at their face value there\nis in fact good reason to accept them as characters fully in keeping\nwith the credulity and superstitions of Shakespeare's time\u2014\na\ncredulity on which he counted so completely for dramatic purpose\nor effect that it is often uncertain whether he did not himself share\nin it to some extent. In addition it may be recalled that the theme\nof a prophecy and its inescapable implications can plainly be traced\nto the tradition of the ancient classical tragedy with its irretrievably\npredetermined outcome.\nFrom the point of view of modern deep psychology, however, all\nthese supernatural forces, the innumerable spiritual beings in which\nman in the magic and animistic stage believed, the spirits and\ndemons of ancient mythology, as well as the devils, witches, were-\nwolves and nightmares that vexed the imagination of mankind from\nthe Dark Ages up to our times, are merely expressions of man's\nown repressed unruly desires, or unconscious aggressive tendencies.\nThis is, at least, the. explanation that has been suggested by Freud\nand his followers, and although its relevance to the field of anthro-\npology and archeology has remained controversial, there is little\ndoubt that it represents an ingenious attempt to understand the\nproducts of primitive mentality, of magic and animism\u2014of what\n1\nPeter Alexander : Shakespeare's Art and Life, London, 1939.\n\fOctober 1941 Telepathy in Macbeth ? 101\nhas been called the social paranoia of primitive man\u2014along the\nsame lines as the delusions of the insane, the persecution ideas of\nparanoics and the nightmares of our dream life.\nIn the view of psycho-analysis all these manifestations are subject\nto the principle of projection. Primitive man, the insane, the\ndreamer, invest products of their phantasy with wishes and desires\nof their own and project their vivid personifications into the outer\nworld. Their frightening appearance, their malignant character, are\nbut expressions of their creators' condemnation of what they them-\nselves cannot by any means admit to be flesh and blood of their\nown. Viewed from this angle the weird sisters with their sinister\nprophecy are but mouthpieces of Macbeth's own ambitious desires,\nthat is, of his desire to become in fact Thane of Glamis, Thane of\nCawdor, and subsequently\u2014even at the cost of the fatherly king\nDuncan's assassination\u2014Duncan's successor. The weird sisters\"\nprophecy was, in this way, not so much a revelation of future events\nas an expression of Macbeth's own designs, though still looming,\nunformulated and unperceived, in the back of his mind.\nYet this interpretation, suggested by psycho-analysis (and I am\nnot at present able to ascertain whether it has already been put\nforward), though credible from the psychological point of view,\nrepresents neither the whole nor yet the only truth. Much has been\nsaid in favour of the \" genuineness \" of phenomena that have been\nattributed to supernatural beings in bygone times. Yet there are\ntwo significant instances of alleged prophecy\u2014not by the \" weird\nsisters \" of the dramatist, but by professional fortune-tellers of a\nmore enlightened age\u2014which lend themselves to an instructive\ncomparison with our case and which have been reported by no less\nan authority than Sigmund Freud himself. It was by these two\nobservations that he was led seriously to consider the possibility of\ntelepathy.\nI have referred elsewhere 1\nto that little known concession of\nFreud to the case of psychical research. In both instances he\ntells the story of a neurotic patient consulting a fortune-teller who,\nthough not actually \" predicting \" the future of his client, still\nhappened unexpectedly to hit on most intimate details of the\npatient's secret life, partly unrecognised by himself, yet all the\nmore charged with repressed emotional significance. In one of the\ncases the fortune-teller's \" prediction \" actually referred to repressed\ndeath wishes against his client's brother-in-law, the revelation of\nwhich, had it been bluntly disclosed to the patient, might well have\nmade his \" seated heart knock at his ribs \".\n1\nProc, S.P.R. XLVI, November 1940.\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1941\nI have pointed out that the importance of these instances for the\nbetter understanding of the origin of telepathic phenomena lies in\nthat they clearly indicate the role of repressed, unconscious ten-\ndencies in the mind of the potential agent. The fortune-teller in\nFreud's cases was nothing more than a percipient of the contents,\nhighly charged with emotion, of the mind. The way in which the\n\" message \" received by the fortune-teller finds its formulation is\na matter of his individual interpretation. Its mis-interpretation as\na prophetic revelation is of course to be expected, and falls fully\ninto fine with traditional superstitious beliefs.\nThe psychological situation in Macbeth\u2014in spite of all the dif-\nferences of the external conditions\u2014is much the same as in Freud 's\ncases. Here too we have the case of a man who believes that he is\nquestioning persons possessed of supernormal knowledge of his fate.\nWhat he is told is dressed up in the garment of prophecy. But its\nreal meaning is a reflexion, as it were, of his own secret hopes and\nambitions, of his own unformulated sinister designs. They appear\nalien, as yet, to his conscious plan of life, but once expressed by\nanother person, they gain unexpected power over his mind, and the\nway in which they eventually drive him to the deed is the main\nfeature of Macbeth's tragedy.\nThis interpretation suggests that Shakespeare in the scene of the\nblasted heath unwittingly describes a classical instance of telepathy,\nsuch as had occurred in innumerable instances in legend and history\nand such as happens over and over again in various disguises. The\ntelepathic reading of the scene is thus precisely the reverse of its\ninterpretation along the lines of Freud's projection theory, although\nwe have just seen how well its rival interpretation is in keeping with\nfacts revealed by the founder of the projection theory himself.\nI have dealt with these apparently conflicting alternatives else-\nwhere 1\nand have shown that the psychologist, once prepared to\nadmit the possibility of telepathic occurrences, is liable to encounter\nthe same dilemma in such divergent instances as the deep psycho-\nlogical appreciation of the mental phenomena of mediumistic trance,\nparanoic delusions, etc. Of course, in the case of Macbeth's ex-\nperience with the weird sisters, neither of the two conflicting inter-\npretations can be put to the test. The problem will have to be\ntackled by means of more directly accessible evidence drawn, as far\nas possible, from first-hand observation of life. But whether any\npsychologist, with all his equipment of scientific experience, will\never be able to perceive the manifestations of the human soul with\nShakespeare's intuitive insight and exactitude of observation and\ndescription, is another matter.\n1 \" Telepathy, its Origin and Obsolescence \" (monograph in preparation).\n\fOctober 1941 Correspondence 103\nCORRESPONDENCE\nHYPERAESTHESIA\nTo the Editor of The Journal\nSir,\u2014In reply to the letter of Mr Abdy Collins in the Journal for\nJune-July 1941, p. 84, my investigation, given in S.P.R. Proc,\nVol. XLV, p. 19, referred only to the power of distinguishing the\npresence or absence of a patch of very faint light, and not to the\nquite different question of the power of distinguishing detail.\nAccording to optical theory this last is definitely limited by the\naperture of the pupil of the eye, say J inch, and normal eyes come\nclose to the limit of what is possible. It would not therefore seem\nto be a promising line of investigation to see if mediums could do\nbetter.\nAs regards the possibility that some gifted persons might be able\nto see into the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, there are probably\nsome small differences in this respect, but, for dark adapted vision,\nthe properties of the eye depend upon the pigment called the visual\npurple, found in all vertebrate animals, which can be extracted from\nthe retina of the eyes of animals kept in the dark before killing.\nThe maximum sensitiveness of the visual purple to bleaching is in\nthe green region of the spectrum, and the maximum sensitivity of\nthe eye agrees closely with it, so the overwhelming probability is\nthat all eyes are similar. For other reasons, which it would take me\ntoo far to explain, I do not think it is likely that any persons can\nsee appreciably further into the ultraviolet than the normal man can\ndo, even when the eye is not dark-adapted.\nI am, yours faithfully,\nRayleigh\nREVIEWS\nI am Persuaded. By Julian Duguid. Cape. 12s. 6d. net.\nMr Duguid's book describes the movement of an active and\nadventurous mind through agnosticism to an individual basis of\nfaith, a journey in which he passes through the territory of psychical\nresearch and takes note of the evidence that strikes him as cogent.\nHis range of discussion is wide, and his thought rapid and picturesque,\noften penetrating with a keen probe to the inadequacies whether\nof stereotyped belief or of complacent disbelief. The book leaves,\nperhaps, the impression of many good things said rather than of a\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1941\nconstructive argument established, but Mr Duguid is more con-\ncerned to present a coherent story of mental and spiritual experience\nthan to set out a philosophy.\nHis approach to psychical research is that of the human creature\naware of psychic needs and of insufficient answers to its questionings,\nand is also that of intelligent man stimulated in mind by the recent\nadvances of science and the problems that they raise. It would be\neasy to pick holes in some of his rather hasty and sketchy conceptions\nof modern scientific theories and their meaning ; it is more relevant\nto note that he represents the genuine enquirer in scientific fields,\nunsatisfied by answers that are only repetitions of formulae, and\nvery much alive to the importance of evidence that upsets a com-\nplacent formula\n\u2014\" those things which ought not to occur \", accord-\ning to the rules, and were considered by Herschel to be the main\nsource of discovery in his own science of astronomy. In this attitude\npsychical research is more faithful to scientific principle than are\nthose scientists who maintain that what ought not to occur cannot\nhave occurred, and Mr Duguid has turned to the records of our\nSociety for soundly based evidence of the occurrence of psychical\nphenomena.\nHe is impressed by the Society's \" vast reservoirs of knowledge\nquite unknown to the man in the street \", and is keenly interested\nin the evidence for unexplored attributes of human personality, as\nwell as in the subject most germane to his thesis, that of evidence\nfor survival. As to the latter, he notes that \" Telepathy is a possible\nexplanation, but a telepathy so subtle and selective that its proof\nwould revolutionise our world \". Fully on guard against the snare\nof wishful thinking, he observes acutely that this may cut both\nways. The materialistic scientist may desire extinction without\nknowing it. \" He is unaware that the mechanism of escape is as\npowerful in him as in the mystic. Each, in fact, is expressing a dis-\ntaste for the tedium of his own body : an opinion all secretly share\nat some time or another during life.\"\nWhile speaking with respect of the impressive nature of the more\ncomplex evidence for survival such as that of cross-correspondences,\nhe selects as a compact instance for citation a good example of the\nevidence from proxy sittings, an excerpt from the Bobby Newlove\ncase. His conclusions in favour of survival, as on the wider questions\nof the human soul and of religious beliefs are wisely stated as a matter\nof reasoned preference rather than of inescapable logical proof.\n\" There are facts enough in this world to bolster up any conclusion,\nprovided one is resolute enough to ignore or deny the opposite.\"\nK.

Hyslop, of the Society's objectives. \" The present Board of\nTrustees \", he says,\n' ;\nfeels that while the Society must give due\nconsideration to all types of phenomena, it must avoid\ndevoting its time and material resources to enquiries which lead\nto unnecessary controversy, or which deal with experimental sub-\njects who do not wish to submit to'what may be fairly regarded as\nproper test conditions.\"\nIn an article on Some Present-Day Trends in Psychical Research\nDr Gardner Murphy and Miss Laura Dale pay a very handsome\ntribute to the experimental work of Mr Whately Carington, Mr Soal,\nand Dr Hettinger, and give a general survey of work in the United\nStates, which they classify as \" (a) research having to do with the\nexperimental study of precognition, and (b) research relating to\nthose psychological dispositions of the individual percipient which\nappear to account for his ability to perform successfully at extra-\nsensory perception tasks.\"\nUnder the title Telepathy or Association? Mrs Allison discusses\nthree cases in which she suggests that possibly \" when a recent\nassociation in the percipient's mind is coupled by chance with part\nof a veridical impression . . . the association may aid the emergence\nof the impression which might otherwise fail to reach the level of\nconsciousness.\" The words \" part of \" are important, as in each\nof the three incidents \" association was only the starting point for\nfurther veridical details \".\nThe first case, reported by Dr McDougall to Dr Walter Prince\nshortly before the latter's death, is of particular interest. A French-\nman, who had left his native Alsace as a boy owing to the German\noccupation, settled in 1888 in the United States and made his home\nin Texas. On Sunday evening, 21st December, 1930, when reading\na book, he was seized with a feeling of great sadness, burst into\nfloods of tears and became almost hysterical. \" I looked at the clock\nand it was 8 p.m., or probably two or three minutes later.\" He\nremained in this state about ten minutes, and it struck him\nthat the last time he had been so affected was in the same room in\n1924, shortly after he had heard of his mother's death in Prance,\nand that once before he had had a similar experience in the same\nroom on receiving news of the death of his sister's two children,\nalso in Prance. \" I then said to myself, '\nI am wondering if my\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1941\nfather at this very moment is not in his last agony.' I looked at\nthe clock again. It was 8.15,\" and he made a note of the day and\nhour in his memorandum book. About a fortnight later he learnt\nfrom his brother-in-law that his father had died in Alsace on the\n22nd December between 2 and 2.10 a.m. Time in Alsace is six\nhours ahead of time in Texas, where the percipient was living. The\ntime correspondence was therefore extremely close.\nSo stated, the case looks like a veridical phantasm of the death-\ncoincidence type, but a complication is introduced by the subject\nof the passage which the percipient was reading. He had taken up\nby chance the novel Death Comes to the Archbishop, which he had\npreviously read three years before. He had opened the book at\nrandom and was reading of the last days of the Archbishop, when\nhe feels himself dying. The Archbishop in the story was a French-\nman most of whose work had lain in New Mexico and Arizona, which\nadjoin Texas. The train of thought which might lead the percipient,\nhimself a Frenchman self-exiled to America, to think of his French\nhome and his father, a very old man who still lived there, is obvious,\nand memories of bad news from home twice received by him in that\nroom would re-inforce it. A case could therefore be made out on\nthose lines for attributing the experience to a combination of\nassociation of ideas and chance coincidence, a view which the per-\ncipient was himself inclined to accept. But, as Mrs Allison points\nout, he had read the book before, and must then have had similar\nmental association without being provoked to extreme emotion.\nClearly a marginal case, and, it may be added, while marginal\ncases do not help greatly in demonstrating telepathy, they are of\nenormous importance in elucidating it.\nThe Journal also contains an obituary notice of Dr Elwood\nWorcester, to which we refer elsewhere, and a note on some typical\ncases treated by him and his associates. Altogether a most interest-\ning number.\nW. H. S.\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. 3, No. 2, June 1941.\nDr Chas. E. Stuart contributes an article entitled \"An Analysis\nto determine a Test Predictive of Extra-chance Scoring in card-\ncalling Tests \". This is an account of an investigation undertaken\nto explore the psychological relations of extra-chance card-calling.\nThe method adopted was to ask the subject to guess the number of\nsuccesses scored after the completion of the run. These guesses\nwere correlated with the immediately preceding score in order to\n\fOctober 1941 Reviews 107\ntest the degree to which they were influenced by the subject's know-\nledge of his just previous success or failure. This correlation is\ntermed the T score. The test was applied to the first ten runs, the\nremainder being the card-calling score.\nThe T scores were then divided into two classes, the mid-range,\nfrom - -20 to + -20, that is to say, those in which the estimates\nwere negligibly affected by the previous score, forming one class,\nthe other embracing scores from - 1 to - -201 and from + -201\nto +1.\nThe data for the investigation fell into two series ; in the first,\nthey were the records of six experiments in pre-shuffle card-calling,\nthe second those of four experiments in test-shuffle calling. The\nconditions of these experiments as regards precautions against\nsensory clues etc. were on the whole satisfactory, for the pre-\nshuffle calling sensory clues are of course, excluded. The critical\nratios for the ten experiments were low, the highest being only 2-74,\nthe combined C.R. being only 2-71.\nThe first result for Series I showed provisionally that the mid-\nrange class of T scores was associated with extra-chance scoring,\nwhile the other class was statistically not significant. For Series II\nthe same result was more strikingly shown.\nVarious refinements and sub-divisions were made which tended to\nconfirm this provisional result.\nThe conclusion which Dr Stuart draws from this interesting and\nvaluable piece of research is that those subjects whose estimates are\nunaffected or little affected by their just previous score are more\nlikely, to a significant degree, to obtain extra-chance results than\nare those whose estimates are influenced by immediately preceding\nsuccess or failure, and that this may be used as a predictive test. It\nis to be hoped that further research along these lines may be under-\ntaken in order to obtain insight into the psychological conditions\ndeterminant of E. S. P.\nThe remainder of this issue is devoted to the first of two articles\ncontributed by Dr J. Hettinger of London on \" The Ultra-Perceptive\nFaculty \". It is an attempt to give within a limited compass the\nmain points of his research as reported in his book published under\nthe same title.\nDr Hettinger employed professional sensitives and concentrated\non so-called \" psychometry \", that is to say, articles belonging to the\nvarious subjects were handed to the sensitive who then gave the\nimpressions which she received. The subject was never present at\nthe sitting and was, in all cases, unknown to the sensitive, very\noften to Dr Hettinger himself.\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research October 1941\nVarious control methods were adopted in the first tentative series :\nin the 2nd and 3rd cheeking series five different subjects were given\neach five records, one being obtained from their own article, the rest\nfrom those provided by the other four subjects. They were asked to\nfill in the first column of their own record and one column on each\nof the others, the idea being to discover how many of a number of\nrecords would show a superiority for the actual subject as compared\nwith the four checking subjects. Out of 40 records 29 actual sub-\njects showed superiority and Dr Hettinger works out for this a\ncritical ratio of 1148. I would point out here that there is some\nerror, probably typographical, in the figures given for this calcula-\ntion on page 150, for one thing on working the standard deviation\nthe square root sign is omitted ; the discrepancy, however, is small.\nIn the 4th, 5th and 6th series the method of mixing items was\nused. This consists in mixing twelve items given by the sensitive\nwith an equal number drawn from another source, called the Guess-\nbox, and asking the subject to indicate which items were applicable\nto him. If the items given by the sensitive were chosen with a\nhigher frequency than those from the Guess-box this would tend to\nshow some extra-chance factor. The computation of frequency both\nof cases and of items yielded significant results.\nFor the remaining six series further modifications of method were\nadopted but in the majority of these cases the level of significance\nwas not reached.\nIt is not necessary within the space of a short review to specify\nmore precisely the nature of these modifications seeing that its sole\npurpose is to indicate briefly what the reader of the article may\nexpect to find and to encourage him, if interested in such matters,\nto consult the original.\nSummarising the twelve series Dr Hettinger finds that the com-\nbined C.K. is 14-6, which is, of course, highly significant, while that\nfor sensitive K is 8-52 and for sensitive F 12-22. The article con-\ncludes with a short account of investigation into the time factor,\nthat is to say, how far recency or the reverse affects the result. Dr\nHettinger arrives at the conclusion that the recency of the items\nperceived is an important factor in Ultra-perception.\nH. F.

For several years before the war the Society had made it a\npractice to investigate trance or \" clairvoyant \" mediums of whom\nfavourable reports were received from members of the Society, and\nreports received of Mrs Thomson from Glasgow seemed to him to\njustify an invitation to her to give sittings.\nFrom an account Mrs Thomson had given him of her mediumship\nit appeared that she first started going into trance about seven years\n\f110 J'onrnal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1941\nago : she was not at the time attached to any spiritualist circle or\nsimilar organisation, and was not suffering from the shock of any\nrecent bereavement.\nSince then she had been giving private sittings regularly in\nGlasgow, with occasional public performances. Her control,\nPeshanta, claims to be a Red Indian who lived in Dakota some\ncenturies ago.\nBefore the invitation to Mrs Thomson was given the Society had\nseen an account of an interesting anonymous sitting which Lady\nCulme Seymour had had with Mrs Thomson in Glasgow in October\n1940. She was accompanied by her son, Captain Culme. Seymour,\nR.N., who was in Glasgow on service duty. Her late husband,\nAdmiral Culme Seymour, was the purporting communicator and\nmade certain predictions regarding his son's service duties which\ncame as a complete surprise to the son, but turned out shortly\nafterwards to be correct. Captain Culme Seymour had been a friend\nof Mr Oliver Gatty, and when Peshanta spoke of a young man with\na name beginning with G., who wished to communicate, and tried\nthe name Gillespie, Captain Culme Seymour suggested that the name\nwanted was Gatty. Peshanta accepted this suggestion and then\nproceeded to give correctly the Christian names (Oliver and Penelope)\nof Mr and Mrs Gatty, and the fact that Mrs Gatty had a baby\ndaughter. As Mrs Gatty said in the discussion, she thought it\nextremely improbable that these facts were within the medium's\nnormal knowledge.\nIn view of the air raids to which London was at the time subject,\nit was arranged that the sittings should take place in Cambridge.\nMrs Thomson arrived in Cambridge on the 10th June and began the\nsittings, of which there were twenty, on the following day. On one\nday two sittings were held ; on the other days only one. The\nmedium had been accustomed to sit more frequently than this in\nGlasgow, and there is no reason to think that she was in any way\noverworked during her Cambridge visit. At the same time, although\nvery comfortably housed, she was from the start somewhat depressed,\nand it seems probable that the sudden change from one place to\nanother, combined with the inevitable restrictions imposed by war\nconditions, had a prejudicial effect on her mediumship. Possibly a\nconstant succession of sitters, all except one unknown to her, and\nchanging from day to day, contributed to the same result. What-\nsoever the cause, a regrettably large number of sitters reported that\nthey had had no success.\nThere were sixteen sitters, in some cases accompanied by friends,\nand of the sixteen the only one who had previously sat with the\n\fNov.-Dec. 1941 Private Meeting 111\nmedium was Lady Culme Seymour. Of the rest, all sat anonymously\nexcept Mr Salter, who had made arrangements for Mrs Thomson's\nvisit and had met her on her arrival. To make things easy for her\nhe arranged to take the first sitting the following afternoon.\nThe medium went easily into trance after a few minutes, and\nPeshanta came on the scene, speaking in a voice and manner not\nvery different from that of Mrs Thomson's. He occasionally inter-\njected short phrases in a language which he said was a rare Dakotan\ndialect. He was assisted by a band of young men who had been\nkilled in the last war, the leader of the band being Julian Grenfell.\nMr Salter said that several of his own relations and his wife's father,\nProfessor Verrall, had purported to communicate. What had been\nsaid about his own relations was not much to the point, but several\naccurate statements had been made about Professor Verrall, and\nreference was made to Mrs Verrall's automatic writing. The\nevidential value of this part of the sitting would obviously depend\non the extent to which the medium had normal knowledge of the\nVerralls, which would in fact have been easily obtained from litera-\nture on psychical research. Another communicator introduced was\nRupert Brooke, whom Mr Salter had known, though not intimately,\nfor several years. Here again a number of correct statements were\nmade, but it would be possible to find a normal source for them in\nRupert Brooke's own writings and in the Memoir of him published\nby Sir Edward Marsh : attempts he had made to \" draw \" the com-\nmunicator on unpublished incidents had met with no success.\nRaymond Lodge had also been introduced and spoke with the\ncheerful humour described in Sir Oliver Lodge's book Raymond.\nWith evident allusion to the famous sealed letter he said he hoped\nthat Mr Salter was not finding the baby too heavy to hold and\nadvised him to go slow with the tin-opener! At a second sitting,\nat the end of the series, Sir Oliver was represented as in personal\ncontrol and his well-known voice and manner were successfully\nreproduced.\nMr Salter said in conclusion that the uncertainty as to the medium's\nnormal knowledge of the personalities in question made it impossible\nto form an estimate as to the evidential value of the two sittings.\nAmong other sitters not present at the meeting, Mr Salter men-\ntioned Dr Thouless and Dr Mace as reporting incidents worthy of\nremark. Dr Thouless, for example, had been accompanied by a\nforeign scientist with whom he had been collaborating in some\npsychological experiments, and in their sitting reference was made\nto experiments which was reasonably appropriate to those in which\nthey had collaborated. Dr Mace noted that Peshanta seemed at\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research, Nov.-Dec. 1941\nsome loss whether to treat him as an academic person or as a farmer,\nhe being in fact a Don who had taken up farming as a hobby ; he\nthought however that these facts might have been inferred from the\nconversation he had had with the medium before the sitting.\nAnother member, Mrs Dickson, who lives near Birmingham, re-\nported that in Cambridge shortly before the sitting she had by\nchance met a friend who had evacuated herself to Cambridge after\nher own home had been bombed. At the sitting there seemed to\nher a clear reference to this chance encounter and the name by\nwhich the friend was ordinarily known was correctly given.\nIn the discussion which followed three of the sitters, Mrs Oliver\nGatty, Mrs Richmond and the Hon. Mrs Gay gave accounts of their\nexperiences. Mrs Gatty gave details of the Glasgow sitting in\nOctober, 1940, already mentioned, and gave her general impression\nof the medium and Peshanta. Mrs Richmond mentioned that\nPeshanta had correctly suggested that she was an automatist ; so\nfar as she knew, she and her husband were the only two automatists\nwho had sittings at Cambridge, and the suggestion had not been made\nwith regard to any of the other sitters. No connexion however had\nbeen drawn between her and her husband at their respective sittings.\nMrs Gay emphasized the importance of having a full note made\nof sittings, even if at the time they seemed to be completely un-\nsuccessful. In her own case she was glad that she had been able\nto make a fairly full note, as some of the information given at the\nsitting, although not at the time known by her to be true, had\nproved so on subsequent verification.\nAt several points in the discussion it was emphasized that it was\nmost desirable that the Society should get in touch with mediums\nat an early stage in their career, and before their mediumship has\nbeen adversely affected by a long contact with uncritical or inex-\nperienced sitters, and it was hoped that members would be prompt\nin sending in to the Society reports of any mediums of promise whom\nthey might come across.\nAmong the more interesting results recorded, the following episode\nfrom Mrs Gay's sitting presents a coherent picture :\nPart of Record of Mrs Gay's Sitting of 28 June 1941\nRecord Comment\nNow there is a David, who is This would be the airman son\nanxious to link up with lady.

He studied for a time at\nthe Marine Biological Laboratory at Plymouth, gave the Gifford\nLectures at Aberdeen University in 1907-1908, and at various times\nbefore and after the last war lectured at several other British Univer-\nsities. He was one of the few German men of learning who, early\nin the last war, resolutely resisted all official pressure to sign the\nnotorious manifesto whereby the achievements of British and French\nlearning were depreciated for the greater glory of the Fatherland.\nAfter the war, at the invitation of Mr Mikinskay, a former Czech\npupil and a member of the S.P.R., he lectured in Prague to a com-\nbined audience of German and Czech students, in an effort to create\nharmony between their hostile sections. In 1930 he presided with\neminent tact over the Fourth International Congress for Psychical\nResearch at Athens. It was inevitable that a man of such a wide\noutlook and so courageous a devotion to ideals should suffer when the\nNazis seized power, and soon after he was deprived of his Pro-\nfessorship.\nDriesch's life-work was concerned with the philosophy of science,\nwhich he approached from the special standpoint of the biologist.\nEmbryological experiments performed by him, particularly with the\nblastula of echinoderms, convinced him that the mechanistic view\nof life was untenable, as being unable to account for the adaptive\nand restitutive processes of living organisms.\nIn the endless war between vitalists and mechanists the terrain is\nconstantly shifting. In becoming a champion of vitalism, Driesch\nwas not content with any theory implying either the creation of\nenergy in the mechanical world by any non-mechanical factor, or\nthat such a factor could change the direction of mechanical forces :\neither view seemed to him at variance with the strictly limited\ncharacter of all adaptive or restitutive regulations. Starting with\nthe view that in any organism a large number of cells each had the\nsame great number of possibilities of developement physico-chem-\nically prepared, he suggested that a \" regulatory relaxing action\n\"\nchecked certain developments in certain cells and left others to pro-\nceed unchecked : to this process he gave the name of \" entelechy \".\nDriesch did not in any way base his biological theories on evidence\nderived from psychical phenomena : in The Problem of Individuality\n(1913) he spoke of possessing \" the highest admiration \" for \" the\nremarkable work done by the S.P.R.\", but described the phenomena\nas \" certain groups of rather problematic facts . . . which do not yet\nallow of any definite interpretation \". But, as is clear from his\nPresidential address (Proc. XXXVI, p. 171), and his book, Psychical\nResearch (reviewed in the Journal, Vol. XXVIII), he regarded the\n\fNov.-Dec. 1941 Obituary Notice 115\nresults of psychical research and vitalist theory as harmonising with\neach other.\nBy temperament as well as intellect Driesch was well qualified to\njudge what phenomena deserved acceptance. His own direct ex-\nperience was not, however, very extensive. In view of the special\ninterest he showed in the relations of the conscious and subconscious,\nas regards relative fulness of memory and otherwise, and in the\nquestion whether the phenomena required for their explanation\nsome mind more comprehensive than that of the individual, it is\nunfortunate that he had no opportunity for first-hand study of cases\nof non-pathological dissociation. A closer acquaintance with a line\nof research which has played a large part in our Society's work might\nhave enabled him to come to a more definite conclusion on the issue\nof personal survival.\nW. H. S.\nMRS L. K. G. CRANDON\nIn recording last year the death of Dr Crandon we referred to the\ncourteous hospitality which he and Mrs Crandon had shown to\nmany of our members visiting the United States. News of Mrs\nCrandon's death has now reached England. Whatever be the\nultimate verdict on her long and extremely varied mediumship,\n\" Margery \" is sure of a large place in the history of the psychical\nresearch of our generation.\nBOOKS FOR THE FORCES\nIn response to an appeal by a lady in charge of a mobile library for\nH.M. Forces, the Society is collecting suitable books on Psychical\nResearch for forwarding to her. Several members have already been\nso good as to send books written by themselves, and it has been\npossible to include in the collection some duplicate copies from the\nLibrary.\nIf any members can spare suitable books from their own shelves,\nwill they please send the names of the books to Miss Horsell. The\nbooks offered should be of some permanent interest, and not too\ntechnical. Any of the recommended books mentioned in the list\npublished by the National Book Society (copies obtainable from\nMiss Horsell) would be welcome.\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1941\nCASE : GREEK SCRIPT BY A CHILD OF FOUR\nThis case has been contributed by Dr Olive Hope, a Member of the\nSociety. The formation of Creek letters by a small child not yet\nable to write is a curious phenomenon, and the mental and motor\nprocesses involved are not easily ascribed to an accidental freak of\nchildish observation, memory and manual performance. The\ncontext supplied by the child's parents suggests a possible meaning\nand intention, exterior to the child's mind. It is interesting that a\nfurther Creek letter, required to complete a word which had been\nsuggested to the father's mind by the letters already written\nspontaneously, was added by the child, out of place, shortly after\na suggestion from the father that something was missing. This\ncould be attributed to a telepathic effect between father and child if\nit be assumed that a suitable motor impulse can be produced in this\nway : it seems difficult, however, to interpret the entire episode in\nterms of telepathy with the father as agent.\nDr Olive Hope wrote as follows :\nSt. Anne's Well,\nAndover, Hants,\nAug. 22, 1941.\nYou ask that members should report any unusual incident that\ncomes to their notice.\nDuring our holiday my husband and I visited the Rev F. Brown-\ning and his wife, friends of some years standing, at their home, The\nVicarage, Worth Matravers, Dorset.\nMr Browning spent many years of his life as a missionary. He is\nsomething of a mystic, but also a man of undoubted veracity, and a\nvery good witness. His wife has considerable ability as a portrait\npainter, so that \" Mary \", the child mentioned in the narrative,\nmight be expected to be sensitive. It appears that on a certain day\n(1939-1940, the child being then four years of age, and unable to\nform letters), her parents were gravely troubled over the question\nof sea-evacuation, and unable to make a decision.\nMrs Browning was writing letters, and Mary was scribbling, when\nher father entered the room and saw that she had formed what seemed\nto him to be a series of Creek letters.\nThis alleged writing of Greek was so unexpected in a child of four\nthat it crossed his mind that the writing might be a message from\nhis father, a distinguished Greek scholar, given through the hand of\nthe child, since the old gentleman had, in life, been in the habit of\ncommunicating with him in Greek.\nI do not myself know Greek, but I understand that the letters\n\fNov.-Dec. 1941 Greek Script by a Child of Four 117\nformed a word meaning \" See through \", or \" See beyond \"with\nthe exception of a missing letter p.\nWhile he was actually pondering this the child left her play, and,\nafter a few moments, returned and, with some uncertainty inserted\nthe \" missing \" letter at the wrong place at the beginning of the\nword.\nAccording to my recollection :\n(1) Mr Browning said to the child, a moment before she left her\nplay, \" Haven't you forgotten something, Mary.\" Other-\nwise nothing was said to influence the child, he spoke also\nto Mrs Browning, without, I understand, mentioning the\nletter.\n(2) There was no Greek lettering available from which she could\nhave practiced.\n(3) Nothing of the same kind has happened before or since.\nThinking the matter over I wrote to our friends, and asked Mr\nBrowning to send a statement. Owing to his illness Mrs Browning\nhas written, and the point that the missing letter was actually in\nthe father's mind when the child returned is not brought out in her\nstatement.\nIt seems to me of considerable importance. Unfortunately,\nregarding the matter entirely as a message from his father, Mr\nBrowning has cut away the surrounding scribble, retaining only the\npart of the page containing the lettering, which he has pasted in the\nBible.\nI do not know what value this case possesses and should be glad\nto hear your opinion.\nYours sincerely, Olive Hope.\nDr Hope enclosed the letter from Mrs Browning which she\nmentions. Omitting the opening in which she explains that Mr\nBrowning is laid up with a chill, we print Mrs Browning's account of\nthe case :\nThe Vicarage,\nWorth Matravers,\nDorset. Aug. 20th, 1941.\nDear Mrs Hope,\n... I have traced Mary's writing exactly as it is and Frank\n[Mr Browning] has just written the translation. If it isn't what you\nwant let me know. 1\nI sat down to write letters one afternoon and Mary came into the\nroom and said, \" I want to write a letter,\" so I gave her a sheet of\nwriting paper and a pencil to amuse her. She began scribbling and\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1941\nI took no notice until Frank came into the room, and exclaimed\n\" Mary is writing Greek !\" I immediately said, \" Is it a message\nfrom your father? \" Mary jumped down and started playing on\nthe other side of the room. Then whilst we were wondering about it\nshe came back, picked up the pencil and added the missing letter in\nfront. Then she went on with her playing and seemed quite un-\nconscious of the whole thing. We had been rather worried that day\nbecause I had had a cable from America asking us to send Mary to\nCalifornia and a letter from Frank's brother in Canada asking us\nto send her there.\nMary had never tried to write any letters in English, and she had\nnever seen any Greek, so it did seem amazing. She didn't start\nlessons until six months later when she was five and then she couldn't\nform any letters as well as she formed the Greek ones.\nFrank says his father always wrote in Greek if he wanted to say\nanything important or send a message, so he felt it was from him\nand was very much cheered. We didn't worry about the war after\nthat, but tried to see through to the spiritual realities. One old lady\nin the parish said to me soon afterwards \" I have a strong feeling\nthat we shan't be bombed whilst this vicar is in the parish.\"\nYours with love, Kathleen Browning.\nWe reproduce below, in its actual size, the tracing taken from the\nGreek letters by Mrs Browning. We have also correspondence from\nDr Olive Hope and her husband, Dr M. F. Hope, in which it is stated\nthat this tracing fairly reproduces the original and that in the original\nthe Greek letters are as clearly formed as in the tracing.\nThe accompanying comment by Mr Browning shows that he reads\nthis as Siopeze, \" see through \". This injunction appears to have\nbeen taken by the parents both in a general sense as suggesting a\nfar-sighted attitude in troublous times, and in a particular sense as\nadvice to examine thoroughly the proposal to evacuate the child,\nbefore coming to a decision. Mr Browning records the following\npoints :\n\" The Greek p was originally omitted by the child, and added by a\n\fNov.-Dbc. 1941 Greek Script by a Child of Four 119\nfresh impulse a few minutes after the writing of the other letters, 1\n(it will be realized that there was no room for it in its proper place).\nShe was four at the time and had not begun to learn to write. My\nFather, who passed away ten years previously, (her grandfather), in\nWestern Canada, was a great classical scholar, and constantly quoted\nGreek. After missing the p, her hand became a little shaky and the\nlast two letters are not quite so well formed as the others.\nW. F. Browning.\"\nAN APPARITION SEEN BY TWO WITNESSES\nIn his autobiography, Final Edition (pp. 257-8), Mr E. F. Benson\n(son of Archibishop Benson) recounts the following incident, which\nhappened at his house at Rye.\nAfter speaking of a curious psychic atmosphere which both he and\nseveral of his friends perceived in the house he continues :\n\" Then\n. . . this atmosphere became more personal ; there was something-\nthere. The presence was in no way perilous or malign . . . nor was\nit friendly ; it was entirely indifferent. Suddenly a curious thing\nhappened. Whether or no it betokened a visible manifestation of\nthe haunting presence, I have no idea.\n\" On a windless summer day two friends, of whom the Vicar of\nRye was one, were lunching with me and afterwards we strolled\ndown to the secret garden. It was a brilliant, broiling day and we\nseated ourselves in a strip of shade close to the door in the wall\nwhich communicated with the other garden. This door was open ;\ntwo of our chairs, the Vicar's and mine, faced it, the other had its\nback to it.\n\" And I saw the figure of a man walk past this open doorway.\nHe was dressed in black and he wore a cape the right wing of which,\nas he passed, he threw across his chest, over his left shoulder. His\nhead was turned away and I did not see his face. The glimpse I got\nof him was very short, for two steps took him past the open doorway,\nand the wall behind the poplars hid him again. Simultaneously the\nvicar jumped out of his chair, exclaiming, '\nWho on earth was that?\n'\nIt was only a step to the open door and there, beyond, the garden\nlay, basking in the sun and empty of any human presence. He told\nme what he had seen ; it was exactly what I had seen, except that\nour visitor had worn hose, which I had not noticed.\n1\nMr Browning apparently does not recall, when writing this, a fact men-\ntioned by Dr Olive Hope : according to her recollection of what was told\nher he made a suggestion to the child that she had \" forgotten something,\" and\nthe letter p was added by the child shortly after this suggestion was made.\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Nov. -Dec. 1941\n\" Now the odd feature about this meaningless apparation is that\nthe first time this visitor appeared he was seen simultaneously by\ntwo people whose impressions as to his general mien and his gesture\nwith his cloak completely tallied with each other. There was no\nlegend about such an appearance which could have predisposed\neither of them to have imagined that he saw anything at all, and the\nbroad sunlight certainly did not lend itself to any conjuring up of a\nblack moving figure. Not long afterwards it was seen again in\nbroad daylight by the vicar at the same spot ;\njust a glimpse and\nthen it vanished. I was with him but I saw nothing. Since then I\nthink I have seen it once in the evening on the lawn near the garden-\nroom, but it was dusk and I may have constructed some fleeting\ncomposition of light and shadow into the same figure. ... I have no\ndoubt whatever that the vicar and I saw something that had no\nexistence in the material world.\"\nThe then Vicar of Rye, the Rev. Prebendary John Fowler, has\nkindly replied to an enquiry from the Editor and given general\nconfirmation to Mr Benson's account. He adds :\n\" None of us three had, I believe, been thinking of '\nghosts '\n\u2014at\nany rate I had not and no word was spoken of them by any of us,\nthat\n1\nwindless summer day '. Why should '\nhe '\nbe there and with\na cloak too? But there are often these '\nWhys? '. I thought it was\nsome one, not some thing, and sprang up to see who he was.\"\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Question of Survival\nSir,\u2014I have read with much interest Mr Abdy Collins' paper in\nthe current issue of Proceedings. It happens that a further short\npaper of my own dealing with the same subject appears in this\nnumber.\nIt seems to me to be possible that Mr Collins may wish to make\nfurther criticisms of my views as expressed in this second paper,\nI therefore propose to postpone any comments which I have to make\nuntil he has had the opportunity to do so.\nYours faithfully,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nSir,\u2014On reading in the last issue of Proceedings the paper entitled\n\" Ambiguity in the Question of Survival \", I could not help but\nremark how the conclusions drawn depended more upon the author's\nopinions than upon the reasonings of the paper. The gist of Mr\nSaltmarsh's thesis appeared to be as follows :\n\fNov.-Dec. 1941 Correspondence 121\nMr Saltmarsh first pointed out that the question of survival might\nbe placed in either of two categories, according to the mode of\nformulation, viz. :\n(1) Questions which are unanswerable because they have no\nintelligible meaning,\nor (2) Questions which concern facts about which evidence is\navailable.\nHe explains that, for the purpose of his argument, the existence\nof any given thing is to be called its behaviour pattern, and then\nformulates the question of survival by asking whether the behaviour\npattern of a given individual (at a certain date in the normal time\nsequence), before death will sufficiently resemble the resulting\nbehaviour pattern (at a given instant in the same time sequence)\nafter death for the two to be considered as characteristic of the same\npersonality. Mr Saltmarsh then attempts to relegate this question\nto category no. 1, on account of the following ambiguities.\n(a) We have no criterion which enables us to decide what changes\nare compatible with historical continuity.\n(b) We have no knowledge of the nature of a pure psychical entity,\nexcept that it forms a mind when in combination with the\nphysical body.\n(c) We have no reason for assuming that unidimensional time\nwith an irreversible direction change exists in the world\nto come, or, indeed,\n\u2014\n(d) that such fundamental things as space, causation and logic\nexist there.\nMr Saltmarsh therefore reformulates the question by asking,\n\" Does physical death entail the complete destruction of the\npsychical entity in our minds? \" He consents to allow this question\nto rest in category no. 2, and indicates that in his opinion the\ncorrect reply is, \" No, not always, but what survives is very probably\nnot the '\nme I now recognise as myself ' \".\nMr Saltmarsh's paper is no doubt a perfect piece of logic, but its\nconclusions depend so much upon the validity of the \" ambiguities\n\"\ncited that it is worth considering them one by one.\n(a) Mr Saltmarsh contends that death must involve considerable\nchanges in the personality undergoing that process. (He gives us\nto understand that by personality is meant \" psychical character-\nistics and dispositions, intellectual, volitional, emotional, mnemic\nand so on \".) This contention appears to be merely a matter of\npersonal opinion, and is contrary to that of many of the psychical\nresearchers who base their views upon the results of mediumistic\n\fI\n-2-2\nJournal of Society for Psychical Research Nov.-Dec. 1941\ninvestigations. Somewhat later in his paper Mr Saltmarsh makes it\nquite clear upon what this expression of opinion rests. He questions\nwhether trance mediumship will ever permit a sufficiently clear and\ncomplete delineation of character to establish that the communi-\ncating entity is identical with the personality purporting to be\npresent. Moreover Mr Saltmarsh is pretty sure that, if the phe-\nnomenon of the direct voice does exist, it is only as a very brief and\nfugitive manifestation, incapable of carrying on sustained conver-\nsations. In the light of accounts of such trumpet mediums as\nValiantine this is a very curious suggestion. Whether or no the\nvoices heard at a trumpet seance are produced by the medium's\nlarynx is a comparatively small point, what is very evident about\nsuch seances is that the purporting surviving personalities are able\nto hold sustained (and veridical), conversations without the use of\nthe familiar intermediary or \" control \". I therefore feel justified\nin considering objection (a) irrelevant because I, (in common I\nbelieve with many other psychic researchers), cannot concur with\nthe opinion that any great change takes place in the personality\non the death of the physical body.\n(6) If the psychical is regarded as that part of the mind which can\nfunction independently of immediate bodily stimuli, we surely know\nsomething about it. Dreams, in the opinion of both the bulk of the\nSpiritualists, especially the believers in astral projection, and the\nindefatigable Mr Dunne, form a valuable clue. An endeavour to\nexplore the depths of the mind to which E.S.P. belongs seems\nfeasible. Mr Saltmarsh would appear to maintain that this sort of\nthing does not give a true picture of the purely psychical, because\nall knowledge, however attained, must rise to consciousness via the\nbrain, by which process it presumably becomes modified in some\nway. This amounts to an assumption that consciousness is entirely\ndependent upon the activities of the physical brain,\u2014a view which\ncomes suspiciously near to begging the question. In any case, what\nobjection is there under these circumstances to resorting to an\nexamination of the psychic entities themselves in order to find out\nwhat are the characteristics of the purely psychical ?\nMr Saltmarsh further contends that the synthesis of psychical\nand physical in the living organism is analagous to the synthesis of\ntwo elements into a single chemical compound ; and no investigation\nof a chemical compound as such will reveal the properties of its\nconstituent elements, since these are entirely different and inde-\npendent of those of the compound which they form. The analogy\ncan scarcely be perfect, since the living organism certainly possesses\nthe properties of its physical constituent .\n\fNov.-Dec. 1941 Reviews 123\n(c) The existence of a particular personality does not depend upon\nits having a time with an irreversible direction change. Foretelling\nfuture events does not alter the incarnate personality, and entrance\ninto a dream-like world in which past, present and future can be\nviewed at will does not entail the changing of the personality beyond\nrecognition. In other words the existence of a different type of time\nin the world to come is not a fact which renders the meaning of the\nquestion obscure.\n(d) I have already stressed the fact that niediumistic phenomena\nsupport the view that death, in so far as the personality experiencing\nit is concerned, is not such a drastic change as it appears at first\nsight. It is therefore an unnecessary complication, in my opinion\nat least, to postulate extraordinary states of affairs in the \" next\nworld \" (which there is no reason to believe exist in practice), merely\nbecause of their theoretical possibility.\nIn effect I have transferred Mr Saltmarsh's first question into\ncategory no. 2, so that his second question becomes unnecessary\nand so need not be considered.\nI am, Yours etc.\nDonald J. West.\nREVIEWS\nIt followsfrom ESP. By J. B. Rhine. The Journal of the American\nSociety for Psychical Research. Vol. XXXV, No. 6, Oct, 1941.\nDr Rhine expresses much diffidence in publishing this speculative\nessay on the implications of ESP, originally circulated privately\namong a small number of friends, but it should be welcomed by a\nwider circle of readers. Speculation, which is not pretentious, is not\nconfused with scientific inference, but simply and frankly reflects the\nthoughts of a man with outstanding practical experience of research,\nis of real value to our work, if we hope to be guided by a growing\nconception of the meaning of our facts. It is all the better if such\nspeculation is not hammered too diligently into seeming coherence,\nbut leaves gaps where there are gaps, showing where further know-\nledge needs to be sought.\nThe central conception about which Dr Rhine's thoughts revolve\nis that we appear to be confronted with events which can be experi-\nmentally caused to occur and are not subject to the spatial and\ntemporal laws associated with causation in the world of physical\nscience. (Extra-sensory events occur without regard for the ordinary\neffects of distance, or leap over an interval of time so that an experi-\nence belonging to the future may produce a reaction upon the mind\n\f124 Journal of Society for Psijchical Research Nov. -Dec. 1941\nand the physical nervous system in the present.) It is duly pointed\nout that independence of spatial law logically involves independence\nof temporal sequence, and vice versa. We thus have a \" spaceless\n\"\nand \" timeless \" order of mental event interacting with physical\nchanges in nerve cells which have spatio-temporal organisation : a\nstate of things which precludes any complete dualism of mind and\nbody, since systems which are ultimately different cannot interact.\nFrom this point, discussion ofthe psycho-physical problem must either\nbe desultory and inconclusive, recognising our lack of knowledge, or\nelse draw upon the inventive imagination : Dr Rhine prefers to leave\nhis speculations scrappy but within touch of conclusions from\nobservation and experiment, and at the same time leaves the reader\nat liberty to speculate in his own way. Some concluding thoughts on\nreligious and ethical conceptions suggest that the doctrine of an\nextra-physical self has at least incipient support from the evidence\nof extra-physical action provided by research into ESP, and that\nethical aims should gain in force and effectiveness as a wider con-\nception of personality comes within the range of practical scientific\nthinking.\nK.

The financial stringency is much greater ;\ndifficulties of travel make some kinds of research impracticable, and\n\fJan.-Feb. 1942 Annual Report of the Council for 1941 127\npreoccupation with war-work prevents many of our members from\nbeing as active in the Society's work as they would wish. The\nCouncil are glad to be able to report that along those lines of research\nwhich are still open good progress has been made.\n(1) Research. In the spring the Eesearch Officer, Mr C. V. C.\nHerbert, joined the Army. The Council are sure that all Members\nwill join with them in wishing him good fortune and success.\nUnder the auspices of the Cambridge Committee, Mr Whately\nCarington has been continuing his work on the Paranormal Cogni-\ntion of Drawings. An account of two major experiments, in one of\nwhich groups from ten British Universities took part, was published\nin the Proceedings for June (Part 164). Recent work has been\nmainly devoted to the development of a repeatable technique for\ngeneral use, and to the preparation of a Catalogue of all objects\ndrawn or mentioned in the course of the first seven experiments for\nuse in this connection. The results are encouraging, and it is hoped\nto issue the Catalogue shortly.\nThe experiments of Mrs Goldney and Mr Soal in Precognitive\nTelepathy have been continued throughout the past year with con-\nspicuous success. The earlier results, of which some account was\ngiven by Mr Kenneth Richmond in the Journal for June-July 1941,\nhave been confirmed and several new effects of striking interest have\nbeen demonstrated. The work is being carried out under conditions\nof control which have probably never before been equalled in the\nhistory of the subject. A number of persons of note have seen the\nexperiments and have recorded their impressions. The special\nthanks of the experimenters are due to Miss Elliott for her con-\ntinued co-operation, and to Mrs Woollard for much valued assis-\ntance.\nThe question of precognition has for some years been playing an\nincreasingly large part in the Society's researches, and the Council\naccordingly decided that the time had come to appoint a special\nCommittee to investigate the matter, and that there was no object\nto which the income of the Blennerhassett Trust could more suitably\nbe devoted. Mr Richmond was appointed Organising Secretary to\nthis Committee, which has carefully considered the best method of\nattacking this very difficult problem.\nThe first suggestion before the Committee was that further in-\nvestigation of precognition in dreams should be pursued, by methods\nof the kind which are described in Mr J. W. Dunne's An Experiment\nwith Time. After careful consideration it was decided that the\nmethod of comparing dream-images with subsequent spontaneous\nevents did not lend itself to accurate assessment of results by com-\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan. -Feb. 1942\nputation, but could only be expected to contribute further data to\nan already established prima facie case for precognition in dreams.\nTo obtain results capable of accurate assessment it was judged\nnecessary to compare the images arising in dreams with subsequent\nevents which should be under experimental control, and experiments\nare proceeding in which events for comparison with dream-images\nconsist in the presentation of drawings, the subjects of which are\nrandomly selected after the occurrence of the dreams.\nThis method has the advantage of linking up with the technique\ndeveloped by Mr Carington in his experimental work on the para-\nnormal cognition of drawings, and can also be applied to the assess-\nment of precognitive impressions occurring under experimental\nconditions otherwise than in dreams, as, for example, in waking\nreverie. Interesting results are also apparent from experiment with\na group of percipients who note any stray spontaneous impressions\nthat occur to them during a period of ten minutes, and compare\nthese with the subject of a drawing which is randomly selected,\nprepared and shown to them at the end of this period.\nIt is hoped to conduct further group experiments in connexion\nwith small meetings of those interested in the investigation : by\nthese meetings the Committee hopes also to enlist the help of a\nnumber of people in collecting good spontaneous cases of precogni-\ntion, properly attested, and in making touch with percipients who\nmay show any special precognitive abilities. While it is naturally\nimpossible to lay down a set scheme for the capture of spontaneous\nphenomena, the Committee regards the collection and study of such\nmaterial as of fully equal importance with that of evidence suitable\nfor numerical assessment.\nThe Trustees of the Kesearch Endowment Fund have agreed to\nbear part of the expenses arising from the Committee's enquiry and\nMr Soal's experiments, in addition to bearing the cost of the work\nof the Cambridge Committee.\nIn view of the highly specialised nature of quantitative research\ninto paranormal cognition, a special Committee of Reference and\nPublication has been appointed to scrutinise all papers mainly relat-\ning to quantitative research submitted for publication in Proceedings.\nMr Saltmarsh has kindly consented to undertake, in regard to such\nwork, the administrative duties ordinarily falling on the Hon.\nSecretary.\nIn the summer the Council invited Mrs Edith Thomson, a Glasgow\nclairvoyant medium of whom they had received favourable reports,\nto give sittings under the auspices of the Society. The sittings took\nplace in June in Cambridge. A report on them was read to the\n\fJan.-Feb. 1942 Annual Report of the Council for 1941 129\nSociety at a private meeting by the Hon. Secretary, and has been\nsummarised in the Journal for November-December.\nThe Council wish to thank several members of the Society who\nhave kindly contributed reports on other mediums.\nSpontaneous cases of various kinds have been reported to the\nSociety. Unfortunately it is in present conditions sometimes not\npossible for *a trained investigator to visit the scene of the occur-\nrence. The temporary breakdown in this respect of the Society's\norganisation has shown very clearly how greatly even well-educated\npersons need training in S.P.R. methods before they can handle\nsuch cases satisfactorily, either for the benefit of those who suffer\nfrom the phenomena of poltergeists and hauntings, or for the\nadvancement of knowledge.\n(2) Financial Positioyi. This has given rise to some anxiety. As\nmembers were informed in the last General Report, the tenancy of\nthe upper part of the building has lapsed and it has not been found\npossible to secure another tenant. There is therefore a loss of in-\ncome from this source. There has been, further, a substantial falling\noff in the income from subscriptions. On the other side of the\naccount there have been some small savings in expenditure, from\nrelief of rates and slightly lower printing costs, but against these\nmust be set added expenditure due to the war, such as repairs of\ndamage and premium on chattel insurance. The estimated deficit\nwould have been roughly \u00a3150 had not the Trustees of the Endow-\nment Fund agreed to bear the full cost of the Cambridge Committee's\nexperiments and made a contribution of \u00a3120 towards the cost of\nprinting the reports thereon, thus reducing the deficit by about\none half.\nAs for the future, it is clear that no immediate improvement in\nthe financial situation can be expected, and, although the assistance\nfrom the Endowment Fund has enabled the General Account to\nfinish the year without an overdraft at the Bank, a greater measure\nof support will be needed in the coming year unless expenditure be\ndrastically reduced. The only direction in which this could be\neffected is in printing, and the Council feel the greatest reluctance\nto limit this, seeing that it is by means of Proceedings and the\nJournal that members and the public are kept informed of the\nactivities of the Society and the results of the various researches\nwhich are being carried on.\nThe amount of assistance which the Endowment Fund can give\nis strictly limited by its own commitments, and should there be any\nfurther serious falling off in the income from subscriptions, it may\nbecome necessary to trench upon reserves.

During the year two former Presidents of the\nSociety, M. Henri Bergson and Prof. Hans Driesch, have died ; the\nCouncil also learnt the death, in the previous year, of Dr Elwood\nWorcester, the Founder of the Boston S.P.R. and a Corresponding\nMember of our Society, and of Dr J. F. Thomas, an American\npsychical researcher of distinction. Obituary notices of them have\nappeared in the Proceedings and Journal.\n(8) Library. During 1941 43 Members borrowed books, and 36\nbooks were borrowed by the National Central Library for Students.\nMembers also availed themselves of the privilege of borrowing books\nfrom other Libraries through the Society and the National Central\nLibrary.\n(9) Membership of the Society. Seventeen new Members have\nbeen elected. The total loss from deaths, resignations and other\ncauses is 34 Members and 13 Associates, leaving a net decrease of\n30 in the total membership of the Society, which now stands\nat 576.\n\f134 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1942\n(10) Publications.

The following Meetings have been held during\nthe year\n:\n26 Feb. Annual General Meeting.\n28 May. \" Jung's Conception of Personality, from the Point of\nView of Psychical Research \", by Dr H. Godwin\nBaynes.\n15 Oct. \" Recent Sittings with a Medium at Cambridge \", by Mr\nW. H. Salter.\nASSISTANCE BY MEMBERS\nMembers of the Society have on various occasions kindly offered to\nhelp in carrying on our work. There are two forms of assistance\nwhich the Officers of the S.P.R. would greatly appreciate at the\npresent time.\nFirst, there is note-taking at sittings. From the S.P.R. point of\nview sittings with trance or clairvoyant mediums lose most of their\nvalue unless a full note is kept of what is said both by the medium\nand the sitter. The ideal arrangement is for the note to be by a\nshorthand-writer with previous experience of this class of work,\nbut in present conditions this can seldom be realised. Many\npeople have, however, trained themselves to make notes in ab-\nbreviated longhand, which are of almost equal value, and it would\nbe a very great help if members who have practised this, and who\nwere willing to act as note-takers at sittings in their own neigh-\nbourhood, would send their names to Miss Horsell.\nThe second form of help is also of national importance, namely\nsalvage of waste paper. The Society has already handed over a\nlarge quantity, but there are in the files many old letters, dealing\nwith routine matters of no importance, which could well be dis-\nposed of, if they could be sorted out from other papers which should\nbe kept. This is too big a task for the Officers of the Society to\nattempt unaided. Offers of help in it would be most acceptable.\n\fJan.-Feb. 1942 135\nCASE : A DREAM SUGGESTING PRECOGNITION\nThe following case was sent to us by Lady Campbell, whose letter\ndescribing the episode is printed below with its accompanying cor-\nroborative statement.\nWoodrow High House,\nNr. Amersham, Bucks,\n27th December, 1941.\nThe Editor, Journal of the Society for Psychical Research.\nDear Sir,\u2014Since the war began I have had some dreams which\nare interesting to me as suggesting that Mr Dunne's theories are\nsupported by the facts. As you invite correspondence on subjects\nunder investigation by the Society, I will describe a dream, or\nsequence of dreams, which happens to have evidential value, as I\ntold it to others before events proved that it was prophetic. The\ndream was divided into three parts, and you will notice the curious\ncircumstance that the intervals between the parts of the dream\ncorrespond with intervals of time in the events themselves.\nMy daughter left a sanatorium, where she had been under treat-\nment for tuberculosis, and settled in a cottage in Bucks with her\ntwo children, the third week in September. 41. Her progress had\nbeen satisfactory, and she looked and felt very well, so that I was\nin a happy frame of mind about her. However, the cottage was\nunsuitable and she found another, nearer us, and was about to\nmove into it shortly, which pleased me.\nDream (a). During the week October 20-27, I dreamed that I\nwent to see her in the cottage (into which she was to move in a\nfew days). She was very reserved and I felt unhappy, and got up\nto leave as she did not seem to wish to talk to me. At the door I\nturned back to say goodbye. I realised that she was in great\ndistress of mind. I said, \" You are wretched, what is the matter?\n\"\nShe flung her arms around me, crying bitterly. I woke up sobbing,\nand my husband woke, and my maid in the next room heard me.\nI knew that something terrible had happened, but did not know\nwhat it was.\nDream (b). As soon as I had grasped the fact that it was only a\ndream, I went to sleep again. I then dreamed that I was in her\nbedroom, and she told me that she was infectious again.\nDream (c). There was a gap in the sequence, although I did not\nwake. The dream continued. She was crying terribly, and said,\n'\nThis time it is absolutely hopeless \".\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan. -Feb. 1942\nThe dream as a whole made a great impression on me, first because\nI recognised it as having the peculiar quality of other prophetic\ndreams I have had, second, because I am not subject to nightmares,\nand in fact cannot remember having had one for years. I told my\nhusband about it, and I told my maid.\nThe events following the dream were as below :\n(a) Shortly after my daughter arrived at the new cottage, I went\nto see her one afternoon. I found her looking quite well, but she\ndid not seem happy, and she had been resting as she said she had a\ncold.\n(b) Two days later she told me that she had seen the doctor who\nwas treating her, and he found that the disease was active again.\n(c) On November 9th the third part of my first dream was repro-\nduced in fact almost precisely. She was in bed and hysterical as I\nhad seen her, and said, \" This time, if it gets any worse, it is hope-\nless.\"\nI realise that subconscious anxiety about my daughter's health\nmight explain the sequence, but there are one or two points about\nit that are unusual, perhaps. It seems unlikely that I should dream\nthe words, \"This time it is hopeless \". The patient is not often told\nwhen the opinion of the doctor is so adverse, nor is a case of tuber-\nculosis ever hopeless until the final stages are reached, which was,\nof course, not the position in this instance. As you see, she qualified\nthe statement, in fact, by adding the words, \" if it gets any worse \",\nwhich I did not hear in my dream. The other peculiarity is the\ndivision of the parts of the dream, corresponding to divisions in\ntime.\nPlease make use of this material in any way you see fit.\nYours faithfully,\nHarriett R. Campbell.\nLady Campbell enclosed the following statement signed by Sir\nNigel Campbell and by her maid, who are mentioned above as hav-\ning been told of the dream-incidents before the corresponding events\noccurred :\nI can confirm the above statements, which are, to the best of my\nrecollection, in accordance with the facts as told me at the time.\nThe dreams were told me by Lady Campbell before the events\nrelated took place.\nNigel Campbell,\nKathleen Walsh.\n\fJan. -Feb. 1942 Correspondence 137\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Question of Survival\nSir,\u2014In Part 165, Volume XLVI of Proceedings, Mr Abdy\nCollins paid me the compliment of criticising at great length certain\nopinions on the Possibility of Proof of Survival which I expressed\nsome ten years ago ; I trust that he will not think me discourteous\nor unappreciative if I reply rather more briefly. I have two reasons\nfor not attempting to answer his criticisms in detail : (1) the paper\nshortage and the cost of printing make it desirable to be as eco-\nnomical of space as possible ; (2) it is clear to me that he has failed\ncompletely to understand the trend of my reasoning, though I should\nhave thought that my final conclusion, if nothing else in the paper,\nmade this perfectly plain. Let me quote what I said. \" A fairly\nstrong presumptive case might conceivably be made out were the\nevidence to be forthcoming in a sufficiently perfect state, but owing\nto the difficulties in estimating the probabilities of the various\nalternatives, no argument as to its actual strength is likely to be\nreached ; conviction will be, and seems likely to remain completely\nsubjective.\" Mr Collins appears to confuse conviction, which is\nsubjective, with proof, which is objective.\nMr Collins attacks with much vigour and at great length positions\nwhich I never occupied, so I do not conceive it necessary for me to\ndefend them, but there are one or two points on which I must\ntouch very briefly.\nThe theme song of his review, if I may so put it, is that I seek\nfor a single crucial case. Now this is completely incorrect. I do\nnot hold and never have held the view that proof or, indeed, con-\nviction of survival, as well as of many other hypotheses in psychical\nTesearch, can be based on a single case ; it must rest upon a cumu-\nlative effect of various types of evidence, and I should have thought\nthat this was abundantly clear to any unprejudiced critic of my\npaper. For example, after the paragraph quoted above I go on to\ndiscuss the theoretical possibility of the crucial case in contrast with\nthe \" presumptive case \" for survival based on evidence, and I say\nthat I do not know of such a case, moreover that were one to be\nfound the proof based thereon could only be provisional.\nMr Collins does, indeed, make a somewhat grudging admission on\npages 362 and 363 of my attitude in this matter, and actually quotes\ntwo or three passages which, to me at least, seem to leave no doubt\nabout it. Could I have said more than \" first, whether any com-\nbination of the various types of phenomenon would afford more\nconclusive evidence than when taken separately \", or that \" while\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1942\nan isolated case may afford but slender support for the survival\ntheory, the whole bulk of cases taken together supplies evidence of\nalmost irresistible strength \"?\nFor some obscure reason he makes the assertion that I limit the\nmultiplicity of types to two only ; if I took as an example an hypo-\nthetical case where there were only two types. I can assure him\nthat this was purely for the sake of simplicity and from my dislike\nof unnecessary verbosity. In my illustrations of the \" faggot\n\"\ntheory I actually used three. Anyhow the use of the term \"faggot\n\"\nshould have been sufficient, one does not call a bundle of two sticks\na faggot.\nFinally, I think the matter may be set completely at rest by one\nfurther quotation from my discussion of the faggot theory. On\npage 121, I said, \" the increase in the number of cases may, if they\nare all different, largely increase the evidence for survival \".\nMr Collins adopts what seems to me to be a very odd theory. He\nappears to think that the importance of a statement is somehow\nrelated to the amount of space which the author allots to it ; for ex-\nample, on page 363 he says that I \" give it very little space \", and\non page 370, \"Mr Saltmarsh devotes one short paragraph only to it \".\nI should like to make it quite clear that the meanings of my state-\nments bear no relation to the number of words which they contain.\nIf I say that the strength of the evidence is largely increased I\nmean precisely that the strength of the evidence is largely increased,\nnothing less and nothing more. My aim in writing has always been\nto express my meaning in as short and unambiguous a manner as\npossible, and not to wrap up my points in a mass of unnecessary\nverbiage. May I say, without offence, that I wish that this principle\nwere more generally adopted?\nIn another place Mr Collins dismisses one of my points as an\n\" afterthought \". I wonder how he managed to arrive at so intimate\na knowledge of what my mental processes were when writing that\narticle ten years ago. Anyhow, I might recall to his mind the say-\ning that second thoughts are best.\nHe is very severe in his strictures on my use of mathematics. My\npuny efforts in this direction were about on the level of a fourteen-\nyear-old schoolboy ; if he is annoyed by them, imagination boggles\nat the spectacle of the paroxysms of rage which must sweep over\nhis soul when he reads some of the recent statistical investigations.\nPersonally, my regret is that I was unable to make greater use of\nmathematics.\nMr Collins clearly does not approve of me or of my opinions, but\nas he appears to include in his displeasure most of those engaged in\n\fJan. -Feb. 1942 Correspondence 139\npsychical research, I am satisfied with the company in which I find\nmyself.\nThe gist of the paper is, of course, that so long as alternative\nhypotheses are theoretically possible and while the relative proba-\nbilities are not assessable with any degree of precision, owing to the\ninapplicability of mathematical treatment, proof of survival, in the\nsense that the probability of that hypothesis greatly exceeds that\nof any possible alternative, cannot be attained on the data at present\navailable, and that conviction or otherwise must depend on sub-\njective estimates. The fact that there actually exists so wide a\ndivergence of opinion on the matter among equally competent and\nhonest students seems to me to be sufficient a posteriori grounds\nfor holding that this conclusion is justified.\nIn conclusion I must touch briefly on one further point. Mr\nCollins several times complains that there is no evidence for the\nalternative hypothesis which I suggest. Here again I fancy that he\nis somewhat confused, and that what he really means is that there\nis no independent evidence. Of course, independent evidence for an\nexplanatory hypothesis is not essential, though it may be desirable.\nIn the absence of a priori impossibility, the phenomenon for which\nan hypothesis provides a logical explanation is itself evidence for it.\nThe only question which arises is as to the probability of that hypo-\nthesis in relation to other possible alternatives and its antecedent\nprobability or improbability. There are, indeed, many instances\nwhere, from the nature of the case, independent evidence is impos-\nsible to obtain\u2014for example, the hypothesis of the expanding uni-\nverse. Alternatives may be found, but as there is only one universe\nthere is nowhere to look for independent evidence.\nI must now turn to Mr West's letter in the recent issue of the\nJournal, in which he criticises my paper on \" Ambiguities in the\nQuestion of Survival \", Proc., Part 165, Vol. XLVI. This merits\nrather more detailed consideration.\n(a) Mr West has completely ignored my main grounds for the con-\nclusion that death involves a considerable change in the personality.\nThese are what might be called the medical evidence, also that from\nabnormal psychology, such as dual personalities and a certain\namount from normal psychology, e.g. subliminal mentation and so\non. I might have added evidence from cerebral lesions and restitu-\ntion of function, but as this is so highly technical I refrained from\ndoing so.\nIf it be admitted, as I think it must be, that our manifested per-\nsonality is influenced to a very considerable extent by the condition\nof our endocrine glands, by illness and fatigue, that a man's mani-\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1942\nfested moral and intellectual character may be radically changed by\ndrugs or cerebral lesions, it appears to me to be an unavoidable con-\nclusion that the physical organism contributes a considerable share\nin the \" me which I now recognise as myself \". The physical organ-\nism is destroyed at death and, presumably, its influence vanishes.\nThe only means by which the personality could be maintained un-\nchanged after the loss of one of the partners seemed to me to be\nthe provision of a substitute. I discussed the substitute hypothesis\nand, though I admitted that it was logically tenable, I put forward\nreasons which, in my opinion, made it difficult to accept. In that\nrespect only can I agree with Mr West that my conclusions are\nbased on my opinions, and I think I made it quite clear that this\nwas so.\nPossibly\u2014I might, in view of certain remarks which he makes,\nsay probably\u2014Mr West holds some form of substitute hypothesis.\nIf this be so the issue between us is clear-cut. If he can produce\ngood evidence of the existence of such a substitute I am quite pre-\npared to reconsider my position, but until such evidence is forth-\ncoming it remains a purely explanatory hypothesis and must stand\nor fall on the balance of probability, a balance which, in my opinion,\nis heavily against it.\nI did not, as Mr West states, base my conclusions about the change'\ninvolved by death on evidence from mediumistic seances. I cited\nthis evidence solely for the purpose of showing that our sources of\nknowledge concerning the characteristics of disembodied spirits, if\nsuch there be, are inadequate for supplying full and accurate in-\nformation.\nI will not here enter into any controversy concerning the validity\nor otherwise of the claims of the ostensible communicator in\nmediumistic seances, as I feel sure that nothing of value would\nemerge therefrom. The subject is so large, so complex and the\nbattlefield has been fought over so many times, that a small-scale\nengagement, such as could be undertaken in the columns of the\nJournal, could yield no results. I would, however, like to point out\nthat the phenomenon of Direct Voice seems to me to be a rather\nunfortunate choice on Mr West's part. Though by no means an\nenthusiast for the Variety Stage, I have heard sufficient of the\nB.B.C. programmes to know that imitation of a voice is a com-\nparatively common accomplishment. It is the matter, not the\nmanner which counts most. I admit, of course, that a really con-\nvincing imitation of the voice would afford collateral evidence of\nidentity.\nBut I am inclined to be rather sceptical as regards the opinions of\n\fJan. -Fee. 1942 Correspondence HI\nsitters as to the verisimilitude of the Direct Voice ; the conditions\nof a seance are, as a rule, not favourable to cold, unbiased judge-\nment and, in particular, when a trumpet is used and some amount\nof distortion naturally to be expected, the allowance made for that\ndistortion is, I should say, liable to be far too generous.\nHowever, as my case does not rest upon these phenomena, it does\nnot seem necessary to discuss the matter any further.\n(b) I do not know of any valid grounds for assuming, as Mr West\ndoes, that in dream the psychical is functioning independently of\nthe physical organism ; in fact all the evidence seems to support\nthe opposite view. I must protest against the statement which he\nmakes that I assume that \" consciousness is entirely dependent\nupon the activities of the physical brain \". I do nothing of the sort.\nThe whole tenour of my argument is that the mind, which is the\nseat of consciousness, is a joint affair in which both psychical and\nphysical play a part. I do not deny consciousness to the pure\npsyche ; all I say is that \" we do not know, even, whether it is con-\nscious in the sense in which we speak of consciousness \" (page 353).\nOf course, if Mr West is in the position to examine \" psychical\nentities themselves in order to find out what are the characteristics\nof the purely psychical \", it would be an excellent thing if he would\ndo so and make known his discoveries, but I do not quite see where\nhe is to find such entities, pure and unalloyed, or how the examina-\ntion is to be made.\nI could wish that my critics would not put into my mouth state-\nments which I did not make. Mr West says that I\n<;\ncontend that\nthe synthesis of psychical and physical ... is analogous to ... a\nsingle chemical compound \". What I actually said was :\n\" We do\nnot know the mode of combination, whether it is analogous to a\nmixture or a chemical compound \" (page 353). I discuss each\nalternative. He points out quite rightly that the analogy is not\nperfect. But analogies never are perfect ; if they were the two\ncases would be identical, not analogous.\n(c) Mr West has misunderstood my references to time. The ques-\ntion of survival as I formulated it assumes a single time sequence ;\nsurvival is a matter of \" before and after \" an event in that sequence.\nIt seems clear to me that if this assumption be disallowed\u2014and I\nconsider that there are grounds for disallowing it\u2014the question of\nsurvival is rendered ambiguous. For example, if there should be a\nsecond dimension of time, I suppose that we could survive in one\ndirection and perish utterly in the other, our existence could persist\nin \" thwart-ships \" time even if it ceased in \" fore and aft \" time.\nMr West says, \" the existence of a particular personality does not\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1942\ndepend upon its having a time with an irreversible direction \". I\nnever said that it did, but I find it very difficult to imagine what a\npersonality and what its conditions of existence would be like if its\ntime were to go about in all directions. The quest for such a per-\nsonality seems to me as hopeless as looking for an unimaginable\nneedle in an inconceivable haystack.\n(d) I do not think that it is necessary to comment on this, it is\nmerely the conclusion which Mr West draws from the opinions which\nhe has expressed in the preceding paragraphs, and I have given\nsome of my reasons for holding that those opinions are erroneous.\nI would like to point out that if, as he admits, there is a theo-\nretical possibility \" that death involves change in the personality,\nsome amount of ambiguity in the question of survival is bound to\nexist until we know with accuracy what that change is.\nThe final difference between Mr West and myself boils down to\nthis : he holds, apparently with complete conviction, that the per-\nsonality, as manifested in this life, will survive bodily death and\nthat it will persist almost unaltered in spite of the absence of the\nphysical organism, whereas I hold that there is a balance of prob-\nability\u2014how large a balance I am not prepared to say\u2014that the\npsychical element in personality is not entirely destroyed by death,\nthough I have no means of knowing what that psychical element\nmay be like.\nHe pays me the compliment that my paper \" is no doubt a perfect\npiece of logic \". I would like to point out, however, that I ventured\nthe opinion that \"we do not know whether the laws of logic have\nany jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of our own world \". My inten-\ntion in this paper was to attempt to examine the situation as far as\nlogical analysis would carry me ; what lies beyond that is the con-\ncern of other faculties. It is not only Hitler who possesses intuition,\nbut, unlike him, I prefer to retain my intuitions for strictly private\nconsumption and not to permit them to become public nuisances.\nYours, etc.,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nSir,\u2014In Mr Saltmarsh's paper (Part 165, Vol. xlvi, Proceed-\nings), dealing with ambiguities of survival, the following definition\nis given of what survival of death is supposed to mean for most\npeople. \" If there be a behaviour-pattern of that characteristic\nkind which is commonly called man and it undergoes the change\nknown as physical death at a certain date in the normal time-\nsequence, will there be, at a later date in the same time-sequence,\na behaviour-pattern, exhibiting a sufficient number of human char-\n\fJan.-Feb. 1942 Correspondence 143\nacteristics to be considered a personality, which is historically\ncontinuous with that man? \"\nWhether or not this is what most people mean by survival, it is\nnot at all clear to me why reality should conform to it ; for it\nappears to assume that time, as we know it, must necessarily be a\nfeature of another life. One wants to know, in any case, what Mr\nSaltmarsh means by \" later in the same time-sequence \". Does he\nmean that the surviving person is necessarily still living in our\ntime : or does he mean that the surviving person, though no longer\nliving in our time, must manifest himself to us, with his habitual\ncharacteristics, at a later date in our time, if we are to admit that\nhe \" still \" exists? Here I venture to suggest that Mr Saltmarsh\nhas raised more ambiguity than he has laid. How could a person\nalive, but not in time (or not in time as we know it), manifest him-\nself to us except by re-entering time as a co-operator with, and\ncommunicator through, some living person? But that is a re-\nappearance in time and does not clear up the difficulty about what\nis meant by his \" still \" existing non-temporally at a later date in\nour time.\nAgain, the mention of historical continuity as a test of self-\nidentity breaks down unless the surviving person is still in our\ntime. What does historical continuity mean if he is not? Because\nMr Saltmarsh uses the test of historical continuity, I assume that\nhe means that survival of death involves continued existence in\nour time. What justification has he for making this assumption?\nE.S.P., now established beyond all reasonable doubt, does not\nappear to be, in essence, either a temporal or spatial process ; and\nI question very much whether it is compatible even with the view\nthat space and time are self-existing realities. It would be interest-\ning, and I think, profitable if Mr Saltmarsh or someone else would\nput forward a view of E.S.P showing it to be reasonably compatible\nwith this latter theory. The point is crucial. To my mind it looks\nvery much as if E.S.P. is going to involve us in something very\nlike the Kantian view of space and time, namely that they are\n\" forms of our sensibility \" and not self-existing realities at all. If\nthis latter is the case, there seems little likelihood that we should\ncarry them over with us to another world, since they would be\nbound up with the psycho-physical machinery producing our\npresent perceptions.\nAgain, if this view is true, there is something supra-temporal in\nus already, and immortality of some kind would appear to be a\nnecessary corollary, since no meaning could be attached either to\nthe beginning or cessation of an existence which is not in time.\n\f144 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb. 1942\nA further possibility is that if space and time are \" forms of our\nsensibility \", they need not be the only forms. An alteration of\nthe personality might result in the creation of something different\nfrom space and time, yet having a family resemblance to them.\nThe whole matter, I suggest, is at present entirely fluid.\nYours faithfully,\nG. N. M. Tyrrell.\nSir,\u2014I hesitate to enter the field of controversy and challenge\nmy friend Mr Saltmarsh on account of his very able paper on\n\"Ambiguity in the Question of Survival \" (Proceedings, Sept. 1941).\nIt is not an easy task because his lucidity of style, firm handling of\nlogic, and transparent sincerity constitute a massive block of con-\nvincing power which is almost irresistible. But his main argument\nseems to rest on an assumption of the relation between soul and\nbody which is very doubtful, and which, so far as I can see, must\nin the end seriously handicap psychical research.\nI will therefore try to elucidate this point as briefly as possible\nin order to draw attention to the fact that all investigation con-\ncerning the human psyche and its activities must finally reach a\nstage where we have to consider the problem which since early\ndays engaged philosophy, i.e. the enigma of the soul.\nIn opening his main argument Saltmarsh gives the dictum : \"we\nhave no knowledge of the pure psychical apart from the physical.\"\nIs that really so? In such a case we would hardly be entitled to\nuse the definite terms soul or psyche, because the meaning remains\nutterly obscure. The tendency in modern times to avoid speaking\nof a soul in man is partly based on a materialistically tinted idea\nthat we only know about life of the soul through its connection\nwith a body, and it has brought us to' employ a substitute we label\n\" mind \" which Saltmarsh persistently uses. J. S. Mill said mind\n\" was the mysterious something which feels and thinks \". This\nterm, which originally was connected with memory, has under the\npressure of physical aspects been given much wider meaning and\ncloser contact with the brain. It is, however, nothing but a con-\nvenient fiction which is misleading, because the mind is no indi-\nvidual organ or entity, but a term used to indicate a composite\nexpression of interaction between soul and body, a result of com-\nbination between the parts that constitute our personality.\nSaltmarsh further states that \" the most intimate knowledge to\nwhich we ever attain of our conscious states is mediated through\nour brain \". The brain seems, however, to constitute nothing else\nthan a telegraphic exchange, as Henri Bergson said, and it is\n\fJan.-Feb. 1942 Correspondence 145\nneither the seat of consciousness nor of thought or memory. Even\na cautious brain-physiologist like Sherrington shares this view.\nThe brain has been dethroned from its lofty position and endowed\nwith the humbler task to serve as a means of communication for a\nlimited number of impressions and expressions.\nThe consciousness of existence, our awareness of being alive, to\nuse the Cartesian formula, is not dependent on our brain. The\nmeaning of thought, has no physiological correlate. Even people\nwho to a great extent lack means of contact through the senses\nmay show a vitality which is astounding. Our inner life, dreams,\ncontemplations and religious feeling, intuition and creative imagina-\ntion need no interference from the brain to become conscious to\nourselves ; on the contrary, psychic events bear out that they enter\nthe consciousness at moments when brain activity is low. The\nbrain is set in motion whenever consciousness contacts the exterior\nworld. The subtle attraction between people at first meeting, or\neven at distance from each other, without sensory contact, is no\noriginal result of brain-activity. Occurrences outside the frame of\ntime need no use of brain. I think Wundt was the first to prove\nthat the brain remains at rest during the short moment of a choice,\nbut starts functioning when it has been taken.\nIt is in any case not proved that Saltmarsh's basic argument is\nincontestable. It is quite true that the Mystics had great difficulty\nin transcribing visions, but their consciousness of the experiences\npossessed a force that influenced vast regions and epochs.\nThe impression we receive from modern scientific research\nrenders an entirely new picture of the relation between soul and\nbody than the one which has prevailed among people in general,\nand one understands that the Nestor of physicists in our day, Max\nPlanck, the originator of the Quantum Theory, could support the\nopinion that \" the new physics offers a contribution to the old\nmetaphysical problem of the relationship between body and soul \".\nWhen solid matter has been transformed into pure energy and\nmovement of waves in magnetic fields, and the brain is observed\nfunctioning through the influence of operating wave-bundles that\nflit across the cortex, then we approach the view that a soul acts\non a body by means of radiations which either through the brain\nor otherwise set the body and its organs in motion. It is of interest\nto note that F. W. Myers already in 1888 embraced the wave-\ntheory :\n\" We are learning to consider the human organism as a\npractically infinite complex of interacting vibrations \" {Proceed-\nings, Vol. 5, p. 526).\nThe question regarding survival takes on another aspect under\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research Jan.-Feb, 1942\nsuch conditions. We become inclined to say that man is a soul,\nnot that he has a soul. The body becomes a non-material equip-\nment and the brain and the Active mind disconnected from the\nsensation of consciousness. Some part of Salt-marsh's reasoning\nfalls to the ground if this view holds good.\nIt means that the sensation of consciousness ever remains al-\nthough physical and psychical qualities of the individual change.\nThis pure timeless consciousness is in itself unchangeable, but its\ncontents, its impressions of the changing self, may vary. I find\nthe \" me which I now recognise as myself\" very different from\nan earlier self. People also differ very widely as to what they think\nconstitutes their \" me \". That is a matter of opinions which often\nare erroneous. Some of us would not consider a perishable body\nto be part of the \" me \", and many act in life upon this conviction.\nIt is, after all, very difficult to judge what should be accepted as\nthe \" me \". The Delphic Oracle warned :\n\" Know Thyself\", but\nhow many of us have attained it ? We know only little about our-\nselves and others less. Saltmarsh's definition becomes ambiguous.\nWhat else shall survive except pure consciousness of being if\nbodily characteristics and earthly influences on the soul become\ndiscarded? The answer would be that unchanged original, pre-\nnatal features of soul and acquired experiences remain as they\nbelong wholly to the soul. In most cases they would become recog-\nnisable after departure from this place, but not always, and a\ndeparted soul may develop in another life, abolishing some char-\nacteristics we found typical.\nThe problem becomes still more complicated if we accept the\nview of Neo-Platonists, Erigena, certain Mystics and possibly St\nPaul, that the \" me which I now recognise as myself \" is only a part\nof my real self, and that the \" I \", the earthly fragment, the soul,\nmay after death rejoin the spirit, the spark divine, of which \" I\n\"\nbecome conscious after life on earth has spent its course. Modern\npsychical research rather approaches this view as we rightly con-\nceive that \" superconscious \" influences effect our conscious-\nness.\nWe evidently reach the conclusion that proofs of survival based\non recognition of individual characteristics are far from certain.\nBut when recollections of incidents which are unknown to the\nreceiver arrive from the beyond and are verified then proof is at\nhand, and such proofs are available.\nWhen we discuss the question of survival we must first ascertain\nwhat we mean with the terms we use or matters become confused.\nIn this respect I fully agree with Saltmarsh, and he has added\n\fJan.-Feb. 1942 Reviews 147\nanother service to the many he has rendered to our work through\npointing out ambiguities which he wishes to eliminate. Even if\none disagrees with some of his assertions, one fully recognises the\neffort to bring clarity and raise the standard of debate to a level\nwhere results may be harvested.\nYours faithfully,\nErik Palmstierna.\nJan. 1942.\nREVIEW\nThe Scientific Claims of Psychical Research. By the late Captain\nC. H. B. Gowan, R.N. The Hibbert Journal, Vol. XL, No. 1.\nOct. 1941.\nScience has now reached a position from which the irreducible\nfacts of existence are seen on the one hand as what the layman calls\nenergy and the physicist describes as \" action \", and on the other\nhand as the imponderable activity which gives rise to the concept of\nmind. The late Captain Gowan's essay points to the literal \" anni-\nhilation \" of matter as having necessitated a new outlook. \" Thence-\nforward the way lay clear for the re-establishment of Idealism\u2014and\nan idealism founded upon established fact.\" For the evidence that\ncompels a realisation of the place of mental action in our total world\nof actuality has also been springing up as a result of scientific method,\nin psychology (as McDougall untiringly pointed out) and in psychical\nresearch. The new outlook, however, has to get past the resistances\nof the new orthodoxy which no longer persecutes, but ignores.\nThe absurdity is emphasised of a situation in which science can\nofficially disregard the evidence which accredited scientists accept.\n\" This, though absurd enough, is a serious matter ; for it is causing\na bottle-neck which at a critical period in human history is' holding\nup the co-ordination and diffusion of knowledge of vital importance.\"\nThe suggestion is made that a juridical authority might be appointed\nto examine and pronounce upon the testimony of psychical research ;\nbut it is not easy to see what accepted authority would do the\nappointing. Philosophers may eventually be able to drive home the\nissue, and mention is made of the president's and Professor Broad's\n\" well-nigh perfect prolegomena to the subject \" in the issues of\nPhilosophy for Oct. 1940 and Oct. 1938. But as with science, official\nphilosophy tends to turn an officially vacuous eye upon the exciting\nmaterial at its hand.

S.\nCollins, Miss Corry, Dr E. J. Dingwall, Miss Fanshawe, Mrs Oliver\nGatty, Mrs K. M. Goldney, Mrs Frank Heywood, Mr A. D. Howell-\nSmith, Mr S. G. Howell-Smith, Sir Lawrence Jones, Bart., Mr Shane\nLeslie, Miss I. Newton, Mrs Norman, Mr G. Redmayne, Miss Reutiner,\nMr W. H. Salter, Mrs Tayleur, Mr G. N. M. Tyrrell ; and Captain\nN. M. Parsons (Associate) and Mr Kenneth Richmond (Hon Associate).\nThe Hon Secretary having read the Notice convening the Meeting,\npresented the accounts, together with the Report, and in the absence of\nthe Hon Treasurer read the following report from him :\nThe Accounts of the Society up to 31 December 1941 might be con-\nsidered satisfactory in the difficult circumstances. The General Fund\nended the year with practically the same balance in hand as it had at the\nbeginning, thanks to assistance received from the Endowment Fund. This\nFund, besides assisting the General Fund, had been able to increase its\ninvestments by \u00a3200.\nThe prospects for 1942, however, were not so bright. The estimated\nincome of the General Fund would be able to meet all current expenditure\nwith the exception of printing and postage, and leave a balance for that\nitem of only about \u00a3~o. The maximum assistance which the Endowment\nFund would be able to give will be roughly \u00a3250, thus bringing the total\nsum available for printing up to \u00a3320, some \u00a340 less than was spent last\nyear. Unless, therefore, the publication of Proceedings was considerably\nreduced\u2014a course which is considered to be very undesirable\u2014it might\nbecome necessary to trench upon reserves. However, as things looked\nat the time, the inYoad would be small and it might turn out to be un-\nnecessary.\nThe Chairman moved the adoption of the Annual Report and the\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research march-april 1942\nAccounts of the Society, which had already been circulated in the January-\nFebruary Journal. This resolution was seconded by Miss Newton, and\ncarried unanimously.\nA discussion followed, in which several members took part.\nMrs Gatty spoke of the desirability of getting more publicity for our\nactivities in the ordinary Press ; she felt that the public wanted general\ninformation on our subject.\nDr Dingwall said this point had often been raised. Psychical Research\nwas entering a new phase. The Society at the moment was the only\nbody in this country likely to deal with the scientific aspect of psychical\nresearch, and the Society's work on the statistical side was, he. knew,\nattracting much attention from scientists, but the amount of public\ninterest in this side of S.P.R. work, which he thought the most important,\nwas almost nil. The Society could not supply newspapers with chatty\nstories\u2014we could supply them with thrilling material but it was not the\nkind of thing the public wanted. If some of our statistical work were\nput into popular language he thought it would have a considerable effect.\nMr Tyrrell said he had got in touch with the Editor of Time and Tide\nwith regard to E.S.P., but their reply was that the subject was far too\nheavy for them. He did not see how one is to deal with E.S.P. for the\naverage popular reader. Dr Dingwall agreed with Mr Tyrrell.\nThe Chairman announced that there were no candidates for election\nto membership of the Council other than the six members who retired by\nrotation. On the proposal of Mr Salter, seconded by Mr Howell-Smith,\nthe following six members were accordingly unanimously elected : The\nRt Hon The Earl of Balfour, Sir Ernest Bennett, M.P., Sir .Lawrence\nJones, Bart, Mr H. F. Saltmarsh, Mr S. G. Soal and the Rev C. Drayton v\nThomas.\nMessrs Miall, Savage, Avery & Co were re-elected Auditors for the\nforthcoming year.\nPRIVATE MEETINGS\nThe 173rd Private Meeting of the Society was held in the\" Society's\nLibrary on Wednesday, 25 February 1942, after the Annual General\nMeeting, The Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton in the Chair.\nMr Richmond spoke on the work of the Precognition Committee\n(Blennerhassett Benefaction), and described some results of experimental\nwork on precognition by a group of percipients. About a dozen percipi-\nents, in the same room, recorded by writing or drawing, during a silent\nperiod of ten minutes, whatever images of single concrete objects happened\nto arise spontaneously in their minds, the suggested aim being that they\nshould record precognitive impressions of objects which were presently to\nbe shown to them in the form of drawings. The technique linked up with\nMr Carington's, described by him in Experiments on the Paranormal Cogni-\ntion of Drawings (Proc, Part 164, June 1941), and the Committee had had\nthe advantage of Mr Carington's help both in devising and in assessing\nthe results of the present experiments.\nAt the end of each ten minutes' period a random selection was made of\nthree folded slips from among a number of similar slips, each bearing\n\fMARCH-APRIL 1 942 Private Meetings 153\nthe name of some object. The experimenter then made a rapid drawing\nof each of the three objects thus selected and showed the drawings to the\npercipients. The unused slips were later returned, unseen by the experi-\nmenter or the percipients, to Mr Carington who had supplied the original\npacket of slips and alone knew what was written upon those that remained\nunused.\nAs a result of the first '\nfull-dress '\nexperiment, made at the S.P.R.\nRooms, Mr. Carington computed the hits on the precognition-targets\nas representing odds of over 1000 to i against chance. But inferences\nfrom this figure were modified by the discovery that a significant propor-\ntion of hits had also been made on the '\ntargets '\nwritten upon the unused\nslips, and represented odds of about 500 to 1 against chance.\nA repetition of the experiment, about a month later and with a few\nchanges in the list of percipients, showed a surprising result. On com-\nputation, the hits on the precognition-targets were found to be slightly\nbelow chance expectation\u2014not to r significant extent\u2014while the hits on\nthe unused slips had soared to odds against chance of over 10,000 to 1.\nIt was as though the group had stampeded away from the aim suggested\nto them and had made a united rush for another paranormal outlet which\nhad been found open in the earlier experiment. It had to be borne in\nmind that in computing these results the odds were calculated from a\nrelatively small number of impressions recorded by the percipients\u2014about\n600 in the two experiments ; but even so, chance fluctuations seemed\nunlikely to have risen to such a level as the figures would indicate.\nThe question of cross-telepathy between the percipients had also to\nbe considered : inspection showed a large number of correspondences\nbetween the percipients' images, some of the images, also, having occurred\nto three or four percipients, but further calculation was needed to decide\nwhether these effects were significant. *Mr Richmond mentioned several\ncases suggesting correspondence of idea and mental process between\npercipients : in one instance, a percipient had drawn a Viking's helmet,\nand so named it in writing. A little later she drew a horn and wrote\nbeside it :\n\" Drinking horn\u2014Vikings again! \" Another percipient drew a\ncurved object which at first he labelled \" Comet \" ; but presently, within\nthe ten minutes' period, he had an impulse to revert to this image and to\nadd these words beside his drawing :\n\" Later\u2014horn, Viking's helmet.\"\nIn judging the improbability of all such correspondences, and their\nconsequent evidential value, it was essential to have a working idea of the\nfrequency with which a given image might be expected to turn up as a\nspontaneous impression in experiments of this kind. Mr Carington's new\nCatalogue of observed frequencies supplied a much needed measuring scale,\nso that a given correspondence was no longer a unit ' about the size of a lump\nof chalk ', but could be graded according to the known approximate rarity-\nvalue of the image concerned.\nThe 174th Private Meeting of the Society was held in the Society's\nLibrary on Wednesday, 25 March 1942, at 3.30 p.m., Sir Ernest Bennett\nin the Chair.\nA paper entitled \" A Psycho-therapist's View of Telepathy and Medium-\nship \" was read by Dr H. J. Ehrenwald.\n\fi\n54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research march-april 1942\nOBITUARY\nWe learn with deep regret of the death on 28 March of the Countess of\nBalfour, and tender our sincere sympathy, on behalf of the Society to\nLord Balfour and his family in their bereavement.\nA MEMORIAL TO OLIVER GATTY\nBy the death of Oliver Gatty, through injuries received while engaged\non experimental work for the defence of this country, the Society lost the\nmost brilliant of its younger workers, and the country one of the most\nbrilliant of the younger generation of scientists. To provide a fitting\nmemorial a University Studentship is being endowed at Cambridge, the\nobject being \" to give an opportunity to scientists of any nationality\nworking in any branch of Science to carry on their work for a year in the\nDepartment of Colloid Science at Cambridge, provided that in this work\nPhysics was being used to help Biological Research, or Biology was helping\nPhysical Research.\" Oliver Gatty 's own work was especially devoted to\nbridging the gap between Biology and Physics, a matter bearing closely\non many of the problems of Psychical Research.\nMany of our Members may wish to avail themselves of this opportunity\nto pay their tribute to the memory of a man who was a most generous\nsupporter of the Society. Contributions may be paid to the Treasurer\nof the University, University Offices, Cambridge, either by a capital gift\nor by a seven-year covenant, of which forms can be obtained from our\nAssistant Secretary, 31 Tavistock Square.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Question of Survival\nSir, \u2014I am really much gratified by the kindly and constructive criticism\ncontained in the letters from Mr Tyrrell and Baron Palmstierna in your\nJan. -Feb. issue ;\nthey are exactly the sort of comment which I hoped that\nmy paper might elicit. It is by free discussion only that the position can\nbe clarified.\nMr Tyrrell, after quoting the formula which I put forward as being\nwhat \" I suggest conveys the meaning which most people intend \"\n(p. 349)\nwhen they speak of survival, says, \"it is not clear to me why reality\nshould conform to it.\" This is exactly my own position\u2014the object of\nmy paper was to show that reality probably does not conform to it or, at\nleast, that so much ambiguity is embodied that we cannot know for certain\nthat it does conform. He further says that I have raised more ambiguity\nthan I have laid.\" Actually my purpose was primarily to disclose\nambiguities ; I had little hope of being able to resolve them to any\nextent.\nI think that Mr Tyrrell is under some misapprehension as to my attitude.\nI did not put forward the formula as an expression of what I believe to\nbe the case but rather as an \" Aunt Sally \" to be knocked down. I do not\nassume, nor do I believe, that survival involves a continuation of existence\nin our time, in fact, in face of many of the phenomena with which psychical\n\fMARCH-APRIL 1 942 Correspondence 155\nresearch deals, also some of the problems raised by modern physics, I\ntake the opposite view. What I said was that I thought that the usual idea\nof survival implied something of the sort of thing which I tried to describe\nin my formula.\nI am inclined to agree with Mr Tyrrell in what he says about time and\nspace, though I doubt whether the Kantian view can be maintained\nwithout considerable modification.\nI would like to point out, however, that if the surviving entity be\ntimeless, it can hardly be conscious in the sense in which we use that\nterm. Consciousness, as we know it, involves a constant How, it is the\nchanges in state and content which constitute it ; a perfectly static state\nwould seem to be equivalent to unconsciousness.\nMr Tyrrell has admirably emphasised one aspect of the matter to\nwhich, perhaps, I did not devote sufficient attention, though I did mention\nit, and I am grateful to him for doing so.\nFinally, I agree completely with him when he says, \" The whole\nmatter ... is at present entirely fluid.\" My main purpose was to call\nattention to this fluidity.\nI am also very grateful to Baron Palmstierna, not only for his flattering\nreferences to my work, but also for the elucidation which he brings\nto certain points. I do not think that any controversy is likely to\narise between us as I believe that our views are largely parallel. What\nI hope for is the clarification of my opinions under the impact of his\ncomments.\nHe says, for example, \" mind is no individual organ or entity, but a\nterm used to indicate a composite expression of interaction between\nsoul and body, a result of combination between the parts which constitute\none personality \". This is precisely what I intended to convey when I\nsaid (page 353)\n\" mind is a joint affair of the physical and psychical \",\nthough I did not, perhaps, express my meaning with as great clearness\nas he does.\nI am certainly inclined to accept as at least partially true the theory\nthat the brain is, as Bergson held, a sort of telephone exchange, but it is\nsurely more than this. It not only transmits, it also alters and distorts,\nit adds and subtracts. The evidence from cerebral lesions appears\nconclusive on this point.\nIf this be so, there seems to me to be no escape from the conclusion\nthat the characteristics of the separated factors or elements are probably,\nto some extent at least, unlike those of the combination. We have consider-\nable knowledge about the combination, i.e. the mind of a living man, also\nabout the physical organism, but we are not in the same fortunate position\nas regards the other factor, viz., the pure psyche.\nIt may be that my statement that \" we have no knowledge of the pure\npsychical apart from the physical \" was too sweeping and needs qualifica-\ntion, but I was writing from the point of view of the psychical researcher\nwho is limited by language and logical form and has to rely on objective\nevidence. The kind of knowledge to which I refer is that which can be\ncommunicated to others by means of plain, bald prose. I do not doubt\nthat the mystics and the inspired poets possess some knowledge of a totally\ndifferent kind, but it does not lend itself to expression in ordinary logical\n\fJournal of Society for Psyc\/iical Research march-april 1942\nform, the meaning is conveyed more in the way that it is in music. I\nimagine, for instance, that were a precis of Wordsworth's Intimations of\nImmortality to be rendered in the best civil service style something which\nmany find in the original would be missing. Also, it seems probable to\nme that the ordinary, non-mystical man may sometimes have fleeting\nglimpses of such knowledge, though I think that it is more of an emotional\nthan of a cognitional nature. What I doubt is whether from such know-\nledge, combined with which he can gather from the poets and mystics,\nhe will be able to construct any picture of the pure psychical uncombined\nwith a physical organism. Anyhow, so far as I knpw, no one has yet\nsucceeded in producing a convincing picture, all that we get offered to us\nare slightly etherealised versions of man as we know him. As St John\nsays, \" It doth not yet appear what we shall be.\"\nI gather, however, that there is really very little difference between\nBaron Palmstierna's views and my own. He says \" we know very little\nof ourselves and of others less.\" Moreover, if the view of the Neo-\nplatonists and others that \" the me which I now recognise as myself\n\"\nis only a part of my real self\u2014a view to which I subscribed when I said\non page 356 that \" it is only a fragment of the total me \"\u2014the problem,\nas he truly says, \" becomes still more complicated.\"\nMy whole object was to bring into clearer light these complications\nand the ambiguities involved in the ordinary conception of survival, and\nI am very grateful to these two critics for having underlined certain points\nwhich I had, perhaps, insufficiently stressed.\u2014Yours faithfully,\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\n[Further Correspondence, and certain other contributions, are held over\nuntil a later issue of the Journal.

The Address\nwill be published in Proceedings.\nThe Society's Rooms will be closed from 31 July to 14 September\n\fjournal of Society for Psychical Research may-june i 942\nCASE : SOME EVIDENCE OF PRECOGNITION BY\nCOMMUNICATORS\nThe following extracts from the record of a long series of communications\nhave been contributed by Miss E. B. Gibbes. The extracts are selected\nas referring precognitively to a single episode, the wounding and recovery\nof Miss Gibbes' nephew ; his deceased mother is the purporting\ncommunicator in scripts obtained by Miss Geraldine Cummins, who was\nin Ireland at the time. His deceased uncle is the communicator in two\nearlier messages, one obtained by Miss Cummins and the other by Mrs\nTaylor. Miss Gibbes explains the family names and relationships about\nwhich the reader will need to be informed, in the first paragraph that\nfollows ; her ensuing record of dated events explains itself.\nMy sister-in-law, who died on 16 July 1941, was devoted to her two\nsons, and these extracts conclude with a letter from one of them, Nigel,\nconfirming what she wrote through Geraldine Cummins. Peggy is his\nyoung wife. Harold was her favourite brother who died some years ago.\nNigel is the son in question, and Hilda is the name of my sister-in-law. 1\nThere have been other prophecies in connection with the death of Hilda\ngiven through other mediums some years ago which all came true, notably\nthat she would die before Nigel's return from abroad. My brother F.\nwas Nigel's uncle.\nThe following was the first intimation of what has proved to be an\ninteresting example of pre-vision. Harold, writing through Geraldine\non October 31s? 1941, remarks that Hilda had what he \" could only call a\nnightmare\u2014a conviction that something bad had happened to Nigel ...\"\nOn Nov. yth, writing through G., Hilda remarks : \"... They keep\ntelling me Nigel is all right but I had such a fear about him ...\"\nThis script was received by me on 13th. In order to calm her mind,\nI sent G. a telegram on Nov. 14\/\/\/ saying \" Please reassure Hilda im-\nmediately. Nigel cables each week that he is well. ...\" (Peggy had\nwritten that she had had several cables to this effect.)\nOn Nov. 14?\/\/, G., after reading aloud my wire, wrote the following\nextract, purporting to come from Hilda: \"Tell Bea I am very grateful\nto her for her wire. It means so much to me that my darling Ni is well.\nI had such bad dreams about him. I dreamt that he was wounded, that\nhe lay out on a battlefield in great pain. That Peggy said he was missing,\nThat he did lose an arm or a leg. I can scarcely bear thinking about\nit and now you tell me it is all fancy\u2014that my darling is well. . .\n.\"\nOn Dec. 2nd, 1941, Hilda purported to write the following few lines\nthrough Geraldine. \" Hilda. Will you tell Bea that I was right and she\nmade a mistake\u2014my poor darling Ni, he has been wounded or was I\ndreaming? No, No, it was real. But tell Bea I am happy about him for\nit wasn't or didn't seem as bad as I thought. . .\n.\"\nOn Dec. \\th, Peggy wrote : \"I have just this moment received this\ncable from Nigel \" Wounded in leg, nothing serious. Now in base\nHospital ...\"\n1\nThis, the actual name, is printed in place of a family nickname in the scripts\nthat follow, for the sake of simplicity.\n\fMAY-JUNE 1942 Correspondence l\n59\nOn Dec. 20th Peggy wrote :\n\" I have had letters from- Nigel saying he\nhas a broken leg, broken ear drum and has had two operations to remove\nshrapnel from his legs and he was burnt about the face. ...\"\nNote. It will be observed that Hilda (or Geraldine) had this vision of\nNigel on or before October 31st 1941. That it is again referred to on\nNovember 7th. According to the papers and in Nigel's confirmatory\nletter, the campaign in Libya opened on Nov. 1 8th. On Nov. 14th, G.\nwrote that Nigel lay out on a battlefield wounded in leg or arm. Nigel\nwas wounded on the 21st, apparently in these circumstances.\nAt a sitting with Mrs Taylor in March 1940, my brother F. indicated\nthat there would be an anxious time about Nigel but that he would come\nback. Incidentally Mrs Taylor also said that Nigel's mother would\nhave passed over before he returned.\nWriting through Geraldine on May ijth 1940, my brother F. said\n\" . . . We shall have heavy losses in life. I think Nigel is wounded but\nhe recovers. ...\"\nExtract from a letter from Nigel received Feb. 18 1942. [Written to Miss\nGibbes from hospital and dated 5 Jan. 42.]\nI have just received your two airgraphs dated Dec. 5th and nth.\nThank you very much, the information received from Mother via Geral-\ndine is most interesting. I dont think now there can be any harm in\ngiving you the information and dates as it is so long ago. We left the\nMetropolis and moved into the desert on October the 8th. The battle\nstarted on November 18th (Peg's birthday incidentally), and I was\nwounded on November 21st about 5 o'clock in the evening. I lay out\nall night by my tank which was burning and was picked up about 7 o'clock\nthe next morning, Nov. 22nd. My leg was operated on at an advanced\ndressing station the same evening and I finally fetched up here about\n7 p.m. on Nov. 29th. I was operated on a second time on Dec. 1st\nwhen they removed a fairly large bit of shrapnel from my leg, and that,\nAuntie Bea, is I think the whole story. I am up and about again now but\nwalking is slow and somewhat painful still as the wound has not yet\nhealed. . . .\nCORRESPONDENCE\nThe Question of Survival\nSir,\u2014Mr Saltmarsh's main contention is that he never held the view\nthat survival could be proved by a single crucial case. I am glad this is\nso but all I can say is that his paper, which I was criticising, certainly\ngives the impression that he does or did. He there says, \" There remain\ntwo further points for consideration. First whether any combination of\nthe various types of phenomena would afford more conclusive evidence\nthan when taken separately : second the faggot theory.\" Three pages are\ngiven up to these two points and the remaining half-page returns to con-\nsidering the crucial case.\nWhat I ask does the phrase \" There remain two further points to be\nconsidered \" mean? Is this the language of a man who considers that\n\f160 Journal of Society for Psychical Research MAY-JUNE 1942\nthe only proper method is to proceed as described by Sir Oliver Lodge?\nThen, if Mr Saltmarsh did wish to outline a theory such as I described\nin my paper as applied to evolution, surely his choice of words is most\nunfortunate. For one thing, it is difficult to see why he had to state two\nalternatives at all.\nMr Saltmarsh ends up by saying that \" the gist of his paper is that so\nlong as alternative hypotheses are theoretically possible and while the\nrelative probabilities are not assessable with any degree of precision, owing\nto the inapplicability of mathematical treatment, proof of survival . . .\ncannot be attained on the data at present available. ...\" Mr Saltmarsh\nhas summed up in a few words the main point of difference between us.\nHe draws a distinction between conviction and proof and says only the\nlatter is objective. He should have said only \" mathematical proof \" is\nobjective and as mathematics always argues from assumptions and not\nfrom facts, its use for practical purposes must always be limited.\nIn so far as mathematics is applied to life it becomes a question of\nprobability. As a guide to life legal proof which must be \" sufficient\nto satisfy the mind and conscience of an ordinary man and so to convince\nhim that he would venture to act upon that conviction in matters of\nimportant personal interest \" (Taylor's Law of Evidence) is more satis-\nfactory. In other words, in ordinary life we are satisfied with the tipping\nof the balance of probability one way or the other. Otherwise we should\nremain for the most part in a state of inactivity. At any rate I deny that\nthere is any difference between applied mathematical proof and conviction\nexcept in degree.\nHowever, after a brief and as he admits a fruitless discussion of the\n\" faggot \" theory, Mr Saltmarsh returns to the crucial case and says \" I\ndo not know of such a case but if one could be found it would be sheer\nprejudice and obstinacy to withhold a provisional acceptance of some form\nof survival.\" If this does not imply that survival could be provisionally\nestablished by a single crucial case, the language has no meaning. Again,\nif all reasonable persons are \" provisionally convinced \" what more do we\nwant? Shall we continue to pursue the mirage of mathematical proof?\n\u2014\nI am, etc., B. Abdy Collins.\nSir,\u2014I said in my criticism that Mr Saltmarsh contended that the\nsynthesis of psychical and physical is analogous to a chemical compound.\nIn his reply the author denies this contention and asserts that he discusses\nboth the mixture and compound theories. If by mixture is meant two\nseparate constituents between which interaction does not occur, then the\nsupposition is admittedly absurd. To me, the most reasonable supposition\nappears to be that between mind and body considerable interaction and\nmutual modification occur, but that the two nevertheless remain separate\nand distinguishable. In contrast Mr Saltmarsh's fundamental contention\nis that \"the mode of combination of the factors which go to make up\nmind is such that no analysis will afford us knowledge of the pure\nelements.\" To this I take objection. I maintain that there are certain\nproperties of man, such as consciousness, which are recognisable as purely\npsychical, and, in aggregate, make up human personality. It does not\ntherefore surprise me that what I commonly regard as the psychical\n\fMAY-JUNE 1942 Correspondence 161\nelement should persist after bodily death and manifest itself in such a way\nas to be identifiable.\nIn my criticism I was so ill-advised as to utter, without further elabora-\ntion, the words, \" What is wrong with consulting the psychical entities\nthemselves?\" Mr Saltmarsh quite rightly challenges me to produce\na pure unalloyed psychical entity. When I wrote the above I had in\nmind the possibility of directly contacting the X (in Mr Saltmarsh's\nnotation), without the medium complex P-B. A person receiving a\ndirect impulse, telepathically or otherwise, from a discarnate person is\nsurely in direct contact with A\", the pure psychical element, and it is my\nopinion that certain mediums are in this position.\nMr Saltmarsh mentioned various bodily derangements which produce\nprofound alteration in the personality. I think it is true to say, however,\nthat the extent and nature of the mental derangements produced by cerebral\nlesion, drugs, bacterial infections, etc., depend very largely upon the con-\nstitution of the affected mentality, and that many of the personality modifi-\ncations produced are not necessarily permanent, but capable of reversal.\nMoreover natural death does not seem to constitute a severe trauma,\nbeing a quiet, gradual and natural process. It is therefore my present\nopinion that the a priori reasons for expecting bodily death to cause a\nprofound and permanent personality change are insufficient to cast doubt\nupon the empirical evidence to the contrary. \u2014Yours, etc.,\n\u00ab Donald J. West.\nSir, \u2014May I reply very briefly indeed to the letters of Mr Abdy Collins\nand Mr West of which you have been good enough to let me see the proofs.\nI can assure Mr Collins again that I do not and never have held the\n\" crucial case \" view, but so long as it is theoretically possible that such a\ncase might be found, it is necessary to examine the evidence available in\norder to discover if one exists and, if not, what it would be like if it did.\nFinally, may I repeat that I was not concerned with personal conviction,\nwhich involves emotional elements of many sorts, but solely with\nobjective, scientific proof. It is now generally recognised that such\nproof rests on balance of probability, hence, if you cannot assess that\nbalance you cannot get proof. My contention was that we have no means\nof making any approximately accurate assessment and that we must,\ntherefore, rest satisfied with subjective conviction\u2014if we can get it. I do\nnot, and never intended to, suggest that the assessment must necessarily\nbe numerical.\nI think that there is little I need say to Mr West. In a mixture the\nconstituents interact mechanically, the combination of their characteristics\nis additive. I suggest that the best method of settling the difference\nbetween us concerning the possibility of acquiring knowledge of the\ncharacteristics of the pure psyche by analysis of those of psycho-physical\nentities would be for Mr West to do so. If he can demonstrate this by\nirrefragable logic I shall be only too delighted to admit my present opinion\nto be erroneous, for then I shall have learned something which I much\ndesire to know.\nJust one word on cerebral lesions. It is true that in certain cases, such\nas some of the aphasias, function is sometimes partially restored, and the\n\fl6z Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1942\ntheory is that structures in the right cerebral hemisphere, analogous to\nthose on the left which have been destroyed, are educated to take over the\nwork. There are a few cases where progressive disease has then attacked\nthe right hemisphere and the recovered function has again been destroyed.\nIn such cases no instance of further recovery has been recorded. I have\nknown cases, e.g. chronic alcoholism, where the manifested character of\nthe subject has been completely, or nearly completely, altered. It is not\nnecessary, however, for my argument that the alteration should be even\nnearly complete ; if there be any considerable alteration that is all that is\nrequired to show that the manifested personality is composite.\nTo conclude, I agree that the true personality may survive death, or\nperhaps I ought rather to say that death may not entail the destruction 01\nthe true personality, but the question is, What is the true personality?\nMy view is that very probably it is quite unlike the \" me which I now\nrecognise as myself.\"\u2014Yours, etc.,\n6\nH. F. Saltmarsh.\nREVIEWS\nJournal of Parapsychology. Vol. 5. Nos. 3 and 4. September and\nDecember 1941. ,\nThe September number is devoted entirely to a study by Dr Rhine oi\nthe question of Terminal Salience, together with a short paper by Dr .\nGreenwood on the mathematics of the statistical methods employed.\nTerminal Salience is a feature of E.S.P. phenomena sometimes found\nwhen these take the form of series or runs of trials. It had been noticed\nthere was a tendency for the hits to cluster round the ends of each division\nof the series, this was particularly the case where the D.T. procedure\nwas employed. _ .\nDr Rhine's study was designed to investigate this effect and he used a\nmeasure termed Salience Ratio (S.R.). The runs of 25 trials were\ndivided into five segments and the sum of the Chi-squares (C.R. squared)\nof the terminal segments, 1 and 5, was divided by the sum of the Chi-\nsquares of segments 2, 3 and 4, the result being compared with normal\nchance expectation. This is called the Run S.R. (R.S.R.). The same\nis done for each segment thus giving Segment S.R. (S.S.R.).\nThroughout the experiment the D.T. procedure with sealed packs was\nused. There were two divisions in one of which the subjects were all\nadults in the other children whose ages ranged from 5 to 13 years. It was\nfurther divided into two series, the interrupted and the uninterrupted.\nIn the interrupted series five additional cards were inserted into each pack\nof 25 these bore, in one sub-division, numbers or letters, in another sud-\ndivision, drawings ;\nthey were placed at the beginning of each segment\nof c E.S.P. cards.\nIn the uninterrupted series ordinary E.S.P packs were used but a\nsub-division was made in that in some cases the subject himself wrote\ndown his call on a record form of the usual kind, in others his calls were\nrecorded by the experimenter. There was thus a definite breaking up\nof the runs into segments of fives in the interrupted series, a suggestion\nof such a breaking up in one sub-division of the uninterrupted owing to\n\fmay-june 1942 Reviews 163\nthe record forms used, which divide the spaces for the runs into blocks\nof five by horizontal lines, while in the last there was no such suggestion\nat all.\nAs was expected from previous experiments with similar procedure,\nnegative deviations were obtained. For the whole experiment this reached\nonly marginal significance ; as between child and adult the former had\na C.R. of 3-29 which is, of course, significant, while the latter was insigni-\nficant. As regards terminal salience the whole gave a positive R.S.R. of\n\u202285 as compared with chance expectation of -667, the excess over chance,\nhowever, was due entirely to the interrupted series which, taken alone,\nshowed R.S.R. = 1-38 (P = -03) against -6i for the uninterrupted.\nIn the subsections it was found that there was more terminal salience\nwhen the interrupting cards were numbers or letters than when they were\ndrawings ;\nin the uninterrupted, more when the subject wrote down his\ncalls than when they were recorded for him.\nFor Segment S.R. the interrupted series gave an S.S.R. of 2-60 (P\n= \u20220004), while the uninterrupted yielded on -88 ; the combined series\ngave S.S.R. = 1-24 (P\u2014005).\nDr Rhine's study goes very fully into the question of covariation\nbetween the various groups, e.g. R.S.R. 's and S.S.R. 's, child and adult,\netc., and as a result, he finds a new extra-chance relation besides the\nordinary C.R.\nVery complete tables and graphs are given, and this part of the report\nis admirably exhaustive.\nHe discusses in an interesting fashion some of the psychological implica-\ntions of terminal salience, including the rather obscure question of negative\ndeviation.\nIt is to be hoped that further work will be done on this matter as it\nappears that it is by means of the investigation of such secondary charac-\nteristics of the phenomena that an understanding of the nature and\nconditions of occurrence of E.S.P. may best be attained.\nDr Greenwood's short paper in this issue is for mathematicians only.\nThe layman cannot hope to make any useful comment thereon.\nThe December number is devoted to an article by Betty M. Humphrey\nand J. G. Pratt on \" A Comparison of Five E.ST. Test Procedures.\"\nThese tests were as follows :\n(1) General E.S.P. (2) Open Matching\nwith Chutes. In this E.S.P. cards, enclosed in opaque envelopes, were\nmatched against visible target cards by dropping them down the appro-\npriate chute. (3) Blind Matching in the usual way. (4) Tests with a\nspecially constructed machine. This was loaded with 250 marbles of\nfive different colours and the subject had to guess the colour of the marble\njust ready to roll into sight. (5) A Precognition test. Adequate pre-\ncautions were taken to guard against sensory clues, recording errors, etc.\n2001 runs were done with 37 subjects. The total of all procedures gave\na negative deviation with a C.R. of 2-47, only just below the significance\nlevel. Probability by chi-squares was -0045.\nAs regards the separate procedures, the O.M. chutes yielded the highest\nC.R. = 373, which is significant, none of the others reached the level of\nsignificance.\nThe authors discuss two rival hypotheses to account for the fact that\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research may-june 1942\nonly one of the five procedures gave a significant result ;\nthey also make\nsome remarks on Negative Deviation.\nIt is proposed to take up the question of possible correlation between\nE.S.P. test scoring and Personality test scores in a later paper. If any\nconclusions can be reached in this matter they should prove^ a very\nvaluable step forward in the task of determining the nature of E.S.P.\nJournal of Parapsychology. Vol.6. No. 1. March 1942.\nIn an editorial note, the new Editors explain the changes which have\nbeen necessitated by the war, also the proposal to introduce into the\nJournal articles of a type more general than those to which it has hitherto\nbeen exclusively devoted. I think that this innovation will be welcomed by\nall readers. Though the technical articles dealing with research and the\nstatistical problems arising therefrom must and should remain the chief\nfeatures, the time has arrived when more general discussion of the impli-\ncations of the work may profitably be made.\nOne such article appears in the present issue : it is a review of the first\nfive years of the Journal and is contributed by Dorothy H. Pope and J.\nG. Pratt. It gives a useful account of the work reported and traces the\ngeneral trends exhibited during the period.\nA report on an E.S.P. test with drawings is reported by Chas. E. Stuart.\nThe technique used was somewhat novel. There were seven tests, in\neach of which four originals were used and the subject made four attempts\nto record his response. He was then required to match each of the\noriginals in turn against his four drawings and to assign a rank of choice,\ni.e. best, second, third and poorest match. When this was done he had to\nmatch each of his drawings in a similar way with the four originals. The\nagent was then required to do the same. Correct correspondences were\nnoted and the results scored. One subject P. H., who had previously\nhad some success in other E.S.P. experiments, took part in each test\nsometimes as percipient, sometimes as agent. When he acted as judge the\nC.R. showed significance ; with other judges this was not so.\nAn empirical check on Salience Relations is reported in a short article\nby J. G. Pratt, Betty M.TIumphrey and J. B. Rhine. It confirmed the\nconclusion, previously arrived at on logical grounds, that the salience\neffects in the segments (S.S.R.) and in the runs (R.S.R.) are independent\nand cannot be attributed to statistical interdependence.\nThe last article, by J. B. Rhine and Betty M. Humphrey, gives an account\nof a transoceanic experiment, conducted between August 1939 and May\n1940 with Dr Karlo Marchesi of Zagreb, Jugoslavia. In four of the sub-\nseries Dr Marchesi was percipient, in another he was agent, and the\npercipients were ten students at Duke. The C.R.'s of all these subsenes,\nwith the exception of the last of the first group, which was interrupted by\nthe threat of war, showed no significance, nor did the total of all the sub-\nseries taken together, but when measured for covariation between salience\nratios a highly significant result was found. This experiment is of special\nimportance as it constitutes what is probably the long distance record for\nsuch work. TT ^ \u201e\nH. F.

FORCES\nThe books which members have kindly contributed to the Libraries for\nthe Forces through the Society were so welcome that the Council\ndecided to have bound several old Parts of Proceedings, which were con-\nsidered likely to interest the general reader, and have presented these to\nthe Service Libraries. Included in these presentation volumes are 50\ncopies of the Report on the Census of Hallucinations {Proc. Vol. X,\nPart 26). This seriously reduces the Society's stock of this important\nPart. If members in clearing their shelves for salvage come on any copies\nof it, would they be so kind as to send them to the Assistant-Secretary at\nthe Society's rooms?\nA CASE OF RECIPROCAL HALLUCINATIONS\nWe have received from Dr L., who lives at Northampton, the following\naccount of a \" reciprocal \" experience which he and his wife, who was\non a short visit to Reading, had on two successive nights. Dr L.'s state-\nment is as follows :\nStatement\nOn Tuesday, July 28, my wife, convalescing after an operation, went\nfor a few days to the home of her sister at Reading. I had been asked to\ngo too, but my work prevented me from getting away, and I remained\nalone at home. I slept restlessly that night, being conscious of outside\nnoises like passing planes, etc. During the night I became aware of my\nwife standing at the side of the bed, near the foot, gently rousing me with\nher hand on my lower limbs and speaking in a low voice. She stood on\nthe side next the windows, which were wide open. In the light of a\nclouded moon her figure was dim but unmistakable, and her attitude and\ntone gave the impression of sadness and concern. She asked if I had\nminded her going to Reading and leaving me behind. I assured her I did\nnot mind at all. She made as if to go away and I asked her to wait, but\nshe^sappeared, though I have no recollection of the manner of her exit.\nI found myself gazing out of the window in full consciousness, and it\nstruck me as odd that I had not experienced any wakening from sleep\nsubsequent to our conversation, only before it when I had been roused\nby the movement of her hand. I lay for some time thinking of the episode\n\fSEPT.\u2014OCT. 1942 A Case of Reciprocal Hallucinations 167\nand decided to write the next day and ask my wife if she had had any\nuntoward experience on that night. This I did, mentioning mine, and\nthis letter reached her on Thursday (July 30) afternoon. On Thursday\nmorning I received her wire asking \" Are you well?\n\"\nOn the night of July 29 I had no unusual experience, nor on subsequent\nnights. On July 31 I received a letter from my wife telling me of what\nhappened to her on the nights of July 28 and 29.\nAugust 2, 1942.\nDr L. has produced to us the letter to his wife to which he refers : it\nis dated \" Northampton, July 29, 1942 \", and the time on the postmark\nis 8 p.m. The material parts are as follows :\n' \" Did you have any thoughts of me during the night?\u2014any adventures\nof the mind such as astral projection? I ask this with some seriousness.\nFor you came to my bed . . . you stood by the side of the bed, laid\nyour hands on my [? word omitted] gently to rouse me, and asked if I was\nupset at all by your going to Reading without me. You spoke sadly and\nlooked rather forlorn in the dim light\u2014just an outline and a voice. I\nassured you I had no such feelings and you\u2014just retired and disappeared.\nI asked a little but you left immediately you got my answer. Oddly enough\nI found myself awake but was unaware of any process of waking. Just\nlay there in the obscure moonlight with the consciousness of having con-\nversed with you in this brief manner.\n\" If you had any experience at the same time it is worth recording and\ncomparing notes. Tt may possibly have been no more than a reaction\nconnected with the book I have been reading. Probably so.\"\nIn a letter accompanying his statement Dr L. explains that he had\n\" been reading lately a book {Man in the Black Hat, by Temple Thurston)\nthe plot of which is based on dissociation of body and spirit \". He also\nadds that he has never been to his sister-in-law's house at Reading and\ndoes not know the town.\nMrs L.'s statement as to her share in the incident is as follows :\nStatement\nOn July 28 I went to stay with my sister at Reading, leaving my husband\nat home, though I had hoped he might be able to come with me. During\nthe night I was restless and slept badly. My mind was confused but I\nhad a great desire to get out of the house and reach my home. There is\na tame magpie in my sister's house called the \" Captain \". He became\nassociated with my desire to get away and I kept saying to myself that the\nonly way to get out of Reading would be to fly as he could do over the\ntrees and houses. I have no recollection of trying to do so in my dream,\njust the persistent thought that if I was like the \" Captain \" my problem\nwould be solved.\nOn the following night (July 29) I dreamed about my husband, worrying\nabout his health and as to how he was getting on alone. The windows\nwere wide open. Suddenly I became aware of him standing near the\ndoor, my bed being between the door and the windows. His figure was\nghostly and without definition, but a shaft of silvery light (coming from\nthe inner part of the room, not from the windows) lit up his features. He\n\f1 68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1942\nwas smiling slightly and there was tenderness in his expression. We did\nnot speak to each other at all. After what seemed a minute or two his\nface and figure faded away. I felt calm and contented and fell asleep.\nThe next morning (Thursday, July 30) I recounted my experience to\nthe family at breakfast, for it was very vivid in my mind. My son sug-\ngested we send a wire at once to see if anything had happened to my\nhusband, so we wired \" Are you well? \" I felt some anxiety because,\nwhen living in Egypt during the last War, I dreamed vividly of seeing a\nphoto of my brother in a paper with a report of his being severely wounded,\nand this actually happened in France about that date. On Thursday\nafternoon came a letter from my husband telling me of his experience on\nthe previous Tuesday night. Nothing out of the way occurred after this\nand I returned home on August 1.\nAugust 2, 1942.\nThe son, aged 14, adds a confirmatory statement. An officially certified\ncopy of the telegram referred to has been shown to us : it was handed in\nat Reading at 10 a.m. on the 30th July, 1942, and reads \" Are you well,\nplease wire?\n\"\nIn his covering letter to the Society, Dr L. writes :\n\" I have experienced what I understand is known as astral projection on\nmany occasions, dreaming that I floated through space, sometimes with\nease at high altitudes, sometimes briefly and with much effort just above\nground level. This has not occurred during the past two or three years,\na fact I have attributed (perhaps wrongly) to my being in rather poor\nhealth and sleeping badly. My wife has had no dreams of this kind.\"\nEach percipient was at the time of the experience recently awakened\nfrom sleep, a condition favourable to the externalisation of subliminal\nthoughts and emotions, and the fact that each was thinking much about\nthe other would be a pre-disposing factor to externalisation, even if there\nwere no suggestion of telepathy. But Mrs L.'s \" great desire to get out\nof the house and reach my home \" on the night of the 28th July, may have\ntelepathically reinforced Dr L.'s own normal thoughts and feelings, so\nas to bring them to externalisation-pitch, so to speak, while her own\nexperience on the night of the 29th, before she had any normal knowledge\nof her husband's experience of the 28th, suggests reciprocal telepathic\nactivity with her husband as agent on the second occasion.\nBoth Dr L. and Mrs L. mention previous psychical experiences, but\nthese were clearly quite different, there being no suggestion that either\nhad previously \" appeared \" to the other, or to any third person.\nCORRESPONDENCE\nMuch Hadham Rectory,\nHerts.,\n18. 6. 42.\nSir,\u2014Readers of the Journal will be interested to know that the appeal\nfor the endowment of a University Studentship at Cambridge as a\nmemorial to Oliver Gatty has met with so favourable a response that the\n.;<{ it\/o<\n\fsept.-oct. 1942 Correspondence 169\nfund raised has been accepted by the University.

By Sir Hubert Wilkins and Harold Sherman.\nPp. 421. Illustrated. New York : Creative Age Press, 1942. Price\n$4.50.\nOur members will be interested to hear that Mrs Eileen Garrett has\nset up as a publisher in New York under the style of the Creative Age\nPress, and will congratulate her on having brought out such an interesting\nbook as Thoughts through Space, of a size and get-up which would turn\nthe ordinary English publisher at the present time green with envy. The\nbook is an account of Sir Hubert Wilkins's attempt, undertaken at the\nrequest of the Soviet Government, to find some Russian fliers who were\nmissing on a flight in August 1937 over the Polar Regions from Moscow\nto Alaska. It is a thrilling story of adventure under conditions of great\ndifficulty, and to psychical researchers it is of particular interest as record-\ning experiments in telepathy over a long distance where ordinary means\nof communication were not available. Before setting out on his flight\nWilkins agreed with a friend, Mr Harold Sherman, living in New York,\nthat at frequent definite intervals Wilkins should endeavour to transmit\nhis thoughts to Sherman, who would record the impressions received.\nThe progress of this experiment is very fully reported in this book.\nRepeatedly the Wilkins record and the Sherman record were found to\ntally.\nMany of Sherman's impressions related to matters likely from time to\ntime to be uppermost in Wilkins's mind, e.g. good and bad luck with the\nweather, with machinery, and with the health of the exploring party. In\nthis connection occasional hits were to be expected, but Wilkins was\nsatisfied that Sherman scored more than could be attributed to normal\nguesswork. Sherman also scored several hits when his impressions dealt\nwith matters lying far outside normal incidents of Arctic exploration ; he\nhad an impression, for example, that on a particular day Wilkins would\nattend a social function in evening dress : Wilkins had naturally taken no\nevening dress with him, but had borrowed some in order to attend an\nArmistice Ball in Canada. Again, Sherman, who did not know exactly\nwhere Wilkins was, had, on the 30th November, 1937,\n\" a strong impres-\nsion of ping-pong balls \" on an evening when two of Wilkins's party were\nin fact playing that game. On the 8th March, 1938, he makes the following\nentry :\n\" Diamond Mine. Why I should think of this is a mystery.\"\nWilkins annotates :\n\" That night was telling people at table, at about the\ntime you were sitting, of visit to African diamond mines.\"\n> Wilkins and Sherman also attempted experiments with Zener Cards,\nthough both of them remarked that the lack of emotional interest attaching\nto the cards seemed to militate against success. It is very curious to note\nthat on one occasion Sherman, in addition to getting seven hits out of\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research sept.-oct. 1942\ntwenty-five shots, \" recorded four other cards in which his sequence was\nthe same as mine, although one card later than the order in which I had\nsent them \". At the time of this experiment, so far as I am aware, nothing\nhad been published regarding the displacement effects studied by Mr\nWhately Carington and Mr Soal.\nW. H. S.\nBrief Darkness. By Gladys Osborne Leonard. Cassell, 10s. 6d. net.\nThe late Arthur Clutton-Brock once suggested that mediums' descrip-\ntions of the after-life and of other planes of being should be neither\ncredulously accepted at their face-value nor rejected out of hand, but\ngiven the attention that a sensible man would have given to travellers'\ntales, in the days when knowledge of far-off countries was scanty. By\nnow, some of the most derided tales of the ancient travellers have turned\nout to be substantially true, though the unicorn has either vanished into\nthe region of myth or undergone a marked change on being identified as\na rhinoceros. As a traveller in other dimensions, Mrs Leonard commands\nthe respect due to her quiet and sincere presentation of things seen and\nexperienced, slight though the grounds often are upon which we can\nestimate the objective or subjective nature of the vision and the experi-\nences.\nSome of the stories she tells could be of evidential interest. In one\nimpressive case, the evidence has had some attention on being reported\nin part to the Society, and the main facts are known to be as stated. But\nMrs Leonard's aim is not to marshal evidence on S.P.R. lines, but in all\nsimplicity to bear her own witness and to let her recital create its own\nimpression. It would be unprofitable either to accept her experiences\nas all of objective fact, or to reject them as products of the imagination.\nIn some instances she tells of dreams and of waking imagery for which\nshe herself is frankly unsure in putting forward an interpretation. What\nis well worthy of our study is the kind of world that presents itself to a\nmedium of Mrs Leonard's standing, the kind and quality of experience\nthat has attended the cultivation of her particular gifts.\nA point by which many readers will be impressed is that there is no\nattitude of superior knowledge and enlightenment to be observed in this\nbook. Rather there is a childlike, at times a na'ive, disregard of the\nimpression to be produced upon critical readers, so long as the experience\nto be related is put into direct and simple language. Nothing seems to\nbe written for effect ; and with no apparent thought of self-presentation,\nMrs Leonard in fact displays the attitude of a humble and sometimes\npuzzled inquirer\u2014as, indeed, do many of the mediums whose work has\nproved most reliable. The texture of personal experience described\nin this book may seem, in parts, to be loosely woven and to constitute no\nvery enduring fabric for the gospel of Spiritualism ; but Spiritualism\nitself is best served, in the long run, by such candid and simple-minded\nrecords of experience as Mrs Leonard here imparts to her public.\nK.

Birge and J. B. Rhine contribute the first article in a series\nentitled \" Unusual Types of Subjects tested for E.S.P.\" The first type\ndealt with is the Professional Medium and the subject chosen is Mrs\nEileen Garrett. Mrs Garrett is outstanding among professional mediums\nin that, as the authors say, \" she has literally walked into the laboratory\nof the psychologist, the physician and the psychiatrist, and offered her\nservices as an experimental subject for study \".\nA short account is given of the Trance Association Tests reported by\nJ. G. Pratt and the formal E.S.P. tests carried out at Duke and in this\ncountry. The authors discuss the relation between the two types of test and\nthe success obtained in one situation compared with the failure in another.\nWe look forward to further articles in this series as it appears that\nvaluable information might be derived from investigation along these lines.\nE. P. Gibson and C. E. Stuart have an article on \" Atmospheric Pressure\nand E.S.P. Score Averages \", and arrive at the conclusion that there is no\nsignificant relation between them, though it is admitted that the data\navailable are not altogether satisfactory.\nJ. B. Rhine reports a further series of experiments in precognition under\nthe title \" Evidence of Precognition in the Covariation of Salience Ratios \".\nIn this experiment the shuffling and cutting of the cards was determined\nby using figures obtained from temperature readings of a specified day\nin the future. One cannot imagine a method better calculated to defeat\nthe charge of lack of randomness and possible psycho-kinetic effect.\n2302 runs were made in two major series, in one the delay in checking\nwas two days, in the other ten days. The subjects were in two classes,\nadult and child. Each series was further subdivided into unbroken runs\nand broken runs for the two-day series, and interrupted and broken runs\nfor the ten-day. The broken runs were divided into segments of five in\nthe usual way, while the interrupted runs had as well other tests between\nthe segments.\nOn the check-up the predictions were found to be not significantly\nabove chance. The Salience Ratios were calculated for the various\nsub-series of each division, i.e. Adult and Child, also by Sections, that is\nunbroken and broken two-day, interrupted and broken ten-day, by series\nand by Pooled Hit Distribution. An extra-chance relation was found in\nsome of the Salience Ratios, the strongest evidence being derived from\nSSR-RSR covariation from SR's based on pooled deviations of the sub-\nseries at the Section level. P. in this case comes out at -0016. Other\nsignificant results were found, e.g. in SSR . RSR covariation for A.\nDivisions, P. = -0047, and B. Series, P. = -0044. There is an adequate\ndiscussion of the various topics involved.\nAs this method of obtaining extra-chance significance from Salience\nRatios and their Covariation is somewhat of a novelty, it is to be hoped\nthat a full discussion of its meaning and implications may eventuate, also\ncriticism, if any, of the statistical methods involved.\nThere is also an article by the present writer entitled \" The Nature of\nExtra-Sensory Perception \".\nH F S\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research SEPT.-OCT. 1942\nTelepathy in Dreams.

In particular\nthe hallucination shared by and apparently generated in more than one\nmind at the same time seems more comprehensible in the light of Mr\nTyrrell's theory of the construction of images. Recorded cases of this\nkind are somewhat sparse, and the following example which has reached\nus through Sir Ernest Bennett is a welcome addition to the available\n\fnov.-dec. 1942 Case: A Collective Hallucination at Boscastle, ig33 175\nrecords. This hallucination appears to depend for motive upon wish-\nfulhlment, as seems also to be the case in an example given in Mrs.\nLeonard's book Brief Darkness, reviewed in the last issue of the Journal\n:\nIn that instance a bridge over a river was \" seen \" in full light by both\nMrs. Leonard and her niece at a place where they wished to cross the\nriver on their return from a walk. On turning to approach the river at\nthis spot they found that there was no bridge there.\nIn the present case the wish of the two percipients, Mr and Mrs Clifford\nPye, for a suitable guest-house may be held to have set their imaginations\nworking in unison upon the construction and exteriorisation of a detailed\npicture of such a house. The case is nine years old, but the possibility of\nerrors in memory seems to be adequately considered in Mr. Pye's com-\nments. There is the obvious possibility to be entertained that an actual\nhouse was seen and its locality incorrectly remembered, and on Cornish\nroads it is often easy to miss, when on foot, an object previously seen\nfrom a vehicle, owing to the height of the stone \" hedges \" ; but Mr and\nMrs Pye seem to have been stirred by their mystification to make a very\nthorough search along the route that they had previously traversed, before\nthey could accept the idea that a hallucination had misled them both.\nMr Pye records the occurrence as follows :\nIn June, 1933, my wife and I were on holiday at Falmouth. After some\nten days we decided to spend the remainder of my leave on the north\nCornish coast, the choice of locality being left to chance, though the\ngeneral intention was to make first for Boscastle.\nOn Saturday, 17th June, we went to Wadebridge by train, and there\ntook 'bus for Boscastle, passing Tintagel, and subsequently Trevalga. We\nwere then about a mile and a half from Boscastle and were keeping a good\nlookout for any hotel or guest-house which might appear suitable.\nOn approaching Boscastle and at a point about one hundred and fifty\nor two hundred yards before reaching the top of the steep hairpin bend\nhill which drops into the town the 'bus stopped momentarily to set down\na passenger.\nIt had come to rest almost outside the gate of a rather substantial house,\nstanding on the left hand side of the road. It stood back from the road\nsome twenty yards or so, there being a semicircular drive from the gate\noutside which we had stopped to another gate, twenty-five yards further\non. The garden front was screened from the road by a hedge, over which\nwe could just see from our seats in the 'bus.\nThe house was double-fronted, and of a style of architecture which I\njudged to date from the late 1860's or early 1870's. It had a fresh, trim\nappearance, and seemed to have been recently painted, the woodwork and\nthe quoins of the house being of a rather reddish light chocolate in colour.\nThe most striking feature, however, was on the lawn, where amongst\nbeds of scarlet geraniums there were several wicker or cane chairs and\ntables over which there were standing large garden umbrellas of black and\norange.\nNo person was seen, nor do I recollect having noticed any sign notifying\nthat it was a guest-house, though I had no doubt that such was the case.\nI called my wife's attention to the place and she immediately replied that\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1942\nit was \" just what we were looking for \" but, before we could come to any\ndecision, the 'bus moved off and in two or three minutes we were down\nin Boscastle.\nNeither my wife nor I were much attracted by the place, however, as\nwe found the smell of the seaweed on which a hot sun was shining rather\ndisagreeable. My wife then said that she would much prefer to stay at\nthe place we had passed at the top of the hill, and returned there to try\nand book rooms.\nI expected her to be back well inside half an hour, but when over an\nhour had passed and there was no sign of her, I began to grow apprehensive\nbut could not leave to make enquiries, having with me our luggage.\nMy anxiety continued to increase, and it was with great relief that after\nan hour and twenty-five minutes I saw her coming down the hill, looking\nconsiderably heated.\nTo my enquiries as to what had made her so long, she replied that she\nhad been unable to find the house ; that she had climbed on various gates,\netc. to look around but could see nothing\u2014and had so continued until\nshe got to Trevalga, a mile and a half away, where she had booked rooms.\nI said that I couldn't understand how she could have missed the house\n\u2014\nthe only detached house there was at that spot\u2014and that the umbrellas\nin the garden made it impossible to overlook the place. She herself\nseemed to be much astonished at her failure and could not understand\nhow she could have failed to find it.\nI replied that it was of no particular consequence but that on our way\nback to Trevalga (by 'bus, over the same road by which we had come,\nfor there is no alternative route), I would point out the house to her.\nIn due course we got on this 'bus, and as we reached the top of the hill\nremarked \" It's just here on the right\u2014about fifty yards further on \"\n\u2014\nbut to my astonishment, there was no house. Just empty fields running\nacross to the cliffs by Blackapit.\nDuring our stay at Trevalga we made a thorough search of the locality\nbut failed to find any place even remotely resembling what we had seen.\nOn a subsequent visit to the Trevalga guest-house, I told our experience\nto the proprietor, who assured me that from his knowledge there was in\nthe neighbourhood no such house as I described.\nMrs Pye has added the following statement, and Mr Pye's subsequent\nnotes upon this, also printed below, record the precautions taken against\nany avoidable blending of the two percipients' memories through a desire\nto show agreement over details. There is, in fact, a discrepancy with\nregard to the geography of the episode ; this appears to be satisfactorily\nexplained by Mr Pye's comment and the fact that he had made a contem-\nporary mark upon a map showing the approximate place where the\nexperience occurred.\nMrs Pye's Statement\nIn June, 1933, my husband and I went to Cornwall for a holiday. We\nstayed at Falmouth first, then decided we would go on to Boscastle. We\nwent to Wadebridge by train and on by 'bus. We had booked no accom-\n\fnov.-dec. 1942 Case: A Collective Hallucination at Boscastle, ig33 177\nmodation, so after we had passed Tintagel we began to look out carefully\nfor anything suitable ; and on our left we saw a jolly-looking guest-house,\nstanding up on a sort of terrace, with tables set out and gay orange and\nstriped umbrellas over. My husband said, \" that looks attractive\". I\nwas surprised, as he generally likes an old place, and this house was\nmodern and fresh-looking and reminded me of Chisenbury Manor, near\nEnford, Wilts. We went on a little further and came to a very attractive\nsign which advertised an Elizabethan guest-house, just off our road, on\nthe left and I at once thought \" Ah ! now Clifford (my husband) will\nwant to go there !'\" By this time we were going down the steep hill into\nBoscastle. When we arrived at the bottom of the hill, our luggage was\nput out on the grass by the side of the road and we went round the village ;\nit was a hot day and Boscastle seemed hot and smelly so we decided we\nwould rather stay at the jolly-looking guest-house which I thought was\nabout i\\ miles back. My husband stayed with the luggage and I walked\nback up the hill, past the turning to the Elizabethan place. And then\nto my amazement I couldn't see the jolly-looking house\u2014so I stood\nup on a gate and had a good look back along the road and still I could\nsee nothing at all. I was very puzzled, but came to the conclusion that\nas the 'bus was travelling quickly, we had mistaken the distance and the\nmodern guest-house must be much nearer Tintagel than we realised. I\nwent to the Elizabethan guest-house and booked rooms there. Then I\nwent back to the bottom of the hill and told my husband what I had\ndone. He thought I was stupid and said, \" Of course the house is there\n\u2014\nbut now we must go to the old place. Another 'bus came from Boscastle,\npicked us and our luggage up and we got out at the turning to the old\nguest-house. Next morning we decided to go back to Tintagel and find\nthe jolly-looking guest-house\u2014but we couldn't\u2014and one day we walked\nalong the road because we were so puzzled, but of course we never did\nfind it and I can only suppose we imagined it was there.\nEdith Pye. 4. 11. 42.\nLetter from Mr Pye to the Editor\n\" Greenford \",\nHardenhuish,\nChippenham, Wilts.\nDear Sir, 5. 11. 42.\nIn accordance with your suggestion I have now obtained from my\nwife her account of our collective hallucination at Boscastle in 1933,\nand this I forward for annexation to my own account which has already\nreached you through Sir Ernest Bennett.\nMy wife's account was written without collaboration with me. I made\nno suggestion whatever as to what she should say and she, on her part,\nasked for no information. She has no written notes of the matter, so\nthat what she has said comes solely from her own memory of the happening.\nYou will note that there is a discrepancy between her statement and\nmine as to the exact spot at which the hallucination occurred.\nThis I believe to be due to a trick of memory. At the time of the\noccurrence she was in agreement with me as to the location, viz., a quarter\nmile or so west of Boscastle, and this was the spot which we first visited\nin our search. She now appears to think that it was somewhere west of\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1942\nTrevalga. This idea arises, I fancy, from the fact that after having spent\na day or so following the event searching the road from Trevalga to\nBoscastle, as a forlorn hope I suggested that we should try back along the\nroad to Tintagel\u2014which we did. It is now some years since we have\nspoken of the matter, and, in the interval, my suggestion seems to have\ntaken root, and given rise to the idea that the spot was actually west of\nTrevalga.\nIn support of my contention I can adduce the following : Had the spot\nbeen west of Trevalga I think it unlikely that I should have asked my wife\nto take a walk there and back on a hot afternoon, of some three miles. On\nthe contrary, had I done so, I should not have experienced the rather\nanxious feeling which came over me at her prolonged absence. It was\nthe fact of her being gone nearly an hour and a half on a journey which\nshould certainly not have taken half an hour, which gave rise to anxiety.\nFinally I have before me, as I write, the map (contained in Methuen's\nLittle Guide to Cornwall) which I had with me on the holiday, and which\nI marked in pencil with the place, as near as possible. The map is on a\nsmall scale (4 miles to the inch) and the mark is just west of Boscastle.\nThat mark was made within a week of the occurrence, and to my mind\nappears to clinch the evidence.\nOne other point arises out of my wife's statement\u2014and that is her\nreference to the house reminding her in appearance of Chisenbury Manor,\nWilts.\nI do not recollect having heard her say so on any previous occasion.\nUnfortunately I have no knowledge of Chisenbury Manor, but I am in\nagreement with her that the house was \" standing up on a sort of terrace''.\nCircumstances at present make travelling, especially to a rather out-of-\nthe-way place like Chisenbury rather difficult, but should a chance arise\nof making a visit there I shall certainly avail myself of it.\nFaithfully yours,\nClifford H. Pye.\nREVIEWS\nThe Journal of Parapsychology. Vol. 6, No. 3. September, 1942.\nThe Editorial in this number touches on the question of hypnosis and\nsketches very briefly the manner in which it has come to be accepted as\northodox. In contrast with this, the difficulty which E. S. P. has met, and\nstill is meeting, in achieving a similar \" graduate \" status is discussed.\nRelevant to these remarks, Dorothy H. Pope and J. G. Pratt contribute\na comprehensive survey of the criticisms raised against the E.S.P. hy-\npothesis since the inception of the Duke research. They point out that\nthis falls into three sections : first, the mathematical, which may now be\nsaid to have been successfully met : second, concerning the technique\nof the experimentation ; here criticism has been fruitful and has resulted\nin improvement of method and precautions : third, criticism based upon\nalternative hypotheses ; this conflict still continues though it may, I\nthink, be fairly claimed that some considerable success against the critic\nhas been won.\nMargaret Pegram Reeves and J. B. Rhine contribute the first of a series\n\fNOV.-DEC. 1942 Reviews 179\non \" Exceptional Scores in E.S.P. Tests and the Conditions\". The case\nreported is that of the child Lillian, aged 9. Her average score over 100\nruns for all conditions was 5\n-\n9i, which was the highest for the group.\nHer exceptional scores were 23 out of 25 in Open Matching and, in the\nnext session, the whole 25 right, also in O.M. The authors discuss the\npsychological conditions which may have led to these exceptional scores.\nThe main report in this issue on new experimental work is on \"A\nConfirmatory Study of Salience in Precognition Tests \" by Betty M.\nHumphrey and J. B. Rhine. The conditions of this experiment were\nsubstantially similar to the earlier studies, already reported in previous\nissues, with the exception that the subjects did not know which of the runs\nwould be checked up immediately and which after ten days' interval.\nThe division into Child and Adult was as before, as was also the method\nused to secure randomisation. By the ordinary C.R. method the experi-\nment showed no significance but the Co-variation of the Salience Ratios\nshowed significance with, in some cases, probability = o-ooi. The\nauthors discuss the Multiple Calling and other alternative hypotheses and\narrive at the conclusion that none of them can account for the results. It\nwould seem therefore that, provided that the deviation of the S.R. co-\nvariation can be held to be sufficient to exclude chance, some fore-\nknowledge must have been possessed by the subjects. The C.R.'s for\nthe SSR-RSR relation for immediate and delayed checking, i.e. for two\ndays' and ten days' interval, were respectively 1-49 and 2-89, which shows\nthat the longer time was no limitation upon performance, thus confirming\nthe conclusions of the previous series. Furthermore, inasmuch as the\nignorance of the subject concerning which runs were to be checked\nimmediately and which after delay was apparently no hindrance to pre-\ncognition, it is suggested that the time interval is somehow short-circuited.\nFurther experimentation along these lines is clearly desirable.\nThe last article is by Charles E. Stuart and Burke M. Smith on \" A\nSecond Study of the Effect of Tempo Rates of Matching\". This carries\non the investigation previously reported. In the earlier experiments it\nwas found that subjects scored higher when matching cards at their\n\" preferred\" rate of movement than at their non-preferred rate. In this\nseries no consistent favouring of rates was observed. The conditions of\nthe two experiments were different and the authors conclude that the\nfailure of the second to confirm the results of the first may be ascribed to\nmarked motivational differences due to the changed conditions.\nH. F. S.\nTelepathic Dreams. By Nandor Fodor, LL.D. The American Imago.\nVol. 3. No. 3. August 1942.\nRecent papers by Dr Ehrenwald 1\nhave drawn renewed attention to the\noccurrence of what appear to be telepathic effects in the course of psycho-\nlogical treatment, and this study by Dr Fodor further enriches the literature\nof the subject. It may be asked why, since Freud's cases recorded in\nNew Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis, so little should have been\n1\nPsychopathological Aspects of Telepathy, Proc. vol. xlvi, p. 224; A Psycho-\ntherapist's View of Telepathy and Mediumship, read at the Private Meeting on\n25 March 1942.\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research nov.-dec. 1942\nforthcoming from a field of observation in which telepathy might be\nexpected to occur with some frequency. We have to remember, however,\nthat the psycho-therapist is not as a rule looking for evidence of telepathy\nand would be apt to regard it as an undesirable distraction from the work\nin hand ; and he may well be deterred by the feeling that he has enough\nresponsibility for making sure that his dream-analysis is valid without\ntrying to establish the validity of evidence for telepathy as well. Dr\nFodor's prior experience as a psychical investigator will have made it\nthe easier for him to take such evidence in his stride.\nIt will be noticed that in several of the thirteen cases described by Dr\nFodor from his own experience in dream-analysis, the presumable\ntelepathic links between his patients' dreams and those experienced by\nhimself and others depend to some extent upon his own interpretation\nof dream-symbols. This is by no means always the case, as in a pretty\nexample which shows a new patient, before the analysis had begun,\ndreaming of hyacinths, which had a special significance for her. At\nabout the same time\u2014within a few days\u2014Dr Fodor dreamed of hyacinths\nwhich could move and speak. He and the patient met, and the patient's\ndream was first mentioned, at a school entertainment ; and their conver-\nsation was interrupted by the opening of a scene in which the children\nrepresented flowers moving about and talking. Such a coincidence at\nleast gives a flying start to Dr Fodor's ensuing argument that the patient's\nthoughts and symbolisms had determined a corresponding imagery in\nhis own dreaming.\nThe thirteen cases discussed are not of equal cogency and in one or two\ninstances, as is duly noted, alternative normal explanations are available\nbesides the standing possibility of chance coincidence. A few cases of\ncoincident dreaming by Dr Fodor and members of his own family are, in\nthe nature of things, difficult to clear from the supposition that images\narising in the dreams might have arisen beforehand in family conversation\nand have been forgotten. In the case of patients' dreams the forgetting\nof normal linkages of mental content seems much less probable ; and in\nregard to accuracy of record, Dr Fodor has the advantage of his practice\nof noting dreams in shorthand when patients report them verbally. In\nnine of the thirteen cases it can be said that direct and obvious corres-\npondences between elements in one dream and in another call for some\nexplanation, apart from any further correspondences that emerge from\nanalysis of the manifest content of the dreams. The validity of these\nfurther correspondences may be held by some to depend a good deal\nupon the meanings read into the dream-symbols at the choice of the\nanalyst, who is thus free to make interpretations that suit any latent\ndesire he may have to expand the evidence for telepathy ; but it can\nfairly be said that Dr Fodor shows no sign of twisting his interpretations\naway from the single aim of therapeutic usefulness. It should also be\nnoted that where Dr Fodor is on more debatable ground, from the\nevidential point of view, he is also exploring those obscurer processes of\nsubliminal activity, the alogical associative processes, among which science\nmay need to seek for the further elucidation of telepathic phenomena.\nK.
