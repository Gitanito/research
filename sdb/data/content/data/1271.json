The celebrated Mr. Addi\u017fon, in his Specta\ntors, No. 117, acknowledges his belief of Pet\u017fons\nbeing ehddwed with pre\u017faging powers.\n_ As the nature of the human mind hath 'been\never the \u017fame, from the creation, its capacity and\naptitude to receive the divine impul\u017fe mu\ufb05 be as'\ngreat, at this moment, as in the mo\ufb05 early ages of\nthe world; and as the benign Author and Gover\nnor of the univer\u017fev has ever imparted it to his\n* cho\u017fen, to be lights and guides to mankind: in the\n' wilds of error and impending di\ufb03culties and dan\ngers, \u017fo we are led to hope that \u017fimilar \u017fituations\nand circum\ufb05ances will be attended with the \u017fame\nbeni\ufb01cent advantages.

Tho\u017fe mea\u017fures that tended to prolong\npo\ufb05erity, or accelerate their down\u017fal, were \u017fore\n\u017fhewn. But their hearts were hardened, and th'eir\nattention diverted from the pro\u017fpect of future vici\u017f\n\u017fitude, by the pro\u017fperity they were then po\u017f\u017fe\u017f\u017fing.\nThey di\u017fregarded the warning voice until ad\nver\u017fity di\u017fpelled their intoxication, and left them,\ntoo late, convinced of the truth, and their own neg_ .\nligence. The fruitle\u017fs \u017fen\u017fe of their own mi\u017fery\nWas the cri\u017fis and con\u017fequence o\u017f their being con;\nvinced of the truth of the prophetic admonitions\nthey had received. ,\nThe unconquerable ob\ufb05inacy of the Jews, who,\nalthough more particularly favoured by the cares of\nProvidence, and who had witne\u017f\u017fed the completion\nof more prophe\u017fies-than any nation under heaven,\nnot only \ufb02ighted the predictions of the birth of the\nMe\ufb03ah, but even rejected the immediate te\ufb05imony\nof their \u017fen\u017fes to the divine truth and reality o\u017f his\nmiracles. ,\nWe arc here \u017fpeaking of the direct: and imme\ndiate in\ufb02uence of the unerring \u017fpirit upon the hu\nman mind, which, by a forcible impul\u017fe, turns its\nview towards futurity, and imparts to it an intuitive\nknowledge of \u017fucceeding events, as far as they re\nlate to certain particular tran\u017fitctions, Providence\nthinks expedient to have revealed. But whether,\nthe natural weakne\u017fs of'the 'human intellect being\nincapableof comprehending (in its full excent and\nenergy) the divine light,\u017fior that, conformably to\nthe' \u017fy\ufb05em of \u017fubor'dinate nature, \u017fomething\nmu\ufb05 be left to exerci\u017fe human \u017fagacity; the \u017facts\nare often repre\u017fented in a manner dubious anc\u017fl ob\ncure.\n1an\nlief;\n[his {\n\f[ 9 ]\n\u017fcure. Metaphorical ideas and \u017fimilitudes are ob\ntruded upon the mind, blended with literal repre\n\u017fentations. The apo\ufb05le, St. Peter, \u017fays of prophe\u017fy, .\n--\" That 'it is a light \u017fhining in a dark place; and\nwe do well to give heed to it until the day dawn.\"\nThis bi\u017fhop Sherlock thus explains: \" The time\nwill come when the things ye hope for \u017fhall be\nplaced in a clear light, when you \u017fhall \u017fee all your\nexpectations fully ju\ufb05i\ufb01ed in the accompli\u017fhment;\nin the mean time, ye do well to attend to prophe\u017fy,\nthough but a \u017fmall glimmering 'light and \u017fhining at\na di\ufb05ance in a dark place, yet the be\ufb05 you have or\ncan have at pre\u017fent.\" This gift then is be\ufb05owed\nupon mankind, not as a re\u017fource for the ab\u017folute\nprevention of the evil foretold, but as a guide to\n\u017fuch as are wi\u017fe enough to embrace it towards the\nmitigation - of calamity, according to the imperfect:\n\ufb05ate of human nature.\nThe greater part of the prophe\u017fies, recOrded in\nthe Old Te\ufb05ament, re\u017fpecting the Jews in p'articue\nlar, and other nations in general, were ful\ufb01lled at\nthe redemption. At that glorious and awful con'\njuncture, when the Son of God, at the command of\nhis father, o\ufb00ered him\u017felf up as a willing \u017facrifice\nto atone for the \ufb01ns of men of all nations, and to\nin\u017fure eternal \u017falvation to all mankind, the Spirit\n. of God de\u017fcended in fuller mea\u017fure, and upon a\ngreater number of the \u017fons of men, of all nations,\n'than at any former period. Then it Was that; not'\nonly the fate 0'f empites and kingdoms, the di\ufb05rac\ntions on account of religibn, and the \u017fu\ufb00erings of\nthe faithful, were foretold, but al\u017fo the duration of '\nthis globe it\u017felfwas pre\ufb01gured ; the \ufb01nal di\u017f\u017folution\nof which is to be preceded by the glorious Milleni\num,\n\f[Io]\nut'nh or reign; of Je\u017fus Chri\ufb05 upon earth for a\nthou\u017fand years. -\nThe Revelations, as expounded by the' able\ufb05 and\n\u017founde\ufb05 divines, teach us to expect, about this\ntime, the de\ufb05ruction of theTurki\u017fh empire, and\nthe gathering together, \u017fettlement, and conVer\u017fion\nof the Jews. For God has declared he will yet re\nmember his cho\u017fen people in his good time.\n* Since the apo\ufb05olic age, although miracles have -\ncea\u017fed, we have yet experienced the mo\ufb05 indubita\nble proofs of the occa\u017fional in\ufb02uence of the \u017fpirit\nof prophe\u017fy. Many recent prophe\u017ftes having been\naccurately completed, leave us no po\u017f\u017fible vdoubt of\nits continuance in the pre\u017fent 'time 3 which \u017feems\nteeming with \u017fuch direful events as truly require\n\u017fupernatural light and information. 4 '\n- The\u017fi coming of the impo\ufb05or, Mahomed, was\npreci\u017fely foretold both by the early Chri\ufb05ians and\nthe Brachmans of India.\nAs to the mode of prophe\u017fy operating upon the\nhuman mind, it appears to be an impul\u017fe entirely\nexternal. The prophetic infu\u017fion is involuntary,\nun\u017fought, and, perhaps, not 'under\ufb05ood by the de\nliverer. Thus the Prophet Daniel, after a vi\u017fion\nwhich' he had \u017feen, \u017faith-\" I heard, but I under\n\ufb05ood not: then \u017faid I, O my Lord! what \u017fhall be\nthe end ofthe\u017fe things? And he \u017faid, \" Go thy way,\nDaniel; for the words are clo\u017fed Up andct\u017fealed till\n_the time ofend.\" The minds even ofidiots and mad\nmen have been in\ufb05antaneou\u017fly endowed with the\ngift of prophe\u017fy, as various hi\ufb05ories te\ufb05ify. Nixon,\nthe Che\u017fhire Prophet, and Martha Ery, of Su\ufb00olk,\nare of thjs remarkable in\ufb05ances.
