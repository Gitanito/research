Thia is a reamrk of a far abler writer\non this fcience than I am. Mr. J. Harris, \u00b7ftudent in\nAftrology and phyfic, bas proved it in a mifcellaoy late-\nly publHhed, that it is poffible \u00a5Id plaufible that a \u00b7prince\nand a chimney-fweeper, or a nobleman and a beggar\nmay be born at the fame time ; but notwitbftanding,\nfays be, the prince will not be a beggar, nor the beggar\na prince. Accordingly as one rifes in the world, fo will\nthe other, according to the fphere they may move in,\n-and -thus will they be fubjea to the fame ebb and vifici..\ntildes offortune. \u00b7Suppofe a nobleman's child commands\nan army, and by difobeying or rebelling againfl his king\nhe gets beheaded : the beggar's child may be a common\n{oldier in the fame regiment, and for a. ftmilar offence\nget hanged : no condition fo high-no eilate fo Jow-\nbut admits of greater brilliancy, or vice verfa. more\nabjea Oavery.\nMuch bas been faid concerning the fate of childre11\nwho are twins, but it does not follow becaufe they arc.\n{o that they are abfolutely born at the fame period.\n\\.; \u00b7 Sometimes there are many hours between their births.\nFew are born nearer than. fiftttn minutes of each other,\nand this in fome particular cafta varies the figure, or ho-\nrofcopc of bicth confiderably. But when they are bom\nnear to the fame time, undoubtedly their fate will be\nJDuch the fame, particularly refpcaing the time of death.\nSome years ago, I knew of two twin lifters, who were\nCo very much alib th~ few could dillinguilb oue from \u00b7\nthe\no;g;1;zed by GoogIe\n\fADDRESS, &c. XV'\nthe other. Even the mother of them drdted tlietn dif.\nferently the.better to diftinguiih them. They lived till\nthey were about four years of age. Ther both bad the\nfmall-pox-one died of it\u00b7; and the other before lhe got\nwell \u00b7of the diforder was fcalded to death, by pulling a\nkettle of water from off tlte fire.-Much more might\nbe faid to prove a limilarity of fortune where the birtht\nare nearly at the fame time.\n\u00b7. Whether or not a mitigation of infortunes may be\nbrought about by means of a fore-knowledge of future\n.events, is a qqerie I have not yet been able to get fatis-\nJaaorily folyed. You, Sir, feem to think that it is pof-\nJible for men in fome degree\u00b7 to avert the e\\'il portents\nof unfortunate pofitions. Much may be faid on this fub.\njea. Certainlyin various diforders incident to human\nnature, much may be done by phyfic; and if fuccefsfully\n:adminifiercd,1his may be faid in fome degree to melio-\nrate ,the evil affe8ion of malefic planetary influence; \u00b7\n.and therefore we fhould look upon it as difficult for an\u00b7\n.aitift to give judgment by a decumbiture, when fomany\n\\rery ~xtraordinary evacuations and revuUions are fre-\nquently made, by the often fuperlative and exhorbitant\npraaiCe of bleeding. purging, and bliftering. For by\n.fuch means as thefe the fiate of the fluids and folids\n.mufl be mecerially altered, and as it .is by heat and moiil.. \u00b7\nure, &c. that the planetary inRuence is(:onveyeCt, and as\nwe k110~ that a deprivation, or fuper.abundance of ei-\nther one or the other\u00b7is the proximate caufe of our indif..\npolitions,.fo we may naturally con~lude, the evacuations\nWore mentiOned, mufl cQn~erably \u00b7a1~ the cafe under\n1:onfideration..\nDigitized by GoogIe\n\fADDRESS, &c.\nconfideration. Formerly phyfic and Aili:ology went\nh#nd in band. No doubt a due knowledge of the afiraf\nc:auft' uf difeafes mull be a grand affilbnce to a judiciotH\nphyfician. But the jargon mixt with the pr..Cticl' of\nmedicine, es difplayed by Paracelfus and others -0t hit\nlime, has only tended-to bring Aflrology into difreputc;\nfor Paraaelfus not content with being thougbt an adept\nin elementary philofophy, likewi~ wilhed the creduluut\nto believe\u00b7\u00b7that his renredies .(which were chiefly tcm\u00b7\n\u00b7pofed of opium or mercury) were brought to hu9\nthrough the means of foper-nalural agl'ncy;: and .indeecl,\nin thofe days, every learned man, or pretender to learn-\nilig, was fuppofed to have his Familiar at his beck. Per\u2022\nhaps it is for this reafoh that even the pure Allrology is\nfo mli~h difcountenanced by the Legiilature-for when\nit is duly confide'1cd how many ignor.mt perfons of botb\nkxes pretend to tell forprifing flories relative 10 abfent\nperfons by fea or land, &c. w ithout knowing even ttie\n<haraaer of a planet, we need not be fo much furprized.\nMankind -\nare:always too apt to give way to extremes-\n;nd having be-en once duped by art, or ignorance, they--\nafterwatds are often found to be infenfibly led aftray\nfrom reafon, truth and conviEtion. This is but little\n~nco'uragement, it muft be owned, for a featcbing and\ninquifiti\\:e mind; for to the \u2022utgar a wrong opinion is\nnever wanting when any thing fubli!'1e is performed\nwhich exceeds their confined comprchenfion. Hence\nit wa!J,. that Dr. Fauftus (who is faid to~ the 6rll i11-\nTentor of printing) was fuppofed to have dealiags with\nthe devi~fo.r by <litbibuung. a mimbcr of bi.tJs among\na\nDigitized by GoogIe\n\fADDRESS, &c~ xvii\n\u2022 ctowd of J>eQple, and eacll perfon 6nding bis neigh.\nbour to ba\\\u2022t an e~aCl: reprefentatioa ~f hit\u00b7own papet'.\nthey tboughi that the Do&or could not come by thcna\nthrou8h any other medium than by the help ol Old\nNick..-AOrologers t<> this day are fuppo~ by fome to\nbl\\~ the farm agency : \u00b7 and Sir Ifaac Newton might\n~rh~pa be ccmtidered by f11,cb as another perfon inc~\ned tiO bis black Highnefs; foe how otherwife could they\nconceiYe it poUible for a man to foretel with fucb pred.\nfion tht! titne when eclipfes would occur, witll maay\n9tbcr fingular pheMmena in mathematics. and natq\nphilofophy ?
