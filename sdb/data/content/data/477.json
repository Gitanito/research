It was agreed to strike off the list the names of\neight Associates, whose connection with the Society had become merely\nnominal.\nTwo presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was accorded to the donors.\nIn consequence of the large demand for Part XXXIII. of the\nProceedings, containing Dr. Hodgson\u2019s further Report on Mrs. Piper\u2019s\nTrance-Communications, it was agreed that it be reprinted. It was\nalso agreed that Part XVII., containing the \ufb01rst Reports on Mrs.\nPiper\u2019s case, be reprinted; the stock of that Part also being nearly\nexhausted.\nThe names of the Members of the Council who retire by rotation\nat the end of the year were read over.

FIsHER remarked that the confusion between two doctors of\nthe same name,* recorded in the paper which Mr. Myers had read,\nrecalled to her mind a curious incident in her own experience which\nhad always puzzled her, and which she thus described :~\nI was at a large meeting of Stuart Cumberland\u2019s, in a country town.\nBeing asked to experiment with him in carrying out a suggestion\npreviously written down, I wrote on a piece of paper\u2014\u201cTake Miss F.\u2019s\nfan and give it to Miss G.,\u201d and gave it to the chairman. I placed\n* See Proceedings, Part XXXIV., p. 21.\n\f. 4 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN.,1899.\nmy \ufb01ngers on Mr. Cumberland\u2019s shoulder, and he walked at a rapid\nrate past the Miss F. I had in my mind, to another part of the room,\nwhere her younger half-sister of the same name, who had come in un\nknown to me with other friends, was sitting. He took her fan and\ngave it rightly to Miss G. Thus he carried out the letter of my wish\nbut not the spirit. It was as if he was guided simply by the name in\nmy mind. Yet I ascertained that he was quite a stranger to these\nsisters, and did not even know their names, having merely come to\nthe town in the course of a provincial tour.\nBefore reading Professor Newbold\u2019s paper, Mr. Myers made some\nremarks to the following purport :\u2014\nThrough the kindness of Professor Bichet, I have been present (on\nDecember 1st and 3rd) at two s\u00e9ances held at his house in Paris with\nEusapia Paladino. The phenomena witnessed were absolutely con\nvincing to all present. Some account of them may probably shortly\nappear in the Journal. But a few words seem to be due from me at\nonce to my previous colleagues in experiment on the ile Roubaud.\nSome of my audience may remember that in 1894 Professor Lodge, Dr.\nOchorowicz and I, by the invitation of Professor Richet, witnessed,\nalong with him, some s\u00e9ances with Eusapia in his Mediterranean island,\n\u2014a place well adapted for such experiments. We were all of us con\nvinced of the supernormal character of certain phenomena then observed;\nand Eusapia was invited to England for the following summer. She\nstayed in my house at Cambridge, July 30th\u2014Sept. 16th, 1895, and\nmet a varying group of observers, most of whom began with a pre\ndisposition in her favour. The phenomena, although inferior to those\nof the ile Roubaud, at \ufb01rst seemed promising; but a peculiar and\nsuspicious holding of one of Eusapia\u2019s hands\u2014described by Professor\nRichet in l893,\u2014was frequently noted, from \ufb01rst to last, by different\nobservers. When Dr. Hodgson arrived, (August 29th), we were able\n(mainly owing to his acumen) to detect and observe the actual pro\ncesses of trickery ; and thus to explain, not indeed all the phenomena,\nbut so large a proportion of them that it seemed very improbable that\nthe unexplained residue was due to any supernormal power. .\nThe general justice of this verdict has now been con\ufb01rmed by\nstatement volunteered to Professor Richet in my hearing during a\ntrance of Eusapia\u2019s on December 3rd, by her trance-personality or\n\u201ccontrol,\u201d to the e\ufb01'ect that Eusapia did cheat at Cambridge.\nFor the four above-mentioned observers the question then arose as\nto the effect of this fresh experience on our interpretation of what we\nhad seen on the ile Roubaud. Dr. Ochorowicz and Professor Richet,\nwhile seeing nothing improbable in the occurrence of fraud at\n\fJAN., 1899.] Concerning Sudden Moral Tran1.sformati0ns. 5\nCambridge, refused to accept it as an explanation of those previous\nphenomena. Professor Lodge, while himself noting and admitting\nfraud at Cambridge, also held that it could not account for the\nile Roubaud phenomena, taken as a whole. I was myself the most\nin\ufb02uenced of the four by Dr. Hodgson\u2019s arguments; and my strong\nconviction of his superior acumen, while not removing my former belief\nwholly from my mind, led me to feel and say that I could not ask any\none else to found a belief in Eusapia upon my own records and\nrecollections. What has recently occurred in Paris leads me again to\nplace more con\ufb01dence in my own impressions on the island, and\nespecially on the skill and judgment of my then coadjutors. I now\nfeel assured that a part of what occurred on the island was genuine;\nand therefore that my then colleagues have been justi\ufb01ed in their con\ntinued attribution of a supernormal character to some of the\nphenomena previously observed.\nAN INQUIRY CONCERNING SUDDEN MORAL\nTRANSFORMATIONS.\n[The following appeal is from Professor Leuba, Ph.D., the well-known\nAmerican psychologist. As he is travelling on the Continent, we have\nconsented to receive for the present the responses which may be sent, and\nperhaps to print any which may seem to throw light upon the supposed\naction of supernormal agencies in effecting these sudden shocks.\u2014ED.]\nMore or less remarkable moral transformations have been known to\nhappen suddenly under various agencies,\u2014 generally spiritual, but some\ntimes merely physical. When the Christian religion is looked upon\nas its agency, the moral renovation is called conversion; but similar\ntransformations take place outside of its pale, within spiritualistic\ncircles and elsewhere.\nSome of them partake almost of the miraculous by their sudden\nness and their depth ; they seem to reach down to the bottom of life,\nto transform the very foundations of character. And yet, despite the\nparamount, practical as well as theoretical, importance for humanity\nof some exact knowledge on the causes and conditions of these\nrenovations, nothing very de\ufb01nite is known.\nThe writer is endeavouring to collect data on this subject; with\nthat end in view, appeal is made to all those who have, under any\nin\ufb02uence whatsoever, experienced a moral transformation remarkable\nin any degree, in the hope that they will not be deterred from answer\ning by lack of time or sheer inertia. Such persons will remember that\n\f6 _ Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1899.\nthey alone are able to furnish the desired information. Appeal is\nalso made to those who have heard of such occurrences, or who are\nacquainted with valuable literature bearing on the subject, that they\nmay let the writer know about them.\nThe answers will be considered as strictly private communications.\n1.

HFT. 3., HERAUsGEGEBEN v. DE. THs. ACHELIs IN BEEMEN.\nVoRLAG voN J. C. B. MoHR, FREIBURG I. B.\nThis is an article by Fr. S. Krauss on the Yoga-trance among southern\nSlavs. The sub-title, \u201ca Guola-Song,\u201d indicates the substance of it. A few\nobservations on phenomena similar to that which is the subject of this very\ninteresting popular ballad are given by way of introduction.\n\fJAm, 1899.] Case in Arehiv Religions Wissenschaft. 7\nA distinction, says Krauss, is usually made between those functions which\nare under the in\ufb02uence of the will, and those which are not; and it is usually\ntaken to be absolute. I can, it is said, put my arm or my tongue to any use\nI like, but I cannot suspend at my will the action of the liver, or the circula\ntion of the blood. Krauss contends that the distinction is not absolute. In\nthe \ufb01rst place, there are cases in which muscles not generally supposed to be\nunder the in\ufb02uence of the will, may be set in motion as the subject wishes.\nKrauss tells an entertaining story of a schoolfellow of his who aroused the\nenvy of all his friends by a very peculiar gift : he could do anything he liked\nwith his ears ; another friend could give the most varied expressions to his\nface by contractions of the eye-muscles, impossible for any one else.\nIn the same way some exceptional people can feel or not feel, according\nas they please. Such was the case of another schoolfellow who would bear\nthe most severe \ufb02oggings without any sign of pain. However, it is not clear\nwhether the boy felt, or merely hid his feelings, for Krauss, comparing him\nto an Indian fakir says : \u201c The only difference is that the fakir conceals his.\npain from religious motives,\u201d whereas the school-boy did so merely to score\noff his master. Other people can go without food for a very long time, and\napparently have some power over the digestive functions. But the most\ninteresting are those who can suspend their heart-beats and fall into the\nYoga-trance. This is a very complicated art : Krauss does not believe it has\nanything to do with mesmerism, or auto-suggestion.\nInstances.\n(a) A certain Frau H. F. (whose full name and address Krauss is in a.\nposition to give) is able to completely simulate death whenever she likes,\nand so perfectly as to take in the most experienced medical men or hospital\nnurses. (This case occurs at Vienna.)\n(b) At the 1895 exhibition held at Buda-Pesth there were two Indian\nfakirs who undertook to fast and sleep publicly. Various experiments were\nmade on them by some of those who came to see them ; needles were stuck\ninto them, burning matches applied to their \ufb02esh ;\u2014they bore all this during\nthe day-time ; but it was more than they had bargained for. At night they\nawoke and gave vent to their opinions as to European civility : they\nstrengthened themselves by eating and drinking against the expected trials\nof the following day. Some one found them out one night, and they were\nset down for frauds and cheats. One of them protested against this accusa\ntion in the Nette Freie Presse (8th August, 1895), and expressed himself as.\nfollows : \u201cThe Yoga-sleep is a science, which, like all other sciences, may\nbe learnt both in theory and practice by any people who have a gift for it.\u201d\nOf course, the word science need not be taken strictly\u2014at any rate the\ntestimony of the fakir is of some importance as a great presumption that this\npeculiar state is self-induced.\n(c) This art has had devotees in Europe : in the year 1845 the prophet\nMilija Krajinoe began to make manifestations in the village of Sumpfe. He\nwas able to fall into a kind of ecstasy or trance and remain in the same state\nfor 5, 6, or 12 days together, neither eating, nor drinking, nor satisfying any\nphysical wants. There is a document in the archives of the Royal Serbian.\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1899.\nMinistry for Home Affairs dealing with the question. Dr. Medovic observed\nMilija in his trance, noted down the appearance of his body, and recorded\nthe tortures he went through without complaining; all attempts to wake\nhim were fruitless ; the most intense smells were put under his nose,\nhairs pulled one by one out of the tendercst part of the skin; red-hot\ncoals laid on his limbs. All these he bore: however, one test seemed to\nhave some effect. \u00a5Vhen they poured down his throat something to make\nhim vomit, he asked for a drink of water. It was then that he confessed\nhow he had learnt by degrees, \ufb01rst of all to go without food so that he could\nremain 20 or 30 days without any nourishment whatever ;\u2014there is some\nirony in the_prophet's confession that he began it all so as to earn a para\nor two from the common people. But although he says : \u201cyou might tear\nthe \ufb01esh piece-meal off my limbs, and I wouldn\u2019t give any sign of suffering,\nso well am I able to bear pain,\u201d this is a rather ambiguous statement: it\nis di\ufb02icult to say whether Milija felt the pain, or whether he had become\ninsensible.\nBut the most striking instance of all is that of the hero of the \u201c Gusler\nlied.\u201d The noble Radovan, son of Knight George, and nephew of the\nVenetian promeditor of Zang, would simulate death, and have a great\nreputation for it. Krauss, in bringing forward this \u201c historical\u201d instance,\nsays that Radovan had this gift in the most healthy and strong period of his\nyouth\u2014he was a far-famed knight, a fearless warrior, etc., all which circum\nstances forbid us in Krauss\u2019 view to believe him hysterical. But when we\nremember that Radovan lived 250 years ago, any discussion of his state of\nmental or physical health will appear futile. The evidence of popular\ntradition can have no scienti\ufb01c weight ; but although it would be extremely\nrash to draw de\ufb01nite conclusions from the ballad concerning the scienti\ufb01c\nmerits of Radovan\u2019s Yoga-trance, I can heartily recommend the reading of\nit to all who are interested in \u201c Volksgesang,\u201d as a valuable, and, I believe,\nrepresentative example of the large collection of popular songs in Eastern\nEurope.\nI need not, for the purposes of the S.P.R., tell the long story over again;\nit is su\ufb02icient to say that Radovan fell into the hands of a king who had\nreason to wish him out of the way. He was shut up in a dark prison; but\nhe planned a very original escape, which is not generally thought of by\nmodern \ufb01ction-writers. He simulated death in the hope that he would be\ncarried out of prison. Unfortunately, he had played this trick before; un\nfortunately, also, the king had a very cunning and a very relentless wife who\nwould not believe Radovan was dead. The two of them put him to all kinds\nof tortures ; they drove splinters under his \ufb01nger and toe~nails ; they singed\nhim with red-hot coals. He does not even wink, the king is fairly baf\ufb02ed.\nBut that cunning queen has all the malice of the Tempter. Radovan\u2019s\ncrime, I may say, was that he loved and was loved by the beautiful daughter\nof this treacherous pair. The queen brought a bevy of fair maidens into the\nprison, among them Radovan\u2019s \u201cGeliebte.\" They sing and dance round\nhim, but even under such a trial Radovan manages to remain dead, until the\nprincess trips up to him, and he can keep his eyes closed no longer. The\n\f.T.\\N., 1899.] Correspondence. 9\nprincess was in the secret, and knew quite well her knight was not dead\npast recalling; this explains her composure. Happily the king and queen\ndid not see Radds eyes open ; but the queen is still relentless, the only way.\nshe can see of killing him off once for all is to trust some faithful servants\nwith his body, send them to the sea-shore in secret, instruct them to tear up\nhis limbs, and throw them piece-meal into the waves. Need I say that her\nhellish project falls through ; that Radovan escapes, that he conquers all the\nenemies, and clears all the obstacles, that stood between him and his true love?\nThere is no lack of incident, it will be seen, in this entertaining ballad ;\ninteresting as it is, however, to the student of literature, we can but regret,\nfrom our point of view as scienti\ufb01c judges, that popular tradition has played\nso fast and loose with the evidence. The fact remains, however, and it is of\nsome importance, that Radovan was believed to be able to simulate death.\nF. N. H.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions e:1:prcssed by Correspondents]\nEXPERIMENTs IN THoUGHT-TRANsFERENCE.\nTour de Peilz, N0vember 14th, 1898.\nDEAR SIR, -\u2014I have been much interested by Prof. Chattock\u2019s experi\nments in thought-transference, all the more on account of its being the \ufb01rst\nset of transferred diagrams since those published by me in the Journal.\nI beg to submit that my own experiments [see Journal, S.P.R., June. 1893,\nand December, 1896.\u2014Eo.] were far more successful, although made at a\ndistance of hundreds of miles and without any knowledge by the percipient\nof the kind of diagrams I was going to send. And I think I can point out\none or two reasons of that difference in the results obtained.\nProf. Chattock says that \u201c the percipient knew in each case what sort of\na thing was to be drawn\u2014e.g. a number of three \ufb01gures, a word of three letters,\nthree musical notes, etc.\u201d\nThere, I believe, was the mistake. The percipient, knowing beforehand\nthat a given number of letters or notes would be sent. could not but try to\nguess, his mind entering into action, and that would, of course, prevent him\nfrom giving his undivided attention to the message sent. The percipient\u2019s\n'mind must remain in a passive state, and his inward vision a perfect blank,\nin a state of expectation.\nProf. Chattock says, moreover, that, after one or two trials, \u201cone gets self\nconscious and excited\u201d and that the experiments fail accordingly.\nThe reason is to be found, \ufb01rst in the fact that both agent and percipient\nwere in the same room, unconsciously in\ufb02uencing and exciting each other,\n-secondly, from their having attempted more than one experiment at a time.\nComplete solitude is necessary, and the quiet of a secluded room, both for\n'the agent and for the recipient. When I experimented with Mrs. M., I\nwas alone in my room, and so was she. And it had been agreed that before\nbeginning the s\u00e9ance, we should both rest from all labour, and remain quiet\nfor at least a quarter of an hour, in order to meet the trial with a self\npossessed and calm frame of mind.\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psych\/ical Research. [JAN., 1899.\nAgain, it was always late at night, ten o\u2019clock usually, at a time when\nall noises have been hushed and silence prevails everywhere. And it was.\nunderstood also that I would never send more than one message at a time.\nA statement made by Professor Chattock has greatly struck me. He\nsays (p. 303) : \u201c It occurs to me that the percipient should be in a partially\ndazed state. . . . Is there any convenient way of keeping oneself in\nsuch a condition ? I thought of watching a slowly revolving disc.\u201d\nTaking for granted, in my defective knowledge of the English language,\nthat dazed means benumbed, I should say that Professor Chattock seems to\nhave hit on one of the fundamental conditions of thought-transference, only\nthat I think this condition of being in a dazed, half-sleepy state should apply\nto the agent as well.\nAs far as I can see in that mysterious phenomenon, the transference takes.\nplace between the subliminal selves of agent and percipient. It is the\nunconscious portion of our complex being that is in constant communication\nwith others, while our conscious activity tends to divide us from our fellow\nbeings. As if there were a common ground of psychical life, out of which\neach individuality shoots up. The more we sink our personality into the\nunconscious substratum of life, the nearer we get to others, and the greater\nthe possibility of communicating with them.\nComing back to my own experiments. I have to say that I used to write\nmy message on a large piece of paper, to put it in a strong light, and to look\nat it \ufb01xedly for \ufb01ve or ten minutes, till I was sometimes half dazed. On her\npart, Mrs. M., lying on her couch, three or four hundred miles from me,\nwould remain with her eyes shut, waiting and waiting, till her hand would\nalmost unconsciously trace on the paper the \ufb01gures or diagrams appearing\non her retina. She was generally in a state of drowsiness, half hypnotic,\nhalf normal, and pretty often she wrote at the bottom of the page, \u201cI am\nso sleepy, that I can hardly \ufb01nish the drawing.\" And sometimes, she even\nfell asleep before having seen anything, in which case, of course, the result\nwas nought.\nI believe moreover that our very remarkable success may be due to the\nfact that there was between us, perhaps, a kind of psychical bond. During\none summer, while in Switzerland, she had suffered from insomnia, and, I\nused to go at night with my daughter to her bedside, and to send her to\nsleep by suggestion.\nSpeaking of my daughter, it reminds me that I have tried thought-trans\nference with her pretty often, at a distance of many miles, with some amount\nof success. And this I have noticed, that in order to have any result I had to\nbe the agent, my daughter the percipient. If we reversed the order, I\nbeing the percipient, we never could get anything satisfactory, and it was the\nsame with Mrs. M.\nIt seems that different qualities of mind are required for playing the\ndifferent parts. Mr. Wedmore\u2019s statement (p. 304) \u201cMy sister could not\nreceive from me and I cannot do so from my brother,\u201d con\ufb01rms that notion.\nThe possibility of the transference of thoughts or images from one mind\nto another has now been proved, I think, su\ufb02iciently. It remains that the\n\fJAN., 1899.] Correspondence. 11\nconditions in which it does take place should be thoroughly investigated,\nand, if possible, the rules of this process accurately exposed.

In this order of phenomena, the geographical\ndistance counts for nothing ; the only distance to be abolished is that\nbetween the minds.\u2014Yours truly,\nAUG. GLARDoN.\nMR. PoDMoRE\u2019s REvIEW oF MR. LAnds \u201cTHE MAKING oF RELIGIoN.\u201d\nSt. Petersburg, December 7th, 1898.\nDEAR. SIR,\u2014I have read with interest Mr. Podmore\u2019s review of Mr. A.\nLang\u2019s The Making of Religion in Proceedings XXXIV. and especially his\nrefutation of some of the criticisms passed by Mr. Lang on Mr. Podmore\u2019s\nmost valuable work Studies in Psychical Research.\nMuch of what he says is no doubt quite correct, and no one deplores\nmore than myself the apparent inability of the agency at work in mediumistic\nmanifestations to supply proofs and tests convincing to the scienti\ufb01c mind ;\nand what are we to say of those critics who, after persistently demanding\nevidence of this character, deliberately shut their eyes when something of\nthe kind is really offered them, and pass on ?\nWith all respect to Mr. Podmore I submit that this is precisely the\nattitude he is maintaining toward the \u201c Physical Phenomena \u201d of Spiritualism,\nas the following examples will show.\nNo doubt a \u201cbalance moving in a locked glass case\u201d (Proceedings\nXXXIV., p. 138) would be good (why not Sir Wm. Crookes\u2019s experiment\non movements of \u201c a pendulum enclosed in a glass case \ufb01rmly cemented to\nthe wall\u201d ?) but ought not the upsetting of objects in a room with doors and\nwindows closed and sealed be equally, or almost equally, good. Now this has\nbeen done by one investigator at least, who is a corresponding member of\nthe S.P. R. besides; viz., Dr. Dariex, of Paris (see Proceedings VII., p. 197);\nin that case the objects upset being chairs, the room being Dr. D\u2019s own ; the\nexperiments being watched by a committee of friends. And yet in his above\nmentioned work Mr. Podmore entirely ignores the case in question, quite\nregardless of the fact that it ought to come within the limits of what he\nconsiders a \u201c test-case.\u201d '\nAnother example. Sir Wm. Crookes\u2019s experiment with Mrs. Fay (with\nthe medium\u2019s hands grasping two wires attached to a battery) has always\nbeen regarded as a most conclusive one, even by those who\u2014like myself\u2014do\nnot wish to press any incidents in the career of so suspicious a medium as\nevidentially cogent. Now what does Mr. Podmore do? He mentions the\ncase in question, but does not even attempt the ghost of an explanation,\nwhich is still more illogical than ignoring it altogether. (Studies in\nPsychical Research, page 62.)\nAgain, it is all very well to speak about the desirability of obtaining\nindependent writing in securely locked slates or hemetically sealed glass\ntubes. To my mind (and why not to Mr. Podmore\u2019s ?) a few words, written\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1899.\n\u201cindependently\u201d by a slate pencil,without any locks or seals but in full view,\nwould be just as convincing, if not more. For there is nothing like seeing\nfor oneself ! Well, cases of the kind do exist. Professor Elliott Coues and\nMr. WilliaIn. Emmette Coleman, of San Francisco, have testi\ufb01ed in print*\nto obtaining \u201cdirect\u201d writing under such conditions. Why their evidence\nshould be absolutely ignored in a work which pretends to deal with all\nscienti\ufb01c testimony to the \u201cPhysical Phenomena\u201d of Spiritualism is a\nriddle I am unable to solve. Here are two gentlemen of scienti\ufb01c eminence,\none of them, a member of the S.P.R., (Mr. Coleman) widely known as an\nexposer of mediumistic frauds (surely a circumstance of some weight!)\nwho come forward and say that, when sitting with a particular medium, they'\nhave repeatedly seen the pencil write of itself upon the slatc\u2014whether\npartly held under the table or simply in the medium\u2019s hand without any .\ntable at all being used ; and that in this way intelligible messages were\nobtained. Well\u2014they may say what they like, in a scienti\ufb01c work which\nprecisely discusses independent slate-writing at length, their testimony is not\nso much as hinted at !\nI might adduce other instances of slate-pencils visibly writing ; in various\narticles printed in the Religio-Philosophic Journal for 1891, Mr. Coleman\nmentions other similar cases ; and I have reason to believe that in his\nopinion genuine \u201c psychography \u201d still occurs in Mrs. Francis\u2019s presence up\nto the present day. I might also refer Mr. Podmore to a letter by \u201c Harry\nAllis\u201d (a well-known writer on the staff of the Journal des D\u00e9bats now\ndeceased) printed in Dr. P. Gibier\u2019s L\u2019Analyse des Chases, who speaks of\nwitnessing something of the kind with Henry Slade ; but I do not lay stress\non any case but Dr. Coues\u2019s as distinctly conclusive of a really supernormal\ncharacter.\nWell, with such instances before us of the treatment some of the evidence\nfor \u201c Physical Phenomena\u201d has received at Mr. Podmore\u2019s hands, we may\nbe justi\ufb01ed in thinking that in other cases too his attitude, though at \ufb01rst\nsight, perhaps, less unj usti\ufb01able, has in fact also been but little in accordance\nwith actual events, and in any case the fact of his having completely ignored\nin Studies in Psychical Research some of the phenomena which approach his\nevidential standard the nearest, should certainly detract something from the\nvalue of his more recent criticisms.\u2014I am, Yours very truly.\nMICHAEL PETRovo-SoLovovo.\nCASES.\nG. 260.\nThe following case, though doubtful of interpretation, appears not\nwithout interest. The important fact about it is the double experi\nence, each independently veri\ufb01ed. As Mr. C\u2014\u2014 suggests, however,\n* Rcligio-Philosophic Journal, February 27th, 1892 (\u201c Independent Slate-Writing\na Fact in Nature,\u201d by Professor Cones), and a few weeks later, Mr. Coleman\u2019s\ncorToboration.\n\fJAN., 1899.] Cases. 13\nit appears possible that a purely natural cause can be advanced, an\nattempt at burglary in a room that might possess a secret entrance,\nalthough a burglar might have done better to take the jewellery from\nthe dressing-table before feeling under the sleeper\u2019s pillow. Nothing\nfurther has transpired concerningr any past history or future experience\nin the hotel in question.\nMrs. C\nHaving lately returned from the Tyrol, I venture to send you a strange\nand unpleasant incident which occurred to me at a hotel on the Italian side\nat \u2014\u2014. We had written for a room, but, on arrival, the landlord apolo\ngised rather unnecessarily for taking us to a room on the second \ufb02oor, in\nwhat seemed the older part of the building. Our room was at the end of a\ncorridor, but the entrance door opened in a sort of lobby projecting into the\nroom. In the recess or alcove formed by this projection stood the two beds,\nmore than a yard apart, with a closed up door between, in front of which\nwere two night tables blocking the door. In the paper on the wall, between\nmy bed and the lobby, there were cracks as if a door had been closed up\nthere also, and there was another on the wall to the right as one entered\nthe room, behind a tall chest of drawers, also closed up. There were three\nwindows. I had gone to bed. How long I slept I don\u2019t know, but I woke\nup with a pull at my bedclothes, gentle, sudden, and decided, and a feeling\nof something near me. I then heard what seemed retreating footsteps\ndown the corridor. I called out to my husband that there was someone in\nthe room. (I should say the door had been locked and was found so in the\nmorning.) His answer was, \u201cNonsense! You have had a nightmare \u201d\u2014\nand he went asleep again. A short time afterwards (I again can\u2018t say how\nlong, but I had remained quite awake), my husband, in a very low voice,\nsaid, \u201cAre you awake\u2019!! I think you are right.\" He got up, lighted the\ncandle, and examined every part of the room, looking under the beds, into\na wardrobe for ladies\u2019 dresses next the third window, and tried the wall in\nplaces where there seemed to be the secret doors. No thing or person was\nfound. He then told me he had felt what seemed to him a small hand softly\npushing under his right side and arms, and that he had some ditiiculty in\nawaking and bringing his senses to bear. Not being easy I kept the candle\nalight. My husband went to sleep again, but I endeavoured to remain awake.\nHowever, I undoubtedly dozed off, and my next impression was that a soft\nhand was pressing and feeling under my side and arm. Half awake and half\nasleep, with a sense of suffocation, I called out \u201c Don\u2019t ! Go away I \u201d I then\nbecame quite conscious, and heard a very heavy tread overhead (there was no\n\ufb02oor above us), then a thud on the \ufb02oor, and then dead silence. I fancied\nalso I heard a cart drive away in the distance. Morning was breaking. My\nmind now seemed quite calmed as if all was over, and I'slept till we were\ncalled. This might all, perhaps, be accounted for by ordinary nightmare,\nbut the curious fact is that we each of us had much the same experience, and\nmy husband was suf\ufb01ciently struck to interrogate the landlord on what had\noccurred, and asked if he knew of any event supposed to have taken place\nwrites as follows :\n\fl~t Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1899.\non the premises-\u2014\u2014this, needless to say, without any satisfactory reply. The\nlandlord was a young man, and had not been there many years. It does not\nappear probable that anyone, either grown up or child, could well have\nescaped from the room when my husband made his examination. He looked\nunder the beds \ufb01rst. The doors referred to above had all been examined\nbefore he retired. and were also blocked by furniture. There may have been\na trapdoor undiscovered. We left early in the morning, and there was no\ntime to make a further search. My husband had his watch and money under\nhis pillow, but all my few ornaments, rings, and watch were on the dressing\ntable.\nMr. 0 adds the following details :\u2014\nWe had dinner as soon as we could, and went to our room almost directly\nafterwards. I was asleep, I believe, before my wife got into bed. She\nwoke me up, saying, \u201c I think there is someone in the room.\u201d I answered,\n\u201c Nonsense, nightmare,\u201d and went to sleep again. My next sensation, a\nhalf-conscious one (I can\u2019t say how long after), was that a small hand was\nfeeling against my right side, and being thrust very gently under it towards\nmy watch and purse under the pillow. (My face was outwards, towards\nMrs. C\u2014\u2014\u2019s bed.) I did not wake very readily, and I seemed to have an\neffort in regaining my consciousness. As soon as I did get awake, I called\nmy wife by name, and in a low voice said, \u201c Are you awake ? I think you\nare right.\u201d I then got up, lit the candle, which was close to my side, and\nsearched the room, as described previously, without result. I told my wife\nwhat I had fancied and felt, and then slept till just before we were called.\nI was certainly tired and dined late, and should have said the whole was\nthe result of indigestion, but it is curious that, to a certain extent, we both\nexperienced the same sensations. Another and more probable solution is,\n~that there may have been someone in the room\u2014possibly a child ; but how\nhe got out of it while I lit my candle is beyond my comprehension, unless\nhe slid down from the window, which was open. Yet here again we were on\nthe second \ufb02oor, and there was, as far as I can remember, no trellis work or\ncreepers against the house wall ; and supposing a burglar, he failed to take\naway anything, although my wife had left her rings and other things on her\ndressing-table. I know nothing about the house.\nL. 01. 1110. Hypermnesic Dream.\nThe following case, received from Mrs. Wynford Philipps, 5, South\nEaton Place, S.W., belongs to a class of which we have printed at\ndifferent times several examples. The question is of course between\nliypewnnesia and clairvoyance;\u2014between a recollection emergent in\nsleep of something subliminally noted during the waking search, and a\n\u201cclairvoyant excursion\u201d during sleep, in which the lost object is for\nthe \ufb01rst time discerned. The present case does not necessarily carry\nus beyond the former alternative.\n\f-JAN., 1899.] Cases. 15\nStatement concerning the \ufb01nding of a Brooch and Watch.\nIn the spring of 1896 I lost a gold half-hunter watch, attached to my\n-dress by a small diamond brooch. The loss occurred as I was walking about\nwith friends in garden and stables of Lydsleys Haven, Pembrokeshire, be\ntween 4.2O and 5 in the afternoon.\nSoon after returning to the house I missed the watch and brooch, and as\nI attached special value to them, we caused the whole garden, gravel walks,\nand stables to be examined by a number of boys and men, and all the straw\nin the stables to be carefully sifted. Still they could not be found.\nThat night I dreamed vividly that I saw the watch and brooch on the\nvery path that I had examined vainly myself, and which had been investi\n_ gated by all the searchers. Next morning, immediately on waking, I remem\nas my own.\nbered the dream, and went straight to the place where the watch was lying,\nhalf hidden by gravel. I at once told all in the house exactly what had\nhappened, and the signature of one of the witnesses is here appended as well\nNoRA PHILIPPs.\nI took an active part in the search, and heard the dream from Mrs.\nPhilipps before she went out in the morning.\nA. C. HEWAT, Secretary.\n1?. 259.\nThe following incident seems to have been carefully watched and\nrecorded, and to have been published, with names of guarantors,\nimmediately after the event. It is extracted from a pamphlet, entitled\nSpiritualisme: Faits Curieuoc, par Paul Auguez, Dentu, Paris, l858:\u2014\nOn December 10th, 1857, we addressed the following letter to M. Morin,\nvice-president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mesm\u00e9rismc, asking him to keep the letter\n-sealed until the complete ful\ufb01lment of the sad event of which we related the\nprediction. The said prediction was as clearly expressed as it was wonder\nful in the extraordinary method of production. We retained a copy of this\nletter word for word. The original, stamped with the postmark, has been\nreturned to us, after the veri\ufb01cation of its date and contents, under the\nfollowing circumstances :\u2014\n\u201c SIR,\u2014About a year ago, after a fruitless experiment in hydromancy,*\n-a young lady, who was with us making these experiments, suddenly saw a\nvery strange scene re\ufb02ected on the polished surface of a glass into which she\nhad been looking a few minutes before.\n\u201cShe saw, she said, a room containing two beds. In one of these she\n-saw quite distinctly a sick person, whose distorted features betokened the\napproach of death.\n\u201c Around this bed were standing several people, amongst whom she could\ndistinguish a young woman and two children, all three dressed in black.\n\u201c Being much astonished at this vision, and not knowing with what to\n-connect it, we asked the experimenter if these persons were known to her.\n\" Divination by means of pictures, which are delineated in the water before the\neyes of the seer. '\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psy\/chical Re-search. [JAN., 1899.\nShe replied at once that the dying man seemed to her to be a friend of\nours, M. X., an employ\u00e9 in a government o\ufb02ice, and that the three persons\ndressed in black must be his wife and his two sons.\n\u201c Although this appeared very strange, we did not attach much import\nance to the matter, for M. X. had a strong constitution, and at that time\nwas in good health.\n\u201cHowever, about three months ago\u2014that is to say about nine months\nafter the vision of which we have given an account\u2014M. X. was suddenly\nattacked by acute bronchitis and congestion of the lungs ; but although his\nillness was pronounced by the doctor to be rather serious, it did not cause\nany great uneasiness.\n\u201cThen the fatal prediction came into our minds, and we were very\nanxious about the condition of our friend, which became more and more\ndistressing.\n\u201c A few weeks ago the disease assumed a more serious character, and as\nthe arrangement of the apartments in which he was living made it impossible\nto nurse him e\ufb02iciently, he determined to take advantage of the privilege\nattached to his position as government o\ufb02icial, and was moved to Val-de\nGrzlce.\n\u201c At the time of writing this letter, the invalid, \ufb01nding himself somewhat\nbetter, has just been taken to the house of a relation, where he hopes to\nstay during his convalescence.\n\u201c At the same time, the disease has not diminished in severity, although\nit is stationary. This is how matters stand to-day, December 10th, 1857.\n\u201c As far as we are concerned, however. the prediction is in some\nmeasure ful\ufb01lled. Indeed, who would ever have thought that a young man,\nin full strength, would, in such a short time, be in such a state as he is to\nday? Who would have supposed that anyone who lived in such comfortable\ncircumstances as our unfo1tunate friend would be obliged by the force of\ncircumstances to have himself taken to a hospital ? Who could have fore\nseen that his family, who had been seen dressed in black, should happen\njust at that time to be in mourning for a relation who had died a short time\npreviously ?\n\u201c We must add further that since M. X. was moved to the house of his\nrelation, after attempts to obtain communications by means of a table,\nfor several evenings, a message, giving the name of M. X., appeared\nspontaneously. Among other things said, in reply to questions asked, were\nthe words :\u2014\u2018 Death warning ! . \u2019\n\u201c We heard later on that at the time when these manifestations occurred,\nM. X. was lying in a state of lethargic stupor, in consequence of the doses\nof opium given him to induce sleep.\u201d\nParis, December 10th, 1857.\nM. X. died a month after this letter was sent.

In that time the Society has had a career of considerable\nprosperity, whether judged by increase in number of members, or in\nregard to the importance of the work done, and published in the\nFroceedings. Of the six retiring Members of Council at the end of\n1898, one, Col. Hartley, had been removed by death. A seventh\nvacancy is also occasioned by the death of Mr. R. Pearsall Smith\nearly last year. The other \ufb01ve retiring members all offer themselves\n\fFm, 1899.] Meeting of the Council. 19\nfor reelection. Two other members had also been nominated. These\nseven nominations being su\ufb01icient to \ufb01ll up the vacancies in the\nelected Members of the Council, the President said that he had only\nto declare that the following were duly elected Members of the\nCouncil :\u2014A. W. Barrett, M.B., J. Milne Bramwell, M.B., Professor\nOliver J. Lodge, F.R.S., Mr. Frank Podmore, Professor H. Sidg\nwick, Sir A. K. Stephenson, K.C.B., Q.C., and Professor J. J.\nThomson, F.R.S.\nThe President went on to say that he had before him an audited\nstatement of the Income and Expenditure during 1898, which would,\nas usual, be printed in the Journal. The Auditor says in his\naccompanying letter :\u2014\u201c I have pleasure in again bearing testimony to\nthe good order in which your Secretary has kept the books, which I\nhavejust audited as to the year lS98.\u201d The statement of Assets and\nLiabilities at the end of 1898 showed an improvement in the position\nof the Society during the year of about \u00a370. This was in great\nmeasure due to the increased sale of the P1-oceedings, outside the\nSociety, especially of Part XXXIII., containing Dr. Hodgson\u2019s report\non Mrs. Piper.\nIn reference to the present position of the Society, the President\nsaid that the total number of names of all classes on the list of the\nSociety on January 1st, 1898, was 911. The elections during the year\n1898 had been 77. Against these were to be set 29 resignations,\n16 removals by death, and 8 names struck off the list, of persons who\nhad been lost sight of, or who had become merely nominal members,\nthus showing the number of the Society at the commencement of the\npresent year to be 935.\nA considerable number of elections took place during the year in\nthe American Branch, but owing to deaths and resignations at the\nclose of 1898, the net result is a gain of one, increasing the number to\n415. It is, however, satisfactory to note that the slight diminution of\nthe previous year has not continued.\nThe President invited remarks from members present. A member\nmade an inquiry as to the \u201c Second Sight Fund,\u201d which was replied_to.\nThere being no further response, the President declared the meeting\n-closed.\nMEETING OF THE COUNCIL.\nThe Council met at the close of the Annual General Meeting above\nreported. The President, Sir William Crookes, F.R.S., occupied the\n-chair. There were also present, Mr. F. W. H. Myers, Mr. St. George\n\f20 Journal of Society for Peychical Research.

It is not easy to see how\nsuch a response can be \u201cmade evidential,\u201d but there is nothing\nincredible in a heightening of aesthetic sensibility in the hypnotic\ntrance. Colonel de Rochas\u2019 letter is accompanied by photographs\nrepresenting the young lady in statuesque attitudes determined by\nmusical phrases. She is, he adds, perfectly \u201c convenable,\u201d and open to\nengagement for drawing-room gatherings or for scienti\ufb01c observation.\nThe further phenomenon here mentioned of \u201c exteriorisation of\nsensibilit_v,\u201d\u2014the transference of sensation from the sensitive\u2019s own body\nto some external object\u2014has not been satisfactorily reproduced, so far\nas we know, by English observers, nor is it clear what part suggestion\n-\n-F\\-'H\n\f22 Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Reseumch. [F1m., 1899.\nmay have played in the recorded experiments. But here are M. de\nRochas\u2019 remarks on his subject\u2019s musical sensibility :\u2014\n\u2018 \u2018 In M\"e- Lina, who presents the phenomenon of exteriorisation of sensi\nbility to a remarkable degree, I separate (d\u00e9clanche), so to say, her psychical\nbody from her spirit, so that, by re\ufb02ex action, the music of a passion produces\nautomatically the gesture appropriate to that passion, although the subject's\nspirit does not perceive the music. The effect becomes intense through this\nsuppression of the intermediary. Curious observations can thus be made\nupon cerebral localisations. Certain notes\u2014the dominant, the mediant, (or\n3rd note), the leading note (major 7th or sensible note), the keynote (or\ntonic)\u2014produce in whatever key, when the subject is attuned to it by a few\nchords, movement of certain parts of the body, always the same. Thus the\nmediant sets the hips in motion, the dominant and sub-dominant the hands,\nthe leading note the lips, etc. When one of these notes returns often in the\nmusic of a dance, for instance, the corresponding part of the body is set in\nmotion, so that one can compose music which shall set going movements\ncharacteristic of certain oriental dances. .\n\u201c Thus for instance a musician among our group brought with him (without\nsaying anything to Lina) some notes which he had taken of the Javanese\ndance, at the time of the Exposition, and he played the music, never\npreviously played in this fashion. Lina at once executed the Javanese\ndance, which consists of movements of the hands alone.\u201d\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by Com-esponde-nts.]\nMR. PonmoRR oN CLAIRvoYANCE AND PoLTERGEIsTs.\n(T0 the Editor of the JoURNAL oF THE SoCIETY FoR PsYCHICAL BsssARCH.)\nSIR,\u2014Will you allow me to make a few remarks on the treatment of\nthese questions by Mr. Podmore in the Proceedings for December, 1898?\nIn my opinion the credit of the Society as a body for the scienti\ufb01c investiga\ntion of a variety of very remarkable and little known phenomena is seriously\ninjured by the method he has adopted\u2014that of omitting to refer to the best\nevidence in the matters he discusses, giving prominence to every possible\nsupposition of imposture on the part of the agents and of incompetence on\nthe part of the observers, and then stating his adverse conclusions with a\ncon\ufb01dence and authority which should only be displayed after a full\npresentation and unprejudiced discussion of the whole evidence available.\nI will only refer to a few examples to justify this statement, as I have neither\ntime nor inclination, nor is it here necessary, to do more.\nMr. Podmore devotes more than \ufb01ve pages to the case of Alexis Didier,\nwho, he endeavours to show, might have been, and, therefore, probably was,\nan impostor. He \ufb01rst describes the mode of bandaging the eyes \u201c generally,\u201d\nwhich was not the more effective mode usually adopted as described by Dr.\nLee and others. He then states that, from the detailed descriptions of many\n\fFm, 1899.] Correspondence. 23\nobservers, he concludes that \u201c the power exercised by Alexis was perfectly\nnormal \u201d\u2014that is, that he saw with his eyes in the ordinary way, and that\nhis reading sealed letters, describing the contents of closed boxes, and\nplaying ecart\u00e9 rapidly and often telling his opponents\u2019 cards as well as his\nown, were, or might have been, all clever trickery. Every di\ufb02icult case\nquoted is explained on this assumption, though acknowledging that this\nexplanation was not necessarily correct. But he continually dwells on the\npossibility of fraud, on the agents having highly-trained confederates, on the\nsimplicity of the numerous witnesses, and on the fact that \u201cthe reports\nwhich we possess are mostly at second-hand.\u201d\nBut in a very well-known work, Dr. Edwin Lee\u2019s Animal Alagnetism, that\nphysician reports, from personal observation, fourteen s\u00e9ances in Brighton\nand Hastings at which a large number of experiments were made, far the\ngreater number of which were entirely successful, and many very remarkable.\nEspecially so was the description of a tin box and its contents in the\ncoroner\u2019s o\ufb02ice at Norwich, Dr. Lee having put into the medium\u2019s hands a\nletter from the coroner in which this box was referred to as a test (p. 257).\nThe reading of passages in books several pages in advance is what Mr.\nPodmore considers to be \u201c most strongly suggestive of trickery\u201d ; but Dr.\nLee gives numerous cases where no opportunity for trickery existed. The\nbooks were often brought by visitors as being old or uncommon, they were\nopened at any page and Alexis marked a line and was then asked to read the\nsame line 10 or 20 pages in advance. The line given by him was usually\nfound at the same level but not at the same number of pages from the open\npage. Many sceptics applied this test with books of their own, and in some\ncases the sentences read were quite unexpected and unusual. Mr. Podmore\nstates that in the accounts he has read, when sealed packages were given\nhim \u201cthe seal must be broken and the contents shown to a sympathetic\nwitness \u201d ; but in the long series of experiments of this nature reported by\nDr. Lee, I \ufb01nd that this condition was required only in one or two cases,\nwhile many sealed packets are stated to have been described correctly while\nunopened.\nThe card-playing, which Mr. Podmore considers to be \u201c most probably\ndeliberate fraud,\u201d happens to be that as to which the evidence that it was\nnot fraud is most conclusive. It occurred at almost every s\u00e9ance, and in a\nnumber of cases cards were named correctly as they lay upon the table\nbacks upwards, while on one occasion a large folio volume was placed\nupright between the two players without preventing Alexis from naming the\ncards in his opponent\u2019s hand. But the absolute proof of the reality of the\nclairvoyance while card-playing is the evidence of Robert Houdin, who has\nbeen called the prince of conjurers and to whom everything that could be\ndone with cards was perfectly familiar.\nAt the request of the Marquis de Mirville he had two s\u00e9ances with\nAlexis, and certi\ufb01ed in writing that he found it \u201cimpossible\u201d to class the\nphenomena \u201c among the tricks which are the objects of my art.\u201d And after\nthe second s\u00e9ance he wrote-\u2014\u201cI therefore came away from this s\u00e9cmce as\nastonished as any one can be, and fully convinced that it would be quite\n\f24: Journal of Society for Psychicat Research. [FEB., 1899.\nimpossible for any one to produce such surprising effects by mere skill.\u201d*\nWith such testimony as this, and that of Dr. Lee himself, What is the value\nof Mr. Podmore\u2019s suggestions of \u201cdeliberate fraud,\u201d or at the best of\n\u201cunconscious jugglery \u201d when in the trance state, together with his \ufb01nal\nsuggestion of an elaborate \u201cintelligence department,\u201d and of \u201chighly\ntrained confederates \u201d as an explanation \u201c not to be summarily dismissed\u201d ?\nAnd such explanations as this, given as the result of an examination of\nthe best evidence, are the more futile when we consider the mass of \ufb01rst\nclass personal testimony to the reality of clairvoyance of the same nature as\nthat of Alexis that is accessible to every enquirer. Such are those by the\nlate Professor Gregory in his Letters on Animal Magnetism (pp. 395\u2014408)\nforming absolutely conclusive tests through an ignorant girl who could not\nread or write, and of a character more marvellous than any of the clairvoy\nance of Alexis. Other cases with the same medium are recorded by Dr.\nJoseph Haddock, M.D., of Bolton, who had her in charge as a patient,\nin the Appendix to his work on Somnolism and Psycheism. In three\nseparate cases this girl recovered lost property when all other means had\nfailed; besides successfully describing distant persons and events unknown\nto any of the persons near her. Dr. Herbert Mayo, in his Letters on the\nTruths contained in Popular Superstitions, gives a successful test experi\nment with a Parisian clairvoyante, he being at the time in Prussia. And\nbesides these we have the Report of the Commission of the Aoade\u2019mie\nRoyale de M\u00e9decine strongly a\ufb02irming the reality of clairvoyance. But all\nthis evidence of men of the highest character and ability, after careful and\noften long-continued personal observation and test, is wholly ignored by\nMr. Podmore in his attempt to show that Alexis might have been, and\nprobably was, an impostor. I submit that such a mode of treating this\nimportant subject is utterly unscienti\ufb01c, is opposed to the rules of evidence\nand of common sense, and is unworthy of the prominent place it occupies in\nthe Proceedings of the Society.\nThe same defects in an even more exaggerated form are found in his\nconclusions as to \u201cPoltergeists \u201d given in his review of Mr. Andrew Lang\u2019s\nMaking of Religion in the same number of the Proceedings. He says that he\nformerly thought it \u201c not improbable that there was something inexplicable\nin these Poltergeist manifestations.\u201d Now, having taken the eleven cases\ninvestigated by the Society, and, presumably, given due weight to all other\nwell known records, he concludes :\u2014\u201c I cannot \ufb01nd any evidence that would\n* Dr. Lee, in his Animal Magnetism, pp. 162-3, gives the essential part of\nHoudin\u2019s two letters ; but in order to understand the full weight of this testimony it\nis essential to read De Mirville\u2019s detailed account of his interviews with Houdin, and\nof the s\u00e9ances with Alexis, to which Houdin went with the full belief that he could\nexpose him. This most interesting account occupies the \ufb01rst chapter of De Mirville\u2019s\ngreat work, Des Esprits et de leurs Jllanifestations Fluidiques, which is in the Society\u2019s\nlibrary. Houdin also tested the reading of closed books; and Alexis informed the\ngreat expert of a fact relating to one of his most intimate friends, which Houdin\ndeclared at the time could not possibly be true, but which he afterwards acknowledged\nto be correct. (See Des Esprits, I., p. 26, footnote.)\n\fFRn, 1899.] Correspondence. _ 25\njustify such a supposition (that is, that there is anything inexplicable in\nthem) even as a working hypothesis.\u201d Then, after nearly two pages of reply\nto Mr. Lang\u2019s criticisms he thus concludes :\u2014\u201cFor myself, I am grieved to\nthink that the Poltergeist should go. He was a more picturesque \ufb01gure than\nthe naughty little girl who takes his place. There are too many naughty\nlittle girls on this planet already.\u201d\nIf this judgment is given on the eleven cases alone, the evidence for\nwhich he has adversely criticised, then he should not state in such positive\nterms a conclusion founded upon such utterly inadequate evidence. If, on\nthe other hand, his words\u2014\u201c I cannot \ufb01nd any evidence \u201d\u2014imply that he\nhas considered the best of the existing testimony, then so positive a conclu\nsion should not be stated without at least pointing out the grounds on which\nhe rejects it. For it is the case that no class of psychical phenomena rests\non such an extensive basis of well attested facts\u2014facts which were at the\ntime, and have ever since remained, inexplicable by other than a super\nnormal cause. I will, therefore, brie\ufb02y enumerate a few of the best\nattested of these cases for the bene\ufb01t of such readers as are not acquainted\nwith them; seven which occurred during the present century and two\nearlier ones.\n1. The Drummer of Tedworth, as the disturbances at the house of Mr.\nMompesson in 1662 are usually termed, deserves attention, both because it\npresents the main features of all these cases, and especially because it was\nrecorded by a contemporary and eye-witness of the highest character and of\nexceptional ability, the Rev. Joseph Glanvil, a fellow of the Royal Society\nand a writer on the Baconian philosophy. In this case \u201c the naughty little\ngir \u201d was 10 years old, and the disturbances continued for two years, to the\ngreat distress of Mr. Mompesson who would have been delighted to have\nhad the cause of it discovered. The disturbances consisted of various\nnoises, knockings, scratchings, and drums heard as if over the house;\nshaking of the \ufb02oor and of the whole house; the children\u2019s clothes and other\narticles thrown about the room, and chairs and stools moving about by\nthemselves in the presence of numerous witnesses. The noises were some\ntimes so loud that they were heard in the \ufb01elds near and even awakened\npeople in the village at a considerable distance. Mr. Glanvil himself heard\nthe knocks and scratchings continuing for half an hour while the children on\nwhose bed it occurred were lying quite still with their hands outside. He\nalso heard loud pantings as of a large dog, which was so violent as to\ncause the windows and the whole room to shake. The account is given in\nconsiderable detail in Glanvil\u2019s Surlducismus Triumphatus, and I cannot\nunderstand how anyone admitting, as Mr. Podmore does, that \u201cit is solely\na question of evidence,\u201d can come to the conclusion that we have here no\nevidence of anything inexplicable, \u201c even as a working hypothesis.\u201d\n2. Half a century later, in 1716, we have the remarkable disturbances at\nEpworth Parsonage, Lincolnshire, where the Rev. Samuel Wesley was\nrector. Here again we \ufb01nd exceptionally good contemporary records by\nvarious members of the Wesley family, all far above the average in\nintelligence and freedom from superstition. Samuel Wesley himself kept\n\f26 Journal of Society for Peychical Research. [FEB., 1899.\na journal in which all the chief occurrences were described, and there are\nalso numerous letters from various members of the family to their friends\nand to John Wesley, describing the various events as they occurred. It is\ninteresting to note that the manservant who \ufb01rst heard the noises and\nwitnessed the movements of various articles, had no fear whatever, and\nthat each member of the family in turn, when told of what had happened,\nentirely disbelieved that there was anything that could not be soon explained,\ntill he or she had witnessed the phenomena, when it was perceived to be\nwholly beyond their experience and utterly inexplicable by any known\ncauses. At length the whole household\u2014nine or ten persons\u2014witnessed the\ndisturbances, Mr. Samuel Wesley being the last and most incredulous, and\nhe too was forced to admit that they were wholly abnormal.\nThe noises were of various kinds, knockings, footsteps, and creaking or\ndrumming noises, which moved about to various parts of the house while\nbeing followed, but no cause for which could ever be detected. Often there\nwere tremendous bangings and clashings as if heavy lumps of coal were\nrolling down the stairs, or all the glass and china in a cupboard smashed to\npieces, yet nothing could be found. Movements were also varied. Hand\nmills were whirled round, windows rattled, door-latches moved up and down\nmaking a great clatter. On one occasion, when Mr. Wesley went to his\nstudy, of which he always kept the key, the door was pushed back against\nhim as if by a person inside, but there was nobody. Then began a knocking\nin various parts of the room, and he was pushed against his desk as by an\ninvisible person. Often the noises were so loud and varied that for the\ngreater part of the night no one could sleep. The disturbances lasted with\nmore or less violence for two months and then wholly ceased. Many of the\nsounds were of a nature that no one could imitate, and were often such that\nno person could produce without instant detection. The letters and journal\nwere preserved and were published by Priestly in 1791, and by Dr. Adam\nClarke in his lllemoirs of the Wesley Family; while John Wesley himself,\nin 1720, collected the evidence of all the witnesses and published his account\nin the Arminian Magazine.\nHere surely is another case in which the evidence of \u201csomething\ninexplicable\u201d is both good in itself and demonstrative of inexplicability.\nIt is widely known and easily accessible. Yet Mr. Podmore says :\u2014\u201cI\ncannot \ufb01nd any evidence\u201d to justify the supposition of \u201c inexplicability.\u201d\n3. Coming to the present century we have \ufb01rst the case of the castle\nof Slawensik, in Silesia, in 1807. These disturbances were witnessed by\nCouncillor Hahn and Cornet Kern, both young men of good education and in\nperfect health, and free from all superstitious ideas. For more than two\nmonths they witnessed almost daily and nightly the most extraordinary\nphenomena. Pieces of lime appeared to fall from the ceiling and \ufb02ew about\nthe room to such an extent that the whole \ufb02oor and tables were often\ncovered, yet the closest examination could not detect any sign of its having\ncome from the ceiling. Noises were heardlike hammering on boards or the\nsounds of distant artillery. But most extraordinary were the movements of\nalmost every loose article in the room, such as knives, forks, brushes,\n\fFm, 1899.] Correspondence. 27\nslippers, soap, candlesticks. Sometimes these things would rise from the\ntable before the eyes of both of them and then fall to the \ufb02oor. Many\nother persons, o\ufb02icers, inspectors, tradesmen, and visitors saw the same\nthings, and no witness of them could ever suggest a natural explanation.\nHahn soon became greatly interested in these strange occurrences, applied\nmany tests and kept a careful record of them. And he especially notes, in\nreply to the objection of delusion, that whenever several persons were\npresent, after each abnormal event he asked each person what he saw or\nheard, and in every case all witnessed the same thing; while many of the\nphenomena happened while he was entirely alone.\nHe gave his narrative of these events to Dr. Justinus Kerner, who has\npublished it in his book on the Seeress of Prevorst (pp. 274\u2014289 of Mrs.\nCrowe\u2019s translation), and a good abstract is given in Dale Owen\u2019s Footfalls.\nHere again we have absolutely inexplicable occurrences, and the evidence\nfor them must certainly be classed a exceptionally good.\n4. We now come to the remarkable bell-ringing at Major Moor\u2019s house,\nGreat Bealings, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, in 1834. It began on February\n2nd, and continued almost daily till March 27th. The most careful exam\nination and observation by the Major and his friends failed to discover any\nnatural cause. All the bells rang either together or separately, except the\nfront door bell, which would be the most easy to play tricks with. They\nrang just the same when all the servants were brought together by Major\nMoor; and also in the presence of reporters and others. The violence of the\npeals and the rapidity of the moving bells could not be imitated. Major\nMoor wrote an account of the disturbance in a letter to the Ipswich Journal,\nand besides many inadequate or foolish attempts at explanation he received\nletters from all parts of the kingdom describing similar occurrences in various\nhouses. A clergyman, who wrote from a rectory in Norfolk, described\nvarious loud and disturbing noises resembling those at Epworth, which had\nbeen heard by himself and family for nearly nine years, and which could be\ntraced for sixty years back. Lieutenant Rivers had equally mysterious bell\nringing with those at Bealings in his rooms at Greenwich Hospital. Constant\nwatching by himself, by friends, by the o\ufb02icial surveyor and bell-hanger,\nfailed to discover any cause whatever. This ringing lasted four days.\nIn a little book called Bealings Bells Major Moor gives an account of\nhis own case and those of the various other persons who had communicated\nwith him; and the whole constitutes a body of facts attested on the best\npossible evidence, which is alone su\ufb02icient to demonstrate that \" something\ninexplicable \u201d of which Mr. Podmore declares he cannot \ufb01nd any good\nevidence at all ! *\n5. ln 1838 a violent outbreak of stone throwing and other disturbances\noccurred at the farmhouse of Banchory, in Aberdeenshire. On the 5th\nof December and for \ufb01ve days after, great numbers of sticks, stones, and\nearth-clods \ufb02ew about the yard and struck the house. Hundreds of persons\n* This book is in the library of the Society, and; good summary of the facts is\ngiven in Owen\u2019s Debatablc Land, pp. 239-245.\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychtcal Research. [Fss.,1B99\ncame from far and near to see the marvel and none could \ufb01nd any cause.\nThen for two weeks the disturbances occurred inside the house, where knives,\nplates, mustard pots, \ufb02at irons, and many other articles \ufb02ew about the room\nor came down the chimney. Sometimes they \ufb02ew from room to room ; and\nthere were also tremendous knockings on the doors and roof, while sticks\nand stones \ufb02ew against the windows and broke them. People for 20 miles\nround came to see the phenomena, including farmers, gentry and clergy\nmen, but could \ufb01nd no explanation. At length the two servant-girls were\n\u201cstrictly examined\u201d and sent to prison, and as the disturbances then ceased\nthe conclusion seemed to be that they must have done it all, although of the\nhundreds who had been present no one ever saw them do a single thing.\nThe phenomena were closely like those at the castle of Slawensik, and\nsuggest a common cause. The case is reported by Mackay in his Popular\nDelusions and is summarised in Owen\u2019s Footfulls, p. 183.\n6. The case of Mary Jobson of Sunderland, in 1839, is especially in\nteresting because she was attended by Dr. Reid Clanny, F.R.S., who\npublished an account of the extraordinary things witnessed by himself and\nalso by three other medical men and other persons, sixteen in all. The\nphenomena consisted of violent knocking, footsteps, doors opened and shut,\nvoices, music, water thrown on the \ufb02oor, and beautiful designs appearing\non the ceiling, all without any discoverable cause ; and all in presence of a\nsick girl of thirteen who had been long treated for a mysterious disease by\nbleeding, blistering, and purging which almost killed her. A short abstract\nof Dr. Clanny\u2019s publication is given by Howitt in his lfistory of the Super\nnatural, Vol. II., p. 450. Dr. Clanny was ridiculed and persecuted, but\nalways maintained his \ufb01rm conviction of the reality of these inexplicable\nphenomena.\n7. The disturbances in a burial-vault beneath a chapel in the public\ncemetery of Arensburg in the island of Oesel, in 1844, are noteworthy,\nbecause they were o\ufb02icially inquired into by a commission consisting of\nBaron de Goldenstubb\u00e9, the Bishop of the province, :1 physician, the Burgo\nmaster of the town, and two members of the Consistory. The disturbances\nconsisted in the co\ufb02ins which had been placed side by side in the vault,\nbeing found, on the occasion of a funeral, to have been displaced so as to\nlie on each other in a confused heap. They were put back in their places\nand the doors securely locked, but when privately inspected shortly after\nwards by the Baron who was president of the Consistory, they were found\nin the same disorder as before. After satisfying themselves that the\nfoundations and \ufb02oor of the vault were untouched, and that there was no\nsecret entrance, the Commission had the cot\ufb01ns replaced, and \ufb01ne wood ashes\nwere strewn over the pavement of the vault, the stairs, and the \ufb02oor of the\nchapel. All the doors were locked and doubly sealed with o\ufb02icial seals, and\na guard of soldiers watched the building for three days and nights. Then\nthe members of the Commission returned, found the seals intact, the ashes\nthroughout the chapel, stairs, and vault, wholly undisturbed, and with no\nmarks of footsteps; yet all the co\ufb02ins but three (as before) were scattered\nabout in confusion, the lid of one had been forced open, and several others,\n\fFm, 1899.] Correspondence. 29\nthough very heavy, had been set up on end. An o\ufb02icial report was drawn up\nstating these facts, and was signed by all the members of the Commission ;\nit is preserved with the archives of the Consistory, and may be seen by any\nrespectable visitors. The disturbances are said to have continued for some\nmonths longer, when it was determined to cover the co\ufb02ins thickly with\nearth so as completely to bury them, after which no further disturbances of\nany kind took place. The facts are stated by R. D. Owen in his Footfalls,\np. 186, he having obtained them, in 1859, from the daughter and son of\nBaron Goldenstubb\u00e9, who were living near at the time and heard of all the\noccurrences when they happened. Here, again, we have the best evidence\nas to occurrences which were, and are, wholly inexplicable.\n8. Stone-throwing in Paris. This is remarkable as having been watched\nby the police for three weeks continuously without detecting the cause. A\nsmall house in a populous quarter, but isolated by the removal of other\nhouses, was, as stated in the police report, assailed \u201cevery evening and\nthrough the whole night by a hail of projectiles which, from their bulk and\nthe violence with which they have been thrown, have done such destruction\nthat it has been laid open to the day, and the woodwork of the doors and\nwindows reduced to shivers, as if it had sustained a siege, aided by a.\ncatapult or grape shot.\u201d The stones, etc., appeared to come from a great\nheight in the air, and all the powers of the police, employed day and night\non the spot, were never able to discover the cause.\nThis case is referred to in Owen\u2019s Footfalls, but a fuller account is given\nby De Mirville in his work Des Esprits. I have given a full account,\ntranslated from La Gazette des Tm'bunauac (the o\ufb02icial organ of the French\npolice), in my Miracles and Modern Spiritualism, p. 284, which was veri\ufb01ed\nby a literary friend at the British Museum as an exact translation. A later\nnotice declared that \u201cthe phenomena remain inexplicable,\u201d and De Mirville\ntells us that nearly a year afterwards he enquired of the police, of the\nGazette, and of the owner of the house, who had suffered serious loss both in\nhouse and furniture, but nothing whatever had been discovered. (Des\nEsprits, Vol. I., p. 384.) Yet Mr. Podmore tells us that he can \ufb01nd no\nevidence of any such inexplicable occurrences !\n9. The next, and in some respects the most remarkable case to be cited,\nis that of the disturbances in the house of the parish priest of Cideville,\nSeine Inferieure, in 1851, which lasted two months and a-half, and was the\nsubject of a law-suit for defamation of character, during which all the main\nfacts were legally established and duly recorded. The story is a long and\ninteresting one, and is given in full detail in Dale Owen\u2019s Footfalls, pp. 195-\n203, and, brie\ufb02y, in my Miracles and Modern Spiritualtsm, p. 79.\nThe phenomena were much the same as in the other more violent\ndisturbances already described. Tremendous knockings, scratchings, and\nshakings of the house occurred, sometimes as if everyone in the house were\nsimultaneously beating the \ufb02oors with mallets ; \ufb01re-irons, hammers, tables,\ndesks, and other articles moved about the rooms in the presence of many\nwitnesses, without any apparent cause. The Marquis de Mirville, who\nowned property in the neighbourhood, the Mayor of Oideville, and many of\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psycluical Research. [FRs., 1899.\nthe gentlemen, ladies, and clergy of the country round. witnessed these\nphenomena and gave evidence before the court, which sat while the disturb\nances were still going on. A full summary of this case is given by De\nMirville ; with the detailed judgment of the Court and the more important\nparts of the evidence (Des Esprits, Vol. I., Chap. XI.) and every reader of\nthis narrative must agree with Dale Owen\u2019s concluding remark, \u201cI doubt\nif it be possible to \ufb01nd a case more explicit or better authenticated than the\nforegoing.\u201d\nIn conclusion, I maintain strongly that the nine cases I have here brie\ufb02y\nsummarised rest upon emphatically good evidence, and are of such a nature\nas to be quite inexplicable on any supposition of delusion or imposture. And\nfurther, I maintain that they are quite as worthy of attention and of equal\nweight, as if they had been observed and described by Mr. Podmore himself\nor by any of the most trusted members of the Society for Psychical Research ;\nwhile they rest on better evidence, and have every one of them greater\nimportance whether on account of their duration, the nature of the\nphenomena observed, or the character and ability of the witnesses than even\nthe best of the eleven cases by criticising which Mr. Podmore founds his\ngeneral conclusion, that he can \ufb01nd no evidence whatever of any of these\nphenomena being genuine or even \u201cinexplicable,\u201d and that the only\n\u201c Poltergeists\u201d are \u201c naughty little girls.\u201d I therefore urge that his mode\nof treatment as regards this wide-spread and important class of psychical\nphenomena, is utterly inadequate and unscienti\ufb01c, and therefore unworthy\nof a place in the Proceedings of the Society. ALFRED R WALLACE\nNoTR.\u2014Besides the above, every enquirer should examine the cases of\n\u201c Stone-throwing\u201d given by William Howitt in three articles in Vol. VI. of\nthe Spiritual Magazine. Several of these are as marvellous and as well\nattested as those here given, especially that of another French parsonage in\n1835 (p. 51), and one in Ceylon in 1863 (p. 66). Numerous cases are also to\nbe found in the later volumes of this magazine.\nMR. PoDMoRE, PoLTERGEIsTs, AND KINDRED SPnuTs.\nI have read with interest Mr. Podmore\u2019s review of my Ma\/ring of Religion,\nwith the Religion left out. It is amusing, indeed, to \ufb01nd a psychical re\nsearcher dissatis\ufb01ed with the methods of anthropology, whereof psychical\nresearch, to my mind, is only a branch. But true it is that in anthropology\neach inquirer is only too apt to \u201cselect whatever facts best suit his views.\u201d\nFor that reason I produced many facts which my brethren (except Mr.\nTylor, whose views are not mine) had overlooked. The \ufb01eld is so vast that\nour generation can best employ itself in routing out and examining facts (or\nstatements), but many inquirers have been taking it for granted that every\nthing is already found out, and pigeon-holed, and accounted for. My poor\neffort is to show that this is a wrong opinion.\n(1). Leaving Religion out, Mr. Podmore asks (p. 131) whether \u201cthe\nattitude\u201d of a young lady lying bare-foot on a sofa was not perhaps a\nfamiliar one? I asked at the time; it was highly unfamiliar, and, for\n\fFm, 1899.] _ Correspondence. 31\n_4___-~-\nreasons, unadvisable. Hence the maternal anxiety to know whether her\ndaughter had been the bare-foot lady of the crystal vision. She had been\nthis lady\u2014or, at all events, she had been in the attitude. I may add that I\nhave other new cases of savage crystal gazing, and I think that psychical\nresearch can no more afford than other sciences to overlook savage anticipa\ntions of such experiences. Mr. Frazer has shown, in his Pausam'as, that for\nlack of anthropological lore the science of classical antiquities has often been\nleft in ignorance or abandoned to wrong explanations. Indeed, I have\nshown as much myself.\n(2). P. 131. It is not on \u201c aesthetic \u201d grounds that I distrust Mrs. Piper.\nWe want proof of the identify of her spirits. Now when the souls of English\ngentlefolks talk the argut of the American lower middle classes, they demon\nstrate that they are not what they are alleged to be.\nMy Book of Dreams and Ghosts was, professedly, intended to entertain.\nBut, far from preferring \u201csmooth and \ufb01nished narratives,\u201d I went, when\nI could, to contemporary MSS. (as of the Villiers story) in place of being\ncontent with \u201c psychical brie-a-brac restored\u201d in Wardour Street. So I went\nto the contemporary newspaper which Mr. Podmore had neglected, for the\nWorksop polte'rgeist, as he very candidly admits. Mrs. Piper is too\n\u201cincoherent \u201d for me. and I regret that I destroyed my minute criticism of\nher revelations to Mr. Lodge. But I think I can return to the inquisition of\nthis story.\n(3). I don\u2019t \u201cchampion a supernormal interpretation.\u201d (p. 133.) I\nchampion the method of \u201c\ufb01ling for reference\u201d certain cases, as against\npaying ourselves with a theory of collective hallucinations of odd uniformity\nand wide diffusion. I fear I don\u2019t understand Mr. Podmore\u2019s distinction\nbetween \u201c things done,\u201d and \u201cphenomena described,\u201d or, if, on re\ufb02ection,\nI do understand it, the contemporary evidence, \u201cin almost complete agree\nment \u201d with what Mr. Podmore collected \ufb01ve weeks later, convinces me that\nthe things described were done, somehow or other. Mr. Podmore admits that\nhere his theory of later embellishment breaks down. In Mr. Bristow\u2019s\ncase \ufb01ve years elapsed, but I conceive that an intelligent man can remember\nthrough \ufb01ve years a set of phenomena which struck him as most remark\nable. If the phenomena had been normal, say a love affair of his own,\na boat race, or a cricket match, and if he had been deeply interested in\nthem, I should expect an intelligent witness\u2019s evidence, after \ufb01ve years,\nto be good. Much of our history rests, with fair security, on evidence\nseparated by more than \ufb01ve years from the events. So I prefer, not to\nchampion a supernormal theory, but to wait and do without a theory,\nespecially a theory so thin as Mr. Podmore\u2019s \u201cnaughty little girl\" (in\nsome cases where no girl is heard of) or his theory of later embellish\nment (which broke down at Worksop) or his amazing theory of uniformly\ndiffused collective hallucination as to the \ufb02ight of objects. These may\nbe as good as other theories, but why have a theory at all ?\nIn the case of Homes levitation I misunderstood Mr. Podmore\u2019s meaning.\nHe means that, not when Home came into room A, but when he was seen to\n\ufb02oat out of room B by three educated gentlemen, he merely pushed out his\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psyckical Resem-ch. [FIn3., 1899.\nhead and shoulders. They had previously, they say, \u201cseen Home \ufb02oating\nin the air outside\u201d the window of room A. I do not know what happened,\nreally, but I cannot possibly accept the head and shoulders hypothesis.\nAs to Sir W. Crookes being unable to see a piece of asbestos cloth in\nHome's hand by the light of two candles and the \ufb01re, I may leave that to\nSir W. Crookes. To be unharmed by \ufb01re is not \u201cwithout parallel or\nanalogy.\u201d A case, carefully investigated by two physicians in the open air,\nwas published lately by them in a New Zealand paper. I understand that\nthey will put forth an ampler account in the local Scienti\ufb01c Proceedings.\nEn\ufb01n, I have no theory of these things. But my reasoning faculties\nrise up against Mr. Podmore\u2019s theories, and, till a better occurs, I live\ncontentedly without an explanatory hypothesis. Let me acknowledge the\nextreme courtesy of Mr. Podmore\u2019s comments on my rather testy observa\ntions.\nSt. Andrews, January 18th, 1899. A. LANG.\nCASE.\nL. 1111. Ae P\"\nAlthough the following case is remote in date, the incident is one\nwhich could scarcely have been subsequently imagined,\u2014or even\nseriously confused by lapse of memory.\nMr. Hyndman writes as follows, under date November, 1898 :\u2014\nOn December 26th, 1872. my husband, Francis Hugh Hyndman, left\nCalcutta on a steamer, intending to return in about ten days.\nHe left me quite well, but in the morningr of the next day, when off the\nSunderbunds, he had such a strong presentiment that I was seriously ill,\nthat he arranged to return at once by a river steamer, although at great\ninconvenience. He reached home at about 5 p.m. on that day to \ufb01nd me\nvery ill with Asiatic cholera. I felt very ill on the morning of the 27th, but\nkept up until noon, helping a friend to nurse her husband who was dying of\nthe same complaint.\nAbout noon I left my friend\u2019s house, after her husband\u2019s death, to return\nhome and go to bed, at about which time my husband must have been start\ning on his return journey.\nI was quite alone at the time with only native servants, one of whom I\nsent for the doctor, but I took the usual speci\ufb01c in rather a large quantity\nand went to sleep for about two hours. Soon after I awoke, my husband\narTived. A few hours after, I became unconscious and have no distinct\nrecollections for some time.\nI do not remember having distinctly wished for my husband\u2019s return, as\nI thought it was impossible.

The Lower\nHall had been secured for the occasion. Less luxuriously seated thRn\nthe Upper Hall, in which all meetings have hitherto been held, it\naccommodates a somewhat larger number; and Professor Richet\u2019s\npresence attracted a very full and attentive audience. Sir W.\nCRooKEs, F.R.S., was in the chair, and introduced Professor Richet to\nthe meeting as one of the leading scienti\ufb01c men in France, Professor\nof Physiology at the University of Paris, and one of the two lecturers\nselected by the Council of the British Association to deliver a lecture\nbefore the Association at their meeting at Dover in September next.\n\u201cAlthough,\u201d continued Sir W. Crookes, \u201cit only remotely bears on\nour present subject, I should like to make a quotation from Professo\nRichet\u2019s letter accepting this invitation. He says :~\u2018If I thus gladl\naccept the invitation it is because I agree with you that the dissen~\ntions separating our two countries-\u2014countries which ought to be ,\nanimated by mutual respect and goodwilI\u2014are absurd and even\ncriminal.

Thus, to the extent of my powers will I do\nmy best to dissipate misunderstandings and allay ill\u2014i'ee1ings.\u2019\n\u201cA\n\u201c This letter was written some months ago when circumstances were\ndifferent from what they now are.

[MAR., 1899.\nW\n- to-day a renewed token of friendship.\ncordially expressed, and we see in Professor Richet\u2019s visit to us\n(Applause)\nut Professor Richet has other peculiar claims on our regard and\nattention. He is the pioneer of experimental psychical research in\nFrance, where public opinion is behind that of this country in its appre\nciation of the importance of the subject. Under the many discourage\nments incidental to the study of an unpopular subject he has worked\non with in\ufb01nite patience. He has gained success in experimenting\nwith psychically endowed persons by his sympathy and kindness, and\nis researches in multiple personality, especially in the case of\n\u2018 L\u00e9onie,\u2019 are well known to all of us. In the much debated branch of\nenquiry included in the term \u2018 hypnotism at a distance \u2019 he has achie\"ed\nremarkable results. He however is specially known to us by his long\nand -patient investigation of the abnormal powers ascribed to Eusapia\nladino. Here he has not been deterred by the undoubted instances\n\u00bb of cheating which occasionally so gravely complicate genuine\nlp\/heno1negna. Recognising that Eusapia\u2014an unlettered Neapolitan\npeasant\u2014was in mental development a mere child, and not so\ngravely guilty as better educated cheats, he persevered, being forti\ufb01ed\nby numerous instances of phenomena which cheating, as he considered,\ncould not possibly explain. And since he remained throughout fully\nalive to the grave danger of palliating cheating and condoning trickery,\n' ' '1~~think that Professor Richet, whatever the actual facts may be,\n~g:\\hose the truly scienti\ufb01c path in his persistent endeavour to observe\n\\and elucidate them.\u201d\nProfessor Richet\u2019s Address dealt with the successive experiences\nwhich had brought him over from his original materialistic standpoint\nto a gradually expanding belief in the operation of forces as yet\nunknown to science. The greater part of this Address will, it is hoped,'\nbe prepared by Professor Richet to 'appear (in translated form) in\nProceedings XXXV. Part of it which related to Eusapia Paladino\nwill, together with other matter concerning Eusapia, be deferred at\nany rate until after further experiments Which Professor Richet hopes\n'to conduct in the course of the summer.\u2019 For the same reason the\nremarks of Mr. F.' W. H. Myers and Professor Lodge, who brie\ufb02y\nfollowed Professor Richet, are not reproduced here. \u2018\nProfessor Richet spoke in French and without notes, but with such\nclearnessthat he was (so far as could be judged) followed with easy\nconiprehension by almost every member of the large audience.\nDeparting'-from the usual habit at such meetings, Sir W. Crookes\nconcluded by proposing a vote of thanks to the lecturer, which -was\naccorded by acclamation. ' ' \"\n\f\u2018--_\u2014~\nMAn, 1899.] The 'S.P.'R.'and 'Eusapia Paladino.

' '\nThe following letter appeared in Light of February 18th :\u2014\u2014 -\nAs some misunderstanding appears to exist with regard to the relation\nof the Society for Psychical Research as a body, or of some of its members\nindividually, to Eusapia Paladino, I shall be glad if you will allow me to\nstate brie\ufb02y certain facts.\nIn the \ufb01rst place, as has been again and again stated, the Society for\nPsychical Research absolutely disclaims any corporate opinion, beyond the\nopinion that the whole range of alleged supernormal phenomena deserves\ncareful inquiry in a scienti\ufb01c spirit. The Society has from the \ufb01rst included\n~its founders wished it to include\u2014persons of widely varying opinions';\nand the selection of papers or articles, for reading or printing, has through\nout been guided, not by the views which those papers expressed, but by the\ndegree of scienti\ufb01c care and candour with which, in the Council\u2019s opinion,\nthe experiments narTated had been made or the inferences drawn.\nIndividual responsibility has throughout been de\ufb01ned and guarded, and\nthe Society is not implicated, as a whole, in any view which any of its\nmembers may take of a particular medium.\nSecondly, even among the more active members there has been no change\nof view, save a certain change in my own views, to which I will come presently.\nProfessor Sidgwick and Dr. Hodgson are quite unaffected by my report of\nEusapia\u2019s latest phenomena. They continue to regard her as a mere\ntrickster, and to deprecate further experiment with 'a person who has\nsystematically practised trickery for years. Professor Richet and Professor\nLodge retain their view that she mingles genuine and spurious phenomena.\nAs for myself, my readers may possibly remember that I witnessed\nphenomena on the ile Roubaud which I held to be genuine, and afterwards\nphenomena in my own house which (thanks, mainly, to Dr. Hodgson\u2019s\nacumen) I ascertained beyond doubt to be false ; and which Eusapia\u2019s\n\u201c control\u201d has since a_dmitted to be false. I then felt, and I think reasonably,\nthat in view of all this fraud, although still unable to disbelieve wholly~ in\nthose earlier experiences, I could not ask other persons to take my recollection\nof the ile Roubaud s\u00e9ances as proving genuineness. Such an attitude, of course,\nwas pro tanto depreciatory of Professor Richet and Professor Lodge, who\ncontinued to believe in the ile Roubaud phenomena. And when Professor\nRichet invited me to attend further s\u00e9ances last December, I felt that' I\ncould not refuse ;\u2014in spite of the grave objection which I felt, and feel, to\ntaking any further notice of mediums proved dishonest.\nThe new phenomena were far more striking than even those of the ile\nRoubaud ; I was _convinced_that they were genuine; and obvious duty to my\ncolleagues, upon whose acumen my previous withdrawal had to some extent\nre\ufb02ected, urged me_ publicly to avow my revised conviction. There is no\ngreat change of view here, and this is all the change of view that has occurred\nivith regard to the phenomena or performances of Eusapia Paladino.\nI-Leckham'pton House, Cambridge.

MICHAEL PETRovo-SoLovovo oN THE EvnmNCR oF INDEPENDENT\nSLATE-WRITING.\nThe following letter has been received from Professor Shufeldt, of\nWashington, DC. :'\u2014\nIn Volume IX. of the Journal of the S.P.R. (No. CLV., January, 1899,.\npp. 11, 12), I \ufb01nd a communication that has considerable interest for me..\nIt is a letter contributed by our distinguished member, Michael Petrovo\nSolovovo, who reviews Mr. Podmore\u2019s Review of Mr. Lang\u2019s, \u201cThe Making\nof Religion.\u201d Mr. Petrovo-Solpvovo is evidently a staunch believer in the\nalleged phenomenon of independent slate-writing and allied tricks, and\nexpresses some surprise at the \u201cevidence\u201d of Professor Elliott (Jones of\nthis country being \u201cabsolutely ignored\u201d on this point in Mr. Podmore\u2019s\nreview. Perhaps I can furnish the reason for your correspondent why so\ncareful an observer and wide a reader as Mr. Podmore ignored a \u201cgentle\nman of such scienti\ufb01c eminence \u201d as Dr. Cones in his review. The fact that\na person\u2019s name is widely known is no criterion whatever of the soundness\nof his opinions or the depth of his learning. Dr. Coues believes that inde-\npendent slate-writing is \u201c a fact in nature,\u201d and Mr. Podmore has very good\nreasons for believing nothing of the kind, and, to use the word in its widest.\nsense, he is too good a naturalist to believe anything of the kind.- (See\nReligio-Philosophical Jonrnal, February 27th, 1892.) It is an easy matter to\nbecome notorious in any \ufb01eld of research, and Dr. Coues most assuredly\nmade himself so when he published in The Nation of New York (December\n25th, 1884, p. 543), statements to the effect that his methods of examining\n\u201cghosts\u201d wereby smelling them, seeing them, hearing them, handling\nthem, weighing them upon hay or platform scales, and by examining the\nparings of their toe-nails and \ufb01nger-nails when the aforesaid \u201cghosts\u201d left\nsuch detached portions of themselves behind them. Dr. Coues distinctly\nclaims in The Nation that he has personally eacamined by means of the micro-\nscope not only such structures as the toe-nails of ghosts, but also specimens\nof their hair, when the ghosts have condescended to have it trimmed during\ntheir visits to this mundane sphere. Now, if one of such \u201cscienti\ufb01c\neminence\" as Dr. Ooues makes such statements as these \u201cin print,\u201d I fail\nto see what more we need in the premises, or what further proof Mr.\nPetrovo-Solovovo needs. Further, Dr. Coues\u201cstates in the aforesaid article\nthat thousands of ghosts have been examined in this way, \u201cannually,\nmonthly, weekly, daily, and perhaps hourly, by thousands of persons of\nevery grade of intelligence, etc. \u201d ; but your correspondent should read the\narticle of Dr. Coues in The Nation and be convinced, and he then may be\nable to better appreciate, perhaps, the reason why Mr. Podmore so\nthoroughly ignored the \u201cevidence\u201d of such a contributor to our honest\nresearches, notwithstanding the fact that he had attained scienti\ufb01c eminence\nR. W. SHUFELDL\n\fMAB.,1899.] ' Correspondence. ' \u2019 37\nCLAIRvoYANCE AND PoLTERGEIsTs.\nSIR,\u2014I will make shift as well as I can to meet the principal objections\nbrought forward by Dr. Wallace against my views on Alexis Didier\u2019s\nclairvoyance and on Poltergeists. To deal with them at all adequately\nwould occupy more space than your courtesy or the tolerance of your\nreaders would allow; and I trust Dr. Wallace will understand that in\nwhat follows I am constrained by considerations of space to pass by some\npoints in his letter and to be briefer than I could have wished in dealing\nwith others.\nHoudin\u2019s testimony is no doubt very striking. But we must dis\ntinguish. Against the theory that Alexis\u2019 success was due to conjuring of\nthe ordinary type, it must be admitted to be conclusive. But on the view\nadvocated by me, that the clairvoyance of cards and sentences in closed\nbooks, etc., was probably due to preternormal acuteness of vision, con\nditioned by the trance, it is not so conclusive. No doubt Houdin, as a\ntrained observer, would, if his attention had been specially directed to this\npossibility, have been better able than the ordinary person to pronounce\njudgment on it. But this acuteness of vision here supposed is a distinct\nthing from the rapid and comprehensive glance, the result of long training,\nwhich, as we know from Houdin himself, is part of the conjuror\u2019s equip\nment, and might very well pass for incredible even with an expert observer.\nHoudin contents himself with saying that Alexis\u2019 performances were beyond\nthe resources of the art of conjuring.\nMy disbelief in this kind of clairvoyance is founded mainly on a com\nparison of the best reports I could \ufb01nd of the numerous cases in France\nand England during the period from 1820-50: e.g., the report of the Second\nFrench Commission on Animal Magnetism; the reports on M11e- Pigeaire;\nand especially the very careful and varied experiments of Chauncey Hare\nTownshend on his subject, also a French youth. It is clear, especially\nfrom Townshend\u2019s reports (Facts in Mesmerism), that the exercise of the\nfaculty had some relation to normal vision : the interposition of a screen,\nan extra bandage, an alteration in the position of the bandage, or in\nthe angle at which the object was held, constantly caused the experiment\nto fail.\nWhen the observers were less careful than Townshend these variations of\nthe experiments were not tried, or their results were not recorded.\nMost of the reporters on Alexis paid no attention to such small points ;\nand no doubt the conditions of the bandaging, etc., were prescribed by\nMarcillet. But I referred in my article to some reports from the outside\njournals of this time (1844), from which it was quite clear that Alexis was\nvery particular about the position of the bandages ; and even in Dr. Lee\u2019s\nbook I \ufb01nd one case in which Alexis refused to submit to the handkerchief\nbeing tied over the face (p. 272).\nI cannot \ufb01nd anything in Dr. Lee's reports that would lead me to alter\nmy opinion. They are very condensed ; and Dr.' Hodgson has abundantly\nshown that condensed reports in such matters are certain to omit seemingly\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psycl1\/ical Research. [MAB.,1F99\u00bb\nirrelevant details which give the key to the result. Three or four such\nomissions in Dr. Lee\u2019s reports I will brie\ufb02y note :\u2014 I\n1. He nowhere mentions whether the table used for card-playing was\ncovered with a cloth or whether the polished surface was bare. .\n. 2. He never mentionsthe whereabouts, and only once or twice incidentally\nmentions the presence, of Marcillet at the experiments. Yet Marcillet, the\nhypnotiser, was presumably present throughout.\n3. P. 258, S\u00e9ance III., after describing successful card-playing, he goes\non : \u201c Reading from a volume opened at random by the Rev. F. Robertson,\ntwenty pages in advance.\" Two pages later, at the end of the account, he\nmentions incidentally that the \ufb01rst trial of reading, also proposed by the\nRev. F. Robertson, had. been a failure.\n4. Again, on the same page (258) is another serious omission. Lee\nwrites: \u201cSir R\u2014\u2014 G\u2014\u2014 then gave a morocco case, which Alexis said\ncontained \u2014,\u201d and then proceeded to describe the contents.\nIn an account of the same sitting by Mr. Parsons, of Brighton (Zoist,\nVol. VII., pp. 92-3), the incident is thus described: \u201c Sir R. Grant pre\nsented a packet containing a portrait, which had been before presented by a\nsceptic, and Alexis could then make nothing of it. Marcillet then proposed\nthat the packet should be put into the hands of any other gentleman who\nwas not a sceptic, and that the contents should be exhibited to that other\nperson in another room. Sir R. Grant volunteered, and this was done, and\nthe packet secured as before. Alexis now succeeded in describing the\npicture with particularity.\u201d\nNo doubt to Dr. Lee it would have seemed insufferably tedious and\nirrelevant to have stated in his account of each sitting where Marcillet\nstood, at what kind of a table Alexis played cards, what failures occurred in\neach experiment before success was achieved, and so on. I do not in the least\nquestion his good faith in the matter. But the little details which he omits\nare just what I want to know; and their omission, whilst it makes it\ndi\ufb02icult to frame a satisfactory theory as to how Alexis could achieve the\nwonders reported of him, renders it impossible for us to place any con\ufb01dence\nin Dr. Lee\u2019s conclusion, that it was all due to a hypothetical faculty of\nclairvoyance. _\nI am sorry that I should have given Dr. Wallace the impression that I\nreject the evidence for clairvoyance at a distance, or, generally, for that\nform of clairvoyance which seems allied to and merges in thought reading.\nThe evidence of Haddock, Gregory, Townshend, Barth, and many others at\nthat period is very strong. The evidence for the exercise of the faculty,\neven in the case of Alexis, seems good, and might be better if we could\neliminate Marcillet, and could get more reports at \ufb01rst hand, and in detail.\nI will now pass to the second part of Dr. Wallace\u2019s letter, which deals\nwith Poltergeists. My argument is, brie\ufb02y, the better the evidence, the\nless the marvel ; until when we succeed in obtaining, as we very rarely do\nobtain, the contemporary evidence at \ufb01rst hand of intelligent witnesses, we\n\ufb01nd nothing which the \u201cnaughty little gir \u201d is not fully competent to\nexplain.\n\fMAn, 1899.] \u2019 C0'r\/)~\u00a2'5-p(m,'dence\"__ . ju 39\nThere would not be space to criticise in detail all the nine cases which\nDr. Wallace brings forward. I will discuss brie\ufb02y the \ufb01rst three ; taking\nthese partly. because they are the \ufb01rst three (that I may not appear to\nselect cases specially favourable to my argument), partly because they are\namongst the best known and most widely quoted narratives.\n1. The Drummer of Tedworth, as told by Glanvil. The disturbances\nbegan \u201cabout the middle of April,\" 1661 (Glanvil only gives two exact\ndates in the whole narrative), and continued for about two years. Glanvil\u2019s\naccount of it, as we learn from the preface to the fourth (posthumous)\nedition of Sadducismu-s Triumphatus, was \ufb01rst published in 1668. Glanvil\nhimself paid one visit to the house, \u201c about this time \u201d\u2014the last date given,\non the previous page, being January 10th, 1662. Glanvil\u2019s account of all\nhe saw and heard is, in brief, as follows : On hearing from a maid-slervant\nthat \u201cit was come,\u201d he, with Mr. Mompesson and another, went up to a\nbedroom ; \u201c there were two modest little Girls in the Bed, between 7 and 8\nYears old, as.I guest.\u201d Glanvil heard a scratching in the bed \u201cas loud\nas one with long Nails could make upon a Bolster,\u201d This lasted for half-an\nhour and more, and Glanvil could not discover the cause ; it was succeeded\nby a panting, like a dog, accompanied by movements in the bedding : also\nthe windows shook ; also Glanvil saw a movement in a \u201c Linnen Bag \u201d that\nhung against another bed, but was not apparently suf\ufb01ciently sure of the\naccuracy of his observation to mention this incident in the \ufb01rst (1668)\nedition. Further, Glanvil was aroused by an untimely knocking next morning ;\nand his horse fell ill on the way home, and died 2 or 3 days later. This is\nthe only detailed account which we have at \ufb01rst hand ; it is written 5 or\n6 years after the events. and apparently not from full notes, as Glanvil is\nunable to give the exact dates.\nThe rest of the account is founded on the oral relation of Mr.\nMompesson, con\ufb01rmed by other witnesses, \u201cand partly from his own\nletters.\u201d There are also two letters of Mompesson\u2019s, dated respectively\n1672 and 1674. But he gives no detailed con\ufb01rmation of Glanvil\u2019s account ;\nindeed, when the second letter was written he expressly says that he had\nlent Glanvil\u2019s book \u201cfor the use of the Lord Hollis,\" the previous year,\nand did not know what the account contained. But even if we assume that\nGlanvil had accurately put down 5 or 6 years later all that he had heard\nfrom Mompesson, it does not amount to much ; for it does not appear that\nMo1npesson himself witnessed any of the more marvellous incidents\u2014the\ndrops of blood, the chairs moving by themselves, \u201c the great Body with two\nred and glaring Eyes,\u201d and all the rest of it. These things were witnessed\nby neighbours, by men-servants, or by an undistributed \u201cthey.\u201d So_ that\nGlanvil\u2019s account of them may be third-hand, or tenth-hand.\n3. The disturbances at the Castle of Slawensik, an account of which is\npreserved by Kerner in the Seeress of Prevorst. (I postpone for the moment\nDr. Wallace\u2019s case No. 2, the Wesley Ghost.) The disturbances took\nplace during two months in the winter of 1806-7, apparently from end of\nNovember 'to end of January. They are said to have been witnessed by\nmany persons, whose names are given; but we have only one account,\n\f40 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1899\nwritten by Councillor Hahn on November 19th, 1808, and by him given to\nKerner in 1828. From the fact that no dates are given it may be inferred\nthat Hahn did not keep notes ; at any rate, not accurate notes. I know no\nreason for doubting Hahn\u2019s honesty ; but his studies of Kant and Fichte are\nno guarantee of his competence as a witness. In any case I submit that his\nunsupported testimony, given 18 months or more after the events, does\nnot constitute \u201cexceptionally good\u201d evidence, even for things which he\nsaw, or believed himself to see, with his own eyes. But many of the\nInarvels are only given at second-hand. It was the dauntless Kern who saw\nin the glass the white \ufb01gure of a woman looking at him ; Hahn stood before\nthe glass for a quarter of an hour and saw only his own re\ufb02ection. Again,\nit was Kern and Hahn\u2019s servant, during Hahn\u2019s absence at Breslau, who\nsaw a jug of beer rise from the table, as if lifted by an invisible hand, and\npour out a glass half full, and the glass then raise itself in the air and tilt its\ncontents (which disappeared without leaving a trace) down an invisible\nthroat. Kern had evidently spent his time to more purpose than in\nstudying Kant and Fichte.\n2. But I \ufb01nd myself in entire agreement with Dr. Wallace in his\nestimate of the evidence in the Wesley case. It is perhaps the most\nfully authenticated case which we possess in the literature of the subject.\nThe main disturbances lasted with intervals for the two months, December\nand January, 1716-17, with occasional outbreaks after that date. The\nrecords consist (1) of letters written to Samuel Wesley (John\u2019s elder\nbrother) by his mother and his two sisters, Susannah and Emilia. These\nletters are dated January, February, and March, 1816-1817, that is,\nwithin a few weeks of the disturbances. (2) A copy of an account\nwritten by Samuel Wesley (John\u2019s father). The copy was made by Samuel\nWesley, the son, in 1830, from a copy made by John Wesley in 1826.\n(3) Letters written by Mrs. Wesley and four of her daughters to John\nWesley in the summer and autumn of 1726, more than nine years after the\noccurrences. The evidence comprised under (1), (2), and (3) was \ufb01rst\npublished in 1791 by Priestley. A copy of the letters and diary in the\nhandwriting of Samuel Wesley (John\u2019s brother), had been given to Priestley,\nas he explains, by the Rev. S. Badcock, who had himself received the MSS.\nfrom a granddaughter of Samuel Wesley.* (4) An account compiled in 1826\nby John Wesley from the letters and from conversation with some of the\nother spectators, and published in the Armim'an Magazine.\nIt will be instructive if we deal with each of the sets of documents\nseparately.\n1. We will take \ufb01rst the contemporary letters, and in the \ufb01rst instance\nwe will consider only the statements made by the actual eye- or rather ear\nwitnesses of the things described: (a) Mrs. Wesley writes on January 12th,\n1716-1717, that, beginning from an early date in December, she heard un\naccountable knockings, mostly in the garret or the nursery :\u2014\u201c One night\nit made such a noise in the room over our heads, as if several people were\n\" Original Letters by the Rev. John Wesley and his Friends, etc., 1791.\n\fMm, 1899.] Cowewondence. 4'1\nwalking; then run up and down stairs, and was so outrageous, that we\nthought the children would be frightened,'so your father and I rose and\nwent down in the dark to light a candle. Just as we came to the bottom\nof the broad stairs, having hold of each other, on my side there seemed\nas if somebody had emptied a bag of money at my feet, and on his as\nif all the bottles under the stairs (which were many) had been dashed in\na thousand pieces. We passed through the hall into the kitchen, and got\na candle and went to see the children. The next night your father would\nget Mr. Hoole to lie at our house, and we all sat together till one\nor two o\u2019clock in the morning, and heard the knocking as usual. Some\ntimes it would make a noise like the winding up of a jack ; at other times,\nas that night Mr. Hoole was with us, like a carpenter plaining deals;\nbut most commonly it knocked thrice and stopped, and then thrice again,\never so many hours together.\u201d That is practically all that Mrs. Wesley\nrelates of her own personal experience.\n(b) There are two letters from Miss Susannah Wesley, dated January\n24th and March 27th. In the \ufb01rst she records her own experience as\nfollows :\n\u201cThe \ufb01rst night I ever heard it, my sister Nancy and I were set in\nthe dining-room. We heard something rustle on the outside of the doors\nthat opened into the garden, then three loud knocks, immediately after\nother three, and in half-a-minute the same number over our heads. We\nenquired whether anybody had been in the garden, or in the room above\nus, but there was nobody. Soon after my sister Molly and I were up after all\nthe family were abed, except my sister Nancy, about some business. We\nheard three bouncing thumps under our feet, which soon made us throw\naway our work and tumble into bed. Afterwards the tingling of the latch\nand warming-pan, and so it took its leave that night.\n\u201c Soon after the above mentioned we heard a noise as if a great piece of\nsounding metal was thrown down on the outside of our chamber. We,\nlying in the quietest part of the house, heard less than the rest for a pretty\nwhile, but the latter end of the night that Mr. Hoole sat up on, I lay in\nthe nursery, when it was very violent. I then heard frequent knocks over\nand under the room where I lay, and at the children\u2019s bed head, which was\nmade of boards. It seemed to rap against it very hard and loud, so that\nthe bed shook under them. I heard something walk by my bedside, like a\nman in a long nightgown. The knocks were so loud that Mr. Hoole came\nout of their chamber to us. It still continued. My father spoke,\nbut nothing answered. It ended that night with my father\u2019s particular\nknock, very \ufb01erce. It is now pretty quiet, only at our repeating the\nprayers for our King and prince, when it usually begins, especially when my\nFather says : \u2018 Our most gracious Sovereign Lord,\u2019 etc. This my Father is\nangry at, and designs to say three instead of two for the royal family. We\nall heard the same noise, and at the same time, and as coming from the\nsame place.\u201d .\n(c) There is one letter from Miss Emily, undated, but obviously written\nat about this time. She describes various noises, more particularly groans,\n\f4:2 Journal of Society for Paychtcal Research. [MAR-.1399~\nthe sound as of \u201c a vast coal\u201d being thrown down in the kitchen ; the sound\nas of a stone being thrown in among the bottles under the \u201c best\" stairs;\n\u201c something like a quick winding up of a jack at the corner of the room by\nmy bed\u2019s head.\u201d Knocks on the \ufb02oor and elsewhere, mostly three times\nrunning.'\nThese are all the experiences which the ladies relate at \ufb01rst hand. But\nEmily Wesley tells us that her sister Hetty heard coming down the garret\nstairs behind her \" something like a man, in a loose nightgown trailing after\nhim : \u201d that the knocks would answer Mrs. Wesley, if she stamped on the\n\ufb02oor, and bid them do likewise; that Mrs. Wesley had seen something\nunder a bed \u201c like a badger, only without any head that was discernible\u201d ;\nand that Robin Brown, the man-servant, had seen the same creature twice,\nthe last time in the appearance of a white rabbit.\nMiss Susannah adds, under date March 27th: \u201cLast Sunday, to my\nfather's no small amazement, his trencher danced upon the table a pretty\nwhile, without anybody\u2019s stirring the table.\u201d\n2. The account by old Mr. Wesley was obviously in great part written very\nshortly after the disturbances. It is not, however, dated ; and it is clearly\nnot a day by day record, as in a diary, for he is occasionally uncertain of\nthe exact dates, and the account is mostly written as a continuous narrative.\nMr. Wesley was the last to hear the noises, though he had been told what\nother members of the family had heard. On December 21st, \u201c I think,\u201d he\nwas awakened by nine loud knocks, apparently in the room next to his bed\nroom. Two or three nights later Mr. and Mrs. Wesley were both aroused\nby the loud and continuous noises, and searched the house, with the\nresult already described in her narrative.\nThereafter he frequently heard the knocks ; they answered him when he\nrapped with his stick knock for knock ; they came on the children\u2019s bed\nstead, in his own study, and in almost every room in the house ; they would\nmake a_ great noise at family prayers at the names of King George and the\nPrince. He often spoke. but never received any articulate answer, \u201c only once\nor twice two or three very feeble squeaks, a little louder than the chirping\nof a bird, but not like the noise of rats, which I have often heard.\u201d Often\nthe latch of his bedroom would be lifted, when he was in bed. Finally, he\nrecords: \u201cI have been thrice pushed by an invisible power, once against\nthe corner of my desk in the study, a second time against the door of the\nmatted chamber, a third time against the right side of the frame of my\nstudy door, as I was going in.\u201d\nOf the experiences of others he tells us a good deal : that Mrs. Wesley\nhad seen a thing \u201c most like a badger\" : that \u201c one night when the noise was\ngreat in the kitchen, and on a deal partition, and the door in the yard, the\nlatch whereof was often lift up, my daughter Emilia went and held it fast on\nthe inside, but it was then lifted up, and the door pushed violently against\nher, though nothing was to be seen on the outside\u201d: and that Robin Brown\nsaw \u201c something come out of the copper-hole like a rabbit, but less.\u201d\n3. To turn now to the letters written in 1726. Mrs. Wesley adds to\nthe account which she had given nine years before, that on one occasion the\n\f4-\u2018-\u2014~~\nH.\n-MAm,-1899.] Coovesmondem\u00e9. \"1 - . 43\nsounds answered her when she knocked ; that at another time, \u201c Upon my\nlooking under the bed, something ran out pretty much like a badger\u201d ; and\ngives the following variant of the noises heard on the nocturnal journey\nround the house, undertaken by herself and Mr. Wesley :\u2014\u2014\u201cNear the foot\n(of the stairs) a large pot. of money seemed to be poured out at my waist,\nand to run jingling down my nightgown to my feet. Presently after, we\nheard the noise as of a vast stone thrown among several dozen of bottles\nwhich lay under the stairs, but upon our looking no hurt was done. In the\nhall the mastiff met us, crying and striving to get between us.\u201d\nThus, in the later version the one sound, diversely interpreted, has\nbecome two successive sounds, and various decorative details\u2014the jingling\ndown the nightgown, the search among the bottles, the fright of the masti\ufb02\n\u2014have been added.\nSo Sister Emily, in the lateraccount, adopts and enlarges upon the\ndescription already given in her father's account (but wanting in her own\nearlier letter) of seeing the latch of the kitchen door move, and \ufb01nding the\ndoor itself resist_her efforts to shut it. So in Sister Susannah\u2019s later\naccount, what had been described in her earlier letter as \u201c the tingling of\nthe latch and warming-pan,\u201d is now ampli\ufb01ed into \u201cthe latch of the door\nthen jarred, and seemed to be swiftly moved to and fro.\u201d\nSister Molly and sister Nancy (who were not represented in the earlier\ncorrespondence) also gave accounts of their experiences to their brother\nJack in 1726. From the latter\u2019s account, which is written in the third\nperson, apparently as representing John Wesley\u2018s notes of a conversation\nwith her, the following extract may be quoted :\u2014\u201cOne night she (Nancy)\nwas sitting on the press bed, playing at cards with four of my sisters, when\nmy sisters Molly, Etty (Hetty ?), Patty and Kezzy were in the room, and\nRobin Brown. The bed on which my sister Nancy sat was lifted up with\nher on it. She leaped down and said, \u2018Surely old Jeffery would not run\naway with her.\u2019 However, they persuaded her to sit down again, which she\nhad scarce done, when it was again lifted up several times successively, a\nconsiderable height.\u201d This incident is not mentioned by Molly, or indeed\nby any of the others.\nLastly, we have an account given by Robin Brown, the servant, in\n1726, to John Wesley, con\ufb01rming the story of the white rabbit, already\nquoted, and adding this new incident :\u2014\u201c Soon after, being grinding corn in\nthe garrets, and happening to stop a little, the handle of the mill was turned\nround with great swiftness. He said nothing vexed him, but that the mill\nwas empty. If corn had been in it, old Jelfery might have ground his heart\nout for him.\u201d\nJohn Wesley\u2019s own account, based apparently exclusively\u2014since ho was\nnot himself a witness of any of the phenomena\u2014 on the correspondence and\non conversations with his family-and others in 1726, it is not necessary to\nconsider at length. It introduces, however, one or two sensational details,\nsuch as his father\u2019s threatening with a pistol, which \ufb01nd no place in the\nearlier narratives.\nNow a record of this kind suggests two questions : \ufb01rst, what precisely\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psycluical Research. [MAR-. 1899\nare the things to be explained? second, what may the explanation be?\nMost, indeed, of the writers, who, from the days of Glanvil,' have formed\nfrom a mass of similar narratives collections of supernatural seemings, have\npassed at once to the second question, and have found the search for a solu\ntion so fascinating, that they have never returned to look for an answer to\nthat indispensable preliminary enquiry. Without stopping to consider whether\ntheir method is more honoured or discredited by long usage, I propose to\nreverse it. What, then, are the things to be explained in the Wesley case ?\nTo begin with, we are not called upon to explain what it was that made the\nhandle of the mill turn round, to the amazement and chagrin of Robin\nBrown. Our problem is a simpler, if also a less alluring one-\u2014to \ufb01nd out, to\nwit, what made Robin Brown believe, nine years after, that he had seen the\nhandle of the mill move. Again, we have got to ask, not what was the\nbadger-like form which Mrs. Wesley saw ; but how it came about that Mrs.\nWesley\u2019s husband and dahghter, in 1717, and Mrs. Wesley herself in 1726,\ntesti\ufb01ed that she had seen such a form. Nor need the vagaries of Mr.\nWesley\u2019s trencher, nor Robin Brown\u2019s spectre \u201csomewhat like a white\nrabbit,\u201d nor the door which resisted the stoutest efforts of Emilia, perplex\nus. Our problem, in fact, as now simpli\ufb01ed, is to search for a rational\nexplanation of various noises, suggesting, indeed, an intelligent, but not\nobviously a supernormal origin, which disturbed the Wesley household for\na couple of months in 1716-7.\nOld Samuel Wesley had at the time seven daughters living, of whom two,\nPatty and Keziah, were children, and \ufb01ve were, apparently, su\ufb02iciently\ngrown up to write letters. Of these \ufb01ve, two are represented in the earlier\ncorrespondence, four in the later. One only, Hetty (Mehetabel) has\ncontributed no account at all. There is no obvious reason for this silence,\nfor Hetty, as we learn from John VVesley\u2019s account, was nineteen at the\ntime. She had, apparently, undertaken to write, but failed to carry out her\npromise:* and by the testimony of all those concerned, she seems to have\nenjoyed more of Jeffery\u2019s attention than any other member of the household.\nConsider, for instance, these extracts from the correspondence :\u2014\nMrs. Wesley writes, January 26th and 27th, 1716-7 :\u2014\u201c All the family. as\nwell as Robin, were asleep when your father and I went downstairs (on the\nnocturnal exploration already described) nor did they wake in the nursery\nwhen we held the candle close by them, only we observed that Hetty\ntrembled exceedingly in her sleep, as she always did before the noise\n-awaked her. It commonly was nearer her than the rest.\u201d Or consider,\nagain, this extract from Miss Emily\u2019s letter (1717) :-\u2014\u201cNo sooner was I\ngot upstairs, and undressing for bed, but I heard a noise among many\nbottles that stand under the best stairs, just like the throwing of a great\nstone among them, which had broken them all to pieces. This made me\nhasten to bed; but my sister Hetty, who sits always to wait on my father\ngoing to bed, was still sitting on the lowest step of the garret stairs.\u201d\nAnd again: \u201cIt never followed me as it did my sister Hetty. I have\n* See Miss Susannal\ufb01s letter of March 27th, 1717.\n\fMAR., 1899.] Correspondence. 45\n\u2018______~\nbeen with her when it has knocked under her, and when she has removed\nhas followed, and still kept just under her feet.\u201d\nAgain, in Mrs. Wesley's later account, after describing loud noises which\nthey heard in their bedroom, she writes : \u201c Mr. Wesley leapt up, called;\nHetty, who alone was up,' and searched every room in the house.\u201d\nIn sister Susannah\u2019s later account :\u2014\u201c Presently began knocking about a\nyard within the room on the \ufb02oor. ' It then came gradually to sister Hetty\u2019s.\nbed, who trembled strongly in her sleep. It beat very loud, three strokes\nat a time, on the bed's head.\"\nAnd, once more, in John Wesley\u2019s version of Mr. Hoole\u2019s experience :\n\u201c When we (i.e., Mr. Wesley and Mr. Hoole) came into the nursery it was\nknocking in the next room; when we -were there it was knocking in the _.\nnursery, and there it continued to knock, though we came in, particularly i\nI\nI\nI\nl\n.<.,r=<\u2014_\u00bb_.-,.-\u2014.-+5\u201c._ll\nat the head of the bed (which was of wood), in which Miss Hetty and'\ntwo of her younger sisters lay.\u201d\nAfter the perusal of these extracts, Miss Hetty\u2019s inexplicable reticence\nseems more than ever to be deplored. And in view of this reticence, and\nof Miss Hetty\u2019s singular habit of trembling in a sound sleep when loud\nnoises were going on all round her, and of the notable predilection shown\nby the Poltergeists for her person, it hardly seems worth while to enquire\nwhether the noises which perplexed the Wesley family did indeed proceed\nfrom a supernormal source.\nIn brief, my contention is that the only reason for the inexplicable\nelement to which Dr. Wallace refers in these narratives, is the defect of the\nevidence. When we have only secondhand accounts, or narratives written\ndown months or years after the event\u2014as in Glanvil\u2019s and Hahn\u2019s accounts\n\u2014we \ufb01nd an abundance of marvellous incidents; when, as in the Wesley\ncase, we have almost contemporary accounts at \ufb01rst-hand from sober-minded\nwitnesses, the element of the marvellous is reduced to a minimum. But the _\npeculiarly instructive feature of the Wesley letters is that we can see how i\nthe witnesses, whilst they narrate of their own personal experience only\ncomparatively tame and uninteresting episodes, allow their imaginations to\nembellish somewhat the experiences of other members of the household;\nand that these same embellishments, nine years later, are incorporated in\nthe \ufb01rst-hand accounts, as genuine items of personal experience.\nI have left little space to answer Mr. Lang\u2019s letter. But, indeed, there\nare not many points, I trust, in which we differ. I gladly accept the\ncorrection of my surmise (1) as to a case given by Miss Angus ; and (2) I do\nnot value the evidence of Miss Angus less, because I value that of Mrs.\nPiper more. Nor do I think that the strength of the Piper evidence for\nclairvoyance or some other supernormal faculty at all depends on the proof\nof the identity of her \u201c spirits.\u201d (3) As to the Home evidence, I am not\nsatis\ufb01ed with any theory that I have yet seen; but I still think it more\nlikely that the explanation of the phenomena attested will ultimately prove\nto be a psychological one; a novel form of hallucination, rather than a\nmanifestation of a new physical force.\nFRANK PonnoRrz.\n\fTHE\nSOCIETY\nFOR\nPSYGHICAL\nRESEARCH.\n91\u00a2\nINCOME\nAND\nEXPENDITURE\nACCOUNT\nFOR\nTHE\nYEAR\nENDING\n31st\nDECEMBER,_18\u00a78.\n-\ne31\u2019.\n-\n2\ns.\nd.\n\u00a3\ns.\nd.\n\ufb01r.\n\u00a3\n5\u2018.\nd.\n\u00a3\ns.\nd.\ng1898.\n-Tan.1.\u2014-To\nCash\nBalance\nbrought\nforward\n-\n1898.\nDec.\n31.\u2014By\nLiterary\n\\Vork\n14\n9-\n0\ng\nfrom\nlast\naccount\n122\n10\n2\n,,\nEditorial\nWork\n100\nQ\n'0\n,,\n,,\nin\nhands\nof\nSecretary\n10\n0\n0,,\nLibrary\nCommittee\n8\n15\n0\nE,''\n132\n10\n2,,\nHypnotic\n,,\n1\n1\n0Q\nDec.\n31.\u2014\n,,\nSubscriptions:\u2014\n\u00a3\ns.\nd.\n,,\nPrinting\n:\u2014'\n\\\n,,\nMembers\n(1897)\n4\n4\n0\nProceedings,\nPart\nXXXIII.\n273\n2\n8\nn\n'n\n258\n6\n0-\n' n\nn\nV\u2018\n(Reprint)\nm\n0\n-0\ng\n,,\n.,\n(1899)\n12\n12\n0\nJournal,\nNos.\n145\n\u2014153-...\n87\n6\n0\n3\n\u2014\u2014\n275\n2\n0\nTitle\nPage,Index\n(1\u2019roc.Vol.\nXIII.)\n5\n18\n6\nof\n,,\nAssociates\n(1897)\n-24\n3\n0\nGeneral\n14\n1\n9.\n=5:\n,,\n,,\n(1898)\n423\n13\n0\n\u2014\n400\n8\n11\n\\\n,,\n,,\n(1899)\n39\n8\n0_\n' ,,\nCovers\nand\nBinding\n22\n1\n9\nQ\n-\n487\n4\n0\n'' ,,\nEarly\nNos.\nof\nJournal\n'0\n6\n0\n8\n_\n762\n6\n0_\n,,\nGeneral\nMeetings\n43\n'14\n0\npw\n,,\nLife\nSubscriptions\n'21\n0\n0,,\nAdvertising\n..\n2\n2\n0\n,,\nDonations\n21\n0\n0,,\nSalary\nto\nSecretary\n(12\nmos.\nto\nSept.,\n1898). -,,\nPublications\n:\u2014\n;\n\u2019and\nCommission\non\nSubscriptions,\n&o.\n(1897)\nI50\n12\n0\n;\n_\nPer\nKegan\nPaul.\nTrench,\n,,\nRent\n(12\nmonths\nto\nMichaelmas,\n1898)\n45\n0\n0 Triibner\nSt\nCo.\n(July\n1897,\n,,\nHousekee\nr(12\nmonths,\n19,\nBuckingham-st.)\n15\n0\n0\nQ -\nto\nJune,\n1898)\n62\n10'\n9-\n,,\nReading\n00m\nand\nStationery\n4'15\n0\nN ,,-\n,,\nSecretary\n(1898)\n35\n11\n0,,\nSecond\nSight\nInquiry\n40\n0\n0\nm ,,\n,,\nSec.\nof\nAmerican\nBranch,,\nStorage\nof\nProceedings\n5'12\n6\ng\n'Supplies\nto\nMembe1s\nof\n-.\n'_\n,,\nPostage\n(Secretary\u2019s)\n104\n17\n1\n(\\\nAmerican\nBranch\n(July\n1,\n,,\n,.\n(Publications\nto\nAmerica,Branch\na\/c)\n26\n3\n3\nQ\n1897,\ntoJuno\n30,\n1898)\n150\n5\n0,,\nGas...\n-\n2\n1910\n2\nn\n,.\nS8198\nin\nAmerica\n(July\n1,\n.,,\nTravellin\nExpenses\n(Members\nof\nCouncil)\n4\nI3\n0\nF\u2018\n\"1897,\nto'June\n30,\n1898)\n44\n17\n10,,\nGeneral\nx\nnses\n43\n14\n4\n-~\u2014\u2014\n293\n4\n7\n,,\nBalance\nin\nands\nof\nTreasurer\n\u00a3268\n3\n11\nF\u2018 Q\u00bb\nInterest\non\nInvestment\n'\n84\n7\n10,,\n,,\n' ,,\nSecretary\n10\n0\n0_\nE\n2\n-\u2014\n27\n8\n3g\n11\n_:=\n_'\u2014'_'_\u2014\n5\n;~\n'\n\u00a31,314\n8\n7\n'\n\u00a31,314\n8\n7\nl 8\n\u2014\u2018\u2014'\u2014\u2014'\n~\n~\n.\n\fA_______~\nMAR, 1899.] ' ' '1-\u2018*\u2019'~ Case.

C1. 1110 in the January Jam~nal._\nSanta Barbara, Cal., January 28th, 1899.\nIn the spring of 1892, while living in Posadena, Cal., I was doing \u2018some\nwork in my garden\u2014planting corn-\u2014when I noticed that my class ring was\nbeing unnecessarily worn by friction upon the handle of the tool I was\nusing, and I removed it and placed it in my right trousers pocket. An hour\nor two later, having _\ufb01nished the work, I put my hand in my pocket to\nreplace the ring upon my \ufb01nger, and discovered that it was gone. There\nwas no hole in the pocket by which 'it could have been lost. I had, 'after\nplacing the ring in'my pocket, passed about the lot which had just been\nploughed, inspecting some orange trees for scale. After a;fruitless search\n\f48 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1899.\nwhere I had been working, I followed my trail as I had wandered about the\nploughed ground, looking for it with no better success. I remembered dis~\ntinctly, I thought, that I had been nowhere else. I was at that time an\ninvalid, and exceedingly nervous, and the loss of the ring disturbed me. I\nwas greatly worried, and returned to the spot where I had been working,\nand raked and sifted the ground over till the light began to fail at sunset,\nand, exercised far beyond my strength, I then went into the house and\nthrew myself down upon a loungecompletely exhausted. My wife (since\ndeceased) spoke to me, saying that she felt that -I would \ufb01nd it again. I had\nlain there perhaps ten minutes when I got up, with no de\ufb01ned intention of\ndoing anything, went outside, where it was almost dark, went directly\nunderneath an orange tree that I had no recollection whatever of having\nvisited, and which was not in the part of the lot that had been ploughed,\nbut which stood in a lawn of very thick Bermuda grass, fully six inches\nhigh. I knelt underneath the tree and, parting the thick matted grass, at\nonce and without searching, placed my hand on the ring.\nOnce, two years before, my wife lost, as she supposed, her bracelets.\nShe and I looked for them at odd times for months afterward. She was\npositive that she had not lost them out of doors, and remembered that an\nacquaintance had called shortly before she missed them. Failing to \ufb01nd\nthem after so much patient and thorough_ searching, she gave them up as\nlost and [as stolen. One day as I lay resting on the bed in our room, I\nthought of the lost bracelets, and, getting up, I went to a small bracket on\nthe wall, covered with a lambrequin, and, reaching up in the corner under\nneath and out of sight, I took the bracelets from a nail, and where she now\nremembered she had hung them when we went driving together, leaving the\nhouse alone, fearing burglarious tramps.\nIn this case it is possible, of course, that I saw her put them there, and\nhad forgotten the fact, and the \ufb01nding of them had no supernormal sig\nni\ufb01cance, bu't, taken in connection with the \ufb01nding of the ring and the fact\nthat I have had several minor instances of the sort, I report it.\nG.

The chair was taken by Dr. Geo. F. Rogers, and there\nwas a large attendance, every seat being occupied. Miss Mary H.\nKingsley read her Paper, as announced, on \u201cThe Forms of Appari\ntions in West Africa.\u201d It is unnecessary to give a summary of the\nPaper here, as it is intended to embody it in an article in the forth\ncoming part of the Proceedings. An interesting discussion followed,\nincluding some illustrations of the apparently supernormal transmission\nof information by African natives, across great distances of country.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers remarked that Miss Kingsley had benevolently\nmade it perfectly clear that the apparitions of which she spoke were\nnot intended to be regarded as evidential. The \u201cone large eye\u201d\nstaring in at your window-hole all night was rather too good to be\ntrue. It had, however, been sometimes suggested that the S.P.R.\nought to show more curiosity on subjects lying just over its proper\nborder, as in the domain of folk-lore. Such curiosity had that night\nhad a rich repast in the stories told by Miss Kingsley with a\npicturesqueness and intimacy of experience which few travellers could\nrival.\nCORRE SPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions expressed by C0rresp0nde'nts.]\nHUMAN MAGNETIsM.\nIn a recent address Mr. Podmore stated that no effect was produced on\nthe human organism by the most powerful magnetisers. The radiant\ne\ufb02luences seen by sensitives had absolutely no foundation in physics. The\nminds of the sensitives simply re\ufb02ected faithfully the ideas of their\nmagnetisers. In other words he infers that the mental suggestion of the\noperator is the real and sole cause of the phenomena in question, perceived\nby the sensitives. '\nThis is, of course, the view maintained by most leaders in the classic\nschools of hypnotism; consequently it has the advantage of carrying the\nauthority of orthodoxy. Yet we know that such standards are not \ufb01nal and are\nsubject to modi\ufb01cations. For instance we see some of the recognised leaders\nusnm\numwnsm OF I\u2018-Um\"S\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [A1>iuL, 1899.\nof these schools a\ufb02irming the exaggeration of this doctrine ; that there is no\nhypnotism, there is only suggestion ;* while another equally eminent\nauthority describes this position as \u201c artless \u201d (simplisme)i' and another again\nreplies that the production of the passive state is a necessary condition in\nthe mechanism of suggestion.I It is preferably to unbiassed experimentation\nthat we must turn for enlightenment, rather than to authority, while\ncarefully excluding the subconscious trend of preconceptions from our\njudgment.\nIn this direction I beg to submit, in reply to Mr. Podmore\u2019s \ufb01rst statement,\nthat Dr. Luys showed me instantaneous photographs, illustrating the compara\ntive effects produced by the respective poles of a magnet on three hypnotised\nsubjects. The magnet was a large straight bar, purposely prepared in such a\nmanner as to render the poles indistinguishable from each other in appear\nance in order to obviate suggestion. The one pole induced an expression of\ncontentment and satisfaction 'on the countenances ; the other induced\nexpressions of horror and dismay.\u00a7\nHe also showed me magnets used in the treatment of neuropathic\naffections, made in a form to \ufb01t on to the heads of the patients. The use\nof these magnets had. however, been abandoned, because it was found that\nthey absorbed some emanation from the patients treated and transferred the\naffection to the patient on whose head the magnet was subsequently placed.\nThis was, of course, in opposition with the desire of the Doctor who had\ndiscovered this mode of treatment, and consequently could not have been the\neffect of suggestion.\nA description is given in the Revue de l\u2019 Hypnotisme of September last\n(p. 69) showing that magnets are now used in the Hotel Dieu of Paris, to\nstimulate sensibility. These were probably introduced by Dr. Dumont\npallier, who discovered the transference of sensibility in the course of his\ninvestigations into metallo-therapeutics, made in conjunction with Charcot\nand Luys. ]|\nWith regard to the second statement advanced ; that the perception by\nhypnotised subjects of radiant e\ufb02luence is due to suggestion. Dr. Luys had\nthe good fortune to \ufb01nd among his subjects one who could draw and paint\nwhile in the secondary state. He ordered this subject to paint the people\npresented to him, as he saw them. It was found that the colours thus\npresented were not always the same, they varied in their distribution with\ndifferent people ; the dominant colours remaining similar, but other colours\nbeing introduced in minor quantities. This variation was found to be\naccentuated in neuropathic patients. Dr. Luys consequently introduced\nhysterical and paralytic patients, inebriates, and lunatics, for observation\nwithout informing his subject. He ultimately found a correlation appeared\n* Professor Bernheim, Revue de Psychologie, January, 1898.

This question receives\nprominent consideration, the operators being experts in suggestion.\nThe experiments were made with an electro-magnet, with the commutator\nso arranged that the current could be switched on and olf, or in converse\ndirections by the assistant, without the operator or subject seeing the action.\nThe assistant, in turning the switch, took care not to see himself how he\nplaced it, while neither M. de Rochas nor the subject could see it. The\nsubject was then told to describe what he saw, and his statement was noted\ndown. A small compass was then approached to the coil, to verify whether\na current was passing or not, and note was taken of the direction. These\ndata were afterwards compared with the description made by the sensitive.\nIn these carefully controlled conditions, when the colours were described\nas reversed, the current was found to have been switched in the reverse\ndirection. Their cessation was found to coincide with its interruption. But\nits sudden, rapid reversal was found to entail a mixed i.e., violet colour at\nboth poles of the magnet for a few seconds, when distinct red and blue\nappeared at the respective poles.\nInterruption was also effected by detaching one of the wires unknown to\nthe subject, who at once declared that he ceased to see anything. For the\nsame purpose, the zincs were lifted out of the cells, but the subject declaring\nthat he still saw the colours, it was found on investigation with a compass\nthat a current was actually passing. This was due to a few drops of acid\nadhering to the base of the elements and entailing contact. More enduring\neffects were found to follow the substitution of a steel core to the magnet,\ninstead of a soft iron one. The change was at once noti\ufb01ed by the subject.\nA description of a similar experiment made by Dr. Sajous and con\ufb01rming\nthe effects noticed by Dr. Luys is appended.\nOn p. 32 of above work, an instance is given of an experiment purposely\nmade to mislead the subject by suggestion, which, while it succeeded in part,\ndid not inhibit the perception of the real e\ufb02luence.\nNo student who has studied hypnotic suggestion will deny that a subject\ncan be made by suggestion to see a radiance issuing from the ends of a\nmodern dummy magnet. That is indeed a simple presentation as compared\nwith the complex phenomena which may be so evoked in the subject's mind.\nBut neither can dispassionate observers refuse to recognise the phenomena\nabove described. And such experiments could easily be repeated by\nunbiassed operators. Yet such is the force of mental suggestion that an\n* See Light, p. 247, 1897.\n\f54~ Jowmal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL,1899.\noperator, determined to nullify such experiments, could do so; just as a\nstrongly positive and hostile investigator can spoil the manifestations\nthrough an entranced medium.\nThe physical foundation of this radiation is dealt with in the same work.\nThe discoveries of Dr. Edward Branby* with regard to the analogies sub\nsisting between the functioning of an intermittant electric radio conductor in\nwireless telegraphy and man\u2019s neuric circulation, have an important bearing\non this question, as constituting the \ufb01rst steps in a new direction of research,\nthe development of which may establish further analogies between man\u2019s\npsychic radiation and the \u201c \ufb01eld\u201d of an electro-magnet, and thus present a\n\u201cfoundation in physics\u201d not yet recognised.\nWith regard to the pretension that \u201c the whole of animal magnetism is\nfounded on misconception,\u201d I would point out that this attitude can scarcely\nbe maintained after studying the demonstrations of Professor Boirac (head\nof the Grenoble University). This experimentalist showed in the Revue de\nPsychologie,'l\u2018 of May 1st, that suggestion and snesmerism are two distinct\nindependent agents, which may replace and counterfeit each other or\nsupplement and combine together. \u201cWe may have suggestion without\nmesmerism, or mesmerism without suggestion ; a pseudo-mesmerism may\noccur which really is only suggestion, and a pseudo-suggestion which really\nis only mesmerism ; while a suggestive mesmerism or mesmeric suggestion\nmay also be effected, in which the two are indivisibly combiner .\u201d\nThe simultaneously combined effects of suggestion and of magnetism acting\nindependently in the same subject were illustrated, followed by demonstra\ntions of the e\ufb02ects of magnetic action in opposition with and inhibiting the\neffect of suggestion.\nIllustrations were given in Light, p. 297, 1897, of demonstrations by the\nsame operator of the transmission of this energy along a copper wire from a\ndistance, inducing local anaesthesia in a blindfolded subject, apart from\nsuggestion.\nI myself, acting under Professor Boirac\u2019s instruction, have reproduced\nsome of his experiments. Holding my hand pointed at the knee of a blind\nfolded subject, at a few inches distance, local anaesthesia was produced after\na few minutes. I did not know whether I would succeed, as I had seen other\nexperimenters fail. The subject was in his normal state, consequently not\nsuggestible.\nProfessor Boirac then took hold of the hand of one of the experimenters\nwho had failed to induce the phenomenon and told him to try again,\nfollowed by successful results, showing that the in\ufb02uence was transmitted\nfrom the Professor through the experimenter to the subject.

He then sent his manservant, who was also a\nsubject, from another room in his normal state, to bring him a glass of water\nfrom the decanter in the dining-room. The contact with the magnetism\nstored in the water bottle threw the subject into the secondary state.

The Major then\ntold the Doctor that he had always possessed this in\ufb02uence, which gave him\na strong command over his men. He had. however, ceased using it since the\nfollowing experiences, which had really frightened him. He had one day,\nacting with her consent, mesmerised his sister-in-law.

He then took her to the physical laboratory; and having\nhypnotised her, presented to her the poles of an electro-magnet, which was\nactuated by a battery, the plates of which could be lifted out of the cells by -\nmeans of a framework, so that the patient could not discover either by sight or\nhearing when the current was \ufb02owing. He was surprised at the attraction\nwhich the pole, that she described as showing red light, exercised upon her ;\nshe struggled to be allowed to bathe her hands in it. The other pole, on the\ncontrary. which showed to her blue light, just as strongly repelled her and\ncaused her to shrink away from it. One or two of the other doctors assisted\nhim in this experiment. The current was from time to time interrupted;\nand the patient observed the cessation of the luminous phenomena and\ntheir re-appearance.\nThis story was told to me in June, 1893.

And his giving this account to Dr.\nKerner for publication in after life, when he was a person of some ot\ufb01cial\nstanding, is a guarantee of his earnestness that we should not overlook.\nI also protest against what seems to me an interpretation of part of Mrs.\nWesley\u2019s evidence that is wholly unjusti\ufb01ed by the facts. She narrates how,\ngoing down the stairs with her husband, two sounds were heard, \u201con my\nside\u201d like a bag of money emptied, \u201cand on his\u201d as if a quantity of bottles\nwere smashed. Mr. Podmore says this means that there was only one sound\ndifferently interpreted by the two people ! And because in another account\nshe says that these sounds were not simultaneous, that therefore she is not\nto be believed, and, generally, that nothing at all occurred but what could\nhave been, and therefore in all probability was produced by one of the\ndaughters, Hetty, who did not give her own account of what happened in\naddition to the accounts of the eight other members of the family !\nThis is quite in the style of \u201c historic doubts,\u201d and as such I leave it to\nyour readers.\nALFRED R.

My (supposed) belief in \u201c tricks\u201d has nothing to\ndo with the question whether independent slate-writing (which I have never\nseen) exists or not, nor with the cases I have adduced.

It\nwas published in the Rebus in 189\u00b0 :\u2014\nI am at present in my 61st year. The inexplicable phenomenon, which I\nwitnessed, took place 45 years ago in October, 1846. My father, a controller\nof the Tver Court of Exchequer, lived in the merchant Nazaroff\u2019s house at\nthe corner of Semionovskaia-street, in Tver. This house was built of stone,\nand had two \ufb02oors, the upper part being occupied by the Nazaroff family,\nwhilst my father and family lived in the lower ; there were no other\ninhabitants in the house. . . . . Our family consisted of my father,\nmother, two sisters of my father, one of whom was a widow, and the other\nan old maid, and myself, a boy 15 years old, who was then in the 5th class\nof the Tver Gymnasium. In the Nazaroltfs\u2019 service were a cook, a maid,\nand a coachman, who had also charge of the court-yard (dc0\u2019rnik); and we\nhad a cook and a maid, who were both our serfs. As the Nazaroif family\nled a very modest and patriarchal life, we had the habit, as soon as my father\n\fAPRIL, 1899.] Cases. 59\nhad left the house, after 6 p.m., to attend to his ol\ufb01cial duties, of having the\ngate (leading into the yard) locked and the key given to the dvormilc; his\nroom was connected with the gate by a wire and bell, and he used to open\nthe gate when the bell had been rung. .\nMy father was in the habit of purchasing every year, in January and\nFebruary, \ufb01rewood for the whole year, part of which, with our landlord\u2019s\npermission, was placed under the porte coch\u00e9re and close to the wall of the\ngranary. There must have been some three or four saj\u00e9nes* of them. These\nlogs were rather large, probably weighing not less than 7 pounds each.\nI shall now describe the phenomenon itself; it is very vividly impressed on\nmy memory, though nearly half a century old. In the \ufb01rst half of October,\nI think, my father had as usual gone at 7 p.m. to the Court of Exchequer.\nto attend to his o\ufb02icial duties, where he stayed as late as 11 and sometimes\n12 o\u2019clock ; my mother and aunts sat down to work, and I began to prepare\nmy lessons for next day. About 10 p.m. our maid Martha entered the bed\nroom where my aunts were sitting and said : \u201c What is taking place in our\nyard? Someone is stealing the wood, I have heard several logs falling.\u201d I\nwas rather an audacious boy, and felt tired of sitting and working, so I\navailed myself of this opportunity and began to ask Martha to bring in a\ncandle, as the night was dark, and it was still darker under the porte\ncoch\u00e9re ; my mother and aunts also followed us. When in the yard, I heard\na log falling down from the pile, and, about two minutes later, another one.\nI tried to come nearer with a candle, but my mother laid hold of me and\nwould not let me go. Someone was sent to wake up Nicholas, the di:ornilc;\nhe came in, lit a lantern and even began to make the sign of the cross when\nhe heard the noise made by the logs falling. I have forgotten to add that\nthe yard at the Nazaroffs\u2019 was paved with stone. . . . The (lc0'rnik\nasserted that he had looked the gate immediately after my father had gone\nout and showed the key ; the back-door, leading into the garden, also proved\nto be locked ; consequentlya man would have been unable to enter the yard.\nThe Nazaroffs heard us talking in the yard and came out also, so that we\nwere twelve in number; three candles and a lantern were brought in and\nthrew su\ufb02lcient light both over the logs of wood and all the space under\nthe porfe coch\u00e9re, and this is what we all saw: out of the middle of the pile\n(not from the top of it, but out of the middle) a log would \ufb02y forth and fall\ndown on the \ufb02oor three arschin off. All the persons present were greatly\nfrightened and pressed close to each other. I proved to be the most\ncourageous of all and persuaded the dvornik to come with me nearer the logs\nof wood ; he carrying a lantern and myself a candle. I thought that\nperhaps a cat had got in between the wall and the logs, and tried to put my\nhand [there], but could not do it, as the logs were quite close to the wall.\nMeanwhile the logs would \ufb02y out with short intervals. This bombardment\nwith logs lasted for about 40 minutes, 27 in all being thrown out ; and\nanother remarkable thing was that the empty space, which remained after a\nlog had \ufb02own out was not \ufb01lled up with other logs and that we noticed no\n* 1 saj\u00e9m-=7 feet\n\f60 Journal of Society for 1%-;1\/cluicat Res-ewr-ch.

The dcormTk picked\nup the logs which had been thrown out and placed them close to another\nwall. The logs had not \ufb02own out of one place only but out of several ; but\nalways from the middle of the pile, not from the top of it or from the sides.\nIn the morning, when going to my gymnasium I met the dvomik and asked\nhim to try and pull a log out of the middle of the pile. Nicholas, a robust\nman of about 30, in spite of all his etforts was unable to pull out of the\nmiddle of the pile a single log. ()f course, all my relatives, as well as the\nproprietors of the house, put down the whole thing to the domovoi (house\nspirit) and his tricks.\nNone of the other witnesses of this phenomenon are alive at present;\neven a person younger than myself\u2014Nathalie, a daughter of the widow of\nNazarotfs son\u2014died in the seventies.\nI would have absolutely no reason to invent such a story ; and it seems\nto me that I can be trusted, seeing that I am 60 years old and have served\nthree Emperors in the Ministry of Public Instruction for 40 years.\nIvAN KoUPREYANoFF,\nLate Inspector of the Tver District School,\nbelonging to the nobility of Tver.\nP. 260.\nTHE \u201cWIDE WoRLD MAGAzINE,\u201d 1898, P. 361.\n\u201cFrom .Khcwtoum to the Source of the Nile.\u201d\u2014Dr. R.

They are\nalso said to have the power of divination, to restore lost cattle, tell fortunes,\nand perform other miraculous feats. In the morning, they are supposed to\nreturn to their natural shape, and can give information concerning what has\nhappened at any distance.\nNow, though I can offer no explanation whatever as to the methods of\nthese wizards, I had ample opportunity of verifying, in a very startling way,\nthe powers of one of their number, whose portrait I give you. In the \ufb01rst\nplace, the wizard generally partakes of some root known only to himself,\nwhich induces a very heavy sleep.

One morning, however, a man came into our tent, in a state of great\nexcitement. The local m\u2019logo, or wizard, he said, had been roaming the\ncountry the night before in the form of a jack-al. He had, the messenger\nwent on, visited a place called Meschera-er-Rek (which was some 550 miles\ndistant from Lado, our camping-place), and had seen two steamers, one of\nthem with mails for our party. Also, the steamers were commanded by a\nwhite pasha, who was minutely described. Now, in the ordinary course of\nnature the man could not possibly have covered so vast a stretch of country\nin one night\u2014nor even in twenty nights. I ridiculed the whole thing as\nabsolutely absurd. We were having our co\ufb02'ee at the time, and Emin\nseemed inclined to give credence to the story, for he suddenly rose up and\nsaid he would have the man brought before him. In due time the wizard\n(whose portrait here is reproduced) was marched into our tent, and Emin at\nonce addressed him in Arabic, saying, \u201c Where did you go to last night ?\u201d\n\u201c I was at Meschera-er-Rek,\u201d he replied in the same tongue.\n\u201c What were you doing there ?\u201d\n\u201c I went to see some friends.\u201d\n\u201c What did you see ?\u201d\n\u201c I saw two steamers arTiving from Khartoum.\u201d\n\u201c Oh ! this is nonsense. You could not possibly have been at Meschera~\ner-Rek last night.\u201d\n\u201c I was there,\u201d came the tacit rejoinder, \u201cand with the steamers was an\nEnglishman \u2014a short man with a big beard.\u201d\n\u201c Well, what was he doing\u2014what was his mission ?\u201d\n\u201cHe says that the great Pasha at Khartoum has sent him, and he has\ngot some papers for you. He is starting overland to-morrow to come to\nyou, bringing the papers with him, and he will be here about thirty days\nfrom now.\u201d\nAs a matter of fact, concluded Dr. Felkin, the m\u2019logo\u2019s statement proved\nabsolutely correct. In thirty-two days an Englishman did arrive in our\ncamp, bringing letters for us from Khartoum. More than this, we knew\nfrom the wizard\u2019s description that Lupton Bey, and none other, was the man\nwho was coming. We were disappointed at the news that Lupton brought,\nbecause, although he had removed twenty-six miles of grass obstruction,\nthere was still too much of it for us to think of returning to Khartoum by\nsteamer. As to the wizard, I am quite satis\ufb01ed in my mind that he had\nnever in his life been very far outside his own village. The guess-work\ntheory is quite out of the question, the circumstances being quite extra\nordinary and the overland journey most unusual.\nEXPOSURE OF A TRICK CODE.\nThe following letter from the Mayor of Crewe to Professor Lodge\n(which the writer kindly allows us to print here) is of interest as\ndescribing the ingenious detection of an ingenious trick.

PRoFsssoR LoDGE,\u2014I derive some little consolation to-day from\nthe proverb \u201c It\u2019s only fools who never change their minds.\u201d I wrote you\non the 10th that I believed the thought transmission phenomena of the\nBrothers Jones to be genuine. I write to-day to say that I am quite con\nvinced they are produced by trickery.\nI know you would have been greatly interested if I could have reported\ngenuine phenomena, but I believe you will in some degree be interested to\nhear how such can be imitated by clever tricksters.\nThe modus operandi of the Brothers Jones in public is as follows. One\nbrother (A) is blindfolded, while the other (B) goes round among the audience.\nI hand to B, for example, a book containing the rules of the Crewe Izaak\nWalton Angling Club, whose headquarters are the Albert Hotel, Crewe. A\nrapid conversation, something like this, follows :\u2014\n\u201c What am I looking at now ? \u201d\n\u201c A book.\u201d\n\u201c What colour is it ? \u201d\n\u201c Blue.\u201d\n\" What does it relate to ?\u201d\n\u201cTo a club.\u201d\n\u201c Where does the club meet ? \u201d\n\u201c At the Albert Hotel.\u201d\nAnd so on, all over the circus with 30 or 40 different articles, coins, watches,\nbooks, hats, sticks, pipes, etc. The answers are occasionally a little vague\nbut are unfailing in accuracy. You may suspect a verbal code, though you\nwonder how a code can give \u201c book,\u201d \u201c blue,\u201d \u201c club,\u201d and \u201c Albert I-Iotel.\"\nYour suspicions are however soon allayed. B announces that A, while\nblindfolded, will write on a blackboard the time by a watch, or the number\nof a note or cheque, \u201c without word or action.\u201d You hand your watch to B,\nhaving taken the precaution to alter it a few hours so as to eliminate guesses\nfrom the experiment. B stands like a statue at one side of the arena, and\nwatch in hand, gazes with knitted brow at A, who slowly writes the exact\ntime indicated by the watch (say 3.48) on the blackboard. If you have\nsuspected a verbal code, here is proof that you are wrong. B stands by you,\n10 yards at least from A. and you are quite certain B neither speaks nor\nmoves. Thus I became a believer.\nThis was what I saw at the circus. I invited the gentlemen to Dr.\nWilson\u2019s, and there they volunteered and gave the show which I have\ndescribed in a previous letter. They did not give the blackboard test.\nI was, of course, aware that I had made no test, but I was su\ufb02iciently\nsatis\ufb01ed of the genuine value of the phenomena to ask you to make a test or\nto be present when I made one. Jones Brothers agreed to a test and led\nme to believe they would accept my conditions.\nLast evening I made the test at my rooms. There were present with the\ncircus proprietor, four of my friends (two doctors, a lawyer, and a parson),\nand a newspaper reporter (who arrived late) to take shorthand notes.\nI>.W?-P\u2019?-P~\"?'P\u00b0\u2018\n\fAPRIL, 1899.] Cases. 63\nI placed A behind a large screen, produced a medal struck to commemorate\nthe marriage of the Duke of York, gave it to B and suggested that A should\ndescribe it without word from B. To this they both objected. A could best\ngive his description in answer to questions, they said. I then offered that I\nwould put to A any question which B would write down, but this was\nobjected to. B must speak. Here the test was at an end before it was\nbegun. I decided, however, to let them go on in their own way, and see if\nI could learn their methods, which I now suspected were \u201ctricky.\u201d\nTheir usual performance was then gone through. Articles were given\nto B, and A who sat behind the screen described them, in answer to B\u2019s\nquestions, with his usual accuracy and rapidity.\nThen one of my guests suggested that A should give the number of a\ncheque without spoken word, as at the circus, and A agreed. During the\nconversation A had come from behind the screen, and when I suggested that\nhe should return there for the purposes of the experiment, he said he would\nsooner be blindfolded. I politely pressed my suggestion but he was\nobdurate. (Suspicion No. 1). I blindfolded him, but on the pretence that\nthe handkerchief was not tight enough he took it off and tied it again\nhimself. (Suspicion No. 2). A and B now sat on chairs about 8ft. apart\nand facing each other. My guests stood behind B, and one of them handed\n' him a cheque. As no word was to be spoken, I knew that I had only to\nprevent communications to the eye, so at this moment I stepped into the\ndirect line between A and B. The following sketch roughly indicates our\npositions, P is myself, R reporter, G guests.\nThe \ufb01rst number of the cheque was given incorrectly. The second\nnumber was given correctly. I turned round (I was facing B) and found A\nwas leaning his head on his hand at one side of the chair so that he could\n(subject to the \u201cblindfo1d\u201d) see past me. I moved into the new line of\nsight. Again a number was given incorrectly. Now, as in a tremendous\nmental effort, A threw himself on the \ufb02oor, his head being actually under the\ncorner of the table. A number was correctly given. The communication,\njudged by the only possible line of sight, was evidently near the ground.\nI accordingly cast my eyes down and lo ! the secret was revealed.

The most\ninteresting feature of the case, however, appears to me to have been\nthe circumstance that the mediums did not see the letters of the\nalphabet. This is stated by both of them as well as by the third\nperson present at the sitting; and if we take into account the fact\nthat the value of the case in question entirely depends upon the bo\/na\n\ufb01des of Mme and M\\\\8 Starck\u2014we surely ought not to be illogical\nenough to set aside their testimony on this special feature of the\nincident whilst accepting it in toto.\nNow, a message obtained under such conditions would involve at\nthe very least telepathy in a strangely continuous form from M. Starck ;\nand makes it increasingly possible that the \u201cveridical\u201d part of the com\nmunication may have sprung from a supernormal source too; whilst\notherwise we might have put it down with more plausibility either to\nunconscious reasoning or to chance coincidence.

I\nhave come across some quite lately of which that given below is but an\ninstance; and I have no reason to think my position from the point of\nview of the amount and quality of accessible information on the subject\nis more favourable than that of any other person reasonably interested\nin psychical matters and possessing a rather wide circle of acquaint\nances. Unfortunately the amount of readiness in the recipients of\nsuch messages to write accounts of what has happened to them\u2014even\nat the urgent request of friends\u2014appears to be in inverse proportion to\nthe supposed frequency in general of the facts themselves. . . .

No trance. All\nthe writers are in a perfectly normal state. They are keeping their hands\non the saucer with eyes blindfolded; I read and write down.

The following words were obtained after I had sat down at\nthe table again ; my wife and daughter having not left the table at all. I\nonly told them there was something convincing in the message. Then I was\nextremely astonished by the information as to his having been drowned in\nthe sea, whilst I was quite sure this had occurred in the river, as the only\ninformation I had accidentally had on the subject from a former colleague\nof mine was to the effect that Skrytnikoff was drowned in Pzezuappe river,\nhis chiefs being convinced of it till now. I knew no details whatever about\nSkrytnikoff, and only the idea as to his having been drowned in a\nriver could have originated in my head and among my household\u2014and this\nonly as a transitory long since forgotton impression ; it was once mentioned\nin the autumn, and I am not even quite sure of it.\nThe proc\u00e9s verbal gave me but little that was new, but the words \u201c he was\ncarried away by the water into the sea,\u201d gave my thoughts an impulse [in the\ndirection] that it had actually been so, i.e., that he was drowned in the sea :\nthere is not more than half a verst from the spot where the river is crossed\nto the sea, it being a mountain stream and in high water. Of course he was\nquickly carried into the sea ; his weapon (a sabre, I think) being found cast\nashore on the sea coast, not far from the river. A year before I had been\nhis chief and am sure he felt kindly towards me as the other soldiers did.\nThe present message was, I think, obtained at the 3rd s\u00e9ance.

' 69\nAN AUSTRALIAN VVITCH.\nMr. Andrew Lang allows us to print the following curious narrative\nreceived from a correspondent in whom he places con\ufb01dence.\u2014ED.\nA girl who was staying with me was taken suddenly, and, to us,\nunaccountably ill. She was not con\ufb01ned to her bed, being able to drag herself\nwearily into my sitting-room where she would lie back in a long chair,\nlooking as limp as a piece of washed out unbleached calico.\nThe oldest native woman in the Varran, hearing of my friend\u2019s illness,\ncame up to see me about it. She was in the habit of coming up should anyone\nbe ill, and wrapping her string charms round their wrists and droning\nincantations over them. She asked me what was the matter, and what had\nmade the Bullah Meai (white girl) sick.\nWhen I told her that I did not know, she said she would ask some of the\nspirits, with whom she was in communion, what was the matter and what we\nhad better do. Thinking it might rouse my patient-\u2014-who, being a town girl,\nfound the natives a novelty, \u2014I asked her to come in.\nThe old woman on entering went up to the patient, expressed sympathy\nand said she would talk with the spirits. To that end she squatted down in\nthe middle of the room and began muttering in a foreign dialect. Presently\nher voice ceased and we both heard a most peculiar whistling sort of voice\nutter some words, to which the old woman responded. She was answered by\nthe same whistling voice. Then two or three times she evidently asked the\nsame thing, but received no reply.\nAfter waiting a few moments she turned to me and told me that she had\nbeen asking Big Joe\u2014a black fellow who had died some years before\u2014to\ntell her what she wanted to know, but he would not ; so now she was going\nto ask the spirit of a long dead grand-daughter of hers. Again she mumbled\na so1t of incantation and again after a while came a whistling voice, not\nquite such a loud one as the \ufb01rst. The same sort of thing was gone through,\nwith the same result. Then the old woman told me she was going to ask the\nspirit of Guadgee\u2014a girl who had been one of my \ufb01rst favourites in the\ncamp, a little ebony black curly-headed baby when I came here, and who\nhad died comparatively recently\u2014to help her. This effort was successful.\nGaudgee answered at once.\nIn reply as to cause of illness she said my friend had offended the spirits\nby bathing under the shade of a Uniggah\u2014that is a tree taboo to all but its\nwirreerum, or wizard, whom it serves as a rallying place for his spirit friends\u2014\nor where he con\ufb01nes captured dream spirits, or secretes at times with perfect\nsafety some of his magical properties, such as sacred crystals, gowceras\npoison, sticks, or bones, as anything is safe in a Uniggah because in them\nare\u2014invisible to all but wizards\u2019 eyes\u2014swarms of spirit bees which violently\nattach any such violater.\nMy friend had insulted the spirits by plunging into the shadow of this\nUniggah, for all shadows are spirits of what throws them, which any injury\nto the shadow likewise affects. The spirit bees had bitten my friend, said\nGuadgee, on the back and secreted on her liver some wax. This was the\n\f70 Jowwrral of Society for Psychical Research. [Mxr, 1899.\ncause of her illness, and she said that if we looked at my friend\u2019s back the\nbee bites would be seen.\nThere were certainly some irritable in\ufb02amed spots where indicated.\nWhen the old woman told me all Guadgee\u2019s spirit had said, I, knowing where\nthe Uniggah was, and knowing where the invalid bathed with my coloured\nhouse girls, said Guadgee was wrong for I knew the girls would be much too\nfrightened to bathe in the shade of the Uniggah.\nBut the old woman stuck to her story and said Guadgee would not lie.\n\u201cIs the Uniggah a big coolabah between the bend and the garden?\u201d\nasked my friend.\u201d\n\u201c Yes. \u201d\n\u201c Well, then, I did bathe there the last time I went down. I was up too\nlate to go with the girls, so slipped away alone, and as the sun was hot I went\nround the bend into the shade of the big tree, where I had a lovely swim.\"\nThe source of the illness settled to the old woman\u2019s satisfaction, she next\ninterrogated the friendly spirit as to a cure.\nGuadgee\u2019s power\u2014spirit\u2014whistled its reply.\nThe patient was to drink nothing hot or heating, but as much cold water\nas she liked, before she went to bed; she was to take a long drink, after\nwhich she would sleep. During her sleep Guadgee would come and remove\nthe wax from her liver through which operation she would sleep soundly\naIId in the morning awaken refreshed and almost well. The old woman was\nto say a charm over her before she went.\nThis she did, rubbing her round the wrist while she did so. Then she\nwent off saying she was taking the spirits away inside her, but Guadgee\u2019s\nwould return during the night, before going back to the Uniggah in her\nnoorumbah, or hereditary hunting ground, where the wirreerums had\nplaced it. That night my friend slept soundly, awoke almost to her usual\nhealth in the morning, with the washed out, yellow look gone.\nThe old woman sometimes made the spirit voice come through her own\nlips, sometimes from her wrist, sometimes from her shoulder, on two\noccasions \ufb01rst from one end of the room and then from the other.\nShe is said to have within her many magic crystals. Should she lose these\nher power would go. One of her daughters had a like power of invoking\n'spirit aid\u2014but she took to the white mau\u2019s grog and the spirits all left\nher. She shows you the marks they make during exit from her back.\nAny of these wirreerums, witches or wizards can produce these crystals\nin quantities apparently from inside themselves. My brother once let an\nold wizard suck his wrist, thinking he could detect where he had secreted the\ncrystals he appeared to be sucking from my brother, but the old fellow was\nmuch to smart. The old fellow\u2019s mouth was empty when he applied his lips\nto my brother\u2019s arm, but in a very short time he began spitting out pebbles\npurporting to be drawn from my brother.\nThe old spiritualist woman, whenever my husband is away and she thinks\nI am unprotected, marches up to the house with a smoking bunch of Butda\ntwigs, and crooning to herself she walks all round. The smoke is to keep\nthe spirits away.\n\f1~IA\\', 1899.] Correspondence. 71\nLately she came to tell me she was going away for some time to see some\nold friends on the Barwon, and as there would be no one to protect me\nshould I be alone while she was away, she was going to erect two painted\nsticks in my garden, one to keep all spirits of the dead away, the other\nto keep the spirits that come out from the sunset. She would also put two\nhuge painted logs, which had in them the spirits of alligators, up near my\ngarden tank, that these alligators might see my tank was not empty even\nwhile she, our rain maker, was away.\nThe painted sticks and logs are now in my garden, and we are waiting\nthe result of old Bargie\u2019s magic, for my tank is getting low.\nWe all tried to make the whistling voice of the spirits, but with no success ;\nevidently you require to be initiated, or shall we say a ventriloquist '!\nK.

The two subjects, a male and a female,\nwent through what might be called the same performance; clutching\nexcitedly at blue el\ufb01uences emanating from the North pole of the magnet\n(a straight bar), and \ufb02eeing or turning away from red e\ufb02luences of the\nSouth pole. This experiment was not, in my opinion, of much value.\nDr. Luys had given us, in audible voice, a clear idea of what the subjects\nwould see, thus introducing two elements of error :\u20141st. Trickery on the\npart of the subjects. 2nd. Suggestion. The woman, at least, was subse\nquently ascertained to be unreliable.\nThe second experiment was conducted at the Hotel Continental, of\nParis, by the late Mr. Ernest Hart, of London. A wooden \u201cmagnet \u201d\nhaving been provided, the subject, a woman, when placed in the secondary\nstate, saw no radiaitons. When, however, an induction coil was placed\nbefore her, she saw them when the current was closed, and did not see them\nwhen it was broken. She did not, however, correctly differentiate the poles\nthrough the colour of the ef\ufb02uences. The excitement witnessed in the other\ntwo subjects was totally absent. The room was so small that the least\nmotion could be discerned, and the bichromatc cell of which I had charge\ndid not work quite smoothly. Suggestion might also have in\ufb02uenced the\nresults here. While Dr. Luys was anxious to have the subjects see\nradiations Mr. Hart was anxious that his subject should not see them.\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psy\/chical Reserwch.

And in view of this reticence, and of Miss\nHetty\u2019s singular habit of trembling in a sound sleep when loud noises were\ngoing on all around her, and of the notable predilection shown by the\nPoltergeists for her person, it hardly seems worth while to enquire whether\nthe noises which perplexed the Wesley family did indeed proceed from a\nsupernormal source.\u201d\nDoes Mr. Podmore intend to convey the impression that Miss Hetty was\nthe \u201cnaughty little girl\u201d of this story, and that she was carrying out a\nsystem of common trickery for the entertainment of her family? If so, the\nreason why Mr. Podmore \u201c cannot \ufb01nd evidence\u201d is made plain, and there\nis nothing more to be said.\n- If, on the other hand, he suspects that Miss Hetty may have (consciously\nor unconsciously) used, or transmitted, that \u201c power of projection\u201d by\nwhich one mind is able to reach and control other minds, why hesitate to\nsay so '3\nIt is true that there is enough in sight to make a thoughtful man pause\nand \u201c gather in his breath \u201d\u2014as Tesla in his laboratory is said to do some\ntimes\u2014realizing that he is upon the verge of something terri\ufb01c, but he must\nnot pause too long, lest the forces should scatter and much of the preliminary\ntoil and sacri\ufb01ce be lost.\nAsm L.

My former rather autocratic\ncalling was not calculated to make of me a bowing and smiling boniface, so,\naltogether, before the opening of another season I had made up my mind to\nget out of the business as soon as I could\u2014and realising that at the beginning\nof the tourist season was the best time to do so, early in November of the\nsame year I called upon Mr. L., president of the board of directors con\ntrolling the property (which was owned by a stock company) and stated my\ndetermination to quit, and asked to be informed just what terms the board\nwould offer to a new tenant should I be able to procure one for the hotel.\nMr. L., who was a personal friend, said he was very sorry to have to\ninform me that the owners of the building had decided not to lease the\nproperty again as a hotel. Upon the expiration of my lease, or sooner if I\ngave it up, they would divide the building into three separate parts, by\npartition walls and additional stairways, elevators, etc. ; that they hoped\nthen to be able to sell the property ; in fact they already had a prospective\npurchaser for one of the parts ; that the board had already approved\nthe architects\u2019 plans for doing the work, etc.\nUpon receiving this information I was much disappointed, for in order\nto obtain a lease in the \ufb01rst instance, I had been obliged to buy the\nfurniture, and unless I could dispose of it to a successor, it would be almost\na total loss. I saw the other members of the board, and was told the same\nthing, only one of the board of six members\u2014Colonel H.\u00bb-being in favour\nof continuing it as a hotel. The certainty of this loss staring in the face and\nmy increasing ill health operated to greatly depress me. I had already\nasked several of my acquaintances in the business. Mr. A. C. B. of a leading\nhostelry in a near by city among them, to send anyone they might see\nlooking for a hotel to me.\nOn or about the \ufb01rst of December following, a Mr. M., \u201c Sunday editor\u201d\nof a leading paper in the city, came to me to engage certain accommodations\nfor two ladies. I replied that that was my business, and I thought I could\nentertain any friends of his. He said he was not sure that I would care to\nhave these people in my house, as one of them was a professional \u201c spirit\n\f74 Jo'u\/rnal of Society for Psychical Research.

In my capacity of landlord I,\nof course, saw more or less of them, and as it was our \ufb01rst contact with\n\u201cmodern spiritualism,\u201d observed them and their callers with considerable\ncuriosity.\nBoth my wife and myself were pronounced agnostics in matters relating\nto a future state of existence, and were not without some little prejudice\nagainst spiritualism, although generally very liberal and tolerant of the\nbeliefs of others.\nMany well-known and, as I remarked to my wife, \u201c otherwise sensible\npeople\u201d visited her, and twice a week she held \u201c public circles,\u201d attended\nby from ten to twenty-\ufb01ve people. The medium was a re\ufb01ned-looking girl\nabout eighteen, but not otherwise remarkable, and had very little education\nor culture except that derived from her contact with people. She invited\nmy wife and myself to attend her circles at any time, and one evening after\nthe invitation had been repeated, we went out of curiosity. There were\nsome \ufb01fteen people besides ourselves. The medium became supposedly en\ntranced. In a voice totally unlike her ordinary tone, she greeted her\naudience with a few words of welcome, and commencing with the person on\nher right, she devoted a few moments to each, delicately phrasing her\nmessage so that little clue was given to the others of the matters alluded to.\nIn the cases of one or two, of whose affairs I happened to know somewhat,\nI was struck with the aptness of her control\u2019s remarks.\nComing at length to me, among other things she said I was \u201cgreatly\nworried over the outcome of a certain business venture, but that worry was\nwholly \u2018 unnecessary,\u2019 as she (the \u2018 Control \u2019) could \u2018 see that it was coming\nout all right.\u2019 \u201d She went on to say that, \u201c about the middle of the\nJanuary moon of the New Year,\u201d a \u201c dark, foreign woman,\u201d who \u201cspoke\nwith a foreign accent,\u201d and had \u201c black eyes and black hair,\u201d worn\npompadour (pushing the medium\u2019s back in that style), \u201c high cheek-bones,\u201d\nwould be introduced to me by a \u201cchief\u201d (gentleman), a friend wearing a\n\u201clight-coloured overcoat.\u201d That this woman was coming, or had recently\ncome, \u201cfrom a large city in the East.\u201d That she would buy my interest,\nand the papers would all be executed, and the transfer would be made \u201con\nthe \ufb01rst day of the February moon \u201d following. She stated, however, that I\nwould not get any money then, but I would later, after much delay. That\nit was best for me to accept her offer, that my condition of health demanded\na change. She said that the woman would make a success of the business.\nOther private matters were unmistakably alluded to, matters unknown to\nany but ourselves.\nComing to my wife in her turn the \u201c Control,\u201d among other things\ncautioned her that she was on the verge of a serious illness caused by\n\fMn. 1899-] Cases. 75\nin\ufb02amed condition of her kidneys\u2014an allusion that annoyed my wife at the\ntime\u2014but she said \u201c M\u2014-\u201d (the \u201c Control\u2019s \u201d name) \u201c cannot see that\nit is to have a fatal termination \u201d with a curious rising in\ufb02ection on the last\nword\u2014how well we remembered it later !\nOn December 20th my wife, who was learning to ride a bicycle, was thrown\nby her machine getting away from her going down hill, and fell, striking\nthe sharp edge of a square telephone pole across her right side and back.\nOn the 23rd she was taken with acute nephritis, undoubtedly caused by the\nblow, and for two weeks her life hung in the balance, but it was not until\nafter she became convalescent that either of us remembered the \" Control\u2019s \u201d\nprediction.\nOne day, about the middle of January, 1896, a friend, Major A. H. N.\nin the city, a real estate agent, came to me and said he had brought a woman\nto look at the hotel, Mr. A. C. B., before referred to, having told her\nthat I wished to dispose of my lease. I now distinctly remember that the\nMajor wore a \u201clight-coloured overcoat,\u201d although, when I wrote the \ufb01rst\ndraft of this case, I had forgotten it until my friend J. M. S. called my\nattention to it by saying that my wife in relating it to her in May, 1896, had\nmentioned the fact that Major N. did wear a \u201c light-coloured overcoat.\u201d\nI began to feel decidedly queer as the Major went on, but I told him\nfrankly that it was no use to consider the matter, and explained why. He\nrequested, however, that I go into the parlour and see her anyhow. I went\nin, and he introduced me to an apparently well-educated German lady,\nfiil\ufb01lliiig in every respect the description given in the circle a month before.\nShe told me that she had just come from Philadelphia, and had just bought\na fruit farm through the Major, but that she did not intend to live upon it,\nand not wishing to be idle, and understanding the hotel business thoroughly\n\u2014-her late husband having kept a leading hotel in Leipsic, Germany, and\nshe had run it after his death\u2014she was looking for some such hotel as this.\nI answered her as I had the Major. She remarked that people some\ntimes changed their minds, and that now she was there she would look at\nthe house if I would kindly show it to her, which I did. She was pleased\nwith it, and asked me to see the owners and see if they would make an\nappointment, and listen to a proposition she would make. She left her ad\ndress, and they went back to the City.\nThe next day I saw Col. H., and through his efforts the board met,\ntalked the matter over again, made an appointment to listen to the woman\u2019s\nproposition ; she was noti\ufb01ed, she came and made it, and after much dis\ncussion and delay her proposition was accepted, the necessary legal papers\nwere executed, and the actual transfer was made \u201c on the \ufb01rst day of the\nFebruary moon,\u201d exactly as predicted.\nNeither did I get any cash. I took notes, which at the timeI considered\nwell secured ; but if I ever get the money it will be stranger than the fore\ngoing, for she made an utter failure of the business, and gave it up a year\nlater.\nHere is a series of predictions ful\ufb01lled, almost to the letter, only one\nhaving failed absolutely to come to pass.\n\f76 J0'u\/renal of Society for Puyciiicai lies-earch. [Mmr,1899.\nIn them, from the nature of the case, it seems impossible that the events\npredicted could have been guessed or known normally beforehand, or\ninferred with a complete knowledge of all the circumstances.\nSubsequent experience with this same \u201cpsychic\u201d has shown me that such\nsuccesses, though sometimes they have been equalled, are very rare with her.\nIs there any scienti\ufb01c theory covering such a faculty of precognition P\nThe explanation given by this \u201cintelligence\u201d calling itself \u201cM,\u201d and\nclaiming to be a spirit many thousand years \u201c dead,\u201d is that \u201c' coming events\ncast their shadows before,\u201d and that the mistakes that so often occur do so\nthrough the spirits\u2019 inability to read the shadows correctly.

A FAMILY GHosT.\nThe following experience was communicated by Lady Beding\ufb01eld.\nHer account is supplemented by the report of a conversation in\nwhich further details were obtained.\nDuring one of the visits which my husband, Sir Henry Beding\ufb01eld, and I\npaid to Costessey Park near Norwich, as the guests of the late Lord Sta\ufb02brd*\nand his wife, I had a very singular experience.\nOn my arrival Lady Stafford came up to my room and had a talk with me.\nIn the course of conversation she mentioned that there would be no mass on\nthe morrow owing to the absence of their priest, which would be prolonged for\nseveral days. I expressed some regret at missing the chance of making his\nacquaintance, as I had heard a good deal about him from a friend of mine,\nwhich had made me very anxious to meet him.\nA large house party assembled at dinner, and afterwards adjourned to\nthe principal drawing-room. Glancing upwards towards a table about which\nseveral persons were grouped, I was extremely surprised to see, standing\nwith his back to me, a grey-haired priest, dressed in the foreign fashion,\nwith a soutune, and a sash round his waist. He stood between Lord Stafford\nand Sir Robert Gerard and held up to the lamp what looked like a parch\nment MS. After what my hostess had said before dinner I could not\naccount for the presence of this ecclesiastic, and I waited for a pause in her\nconversation with her guests to call her attention to him. This opportunity\ndid not occur for fully a qiiarter of an hour during the whole of which time\nI had the priest and his MS. in view, although I never saw his face. The\nservants coming in with trays of tea and coffee caused a slight commotion,\nand when they had left I was about to inquire of my hostess what she had\nmeant by informing me that there was no priest in the house, and asking her\nwho the one present might be, when I perceived that he was no longer in the\nroom. I assumed that he had slipped out unobserved by me when the\nservants left the apartment.\nOn our withdrawing for the night I asked my husband who the foreign\npriest was who had stood at the drawing-room table for so long. At \ufb01rst he\n* Henry Valentine, 6th baron.\n\fMAY, 1899.] Cases. 77\npooh-poohcd the whole thing, but \ufb01nally he informed me that, though he\nhad seen nothing himself, Costessey Park was undoubtedly said to be\nhaunted by a priest. Now I am absolutely certain that this was the \ufb01rst time\n1 had ever heard of this ghost at Costessey Park.\n(Signed) A. L. BEDINGFIELD.\nI perfectly recollect my wife telling me this story that evening exactly as\nshe describes it here, and i am con\ufb01dent, from her remarks when I informed\nher that that was the family ghost at Costessey, that she had never heard of\nit before.\nI also advised her not to mention the matter\u2014which will explain why she\ndid not, before leaving Costessey, enquire of Lord Stafford or Sir R. Gerard\nwho was the priest with whom they had been conversing.\n(Signed) HENRY BEDINGFIELD.\nThrough an interview with Lady Beding\ufb01eld the following further\nparticulars were obtained:\u2014\nQ. \u201c Was it during Lady B.\u2019s \ufb01rst visit to Costessey Park that she had\nthis hallucination 'l\u201d A. \u201c No. Not by any means the \ufb01rst visit.\u201d\nQ. \u201c \u2018Dressed in the foreign fashion.\u2019 Was there any likelihood that\nthe regular priest of Costessey Park might have been dressed in the foreign\nfashion ? \u201d A. \u201c No. He would certainly have been dressed in the\n\u2018 English fashion.\u2019 \u201d\nQ. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Lady B. during the quarter of an hour that the priest\nwas visible to her make any attempt to see his face by walking round to his\nend of the room, especially as she was surprised by his being present, and\nhad been desirous of making his acquaintance ?\u201d\nA. \u201c Don\u2019t quite know.

I haven\u2019t\nseen one,\u201d and the subject dropped\u2014interruption by servants, and so on.\nLady Sta\ufb01brd was very nervous and swore to leave Costessey Park the same\nday and never return if she ever saw a ghost there.

A CAsE oF CRYsTAL-VIsIoN.\nMiss Angus writes (January 4th, 1898) :\nI had another successful scry on Tuesday evening, 21st December, 1897,\nwhen Mr. Mac asked me to look in the ball. He had never seen\ncrystal gazing, so I told him to \ufb01x his mind on some scene, which I would\nendeavour to describe. Almost at once I saw a large room with a polished\n\ufb02oor re\ufb02ected, the lights being very bright and all round ; but the room was\nempty, which I thought very uninteresting ! Mr. Mac\u2014\u2014 said how strange\nthat was, as he had not, so far, been able to \ufb01x his mind on any particular\nface in the ballroom. However, he asked me to look again, and this time I\nsaw a smaller room, very comfortably furnished, and at a small table under\na bright light with a glass globe (no shade on the globe) sat a young girl, in\na high-necked white blouse, apparently writing or reading. I could not see\nher face distinctly, but she was pale, with her hair drawn softly off her\nforehead (no fringe), and seemed to have rather small features.\nMr. Mac said my description quite tallied with the lady he was\nthinking of, a Miss , whom he had met for the \ufb01rst time at a ball a few\nnights before, but he had meant me to see her dressed as he met her in the\nballroom.\nWe consulted our watches, and found that it was between 10.15 and\n10.30 when we were scrying, and Mr. Mac said he would try to \ufb01nd out\nwhat Miss was doing at that hour. Fortunately I had not long to\nwait for his report, as he met her the next evening. and told her of my\nexperiment. She was very much interested, I believe, and said it was all\nquite true ! She had been wearing a white blouse, and, as far as she\nremembers, she was still reading at 10.30 under a bright incandescent\nlight, with a glass globe on it.\nMr. Mac writes (December 30th, 1897) :\u2014\nI was at Miss Angus\u2019s house on Tuesday, December 21st, 1897. Miss\nAngus said that if I thought of somebody she would look in her crystal ball\nand \ufb01nd out the personal appearance of the person of whom I was thinking,\nand what he or she was doing at that moment (10.25 p.m.). She told me to\nthink of the surroundings and the place in which I had last seen the person\nof whom I was thinking. I thought of somebody that she did not know\u2014\nMiss , whom I had met at a dance on December 20th. I thought of the\nballroom where I had been introduced to her, but at \ufb01rst I could not centre\nmy mind on her face. Then Miss A. said that she saw a big room with a\npolished \ufb02oor, and which was brilliantly lit up, but that at present she\ncould not make out any people there. Then I succeeded in \ufb01xing my mind\n\fMAY, 1899.] Cases. 7 9\non Miss \u2019s face, when Miss A. said that she saw a girl with fair wavy\nhair either writing a letter or reading, but probably the former, under a\nlamp with a glass globe, and that she had a high-necked white blouse on.\nAll this took about \ufb01ve minutes. '\nI saw Miss again at a dance on December 22nd\u2014the next night. I\ntold her what had happened, and she said that, as far as she remembered,\nat 10.25 the night before she had been either writing a letter or reading, but\nprobably writing, under an incandescent gas-light with a glass globe, and\nthat she had been wearing a high-necked white blouse.\nI had only known Miss Angus for a very short time, so she did not know\nwhat friends I had in \u2014\u2014-. I do not think that Miss Angus knows\nMiss There were three other people in the room all the time, one of\nwhom was playing the piano. This is exactly what happened, as far as I\ncan remember.\nP. 262. A PREsRNTnuRNT FULFILLED.\nThe Hon. Mrs. Leir-Carleton, Greywell Hill, Winch\ufb01eld, writes as\nfollows :\u2014\nMrs. Hoptro\ufb01\" (resident in this village and mother of my maid, Tilley\nHoptro\ufb02) underwent an operation on August 20th [I898], in the Victoria\nHospital, Bournemouth. Her daughter remained with her until August\n23rd, when she was progressing satisfactorily, and insisted upon the girl\nreturning to \u201ckeep house for the boys,\u201d her brothers. On August 26th,\nabout 9 a.m., I was sitting at my dressing-table, trying to brush my hair,\nin despite of hindrance from a pet cat (that would play with my sleeve-ru\ufb02ies,\nand was getting scolded, yet encouraged), when I suddenly became aware of\nthis assertion: \u201cMrs. Hoptroff will pass, to-day.\u201d There was no sound,\nbut I felt as clearly impressed with those \ufb01ve words as if they had been\nuttered close to me. I may remark that \u201cpass\u201d is not an expression I\nshould be likely to use, but this is the second time it has been used to\nimpress me. I sprang to my feet and stared around. My gaze lit upon the\nwriting-table, and (recollecting a similar experience that I had unluckily\nsupposed illusory and neglected to note) I at once scribbled the above\nsentence, dated, and shut it away. Then I admitted two old servants,\n(Mrs. Tilley and Mrs. Bolton), and as they entered I asked, \u201c What news\nof Mrs. Hoptroff?\u201d The answer was, \u201cOh, much better! The sickness\nhas left her, and the doctor ordered \ufb01sh for her dinner.\u201d I said, \u201c Well\n. . I must say I did not expect such good news. Somehow I have had\na_ feeling she might die after all, and perhaps to-day.\u201d I did not mention\nwhat had made me think this, because their information made me distrust\nmine, which indeed soon ceased to occupy my thoughts.\nThat night, at dinner, shortly after 8 o\u2019clock, there was brought to me a\ntelegram, that Tilley Hoptro\ufb02 had just received from Bournemouth,\nannouncingr \u201c a change for the worse.\u201d I directed my son where to \ufb01nd my\nmemorandum, which he brought, and everyone present read it.\nOn Sunday, August 28th, we learnt that Mrs. H. died on the evening\nof the 26th.\n\f80 Journal of Society for Psychical Reseawch.

Sister Illtyd heard of it from Sister Catherine, but not till\nafter the child\u2019s death. Sister Catherine\u2019s own narrative is as follows :\u2014\nOn Sunday the 14th August, 1898, when I was taking the boys for a walk to\nthe Rocking Stone, old Mrs. Thomas (who lives in one of Dr. Price\u2019s cottages\non the road to the common), came out to speak to me and asked if one of\nthe Home children had died that week. I said \u201c No,\u201d and asked why she\nwanted to know. She said, \u201c Because I saw a child\u2019s funeral going down the\nhill from the Home, but not the way you go down with the children, but to\nthe left, and I thought it must be one of the Home children because of the\nboys who were carrying the co\ufb02in and walking. I thought at \ufb01rst it was a\nschool.\u201d I enquired if any of the neighbours in Tower Road just below the\nHome had lost a child. None of them had, nor had any child\u2019s funeral passed\nthat week, but on the Wednesday of the following week, a little girl of three\nbelonging to one of the neighbours in Tower Road was accidentally drowned.\nThe child\u2019s mother came up to ask Sister Illtyd if our boys could carry the\nlittle one to the grave, as, on account of the strike, and nobody having any\ntidy clothes, she could not get anyone else. Sister Illtyd agreed to let the\nboys go though it is against our rule for them to attend any funerals\nexcept our own, and the procession went down the hill to the left just as\nMrs. Thomas had seen a fortnight before. Mrs. Thomas\u2019s house overlooks\nthis side of the valley and is nearly on a line with the Home.\nI did not tell Sister Illtyd what Mrs. Thomas had seen till after she had\ngiven permission for the boys to carry this child to the grave.\nPontypridd, February, 1899.\n\fNo. 0LX.\u2014VoL.

D\u2019OUTREPoNT oF WURzBURG.\nFrom Nasse\u2019s Zeitschmift far Psychische Aertze.\u2014First Quarterly Part\nfor 1821.\nTranslated and abridged by EDWARD T. BENNETT.\nIt is, I believe, of greater service to science when clearly attested facts,\nwhich are still considered doubtful by some, are simply publicly recorded,\nthan when explanations are added. The endeavour to explain everything is\na hindrance. Owing to this endeavour some important facts, which would\nhave aided the progress of science, have been consigned to oblivion. The\nexplanations with which the observers accompanied their statements of facts\ncast doubt upon the whole matter, and thus, as we say, emptied out the\nchild with the bath. This has happened with the divining rod. It\ncertainly would not have been so exalted on one side, or so despised on the\nother, if nothing more than a history of the way in which it works had\nbeen narrated.\nI will now place before the intelligent public a contribution to the\nhistory of the divining rod, which is all the more important because the\nman of whom I am going to speak is still alive; the people for whom he\nsought water, metals, and minerals, are still alive, and testify to the truth\nof his statements. I became acquainted with him in the course of a recent\n\f84 Jo'u\/rnal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jrmz,1899.\njourney in the Netherlands ; and when I told Professors Nasse and\nWindischmann, in Bonn, the facts of the case, they urged me to place them\nbefore the learned world.\nJohn Philipp Brayer was 35 years old when I met him. He was the son\nof a builder at Wawremont, a village near the town of Malmedy, with no\nspecial characteristics to distinguish him from his neighbours. He was\nbrought up to the trade of a house decorator, at which he became very\nclever, and was never without work. Five years previously to my becoming\nacquainted with him he had married, and was the father of two healthy\nboys. He gave me an account of his experiences with the rod in the course of\na long conversation carried on partly in French and partly in the Walloon\nlanguage.*\n\u201c I was born early on the \ufb01rst Sunday in the quarter. The same morn\ning, between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock, I was taken to the church to be baptised.\nThe minister told the god-parents that a boy who was born the \ufb01rst Sunday\nin the quarter, and baptised before 12 o\u2019clock, would be able to use the\ndivining rod. My god-parents did not know what was meant by a divining\nrod, but they told my father what the minister had said. My father had\nheard stories about the rod, but he only smiled ; and for the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve years\nof my life nothing was said about it. When I was \ufb01ve years old a colporteur\ncalled at my father\u2019s house, and, talking of one thing and another, told him\nabout the rod and its properties, and that there were men who could use it.\nMy father then recollected what the minister had said when I was baptised,\nand told the colporteur, who replied that it was not a thing to he laughed at\nor despised. \u2018Come,\u2019 he said, \u2018let us try.\u2019 My father was willing, cut a\nrod from a hazel-bush, hid a handful of money in a \ufb01eld a long way from\nthe house, put the rod into my hand, led me to the door, and said :\u2014\u2018I have\nhidden some money ; go and seek for it: the rod will show thee where it\nis.\u2019 I was highly delighted. I felt the rod draw me in a certain direction,\nand then it moved round in a circle in my hands. I followed the indication,\nand came to the place where the money was buried. Here the rod pointed\ndownwards. I have at different times found water, metals, lost metallic\narticles, and building-stone. The matter was known through the whole\nneighbourhood. When builders required water for new houses, when keys\nor money or other things had been lost, I was fetched, and if water or\nmetals were present where it was believed or desired, I was certain to be\nsuccessful. Sometimes the rod gave no indication, that is, it did not draw\nme, and did not move. I then said :\u2014\u2018 There is nothing here of what I am\nseeking.\u2019 If they still did not believe me and dug, they found nothing.\nFor the \ufb01rst few years I used to talk to the rod, and tell it what it was we\nwere asked to \ufb01nd. Later on I abandoned this. It was su\ufb02icient if I\n\ufb01rmly had in my mind what was to be sought for. If I sought for water, that\nis, if I had it strongly before me that it was water I was to seek for, and\n* Dr. D\u2019Outrepont gives this conversation at length, and in dialogue form;\nbecause, he says, the answers were so de\ufb01nite and circumstantial that they would lose\nin force and value as a mere narrative. But as more convenient for the present\npurpose, the replies are connected and condensed in the form of a statement.\u2014TR.\n\fJmm,1s99.] Contribution to History of Divining Rod. 85\nthere happened to be metal where I sought for water, the rod would\nindicate nothing, and vice versd. It was needful for me to have a \ufb01xed will,\nthen I found what I sought. Up to my thirteenth year, certainly, the rod\nnever deceived me, but after this, when I had partly lost my faith, it is\npossible that when the object sought for was present, no indication was\ngiven. Up to that time I had felt perfect con\ufb01dence, though that con\ufb01dence\nhad sometimes brought me much vexation.\n\u201cIn this way. My father made my ability to \ufb01nd water and metals a\nsource of income. He took me long rounds, and was handsomely remunerated.\nI did not like this at all. Such a gift of God 'should never be used for gain.\nBut it was my father\u2019s will, and I had to obey. Many people thought they\nhad hidden treasures, and got us to come and seek for them. Others thought\nthere was water, here or there. But when I found nothing, the people\nridiculed us, and gave us nothing, although myfather had lost his time.\nThey told me I had no sense, and that the rod was nothing but charlatanry.\nThis ill-treatment disconcerted me, and I lost my \ufb01rm faith.\n\u201cThe young people in the village would hide money, and say I should\nhave it if I found it. I wouldn\u2019t try. But sometimes, owing to their\npersistence, and mocking doubts of my power, I would seek and \ufb01nd what\nthey had hidden. Again, sometimes they would deceive me, and tell me\nthey had hidden a thing when they had not done so. Sometimes they would\nput money in trees, or in the upper parts of houses. In these cases I was\nunable to \ufb01nd it. At last, owing to ridicule and unfair requests, I refused\nto go on such errands with my father ; and when I discovered that I could\nnot \ufb01nd water or metals which were above me, I still further lost faith in\nthe infallibility of the rod ; and I did not feel like the same man.\n\u201c After this, I persuaded my father to alter his business arrangements,\nso that I had no occasion any longer to use the rod as a means of earning\nmoney, but only for the bene\ufb01t of my neighbours. I was, in particular,\nvery useful to my own family. My father, who found his house too small\nfor his large family, resolved to build another. I sought and found water\non a piece of land where water had never been found, and where no one\nsuspected its existence. This induced my father to buy it. Here it was\nthat, by means of the rod, I \ufb01rst found building-stone. My father found it\nwould be very expensive to bring stone from a distance. My brother and I\nbegged him not to build the house of wood. One morning I went over the\nground, and sought by means of the rod to \ufb01nd stone. At one particular\nspot the rod moved violently. I said to my father and brother, there is\nbound to be stone there. They dug down, and found the stone with which\nthe house was built at the exact depth I had named. This was the \ufb01rst time\nI had sought for and found anything except water and metal. It should be\nnoticed that where we found the building-stone, neither water nor metal were\npresent. Subsequently I found stone many times.\n\u201cI continued to use the rod occasionally till I was in my 31st year.\nMy wife had told me when I wanted to marry her, that, though with much\nregret, she could not consent unless I would promise entirely to relinquish\nits use. She looked upon it as a kind of witchcraft. I gave her the promise,\n\f86 J0-u\/rnal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jusr,1s99.\n.. T~\u2018_T_-f-\u2014--\u2014- --_._._\nand as an honourable man, kept my word. I have never used it since,\nthough I often look back with pleasure on the great amount of good I have\ndone by means of it.\n\u201c I never found that the season of the year, the day of the week, or the\nhour made any difference. I always used a forked hazel-rod. I do not\nknow whether any other shape would have done as well. Some people once\nbrought an old book to my father, in which there was a picture of a rod\nexactly like the one I used. It did not make any difference whether I or\nother people out the rod. When I cut it myself I always said :\u2014\u2018 Fasse le\nciel et la baguette.\u2019 Whether other people used these words I do not know,\nand whether they were necessary I do not know. I know that the result\nwas good, and so I continued the practice.\n\u201c The rod used to move in a circle, and when the object I sought lay in\nthe direction in which I was looking, the point of the rod moved towards\nthe direction, i.e., away from me. But if the object was behind me, the\npoint moved in the reverse direction, 1'-.e., towards me. It was very pretty\nto see. I would go several times across the spot where the water or the\nmetal was. The rod would gradually stand still and then turn itself in the\nopposite direction. The Violence of the motion was in proportion to the\nmass of the object sought. If, for instance, there was much water, it\nmoved quickly; if only a small quantity, the movement was slower. I\ncould not stop it, and if I held the rod \ufb01rmly with both hands it would\nbreak. It was this that so astonished the bystanders. But I rarely let this\nhappen, because it so affected my heart, making it beat violently as if I had\ncommitted a crime, and made me feel depressed all the rest of the day.\n\u201c When the rod moved I had a drawing feeling through both arms, which\nsometimes extended to the heart, but I could not say that it was either\npainful or disagreeable. I was often asked at what depth would the water\nbe found when its presence was indicated by the rod. I looked straight at\nthe rod, and it would make as many strokes downwards as the number of\nfeet at which the water would be found. It would strike violently down\u2014\nwards till it had indicated the depth at which the object sought for would\nbe found, and then raising itself up again would descend slowly by the\nforce of gravitation. This gave me great pleasure, and also excited great\nastonishment because, by digging, the water or metal was always found as I\nhad foretold.\u201d\nHere ended this interesting conversation. Every one who had known\nthis man, and had seen him at his work, con\ufb01rmed the truth of his state\nments. He spoke so ingenuously and with such simplicity, that it was\nimpossible not to feel great con\ufb01dence in him.\nOn my return through Cobleutz I told Councillor Dr. Wegeler the whole\nstory. We were in company with a merchant with whom Brayer had\ndone much business. A Mr. Gaufrei, who was also in the same trade, and\nupon whose testimony I can rely, assured us that he had many times seen\nBrayer seek for water and metal with the best results. I could not enter\ntain any doubt but that he had told me the simple truth.\n\fJcm, 1899.] Cases. 87\nCASES.\nM. Cl. 98.\nThe following case is communicated by Dr. Bringhurst, of\nNacogdoches, Texas, U.S.A. :\u2014\nFebruary 9th, 1899.\nWhile the circumstances herein related occurred long ago. they are among\nthe most vivid of the recollections of my youth; the witnesses were\nintelligent and competent, and no trick or deception was possible.\nI do not remember the year exactly, but it was about 1857 (spiritualism\nbeing then considerably talked about) that in the neighbourhood where I\nwas living,_in the state of Louisiana, we began to hear of table-rappings,\nand other manifestations, which were taking place at the houses of various\npeople. Now there lived in the neighbourhood a young woman of blameless\ncharacter, whose name was Miss Louisa L. She lives in the same parish of\nLouisiana to-day, and is married and teaching school. This Miss L. was\nthe \u201c medium \u201d in the neighbourhood. Much of her time was spent at the\nhome of an aunt of mine, still living, who can vouch for these statements.\nShe was also occasionally at my mother\u2019s house, and at that of my grand\nfather, a wealthy planter of that section. Miss L. was not a professional\n\u201c medium.\u201d . . .\nOne day this young lady, Miss L., was visiting at my grandfather\u2019s, and\na \u201cseance \u201d was held there. Quite a number were present. A message\nwas received, addressed to my grandfather, who just then did not happen to\nbe in the house. The wording of the message was to this effect : \u201c Do you\nremember when I went from the card table and committed suicide?\u201d The\nmessage was signed by a name totally unknown to anybody present. My\ngrandfather \ufb01nally came into the house, and was immediately shown the\ncommunication, and asked if he had known the author. He read it, and\nexclaimed in great astonishment and consternation, \u201cYes, by the Lord\nHarry! I knew him well.\u201d He then related how, very many years before\nthat time, he was travelling with the party whose name was signed to the\nmessage, on a Mississippi or Red River steamboat, and how, while a game of\ncards was going on, the said party went out and killed himself. Now the\n\u2018 \u2018medium\/\u2019 incontestably, had never heard of the man whose name was signed\nto the message, and he was unknown to any one in the house, except my\ngrandfather. It was plain to us all that no common agency was at the\nbottom of these remarkable \u201cmanifestations.\u201d\nI certify to the correctness of the foregoing, and beg to subscribe\nmyself, with great respect, your obedient servant,\nW.

[Jum:,18:\\9.\n1898), we extract the following primd fizcie case of double personality,\ncommunicated by Dr. W. L. Howard.\nMr. B., a respected business man; married and the father of three\nchildren. His position caused him to travel extensively in America\u2014from\nthe Paci\ufb01c to the Atlantic Oceans; from the Gulf of Mexico to Hudson\nBay. About ten years ago he commenced to go away from home without\ngiving any de\ufb01nite statement of where he was going or when he would\nreturn. Upon his return he would not, or could not, give any direct answer\nas to where he had been. On these occasions he appeared slightly dazed in\nmemory and intellect, and his appearance was that of a man who had aged\ngreatly from want of sleep. Two years ago, in the month of October, he\ndisappeared, and no trace of him could be found until he returned home on\nJanuary 14th. A man who knew him in his own city found him a month\nprior to this date conducting a country cross-roads store on the upper\nPotomac. He carried on business under the name of Simpson, and had been\nknown under this name since he had been in the village. He did not know\nhis former acquaintance, and the repeated mentioning of his true name,\n\u201cMr. B.,\u201d he at \ufb01rst took as a joke, then became indignant, and was so\npositive in stating that he was Simpson, giving his past history, stating he\nwas from Oregon, and going into full and complete details of his life and\nbusiness in that State, that the former friend went away fully convinced of\nhis mistaken identity.\nOne peculiarity Simpson, as we must now call him, had, was his passion\nfor \ufb01shing, giving, as one excuse why he had chosen to settle in the little\nvillage, the good bass \ufb01shing he could enjoy in the river. On the morning\nof January 14th he appeared at his own house, to the surprise and joy of\nhis family. He was Mr. B. again, but no questions as to his past where\nabouts could he answer. Only when he became convinced of the lapse of\ntime did he realise that something strange and abnormal had happened to\nhim. On account of the position he held, the family had kept the matter\nquiet, and as he was away from the city so frequently and for long periods\nhis business acquaintances were easily satis\ufb01ed with excuses. Worried over\nthe state of affairs, and appreciating his lapse of memory, his wife persuaded\nhim to consult me. In his normal condition I could elicit no information,\nyet he did his best to aid me. His memory of the last three months was a\nblank, and he was pitiably nervous and worried. Without much di\ufb02iculty\nhe was hypnotised, and through tentative suggestions he gradually veered\naround to his other personality. He said, when I suggested his name was\nunknown to me and he must tell me, \u201cD\u2014n it! you know my name is\nSimpson; what do you want to bother me about it for? You remember\nthat, or else I don\u2019t take you \ufb01shing.\u201d\n\u201c Well, Mr. Simpson, let's go \ufb01shing.\u201d\n\u201c All right ; wait till the boy comes back and I will close up the store.\u201d\n\u201c By the way, Mr. Simpson, how far is it to the city ? \u201d\n\u201c Oh, about forty miles.\u201d\nBy this manner of questioning Mr. Simpson, I found where the body of\n\fJuNE,1899.] 4 \u201cSounds from the Un7mown.\u201d 89\nMr. B. had been. The next day I hunted up Mr. Simpson\u2019s store, and\nfound, indeed, that such an individual existed in the life of the village.\nSubsequent investigations cleared the whole matter satisfactorily, as far as\nMr. Simpson was concerned.\n\u201cSOUNDS FROM THE UNKNOWN.\u201d\nFrom an article in Psychische Studien, February, 1899.\nTranslated by EDWARD T. BENNETT.\nUnder this title the following account appears in Psychische\nStudicn for February, 1899, p. 112. It is taken from the Sunday\nSupplement of No. 580, Vol. for 1898, of the Rez'chsher0ld, edited by Dr.\nBiickel, at Marburg. John Henry von Thiinen, who was born on June\n24th, 1783, at Kanarienshausen, in Jeverland, is stated to have been a\nprominent land owner and agriculturalist, aman of considerable mental\npower, the writer of various books, especially of a standard work\nentitled Der Isolirte Staat und seine Gesetze. In his letters Thiinen\nis said to exhibit himself as a man of thorough sincerity, noble\ndisposition, and elevated character. Thiinen had three sons, the\nsecond of whom, Alexander, his favourite child, died in the year 1831,\nat the age of seventeen. The following is an extract from a letter\nto his friend Christian von Buttel in reference to this loss, which\nhe felt greatly.\n\u201cIn the night between the 10th and 11th of October, three days after\nAlexander\u2019s death, my wife and I were awake between two and three o\u2019clock.\nMy wife asked me if I did not hear the distinct sound of a bell. I listened,\nand heard such a sound, but put it down to a delusion of the senses. The\nfollowing night we were again awake at the same hour, and heard the same\nsounds, but more clearly and distinctly. We both compared them to the\nstriking of a bell which was de\ufb01cient in melody, but in the reverberation of\nwhich there was music. We listened long. I asked my wife to point in\nthe direction from which the music seemed to come, and when she indicated\nexactly the same spot from which I seemed to hear it, it almost took my\nbreath away. My two sons, in spite of all their e\ufb01'orts, heard nothing. The\nsame thing was repeated during the following nights. A few days later I heard\nthe music in the evening, but it died away towards midnight, beginning\nagain soon after 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. On October 18th, Alex-ander\u2019s\nbirthday, the music was particularly beautiful and harmonious. My wife\nfound it extremely soothing and strengthening. But to me the feeling of\nrest which it produced was only transient. The uncertainty whether it was\na reality or only a delusion of the senses continually disturbed me, and the\nendeavour to arrive at a conclusion kept me in a constant state of strain.\nFor more than four weeks my sleep at night was so broken that I became\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Resecwch. [Juxm, 1899.\nquite worn out. I used carefully to listen if I could detect any connection\nbetween the beating of my pulse and the time of the music, but could \ufb01nd\nnone. In the course of these four weeks the character of the music greatly\nchanged ; it became much stronger, so that it was audible in the midst of all\nkinds of noises, and was a hindrance to my reading and writing in the evenings.\nBut as it grew stronger, the beautiful harmony diminished, and at this time\nwe could only compare it to the sound produced by a number of bells.\nclanging simultaneously. At last even my wife wished it would cease, as the\nclanging shook our nerves and greatly affected them. In the middle of\nNovember entire silence ensued, neither my wife nor myself hearing the\nleast sound.\n\u201c Now the doubt again arose whether this music of the spheres had not\nbeen only a result of our excited state of mind and feeling. My wife felt\nsad and melancholy. But again after about eight days the music began,\nvery gently at \ufb01rst, and continued until Christmas. On Christmas Eve it\nsounded with unusual strength, clear and melodious, and with a force and\nvariety of expression we had never before experienced. After Christmas it again\nceased. On New Year\u2019s Eve we listened in vain, and this silence continued\nthrough most of January. My wife and I had now heard the music, both when\nwe were cheerful and when we were depressed, both when we were ill and\nwhen we were well. It always came in the same manner, and apparently\nfrom the same direction. It was not possible for us any longer to entertain a\ndoubt as to its reality. At this time we thought it had entirely departed.\nHowever, at the end of January it began again, but entirely changed in\ncharacter. The sounds of bells had gone, and tones of \ufb02utes took their place.\nAt the beginning of March the music was remarkably loud and harmonious,\nbut the tones of the \ufb02ute had now vanished again, and we could only\ncompare it to the singing of a choir with musical accompaniment. At one\ntime, we both thought,\u2014though only for a moment\u2014that we could\ndistinguish words. On March 21st, my wife\u2019s birthday, the music\nassumed once more a di\ufb02ierent character, beautiful, but at the same\ntime almost fearful. We were neither of us able to compare it with any\nthing earthly.\"\nHere the extract from J. H. von Thiinen\u2019s letter ends. The\nfollowing paragraph is added in Psychische Studien, apparently taken\nfrom his biography :\u2014\n\u201cThis wonderful music was often heard subsequently, especially on\nfamily anniversaries. It did not cease, even after the death of the wife,\nbut continued as a faithful and loving companion through the lives of both\nHerr and Frau von Thiinen.

But Dr. Wallace\nwould no doubt admit that Hahn\u2019s evidence\u2014however good it may be as it\nstands \u2014would have been better if it had been given contemporaneously. My\nown view is that, in that case, though evidentially better, it might probably\nnot have seemed to Dr. Wallace so well-adapted for his purpose.\nBut perhaps I may be allowed to complete my answer to Dr. Wallace by\ncontinuing the examination of the nine cases cited by him. I will take them\nin order.\n(4) Bealings Bells. \u2014The evidence is \ufb01rst-hand ; it is practically con\ntemporaneous, being based on notes made at the time, and written out in\nfull within a day or two at most ; the witness is a Fellow of the Royal\nSociety, who records with scrupulous care the atmospheric conditions, the\nreadings of barometer and thermometer; and points out with justice that\nthe phenomena cannot be explained by \u201cthe known laws of the electric\ntheory \u201d or the expansion of metals by rise of temperature. And yet, as a\nwitness, Major Moor shows himself on a level with the servant girl who\nhas her fortune told by the cards.\nOn February 5th, 1834,\u2014that is, three days after the bell-ringing began,\n\u2014he writes :\u2014\u201c I am thoroughly convinced that the ringing is by no human\nagency\u201d (p. 5).\nNo reason is given for this conviction.\nOn February 27th he writes :\u2014\u2018\u2018It is possible\u201d that it is all due to\ntrickery (p. 9).\nNo reason is given for the change of opinion.\nA few days later (p. 22) he repeats his conviction that the bells \u201cwere\nnot rung by any mortal hand.\u201d\nNo new facts had come to light in the interval and no reasons are given\nfor this second change of opinion.\nAgain, though devoting many pages to describing the courses and the\nattachments of the wires, the state of the weather and so on, Major Moor\nnever tells us of whom his household consisted and never describes a single\noccasion on which, when they were all gathered together in his presence, the\nbel1~ringing occurred. Further, a writer in the Ipswich Journal made the\nsensible suggestion that Major Moor should begin his investigations by\ngathering all his household into one room and posting trustworthy friends\nround about the house. Major Moor, in quoting the letter, adds, \u201cI did\nnot in any way follow the advice therein offered.\u201d\nI venture to suggest, as a plausible theory, that Major Moor, in homely\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Juss, 1899.\nphrase, \u201c was not such a fool as he looks ; \u201d and that his book is a gentle\nsatire on those who were ready, on such evidence as that here offered, to\nbelieve in supernormal or even unfamiliar agencies.\n(5) The Baldarroch (Banchory) distm~bances.\u2014Mackay does not quote any\nauthority for his statements : his account is therefore at best second-hand,\nand may be still more remote. But if such evidence is good at all, I submit\nthat it is good all round. Mackay tells us not only that stones and crockery\nwere thrown about, but that several ricks danced about the farmyard. and\nthat the Devil was seen sitting on the top of the house.\n(6) Mary Jobson. of Simderland.\u2014Dr. Wallace says that Dr. Reid Clanny\n\u201c published an account of the extraordinary things witnessed by himself, and\nalso by three other medical men and other persons, sixteen in all.\u201d\nDr. Clanny himself neither saw nor heard anything of the alleged\nphenomena.* Of the \ufb01ve medical men, besides Dr. Clanny, mentioned\nby name as having visited the girl during her illness, two only have given\nan account of what they witnessed. Both these, Mr. R. B. Embleton\nand Mr. Drury, were young men. Neither of them saw anything\nout of the way; but both heard knocks and loud scratchings\u2014\napparently on the foot of the wooden bedstead in which the\nchild of 12 lay. Dr. Drury also, calling on the child after her recovery,\nheard at her suggestion very beautiful music, and Mr. Embleton was\nspecially invited to hear \u201c the voice.\u201d [There is no suggestion, on the part\nof the medical witnesses, that \u201c the voice \u201d did not proceed from the child\u2019s\nown vocal organs] The voice, which Mr. Embleton describes as realising\nhis ideas of angelic sweetness, dictated as follows :\u2014\u201cI am the Lord thy\nGod that brought thee out of the land of Egypt, etc. . . . I am the\nphysician of the Soul. This is a miracle wrought on earth . . . Mark, I am\nthy God sounding out of the Heavens,\u201d etc., etc. The knocks, the throwing\nabout of water, the painting on the ceiling, and so on, which are described\nby the other eleven witnesses [there are thirteen \ufb01rst hand witnesses only]\nall of whom were apparently uneducated and superstitious neighbours, appear\nto me simply the puerile trickeries of a hysterical girl. Her ailment, which\nba\ufb02led all the physicians (or rather the three physicians who have\nwritten about the case), was as obviously hysterical as the \u201c voices\u201d\nwere obviously blasphemous. The cure was as mysterious as the disease.\nAfter eight months of dropsy and convulsions (Dr. Embleton), brain disease\n(Dr. Clanny), intolerable torture (all the witnesses), she suddenly turned\nher sympathising relatives out of the room, dressed herself in a quarter of an\nhour, and was completely restored to health. I cannot help thinking that\nDr. Clanny\u2019s enthusiastic belief in the genuineness of the case was largely\ndue to the fact that the girl (amongst whose affable spirits were the Virgin\nMary and a large circle of apostles and martyrs) told him that his name had\n* Dr. Wallace may perhaps have been misled by W. Howitt, who writes (History\nof the Supernutwral. Vo1. IL, p. 450), \u201cDr. Clanny saw and heard various striking\nphenomena in her presence.\u201d But Dr. Clanny himself saw nothing, and only heard\nsome knocks in his bedroom, not demonstrably connected with the girl at all, which\noccurred weeks after the phenomena in her presence had ceased.\n\fJmm, 1899.] Correspondence. 93\nbeen favourably mentioned to her at different times by Jesus Christ, St. Paul,\nand St. Peter. Dr. Clanny quotes this amazing statement in all seriousness.\n(7) The Disturbances at Ai'ensburg.\u2014As Dr. Wallace tells us, the facts\nwere communicated * to Dale Owen by M\\\\9 de Guldenstubb\u00e9 and her\nbrother. They had heard them from the late Baron. The account, as it\nreaches us, is therefore third-hand. Neither Dale Owen nor his informants\nprofess to have seen the documents which constitute the strength of the\nevidence. Until we have a certi\ufb01ed copy of those documents, the case,'I\nsubmit, is not before the court.\n(8) Stone-throwing in Paris.\u2014The evidence in this case consists of an\naccount drawn up for the Gazette des T*ri'b1ma:wc by a writer who does not give\nhis name and who does not profess to have been an eye-witness of tlie events.\nFrom the appearance of this anonymous account in a seinto\ufb01\"1cial organ [for\nthe Gazette is not, I understand, strictly speaking an otlicial publication], it\nis perhaps safe to infer that the stones were thrown and that the police were\npuzzled. So far the evidence is good. But we should not be justi\ufb01ed in\ninferring anything else.\n(9) The distm'b(mces in Cideville.\u2014This is, on the face of it, the most\npromising, with the exception of the Wesley case, of all the narratives cited\nby Dr. Wallace. The witnesses\u2014a Marquis, the local Mayor, the Cur\u00e9,\nvarious gentry from neighbouring chftteaux, etc.\u2014were numerous, respect\nable, and may be presumed to have been intelligent; they gave their evidence\nwhilst the disturbances were still proceeding ; and, lastly, most of them\ngave it with all due formality in a Court of Law. Unfortunately I have not\nseen a copy of the original depositions, which were printed and circulated in\n1852 by the Marquis de Mirville. De Mirville does not reprint them in his\nbook \u201cDes Esprits.\u201d He contents himself there with a summary, given in\nhis own words, without full details of place, time or circumstances. Nor is\nthe character of De Mirville\u2019s account\u2014an excited and incoherent jumble of\nfragments of evidence, interspersed with rhetorical appeals to the unbelievers\n\u2014at all calculated to inspire con\ufb01dence in his competence as a reporter.\nDale Owen\u2019s account of the matter, which is based on the actual depositions\ncontained in De Mirville\u2019s earlier pamphlet, is more valuable. But the\ntestimony, as Dale Owen presents it, is not only translated, but very much\nabridged. The case is a very curious and interesting one; but unless the\noriginal documents can be referred to (perhaps Dr. Wallace can say whether\nDe Mirville's pamphlet is still accessible) it would be scarcely pro\ufb01table to\ndiscuss it at length. The case, as far as can be judged, is of the usual type\n\u2014movements of furniture and small objects, and various noises, and, in\nparticular, raps which answered questions. The whole of the phenomena\noccurred, it would seem, generally, if not exclusively, in the presence of two\nsmall boys, and ceased entirely with their removal.\nI am sorry to \ufb01nd that I had not made my argument clear to Mrs.\nBarker : and I am the more sorry because I can see that the fault is partly\nmy own.

[Jmm, 1599.\nthe conclusion that the Epworth disturbances were caused by Miss Hetty\nWesley. The evidence is hardly su\ufb01cient to justify that conclusion : nor is\nthat conclusion necessary to the argument. If, indeed, I were required to\nspecify the agency in the Epworth knockings, I should say that on the\nevidence before us the most probable explanation is that Hetty VVesley\ncaused them : that she caused them deliberately : and that she caused them\nby the exertion of her proper muscular powers, without assistance from dis\nembodied spirits, or even from pseudopodia, odylic force, astral emanations,\nor other supernormal supplement.\nBut on the evidence in this particular case, Hetty\u2019s agency in the matter\nis, at most, probable. What seems to me, however, practically certain, on\nan analysis and comparison of all the cases which I have yet examined, is\nthat Hetty, or some other human girl or boy, without metaphysical aid of\nany kind, has been the sole agent in all such disturbances. I am led to that\nconclusion\u2014reluctantly, and against my own preconceived beliefs\u2014by two\nmain lines of argument :\u2014\n(1) We have positive evidence that in some cases tricky little girls or\nboys have thrown about the less expensive crockery and upset the kitchen\nfurniture with their own carnal hands, whilst the onlookers have accepted\nthe portent as a manifestation of supernormal powers.\n(2) We have, speaking broadly, no evidence (and by \u201cno evidence\u201d I\nmean no good evidence: and by \u201cgood evidence\u201d I mean evidence from\ncompetent witnesses, at \ufb01rst-hand, and written down within a few hours of\nthe events) for anything having been done which could not have been done\nby a girl or boy of slightly more than the average naughtiness.\n(3) As asubsidiary argument, I \ufb01nd, in the few cases where the records\nare su\ufb02iciently full to admit of such a comparison being madc, that when\nsecond-hand accounts and \ufb01rst-hand accounts of the same incidents are\ncompared : or when accounts written down at the time are compared with\naccounts written down long afterwards ; or accounts given by an excitable\nand ignorant witness with those of an educated and competent observer;\nthat the marvellous features which appear in the one set of reports are\nalmost or altogether wanting in the other.\nNow the peculiar value of the Wesley records, as I pointed out. lies in\ntheir fulness; we have the (unfortunately very rare) opportunity of seeing\nthe same incident described by different persons\u2014by the person who\nwitnessed it, and by the persons who only heard of it : we are also able to\ncompare different versions of the same incident given by the actual witness\nshortly after the event, and at an interval of many years.\nI have endeavoured to show that, while in the earlier \ufb01rst-hand accounts\nthere is nothing inexplicable by trickery, in the second-hand and later \ufb01rst\nhand accounts the mythopoeic faculty has been at work, and has so magni\ufb01ed\nand distorted the facts as to make them seem inexplicable.\nWhen any records can be produced as full as those in the Wesley case,\nand pointing to some supernormal agency as conclusively as these point to\ntrickery and the fallacy of human memories, it will be time to consider\nseriously the question of the Poltergeist.\nFRANK PomuoEE.\n\fJmm, 1899.] Cowespondence. 95\nON DRsAns oF FLYING.\nTour de Peilz, Vaud, April 19th, 1899.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014I wish you would open an inquiry on a subject which I think\ninteresting, viz., the habit of dreaming that one can \ufb02y.\nI have been a prey to that pleasant delusion ever since my childhood.\nThe \ufb01rst occasion which I can go back to in my memory is one that I have\ngood reason to remember, as it nearly made a cripple of me for life.\nI was seven years old. I had dreamt that I had discovered in me that\ndelightful power of \ufb02ying about like one of the sparrows that I used to feed\nwith the crumbs of my breakfast. The dream was so vivid that I woke up\nin the morning shouting: \u201cHow jolly! I can \ufb02y.\"\nIn my eagerness to experiment on my newly found powers I rushed out of\nbed, got upon a high sideboard and jumped head foremost into space . . .\nto \ufb01nd myself, soon after, lying bruised and half crazy with fright on the\n\ufb02oor.\nI was, of course, for ever cured of attempting such feats; but I have\nnever since ceased to dream the same dream from time to time, say once or\ntwice every month. I was speaking of sparrows ; do not conclude therefrom\nthat I had, either in my dream or after, tried to \ufb02y with my arms used\ninstead of wings. Whenever I have that dream, I go through space\nwithout any motion of the limbs, only by an effort of will continually\nreproduced as long as I want to stand in mid air.\nFor instance, I dream that I am walking along the street. All at once,\nI seem to feel that power rising in me, and I say to myself, \u201cThis time I am\nnot dreaming ;\u201d and exercising at once that power, I take leave of the ground\nand begin to soar upwards, sometimes over walls and houses, very gently,\nimpelled forward by a mere volition.\nOr I dream that I am in my study, writing at my desk. Something stirs\nwithin me. \u201cNow, I am sure I can do it ! \u201d\u2014and then, getting up from my\nchair, to be sure, I begin to roam about the room half way between the \ufb02oor\nand the ceiling, with a delight that is not to be expressed in words. But\nsoon, feeling the want of more space for my evolutions, I open the window,\nand issuing gently from the room I start for. the open country over hedges\nand trees. Finally I cease to dream, but without waking up, and it is only\nin the morning when I get up, that I remember, with a sigh, my fancied\npowers.\nI have sometimes spoken to friends about it and asked them for their\nexperience. Some knew nothing of that kind of dream. Others knew about\nit; and when I inquired fart-her\u2014was it by a \ufb02apping of the arms that they\nfancied themselves able to \ufb02y, or how ?\u2014they have invariably answered that\nit was, like myself, by a mere volition.\nWhat may be the cause of that ever-recurring dream?\nA medical friend answered at once: \u201cDigestion. When you feel that you\ncan \ufb01y, it is simply that your stomach having completed its work, a feeling\nof relief gives you that buoyancy and delusion.\u201d As I have never known\nwhere my stomach is, nor ever felt that I had one, I \ufb01nd it hard to accept\nthis medical theory.\n\f96 Journal of Society for 138;:\/chical Research.

Have I been a bird in some remote age of the world, long before our\nspecies developed into human beings? I think not. It is by the \ufb02apping of\ntheir wings that birds \ufb02y; and in my dream both legs and arms remain\nperfectly motionless.\nDoes my spirit come out of my body and soar unfettered into the air?\nNo, because I should have the impression that I depart from the body, and\nperhaps see it behind me. And on the contrary it is I in the body that go\nabout at will in opposition to the laws of gravitation.\nIs there, dormant in us, a power which shall develop one day the faculty\nof progressing through space at will by a mere volition?

GLARDoN.\nA CAse oF TRIPLE PERsoNALITY.\nSIR,\u2014\u2014-The paper by Dr. Morton Prince, entitled as above, and read by\nMr. Myers at the last meeting of the S.P.R., is both interesting and sugges\ntive, but makes one regret that the doctor did not pursue the matter a little\nfurther, or conduct his experiments a little differently. Dr. Prince is\npresumably experienced in the practice of hypnotism, and it would be\nuseful to know whether, as a- rule, his subjects split up under hypnotism\ninto one, two, or more personalities? Man is undoubtedly a far more\nintricate piece of mechanism than commonly supposed, but he is probably\nmade alike all the world over, and a process which disintegrates the\npersonality in one case might be expected to do so in all cases. Is this,\ntherefore, the rule or the exception ? Do hypnotised subjects usually speak\nof themselves as \u201cI,\u201d \u201che,\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d? Dr. Prince apparently believes\nin the three in one, since he enumerates X 1, X 2, and X 3. When X 3\nappeared\u2014\ufb02ippant, merry, and mischievous, utterly unlike X 1 and 2,\nwhy was she not asked, \u201c Who are you ? \u201d \u201c What is your name ? \u201d Had\nshe replied, \u201cI am X, of course,\u201d Dr. Prince\u2019s theory would have gained\nsome amount of con\ufb01rmation; while if, on the other hand, X 3 had\ndeclared herself to be a totally distinct person, some other explanation\nwould have been needed. Perhaps Dr. Prince will have something more to\ntell us presently, and the experience of other hypnotists may serve to\nelucidate the truth.\nE. BRoWNE.\nApril 29th, 1899.\n\fNo. CLXI.\u2014VoL. IX.

' 99'\ndown in his name would be deferred. Mr. Podmore also, who had\noffered to read a paper, was ill ; but his paper would be read by Mr.\nMyers, who would also bring some other matter before the meeting.\nMR. F. \u2018V. H. MrERs prefaced his reading of certain cases with\na few words to the following elTect:\u2014I appear as the stop-gap of a\nstop-gap. In the \ufb01rst place, Professor Barrett had promised for this\nmeeting the conclusion of his long and exhaustive discussion of the\nDivining Rod; but an attack of in\ufb02uenza and its consequences have\nobliged him to take a sea voyage for the recovery of health, and his\npaper is inevitably postponed to the autumn. Mr. Podmore then\nkindly consented to read a paper in place of Professor Barrett\u2019s\u2014a\npaper on \u201cSpeaking with Tongues \u201d\u2014but an attack of in\ufb02uenza has\nunfortunately prevented Mr. Podmore also for the present from\nspeaking at length in any tongue whatever. I am presently to read\nhis paper in the author\u2019s place.\nIt seems well to take this opportunity to bring before the Society\nseveral brief cases, which might otherwise have been crowded out,\nbut which all possess a real interest, whether of a negative or of a\npositive kind. It is hardly needful to repeat that the object of the\nSociety is the attainment of knowledge, not the establishment of any\nspecial set of views, and that, just because the positive evidence grows\nstronger and stronger, it becomes more possible and more interesting\nto draw the dividing line between phenomena which do actually point\nto some supernormal faculty and phenomena which may indeed be\nperfectly genuine, but which attest either actual disturbance of\nmental balance or else some obscure psychological process which only\nsimulates, without truly indicating, the phenomena of telepathy, or\nof clairvoyance, or of spirit-possession. I do not say that we should\nattempt to deal with actual insanity; but, short of insanity, there\nare many phenomena, such as those with which Mr. Podmore\u2019s paper\ndeals, which we ought, I think, to discuss with care, and not without\nhope of \ufb01nding in their mechanism something which, while it may\nillustrate the processes of insanity on the one hand, illustrates also\nthe processes of supernormal mentation on the other.\nThe \ufb01rst case read was contributed by Mr. Coghill, and described\nthe disappearance of warts on certain horses and cows, following on a\nso-called treatment by prayer or incantation. [This case is printed in\nfull below.] It seemed equally di\ufb02icult to refer these disappearances\nto chance, to suggestion, or to any power of actual healing touch.\nMR. GILBERT ELLIoT (of Tednambury), referring to the cure of\nwarts on animals, said that he had had considerable experience with\nhorses, and he did not think \u201csuggestion\u201d could apply to them at\n\f100_ W Journal of Society for Psych\/Lcal Research.

In June, when\nthe \ufb02ies commenced, I could not take him out, they would almost set him\nmad, and my groom persuaded me to let John Kane, a man who lives neRr,\ntake them off. He got him to go over the horse one morning, about June\n20th. That evening I looked at him. The large warts that had been\ncontinually bleeding had dried up, and some of the smaller ones had quite\ndisappeared. In a week they were all gone, except about four. He came\nagain, and in another week they were all gone but one, a very large one it\nwas, but it had dried up to about the size of a blackbird\u2019s egg. I sold the\nhorse on July 17th. The man who got him told me that one dropped off\nbefore a week. No vet. ever saw the horse during the time I had him,\nwhich was about a year. He had a few warts on him when I bought him.\nA herd of mine had a cow. Her spins were covered with warts. The same\nman took them off in a few days. \u2014Yours very truly, B_ W_ PARR_\nIn a letter written on November 9th, 1896, Mr. Coghill says :\u2014\n\u201cThere is a man I know of who has some very bad warts on his\nhands, and I will try to induce him to undergo the same charm. If I\ncan get him to consent to do so, I will photograph his hands before\nand after, and will also get it duly certi\ufb01ed by the local doctor.\u201d\nOn January 13th, 1897, Mr. Coghill writes thus concerning this\ncase :\u2014\nAthboy, Co. Meath, Jammry 13th, 1897.\nDEAR SIR, \u2014'.[\u2018he cure in this case, unfortunately, is not so rapid, but\nfrom the time of going to this man it has progressed in an interesting\nmanner. There was at once an improvement visible in many of the warts,\nand a number of the smaller ones disappeared altogether. A fairly large\none, in photo, on the second \ufb01nger, has now entirely disappeared. The large\nones on the third and little \ufb01nger are greatly reduced, and show distinct signs\nof falling off. This is strange, as all other warts I have seen treated by\nKane have gradually disappeared.\nI remarked to the subject about a crack visible round the big warts, and\nhe told me that Kane told him on his \ufb01rst visit that all the warts would\ndisappear with the exception of these two large ones, which he foretold\nwould drop off.\nThe cure in this case is a very severe test, as, owing to the subject\nsuffering from blood poisoning in his hand, he has for some months past been\napplying an ointment, which apparently stimulated the growth of the warts\nprior to undergoing Kane\u2019s treatment. The subject tells me that he has\ncontinued using this ointment, and has used no care in avoiding applying\nsame to the warts, and that Kane told him that it was probably due to this\n\f102 Jo-wwnal of Society for Psychicai Resemrch. [Jun 1899.\nfact that the warts had not disappeared before now, as he never before had\nso tedious a case.\nI have now asked him to forego using the ointment in the vicinity of the\nwarts, and when next reporting I will let you know whether this makes any\nmaterial change in the rapidity of the cure.\nThere are a number of good-sized warts between the little \ufb01nger and third\n\ufb01nger which do not show in the photo. Some of the spots on the back of\nthe hand may have been freckles, but of this I am not certain.\u2014Yours truly\nO. P. CoGHILL.\nThe photograph referred to, sent to us with this letter, fully bears\nout Mr. Coghill\u2019s description.\nIn a letter written on February 19th, 1897, Mr. Coghill regrets\nthat he had had no opportunity of taking another photograph, as he\ndid not often see the man.\nIn response to a recent letter of inquiry as to whether he had\nanything further of interest to communicate, Mr. Coghill has very\nkindly written the following letter :\u2014\nEstate O\ufb02ice, Athhoy, Co. Meath, October 24th, 1898.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014. . . I now enclose two letters from two most reliable\nmen. One is signed by John McKenna, a member of Royal Irish Con\nstabulary Force. On reading it over, I notice that he omitted to mention\nthat he had also a wart on his head which caused him great annoyance when\ncombing his hair and which was charmed at same time as the one on his hand,\nthe result in both cases being perfectly satisfactory; both warts disappeared\nin or about same time.\nThe second letter is from a very respectable shopkeeper in the town and\nspeaks for itself. The man whose hand I photographed has been completely\ncured, and there is now not a vestige of warts on the hand. I will on the\n\ufb01rst opportunity take another photo, and forward it to you. I may mention\nin this case that although from the very \ufb01rst there was a marked diminution\nof warts, still it took some four or \ufb01ve months before the last of them\ndisappeared. Kane accounted for this, whether rightly or wrongly, from\nfact that,owing to blood-poisoning in the hand, there was very bad circulation,\nand also that an ointment which he was using, by the doctor's directions, for\nblood-poisoning, was detracting from the cure.\nI have not seen, since I wrote to you last, the man who was suffering\nfrom what appeared to be cancer, but I understood from Kane that he has\nfailed to make a complete cure in this case, although there was a most\nwonderfully marked improvement during the time he was visiting him.\nKane accounts for the failure on account of the man\u2019s intemperate habits,\nand states that he \ufb01nally told the man that it was useless for him to come\nto him any more unless he gave up using alcohol.\nDuring the past year I have myself had two opportunities to judge of the\nreality of the charm, as he has completely cured for me a heifer which had\nvery bad warts on her spins, prior to calving. So bad were they that my man\nin charge of cows feared that she would never allow herself to be milked.\n\fJun, 1899.] The Cure of Warts by Su_gg_estioaa T1_03\nI immediately sent for Kane, who succeeded by means of his charm in\nremoving the principal ones before calving, and the remainder fell off very\nshortly after.\nThe second case was on a bullock, which was the worst case I ever saw of\nwarts, and one which, in spite of all I heard and knew of Kane, I believed to\nbe beyond his powers. There was a bunch of warts, as large as my two lists,\nhanging from under the belly within a few inches of the ground. There\nwere also a number of warts round the eyes. From the day Kane \ufb01rst began.\nthe warts for the \ufb01rst time showed distinct signs of shrivelling. It took\nbetween two or three months before the last of them \ufb01nally disappeared. I\nwas very sorry afterwards that I did not take a photo before he began, but\nI looked upon it as such a hopeless case that I did not think it worth while.\nIn conclusion, I may mention that under the promise of strictest secrecy\nhe has con\ufb01ded to me the charm, which is in the nature of a prayer.\nI must confess to my having attempted several cases without success,\nand which he attributes to want of faith on my part. I certainly admit that\nI was unable to feel any faith in my own power while making the attempt,\nbut my own opinion is that the man has some inherited power of healing by\ntouch. I am absolutely certain that he uses no drug of any kind.\nI think in my previous letter I mentioned that his father had the same\npower.\u2014Yours faithfully, Q R CoGHILL\nThe following are the two enclosures Mr. Coghill refers to :\u2014\nAthboy, Co. Meath, January 30th, 1897.\nC. P. CoGHILL, EsQ.,\u2014SIR,\u2014.-is you have expressed a desire to be\nfurnished with particulars relative to the cure of a wart which I had on my\nhand, I beg to submit the following facts regarding the same.\nThe wart referred to has been on the knuckle joint of my right hand for\nabout three years. It being in so remarkable a place, and having grown to\na pretty large size that I was extremely anxious to have it removed, I showed\nit to different medical men and chemists, who in their turn applied caustic\nand several other cures, but all of no use, as the wart appeared to grow\nlarger until it was the size of a pea. At last I gave up the idea of trying to\nhave it removed by caustic, etc. One day a friend observed the wart, and\nadvised me to show it to Mr. John Kane, Mooneystown, Athboy, who, it was\nstated, possessed a cure or charm for warts. Out of curiosity I showed the\nwart to him, he looked at it, and gave the wart a rub of his hand, told me to\ncome again. I visited him once a week for four weeks. At the end of this\ntime there were visible signs of the wart disappearing ; by degrees it\neventually went, and I am now indebted to the kindness of Mr. Kane for\nhaving no wart at all. There is no sign on the place where the wart was,\nmore than on any other part of the hand. These are the full and true facts\nof the case.\nConstable Joseph Chambers is within the knowledge of these facts, as he\naccompanied me to Mr. Kane on each of the four occasions. He also saw\nthe caustic applied with no results.\u2014I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\nJoHN McKRmu.\n\f1044 Journal of Society for Psycluical Reseu\/rah. [Jun, 1899.\nAthboy, March 27th, 1897.\nC. P. CoGHILL,\u2014DEAR Sm,\u2014In September last I had a heifer cow timed\nto calve November 1st.

Dream.\nThe following account of a veridical dream was sent to Mr. Myers\nby a member of the S.P.R., Mr. Donald Murray, Editor of the Sydney\nMorning Herald, in a letter dated Sydney, New South Wales,\nJuly 18th, 1898. Mr. Murray sent a complete set of newspaper\ncuttings relating to the shipwreck, etc., but his own account here\nprinted gives the essential details, and he has spared no pains in\ncollecting not only all the available evidence with regard to the dream,\nbut\u2014what is of equal importance\u2014as much information as possible\nabout the various circumstances, which is indispensable for judging\nhow far a genuine telepathic faculty was invol\"ed in it.\nTHE \u201cATACAMA\u201d SHIPwRuCK DREAM.\nTowards the end of 1897 a Chilian ship named the Atacama, a wooden\nvessel of 1,298 tons gross register, came to Sydney, New South Wales, in a\nleaky condition, and was purchased by Messrs. Cowlishaw Brothers for \u00a3700.\nThe ship was repaired at a cost of about \u00a31,500, sent to Newcastle, New\nSouth Wales, by her new owners and loaded with 1,700 tons of coal, and she\nsailed for San Diego, in Southern California, on January 29th, 1898.\nOn February 6th, when about 540 miles out from Sydney, a good deal of\nwater was found in the well, and as the barometer was falling rapidly\nCaptain Spruit, the master of the vessel, decided to return to port, and\nsteered for Sydney. Heavy weather was encountered, and though the\npumps were all kept going, the water gained steadily till Wednesday,\nFebruary 9th. By four p.m. on Wednesday, February 9th, there were eleven\nfeet of water in the well, and at six p.m. on the same day it was decided to\nabandon the vessel, and the boats were launched. There were three of\nthese. The \ufb01rst was a 24-foot life-boat. In this were Captain Spruit, able\nseaman Pinto, steward Sheiner, boatswain Figuero (or Figuaro) and appren\n\fJuLY, 1899.] Case. 105\ntice Allen (aged 16). The rest of the crew [twelve in number] were in the\ntwo other boats in charge of the \ufb01rst and second mates. The boats stood\nby the ship all night, and at daylight on Thursday morning, February 10th,\n1898, they set sail for Sydney.\nOn Saturday, February 12th, high winds were encountered. During the\nafternoon the wind increased, and early in the evening of Saturday a heavy\nsea swamped the Captain\u2019s boat, which shortly afterwards capsized, and the\nboy Allen was drowned. The boat righted itself, and the Captain, who could\nnot swim, and the crew scrambled on board again and spent the night in\nthe boat full of water, in a hurricane, and some 300 miles from land. Next\nday there was a furious gale and a high sea. Captain Spruit was washed out\nof the boat and rescued either by Figuero or by Sheiner. On the 14th the\nsame conditions prevailed. The boat remained full of water with a high\nsea and a heavy gale. The other two boats disappeared during the night.\nOn the 15th and 16th the weather improved, and the crew succeeded in\nbaling the water out of the boat. Sail was set shortly after sunrise on\nFebruary 16th, and the ship Industrie, damaged by the hurricane, was\nsighted, and a tug-boat, the Leveret, from Sydney, came up to them and took\nthem on board about 35 miles outside of Sydney Heads. When rescued\nCaptain Spruit and his three companions were in the last stages of exhaus\ntion from fatigue, exposure, and want of food. Their arrival caused a great\nsensation in Sydney, and the newspapers were full of particulars of the\ndisaster and interviews with the survivors.\nAccompanying this account I forward a copy of the Sydney 1l[0rm'ng\nHerald, giving full details of the loss of the Atacama, with statements by\nthe survivors. From this account it will be seen that the escape of Captain\nSpruit and his companions borders on the miraculous. The odds especially\nagainst Captain Spruit reaching Sydney must have been enormous. Captain\nSpruit and his companions were in an open boat, in mid-ocean, 400 miles\nfrom land, without a vestige of food or water, and for days at the mercy of\na hurricane. And further, in the case of Captain Spruit it is to be\nremembered that he could not swim, and that he was thrown out of the\nboat into the sea.\nIt will also be noticed in the account in the Herald that when a reporter\ncalled at Captain Spruit\u2019s house to interview him, Captain Spruit \u201ccame\ninto the room barefooted, and with both hands bandaged. . . . . and\npointing to his uncovered feet and legs, said, \u2018They tell a tale of some\ntrouble, don\u2019t they ?\u2018 Certainly the bruises and cuts and the way they were\nswollen indicated a very shocking tale of suffering.\"\nThe account in the Sydney Morning Herald concludes with the following\nparagraph :\u2014\n\u201c A REMARKABLE DREAM.\n\u201c Whatever may or may not be credited to superstitious ideas, startling\nfacts occasionally crop up which are usually regarded as curious coincidences.\nThis happened in reference to the loss of the Ataumm. Last Thursday\nmorning a daughter of Captain Spruit\u2019s, residing at home at Balmain with\nher mother and the other members of the family, narrated to the latter very\nvividly a dream that she had had. In it she saw her father's ship sink, and\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Resem-ch. [Jcn, 1899.\ndistinctly described the captain taking to the boats with the men, how they\nwere dressed, and generally a number of details, which upon Captain Spruit\u2019s\narrival at home were told to him, to his utter amazement. The time, as\nnear as can be judged, at which the actual taking to the boats occurred,\ncorresponds with that of the dream. So it was not such a surprise after\nall to the family when their father reached his home from sea yesterday.\nThe circumstances were vouched for by Mrs. Spruit to a Herald reporter\nyesterday as being in that lady\u2019s judgment very remarkable, as, indeed, most\npersons will consider them to be.\"\n[From this stage the account has been revised by the Spruits.l\nOn the evening of Friday, February 18th, eight days after the dream,\nand the same day as the report of the shipwreck appeared in the news\npapers, I called on Captain and Mrs Spruit at their house, 26, Prosper\nstreet, Rozelle, Balmain, a suburb of Sidney, and had a conversation with\nthem about their daughter\u2019s dream. At \ufb01rst only Captain and Mrs.\nSpruit were present. Mrs. Spruit, in reply to enquiries, said :\u2014\nOn Thursday week, at three in the morning, my daughter Lily, aged\nthirteen, came into my bedroom where I was sleeping. She tapped me on\nthe forehead, waking me, and said, \u201c Oh, Mama, I\u2019m frightened.\u201d I asked\nher what for, and she said, \u201cOh, see, Dada\u2019s ship is wrecked. Dada has\ncome home all in rags, and his feet and legs are all cut, and one or two of\nhis men are drowned out of his boat.\u201d I said, \u201c Nonsense, child,\u201d and she\nanswered, \u201cOh yes, Mama, I have seen it quite true.\u201d Then, of course, I\ncoaxed her to go oH to bed. But she kept it up from Thursday right on till\nthe following Sunday. On Sunday she asked me if there was any fear, and\nif I believed in dreams. I told her, yes, to ,a certain extent I did. And\nthen she said her father would be too far away, and that it was on this coast\nthat she dreamed the ship was lost. I said, \u201c No, he would not be too far\naway, but it is only nonsense, and you are trying to frighten me.\" That was\nall, but the child never forgot it. A week after the dream, on the evening\nthat my husband returned, Lily came in from school and found me crying,\nand she said, \u201c Oh, Mama, is the Ata-coma wrecked? \u201d At once she thought\nof her dream and of her father. I told her than her father had come home,\nand she said, \"Are Dada\u2019s legs cut, Mama?\u201d I told her that they were,\nand she, when she saw her father, said, \u201c You didn\u2019t have these clothes on.\nThe clothes you had on were all torn when I dreamed about the shipwreck.\"\nOn the Thursday I had to keep her away from school on account of her being\nso much upset by her dream. The poor little thing kept it up till Sunday at\ndinner time, and nearly broke my heart. You know they say if a person\ndreams of blood it means scandal, and I said, thinking of her father\u2019s feet\nbeing cut, \u201c Were they bleeding? \u201d and she turned away and cried.\nWhile Mrs. Sprult was making this statement Captain Spruit was present,\nbut the child, Lily, was in another room. Mrs. Spruit went to fetch her\ndaughter, in order that I might get a direct statement about the dream.\nWhile Mrs. Spruit was away on this errand, I asked Captain Spruit if he\nhad ever had any dreams of this kind. He replied in the negative, and added\nthat at one time he used to note down when he dreamed of anything, but\nnone of his dreams had ever come to anything. Once he dreamed that two\n\fJuLY, 1899.] Case. 107\nfriends were dead. He wrote home to enquire about it, and found they\nwere still alive and well, so after that he gave up making notes of his\ndreams.\nAt this stage Mrs. Spruit returned with her daughter, Lily Spruit. The\nchild was reluctant at \ufb01rst to say anything, as she did not want anything\nmore about her dream to be made public; but after chatting for a few minutes,\nshe made the following statement :\u2014\n\u201c On the Wednesday night I dreamed it, and I went into Mother's room\non Thursday morning. I got a fright, and I woke up so quick and ran in to my\nMother. I thought I saw my Father get into a boat, and they got everything\ninto the boat that they could, and they kept close up to the ship, and after\nwards it went down, and my Father was in the boat and the boy Allen, and\nthe boatswain, and two or three others I did not know, and one or two got\ndrowned, and my father came home all out about, and he had lost every\nthing.\u201d '\nI asked her if she had seen the boat capsize.\n\u201c I saw the boat go over,\" she replied, \u201c and I saw the boy Allen\ndrowned.\" '\n\u201c Did you know the boy Allen ? \u201d I asked, and she said, \u201c No, but I know\nfrom what my Father has said since that it was the boy Allen. I saw a boy\ndrowned, and now I take it to be the boy Allen.\u201d\n\u201c Did you see anything more in your dream ? \u201d\n\u201c Yes, I saw them pulling my Father into the boat.\u201d\n\u201c Did the night seem dark ?\u201d\n\u201c Yes, it was quite dark. It was a stormy night, and the wind was\nhowling.\u201d\n\u201c Did you hear the wind in your dream ? \u201d\n\u201c Yes, I heard it howling.\u201d\n\u201c Do you often dream ? Have you ever dreamed anything like this\nbefore ?\u201d\n\u201c I have never dreamed anything like this before. I have only dreamed\nthat. I never dream.\u201d\nMrs. Spruit interposed, \u201c I don\u2019t think she is a child that ever dreams.\u201d\nI asked again about the boy Allen, and Mrs. Spruit said :\u2014\u201c My daughter\nwas sure of one or two men having been drowned, but did not know who\nthey were. Now she puts one of them down as the boy Allen. I asked her\nwho were saved besides her Father, and she said she could not tell me.\u201d\n(Signed) DoNALD MURRAY.\nWe have read and revised the foregoing account taken down in short\u2014\nhand and written out by Mr. Murray, and we certify that it is a correct\nreport of our statements to him, and that our statements are true.\n(Signed) CAPTAIN H.

The gale commenced on the 12th, 4 p.m., and the boat\ncapsized at 11.5 p.m. same night, as at that time my watch stopped, and the\nboy Allen was lost.\nTrusting you will be able to understand this explanation, I am, dear Sir,\nrespectfully yours, H. 0 SPRUIT_\nIn connection with this dream there are three main points which appear\nto require discussion, namely,\n1. Credibility of witnesses.\n2. Odds against coincidence.\n3. Time relations of the dream.\n\fJuLY, 1899.] Case. 109'\nFirst in importance is the credibility of the witnesses. On this point I\nentertain no doubts. [Mr. Murray afterwards had reason to doubt the\nreliability of Captain Spruit\u2019s statements. See his letter of October 2nd,\n1898, below.]\nAssuming then that the account of the dream is substantially correct, the\nnext point requiring consideration is the probability of the dream having\nbeen merely a coincidence. There are several circumstances which appear to\nme to make this probability very small. If the dream had simply related\n(1) to the wreck of the Atacama, or\n(2) to the safe return of Captain Spruit, or\n(3) to his feet and legs being out about, or\n(4) to several of his men being drowned,\nthen coincidence might fairly be regarded as the true explanation. But\nwhen we \ufb01nd a complex agreement between the dream and the facts on at\nleast four main points, the odds against coincidence become so vast as to\njustify us in looking for some other explanation. Let us assume that the\nodds against simple coincidence between the dream and the fact in\nthe \ufb01rst case were 100 to 1; in the second case 100,000 to 1 (the\nodds against this event were enormous, say 10,000 to 1, and con\nsequently the odds against the coincidence between the dream and the\nevent must have been still greater, say 10 times); in the third case\n1,000 to 1; and in the fourth case 1,000 to 1. Then the odds against\nthe combined coincidence would be 100 billions [should be 10 billions]\nto 1. It is to be noted that the odds against the events themselves were\ncomparatively small. Coal is a dangerous cargo, and the ship was so old\nthat she went to sea uninsured. Probably the odds were not more than\n100 to 1 against her being lost, and the very fact of loss involved probable\ninjury and death to the captain and crew. The odds against the escape of\nthe captain have already been estimated at 10,000 to 1, so that the odds\nagainst the whole chain of events were perhaps not more than a million to\none. Compare this with the odds of 100 billions to 1 against the dream\nbeing a mere coincidence. It is true these odds are only guesswork, but they\nserve to illustrate the contention that \u201ccomplex coincidence\u201d is not a\nsatisfactory explanation of the Atacama dream.\n[The writer has, I think, considerably overestimated the odds\nagainst the events and against the dream coinciding with them. It\nis essential to note that the events were not independent of one\nanother, and therefore the improbability of their occurrence can not\nbe measured, as he has done, by multiplying together the improba\nbilities of all the events taken separately. If the ship had not been\nwrecked, the chance of the injuries to the captain and the drowning\nof some of the crew might be, as Mr. Murray estimates, about 1\nin 100 in each case. But after the shipwreck the chance of both\nthese events happening was, as he observes, very much greater, and\nthis is the contingency that has to be considered. There are, I\nthink, at the outside, only two events in the series su\ufb02iciently indepen\ndent of one another for their improbabilities to be taken into account:\n(1) the loss of the ship, the chance of which Mr. Murray thinks was\nas much as l in 100, and (2) the escape of the captain after the\nshipwreck, the chance of which he estimates as l in 10,000. Now,\nthe only possible way of estimating chances in such a case as this\nis by empirical observation of actual facts, and the proportion of\nsurvivors out of crews shipwrecked at about 400 miles from land is\n\f110 Jouwmrl 0*\u2018 Society for Psychical Resea\/rch. [Ju1.r,1s99.\ncertainly far more than 1 in 10,000. In this particular case, as far\nas we can judge from the narrative, all the crew must have had, on\nan average, about an equal chance of surviving, and, judging from\nthe results, that chance was about 1 in 4, since 4 men out of 17\nsurvived. Of course we cannot really estimate the chances from a\nsingle case like this, and there is no doubt that the men were in an\nextremely dangerous position. But there Rre many situations in life\nin which men encounter great dangers and yet escape from them. In\nbattles, for instance, only a small proportion of men are generally\nkilled. Thus, at the capture of Omdurman, on September 2nd, 1898,\nafter a battle which lasted practically all day, the total number of\npersons killed on the Anglo-Egyptian side was about 43, and the\ntotal killed and wounded (of the latter, of course, some died later)\nwere about 378, out of a force of 25,000 engaged on that side. The\npercentage of total casualties was thus about 12*. The losses of\nthe Dervishes were, of course, far heavier. The chance of death under\nmany circumstances may appear great, because the danger is vividly\npresent to our imagination: but statistics show that the chance of\nsurvival is generally far greater. Thus, it seems to me possible that\nthe chance of Captain Spruit\u2019s escape was at least 1 in 4.\u2014ED.]\nIt may be explained here that the storm encountered by Captain Spruit\nand his men in the open boat\u2014one of the heaviest storms for years\u2014-did\ngreat damage all over New South Wales and led to many shipwrecks on the\ncoast ; but it was before this storm commenced that the Atacama sprang a\nleak and foundered, and there was on Wednesday, February 9th, nothing in\nSydney to indicate the approach of a hurricane. There was, therefore,\nnothing in the appearance of the weather in Sydney when Lily Spruit went\nto bed on Wednesday night to make her fear for her father's safety. Turn\ning up the weather forecasts in the Sydney Morning Hei'(lld, I \ufb01nd that on\nFebruary 11th the o\ufb02icial forecast for the day gave no indication of heavy\nweather beyond saying that the weather in New South \\Vales would be\n\u201c cloudy and unsettled.\u201d On February 12th the forecast was \u201c generally un\nsettled throughout, with rain pretty general . . . sea moderate.\u201d It was\nnot till Sunday, February 13th, that the wild storm set in. It will also be\nseen from the newspaper extracts accompanying this account, that the storm\nwas a monsoonal disturbance from the north-west, and that consequently the\nAtacama had foundered 400 miles to the east of Sydney three days before\nthe hurricane from the north-west had reached Sydney. From Captain\nSpruit\u2019s notebook it will be seen that when the Atacama foundered, the\nweather was fresh, but not stormy.\nIn regard to the third main point, the strangest feature of the dream\nappears to me to be the extraordinary way in which the time relations have\nbeen jumbled up. The child, when telling her mother of the dream on\nThursday morning, spoke in the present tense, \u201cOh, see, Dada\u2019s ship is\nwrecked. Dada has come home, etc.\u201d The dream took place. it would seem,\nshortly before three o\u2019clock in the morning on Thursday, February 10th.\nThe Atacama was abandoned at six p.m. on Wednesday, February 9th.\nThat was about nine hours before the dream began, and Captain Spruit\ndid not \u201ccome home\u201d till February 17th. In other words, the little seer\napparently beheld in her brief dream vision the events, past and future,\n* These numbers are only_n.pproximate, since the numbers given in different\nreports of the battle varied considerably.\n\fJuLY, \\899.] Case. 1111\nwhich in actual life extended over a whole week. Seemingly for the moment\nshe had reached that condition of existence. described by the Irish orator,\n\u201c when time shall be no more and eternity shall have become a thing of the\npast.\u201d Mrs. Spruit in describing her daughter\u2019s dream led me to under\nstand that the child, when she came in to her mother at three o\u2019clock on\n~ Thursday morning, was confused and apparently still saw the vision, leading\nher to speak in the present tense. Lily Spruit in her own account to me\nnaturally did not use the present tense, as it was then a week after the\ndream. She said, \u201c I thought I saw my father get into a boat, and they got\neverything into the boat that they could, and they kept close up to the ship\nand afterwards it went down.\u201d So far the dream can be accounted for by\ntelepathy over a distance of 400 miles. But the drowning of Allen and\nsubsequent events did not take place till after the dream was over. This\npart of the dream may have been simply a surmise of the dreaming mind as\nto what would happen as the result of the telepathically known events, a\nsurmise that by a rare chance turned out to be correct. Otherwise the\ndream involves some fascinating metaphysical problems.\nDoNALD MURRAY.\nA few comments may be made on what Mr. Murray calls the\n\u201cstrangest feature of the dream,\u201d\u2014the way in which it corresponded\nwith past, present, and future events. He remarks, indeed, that the\napparent perception of the future \u201cmay have been simply a surmise\nof the dreaming mind as to what would happen as the result of the\ntelepathically known events\u201d; but he seems to imply that we can\nsuppose this only by straining the notion of telepathy. VVe know,\nhowever, that ideas originated by telepathy present themselves to the\nmind generally in a sensory form; they appear like actual sights or\nsounds, etc., which can only be distinguished by re\ufb02ection and judgment\nfrom the visual and auditory sensations derived from material objects.\nIt seems to follow almost inevitably that the mind should treat tele\npathic ideas as it does ordinary sensations, that is, use them as simple\nrough material to be worked up into complex concepts. In the domain\nof ordinary psychology, nothing is more familiar than the fact that\nonly a very small part of our perception of an object is derived directly\nfrom what we see, hear, or feel of it ; by far the greater part is made\nup of inference from our sensations and deduction from previous\nknowledge of that and other objects, and the more complex the object,\nthe greater is the proportion of the percept due to inference. It seems\nreasonable to suppose that a similar mental process goes on in the case\nof e telepathic percept of an objective fact. Probably only a small\npart of the percept is directly due to the object; the greater part is\nmanufactured by the mind of the percipient, and the manufactured\npart probably increases with the complexity of the object.\nIf this be so, two results follow: (l) a certain amount of error may\noften creep into the percept through incorrect inference and deduction\nfrom what is correctly\u2014telepathically\u2014perceived ; that is, there may\nbe genuine telepathic action, in spite of even considerable incorrectness\nin the details of the percept (for instance, the detail in Lily Spruit\u2019s\ndream that her father had \u201ccome home all in rags\u201d was incorrect,\nwhile the other details, as far as they went, corresponded with the\n\f112 Journal of Society for 1\u2019s;z\/chlcal Research. [Jun. 1899.\nfacts); (2) a certain amount of correct detail may be added through\ninference and deduction to the telepathic percept and thus give the\nimpression of a much more far-reaching action of telepathy than has\nreally occurred. A complex correspondence of a vision with reality is\nnot therefore necessarily; better evidence of telepathy than a single,\nstrongly-marked, and de\ufb01nite correspondence, such as, an apparition\nseen at the time of death of the person represented.\nIn practice, it is, of course, exceedingly di\ufb02icult, if not impossible,\nto distinguish between the objectively derived part of the percept and\nthe subsequent mental additions, even in the case of ordinary sensory\npercepts. But it is clear that, when dealing with presumably telepathic\npercepts, we ought to allow the widest possible margin for the part\nplayed by inference and deduction. Such an allowance, however, does\nnot affect the force of the evidence for telepathy in the case of Lily\nSpruit\u2018\/s dream, so far as the central incidents of the dream are con\ncerned; namely, the loss of the ship and her father\u2019s escape. These\nmay be regarded as two separate incidents, because the idea of the loss\nof the ship would naturally suggest that her father was drowned,\nrather than that he escaped; whereas the other correct details of the\ndream, as already observed, might easily have been inferred from the\nidea of the wreck.\nMr. Murray states that there was a widespread impression in\nSydney, after the disaster had become known, that the Atacama\nshould not have been allowed to go to sea. One newspaper, the\nSydney Bulletin, was very outspoken on the subject, and, in con\nsequence, was sued for libel by the owners of the vessel.\nAfter studying all the evidence brought forward at the trial,\nMr. Murray wrote :\u2014\nOctober 2nd, 1898.\nIn order to complete the record of the Atacama case, I enclose the\nSydney Morning Herald report of the Atacama libel action. Brie\ufb02y it is to\nbe noted that the defendant newspaper, the Bulletin, won the case, and that\nthe evidence disclosed a shocking state of affairs in regard to the condition\nin which ships are allowed to leave New South Wales _ports. The Atacama\nwas shown to have been a crazy old tub, \u201cleaking like a lobster-pot,\u201d worse\nthan Kipling\u2019s Bolivar, and, as the defendant\u2019s counsel put it, her seams\nused to \u201copen out like a concertina.\" Apparently Captain Spruit was\ninduced to risk his life in her in return for a bonus on his salary. After\nreading the evidence, I cannot see how it was possible for Captain Spruit\nnot to have been aware of the unseaworthy condition of the Atacama.\nWhether this knowledge was shared by his family is a matter that 1 cannot\nregard as settled by Captain Spruit\u2019s denial, and if Lily Spruit had any\nanxiety about her father\u2019s safety, the possibility of chance coincidence\nbetween the dream and the wreck is slightly strengthened\u2014in my opinion,\nhowever, not to any serious extent. DoNALD MURRAY\u2018\nThe report of the trial sent by Mr. Murray fully bears out the\nremarks in the above letter. The evidence tended to show that the\nupper part and sides of the ship had been repaired properly, while the\nbottom was left practically untouched, and the ship leaked a great\ndeal all the time she was being loaded with coal before she started.\n\fNo. OLXII.\u2014Vox..

HANSEN AND LEHMANN ON THE\nTELEPATHIC PROBLEM.*\nThe following correspondence may interest or entertain some of\nour readers.\nProfessor Titchener, of Cornell Uni\"ersity, contributed to Science,\nfor December 23rd, 1898, a paper on \u201cThe Feeling of being Stared\nat.\u201d After explaining the popular belief that one may make a person\nlook round by staring at the back of his head, by the fact that many\npersons are nervous when others are behind them, and, involuntarily\nlooking round at intervals to reassure themselves, meet our eyes if we\nare making the experiment, he adds the following paragraph. The\nrest of the correspondence explains itself.\nIn conclusion, I may state that I have tested this interpretation of the\n\u201cfeeling of being stared at,\u201d at various times, in series of laboratory\nexperiments conducted with persons who declared themselves either\npeculiarly susceptible to the stare or peculiarly capable of \u201c making people\nturn round.\u201d As regards such capacity and susceptibility, the experiments\nhave invariably given a negative result; in other words, the interpre\ntation offered has been con\ufb01rmed. If the scienti\ufb01c reader object\nthat this result might have been foreseen, and that the experiments were,\ntherefore, a waste of time, 1 can only reply that they seem to me to have\ntheir justi\ufb01cation in the breaking down of a superstition which has deep and\nwidespread roots in the popular consciousness. No scienti\ufb01cally-minded\npsychologist believes in telepathy. At the same time, the disproof of it in a\ngiven case may start a student upon the straight scienti\ufb01c path, and the time\nspent may thus be repaid to science a hundredfold. The brilliant work\nof Lehmann and Hansen upon the telepathic \u201c problem\u201d (Philos.

TITCHENER.\nCornell University.\n[From Science, December 30th, 1898.]\nProfessor Titchener in today\u2019s Science assumes that Messrs. Lehmann and\nHansen have performed a work of de\ufb01nitive demolition in the well-meant\narticle of theirs to which he refers. If he will take the pains to read\nProfessor Sidgwick\u2019s criticism of their results in the S.P.R. Proceedings,\nVol. XII., p. 298, as well as the note to my report of his paper in the\nPsychological Review, Vol. IV., p. 654,* he will probably admit that, owing\nto the fewness of the data which they collected, they entirely failed to prove\ntheir point. This leaves the phenomena in dispute still hanging, and\nawaiting a positive interpretation from other hands.\nI think that an exploded document ought not to be left with the last\nword, even for the sake of \u201c scienti\ufb01c psychology.\u201d And I must incidentally\nthank Professor Titchener for his admission that \u201caloofness, however\nauthoritative\u201d (which phrase seems to be style noble for \u201cignorance of the\nsubject, and be d\u2014d to it\u201d), is an attitude which need not be invariably\nmaintained by the \u201cScienti\ufb01c,\u201d even towards matters such as this. I only\nwish that his admission were a little less apologetic in form.\nWILLIAM JAMEs.\nCambridge, Mass., December 23rd, 1898.\n* This note by Professor James is as follows :\u2014\n\u201c The Danish authors made only 500 experiments, obviously too small a number\nfor safe conclusions. The better to frame a critical opinion, I have myself collected a\nseries of upwards of 1,000 guesses at bi-digital numbers whispered with closed lips\nby the agent. Following Lehmann\u2019s method, and comparing the four most frequent\nerroneous guesses at each digit of the numbers whispered with the four most fre\nquent errors made in divining the same digits in the English thought-transference\nseries, I \ufb01nd (taking the digits from 1 to 9) that 20 of the erroneous digits are\ncommon to the two series. But I \ufb01nd that if one compares the four least frequent\nerroneous guesses in my whispered series with the most frequent corresponding ones\nin the thought-transference series, one gets 15, no great difference. Taking the one\nmost frequent error of substitution for each digit in my series, I \ufb01nd but 2 agree\nments with the thought-transference series, and 2 with the Sidgwick series of pure\nguesses. Plotting the frequency of the various errors in the several series as curves\nshows so great a discrepancy between my whispered series and the Danish one that\nit becomes obvious that the series are too short to serve as proper terms of comparison\nwith the thought-transference series Moreover, the curves of my series and those\nof the thought-transference series show at special points variations from each other\nso great, when compared with the absolute \ufb01gures which they represent, that the\nsame conclusion is again obvious. Both the agreements and the disagreements are\nthus probably accidental. I myself agree, then, entirely with Professor Sidgwick\nthat Professor Lehmann has failed to prove his particular hypothesis of whispering\nas the cause of the thought-transference results ; and I am pleased to notice that Mr.\nParish, in the work noticed below (Hallum'nations and Illusions, p. 320, note), also\nconsiders Professor Sidgwick \u2018perfectly justified in his contention.\u2019 \u201d\n\f001., 1899.] On the Telepathic Problem. 115\n[From Science, January 6th, 1899.]\nI can assure Professor James that I do not knowingly leave unread any\nthing that he or Professor Sidgwick writes. I carefully considered the two\npapers to which he refers, at the time of their appearance, and have recently\nturned to them again. I am afraid, however, that I cannot make the\nadmission that Professor James expects. Even if I granted all the conten- '\ntions of criticism and report, I should still see no reason to change the\nwording of my reference to Lehmann and Hansen. But there is a great\ndeal that I cannot grant. While, like Stevenson\u2019s Silver, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t set\nno limits to what a virtuous character might consider argument,\u201d I must\nconfess that, in the present instance, the grounds for such consideration have\nnot seldom escaped me. '\nProfessor James rules that the Phil. Studicn article is \u201c exploded.\u201d I\nhave tried to take up the position of an impartial onlooker ; and, from that\nposition, I have seen Professor James and Professor Sidgwick and Herr\nParish handling the fuse, but I have not yet heard the detonation.\nE. B. TITCHENER.\n[From Science, May 5th, 1899.]\nAfter recapitulating the early stages of the discussion, Professor\nJames writes, in reference to the \ufb01nal sentence of the above letter :\u2014\nAs the explosion was so audible to me, the disproof being quasi-mathe\nmatical, I was astounded at this hardness of hearing in my colleague; and,\nto make sure that I was not a victim of auditory hallucination, I wrote to\nProfessor Lehmann to know what he himself thought of his conclusions, in\nthe light of the criticisms in question. His answer, somewhat belated, just\narrives.*\nHe says :\u2014\u201c Your own as well as Professor Sidgwick\u2019s experiments and\ncomputations prove, beyond a doubt, that the play of chance had thrown\n* Professor Lehmann writes to Professor James :\u2014\n\u201c Kopenhagen, d. 5\/4, 1899.\n.

Ausserdem geht aus den Berechnungen Professor Sidgwick\u2019s hervor\ndass die Zahlen-Gewohnheit (number-habit) eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Ob diese\nbeide Faktoren die Sache erkliiren kiinnen, wird sich wohl schliesslich, durch fort\ngesetzte Versuche, herausstellen.

On the point that Lehmann has not \u201cestablished\u201d his explanation\nof the Sidgwick results I am heartily at one with James, Sidgwick, Parish and\nLehmann himself. But Professor James need not have awaited the return\nmail from Copenhagen to wrest this admission either from Lehmann or from\nme. Lehmann wrote in his original paper: \u201cEin exacter Beweis hierfiir\n(i.e., for his explanation) kann wohl im Augenblicke nicht gefiihrt werden.\u201d\nNor, I take it, in any future Augenblick.\nOn the other hand, I have never regarded this point as the point at issue.\nLehmann set out to examine telepathy at large. He chose the Sidgwick\nexperiments simply as typical series, considering the authors\u2019 names a\nguarantee ofserious intent and careful work. In his inquiry he laid hold of\na condition which had never been thoroughly investigated before, and traced\nits effects in experiments that were both ingeniously devised and rigidly\ncontrolled ; no one can neglect the unconscious whisper in future telepathic\nwork. His paper is a model of scienti\ufb01c method ; he has shown us how\nborderland questions are to be attacked, and proved that the \u201c ordinary\nchannels of sense\u201d have unexplored resources. His suggestions will be\nfruitful, for the next stage of advance must be an exhaustive study of the\n\u201c number-habits\u201d which Sidgwick at \ufb01rst rejected, but now makes the\nheadstone of the corner. Even granting all the contentions of the critics,\ntherefore, I should assert that Lehmann\u2019s work is brilliant, and that it has\ndone signal service to scienti\ufb01c psychology. But, as I hinted before, I do\nnot know that quasi-mathematics has contributed much to psychology in any\n\ufb01eld of research.\nI conclude with a word on the logic of Professor James\u2019 objection. A\ntheory is pronounced which, from the outset, lays claim to probability and to\nprobability only. \u201cExact proof\u201d is acknowledged to be impossible. Criticism\nplays upon the theory, and the author again acknowledges that his hypothesis\nis not proven. Professor James, apparently forgetting the \ufb01rst acknowledg\nment, af\ufb01rms that the criticism has \u201c exploded \u201d- the theory ! What is not\nproven is, co ipso, exploded ! Is Professor James, then, ready to grant that\nhis recent book on \u2018 \u2018Human Immortality\u201d\u2014\u2014something which assuredly is not\n\fOcT.,1899.] On the Telepathic Problem. 117\nyet proven\u2014is an \u201cexploded document\u201d ?

TITCHENER.\n[There seems here some slight confusion in the use of the terms,\n\u201cproof\u201d and \u201cprobability.\u201d Professor Titchener \ufb01rst introduces\nProfessor Lehmann\u2019s paper as an example of scienti\ufb01c \u201cdisproof \u201d of\ntelepathy in a given case ; then, when Professor Lehmann admits his\nown failure as regards the Sidgwick case, Professor Titchener claims\nthat there was no failure, since Professor Lehmann never pretended to\n\u201cestablish\u201d his explanation, but only to make it probable. But\nwhat Professor Lehmann admits in his candid letter is that Professors\nSidgwick\u2019s and James's criticisms show that he had not proved his\nexplanation to be even probable. The utmost that his experiments\ncould do\u2014and, of course, the utmost that he claimed for them\u2014was\nto establish a presumption in favour of the view that a certain\ncondition was the e\ufb02icient cause of certain results. Such a\npresumption could only be established by showing that the results\nconcurred with the condition more often than they would be likely to\ndo by chance. Professor Sidgwick proved that the concurrence was\nnot too frequent to be attributed to chance, and thus showed that the\nauthors had failed to establish the presumption aimed at.--EI).]\n[From Science, May 26th, 1899.]\nWhy Professor Titchener should have taken an essay which he now\nadmits to have completely failed even to make probable its point, as an\nexample of the \u201cbrilliant work\u201d which \u201cscienti\ufb01c psychology\" can do in\nthe way of destroying the telepathic superstition, may be left to be\nfathomed by readers with more understanding of the ways of \u201cScience\u201d\nthan I possess.\nMeanwhile, as one interested in mere accuracy, I must protest against\ntwo impressions which Professor Titchener, in your number of May 12th,\nseeks to leave upon the reader\u2019s mind.\nThe \ufb01rst is that whispering was \ufb01rst considered by Professor Lehmann.\nIt has been elaborately discussed in the S.P.R. Proceedings over and over\nagain. Sidgwick\u2019s six-page discussion of it in the report of his own experi\nments is the basis of comparison used by Lehmann in his ampler but\nabortive investigation.\nThe second of Professor Titchener\u2019s implications is that it was Lehmann\nwho introduced number-habits, and even forced the admission of them on\nthe recalcitrant Sidgwick. Lehmann makes no mention of number-habits.\nSidgwick himself introduces them, to account, not for the thought-transference\nresults, but for the many errors common to the guesses of his subjects and\nLehmann\u2019s :\u2014the two perhaps had the same number-habit. Does Professor\nTitchener seriously think thata number-habit in a guesser can account for\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

But I wish to state,\nin self-defence, that I do not \u201c seek to leave upon the reader's mind\u201d the\ntwo impressions to which Professor James refers. I do not say that\nLehmann \ufb01rst considered whispering ; I say that he was the \ufb01rst thoroughly\nto investigate it. There is a difference. I do not imply that Lehmann intro\nduced number-habits ; I say that the next step in advance beyond him is an\nexhaustive study of number-habits. Again there is a difference.\nE. B. TITCHENER.\nIt is true that, as Professor Titchener admits, Professor Lehmann\ndid not introduce number-habits to explain the successful results of the\nS.P.R. experiments in thought-transference. Not only so, but he did\nnot even mention them in his original pamphlet. In his letter to Pro\nfessor James, however (see above, p. 115, foot-note), he maintains, \u201cas\na provisional hypothesis, that involuntary whispering, combined with\nnumber-habits, would undoubtedly su\ufb02ice\u201d to explain the successes.\nThis remark suggests that he is under some misapprehension as to\nWhat can and what cannot be achieved by number-habits\u2014a mis\napprehension from which there is no clear evidence that Professor\nTitchener himself is free. It may therefore be worth while to give\nhere a brief general review of the subject.*\nIt has long been recognised by psychologists that most\u2014if not\nall\u2014persons have unconscious preferences for certain objects or ideas\nover others of the same class; so that, if one is told to guess or to\nthink of, say, a colour, a playing-card, or a number;\u2014\u2014certain colours,\ncards, or numbers occur to the mind more frequently than others, and\nare therefore guessed more often. These idiosyncrasies are called\n* For examples of the experimental study of number-habits, we may refer our\nreaders to the two articles on their experiments in thought-transference by Professor\nand Mrs. Sidgwick in the Proceedings S.P.R. In Vol. VI., p. 170, a complete\nanalysis from this point of view of all the numbers included in their experiments is\ngiven, and in Vol. VIII., p. 548, the number-habits of their most successful\npercipient are fully described. In Vol. XII., pp. 303-4, Professor Sidgwick returns\nto the subject in his discussion of the work of Messrs. Hansen and Lehmann. See\nalso a review of Dr. Dessoir\u2019s Das Doppcl-Ich, by Mir. F. \\V. H. Myers, in Vol. VI.,\np. 209.\n\fOcT.,1899.] On the Telepathic Problem. 119\n\u201cmental habits,\u201d or,\u2014if we are referring to numbers only,\u2014\u201cnumber\nhabits.\u201d It is hardly ever possible to account for them, that is, to\ntrace the origin of any particular preference ; it would seem as if the\nindividual acquired them entirely at random. Not only so, but they\nmay vary in the same person at different times, while different persons\nmay exhibit the same preferences.\nNow, supposing that two persons are trying experiments in the\nthought-transference of numbers, the same numbers may happen to be\nthe favourites of both agent and percipient. If, then, the agent\nselects numbers to think of, some successful guesses may be made\nwhich are due\u2014not to thought-transference, but to similarity in the\nnumber-habits of the two experimenters.\nThis source of error, however, may be absolutely excluded if the\nnumbers to be guessed are not selected voluntarily by the agent, but\ndrawn at random from a batch of numbers. As early as 1886, there\nfore (see Phanlasms of the Living, Vol. I., pp. 31\u201435, and Vol. II.,\np. 653), experimenters who worked in connection with the Society for\nPsychical Research were accustomed to use the method of drawing\nnumbers at random, and it is hardly necessary to say that all the\nnumber-guessing in the experiments of Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick\nwas carried out on this plan.\nOn the other hand, supposing again that the agent selects the\nnumbers and that his number-habits are markedly dissimilar from\nthose of the percipient, then the successes would probably be decidedly\nfewer than they would be if due to chance alone.\nNow, con\ufb01ning ourselves to cases where the numbers to be guessed\nare drawn at random, it is clear that the existence of any decided\nnumber-habit does not affect in any way the probability of guessing\nright by chance. since the number drawn at any moment is neither\nmore nor less likely to be one of the percipient\/s favourites than to be\nany other number. On the average, therefore, the number of accidental\nsuccesses would be the same, whether a number-habit existed or not.\nA decided number-habit may, however, affect prejudicially the\nnumber of successes produced by telepathy (assuming, for the sake of\nthe argument, that successes may sometimes be due to telepathy),\nbecause the idea of the favourite number, constantly obtruding itself\ninto the mind, would tend to obscure or replace the impressions\nderived telepathically ; just as, when a material object is perceived in\nthe ordinary way through the senses, a preconceived idea as to What\nthe object is may often make us perceive it wrongly.\nThus, in experiments of the kind under consideration, there is\nonly one case in which the existence of numberhabits can increase\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT.,1B99.\nthe successes and so make the evidence for telepathy in that case\nappear stronger than it really is ; namely, the case in which (1) the\nagent selects the numbers to be guessed and at the same time (2) his\nnumber-habits are similar to those of the percipient. In all other\ncases, number-habits would decrease those successes which are due to\nany other agency than chance.\nSOME NOTES ON SELF-SUGGESTION.\nThe following observations on the e\ufb02icacy of self-suggestion of\nvarious kinds have been sent to us by an Associate of the American\nBranch of the S.P.R., Mr. Thomas Fillebrown, M.D., D.M.D.,\nProfessor of Operative Dentistry and Oral Surgery at Harvard\nUniversity.\nThe \ufb01rst case illustrates the in\ufb02uence of widespread popular\nbeliefs even over the minds of those whose education would probably\nlead them to reject the beliefs, if deliberately considered. Thus, it has\nbeen, and is still, commonly held that curative effects which seem\ndependent on the personality of the healer must involve some\nspecial expenditure of energy on his part\u2014some \u201cvirtue going out of\nhim \u201d\u2014and in accordance with this view, numerous hypnotists have\nrecorded sensations of exhaustion, discomfort, or even pain felt after\nmaking efforts to in\ufb02uence their patients or subjects. It is probable,\nhowever, that any sensation felt on making the \ufb01rst successful attempt\nto hypnotise is due to some chance suggestion, and that by association\nof ideas the same sensation reappears in connection with future\nattempts, and so tends to become stereotyped.\nNevertheless, far too little is known at present of the real method of\noperation of the hypnotic in\ufb02uence for us to be able to state dogmati\ncally that there is no de\ufb01nite correlation between the physical condition\nof the operator and the effect produced on the subject. But there is\nabundant evidence to show that sensations felt by the hypnotist, if\nnot wholly due to self-suggestion, may at least be greatly increased or\ndiminished by it. Thus Dr. Fillebrown found that the discomfort he\nexperienced could be to a great extent controlled by his will, and was\nentirely removed by the assistance of suggestion from a friend. He\nwrites :\n(I) For some ten years I have used suggestion as a means of obtunding\nsensitiveness of tissue, alleviating pain, and establishing healthy action in\nthe human system.\nAt \ufb01rst I thought it necessary to induce hypnosis in all cases. When I\ncommenced I had never seen a person hypnotised. I studied the subject\n\fO(71\u2018.,1899.] Some Notes on Self-Suggestion. 121\nfrom various authors, principally Bernheim, applied the methods described,\nand succeeded at my \ufb01rst effort, and uniformly since. My desire to succeed\namounted to anxiety, hence I made every effort to do all I could, and, as it\nproved, I quite overdid the matter. I soon began to feel when hypnotising\na distinct pressure in the region of the medulla: at one sitting with a\npatient I experienced a severe pain in the same locality, as though some\nthing was strained. For some time I could not hypnotise without suffering\nagood deal. I soon learned to control my effort, and stop as soon as I\nexperienced discomfort; and I succeeded with the hypnosis just as well.\nLater, Professor F. H. Gerrish applied to me the remedy of suggestion\ntwice, and cured me entirely.\nMy subsequent experience has been that when I exercise suggestion the\nmost effectively, the sensation in the medulla is the most pronounced. It\nis always distinct, but not painful. It feels like normal action. The sensa\ntion I now have is as though I let something go to work ; and I can watch\nits action meanwhile. I have found, too, that the apparent amount of\naction depends somewhat upon the receptiveness of the patient; the more\nreceptive the patient, the more active my own organic centres.\nDr. Fillebrown next describes his power of entering at will into a\nstate of quiescence, preparatory to going to sleep at night, during\nwhich he experiences what are known as \u201c hypnagogic hallucinations.\u201d\nLike most persons who have these experiences, he \ufb01nds that the\nimages seen appear to arise spontaneously\u2014as ordinary dreams do\u2014\nwithout any effort of will on his part.\n(2) Within the past few years I have acquired the art of voluntary\nrepose, especially as a preparation for sleep at night. Latterly I have\nbeen much interested and entertained by experiences similar to those\ndescribed in crystal gazing. As I nearly approach the condition of ordinary\nsleep, I realise that I have given up all voluntary control over the action of\nmy mind, and am able with my mental vision to see a panorama passing\nbefore me: birds, animals, human faces and forms, and landscapes, some\ngrotesque, others beautiful. This does not seem to be the imagination at\nall, but entirely outside of my mental action. The pictures gradually fade\naway, as I pass into the state of profound sleep.\nDr. Fillebrown\u2019s last note affords another instance of the e\ufb02icacy\nof popular beliefs as an aid to self-suggestion. Our readers will\nremember Mr. Coghill\u2019s interesting account in the July Journal S.P.R.\nof other more recent cases of the cure of warts by suggestion.\n(3) Some \ufb01fty years ago, when I was a lad about twelve or thirteen years\nold, a score or two of warts appeared upon my hands, some of them very\nlarge, and continued there for a long time\u2014a year or more, as I remember.\nActuated by boyish curiosity, I stole a piece of fresh meat from the carcass\no a lamb, killed and dressed that day, and rubbed it over my hands, taking\npains to touch every wart. I buried the meat, and, in about the time it\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [00~r., 1899.\nwould take for the meat to decay, the warts disappeared completely from\nmy hands, and none have appeared since.\nIn connection with this last note, we may quote a case of a similar\ncure experienced by Mr. Charles Boyd Robertson (son of the late\nRev. F. W. Robertson, of Brighton) at the age of about seven or\neight. The account was sent to us by an Associate of the Society,\nMiss Frances M. Charlton, having been obtained by her from Mr\nRobertson\u2019s daughter, who writes :\u2014\n38, Onslow Square, June 27th, 1899.\nDEAR MIss CHARLToN,\u2014My father has been very poorly and con\ufb01ned to\nhis room for some time, so he has asked me to answer your letter.\nHe says that the account you give of his \u201c warty\u201d experiences is quite\nexact, and he has really very little to add. He was about 7 or 8 at the time\nof the incident and was staying in the country, near Brighton. The woman\nwas a wandering fortune-teller and, as far as his memory serves him, the\ntree from which she cut the stick was either a hazel or an elder. He\nbelieves she did not touch him with it, but only waved it over his hands,\nwhich were at the time covered with warts, the growth of some months.\nThey disappeared in a few days.\nG. RoRmvTsoN.\nCASES.\nAmong the information collected for the Census of Hallucinations\nof which a Report was published in the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. X.,\nthere were indications that a tendency to externalise ideas in the\nform of hallucinations\u2014visual or auditory, or both\u2014occasionally runs\nin families, or is to a certain extent hereditary (op. cit. pp. 154459).\nIt was further suggested in that Report (p. 338, foot-note) that\n\u201chaunted houses \u201d may sometimes owe their reputation to a family\ntendency of this kind, since it is often found that when apparitions\nare seen more than once in \u201c haunted houses,\u201d the seers are members\nof the same family.\nThe narratives that follow seem to exemplify this family tendency\nor faculty. It will be noticed that while some of the hallucinations\ndescribed show no traces of any but a subjective origin, others\u2014\nespecially the apparition of Miss D., seen collectively by three\nmembers of the family\u2014appear to be veridical.\nThe accounts \ufb01rst given were sent by Mr. Elliott O\u2019Donnell, of\nHenley House School, Mortimerroad, Kilburn, N.W.

Worcester, and Chaplain to\nthe late Lord Kingsdown.\nMy father, who was the direct descendant (pedigree in hands of my\nbrother, Captain Henry O'Donnell, Royal Staff College) of Red Hugh, left\nEngland at the commencement of 1873 in company with the Rev. X., an\nold friend of his. Their destination was to be Jerusalem, a visit long\ncherished by my father, but, unfortunately, he fell in with a man [here]\ndesignated by the name Colonel Y., afterwards proved to be a member of\nthe Weymouth swindling gang. Persuaded by this individual to alter his\ncourse, he accompanied him to Massowah, leaving the Rev. X. to go on by\nhimself.\nOn April 3rd my father went hunting, leaving the little village of Achibo\nin the company of several natives and\u2014so we believe\u2014his white comrade,\nColonel Y. The exact manner of his death has never been ascertained,\nbut it was suggested by various inhabitants of Massowah that he was\nmurdered.\nNow for the ghostly part of the narrative.\nMy father, shortly before leaving England, was heard by one Fanny\nColdwell, then and now cook in our house, to say that if anything happened\nto him on his travels, he would let my mother know. My mother, being a\nnervous and superstitious lady, begged him not to say such things, where\nupon he 1eplied that he would not appear to her, but would make a horrible\nnoise in the house ; this he said laughingly. From the time of his death to\nthe end of the following May, every night at twelve o\u2019clock, a terrible dis\nturbance took place in the hall, sounds as if the furniture was being thrown\nabout being distinctly heard, together with a tramping upstairs. Moreover,\nthe re\ufb02ection as of a lighted candle was seen under the crack of the nursery\ndoor, which, although bolted, was thrown violently open, and to the\nhorri\ufb01ed inmates some one (whose voice they recognised as that of my father)\nwas heard jabbering incoherently.\nAt the end of January, 1881, my mother died. On the night of the\nburial, at about twelve o\u2019clock, the servants distinctly heard some one (whose\nstep they recognised as hers) walk round and round the middle landing,\npausing outside each door, especially the one within which I lay coughing.\nThen they heard her open the room door where her body had lain, and\nwhich was locked, the key being departed elsewhere, and close it with a\nloud bang, relocking it.\nA few days later the cook, upon running upstairs for something, saw my\nmother looking down at her from the landing above. Scared by the\napparition, she turned and hurried back to the kitchen.\nThese incidents I can vouchsafe as absolutely true, without the slightest\nblemish of exaggerat1on.\nELLIoTT O\u2019DoNNELL.\n\f124\u2018 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Being but a child, I was too curious to know who\nhe was to be really frightened, for although he was ugly and covered\nwith spots (a feature I distinctly remember), I merely regarded him in the\nlight ofa visitor who had come to amuse me. For several moments he peeped\nat me from above and under the bed I have mentioned, accompanying each\naction with a grimace of increasing ferocity that at length frightened me so\nthat I screamed and hid my face under the bedclothes, and when next I\nlooked up he had gone ; nor did I ever see him again.\n\f001-., 1899.] Cases. 125\nOne afternoon in the spring of 1896, as I was riding along the main road\nfrom Wheedon to Daventry, I became aware of the presence of a cyclist in\ngrey who rode slowly ahead of me.

Now here was some one who had sprung\nsuddenly and noiselessly to life. For some distance we continued our\ncourse, until we came up to a large cart which was rattling along in the\ncentre of the thoroughfare, the driver blissfully careless of any one else\u2019s\nwelfare save his own.\nTo my horror my mysterious companion ran with great force right into\nthe back of the cart and disappeared.

It was the\nface of a man, but the hair was long like a woman\u2019s. The parchment-like\nskin was drawn closely over the face and gave a skull-like look to it. The\nmouth, full of great teeth, was twisted in a horrid leer ; but what frightened\nme most was the expression of the eyes. They were so very light and full\nof the most wicked cruelty, as if they existed for the sole purpose of trying\nto terrify a little child like I was then.

I dreamt that my sister had\ncome to me and told me that my father had died under tragic circumstances.\nI said to my housekeeper, \u201c I have had a horrid dream,\" and told her\nthe circumstances. She gave me my cup of tea, left the morning papers\nwith me and went downstairs. She was on the point of telling the parlour\nmaid the dream when she saw my sister pass the window. She exclaimed,\n\" Good gracious, there is Miss Sims ! \u201d and when she went to the door and\nsaw my sister in tears, she feared the worst had happened.\nMy sister then came up into my room and told me that my brother-in-law\nhad died under rather tragic circumstances during the night.

Dream.\nFrom LoRD RoBERTs\u2019 Forty-one Years in India (published in 1897),\nV01. 1., p. 30.\nMy father [General Sir Abraham Roberts, G.C.B.] . . . was then\nclose on seventy, and though apparently active as ever, he was far from\nwell, consequently the doctors strongly urged him not to risk another hot\nweather in India. It was accordingly settled that he should return to\nEngland without delay.\nShortly before his departure, an incident occurred which I will relate for\nthe bene\ufb01t of psychological students ; they may, perhaps, be able to explain\nit, I never could. My father had some time before issued invitations to a\ndance, which was to take place in two days\u2019 time \u2014on Monday, October 17th,\n1853. On the Saturday morning he appeared disturbed and unhappy, and\nduring breakfast he was silent and despondent\u2014very different from his\nusual bright and cheery self. On my questioning him as to the cause, he\ntold me he had had an unpleasant dream\u2014one which he had dreamt several\ntimes before, and which had always been followed by the death of a near\nrelation. As the day advanced, in spite of my efforts to cheer him, he\nbecame more and more depressed, and even said he should like to put off\nthe dance. I dissuaded him from taking this step for the time being ; but\nthat night he had the same dream again, and the next morning he insisted\non the dance being postponed. It seemed to me rather absurd to have to\ndisappoint our friends because of a dream ; there was, however, nothing for\nit but to carry out my father\u2019s wishes, and intimation was accordingly sent\nto the invited guests. The following morning the post brought news of the\nsudden death of the half-sister at Lahore, with whom I had stayed on my\nway to Peshawar.\nThe date of death is not given, but Lord Roberts says in another\npart of the book that the mail-carts along the Grand Trunk Road\nfrom Calcutta to Peshawar\u2014then in course of construction through\nthe Punjab\u2014often travelled at the rate of 12 miles an hour, including\nstoppages. The distance from Lahore to Peshawar as the crow \ufb02ies is\nabout 230 miles. It is probable, therefore, that the death took place\nat about the same time as the dream.\n\fNo. OLXIII.\u2014VoL. IX.

PIPER.\nAn important article by Professor J. H. Hyslop, of - Columbia\nUniversity, under the title \u201cImmortality and Psychical Research,\u201d\nhas recently appeared in an American periodical, called The New\nWorld (Vol. VIII., June, 1899), giving a preliminary account of his\nsittings with Mrs. Piper. We hope before long to be able to publish\nthe full report of these in our Proceedings, and meanwhile give here\na few extracts from this preliminary sketch, which deals only with\ngeneral considerations.\nThe writer begins by showing that, among all the various classes\nof phenomena that have been regarded as evidence of spiritism, only a\nvery limited number can justify their claim to rank as such. He says :\u2014\nPhenomena purporting to be spiritistic, or to prove survival\nafter death, must represent facts that involve the wmity of consciousness and\npersonal identity which we once knew and can verify among the tiring. I do\nnot say or imply that the subject of consciousness cannot survive without a\n\f132 J0m\"na.l of Society for Psycluicotl lfeseu\/rah. [Nov.,1899.\n-\nretention of its memory of the past, but I do say that it will be impossible\nto prove survival without this retention of memory, even though we dis\ncovered evidence of transcendental intelligence. For the soul, if there be\nsuch a thing, might survive with as complete a loss of personal identity, or\nthe sense of it, as is often remarked in the instances of auto-hypnosis, and if\nthis were uniformly the case there would be no possibility whatsoever of\nproving immortality in any form which would satisfy the human race. But\nI shall go farther and maintain that we have no ground to assume even the\nexistence of a soul, that is, a subject other than the brain, until we have\nisolated it in its activity. The problem of the existence and the survival of\na soul go together. Scienti\ufb01c method, with the universal fact that conscious\nness is known only in connection with the bodily organism, unless medium\nistic phenomena be genuine, requires us to suppose that mental action is a\nfunction of the brain and is dissolved with it, if we explain anything at all\nby material processes. Consequently, the only positive assurance that we\ncan ever have of the existence of a soul depends upon the proof of its\nsurvival, and this, as I have asserted, depends upon the retention of a sense\nof personal identity, with the additional fact that communication shall be\npossible. The fact of this communication is at least simulated, and there\nremains only the question whether the contents of the alleged communica\ntions satisfy the evidential conditions of personal identity, while they\nexclude the toleration of any other hypothesis than survival.\nSpeaking of the trance-utterances of Mrs. PiperJ he says :\u2014\nAfter \ufb01nding that I had to dismiss both conscious and unconscious fraud\nfrom my judgment of the phenomena, and after reading the reports with the\nutmost care, I felt that possibly the evidence for the spiritistic theory might\nstill be largely weakened by suggestion from the sitters, and possibly\nsomewhat by illusions of interpretation applied to the incidents. I was\nconvinced that telepathy was necessary to explain some of them, even if\nsuggestion did account for a part of the record, and if spiritism was not to\nbe accepted. My supposition was based upon a misunderstanding of the\nperfection of the record itself, as the early reports were admittedly imperfect\nand open to quali\ufb01cation from suspicion of this sort. Hence I arranged for\nsittings myself, which I conducted under conditions that completely excluded\nillusion and suggestion on my part and fraud on the part of the medium. I\ncannot detail the conditions here, but shall do so in my report, but they\nadmit fraud only on the part of Dr. Hodgson and myself, and the facts\nobtained in the experiments were such that I unhesitatingly assert that I\nshall have to bear the brunt of all the suspicion on that account. For\nmyself, then, I am reduced to a choice between telepathy and the spiritistic\ntheory to explain the phenomena, and, for the present at least, I prefer the\nspiritistic view, or, perhaps more respectably stated, the claim that the\nimmortality of the soul has come within the sphere of legitimate scienti\ufb01c\nbelief.\nThe peculiarity of the Piper phenomena is that they unquestionably\nsimulate the scienti\ufb01c demand that spiritism, if true, [should] produce\nevidence of personal identity in cases of alleged communications between\n\fNov., 1899.] Pr'0fess0o' Hye-lop on Mrs. Piper. 133\ndiscarnate and incarnate minds. The phenomena are particularly rich in\nthis characteristic, assuming every phase of mental traits with which any\none is familiar in a friend, and that crop up here across the con\ufb01nes of the\ngrave\u2014little tricks of word or language, of emotional expression, of moral\ntaste and habit, and in fact almost every feature of likeness and unlikeness\nwhich we remark between men as we know them. The most striking facts\nare those incidents by which we should instantaneously identify their\nsource if they purported to come from a friend in life, often such as would\nrequire no cumulative character to sustain their conclusiveness. These are\nmultiplied with wearisome repetition and variation, and in so intimate and\nunexpected a form as well as content, bafiiing all suspicion of the possibility\nof fraud, and so speci\ufb01c in their nature that it requires the most\nextraordinary theories to account for them. The narrative, of course,\nis an interrupted one, with features in it that are calculated to suggest the\nutmost suspicion in the interpretation of the case, though, if it were not\nfor the necessity of allowing for telepathy and unconscious fraud in the\nsupernormal action of secondary personality, scepticism would hardly have\nany standing at all. But there are immense quantities of incoherence and\nof dubious matter, not necessarily false or contradictory, but thoroughly\nopposed to all our orthodox ideas of clear consciousness in another existence,\nthough it may be unwarranted on our part either to have any ideas on this\nmatter or to suppose that the phenomena attest anything whatsoever in\nregard to the real conditions of a transcendental life. But these incoherences\nhave to be mentioned as a warning to the general reader, who might be led\nby the spirit of the present article to expect more from the reports than he\nwill \ufb01nd, without an adequate knowledge of the conditions and di\ufb02iculties\nthat must necessarily attend anything like a communication between two\nworlds. If it took the best resources of science and mechanical art to achieve\nthe telephone and to discover the Riintgen rays, we must not be surprised if\nthe early attempts to test the genuineness of phenomena purporting to\nconnect the present with an immaterial existence are atteIIded with much\nthat must labour under the suspicions of pathology. But this way of\nspeaking savours too much of an apology for the case, which it is not my\nmain purpose to make. The important fact to know and admit is that the\nevidence for immortality, such as it is, represents precisely that type of\nincidents actually in the lives of the two persons supposed thus to be\ncommunicating across the boundaries of two worlds, which forces the\nasumption of supernormal acquisition of knowledge, and so completely\nsatis\ufb01es the requirements of testimony for personal identity that there seems\nno way to explain the phenomena but to accept some gigantic hypothesis\nwhich is not vitiated by any of the incoherences observed. Were we dealing\nwith the generalities and incoherences of ordinary automatism, we should\nhave an easy problem before us. But this is not the case. The amazing\nnumber of speci\ufb01c incidents that can be proved to have been the experiences,\nthoughts, and actions of the alleged communicator and of him alone, in\nconnection with the sitter, is so overwhelming in its character that no\nstudent can refuse it the merit of ful\ufb01lling, in its external features at least,\nthe demands of scienti\ufb01c proof for immortality. . .\n\f134 Journal of Society for P.syclrival Res-em'ch. [Nov., 1899\nProfessor Hyslop observes that the only alternative hypothesis is\nto assume an amazing extension of the power of obtaining knowledge\nby telepathy from the minds of living persons, whether present or\nabsent. But, he says :\u2014\nIn the case under consideration, which has created so much interest,\nthe use of telepathy to account for it involves two tremendous consequences\nThe \ufb01rst is the capacity of the medium, all unconsciously, to transcend the\nknowledge of the sitter and to reach out anywhere into the world, discover\nthe right person, and select speci\ufb01c facts iII the life of the deceased person\nwho is alleged to be the comlnunicator, facts that have generally to be\nveri\ufb01ed by those who knew, and perhaps could know, nothing about them.\nThe second is the almost in\ufb01nite selective and discriminative power of the\nmedium\u2019s subliminal between the knowledge and memories belonging only\nto the sitter\u2019s own life and those memories of the sitter which represent\nalso the experience of the alleged communicator.\nThe rest of the article consists of further discussion of these\ndi\ufb02iculties of the telepathic interpretation.\nCASES.\nFrom Mrs. A. W. Verrall, of Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge.\nP. 264 (I-)\nThe following is an account of the apparent ful\ufb01lment of a premoni\ntion experienced by Mrs. A. W. Verrall. Our readers will observe that\nthe case is unusually well authenticated, since it was not only recorded\nat the time it occurred, but the record was entrusted to the Hon.\nSecretary of the Society before ascertaining whether any external\nevent corresponded to the percipient\u2019s impression or not. The value\nof our evidence in general would be greatly increased if all our\nwitnesses would follow the example thus set.\nWith regard to the impression itself, it is possible that the ticking\nsound may have been an illusion rather than a hallucination; but\nMrs. Verrall has, as she relates, heard it several times, and tried in\nvain to discover any material source for it, while on each occasion it\nhas appeared to be a supernormal indication of some external event,\neither contemporary or future.\nAn impression of this vague kind affords, of course, weaker\nevidence of supernormal faculty than such de\ufb01nite phenomena as\nhallucinatory visions or voices. But the particular form here taken\nwas probably due to shaping by the percipient\u2019s subconscious self.\nMrs. Verrall traces its origin to her having as a child heard the\n\u201cdeath-watch \u201d ticking shortly before a death in her family, and being\ntold at the same time of the superstition connected with it, which\nmade at the time a deep impression on her mind.\n\fNov., 1899.] Cases. 135\nThe incident is described in the following letters addressed to\nMr. Myers :\u2014 '\n(1)\n5, Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge,\n[Tuesday] September 20th, 1898, 3 p.m.\nDEAR MR.

It comes usually,\nif not always, when I am lying down, and may be due to some physical\ncause ; but it has at least once been associated with the illness of a friend,\nso I make a point of noting it, and I suppose the stamp of the post is\ndesirable.\nBut absit omen! M_ DE G_ VERRALL.\nMr. Myers notes on this letter:\u2014\u201c Received September 20th,\n1898; 8.30 p.m.\u201d\n(2)\nSeptember 22nd, 1898.\nI am sure you will be interested to hear that something has happened,\u2014\nand glad with me that it is apparently nothing serious. As a fact I don\u2019t\nyet know what it is ! But at 7.30 to-night I got a telegram from my sister\nat Caen to say \u201cArrived safely, both well.\" Now my sister was to have\ncrossed yesterday to Ouistreham and gone on to-day to Falaise. I had a\ncomplete list of addresses for her (during a short bicycle tour which she is\nmaking with a friend) yesterday morning. Indeed the fact that I heard\nfrom her on Wednesday and had no telegram had made me regard her and\nmy father as outside the risk.\nSomething then, as you see, has gone wrong with her. I have never had\na telegram from her from abroad in my life,\u2014so that I am sure that some\nthing has happened which she thinks I may hear of before knowing of her\nsafety.\nWhen I do hear, I will let you know. But I shall be in no hurry to hear\nthat ticking again! Next time things may be worse.\nWhen I have this story complete, I will send you a \u201creport\u201d on the\nticking, if I have not already done so. I have never been able to decide\nwhether it was prognostic\u2014really a warning of trouble to come\u2014or\ntelepathic, conveying to me the anxiety of some other person. This case\nmay settle it (in my mind), for if some accident occurred yesterday or\nto-day to my sister, I do not think telepathy could inspire me with alarm on\nTuesday\u2018 M. na G.

It was all the affair of a very few minutes, and nothing could have\nbeen kinder than bystanders when I was hauled up.\u201d She goes on to say\nthat she is none the worse, and adds, \u201c Please send this to lllay. I wired to\nher a message to show we were all right, in case some English paper might\nhave got hold of the story.\u201d\nSo you see the whole thing is very complete. After the warning to me,\na distinctive accident to my sister\u2014that might easily have been very serious\n\u2014and a prompt message of reassurance from her to me. I think she must\nhave had some inkling of my anxiety, for the chance of my hearing alarming\nnews was small. On the other hand, though we are not a nervous family,\nwe do telegraph if we think others may be alarmed. I myself once, being\nin a slight railway accident. telegraphed home at once.\nIt seems to me that this story disposes of the \u201c telepathic\u201d explanation\nof my ticking, as I heard it about forty hours [really about thirty-two\nhours, see below] before the accident to my sister. . . . .\nI have kept the telegram and the letter from my sister with my father\u2019s\nline enclosing it. M DE G VERPALL\nMrs. Verrall adds later the following correction as to the date of\nher sister\u2019s accident :\u2014\nThe accident was on the Wednesday night, about 10 or 11 p.m. I was\nmistaken at the time as to the hour the boat left Newhaven. I thought it was\na night boat, but it left at four o\u2019clock and reached Ouistreham about\n10 p. nI.\nMrs. Verrall made a note of her experience at the time, which gives\na fuller description of it than her letter to Mr. Myers, as follows :\u2014\n[Copy of Note.]\u2014\u201cSeptember 20th, 1898, 2.30 p.m. As I was lying\ndown on the sofa in the study just now, I heard suddenly on my left a\nrapid, not perfectly regular, ticking\u2014like a watch in the drawer of the\ntable, but faster. I could hear at the same time the study clock and\nmy watch, both slower. I took off my watch, and afterwards took it\nout of the room, but the ticking continued. I cannot hear it sitting at\nthis table, but it is very distinct when I lie on the sofa\u2014and rather\nalarming or disturbing perhaps\u2014it sounds excited.\n\u201c3 p.m. At 2.45 I lay down again, but there was no more ticking.\u201d\n\u2014[End of Note.]\nShe adds on August 2nd, 1899 :\u2014\nThe ticking is faster than a watch, and less regular\u2014louder than a\nwatch, but not so loud as a clock. It has usually been on my left side, and\nsounds as if an irregularly ticking watch lay on a table. On one occasion,\nat least, it was on the right. I have heard it with other people in the room,\nas well as when I have been alone. On one occasion another person heard\nit, on my drawing attention to it. On that occasion we both heard it grow\nfainter till it ceased.

The great danger was being\nsucked beneath the ship and I had in fact to my own consciousness gone\nunder, when the boatswain, who had heard the splash and clambered down\nthe sides of the boat, put his arm round my waist and I stretched mine\nround his. Immediately after, a rope was lowered and I climbed up it hand\nover hand, soon getting my head out of water ; then a man from above\nseized my cloak, another \ufb02ung a noosed rope, which they put round me and\nthey hauled me up.

Again, if in the \ufb01rst\ninstance I had fallen forward instead of merely stepping off the edge and\ngoing in feet foremost, I should either have sulfered from the contact with\nthe water some two yards below me, or been suffocated. Of course I knew\nthe dangers perfectly well. First, it might be that no one knew I had gone\nover. That is why I shouted. The people on the shore say they heard, but\nthe sailor not,\u2014he was guided simply by the splash. Then, after I was\ndrawn under the ship, I did not see how I was to be got at. But I fancy\nthis was only in process, and even to my thought the space of time seemed\nwonderfully short. Poor B. thought it long enough. She saw a crowd press\nforward and heard \u201c quelqu\u2019un a tomb\u00e9 \u00e0. l\u2019eau,\u201d and when she called out to\nme and had no answer, she knew it must be I.

It was after seeing him and the mate that we decided\nto send wires, because they spoke of it as so very near a fatal accident,\nand almost certain to be copied from the French into the English\npapers.\nL. 1117.\nOn another occasion when Mrs. Verrall heard the same ticking\nsound, it appears to have been telepathic,\u2014coinciding with the illness\nof a friend. This time the ticking was not noted immediately, but was\nnoted before she had any news of the illness. It was, moreover, noted\non the very day on which her sister had written to tell her of the\nillness, so that her sister\u2019s thinking of her may possibly have induced\nher to make the note, which she had forgotten to do at the time.

Corbet.\nThe account of Professor Barrett\u2019s investigation of this case \ufb01rst\nappeared in the Journal for December, l895, and was reprinted in\nthe last number of the Proceedings (Part XXXV., p. 234).\nAfter the publication of the Proceedings, Dr. I. \\V. Heysinger, an\nAssociate of the American Branch of the Society, wrote to the\nSecretary of the Branch to draw attention to a very incorrect version\nof the same case which had appeared in a letter in The English\nJlleohanie of September 9th, 1898, with the signature \u201cA Fellow of\nthe Royal Astronomical Society \u201d (which,\u2014following the example of the\nmagazine,\u2014we shorten below into \u201c F. R. A, S.\u201d).\nAs this is one of those cases in which \u2014apparently as a result of\nwide publicity\u2014numerous myths have accreted round the original and\nauthentic story, it seems worth while to give publicity to a denial of\nsome of the mythical addenda. The following is the incorrect version\nreferred to by Dr. Heysinger (op. cit, p. 92, Letter No. 41,461) :\u2014\nIn Letter 41,252 (on p. 500 of your last volume) I criticised very freely\na curious narrative which you had reproduced on p. 447, under the style\nand title of \u201cTelepathy in Cornwall.\u201d I now propose to tell a quasi-ghost\nstory of my own which is equally extraordinary, and shall be glad if my\nbrother readers and correspondents will comment on it in a similar spirit,\nespecially should any one of them succeed in giving a rational explanation\nof a very remarkable occurrence indeed. I may say, at the outset, that I\nshall use algebraical symbols for the names of the people concerned in this\nstrange affair, as it is, in one sense, a somewhat painful and unpleasant\nstory, and, of course, those mixed up in it, from their social rank and\nposition, are necessarily averse to appear in connection with such a matter.\nI have, however, given the names in private to our Editor for his own\nsatisfaction. To proceed, then, at once, with my tale.\nIn the year 189\u2014 there died at his seat in S shire a nobleman, whom\nI will call Lord X. At the time of his death his two daughters, the\nHonourable Mrs. Y. and Lady Z., were both in the house. Now, the\nfavourite sitting-room of the family was the library, and on the day of the\nfuneral one of the sisters said to the other: \u201cWe have been so happy in\nthis room that, before we leave it for good. we will take a photograph of\nit \u201d ;\u2014which, to shorten my story, as a matter of fact, she (or rather her\ndaughter) did. Fpon developing the negative, to her horror this lady found\na partial image of a man seated in an otherwise empty armchair, and at\nonce, with her sister, recognised it as that of their father I She and her sister\nwere so shocked and stupe\ufb01ed at this result that they determined to keep\nthe matter secret. They, however, printed one or two positives from the\nnegative, and so the story leaked out among their friends : and it is after a\ncareful examination of one of these prints that I have determined to tell\nthe tale here, with a view to its possible elucidation. The library is a very\nlarge room, with the walls covered with books. There are no portraits\u2014or\n\f140 Journal of Sm:i.ety_fwr P8}\/cluicrtl Itesewrch. [Nov., 1899.\nanything analogous\u2014in it, whose re\ufb02ection might have formed a spurious\nimage. The right-hand side of the sitting \ufb01gure is certainly the more\ndistinct of the two; the face in the positive not being very well de\ufb01ned.\nThe right shoulder and arm resting on the arm of the chair are, however,\nperfectly clear and distinct, and the right hand, which I have just been\nexamining with a magnifying glass, is as sharply de\ufb01ned as is that with\nwhich 1 am writing these lines. One extraordinary coincidence, identifying\nthis imperfect image with that of the deceased peer, I purposely suppress,\nas its mention would almost certainly lead to his identi\ufb01cation. I can\nattempt no explanation of this whatever. It seems to me\u2014a practical\nphotographer\u2014absolutely inexplicable. Perhaps, though, some one or\nmore of my brother readers may be more fortunate in \ufb01nding a solution.\nI have simply given the facts as stated to me. I have myself certainly no\ntheory to account for them. I may perhaps add, it may be needlessly, that\nI have personally not the very slightest faith in ghosts.\nIn answer to letters in the same magazine, suggesting various\npossible explanations of the case, \u201cF. R. A. S.\u201d writes further (op. cit,\np. 138) :\n. The interpretation of the personality of the (partial) \ufb01gure in the\nchair is not mine, but that of the own daughters of the man. . . . The\nsisters had lived in the house for a long time. No, they had not previously\nphotographed the room. It was only when they were leaving it for good and\nall that they thought that they should like a memento of the scene of much\npast happiness. The plate belonged to the lady who took the photograph.\nThe chair shows more or less through the left-hand moiety of the \ufb01gure,\nand no legs are visible, the chair front being perfectly distinct there Had\nany one sat down in the chair for a trick his legs must have been distinctly\nvisible. . . . The room was lighted by brilliant sunshine.\nThe \ufb01gure is dark and shadowy, while parts of the chair are well lighted\nI have myself seen many so~called \u201c spirit-photographs,\u201d but the imposture\nand the mode of its perpetration were at once visible on inspection.\nAgain, after examining a new print of the photograph, he writes\n(op. cit, p. 233) :\u2014\nThe supposition that the \ufb01gure seated in the chair had its origin in a\nblemish in the plate . . . is an utterly untenable one. The face, the\nshirt-collar, arm and hand, with the \ufb01ngers and the projecting thumb, are so\nabsolutely distinct as to preclude the possibility of this ; and I am driven to\nthe conclusion that some one must have sat in the chair for a very short time\nduring the exposure of the plate. VVhat, however, continues to puzzle me\nis that Mrs. Y. and Lady Z. strenuously deny that any one entered the room\nduring the time that they were taking the photograph. . . . They were\nso frightened at the result of what they had done that for some considerable\ntime they kept it to themselves.\nAmongst a mass of irrelevant discussion of how the photograph\nmight have been produced, had the circumstances been totally\n\fNov., 1899.] Case of Supposed S'pirt't-Photography. 141\ndifferent from what they were, occurs the following practical suggestion\n(op. cit., p. 238), based on actual observation of a print :\u2014\nI have not the least doubt that the apparent \u201cspirit \u201d is due to\nthe re\ufb02ection of light from the large brass standard upon the dark back\nground of the armchair. The \u201c spirit \u201d head is exactly in the right position\nfor a beam of light re\ufb02ected from the cup-shaped top, and the rest is due\neither to re\ufb02ection froin the shaft or polished bosses. ' If the light was the\nsame and the chair and brass standard in the same place, the \u201cspirit\u2019\ncould be photographed at any time.\nT. E. EsPIN.\nTow Law, R.S.O., co. Durham, October 14th.\nThis hypothesis is discussed by \u201c F. R. A. S.\u201d on p. 280, and \ufb01nally\nrejected. He suggests, however, that Mr. Espin should try whether\nhe can reproduce the effect or anything like it experimentally, and in\naccordance with this suggestion, Mr. Espin writes later (p. 371) :\u2014\nI have tried it in miniature with a toy armchair in a box, and a candle\nand various round silver and brass re\ufb02ectors, and the results have been such\nthat I feel pretty con\ufb01dent that the brass standard in the photograph\nis really the cause of the phenomenon. In one position, with a small\nsilver cup beaten out of a Spanish double doubloon, I got a kind of a\nhead, and, by inclining a cup, a semi-circle of light which fairly well\nrepresented the arm. I have this morning tried the same experiments\nwith sunlight in place of a candle, and have got the same effects, only\nmore pronounced, and those to whom I have shown them quite realise\nthe similarity of the phenomena. The \u201carms\u201d of the \ufb01gure can be\nwell obtained if the light is admitted through a slit, and by moving the\nslit one arm can be obtained without the other.* The \u201chand\u201d each\nphotographer I have shown it to agrees with me is only a \ufb02aw in the\nplate; there are several others, especially on the ceiling of the room.\nThere are some other curious points about the photograph. There is a\nsmall ornamental chair in the centre, and the back legs are transparent;\nalso a book can be seen through the back. There is a large table, the\nleg of which is transparent. Each of these objects presents the appearance\nof the hand when looked at through a feather- when (by diffraction in this\ncase) there is an appearance very similar to an X-ray picture. The\n\u201chand\u201d under a magni\ufb01er seems to show \ufb01ve \ufb01ngers and three thumbs,\nand a plant close to is doubled. Does \u201cF. R. A. S.\u201d know anything\nabout the conditions of the light at the time? I am inclined to suspect\nthat the photo was taken with a long exposure on a dark day.\nT. E. EsPIN.\nTow Law, R.S.O., co. Durham, N01-ember 21st.\nOn p. 370 \u201c F. R. A. S.\u201d writes again :\u2014\nI have nowhere stated that it was from a peculiarity in the hand that the\nimage was identi\ufb01ed as that of the deceased peer. I very studiously\navoided even hinting at the nature of the coincidence. which seemed to me\nso remarkable. . . . . There was no portrait whatever, either photo\ngraphic or in oils or water-colour, of Lord X. in the library when the\npicture was taken. . . . . It would be impossible, after this lapse of\ntime, to say whether there was or was not a pinhole in the camera.\n* \\Ve hope to obtain further information about these experiments.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov.,1899.\nOn page 417 \u201c F. R. A. S.\u201d says :-\u2014\n\u201c A. S. L.\u201d (Letter 41,850, p. 394) is absolutely correct in his surmise\nthat no re\ufb02ection from a lamp standard could ever have produced the\npeculiarity to which I referred, inasmuch as that pecuharity took the form\nof a p7\"ii.\u2018G.ti0it.\nNow, comparing the \ufb01rst-hand narrative of Miss Corbet with\n\u201c F. R. A. S.\u2019s \u201d version, we see that the latter is incorrect with regard\nto the following particulars :\n(l) The nobleman designated by \u201cF. R.A. S.\u201d as \u201cLord X.\u201d (and\nby Miss Corbet as \u201cLord D.\u201d), did not die \u201cat his seat in S shire\u201d\n(which Miss Corbet calls \u201c D. Hall \u201d), but in London, D. Hall being at\nthe time let to Miss Corbet\u2019s sister, Lady S.\n(2) \u201cLord X\u2019s\u201d daughters were not at D. Hall at the time of his\nfuneral.\n(3) The photograph was not purposely, but accidentally, taken on\nthe day of the funeral.\n(4) Neither \u201cLord X.\u2019s\u201d daughters nor any of his relatives had\nanything to do either with the taking or developing of the photograph.\n(The photograph was, however, shown to his family, and it was with\ntheir full consent that Miss Corbet\u2019s account of the whole incident\nwas published by us).\n(5) \u201cLord X.\u2019s \u201d daughters did not, as \u201cF. R. A. S.\u201d asserts,\n\u201cstrenuously deny that any one entered the room during the time\nthat they were taking the photograph,\u201d for the obvious reason that\nthey had nothing to do with it. The inaccuracy is a serious one,\nsince it makes the evidence for spiritistic agency appear stronger than\nit really is. The weakest point in that evidence is the fact that, as\nMiss Corbet informed us, the door of the room was left open all the\ntime the photograph was being taken, the camera being placed in the\nopen doorway, while she and her sister went out for a walk, apparently\nleaving the house empty, except for the servants.\nThe discrepancies between \u201c F. R.A.S.\u2019s\u201d account and Miss Corbet\u2019s\n\ufb01rst-hand one are so serious as almost to suggest that the two accounts\ndo not refer to the same incident. But, as Dr. Heysinger observes :\u2014\nIf it is not the same case, then the coincidences are more remarkable\nthan anything appropriate to the same title in this July Proceedings, while\nif they are the same, then there is a mass of misstatement, false suggestion,\nand error running through the whole which is simply inexplicable to me, for\nthe articles in the English magazine, many of them, are by eminent men of\nscience (Professor Espin, for example), who claimed to have knowledge at\n\ufb01rst-hand.\nAny lingering doubt, however, as to whether the two cases were\nthe same has been dispelled by \u201c F. R. A. S.\u2019s \u201d informing us in\ncon\ufb01dence that the real name of the deceased nobleman was the same.\nl)r. Heysinger makes the very natural assumption that a sc-ienti\ufb01c\nman would not print statements of the kind given above except at\n\ufb01rst-hand,\u2014especially when he prefaces them by a reference to an\nalleged case of telepathy which he had criticised on the ground\n\fNov., 1899.] Correspondence. 1 43\nthat it was related at third-hand. It will be noticed, however, that\n\u201cF. R.A.S.\u2019s\u201d present narrative only professes to be \ufb01rst-hand so far\nas the description of the photograph, which he himself examined, is\nconcerned. He now informs us that he had the story and photograph\nfrom a certain gentleman, whose name he gives, and who was a\ncommon friend of himself and some of the relatives of \u201cLord X.\u201d\nThis gentleman\u2019s account cannot be nearer than second-hand, since he\nwas not one of the witnesses of the incident; so that \u201c F. R. A. S\/s \u201d\nversion of his account is at least third-hand, and may be more remote.\nWhen we know this, it is hardly necessary to look further for the\ncause of the numerous inaccuracies observed. Those who have had a\nlittle practice in comparing \ufb01rst-hand with more remote accounts,\nespecially of incidents with any savour of the supernatural about\nthem, will probably not be surprised at the amount of incorrectness\nto be found in this instance; while those who are sometimes\ndisposed to cavil at the caution of our Society in refusing almost\ninvariably to treat even second-hand accounts as of any evidential\nvalue, may see here an instructive example of the result of relaxing\nsuch precautions.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions errpressed by C01-i'espondents.]\nA FALsE ALARM.\nMr. F. C. S. Schiller writes from Oxford :\u2014\nCorpus Christi College, Oxford, ()ctobe'r 22nd, 1899.\nThe readers of the Daily Chronicle of October 4th must have been shocked\nand startled to \ufb01nd in it a \ufb01nely \u201cscare-headed \u201d sensational and circum\nstantial account of how certain \u201cSalvation Army Lasses\u201d in Oxford had a\ndisastrous encounter with a female apparition, which issued from a wall and\neasily walked through their line of battle. The result of the engagement\nwas that, of the Salvation Army\u2019s forces, one was left \u201c in strong convulsions\nand the other in a dead faint,\u201d while the third was left capable of contri\nbuting to the Chronicle.\nThe \u201c ghost \u201d apparently escaped unscathed.\nThe (\u2018hronicle\u2019s account concludes by stating that \u201c the sad part of the\nstory is that one young lady has since gone raving mad from the effects of\nthe fright, and the other died a few days ago from the same cause.\u201d\nHere, apparently, was a most unusual case of ghostly audacity combined\nwith a ferocity worthy of the worst traditions of the nursery, which was\nsaid to have ended in the defeat of a corps d\u2019\u00e9lite of the Salvation Army,\npresumably well adapted to cope with spiritual foes of all sorts. The case\nseemed suspicious, but eminently deserving of the S.P.R.\u2019s attentions.\nAccordingly, when my attention was called to the story and I had been\nrequested by a friend to look into it, I proceeded to inquire of the editor\nof the Daily Chrowlcle whether he could give me any further information,\neither about his Oxford correspondent or about the surviving heroine of the\ntale. The editor replied that he was \u201cunable to give any further infor\nmation.\u201d I then addressed an inquiry to the \u201cCommanding O\ufb02icer of the\n\f1414i Jowrnat of Society for Psychical Research.

One only wonders why the Chronicle should have\npublished the tale, and what principle guides the selection of the \u201cnews \u201d\nwhich it purveys.\nF. C. S. SCHILLER.\nA NoTE oN SELF-SUGGEsTIoN.\nDr. Fillebrown\u2019s observations on the ef\ufb01cacy of self-suggestion, as a\nmeans of alleviating pain. remind me of my own experience on the subject.\nSome forty years ago, when a student, I had to undergo a very painful\ntreatment from a hard-hearted surgeon. During a whole fortnight, every\nsecond day, that barbarous man burned deeper and deeper into halfa-dozen\nsores on my leg with lunar caustic, taking plenty of time about it, and, as\nI imagined, enjoying his bit of surgery. The pain was excruciating. After\nthe \ufb01rst days I got ashamed of my want of courage, and remembering that\nthe Stoics of old used to endure pain without \ufb01inching, even to the length\nof denying pain, I thought I would do the same and look on my leg as an\ninsensible log of wood.\nThe result was very wonderful. After two or three attempts I came to\nbe perfectly quiet and unfeeling under the operation. Denying strenuously\nthe pain in\ufb02icted on me, I was not feeling any pain.\nOf course, at that time I knew nothing of self-suggestion and its ef\ufb01cacy.\nEver since, when I have had to undergo a painful operation, such as\nextracting a thorn from my \ufb01nger or having a boil cut open, I have\nexercised the same power of will or imagination, with the same result, com\nplete or partial. And this was peculiarly useful when I have had to submit\nto the extraction of a tooth.\nAge has hardly yet diminished that power of self-suggestion, as I had\noccasion to ascertain last night, when I was so stupid as to burn one of my\n\ufb01ngers severely with handling a red-hot glass tube. In less than three\nminutes the pain was gone, although the \ufb01nger was much swollen and still\nbears to-day the brand of my clumsiness.\nAs a martyr on the stake, could I show to the world a like fortitude?\nWho knows ? But I have doubts on that point.\nAve. GLARDoN.\nTour de Peilz, Vaud, October 5th, 1899.\nCORRECTION.\nMr. Donald Murray asks us to correct an error occurring in the\naccount of a case (L. 1113) contributed by him to the July Journal\n(p. lO4), where he was described as Editor of the Sydney Morning\nHerald.

There\nwere also present Dr. A. \u2018V. Barrett, Professor W. F. Barrett, Mr.\nMontague Crackanthorpe, Mr. C. F. G. Masterman,. Mr. F. W. H.\nMyers, Mr. F. Podmore, Mr. H. Arthur Smith, Mr. J. G'. Smith,\nSir A. K. Stephenson, and Dr. A. Wallace.\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nTwo new Members and three new Associates were elected. The\nelection of eighteen new Associates of the American Branch was\nrecorded. Names and addresses are given above.\nThe Council recorded with regret the decease of Mr. Charles H.\nCousens, and of Miss Anna Swanwick, Associates of the Society.\nSome presents to the Library were reported, which were acknow\nledged with thanks to the donors.\nOn the motion of Mr. Myers, Mr. J. G.

ANDREW LANG was read by\nMR. F. W. H. MYERs, giving recent instances from many parts of the\nworld of the rite of passing through ovens or furnaces, the bare feet\nof the walkers being uninjured by contact with the red-hot stones or\nembers. These cases appeared to be analogous with the alleged\nperformances with \ufb01re of the medium, D. D. Home. In one case,\nColonel Gudgeon, British Resident at Rarotonga, described his own\n\fDEC., 1899.] General illeeting. 147\npassing through the \ufb01re with three other Europeans (one of whom\nwas badly burnt) followed by about 200 Maoris. Another was an\naccount of the Fiji Fire Ceremony, witnessed by Dr. T. M. Hocken\nat Mbenga. The article will shortly appear in full in the next Part\nof the Proceedings.\nTHE CHAIRMAN said that he knew of no chemical or other\npreparation which could be applied to the skin in such a way as to\nprevent the ordinary destructive action of heat on organic matter.\nHe himself had witnessed the performances with \ufb01re of the medium,\nD. D. Home, on two or three occasions. On one occasion, in the\ndrawing4\u2018oom of a lady friend of the speaker\u2019s, Home became\nentranced, went up to the \ufb01re\u2014which was not a coal, but a wood\n\ufb01re\u2014raked it out with his hands, and took up a lump of red-hot\ncharcoal about twice the size of an egg into his hand, on which\ncertainly no asbestos was visible. He blew into his hands and the\n\ufb02ames could be seen coming out from between his \ufb01ngers and he\ncarried the charcoal round the room. One of the persons present\nasked if it would hurt him if he touched it. Home told him he might\ntry ; he did so and found that it did burn him. On the same evening\nthe speaker saw Home put a red-hot coal on a \ufb01ne cambric handker\nchief and carry the handkerchief about. He took possession of the\nhandkerchief immediately afterwards and examined it chemically in\nhis laboratory and found no trace of any chemical preparation on it.\nAt one part there was a small hole burnt, but otherwise it was quite\nunharmed.\nHe remarked that the temperature that the human body could\nstand was limited by the point at which albumen coagulates, namely,\n163 deg. R; if the substance of the body itself got above that\ntemperature, it would be so much injured that death would ensue.\nThe old system of making iron in the puddling furnaces seemed to\nhim to furnish the closest parallel that could be found in ordinary\nexperience to the cases related in Mr. Lang\u2019s paper. Men\u2014naked\ndown to their waists \u2014had to work very close to these furnaces, the\nheat being so great that ordinary persons could not go anywhere near\nthem. The men themselves told him that a beginner could not stand\nthe heat and had to get gradually accustomed to it, and that it took\nthree generations to make a really good puddler. In some of the Fire\nWalk cases it had been suggested that heredity had something to do\nwith the faculty. This did not, however, apply to Home\u2019s case.\nAgain, there are some substances which are almost non-conductors\nof heat. For instance, he had seen a test of a \ufb01re-proof box contain\ning sealing-wax, gunpowder and wax vestas, having been kept in a\n\f148 Jou\/rnal of Society for Ps_y\/c-hicat Reseu\/rah. [DEc.,1899.\nfurnace for an hour and a half. It was red-hot when it came out, but\non being opened, its contents were found to be unaffected by the heat.\nPRoFEssoR W. F. BARRETT said that it was interesting to have\nheard on the highest authority that no known chemical preparation\ncould have protected the feet of the Fire VValkers from serious injury.\nA physical phenomenon had occurred to him which at \ufb01rst sight\npresented a certain analogy to the Fire Walking phenomena. If a\nwhite-hot ball of metal\u2014preferably of copper\u2014be lowered into a\nvessel of water, containing a little soap in solution, it will enter the\nwater without any ebullition of steam, and the ball will remain white-\nhot in the midst of the water for a considerable time. The ball, in\nfact, does not touch the water and the latter remains only slightly\nwarmed, until the temperature of the ball falls below a certain point,\nwhen it comes in contact with the water and violent ebullition ensues.\nThis phenomenon is a remarkable instance of the so-called \u201c spheroidal\nstate\u201d of water; and is really attributable to a repulsive force, dis\ncovered by Sir William Crookes, which occurs when a hot body is\nbrought very near to a cold one,\u2014-the same force, in fact, that moves\nthe vanes of Crookes\u2019 radiometer.\nFor his own part, however, the speaker did not believe that any\nexplanations of this sort could account for the phenomena of the Fire\nWalk, inasmuch as these, if established, seemed to be essentially\npsychical; for they depended for success on the mental state of par\nticular individuals on whom some supernormal power appeared to be\nconferred,\u2014analogous to the power sometimes conferred by hypnotic\nsuggestion, though in this case it would be auto-suggestion. This\nmay possibly be the true psychical basis of that faith which can\n\u201cquench the violence of \ufb01re,\u201d and which has not any necessary\nconnection with a particular form of religion.\nMR. F. W. H. MYERs observed that there seemed to him to be an\nimportant difference between the physiological results brought about\nby suggestion, which meant the stimulation of normal powers, and the\nphenomena described in Mr. Lang\u2019s paper. If this explanation were\nto be applied to the case of the feet of those who walked on the hot\nstones, one would have to assume that suggestion constantly renewed\nthe sole of the foot, which was constantly being destroyed by the \ufb01re.\nThe suggestion would have to be exercised instantly, and on a very\nlarge scale, to produce the effects reported.\nMR. F. W. THURsTAN said that he had witnessed the \ufb01re pheno\nmena of D. D. Home, and had also seen similar performances several\ntimes on the part of a medium named Hopcroft. He had seen the\nlatter go up to a \ufb01re-place, take out red-hot coals from it, and offer\n\fDI;c., 1899.] General Meeting. 14'9\nthem to the persons present. When entranced, he used to hold them\nfor four or \ufb01ve minutes in his hand. As a boy, this medium had been\nconstantly mesmerised and made anaesthetic by suggestion ; he was\nthen often kept in a trance all day long. Later he became a trance\nmedium, and was constantly in trances. He ended his life at last in\nan asylum.\nMR. F. W. PERCIvAL also testi\ufb01ed to the performances with \ufb01re of\nD. D. Home. He said that he had seen Home clear away the black\ncoals from the front of a \ufb01re, get out a red-hot coal from the back and\nput it in his hair, which was \ufb02uify and light. It remained there for\nsome seconds, after which Mr. Percival examined the hair and could\n\ufb01nd no trace of burning in it.\nDR. ABRAHAM WALLACE observed that in occult books, alterations in\nthe interstellar ether had been suggested as the cause of such phenomena.\nMR. MYERs suggested that they might be due to forces somewhat\nanalogous to the imaginary \u201cDemons of Maxwell.\u201d The late Professor\nClark Maxwell, as was well known, had suggested the conception of\nimaginary \u201cDemons,\u201d whose function it was to keep up the energy\nof the cosmos, which was constantly being dissipated by its tempera\nture tending to become equalised everywhere. The \u201c Demons\u201d are\nimagined to keep the hot molecules apart from the cold ones, and so\nprevent the equalisation of temperature.\nA GRNTLRMAN asked if D. D. Home\u2019s power could be put down to\nheredity, and if he had ever walked over or through a \ufb01re.\nTHE CHAIRMAN believed that both questions should be answered in\nthe negative.\nPRoFEssoR W. F. BARRETT then read \u201c A Further Paper on the So\ncalled Divining Rod,\u201d which it is hoped will appear in the next Part of\nthe Proceedings. He said that his general conclusion, based on a study\nof all the evidence which had come under his notice, was that for deep\nwells,\u2014say, over 100 or 200 feet,\u2014he would unhesitatingly back the\nopinion of a good geologist ; but for comparatively shallow wells,\u2014say,\nfrom 10 to 50 feet,\u2014he would as unhesitatingly back a good dowser.\nAfter stating the conditions that were necessary to make experiments\nwith a dowser really evidential, he described in detail a series of experi\nments carried out under his own directions in boring for water at\nspots indicated through the divining rod by the dowser Stone, in a\nmountainous region in the county VVicklow, four miles from Bray.\nAfter Stone had gone, a country gentleman, Mr. J. H. Jones, of VVater\nford, who had had soIne success as an amateur dowser, was asked by\nProfessor Barrett to try over the same ground. He did this, with no\nknowledge of what had been done by Stone, and came practically to the\n\f150 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DI1:c.,1b\u201899.\nsame conclusions. Five different borings were then made, and in every\ncase the predictions of the dowsers were completely veri\ufb01ed. The\naccount of these experiments was illustrated by some excellent dia\ngrams and plans of the ground and borings.\nProfessor Barrett spoke next of experiments tried to test whether\na dowser, when blindfolded, would indicate through the movement of\nhis rod the same spots as when he could see the ground. He said that\nhe himself had not been successful in such experiments, but a good\nmany successes had been recorded by others; the experimenters,\nhowever, had not always realised the necessity of avoiding giving\nunconscious indications to the dowser. He then described some recent\ntrials of the divining rod made at his request in \ufb01nding minerals in\nSomersetshire; these have been carefully reported on by Mr. E.\nWestlake, who superintended the operations, which on the whole\nproved successful. On the other hand, in a series of experiments\ncarried out by Colonel Taylor in trying to detect the whereabouts of\nhidden coins, the successes of the dowser were not more than chance\nmight have produced. The reasons for success in the former oases\n(\ufb01nding water and mineral lodes) and non-success in the latter are\nfully discussed in the paper, which time did not permit the author to\ngive except in brief abstract.\nCASES.\nG. 263. Auditory.\nThis case comes to us through the American Branch of the\nSociety. Dr. Hodgson writes of it:\u2014\nThe following account was sent to me by Miss Lilian Whiting on August\n8th, 1899; a few sentences in further explanation of the case being embodied\nin it a few days later. Miss Whiting has had other psychical experiences,\nand\u2014besides many communications through Mrs. Piper\u2019s trance purporting\nto come from Miss Kate Field, who died in May, 1896,\u2014has received her\nself many impressions apparently coming from Miss Field since the latter\u2019s\ndeath, some of which have been independently corroborated by statements\nthrough Mrs. Piper\u2019s trance. The following incident will probably interest\neven those of our readers who may be disposed to take the view that\nnothing was involved more than Miss Whiting\u2019s subliminal consciousness.\nOther evidence, however, some of which I shall publish in my next Report\non Mrs. Piper, leads me to the conclusion that Miss Whiting does actually\nreceive communications directly from Miss Field, and I think the case\nwhich follows may be an instance of these.\nKate Field\u2019s Washingtmi was a weekly journal well known in the United\nStates, founded and edited by Miss Field during the years 1890495, Miss\nWhiting has been writing a biography of Miss Field. R. H.\n\fDIa:c., 1899.] Cases. 151\nMiss Whiting\u2019s account is as follows :\u2014\nBetween 2 and 3 a.m., August 4th. Kate wakened me, speaking to\nme excitedly about a \u201cletter of Lowell\u2019s\u201d to her. All was confused and\nrapid, but at last I caught clearly: \u201cIn K. F.\u2019s W.\u2014in my Washington,\nLilian; look in my Wash.inghm.\u201d Then I vaguely recalled that Lowell\nhad written her a letter in re International Copyright, which she had\npublished in her journal, and which I had already included in her\nbiography, so I replied to her: \u201cYes, darling, I know-\u2014the letter is in\nthe book. It\u2019s all right.\u201d '\nAgain an excited and rapid speaking, of which I only caught here and\nthere a word, but\u2014partly from impression, and almost impulsion\u2014I rose,\nwent out into my parlour, turned on the electric light, and took the \ufb01ve\nbound volumes of her K. F. \u2019s W. down from my shelves. Half automatically\nI seemed to be guided (for I had totally forgotten its existence) to a letter\nthat Lowell wrote to her in 1879, when he was American Minister to Spain\u2014\nwriting from Madrid, and she in London\u2014and which, on his death, she had\npublished in her Washington.\nMiss Field had been engaged in organising a festival at Stratford-on\nAvon for the bene\ufb01t of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, and had written\nto Mr. Lowell asking if he would not write an original poem for her to recite\non that occasion. His reply was most interesting, relating the obstacles\nthat repelled the Muses, and saying that he was the more sorry not to meet\nher wish, as he had a favour to ask of her,\u2014a request that she would send\nhim her book called Ten Days in Spain. Dr. Westland Marston was then\ninvited to write the poem desired, and Miss Field recited it, opening the'\nfestival on Shakespeare\u2019s birthday. As the original letter was not among\nMiss Field\u2019s MSS., and as I had totally forgotten it (I don\u2019t, even now, recall\nseeing it, though I must have at the time), this very important letter would\nhave been left out of her biography, had she not thus called me and led me\nto it. There was barely time to get [it] in before the \ufb01rst casting of the proofs.\nI went with it myself out to the University Press the next morning to see\nwhere I could now introduce it in the part of proofs not yet cast\u2014as I\ncouldn\u2019t even delay for the mail. Miss Field\u2019s waking me, \u2014her urgent and\nexcited and forcible manner and words, \u2014were just as real to me as would\nhave been [those] of some friend in this world coming to my bedside in the\nnight. L.W.\nL. 1118. Dream.\nThe following account of a veridical dream was sent to us by\nProfessor A. Alexander, of Rio de Janeiro, enclosed in a letter to Mr.\nMyers, dated July 2nd, 1899. Professor Alexander writes concerning\nthe case :\u2014\nTogether with this letter I forward you a veridical dream case. The\ninformants are my neighbours, and I am already intimate with them. Senr.\nEmilio Blum was educated at Paris; he served as a colonel during the\nrevolt, and is now engaged in business in Rio de Janeiro.

The depo\nsitions, which are otherwise quite reliable, prove that about the time of the\naccident. and before any news of it had reached the Blum family, some\nintimation of Dr. Garnier\u2019s mishap was conveyed to Dona Maria in a\ndream. The children were not hurt, as the horses stopped as soon as\nthey reached home. . . . A. ALEXANDER\nProfessor Alexander describes the incident as follows :\u2014\nThe following apparent instance of telepathic clairvoyance occurred\nrecently in Rio de Janeiro among people well known to the collector of the\ncase. The statements of the witnesses having been made with due care,\nthey may be accepted as reliable.\nSenr. Emilio Blum and his family formerly resided at Florianopolis, the\ncapital of the State of Santa Catharina, and were on terms of friendship with\na certain Dr. Garnier, of that town.\nIn the month of April of this year Senr. Blum\u2019s wife, Dona Maria do\nCarmo, was in a delicate state of health, and was much subject to insomnia\nand confused dreaming. On the night presumed to have been that of the\n27th, she fell asleep only after 12 o\u2019clock, and dreamt of her former medical\nattendant. Her statement is the following :\u2014\n\u201c Rio, June 13th, 1899.\n\u201c I declare that on the night between the 27th and the 28th of April of\nthe present year, I dreamt that Dr. Garnier, who was our family doctor when\nwe lived at Florianopolis, had fallen in alighting from a carriage, and had\nbeen much hurt. I had this dream between 1 and 2 o\u2019clock in the morning,\nand on awaking at 7 on the morning of the 28th, being much impressed* by\nit, I related it to my husband.\n(Signed) \u201c MARIA Do CARMo F. BLU1\\I.\u201d\nSo far the dream, which was a distressful one, might well have been\nattributed to the lady\u2019s state of health ; but on the 2nd of May her mother,\nDona Thomazia, arrived from Santa Catharina and informed them that Dr.\nGarnier had really met with a serious carriage accident towards the end of\nApril. Of this she now gives a written account :\u2014\n\u201cRio de Janeiro, June 14111, 1899.\n\u201cI declare that while I was yet in Florianopolis [the following incident\noccurred] : [the horses of] a carriage containing children ran away, the\ncoachman not being on the box. Just at that time Dr. Garnier, accom\npanied by Father Leite, was driving in another carriage to visit the parents\nof the said children. On seeing the children\u2019s carriage with the runaway\nhorses, he alighted with the intention of saving them, and was thrown aside,\nit is supposed, against the bank [and stunned], some time elapsing before he\nrecovered his senses. If I am not mistaken, this occurred in the afternoon\nof the 27th of April of this year. Dr. Garnier was to have embarked with\n* The Portuguese word \u201c impressionada \u201d means emotionally impressecl.\u2014A.A.\n\fDnc., 1899.] Cases. 153\nme for Rio de Janeiro, and did not do so owing to this accident. I started\nfor Rio on the 30th of April, and arrived here on the 2nd of May. My son\nin-law, having come to fetch me on board, asked after various persons in\nSanta Catharina, among others Dr. Garnier, with whom he is friendly. I\nthen told him of the accident, of which he was ignorant. On arriving home\nmy daughter, Maria do Carmo Blum, related to me, more or less in the\nterms of the above declaration. the experience of her dream. It was only\nthen that she was informed by me that her dream was veridical.\nSi ned \u201cTHoMAzIA no VALLR FRAoozA.\u201d\ng\nDr. Garnier, who arrived in Rio at a later date, gives a similar account\nof the above accident :\u2014\n\u201c Rio, June 11th-, 1899.\n\u201c On the 27th of the month of April, 1899, in Florianopolis (capital of\nSanta Catharina) [I], the undersigned, accompanied by Father Joao Nepo\nmuceno Manfredo Leite, was driving between \ufb01ve and six o\u2019clock in the\nafternoon on a professional visit to the residence of Senr. Dr. Hercilio\nPedro da Luz when I saw at some distance behind me a carriage with\nrunaway horses, containing six children and without a coachman, coming in\nthe same direction that we were travelling. In attempting to jump out and\nsave the children, I fell and lost consciousness the result of a concussion of\nthe brain.

In order to calm her, I told her not to attach any\nimportance to it, [saying] that it was nothing more than a dream.

No notes were taken on the\noccasion.\nThe distance that separates Florianopolis from Rio is approximately\n400 nautical miles.\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [DEo.,1899.\nQuestioned as to whether she had had any other similar experiences,\nDona Maria replied that about the beginning of this year she had dreamed\nconfusedly of a sick child and of \ufb02owers and people in mourning. This she\nthinks might have been premonitory, for shortly afterwards, onFebruary\n18th, 1899, a little nephew of hers died in Santa Catharina.\nAlthough quite willing to furnish the above evidence, Dona Maria is in\ngeneral averse to subjects bearing on spiritism.\nProfessor Alexander has sent us the original depositions of the\nwitnesses, written in Portuguese, with translations, kindly furnished\nby himself, which he has incorporated into his narrative.\nG. 264.

It was a moonlight night, the blind\nwas up, and there was stilla \ufb01re burning in the grate. I saw a \ufb01gure stand\ning by the window with its back turned to me, which, as soon as I entered the\nsitting-room, turned round and walked towards me. It was about the middle\nheight and loosely dressed, as I thought in grey. The face was a long clean\nshaven one, cadaverous and at the same time pitiful in expression, and I am\nperfectly con\ufb01dent when I say that I could see right through the \ufb01gure and\ndistinctly saw the bars on the window through it. I was naturally excess\nively frightened and for a second could do or say nothing. Then I turned\ntail and bolted into my bedroom and locked the door and shortly afterwards\nI heard a shut\ufb01ing noise as oi\" some one leaving my room and passing along\nthe passage. I then lit a candle and went into my sitting-room again and\nsaw nothing. I was in a streaming perspiration and yet felt icy cold and\nmy re\ufb02ection in the glass showed my face as white as a sheet. I have\n- not been able to \ufb01nd any explanation of the apparition and did not see\nanything more of it, (though several other men in college had similar experi\nences of it) until Milclmelmas term 1898. Then came my second experience.\nI had been working till eleven and then went to bed. Some time in the\nnight, I cannot say exactly when, I was awakened by a sound in my room\n(I should mention I had changed to different rooms on the same staircase,\non the second instead of on the third \ufb02oor) and I lit a candle and went into my\nsitting-room to see who was there ; for some moments I saw nobody and was\n* Mr. A. afterwards corrected the date to the \u201c Michaelmas term, 1897.\u201d\n\fDsc., 1899.] Cases. 155\ngoing back to bed when I caught sight of a \ufb01gure standing in a corner of my\nroom. It was exactly similar to the one I had seen before, three terms\npreviously ; the face had the same pitiful and mournful-looking expression,\nand it advanced towards me holding out its hands as if it wanted something.\nI remember no more ; I was terribly frightened and fainted right away. I\nwas found by my scout* the next morning, when he came to call me, lying in\nfront of my \ufb01replace with the extinguished candle on the \ufb02oor. I went to\nthe Principal and told him the circumstances, but he was inclined to treat it\nas a joke.'1'\nI can give no explanation of it and can only say that it was a ghastly\nexperience. I knew that a former undergraduate committed suicide on this\nstaircase,j,r about twenty years ago, but do not know if there be any connec\ntion between this and the apparition I saw. Other men have had similar\nvisitations and one man had to go down three weeks before the end of term\nthrough being so much troubled by it. I was genuinely and thoroughly\nfrightened and am perfectly convinced it was a supernatural apparition that\nI saw. The idea of the ghost is looked upon far too seriously in the\nCollege for any one to play a practical joke, and I can only say that another\nsuch visitation would cause me to migrate elsewhere.\nII.\u2014From Mr\u2018. B.\nI am not quite sure about actual dates, etc., but my \ufb01rst experience was\none night in the \ufb01fth week of the October term, 1897. I was a Freshman, and\nhad the ground \ufb02oor room on No. 3 staircase. I had been to sleep for some\ntime and woke up with a very uncomfortable feeling that something was\nwrong. After sitting up and rubbing my eyes the feeling resolved itself\ninto the conviction that some one was looking in [at] my bedroom window. I\nalmost laughed at the idea, for though the window was just over the bed, the\nroom being very small, there was a thick curtain drawn across it, and I put\nit down to imagination and tried to go to sleep again. Failing to do so, I\nresolved to satisfy myself and, getting up, drew the curtain, and was very\nmuch startled to actually see a face gazing straight in. The face was really\nall I could see, and I think had that been the only time I saw it, that I\ncould not have described it, for it appeared to vanish after I had looked at\nit for a very short time. I lit a candle, and after thinking some time, came\nto the natural conclusion that it was somebody who had got into the\nchurchyard immediately outside (though I afterwards found that this\nwould be a very di\ufb02icult matter). I looked at my watch, as I always do\nwhen I wake in the night, and found it was just after 2 o\u2019clock a.m. I said\nnothing about it to any one, and soon was quite satis\ufb01ed in my mind that it\nwas nothing mysterious.\nHowever, two or three nights afterwards, I woke again with the same\nuncanny feeling (and to avoid repetition I might add that the appearances\nwere always accompanied with this horrible or at least very uncomfortable\n* Who con\ufb01rmed this to a member of the S.P.R. in December, 1898.\n1- He is, however, very reluctant to permit any investigations.\n1 Upon consideration the narrator is now doubtful about the identity of the\nstaircase.\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychiwl Resewrch. [Dsc..1899\nfeeling); and sitting up again saw the face, now at the end of my bed,\ngazing straight at me with a very sad expression. I noticed this particularly,\nas I was able to look at it \ufb01xedly for what seemed quite a long time, and\nthis time I observed too that it was possessed by the \ufb01gure of a man, which\nwas too inde\ufb01nite to describe accurately, but he had on what looked like a\nwhite front or ru\ufb02le. The face was rather thin, clean-shaved, and with\nclear-cut features. I also noticed that the hair was short and thin. Perhaps\nI did not notice all this on this occasion, but I \ufb01nd it di\ufb02icult to detach from\neach appearance what I actually saw each time. I reached for my matches\nand struck a light and when my eyes got accustomed to the light, there was\nnothing there.\nNow, nobody could pass out of my room without brushing past me, on\naccount of the size of the room; neither, to my knowledge, is there any\nother exit.\nAfter this the same thing happened two or three times, and I was able to\nsee that the \ufb01gure appeared to be dressed in knee-breeches and stockings of\na dark texture, and each time all it did was to gaze sadly at me. I was\nnever able to challenge it,-\u2014I suppose on account of fright,\u2014and I main\ntained silence on the question until a more curious thing still happened, and\nthis I think was one night in the seventh week of that term.\nYou will notice that up to this time %it was nothing but a visual\nexperience, unaccompanied by noise, and this was gradually tending to\nrestore my nerve, and I slept for several nights without being aroused.\nThe appearances were always at about the same time.\nOne night in the seventh week of term, I think, I was awakened in the\nsame curious manner, and sitting up thought I heard a slight noise in my\nsitting-room. I listened, and it seemed to continue, as though a scu\ufb02ie was\ngoing on, but I certainly felt the noise rather than heard it.\nWhat I mean by this is that the noise seemed to be more suggested to\nme than audible, but whatever it was I reached out of bed and pushed open\nthe door, which I could not reach from the bed, and looked into the other\nroom. It was moonlight, and the light was coming' in from the quad,\nalthough the blind was drawn. The noise was still going on in a dark\ncorner of the room (granted it may have been rats !) ; but as I looked, two\n\ufb01gures emerged from the dark into the patch of light which came through\nthe window. Tney appeared to be \ufb01ghting ; I can only so describe it. It\nwas just as though I was watching the enactment of a duel, for though I\ncould see no weapons, yet the \ufb01gures were apart, and one, for certain, had\nhis hand towards the other !\nThere was no imagination about this ! I had to watch it in spite of my\nself ! And one \ufb01gure was, I feel sure, the \ufb01gure of my previous visitant.\nI don\u2019t know how short or long the time was in which the \u201cscu\ufb02le\u201d\nlasted, but presently there was a slight thud, and then my sitting-room door\nshut audibly, as though some one had gone out. Then I jumped out of\nbed, and striking a match, inspected the room, but there was nothing to be\nseen. Naturally I came to the conclusion that some of the men were\nplaying a joke upon me, and in the morning 1 went to every one in turn\n\f])I:c., 1899.] Cases. 157\nto know if they had been to my room, as I had had enough of it. Every one\nemphatically disclaimed having done so, and a meeting was convened to\nconsider the matter. I am sure from that time that nobody had part in it,\nand it was then that I was told of the supposed ghost.\nI did not stay in my rooms at night after that. Two or three of us sat\nup for two nights, and on the second night, sitting up in the room\noverhead, we all heard the same sequence of noises, viz., the scu\ufb02ie, the\nthud, and the door shutting, and this was at the usual time: \ufb01ve or six\nminutes past two. We kept watch on the window and the door of my\nrooms from the window upstairs ; it was possible to do so ; and nobody came\nout, and on immediately descending thither we could \ufb01nd nothing unusual.\nThat day I came home with my nerves very much upset, and since then\nhave occupied rooms on another staircase. Several different men have had\nexperiences of a slighter nature, especially on No. 4 staircase.\nI have given my history of the case as nearly as possible, and hope there\nmay yet be some explanation.\nMr. B. has been more or less ill continuously since his experience,\nand this fact supports the supposition that the hallucinations may\nhave been merely subjective. He has now left the University, and\nhis illness has prevented further inquiries.\nWe are told that it has proved impossible to trace the tradition of\nprevious \u201chaunting\u201d to anything de\ufb01nite. Mr. A. gave the name of\na clergyman, a former member of the College, who told him that\ndisturbances had occurred in his time; but on being written to, this\ngentleman declared that he knew nothing about the matter.\nIt must be noted that the doors of neither Mr. A.\u2019s nor Mr. B.\u2019s\nrooms were locked when the \ufb01gures appeared to them, and that these\n\ufb01gures seem usually to have departed in an audible and normal manner.\nOne of the men who sat up with Mr. B. to watch for the \u201cghost \u201d\ngives an account of the noises heard,\u2014which, it will be seen, is much\nvaguer than Mr. B.\u2019s,\u2014as follows :\u2014\nJane 7th, 1899.\nOne evening in Michaelmas Term, \u201997, four of us sat up in the room\nabove [Mr. B.\u2019s] to listen for the ghost. At one time we thought we heard\nsomething like mu\ufb02led footsteps moving about in the room below, but the\n\ufb01re was roaring up the chimney, and we could not clearly distinguish the\ntwo sounds. '\nLater in the evening one of us thought he heard the door below shut, but\non opening the door of the room we were in and listening on the stairs, we\ncould hear nothing.\nIn reality there was only one sound which I cannot understand. As we\nsat listening I heard a very faint sound, like a singing in my ear or the ring\ning of a distant bell,\u2014I do not mean several strokes of a bell, but a faint\ncontinuous sound, which I heard only with my left ear. I remarked upon\nit, but added that I was sure none of the others would hear it, as it was so\n\f158 .lowmmt of b'oci.ety\/_fu1' 1\u2019sy\/cluicut Reseu\/rclu [Dsc.. 1899.\nfaint. However, they all said they heard the same, and I endeavoured to\nlocate it, but in vain. I listened close to the \ufb01re, the windows, the doors,\nand the lamp, and heard the same sound, equally faint, the whole time.\nOnly when I moved into the bedroom I was unable to hear it ; but on return\ning to the sitting-room heard it again just as before.\nCORRE SPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for dpinions expressed by Correspondents.]\nThe following letter has been received from Dr. A. Colles about\nthe cases contributed by Mrs. A. W. Verrall to the November number\nof the Journal :\u2014\n116, King IIenry\u2019s Road, S. Hampstead, November 3rd, 1899.\nThe account in the November Journal S.P.R. of Mrs. Verrall\u2019s pre\nmonitions by means of a watch-like ticking have interested me, for the\nreason that, for more than twenty years, I have myself very frequently\nheard a ticking exactly such as Mrs. Verrall describes, so that I have\njestingly declared that I was haunted by the ghost of a watch. The\ndifference between us is, however, great, as I have never been able to\ntrace any connection between the sound and any event of interest. It\nhas followed me in various changes of residence. The sound occurs for\nperiods of from ten to thirty minutes, and, after frequent recurrences, is\nheard no more for perhaps several months. I have again and again proved\nabsolutely that the sound was distinct from that of any timepiece or watch\nwhich was in the room, but have never been able to account for its occur\nrence in any way. The sound is rapid and faint, pausing for a few seconds\nfrom time to time, and then going on again. Query, are Mrs. Verrall\u2019s_\ninstances coincidental or truly premonitory? If, as I gather, she has\nnever heard it without its being followed by some occurrence of a serious\nnature, it would seem that they are in some way of the latter character.\nIt would be of interest to have the point made quite clear whether she\nhas ever heard it without some sequent event. A. CoLLEs\nIn answer to questions as to whether the hearing of such sounds could\npossibly be due to any state of the ear, Dr. Colles writes further :\n116, King Henry\u2019s Road, N.W., .Notember 9th, 1899.\nIn reply to your note of 8th inst., I may say that I know of no condition\nof the car which would give rise to the sound I mentioned. A very rapidly\nticking watch rolled up in cotton wool would give the nearest idea of the\nsound, but it is more rapid than any watch I have come across. When\n\ufb01rst heard it sounded always as if it came from a particular cupboard in\nmy study, but subsequently came now from one point, now from another.\nIt is many months now since I have heard it, but similarly long intervals\nhave occurred in the past. On several occasions I made every investigation\ninto it which suggested itself to me, but entirely failed to determine its\nsource\u2018 A. CoLLEs.\n\fDsc.,1899.] Suppleme'nta'ry L'lb'rary Catalogue. 159\nDr. Colles\u2019 letters having been sent to Mrs. Verrall for perusal,\nshe writes :\u2014\n5, Selwyn Gardens, Cambridge, .November 11th, 1899.\nTo the Editor.\nIn answer to the question at the end of Dr. Colles\u2019 \ufb01rst letter, which\nyour courtesy has permitted me to see, I should like to summarise the\noccasions on which I have heard the \u201cticking\u201d described in the Journal\nfor November. They may be grouped under four heads :\u2014\n(a) In 1888 the ticking persisted, at irregular intervals, for three weeks,\nat a time when there was great anxiety among the members of my house\nhold, unknown to me, concerning the health of a child. The ticking ceased\nwhen I was made aware of the precarious condition of the child.\n(b) In 1891. for three or four months, the ticking was heard by me at\nirregular intervals, but desisted after the occurrence of a death.\n(0) In July, 1892, I heard and recorded the ticking, as described in\nthe Journal for November, on the night on which a friend was taken\nseriously ill.\n(01) In September, 1898, I heard and recorded the ticking thirty-two\nhours before the alarming accident to my sister, described in the Jour1ml.\nOn no other occasions have I heard it.\nI did once hear a death-watch when I was very young. The sound made\nby the death-watch is louder and more regular than the \u201c ticking\u201d ; I am\ncertain that the sound which I have been describing is not made by a beetle,\nnor by any clock or watch. That it is telepathic or premonitory I should\nnot like to say without more evidence than there is at present, but as it\nhas apparently always been veridical, I thought it worth noting.\nI have often wondered how the superstition about the death-watch\noriginated; there seems no obvious reason why that particular sound\nshould be thought to announce death. But if, as Dr. Golles\u2019 experience\nsuggests, there are persons liable to hear a ticking sound, it seems possible\nthat in some cases mental disturbance, anxiety, or alarm, too inde\ufb01nite\nto be recognised by the consciousness, may manifest itself in this form of\nhallucination, and thus the idea of impending misfortune might become\nassociated with a ticking sound.\u2014Yours truly, M DE G VERRALL\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nAdditions since the last list (JoURNAL for December, 1898).\nTHE EDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY.\nBINET (Dr. Alfred), The Psychology of Reasoning.

H. HYsmP, of the Columbia\nUniversity, New York, in illustration of the communications received\nduring the trance condition of Mrs. Piper.\nAs a prelude, and as illustrating Professor Hyslop\u2019s gradually\ndeveloped attitude towards the Piper phenomena, Professor Lodge\nread some extracts from the Journal S.P.R., for November, 1899\n(pp. 132, 133), where some portions of an article which appeared\nin an American periodical, The New World, are reproduced. He\nnext read some extracts from Dr. Hodgson\u2019s report on Mrs. Piper,\nProceedings S.P.R., Part XXXIII. (Vol. XIII.), selecting episodes\n\fJAN., 1900.] General Meeting. 1 63\non pp. 373, 338, 345, and some comments or remarks on pp. 348, 396\nand 391, with the object of reminding the audience of the kind of\napparently trivial but really evidential incidents frequently quoted by\nthe Piper sitters ; and he then proceeded to read the Introduction to\nProfessor Hyslop\u2019s record.\nIn this introduction he explains the object and the method of his\nexperiments, about which there was nothing supernormal at all. A\ntelegraph line was arranged between two buildings of the Columbia\nUniversity, and a couple of friends or acquaintances were taken\nindependently to each end of the line, only one of them knowing who\nwas at the other end; and this one (the communicator) was to send\nmessages, at \ufb01rst vague but increasing in de\ufb01niteness, while the other\nperson was to guess until he could guess correctly and assuredly who\nit was that was at the other end of the line. The replies and guesses\nwere likewise telegraphed by an assistant stationed with the receiver,\nfor the guidance of the sender. Professor Hyslop\u2019s objects in carrying\nout an extensive series of this kind of experiment are thus stated by\nhimself :\u2014\nI may now summarise the several objects of the whole series of experi\nments. The \ufb01rst of these objects was not intimated to any one. I was\nextremely careful not to breathe it to any one, not even to my assistants, so\nthat the results might be entirely spontaneous and without the in\ufb02uence of\nsuggestion from me.\nI. To test the extent to which intelligent persons would spontaneously\nselect trivial and unimportant incidents for the purpose of identi\ufb01cation\u2014\u2014\nthat is, incidents that were not connected, or not necessarily connected,\nwith the main habits of their lives.\nII. To test the accuracy of the identi\ufb01cation in connection with both\nindividual and collective incidents, and especially to test how slight or how\nde\ufb01nite the incident had to be in order to suggest rightly the person it was\nintended to represent.\nIII. To test the success and personal assurance of the receiver of the\nmessages in guessing who is the true sender in spite of some messages that\nare misleading or even false, but the bulk of which involves su\ufb02icient\ncumulative facts to overcome the natural scepticism and confusion caused\nby incoherences and contradictions.\nIV. To study the sources of misunderstanding that might arise under\nsuch circumstances when one party was ignorant of the intentions of the\nother, and the causes of illusion in identi\ufb01cation which we can determine in\nmy experiments, and which are likely to occur in the Piper case.\nAnd he proceeds :\u2014\nIn regard to the \ufb01rst of these objects, it is very interesting to observe the\nuniformity with which perfectly intelligent persons spontaneously chose\nwhat would generally be considered trivial incidents in order to identify\nthemselves. This seemed to naturally recommend itself to them, perhaps\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psych\/icat Reseumch. [Jm.,1900.\nfor the reason that trivial circumstances represent far more isolation than\nany chosen from the main trend of life, though I noticed no consciousness\nof this fact in any one. It was simply the instinctive method which every\none tended to adopt. The records show very distinctly that, if left to them\nselves, men will naturally select unimportant incidents for proof of their\nidentity, and it is one of the most interesting features of this choice that the\nindividual relied wholly upon the laws of association to recall what was\nwanted, after deciding on the nature of the incidents to be chosen. Very\noften there were interesting illustrations of those capricious revivals in\nmemory of remote incidents which not only resemble so much the incidents\nin the Piper sittings in triviality, but also represent the caprices and\nincoherences of associative recall, intelligible to the subject on re\ufb02ection,\nbut hardly so to the outside observer. At any rate, the results in this regard\ncompletely remove all objections to the Piper phenomena from the stand\npoint of the triviality of the incidents chosen for identi\ufb01cation, and that is an\naccomplishment of some worth.\nOn re\ufb02ection, most persons will at once admit the superior value of such\nincidents for scienti\ufb01c purposes ; but too often, under the a priori assump\ntion\u2014encouraged or created by a false idealism about a transcendental state\nof existence\u2014that discarnate spirits ought to show an interest in more lofty\nmatters, we suppose that the fact of triviality indicates a greater probability\nfor a mediumistic origin than for a spiritistic one. But after all, the\nspiritistic problem is not at stake here and perhaps allusion to it is irrelevant,\nas the real question in these experiments concerns only the place of trivial\nincidents in the evidential problem. The improbability of their frequent\nduplication makes them strong for purposes of proof, while what we know\nin these cases about the facts in the lives of intelligent men prevents\nany inferences as to the totality of the conditions in which their conscious\nactivity is spent. This fact is evident in the experiments here recorded,\nas the persons chosen for the experiments were of the class whose intellectual\noccupations and habits of mind could not be depreciated, and yet the\nincidents chosen for the suggestion of personal identi\ufb01cation were much the\nsame as those with which we have to deal in the Piper case. This \ufb01rst\nobject of the experiments, therefore, has been fully satis\ufb01ed, and the\nevidential implications of these phenomena vindicated, whatever theory we\nadopt for explanation of them.\nAfter discussing the results from the point of view of the Piper\ncase and the light they throw upon some di\ufb02iculties there met with,\nfor instance, with respect to :\u2014(l) Illusions of memory and their\neffect on the results.

The spontaneous choice of trivial incidents by perfectly intelligent\ncommunicators for the purpose of identi\ufb01cation.\n2. The illegitimacy of inferences as to the character or mental condition\nof communicators drawn from the character of the incidents chosen for\nidenti\ufb01cation.\n3. Correct identi\ufb01cation of names from mere incidents common to two\nlives, or correct judgments in regard to facts only hinted at.\n4. Identi\ufb01cation of persons on slight but pertinent clues without cumu\nlative force.\n5. The establishment of assurance in regard to the communicator, in\nspite of incoherence and diversions or contradictions.\n6. Errors of memory on the part of \u201c sitters\u201d that lead to confusion and\nfailure in recognition.\n7. The natural differences in the personal equation affecting the choice\nof incidents for identi\ufb01cation, as illustrated in the failure to recognise\nincidents or persons.\n8. Occasional liability to illusion from the element of chance, unless the\nincidents become cumulative enough to overcome it.\n9. Di\ufb02iculty and confusion in the communicator when trying to select\nat once incidents for identi\ufb01cation.\nThis last feature cannot be appreciated by the reader of this record, but\ncould be detected only by an eye-witness of the experiments themselves.\nBeing a witness of them I was struck by the fact, which is also noticeable\nin communications with the telephone when the party is limited in\ntime for his communications. The communicator\u2019s mind being set in the\ndirection of speci\ufb01cally pertinent incidents for identi\ufb01cation by a particular\nfriend, and being limited in time for their choice, there was the interesting\nmental struggle and confusion which every one can observe for himself in\nthe play of association endeavouring to make the right selection of incidents\nfor the purpose. We can imagine the situation of a discarnate spirit which\ncan have but a few minutes at least for communication, and probably\nworking under enormous ditliculties, of which we know nothing, to say\nnothing of the wrench that death might give the memory, if the usual\nphysiological theories of the faculty are to be accepted.\n\f166 Journal of Society for Psych\/ical Research. [JAN., 1900.\nThus, on the whole, it is clear that the evidence obtained in these\nexperimental sittings, after scrutiny and careful examination, have\nhad the effect of strengthening Professor Hyslop in his general agree\nment with the hypothesis of Dr. Hodgson, namely, that the ostensible\n\u201ccommunicators\u201d in the Piper trance are pretty much what they\npurport to be ; and that the evidence for their identi\ufb01cation by sitters\nis decidedly better and stronger than what is found in practice amply\nsuiiicient for identi\ufb01cation of individuals sending similar communi\ncations under normal conditions.\nFurther, that all objections made to the triviality of identifying\nmessages cease to have any weight, this triviality turning out to be\ninstinctive and natural and suitable for the purpose, and having no\nconnection whatever with the main lives or pursuits or characters of\nthe people communicating.\nThe HoN. EvERARD FEILDING said that the conditions of Professor\nHyslop\u2019s experiments were not altogether like those of Mrs. Piper\u2019s\nsittings; inasmuch as the communicator was bent on holding back\nidenti\ufb01cation for a time_\u2014did not, moreover, assist or confuse by giving\nany name, whether the true or a false one,\u2014and because there really\nalways was some de\ufb01nite communicator to be identi\ufb01ed, whereas a well\nknown hypothesis in the case of Mrs. Piper was that her secondary\npersonality under telepathic in\ufb02uence was personating relations and\nfriends of the sitter with the utmost unconscious cunning, and that\nthere was no one else \u201cthere\u201d at all. Hence he thought that the\nexperiments might have been directed to seeing how far personation\nwas possible.\nPRoFRssoR LoDGE agreed with these remarks to a considerable\nextent, but pointed out that these personation experiments would\nconstitute a different series, and would not answer the particular\nquestions which Professor Hyslop had set himself to answer ; though, as\nthey might answer other questions, they ought to be tried.\nMr. F. PoDMORE pointed out, for the bene\ufb01t of those who were\nnot familiar with the records of Mrs. Piper\u2019s trance utterances, that\nthe proof of their supernormal character did not depend upon such\nelaborate experiments as those made by Professor Hyslop. Mr. Pod\nmore did not share Mr. Hyslop\u2019s views as to the probable origin of\nthe communications; but he thought it practically certain that the\nknowledge displayed by Mrs. Piper could not have been acquired by\nnormal means. The argument which carried most conviction to his\nmind was the extraordinary superiority of Mrs. Piper to all other\nmediums. If Mrs. Piper\u2019s success was due to fraud or ingenious guess\nwork, it became extremely di\ufb02icult to explain how all previous mediums\n\fJAm, 1900.] - General Meeting. ' - 167\nfor the last three generations had failed to effect a tithe of her success.\nMr. Podmore gave some illustrations from early mediumship in this\ncountry.\nMr. F. O. S. SCHILLER pointed out that Professor Hyslop\u2019s experi\nments opened out an extensive \ufb01eld for further investigations in which\nthose members of the Society could share who, like himself, were\nunfortunately devoid of psychic gifts. It would be interesting, e.g., to\n\ufb01nd out, not merely the minimal evidence su\ufb02icient to produce psycho\nlogical conviction of identity, but also the maximal evidence which\nwould come nearest to logical proof of identity. Similarly the possi\nbilities of impersonation might be tested, and the experiments might\neven be conducted in the form of a new and interesting parlour game.\nMr. HUBERT J. SWEENEY considered that the comparatively few\nexperiments, and the imperfect conditions under which even those had\nbeen performed, were not su\ufb02icient to establish such general conclusions\nas Professor Hyslop had drawn. While some of these results were\ndeduced from insu\ufb02icient data, others again were obvious, and re\nquired no experimental demonstration whatever. It was, for instance,\nsuper\ufb02uous to prove that the sender might exaggerate the importance\nof the incidents he cited, and that as a consequence the receiver of\nthe message should fail to recognise his friend ; and there were many\nconditions which might easily account for the mistakes and numerous\napparent errors of memory committed by the receivers. Again, the\nmeans of communication\u2014the instrument, its defects, etc.\u2014as a factor\nin determining the value of the results, seemed to be entirely neglected\nby Professor Hyslop. Any message might easily fail to convey its full\nforce when sent through crude or imperfect instruments. Some of the\nProfessor\u2019s conclusions, too, were seemingly inconsistent. He \ufb01rst\njusti\ufb01es the use and shows the necessity of trivial incidents as a means\nof conveying identity, and afterwards shows the remarkable extent to\nwhich the same end may be attained from the vaguest details and\nmost general descriptions. Identi\ufb01cation, apparently so simple, was\nafter all very di\ufb02icult and liable to much confusion. He (Mr. Sweeney)\nattended a public s\u00e9ance recently at which a lady medium described\nwith considerable detail the departed spirits which she beheld standing\nnear their relatives or friends amongst her audience. Looking towards\nhim, she described one in his vicinity. He was struck with the remark\nable accuracy of the description, and was upon the point of stating the\nfact, when a lady sitting in front of him forestalled him by promptly\nproclaiming the spirit to be a near relative of her own!\nPRoFsssoR SIDGWICK said that he had listened with great interest\nto the account of Professor Hyslop\u2019s experiments, and thought them\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychtcal Research. [JAN.,1900.\n_well directed, as far as he could judge, to throw light on the questions\nto which they related. Before proceedmg to one or two remarks of a\ncritical kind which had occurred to him, he would like to say that,\nthough his own state of mind with regard to the explanation of\nthe Piper phenomena was one of suspense, he thought them quite\nsu\ufb02iciently important to justify the concentrated attention that was\nactually being given to them by Dr. Hodgson and other American\ninvestigators. In his view, no doubt, it would be necessary, before\narriving at a \ufb01nal decision with regard to this evidence, to extend the\nscope of the investigations and obtain phenomena from other persons.\nAt least, he could not himself rest such momentous conclusions as\nthose to which Dr. Hodgson pointed upon evidence obtained from one\nmedium alone. Still, in the meanwhile he thought it was important\nto make the most we could, by careful and repeated consideration, of\nthe Piper phenomena.\nTurning now to Professor Hyslop\u2019s experiments, he would mention\ntwo points that had occurred to him. The \ufb01rst was with regard to\nvagueness. It appeared to him that there was this difference between\nthe two cases: Professor Hyslop's communicators appeared to be\ndrawn from a comparatively small group of persons, most of whom\nwould be well acquainted with each other. In that case, statements\nthat might seem vague to outsiders would be really understood with\nmore de\ufb01niteness by those who received them.\nThen, as regards triviality, we might presume, he thought, that\nthe communicators in Professor Hyslop\u2019s experiments, though they\ndid not know exactly the aim of the process that they were taking\npart in, would naturally be inclined to treat it as a sort of game,\u2014\nat any rate, would not be in a \"cry serious mood when they made\ntheir communications. There would therefore be nothing in their\nemotional state of mind antagonistic to triviality in the incidents\nselected. But the case was different in the Piper experiments. Here\nphrases used by the alleged communicators certainly suggested pro\nfound emotion caused by the presence of friends or relations from\nwhom they had been parted. It seemed to him, therefore, somewhat\nmore surprismg in their case that this intensity and solemnity of\nfeeling did not exclude triviality. He mentioned these points in\norder that Professor Lodge might reply, if he thought that there\nwas no force in such suggestions.\nPRoFEssoR LoDGE said that though the incidents serving for identi\n\ufb01cation sounded vague to bystanders or readers of the record, yet when\nthey were explained from the point of view of both sender and\nreceiver they were perceived to be distinct enough, and to justify the\n\fJAN., I900.] Premature Genemlisations about Telepathy. 169\nleap of identi\ufb01cation taken upon them. And this fact he thought of\ninterest in connection with the Piper record, where it has been often\nfelt by readers or note-takers that sitters identify their relatives too\neasily and fancifully ; for in Professor Hyslop\u2019s experiments the identi\n\ufb01cation is often performed on still slighter grounds, often on what\nwould super\ufb01cially appear no legitimate ground at all, and yet it turns\nout, when both ends of the line are catechised (as they can not be\n-catechised in the real Piper case), that these incidents are perceived to\nbe of force adequate to support the conclusions based upon them.\nFurther, in answer to Professor Sidgwick\u2019s tentative objection that\nthe sitters in the Hyslop experiments were only playing at identi\n\ufb01cation, and therefore were naturally in a more or less frivolous mood,\nwhereas on Dr. Hodgson\u2019s hypothesis the Piper communicators would\nbe serious and emotional and not so likely to resort to trivial incidents :\nProfessor Lodge replied by postulating the case of a wanderer not able\nto return to his home, but able to communicate with it for a few\nminutes by telephone. In however strenuous and earnest a spirit he\nmight be\u2014indeed, both ends of the line might be,\u2014yet when asked to\nprove his identity and overcome the dread of illusion and personation,\nhe would instinctively try to think of some tri\ufb02ing and absurd private\nincident; and this might very likely be accepted as su\ufb02icient, and might\n-serve as a prelude to closer and more affectionate messages which,\nprevious to identi\ufb01cation, would be out of place; and he felt bound to\n-say that his own experience of the Piper sittings led him to assert that\nthis kind of genuinely digni\ufb01ed and serious and appropriate message\n-did ultimately in many cases come, but not until the preliminary stages\n(stages beyond which some sitters seemed unable to get) were fairly\npassed.\nPREMATURE GENERALISATIONS ABOUT TELEPATHY.\nIt is often asked what conditions are most favourable for the action\n-of Telepathy between the minds of livingr persons, and what can be\n-done to cultivate the power. If any correct answers could be given to\nthese questions, the whole subject of Psychical Research would be\ngreatly advanced ; we may even admit that, until we can answer them,\nthe science must remain in a rudimentary and unsatisfactory stage,\nPersons who make a small number of experiments are constantly\ntempted to fancy that this or that condition is the one that is\nindispensable to success; and it is true that different experimenters\n~often hit on the same condition as being the most favourable one,\nwhich suggests at \ufb01rst sight that there is cumulative evidence in\n\f170 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN.,1900\nsupport of their view. For instance, it is commonly asserted that\nquiescence of mind on the part of the experimenters and a special\nsympathy between them are conducive to success. Of course it may\noften happen that both these conditions are present and that the\nexperiments are successful ; but there are many other cases in which\nsuccess has been attained without them, and those who have had the\nlongest and most varied experience in work of this kind generally agree\nthat not only is nothing proved as to how to cultivate the power, or\nwhat conditions are best, but that we have absolutely no clue at\npresent which seems likely to lead to the desired discovery.\nThere is, indeed, one direction in which advance has been made ;.\nnamely, that we can now generally form a judgment as to when\nthe method of experimenting has been sufficiently stringent to admit\nof con\ufb01dence that telepathy has really been manifested. Possible\nsources of error in experimentation have been pretty fully\u2014if not\nexhaustively\u2014explored. It is known that\u2014apart from deliberate fraud\n\u2014indications of the idea to be transmitted may be both unconsciously\ngiven and unconsciously received through the ordinary channels of '\nsense; e.g., through variations in muscular pressure if the agent and\npercipient are in any kind of contact with one another, or connected\nby anything which could transmit such variations (for instance, by\nthe copper wire used in some of the experiments described below) ;_\nor by variations of tone, gesture, expression, etc., if they are within\nsight or hearing of one another. It is also known that a liberal\nmargin must be allowed\u2014even if the percipients are in a normal\ncondition, and still more if they are in a hypnotised condition\u2014for-\ngreater acuteness of the senses than is ordinarily supposed to exist,\nand also for greater quickness and accuracy in the interpretation of'\nall sensory impressions. It is true that the necessity for all these\nprecautions was soon discovered by some of the earliest systematic\nworkers of our Society (as may be seen by reference to the accounts of'\ntheir experiments published in the early numbers of the Proceedings) ;\nbut there is no doubt that the only way of advancing the subject\nfurther is to carry out many more experiments under the same stringent\nconditions as there described, or with any further precautions that\nexperience might suggest. Accounts of such experiments would be\nmost gladly received by the Editor.\nThe subject, however, is not advanced, but rather hindered, by\nrash speculations such as those given below, in which the writer\u2014\ninstead of giving details of speci\ufb01c cases\u2014attempts to generalise from.\nthe results of a limited experience, and it is thought that the careful\nexamination of his methods of working and results by Professor\n\fJAN., 1900.] Premature Generalisations about Telepathy. 171\nWilliam Romaine Newbold and some of the latter\u2019s colleagues and\nfriends in the University of Pennsylvania, may be usefully printed\nhere as a warning.\nThe article in question was written by Mr. Edmund Willson\nRoberts; it appeared in an American periodical, The Cosmopolitan,\nof March, 1899, under the title \u201cSuccessful Attempts in Scienti\ufb01c\nMind-Reading,\u201d and is as follows :\u2014\nThe average individual is prone to look upon the subject of \u201cthought\ntransference,\u201d popularly known as \u201c mind-reading,\u201d with more or less\nderision. It is nevertheless a fact that the majority, perhaps all, of the\nhuman race possess the faculty of reading the thoughts of others without\nrecourse to speech or to outward signs. That the statement is strictly true,\neach reader may readily prove for himself by means of the experiments\noutlined in this article.\nBefore taking up experiments in detail, it is necessary to caution the\nexperimenter against permitting zeal so to blind his judgment as to allow\nmere chance or coincidence to be mistaken for actual results. No one is so\neasily deceived by mere coincidence or by trickery as one inclined to\nattribute such phenomena to supernatural causes\u2014for instance, to the\n\u201cdenizens of the spirit world.\u201d And, although the writer offers neither\nexplanation nor theory regarding these phenomena, he feels con\ufb01dent that\nonce the laws of thought-transference are thoroughly established, they will\nbe found analogous to those physical laws accepted for electricity and light.\nThe following general rules apply to all experiments in thought\ntransference.\nThe receiver\u2014he who receives the impression from the mind of another\n\u2014must, \ufb01rst of all, learn to bring his mind to a state of absolute rest. In\nother words, he must learn to think of nothing but the fact that another's\nmind is trying to impress a thought upon his own. Experience has proved\nthat the more perfect the state of rest and the less the effort employed, the\neasier it is for the transmitter\u2014he who seeks to impress the thought\u2014to\nproduce the mental effect desired. The success of the experiments depends,\nin a great measure, upon the ability of the transmitter to concentrate his\nmind upon the particular thought with which he wishes to impress the mind\nof the receiver. The measure of success appears to vary inversely with the\nextent of the effort employed. Merely to think of a word or phrase, without\nallowing the mind to wander, is all that is required of the transmitter. The\ncircumstances surrounding the experiment are su\ufb02icient for the transmission\nof the thought in the proper direction, and that portion of the experiment is\ncertain to take care of itself.\nThe experiment should never be attempted by those either mentally or\nphysically fatigued. Under no circumstances should a novice practise the\nexperiments continuously for any length of time, for the reason that, until\nan experimenter learns to operate entirely without effort, he \ufb01nds the work\nvery exhausting. Do not become discouraged at failures upon \ufb01rst attempts.\nThe experimenter \ufb01nds that by perseverance he soon acquires su\ufb02icient skill\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1900.\nto be successful in the majority of experiments. If he keep a careful\nrecord he soon perceives that there is no other explanation of the phenomena\nobserved, than thought-transference.\nThe \ufb01rst experiment considered is that popularly known as \u201c pin\n\ufb01nding,\u201d dubbed by wiseacres \u201c muscle-reading.\u201d The customary pro\ncedure is as follows : Several persons having assembled in a room, one of\nthe company leaves for a few moments, and during his absence some object\nis hidden. The hiding-place is known to every one but the person outside.\nThe exiled individual then comes in and, taking the hand of another of the\ncompany, attempts to \ufb01nd the hidden object, ostensibly by reading the\nminds of those present. I say ostensibly, because there is no denying that\nthe experiment is materially assisted by slight, though usually unconscious,\nmovements on the part of the leader.\nThe one doing the seeking\u2014let us call him the operator\u2014experiences an\ninclination to go in a certain direction, and moves as he is inclined. He\nusually walks slowly, but surely, to where the object is hidden, the leader,\nof course, walking by the side and still holding the hand of the operator.\nOn arriving in front of the hiding-place, the operator is inclined to pause,\nand his free hand seems to be led directly to the hidden object. The experi\nment may be varied by the company\u2019s choosing some task which they desire\nthe operator to perform. Thus they may wish him to walk across the\nroom and lay his hand upon some particular object, or, perhaps, to take a\ncard from a tray and hand it to some one present.\nThe foregoing experiment is ordinarily successful, no matter who the\noperator may be. If, however, the experiment be attempted without the\nassistance of the leader, 'i.e., without bodily contact with any one, the\nfailures are more frequent and the performance of the experiment is often\nexhausting to the operator. The reason for the larger percentage of failures\nin this case is that the operator here depends upon thought-transference\nalone, since he no longer has the aid of unconscious muscular action on the\npart of an assistant. By practice, however, the operator gradually gains con\n\ufb01dence in his own ability, soon \ufb01nding not only that bodily contact is entirely\nunnecessary, but that if he resorts to it, he is apt to become confused.\nTo gain more quickly the necessary con\ufb01dence, the following intermediary\nstep may be taken. Procure a piece of copper wire, about eight or ten feet\nlong. Employ a leader, as in the \ufb01rst experiment, but instead of taking\nhold of his hand, have the leader grasp one end of the wire, while the\noperator takes hold of the other ; allow the wire to lie upon the \ufb02oor, and\nmake sure that no movement of the leader can be transferred to the end of\nthe wire which the operator is holding ; then proceed as in the \ufb01rst experi\nment. In a short time the wire may be discarded altogether, and impressions\nreceived when those present are several feet away.\nA very good procedure to follow, when making the experiment without\ncontact, is \ufb01rst to blindfold the operator securely before he enters the room.\nThe company having chosen the task to be performed, the operator is led\nin, taken to the centre of the \ufb02oor, and turned about several times, so that\nhe cannot tell in what direction he is facing, then left to his own devices.\n\fJAx.,1900.] Premature Gene'rali-sations about Telepathy. 173\nThe others should now keep their minds \ufb01xed upon the task to be per\nformed. Perfect quiet is absolutely essential. Whispering, half- suppressed\nlaughter, or moving about are especially annoying to the operator.\nOnce placed in the centre of the room, the operator should, to begin\nwith, bring his mind to a state of rest. In a short time-\u2014it may be a few\nseconds, or it may, perhaps, take as long as two minutes\u2014the operator \ufb01nds\nhimself seemingly drawn, in some one direction, by an unknown force. He\nshould follow this inclination and do anything he feels impelled to do.\nThe result quite frequently is that he performs the task as laid down for him.\nIn the \ufb01rst experiments of this nature, simple tasks should be chosen.\nFor example, take some object, as a bunch of keys, lay it on a chair\nor shelf, and decide that the operator is to pick it up. The task may be\nincreased in di\ufb02iculty as the operator improves.\nIn the remaining experiments thought-transference proper comes into\nplay. In other words, the impression of an actual thought by the mind of\none person upon that of another is the principal feature. The sequence in\nwhich these experiments are here described is also the order in which they\nshould be taken up by the novice.\nIn the \ufb01rst experiment of this series the receiver takes a position with his\nback to the transmitter and at a distance of ten feet or more. For\nconvenience, the transmitter should be seated at a table. The message or\nthought to be transferred may be the mental image of any familiar object.\nThe transmitter chooses the object and lays it before him on the table,\nwith a background of contrasting colour beneath it, so that the outlines of\nthe object may stand out clearly. The transmitter should gaze at the object\ncontinuously, without permitting his thoughts to wander. No effort need\nbe made toward impressing the thought upon the mind of the receiver, but\nall efforts exerted in keeping the thoughts upon the message.\nThe mental c\ufb02brts of the receiver should all be directed toward keeping\nhis mind as devoid of thought as he possibly can. The mental image of the\nmessage appears slowly at \ufb01rst, the distinctncss of the vision depending upon\nthe degree of concentration exercised by the transmitter. It is sometimes\ndi\ufb02icult to perceive the image ; and several objects may crowd themselves\nforward before the mind\u2019s eye, making it hard to choose the right one. The\nmost persistent image of all usually turns out to be the message, while it\nfrequently happens that the others are thoughts that have crowded them\nselves into the mind of the transmitter.\nThe novice should, at \ufb01rst, employ several transmitters, say as many as can\nconveniently be grouped about a small table. A further aid to the beginner\nis to choose four or \ufb01ve objects which the receiver knows of beforehand,\nand from which the transmitters are to select their message. Suppose the\n\ufb01ve objects are \ufb01ve numbers. The receiver is told that the message is to be\none of the numbers two. four, six, seven, and eight. The receiver now takes\nhis station, say in an armchair across the room, and covers his face with his\nhands or shades his eyes, his back, of course, toward the transmitters.\nThe number chosen is now laid, face up, in the centre of the table, and\nthe other numbers laid aside so as not to be in view. Each transmitter\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JAN., 1900.\ngazes intently at the number. In the course of a few seconds the receiver\nperceives the numbers two, four, and seven crowding forward; six and\neight, perhaps, are far in the background. The numbers two, four, and\nseven \ufb01le slowly past, each lingering a moment to be crowded out by\nanother; after a short time he \ufb01nds that four is the most persistent of\nthe three, and, on naming it, is told that four is the chosen one.\nIf the \ufb01rst guess is not correct, a new set of \ufb01gures should be chosen\nand the experiment repeated. Figures cut from an ordinary wall calendar\nare very convenient for this purpose.\nThe number of \ufb01gures used should be gradually increased as the receiver\nimproves, until he \ufb01nally discovers that he succeeds quite well, when the\ntransmitters are at liberty to choose any number of one or two digits,\n1'.e., any number from one to ninety-nine, inclusive.\nThe next step is to reduce the number of transmitters until one is \ufb01nally\nfound su\ufb02icient. This gradual tapering down, as we may call it, gives both\nparties con\ufb01dence\u2014a most necessary quali\ufb01cation for continual success.\nA great obstacle in the path of success is the tendency of the transmitter\nto permit his thoughts to wander from the message. In order to obviate\nthis dif\ufb01culty as much as possible, the writer devised an instrument which he\nhas named \u201c teleposcope. \u201d This is nothing more than an oblong box, one end\nlarger than the other, \ufb01tted with a removable slide at the larger end, and\nat the smaller with a \ufb02exible hood, so shaped as to \ufb01t the head closely\nabout the eyes. For convenience when in use it is supplied with a handle on\nthe under side. The slide contains an aperture for the insertion of a piece\nof paper, having upon it a \ufb01gure or any character chosen for the purpose.\nWhen the instrument is placed to the eyes of the transmitter, he has\nnothing in view but the message. Thus the liability of his mind to wander\nto subjects other than the message is considerably decreased. The e\ufb02iciency\nof the instrument was proved in the \ufb01rst three experiments made with its\nassistance. Two of these, the \ufb01rst and the third, were completely success\nful. In these experiments the distance between the transmitter and the\nreceiver was no less than 225 miles.\nNot only is it possible to transmit disjointed numbers, but the operator\nmay, by practice, reach such a degree of perfection as to be able to read a\ncomplete series of thoughts. No better illustration of this can be given than\nthe relation of an actual case, one from the writer\u2019s personal experience.\nThe particular instance in question is selected more because of the cir\ncumstances surrounding the case than because the results were unusual.\nThe transmitter was a young lady to whom the operator had been\nintroduced but three days previous to the experiment. He knew little\nof her family, and absolutely nothing of her history prior to the intro\nduction; he had, furthermore, no knowledge of her home but that it\nwas in the neighbourhood of New Orleans, knowing nothing whatever of\nits exact location. He was likewise ignorant of the topography of the\nsurrounding country, having never been within 100 miles of the city.\nThe operator sat facing the transmitter and placed the palm of her hand\nagainst his forehead. After requesting her to keep her mind upon some\n\fJ-A'iv\u2018.,i9e0.]W _1?rewt(lture Generalisati,ons about Telepathy. 175\nevent of which she could form a distinct mental picture, he was silent\nfor perhaps thirty seconds before he began a relation of his impressions.\n\\\\'ithout entering into minutiae, it may be said that he was able to\n-describe her thoughts brie\ufb02y as follows: The young lady had, some years\nbefore, been driving with a young man, and during the drive they had\nhad a violent quarTel. He drove her through a wood to a stream much\ntoo swollen to ford, and, after some protestation on the part of the\nyoung lady against going farther, he drove her home.\nThe operator described her home, narrated what she did after the young\nman left her, and even told many characteristics of the country surrounding\nthe house. When he had \ufb01nished the young lady exclaimed : \u201c Every word\n-of that is true. Now do you think you can tell me his name 'i\u201d\nQuick as a \ufb02ash came the answer, \u201c George Gardner.\u201d The transmitter\nsank back in her chair, overcome with astonishment. The answer was right.\nAlthough this experiment was performed when the transmitter was\ntouching the operator, subsequent experiments were successfully performed\nby the same parties while seated at opposite sides of the room.\n' It is not necessary for the receiver to place the transmitter\u2019s hand\nagainst his forehead, a light grasp of the hands doing as well. But, with\na little practice, contact may be abandoned altogether and the parties\nseated anywhere in the room. It is advisable for both experimenters to\ncover their eyes with their hands, or at least to shade them, better to\nprevent distraction from the subject in hand. The methods are otherwise\npractically the same as those previously described. Experiments of this\nxind are seldom successful with more than one-third of those acting as\ntransmitters for the \ufb01rst time. By persistent practice, however, all seem\n-able to acquire the necessary acumen.\nWhen making experiments in thought-transference over distances greater\nthan those within the limits of an ordinary room, the plan outlined below\nhas given good results. It is possible that some other system might give\n-an equally good, if not a better, chance of success, but the following scheme\nhas the advantage of having been tested in a series of some 125 experiments\nmade during the spring of last year.\nThe receiver and the transmitter should set apart some hour for the\nwork, when neither is likely to be disturbed. It 1s obviously essential\nthat the hour chosen by each individual should be the same. If there is\nany difference in time, as, for instance, when one party is in New York\nand the other in Chicago, proper allowance should be made. The hour\nchosen is to be divided into six intervals of ten minutes each. During\nthe \ufb01rst ten minutes both experimenters should rest, to give their minds\nsu\ufb02icient time to clear themselves of extraneous thoughts. The transmitter\n-should devote a portion of this interval to the preparation of the message,\nor the object, the mental image of which he wishes to impress upon the\nmind of the receiver. During the second ten minutes the transmitter\n-should gaze steadily at the object constituting the message. The receiver\nshould at the same time be seated in a comfortable position, his eyes\ncovered with his hand, and should note any image which may appear to\nhim, making a careful record of his impression at the close of the interval.\nThe following ten minutes is a second period of rest, and the \ufb01rst ten\nminutes at the second half of the hour is devoted to a second message.\nA third period of rest ensues, and the last ten minutes is devoted to a\n4\n\f176 Jowrnat of Society for I\u2019s;z\/clvical Iteseu\/rah. [Jxx., 1900.\nthird message. The periods of rest are essential, especially to the beginner,\nas they not only help to avoid confusion of the messages, but give a chance\nfor rest to the novice, to whom the work is tiring.\nIn order to facilitate the keeping of records, it is well to prepare before\nhand a set of blanks, to be kept in duplicate, the transmitter recording the\nmessages sent and the receiver the impressions received.\nThe original copy should be, at the earliest opportunity, mailed by each\nexperimenter to his collaborator, to ensure the con\ufb01dence of each party\nin the other. Each receiving the other\u2019s report after he has mailed his\nown, will be satis\ufb01ed that such results as are apparent are genuine.\nSystematic and conscientious work, such as is required in any scienti\ufb01c\nexperiments, is certain to produce astonishing results. The experimenter\nshould not, however, expect too much at the start.\n[Professor Newbold\u2019s account of the experiments he tried to test the\nvalidity of Mr. Roberts\u2019 methods and conclusions will be given in the\nnext number of the Journal.]\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions ea:)n-eased by Correspoitdents.]\nThe following letter has been received from Mr. Barkworth in\nreference to the discussion of Mr. Lang\u2019s paper on \u201cThe Fire VValk\u201d\nin the last number of the Journal :\u2014\nDecember 12th, 1899.\nI have been much interested in reading the discussion on Mr. Andrew\nLang's paper on the \u201c Fire Walk\u201d . . . None of the speakers seem to\nhave noticed the extreme antiquity of the practice, which was of heathen\norigin, was forbidden in the Mosaic law, and was denounced when practised\nby various persons among the Israelites. What precise signi\ufb01cance or\nobject the ceremony had does not appear, but there was probably a con\nnotation of magic or witchcraft about it, which would make it particularly\nabominable to the Jewish mind. What is more remarkable, however, is that\nit has survived to the present day ; and I have learned from various sources,\nboth personal and literary, that in remote parts of Ireland, on certain days\nof the year, young people make a practice of running between two \ufb01res\u2014\nof course, without actual contact. As regards the physical effects, I can\noffer no suggestion; but it may be worth while to add to Sir William\nCrookes\u2019s remarks that, when I was managing a large iron-works in Wales,\nI was told that it was a well-known feat among puddlers for a bet to dip\ntheir hands into molten iron. I never saw it done; but the explanation\nis simple enough to make it credible. Before dipping the hand into the\niron, the puddler \ufb01rst dipped it in cold water, and then plunged it all wet\ninto the molten \ufb02uid. The water then, being instantly converted into\nsteam, expanded su\ufb02iciently to keep the iron from actual contact with the\n\ufb02esh ; and, of course, the man withdrew his hand too quickly to allow the\nsteam to be dissipated. This seems to have some analogy to the explanation\noffered by Professor Barrett; but whether it would account for any of\n7 _ l I\nHome s performmces I cannot say.

(pp. 234 to 238).\nProfessor Barrett's investigation of this case\u2014the photograph of \u201cD.\nHall\u201d taken by Miss S. R. Corbet, in which there appeared an'un\naccountable \ufb01gure, supposed by some to be a \u201cspirit-photograph\u201d of\nthe late \u201c Lord D.\u201d\u2014\ufb01rst came out in the Journal (December, 1895),\nand was reprinted in my article, and soon afterwards I received\nvarious letters relating to it.\n\f178 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FF.B.,1900.\nBefore dealing in detail with the points raised, I may observe\nthat I had an opportunity a few weeks ago of seeing another letter\nfrom Miss Corbet about the case, which by some accident I had not\nseen before. This letter is dated May 25th, 1895, and in it occurs\nthe following :\u2014\nThe door was not locked\u2014there are three into the room\u2014and I\nthink that one of them was open, as my recollection is that I placed the\ncamera in or a little beyond the doorway, to give as much length to the\npicture as possible. . . . The only men in the house at the time were\nmy youngest brother, the butler (neither of these went into the room) and\ntwo footmen, and as all four were young men, I do not think that any of\nthese could have caused the \ufb01gure . . . which appears to be an old\nman with a beard.\nNow, the chief arguments brought forward in support of the\nspiritistic interpretation of the photographf rested on the supposition\nthat there was only one door to the room, so that no one could have\ncome in without noticing the camera in the doorway ; that, therefore,\nit was almost impossible that any one coming in could have been\nbrought into the photograph accidentally\u2014without his own intention;\nwhile there was a moral presumption against this having been done\ndeliberately\u2014as a practical joke. But the existence of the other two\ndoors certainly takes away much\u2014if not all\u2014of the force of these\narguments.\nWith regard to the moral presumption against a deliberate prac\ntical joke, Miss Corbet writes on May 31st, 1895 :\nI have quite lost sight of one of the footmen, but I enquired\u2019 yesterday\nif the other was at all likely to have come into the room at the time and\nhope to hear some day; but I do not think any of the servants would\nbe likely to play a practical joke, and I know my brother would not have\ndone so.\nIt must be noted that this inquiry was not apparently made till\nthe date mentioned, whereas the photograph was taken on December\n5th, 1891.\nOne of the most remarkable features of the photograph, as\ndescribed in my article, is that there are double images of almost\nall the objects in it, the brightest or best lighted lines being the\nmost clearly doubled. This was said to show that the camera must\nhave been moved slightly during the exposure, as no movement of\nthe objects could have produced such complete uniformity of doubling\nas appears throughout. One of my correspondents, however,\u2014Mr.\nD. B. McLachlan,\u2014wrote that he could see no clear traces of the\ndoubling in the reproduction of the photograph. This led me to\n\fFi;B.,1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photograph;\/.\u201d 179\nreexamine both the original photograph and Dr. Kingston's descrip\ntion of the doubling, of which a summary only was given in my\narticle. Dr. Kingston, having made a special study of the subject\nof \u201cspirit-photography,\u201d had been invited by Professor Barrett to\nexamine this specimen, and he described the doubling in a letter to\nProfessor BarTett, dated October 6th, 1895, as follows :\u2014\nI have been examining again the photograph while showing it to\nfriends and have found some things about it which I had not noticed before.\nFirst I saw that that chair which stands in the middle of the room had\napparently been moved ; the books on the chair behind it show right\nthrough the bars of the back and the pattern of the carpet \u201cshows through\u201d\nthe legs. I thought it must have been moved or even placed there by the\nman who came in and sat down, but on looking more closely I found that\nthere is hardly a white line or mark in the picture which is not doubled!\nThe brightest or best lighted lines are the most distinct naturally, especially\nwhere they fall in one of their positions on a dark ground.\nLook at the lady's portrait on the little table on the right. The double\noutline of the card is most distinct, but even the face can be faintly seen.\nSee the candle behind it. See the other candle on the left and the portrait\nbeside it, where the doubling of the card is sharp and even the re\ufb02ection of\nthe candle in the glass is doubled. The same holds throughout. I believe\nthe camera was moved, and for a short time, either at the beginning or the\nend of the exposure, was in a (very slightly) different position. Nay, I am\nquite sure of it. Wherever a line was light enough to impress the plate in\nthe time of the shorter exposure, it is doubled.\nThe books in the bookcase are doubled ! so it was no movement of the\nfurniture, but of the camera. Could this have been done by the shutting\nof a door? Did the camera stand insecurely or on a polished \ufb02oor, or\ndid Miss Corbet pass it in the doorway after moving the cap, or just before\nreplacing it? The doubling of the books, by the way, is best seen in those\nbelow the coronet and [letter] I in those two lower shelves. The fainter image\nis below and to the right just in proportion to the typical one of the lady\u2019s\nportrait. Higher up the light has not been enough for the short exposure,\nand at that place where the light falls most strongly, the density of the\none image almost obscures the other. Even there it can be seen and the\nmoulding of the case shows in the space where a book has been removed.\nA faint but quite distinct repeat is the curved handle to a drawer just\nabove the corner of the seat of the middle chair. I am not quite so well\nsatis\ufb01ed with regard to that chair, but still I think the marks follow the same\nlaw, and the greater vagueness is caused by strong light of the edge of the\nhook and chair behind and the comparative shadow in which it stands itself.\nAt any rate it must have stood there for all the longer exposure. It is just\nthe same as the others, but being nearer, the displacement is a little greater.\nThe same applies to the lamp or \ufb02ower stand in front of the big chair which\nwe discussed, and which I thought then being brass must have a second\nlight on it, but I now see it is just doubled like the rest. Why the lower\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychtcal Research. [FEB., 1900.\npart does not show this clearly is that it had not light enough for the short\nexposure. . . .\nAs to the \u201cghost\u201d itself I cannot with certainty make out the same\ndoubling ; of course, if one could, it would prove that the form, faint as it is,\nhad been there all the time (but even if it was, the faintness of its lights\nmight prevent the shorter exposure from being recorded). But I am\ninclined to believe that it is not so, the outline seems generally blurred.\nThere is a shading on the hand that might be caused by the double outline !\nI wish I could speak more certainly.\nOn comparing this description afresh with the photograph, it\nappeared to me that the transparency of the chair in the middle\nof the foreground was a more signi\ufb01cant feature than I had pre\nviously considered it. It also appeared to me that Dr. Kingston\u2019s\n\ufb01rst hypothesis that \u201cit must have been moved or even placed there\nby the man who came in and sat down\u201d was not incompatible with\nhis observation that the lines in it are doubled,\u2014like the lines of\nthe other objects in the room.\nIn most of the objects, there are in each case two images side by\nside, and overlapping one another; and the overlapping region is\u2014\nnaturally\u2014opaque, because it would have been covered by one or\nthe other image during the whole of the exposure.\nThe peculiarity of the chair is that in some parts of it, notably\nthe legs and back, the region where the two images overlap is trans\nca\/rent, as well as the rest.\nThis seems to me to afford strong evidence for the view that during\npart of the exposure neither image was there\u2014in other words, that the\nchair was moved into that position soon after the exposure had begun,\nor moved away from it before the exposure ended.\nAgainst this view it is argued by Mr. McLachlan in his communica\ntion printed below that some parts of the chair\u2014especially parts of\nthe seat\u2014are opaque, which would tend to show that it had been there\nall the time; and I do not think it is at all easy to explain this\napparent anomaly. If the chair had only been there for part of the\ntime, we should certainly expect it to appear transparent throughout,\nunless\u2014as Mr. McLachlan observes in a letter to me\u2014it were so\nstrongly illuminated in proportion to the objects behind it that its\nimage on the plate would cause theirs to be imperceptible. It is\nimpossible, however, to make sure of the degree of illumination of the\nwhole of its background. There is a shadow thrown by a writing\ntable on the \ufb02oor behind the chair in such a position that it might\nand I think probably did\u2014cause the front of the seat to appear\nopaque ; but the very opacity necessarily prevents the exact limits of\nthe shadow from showing. The background above and below this\n\fFEB.,1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photography.\u201d 181\nregion is strongly lighted, which would account satisfactorily for the\ntransparency of the back and legs of the chair.\nIn any case, the double image of the chair proves that the move.\nment of the camera must have taken place while the chair was in the\nposition in which we now see it. Mr. McLachlan writes below (p. 183)\nin reference to the fact that one set of images is much brighter than\nthe other: \u201c The plate was thus in two positions during the exposure.\nThe \ufb01rst position lasted probably not more than a few seconds, since\nonly the highest lights affected the plate. It is therefore practically\ncertain that the camera was moved before Miss Corbet left the house.\u201d\nI agree that the camera must have been in one position much longer\nthan in the other, but I fail to see any ground for the assumption\nthat the first position was the one which lasted for the shorter period ;\non the face of it, it would simply appear, as\u2014following Dr. Kingston\u2019s\nview\u2014I said in my account, that \u201cthe camera must have been moved\neither near the beginning or near the end of the exposure.\u201d The\npeculiar features in the transparency of the chair just described are\nalso consistent with the supposition that the shorter exposure came\nlast, not first ; and therefore that it was not Miss Corbet who moved\nthe camera in going out of the room, but some one else who came\nupon the scene later.\nIt will be seen that Mr. McLachlan con\ufb01rms my statement that\nthe double image of the \u201cghost\u201d does not at all correspond with the\ndouble images of the other objects in the room, and that therefore\nthe multiplication of its outlines must have been caused by its own\nmovements, not by any movement of the camera. His general\ndescription of the \ufb01gure,_its transparency, the absence of features\nin the face, etc.,\u2014also agrees closely with mine. The transparency\u2014\non the supposition that it was a human \ufb01gure\u2014shows that it must\nhave been in the chair only a very short time, which would render\nmore feasible the continuous movement of the legs and left side of\nthe body that\u2014on Professor Barrett\u2019s surmise\u2014accounted for the\ninvisibility of these parts in the photograph.\nMr. McLachlan thinks that Professor Barrett\u2019s photograph is\nclearly that of a man, and not comparable to the other. I cannot\nhelp fancying that a believer in \u201c spirit-photography,\u201d seeing Professor\nBarrett\u2019s photograph and not knowing how it had been obtained,\nwould, primd facie, attribute it to spirit agency. It is in parts\nrather more opaque than the \u201cghost\u201d \ufb01gure, but its left arm is\ndistinctly less so. Mr. McLachlan says of it, \u201cThe legs are slightly\nindicated.77 The indication consists of what may be described as a\nsoupron of a perfectly shapeless blur\u2014the slightest possible difference\n\f182 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB.,1900.\nof illuInination\u2014down the middle of the front of the chair in which\nthe \ufb01gure is sitting. I think with Mr. McLachlan that this was most\nlikely produced by the legs of the sitter. But the judgment seems\nto me to depend simply on interpretation, not on any visual per\nception. VVe both believe that a man with legs sat in the chair;\nwe are therefore willing to interpret this barely visible and otherwise\nmeaningless appearance as legs. Similarly, I believe that a man sat\nin the \u201cghost\u2019s\u201d chair, and I can see a difference of illumination\ndown the front of that chair which I interpret as the legs of that\nman. Mr. McLachlan sees there \u201cno . . . legs.\u201d It is obvious\nthat my judgment of what I see there depends solely on interpre~\ntation, and is absolutely worthless as evidence.\nMr. McLachlan remarks that if a man had come into the room,\nhe must have left various other traces of himself in the photograph,\nbesides the ghostly \ufb01gure. But this would only be the case if he came\ninto the part of the room included in the photograph, and within that\npart the transparency of the chair already described seems to me\nevidence of the intrusion. I pointed this out to Mr. McLachlan, and\nhe suggested, as he states below, that the transparency might be due\nto spirit agency. To me there seems no more reason to attribute the\ntransparency of the chair than the opacity of the other objects in the\nphotograph to spirits. If ordinary material effects are to be put down,\n\u2014now to the ordinary causes recognised by science, and now to\n\u201cspirits,\u201d\u2014how can any certainty, even of the roughest practical\nkind, ever be attained on any subject; or how can our knowledge of\nphenomena ever be in any way advanced? We need not, indeed,\nassume that \u201cscience,\u201d\u2014i.e., the amount of scienti\ufb01c knowledge we\npossess at present,\u2014can explain everything. But we shall reduce\nphilosophy to a hopeless chaos if we once give up the scienti\ufb01c\nprinciple of excluding ordinary known causes before having recourse\nfor an explanation to unknown ones; and to my mind we cannot at\npresent, even on the authority of Mr. W. T. Stead, regard the direct\naction of disembodied spirits on matter as a known cause.\nTo sum up the arguments against spirit agency in this case :\u2014\n(1) The room was not locked at the time the photograph was being\ntaken, and there were two other doors into it besides that in which\nthe camera was placed.\n(2) The house was apparently left empty, except for the servants,\nduring almost the whole time of the exposure, which lasted for an hour.\n(3) Inquiry was not made as to whether any one had entered the\nroom during the exposure until more than three years afterwards; and\nwas not made at all of one of the then' inmates of the house.\n\fFm, 1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpi'rz't-Photography!\u2019 183\n(4) 'Professor Barrett showed that a \ufb01gure reproducing the essen\ntial features of the \u201c ghost,\u201d viz., its fragmentary nature and its\ntransparency, could be got by photographing a human being under\ncertain conditions.\n(5) Apart from the possibility of the ghost \ufb01gure having been thus\nproduced, the transparency of the chair in the middle of the room\ntends to prove that it was not there during the whole of the exposure\nand was therefore probably moved into that place by a person in the\nroom\u2014perhaps the same person who moved the camera afterwards.\nIf circumstantial evidence can ever be regarded as conclusive, I\nthink that its cumulative weight in this case is sufficient to show that\nall the features of the photograph are due to ordinary normal causes.\nII.\nBY D. B. MCLACHLAN.\nI have examined the original photograph closely and \ufb01nd numerous\nbright points and edges that are duplicated. Where this occurs there\nis a false image below and to the right of the true image. The\ndoubling must have been caused by a slight movement of the camera\nafter the lens was uncapped. The plate was thus in two positions\nduring the exposure. The \ufb01rst position lasted probably not more than\na few seconds, since only the highest lights affected the plate. It is\ntherefore practically certain that the camera was moved before Miss\nCorbet left the house. Several ladies were present at the arranging\nof the camera.\nApart from the doubling, which is quite normal and intelligible,\nthe photograph has two peculiarities not so easy to understand. As\nthey appear to be physically unrelated, they can be treated separately.\nThe Ghost.\nThe \ufb01gure in the chair is not doubled by the movement of the\ncamera. There is a doubling of the back of the head, but it is not\nof the same nature as the other doublings. In these the strong or\npermanent image is the one to the left and above the other; in the\ncase of the Ghost this is the weaker image.\nIt has been suggested that the head of the Ghost is a re\ufb02ection of\nthe metallic bowl of the \ufb02ower stand from the upholstered back of\nthe chair, and the spectral hand a similar re\ufb02ection from part of the\nmetal stem. The head is squarish, whereas the bowl is an inverted\ncone. In the position occupied by the hand there is nothing that\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychicat Research. [FEB.,1900.\nwould re\ufb02ect the stem. The Ghost is obviously something in the\nchair and is lighted quite naturally from the left-hand window. If\nit were a re\ufb02ection it would have the lighting of the thing re\ufb02ected.\nThis hypothesis fails to account for the white collar of the Ghost and\nfor the perfectly human outline from the top of the head down to the\nhand. The Ghost is not an image chalked on the chair-back.\nThe notion that a man entered the room during the exposure\nseems to me untenable. If there is only one door and that occupied\nby the camera, no man, visitor or servant, would commit the\n\ufb02agrant trespass of entering the room, knowing he would either spoil\nthe photograph or be included in it. What motive can be assigned\nfor such a proceeding? If there is another entrance and some one\nentered for no particular object\u2014and none is apparent\u2014then he\nprobably lounged in slowly as people enter rooms, stopping now and\nthen to look about him before settling down, and if so he would have\nleft many traces of himself in the photograph if he did not quite\nspoil it. There is no sign of any such intrusion\u2014with the possible\nexception of the Ghost himself, which is the point in dispute.\nLet us suppose that a man entered somehow and moved about\nwithout leaving a trail behind him\u2014can the Ghost be his photograph?\nViewed through a microscope the ghostly head is a thin white\nmist, through which the markings of the chair (apparently stamped\nleather) are visible. There is no eye, no mouth, no ear. The nose\nand cheekbone are slightly indicated. The brow is part of a ridge in\nthe chair-back. There seems to be a chin or small pointed beard.\nThe hand has no \ufb01ngers, and the shirt-cull\u2018 is continuous with what\nappears to be the back of the hand. There is practically no trunk at\nall to the Ghost, no left arm, no thighs or legs. The general effect is\ndistinctly human and for the most part independent of the chair\nmarks, and yet not one of the details can be recognised as human.\nWithout presuming to deny that such an image can be produced in\nthe ordinary way with a human sitter, I would point out that the\nexperimental photograph is not conclusive. Here we have a good half\nof a trunk showing the folds and seams of the coat, the form of the\ntie and collar ; we have the left arm pretty well marked, every feature\nof the face, the ear, and every \ufb01nger of the hand. The legs are\nslightly indicated. There is no doubt that this is the photograph of a\nman, whereas the ghostly image is more like the photograph of a\nclever sketch intended to produce a striking general effect with the\nleast possible detail. Examined piecemeal the Thing is not human;\nviewed as a whole it is most human and full of character, and some\nhave recognised in it a portrait.\n\fFm, 1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photography.\u201d 185\nUnless some better physical theory be found than those mentioned\nI should take the phenomenon to be an example of what is called\nSpirit-Photography. It is impossible to doubt that such photographs\nhave been honestly produced or obtained by Sir William Crookes,\nMr. Traill Taylor, Mr. Glendinning, Mr. Stainton Moses, Madame\nd\u2019Esp\u00e9rance and others. They are of three main classes\u2014(i) portraits\nof living discarnate beings or spirits, (ii) pictures of e\ufb02igies or lay\n\ufb01gures often very incomplete and not necessarily human-like, (iii)\nreproductions of physical pictures or other objects. Possibly the \ufb01rst\nsort has something of the second character\u2014the sitter has to undergo\nsome preparation for the photography. As to the process, the objects\nmay be rendered temporarily material and photographed like any\nphysical thing, or the plate may be affected without light, lens or\ncamera. The D. Ghost is, in my opinion, a phenomenon of the second\nclass produced in the \ufb01rst manner. It is a bit of sketchy spiritual\nmodelling set there to be photographed.\nThe Transparent Chair.\nThe chair in the middle of the room shows duplications due to the\nmovement of the camera\u2014e_g., the head of the leg farthest to the left\nand the twists of this and the other similar leg. The back legs have a\ndark stripe down the middle where the two images overlap. From\nthese indications I conclude that the chair was there during the whole\nof the exposure, and this is consistent with the opacity of the seat,\nwhich conceals a bright part of the carpet. Had the carpet been\nexposed for the shortest time it would have shown through the seat of\nthe chair. All that is intelligible. Now enter mysteries.\nThe wood of the chair where it is well-lighted and covers a well\nlighted background is transparent. The images seen through the\nwood are even better de\ufb01ned than the contiguous free parts, for they\nare not over-exposed. They look as if seen through smoked glass.\nThe legs are mostly transparent except the tops at the seat and the\nupper part of the right back leg. The horizontal bar at the right of\nthe seat is not transparent. The right-hand twisted pillar of the back\nis as transparent as glass. The lower rail shows the carpet through it,\nand a distinct though dark image of the bossy leg of the large chair\nbehind. The upper rail shows backs of books and a portion of the\nleather edging of the book-shelf\u2014the bright leaf-like objects. The\nleft-hand column is opaque, apparently because what lies behind is not\nbright, but the knob at the top is absent where the brightness begins.\nThe wood in front of the seat is unequally transparent, the left half\nbeing the clearer. This may be due to some difference in the \ufb01lm.\n\f186 Journal of Society for Peychical Research. [Fm., 1900.\nThis chair is the only transparent thing in tl1e room: the white patch on\nthe stem of the round table is the false image of the adjacent carpet.\nFrom these transparencies, considered by themselves, we should\ninfer that the chair was placed there after the background had been\nexposed for a short time, but this view is contradicted by the opacity\nof the seat and some parts of the wood.\nThe chair, while partaking of the general movement, may have\nbeen displaced relative to objects behind it. This would account for a\nslight margin of transparency, but not for all. To get a clear view of\nthe leg of the great chair the smaller one in front would have to\nbe moved half its width.\nIn the records of Spirit-Photography we read of transparency and\nduplication as concomitants of the spirit image\u2014see Mrs. Sidgwick\u2019s\npaper on the subject in the Society\u2019s Proceedings for l892.* To the\nscienti\ufb01c critic these accessories are proof enough that the photograph\nis fraudulent, though one might suppose that a practical photographer\nbent on deceit would be able to cover his tracks more skilfully. In\nthe D. photograph precisely the same concomitants occur, and the\noperator is an amateur above suspicion. For this reason I would not\ntake the judgment of 1892 as the last word on the subject.\nSpiritualistic apologists offered reasons and explanations that no\nself-respecting man or woman of science would entertain for a moment\n\u2014as that the spirits might move the camera; that their aura was a\nmedium of double refraction ; that they were able to alter the\nmaterial properties of things; and that the spirit light had power\nto pass through opaque substances. Mrs. Sidgwick makes short work\nof these pleas, but since then the Rtintgen photography has been'\ndiscovered and puts a somewhat different complexion on the matter.\nThere is a later case of abnormal transparency in connection with\nspirit-photography mentioned in Borderland (Vol. II., p. 317). Mr.\nStead sat to be photographed next a solid wooden pedestal, on which\nwas a pot containing a fern. The photograph shows a lady behind\nthe pedestal; the pedestal, without being moved, appears as if\nshortened by about a foot, and through it is seen the bottom of a\ncurtain behind and a rent in the curtain. He went again to be taken\nin the same position, but now there was no lady and the pillar had\nits everyday properties. The photographs are reproduced and con\ufb01rm\nthe report as to the shortening, but the rent is not visible, perhaps\nbecause the reproduction is bad. If the plant is the same in both\ncases, it appears larger and healthier in the \ufb01rst than in the second.\n* Vol. VII., p. 268.\n\fFEB.,1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSp1\u00a7rit-Phot0,qmphy.\u201d 187\nMr. Traill Taylor examined the photographs, and said of the\nshortening and transparency(p. 322) that \u201che could not offer even\na hypothesis. It was utterly inexplicable from the point of view\nof the photographic expert.\u201d\nThe same periodical (Vol. I., p. 446) has a still more surprising\ncase of this order taken indirectly from a Russian journal.\nLa Haute Science in its last number, among \u201c Glanes,\u201d has the following\ntaken from the Russian journal Nwas Vremia, of March 5th, 1894 :\u2014\n\u201cProfessor Wagner has just communicated to the branch devoted to\nphotography of the Imperial Technique Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Technique Imp\u00e9riale)\nof St. Petersburg a most extraordinary fact. Desiring to photograph a\nhypnotised subject, he directed upon him his camera, and by the aid of a\nKourdiou magnesium lamp made two instantaneous exposures, taking care\nto surround himself with all the precautions required in such a delicate\nmatter. Now when he examined the plates his astonishment was without\nbounds. The walls of the room, the furniture, the curtains, the carpets, all\nappeared in detail; only the subject was nowhere to be discovered. In\nplace of the person was to be seen on one of the plates a portion of his hand,\nand on the other a part of his boot, while the rest of the body was concealed\nby white spots appearing to rise in concentric layers. It was in his own\napartment, in the middle of a room closed and locked, into which nobody\ncould come while the professor hypnotised his subject and extended him\non a sofa, and whom no blanket or like material covered. The learned\nexperimenter not being able to give any satisfactory explanation of this\nphenomenon, a committee of three members was selected by the specialists\nof the Technique Society to repeat the experiment of Professor Wagner\non the same subject when hypnotised, in the same place and under the\nsame conditions.\u201d\nThe climax of transparency is reached when the object intended to\nbe portrayed is not found in the photograph at all\u2014not even a hand\nor foot. \u201cI know of one case,\u201d says Mr. Stead (l00. cit.) \u201cin which\nan amateur photographer photographed a visitor who was standing in\nfront of the mantelpiece. When the negative was developed there\nwas a photograph of the mantelpiece, but the \ufb01gure in front of it had\nentirely disappeared. This was a great mystery, but still greater was\nthe sequel. When showing that photograph to clairvoyants in Chicago\n\u2014the photograph, I may mention, was taken in England\u2014without\ntelling them of any mystery connected with the photo, they saw the\nmissing man standing with his back to the mantelpiece and described\nhim quite accurately, nor would they believe that I could not see the\nperson whom they saw quite unmistakably in the very centre of the\nphotograph.\u201d\nTo dismiss such accounts as fabulous for no other reason than\ntheir want of conformity with the scienti\ufb01c conventions of the day,\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1900.\nappears to me unwise. The science of to-morrow may have a use for\nthem. Why should it be assumed that science can explain every\nthing? Its theories were not originally framed to include or explain\nspiritual phenomena, and we cannot get much more from a theory\nthan we put into it. Natural laws being only human ideas, we may '\nexpect them to break down as knowledge advances.\nWimbledon, November 27th, 1 89 9.\nIII.\nBY PRoFEssoR W. F. BARRETT.\nI have read with much interest the foregoing discussion by Miss\nJohnson and Mr. McLachlan on the origin of the shadowy \ufb01gure\nwhich appeared in Miss Corbet\u2019s photograph of the library of a\nhistoric mansion, where she and her sisters happened to be staying.\n1. As regards the fact that there was more than one door into the\nlibrary, and that none of the doors were locked during the time the\nphotograph was being taken, this ought to have been more explicitly\nstated in the original account, which, however, was only a very brief\nsummary of the principal points in the correspondence which Miss\nCorbet had with me on the subject of this photograph during the\nearly part of 1895. In that account (Journal S.P.R., December,\n1895, p. 166) it is stated \u201cshe [Miss Corbet] was not in the room\nthe whole time, and did not lock the doors when she left the room.\u201d\nFrom which more than one door may be inferred.\n2. With reference to the moving of the chair which appears in the\nmiddle of the picture (not the arm-chair) after the exposure of the\nplate had begun, I agree with Miss Johnson that this is very probable.\nBut it is not impossible Miss Corbet may herself have moved the chair\ninto its present position after removing the cap from the camera. I\nhad intended to have an enlargement made of the original negative\u2014\nor at any rate to have projected an enlarged image on to a screen\u2014\nand examined the picture in detail ; this would doubtless have cleared\nup several obscure points, but the marriage of Miss Corbet, and her\ndeparture for India, took place in the course of the inquiry, and I\nhave not, as yet, been able to obtain the loan of the negative, though\nperhaps this may still be possible.\n3. Mr. McLachlan points out certain differences between the\nexperimental photograph which I took and the shadowy \ufb01gure in\nMiss Corbet\u2019s photograph. No doubt slight differences do exist. My\n\fFEB.,1900.] Discussion, of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photography.\u201d 189\nonly object in taking the photograph was to test the theory I had\nformed that the absence of legs and of one arm in the \u201cghost\u201d was\nprobably due to certain movements in a sitter, who, I assumed, might\nhave surreptitiously entered the room and seated himself in the arm\nchair during the long exposure of the plate. As this hypothesis was\nveri\ufb01ed in the very \ufb01rst experimental photograph taken, I did not\nthink it worth while to take another, nor to attempt to imitate more\nexactly the so-called \u201c spirit photograph.\u201d I have not the least doubt\nthat a few trials would enable any one to reproduce a \ufb01gure the\nfacsimile of that in the armchair in Miss Corbet\u2019s photograph.\n4. Lin Espin [see below] imagines the \ufb01gure seated in the chair pur\nposely tried to imitate a \u201cspirit photograph.\u201d He remarks \u201c how many\nwould know that to get this result [absence of the left arm and legs] a\ncontinuous motion was necessary?\u201d This is a gratuitous and needless\nsupposition. For my own part, I think the explanation I suggested in\nSeptember, 1895 (Journal, S.P.R., 1895, p. 170), remains the most\nprobable one, viz., \u201cThat one of the servants came into the room, sat\ndown in the chair, crossed his legs and then uncrossed them, looked\ndown for a few moments and then at the camera, saw he was being\ntaken, so got up and went away\u201d before Miss Corbet returned to the\nroom. I should have added \u201c and also swung his left arm to and fro,\nwhilst his right arm remained steady, resting on the elbow of the\nchair.\u201d The analysis of the evidence made by Miss Johnson in her\ninstructive contribution to the discussion renders this explanation\nstill more probable, and, I think, entirely disposes of Mr. McLachlan\u2019s\nview. As for Mr. Espin\u2019s remark that the \ufb01gure is \u201cin the shade\u201d\nand \u201c too low in the chair,\u201d the \ufb01rst is surely incorrect, as the light\nfrom an adjacent window is seen falling on the near side of the arm\nchair, and the second depends on the height of the person who sat in\nthe chair. As there were two young and beardless footmen in the\nhouse at the time, it was probably one of these lads whose sudden\nwhim gave rise to this quasi-spirit photograph.\n5. On the other hand it is right to give due weight to the fact\nthat the lady who took the photograph had, and I believe still has,\nsome hesitation in accepting the explanation I have given. And this\nnot for any of the reasons advanced by Mr. McLachlan and others,\nbut chie\ufb02y from the result of the inquiries made both by her and\nby myself. It would perhaps have been better to have published all\nthe correspondence, especially the letters as to the identi\ufb01cation of the\n\ufb01gure in the photograph by one of the deceased nobleman\u2019s nearest\nrelatives and some of his friends, while others who knew him equally\nwell denied the likeness. For my own part, after carefully weighing\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1900.\nT-w--_..__.-_-_ _ V\nall the evidence, I have little doubt that some such explanation as\nI have given is su\ufb02icient to account for the shadowy \ufb01gure.and its\nfancied resemblance to Lord D.\nIn conclusion permit me to draw attention to the singularly\nunscienti\ufb01c procedure of that omniscient gentleman who regularly\ncontributes to the English Zllechanic under the nom-ole-plume of a\n\u201cFellow of the Royal .Astronomical Society.\u201d In the \ufb01rst instance he\ngives in the columns of the English Zllechanic an elaborate story,\n\u201csupplemented by details\u201d in successive numbers, of how something\nvery like \u201ca spirit photograph\u201d was obtained by an amateur lady\nphotographer, and how, \u201cupon developing the negative, to her horror\nthis lady . . . at once, with her sister, recognised it [the \u201cspirit\nphotograph \u201d] as that of their father,\u201d whose funeral was taking place\nthat very day. (The italics are his.) Again: \u201cThey were so frightened\nat the result of what they had done that for some considerable\ntime they kept it to themselves.\u201d Now it turns out that all this is\npure \ufb01ction, and the story, as told by \u201cF. R. A. S.,\u201d is an absurdly\nincorrect and misleading version of an account which was published\nnearly three years previously in the Journal of the S.P.R. Further,\nthe account in the Journal was given at \ufb01rst hand, and only published\nafter inquiry and experimental investigation had enabled us to form\nsome rational explanation of the shadowy \ufb01gure in the photograph.\nOn the other hand, as the Editor of the S.P.R. Journal remarks\n(November, 1899, p. 143), \u201cF. R. A. S.\u2019s version is at least third\nhand, and may be more remote.\u201d It is, in fact, a highly-coloured\nnarrative, published without the smallest attempt at veri\ufb01cation. One\nwould imagine that under these circumstances, when \u201cF. R. A. S.\u201d\nhad the candour to state that his account was erroneous, some acknow\nledgment would have been made by this gentleman of the S.P.R.\nthat enabled him to correct his mistake ; otherwise there is no reason\nwhy the readers of the English illechanic should, upon the mere ipse\noliacit of \u201c F. R. A. S.,\u201d be called upon to disbelieve what he had pre\nviously led them to infer was information derived at \ufb01rst hand.\nLet me also draw attention to another remarkable statement\nmade by \u201cF. R. A. S.\u201d He writes: \u201c One extraordinary coincidence,\nidentifying this imperfect image with that of the deceased peer, I\npurposely suppress, as its mention would almost certainly lead to his\nidenti\ufb01cation.\u201d Again, in a subsequent number, he states : \u201cI very\nstudiously avoided even hinting at the nature of the coincidence\nwhich seemed to me so remarkable.\u201d Again, \u201c The peculiarity to which\nI referred . . . took the form of a privaiion.\u201d I think we have a\nright to ask \u201cF. R. A. S.\u201d what is this remarkable coincidence to\n\fFm3.,1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpi'rit-Photography.\u201d 191\nwhich he repeatedly alludes ; was it the absence of the legs or of the\nleft arm in the \ufb01gure, and was he confounding the deceased peer with\nhis ancestor who fought in the Peninsular war? In any case I hope\nthe readers of the English Zllechanic will in future view with some\nlittle distrust the opinions upon psychical phenomena and the animad\nversions upon the S.P.R. given by a \u201c Fellow of the Royal Astronomical\nSociety \u201d who conceals his greatness in anonymity.\nIV.\nBY OrHERs.\n[Readers of the Journal may remember an article in the November\nissue entitled \u201cAn Incorrect Version of a Case of Supposed \u2018Spirit\nPhotography,\u201d7 and referring to an account given in the English\nMechanic of Miss S.

In\na letter which I wrote (41,461) on p. 92 of your LXVIIIth Volume, I told a\nvery curious story of the apparition of the seated \ufb01gure of a deceased peer\nin a photograph taken of his empty library after his death \u2014a story which I\nsubsequently supplemented by details given on pp. 138, 186, 233, etc. This\nnarrative I reproduced, practically verbatim, as it was told me by a common\nfriend of mine and of the family\u2014himself a man of rank and title, whose\nveracity and bona \ufb01des are beyond all question or dispute, and who lent me\nthe photographs on which I commented. Now, however, I have learned,\nwithin the last 24 hours, that the account I gave (as it was given to me) was\nerroneous in many very material respects, and that the evidence that there\nwas anything supernatural, or \u201cspiritual,\u201d about the affair, is nearly as\nshadowy as the \ufb01gure itself. Let me correct some of my\u2014or my informant\u2019s\n\u2014misstatements seriatim. Imprimis, I have it now that Lord X. did not\ndie at (what I will call) X. Hall at all, but in London, X. Hall being let at\nthe time to the sister, Lady Z., of the actual photographer (whose name has\nsince been made public, so that I have no reason for concealing it), Miss\nCorbet. Secondly, neither Mrs. Y. nor Lady Z. were at X. Hall at the\ntime. Thirdly, it was by accident, and not by design, that the photograph\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Fm3.,1900.\nwas taken on the day of the funeral. Fourthly, neither of Lord X.\u2019s\ndaughters either took or developed the photograph. Fifthly\u2014and most\nimportant this is\u2014I was utterly misinformed as to the room having been\nclosed during the exposure of the plate in the camera, for Miss Corbet\nstates that \u201cthe door was left open all the time the photograph was being\ntaken, the camera being placed in the open doorway, while she and her\nsister went out for a walk, apparently leaving the house empty, except for\nthe servants.\u201d Now, this being so, I revert to what I said in letter 41,667,\non p. 233 of your LXVIIIth Volume: \u201cI am driven to the conclusion\nthat someone must have sat in the chair for a very short time during the\nexposure of the plate.\u201d I gather from an independent source that my\nfriend Mr. Espin\u2019s very interesting experiments on the production of a\nsimilar \u201cghost\u201d by light re\ufb02ected from a vase on a tall brass pole are\nto be the subject of further investigation. I need hardly reiterate here\nthat I have not the very slightest faith in \u201cspiritual\u201d apparitions, and\n(as I have often said), broadly divide spiritualists into two categories\nknaves (the so-called \u201cmedia \u201d) and fools (their dupes); but, like all\nmen of science, I hold my opinions more or less loosely, and regard\n\u201cAudi alteram partem \u201d as essentially the motto of every one who wishes\nto arrive at the truth. Hence, when I received the story, just as I told\n'it, from what I regarded as an absolutely unimpeachable source, I did\nnot think that my own belief or disbelief ought to stand in the way of\nmy making it public, however much it might con\ufb02ict with my own utter\nances, public and private. But this only furnishes yet another instance\nof the fallibility of testimony, or perhaps of the inability of the average\nman or woman to repeat a story with anything approaching to verbal\nor even material\u2014accuracy. I have been struck with this in one way,\namongst others, which might have acted as a caution to me. I sometimes\ndo a little conjuring, and have been at once amazed and amused to hear\ncertain of the spectators subsequently tell people what they had seen me\ndo ; so wildly wide of the truth have their perfectly ingenuous narratives\nbeen. However, I have, I hope, learned my lesson this time, and will\ntrouble my brother-readers with no more stories of apparitions, be they\nof peers or potboys, because I could only really give such a story \ufb01rst\nhand if I were myself qualifying for a lunatic asylum.\n[\u201c F. R. A. S.\u201d deserves every credit for the candour and promptitude\nwith which he has disclaimed the mistakes made in his original\nnarrative so soon after they were pointed out to him, and it is gratify\ning to \ufb01nd him endorsing so heartily our own warnings as to the\nfallibility of human testimony. It must be observed that his classi\ufb01ca\ntion of \u201cspiritualists\u201d into \u201cknaves and fools\" is represented, with\nsome magnanimity, not as an essential part of the creed of \u201c all men\nof science,\u201d but merely as his own opinion ; and we must acknowledge\nthe sense of justice and the courage displayed in not allowing his own\nbelief or disbelief to stand in the way of his making the story of the\n\fFEB.,1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photography.\u201d 193\nphotograph public, \u201chowever much it might con\ufb02ict with my own\nutterances, public and private.\u201d\nYet, for any one who really wishes both to \u201carrive at the truth,\u201d\nand also to speak it, something more even than a determination not\nto be in\ufb02uenced by his own preconceived opinions seems needed ,\nnamely, a careful examination of any report before making it public.\nIt was in this respect alone that the methods of \u201c F.

R. A. S.\u201d has\u2014no doubt, by accident\u2014omitted to mention\nthat it was through the Society for Psychical Research that he was\nenabled to correct the mistakes made in his original version ; but this\nomission is fully supplied in a letter from a Fellow of another learned\nsociety in the English Mechanic of November 24th, as follows] :\u2014\n[43,052.]\u2014As on former occasions \u201c F.R.A.S.\u201d has rather disparaged the\nSociety for Psychical Research, I think it fair to mention that it is they\nwho, in their Journal for November, have taken the trouble to correct his\nstatements.\nSo far from the Society being devoted to superstitions, it is really devoted\nto their study, the necessity for specialisation in which is shown by the\npresent instance. \u201c F.R.A.S.,\u201d having fallen into the very natural error of\npublishing such matter without laborious veri\ufb01cation, now announces that\nin future he shall reject all similar stories without examination.\nI write to point out that these are precisely the errors that have hitherto\nprevented any exact knowledge in these outlying departments of psychology.\nThe whole region of folk-lore, whether superstitious or supernormal, will\nnever be either exploded or explained without plenty of hard work. And\nwhatever the outcome of the Society\u2019s work may be, its subject-matter, the\nhuman mind, is, as Stanley Jevons said, of more importance to mankind\nthan all \u201c F.R.A.S.\u2019s \u201d stars and nebulae.\nI have heard a leading physicist object to biological work as \u201c messy,U\nand \u201cF.R.A.S.\u201d objects to this sort of psychology as \u201cfull of rogues and\ndupes,\u201d just as an ordinary pedestrian would object to rope-walking.\nPsychical research is the slack-wire of the sciences, and if \u201cF.R.A.S.\"\nwould become perfect in all the scienti\ufb01c virtues from agnosticism to\nsuspense of judgment, he cannot do better than engage in psychical research.\nHe will need them there as nowhere else.\nA FRm.ow oF THE GEoLoGICAL SoCnrTY.\n[Mr. T.

This copy she kindly placed at my disposal conditionally on\nits not being reproduced, or lent. Some dozen years ago there was con\nsiderable interest in a photo taken in this neighbourhood of the exterior of\na house, and between the white curtains of an upper window appeared a\nsomething, which the owner declared was the \ufb01gure of a deceased relative\nwho occupied that room. I obtained a look at the photo and saw very little\nresemblance to a man, and after examining the place found it was due to\nthe re\ufb02ection of the chimney-pot of a house opposite ! Remembering this and\nunderstanding that the library photo was above suspicion, I commenced to\nexamine the photo to see if any such cause was present. On turning the\nphotograph upside down and thereby eliminating all appearance of a human\n\ufb01gure, it seemed to me that the \u201c head\u201d was but a re\ufb02ection of the small\nand narrow part of the middle window from the bowl of the stand, and the\n\u201carm\u201d of the small part of the stem. The back of the chair, and more\nespecially the bust in the window, curtail the light that would fall on the\nstem of the stand. \u201c F.R.A.S.\u2019s \u201d second letter made me attempt to repro\nduce arti\ufb01cially the conditions, as mentioned in my letter to the EM. of\nDecember 2nd. The results of the visual experiments seemed conclusive, as\nthey did also to some friends.\nIt is very interesting to \ufb01nd that the exposure was a long one, as I\nanticipated, and it is possible that the breadth of the head may be due to\nthe shift in the line of light.\nProfessor Barrett\u2019s may, of course, be the correct explanation, but it\nseems to me that there are di\ufb02iculties in the way. In the \ufb01rst place the\nchair is in the shade ; in the next the \u201c \ufb01gure\u201d is too low in the chair, and\nin the third the disappearance of the whole of one side is inexplicable. It\nmay partly be explained by the continuous motion of the left arm as well as\nthe legs, but how many would know that to get this result such a con\ntinuous motion was necessary ? Moreover, a movement of the arm would\nleave the side still, and naturally, unless the person was left-handed, the\nmotion would be made with the right arm, not the left. The re\ufb02ection\ntheory is not without its di\ufb02iculties, as \u201c F.R.A.S.\u201d has pointed out to me\nin a private letter, but my experiments seemed to me fairly conclusive that\nit may have come about in this way.\nT.

SMITH.\nPREMATURE GENERALISATIONS ABOUT TELEPATHY.\n(Continued from the January \u201c Journal,\u201d 10. 176.)\nThe last number of the Journal contained a reprint of an article by\nan American writer, Mr. Edmund Willson Roberts, on \u201cSuccessful\nAttempts in Scienti\ufb01c Mind-Reading,\u201d purporting to give general\nrules, deduced from the writer\u2019s personal experience, for cultivating\nthe telepathic faculty. A careful examination of Mr. Roberts\u2019\nmethods, however, by Professor Newbold showed,\u2014as might perhaps\nhave been expected,\u2014that his rules were based on nothing beyond\na priori theories and that he had failed to allow for various sources\nof error which vitiated his results.\nProfessor Newbold\u2019s account is as follows :\u2014\nIn the second week of February, 1899, a gentleman presented himself to\nme, and informed me that his name was E. W. Roberts, that he not only\nwas possessed of telepathic powers himself, but was also able to develop\nsimilar powers in any person who would submit to his instructions. He\ngave me the details of several series of experiments in which he claimed to\nhave had remarkable success, and stated, as further proof of the truth of his\nclaims, that an article embodying his experience had been recently accepted\nby the Cosmopolitan .Magazinc.* He asked me to invite some of my friends\nto meet him, and to give him an opportunity of demonstrating his powers\nto us.\nOn the evening of Saturday, February 18th, Mr. Roberts met in my\nhouse Dr. Lightner Witmer, Assistant Professor of Psychology ; Mr. E. W.\nMumford, Registrar ; Mr. Verner Nisbet, a student of medicine, and myself.\nMr. Roberts brought with him an instrument which he called a \u201c tele\nposcope.\u201d It was a wooden box about 18 inches in length, 3 inches in depth,\nand varying in width from about 3 inches at the narrower end to about 6\ninches at the wider. It was covered within and without with black cloth.\nThe narrower end was cut in such a manner as to \ufb01t closely to the brow and\nabout the eyes, and the wider end was arranged with a slit in which the slip\n* This article appeared in the March number of that magazine.\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [FEB., 1900.\nof paper bearing the number in question could be placed, thus receiving its\nillumination from behind, through the paper. Mr. Roberts said that this\ninstrument would be found of use in concentrating the agent\u2019s attention\nand thereby facilitating the transmission of a telepathic impression to the\npercipient.\nAfter a somewhat rambling introduction, in which he repeated the sub\nstance of the statements which he had already made to me, he began a series\nof experiments under the following conditions :\u2014\nThe percipient was seated in a chair at the extreme end of the room, with his\nback to the group of agents. The group of agents sat at the other end of the\nroom, facing the back of the percipient. Immediately in front of the agents was\na table. Mr. Roberts had with him a series of numbers from 1 to 30. These\nhad been cut from a large wall calendar, and displayed the number in white\nupon a black ground, with the exception of the number 4 which was in red\nupon a black ground, the numbers having been taken from the month of\nJuly. Mr. Roberts selected the \ufb01rst nine digits and then threw out the\nnumbers 9 and 6, upon the ground that these were frequently confused by\nthe percipient. This reduced the numbers from which choice was to be\nmade to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Of these Mr. Roberts chose four, and told\nthe percipient which four he had selected, thus restricting the limit of choice\nto those four. The number to be guessed was then chosen by one of the\nagents from the four. The paper square bearing the number was propped up\non the table, facing the agents, and in a good light. The agents were\ninstructed simply to consider the number, and not to endeavour to will its\nperception by the percipient. The percipient was allowed two guesses.\nUnder these conditions the results were as follows :\u2014\nPercipient, L. Witmer, the other four being the agents :\u2014\nRANGE oF CHoICE. To BE GUEssED.

W 27\nAt this point I objected that the selection by the agents of the numbers\nto be guessed opened the door to unconscious identical preference on both\nsides, and therefore vitiated the results, and that the restriction of the\nguesses to the seven above-mentioned digits also tended to vitiate the\nresults. In deference to these objections we agreed that we should draw by\nchance from the ten digits the four numbers from which choice was to be\nmade, and from the four thus chosen, draw again by chance the one which\nwas to be guessed. The percipient was, however, told the four numbers\nwhich had been drawn, one of which he was to guess.

He him\nself prescribed the method. Dr. Witmer and Mr. Mumford served as agents.\nMr. Roberts grasped the agent\u2019s hand, and told him to allow his thoughts to\ndwell upon some one topic. Mr. Roberts then closed his eyes, and described\nthe pictures which, he said, were drifting before his mind. We did not time\nthese experiments, but I should judge that each lasted from three to \ufb01ve\nminutes. In neither case did Mr. Roberts\u2019 alleged visions bear the least\nrelation to what the agent was thinking about.\nAfter the other three gentlemen had left, I had a long conversation with\nMr. Roberts. I told him that the experiments showed not a sign of tele\npathy, and pointed out the secret of so many successful results, namely,\nthat the restriction of the choice to the four numbers gave the guesser one\nchance in four; that by giving him two guesses the chance of success was\nincreased to one chance in two; that the agent in selecting the numbers\nmight be guided by certain trivial preferences which would be equally felt\nby the percipient. Mr. Roberts seemed downcast and ill at ease, did not\ndeny\u2014-indeed tacitly admitted\u2014the truth of all I had to say, but was inclined\nto recount the remarkable success which he had had in his other experiments.\nI made no comment upon his stories, but urged him in all seriousness not\nto undertake to make alivelihood by the exhibition of his telepathic powers.\nI told him that if he once embarked in such a career he would be stamped\nas a fraud by all persons of intelligence, and would soon \ufb01nd the doors\nleading to an honest livelihood closed to him. The only reply he made to\nthis was to ask me whether I thought there would be any dishonesty in his\naccepting money for teaching the methods of experimentation, provided he\nmade no claims to the possession of telepathic powers. I told him that I\nwould not regard it as dishonest, but advised him to observe that in the\nexperiments which we had just \ufb01nished, certain vital errors had been found\nin the methods of experimentation, which, as he himself admitted, entirely\nvitiated the results, and that none of these errors had been pointed out by\nhim ; that on the contrary he had obviously relied upon them for the attain\nment of the successful results. This also he admitted, so far as related to\nthe series of experiments just concluded, but declared that he still felt con\ufb01\ndence in the results which he had secured before. When we parted he\nseemed very much depressed. He called on me again, about ten days later,\nand asked me if I would be willing to arrange for some long distance experi\nments with him.

W. H. Myers had been\nelected President of the Society for the present year.\nMR. F. PoDMoRE read a paper on \u201c Witchcraft and Poltergeists.\u201d\nHe began by explaining that Poltergeist is a term that it has been\nfound convenient to apply to those spontaneous outbreaks of stone\nthrowing, movements of furniture, bell-ringing, and the like, which\n\fMAR, 1900.] General Meeting. 205\noccur from time to time, and have occurred for many generations past,\nchie\ufb02y in villages and remote country districts. In the inquiries\nundertaken by the Society these outbreaks form an important feature ;\n\ufb01rst, because they form the nearest, practically the only, analogy\nto the physical manifestations occurring in the presence of Home,\nEusapia Paladino, and other mediums; and, in the second place,\nbecause, as a matter of historical fact, the movement of modern\nSpiritualism in its present form had its rise in Poltergeist manifesta\ntions of the ordinary type.\nMr. Podmore then referred brie\ufb02y to the Rochester knockings of\n1848 (from which Modern Spiritualism is commonly dated) and to the\nless known case, occurring a year or two later, in the house of Mr.\nPhelps, a clergyman, in Stratford, Connecticut. In the last-named\ncase, stones, turnips, and brickhats were thrown about, windows were\nbroken, the \ufb01re-irons and tables are said to have moved about of their\nown accord, and one of the family to have been carried through the\nair. Spirit-writings were found about the house, and so on.\nHe then drew attention to the fact that in these two cases, as\nin the great majority, these Poltergeist disturbances centred round\nyoung children, who must be regarded, according to the view taken,\neither as the authors in their own proper persons of the disturbances,\nor the \u201cmediums\u201d for the occult agencies. Generally, then, the\nauthors or mediums were children, mostly girls; more rarely they\nwere young women; rarely adults\u2014and practically never adult men.\nModern Spiritualism may be said to have originated in the activi\nties, mediumistic or other, of young children.\nNow if we examine the witchcraft literature of the 16th and 17th\ncenturies, we are struck by the same characteristics\u2014the prominence\nassumed by young children. Sometimes, as in the well-known case,\nquoted in Glanvil\u2019s Sadducismus Triumphatus, of Moira in Sweden, and\nthat of Antoinette Bourignon\u2019s school at Lisle, the children merely\naccused themselves of witchcraft. Such self-accusation was not rare even\namongst adults, and the more impressionable imaginations of children\nwould naturally be worked upon more rapidly and more effectively by\nthe permanent possibilities of suggestion in their environment.\nBut the typical case of witchcraft, at any rate in the English\nspeaking countries, during the period referred to, was not of this kind.\nIf we exclude such cases of witchcraft persecution as originated in\ndirect interference from without\u2014royal, priestly, or professional\u2014e.g.,\ncases of the numerous \u201c witc-h\ufb01nders,\u201d of whom Matthew Hopkins was\nthe most notorious: if we exclude all such cases, and \ufb01x our atten\ntion only on the cases which occur spontaneously, most commonly\n\f206 Journal of Society for P8?\/0'L\u2019l0(Ll Research. [MAR., 1900.\nin country districts, we shall \ufb01nd that their course was something\nof this kind. A little boy, or more commonly, little girl, conceived\na dislike or horror of some old woman in the neighbourhood: as we\nshould say now, the old woman got on the child\u2019s nerves. Some\nchance encounter or unforeseen incident would bring on a climax;\nthe child would go into \ufb01ts, which the country doctors who were\ncalled in found themselves unable either to diagnose or to cure.\nIn these \ufb01ts the child would continually call on the old woman\u2019s\nname. The paroxysms would increase in violence if the old woman\napproached, would diminish when, on this showing. backed by some\nintangible tri\ufb02e called \u201c corroborative evidence,\u201d the old woman was\napprehended ; and would be \ufb01nally cured when the old woman was\nexecuted.\nSome illustrative cases were then quoted from Glanvil and other\n16th and 17th century writers : A Poor Woman\u2019s Boy at Droitwich,\nin 1649, who was struck dumb because he came suddenly on an old\nwoman behind a bush, who said \u201cBoh\u201d to him. Richard Jones,\nof Shepton Mallet, aged twelve, who was asked by Jane Brooks for a\npiece of close bread, and received an apple in return : the boy ate of\nthe apple, became seriously ill, and called upon Jane Brooks in his\ntits; and when his father scratched Jane .Brooks\u2019s face became\nimmediately the better of the attacks. Further, a neighbourstruck\nwith a knife at a corner of the room, where Richard said that he saw\nJane\u2019s apparition: and Jane Brooks was straightway discovered by\nthe village constable nursing a recent wound which the knife exactly\n\ufb01tted.\nIn many cases, which Mr. Podmore brie\ufb02y touched upon, the child\u2019s\n\ufb01ts were accompanied by vomiting of pins, straw, nails, stubble, etc. :\nby throwing of stones, movements of furniture, and even of the\nbewitched girl herself. In these cases we get very near to modern\nPoltergeists.\nFinally a detailed account was given of the well-known Drummer\nof Tedworth, which the speaker described as admirably marking the\ntransition stage between the witchcraft cases and the modern Polter\ngeist.\nIn the Tedworth case the disturbances,\u2014as is clear from Glanvil\u2019s\naccount, read critically,\u2014centred round the children, two little girls;\nand the manifestations were, as far as can be gathered, much like those\nthat occur in any country village nowadays\u2014furniture upset, stones\nand Bible thrown about, rappings and noises on the wooden frame\nof the bedstead where the children lay, and loud noises of all kinds\nabout the house. But in this case the disturbances were referred, not\n\fMan, 1900.] General Itleeting. _ 207\nto the agency of the children, but to the malevolence of the imprisoned\ndrummer.\nAfter the 17th century, however, the reference to a supposed\nwitch or wizard as the author of the disturbances disappears. In the\nWesley case, the Stockwell case, the Cook Lane Ghost, and other\ntypical Poltergeist cases, we hear no more of witchcraft. It is a\nunembodied spirit\u2014human or el\ufb01sh\u2014who is now supposed to be\nresponsible for the outbreak.\nBut the phenomena are essentially the same. It is true that\npsuedo-epileptic \ufb01ts and vomiting of pins have gone out of fashion;\nthe least enlightened of country apothecaries could hardly fail nowa\ndays to diagnose such attacks as compounded of hysteria and ill\ntemper. And the other manifestations have developed with the\ndemands of the environment. But the motive power, whether ascribed\nby the spectator to the malevolence of witchcraft, the trickery of\nspirits, or the action of mysterious forces, is essentially the same.\nThe mischievous child who nowadays throws surreptitious stones or\nupsets a chair when no one (except Mr. Westlake) is looking, is the\nspiritual descendant of the child whose sickly fancies and hysterical\nspite brought about the death of many an uno\ufb02ending old woman in\nthe days of the witchcraft persecutions.\nMR. ADoLPHE SMITH said that he thought it would be interesting\nto hear what evidence there was for the alleged phenomena. No doubt\nmany of them might be attributed to the power of self-suggestion; but\nmany others of the cases cited, e.g., that of Jane Brooks, seemed to go\nfar beyond this.\nMR. PoDMoRE replied that in the present paper he had not been\nattempting to discuss the evidence for the real occurrence of the\nphenomena referred to, but merely to show the analogy between what\nwas supposed to occur in witchcraft cases and in modern Poltergeist\ncases. As to the question of evidence, it was true that there was an\nenormous amount of tradition, e.g., about wounds produced in human\nbeings as a result of injuries in\ufb02icted at a distance on the form of the\nanimal supposed to represent them ; but he had met with nothing that\ncould be called evidence for such : that is, the evidence was never given\nat \ufb01rst-hand ; even in the testimony given by the most uneducated\npeasants, there was practically no first-hand evidence for these\noccurrences.\nA paper by Mr. F. C. S. SCHILLER \u2018- On Some Philosophic Assump\ntions in the Investigation of the Problem of a Future Life \u201d was then\nread by MR. J. G. SMITH. This paper has since appeared in the\nProceedings, Part XXXVI.\n\f208 Journal of Society for Peychical Research.

Later came many\nanother scene ;\u2014pacings in the Old Court of Trinity with Edmund\nGurney, who met those generous paradoxes with humorous play;\ngraver hours at Oxford, in the sick room of the Duke of Albany,\nwho, coming back to earth-life from perilous illness, found nowhere a\nguidance \ufb01tter than Ruskin\u2019s for eager and royal youth.\nBut chie\ufb02iest I think of him in that home of high thoughts where\nhis interest in our inquiry \ufb01rst upgrew.

To\none among that company a vision came,\u2014as of a longed-for meeting\nof souls beloved in heaven,\u2014a vision whose detail and symbolism\ncarried conviction to Ruskin\u2019s heart. While that conviction abode\n\fMAR.,1900.] Obituary: John Ruskin. 209\n\u2014.\nwith him he was happy as a child ,- but presently he suffered what all\nare like to sulfer who do not keep their minds close pressed to actual\nevidence by continuous study. That impress faded; and leaving the\nunseen world in its old sad uncertainty, he went back to the mission\nwhich was laid on him,\u2014that mission of humanising this earth, and\nbeing humanised thereby, which our race must needs accomplish,\nwhatever be the last doom of man.\nEarth \ufb01lls his lap with pleasures of her own ;\nYearnings she hath 1n her own natural kind ;\nAnd even with something of a Mother's mind\nAnd no unworthy aim,\nThe homely Nurse doth all she can\nTo make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,\nForget the glories he hath known,\nAnd that imperial palace whence he came.\nBut Ruskin\u2019s task,\u2014however it might be pursued in forgetfulness\nof that unrememberable home,\u2014was surely still the task (as Bacon\ncalled it) \u201cto prepare and adorn the bride-chamber of the mind and\nthe universe\u201d ; and that MELIoR NATURA which seemed to be Ruskin\u2019s,\nas it was Bacon\u2019s, divinity has never shone more radiantly upon the\ninward shrine of any lover of men. It was half in jest that I would\ncomplain to him that to Earth he gave up what was meant for Iniinity,\nand bent a cosmic passion upon this round wet pebble of rock and sea.\n\u201c Ah, my friend ! \u201d he answered once when I spoke of life to come, \u201c if\nyou could only give me \ufb01fty years longer of this life on earth, I would\nask for nothing more!\u201d And half that season was granted to him,\nand all in vain ;\u2014for what Tithonus may tread for ever unweary the\n\u201c gleaming halls of Morn \u201d ?\nThen as that fervent life wore on, Ruskin turned more and more\nfrom the outward pageant to the human passion; from Alp and sunset\nto the sterner beauty of moral law. From the publication of Unto this\nLast one may trace that slowly-growing revolt against the Age which\nled him to preach in the end with such despairing emphasis the duty\nof protest, of renunciation, of sheer self-severance from most of the\ntendencies of Inodern life. The strength of this emotion in him was\nmade, I remember, strangely plain on one occasion, when some of those\nwho cared most for him had clubbed together, at Lord Mount-Temple\u2019s\nsuggestion, to surprise him, on his recovery from a serious illness, with\nthe present of a picture of Turner\u2019s, which he had once possessed and\nstill dearly loved, but of which he had despoiled himself to meet some\ngenerous impulse.

'\nIndeed there was something naive, something childlike, in his\nBrotherhoods, his Leagues, his solemn Covenants against the on\ufb02owing\ntide of things ;\u2014but a stern reality beneath all this became strongly\npresent to us then ;\u2014a deep compassion for the lonely heart, which so\nmuch needed love, yet could scarcely accept a fellowship in love which\nwas not also a fellowship in all that he held for virtue.\nThere are some who fear lest too pervading a belief in that other\nworld may make men indifferent to the loveliness and irresponsive to\nthe woes of this. Yet must that needs be so? or might we not treat\neven this world\u2019s problems with steadier heart, could we regain,\u2014from\nsome surer foothold in the Invisible,\u2014that ancient serenity of the\nSaints? Watching that ardent soul, whose very raptures trembled on\nthe brink of pain, I have thought that even from Ruskin\u2019s delight in\nNature something of bitter yearning might have been soothed away,\ncould he have seen in stream and moorland, nay even in\n' great Skiddaw\u2019s self, who shrouds\nHis double head among Atlantic clouds,\nAnd pours forth streams more sweet than Castaly ;\u2014\ncould he have seen, I say, in these, as Plato saw in Castaly or in\nHymettus, only the transitory adumbration and perishing symbol of\nsomewhat more enduring and more fair. Nay, even from his com\npassion for stunted and e1.-ring souls might not the burning pain have\ngone, could he have seen those souls as Er the Paphlagonian saw them,\nmarshalled in an everlasting order, of which but a moment\u2019s glimpse\nis shown ;\u2014till even \u201cthis last\u201d of men shall follow out, through all\nvicissitude, his endless and his mounting way?\nAnd turning then, with heart full of such-like fancies, to that\nwell-loved Leader\u2019s fate ;~imagining his bat\ufb02ed isolation, and the\ndisheartenment of solitary years ;\u2014I have pictured him waiting in\nthe Coniston woodlands, as (Edipus in Colonus\u2019 grove,\u2014waiting in\nmournful memory, in uncomplaining calm,\u2014till he should hear at\nlast the august summons,\u2014nay, sounded it not like the loving\nbanter ?\u2014of the unguessed accompanying God. \u201c Come, (Edipus, why\nlinger on our journey?

PIPER AND\nTELEPATHY : \u201d\nA partial reply to Mr. Andrew Lang.\nBY PRoFEssoR OLIvER LoDGE.\nMr. Andrew Lang\u2019s criticism (Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXXVL,\np. 39) of Mrs. Piper\u2019s trance utterances is in many ways interesting,\nespecially as coming from one who has taken the trouble to study the\nwhole subject from the historical and literary standpoint, and has\ntherefore approached this instance of trance utterances, one must\nsuppose, without any unreasonable amount of prepossession. His read\ning of the record has led him to a position hostile to Mrs. Piper, or\nrather to Mrs. Piper\u2019s controls, to an attitude somewhat critical of\nthose observers and recorders who have regarded the simplest and\nmost obvious hypothesis (viz., the one now adopted by Dr. I-Iodgson)\nwith some degree of favour, and decidedly impressed by the evidence\nof those observers who have been able, on the strength of one or perhaps\ntwo sittings, to regard the whole matter as a stupid fraud or a poor\nimposture.\nHe cites again Professor Macalister\u2019s \u201cindelible blot.\u201d \u201cI let her\nsee a blot on my \ufb01ngers and she said I was a writer.\u201d Has it occurred\nto any reader what is the precise connotation of that \u201c I let her see \u201d?\nThe suggestion is that the blot was consciously obtruded in front of\nMrs. Piper\u2019s eyeballs, and that the deduction followed. Is this an\nexact statement of the sequence of events? Those who have had much\nexperience of Mrs. Piper\u2019s sittings will doubt it. Even those with no\nexperience may conjecture that the clue a\ufb02brded by the blot was\nappreciated by the sitter afterwards.\n\f1vLm., 1900.] Re\ufb02ections on Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 213\nSo much has been made by critics of this blot of Professor Macalis\nter\u2019s, and of his single attempt at a sitting, when Mrs. Piper does not\nappear to have gone into anything like a thorough trance, that I am\ntempted to say further that a person with blotted \ufb01ngers is more likely\nto be a yokel, or an experimenter with a fountain pen, than a practised\nscribe. Few people are not \u201c writers\u201d in the only sense that can be\ndeduced from blotted \ufb01ngers ; and in any other sense it is not apparent\nto me that the epithet is specially applicable to Professor Macalister,\nnot so applicable as to Mr. Lang for instance. Had she guessed that\nhe was an anatomist there might have been something worth a\nmoment\u2019s attention.\nThe whole sitting is worthless, the phenomenon did not occur, and\nit is impossible even for a scienti\ufb01c man of the utmost ability to\nconstruct a satisfactory theory from a single experience of the non\noccurrence of a given phenomenon.\nProfessor Macalister\u2019s one sitting was a bad one. I have stated in\nmy Report that bad sittings occur, and have given an example of one\nthat I had myself. (Vol. VI., p. 494.) It might be possible to call\non Miss Angus even, and have nothing but dim and unsatisfactory\ncrystal visions reported, but Mr. Lang would not expect the testimony\nof that afternoon to outweigh the witness of his own record, nor even\nto be seriously taken into consideration. Anybody can fail to get\ncrystal visions : I can myself.\n\u201c G. P. frequently gives false information about what is occurring\nat a distance.\u201d So sometimes do the newspapers. But I presume that\nthey. both do their level best to get true information if they can, and\nmay not always be able infallibly to discriminate. Clairvyoance does\nnot appear to be a perfectly assured faculty; infallibility still less so.\n\u201cIf Phinuit or G. P. were honourable spirits, they would say that\nthey do not know what they do not know.\u201d Well, well, perhaps they\nwould. I try to do so myself. Perhaps I succeed. Mr. Lang must\nfeel very sure about this or he would not say it so con\ufb01dently.\nAgain he says Phinuit is \u201c vulgar beyond belief,\u201d also \u201c tricky,\nevasive, false, dishonest, impudently-mendacious, absurdly-ignorant,\u201d\nin fact, a \u201cpreposterous scoundrel \u201d (though this last is in quotation\nmarks).\nI honestly do not feel sure what Phinuit is: he is certainly a\nsecondary personality of Mrs. Piper\u2019s, I take it, though he may be\nmore; but whatever he is, I have a friendly feeling for him. If he\nwere a living person, I should have to say that he was a friend of mine,\nand that I resented this \ufb02uent \u201c derangement of epitaphs.\u201d That he is\nfrequently \u201c evasive\u201d I admit, that he is \u201c slim \u201d when in positions of\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1900.\ndi\ufb02iculty I do not deny, but \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cimpudently-mendacious\u201d\nI have not found him ; and in the matter of \u201cignorance \u201d he is far less\nignorant than I should have expected any one\u2014even a secondary per\nsonality\u2014to be, concerning the relatives and private affairs of strangers;\nwhile as to \u201cvulgarity \u201d it is a matter of taste perhaps : there is very\nlikely some inherent vulgarity about the procedure of a Private Enquiry\nOt\ufb01ce, even when conducted to all appearances from another order of\nconsciousness and for scienti\ufb01c objects, but I could readily imagine a\nmore real and deeper-seated vulgarity than the comic coarseness of poor\nold Phinuit, A person with no power of obtruding himself when\nnot wanted, who must be willingly sought, and can be dismissed or\nabandoned at pleasure, seems to me to lack many of the essential\ningredients of vulgarity. But in addition to this I do not personally\n\ufb01nd him repellent. He might be described, as some Colonials have\nbeen described, as one who \u201cbehind a slangy manner hides alarge and\nwarm heart.\u201d The ethics of Phinuit, so far as I have observed them,\nseem to me superior to those of some men whom I have known.\nJudged by a person skilled in human nature, by Shakespeare, shall we\nsay, or by Dickens, not to go too high, by any one who rates human\nkindness and friendly service above dignity of manner and high\neducation, I do not think that he would take a low position.\nA secondary personality, says Mr. Lang, may be far worse than\nthe man himself: \u201c A man mad drunk may beat his mother to death ;,,\nbut that such ideas come anywhere within Mr. Lang\u2019s mental horizon\nwhen thinking of Phinuit, whether he be only a secondary personality\nor whatever he he, shows how miserably erroneous is the impression\nproduced by a detailed record of unwitnessed proceedings. It is becom\ning apparent to me that adetailed record of every word is not in one\nsense a faithful record. We are not accustomed ever to see every\ninane and tri\ufb02ing remark recorded, not even in the worst novel ever\nwritten; the bald, literal, mechanical record would be too nauseous.\nA selection of the more interesting portions of any conversation is\ninvariably made. A telephone message, taken and faithfully tran\nscribed by a clerk, does not contain the calling-up trwialities, nor the\nintorjectional observations during intervals of cutting off, nor remarks\naddressed to the operator, nor every misunderstood word said, repeated,\nspelled, and ultimately guessed. The \ufb01nal record may not be correct,\nit may contain errors ; and if the telephone is partially out of order,\nor if many cross-currents are in the line, there may be confusion ; but\nthe written message, as handed in, does not contain all this cross-talk ;\nit aims at being a faithful record of what was intended, not amechani\ncal reproduction of everything that occurred, with the rubbish\n\fMAR.,1900.] Re\ufb02ections on Mrs. Pipe'r and Telepathy. 215\nemphasised. In much of the Piper record it is otherwise, the rubbish\nis emphasised, and an effort is made to represent the whole occurrence ;\nit is proper that it should be so, but it is well in reading it to remember\nthe fact. otherwise the record is liable to be misjudged.\nIf Mr. Lang has really read the whole record carefully through,\nannotations and all, it is a big piece of work, for which we observers\nowe him gratitude. Too many there are who will not take this\ntrouble. If the result of this study is to leave him under the illusion\nmanifest in his criticism, perfectly fair and candid as I am sure it\nis intended to be, then that is for us very instructive. We have not\nthe slightest ground for complaint, we must be content to learn that\nthat is the impression which our research makes on the mind of a man\nhighly versed in cognate subjects and approaching it with no incurably\nhostile predilection. He has some hostile predilection, I fear ; he has\nsaid that he would not himself consent to sit with Mrs. Piper, I\nbelieve, and he is sure his own deceased friends would avoid her; but I\nhope that these are not among his more serious utterances.\nAs for his contention that one and the same class of explanation\nmust serve for savage mediums as serves for Mrs. Piper, I admit it\ncordially. The admission of a modern case will not make the ancient\ncases, of which he knows so much, the less interesting, rather more.\nWith some persons such an appeal would be hopeless and\nludicrous, but to Mr. Lang I would venture to appeal not to be so\nready to recognise evil speaking lying and slandering in the trance\nutterances even of Mrs. Piper. I can assure him, if that is any good,\nthat he is mistaken, and that he could get a truer idea of the actual\nfacts in this case, facts as interesting in reality as those many other\nfacts of a similar nature in which he is so learnedly and effectively\ninterested, if he extended even to a record of trance utterances by\nsecondary personalities something of that, I will not say charity,\nbut readiness to allow for ditliculties and misconceptions, which he\nis willing to extend to the embodied folk usually denominated \u201c real.\u201d\nAnd now a few words concerning the episodes related by my\nsoi-disant \u201cUncle Jerry.\u201d Mr. Lang has gone through them and\ndetected inconsistencies in all but the \u201csnake-skin.\u201d They were\nepisodes of long ago (some of them 7O or 80 years ago now), of which\nI, the sitter, knew nothing, related ostensibly by one deceased brother,\nand attempted to be veri\ufb01ed by subsequent inquiry from one or other\nof two still living but spatially distant brothers. I will call the\nauthors of the two versions the deceased and the living respectively.\nTheir importance, if any, was that they eliminated anything that can\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAR., 1900.\nproperly and on experimental grounds be called telepathy; they do\nnot eliminate (I do not see how anything can eliminate) sheer clairvoy\nance; but telepathy, the only vera causa known tome, was eliminated.*\nI took the trouble to make an index of all the episodes of this kind\nin the report of the \ufb01rst published series of sittings, not only of my\nown sittings ; and in the preamble to that index I point out that by\nno means all are equally conclusive, but that some kind of normal\nexplanation may be suggested for several, conceivably for all. (See\nVol. VI., p. 649.)\nMr. Lang does not dispute the contention that telepathy is elimi\nnated, but he denies the concordance between the two accounts of\neach veri\ufb01ed episode, the account of the deceased (so to speak), and\nthat of the living. He says they are episodes such as occur in the\nexperience of almost every human boy, and evidently he is able to\nregard them as shots.\nNow, with deference, I submit (1) that the recently (or shortly to\nbe) published normal experiments of Professor Hyslop in New York\n-show that coincidences less accurately related than these do serve as\ntrustworthy evidence for identi\ufb01cation in ordinary life;\n(2) that the discrepancies are not so marked as might be ima gined,\nthough certainly the memories of the deceased and the living do no\ntally. I have known such cases in life, where a little subsequent\ncomparison and conversation between the witnesses has resulted in a\nbetter agreement; others in which each side adhered pertinaciously _\nto their own version, when it was not easy for a bystander to judge\nwhich was the more nearly right ;\n(3) that the episodes have not, in fact, occurred in the experience\nof every human boy, though there is truly about them nothing in the\nleast out of the common. Take the accounts and offer them to a\nhuman boy, or to one who has been in that predicament, as an account\n-of what passed in his boyhood, related by_a friend or brother of his\nnow abroad, and, as a rule, he will repudiate them.\nBut now about the discrepancies of the versions, what do they\namount to? Setting aside the episodes which have been unveri\ufb01able,\npossibly through error, possibly through defective memory of survivor,\n-and attending only to those which I have indexed, I will tabulate\nthe versions side by side. Version A is that of the ostensible\ndeceased, Version B is that of one or other living brother. The\ndeceased had given his name as Jerry : a fact however which, of course,\nI knew well.\n* Concerning the meaning of this statement, see Postscript at end of this paper.\n\f.\\'IAR.,1900.] Re\ufb02ections on Mrs. Pipe'r and Telepathy. 217\n\u201cPRoCssomGs,\u201d PART XVII.

[Mxn., 1900.\nThose are all the episodes among this particular set of communi\ncations which I have claimed and indexed as against the telepathic\nhypothesis.* There are several incidents recalled or imagined by one\nside and not recalled by the other ; and the episodes recollected by both\nI have here recorded in the most favourable manner.\nNot very strong? VVel], no, perhaps not. Have they in my own\nmind de\ufb01nitely decided me against what is ordinarily understood by\nthe telepathic hypothesis? No, I cannot say that they have. The\nwhole body of evidence distinctly has done as much as that, but hardly\nthese episodes taken by themselves; nor, so far as I can tell, has any\none of the other episodes indexed by me, considered by itself.\nCrucial experiments are seldom really crucial, or at least seldom\nproduce their full e\ufb02'ect on a mind not otherwise prepared for their\nwitness.\nBelief is caused not by crucial incidents but by prevalent tendency\nand integration of the whole experience ; and it is on this totality of ex\nperience that I believe the Piper phenomenon to be no more explicable\non any rem causa that science is aware of (including telepathy) than\nare Miss Angus\u2019s visions. I do not suppose that any one explanation\nwill cover every class of these abnormal facts. So long as the\nphenomena are di\ufb02'erent the explanations may di\ufb02'er too. But when\nin past times similar phenomena are recorded, then I should say that\nthose may be properly covered by the same explanation, whatever that\nmay be.\nIn connection with my remark quoted approvingly by Dr. Hodgson\nthat a certain kind of widespread and unconscious telepathy,\n\u201c telepathy at trois,\u201d as Mr. Lang well calls it, had never been experi\nmentally established, Mr. Lang virtually asks me whether his experi\nences in crystal vision with Miss Angus are not \u201cexperimental\u201d in my\nsense of the word.\nUndoubtedly they are,\u2014for I was not distinguishing between\nexperiment and observation ;\u2014and very valuable and interesting\nexperiments. But what do they establish? not telepathy ; clairvoyance,\nperhaps, whatever that may mean. I cannot explain the phenomenon\nof Miss Angus, nor can I explain the phenomenon of Mrs. Piper, but\nsurely one does not discredit the other.\nNo, Mr. Lang would say, but they discredit the intervention of the\nspirits of the dead,\u2014that antique and obvious hypothesis now adopted\nby Dr. Hodgson, and so made for the moment semi-respectable.\n\" See Postscript.\n\fMan, 1900.] Re\ufb02ections on Mrs. 1\u2019iper and Telepathy. 219\nIn calling it the most simple and natural hypothesis, I do so\nchie\ufb02y on historical grounds\u2014which are manifest \u2014but I do so also to\nsome extent on the grounds indicated by Mr. Schiller in his recent\npaper: \u201c On some philosophic assumptions in the investigation of the\nproblem of a future life.\u201d (Proceedings, Part XXXVI., p. 53 )\nMr. Lang prefers the hypothesis of a secondary personality; for\nwhich in itself there is undoubtedly much to be said, though I do not\nsee that the lucidity of such a personality is as yet explained, any more\nthan I understand the explanation of the lucidity of Mr. Huxley\u2019s\nsoldier-whose-skull-had-been-fractured-by-a-bullet. A plain man would\nsuppose the result of such an accident to be the reverse of lucidity.\nThere is further the hypothesis of Cosmic pictures, or communion\nwith the Absolute, or, as I might put it, a psychological modi\ufb01cation\nof our usually conceived ideas of space and time.\nFor myself I incline to this latter hypothesis, if it can be called\none. Miss Angus sees in the crystal events in India. Mr. Lang says\nthey cannot be pictures, because the events are three weeks old at the\ntime. Pictures are sometimes three centuries old,\u2014but, without press\ning that, why, if she transcends the ordinary bounds of space, should _\ntime present a hopeless obstacle?\nMr. Lang may not object to the hypothesis vaguely suggested here :\nindeed, I do not see how a secondary or tertiary or any other\npersonality helps towards an explanation, unless something of this\npower be granted hypothetically to it, but he objects to the agency of\nspirits of the dead. He says \u201c that in his experiments there was no\nroom for the theory of spirits of the dead, for all concerned were\nalive.\u201d Alas, here again I do not know. I can only wonder how Mr.\nLang knows. Does Mr. Lang really agree with Mr. Podmore that\noverstretched telepathy from the living is likely to be the true and real\nexplanation of these cases\u2014of such a case as he cites in connection\nwith his friend Mr. Lesley for instance? If so, I cannot argue other\nwise, but my instinct is against it. I would rather say that the clear\nand valid and scienti\ufb01cally expressible explanation is still to seek.\nPostscript.\nSince writing the above I have seen Mrs. Sidgwick\u2019s article in Pro\nceedings, Part XXXVI., on the \u201cTrance Phenomena of Mrs. Piper ;\u201d\nwhere, accepting provisionally as a working hypothesis and for the\nsake of argument, some intervention or agency of dead persons, that\nis, persons with no organs known to anatomy or physiology, she\nattempts to discriminate between two varieties of this hypothesis,\u2014\nthe variety which assumes that these persons act telepathically on the\n\f220 J0wr'na,t of Society for Psycluicrtl Res-ewrch. [MAB.,1900.\ndream mind of Mrs. Piper, or the variety which assumes that they\nenter and \u201cpossess\u201d and utilise a part of her body for a time, in\nsomewhat the same way as she herself normally uses it.\nIn my letter above I have not contemplated this distinction. The\ndistinction I have drawn, between telepathy and something else, refers\nsolely to telepathy in Mr. Podmore\u2019s sense ; a distinction between the\nhypothesis of telepathy from some living, though it may be distant,\nperson, and any other hypothesis whatever of the ultra-normal kind.\nIt is in this sense, and in this sense only, that I have said that in\ncertain few cases \u201cthe hypothesis of telepathy was excluded.\u201d I am\nunable to regard telepathy from the dead as a vera causa known to\nscience ;\u2014though to say that is by no means to abuse it.\nIn my own experience, some agency, some conscious intelligence, of\ndeparted persons was undoubtedly and strongly suggested ; but in very\nfew cases indeed was there any semblance of what might be called\n\u201cpossession.\u201d Possession was simulated or occurred ostensibly with\nMr. E. (Vol VI., pp. 517, 552, etc.); it occurred ostensibly again with\nDr. Edwin Thompson (op. cit., p. 544) probably, though I am not\nquite sure of that ; it was simulated once, for an instant only, by a\nrelation of my own ; but as a rule it was clear to me, or became clear\nbefore the end of the sittings, that Phinuit was reporting\u2014reporting\nin the \ufb01rst person and somewhat dramatically\u2014the information which\nhe acquired ; and this without any intent to deceive.\nI do not \ufb01nd \u201cpossession\u201d an easy idea to formulate to myself\nscienti\ufb01cally. I presume that it implies a more extended power than\ntelepathy, because telepathy may be supposed to act primarily on the\nmind, and secondarily on the brain, and so indirectly on other organs ;\nwhereas \u201cpossession \u201d may, I suppose, be de\ufb01ned as a psychical action\ndirect on matter,\u2014direct on the matter of the hand or the voice ; and\nmay be regarded therefore, as somewhat more of the nature of a\n\u201cphysical phenomenon.\u201d\nI do not propose to say more on Mrs. Sidgwick\u2019s paper now ; and I\nhave only said as Inuch as this in order to emphasise the fact that no\nidea of the distinction she draws was in my mind when replying to Mr,\nAndrew Lang; otherwise my form of expression (appearing after her\npaper) might tend to mislead.\nFurthermore, I wish to say that, though I have called the above\nletter a partial reply, it is in no sense intended to be a complete reply ;\nnor have I in the slightest degree touched upon any of those points\nand criticisms (the most numerous in Mr. Lang\u2019s critique) which\nconcern Dr. Hodgson, and on which in due time he will himself, no\ndoubt, have something to say.\n\fNo. CLXVIII.\u2014VoL.

Sidgwick occupied the chair. There were also present:\nDr. A. W. Barrett, the Hon. E. Feilding, Mr. F. Podmore, Mr. H.\nArthur Smith, Mr. J. G. Smith, and Dr. A. Wallace.\nThe Minutes of the last meeting were read and signed as correct.\nOne new Member and eight new Associates were elected. The\nelection of nineteen new Associates of the American Branch was\nrecorded. Names and addresses are given above.\nThe Council recorded with regret the decease of Mr. T. G. Bylands,\nwho had been a Member of the Society almost from its commencement,\nand also of Miss Jebb, an Associate of the Society.\nSome presents to the Library were reported, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donors.\nThe House and Finance Committee presented a report and an\nestimate of income and expenditure for the current year. This was\ndiscussed in connection with the best mode of bringing out the lengthy\nreport by Professor Hyslop of his sittings with Mrs. Piper, in regard\nto which letters were read from Mr. Myers, and from Miss Johnson, as\nEditor. A general scheme for the year was agreed to, some matters\nof arrangement being deferred for \ufb01nal decision.\nThe question of the desirability of an ampli\ufb01cation and combination\nof the existing Indexes of the Proceedings, Journal, and Phantasms of\nthe Living, which had previously received some attention, was fully\ndiscussed. It was thought that such an Index would be found\nvaluable by many Members of the Society, as well as by others,\nespecially in regard to the work of the Society in the future ; and it\nwas agreed that steps should be taken towards its preparation.\nSome other matters having been disposed of, the Council agreed\nthat its next meeting should be at the Town Hall, Westminster, at\n3 p.m., on Friday, April 6th.\n\fAPRIL, 1900.] General Jlleeting. 223\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 104th General Meeting of the Society was held in the West\nminster Town Hall on Friday, March 2nd, at 8.30 p.m., PR0FEssoR\nSIDGWICK in the chair.\nMIss M. H. MAsoN gave an account of two cases of the cure of\nwarts in children by suggestion. The boys who were her patients had\ncome under her notice in the course of her duties as Inspector of the\nBoarding-out system under the Local Government Board. [These\ncases will be found printed below.]\nMiss Mason said that she would be glad of opportunities of trying\nthe same treatment further, and invited those present to bring her\nsubjects for experiment, for which she would, if possible, arrange\ntimes at her rooms at 21, Queen\u2019s Mansions, Victoria Street, London,\nS.W. She also invited any of the audience who might have warts\nto come to her for the purpose of having them charmed at the close\nof the meeting. This invitation was accordingly accepted by a lady and\na gentleman present, and their warts were charmed by Miss Mason.\nSome extracts from a portion of PRoFEssoR J. H. HYsLoP\u2019s Report\nof his sittings with Mrs. Piper were then read by MR. F. PoDMoRE.\nThis portion of the Report (the whole of which is equivalent to about\n600 pp. of Proceedings) consisted of a general introduction and lengthy\nsummary of the statements made at all the sittings, with a complete\ndetailed record of everything that occurred at the \ufb01rst four sittings.\nThe remainder of the Report reached England too late for it to be\npossible to make any use of it for this meeting. The following is a\nbrief account of the extracts read :\u2014\nProfessor Hyslop prefaced his paper by a note explaining that\nhe was in no way responsible for the wide publicity given to his\ninvestigations in the American Press ; nor for the statement that he\nproposed to afford a scienti\ufb01c demonstration of immortality. He then\nde\ufb01ned his own attitude in the matter. The question of fraud, he\nthought, was de\ufb01nitely put out of court by the results of previous\ninvestigations, and he did not propose to consider it as a serious\npossibility until speci\ufb01c evidence of it was adduced, or the charge of\nfraud was put in a speci\ufb01c form. As regarded other possible explana\ntions, he regarded telepathy as quite inadequate, and held that the\ntheory of spirit communion was the only theory hitherto adduced which\nwould cover the facts. Mr. Hyslop then proceeded to describe minutely\nthe elaborate precautions taken to prevent Mrs. Piper in her normal\nstate from having any clue to his identity, and the general conditions\nunder which the experiments were conducted. Extracts were then\nread from his critical summary of the records of the sittings. A large\n\f224 Jo-urnal of Society for Psychical Research.

References were also quoted to the deceased\u2019s friends\nor relations, his personal effects, his habits, occupation, religious views,\nand characteristic phraseology. Other relations at times purported to\ncontrol Mrs. Piper\u2019s hand, and an extract was read, the communication\npurporting to proceed from the spirit of a uncle of Mr. Hyslop,\ncontaining many references subsequently veri\ufb01ed, to persons and\nevents unknown to the sitter.\nTHE CHAIRMAN observed that Dr. Hodgson attached great im\nportance to the report of this series of sittings, as it was a complete\nrecord of everything that transpired.\nAn animated discussion followed, which we do not report at length,\nsince the criticisms and replies to them could hardly be appreciated\nwithout reference to the complete record, which, it is hoped, will be\npublished soon.\nIn answer to a question as to whether Mrs. Piper\u2019s health was\naffected by her trances, it was replied that no unfavourable results had\nfollowed, and that her health had been decidedly better of late years\nthan it was formerly.\nIt was also asked whether she received payment for her sittings,\nto which the reply was that she was paid for them, but it was only fair\nto her to state that she could probably have earned much more if she\nhad not agreed to sit solely under Dr. Hodgson\u2019s arrangements, with\nsitters arranged for by him.\nTHE CHAIRMAN asked Mr. Podmore what impression had been\nproduced on his own mind by the part of Professor Hyslop\u2019s report,\nwhich he had read.\nMR. PonMoRs replied that he thought the evidence in some respects.\nnot very strong. Thus, of the names given at the \ufb01rst sitting, only 5\nout of 17 were identi\ufb01ed as correct; the principal control purported to\nbe Professor Hyslop\u2019s father, and Professor Hyslop thought the phrase-.\nology used and the mental attitude in general specially characteristic\nof his father ; but it appeared to him hardly de\ufb01nite or unusual\nenough to be so regarded. Professor Hyslop had become convinced of'\nthe spiritistic theory, and explained by it incidents which did not go.\nbeyond the explanation of telepathy from the sitter or other living\npersons ; and mistakes were explained away\u2014perhaps rather too freely\n_as due merely to the di\ufb02iculties of communication.

H. MAsoN.\nThe Journal for April, 1898, contained an account of a case which\nI cured by charming in the autumn of 1897. Since then I have been\nlooking out for other cases for experiment ; but warts do not seem to\nbe common, for I have found scarcely any since that date. I am\nafraid I may have seen one or two upon which I forgot to experiment\nat the time, and I no longer remember whose, or where they were.\nBut I have charmed only two since 1897, and both were again com\npletely successful. They were as follows :\nOn October 2nd, 1899, I found, at Stanford Rivers, in Essex, a\nboy named Thomas S., aged about ten, with a large wart about the\nsize of a threepenny bit on his right thumb. I was told that he had\nhad it six months, and that various methods had been tried for its\ncure. He told me himself that it had been rubbed with broad-bean\nshells and parsnip tops. I spoke to the schoolmaster about it, out of\nthe boy\u2019s hearing, and told him that I had no doubt I could cure it\nby suggestion, and I interested him in the matter. He promised to\nhelp, and to watch the case, and let me know if it was cured. I then\ncalled the boy back, and told him that I was going to charm his wart\naway in a manner which I thought would be to his own taste. I\nshowed him a sugar mouse, and putting it in a box in one of the\nschool cupboards, told him that I should leave it there till it had eaten\nup his wart in the dark, and that before that day three months he\nwould \ufb01nd the wart gone, and then he was to ask the schoolmaster\nfor the mouse and eat it up in its turn.\nOn January 18th I received this letter from the schoolmaster :\nStanford Rivers, Romford, Jrmmu-y 16th, 1900.\nDEAR MIss MAsoN, \u2014I am very pleased to inform you that T. S.\u2019s wart\nhas entirely disappeared.\nI am simply astounded\u2014it is very remarkable.\u2014Yours faithfully,\nH.

He answered as follows :\u2014\nStanford Rivers, Romford, Jcmuary 22nd, 1900.\nDEAR MIss MAsoN,\u2014T. S.\u2019s wart gradually disappeared, and \ufb01nally so\nabout a week before Christmas Day. On that morning,r I overtook Tommy\ngoing to church, when I asked him how the wart was getting on. He\nshowed me his hand, and there was no sign of the wart whatever. He\nalso gave me the information as already stated.\nTommy received the sugar mouse with a broad beam of satisfaction all\nover his face.\nI have much pleasure in sending you these particulars, as I am so\ninterested in the case.\u2014Believe me, Yours faithfully, H NEWMARCH\nThe gradual disappearance of this wart may have been due to my\ntelling the boy that the mouse would eat it up in the dark during the\nperiod mentioned.\nThree days afterwards, on October 5th, I found another boy named\nWilliam G., attending another school a few miles off. He also had a\nlarge wart, which was situated above the third \ufb01nger of his right\nhand. I told him in the presence of an old couple with whom he\nlived, and who fully believed in wart~charming, that I would charm it\naway for him before that day three months, and I asked the school\nmistress to let me know the result. She wrote as follows :\nPaslow Common Board School, November 13th, 1899.\nDEAR MIss MAsoN, \u2014I am very glad to tell you that your Charm had its\ndesired effect on Willie G. ; the wart has nearly disappeared. . . .\u2014\nYours obediently, F DoDD\nThen I wrote to ask her whether the wart had entirely disappeared,\nand, if so, when and how. She answered :\u2014\nPaslow Common Board School, Jan\/wary 20th, 1900.\nDEAR MIss MAsoN,\u2014I am only too pleased to answer a letter from you\nat any time, and to give you any information you may require.\nVery glad to tell you that Willie G. has improved, and that the wart has\nquite disappeared; how long cannot quite say, but some time. . . .\u2014\nYours obediently, F\u2018 DoDD.\nIn this case I must confess that I forgot to do anything by way of\ncharming, and the cure must have been effected merely by my assur<\nance of it,\u2014that is, by suggestion pure and simple. It seems to me\nthat the power of cure by suggestion, or faith healing, lies not merely\nin the faith of the subject but in that of the agent. \u2018I need not say\nthat I have no faith whatever in the charm itself; but experience has\n\fAPRIL, 1900.] Case.

Clairvoyance in a Dream.\nThe following case of apparent clairvoyance in a dream was kindly\nobtained for us by Mrs. E. Thompson, of 87, South Hill Park, Hamp\nstead, London, N.W., an Associate of the Society. The account was\nwritten by Mrs. Thompson, from the description given her by the\npercipient, Mrs. Hodgson, who afterwards corrected and signed it.\nJune 12th, 1899.\nThe following account of a dream seems worth recording. It was told\nme by a lady on Sunday last (June 11th). whom I met at the house of a\nmutual friend.\nIn September, 1897, Mrs. H., of Shepherd\u2019s Bush, left her house during\nthe afternoon for a few hours unattended, and unfortunately whilst she was\naway burglars entered and ransacked the place, taking all portable valuables.\nOne of the articles missing and supposed to have been stolen was a small\npapier-mach\u00e9 box containing trinkets of more or less value. The box,\nhowever, was much valued, having been in Mrs. H.\u2019s possession for many\nyears, and [she] was naturally vexed at the loss.\nAbout one week after the burglary, Mrs. H. dreamed she went into the\ncoal cellar and found hidden amongst the \ufb01ne coal the very box supposed to\nhave been taken by the thieves.\nMrs. H. spoke to her daughter (the next morning) of her dream, and she\nlaughed and scouted the idea of a box of trinkets in the coal cellar. There\nfore they did not make a search, but let the whole matter of the dream slip\ntheir memory for a time. She herself felt it was there.\nIn the following August, 1898, Mr. Hodgson went into the cellar to see\nhow much coal there happened to be, when, to Mrs. H.\u2019s surprise, he came\nto her with the box wrapped up in a newspaper, which was of the date of the\nburglary, viz. : September 30th, 1897. He had found it amongst the \ufb01ne coal.\nMrs. H. kept this paper for some time, but has not it in her possession now.\nAf\ufb01xed hereto are the signatures of Mrs. and Miss H.\n(signed) 0.

[Amun,1900.\nMRS. PIPER AND TELEPATHY.\nBY ANDREW LANG.\nReplies to replies are weary things, but I must thank Mr. Lodge\nfor the courtesy of his remarks on my remarks on Dr. Hodgson\u2019s\nstudies of Mrs. Piper. There cannot be any essential diversity of\nopinion between Mr. Lodge and myself, as, apparently, neither of us\nhas any theory as to the nature of Mrs. Piper\u2019s phenomena.\n(1) I admit that Professor Macalister, with the blot on his \ufb01nger,\nhad a bad \u201csitting ; \u201d but I would draw no inference from a number\nof bad sittings, except that, if success depends, in any degree, on \u201c a\nthorough trance,\u201d Mrs. Piper should not give sittings when she is not\nin a trance that is thorough. It does appear to me that, as a rule,\nshe fails most with the kind of people whose a\ufb02irmative evidence\nwould be most valuable. But for this (if this be so), there may be\nmany different reasons. Nothing would surprise me less than the\noccurrence of \u201cdim and unsatisfactory visions\u201d on the part of any\ncrystal-gazer; if a certain percentage of them occurred, one might\nbegin to feel that chance-coincidence perhaps provided the clear and\nsatisfactory visions, which would be mere fancy pictures. Indeed,\nI always keep this and other normal causes of success before my\nmind. I do think that failures, in all cases, ought to be \u201cseriously\ntaken into consideration.\u201d\n(2) False information from G. P. does not seem to me to be on the\nsame footing as false news in the papers. If the distinction is not\nobvious, I shall not dwell on the matter.\n(3) As to Phinuit, I do think he has all the usual evil notes of a\n\u201csecondary personality ;\u201d but as Mr. Lodge entertains \u201ca friendly\nfeeling\u201d for a secondary personality whom I have never met, I refer\nhim to the opinion of Mrs. Sidgwick.\n(4) My bias, my hostile bias, as to paid mediums, I have frankly\nconfessed. Most of us have a bias, and it is candid to state onc\u2019s\nown. Surely I must know something about the characters and tastes\nof my own deceased friends. If they \u201ccommunicate\u201d through Mrs.\nPiper, then either their tastes have altered, or the communicators are\nnot what they profess to be. I have a right to abstain from trying to\nbring my friends acquainted (were it possible) with whatever it is\nthat, to my mind, pretends to be what it is not. I cannot be more\n\u201cserious\u201d than I am on this topic.\n(5) The affair of \u201cUncle Jerry \u201d must be studied in the original\nrecords. In my opinion \u201c Version A.\u201d (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VI.,\np. 503) is utterly and irreconcilably different from \u201cVersion B.\u201d (ibid.,\n\fArms 1900.] Mrs. Piper and Telepathy. 229\np. 526). According to Version B. nobody was \u201ctipped over\u201d from a\nboat, and nobody \u201cpretty nigh got drowned,\u201d as in Version A. Most\nboys, alas, have killed cats, or been present at a cat-killing ; many\nboys have been \u201ctipped over\u201d in boats; of all names of \ufb01elds,\n\u201cSmith\u2019s \ufb01eld\u201d is not the least common. The snake-skin I have\nadmitted as good ; and if the runaway boy was named Rodney, that\nis good also. I don\u2019t pretend to explain these facts, unless there is\nsuch a thing as t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie 11 trois.\n(6) As to Miss Angus\u2019s successes, or some of them, I do not think\nthat they prove this t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie it trois : I only mean that, of other than\nnormal explanations, I incline to think that the most easily thinkable.\nWhy we should suppose that the agency of the dead may be concerned\nin them, I cannot conceive. Of course I cannot know that the dead\nwere not concerned ; but I cannot imagine why we should even glance\nat that animistic hypothesis in such cases. All the people who seemed\nto be seen in the glass, and all the people present who were interested\nin them were alive, unless, indeed, on one occasion, the picture of\nMariotte Ogilvy (about 1546) was really seen. A lady about her age,\nand in the dress of her period, was viewed in the glass, but I was\npresent; Mariotte had been present to my mind, and, for all that I\nknow, Mariotte may have somehow exuded thence. Or the crystal\ngazer may once have known but forgotten that unlucky heroine: or\nthe view of a lady of about 1546 may have been fortuitous.\n(7) I do think, as Mr. Lodge puts the question, that \u201cover\nstretched telepathy from the living\u201d is the most easily thinkable\nnon-normal explanation of these cases, but there may be an unguessed\nat normal explanation, or, as Mr. Lodge says, there may be \u201ca\npsychological modi\ufb01cation of our usually conceived ideas of space and\ntime.\u201d Perhaps, after all, that is the least diliicult hypothesis, and\nprobably the best attitude is the philosopher\u2019s who said, hypotheses non\n\ufb01ngo. By the way, Mr. Huxley\u2019s tale of \u201cthe lucidity of the soldier\nwhose-skull-had-been-fractured-by-a-bullet\u201d is really deserving of study\nby the learned in these matters. As Mr. Huxley accepted the facts,\nthey must, I suppose, have been given on adequate evidence, which he\nadduced. But the \u201clucidity\u201d (which was limited) did not, apparently,\ninterest Mr. Huxley. He remarked on the resemblance to cases of\nhypnotic patients, but seemed to regard all of them as highly\nsuspicious characters. The soldier he did not suspect. The soldier\ndid (he seems to have thought) what the hypnotic patients only\npretend to do, or may be suspected of pretending to do. The interest\ning coincidence between the facts in the soldier\u2019s case, and the fraud\nin the hypnotic cases, was not dwelt on by Mr. Huxley : who noticed\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychrlcal Research. [APiuL,1900.\nit brie\ufb02y in passing. One question, after all, I may ask Mr. Lodge.\nDoes he believe that Phinuit is a deceased physician of French birth?\nIf he does not believe this, and if Phinuit positively asserts this, how\ncan Mr. Lodge deny that Phinuit mentitur impudentissime? It was, I\nthink, Professor Shaler who called Phinuit \u201ca preposterous scoundrel.\u201d\nIf Phinuit were a living person for whom Mr. Lodge confessed a\nfriendly feeling, of course I would sedulously avoid the mention of\nPhinuit. But we are agreed that Phinuit is not a living person.\n[Note--The case described by Huxley,* to which Mr. Lang refers,\nis a striking instance of duplex or alternating personalities. It was\nobserved by Dr. E. Mesnet and published by him under the title,\n\u201cDe l\u2019Automatisme de la M\u00e9moire, etc.,\u201d in L\u2019Um'on M\u00e9dicale, July\n21st and 23rd, 1874. A brief summary of it was given in Mr. Myers\u2019\npaper on \u201cAutomatic Writing\u201d (Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. IV., p.\n234); but as this appeared thirteen years ago, our readers may be\nglad to be reminded of the main features of the case. The soldier\n\u2014F.\u2014after a gun-shot wound in the head at Sedan, became subject\nduring the next four years to periodical attacks of a kind of somnam\nbulism, during which he was entirely insensible to pain, could hear,\ntaste and smell nothing, and could hardly see at all, except when the\nsense of touch called his attention to objects, which he could then,\nit appeared, see distinctly. His condition during these attacks is\ncompared by Huxley to that of a frog deprived of its cerebral\nhemispheres, which retains all its ordinary powers of movement,\nbut will only use them when urged by external stimuli; and which,\nthough it appears to be blind, will\u2014if it is made to move\u2014avoid\nobstacles, thus showing that it is really affected in some way by\nvisual sensations. Similarly, the soldier in his secondary condition\nappeared to be brought into relation with the external world almost\nexclusively through the sense of touch. Sitting at a table in one\nof his abnormal states, he took up a pen, felt for paper and ink,\nand began to write a letter to his general, recommending himself for\na medal on account of his good conduct and courage. To test how\nfar vision was concerned in this act, Dr. Mesnet repeatedly placed\na sheet of iron between the man\u2019s eyes and his hand ; he continued to\nwrite a few lines illegibly and then ceased, but without showing any\ndiscontent. When the obstacle was removed, he began to write again\nwhere he left off. The ink in his inkstand was then replaced by\n* In an essay, \u201c On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History\u201d\n\u2014(Fortnightly Review, 1874), reprinted in Science and Culture, and other Essays ([881),\npp. 223-231.\n\fAPRIL, 1900.] Note. 231\nwater. He perceived the faintness of the letters traced, wiped his\npen again and again, but never looked at the ink-bottle._ His \ufb01eld\nof vision, it seemed, was awakened by touch alone, and was limited\nto objects with which he was actually in contact.\nOn one occasion he was writing on a sheet of paper which lay on a\npile of about ten similar sheets. The top sheet was drawn away and his\npen continued to write in the same place on the second sheet. When\nhe had written about ten words on the second sheet, this also was\nsnatched away, and he continued his phrase at the corresponding point\non the third sheet. This process was repeated and on the \ufb01fth sheet\nthere was nothing but his signature at the bottom. Nevertheless, he\nread over and corrected his letter on this blank \ufb01fth sheet, scattering\nstops and corrections over the empty page, each of which corresponded\nto mistakes made on the corresponding points of the pages which had\nbeen snatched away from him.\nIt will be seen that there was nothing here which could properly\nbe called \u201c lucidity,\u201d since no knowledge was shown of anything that\nF. had not been normally aware of. He merely saw on the \ufb01fth sheet\na hallucinatory \u201cafter-image\u201d of the letter he had just written. It\nwas remarkable that this represented the real letter so accurately,\nshowing how exact was his memory of it. But the heightening of the\nfaculty of memory is one of the commonest characteristics of the\nautomatic condition.\nAn incident curiously similar to this is recorded by Professor Janet\nin the Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. VIII., p. 483. He says :\u2014\u201c One day\na young female patient had an attack of somnambulism, during which\nshe had written a letter which she had afterwards torn up, and the\ncontents of which she had forgotten. By causing her to gaze upon a\nshining surface, [I] succeeded in making her read by hallucination the\nwhole of that letter.\u201d\nHuxley observes of F.\u2019s case :\u2014\u201cThose who have had occasion to\nbecome acquainted with the phenomena of somnambulism and of\nmesmerism will be struck with the close parallel which they present to\nthe proceedings of F. in his abnormal state. But the great value of Dr.\nMesnet\u2019s observations lies in the fact that the abnormal condition is\ntraceable to a de\ufb01nite injury to the brain, and that the circumstances\nare such as to keep us clear of the cloud of voluntary and involuntary\n\ufb01ctions in which the truth is too often smothered in such cases.\u201d\nIt should be remembered that this remark was made in 1874, at a\ntime when the modern science of Hypnotism was practically in its\ninfancy, and when a scienti\ufb01c man, even of Huxley\u2019s eminence, might\nbe excused for speaking of it with scanty respect.\u2014ED.]\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychicat Research. [APRIL,1900.\nFURTHER DISCUSSION OF A CASE OF SUPPOSED\n\u201c SPIRIT-PHOTOGRAPHY.\u201d\n(Continued from the February \u201cJournal,\u201d 10. 194.)\n. BY D. B. MCLACHLAN.\nI am permitted to reply to the remarks evoked by the view I\nventured to express with reference to this photograph.\nThe question is simply whether a certain photograph can be repro\nduccd in its essential parts by ordinary means. If those who assert\nthat it can will take the trouble to do it, the matter is settled.\nThis summary and conclusive treatment does not recommend itself\nto -the scienti\ufb01c critics. They are fertile in theories, but slack in\ntesting their speculations. Mr. T. E. Espin has great faith in some\n\u201c visual\u201d experiments which consist in turning the photograph upside\ndown for the better understanding of it. His explanation is totally\ndifferent from that of Professor Barrett, who at least made one\nphotographic experiment.\nIn default of actual trial we might reasonably expect that the\nhypothetical experiments should be worked out on paper to enable us\nto judge of the supposed effects, but this also is denied us. Professor\nBarrett and Miss Johnson con\ufb01ne themselves to generalities that may\nseem plausible to one unacquainted with practical photography, but\nwhich are found to be impossible of realisation when reduced to terms\nof space and time. If the following remarks appear long and tedious\nthe reason is that I have been obliged to work out the physical\ntheories myself to show their weakness.\n1. Professor Barrett (p. 189) claims to have \u201ccarefully weighed all\nthe evidence,\u201d but admits that his experiment was directed to elucidate\none feature of it only-\u2014-the absence of both legs and an arm of the\nGhost. The experiment is manifestly inadequate to explain the whole\nGhost. Stationary and well-lighted parts of the body are absent as\nwell as the mobile parts. Especially do we want to know why the\nfigure has no vestige of an ear, though the whole side of the head is\nturned to the spectator and is well lighted ; and why there is no mouth,\nnose or \ufb01ngers worth mentioning. These details are an essential part\nof the evidence.\nLet us consider how Professor Barrett deals with the single point\nwhich he undertakes to explain. Having conceived that the frag\nmentariness of the \ufb01gure is due to movements of human limbs, he\nchose for his photograph such a length of exposure as accorded with\nthis conception. He says that the \ufb01gure could be taken in 20 to 30\nseconds, so we may infer that the whole exposure lasted a minute\n\fApmr, 1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photography.\" 233\nor less. But the whole exposure of the D. photograph lasted an hour.\nIf Professor Barrett was aware of this, will he kindly tell us why he\noffers a photograph of a minute\u2019s duration to explain another that\noccupied sixty minutes? Perhaps his photograph is made to scale\nand is meant to be interpreted proportionally. If so, then since the\n\ufb01gure in the experimental photograph occupied half or two-thirds of\nthe total exposure, we conclude that the D. \ufb01gure occupied half or two\nthirds of an hour in the taking. But this is inconsistent with the\noriginal idea that the limbs of the man were kept out of the photo\ngraph by being in motion all the time. The most agile of footmen\ncould not toss his arm and legs about incessantly\u2014not to speak of\nwagging his ear\u2014for 30 or 40.minutes. I am afraid this point of the\ncase is not yet explained.\nIfancy also that Professor Barrett is alone in believing that the\nD. \ufb01gure is that of a footman, and a young one too. Who ever saw\na footman of any age with a cranium so lofty and reverend, so denuded\nof hair?\n2. It has not been shown that the transparent chair could have\nbeen moved to its place during the exposure. It has doublings like\nthose of other objects and equally well-de\ufb01ned, which proves that it\nwas on the spot during the whole of the short exposure. It was also\nthere during the whole of the long exposure, as Dr. Kingston points\nout. But the short and long exposures together account for the\nwhole hour. There is no possible third period during which the room\nwas being photographed without the chair.\nI cannot agree with Miss Johnson that the seat of the chair con\nceals a dark background. The shadow to which she refers is partial\nand thin. The front and side of the chair are dense black, that is,\nthey made no impression at all on the silver of the plate, and the carpet\nwould certainly have occupied that space if it had had a chance.\nThose who practise photography even as an amusement quickly\nlearn to notice the disposition of a scene in order to judge of the\npictorial e\ufb02'ect. In focussing also one has to observe the picture very\nclosely. For these reasons it is incredible that Miss Corbet should\nnot have detected a disturbance in the order of the furniture when\nshe returned to the room. Besides, the chair is in its customary place.\nIt is evidently the one used by those who write at the round table.\nThere are writing materials on the side next to it. The last person\nwho used the chair turned it round a little in leaving the table.\nWith regard to this chair we have to choose between abnormal\ntransparency and abnormal opacity. Why, asks Miss Johnson, should\nwe ascribe the transparency to spiritual agency and not the opacity ?.\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [APRIL,1900.\nThat is hardly the issue. I have nowhere ascribed the transparency\nto the deliberate action of spirits ; I have merely pointed out that a\nsimilar transparency occurs in photographs accepted in certain\nquarters as spiritual. The association may be a mere accident\u2014and\nthen again it mayn\u2019t, as Miss Kingsley\u2019s West African skipper used to\nsay. It is just these little anomalies that set us on the track of\nhigher knowledge. They should be welcomed and studied, not denied\nor ignored. Anyhow, in the Riintgen photography we have precedents\nfor a transparency that a few years ago would have been considered\nabnormal and impossible, while we have no experience as yet of\nabnormal opaqueness such as appears in the chair if it were moved\ninto place. The transparency is therefore the easier to accept of the\ntwo alternatives.\n3. The discovery that the room has three doors does not bene\ufb01t\nthe physical theory. It facilitates the entrance of the man into the\nroom, but destroys one of the reasons for his existence\u2014the necessity\nof accounting for the camera-displacement. We cannot suppose he\nentered at one door and then walked up to, and disturbed, a camera\nstanding in another doorway and a little back. It is impossible that\nhe made the tour of the room outside and touched the camera behind\nafter being in the room, for the Ghost does not show doublings\ndue to the displacement of the camera. If he had been photographed\nbefore the camera was moved his image would be doubled.\n4. Miss Johnson supposes (pp. 180, 183) that the chair may have\nbeen moved into position soon after the exposure began, and she is\npretty sure (p. 181) that the exposure which followed the camera\nmovement was the short one. The short exposure came last. But\nthe chair was in place during the whole of the long exposure (Dr.\nKingston). What then was the man doing between the time when\nhe moved the chair and the time when he moved the camera\u2014an\ninterval of about an hour?\nMiss Johnson provides an avenue of escape (p. 183): \u201cperhaps\u201d\nthe same person moved both chair and camera\u2014perhaps only. But on\nthe other hand she is sure it was not Miss Corbet who moved the\ncamera (p. 181). But if not Miss Corbet, it was the man\u2014the same\nman who moved the chair about an hour before. We cannot possibly\nadmit a second hypothetical person into this suliiciently complicated\nbusiness. Therefore I repeat : What was the man doing in the room\nall that time?\nMiss Johnson has still a third line of entrenchment. Perhaps after\nall (p. 180) the chair was there from the beginning and was moved\naway before the end of the exposure, leaving time for the images to be\n\fAPRIL, 1900.] Discussion of Supposed \u201cSpirit-Photography.\u201d 235\nformed that now show through it. The order of events would be:\ntilting camera\u2014moving chair away\u2014photographing man\u2014closure.\nTo this I object that it is not the proceeding of a man who is\nacting in a \ufb01t of abstraction. It is juggling or insanity. In the\nsecond place, there is no time for all the events. VVe cannot allow\nmore than ten seconds for the short exposure, since the only things\nthat impressed the plate are \ufb02aring glass and polished surfaces that\nre\ufb02ected straight into the lens. Ten seconds are, I judge, ample time\nfor that with an \u201cordinary \u201d plate closely stopped down. But from\nthe time of tilting the camera to the time of moving the chair away\nwe must allow the whole ten seconds, since the doublings of the chair\nare of the same nature and strength as those of the other parts of the\nroom. There remains no time for photographing the images that show\nthrough the chair and which (ex were formed after the chair was\nmoved away; and no time for photographing the man, which must\nhave followed the moving of the chair, but may have been concurrent\nwith the impression of the transparent images.\nLet us throw back the camera-movement to any desired distance\nand we meet with similar di\ufb02iculties. Say it took place ten minutes\nbefore the closure, and divide the time equally between the secondary\nimages of the chair and the transparent images that followed its\nremoval. This also will not answer, since it gives twice as long for the\nsecondary images of the room as for those of the chair, and if the\nlatter occupied \ufb01ve minutes, the transparent images (which are much\nstronger) occupied twenty minutes or more. If we give one minute\nto the chair doublings and nine to the transparent images, we have\nthe secondary images of the room ten times as long as those of the\nchair, which is absurd.\nBy placing the events at the beginning of the exposure we at least\nhave time for the man to be photographed and to get away after the\nlong exposure began. But all the rest is impossible. The camera must\nhave been tilted ten seconds after the lens was uncapped. Prior to\nthat the chair was moved out and formed 'its secondary image. Still\nearlier there was a longer period with no chair in view when the images\nwere formed that show through the chair. Thus we get back to a\npoint coinciding with, or earlier, if such a thing were possible, than the\nuncapping of the lens.

Hall and \ufb01nd it to be one\nof the great English country mansions. It is surrounded by its own\ngrounds and its privacy is no doubt guarded in the usual way. We\nknow of three in-door men-servants and there would probably be\ntwice that number of women-servants, or more. Outside there would\nbe gardeners, stablemen and lodge-keepers. Add to these the members\nof the family and we have a household of \ufb01fteen to twenty persons.\nI mention these details in view of the suggestion thrown out that a\nvisitor may have strayed into the house in a \ufb01t of absent-minded\nness, without announcing himself by bell or knocker and without\nbeing seen by any one. We can as easily imagine him wandering into\nand out of Buckingham Palace without being challenged. The absent\nminded visitor is as dif\ufb01cult to accept as the apostolic footman.\nThere is a fact mentioned in the history of D. Hall that is not\nwithout interest to our inquiry. The house occupies the site of what\nfor centuries was an abbey. The library where the Ghost appeared\nwas part of the abbey refectory and is said to be the only portion of\nthe old building left. It is thus a likely place for spiritual manifesta\ntions to occur.\nProfessor Barrett has \u201c not the least doubt that a few trials would\nenable any one to reproduce a \ufb01gure the facsimile of that in the arm\nchair in Miss Corbet\u2019s photograph.\u201d In the interests of psychical\nresearch it is to be hoped that Professor Barrett will make these few\ntrials. The D. photograph has so many points in common with what\nare called spirit-photographs that a natural explanation of this one\nwill account for most of the others. But in any photographic\nreproduction we must have the unexplained accessories as well. They\nare perhaps not so important as the main \ufb01gure, but unless the whole\nis done in such a manner as to include them as a by\u2014product we have\nno guarantee that the process is the same as that of the D. photograph.\nWe cannot be satis\ufb01ed with a mere colourable imitation. Should it\nbe found impossible to reproduce the photograph satisfactorily, that\nresult also will be instructive in another way.\nWimbledon, February 13th, 1900.\nEDMUND GURNEY LIBRARY FUND.\nAccount for 1899.\nRECEIvED.

Alexander, of Rio de Janeiro, sends us the following\naccount of a hypnotic cure recently effected by a friend of his, Dr.\nAlfredo Barcellos, who resides at Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro, where he\nhas a large practice. An article in the Journals for June and July,\n1897 (Vol. VIII., p. 88 and p. 99) by Professor Alexander describes\nsome supernormal phenomena observed during hypnotic treatment by\nDr. Barcellos. Dr. Barcellos has used hypnotism in his medical practice\nsince 1888, when he \ufb01rst experienced the bene\ufb01t of it in his own\nperson. While he attributes the phenomena of hypnotism generally\nto suggestion, it is interesting to \ufb01nd that both his own experience\nand his observation of his patients have led him independently\n\fMAY, 1900.] The Cure of Paralysis by Hypnotism. 239\nto the views maintained by Dr. Bramwell, that a hypnotised\nperson retains his powers of discrimination and choice, and that\nsuggestions will not take effect if they are really opposed to the\nsubject\u2019s will. In the article above referred to, several instances are\ngiven of impressions produced at a distance by him on his patients (in\nwhich cases, however, something must be allowed for the possible effect\nof expectancy) and also instances of telepathic clairvoyance and\npremonitions experienced by them. An earlier communication of Pro\nfessor Alexander\u2019s, printed in the Journal for July, 1893 (Vol. VI.,\np. 112) gives a case of thought-transference obtained through table\ntilting, in which Dr. Barcellos was one of the principal experimenters\nand witnesses.\nProfessor Alexander states, however, that Dr. Barcellos\u2019 object\nhas always been the cure of disease, rather than experimentation or\nthe observation of supernormal phenomena, and the case now to be\ngiven is simply an instance of this. The account was contained in a\nletter written by Professor Alexander to Mr. Myers, dated January\n21st, 1899, and endorsed by Dr. Barcellos, who has himself since\npublished an account of the same case in a Brazilian journal called\nthe Revisla da Socieolacle do rlledicina e Cirurgia.\nBarcellos has lately obtained a splendid hypnotic triumph, which is\ncertainly worthy of mention. He has not yet sent his own account of it to\nthe Rio Medical Society, so that I must copy my note of the occurrence of\n14th September, 1898.\nBarcellos had long promised Sister Euphrasia, the directress of the\nOrphan Asylum at Botafogo, that he would call at the Misericordia\nHospital in town and visit a sick girl who belonged to her establishment.\nEulina,* for that was, I believe, her name, had suffered for two years from\ngeneral paralysis, which, having come on gradually, was attributed by the\ndoctors in attendance to some affection of the spine. The ordinary means of\ntreatment had failed (strychnine, iodides, massage, electricity, etc.) On the\n6th September, 1898, as Barcellos was riding into town in the street car, the\nidea of the girl \ufb02ashed into his mind in such a manner that, in view of\nsubseqhent events, he was disposed to regard it as a telepathic impact.\nAlthough the hour was an unusually late one (4 p.m.) for a visit to the\nhospital, he went and was conducted by a sister of charity to the ward where\nthe patient lay. \u201c Si vous la gu\u00e9rissez,\u201d said the sister, \u201c nous croirons au\nmiracle.\u201d Eulina was not personally known to him, but a \ufb02ash of pleased\nsurprise passed over her face as the doctor entered the door, and he himself\nrecognised the patient he had come to see before the sister had time to point\nher out. Seating himself on the side of the bed, he at once sought to bring\nher under hypnotic in\ufb02uence. Soon her eyelids began to tremble and she\nfell easily into the hypnotic slumber. The doctor then suggested that on\n* This is the right name. I have shown this letter to Barcellos.\u2014A.A.\n\f240 Jo-wrnal of Society for Psyclrical Reseun-ch. [MAY, 1900.\nthe 8th of that month (Nativity of Our Lady) the girl should rise and walk.\nThis suggestion she received with the greatest readiness, so that on retiring\nBarcellos expressed himself hopeful of her recovery. Sister Euphrasia\nafterwards informed him to his surprise that Eulina had herself a\ufb02irmed that\nshe would rise from her bed on that very date. The next day Barcellos\nagain threw the patient into the hypnotic sleep, and with the emphasis of\nhis own sanguine expectation repeated the same suggestions. He made a\nmistake in not going early to the hospital on the morning of the 8th. The\npatient asked for her clothes; she wished to rise and go to mass in the\nchapel; but her unaided efforts were unequal to the task of standing, or\neven of sitting, in an upright posture. She fell to the ground, and was\nobliged to renounce the attempt. It was only about two p.m. that Barcellos\narrived, and was informed of what had occurred. He at once hypnotised\nEulina, insisted on her carrying out the suggestion, and ordered her to\nsit up in the bed. She obeyed with dif\ufb01culty, Barcellos then noticing that\neven the muscles of the trunk were unable adequately to perform their\no\ufb02ice. The sister present was requested to draw the girl\u2019s legs out of bed,\nand the doctor ordered the latter to stand up. Again she fell to the \ufb02oor,\nand it was only when supported on either side by the sister and Dr.\nBarcellos that she was at last able to maintain an erect posture. Then she\nwas encouraged to walk, the doctor tapping the leg which had to be lifted,\nand directing her attention to it by words. After this preliminary exercise\nand an intervening rest, it was found that she could walk while grasping the\ndoctor\u2019s hand. Her evident desire was to direct her steps towards an\nimage of the Virgin. Barcellos perceived this, and led her thither,\nallowing her to go quite alone when she was near the object of her\npilgrimagc.* She stopped erect before the image, and her lips moved in\nprayer. At this moment Barcellos opened her eyes, and being, perhaps,\nthus called back to a clearer consciousness of her surroundings and of the\nwonder of her cure, a look of ecstacy illuminated her countenance. The\ndoctor left after suggesting that she should rise from her bed every hour and\nsip a glass of water left purposely on a table placed at some distance away.\nOr this suggestion may have been given on one of the succeeding days. I am\nnot sure on this point.i' It is a fact, however, that the girl has rapidly\nrecovered the free use of her limbs, and is now radically cured.\nIn addressing the medical students, who \ufb02ocked into the ward on the 9th\nof September to verify the cure and witness the repetition of the suggestive\ntreatment above described, Barcellos urged the importance of hypnosis as a\n\u201c therapeutic agent,\u201d which ought not to be abandoned to the quacks and\npopular healers. He said truly that it was a-shame to medical science that\nthe patient should have been left bedridden for two long years, while the\nmeans of cure lay so close at hand. His remarks were timely, and con\ntained a rebuke to certain professors of the RioSchool of Medicine who\n\u2018 She was led to the image by Barcellos.

But Dr. Barcellos with his strong convictions produces\neffects which more hesitating operators might fail to obtain. I also hold\nthat his warm and charitable instincts and his sympathy with the religious\nnature of such patients as Eulina are forces which attract the 'entire\ncon\ufb01dence of the sujet, and start the most powerful kind of auto\nsuggestion.\nALFRED ALEXANDER.\nCASES.\nG. 265. Apparition.\nThe following is a case of a recognised apparition of a deceased\nperson reported to have seen independently at about the same time by\ntwo of her relatives. The account of one of the percipients was sent\nto us in 1891 by Mrs. Briggs, of Rawdon Hall, near Leeds, (formerly\nan Associate of the Society) in connection with the Census of Halluci\nnations, for which Mrs. Briggs was collecting answers.\nThis gentleman, whom we will call Mr. F., as he desires us not to\npublish his name, wrote as follows :\nOctober 10th, 1891.\n. . . My mother-in-law, Mrs. P., died in 1864. Mr. P., who died\nin 1882, lived at , Essex, and for some years before he died spent\nChristmas regularly with his daughter, my wife, at \u2014, where we now\nreside.\nI neither drink nor smoke; nevertheless, I always go to bed late and last.\nAt the top of the \ufb01rst \ufb02ight of stairs a small side staircase leads to the room\nwhich Mr. P. always occupied when staying with us, and which he occupied\non the night in question.\nIn the Christmas week of 188i, as I approached the top of this \ufb01rst\n\ufb02ight of stairs to go to bed, I saw Mrs. P. walking up the side staircase. I\nstopped at the top of the \ufb01rst \ufb02ight of stairs to let the candle burn steadier,\nand when Mrs. P. reached the last step of the side staircase she vanished at\nthe door. There was no mistaking her \ufb01gure and left side face as she\nwalked in advance of me, and so natural was it that for a second I expected\nto hear her turn the door-handle. I had no thought of alarm and as the\nremembrance that she had died years ago came upon me, I mused as I\nre\ufb02ected that Mr. P. was asleep within the room. Mr. P. died in the\nfollowing July.\n(Signed in full) -\u2014 -\u2014\nMrs. Briggs was not then aware that the apparition had been seen\nby any one else ; but some years later, she happened to mention Mr.\nF.\u2019s experience to one of his daughters (whom we will call Mrs. D.),\nan old friend of one of her own daughters. Mrs. D. expressed great\nsurprise at hearing it and told Mrs. Briggs that she herself had had\n\f242 Journal of Society for Peychical Research. [MAY, 1900.\nan exactly similar experience, which she had never mentioned to any\nof her family. Mrs. Briggs communicated this information to us in a\nletter dated November 2nd, 1898, saying :\u2014\nWhen I mentioned [her fa-thcr\u2019s experience to Mrs. D.] a day or\ntwo ago, she was quite surprised and would scarcely believe me. She then\ntold me she had seen the same \ufb01gure, under the same circumstances, but\nnearly a year previously. She never told any one in the family\u2014in fact,\ndid not mention it at all, being afraid it would make her sisters nervous.\nIf you have . . . papers sent in at that time and could \ufb01nd those\ncontributed by myself . . . I would feel greatly obliged to be allowed\nto forward them, to satisfy my friend that her father actually \ufb01lled up a\npaper with an account of the same apparition she herself saw, and never\nmentioned, about a year previously\nIn answer to this letter, Mr. F.\u2019s original narrative was sent to\nMrs. Briggs, with the request that she would ask Mrs. D. to write her\naccount before looking at her father\u2019s. Mrs. D. then wrote :\u2014\nNovember 9th, 1898.\nMrs. Briggs sent on to me the original letter of my father which I now\nreturn, and I wish to thank you for sending it. Your note was also sent to\nme to read, so I of course wrote my account of what I had seen before I\nopened the letter written by my father. I was very surprised when I opened\nhis letter to see it was practically the same that I had seen, even to time and\nplace, but he does not mention Christmas eve, which I am sure of, as I had\nbeen up much later than usual arranging presents and decorations for\nChristmas. Until I opened his letter, or rather, heard from Mrs. Briggs\nthat he had seen the apparition of my grandmother (and she thought it was\nat the deathbed of grandfather he saw it), I had no idea my father had ever\nseen any spirit and I had never mentioned what I had seen to any of my\nsisters, brothers, or parents.\nMrs. D. enclosed the following account of her experience :\u2014\nNocember 9th, 1898.\nMy grandfather, Mr. P., during the last years of his life, used to spend\nChristmas Day and a day or two following and preceding it, at my father\u2019s\nhouse, I distinctly remember one Christmas Eve\u2014the last he spent\nwith us-\u2014wa1king up to bed, and, as I was doing so, I noticed how late it\nwas by the clock striking twelve. As I got to the \ufb01rst small landing (where\nthe gas was burning brightly) I chanced to look to the left where a small\nstaircase of about six stairs led to the spare room (only) occupied by my\ngrandfather, who had retired to rest some hours previously. The stairs I\nwas going by were to the right of the tiny landing, but while looking\ntowards my grandfather\u2019s room I distinctly saw an old lady, of rather short\nstature, dressed in black silk, with a something white round her neck,\nwalking slowly up the stairs. She seemed to be holding her dress up\nslightly, and slightly bent forward. She was so real that I was not shocked,\nbut noticed a great and striking resemblance to the photograph of an old\n\fMAY, 1900.] Cases. 243\nlady in our album, whom I recalled as being that of my grandmother\u2014Mr.\nP.\u2019s wife \u2014who had died when I was a baby. I was astonished to see her\nsuddenly disappear as she got to the top step, and without opening the door.\nI think I had seen her walk up about three steps altogether. Though I\nslept alone I did not feel frightened, but wondered over it very much, and\nof all my past life at that time I always recall this fact vividly and with awe,\nand it seems to stand out from amongst all other events at that time which\nI do not often or clearly recall now.\nI never mentioned this to any of my sisters, brothers or parents,\u2014nor,\ntill I met Mrs. Briggs on the 31st of last month, had I heard that one of\nthe family had seen anything of the sort.\nFurther enquiries made of Mr. F., however, disclosed an apparent\ndiscrepancy between his recollections of the circumstances and Mrs.\nD.\u2019s, as he stated that he had told his family at the time of his seeing\nthe apparition and it was, he believed, owing to dne of his daughters\nrelating to Mrs. Briggs what she had heard from him that Mrs. Briggs\nwrote to him and obtained his account. Now, if his family really\nknew of it at the time, it would seem probable that Mrs. D., among\nthe rest, had heard of it. Her own statement shows that, if she had\never heard of it, she has completely forgotten it since. But in that\ncase, her experience would not at the time have been independent of\nher father\u2019s, and would consequently be of much less evidential value.\nIt seems even not impossible that she might have heard of his experi\nence and, after the lapse of many years, unconsciously transferred it to\nherself,\u2014that is, come to believe that she had been the percipient,\ninstead of him. We have met with clear evidence of such a process\ntaking place in at least one case,\u2014that of an apparition reported to\nhave been seen collectively by the narrator and her maid, which\u2014on\nthe evidence of the former\u2019s diary\u2014turned out to have been seen by\nthe maid only. In order to test whether a similar mistake could have\nbeen made in this case, some further enquiries were made both of Mr.\nF. and of Mrs. Briggs, who has spared no trouble to furnish us with\nall the information and evidence attainable. This is contained in the\nfollowing letters, from which we must leave our readers to form their\nown conclusions.\nFrom Mr. F.\nJam:-ary 12th, 1899.\nI don\u2019t think I have ever seen Mrs. Briggs: then how did she hear of\nmy experience and write to me for details? Either through her daughter,\nwho visited us, or through some member of my own family; at least, I\nsuppose these two are the only sources.\nI do not remember having heard of my daughter\u2019s similar experience to\nmine in regard to the apparition of Mrs. P., my mother-in-law, until you\nmentioned it in your \ufb01rst letter. But in all ordinary matters of memory,\n\f244 Journal of Society for .Psychical Research.

I have almost come to the conclusion that when people see those\nthings they are, unconsciously to themselves, in some curious mental con\ndition which renders it di\ufb02icult for them to give a clear account of their\nexperience. It is one thing to talk, and quite another to write !\u2014Yours\nfaithfully, MARC ARET BRIGGs.\n[P.S.] My daughters have just told me that Mrs. D. was married in\nApril, 1889, and I believe [Mr. F.\u2019s] letter is dated some time in 1891, but\nI do not know who \ufb01rst told me.\nFrom Miss Briggs.\nJanuary 21st [I899].\nI am Mrs. Briggs\u2019 daughter and a school companion of Mrs. D. when\nshe was Miss F. I am inte'rested in your correspondence about the coin\ncidence of Mrs. D. and her father apparently seeing the same apparition of her\ngrandmother, his mother. I am trying to \ufb01nd out the date of my mother\u2019s\nmeeting.Mr. F., which she certainly did. I distinctly remember her talking\nof the circumstance in Yorkshire after her return from London when she\nwas waiting for the written account of the apparition to be sent to Professor\nSidgwick. I think this was between April and June, probably in 1890,\nfrom other attendant circumstances.\nAs I am writing to Mrs. D , however, I will ask her if she can \ufb01nd out\nwhen my mother was at their house after her marriage-\u2014an unmarried sister\nmight remember.\nMr. F. my sister had spoken of when she stayed with the family as\nliving a good deal aloof and saying little to them ; so to us it seemed quite\nnatural that Mrs. D. should not' have told her experience, at least to him ;\nto the other members of the family it was strange. We were surprised at\nmy mother\u2019s extracting such an interesting story from Mr. F., usually so\nuncommunicative\nE. A. BR1ons.\nThe following account of experiences in a \u201chaunted house\u201d (the\naddress of which we are requested not to publish) near Londonderry,\n\fMAY, 1900.] Cases. 245\nwas also obtained through the kindness of Mrs. Briggs from Mrs. D.,\nwho writes :\u2014\nNovember 9th, 1898.\nAs to the haunted house we lived in near Londonderry from June. 1889,\nto August 31st, 1892, it would take pages to mention all the different things\nthat were seen and heard there. Every servant we had saw or felt \u201cghosts\u201d\nabout them, but there were intervals when all was normal. I often heard\nthe crackling of bones and the rustle of non\u2014material creatures, but as I\nnever saw one\u2014and I devoutly prayed that I should not\u2014I leave my\nhusband to give his version of what he saw there, and at one time there was\nno greater sceptic about apparitions than he was.\nThe account enclosed from Mr. D. was as follows :\nIn the year 1892 I was living in a house [near] the city of Londonderry.\nIt was early in January that the following incident happened. I went to\nbed about 10.30 and shortly afterwards was sound asleep. During the night\nI heard loud talking in the room, but at \ufb01rst I did not open my eyes. As\nthe talking continued, I looked up and distinctly saw an old lady standing at\nthe foot of the bed, and gazing intently at me. To get a good view of her\nI sat up in bed and watched her for fully \ufb01ve minutes, she all the time\nlooking quietly into my face. There was no light in the room at the time,\nbut still I could see her quite distinctly, as there was a halo round her.\nAfter watching her for some time I reached out my hand to the matchbox\nto strike a light, but as soon as I moved my hand towards the matches I\nsaw the face getting more indistinct. I therefore drew back my hand and\nwatched the \ufb01gure getting more and more dim till it suddenly vanished.\nThen a curious thing happened. Outside the house and within ten yards\nof the bedroom window I had two kennels, in which a bulldog and a fox\nterrier were chained. The moment the \ufb01gure vanished these two dogs began\nto bark furiously and seemed terribly excited, as if they were trying to get\nat some one. I conclude that they must have seen the spirit after it left my\nroom, for before it disappeared everything about the place was perfectly\nquiet. The dogs continued barking for a few minutes and then all was quiet\nagain. '\nThe following August I left this house and let it furnished. After [my\ntenant] had been in the house for about three months, I asked him one day\nif he ever saw or heard anything peculiar about the place. He laughed and\nsaid he did not believe in ghosts, but that their parlour-maid had seen some\nthing. I asked him what it was, and he told me that one night he and his\nwife were in the drawing-room and the servants had just gone upstairs to\nbed. A few minutes later the parlour-maid came into the room looking\nvery frightened. She said that as she was passing the spare room (the one\nI was in the night I saw the spirit) an old lady suddenly walked out of the\nroom, crossed the passage in front of her, and disappeared into the bedroom\nopposite. When I let the house I never mentioned to any one what I had\nseen, and the servants were entire strangers in the district, having come\nfrom Dublin.\n\f2&6 Journal of Society for l\u2019sycluicod Resecwch. [MAY,1900.\nI may add that a great deal of trouble came to us between the visit of\nthe spirit to me and our leaving the house at the end of the following\nAugust. For one thing our only baby child died on the 1st of August, and\non the night before the cook was too frightened, by hearing spirits around\nher, to go to her bedroom, but preferred to sleep at the foot of the nurse\u2019s\nbed, where they both heard the strangest sounds, as did the nurse on the\nfollowing night just before the child died. After [my tenant] left, I put my\ngardener and his wife into the house to look after it, and although they had\nit rent free, nothing would persuade them to stay. They said they could\nnot live in such a place, and detailed to us the strangest experiences.\nThe only other spiritual being I saw in the house (although I often heard\nthem) was the day before we left, when about 6 p.m. I was standing under\nsome trees about 100 yds. from the house. Then I saw a shadowy substance\nabout 3 or 4 ft. high running quickly up the path beside me. I stepped out\ninto the path to get a full view of it. It went very fast and I thought it\nwas going to pass the house, but the moment it got opposite the hall door it\nsuddenly bounded to the right through the doorway into the hall. The door\nwas open and my wife came out a moment later, but had seen nothing.\nAfter I had seen the \ufb01rst spirit of the woman, my wife asked a lady who\nhad lived there previously if she had ever seen anything of the kind. She\nreplied that their servant had on several occasions seen an old woman in\nspirit form, and from her account it was evidently the same as I had seen.\n(Signed in full) -\u2014 \u2014\n\u2018We have not been able to obtain any further evidence about the\napparitions alleged to have been seen in the house. Mrs. D. also sent\nus a description written by one of her servants of various noises heard\nthere by them. There is no clear evidence, however, that these noises\nwere in any way supernormal, and it seems not unlikely that the state\nof nervousness and expectancy produced by them may have led to the\nvisual hallucinations experienced by some of the inhabitants.\nL. 1120. Collective (?) Apparition.\nThe following account was sent to us by the Rev. R. G. Milburn,\nan Associate of the Society, having been written\u2014evidently with\nscrupulous care\u2014on the day that the incident occurred.\nIt will be seen that the nature of the \ufb01rst incident described is\nand must remain doubtful, since Mr. Milburn could not be certain\nwhether the horse and brougham that he saw were real or hallucina\ntory, and, under the circumstances, no further inquiries could possibly\nclear up this point afterwards. There are two reasons for thinking\nthat they were hallucinatory: (1) The maid who shared Mr. Milburn\u2019s\nexperience afterwards saw a brougham again, which was undoubtedly\n\fMAY, 1000.] Cases. 247\nhallucinatory, since other persons with her looking at the same\nspot saw nothing; and this suggests that her \ufb01rst experience was\nof the same nature; (2) it seems to have been very unlikely that\na real brougham should have come into the front garden in the way\ndescribed. Further, the witnesses thought that they recognised the\nbrougham, horse and coachman (whose originals were certainly else\nwhere at the time). Too much stress, however, cannot be laid on the\nrecognition, as it might have been due to suggestion ; it also occurred\nin an imperfect light, in which mistakes of identity might more easily\nhave been made.\nMr. Milburn describes the occurrence as follows :\u2014\nHollywood House, Wimbledon Common, December 27th, 1899.\nToday, December 27th, 1899, my mother, brothers, and sister had taken\nsome small cousins and two other children to the pantomime. Some of the\nparty, including my mother, went in a brougham. During the performance\nthe coachman seems to have taken more to drink than was expedient, for\nbelieving which there are reasons, though it cannot be proved that he was\nactually drunk. On the way home the brougham collided with an omnibus,\nand suffered some injury, though no one in it was hurt. The party started\nhome from the theatre (the Lyceum) at about 5.10 or 5.15 p.m. At about\n4.30 p.m. a maid saw the brougham waiting at the front door of this house.\nShe saw the coachman\u2019s face, and says she could swear to its having been\nhe. She also saw one of my cousins (who was not in the vehicle at the time\nof the accident) step out of the brougham and run up the steps toward the\nhouse. She heard no bell ring. A few minutes later she saw the brougham\nin the yard with the horse taken out and the coachman walking about in\nstable boots, as if cleaning the carriage. She told the housemaid what she\nhad seen. She also told my grandmother. My grandmother told me at about\n4.55 p.m. that Howe (the maid) had seen the brougham.\nAt about the time that the maid saw the brougham\u2014I should say about\n4.35 p.m.\u2014I thought I heard a brougham draw up and some one get out\nand run up the steps. I heard no bell. I looked out of the window\nand saw a brougham drive out of the front garden. I assumed it to be\nours, and watched it, wondering where it was off to; it did not take\nthe direction I thought most probable. I then assumed it to have been\nthe brougham of some visitor, but I subsequently found that the servants\nknew nothing of any one having called, nor did my grandmother. When\nthe latter told me that Howe had seen the brougham (i.e., our brougham) I\nsaid that it was a mistake and that it was some other brougham. When 1\ncame into the room where my grandmother was at about 5.30 p.m. I heard\nthe maid saying something to her about going into the witness-box. My\ngrandmother told me that the maid was positive she had seen our coachman.\nMy mother and those with her arrived home about 6.30. Those of\nthe party who came by train arrived about 6.15. The maid told me what\nshe had seen at about 7.15 p.m. When I cross-questioned her about it\n\f248 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY,1900.\na little later, she said the time was about half-past four or a little later\nabout twenty-\ufb01ve minutes to \ufb01ve. When she found that the brougham\nhad not returned she was in a great fright, and was afraid my mother must\nhave been killed. Nothing of the kind had happened to her before, but\nshe knew of a case that had happened in her village. At about 10.30\np.m. I spoke to the housemaid, who told me that Howe had told her that\nshe had seen the brougham and the coachman. It was about half-past\nfour, or perhaps a little earlier, that she had told her this.\nR. G. MILBuRN.\nDecember 28th.\u2014All the servants deny that they saw or heard any\nbrougham come yesterday. My grandmother heard a brougham come (she\nwas with the maid Howe at the time, about 4.30) and saw the top of the\nbrougham or the coachman\u2019s hat pass the window and then pass again as if\ndriving away again. (This coincides with what I saw; a brougham would\nhave to pass the window twice in turning round a \ufb02ower-bed on the path\nbefore driving out again.) In the meanwhile Howe had left the room to tell\nthe housemaid, and saw the brougham as described in the stable-yard. I\nasked her to-day whether she was very nervous when she found that the\nbrougham had not really returned. She replied, \u201c I was very frightened\nindeed.\u201d I then asked her whether she had prayed. She answered, \u201cI\ncommitted Mrs. Milburn to God\u2019s care.\u201d It would take, I am told, three\nquarters of an hour to drive from here to the Lyceum. I have asked the\ncoachman\u2019s wife whether he was here yesterday afternoon; she says no.\nHowe recognised the brougham and horse as well as the coachman, but she\ndoubts whether my grandmother, who is very old and has a very uncertain\nrecollection, either saw or heard anything. The brougham which I saw drive\nout went in the direction of Kingston ; not towards London.\nThe coachman, who has just returned from taking the brougham to be\nmended, denies that he was here yesterday afternoon, and declares that the\nhorse was not put into the brougham again till 4.50. R\u2018 G. MILBURN.\nThe above statements, so far as they relate to my experiences, are\nabsolutely correct.\n(Signed) EDITH S. A. Hows,\nDecember 28th, 1899.\nMr. Milburn adds :\u2014\nThis account should have stated that after telling the other servants, the\nmaid Howe looked in the stable-yard a second time and still saw the\nbrougham, etc. The other servants looked into the yard, but saw nothing.\nIt cannot be proved that no brougham came into the front garden by\nmistake, and after stopping a minute, drove out again.\nMr. Milburn writes later :\nJanuary 5th, 1900.\nOur coachman put up at Ward\u2019s, (jobmaster, etc.), Endel-street, Drury\nlane. None of us here doubt this part of the story. Even if the coachman\ncould have driven over here by 4.30 or 4.35, taken the horse out, cleaned the\n\fMAY, 1900.] ' Cases. ' - ' 249\nbrougham, put it in again and driven up in time (and they say the horse did\nnot look as if it had just been driven when they started home)\u2014it would\nhave been so absolutely irrational and pointless a thing to do that it is\nincredible. R, G. MmRoRN\nThe sceptical explanation is not that the coachman really drove\nover here, but that a brougham resembling ours drove in by mistake (and\nthis cannot be disproved) and that the vision in the stable-yard was due to\nthe maid\u2019s nervousness or \u201c imagination.\u201d\nThe following letters from Mr. Milburn give further details of the\nincident, in answer to our questions :\u2014\nHollywood House, Wimbledon Common, January 23rd, 1900.\nI send you, as desired, a plan of the front garden, stable-yard, etc. [see p.\n250]. The lines on the drive and stable-yard indicate the places where the\nbrougham was seen ; the dots indicate the way it must have gone where its\nmovements were not followed. The [dots] in the house indicate the move\nments of the maid. A is where she was sitting when she heard the brougham\ndrive up. She then went to B to look out of the window and saw it drive up\nand stop, or that it had stopped, I forget which, at the front door. She then\nsaw the carriage door open and a little boy (who was one of the party, but had\nnot been in the brougham, at any rate on its way back) get out and come up\nthe steps. Then she returned to A. Not hearing any ring, she went back to\nO (= B) and saw the brougham still there. It was just beginning to grow\ndusk then (about 4.30 or 35), and she could clearly see the coachman\u2019s face\nas well as the horse and the carriage. She then returned from the window,\nbut, still hearing nothing, she went to ask whether the party had returned.\nHearing from the other servants that they had not, she opened the side door\nand saw from point D the brougham straight in front of her in the yard.\nShe then told the housemaid and parlourmaid, who both looked out from the\nsame place, D, but could not see it. Then she came back herself and saw it\nagain [at E] (E=D). The lamp in the stable-yard had been lighted. The\nroom from which she saw it \ufb01rst was on the ground \ufb02oor, as is also the door,\nI) and E. I was two stories higher up above the same room. The lodge\nkeeper was away.\nThe maid began to feel alarmed when she learnt that the party in\nthe brougham had not returned, i.e., after she had seen it in the front, but\nbefore she had seen it in the stable-yard.\nJanuary 31st, 1900.\nI feel pretty sure that the maid could not have suspected that the coach\nman would get intoxicated. He has never, to our knowledge, taken too\nmuch since he has been with us before. He is an extremely good coachman ;\nthe horse then in the brougham was by no means an excitable animal ; and\nsince it is such an extremely common thing for my mother to go out in the\nbrougham, and nothing dangerous, or alarming, or suspicious has happened\nbefore, it is most improbable that she should have developed sudden_\nsuspicions of possible insobriety. I feel sure she would have told me if she\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [MAY,1900.\n\fMAY,1900.] A Supposed Case of \u201cSpirit-Photograph;\/.\u201d 251\nhad done so, when telling me the story, and when I asked her (see end of my\nlast letter) whether or when she felt alarmed, she said that it was when the\nother servants told her the brougham had not returned, i.e., after she had\ntwice seen the coachman, and, according to her very positive account,\nrecognised him plainly. She either said in so many words, or at least gave\nme the decided impression, that she had not been anxious before.\nA point I might have mentioned was that the brougham I saw seemed to\nbe walking very leisurely for one that had just discovered that it had got\ninto the wrong garden. The horse was walking when I \ufb01rst saw it, though\nit was trotting when it went out of the gate. A coachman who had come in\nby mistake would probably have walked the horse smartly [round the\n\ufb02ower-bed], and then trotted it out. But [at this point] it seemed to be\nproceeding very leisurely, and more as if it were empty. It looked, as I\nsaid, like our brougham, and I took it to be ours, but I could not speak very\npositively. The coachman I did not particularly notice. The horse was\nexactly like our horse to my eyes, but I could not swear that it was, and\nwhen it went off up the Kingston-road I assumed that it was only another\nvery like ours. So my evidence cannot count as anything very clear and\nde\ufb01nite.\nFeb'ruar_1\/ 21st, 1900.\nI believe I stated in my last communication that the horse I saw\nwas \u201c exactly like \u201d the horse of ours that actually was in the brougham. I\nshould have said \u201cthe horse attracted a very fair amount of attention on my\npart, and when I saw our animal the next morning (in the same place and\nseen from the same room as the supposed apparition) I recognised that it\nwas exactly like the horse then seen.\u201d As a matter of fact I had too vague\nan idea of the colour of the animal previously to be able to recognise anything\nas being \u201cexactly\u201d like it. . . . I believe [also that] I underrated my\nrecognition of the coachman. I was not certain enough that the coachman\nseen by me was just like our coachman to make an argument about it from\nmy point of view worth while, so I think I was a little inclined to disclaim\ntoo much all recognition of him for the sake of getting rid of the subject,\nwhile at the same time avoiding overstatement .\nR. G. MILBURN.\nA SUPPOSED CASE OF \u201c SPIRIT-PHOTOGRAPHY.\u201d\nBY PRoFEssoR W. F. BARRETT.\nAlthough the readers of this Journal must, I am sure, be getting\ntired of the discussion on the case of supposed \u201c spirit-photography,\u201d\na few concluding words seem necessary in reply to the remarks made\nby Mr. McLachlan in the April number. These remarks are based\nupon a series of assumptions which, so far as they relate to my own\nexperiments, are not only incorrect but the reverse of the truth. I\nentered upon the investigation with an entirely open mind and should\n\f252 Journal of Society for P8]\/clricut Ifesewrch. [MAY, 1900.\nnot have taken up the matter at all had it not seemed to me that a\ngood primd facie case existed for investigation. When it became\nevident, from my correspondence and interview with the lady who took\nthe photograph, that some one might have entered the ,room she was\nphotographing during her absence from it, and whilst the exposure\nwas taking place, my \ufb01rst object was to see if an appearance in any\nway resembling the so-called spirit-photograph could be produced by a\ncasual intruder. I confess, though I am an old amateur photographer,\nthat I was astonished to \ufb01nd how close a resemblance was produced to\nthe legless and shadowy \ufb01gure of the \u201c ghost\u201d in the very \ufb01rst photo\ngraphic experiment I made. The actual length of exposure in the two\ncases, on which Mr. McLachlan bases so much, is simply a question of\nlight and the kind of plate used. The exposure in my experiment, Mr.\nMcLachlan assumes to have been \u201ca minute or less\u201d ; it was actually\nabout twenty minutes, one\u2014third that of the \u201c ghost\u201d picture.\nThough of no particular novelty to experienced photographers, my\nexperiment showed clearly enough : (1) That during the exposure of a\nplate for an \u201cinterior\u201d a person may leisurely enter and leave a room,\ncoming well within the \ufb01eld of the lens in so doing, and yet leave' no\ntrace of his entrance or exit. (2) That the intruder seating himself in\na chair for, say, about a sixtieth of the time of the total exposure, and\ncasually crossing and uncrossing his legs and moving one arm, leaves\nan impression on the photographic plate su\ufb02iciently resembling that of\nthe so-called \u201cspirit-photograph\u201d to suggest a not improbable explana\ntion of the latter. The only point that remained was the apparent\nresemblance between the \u201cghost\u201d and the deceased nobleman. The\nevidence on this point, however, was too slight and con\ufb02icting to be of\nany weight. It received nevertheless most careful and dispassionate\ninvestigation ; in faet_ve_ry much more time and care was spent on the\ninquiry than appears from the published record. Though there were\nsome curious points of apparent resemblance noticed, yet when one\ntakes i_nto account the di\ufb02iculty of avoiding reading some resemblance\ninto a shadowy \ufb01gure which is seen seated in the room habitually\noccupied by the deceased person when living, and the inevitable\nassociation of ideas suggested by the funeral of that person taking\nplace close to \u2018the spot and at the time the so-called \u201cspirit\nphotograph \u201d was being taken, I think it is obvious how cautious we\nshould be in drawing any inferences from the dubious and con\ufb02icting\nopinions that existed as to identi\ufb01cation. I should have been\nextremely glad if Mr. McLachlan had been able to make an instructive\ncontribution to the discussion of this -interesting photograph, but I\ncannot feel that he has succeeded in doing so.\n\fNo. CLXX.\u2014VoL.

Yet if recognition is to be paid primarily to actual work per\nformed for our Research, the name of Edmund Gurney must occur as\nthat which all would fain have honoured ;\u2014the man whose attitude\ntowards our Research was of the loftiest, the most unsel\ufb01sh kind,\u2018 the\nman who -felt most strongly the sheer moral need of discovering a\nfuture life, if the cruel injustices of this life are to be conceived as\ncompatible with a First Cause worthy of love or worship.\n3, For most men the quest of immortality will answer to a stronger\nelement of personal desire ;\u2014although such desire need not imply bias\nin the estimation of evidence.\n4. No attachment to Christian tradition, no recognition of the need\nand value of high intuitions, should blind us to the fact that only on\ntruths scienti\ufb01cally demonstrated can a world-philosophy or world\nreligion be based.\n5. Yet the facts proved by Science have not thus far been adequate\nto satisfy the spiritual needs of mankind. May not Science discover\nfurther facts which may at any rate prove the preamble of all religions ?\n6. Such is our attempt ;\u2014for we believe that by maintaining unity\nof method in our search for every form of truth we have the best\nchance of discovering new facts of deep spiritual importance.\n7. And, in fact, this line of inquiry has already pointed us to a\nhidden, subliminal world within us,\u2014and through that world to an\nunseen, but responsive, spiritual world without.\n8. And if the messages from that unseen world be felt at present\nto be inadequate to our desires, yet our faith in the coherence and\nintelligibility of at least the material universe should lead us to trust\nthat clarity and dignity cannot be permanently lacking in any system\nof communications which may proceed from the Universe of Spirit.\n9. We seem, indeed, to be awakening into a new consciousness of\nthe living solidarity of the human race, in this world and the next,\nwhich will afford an adequate motive for utmost effort and highest\nhope.\n10. But if we are thus to gain the advantage of scienti\ufb01c certainty\nfor our deepest beliefs, we are bound in return to treat the scienti\ufb01c\nvirtues as necessary to salvation.\n11. The especial function of the Society for Psychical Research\nshould be to insist upon this view, and to form an advisory centre for\nwidespread investigation.\n12. For aid in this task we can address our claim alike to the\nscienti\ufb01c and to the religious world ; our wider Science, of which\nReligion is the subjective aspect, must come not to destroy, but to\nful\ufb01l.

[Juma, 1900.\nTHE FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF\nPSYCHOLOGY.\nWe desire to call the special attention of our readers to the\nInternational Congress of Psychology, to be held at Paris, August 20th\nto 25th, under the presidency of PRoFEssoR TH.

Those who\nattended the previous Congresses of Psychology at Paris, London, and\nMunich, will remember how much there was of interest and instruction\nfor psychical researchers in the papers and discussions that took place\non those occasions, and we hope that many of our members will \ufb01nd\nan opportunity of joining in the present Congress. _\nWe print below the provisional circular and programme issued\nsome months ago, hoping to be able to give a more complete account\nof the scheme of proceedings in our next number.

This account is taken from an article entitled \u201c Duplex\nPersonality: Report of a Case,\u201d by William F. Drewry, M.D., of Peters\nburg, Virginia, U.S.A., in the Medico-Legal Journal for June, 1896.\nThe following case, which came under my observation within the past\nyear, and the details of which were kindly given me by an eminent\npractitioner of Virginia,* who was the family physician of the patient,\ntypi\ufb01es the peculiar phases of duplex personality and periodic extinction of\n* Dr. H. G. Leigh, Sr., of Petersburg, Va.\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jcss, 1900.\nmemory, and is interesting from a psychologic, as well as clinical point of\nview. It is also of interest as regards forensic medicine.\nMr. K. was a man \ufb01fty years old, of splendid physique, in good health,\nin fairly comfortable circumstances, doing a mercantile business, sober,\nmoral and industrious, of affable disposition, popular with a large circle of\nfriends, member of several secret benevolent orders, and happy and\ncontented in his domestic relations. He was born and reared in the State ;\nhad resided and conducted business in\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014for twenty or more years, and\ndeservedly bore the reputation of being a correct, straightforward man in\nevery particular. He had for years been one of the town o\ufb02icials.\nOne of his near relatives (an uncle, I think) at about the age of \ufb01fty,\nwithout any apparent reason whatever, went out West, leaving his wife\nand children, and was not heard of for many years. Finally he came back\non a visit and remained a short time with his family and old acquaintances.\nNo explanation was given of his strange conduct. It was thought that he\nhad some form of mental disease. I mention this case to show that Mr. K.\nmight have inherited some neuropathic taint or eccentricity.\nOne day, while apparently in perfect health, without any premonitory\nsymptoms of mental derangement, Mr. K. went to a northern city to\npurchase goods for his store. While there two days he transacted a great\ndeal of business, met many old friends and exhibited no indication of\naberration of mind. Starting homeward he registered as a passenger on a\ncertain steamer; feeling very tired he secured a state-room, to which at\nonce he repaired, changed his linen, etc. When tickets were collected he\nwas missing. He had suddenly and mysteriously disappeared. No one had\nseen him leave the boat, jump or fall overboard. An acquaintance, how\never, said that he was reasonably certain that he saw Mr. K. several hours\nafter the boat had left, in one of the depots in the city. He was sitting\ndown, hat pulled over his face, and seemed to be in a \u201c deep study,\u201d so he\nwas not disturbed. Mr. K.\u2019s open valise and all his clothes, except those he\nwore, were found in his state-room. The room door was open, but the key\nhad been taken away.\nSome suspected he had been robbed and thrown overboard; others\nthought he had (suddenly) become insane, or had had a \ufb01t and fallen into\nthe sea ; the suicide theory was also indulged in, and the opinion was enter\ntained by some that he had absconded. But what had become of him, why,\nwhen and how he disappeared were mysteries. He had, unobserved, simply\n\u201c stepped out into the great unknown.\u201d A vigorous search was made to \ufb01nd\nhim, dead or alive, detectives were employed, the newspapers teemed with\naccounts of the strange and unaccountable going away of this well-known\nman, but no clue was to be had that would throw any light whatever upon\nhis mysterious disappearance.\nFinally search was abandoned, the theory that he was dead accepted, and\nthe court appointed an administrator of his estate and a guardian for his\nchildren. His business was purchased by his son, and everything was\nmoving along smoothly, when, six months after he was last heard of, he\nsuddenly and unexpectedly appeared at the home of a relative in a distant\n\fJuNE, 1900.] A Case of Duplex Personality. 267\nsouthern city. [Ie was brought home in a composed, but partially dazed\ncondition, able to recognise but few of his friends. He was an entirely\nchanged man\u2014the physical and psychical metamorphoses were quite\ncomplete. He was hardly recognised by his friends. He had reduced in\nweight from 250 to 150 pounds and was very feeble. He wore the same\nsuit of clothes he had on at the time he disappeared, and had in his pocket\nthe check and key which were given him on the boat.\nHe was at once put under treatment, and in four weeks he recovered his\nprevious bodily and mental health, and has since conducted his same old\nbusiness with his accustomed skill and industry. A day or two after his\nreturn home an abscess, deep down in the auditory canal, broke and discharged\na large quantity of sanguino-purulent matter. Immediately thereupon\nimprovement began and went on rapidly. This was a 'remarkable fact, and\nis, I think, worthy of special note.\nHear Mr. K.\u2019s own account of his strange case: \u201cI was feeling very\ntired\u2014thoroughly fatigued\u2014after a very busy day in the city, so went to my\nstate-room immediately upon going aboard the boat and changed my\nclothes. Up to that time I was thoroughly conscious, but after that I\nrecall nothing\u2014a]l \u2018was oblivion\u2014till six months later when \u2018I came sud\ndenly to myself\u2019 in a distant city in the South, where I knew no one. I\nfound myself driving a fruit-waggon on the street. I was utterly astounded.\nWhy I was there, how and when I got there, where I came from, whatl had\nbeen doing, were puzzling questions to me. Upon inquiry I learned that I\nhad been there, and at work, for some time. My life since I was in that\nstate-room had been an absolute blank to me. I can give no account of\nmyself during that period of time. I started at once for Virginia, but on\nthe way I again lost consciousness, though only for a day or two. When\nfurther on my way home, I felt so utterly worn out, I stopped in a certain\ntown and went to the house of a very near relative. From there I was\ntaken home. I was in a half-dazed, confused condition, and remained so\nsome days longer. I am now feeling well and all right.\u201d\nThis case bears many striking resemblances to others that have been\nfrom time to time reported, but there are two points of special interest.\nFirst, the inherited tendency to eccentricity, if not to insanity. His\nmysterious disappearance occurred at the same age at which his progenitor\nso strangely disappeared. Second, the abscess in the ear, the discharge of\nwhich was followed by a rapid return to normal mentality. Is it not\nprobable that this abscess had some etiologic connection with the mental\ntrouble, by producing a maladjustment of the cerebral functions, a disturbance\nof the circulation, an endarteritis, which would induce a condition of\nencephalic anaemia, or a suppression of suppuration, which would effect a\nhypereemia ?\n\u201cLoss of memory,\u201d says Rosse, \u201cfollowing organic lesion, dynamic\ntrouble, or any sudden metabolic disturbance of the brain, may recover\nrapidly.\u201d Certainly Mr. K. made a rapid, uninterrupted recovery after the\nabscess had discharged. His physician said that there was a perceptible\nchange for the better just as soon as the car was relieved.\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychicat Research. [JuNE, 1900.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not resjaonsible for opinions expressed by Corresponde-nts.]\n[The following letter in reference to the discussion printed in the\nJonrnal for April on Professor Hyslop\u2019s Report of his sittings\nwith Mrs. Piper, was received too late for insertion in the May\nissue.\u2014ED.]\n(To the Editor of the JoURNAL oF THE SoCIETY FoR PsYCHIC.-KL RssEARoH.)\nThe abstract of Mr. Podmore\u2019s remarks on my report, a part of which\nwas read at the meeting of March 2nd, indicates a misapprehension both of\nmy object and of my position in the discussion of my sittings, and disregards\nalso in one important case the most distinct disavowals possible on my part.\nOne would naturally suppose from his remarks at propos of the mental\nattitude and phraseology of the chief communicator, that I had laid great\nstress upon this feature of the case, when, as a matter of fact, I did nothing\nof the sort. I have been at great pains to deal with many minor character\nistics, not because I regarded them as evidential, but because it was\nimportant to ascertain how far every little detail appeared consistent or\ninconsistent with the main question at issue, and because tri\ufb02es often\nconstitute corroborative incidents, while they have no intrinsic value if\ntaken alone. Nowhere in the report do I attempt to decide at large the\nrelative merits of the individual facts. I have left this to the reader with\nthe expectation that he would understand the psychological problem\nsu\ufb02iciently to render such an explanation unnecessary. I do not see\nthat I am obliged in every case to say whether my picture is a horse\nor a cow.\nThe reader is also likely to misapprehe1id the statement about the names\nin the \ufb01rst sitting. One illustration impeaching the strength of the evidence\nis that \u201cof the names given at the \ufb01rst sitting, only \ufb01ve out of seventeen\nwere identi\ufb01ed as correct.\u201d This absolutely ignores the fact that I had both\nemphatically disclaimed in more than one passage any importance for that\nsitting, and had actually isolated my account of it for that very reason. I\nmay add also that I should not have claimed any importance for it spiritis\ntically if the whole seventeen names had been correct. My experiments on\nidenti\ufb01cation, imitating the Piper case in some of its aspects, and already\ncommented on in the Journal, show that personal identity can be established\nsuccessfully withoitt giving names on evidence as slight perhaps as is found\nin my \ufb01rst sitting, to say nothing of the later sittings. The real problem\ndepends less on names than on incidents and psychological considerations\nthat increase the dif\ufb01culties of telepathy. On this latter point I had been\nespecially emphatic, and it leaves a false impression to omit the fact from\nconsideration while stating a truism about names.\nJ. H.

[Jun, 1900.\nSeveral other matters having been attended to, it was agreed that\nthe next Meeting of the Council should be on Monday, July 16th, at\n19, Buckingham Street, at 4.30 p.m., a General Meeting having been\narranged for the evening of that day, at 8.30 p.m.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 106th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nWestminster Town Hall on Friday, June 22nd, at 4 p.m. ; the\nPresident, Mr. F. VV. H. MYERs, in the chair.\nThe PREsIDENT read a paper on \u201cPseudo-possession,\u201d combining\nreviews of two recent French works, Professor Janet\u2019s N\u00e9vroses ct id\u00e9ea\nfixes, and Professor Flournoy\u2019s Des Indes (\u2018I la plom\u00e9te Mars. Each of\nthese works treated of cases where there was an apparent invasion or\npossession of a living human organism by an external spirit ; although\nthe cases in Professor Janet\u2019s book were frankly pathological, while\nwith Professor Flournoy\u2019s subject there was no reason to assume any\nmorbid taint.\nProfessor Janet\u2019s book was a record of cases observed at the\nSalp\u00e9triiare ;\u2014and especially of id\u00e9es \ufb01a:es,\u2014memories or imaginations\nor emotions which somehow become hypertrophied and irremovable,\u2014\ndominating the patient\u2019s mental life and resisting all ordinary\nattempts to meet them by argument. Professor Janet has shown once\nmore how in\ufb01nitely more potent is hypnotic suggestion than any other\nform of treatment in dealing with these \u201cobsessions.\u201d For these\n\ufb01xed ideas are in truth obsessions of mind as a whole by a particular\nfragment of the mind. The man is obsessed by a memory or a\npassion of his own which constrains him as cruelly as though it were\nin fact a possessing devil.\nIn one case of Dr. Janet\u2019s, indeed, the morbidly remorseful\nmemory of a past act did gradually assume for the sufferer the\npersonality of an indwelling \ufb01end. It was precisely the sort of\ndemoniacal possession which in old days ecclesiastics healed with\nexorcisms, or when exorcisms failed, with the stake. Dr. Janet used\ngentler suggestions, and succeeded in gradually dispelling the morbid\npreoccupation, and restoring the poor man from his imagined hell to\nthe existence of every day.\nThe book to which the speaker next turned had for readers of our\nProceedings an even directer interest. It happened, no doubt, to any\ngroup which pursued for many years a somewhat unfamiliar line of\n\fJuLY, 1900.] General Meeting. 271\ninquiry that those of their points which were \ufb01rst assailed got\ngradually admitted, so that as they became interested in new points\nthey might scarcely observe what change had taken place in the\nreception of the old. The reader of early volumes of our Proceedings\nwould often observe this kind of progress of opinion. And now\nProfessor Flournoy\u2019s book indicated in a remarkable way how things\nhad moved in the psychology of the last twenty years. The book,\u2014a\nmodel of fairness throughout,\u2014was, indeed, for the most part, criti\ncally destructive in its treatment of the quasi-supernormal phenomena\nwith which it dealt. But what a mass of conceptions a competent\npsychologist now took for granted in this realm, which the o\ufb02icial\nscience of twenty years ago would scarcely stomach our hinting at !\nOne important point might be noticed at once as decisively\ncorroborating a contention of the speaker\u2019s own made long ago, and at\na time when it probably seemed fantastic to many readers. Arguing\nfor the potential continuity of subliminal mentation (as against those\nwho urged that there were only occasional \ufb02ashes of submerged\nthought, like scattered dreams) he had said that it would soon be found\nneedful to press this notion of a continuous subliminal self to the\nutmost, if we were not prepared to admit a continuous spiritual\nguidance or possession. Now, in fact, with Professor Flournoy\u2019s\nsubject the whole discussion turned on this very point. There was\nunquestionably a continuous and complex series of thoughts and feel\nings going on beneath the threshold of consciousness of M118 \u201c H\u00e9lene\nSmith.\u201d Was this submerged mentation due in any degree or in any\nmanner to the operation of spirits other than MHe Smith\u2019s own?\nThat was the broad question; but it was complicated here by a\nsubsidiary question;\u2014whether, namely, any previous incarnations of\nMII6 Smith\u2019s,\u2014other phases of her own spiritual history, now involving\ncomplex relationship with the past\u2014had any part in the crowd of\npersonalities which seemed struggling to express themselves through\nher quite healthy organism.\nA detailed survey of the records of MII0 Smith\u2019s phenomena\nseemed to show that they were all or almost all explicable by an\nunusually complex activity of her subliminal self.\nThe speaker concluded with a few general re\ufb02ections which this\nremarkable case of Professor Flournoy\u2019s, nay, which even some of\nDr. Janet\u2019s morbid cases,\u2014seemed to suggest to the psychologist who\ncared to look beyond either the narrowing hospital-walls or the per\nplexing s\u00e9ance-room.\n\u201cThe chief re\ufb02ection,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we are as yet but in a\nchildish or rudimentary stage of our use of the human brain. That\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. ['JuLY, 1900.\nbrain is in truth (as some one has said) but \u2018a virtual organ \u2019;\u2014an\norgan en vote ofacquisition, which man is slowly learning to use,\u2014but\nwith very little notion either of how it came to be what it is, or of\nwhat it ultimately may be.\n\u201c No one, indeed, knows how it came to be what it is. No one has\neven plausibly explained that great difference between the simian\nand the savage organ which seems so incommensurate with any observ\nable difference between the hairy chimpanzee and the hairy Aino.\nSome naturalists argue that much of the savage\u2019s brain-power must\nlie dormant;\u2014must somehow be a mere reserve for the later calls\nof a more complex existence. If this be admitted, we must surely\ngo on to admit that a large proportion of the braIn\u2019s capacity is\ndormant still.\n\u201c I do not mean to predict that our race will necessarily include in\nthe future individual minds more powerful than any minds in the past.\nThis question ultimately depends upon that unknown factor,\u2014the\nnature of the sources from which spiritual life is infused into mortal\norganisms. Let us admit that judging by the last two thousand\nyears we have little ground for con\ufb01dence in any such advance of the\nhighest individual level. Let us not be rash enough to prophesy\nthat there will ever be a sculptor better than Praxiteles, or a lyric\npoet better than Pindar. Yet the important fact is that the great\nspirits of the past made use only of certain portions of the human\nbrain which had through some historic cause been the \ufb01rst to be\ndeveloped. The spirits of Pindar or Praxiteles dwelt, so to say, in the\npalace-chambers of their mysterious habitation; they knew nothing of\nthe foundations on which the City of Mansoul was builded, or of its\ntreasure-houses in the living rock.\n\u201c Of course H\u00e9lene\u2019s intellect, though serviceable enough in common\nlife, is not of a calibre to confer new knowledge or delight on educated\nmen; but for I-I\u00e9lene\u2019s one-in-a-hundred mind substitute the one-in-a\nmillion mind of Louis Stevenson ;\u2014let him dream\u2014not H\u00e9llene\u2019s\ninsipid tale of \u201cEsenale,\u2019 but \u2018Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\u2019 and one\nsees at once the advantage of relegating voluntary ends to automatic\nexecution,\u2014and so at once saving brain-centres from expensive\nfriction and getting the needed thing done (like those reaction-time\nmeasurements of Dr. Janet\u2019s during ecstasy), with a verve and a\ncompleteness which conscious effort \ufb01nds it hard to rival. May not\nthat effortless concurrent utilisation of all elements of the personality\nhold ultimately somewhat the same relation to our present painful\nthought as multiplex telegraphy holds to the old slow and single\ntransmission along the wire?\n\fJon, 1900.] General Meeting. 273\n\u201c Let us frankly confess that we cannot in the least tell what the\nbrain will do till we try. The assumed balance of our faculties and our\nenvironment is altogether chimerical. The environment is unknown\nand in\ufb01nite, and the faculties have simply got to go as far in every\ndirection as they can. We have attained no position of permanent\nstability, and we have nothing to tell us cipriori what will be the next\nfaculties which our race will evolve. And yet popular science some\ntimes speaks as though nearly everything in human nature had been.\nobserved already !\u2014as though normality had been de\ufb01ned, aberrations\nclassi\ufb01ed, a mass of experience acquired which our successors will only\nhave to work out in detail ! A vain conceit ! a monstrous prematurity!\nRather let us remember that only by an abiding consciousness of our\nown inevitable childishness can we prevent those successors from\nlooking on our religions with pity, and on our science with con\ntempt ;\u2014while they analyse with a smile our rudimentary efforts at\nself-realisation,\u2014remarking \u2018how hard a thing it was to found the\nrace of man.\u2019 \u201d\nPRoFEssoR BARRETT said he felt it was di\ufb02icult to discuss the\nsuggestive paper which they had listened to with so much interest\nwithout a careful perusal of it beforehand. Perhaps it might be\nfound possible\u2014following the custom of some other scienti\ufb01c societies\n\u2014in the case of a paper being already in type, that a proof of it\nshould be sent beforehand to any member who asked for it with a\nview to joining in the discussion of it at a meeting.\nAs regards the in\ufb02uence of suggestion which had been referred to\nin the paper, he had frequently noticed how much more potent an\nindirect than a direct suggestion was in the whole group of phenomena\nwhich came under the head of human automatism. Here he might\nperhaps mention that in a letter which was published in 1875 he had\npointed out that before we could hope to study with advantage the\ncomplex psychical phenomena of \u201cspiritualism,\u201d we must \ufb01rst know\nmore of the part played by suggestion and thought-transference in\nthese phenomena: for at that time the action of mind upon mind,\nindependently of the recognised channels of sense, was ridiculed by\nscienti\ufb01c men and not considered by spiritualists. Subsequent ex\nperience had, however, shown, as the President has pointed out, the\nimportance of these factors in a critical study of the various phe\nnomena investigated by this Society. Having referred to one or two\nother points, Professor Barrett concluded by moving a warm vote of\nthanks to the President for his instructive and suggestive paper.\n[For some further discussion of this paper, see the \u201cCorrespon\ndence\u201d below, p. 288.]\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [JuL\\', 1900.\nFOUNDATION OF A PSYCHICAL INSTITUTE IN PARIS.\nWe desire to call the attention of our readers to an important\nscheme which has just been completed for the foundation of an Inter\nnational Psychical Institute in Paris, the intention of which is to\nprovide all possible facilities for the study\u2014both experimental and\ntheoretical\u2014of psychical phenomena. The programme of the Institute,\nwhich we reprint here, is signed by Professor Pierre Janet and an\nin\ufb01uential Comit\u00e9 de Patronage, among whom are to be found men\neminent throughout the civilised world for their services to psychology,\npsychical research, and other branches of learning. '\nSOCIETE INTERNATIONALE DE L'INSTITUT PSYCHIQUE.\nLe si\u00e8cle qui va \ufb01nir a vu toutes les sciences qui \u00e9tudient le monde\nphysique faire des progr\u00e8s consid\u00e9rables, et il est impossible d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer les\nbienfaits de toutes sortes dont l\u2019humanit\u00e9 est aujourd\u2019hui redevable aux\nd\u00e9couvertes de ces sciences. Mais les sciences qui ont pour objet la pens\u00e9e\nde l\u2019homme, les lois de l\u2019esprit humain, les rapports du physique et du\nmoral, n\u2019ont suivi que bien lentement la marche rapide des connaissances\nqui s'appliquent \u00e0. la mati\u00e8re.\nIl est certain cependant que les sciences de l\u2019esprit pourraient \u00eatre aussi\nutiles et peut-\u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cieuses encore que les sciences des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\nmat\u00e9riels. Elles pourraient expliquer bien des lois de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et permettre\npeut-\u00eatre de mieux \u00e9tablir les relations sociales. Elles devraient jouer un\ngrand r\u00f4le dans notre jurisprudence criminelle et pr\u00e9parer peut-\u00eatre une\nv\u00e9ritable prophylaxie du crime. Les \u00e9tudes de p\u00e9dagogie ne seraient qu'une\nannexe des recherches psychologiques et celles-ci seules permettraient de\nr\u00e9former, en connaissance de cause, nos m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9ducation et d\u2019enseigne\nment. Un domaine o\u00f9 les sciences psychologiques plus avanc\u00e9es rendraient\ndes services incalculables est celui de la m\u00e9decine mentale. Si l\u2019on en juge\npar les progr\u00e8s que quelques connaissances scienti\ufb01ques relatives aux ph\u00e9no\nm\u00e8nes du somnambulisme, de la suggestion, de la division de conscience ont\nd\u00e9j\u00e0. fait faire \u00e0. la th\u00e9rapeutique de quelques maladies nerveuses. on peut\ndeviner qu'un grand nombre de n\u00e9vroses, de si tristes et de si terribles mala\ndies de l\u2019esprit, ne sont aujourd\u2019hui incurables qu'\u00e0. cause de notre ignorance.\nEn\ufb01n, n\u2019est-il pas \u00e9vident que la science de la pens\u00e9e est, plus que toute\nautre, capable de satisfaire la curiosit\u00e9 inqui\u00e8te de l\u2019esprit humain? Sans\ndoute il est peu probable qu'une science puisse jamais nous expliquer\ncompl\u00e8tement le probl\u00e8me de notre nature et de nos destin\u00e9es, mais\ncependant aucune ne touche d\u2019aussi pr\u00e8s \u00e0. ces questions insolubles que l\u2019\u00e9tude\nde l\u2019esprit. On en voit facilement la preuve dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat passionn\u00e9 qu'ont\nsuscit\u00e9 certains faits qui sont en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 des faits psychologiques, tels que les\nph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes d\u00e9crits sous le nom de d\u00e9doublement de la conscience, de\nsuggestion mentale, de t\u00e9l\u00e9pathie, de lucidit\u00e9, de m\u00e9diumnit\u00e9. Ces faits ont\n\u00e9videmment pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 au plus haut point bien des esprits, parce qu'ils\nsembl\u00e8rent se rattacher aux puissances les plus profondes de la pens\u00e9e.

Il est incontestable\nque, de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s, on a essay\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer \u00e0. la psychologie les m\u00e9thodes\nexp\u00e9rimentales et inductives qui ont amen\u00e9 le merveilleux d\u00e9veloppement\ndes sciences physiques. La mesure math\u00e9matique a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la\npsychologie dans les recherches de psycho-physique et de Psychom\u00e9trie.\nSous l\u2019in\ufb02uence de m\u00e9thodes nouvelles, l\u2019unatomie et la physiologie du\nsyst\u00e8me nerveux se sont metamorphos\u00e9es. L'\u00e9tude des malades a permis\nd\u2019analyser bien des fonctions mentales. Les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes du somnambulisme\nnaturel et arti\ufb01ciel, ceux de la suggestion, de l\u2019\u00e9criture automatique, beaucoup\nde d\u00e9lires \u00e9tranges, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 une analyse minutieuse. Bien des cas\nsinguliers se rapportant aux ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes qui ont soulev\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me de la\nsuggestion mentale, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis avec pr\u00e9cision et jusqu'\u00e0. un certain\npoint interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s.\nOn est cependent forc\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre que ces \u00e9tudes sont rest\u00e9es sur\nbeaucoup de points bien incompl\u00e8tes. Elles sont loin d\u2019avoir donn\u00e9 les\nr\u00e9sultats pratiques que l\u2019on pouvait en esp\u00e9rer et n\u2019ont pu trancher d\u2019une\nmani\u00e8re suf\ufb01samment pr\u00e9cise dans un sens ou dans l\u2019autre les probl\u00e8mes qui\ninqui\u00e9taient les esprits. Une des raisons qui, en outre de la diff1cult\u00e9 des\nrecherches, a consid\u00e9rablement retard\u00e9 le progr\u00e8s des sciences psychologiques,\nc\u2019est que pendant longtemps on n\u2019a pas su\ufb02isalnment compris leur importance\net leur utilit\u00e9 et qu'elles sont loin d\u2019avoir rencontr\u00e9 partout l\u2019appui et les\nressources dont elles avaient besoin pour se d\u00e9velopper. D'innombrables\nlaboratoires et instituts de toutes sortes \u00e9taient ouverts aux savants qui\ns'occupaient de physique, de chimie, de sciences naturelles ; les laboratoires\nde psychologie tr\u00e8s peu nombreux, tr\u00e8s pauvres pour la plupart, surtout en\nFrance, ne pouvaient faire que quelques \u00e9tudes sur des points tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s.\nN\u2019est-il pas possible d\u2019obtenir pour ces sciences si utiles et si passion\nnantes un appui du public \u00e9clair\u00e9, qui n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 aux recherches\nd\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9es?

Kingsley. 279\nOBITUARY.\nMARY H. KINGSLEY.\nThe death of Miss Mary Kingsley, the African traveller, has called\nforth a wide recognition of her remarkable qualities both of character\nand of intellect ;\u2014of her courage, her unsel\ufb01shness, her endurance, and\nof the solid services which her collections and her writings have\nrendered both to natural science and to the sympathetic compre\nhension of the peoples of that Dark Continent where so much of her\nenergy was spent. Miss Kingsley was not a member of our Society ;\nbut her interest in primitive beliefs brought her into contact with\none side of our subject; and the striking paper on \u201cThe Forms of\nApparitions in West Africa,\u201d which she contributed to Part XXXV.\nof our Proceedings, will be fresh in the memory of those who read it,\u2014\nand especially of those who heard it. I believe that Miss Kingsley\nlooked quite simply and naturally at home among the \u201csquattering\ncrocodiles,\u201d and the \u201c soughing hippos,\u201d and the \u201cmiscellaneous\ndevils\u201d of the Ourounougou Swamp, \u201c which haunts me and calls me,\u201d\nshe said, \u201cmore than any other thing I have ever seen.\u201d\nBut personally I met her\u2014and preferred to meet her !\u2014amid less\nremarkable scenes ;\u2014sceneswhere her slender modest \ufb01gure,\u2014her gentle\nhumorous face,\u2014her quiet, old-fashioned dress,-all suggested a maiden\nlady from Cwmford ,-\u2014\u2014\u2014while, nevertheless, every now and then some\nthing in the tone of her words or the look of her eye \ufb02ashed through\nme the incongruous thought\u2014\u201c What a mate for a hero ! \u201d\nI should call Mary Kingsley and her uncle Charles the youngest\neminent persons whom I have ever met. Charles Kingsley\u2019s muscular\nChristianity struck Inc as a delightful kind of fourth-form swagger ;\u2014\nthe small boy\u2019s naif exultation in the glory of his great school. He\nseemed to look boisterously out over human history with shouts of\n\u201cWell done, our side!\u201d and he would talk of Christian saints and\nheroes in the half awe-struck, half familiar tone in which the schoolboy\ntalks of \u201cfellows in our Eleven.\u201d And Mary Kingsley, on her part,\nshowed already, as quite a little girl, exactly the qualities which after\nwards carried her so far ;\u2014playing at adventures with an in\ufb01nite\npower of make-believe ;\u2014laying mines in the back garden, or super\nintending her favourite \ufb01ghting cocks, whom she did not allow to\n\ufb01ght ;\u2014studying keenly in the midst of onerous domestic duties all\nsorts of out-of-the-way things ;\u2014and sallying forth alone into the\nworld when her turn came, with a mind bent upon fetish-worship\nand fresh-water \ufb01shes, but a heart liable to be diverted from any\nstudy by the sight of the unsuccoured woes of men.\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Jum, 1900.\nHere was a soul which showed that absolute sel\ufb02essness, unalter\nable serenity, indomitable daring, are no monopoly of apostle, or\ncrusader, or saint. Here was a delicate lady, with no mission and no\npretensions, who would simply go anywhere and do anything from\nsheer scienti\ufb01c ardour and human sympathy.\nHer earthly end be\ufb01tted her career : going out to Africa to collect\nher fresh-water \ufb01shes, and protesting that she did not know how to\nnurse, and would not think of nursing anybody,\u2014she was drawn into\nthat service by the desperate need of our wounded enemies ;\u2014and\ncaught the terrible fever ; and proceeded to the death-agony with her\nwonted bonhomie.\nDeath, as death, is surely the merest bugbear;'\u2014the young child\nmade portentous by ghastly trappings, as in Gareth and Lynette. If\nMary Kingsley, by sheer native courage, met the last fate with steady\nsoul, it would ill become those who believe that they have proof of\nhuman survival to weep and mourn for'her now. Rather is one\ndisposed to wave the hand to her cheerily across the narrowing\nabyss ;\u2014with the great words of Rabbi Ben Ezra sounding in the\ndeep of the heart\u2014\nAnd I shall thereupon\nTake rest, ere I be gone\nOnce more on my adventure brave and new ;\u2014\nFearless and unperplexed,\nWhen I wage battle next,\nWhat weapons to select, what armour to indue.\nF. W. H. M.\nCASES.\nM. Aut. 100.\nThe following case was sent to us a short time ago by Dr. H. D.\nR. Kingston, of Macra, Eltham, Kent, an Associate of the Society,\nwith the explanation that he had intended to send the papers at the\ntime he received them, but they had accidentally been mislaid, and\nonly quite lately come to light. Of the narrator, Mr. F. Hodgson,\nhe says :\u2014\nMr. F. Hodgson was then (1889) a photographer at Wynberg. He had\nat one time been employed as photographer to the Challenger expedition\nduring part of the voyage, and he had also gone in the same capacity with\nMr. Palgrave on a Commission to Great Namaqualand and to Damaraland.\nI have copies of many of the photographs he then took, the negatives of\nwhich are the property of the Colonial Government. I found him a careful\nand competent man in developmg some scienti\ufb01c photographs of my own,\n\fJuLY, 1900.] Cases. 281\nand also particularly intelligent, and I should say perfectly trustworthy as a\nwitness. You will see that he has made up the case with some care.\nHENRY D. R. KINGsToN, M.D.\nThe narrative was enclosed in a letter to Dr. Kingston, dated\nWynberg, July, 1890, and is as follows :\nStatement re curious manifestations in house of Mrs. Kamp, beginning on\nnight of June 14th, and still continuing, though greatly diminished in power.\nOn Saturday night, June 14th, 1890, Alida Sophia Kamp, widow,\nresiding in Wolfe Street, Wynberg, her daughter, Sophia Alida Kamp, and\nCatherine Mahoney, who resides in the same house, retired to rest at a little\nbefore eleven p.m., and, from the time of retiring to rest until that of\nrising, were unable to sleep on account of strange and unearthly noises, for\nwhich they could \ufb01nd no explanation, although they instituted a rigorous\nsearch for the cause. The noises, as they described them to me next morn\ning, resembled the dragging about of chairs in their bedrooms and the\ndragging about of heavy boxes over an uneven \ufb02oor in the loft over their\nheads. This loft, which I know, having been in it, contains absolutely\nnothing which could account for the noises, even had there been any one\nupstairs to drag anything it contained about, but owing to the way in which\nthis loft is fastened up, it would have been quite impossible for any one to\nenter it. I could not on the Sunday morning, from their description of\nwhat they had heard, \ufb01nd any rational solution of the mystery, and, at their\nrequest, consented to occupy one of the bedrooms that night (Smwlay, 15th).\nBefore retiring, however, I suggested that we should hold a s\u00e9ance in\nthe room in which I was about to sleep. This was agreed to, and we formed\na circle consisting of Christian Kamp (son of Alida Sophia Kamp), Alida\nSophia Kamp, Catherine Mahoney, and myself, and Janet Kamp, wife of\nChristian Kamp (seating ourselves around a small table). The table very\nshortly showed an inclination to move about, and in fact did sway about\nconsiderably, but this was all we could obtain, so we dropped the sitting.\nWe, however, decided after deliberation to hold a s\u00e9ance in the adjoin\ning bedroom, but this time Catherine Mahoney declined to sit, so that\nwe had only [four] out of the former [\ufb01ve] sitters. The results were, how\never, better, as we soon had distinct raps and at once asked the communi\ncating in\ufb02uence to rap three times if it could communicate its name to us if\nwe established an easy code. The three raps came at once, and I (who\nacted as conductor) then asked it to give one mp at each letter forming its\nname on my going audibly through the alphabet. The result was\nL E W I S , which caused Mrs. A. S. Kamp to think it was her departed\nhusband, whose name had been Louis. This hypothesis, however, I was not\ninclined to accept, as I thought her husband, if present, would not have\nwrongly spelt his name. We, however, could not get the in\ufb02uence to\nchange his orthography, so we had to proceed to ask if it would spell out\nany message by the same code, to which three raps responded, and we again\nproceeded. The result was T O W A R N, at which stage of the pro\nceedings Mrs. Kamp showed signs of great uneasiness, thinking the message\n\f282 Jowrnat of Society for Psycldcal Reseamclu [Juu,1900.\nwas a warning of her coming death, and being still persuaded that her late\nhusband was communicating. As I did not know positively to the contrary\nand was afraid some unpleasant communication was about to be given, we\ndropped the s\u00e9ance, I intending to resume it at some future time with sitters\nnot related to the family.\nShortly after we all retired to our beds, and I kept a candle burning in\nmy room until past midnight, as I had an interesting novel to read. I then\nblew it out and was asleep in a few minutes. Shortly after two a.m.\n(Monday) I was awakened by the sound of a chair being dragged over the\n\ufb02oor of the room in which I slept, followed almost immediately by a sound\nas of some very heavy body being dragged about in a room overhead (a very\nloud noise which would have awakened anybody). Miss Kamp then called\nout from the adjoining room, which was only divided from mine by awooden\npartition, \u201c Do you hear the noise? What can it be ? \u201d Just after she had\nspoken I heard a sound like a half full box of matches falling on the \ufb02oor.\nI decided it was about time to get up and investigate, so sprung out of bed\nand felt for the matchbox in the candlestick and [found] it was not there.\nI had carefully placed it there on going to bed and was at a loss to account\nfor its disappearance. I had some others, however, in the pocket of my\nwaistcoat, and knowing where I had hung this garment, I went to it and\ntaking the matches out of the pocket, struck a light and lighted the candle.\nI then found the other box of matches lying on the \ufb02oor about two feet\nfrom the candlestick. It seemed to me also that a chair in the room\noccupied a somewhat different position to what it had done when I fell\nasleep, but of this I could not be sure; but, to be sure whether it moved\nagain, I placed some empty scent bottles, which I found on a shelf, one\nagainst each leg of the chair. I then went to sleep again and on again\nwaking, found the chair had been moved quite four inches to the N. W., as\nall the legs were away from the bottles I had placed against them. Of\ncourse, as regards the falling of the matchbox and the actual change of\nposition of the chair, I can only give you my unsupported testimony, but\nthose who slept in the next room will be able to testify to having heard the\napparent moving of the chair in my room before they heard me jump up to\ninvestigate. This occurred on Sunday night, June 15th.\nNow comes the strangest part of the affair. Up to this time none of us\ncould make out why any one of the name of Lewis should disturb our rest,\nas none of us were or had been intimately acquainted with any one of that\nname, unless we were prepared to accept the very hypothetical idea that it\nwas the late Mr. Kamp, who had forgotten how to spell his name properly\n(a theory which would not have said much for the educational establish\nments of the shadowy land).\n0n Monday morning, June 16th, I got my copy of the Cape Times as\nusual, and, among other items of news found an account of the death of a\nman, NAME UNKNoWN, who had been killed by an engine, on the night of the\n14th, near Woodstock, at about 8.45 p.m. None of us at the time 1n\nany way connected this with the noises which had disturbed us, as there\nwas no apparent connection.\n\fJum\u2018, 1900.] Cctses. \u2018Z83\nIn Tuesday\u2019s issue of the same paper there was the account of the inquest\non this man (still name 1mknoirn). On Tuesday evening I was sitting in\nMrs. Kamp\u2019s shop, when a coloured woman came in and in the course of\nconversation said, \u201c Did Mrs. Kamp hear of the man that was killed on the\nrailway on Saturday night ? \u201d \u201cYes ! \u201d said Mrs. Kamp, \u201cI see they don\u2019t\nknow who he was.\u201d \u201c Oh, yes ! \u201d said the coloured woman, \u201c his name is\nJim Lewis. I know him, because he lived with my sister.\u201d This set us all\non a quite new track, and we began to wonder what connection there might\nbe between the events. In favour thereof the facts were these :\u2014\n1. This man had been killed at 8.45 p.m. on the night of the 14th.\n2.

Ant. 101.\nThe following account is translated and abridged from the Vessillo\nSpiritista for June, 1900, where it appeared under the title of \u201cA\nGood Proof of Spirit Identity.\u201d\nOn the evening of January 12th, 1900, during the usual weekly sitting,\nin the presence of Sig. G. V. de Simone, his wife and two young daughters,\nC. Orsini and the present writer, a good proof of identity which had been\nasked for was received from the spirit of Arturo de Capua. It had been\nasked for under conditions which excluded every possibility of voluntary\nor involuntary, conscious or unconscious suggestion, as it was impossible\nthat what was unknown and always had been unknown to all present should\nbe suggested, and this makes it of more value than a volunteered proof,\nWhich might have been prepared beforehand by the medium.\nThis spirit of Arturo has given in many sittings many moral and intel\nlectual proofs of his personality which were recognised by his mother and\nbrother Avo. G-. de Capua. The Neapolitan verses which he improvised\n(and I say improvised, because the suggestion was made at the moment),\nwritten with extreme rapidity through the medium Signorina 0. de S.,\nresemble closely in form and matter those written by him during his life on\nearth.\nProofs of this sort, however, although perhaps convincing to those\npresent, are of little value to strangers, who want records of facts which\nexclude any such hypothesis as telepathy or self-suggestion on the part of\nthe medium. Therefore on this evening I asked the spirit of Arturo if he\nhad any precise recollections of his earthly existence and if he could give\nme some fact, of his own choice.\nHe answered me by automatic writing thus :\u2014\u201c My dear Oavalli, I have\nit is true, advanced; but I recognise you, in a state of calm which I have\nacquired and which formerly I did not possess; as for my remembrances, know\n\fJCLY, 1900.] Cases. 285\nthat not only does it give me great fatigue to recall them. but it also causes\nme great pain ; and it is for this reason that I rarely seek to revive them.\u201d\nThen I replied that I did not wish to cause him pain, and would content\nmyself with asking him to give the names he remembered of his dearest\nfriends.\nNone of those present had known Arturo when living, much less the\npe1sons or names of persons with whom he was acquainted. So this would\nbe a good proof. The spirit willingly assented. After a short time he wrote\nwith his accustomed rapidity :\u2014\u201cEmilia, Paolo, Elena, Annina, and the\nlady who gave me the cigarette and whose name I cannot recall. Those are\nthe people of whom I was very fond, after my intimate friends, and who are\nstill dear to me.\u201d \u201cSo far good, but the best part is still wanting,\u201d\u2014I\nobserved,-\u2014-\u201cthe surnames. Do you remember them?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cCan\nyou and will you give them?\u201d \u201c I cannot.\u201d \u201c At least tell me if the four\nnames have different surnames.\u201d He answered that the two \ufb01rst had\ndifferent surnames, and the two last the same. Immediately afterwards he\nexpressed a desire to write again and wrote, \u201cI add to these Carlo Ricci,\nwhom I still love so much; do not be so exacting, do you understand?\"\nThe spirit insisted that all this was correct and expressed anger when I\ndoubted it.\nAs soon as I saw his brother, Guglielmo, I showed him the communica\ntions. They were all absolutely correct, the names given, and the lady of\nthe cigarette, but Carlo Ricci struck him above everything ! \u201c He was\nArturo\u2019s dearest friend,\u201d his brother told me.\nAlthough older than Arturo, Carlo Ricci and his father had always had\nthe greatest consideration for him, and Arturo was devoted to them both and\npreferred their company to any other.\nArturo\u2019s mother, whom I also questioned, con\ufb01rmed everything that her\nson Guglielmo had said.\nBut to return to the communication given by the spirit of Arturo on the\nevening of the l2th ;\u2014we can add another valuable particular. He gave the\nnames of four persons, as we have said ; among these was one Paolo. When\nasked about him at a following sitting he answered by automatic writing :\n\u201c Paolo is the father of the lovely Nanninella.\u201d This was correct, and\nwhen asked for some further particulars of the lady who gave him the\ncigarettes, \u2014amongst other things, whether there were dear friends of the\nlady's living in the same place with her,\u2014he answered : \u201c The lady has dear\nfriends near her and they are of my family.\u201d Both these facts had been\nabsolutely correct at the time of his death. But the interesting point is\nthis,\u2014that when asked to name friends living in the same place as the lady,\nhe named his family. Those present at the sitting and all who knew\nArturo\u2019s family, knew that for some months they had changed their home.\nThe spirit, however, apparently judging from the past, did not think of\ntheir present changed habitation and concluded that they were still living\nnear the lady.

PIPER\u2019S PRESENT TRANCE CONDITION.\nThe following account of the present conditions of Mrs. Piper\u2019s\ntrance was addressed by Dr. Hodgson to Dr. G. Stanley Hall, Editor\nof The American Journal of Psychology, and appeared in that\nperiodical for April, 1900. We reprint it here for our own readers,\npartly on account of its intrinsic interest, and partly because it serves\nto explain why Dr. Hodgson has not thought it desirable at present\nto prepare another Report on the subject, since that published by him\nin February, 1898.\nThe following letter, written without thought of publication, is printed\nby the author\u2019s permission. It was the second addressed to the editor in\nresponse to a second urgent letter from him requesting a sitting with Mrs.\nPiper. It is printed here with the thought that it may interest and inform\nother psychologists who may seek interviews.\nBoston, Mass., February 24th, 1900.\nDEAR DR. HALL, \u2014In reply to your further letter of February 23rd, I fear\nthat my previous letter, perhaps owing to its brevity, did not su\ufb02iciently\nexplain the situation as regards Mrs. Piper. I shall describe it in further\ndetail as it purports to be from the point of view of the communicators\nthrough Mrs. Piper\u2019s trance.\nIn the attempt to get proof of personal identity from the Rev. W.\nStainton Moses, who died in 1893, I came into relation with certain\nintelligences that claimed to have been the chief spirit instructors of\nStainton Moses for some years during his life time, and whom he called by\nthe names Imperator, Doctor, Rector, etc. Imperator was alleged to be the\nleader and general supervisor in connection with the supernormal experi\nences of Stainton Moses, accounts of which will be found in the Proceedings\nS.P.R., Parts XXV. and XXVII. Imperator, communicating through\nMrs. Piper\u2019s trance, very soon claimed and assumed the supervision of the\ntrances. I de\ufb01nitely agreed to this supervision. For a number of years\nprior to this time I practically made such arrangements as I pleased as\nregards the introduction of fresh persons to sittings with Mrs. Piper.\nImperator stated that it was impossible that the best work could be achieved\nfrom their side under such conditions, that Mrs. Piper\u2019s organism regarded\nas a machine had been \u201c battered and worn,\u201d that it needed much repairing,\nthat the utmost care must be taken as regards the persons introduced on the\nearthly side, and the persons allowed to use the machine from the so-called\n\fJuLY, 1900.] Mrs. Pz'per\u2019s present Townce Condition. 287\nspirit side. For the purpose of securing proper conditions, Imperator\nclaimed that they on their side could alone decide what persons should be\nallowed to communicate, as they alone could determine what conditions\nmight be bene\ufb01cial to, and what injurious to the machine. General\nexperimenting by persons on this side was prohibited. Opportunities\nhave been given for the introduction of fresh persons to the trance. These,\nhowever, have been few in number. The introduction of fresh persons at\nthe present time has been absolutely prohibited. Imperator has stated\nthat the conditions are such that it would interfere with the work which\nthey have to do in improving the machine and in other matters if fresh\nsitters were now introduced. All this has been explicitly laid down without\nany doubt, and I am bound by my agreement.\nThis Imperator r\u00e9gime began at the latter part of January. 1897, and I\nrefer you to section 7 of my report in Part XXXIII. of our Proceedings,\nentitled \u201c Recent Changes in Mrs. Piper\u2019s Trance,\u201d pp. 407-12.\nDuring my year\u2019s absence in England, from September, 1897, to\nSeptember, 1898, various fresh persons were allowed to have sittings\nbesides a group of persons who were previously familiar with Mrs. Piper\u2019s\ntrance. Later on, however, after my return here, a much closer restriction\nwas exercised by Imperator. Only about half a dozen fresh persons were\nallowed to go at all during last season, and at the present time no fresh\npersons are allowed to be introduced.\nI have had, I think, hundreds of applicants for sittings during the past\nyear. I have had four new applications besides your own this week.\nSeveral persons have had the opportunity of having sittings about once a\nfortnight, and Mrs. Piper goes into trance now usually only three times a\nweek. It is probable that later on even this small group of persons will\nbe restricted.\nBrie\ufb02y, once more then, the situation is that the matter at present is out\nof my direct control. I have agreed, so to speak, to let Imperator manage\nthe machine. Absolutely explicit instructions have been laid down by\nImperator that no persons shall be admitted to the sittings except as\nappointed by him. It is not likely that any fresh persons will be allowed to\nhave sittings in the future at any time, except such as are in special grief for\nthe recent loss of near friends or relatives.\nAs to the general wisdom of this management by Imperator, I have\nmyself personally no doubt. It would, however, take me too long to explain\nmy view of the situation at length in a letter. I refer you again to section 7\nof my report in Part XXXIII. for some suggestions in this direction, which\nI expect to work out more fully in later reports.\nFrom my own point of view, Mrs. Piper\u2019s organism as a medium of\ncommunication from the other side to this represents an extremely delicate\nmachine, which is likely to get out of order unless the utmost care is taken\nas regards the conditions. This is not realised by the ordinary person ; and\nyet we know well that even in cases which are probably enormously less\ncomplex, absolute exclusion is necessary. There are, e.g., machines used in\nphysical experiments which are isolated in such a way that observers are not\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

And yet\npersons who are completely ignorant of the conditions, both general and\nspecial, under which the communications through Mrs. Piper come, actually\nfeel aggrieved that they cannot in succession try their apprentice hands and\nthe apprentice hands of their spirit friends at the working of such a com\nplicated and delicate machine as Mrs. Piper\u2019s organism.\u2014Yours sincerely,\nR. HonosoN.\nCORRE SPONDENCE.\n[The Editor is not responsible for opinions ea;pressed by Correspondents.]\nThe following letter has been received from an Associate of the\nSociety, Miss H. A. Dallas, in reference to the paper read at the\nGeneral Meeting on June 22nd and reported above.\nPsEuDo-PosSESsIoN.\n(To the Editor of the JoURNAL oF THE SoCIETY Foe PsYCHICAL REsEARCH.)\nNo one who listened carefully to Mr. Myers\u2019s paper on \u201cPseudo\nPossession,\u201d and who has given thought to it since, can have failed to be\nimpressed by a sense of its value, and its profound suggestiveness and\nsigni\ufb01cance. There is one question which arose out of it and which I\nshould like to have asked, but with so many present whose ideas were so\nwell worth hearing, one grudged to occupy time with a question of more\nelementary character. Perhaps I may be allowed to state it in the pages of\nthe Journal, in the hope of eliciting some reply.\nOn the hypothesis that many forms of automatism claiming spiritistic\norigin (including M\\\\e Smith\u2019s) emanate from the subliminal consciousness,\nwe \ufb01nd ourselves confronted by an unexplained anomaly. Mr. Myers\u2019s\nremarks lead us to the conclusion (which we know is amply justi\ufb01ed by\nevidence) that the mediumistic faculty is a healthy faculty of high order;\nand that the subliminal self is in contact with a wider \ufb01eld of knowledge\nthan is the supraliminal ; that it seems to be capable of forming clearer and\ncorrecter judgments than does the latter; so much is this the case that I\nbelieve medical diagnoses and prescriptions given in trance have been\naccepted and found correct.\nBut if I understand our President aright, he also attributes to this\nsubliminal self the statements concerning the Martian language, concerning\nprevious incarnations as Marie Antoinette, etc., and also presumably, the\nassertions so generally made in automatic script claiming that it origmates\nwith discarnate entities. Are we then to believe that the subliminal self is\nboth wiser and more foolish, truer and more false, more understanding and\nmore ignorant, more reliable and more untrustworthy than the normal self ?\nThe mere statement of the question turns one mentally a little giddy, so that\none feels in danger of losing one\u2019s bearings, and not knowing which way one\nis facing ; but that may be due to weakness of head.\nThe spirit hypothesis offers di\ufb02iculties too, but not quite of this bewilder\ning nature. On the spirit hypothesis we may presumably regard the\n\fJum, 1900.] Correspondence. 289\nmedium\u2019s organism as comparable to a piano at the disposal of any performer\nwho can unlock and manipulate it. I say unlock and manipulate, because\nthe organism is by no means free to all comers, and the limitations which\nrestrict its use are probably of more than one kind.\nIf the medium\u2019s organism is thus, within certain limits, freely accessible,\nthere would be nothing surprising in the fact that the operations of the\ncontrol should at one time result in messages above the normal capacities\nand moral character of the medium, and at another in messages below both.\nSecret aspirations, lofty ambitions and admirations would give access to\nspirits of superior quality, and latent weaknesses might render him acces\nsible to the in\ufb02uence and suggestions of those of inferior attainments,\nmental and moral.\nThe advantage of this hypothesis is that it is simple (too simple, some\nmay think) and that it presents no inexplicable anomalies. What explana\ntion can be offered of the seeming anomaly which confronts us with the\nother hypothesis? Perhaps it exists only in seeming and may be cleared\nby a few words. H A DALLAs\n[In reply to the above, Mr. Myers writes :\u2014]\nTHE RANGE oF THE SUBLIMINAL.\nThe dif\ufb01culty which Miss Dallas\u2019s letter points out is a very real one;\nand although her questions can, I think, be in some measure answered, the\nanswer cannot be as short or as simple as I could wish.\nI must begin by pointing out that the distinction between supraliminal\nand sublimiIial,-\u2014between intra-marginal and extra- marginal ;\u2014in short\nbetween the thoughts and sensations which fall within our ordinary waking\nconsciousness and those which \ufb01nd place beneath or outside it,\u2014cannot\npossibly be a distinction at once applicable to practical ends ;\u2014as though\n(for instance) one were able to say at once that the subliminal idea or\nimpulse was always wiser than the supraliminal. On the contrary, the basis\nof the distinction is a purely psychological one: it is founded on the attempt\nto analyse the relation of one chain of memory to another chain of memory,\nof one type to another type of human perception and faculty. Our simplest\nobservation indeed must be that that which extends beneath the threshold,\nbeyond the margin of a \ufb01eld of consciousness specialised for our ordinary\nneeds, will probably be both more extensive and more miscellaneous than\nthat which is contained within those limits. The spectrum of our subliminal\nmentation, (to recur to an old metaphor,) is more extended than the\nspectrum of our supraliminal. At one end of the scale we \ufb01nd dreams,\u2014a\nnormal subliminal product, but of less practical value than any form of sane\nsupraliminal thought. At the other end of the scale we \ufb01nd that the rarest,\nmost precious knowledge comes to us from outside the ordinary \ufb01eld,\u2014\nthrough the eminently subliminal processes of telepathy, telaesthesia, ecstasy.\nAnd between these two extremes lie many subliminal products, varying in\nvalue according to the dignity and trustworthiness of the subliminal menta\ntion concerned.\n\f290_ Journal of Society for Psychical Resea\/rch. [Jun, 1900.\nThis last phrase,\u2014inevitably obscure,\u2014may be illustrated by reference\nto that hierarchical arrangement of supraliminal action and perception\nwhich Dr. Hughlings Jackson has so used as to clear up much previous\nconfusion of thought. Following him, we now speak of highest-level nerve\ncentres, governing our highest, most complex, thought and will ; of middle\nlevel centres, governing movements of voluntary muscles, and the like; and\nof lowest-level centres (which from my point of view are purely subliminal),\ngoverning those automatic processes, as respiration and circulation, which\nare independent of conscious rule, but necessary to the maintenance of life.\nWe can roughly judge from the nature of any observed action whether the\nhighest-level centres are directing it, or whether they are for the time\ninhibited, so that middle-level centres operate uncontrolled.\nThus ordinary speech and writing are ruled by highest-level centres.\nBut when an epileptic discharge of nervous energy has exhausted the\nhighest-level centres, we see the middle-level centres operating unchecked,\nand producing the convulsive movements of arms and legs in the \u201c \ufb01t.\u201d As\nthese centres in their turn become exhausted, the patient is left to the\nguidance of lowest-level centres alone ;\u2014that is to say, he becomes comatose,\nthough he continues to breathe as regularly as usual.\nNow this series of phenomena,\u2014descending in coherence and co-ordina\ntion from an active consensus of the whole organism to a mere automatic\nmaintenance of its most stably organised processes,\u2014may be pretty closely\nparalleled by the series of subliminal phenomena also.\nSometimes we seem to see our subliminal perceptions and faculties acting\ntruly in unity, truly as a Self ;\u2014coordinated into some harmonious \u201cinspira\ntion of genius,\u201d or some profound and reasonable hypnotic self-reformation,\nor some far-reaching supernormal achievement of clairvoyant vision or of\nself-projection into a spiritual world. Whatever of subliminal personality\nis thus acting corresponds with the highest-level centres of supraliminal life.\nAt such moments the subliminal represents (as I believe) most nearly what\nwill become the surviving Self.\nBut it seems that this degree of clarity, of integration, cannot be long\npreserved. Much oftener we \ufb01nd the subliminal perceptions and faculties\nacting in less co-ordinated, less coherent ways. We have products which,\nwhile containing traces of some faculty beyond our common scope, involve,\nnevertheless, something as random and meaningless as the discharge of the\nuncontrolled middle-level centres of arms and legs in the epileptic \ufb01t. We\nget, in short, a series of phenomena which the term dream-like seems best to\ndescribe.\nIn the realm of genius,\u2014of uprushes of thought and feeling fused\nbeneath the conscious threshold into artistic shape,\u2014we get no longer\nmaster-pieces but half-insanities,~not the Sistine Madonna but Wiertz's\nVision of the Guillotined Head ;\u2014not Kubla Khan, but the disordered\nopium dream. Throughout all the work of William Blake (I should say) we\nsee the subliminal self \ufb02ashing for moments into unity, then smouldering\nagain in a lurid and scattered glow.\nIn the realm of hypnotism, again, we sink from the reasonable self\nsuggestion to the \u201cplatform-experiment,\u201d\u2014the smelling of ammonia, the\n\fJuLY, 1900.] Correspondence. 291\neating of tallow-candles ;\u2014all the tricks which show a profound control, but\nnot a wise control, over the arcana of organic life. I speak, of course, of the\nsubject\u2019s own control over his organism; for in the last resort it is he and\nnot his hypnotiser who really exercises that directive power. And I com\npare these tricks of middle-level subliminal centres to the powerful yet\nirrational control which the middle-level centres ruling the epileptic\u2019s arms\nand legs exercise over his muscles in the violence of the epileptic attack.\nAnd so again with the automatisms which are, one may say, the subliminal\nself \u2019s peculiar province. Automatic script, for instance, may represent\nhighest-level subliminal centres, even when no extraneous spirit, but the\nautomatist\u2019s own mind alone, is concerned. It will then give us true tele\npathic messages, or perhaps messages of high moral import, surpassing the\nautomatist\u2019s conscious powers. But much oftener the automatic script is\nregulated by what I have called middle-level subliminal centres only ;\u2014and\nthen, though we may have scraps of supernormal intelligence, we have con\nfusion and incoherence as well. We have the falsity which the disgusted\nautomatist is sometimes fain to ascribe to a devil ;\u2014though it is in reality not\na devil, but a dream.\nAnd hence again, just as the epileptic sinks lower and lower in the \ufb01t,\u2014\nfrom the incoordinated movements of the limbs down to the mere stertorous\nbreathing of coma,\u2014so do these incoherent automatisms sink down at last\nthrough mere fragmentary dreams, or vague impersonal bewilderment, into\nthe minimum psychical concomitant, whatever that be, which must co-exist\nwith brain-circulation.\nSuch is the apparent parallelism ; but of course no knowledge of a\nhierarchy of the familiar forms of nervous action can really explain to us the\nmysterious \ufb02uctuations of subliminal power. When we speak of the highest\nlevel and other centres which govern our supraliminal being, and which are\n\ufb01tted to direct this planetary life in a material world,\u2014we can to some\nextent point out actual brain-centres whose action enables us to meet those\nneeds. What are the needs of our cosmic life we do not know ; nor can we\nindicate any point in our organism (as in the \u201csolar plexus,\u201d or the like),\nwhich is adapted to meet them. We cannot even either a\ufb02irm or deny that\nsuch spiritual life as we maintain while incarnated in this material envelope\ninvolves any physical concomitants at all.\nFor my part, I feel forced to fall back upon the old-world conception of\na soul which exercises an imperfect and \ufb02uctuating control over the organ\nism ; and exercises that control, I would add, along two main channels, only\npartly coincident ;\u2014that of ordinary consciousness, adapted to the main\ntenance and guidance of earth-life; and that of subliminal consciousness,\nadapted to the maintenance of our larger spiritual life during our con\ufb01ne\nment in the \ufb02esh.\nWe men, therefore, clausi tenebris et carcere coeco, can sometimes widen,\nas we must sometimes narrow, our outlook on the reality of things. In\nmania or epilepsy we lose control even of those highest-level supraliminal\ncentres on which our rational earth-life depends. But through automatism\nand in trance and allied states we draw into supraliminal life some rivulet\n\f292 Journal of Society for Peychz'cul Re.\u00bb-earcl1.. [Jur1, 190\u00bb.\nT.=?_,,.._~, . ._\nfrom the undercurrent stream. If the subliminal centres which we thus\nimpress into our waking service correspond to the middle-level only, they\nmay bring to us merely error and confusion; if they correspond to the\nhighest-level, they may introduce us to previously unimagined truth.\nAnd \ufb01nally, though this be explaining obscumm per obscm'ius,\u2014I think\nthat we can trace the same \ufb02uctuation in a spirit\u2019s control of an organism\nwhen that spirit is no longer that organism\u2019s habitual denizen, but an invader\nfrom without. Observing the trances of Mrs. Piper or of Mrs. Thompson\n(of which latter lady I hope shortly to offer some account to our Society), I\nseem sometimes to see highest-level centres kept in operation by a clear\ncontrolling power. Sometimes that control weakens, and one must watch\nthe spiritual grasp slipping downwards to middle-level centres alone. Then\ncomes the dream-like incoherence of speech, the inchoate or meaningless\ngesture. When \u201c Phinuit,\u201d or whoever the \u201c control\" may be, sinks into\nnonsense; when the sensitive's own ideas interfere with the utterance; when\nthe inspired vision or message degener-ates into grotesque triviality ;\u2014in\nall such cases we are experiencing the operation of middle-level subliminal\ncentres ;\u2014whether those centres be set in motion by our own or by some\nextraneous spirit.\nFrom all this it follows that there is and can be no infallible criterion by\nwhich we can guess what intimations are wisest, what internal or external\npromptings we had best obey. Nay, we cannot even feel sure that there\nexists only one true solution of any complex problem of our life. We do\nnot know whether all even of our sanest and clearest impulses are directed\ntowards the same end. The objects of the subliminal may legitimately\ndilfer from the objects of the supraliminal self. I am not here speaking of\nthe two con\ufb02icting wills in man, \u2014\u2014the one making for immediate pleasure,\nthe other for a more distant and truer good. I say that the intimate dissi\ndence may be on a higher level still. Man is even now living in two worlds;\nand who shall atlirm that either his supraliminal or his subliminal intelli\ngence can always reconcile the earthly with the spiritual ideal?

F. W. H. MYERs, in the chair.\nTHE PREsIDENT read a paper on \u201cTrance-utterance and other\nPhenomena observed with Mrs. Thompson,\u201d giving a general account\nof her trances, with a few illustrations of information given at\nsittings, the full reports of some of which we hope to publish shortly.\nDR. R. HonGsoN said that he had not yet had any sittings with\nMrs. Thompson, and could not speak of their evidential value from the\npoint of view of personal experience. He had, however, had the oppor\ntunity of reading over a large number of records of her manifestations,\nand had been impressed especially by what seemed to be the later\ndevelopments of her trance phenomena, though he had not been able\nto study the records in detail. The earlier phenomena of Mrs.\nThompson, chie\ufb02y physical, had not been performed under very\nstringent conditions, according to the accounts which appeared in Light,\nbut the records of her later trances suggested resemblances to Mrs.\nPiper\u2019s phenomena as they were some years ago under the re'gime of\nthe control known as Phinuit. The speaker then proceeded to\nenumerate several points, general and special, in which the utterances\nof \u201cNelly,\u201d the control of Mrs. Thompson, seemed to resemble those\nof Phinuit. The information supplied to the sitter was apt to be given\nsomewhat fragmentarily; it concerned both living and deceased persons ;\nit tended, perhaps, to prove the existence of supernormal faculty of some\nkind; but there was lacking the clearer evidence for the personal\nidentity of a speci\ufb01c communicating friend or relative of the sitter.\n\f0012, 1900.] General Meeting. 295\nThere seemed, however, to be more of this \u201c personal identity\u201d quality\nin a few of the most recent sittings, and he hoped that there might be\na rapid development of Mrs. Thompson\u2019s phenomena along this line.\nAccording to the records, Mrs. Thompson had experiences of several\ntypes which had never been exhibited by Mrs. Piper. Mrs. Piper had\nno experiences in her ordinary waking state, obtained no manifestations\nof the ordinary \u201cphysical phenomena\u201d type, and recollected no\nexperiences of her own during the trance state. Passing over Mrs.\nThompson\u2019s experiences on these lines, and taking the records of her\nordinary trance utterances, it seemed that there were occasional com\nplete failures with sitters, there was often a mixture of correct and\nincorrect statement, and there were apparently statements which\nsuggested disturbances by previous communicators; analogous cases\nwere found in the records of Mrs. Piper\u2019s earlier trances. The speaker\ngave speci\ufb01c instances of the di\ufb02iculty in getting proper names, and in\nascertaining the precise source of apparently supernormal information,\nas where knowledge seemed to be shown of events occurring elsewhere\nat the time of the sitting,\u2014mentioning cases from the records of Mrs.\nThompson in connection with cases which had come under his own\nexperience with Mrs. Piper. He referred also to some statements that\nhe had noticed in the records of Mrs. Thompson as made by the control\n\u201cNelly\u201d concerning her own use of the left side of Mrs. Thompson\u2019s\nbrain, and the use by other controls of the right side of the medium\u2019s\nbrain. He thought it was desirable to keep in mind that in connection\nwith trance manifestations generally, problems of the utmost import\nance arose from an empirical point of view concerning the relations\nbetween mind and body, and entirely independent of such questions\nas that of a future life or the spiritistic hypothesis. The primary con\nsideration for us was to understand more of the conditions of such trance\nmanifestations, to ascertain more de\ufb01nitely the causes of incoherence\nand obscurity and failure, and, as far as possible, to remove them.\nMR. ST. GEoRGE LANE Fox PITT said that the evidences of super\nnormal agencies shown by the phenomena of Mrs. Piper, Mrs.\nThompson, and others seemed to be absolutely overwhelming, and the\ninvestigations of Mr. Myers and Dr. Hodgson were of great interest\nand value; but he urged that the use made by them of the \u201cSpirit\nhypothesis \u201d was unfortunate, inasmuch as it offered no real explanation\nof the phenomena, while, on the contrary, it might tend to prejudice\nscienti\ufb01c inquiry by shirking di\ufb02iculties instead of explaining them.\nIt was as though, in answer to a question as to how something was\nproduced, we were told that it was \u201cmade by machinery.\u201d This kind\nof answer, although it might satisfy the average mind, was, of course,\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [0cT..1900.\nno explanation at all. The use of words and phrases to cover our\nignorance of the modus operandi of phenomena was a danger against\nwhich we ought to be constantly on our guard. It should be born in\nmind, too, that \u201ctelepathy,\u201d \u201c clairvoyance,\u201d \u201c the subliminal con\nsciousness,\u201d and \u201c spirits\u201d were not of necessity mutually exclusive\ntheories ; but were merely indicative of certain aspects of the phenomena,\nor the psychic processes that were involved in them. Thus it might be\nthat the agencies underlying the phenomena might include all these ;\nand that the \u201cintelligences\u201d manifesting might be the outcome of a com\nbination of psychic in\ufb02uences, just as were the creatures of our dreams.\nThe fact that they appeared to have an independent existence beyond\nthe limits of certain conditions was no proof of such independence.\nIn spite of Mr. Myers\u2019 voluminous and lucid expositions of the\nsubject, the idea of a subliminal consciousness or mind was usually quite\nmisunderstood, for it was really a most complex and comprehensive\nidea. Broadly it might be said to include that over-shadowing destiny\nof the individual with all its immense rami\ufb01cations and a\ufb02inities, as\nwell as that mere fragment of its potentiality which happened to come\nunder observation on some particular occasion. One function of the\nsubliminal mind was comparable to that of a reservoir for the conscious\nself,\u2014to take in and give out memories and in\ufb02uences, increasing the\nresources and preventing waste of mental e\ufb02'ort. Now the derangement\nof this function might well account for many of the eccentricities and\ncontradictions of its manifestations.\nMR. OoLLINGWooD said that according to certain physiological\ninvestigations in connection with localisation of functions in the brain,\nthe centres for language were located in the left hemisphere of the\nbrain in the third frontal convolution, and it might be interesting\nto inquire what occurred when the alleged control was using the right\nhemisphere only.\nOne or two other questions were asked, and the President read a\nbrief account of another sitting with Mrs. Thompson.\nThe meeting then adjourned.\nTHE INTERNATIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL INSTITUTE AT\nTHE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF PSYCHOLOGY.\nParis, August, 1900.\nBY OswAw MURRAY.\nDR. OCHoRowwz delivered an address at the third meeting of the\nCongress, on the International Psychical Institute, the foundation of\n\f001, 1900.] The International Psychological Institute. 297\nwhich was noticed in a previous number of this Journal. Dr.\nOchorowicz gave a rapid sketch of the growth of psychology during\nthe last century and referred to several abortive efforts that had been\nmade on different occasions to establish a centre for comparative study\nin the several branches of this science The only successful achieve\nment in this direction consisted in the International Congresses that\nhad been held, at the fourth of which he was then speaking. These\nCongresses only met, however, at intervals of four years, and during\nthe intervening period no permanent centre existed where the\ncollective work which constituted so valuable a feature of the\nCongresses could be carried on. Dr. Ochorowicz then referred to the\nInstitute which had been recently founded in Paris for the purpose of\neeting this requirement and of facilitating research in the several\nranches of experimental psychology. This Institute already had the\nsupport of most of the leading psychologists and philosophers of\nFrance, as also of several other countries. He urged the members of\nthe Congress to give their support to this movement.\nPRoFEssoR RICHET supported the appeal made by Dr. Ochorowicz\nin an eloquent speech, in which he urged the members of the Congress\nto give their support to the Institute, to make its foundation known in\nall the countries they represented on their return to their respective\nhomes, and to endeavour to obtain adherents to it.\nPRoFRssoR SEAILLEs dwelt on the utility of the project from the\npoint of view of speculative philosophy.\nPRoFEssoR FLoURNoY stated that, being looked upon as an \u201c of\ufb01cial\nscientist,\u201d students often came to him with the request that he would\nexpress an opinion with regard to problems pertaining to the domain of\nthe \u201csupernormal.\u201d It would be unscienti\ufb01c for any man to express\nan opinion under such circumstances with regard to phenomena of that\nnature which he had not had an opportunity of examining. \u201c We\nwant opportunities of research,\u201d said Professor Flournoy. \u201c Experi\nmental observation should be facilitated. Our ignorance of to-day\nmight then become replaced by some degree of knowledge.\u201d\nMR. F. W. H. MYERs remarked that the S.P.R. already aimed at\nbeing international in its humble way, but that in the things of the\nmind it was desirable that everybody should be as international as\npossible, and he heartily wished success to the new venture.\nThe Committee of the Institute held a reception the same evening\nin the rooms of its temporary o\ufb02ices. Over two hundred members of\nthe Congress attended, and the object and aims of the Institute were\nfurther discussed.\n\f298 Journal of Society for Peg\/chical Research. [OcT.,1900.\nA meeting of the International Council and the executive\ncommittee was held subsequently.\nIt was decided to alter the title of the Institute to \u201c the Inter\nnational Psychological Institute,\u201d in order to meet the views of many\nmembers of the Congress, expressed during the discussion of the address\nby Dr. Ochorowicz and subsequently at the reception.\nIt was also decided to undertake no experimental work and not to\npublish a journal till a fund commensurate with the importance and\ninternational character of the enterprise had been raised.\nCASES.\nG. 242 (continued). Apparition.\nReaders of the Journal may remember an account given by Miss\nM. W. Scott, of Lessudden House, St. Boswell\u2019s, Roxburghshire, of an\napparition seen several times by herself, and occasionally by others, on\na country road near her home. (See the Journal S.P.R. for November,\n1893 ,- Vol. VI., p. 146.) Her \ufb01rst experience was in May, 1892, when,\nwalking down a short incline on her way home, she saw a tall man\ndressed in black a few yards in front of her. He turned a corner of\nthe road, being still in view of her, and there suddenly disappeared.\nOn following him round the corner, Miss Scott found a sister of hers,\nalso on her way home, who had just seen a tall man dressed in black,\nwhom she took for a clergyman, coming to meet her on the road. She\nlooked away for a moment, and on looking towards him again could\nsee no one anywhere near. Miss Scott on overtaking her found her\nlooking up and down the road and into the \ufb01elds in much bewilder\nment. It appeared that they had not seen the man at exactly the\nsame moment nor in exactly the same place, but from their description\nof the surroundings it seems impossible that it could have been a real\nperson, who had contrived to get away unnoticed.\nIn July of the same year at about the same place, Miss Scott\nwalking with another of her sisters saw approaching them a dark\n\ufb01gure dressed in black, with a long coat, gaiters and knee-breeches, a\nwide white cravat and low-crowned hat ; the sister also saw the upper\npart of the \ufb01gure, which seemed to fade away into the bank by the\nside of the road as they looked at it.\nAgain, in June, 1893, walking alone on the road in the morning,\nMiss Scott saw a dark \ufb01gure some way in front, which she recognised\nas the apparition when she got nearer to it. She made a de\ntermined e\ufb02'ort to overtake it, but could not get nearer than a few\nyards, as it then seemed to \ufb02oat or skim away. At length, however,\n\fOcT., 1900.] Cases. 299\nit stopped, turned round and faced her ; then moved on a few steps,\nand turned and looked back again, \ufb01nally fading from her view by 'a\nhedge. She was able to notice fully the details of the dress,\u2014knee\nbreeches, black silk stockings and shoe-buckles,\u2014like the dress of\nScottish clergymen about a century ago.\nThe apparition was also said to have been seen at different times by\nsome children and other persons in the neighbourhood; but of this\nno \ufb01rst-hand accounts were forthcoming. There was also a legend\nthat a child had been murdered close by; \u201cbut,\u201d Miss Scott wrote,\n\u201cthis fact is quite beyond the recollection of the oldest inhabitant of\nthe neighbourhood,\u201d and it seems not unlikely that it was invented to\naccount for the ghost.\nSince the narrative was printed we have received several other\naccounts of a similar apparition having been seen by various persons\nat different times in the same place ; and we now give all the further\nevidence on the subject that has so far reached us.\nThe \ufb01rst account is given in a letter from Miss Louisa Scott\u2014the\nsister who shared Miss M. W. Scott\u2019s \ufb01rst experience\u2014to Miss Guthrie,\nthe lady through whose kindness we received the original narrative in\n1893. This letter is as follows :\u2014\nLessudden House, St. Boswell\u2019s, August 14th, 1894.\nDEAR MIss GUTHRm,\u2014As Iknow you are interested in the movements\nof our ghost, I am writing to tell you another little anecdote about him.\nA young lady, who is a governess in this neighbourhood, told me this after\nnoon of a meeting she had had with him this spring. She was returning home\nalong the haunted road at about a quarter past four in the afternoon, when\nshe was attracted by seeing in front of her a rather tall old man, dressed in a\nlong black cloak, with one cape which came to a little below his shoulders ;\nhis hat, as on the occasions when my sisters and I saw him, was low-crowned,\nand the brim slouched over his eyes. My informant was much interested in\nthis peculiar-looking person, and did not take her eyes off him, whilst she\nwatched him walk backward and forward between the turn of the road and\na heap of stones about a hundred yards lower down; he repeated this six\ntimes, the last time stopping as if he were speaking to a man who was cutting\nthe hedge at the time. What struck Miss Irvine as peculiar was that the\nman who was hedge-cutting did not look round, and seemed quite unconscious\nof the other\u2019s presence. Miss Irvine walked on, and was going to pass the\nold man, when, to her astonishment, he vanished when she was only about\nthree yards from him.\nI know that you will think it foolish of Miss Irvine not questioning the\nhedger to whom the apparition looked as if he were speaking. I asked her\nwhy she had not, and she answered that she had not liked doing so, as the\nlabourer would undoubtedly have thought her mad, as he clearly did not see\nany one.\n\f300 Jowrnal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1900.\nI am sure you will think this story most interesting, knowing all our\nexperiences in days gone by. The extraordinary part of this man is that he\nalways frequents the same part of the road, and yet does not vanish twice\non the same spot ; when my sister and I saw him he became invisible on the\nleft side of the road, and when Miss Irvine saw him he vanished on the\nright. Miss Irvine is most positive about all she told us, and says she will\nbe delighted to send her account to Mr. Myers.\nI do wish we could see \u201cour man\u201d again. I have passed along that road\nhundreds of times since he was \ufb01rst seen, and at all hours of the day. I think\nhe cannot have liked the way I stared at him the last time. Another thing\nwe think funny is the variety of coats which he seems to possess, and all of\nan antique cut. He has the long black cloak with the cape in which Miss\nIrvine saw him, and the clerical-looking cloak with the large deep pockets in\nwhich we met him ; then on the other occasion, when the village girls saw\nhim, he had round him the \ufb01lmy-looking sheet. My sister has written to\nSir George Douglas to ask him if he can tell her the exact spot on this road\nwhere an old man was murdered by gipsies coming from St. Boswell\u2019s fair\nmany years ago. Sir George Douglas tells his story among a number of\nother old border tales, which no doubt you have read. I hope some day to\nbe able to tell you more about the ghost. At present I am afraid he is\nunderground. With kind regards, yours sincerely,\nLoUIsA SCoTT.\nIn reply to our inquiries, Miss Irvine sent soon after her own\naccount of her experience. By an unfortunate accident, the \ufb01rst sheet\nof her letter was lost and has not been recovered ; but we print here\nthedatter part, which gives some of the details at \ufb01rst-hand.\nGreycrook, St. Boswell\u2019s, Roxburghshire.\nThis seemed to me stranger than ever and I wondered what I had seen,\nfor he was nowhere in the \ufb01eld. On returning home I described the old\ngentleman to some friends who were likely to know if a person answering\nmy description lived in the neighbourhood, but was told, \u201cNo.\u201d He was\ndressed rather like a clergyman, wore a long black cloak with cape and\nslouched hat, his hands in his coat pockets. I had never seen anything of\nthe kind before, though I had frequently walked the same road and at all\nhours. This happened about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I have not\nagain seen him.\nMARY BLAMIRE IRvINE.\nIn August, 1898, Miss M. W. Scott wrote to Mr. Myers as\nfollows :\u2014\n. Our apparition . . . is still seen . . . My latest\nexperience was about a fortnight ago, when coming down the haunted\nroad in the dusk I distinctly heard footsteps walking beside me, but\ncould see nothing, though I am sure there must have been an unseen\npresence around from the state of nervous terTor which generally makes\nitself felt on such occasions.\n\fOCr., 1900.] Cases. 301\nLast autumn, and again in the dusk, I was walking down the little wood\nadjacent to the road with my sister. We were both talking upon indifferent\nsubjects and putting the ghost as far from our thoughts as possible, when\nsuddenly I was carried spell-bound by distinctly seeing the apparition\nwalking alongside of us on the other side of the hedge. My sister saw me\ngazing vacantly on space when I suddenly exclaimed \u201c The man!\u201d When we\ncame to the gate which divides the wood from the road there was no one to\nto be seen either way, though \u201c he \u201d had walked within three feet of me the\nwhole time; he was invisible to my sister. It is a strange phenomenon\naltogether. He had the same countenance we have always seen, but I did\nnot seem to have the power to look beyond his face. This ghost always\nappears when our thoughts are bound up in something else, but if the\nopposite, then we are sure not to see him, and many persons who have\naccompanied up [and] down the road in hopes of seeing him have, like our\nselves, failed to do so. . . . M W SCoTT\nIn answer to inquiries made later, Miss Scott writes .\nLessudden House, St. Boswell\u2019s, N.B.,\nOctober 16th, 1899.\nIn reply to your \ufb01rst question, it was my second sister Susan,\n(the one who had only seen the apparition in a vague way before) who was\nwith me in the autumn of 1897. In this instance we both saw it distinctly,\nas also did a lady friend who was further down the road at the same time. I\nsent an account of this before, so doubtless you will have seen the\nparticulars.\nAbout the other question ; my sister Louisa and myself positively affirm\nthat we were both looking at the same object ; it was perfectly visible to me\nat the very moment that it was invisible to her, and standing only a few\nyards distant; it was bright daylight, I think between \ufb01ve and six on a\nMay afternoon. and the road perfectly clear and dry. At the place where we\nsaw the man, no one could possibly escape without our perceiving it, except\nby supernatural ways. There were two gates further down ; had he been a\nreal man he must have passed where my sister was, as no one would ever\nthink of attempting to jump over the hedges ; they were both far too high.\nA Miss Irvine, once a resident in St. Boswell\u2019s but now married, sent an\nexperience she had with this same ghost to Mr. Myers, and was so much\nupset by the incident that she went into the house not far off and took\nhysterics. Her story varied a little from ours in point of detail as regarded\ncostume ; still I believe we all saw one and the same person. This ghost is\nnow well authenticated and our friends often greet us with the question,\n\u201c Well, have you seen the man lately ? \u201d To this I can only add in conclusion\nthat none of my family have seen him for some time. . .\nM. W. SCoTT.\nIn later letters, Miss Scott says that she thinks she was mistaken\nabout the date of the \ufb01rst occasion mentioned above, when she and her\nsister Susan and another lady saw the apparition, as on making further\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1900.\ninquiries from her sisters, it appeared that neither of them had seen it\nsince 1893. Not having kept any notes of the accounts which she\nsent to us, her recollections of the di\ufb01'erent occasions had\u2014not\nunnaturally\u2014become a little confused; and it seems likely that this\nwas the occasion, previously described, of July, 1892. The other\nwitness was an old lady, who was a long way down the road, and who\ndeclared in December, 1899, that she certainly remembered having\nseen a dark \ufb01gure in the distance between them and herself. She was\ntoo far off to distinguish it clearly, but took it for a woman dressed in\nblack going to the churchyard. She promised Miss Scott to write her\nrecollections, but owing to illness and troubles in her family, has\nhitherto been unable to attend to the matter.\nThere appears to be another legend of a murder in the neighbour\nhood, which, however, there were no grounds for connecting in any way\nwith the apparition, and it was also said that a clergyman of the parish\n\u2014since dead\u2014had \u201c seen something.\u201d Miss Scott afterwards met one\nof his daughters, but could only learn that he had objected on con\nscientious grounds to speaking of his experience.\nIn December, 1899, Miss Scott sent the following fuller account of\nthe second incident described in the letter given above, when she was\naccompanied by her sister Louisa. Here again her recollection of the\ndates seems to vary ; but the main features of the two accounts\ncorrespond closely, except that in the \ufb01rst she says that it was bright\ndaylight and in the second that it was beginning to be dusk.\n. . Our experiences [of 1892 and 1893], after having become the\ntalk of the town and a nine days\u2019 wonder, gradually subsided, and, per\nsonally, we had no further manifestations till the spring (April, I think)\nof 1897. My sister and myself were paying an afternoon visit at a friend\u2019s\nhouse situated near the haunted road, and having rather overstayed our\ntime, the dusk was just beginning to fall over the landscape around; it\nbeing then suggested that we should take a shorter out home, we gladly\navailed ourselves of the permission to walk through the park and wood\nwhich open out of and enter the evil-reputed road. Upon coming to the end\nof the park, there is a small gate and narrow pathway, separated from the\nroad by a hedge and some trees ; the space between being only a few yards,\na pedestrian on the other side is distinctly visible. At the other end of the\nwood, again, there is another gate, which [leads to] the small incline and\nangle of the road, and, looking either way, the whole expanse is clearly\nde\ufb01ned. Just about this time we had nothing supernatural in our thoughts.\nand were talking and laughing gaily together. Suddenly by some magnetic\nin\ufb02uence our conversation seemed gradually to cease, for when we were\nquite half-way down the wood, I noticed a man\u2019s \ufb01gure walking alongside\nof me between the hedge on the other side, which, either real or unreal,\nI was determined not to lose sight of. As though cast over by a spell\n\fOcT., 1900.] Cases. 303\nmy gaze became \ufb01xed, as in a moment I recognised the ghastly features\nof the apparition. I cannot tell how he was clothed, or if he wore a hat;\nmy eyes seemed \ufb01xed only on the pro\ufb01le from just below the forehead.\nInstinctively I felt he moved beside me, but heard no sound or footsteps of\nany kind. My sister saw nothing, and not being equal to the occasion,\nI made no remark, until we had almost reached the end of the boundary,\nthen exclaimed in French, \u201cL\u2019homme!\u201d At that moment the ghost must have\nvanished, for when we opened the gate to pass through, not a living soul was\nthere ; had it been a person of either sex, we were perfectly certain to have\nmet. It was very strange my companion should perceive nothing unusual,\nthough she remarked about me \u201c staring into space.\" It is quite impossible\nto account for this phantom\u2014it is no illusion formed by a disordered brain\nor based upon imagination or defective light ; the sun had certainly set, the\ndusk slightly fallen, but giving quite sufficient power for mutual recognitions.\nThe man had walked calmly on, looking straight in front of him, never\nappearing to notice anything, as though engaged in deep meditation.\nThe remainder of the account describes again in fuller detail Miss\nScott's hearing the footsteps walking beside her on the road, when\nshe could see no one there, as described in her letter of August, 1898.\nShe gives also a'rough plan of the locality (see below, p. 305).\nOn August 17th, 1900, Miss Scott wrote to say that she had\nrecently seen the apparition twice, the most recent occasion having\nbeen \u201conly last night.\u201d She describes it as follows :\u2014\nJuly 24th, 1900.\u2014I am writing to let you know the dates that I have\nagain seen the apparition that haunts a road near St. Boswell\u2019s. The locality\nhas been described before, so that it is not necessary for me to enter into\nfurther details regarding it. On the evening of July 24th I was standing\nspeaking to a friend, exactly upon the part known as the property of that\n\u201c mysterious he.\u201d I had forgotten the very existence of our supernatural\nneighbour, and while we conversed upon indilferent subjects, I inadvertently\nglanced carelessly down the expanse beyond, when I perceived the tall black\n\ufb01gure walking on in advance with his back towards us. How he came to be\nthere I had not the faintest idea, not having remarked his advent. I made\nno comment to my companion, but, wishing her a hasty adieu, hurried away\nas quickly as possible to try and make up upon him, but he instantly\nvanished ;\u2014there was no one to be seen either high or low. It was just\neight o\u2019clock in the evening, as I heard the hour chime in the village\nalmost at the same time. He was dressed in the same way, namely, all in\nblack, and was only proceeding about twenty yards away.\nI have not since ascertained if my companion at the moment saw any one,\nas she is an unbeliever in such manifestations, and says it is all imagination,\nand often laughed me to scorn when I said anything about the ghost on the\nroad ; but, believing or not believing, it is certainly an unpleasant sensation\nto see a long \ufb01gure clothed in sable raiment appear and so quickly vanish\nagain without any apparent reason on a lonely thoroughfare.\n\f.304 Journal of Society for Psych\/icat Research. [0cT., 1900.\nMy second illustration of last night, August 16th, 1900, can tell you\nsomething more de\ufb01nite than the previous one, for I certainly believe the\nman to be a clergyman of the ancient school, but why this \u201cFather of the\nChurch\u201d frequents that road is an unexplained mystery. On this occasion\nthe outline of his head and shoulders were completely visible\u2014all black,\nwith a wide white muf\ufb02er-looking thing wound round his throat; his hair\nseems light, face clean-shaven and very pale, but he was not quite near\nenough for the features to become clearly de\ufb01ned; the hat looked like an\nordinary clerical wide-awake, only the crown seemed much higher than those\nused in the present day. The lower part of his body [was] overshadowed,\nas he was advancing towards me up the incline, while I was on the level\nabove.\nThere was a man with a pony and trap cutting grass by the roadside\nwithin a few feet of where I saw the apparition appear, who had his back to\nthe worker ; yet, the most wonderful part of it all is that when I questioned\nthe man, he declared he had seen \u201c no one.\u201d \u201c But,\u201d I said, \u201c he was close\nbeside you.\u201d He still declared he saw \u201cno person there,\u201d so I let the\nmatter end, though I expect that he, like the whole village, knows well the\nreputation of the road, for he looked slightly nervous and remarked \u201cit\nwas not a safe place to come down alone.\u201d\nThis completes the tale of my latest encounter .\nM. W. SCoTT.\nThe following letter gives some further details of this last occasion,\nin answer to questions :\u2014\nAugust 26th, 1900.\n. Last evening I went down the road with my two sisters and some\nfriends, but the \u201c ghost \u201d did not make his presence apparent ; neither did\nhe upon our return ; so I had time to make a few more de\ufb01nite observations\nwhich will form the answer to your question. The apparition and I were\nwalking towards one another. I was too much taken up watching the\nproceedings of the supernatural to notice the operations of the working man,\nuntil the vision of the other had died away, when I then turned my atten\ntion to the real subject, who was then facing the road and actually looking at\nthe place where the spectre had disappeared a few seconds before. The\npony and trap had evidently moved on a little from the part where the owner\nwas occupied and afterwards stood still; the movements of all being such\nthat the entire expanse beyond was an unobstructed view to any person\ncoming or going upon it ; thus, the animal was really nearest the apparition,\nwhose back was close to its head as he advanced. It may only have been a\ncoincidence, but the pony gave itself a violent shake in its harness just at\nthe time. Horses have been known to exhibit signs of fear on such\noccasions, but as they frequently go through such antics for other causes,\nthis fact can be no criterion for judging the point.\nIf you are in possession of the letter written to Mr. Myers by a Miss\nIrvine, Who used to live in St. Boswell\u2019s a few years ago, you will remark\nthat this incident is almost on a parallel with her account of seeing the\napparition standing beside the man cutting hedges, yet, when questioned, he\n\fFmm\u2018Wm 908\nswno\nLane\nFields\nPhth\nFields\nFields\nFields\nPLAN\noF\nLoCALITY.\nL\n2,\n3,\nrespective\npositions\nof\nMiss\nM.\n\\V.\nScott,\nMiss\nL.\nScott,\nand\nthe\napparition\nin\n1897.\nThe\nother\n\ufb01gures\nrefer\nto\nthe\npositions\non\nAugust\n16th,\n1900.\n4,\nMiss\nScott;\n5,\nthe\napparition,\nits\nhead\nand\nshouldeIs\nappearing\nabove\nthe\nincline;\n6,\nman\non\nroad\n;\n7,\nhis\npony\nand\ntrap;\n8\nand\n9,\ngates\ninto\nthe\n\ufb01elds\non\neither\nside.\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

M. W. SCon.\nThe accompanying rough plan is a combination of two sent by\nMiss Scott to show the localities where she and her sister saw the\napparition in 1897 and where she alone saw it in August, 1900. From\nthe house at which they were calling in 1897, a footpath leads through\nthe park and wood, the part through the latter having a gate at each\nend as shown, and passing out into the \u201chaunted road.\u201d This part of\nthe road is an incline, the arrow in the plan pointing up the slope.\nOut of the road opens a lane, in which the child is said to have been\nmurdered by gipsies. The \ufb01elds on each side of the road are bordered\nby high hedges. The numbers on the plan show the positions of the\nvarious persons as explained underneath it.\nL. 1121. Ad P\" Apparition.\nThe following account was sent to us by an Associate of the Society,\nMr. W. B. Fotheringham, of 19,' St. John\u2019s-road, Westcliffe-on-Sea,\nEssex. It will be seen that the case is not \ufb01rst-hand, and cannot now\nbe improved on, since the percipient\u2014Mr. Phillips\u2014is no longer\nliving. But it is an instance of what was called in Phantasms of the\nLiving, \u201cthe sort of second-hand evidence which can on the whole be\nplaced on a par with \ufb01rst-hand,\u201d\u2014the evidence, namely, of a person\nwho knew of the experience of the percipient while the latter was still\nunaware of the corresponding event, and had had equal opportunities\nwith the percipient for learning the truth of that event and con\ufb01rming\nthe coincidence.\nIt is remarkable that few or no narratives of apparitions seen at\nthe time of death have reached us during the last few years. This can\nhardly be because the incidents no longer occur ;\u2014it seems probable,\ntherefore, that our members are under the impression that we have\npublished enough evidence of the kind, and do not care to have any\nmore of it. This, however, is very far from being the case ; it is, on\nthe contrary, highly desirable to keep up a constant supply of such\nevidence, so long as it is well authenticated, and especially when it\nrelates to recent occurrences. It is partly in the hope of impressing\nthis on our readers that we print the narrative sent by Mr. Fothering\nham. He writes :\n19, St. John\u2019s-road, Westcliffe-on-Sea, July 24th, 1900.\nI do not know that the enclosed statement has any evidential value, but\nam sending it to you for what it is worth. Mrs. Phillips is a sister of my\n\fOcr., 1900.] Cases. 307\nhousekeeper, and, as the latter has been with me more than fourteen years,\nI know the family very well, and can vouch for their being entirely trust\nworthy. Still, with the most reliable of witnesses, it is, of course,\nnecessary to make some allowance for possible errors of memory.\nAlthough Mrs. Phillips has not been able to recall the exact date at'\nwhich this occurrence took place, she is con\ufb01dent that the month was either\nApril or May, and she believes that the time of day was early in the after\nnoon. At all events she is quite sure the apparition was seen in broad\ndayhght W. B. FoTHERINGHAM.\nThe statement enclosed is as follows :\u2014\nJuly 20th, 1900.\nThe following occurrence took place about three years ago, but it has\nnot been possible to \ufb01x the date with greater precision. Mr. Phillips, the\nimmediate percipient, has since died, but I have received the statement\npersonally from Mrs. Phillips who, it will be clear from the circumstances\nattending the case, knew of the apparition at the time of its appearance and\nbefore there could have been any knowledge of the actual death.\nMrs. Robotham and her husband had lodged for four years with Mr. and\nMrs. Phillips at their house, No. 4, Underhill Street, Camden Town, which\nthey had occupied for more than forty years, and which is still tenanted by\nMrs. Phillips. Mrs. Robotham was, consequently, particularly well known\nto Mr. and Mrs. P., who were the less likely to be mistaken in her identity.\nSome three years before her death, Mrs. Robotham and her husband left the\nhouse of Mr. and Mrs. P. and took rooms elsewhere, but the intimacy\nbetween the parties still continued, Mrs. Robotham frequently coming into\nthe shop kept by her former landlord. Finally, upon one occasion\nMrs. Robotham called at the shop to say good-bye, her husband having\nobtained work in the country and wishing her to go to him. She was seen\nupon that occasion by Mrs. Phillips, who says she then looked very ill, and\nseemed quite un\ufb01t to travel.\nAbout a fortnight later, Mr. Phillips was at work in his shop, being\nat the time alone, when, happening to look up, he distinctly saw the face of\nMrs. Robotham, who seemed to be standing outside in the passage and\nlooking round the edge of the door. The face disappeared almost imme\ndiately, but Mrs. Phillips says that her husband was absolutely convinced\nthat Mrs. Robotham had actually been there. To put it as nearly as\npossible in her own words :\u2014\n\u201c He (Mr. Phillips) came out and asked me whether Mrs. Robotham had\n~' come into the kitchen, as she had just looked into the shop and gone away\nagain. I said I had not seen her, and that he must certainly be mistaken,\nas we knew she had gone away into the country. He was quite positive,\nhowever, that she had looked into the shop, and said he was certain he could\nnot have been mistaken. So sure was he that he went to the street door and\nlooked up and down the street in the full expectation of seeing her some\nwhere about. I asked him how she was dressed and he said, \u2018Like she\nalways is\u2014in her black bonnet.\u2019 He had only seen the head and face. We\n\f308 Jolu\/rnal of Society for Psychical Research. [OCT., 1900.\nwaited several hours, expecting her to come back. When we found she did\nnot do so, I said to Mr. Phillips that if he had really seen her it must have\nbeen her spirit and she must certainly be dead, as I knew she would never\ncome to Camden Town without coming to see me.\n\u201cAbout a week afterwards Mr. Robotham came into the shop. I saw\nthat he was in mourning, and at once said, \u2018You need not tell us. We\nknew a week ago that Mrs. Robotham was dead. We saw her spirit.\u2019 Mr.\nRobotham told us when his wife had died, and we reckoned that we had seen\nher on the same day or the day after.\u201d\nI have read the above statement, and certify it to be in every way correct.\n(Signed) M.

The\nelection of seven new Associates of the American Branch was recorded.\nNames and addresses are given above.\nUnder a deep sense of the loss which the Society has sustained, the\nCouncil recorded the death of Professor Henry Sidgwick, who \ufb01lled\nthe o\ufb02ice of President from the formation of the Society in 1882 to\n1884, and again from 1888 to 1892. A letter was read from Professor\nOliver J. Lodge, in which he said :\u2014\u201c It must be a universal feeling\namong the active members of the S.P.R. that it is impossible adequately\nto express our indebtedness to the extraordinary wisdom and guiding\npower of Henry Sidgwick.\u201d Professor Lodge proceeded to urge that\nMr. Myers be asked to prepare a commemorative address to be de\nlivered at an early meeting of the Society. In pursuance of the\ngeneral view expressed by Professor Lodge in his letter, it was\nresolved, on the proposition of Sir William Crookes, seconded by Dr.\nHodgson, that the Council invite the President to deliver a commemo\nrative address at the Meeting to be held on October 29th. The Presi\ndent expressed his willingness to carry out the wishes of the Council.\nThe Council also recorded with regret the death of Viscount\nEncombe, of the Rev. B. J. Clarke, S.J., and of Mrs. Bullock, all of\nwhom had been Associates of the Society for some years.\nSome presents to the Library were on the table, for which a vote of\nthanks was passed to the donors.\nVarious other matters having engaged the attention of the Council,\nit was agreed that the next meeting be at 3 p.m., on Monday, October\n29th, at the Westminster Town Hall, previous to the General Meeting\narranged for that day.\n\u00aebituarg.\nTHE MARQUIS OF BUTE, K.T.

Some will miss in more intimate fashion the massive simplicity\nof his presence ;-the look in his eyes of trustfulness at once and\ntenacity ;\u2014that look which we call doglike, when we mean to imply\nthat dogs are nobler than men. The youth whose vast wealth and\neager religion suggested (it was said) to Lord Beacons\ufb01eld the idea of\nhis Lotha\/ir had become constantly wealthier and more religious as\nyears went on. Amid the palaces of his structure and of his inherit\nance he lived a life simple and almost solitary; a life of long walks\nand long conversations on the mysteries of the world unseen. To a\nfervent Roman Catholicism he joined a ready openness to the elements\nof a more Catholic faith. That same yearning for communion with\nthe invisible which showed itself in his Prayer-books and Missals, his\nByzantine Churches restored, his English Churches built, showed itself\nalso in the great crystal hung in his chapel at St. John\u2019s Lodge ;\u2014as it\nwere the mystic focus of that green silence in the heart of London\u2019s\nroar ;\u2014and in the horoscope of his nativity painted on the dome of his\nstudy at Mount Stuart ;\u2014and in that vaster, strange-illumined vault\nof Mount Stuart's central hall.\n[iv SE 1'1\u2018: relpca. 1rd1rra Ta 1'\u2019 obpavds e\u20190'1'6\u00a2civro1'aL.\u2014\nHardly had such a sight been seen since Hephaestus wrought in\n\ufb02aming gold the Signs of Heaven, and zoned the Shield of Achilles\nwith the \ufb01rmament and the sea. For in like manner at Lord Bute\u2019s\nbidding was that great vault encircled with a translucent zone which\npictured the constellations of the Ecliptic ;\u2014-the starry lights repre\nsented by prisms inserted in that \u201cdome of many-coloured glass.\u201d\nTherethrough, as through a \ufb01ctive Zodiac, travelled the sun all day ;\nwith many a counterchange of azure stains or emerald on the broad\n\ufb02oor below, and here and there the dazzling \ufb02ash of a sudden-kindled\nstar.

[Nov., 1900. _\nt_:==\u00a2____ \ufb01g :___ti 7 W >\nFIRE-WALKING CEREMONIES IN INDIA.\nMr. Andrew Lang\u2019s article on \u201cThe Fire Walk \u201d in Proceedings,\nPart XXXVI., pp. 2\u201415, will be fresh in the memory of our readers ;\nand since its publication we have received the following account of the\nsame ceremony in India from Mr. Henry K. Beauchamp, M.R.A.S.,\nF.R.H.S., Fellow of the University of Madras. Mr. Beauchamp lives\nin Madras, having edited the chief daily paper there\u2014the Madras\n1l[ail\u2014for the last twelve years.\nColonel Welsh, in his Reminiscences, published early in the present cen\ntury, has a long and detailed account of \ufb01re-walking as performed by the\nSepoys of his regiment. They passed safely over glowing ashes strewn in a\npit, and also carried their children across with them. One small child\nactually fell in amongst the ashes, but was quickly pulled out by his\nrelatives. When examined, it was found that the little fellow had sustained\nno injuries, nor did he give any evidence of suffering after his \ufb01re-bath.\nFire-walkers claim exemption from burning, and, as do all other miracle\nworkers in the East, claim to be able to perform their wonders through the\nsupernatural powers conferred on them on account of their merit. Such\nmerit is acquired and accumulated by multitudinous acts of self-denial, by\nfastings, pilgrimages and various religious ceremonies. Hence a \ufb01re-walker\nclaims exemption from burning not only for himself, but also for others by\nhis self-acquired, miraculous virtue, of which he has a su\ufb02icient stock for\nhimself and others.\nA curious fact about \ufb01re-walking in India is that it is countenanced and\nthought much of even amongst the higher castes of Hindus, whose attitude\ntowards rites of an extravagant and public nature, such as the hook-swinging\nand devil-dancing ceremonies of the South, is usually marked by a certain\nhaughty tolerance and studied aloofness. The particular \ufb01re-walking per\nformance which attracted so much attention in India some months ago took\nplace at the very hub of the Brahmin universe, in the Sacred City of Kasi,\nc'.e., Benares.* It was under the direct patronage, too, of Maharajah\nBahadur Sir Jotendro Mohan Tagore, K.C.S.I., a Brahmin of the Brahmins,\nwho traces his descent back for over 1,000 years to one of the \ufb01ve famous\nBrahmin prophets of Kanauj. It was in his palace that the Agni Yajua, as\nthe ceremony is called, took place, and a brilliant gathering was present,\nincluding a party of Europeans, who had been specially invited. From the\naccount given by one of the latter, it appears that the \ufb01re-pit was, as usual\nin India, an oblong trench about 27 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 4 feet deep\nnot a circular pit as in the Fiji ceremony. Furthermore, only about a-third\n* This appears to be the \ufb01rst of the three occasions described by Dr. Th. Pascal,\nunder the title of Les Domptcurs du Feu, in the Annalee des Sciences Psychiques for\nJuly\u2014August, 1899. The date of that occasion was October 26th, 1898; the two\nother cases described by Dr. Pascal occurred in the same place on December 7th,\n1898, and in February, 1899.\n\fNov.,1900.] Fire- Walking Ceremonies in India. 313\nof the entire length of the pit-\ufb02oor lay at the full depth of 4 feet, as the\nsides at the two extremities sloped gently inwards from the outside ground\nlevel in order to enable the \ufb01re-walker to enter and leave the pit glidingly\ninstead of plungingly.\nAnother marked difference between the Fijian and Indian paraphernalia\nis that in India no big stones are placed in the pit. The Hindu \ufb01re-walker\nmerely passes across incandescent cinders more or less quickly, and does not\nperambulate slowly and deliberately over big red-hot water-worn boulders,\nas the Fijian is described as doing. Indeed, as suggestive of the super\nnatural element the Indian ceremony does not bear comparison with the\nFijian, if the description of the latter can be implicitly trusted. At Benares\nthe actual length of the \ufb01re layer was not more than 10 feet ; its width was\nthe full width of the pit ; and, being very thin, its surface was quite 3\u00a7 feet\nbelow the outside ground-level. Shielded in this way from all currents of\nair, with no natural breeze or arti\ufb01cial draught to animate the embers, the\n\ufb01re is described as having become somewhat inert, though undoubtedly alive.\nMoreover the layer was nicely smoothed and then beaten down, so as to\npresent as clean and as \ufb01rm a surface as possible to the sole of the foot.\nThe \ufb01re-walking proper was preceded by an elaborate ritual of incanta\ntions and solemn pantomime, including sword brandishing, idol parading,\ncircuit processioning, incense scattering, cocoanut smashing, plume waving:\nall intended to subdue and render temporarily harmless the demon of the\n\ufb01re. Then, when all the grotesque rites had been \ufb01nished, the chief per\nformer, attired in gorgeous silks and a huge turban, and holding a sword\naloft, walked barefooted, calmly and with apparent ease, down the entrance\nslope, across the glowing \ufb02oor of the pit, and then up the exit slope. His\npace was quick and his step light, but it was a deliberate walk. '\nBut the interest of the Agni Yajna is not primarily in the immunity\nwhich the conjurer claims for himself, but in the immunity which he\nguarantees to any one following him through the \ufb01re\u2014pit. In the Benares\nperformance, according to the eye-witness\u2019s account, unfortunately not a\nsingle individual followed the leader at a walk. Each dark-skinned venturer\nbefore coming into contact with the \ufb01re, took pains to acquire a swift momen\ntum by dint of a \ufb02ying start down the sloping side : hence the run over the\nincandescent layer was the work of three seconds\u2014a mad rush. Each foot\ntouched the surface of the \ufb01re not more than three times; and when it is\nremembered that a running man moves on the ball of the foot, the extent\nand the duration of the actual \ufb01re contact may be easily judged. As a matter\nof fact, however\u2014hasty and light as the touch upon the red charcoal was\u2014\nnot every runner escaped quite unhurt, though it was, of course, impossible\nfor the scamperers\u2019 feet, with thick horny soles half insensible from lifelong\nwear on rough ground surfaces, to feel acute pain under such conditions. It\nwas noted also that the crowd was for the most part under the in\ufb02uence of\nreligious excitement, and runners were therefore in no frame of mind to\nnotice, or at any rate make a fuss about, small burns.\nAt last one or two of the European visitors expressed a desire of \u201ctrying\nit,\u201d but when at length, as soon as the general excitement had partially\n\f314 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1900.\nabated, they were able to make this wish known, they were greatly dis\nappointed to be informed that they were too late; the sacred in\ufb02uence having\nceased to be operative ! However, one gentleman, a Frenchman, labouring\nunder linguistic di\ufb02iculties, was somehow led to understand that the \ufb01re was\nstill ready to receive him, and baring his feet he quietly ran the gauntlet.\nIn the result he was burnt\u2014though not at all badly ; the duration of contact\nwas too momentary for that; but he promised himself some blisters next\nday. It was then apologetically explained to him that the magic in\ufb02uence\nlaud evaporated a quarter of an hour previously ; and \u201c walkers \u201d could no\n=longer enjoy immunity. Nevertheless. many natives, who had only just\nmanaged to elbow their way to the front, continued for quite ten minutes\nafterwards to run over the still incandescent charcoal\u2014with exactly the same\nresult to all appearances as when the magic in\ufb02uence was fully operative ;\nthat is to say, most of them showed no consciousness of pain, while a few\nwho put their feet down awkwardly while traversing the \ufb01re-zone sustained\nslight burns.\nThe eye-witness who testi\ufb01es to the above facts does not attempt to\nexplain or hazard conjectures upon the cause of the imnnmity from burning.\nOther eye-witnesses of similar ceremonies elsewhere in India have, however,\ngiven various possible explanations. Thus, an English Missionary who was\npresent at a similar ceremony in a village near Madras not long ago\u2014the\nobject of the ceremony in this case being to secure the favour of the village\ngoddess Varakhiyamman\u2014found that at each end of the trench there were\nsmall puddles of wet mud, which the devotees stepped into both before and\nafter cTossing the glowing embers. These opportune mud-puddles, and the\ndust round the \ufb01re-pit, to say nothing of the fact of the soles of their feet\nbeing as tough as leather, must have been some protection to the devotees in\ntheir short journey across the \ufb01re. Moreover, there were no \ufb02ames to scorch\nthe more tender skin of their legs; and no doubt, the excitement of the\noccasion, and their own professional pride, helped them to bear witho.ut\nwincing any burns that they might receive. That they did not feel pain was\nclear from the conduct of the leader, who, with a great sacri\ufb01cial jar balanced\non his head, went over thrice, as coolly and deliberately as though he was on\na made road.\nAnother explanation of the immunity from burning is that a decoction of\nthe Aloe -indica is used. It is said that the \ufb02eshy part of the leaves is taken\nand bruised and then squeezed through a piece of \ufb02annel. A glutinous juice\nis thus extracted not unlike castor oil in consistency. This is rubbed well\ninto the skin on the soles of the foot and the palms of the hands. The hair,\nbeard and eyebrows are also well saturated with it. After a careful and\nthorough anointing the devotee is able to pass over glowing embers\u2014there\nmust be no \ufb02ame\u2014and he will suffer no hurt. He is even able to drag a\nred-hot chain through his hands, to comb his hair and heard with a red-hot\nmetal comb, and take other liberties with the dreaded element which, under\nordinary circumstances, would assuredly cause his permanent injury. Those\nwho wish to \u201c pass through the \ufb01re \u201d under his protection are similarly pre\npared beforehand. He, of course, mutters mantras. or incantations, over them\n\fNov.,1900.] Fire- Walking Ceremonies in India. 315\nas he anoints them with the magical medicine, and they believe that highly\nin\ufb02ammable oil is under his divine in\ufb02uence able to render them \ufb01re-proof.\nI must leave it to my readers to choose which they like of these explana\ntions; and if they believe that none of them is satisfactory, to account for\nthe phenomenon in their own way, be it natural or supernatural.\nOn the night of Sunday, July 23rd, [1899] I was present myself at a \ufb01re\nwalking ceremony in connection with a small Hindu temple, dedicated to the\ngoddess Draupati, at St. Thomas\u2019 Mount, a Military Cantonment eight miles\nsouth of Madras. The scene of action was a large open piece of ground\nwithin a stone\u2019s throw of the Cantonment railway station. In the middle of\nthis open space there was a raised platform of earth, about 4 feet high and\nabout 12 yards square, which I learned had been erected many years ago for\nthe express purpose of the \ufb01re-walking ceremony, which takes place nearly\nevery year. The arrangements for the performance were extremely simple.\nA shallow trench had been dug at one end of the platform. In this a ton of\nwood and two cartloads of charcoal were burnt until the whole was one big\nmass of glowing embers. The embers were then raked out of the trench and\nspread evenly to a depth of 3 or 4 inches over a space, some 5 yards square,\nmarked out for that purpose in the centre of the platform. The trench, when\ncleared of the embers, was partially \ufb01lled with water, and all round the area\nof red-hot cinders water was sprinkled freely. Just when everything seemed\nready, the noise of the procession of the idols from the temple was heard,\nand soon the temple cars, with attendant priests and worshippers, were seen\nwending their way amidst the braying of brass instruments and the vivid\nglare of torches, across the railway line and through the dense crowd that\nsurrounded the platform. Arrived at the platform the cars were placed in a\nrow close alongside at the further end, where the \ufb01re trench had been dug.\nFrom here the idols, decked in gorgeous apparel, fanned by little acolytes,\nand surmounted by huge yellow and gold umbrellas, overlooked the whole\nscene of action. Then, when all the spectators were on the tiptoe of expecta\ntion, the pujari, or chief priest, after seeing that everything was in order,\nwalked through the glowing embers towards the idols in measured steps and\nquite calmly, dipping his feet in the water in the trench at the other side.\nAlmost immediately afterwards there was a stir on the outskirts of the\ndensely packed crowd beneath, and a way was cleared for a band of some\n50 devotees, who approached, chanting and shouting, up to the platform.\nThese men had all been preparing themselves for the ordeal for days before\nhand\u2014fasting and bathing and worshipping under the guidance of the priests\nof the Draupati temple. The light of religious fervour was in their eyes and\ntheir gestures and attitudes and cries all suggested the utmost nervous\nexcitement and enthusiasm. Ascending the platform by a ramp left for that\npurpose, they paused for a moment at the edge of the \ufb01re, and then, headed\nby the pujari, they surged into the embers, some walking slow and some\nfast, but none of them rushing through. At the farther side the \ufb01re-walkers\ndipped their feet in the trench and then put on new cloths which had been\nbrought for them by their relatives, who were waiting ready to receive them.\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 1900.\nThe \ufb01re-walkers were of all ages and several different castes. An interesting\nfeature of the performance was that a boy of about eight years also walked\nover the \ufb01re, while a still smaller child was hurried over, hanging on the\nhand of its father. A few other performers, too, carried children across on\ntheir shoulders. It was certainly a weird sight, and one that I shall never\nforget. I saw every single incident of the performance, for there was a full\nmoon at the time, and \ufb02aring torches also lit up the scene. I stood, too, on\na bench close to the ramp of the platform, above and not more than a few\nyards from the \ufb01re area itself. After the performance I went and stood over\nthe embers, and the heat was absolutely unbearable for more than a second\nor two. What struck me most was that the glowing embers were loose, not\nbeatened down or \ufb02attened in any way ; and the feet of the \ufb01re-walkers, as\nthey went through, actually sank into the bed of loose \ufb01re. This was par\nticularly noticeable in the case of the pujari during his \ufb01rst cahn and\ndeliberate passage. Neither he nor any of the devotees lifted their feet\nhigh : they seemed rather to wade through the \ufb01re, as through shallow water.\nI confess I was completely nonplussed ; for the theory that the protection is\ndue merely to the hardness of the soles of the devotees\u2019 feet was obviously\nuntenable under the circumstances.\nA few of those who took part in the ceremony were interviewed subse\nquently as to whether they felt any pain in walking over the \ufb01re, or whether\nthey protected their feet by rubbing them with any juice of plants, as\nasserted by some people. The suggestion was received with resentment and\nconsidered profane. One young man asked in astonishment what greater pro\ntection could be needed than the protection of the goddess. He explained,\nhowever, that the majority of the performers at the time of the actual \ufb01re\nwalking are beside themselves with religious fervour and feel absolutely no\nburning sensation while crossing the \ufb01re. In the fulness of their faith any\nmishap in the process is attributed by the devotees to their own frailties\nrather than to any want of saving power in the goddess, and they gave\ninstances of accidents in past years to peoplewho did not abide by all the\nrules necessary to be observed for a safe ful\ufb01lment of the vow.\nAn account of the Fire Walk at St. Thomas\u2019 Mount almost\nidentical with the above appeared in The Mission Field for February,\n1900, under the title of \u201cFire-Walking in Madras. By a Brahmin\nEye-witness.\u201d From a foot-note it appears that the account was\nreprinted from the Madras Mail of July 24th, 1899, of which paper,\nas already stated, Mr. Beauchamp has been Editor for many years.\nIn reply to inquiries about this account and the cases referred to at\nthe beginning of his own article, Mr. Beauchamp writes :\u2014\nTeignmouth, S. Devon, August 1st, 1900.\nMADAM,\u2014I have received your letter re my \ufb01re-walking experiences.\nThe date of the ceremony I witnessed was July 23rd, 1899.\nThe similarity between my paper and the account of the Brahmin arose\nin this way.

I enclose the full account that he sent me for the Madras\nIldail.\nI also send another account of another \ufb01re-walking ceremony near\nMadras, witnessed and described by the same Brahmin who described the\none at Alandur (St. Thomas\u2019 Mount).\nI may mention that my wife was with me at the ceremony; also Captain W.\nE. Norris (Suffolk Regt.), now secretary of the Madras Club, and Mrs. Norris.\nI shall be glad to answer any further questions you may wish to ask.\u2014\nYours truly\u2019 HENRY BEAUCrmMP.\nThe following is the missionary\u2019s account sent by Mr. Beauchamp :\nFrom certain paragraphs which have appeared in some of the papers in\nthe North-West Provinces, I see that the minds of some people have been\nnot a little exercised by the performance of some devotees, who not only\nwalked over \ufb01re themselves, but led some of the spectators to do the same.\nI cannot enter into the question of what really took place on that occasion,\nbecause there is a want of prosaic matter-of-fact about the accounts that I\nhave seen, and it is risky to criticise the statements of enthusiasts. But\neven the Madras Presidency has its \ufb01re-walkers, and not very many years\nago, nor very far from Madras, I saw a spectacle that was very interesting ;\nbut the onlookers discreetly took no part in the performance.\nIn a village called S\u00e9lei, in the Tiruvallur Taluq, or else at the next village\ncalled Dundkanpettei\u2014I forget at which of the two\u2014there was a little Saivite\ntemple that lacked name and fame, and it was to secure these and the favour\nof the goddess, Varakhiyamman, that the \ufb01re-festival was held. I remember\nriding over with the idea that I was about to see a palpable fraud, but just\noutside the village, by the temple, there was such a bon\ufb01re blazing, that it\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov., 190 .\nwas clear that there was to be very genuine \ufb01re. The hearth was a six-sided\nand shallow excavation, and seemed to be fourteen or sixteen feet across.\nWhen I reached it, about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon of a hot July day, a.\ngreat pile of logs was \ufb02aming in the centre of this pit. There was a long\ndelay before the ceremonial commenced, and we were told that the \ufb01re\nwalkers were preparing themselves for the ordeal. At last, about half-past\n\ufb01ve or six o\u2019clock, a procession emerged from the courts of the temple. This\nconsisted of the usual drums and clarionets and a most skilful dancer. This\nman poised a huge painted jar on his head, and danced backwards and\nforwards, whirled round on his toes, and even climbed on to the shoulders of\nhis attendants, keeping the great pot most beautifully balanced on his head\nall the time. Every moment it seemed as though a hasty movement must\nbring it to the ground with a crash, but the dancer\u2019s skill was perfect, and\nthe jar remained in equilibrium, no matter how his body swayed. This man\nwas supposed to be \ufb01lled with the spirit of the goddess, and the crowd was\nimmensely impressed. A priest of the temple then recited some long and\ntedious psalms in praise of the goddess, and besought her to protect her\ndevotees in the penance they were about to perform. The dancer with the\njar on his head never stopped at all.\nMeanwhile some of the temple servants had broken up the \ufb01re of logs,\nand spread the glowing ashes over the whole of the hearth, so that it looked\nlike a little lake of \ufb01re. Over this they scattered powdered charcoal, and.\nthen, taking the leaves of the palmyra for fans, they vigorously fanned the\nglowing surface till it quivered almost at white heat. Others poured jars of\nwater on the earth at each side of the hearth, so that on each side of the\nhearth there was a pool of wet mud. Then with a frantic blare of horns and\na great crash of music and drums, a new procession came from the little\nSaivite temple. This contained the man with the jar, who still poised it on\nhis head, several others dressed in the dirty salmon-coloured dress of the\nprofessed devotee, and the veiled image of the goddess riding on a car shaped\nlike a gri\ufb02in, and shaded by great scarlet umbrellas. This procession was\nthe one for which there had been so much waiting, and the crowd edged in\ntowards the hearth to get as clear a view as possible of what took place.\nThe devotees and the attendants of the goddess marched round the glowing\nhearth once, partly to allow the multitude to see them all, and partly, as I\nthought, that they might step in the mud puddles that had been so thought\nfully prepared. In this way a thin coat of mud formed on the soles of their\nfeet. Having completed their circuit of the \ufb01re, the whole party, including\nthe man with the jar, and the image of the goddess, rushed across the glow\ning surface, starting from the mud on one side, and landing in the mud on\nthe other. I noticed this, and I noticed, too, that they darted over as\nquickly as possible. Again they went round, and amid great enthusiam and\nimmense shouting from the excited crowd, and with the name of the goddess\non their lips, they \ufb02ed across a second and a third time, and then went back\nto the temple. As far as I could tell, none of them were hurt.\nNow, I do not think that there was any fraud or deception about what\nwas done; but on the other hand, there was not anything very wonderful\n\fNov., 1900.] Fire- Walking Ceremonies in India. 319\nabout it, and owing to the courtesy of a Hindu of\ufb01cial, I had a very good\nopportunity of seeing all that was to be seen. It is very unlikely that any\none of those who passed over the \ufb01re had ever worn shoes in his life. The\nsoles of their feet were as tough as leather. Moreover, their long journeys\non white dusty roads\u2014roads so hot under the Indian sun that a European\u2019s\nfoot would be blistered from toe to heel before he had walked a furlong on\nthem\u2014had necessarily deadened the sense of heat. And the opportune mud\npuddles, and the dust round the hearth, must have been some protection to\nthem in their short, very short, journey across the \ufb01re.\nWe give next the account of the Brahmin eye-witness, dated August\n21st, 1899.\n\u201cFIRE-WALKING\u201d AT PERALUR.\nLast evening another interesting \u201c \ufb01re-walking \u201d ceremony took place in\nthe village of Peralur, within a furlong of the Perambur Railway Workshop,\nthe goddess in whose honour the ceremony was observed being known as\nThanthoni Amman, the tutelary deity of the village of Peralur. Though, as\nwas recently explained by a Brahmin correspondent in these columns, \u201c \ufb01re\nwalking\u201d is generally held in honour of Draupati, still in several South\nIndian villages the saving power of the heroine of the Mahabharata is\nattributed by people also to their respective local goddesses, and \ufb01re-walking\nceremonies are held also in their honour periodically. Since the mytho\nlogical origin of these ceremonies has already been described in connection\nwith the ceremony held recently at Alandur, near St. Thomas\u2019 Mount, there\nis no need to repeat it here.\nThe \u201c \ufb01re-walking \u201d itself was done at Peralur in much the same manner\nas at Alanpur. A large piece of level ground opposite the Thanthoni Amman\ntemple was formed into an enclosure, in the middle of which a shallow pit\nnearly 16 feet square was dug. In the centre of this pit over three tons of\nfuel was formed into a heap and set \ufb01re to about 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nthe \ufb02ame being kept well fed from this hour till near the hour of the actual\nceremony. A Dubash of a leading \ufb01rm of European merchants in Madras\nprovided a ton of fuel for this ceremony, as a vow he had taken in the name\nof Thanthoni Amman was ful\ufb01lled to his entire satisfaction, through the\npower, he believes, of the goddess.\nFrom an early hour in the afternoon hundreds of village folk began to\ngather about the scene of the ceremony, and about 9 o\u2019clock the procession\nof the goddess, who was\u2018 seated on a grandly decorated conveyance, started\nfrom the temple to where the \ufb01re-walkers\u2014otherwise known as kumara\nmakkal\u2014were assembled, to conduct them to the \ufb01re pit. The party of\n\ufb01re-walkers, who, it must be remarked by the way, were in no sense \u201cpro\nfessionals,\u201d met the procession about half-way in advance and escorted the\ngoddess to the \ufb01re pit, accompanied by hundreds of villagers. A noteworthy\nfeature of last night\u2019s ceremony was that the party of \ufb01re-walkers included\namong them a product of modern English education. Mr. Rajagopal\nMoodelliar, who is well known as an excellent cricketer and tennis player in\nMadras, and who till recently was a teacher in Pachaiyappa\u2019s College, was\namong those who took part in the actual \ufb01re-walking. He was, as it were,\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychlca-l Research. [Nov., 1900.\nleader of the party and carried a koragam, or gorgeously decorated pot, over\nhis head. The procession \ufb01rst went round the enclosure and then entered\nit by an opening on the western side. The goddess, seated on the convey\nance and supported by a number of bearers, stood at the entrance, while the\n\ufb01re-walkers went round the pit to a spot just opposite the place where the\ngoddess was seated. From there they entered the pit, which had by this\ntime been well \ufb01lled with the glowing cinders evenly spread over it about\nthree inches deep, and walked over them to the other side, where, however,\nunlike at Alandur, there was no puddle of water to wet their feet in. They\nagain went round to the other side, walking over the ordinary ground by the\nside, and crossed the \ufb01re pit again. They repeated this for a third time,\nafter which the goddess left the place and was carried in procession round\nthe principal streets of the village.\nThere were twenty-\ufb01ve people in all who walked over the \ufb01re yesterday,\nabout ten of whom were boys ranging between ten and sixteen years of age,\nwho went through the \ufb01re unaided by their elders. There was also one\nold man nearly seventy years of age. While at Alandur the party were\nreported to have gone over the red-hot cinders only once, at Peralur they\nwalked through the \ufb01re not fewer than three times. A young boy, however,\ntripped and fell down, but succeeded in getting up immediately and was\nfound to be none the worse for the accident. Within a few minutes after\nthe \ufb01re-walking was over, one of the party, when questioned about the effect\nof the \ufb01re on his feet, replied with quite a cheerful face that it had had\nabsolutely no effect, a statement amply supported by an examination of his\nfeet, which bore no marks of burning.\nAnother important point of difference between the Alandur ceremony\nand the Peralur one was that, while at Alandur the permission and sanction\nof the goddess to conduct the ceremony was obtained or ascertained by\nmeans of several tests, at Peralur a direct appeal was made to the goddess\nby the pujcwl in the presence of the assembled villagers. The pujari sang\nthe praises of the goddess for some hours before she (as it was said) de\nscended on one of her favourite devotees, and through his mouth gave them\nwords of assurance that all would go well with them in connection with the\n\ufb01re-walking. At one stage of the Peralur celebration the people had almost\nabandoned the idea of performing the ceremony, as it was feared that the\ngoddess would be slow to sanction it, owing to some hitch in the perform\nance. To the immense satisfaction and relief of the villagers, the goddess,\nhowever, gave them assurance of protection a few hours before the actual\n\ufb01re-walking and enabled them to bring the ceremony to a successful\ntermination.\nFrom the \ufb01re pit to the cricket \ufb01eld is a long jump, and Mr. Rajagopal\nMoodelliar, who took part in last night\u2019s \ufb01re-walking, plays at to-day\u2019s\ncricket match at Chepauk. His \ufb01re-walking performance is one instance\nwhich goes to establish the truth of the observation often made, that the\naverage Hindu, while keeping abreast of modern times and bene\ufb01ting by\nthe civilising agencies of the West, holds fast to his ancient superstitious\npractices.\n\fNov.,1900.] Fire-Walking Cereonontes in India. 321\nOf the numerous accounts of the Fire Walk in different countries\nwhich have been published, a few are provided with illustrations repro\nduced from photographs of the scene.

Home have hitherto been\njustly considered as the foundation stone of the evidence in support of the\nreality of the so-called \u201c Physical Phenomena,\" and it is noteworthy that\nnot even so severe a critic as Mr. F. Podmore (in Studies in Psychical\nResea\/rch) does \ufb01nd fault with them. Therefore it is the more to be wished,\nit seems to me, that an authoritative refutation of Dr. Lehmann\u2019s criticisms\nshould be forthcoming.\nThe Danish savant begins by quoting from the Quarterly Jonmml of\nScience for 1871 Sir W. Crookes\u2019 account of his \ufb01rst experiments (on the\nalteration in weight of a partially suspended board and of the accordion\nexperiment), and says that, as then described by Sir W. Crookes, they\nseemed to have been rigorously scienti\ufb01c and most carefully planned. The\napparatuses had been devised and applied by Sir W. Crookes himself, D. D.\nHome merely playing the part of a dynamic machine which can be placed\nhither and thither so as to be tried under different conditions. The room\nseemed to be su\ufb02iciently lighted for everything that was going on to be\nvisible, and many competent scientists were apparently watching the course\nof the experiments.\n\u201c There seem to be here evidently all possible guarantees that the results\n-obtained were perfectly reliable,\u201d adds Professor Lehmann ; and he further\nsays: \u201cSuch a supposition [that of fraud] seems to be altogether out of\nplace so far as the experiments here described are concerned, if it be\nadmitted that this description be corTect.\n\u201cBut this is precisely not the case. On the contrary, so much is it the\nproduction of Crookes\u2019 fancy, that it could be adduced as evidence of the fact\n-that a scientist who is prominent in his own sphere may become the victim\nof self-delusion when he dares enter another which he does not know.\nSuch an assertion might, of course, seem very rash had not Crookes himself\nsupplied us with proofs of its justice. Eighteen years after this \ufb01rst account\n* For further discussion of the same subject, see Mr. F. C. S. Schillor\u2019s review of\nDr. Lehmann\u2019s Aberglaubc and Za\/uberei in Proceecltngs, Part XXXVIIL, p. 437.\n\fNov., 1900.] Correspondence. 323\nhe gave another description of those same experiments, from which it\nappears that the whole thing looked somewhat different. Every one who\nreads the above quoted accounts of 1871 will be under the impression that\nthe said experiments were made at a few s\u00e9ances where everything went on\nquite smoothly. Men of science are superintending everything; there are\nno intervals, no hindrances, no unsuccessful experiments, no suspicious\nmovements on Home\u2019s part; his psychic force is acting as exactly as if it\nwere not proceeding from a man, but from a well-arranged machine. But\nwhen you read Crookes\u2019 notes on these experiments in his diary, the\nimpression will be undoubtedly different. These notes, which were partly\nmade during the sittings, partly directly after, were published by Crookes in\nthe Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research, Part XV. (Vol. VI.),\n1889. A small extract only from his notes is published there; but the\nsittings mentioned are described in every detail.\u201d\nProfessor Lehmann then reproduces Sir W. Crookes\u2019 account of a part\nof the sitting of June 21st, 1871* (Proceedings S.P.R., Part XV., pp. 110,\n111, up to line 12) and proceeds as follows :\u2014\n\u201c Some other remarkable things took place at the same s\u00e9ance, but they\nhave less interest; for us it is only important to know under what conditions\nthe experiments with the above-mentioned apparatus were made. As for\nthat, we have received su\ufb02icient indications, which are very instructive, in\none respect at least. I shall only add that the sitting just described has\nbeen chosen from among others at random and may be considered quite\ntypical. What happened there had happened at all previous s\u00e9ances, notes\nof which have been published by Crookes. It is easy to see that the notes\nof this diary present us with an altogether different picture of the experi\nments from the previous accounts. Many of the sittings, or at least some\nparts of them, were almost dark s\u00e9ances ; this term may be applied to them,\nas only those sitting nearest [to the medium] could watch what was going on.\nWe see further that it was by no means Crookes, but Home, who directed\nthe experiments by his orders. Crookes and the other sitters only obey and\nkeep the seats which have been assigned to them until something takes place.\nHome, on the contrary, walks freely about, comes to the apparatuses of his\nown accord, moves his chair, etc.\u201d ~\nProfessor Lehmann also points out that now the gas is turned low, now\nthe reverse ; that the hands of the sitters have to be sometimes on the table\nand sometimes not, and concludes: \u201cAll this shows that these famous\nCrookes\u2019 s\u00e9ances are in no wise different from other spiritistic s\u00e9ances.\n. . . This is at any rate true (he further says) with regard to those sittings,\nthe original notes of which have been published by Crookes. It is possible\nthat he may have made other experiments besides which were carried on\nunder more reliable conditions. Still it is improbable that he should have\nchosen from among his notes those least convincing, whilst omitting the con\nclusive ones. We are therefore fully entitled to conclude that all his experi\nments were made at s\u00e9ances which were of a character completely similar to\n* Apparently the one described in the Quarterly Journal of Science for October,\n1871.\n\f324 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Nov-, 1900.\nthose described above. Consequently his \ufb01rst account, that of 1871, is no\nexact description of what really occurred, but merely an abstract in which\nonly certain de\ufb01nite phenomena are mentioned, all accompanying accessory\ncircumstances being omitted. We shall not examine here precisely how far\nthose things which Crookes thought it possible not to insert in his account\nmay have been important. . . . _Here we note two facts only : (1) Crookes\u2019\nexperiments are not strictly scient1\ufb01c lnvestigations; they were made at\ncommon spiritistic s\u00e9ances, and precisely in such a way as suited the medium\nwho played the leader\u2019s part. . . . (2) Crookes had hardly suspected all the\nimportance of the circumstances which he passed under silence in the\naccount of 1871. Otherwise he could never have given the description\nabove quoted without committing an act of conscious deception.\u201d\nBelieving, as I do, that Sir W. Crookes did observe supernormal phe\nnomena with the late D. D. Home, I cannot but see with much regret such\ncriticisms as those of Professor Lehmann approvingly quoted by other savants\notherwise favourably disposed even towards the \u201c Physical Phenomena of\nSpiritualism,\u201d like, e.g., Professor Flournoy. Surely this is enough to show\nthat those criticisms have not passed unnoticed ; surely it is worth while for\nthose most concerned if possible to kill in the bud the rising legend of the un\nreliability of Sir W. Crookes\u2019 experiments with D. D. Home\u2014that alpha and\nomeqa of the scienti\ufb01c evidence in the question of mediumistic phenomena.\nProfessor Lehmann\u2019s criticisms have more than once proved unfounded * ; I\ntrust they will prove once more so in the present case.\n[To Mr. Solovovo\u2019s letter, Sir William Crookes allows us to add the\nfollowing note :\u2014]\nM. PrrTRovo SoLovovo.\nFor nearly twenty-\ufb01ve years I have been attacked on account of these\nexperiments, and 1 have not replied. All the attacks I have seen have been\ncriticisms of one or two isolated experiments or statements I made, with an\nentire avoidance of other passages which would explain the former. They\nhave been written more with the object of showing I was wrong and\nuntrustworthy than with the object of getting at the real truth. From what\nI have read, Dr. Lehmann\u2019s criticisms appear to be of the same character.\nWhen the \u201c higher criticism\u201d appears, in which all I have written on the\nsubject is compared, collated and reviewed, I have no anxiety as to the result.\nWILLIAM CRooKEs. .\n_\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014\u2014~_~\n* I may refer the reader, e.g., to Proceedings, Vol. XII., pp. 298-314, where\ncertain criticisms of his directed against Professor and Mrs. SidgwIck\u2019s thought-trans\nference experiments are concluswely disposed of by Professor Sidgwick. And to\nreturn to the subject that concerns us now : it is obvious that Professor Lehmann s\ndisparaging remarks cannot a\ufb01ect Sir W. Crookes\u2019 very first experiments (those\ndescribed in the July number of_the_Qum-terly Journal of Science for 1871) since no\nreference to them isto be found in SIr VV. Crookes\u2019 Notes published in Proceedings,\nVol, V1,, Part XV.,_1889, and smce we have for the sitting in question Serjeant\n0o,55 and Dr. Huggms\u2019 corroboration. Still this does not ap arently prevent Pro\nfessor Leh1nann from considering that his criticisms apply to t at sitting also. An\ninstance of the same savanfs inaccuracy is afforded, by the way, by another passage in\nAberglaubc und Zauberie, where he incidentally remarks that Slade has himself\nadmitted the fraudulent character of all his manifestations, including the Leipzig experi\nments, and refers the reader to I_\"r0cecd1\"ngs S.P.R., Vol. V., p. 261 (which I \ufb01nd is\nMr. Myers\u2019 quotation of a passage In_the Seybert Commission\u2019s Report on Spiritualism).\nI have no particular sympath With Slade, but I still think that here Professor\nLehmann\u2019s statement on a su ject so calculated to impress the reader's mind is\nstrangely inaccurate.\n\fNo. CLXXIV.\u2014VoL.

BARRETT, F.R.S.\nThe following interesting case of the use of the dowsing rod for\nthe discovery of a leak in an underground water-pipe reached me too\nlate for insertion in my recently published monograph on the so-called\ndivining rod. Those of my readers who may have read that paper\nwill remember that the general conclusion arrived at was that the\nsuccess of a good dowser depended upon his possessing a faculty\nanalogous to clairvog\/once ; a subconscious transcendental perceptive\npower, which manifests itself through the involuntary motion of the\ndowsing rod, or by a peculiar malaise (a psycho-physiological disturb\nance), of the dowser. This being so, We should not be surprised if\nthe dowser were able to discover the position of a leak, or other\nhidden object, as well as an underground mineral lode or water supply.\nThe following case con\ufb01rms this supposition.\nMy informant, Mr. Young, whom I know personally, is a member\nof the S.P.R. and a very successful amateur dowser, animated with\na truly scienti\ufb01c spirit. Mr. Young writes to me as follows :\nNew Road, Llanelly, South Wales, September 26th, 1900.\nA well-known local physician (Dr. Roderick) has recently removed to a.\nnew house (an old mansion partly rebuilt) named \u201c Vaux Hall.\u201d Ever since\nhe has taken it there has been an escape of water from some pipe bursting,\nwhich produced a hissing sound, as the water pressure is great. Though the\nsound was heard, neither the doctor nor the workman could locate where the\nleak was, and as the hissing was heard wherever a pipe was laid in the house\nit became a constant annoyance. One day Dr. Roderick suggested that the\nrod might locate the leak and asked me to try. I did so, and walked along\nthe carriage road, trying \ufb01rst with my hands and afterwards with the rod.\nBoth indicated the same spot.* Upon opening the road at the place indicated\nit proved to be correct, a branch pipe being partly broken away from the\ninlet pipe at the joint. I daresay Dr. Roderick would give you con\ufb01rmation\nof this if it will be of any service to you. J F YoUNG\nIn reply to my inquiries, Dr. Roderick writes to me as follows :\u2014\nV-aux Hall, Llanelly, South Wales, October 12th, 1900.\nThe plumbers in order to \ufb01nd the leak in the water pipe took one w.c. to\npieces, and not \ufb01nding it here cut the main pipe in two places and were still\nunsuccessful. They contemplated tracing the whole length of pipe for\na distance of about 20 yards, but Mr. Young came to my assistance,\nfortunately.\n* Mr. Young, like several other dowsers, can dispense with the use of the rod\naltogether, the indication being afforded by the particular sensation he experiences.\n\u2014W. F. B.\n\fDEc., 1900.] A Novel Use of the Dowsing Rod. 329\nI told Mr. Young the course of the pipe to my mind, but in this I was\nwrong, for he located the possible leak some feet away to one side. I was not\nsatis\ufb01ed and dug down close to a tap where the sound of rushing water could \u2019\nbe heard distinctly\u2014this would be about 4ft. from the place located by Mr.\nYoung. We found water trickling into the dug hole and coming from the\ndirection of the marked place.\nAt this stage a disturbance took place between Mr. Young and the\nplumbers, the latter persons holding that the leak was some distance off.\nI, being the chief interested party, ordered the ground to be dug at the\nmark made by Mr. Young, with the result that a big leak was discovered.\nThere was a very slight depression on the surface where the leak was,' but\nMr. Young located the spot by night and again in the morning.\nThe surface indication of the leak neither I nor the plumbers noticed till\nthe digging commenced, and I am certain Mr. Young could not have felt\nit in the dark.\nI used to be very sceptical regarding water divining, but I have seen so\nmany evidences in its favour that I have convinced myself there is some\nthmg in it\u2018 SYDNEY J. RonRR1CK.\nI wrote to Mr. Young to inquire whether it was possible to have\nbeen guided to the position of the leak by a conscious or subconscious\ndetection of the sound made by the issuing water: or whether the\nslight surface depression, referred to by Dr. Roderick, could have led\nto its discovery. Mr. Young replies as follows :\u2014\nLlanelly, October 15th.\nNo amount of listening could have ever found the leak, as the sound\nceased outside the building or as soon as the pipes were under the soil. It\nwas very loud in the box containing the stopcock from street main, but\nceased as it entered the soil. Then as to outward indications, the road was\nrough, loose, thoroughly out of repair, not having been used for two years ;\nand although plumber and man searched for signs they failed. Their reason\nfor failing to \ufb01nd any outward evidence they asserted was because it was\n\u201c made ground,\u201d viz., made up of d\u00e9bris, such as slag, rubble, etc.\nBut supposing there were surface indications, [when I tried] it was dark,\nand if there were any I could not have seen them. In fact it was so dark that\nthe doctor cautioned me not to fall into a hole which was left in the road, so\nthat neither sight nor hearing had anything whatever to do with the result.\nJ. F. YoUNG.\nI also wrote to Dr. Roderick to ask if it were possible to have\ndetected the position of the leak by conduction of sound, and whether\nI might publish his letters : he replies as follows :\nVaux Hall, Llanelly, South Wales, Oclober 19th, 1900.\nYou may make what use you like of the letter I wrote you respecting the\nleak in the water pipe at my house.\n\f330 Jowrnal of Society for Psych\/teal .R68e(1\/I'C}L. [Dnc., 1900.\nThe town water inspector in his usual rounds noti\ufb01ed a leak, and said it\nwas in the w.c., with the result I have stated. He used an iron rod, placing\none end to his ear and the other on the pipe. The sound of rushing water\ncould be heard clearly at any portion of the pipe from the main to the cistern\nat the top of the house. N0 sound could be heard by placing the iron rod or\nstethoscope on the ground where Mr. Young located the leak.\nSYDNEY J. RoDERICK.\nIf the foregoing case stood alone the most probable explanation of\nit would be chance coincidence\u2014a \u201clucky hit\u201d on the part of Mr.\nYoung. But there are several cases of a similar kind. Mr. Young\nhimself some years ago found the position of a leak in the reservoir\nof the town in which he lives, and the same spot was independently\nindicated by another amateur dowser. The Chairman of the Quarter\nSessions for Herefordshire, Sir Richard Harington, Bart., happens to\nbe a successful amateur dowser, and has used the rod for the same\npurpose. In front of his house a piece of arti\ufb01cial water runs parallel\nto a brook, which is at a lower level, and Sir Richard Harington\ninforms me :\u2014\nWhitbourne Court, Worcester, October 29th, 1899.\nIt has occasionally happened that leakage into the brook has taken place\nthrough rat holes and the like, the locality of which my servants have been\nunable to discover. When this has been the case, I have used the divining\nrod, which has always told me correctly where the leak was.\nIn my recent paper on the so-called divining rod, fuller particulars\nof this case are given (Proceedings S.P.R., Part XXXVIIL, 2l4\u20142l6)\ntogether with the following. \u201cMr. Westlake, F.G.S., has recently in\nformed me of another case, Where the dowser, R. Pavey, of Cheddar,\ndid the same thing at the moat round the Bishop\u2019s Palace at Wells.\nAn engineer was \ufb01rst employed, and had spent \u00a320 in trying to \ufb01nd\nthe leak,' but failed. Pavey, though a stranger, found the leak at once,\nand it was then stopped at a cost of a few shillings. Mr. Westlake\nvisited the place and ascertained the facts ; he states the engineer was\nmuch impressed by Pavey\u2019s success, as he, after careful and costly\nexamination of the place, had failed.\u201d\nAs experiments of this kind afford a much easier test of the\ndowser than the search for underground water, they are worth careful\nrepetition under strict supervision, and I hope some of our members\nwill be able to carry out similar tests and let me know the result. It\nmust, however, be borne in mind, as I have several times pointed out\nin my Report, that the involuntary twisting of the forked rod which\noccurs in the hands of certain persons is no proof that that person is a\ngood dowser. The automatic motion of the rod may be due to some\nwholly misleading auto-suggestion, just as in automatic script the\n\fDnC., 1900.] Case. 331\nwriting may be merely the unconscious expression of the automatist\u2019s\nown ideas. The automatist, whether he holds a forked twig or a\npencil, usually improves by practice; the conscious self becomes\nmore easily placed in abeyance, and the subconscious self learns\nto respond to the proper stimulus, and to become oblivious of sug\ngestion from normal sources. But the fact of fundamental importance\nin a good dowser, if my suggested explanation be correct, is that he\nshould possess some transcendental perceptive power, that is, possess\nmore or less a clairvoyant faculty ; and this is a case of nascitu\/r non\n\ufb01t. Only through some form of automatic action can the evidence of\nthis faculty be revealed; how far it exists among persons in the normal\nstate, experiments such as I have suggested with the rod may perhaps\nenable us to ascertain. From the fact that really famous dowsers\nduring the whole of the past century can be numbered on the \ufb01ngers\nof one hand, the rarity of this faculty might be inferred, were it not\nthat, so long as dowsers are considered either knaves or fools, the\nnumber of persons likely to enter the lists is sure to be limited.\nCASE.\nL. 1122. Simultaneous Dreams.\nThe following case comes from an Associate of the Society who has\nlong been actively interested in psychical work and who is well known\nto Mr. Myers and to the Editor. He prefers that his name should not\nappear in connection with this case, which\u2014it will be noted\u2014was\nrecorded immediately after it occurred. The fact of the husband and\nwife both dreaming of the same subject might, of course, be attributed\nto a common preoccupation with it. But this does not account for\ntheir dreaming of it at the same time. Mr. writes :\u2014\nOctober 11th, 1900.\nI beg to send you a small but rather de\ufb01nite experience of thought\ntransference, which has just occurred to us. I have collected a number of\nother people\u2019s cases, but never had one of my own till now.\nThe account enclosed is as follows :\u2014 '\nSunday, October 7th, 1900.\nI woke abruptly in the small hours of this morning with a painful con\nviction upon me that my wife, who was that night sleeping in another part\nof the house, had burst a varicose vein in the calf of her leg, and that I\ncould feel the swelled place, three inches long. I wondered whether I ought\nto get up and go down to her room on the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor, and considered whether\nshe would be able to come up to me ; but I was only partly awake though in\nacute distress. My mind had been suddenly roused, but my body was still\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dnc., 1900.\nunder the lethargy of sleep. I argued with myself that there would sure to\nbe nothing in it, that I should only disturb her, and so shortly went off to\nsleep again.\nOn going to her room this morning I said I had had a horrid dream,\nwhich had woke me up, to the effect that she had burst a varicose vein, of\nwhich just now care has to be taken. \u201cWhy,\u201d she replied, \u201c I had just\nthe same experience. I woke up at 2.15 feeling sure the calf of my leg was\nbleeding, and my hand seemed to feel it wet when I put it there. I turned\non the light in alarm, noticing the time, and wondered if I should be able to\nget up to thee, or whether I should have to wake the housekeeper. Thou\nwas in the dream, out of which I woke, examining the place.\u201d\nThough I did not note the hour, 2 o\u2019clock is about the time I should have\nguessed it to be; and the impression on my mind was vivid and terrible,\nknowing how dangerous such an accident would be. It is the \ufb01rst certain\ncase of thought-transference I have had. My wife\u2019s account is being written\nindependently of this. -I regard her as the agent, myself the percipient,\nand some pain in the leg the original source of the impression.\nThe other witness concerned in the case writes :\u2014\n[On the] night of October 6th, 1900, I went to bed about 11.0 ; the veins\nof my left leg which are varicose were rather more painful than usual,\nand the whole calf felt and looked lumpy.\nI felt twinges of pain in it off and on in my sleep without being entirely\nroused till about 2.15 a.m. Then, or just before, I dreamt or had a vivid\nimpression that a vein had burst, and that my husband, who was sleeping in\nanother room up another \ufb02ight of stairs, was there and called my attention to\nit. I thought it felt wet and trickling down the leg as if bleeding, passed\nmy hand down and at \ufb01rst thought it seemed wet, but on gaining fuller\nconsciousness found all right, and that it was not more painful than often\nwhen I got out and stood on it. Thought over the contingency of its actually\nbursting and whether I could so bandage it in that case as to make it safe to\ngo up to my husband\u2019s room, and thought I could do so.\nLooking at my watch found it about 2.20.\nAlmost immediately on my husband\u2019s coming down, about 7.30 a. In., he\ntold me that he had wakened early in the night (about same time would be\nearly to him) with an impression that the vein in my leg had burst and was\nbleeding ; that he had wondered if he should come down and thought over\nwhether I should be able to bandage it and go up to him, had decided I\ncould. \u201c It was just here,\u201d he said, pointing on his own left leg to the\nexact spot at the top of the calf where I have the most trouble.\nIn answer to a question as to the accuracy of Mrs. \u2019s recollec\ntion that he had at the time debated within himself whether she\nwould be able to bandage her leg (a detail not mentioned in his own\naccount), Mr. writes :\nOctober 22nd, 1900.\nIn response to your query, I certainly thought of my wife coming up\nwith her leg bandaged. It was part of my idea of her dif\ufb01culties.\n\fDsc., 1900.] Automatic Phenomena in a Case of Hysteria. 333\nAUTOMATIC PHENOMENA IN A CASE OF HYSTERIA.\nThe case here described was reported in an Italian pamphlet\u2014now\nextremely rare\u2014written by Dr. Niccolo Cervello with the title, Storia\ndi un Caso d\u2019Isterism0 con Sognazione Spontomea (Palermo, 1853),\nbeing an account of his own observations of a hysteric patient. Mrs.\nWhitaker, of the Villa Mal\ufb01tano Palermo, Sicily, an Italian lady, well\nknown to Mr. Myers, has kindly furnished an abbreviated translation\nof the pamphlet, which we print here.\nThe amenability of the patient to self-suggestion\u2014as shown by the\naccuracy with which her symptoms followed the course of her own\npredictions\u2014though very marked, is of course one of the most familiar\nand characteristic features of the disease, and is only recorded here to\nComplete the account of the case. Suggestibility was further shown\nin the so-called \u201c transposition of the senses,\u201d supervening on a remark\nof one of her doctors on the subject. But the special interest of\nthe case from our point of view lies in the phenomena verging on the\nsupernormal\u2014the alleged clairvoyance and speaking with unknown\ntongues. It will be seen that the evidence for these phenomena is by\nno means conclusive; since there is unfortunately a great lack of\ndetail in the record of them,\u2014only two of the actual foreign words\nsaid to have been used by the patient having been recorded, while the\n-conventional dramatisations of the supposed different nationalities are\nobviously within the normal capacity. We must, however, assume at\nleast a marked heightening of the ordinary faculties from the way in\nwhich some of the parts were sustained throughout the time that\nthey were played, and the case is an interesting contribution to the\nliterature of \u201c pseudo-possession.\u201d\nMrs. Whitaker prefaces her translation with the following note :\u2014\nI will \ufb01rst say that the name of Dr. Niccolo Cervello is so well known in\nPalermo,\u2014as are also those of the many people both of note in the world of\nscience, and of good social standing, who bore testimony to the case,\u2014as to\nput any doubt of the veracity of the record beyond question. It is with\nthe most scrupulous care that each phase was noted. I may here mention\nthat Dr. Niccolo Cervello was the father of Professor Vincenzo Cervello,\nwho at the recent Congress of Berlin claimed to have found the cure of\ntuberculosis, and whose discovery has been already recognised by the\nFrench Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, of which he was made an honorary member.\nThe account of the case now follows :\u2014\nNinfa Filiberto, of a respectable well-to-do family, well-educated, aged\nsixteen, was \ufb01rst seized with violent convulsions on December 26th, 1849;\nshe had from childhood been of a singularly nervous and sensitive tempera\nment, but had enjoyed good health, and had until then shown no signs of an\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. [Dsc., 1900.\nabnormal condition of mind. From that day she was troubled with \ufb01ts of\nsomnambulism, and from being of a bright joyous nature, she became\nextremely melancholy, to such a degree that by the month of April she had\nbecome very pale and emaciated, and complained of great pain in the region\nof the liver, having also swollen feet. It was at this point that Dr. Cervello\nwas sent for, and seeing her extreme pallor, treated her for chlorosis. On\nMay 22nd she was again seized with convulsions, which generally left her\nwithout consciousness. These convulsions lasted on and off for three days,\nafter which they ceased; to the disease of the liver, however, was added\npain at the heart. A violent attack of convulsions and pain, on June 27th,\nwas followed by a state of lethargy which lasted 20 hours. At the end of\nthis time the doctors thought it advisable-to wake the patient with a dose of\nammonia; this produced the wished-for result, but the poor girl was again\nseized with such fearful convulsions as to put her life in jeopardy. Pains\nbetween the shoulders, cough, and spitting of blood supervened; suddenly,\ntowards the end of July, in 24 hours all signs of illness disappeared ; she\nagain became gay and bright, and on August 9th Dr. Cervello received a\nvisit from her, with her parents, to thank him for all his kindness during her\nvery serious illness. Thus is brie\ufb02y recapitulated the \ufb01rst or initiatory stage\nof this curious malady.\nSecond Stage.\nOn August 10th the patient showed signs of melancholy, and towards the\nafternoon was seized with violent pains in the left arm, which, however, did\nnot last long, but left the arm paralysed. On the following day, the same\nthing happened, \ufb01rst to one leg then to the other; delirium set in, and by\nthe 13th she no longer recognised her parents and relatives and only the\nright arm could move freely. A consultation of \ufb01ve doctors was held, and\nthey agreed that it was a nervous disease, but all remedies failed to give\nrelief. On August 20th, after a \ufb01t of abstraction, she said that she wished\nto write ; at \ufb01rst nothing could be made of her writings, but it was soon dis\ncovered that she wrote backwards, and this with a rapidity which astonished\nall those present. Everything possible was done to brighten and cheer the\npoor girl, and on the 22nd one of her brothers gave her some sweets, which\nshe immediately began counting backwards; on his giving her a great\nnumber she at once begun counting from 28, which proved to be the correct\nnumber. During this period she saw everything upside down, and when\ngiven a watch to tell the time, she placed it upside down. During this time\nshe was much given to \ufb01ts of abstraction, her eyes \ufb01xed and glassy, and\nabout the 22nd she was seized with inability to swallow. On the 26th she\ngave a piercing shriek and it was found that she had lost the use of her right\narm also !\nAbout this time a Dr. Ra\ufb01aello was brought to see her and he announced\nthat, in a similar case which he had followed, there had been \u201c transposition\nof the senses\u201d to the hands and feet. As soon as the unfortunate girl had\none of her attacks of abstraction, her brothers at once tried speaking very\nsoftly to her at her extremities; she at once answered back, and they\nimmediately asked how she was,\u2014if she would have other paroxys1ns that\n\fDmo., 1900.] Automatic Phenomena in a Case of Hyster'la. 335\nday and how long they would last. From that time the doctors were able to\nhelp the patient according to her own prescriptions, and when in trance, she\nwas able to foretell unerringly all the different phases her malady would\ntake. For instance, on one occasion Dr. Cervello was able to learn that at a\ncertain hour for a short time, after several days\u2019 fasting, she would be able to\nswallow, and he was thus able to have food ready to sustain her.\nHearing was not the only sense transposed to her hands and arms, but\nalso those of smell and sight; when assafoetida was applied to her nose she\nremained indifferent, but on its being brought near her elbow, she at once\ncomplained of the unpleasant smell. She was also able while her eyes were\n\ufb01xed in a strong stare to tell Dr. Calandra what was contained in a small\npacket at her elbow.\nAll the remainder of August, and up to September 10th, was passed in\ngreat suffering; but the most fearful convulsive \ufb01ts were diminished in\nintensity by her own prescriptions given when in trance, and by her power\nof predicting the exact hour and minute that she would be seized with them,\nand of indicating the least remedies that would give relief. On the 10th she\nagain began writing, and it was found that she used numbers instead of\nletters, and this (as when she wrote the letters backwards) with the most\nmarvellous rapidity.\n[The next portion of the narrative is translated in full.]\nOn the 12th, taking up her pen, she began a new sort of writing. It\nwas not numbers but an entirely unknown alphabet. We took great pains\nto discover the connection of this alphabet with our letters, and after many\ninquiries, it was made clear to all, and that day we understood what she\nwrote. But on the 13th she changed to another alphabet and we could not\nunderstand her. She wrote in vertical lines and was provoked that we could\nnot understand her writing. Also, she did not understand our pronuncia\ntion, and when she spoke it was in an entirely new tongue. Luckily she fell\ninto frequent trances during which she spoke French and Italian. Later on\nin the day we gave her a Greek grammar; she glanced hastily over the\nGreek alphabet and seemed pleased with it, and presently began to use these\nletters, and for all the rest of the day did not change her alphabet, although\nshe wrote Italian phrases, and for the \ufb01rst time since August 20th she did\nnot write backwards.\nMeanwhile she did not speak or understand Italian, and the only way in\nwhich she could be got to understand a few phrases was by calling out the\nGreek names, one by one, of the letters of which the phrase was composed.\nAt the same time she spoke to us with such rapidity that we could not follow\nher, in a language entirely unintelligible to us, as if she were speaking her\nown language. We supposed that it must be Greek, as, when she again fell\ninto a trance, she wrote : \u201c I have been to Athens ; I have seen that lovely\ncity; the people there speak as I do.\u201d She ended by imagining herself a\nGreek woman; she put on a proud and resolute expression, and seemed\nwith di\ufb02iculty to repress a deep and silent anger. She hid a dagger in her\nbelt and often brandished it, announcing that she wished to plunge it into\nsomebody\u2019s breast, nor would she suffer it to be removed. With this dagger\n\f336 Journal of Society for Peychical Research. [Dsc.,1900.\nshe tried to pierce a little child, whom she saw in her paroxyms, and whom\nshe asked for bread. She was accustomed to see this vision when fasting ;\nand from the morning of this day she had begun a third fast, which she said\nwould last 45 hours. That day she was very excited, and in a trance said\nthat she could have spoken any language, and that that day she would feel\nand speak in Greek, the next day in French, and the next in English, and\nfor those two days would not write. On the 14th, she did not understand\nGreek or Italian but spoke and understood only French.\nHer mood was very different from that of the preceding day: she was\ngay, witty, and amiable; she conversed briskly and comprehended very\nrapidly. She could not read the clock which was numbered in the Italian\nfashion. Given an Italian-French grammar, she read the French phrases,\nbut could not understand or pronounce the Italian. When asked what she\nhad done the previous day, she replied that she remembered nothing about\nit. When told that she had spoken Greek, she laughed at us, and said she\nhad never been taught Greek or any other language,\u2014that she was a\nParisian, living in Palermo. She was amused at our accent and pronun\nciation not being pure, and lamented that she had no voice to show us how\nit was done in Paris, etc. She frequently complained of confusion in her\nhead which was dissipated by music. Thus the 14th passed.\nOur great expectation was for the morrow, when she had foretold that\nshe would speak English, for she had been taught a little French, but of\nEnglish she had not been taught even the \ufb01rst elements, nor had any of the\nfamily,\u2014from whom she might have picked up a few words or phrases,\u2014\never learnt it.\nThe father, conscious of this, considered that, however bad our French\naccent had been, we had been able to converse with the patient that day,\nbut that the next we should not understand her and that the scene of the\n13th might be repeated. So he decided that for that day alone he would\nbreak his resolution\u2014rigorously maintained hitherto\u2014not to introduce any\nstranger into his daughter\u2019s room, and begged some of his friends to come\nwho were either English by birth or who spoke the language very \ufb02uently.\nEarly on September 15th, Professor Cavalier Tineo [the uncle of the\npatient], who had almost every day observed the wonderful phenomena of\nthe illness of his niece, arrived and remained with her from the early morn\ning until 3 p.m. to satisfy his inexpressible curiosity. Two Englishmen,\nMr. Wright and Mr. Frederick Olway, were present, besides six Sicilians\n. . [names and occupations given] who understood English well, and\ntook it in turns to spend the day with her.\nOn her awaking, they talked to her in Italian and French, but she looked\nblankly at them and understood nothing of what they said.\nThen, speaking in excellent English, she expressed her surprise that they\ndelayed so long in bringing her her tea.* Then Mr. Olway began to talk to\nher and she carried on an easy conversation with him. When asked to write\n\" Note by the Tmnslator.\u2014I must here note that tea is never taken by Sicilians\nin the morning. Indeed, 50 years ago, it was only used as a decoction to be taken at\nnight to ward off a chill.\n\fDEC,, 1900.] Automatic Phenomena in\/a Case of Hysteria. 337\nsomething, she refused, but when pressed again for a word or two at least,\nshe thus wrote the date : \u201cFifteen September.\u201d At 9 a.m., having accom\nplished the 43 hours of her fast, she ate, as she had predicted ;\u2014her face\nwas serious ; she talked gravely and gesticulated little.\nHer voice this day was almost inaudible, and occasionally completely\ngave way. At these times, when she could not make herself understood by\ngestures, she had; recourse to an ingenious arti\ufb01ce. She procured an English\nbook and, holding it in her hand, pointed with her \ufb01nger to different words,\nand thus succeeded in composing the sentence which she had thought of.\nIn her paroxysms, she scolded the [visionary] child and threatened him with\nher \ufb01sts after the English fashion. She said that she was born in London,\nbut living in Palermo.\nWhen the two Englishmen talked between themselves, she gave undeni\nable signs of understanding what they said, and congratulated herself on the\nlucky chance of having found two compatriots in a foreign land.\nWhen the Sicilians spoke English, she noted their foreign accent and\ndeplored her weak voice which would not allow of her teaching them\nproperly the correct accent. Towards evening she informed us that the\nnext day she would speak Italian, and she then discussed with the two\nEnglishmen which of the Sicilians spoke the best English. Thus, this day\nfull of wonders not only to us, but to the strangers present, came to a close.\nWe were longing for the 16th that we might again speak Italian to our\ndear invalid. . . . She announced to us, however, that she was of Siena\nand described to us minutely the works of art of that city, I do not know\nif it will seem so to others, but to me the talking in pure Tuscan was as\nmarvellous as the English. It is impossible to modulate the voice to this\nsoft tongue without being born there, and the girl herself seemed to enjoy\nthe beautiful expressions she was able to use.* She herself had entirely\nforgotten the Sicilian dialect, excepting the few words like Italian.\nShe remained in this state until the 18th.\n[The next part of the account is again abridged]\nThe invalid having predicted that on the 18th the paralysis would entirely\nleave her, this happened; a curious fact was that as the paralysis disappeared,\nthe patient, who until then had spoken pure Tuscan, passed, actually in the\nmvkist of a phrase, into the Sicilian dialect, which was her natural language ;\nnor did she at all remember afterwards any of the languages she had spoken\nso wonderfully.\nIn a moment of trance she wrote to Dr. Cervello that she would be\nassailed by frightful convulsions on the 22nd; this of course in her normal\nstate she did not know, and on the 19th and 20th\u2014ignorant of what she had\npredicted\u2014she gained strength and spirits and on the 21st was so well that\nshe was able to go out.\n* Note by the Translator.-\u2014The Sicilian dialect which is always spoken by the\nmiddle classes is indeed like a different language from Tuscan, and the accent totally\ndifferent. Fifty years ago, there was so little intercourse between the two countries,\nthat it is improbable Ninfa had ever met a Tuscan.\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psych\/icut lteseurch. [Dsc., 1900.\nThird Stage.\nThis last stage of the malady Dr. Cervello divides into seven periods ; the\n\ufb01rst, lasting from the 22nd to the 27th, comprised the most violent form of\nconvulsions, which reached such a degree that a padded room had to be\nprepared for the patient. Somnambulism was also a feature of this period,\nand she was able to hem a pocket handkerchief, most perfectly, with closed\neyes. The second period began on the 28th, after 24 hours\u2019 truce, and was\ncharacterised by great clairvoyance, but inability to recognise all those\naround her. At this point Dr. Raffaello was able to give her some help, by\nwhat was then called animal magnetism, and she obtained relief by this\nmeans, and the arti\ufb01cial sleep rested and restored her. Of course this\nscience was then in its infancy, and was indeed mostly in the hands of\ncharlatans ; so much so that Dr. Cervello in his pamphlet thinks it necessary\nat this point almost to apologise for permitting the treatment.\nIt is curious to note that, some of the symptoms of this curious malady\nremaining quite inexplicable, Dr. Cervello was at last reduced to acceding to\nthe urgent request of the patient\u2019s confessor, and allowing the priest to\nexorcise her, as being possessed of devils. This curious ceremony took\nplace, and\u2014needless to say\u2014gave not the slightest relief.\nOn October 4th, the girl Filiberto had the \ufb01rst paroxysm of the third\nperiod during which she again experienced \u201ctransposition of the senses,\u201d\nand had also long cataleptic attacks. When in trance she continued to\nprescribe the medical remedies to be used ; for instance, she predicted that\nthe senses would only respond in the middle \ufb01nger of each hand. To\ndiminish the duration of the cataleptic \ufb01ts, she said, \u201c Give me small doses\nof syrup of turpentine; after \ufb01ve minutes of the paroxysm press my forehead\nand blow behind my ears.\u201d* During this period the patient had a paroxysm,\nwhen her body became burning hot, and all red as if with scarlatina ; violent\nconvulsions seized her, and with her face blistered and swollen, her hair all\nstanding on end like a Medusa, Dr. Cervello says the sight of her was\nappalling! The fourth period began on October 9th, on the morning of\nwhich poor Ninfa seemed quite calm\u2014indeed, bright and happy; quite\nignorant of having predicted, when in trance, that she would at midday of\nthat day be seized with most terrible paroxysms. She had predicted also\nthat for 48 hours she would fast, being unable to swallow ; that she would\nlose all her senses, and in moments of trance would only be able to hear\nthrough her spine. All came absolutely true. She also predicted that the\n\ufb01fth and sixth\u2018 periods would be mild and not involve intense suffering, and\nwould both be chie\ufb02y marked by somnambulis1n. During this time, under\nmagnetic in\ufb02uence, she predicted a most terrible seizure on October 31st ;\nalso that her clairvoyance would end on that day, when death would eusue.\nIt would take too long to describe the skilful way in which Dr. Cervello\ncombated this idea, and how, in continued sittings, he gradually succeeded\nin modifying her conviction of death, and extracting from her some remedies\n\" This was done in a similar case at Lyons, in 1787, by Professor P\u00e9t\u00e9tin; yet this\ngirl in Palermo could not possibly have read of this case, which was only known to the\nmedical faculty. \u2014N.

Su\ufb02ice it to say that, with the help of Dr. Raffaello,\nwho had, as I have already mentioned, been accustomed to use his magnetic '\npower, the violence of the attack of the 31st was diminished, and after most\nterrible spasms of the heart, and convulsions, an absolute calm set in, and\nthen gradually, instantly helped by magnetism, a restorative sleep set in; and\ncomplete recovery was not far o11'.\nFourth Staye and Decline of the Terrible Malady.\nAll through November and until December 21st, there was a gradual and\nsteady improvement, only interrupted occasionally by paroxysms of pain at\nthe heart, convulsions, and slight paralysis; she was able often to go out.\nOn December 21st (according to her prediction) she entered on a period of\n\ufb01ve days\u2019 suffering, and on the 26th,\u2014exactly one year from the day she was\n\ufb01rst affected,\u2014she entirely recovered.\nHere ends Dr. Cervello\u2019s report ; I can only add that the lady still lives,\nhas been happily married, and is a mother and grandmother, and has always\nsince enjoyed good health and absolute freedom from any of the extra\nordinary symptoms which accompanied her very remarkable illness.\nPalermo, 1899.
