Whatever has been di\u017fcovered has been revealed\nby Degrees, and, Air-Balloon-like, has often been neglected\nand renewed. Human Knowledge pre\u017ferves its Revolution -\nround the Truth, as the terne\ufb05rial Globe does round that\nluminous Body which cheers us with its Rays. But in the\nProgre\u017fs of our Knowledge, ignorance \ufb05ill attends, and\nreigns alternately, as Darkne\u017fs after Light. Not many\nCenturies have elap\u017fed \u017fince \u017feveral People knew this Art,\nand produced many E\ufb00ects without knowing the Cau\u017fe, but\nbeing \u017fuppo\u017fed the Work of Witchcraft, in tho\u017fe Times of\nIgnorance, the Per\u017formers were put to the Torture, and\ncon\u017fequently the Art was lo\ufb05. I have my\u017felf been looked\nupon by many ignorant People, in France, England', and Ire\nland, as a Magician, by putting \u017feveral Ladies and Gen\ntlemen into Somnamdulz'\ufb02n, or Sleep-Waiting, and in that State\nhaving made them 'at and drink, \u017fing and play upon lb: Harp\u017fi\ntbartl, or any other In\ufb05rument thy rwm u\u017fe-a' to, by telling an un\nknown Per\u017fon their Di\u017fea\u017fes, and pre\u017fcribing for them, &e.\nAll the\u017fe Things appeared to them wonderful, and beyond\nthe Power either of Nature or Art, ina\u017fmuch as they knew\nnot the Cau\u017fe, I \u017fh I'\na\n\f'ma-,\nA.\nJu\n.=\nr\nu-r\n_-.\n-__--\n-_-\nw.\n-*\n_-\"\n__\n'In\n'TH'\nvi PREFACE.\n' l \u017fhall only give here \u017fuch Principles as appear to me phi\nlo\u017fophically rea\u017fonable, and on them lay the Foundation of\nthat Art, in the Practice of which I have had a great Deal\nof Succe\u017fs every where I have been ; and by encouraging my\nPupils to labour in the \u017fame exten\ufb01ve Field, they may reap\nthe \u017fa\u017f\u017fme Advantages.

Several Kings in Europe have had that Gift. Lam'c\nXVI. when crowned, touched \u017feveral Patients, \u017faying, The\nKing toucheth they, God'naj cure thee. It is \u017fince Philip I.

Is it at re\ufb05? No; its motion meets with\nan ob\ufb05acle ; however, it \ufb05ill exi\ufb05s z or, at lea\ufb05,\nit lo\u017fes the motion of acceleration, to pre\u017ferve\nonly that ofits own gravitation ; it has communi\ncated the former to the body which it has touched,\nfrom\n* We under\ufb05and here by motion, the \u017fingle deplacl'g of\na body, though \ufb05rength, which is the principle of its motion,\nmay be communicated, propagated, but can never be de\n\ufb05royed.\n\f[8]\n\"Wi'\ufb01\n\"-_-_\n-_H\n'\n\ufb02ow-un\n\"\np\n.-..-.\n..\n-._-..-.-.\n.\nq_\n.\"'.'*I\"'\n\"I!.\n'UN'K\nJ\nfrom whence it will \u017fpread in the matter, and be\n\u017fo far divided as to have become in\u017fen\u017fible.\nMan is not endowed with the power of di\u017fcern\ning the e\u017f\u017fential attributes of things, and it is only\nthrough exi\ufb05ence and privation that we conceive\nany di\ufb05inct idea of them. lt is thus by the idea\nof the night that we conceive any di\ufb05inct idea of\nthe day, and 'vice ver\u017fe. For, were we always to\nperceive the light, that continual perception could\nnot be felt 5 at lea\ufb05, we could not be con\u017fcious of\nit, nor be able to give it any proper appellation.\nIt is only by rea\u017fon of this narrowne\u017fs of our fa\nculties, that we are acquainted with motion; hav\ning \u017feen \u017fome beings moving, and others at re\ufb05, we\nhave inferred, that motion did not always exi\ufb05.\nSuppo\u017fe that all animate beings which live on\nthe \u017furface of the earth, \u017fhould knock with their\nfeet at the \u017fame in\ufb05ant, would they not produce an\nadditional motion ? A motion which could not\nhave been fore\u017feen in the laws which natural phi\nlo\u017fophers have laid down. That motion al\u017fo tends\ntowards the centre of the earth, but where does it\n\ufb05op? Where is it to be annihilated?\nIf animate matter then can produce irregular\nmotions, is not the centre wherein tho\u017fe motions\nend, al\u017fo animated, that it may be proportionate to\ntho\u017fe\n\f[9]\ntho\u017fe anomalies, and \u017fo re\ufb05ore the equilibrium, and\nforce, that are-the pre\u017fervers of the world?\nFurther ; it is not nece\u017f\u017fary to pay any regard to\nthe motion impre\ufb05 by animate matter, to conclude\nthat which we look upon to be dead, becau\u017fe it is\nat re\ufb05; for even the globe of the earth is animated ;\nall things tend towards the centre of that globe;\nand gravitation is in reality nothing more than an\nimpre\ufb05 motion towards a determinate direction. It\ntherefore mu\ufb05 ab\u017folutely follow, that tho\u017fe moti\nons mu\ufb05 be re\ufb02ected with new directions from the\ncentre of the earth, or they mu\ufb05 be de\ufb05royed. But,\nif it be true, that in the art of rea\u017foning, the ana\nlogy or method of \u017fimplifying the principle as much\nas po\u017f\u017fible, is to be con\u017fidered as the \u017fure\ufb05 way of\nproceeding, we \u017fhall be authori\u017fed to think that\nnature modi\ufb01es, alters, and di\ufb05ributes, rather than\nde\ufb05roys. Thus, as WC acknowledge in all organi\nzed bodies, a faculty which divides, di\ufb05ributes,'and\nreturns all tho\u017fe motions, who\u017fe impre\u017f\u017fions they re\nceive, or rather which are communicated to them;\n\u017fince we \u017fee that tho\u017fe motions are never annihila\nted ; why \u017fhould we imagine that there is an incom\n' prehen\u017fible proceeding in nature, a \u017fecret quality\nwhich we are not in want of? Why cannot we \u017fup:\npo\u017fe, that it operates upon \u017fpheres as well as upon\nindividuals ? _\nIf the known laws of heavine\u017fs, or gravity, com<\nmunication of motion, &c. \u017folely belong to inert\nB _ mat\n\f[10]\nman\n*-.\n---\n'n-d-\n._._--,.\nil\"\nVLHEW-d\nwa\u017f\n.\n_,-.-.I'.\"'\n-_\n-\nmatter, and animated matter can arbitrarily act up\nOn it, all animated forces, therefore, will only be *\ntrouble\u017fome, and all the univer\u017fe will be in con\nfu\u017fion. * i\n\u017fi I\u017f then all matter be con\u017fidered as being anima\nted, the phoenomena o\u017f the whole world will not\nbe more extraordinary than tho\u017fe of the human bo\ndy, nor could the be\ufb05 phy\u017fiologi\ufb05s explain a \u017fingle\nmoment of their own exi\ufb05ence, if they did not ad\nmit an animated principle to be the pre\u017ferver of it,\nand which, by laws unknowu to them, compen\u017fates\nfor all irregularities of pa\u017f\u017fions and impre\u017f\u017fions.\nNow, without proceeding any farther in tho\u017fe\nrelations and analogies, (the paths through which\nit would be a di\ufb03cult ta\u017fk to pur\u017fue) let us only\nob\u017ferve that, whatever can be con\u017fidered as the\ncentre of the action, or as performing the function\nof receiving, di\ufb05ributing, or \u017fending back the mo\ntion, always \u017feems to be productive of a more \u017fub\ntile matter, more elaborate, more unlike matter in\nert, and more near to that which we conceive by\nanimated matter.\ni' Let us, for example, only mention tran\u017fpiration,\nemanations, tho\u017fe currents e\ufb05abli\u017fhed betwcen the\nbeings which lead us to imitation, and make us\nyield to \ufb05range motions, \u017fuch as pa\u017fiions, \u017fympa\nthies, antipathies, &e. even Animal Electricity and\nMagneti\u017fm, which \u017feem to be the Great Oceans\nfrom which the animated matter verily \u017fprings.\n' Nature\n\f[Ill\n- Nature thus leads us to a way o\u017f thinking, which\nencourages us to believe that the interior part of\nthe globe is a grand receptacle of motion, and con\n\u017fequently a grand centre of activity. Since, there\nfore, in out principles there are no annihilated mo\ntions, what hinders us from acknowledging that\nboth Electricity and Magneti\u017fm are the produce of\nThat interior elaboration; the particular \u017fecretions\nof the globe; the principles of the life of that va\ufb05\nindividual, and which \u017fhew its corre\u017fpondencc with\nall the inhabitants of it? '\nSuppo\u017fing now, that general corre\u017fpondence of\nmotions to_ be well e\ufb05abli\u017fhed, kept up by a \u017fubtile -\nmatter, more or le\u017fs animated, \u017fhould we not then\nmore ea\u017fily explain the duration and equality of ce\nle\ufb05ial motions? For, on one hand, it is a little re\npugnant to rea\u017fon, to imagine an ab\u017folute vacuum ;\nand on the other, all matter, however clo\u017fely it\nmay be kept, 'implies the idea, of friction, and Con\n\u017fequently a diminution of motion; hence we \u017fhall\n\ufb01nd our\u017felves greatly comforted by an hypothe\u017fis,\nwhich will \u017fhew the very cau\u017fe of motion in the\n\ufb02uids', which ought to \ufb05op it; and the di\ufb00erence\nwill proceed from the principle alone, that, in\ufb05ead\nOf con\u017fidering the \u017fpace as \ufb01lled up with a dead\nand pa\ufb03ve matter, we \u017fuppo\u017fe it con\ufb05antly traver\n(ed by currents, which both pre\u017ferve the motion,\nand keep it up.\nB 2 Every\n\f_ _v__ V. . > r* ' ' \u017f\u017f_j'-i\n' _ , .,- .\nte; -- m\ng,\n\u017f .
