[J~. 18.\nREPORT OJ' THE GENERAL MEETING\u2022\n.\nA General Meeting of the 8eciety was held on the evening of\nMonday, July 5th, at the Rooms of the Society of British Artists,\nSuft'olk Street, Pall Mall.\nI \u2022 The' President of th8 SOciety, Profeuor Balfour Ste~ F.R.S.,\nOccupied the chair. He invited Mr. C. C. Masaey to read a Paper\non \"The Poaibilities of Mal-Obaervation in Relation to Evidence for\nthe Phenomena of Spiritaaliltm.\" The paper will appear at length in\nthe forthcoming Part of the P~ing., and only an abstract of tbt-\nargument is here.given.\nAdverting to the reference of the phenomena in question to con\u00b7\njuring, Mr. Massey considered that there were certain broad and\nessential distinctions between the two cases as regards the faculty of ob-\nservation. The causes of mal-observation when a design to induce it may\nbe assumed were mainly three-{1) Uncertainty as to the precise thq\nto be observed; (2) Defective ph,aioal conditions of observation; (3)\nOccasions of distraction of attention. Apart from confederates and\nartificial appliances, every conjurer was dependent upon one or more of\nthese for his opportunity. At meMuinistic sittings they all could be,\nand frequently were, excluded. With this view the investigator\ncould take all the arrangements t.into his own hands, reducing the\nmedium to the m,,,w'I.mof the activity upon which 110 conjurer must\ndepend to mask his proceedings, thus reversing one esaential relation of\nnch 110 performer to his spectator. mustrative cases--described as only\naamples from 110 bulk-were cited at length from several publiabed re-\nports, including the reader's own experience. Reference was made to\nthe position adopted by Mrs. Sidgwick in the June number of the\nJournal, that evidence for these phenomena was vitiatecl by the\nnecessity for continuous observatiOll.. In this view, not only were im\u00b7\nportant facts lost for observation, but evidence might contain state-\nments of non-existent facts, it being part of the juggler's art to induce\na false appearance of them. But (Mr. Massey contended) this positive\nerror could only belong to honest statements when the latter were of a\ngeneral character, omitting to ditlcriminate the true perceptive el~\nments of 110 composite observation, and giving only a mental remit in\nplace of testimony of the senses. Except under conditions which could\nhave no general application to theee phenomena, if the conditions of\nobservation were physically easy, individual acts of perception were not\nfallible, and the question whether they had in fact been performed could\nbe settled by the testimony of a veracious witness, which would aI.,a1'\nbetray ita own defects by absence of particularity. On theother hmd,\nthe nsgestion ofpositive mal-observation was excluded by particularity\nof statement. As to mere failure of observation of important facta. it\nDigitized by Google\n\f339\n;'WIIS always necessary to conSider in the partieular case what were the\nnature and dimensions of any fact that could affect the result, in order\nto judge of the possibility of its eluding the senses and nund of the\nwitness. This was not a question to be disposed of by reference to the\ngeneral instability of attention in prolonged obserYations ; the\ndegree of mental pre-occupation to be induced by the conjurer in the\nwitness was measurable by the physicalacts the conjurer must perform\nin the circumstances of the case. I.n conditions well arranged by the\nobservers, as in many of the recorded.experiments, these acts would be\nextremely obtrusive, and often very complicated-whereas the prepara-\ntions were expressly designed to limit observation to their exclusion,\nand one only need be excluded. In other cases the physical character\nof the phenomenon described was such as to make the suggestion of \u2022\n,conjurer's &gency inappropriate upon even the largest admissible suppo-\nsitions of imperfect observation-as when a littl~ table disappeared\nbodQyand afterwards descended ,~,.full yie\\\\\" from the ceiling in\na .private room, as Zollner and the medium were sitting side by side,\nor as when Mr. Massey himself had a fallen chair, of which he had\na clear view, picked up and depositetl at his side by invisible agency at\nhis request, when the medium was sittingfive feet off from it.\nBut Mr. Massey did not admit that exceptiona~ manifestations or\nconditions were essential to guarantee observation, and he adduced an\nexperience of his ownand Mr. Rodeu.Noel's in Eglintoll's slate-writing~\nto illustrate the extent of the claim he made for average powers of\nobservation.\nHe then criticised an account giv.en by Mrs. Sidgwick, at a recent\nmeeting of the Society, of a slate-writing performance of an amateur\noonjarer, in which her own and a. fr\u00a5tnd's observation was effectually\nba.tIled. He referred to it in order Wshow that the supposed observ..\ntions were not stated with the particularity necessary to constitute even\napparently good evidence, and could therefore raise no presumption\nagainst other evidence which on the face of it was free from defect.\nHe proceeded to answel' Mrs. Sidgwick's view that the medium had\nan advantage over the avowed conj~r in his \"privilege o~ failure,\"\nand also urged that. the mdClium had a far severer ordeal of ill.vestip-\ntion to .pass through than any conjurer. He then dealt with some\ngenera.l objections to the eviden~. auch as detected trickery, the\nabsence of tests which would dispense with any continuous observation\nin the presence of the medium, and the failure of some investigators to\nobtain any satisfactory evidence at all. He Pointed out that such\nfailures had been presupposed by the Society at the outset, as the phe-\n3lomena had notthe scientific character of being reproducible for any\n.and'every one. The conjuring tJ!eory was, totally inadequate to the\nx 2\n. 1.\u00b7\u00b71' . . . . \"\nDigitized by-GOOgle\n\f340 JOllrluzl qf 8oc~t!l.for P8!1cMcai Bemll\u00b7ch. (J'air. 1888;\nmagnitude and duration of the experience now accumulated. Conjurers\nthemselve! who had sat with mediums had come away without dis\u00b7\ncoVering trickery, and the letter recently published in Lig1&t, from the\nama.teur conjurer, Dr. HcrscheU' to Mr. Eglinton, was a striking\ntestimony to the genuine character of \"autography.n\n'The Society and its investigators should approach the subject with\nsome regal'll to the psychicaJ conditions which the hypothesis of medium\u00b7\nship involved, and not with the dominating idea' of' conjuring, though\nevery investigator ought to be adequately impresSed with the necessity\nof strict and close observation and exact statements. It should be con\u00b7\nsidered that telepathy might imply much more than consciousness would\nreveal, and that the psychical intluence of mental dispositions might be\n110 real condition in the production of the phenomenA. Mr. Massey COD'\neluded by recommending the appomtment of a committee to examine\nand report upon the existing evidence for \"autography,n but urged\nthat such a committee should not be composed of those who would\nmake an indiscriminate application of Mrs. Sidgwick's extreme pre-\nsumption against observation, as in that case only a foregone negative\nconclusion was to be expected. ;\nIn inviting discussion, the President said that Professor Sidgwick's\nremarks, which Mr. Massey had quoted, had done good if they had\ncalled forth such a paper as that which had just been heard.\nThe Rev. W. Stainton Moses said that he thought we must all feel\ndeeply indebted to Mr. Massey for the able, temperate, and closely-\nreasoned paper which he had read to us. Referring to the June\nnumber of the Society's Journal, he remarked that some had thought\nthat sufficient notice had not been taken of Mr. Eglinton j but that\nreproach could now no longer be made. At the same time, he wished\nto enter his protest against what he considered the unfair tone and\nstyle of the article in the Journal, and generally of the manner in\nwhich the evidence had been treated. Itwas not of hopeful augury for\nthe usefulness of the Committee proposed by Mr. Massey.' He had\neven been led to ask himself whether Spiritualists could be of any\nfurther use-if indeed they had been of any-within the Society if\nthat article was to be taken as an expression of the Society's opinion.\nHe hoped it would be disowned as the action of the Society; and he\nhad been glad to hear, since he caine into the room, that they were to\nlook on it only as an expression of individual opinion, and that it did\nnot commit those who, like himself, differed from it, to its lines. He\nhoped to hear this view confirmed from the chair, for, until disavowed,\"\n\u2022 As ihe Society has DO coUective voice in lIuch matters, it is Dot neceesary.\nor tmm possible, that any view expl'e8ll8Cl by an individual member of it sbould\nbe .. disavowed.\" It Will be remembered that even in the cue of paJMlll\npublished in the Procuding., .. the ~D8ibi1ity for both facta and reaaoDlDgI\nreata entirely with their autbors.\"-ED.\nDigitized by Google\n\f.Tall', 1886.]\nthe paper in question will be held by many to embody the views\nheld by the leaders of the Society for Psychical Research, and therefore\nof the Society itself.\nTo show that these things did not rest on Mr. Eglinton's shoulders\nalone, he (Mr. St&iuton Moses) would like to call attention to an\nexample in his own experience, where writing was done on a slate in a\nlocked cupboard of his own, under circumstances which absolutely\nconvinced him of the reality of the phenomenon. This occurred at an\nimportant crisis in his life, in harmonious connection with a variety of\nother phenomena whicb forced him, as a logical necessity, to accept the\nSpiritnalist hypothesis. from which he had never since wavered.\nDr. Wyld felt with Mr. Stainton Moses, that Mrs. Sidgwick, in the\nremarks that had been referred to, had not dealt with the subject of slate-\nwriting in a satisfactory wanner. The cases which sbe had reviewed\nwere recorded by ladies and gentlemen of undoubted veracity, and of\nfally average intelligence, and some of them were worthy of the closest\nattention; yet Mrs. Sidgwick dismissed tbe whole evidence in these\nwords, \"I have now no hesitation in attributing the performances\nto clever conjuring.\" Mrs. Sidgwick had no pretensions to being a\nconjurer; and she was perfectly well aware that conjurers had\ngiven a verdict the reverse of her own, because tbeir written and\nsigned testimony had during these eight or ten years appeared almost\ncontinuously in print, in the pages of the Spiritualistic journals; and\nDr. Wyld therefore thought that he did not speak discourteously in\ncharacterising Mrs. Sidgwick's view of the whole case as an evidence\nof excessive credulity on ber part, in relation to her powers of judgment\nin occult matters.\nDr. Wyld then described two experiments observed by himself,\none with Mr. Eglinton and the other with Dr. Slade, which he\nregarded as affording absolutely incontrovertible evidence as to occult\nslate-writing.\nThe experiment with Eglinton was as follows: it occurred early\nin the year 1884. A bit of slate pencil being placed between two\nslates which were previously examined, he and Eglinton tben placed\ntheir hands on the top of the upper slate as it lay on the table.\nImmediately tbe sounds of writing were heard, and these having ceased.\nDr. Wyld and Eglinton examined the slates and found one of tbem\ncovered with fine clear writing from the top to the bottom of tbe slate\nthe writing being in reply to a question they bad put regarding a dis-\nputed matter. Finding that the last sentence was unfinished, Eglinton\ntook another slate wbicb Dr. Wyld examined, and pressing this against\nthe under aide of the flap of the table,Eglinton asked Dr. Wyld also to\npress it close to the table,which he did, wbereupon the sounda of writin~\nDigitized by Google\n\f\" ' \\ ' \" ' . \\\nJournal of &cietv .fM' PqcAitJlll ~~ [lair. 18118.\"\nwere again distinctly audible; and on examining the slate it was found\nalaO covered with fine writing from top to bottom,and the last sentence\ncarried round the four sides of the frame of the slate. The reply to the'\nquestion put was clear and sensible, and quite to the point.\nThe writing on the two'slates seemed to occupy about two minutes,\nbut on copying this writing afterwarda, Dr. Wyld found that the\noperation occupied twenty minutes of quick writing. '\nThese two slates were, before the 6Xperiment, examined by Dr. Wyld,\nand he never lost sight of them during the experiment for one second,\nand he maintains 'that this experiment was entirely outside the range\nof conjuring, and that it demonstrated occult slate-writing.\nThe second experiment was with Slade. Dr. Wyld had many\ne;Jtperiments with Slade, but the experiment now to be described was &\nc:rucial one.\nHe sat with Slade in daylight, no visitor being in the room except\nhimself. He having taken up a alate from a pile of slates on & table\nsaid, \"I wish this experiment to be perfect and therefore you must\nnot touch this slate from beginning to end of the experiment, not even\nwith the tip of your finger, because if you did so, some ignorant person\nmight say that you produced the writing by sleight of hand,\"\nSlade sat about four feet from Dr. Wyld at the opposite side of &\ntable, but some distance from the table, and Dr. Wyld having first\nexamined both sides of the slate, and found it a new dusty slate, placed\na crumb of pencil on the table; he then covered the pencil with the slate\nand pressed the slate to the table with his elbow, while he seized Slade's\ntwo feet with his two feet, and his two hands with his two hands, and\nthen said \"Now write.\"\nImmediately the sound of writibg occurred,and this having ceased,\nDr. Wyld pushed Slade's hands away, and lifting the slate from the\ntable, found a message written in dusty slate pencil writing, containing\nfive Christian family names and a message concerning a family matter\nof importance. This experiment was entirely beyond the range of\nconjuring; and of occult slate-writing Dr. Wyld has no more doubt\nthan he has of his own existence.\nMr. F. Podmore then said that he would give an account of &\nrecent slate-writing experiment w~\"h he had witnessed. Mr. Z., a\nconjurer, recently gave a slate-writing seance to Mr. A. Podmore, at\nwhich Mr. F. Podmore was permitted to be present. Mr. Z. began by\ngiving Mr. A. Podmore a double-slate with Bramah lock, to examine.\nMr. A. Podmore satisfied himself that there was no trickery connected\nwith tile slate. He then, at Mr. Z.'s request, put some small pieces of\ncoloured chalk into the slate and locked it, putting the key in his\npocket. Mr. A. Podmore clearly understood that he had to watch this\nDigitized by Google\n\fJuly, l888.] 343\nlocked slate (which lay on the table infruDlof him) Tery clOll8ly; and\nbe is even now of opinion that he did actully keep his eyes fixed upon\nit Continuoaaly. When, however, after the lapee of about a qaarter-\u00ab-\nan-hoar the slate was opened, it was IoaDd to contain a long meaaage\nwritten on both the inner aides. Mr\u2022. A. Podmore was astounded, and\nexpresaed himself confident that he had not let the slate go out of his\nAlight. Yet Mr. F. Podmore had noticed that there was an interval of\nsomething like three minutes, during which his brother had removed\nhis eyes from the alate and kept them fixed on Mr. Z.' face. In that\ninterval the conjurer's trick was performed, and Mr. F. Podmore had\nbeen allowed to witness the performance. .\nMrs. Brietzcke said that she should like to add her teatimony to the\nreality of the phenomena obtained with Mr. EgHnton. On seyeral\noccasions when she was present writing had been done on the slates\nwhile they were held in mid-air j and a great number of timespertinent\nanswers had been given to questions\u00b7 the nature of which the medium\nhad no means of knowing.\nMr. F. W. H. Myers then made' a few remarks, of which the fol~\nlowing is the substance. .\nWhen the question is raised as to whether an article signed by a\nprivate Member of our Society is to be taken as authoritatively repre-\nsentingthe views of the Society, it is well to remember that the Society\nhaa only one way of expressing itS 'views as a whole, namely, by the\nelection of Members of Council, and by the papers or circulars put forth\nin the name of the Council. No doubtif articles advocating a particular\nset of views were persistently excluded from the Society's publications,\nthe holders of those views might feel that they had cause to complain.\nBut Messrs. M&888Y' and M0888 (wlio have been on the Society's\nCommitteesince its foundation) do not thaa complain, and I think I may\nadd. that I happen to know that they have often been themselves asked\nto write more frequently. In particular, there is, I belieye, a strong\ndesire on the part of many members of the Society to hear more about\nthose very phenomena to which Mr. Koae. has just now alluded. The\ncontemporary notes of those phenomena-with such omissions as the\nprivate character of part of them inight render necessary-would form\nadocument of the utmost value to inquirers. Even the brief account\nof those phenomena which we already possess forms the backbone of\nthe evidence for Spiritualism. It is \\eameatly to be hoped that the\nnotes which Mr. Moses tells us were 80 carefully kept, may be given\nto the world with the completeness and detail which their importance\nimperatively demands. And as regards Mr. EgHnton, Mrs. Sidgwick.\nwho, with Professor Sidgwick, is 1IJl8ble to be present to-night, has\nasked me to say that she is personally anxious that her expression of\nDigitized by Google\n\fviews should not be the only one, but that those who disagree with her\narguments should in their turn write to the Journal, the next number\nof which, it is hoped, will contain Mr. Herschell's let~ in favour of\nthe genuineness of the impugned phenomena. The degree of power\npossessed by conjurers to produce illusion is surely a necessary subject\nof discussion, and one on which it is impossible to attain a clear know-\nledge without personal trial and reference to experts. If Mr.\nEglinton's phenomena are genuine, the discussion of the conditions\nunder which they are obtained may be expected to lead to an improve-\nment in those conditions, from an evidential point of view.\nMr. Mo.ssey has quoted Mrs. Sidgwick's modest estimate of her\nown powers of continuous observation, and has argued that Mr.\nEglinton need not have exercised his 'privilege of failure\" in her\npresence. But remembering that Socrates was pronounced by the\noracle the wisest of men because he was the most conscious of his own\nignorance, we must not argue that Mrs. Sidgwick is a worse observer\nthan other people because she is more fully aware of her own\ndeficiencies.\nAnd meanwhile there is anothet branch of evidence which, if made\nof so.tisfactory strength, would support the distinctly Spiritualistic\nhypothesis far more directly than any physical phenomena. can do, and\nwhich private persons can work at without the need of a professional\n~ediuDl. I mean the attainment through automatic writing of facts\nunknown to any of the persons present. It is alleged by Spiritualists\nthat this frequently occurs, and all Spiritualists, as far as I ha,,-e heard,\nadmit that this is a class of evidence of capital importa.nce totheir theory.\nI have again and again publicly asked for such evidence, but have\nreaped as yet a very scanty harvest. Nor is t~is apparently due to\nreluctance on the part of Spiritualists to send cases to me, for the very\nfew good cases which have reached me have come mainly from\nSpiritualists, and, on the other hand, the Editor of Light, who has made\na similar appeal, has not (judging by the few cases as yet reported in\nhis paper) been more successful than myself. May it not fairly be said\nthat if Spiritualists took more pains to make careful and patient experi-\nments, and to report them at the time with accuracy and detail, they\nwould be taking the best means to further the acceptance of their dis.\ntinctive theories f\nMr. W. !.ant Carpenter would like to ask whether the physiological\nprinciple of \"persistence of vision\" had been taken into' account in\nreference to some of these experiments. It was known that an act\n~hich took place in less than one seventh of a second could not be per-\nceived by huma.n sight. A lighted stick rapidly whirled round, appeared\nto be in all parts of the circle at once, causing the appearance of a\ngitized by (.oogI\n\fJaly, 1888.] JfJW'nalof Socittu for P.\"cI.ical &.eorcll. 345\ncircle of fire. Mr. Oarpenter described a feat performed by the con-\njurer Bosco, in which two sovereigns were made to appear in and\ncJisappear from the palms of his hands, the conjurer bimself being\nabsolutely naked to the waist, and the only perceptible movement was\na slight apparent trembling of both hands. The success of the trick\n'Was de to the extreme rapidity with which the hands were withdrawn\nand again extended, the sovereigns being temporarily concealed under\nthe armpits.\nMr. R. Pearsall Smith (of Philadelphia) called attention to the\neaution required iu judging of uncomprehended phenomena in slate-\nwritiug, produced by those upon whom fraud; had been proyed. He\nealled attention to a Mr. Yeo, who held for sale, at prices ~'arying with\ntheir difficulty, seven ways of.producing phenomena in slate-writing,\nwith the standing offer of a forfeit of .\u00a320 on his failure to reproduce\nany Spiritualistic phenomena after having seen them twice. He also\nread a letter from Professor Fullerton giving unfavourable results of his\ninquiries at Leipzig as to the competency in accurate observation\nof those who had been associated with Professor Zollner in his investi-\ngations, stating that Professor ZoHner was diseased in mind, that one\nof his coadjutors suffered from cataract, and the other was over 80\nyears old. He said that the special\u00b7virtue of true scientific investigation\nwas in the sincere welcome given to authenticated facts for or against\nthe theories under consideration.\nThe President, while endorsing the observation made that Mrs.\nSidgwick's paper was merely the expression of her private opinion, and\nbefore calling upon Mr. Massey for reply, said he would like to make a\nremark or two. In regard to many classes of phenomena, plan::hette-\nwriting for instance, several theories might be brought forward by way\nof explanation. But with slate-writing, it must be either deception, or\nwe were in the presence of novel and very extraordinary phenomena.\nThere was no middle course. If you did not incline towards accept-\ning the reality of the phenomena, you necessarily inclined to the\nconclusion that you were being wilfully deceived. A slate-writing\nmedium must thel-efore take his chance, arid Cannot complain, if by the\nphenomena being disbelieved there\u00b7is an implied reflection cast upon his\nc:haracter.\nIn the next place he had formed the opinion that in investigating\nthese things you could not easily dispense with the services of pro-\nfessional mediums. If you did dispense with them you would obtain\nvery few phenomena to investigate. At the sa~e time he thought there\nwas ODe point in which justice had scarcely been done to Mrs. Sidgwick.\nHe agreed with her that it was extremely desirable that experiments\nshould be so arranged as to a.void the nece88ity for continuous obser-\nDigitized by Google\n\fv.ation. If a medium CAn obtain certain e~ teaults UDder\ncertain conditions, and yet, if he fails to obtain any results when the\nconditions are slightly varied, 80 as to avoidthe l18Ce811ity for continuous\nobservation, it is, to say t.he least, very unfortunate.\nHe agreed with those who thought the idea an unfounded one,.\nthat men of science, or of good observation, were not a match for con-\njurers. It was a point in favour olthe mediums that slate-writing had\nbeen 80 long before the public, and that the means by which it W&8'\ndone had not been indiaputably discovered. He had been present at\ntwo or three seances with Mr. Eglintoo, when the\" conditions bad been\nextremely simple. This simplicity was also a point in the medium's\nfavour, and which would be further strengthened if conjurers should\nprove unable to explain how the result. were obtained.\nHe called on Mr. Massey for any reply that he might wish to lnake\nto the remarks that had been made.\nSeveral questions having been put, Mr. Massey stated. in reply to\none by Mr. Podmore, referring to one of ZOllner's experiments which\nhad been cited. that there was nothinf; to suggest that the particular\"\nexperiment with the leather bands ~ been previously tried. though\"\nthe analogous one of \" knots in an endless cord \" had already succeeded.\nIt was not said when the bands were prepared for the experiment, but\nno doubt it would have been prior to the Bitting. The experiment was\nnot designed to correct defects in fonner conditions, but to clear up a\ndoubt as between two theories of occult agency. The insinuation that\nZollner was insane before his death was absolutely unfounded; there\nwas not the faintest ground for it. One of his coadjutors, the celebrated\nWilhelm Weber, was old, but ZOllner himself was in middle life, and\nin tho possession of all his montal pOwers. No value was to be placed\non second or third-hand reports. No one has ever offered even a\nplausible explanation of the phenomeoa he recorded. and a oelebrated\nGerman conjurer gave it as his opinion that they were not within the\nkingdom of prestidigitation.\n\" PHANTASMS OF THE LIVING.\"\nThe price at which this book (2 y'~ls. octavo) will be issued is one\nguinea.

The house was vory damp.\nand had been unlet for a long time before we took it, which was in 18'11.\nI believe I was the first who I&W anythinA unusual, and it must hava\nbeen in one autumn aftemoon, about 4 p.m. I was paaaing through th&\nhall from the dining-room to the schoolroom, where two doors faced each\nother, and I I&W the figure of a woman, above the medium size, standing 01)\nabout the fourth step from the bot+..om ;,she had her arms folded, and was\ndraped all over (head included) in white; she seemed to be watching me.\nand the thrill that ran through me made me fty into the schoolroom; but.\nalmost immediately after I ran out agiUn to see if it was only faney; and\nfOllDd it had diaappeared. I never mentioned this to the others, or th&\nsern.nta, as I was 80 ashamed uf myselft but told my mother only; but a&\nit proved eventually, it appeared to nearly all in the house. I can only\nrecullectaeeing it about six or seven times altogether, I think, and it was\nnearly always in daylight. One evening when the upper hall was dark I I&W'\nit, and had the counge to follow it, and ran straight against a shut door,\nwhich shock brought me to myself, and it dilappeared. Another aftemoon\nDigitized by Google\n\f348 [.Tal,., 1888.\nI laW it in the drawing-room, and- it ... crouching over the fire ; but I am\nlOrry to say I Wla too great a coward to go up to it, .. I could understand\nthinga appearing at night, but when they came in daylight I could not make\nhead or tail of it.\nAnother peculiar incident took place. Our atore-room 11''' upetaira, iii\nthe basement 11'88 10 dAmp, and my aister had gone upstairs to getlOme wiDe.\nWe heard It. tremendous fall, and running out, found myaiater lyiug at\nthe bottom of tbe atairoaae aurrounded with broken bottles and dibrU. The\nfint thing that au.z:.cted my attention 11'\" this lame figure atanding just\nat the bend of the ataircase, and, -naturally enough, thuught IIhe bad seen\nit there too, and in her frigbt had fallen ; but wben IIbe came to, abe aid\nthat IOmebudy lUld pUllhed her at the bend and IIhe had fallen headlong. I\ndid not mention what I had seen then, aa lOme visitors were with III,\nbut afterwards told ber ;and ahe said abe had not seen anything, but had had\na blow in her back, aud had falleu 10 marvellously that abe had not hnrt\nherself. Some time before this hapllened IIhe had felt a hand laid upon her\nhead in the IIChoolroom, and tumed lIick, and had seen a white figure 80m,\nout of the door. Each one of UII laW this figure without telling the other,\nand each now llervant alao. Our JWDCII were often called, and the voice\nnearlya1waya came from the dining-room. Often and often we lwl &DIIwered\nand gone into the room to find it elllpli)\", aervanta likewise. On going up and\ndown lltairs, with our handa on the banisters, we 80metimes imagined a\neold 10ft hand was laid on them, 80 that I avoided touching the banisters\nat all. We had our heads often touched, and in my case I uaed to feel all\nfive fingers distinctly.\nOne aftemoon, while studying at the acbool\u00b7room table, I had lltopped\nup my ears with my fingers; I felt my head lIeized very roUJth}y, and\nnoticing my lIister had gone to the cupboard bebind me, thought it WIll\nher wbo had touched me, 80 1 moved my head about to eacape her,\nand said .. Don't,\" and was recalled to mYllelf by the goveme... who\ntouched me, and asked what on earth was the matter with nle; and I\nfound out that my sister had been back to her place for lOme time; that\nwas the moat distinct time that I felt it. I saw many otber things, but\nthey had no sequence, and 10 will not be interesting. Our cat was IOme-\ntimes in a great fritrht, her hair aU atanding on end, and grovelliDg;\nbut at thOlle times 11'0 laW nothing, but of course felt\" akeery.\"\nTlte bath-room first attracted my attention. We hadall a great repugnance\n-to enter it, and I was 80 certain that thero 11'811 something uncanny about it.,\nthat I asked mamma if there was a story attached to it. She said \"No.\" Not\n.content with that, I investigated the room, and found out tho door bad been\nforced; and it proved that the lady who lUId had the bouse before UII bad\n-drowned herself in the bath. Now this is a thing I cannot account\nfor. ODe Dight, m&nlIDa 811 uaual wont at the usual hour to have\n1ter bath; and finding to her\u00b7 surprise the door locked, rattled it, and\n:said, \"Cumo, Emmie, I want to come in.\" EIUily replied from the next\nbedroom that she was not there. She tried the door, and then went\nto aoe where my other lIister and I were. . We all came lIut and had a b7\n:at it. 1 must lay I could have awonl the door 11'88 looked; it might haVII\nxot atuckin some peculiar way, but anyhow, after we had all lef~ it\nDigitized by Google\n\fJaJr. 1886.] Journal qf Socil!t!lfor P'!lclJical Re,enrclJ.\nalone it half openedit:lelf. My mothercertainly was puzzled at that, and\nahe was a very practical woman. She never would acknowledge that she\nsaw lUlytbing, but heard all the noiaea that we heard, and said ahe would\nmove out of the house earlier than she intended, because the aerYanta\ndeclared the house 1VB8 haunted, and said they would not atay; and she was\nafraid of ita having a bad efFect upon us. .\nNothing would induce the servanta to atir out of the kitchen or their\nbedroom after 10.30 at night; they barricaded up their door. One night the\ncook, a new servant there, 1VB8 taking up BOme hot-water bottles to our\nroolDB, and on drawing henelf up when she came to the top landing, found\nherself in front of thia white figure; ahe tunled tail and flew for her life to\nthe kitchen. Hearing the noiae, I ran down to aee what was the matter, and\nwe found her white and acared in .the kitchen. We had not told her anything\nabout the house; it is poBBible the other servant may have done 80,\nalthough ahe declared ahe had not. We heard the ruatling of leavtlll, or of\na ailk train on the ataircase at nighta, and that' was the only noise that was\nheard in the lower regiona. The dining-room flat was the noisiest; w.\nheard doon opening and ahutting, or attleaat what BOunded like it, for I used\nto go down BOmetimes to try and discover what it was. The noisea were\ntoo aubstantial to be cats or rata, it was more like the big heavy tahle in\ntlJe dining.room, and the chain being bumped about. At about aix in tlJe\nmorning a heavy bump BOunded, which Ihook the whole houao; in the\ndift\"erent rOOllla it BOunded in different directions; and we never could find\nout what occaaioned it, although we tried to investigate it over and over\nagain. The shock may have taken place in BOme other house, and our\nfoundations being very old, and I dareaay ahaky, it travelled along,\nand BO we heard it; it was like a miniature explolion. We had a\ngreat aversion to the drawing-room, too, and never would ait tllere alone;\nfor we bad a peculiar feeling that BOmebody 1VB8 in tlle room with UI; I often\nthought I 1VB8 touched, and felt BOmebody moving about the room. It W&8\nin that room that I saw a tall blue shape with what looked liko eyel ; but I\nkept looking at it, and it Ilowly disappeared; this was in daylight alBO. Those\neort of ghostly things did not terrify me much, and especially at the last, for\nI was BO certain that Bome trick W08 being played upon us ; and tried to find\nout how tbey appeared. But one ovening I 11'&8 terrified by Bomething out\nof the ordinary. .\nI was all alone in the dining-room one night, as tlJe othen were all\nout at a concert, and the little one had gone to bed. It mUllt havo\nbeen about 9.30 or 10. 1 was working, and\u00b7 was opposite the preas, or\ncupboard, the door of whicb was open. Gradually tlle feeling came over\nme that I was not alone in the room, and that I was being watched, BO that\nI could not help raising my head, and exactly 0ppolite me, just appearing\nround the preBB-door, 11'''1 the face ofa mall-the mOBt wicked andevil-looking\nface I have ever seen, more like a demon's face than anything olle. The\nakin was of ayellowy colour, and it had black hair, moustache and beard~\nThe eyea were fixed upon me, and even as I looked, this awful head projected\nmore round tlledoor, and I saw the neck. There we gazed at each other. I\nwas perfectly frozen with horror, and could not move or speak. As soon ail\nmy senses began to collectthemselves, I thought, that can't be a ghost, for it\u00b7\nDigitized by Google\n\fwn't traaapannt like the othen ; it ...med a IOlid head. for it bid the pan\n.of the door it wu in front of ; 10 1 thought the ~ thing waa to ap.-r ~\nfrigh&eaed, ..

Beyond this, con-\njuring cannot imitate psychography. It can du nothing with locked slates,\nand slates fastened together.

Finally Mrs. Sidpick\n..requires\" teatimony that it,\" the writing, \"had been produced under circum-\n.a~ncea,which dispenaed wi~4 the neceeaity of continuous oheen'ation,\" and\nit is to this last aen~nce I wish mainly to make answer.\u00b7,\nI\u00b7insist that the condition of prolonged and the;refore pl\"Obably fatigued\n~bservation was absent in l8y teat of an &DIlI'er given to a question unknown\nto those in the room, being one chosen at random from six mixed within an\nenvelope, aU of which were writ~n BOme days before on lix identical llips of\npaper. To make the teat clearer I will explain it at grea~r lengtb. The Blips\nwere cut from blank no~-pn.per,and all.clipped down to an identical exactn_\n~f appearance.

After the sitting had commenced, and\nwriting been obtained in the ordinary way, I luddenly prolJOBed this teat to\nMr. Eglinton who at once agreed to lee what could be done. A alate was\nplaced on 1M middlll of tAt table1witk a morael of llellcil-in full daylight of\neourae-and upon it I put one of the llips, question downwards, my fluger\npreaaing the llip to the alate till withdrawn as allother Ilate closed it down,\nthus securiDg the llip from all observation. The llip au placed was chosen\nat random from the onvdope jUlt then taken from my pocket containing lix.\nIt is, 1 think, therefore legitimate for nle to conclude timt 1\\1 lung 1\\1 tllis\nslip was in my fingers, under my own eyel, blank side ul'lJermolt, I. could\nmylIP.lf only gueBB as to which of the Bix queBtiol18 it might be, and further\neould be certain that none other in the 1\"0<)01 knew anything at all I)f ita\nnature.
