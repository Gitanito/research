Their names and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly accounts for October and November, 1908,\nwere presented and read.\nPEIVATE MEETING FOE MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.\nThe 25th Private Meeting for Members and Associates only was\nheld in the large Hall, at 20 Hanover Square, London, W., on\nMonday, December 14th, 1908, at 4 p.m. ; the President, Mrs.\nHenry Sidgwick, in the Chair.\nThe meeting was devoted to the discussion of \" Cross-Corre-\nspondences.\" The President, having explained that the papers\non the subject about to be read by Mr. Podmore, Mr. Dickinson,\nand Mr. Constable were written independently of one another,\nand that therefore for any completion of the discussion it would\nbe necessary to look to other speakers, called on Mr. Podmore to\nread the first paper, which was as follows\nBy Frank Podmore.\nFor the benefit of those who are not thoroughly familiar with\nthe previous reports upon the subject, it will probably be\nconvenient if I briefly recapitulate the steps already taken in the\ninvestigation of cross-correspondences.\nThe attempts so far made to decipher the contents of sealed\nenvelopes have failed. It is doubtful whether, even if successful,\nthey would have afforded convincing proof of the survival of\n\f4 Joum-d of Society for Psychical Resectrch. Jan., 1909.\nhuman personality. Nor can proof of the kind required be\nfound in references to past events in the lives of the supposed\ncommunicators. We can never exclude the possibility that\nknowledge of such past events may have been derived from\nliving minds. A similar objection applies to the simpler form\nof cross-correspondences, the attempt to get a test word or phrase\nreproduced by two or more different mediums. Broadly speaking,\nthe proof of human survival can be found only in intelligent\naction on the part of discarnate spii'its in the present.\nA study of the earlier scripts of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Holland\nand Mrs. Forbes suo\"ested to Miss Johnson that traces of\nsuch intelligent action, the action of an intelligence not that\nof any of the automatists, could be found in certain cross-\ncorrespondences occurring in these scripts. In Miss Johnson's\nwords :\n\" The characteristic of these cases is that we do not\nget in the writing of one automatist anything like a verbal\nreproduction of phrases in the others : we do not even get\nthe same idea expressed in different ways, as might well\nresult from direct telepathy between them. What we get is\na fragmentary utterance in one script, which seems to have\nno particular point or meaning, and another fragmentary\nutterance in the other, of an equally pointless character\nbut when we put the two together, we see that they supple-\nment one another and that there is apparently one coherent\nidea underlying both, but only partially expressed in each.\"\nTwo examples of this kind of cross-correspondence may be\nbriefly recalled to memory. On August 28th, 1901, Mrs.\nForbes wrote a message purporting to come from her son\nTalbot, to the effect that he was going to control a\nsensitive who wrote automatically, in order that he might\nobtain corroboration of Mrs. Forbes's writing. On the same\nday Mrs. Verrall wrote in Latin :\n\" Sign with a seal. The\nfir tree already planted in the garden gives its own portent.\"\nThe script was signed with a rough drawing of a sword, a\nsuspended bugle and two other figures. This script remained\nwithout meaning for Mrs. Verrall until months later she\nlearnt that there were fir trees in Mrs. Forbes's garden specially\nconnected with her son, and that the badge of his regiment\nwas a suspended bixgle surmounted by a crown (Proc.\nVol. XX. p. 223). In another case, Mrs. Verrall, on\n\fI\nJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 5\nMarch 2ncl, 4th, and 5th, 1906, wrote several messages,\nchiefly in Latin, which showed no inteUigible connection to\nher mind, but which suggested to Dr. Verrall liuphael's picture\nof Attila before the gates of Eome. On March 7 th, two days\nlater, Mrs. Holland wrote, \" Ave Eoma immortalis. How could\nI m.ake it any clearer without giving her the clue ? \" (Proc.\nPart LV. p. 297).\nThat these enigmatic cross-correspondences were not elaborated\nby the conscious intelligence of either automatist seems clear.\nBut Miss Johnson points out another significant circumstance.\nScattered through the script of the automatists, and generally\nin close connection with cases of cross-correspondence, are many\nphrases which, like that quoted from Mrs. Holland, \" How could\n1 make it any clearer without giving her the clue ?\n\" seem to\nimply a deliberate design of composing enigmas, the answers\nto which should be found only by \" piecing together,\" or \" weav-\ning together \" tlie corresponding parts of scripts produced by\ndifferent hands. These frequent references, coupled with the\nillustrations of the process actually found in the script, seemed\nto justify Miss Johnson in suggesting \" that one and the same\nintelligence, or group of co-operating intelligences, was responsible\nboth for the cross-correspondences and for the contemporary\ncomments on them\" {Proc. Part LV. p. 391).\nMiss Johnson's theory, it will be remembered, was based on\nthe study of scripts by Mrs. Verrall and others, written before\nthe important series of experiments with Mrs. Piper which began\nin November 1906. If we now endeavour to test the theory\nby means of the scripts written during Mrs. Piper's stay in this\ncountry, we find, in the first place, that with few exceptions the\nsuccessful cross-correspondences recounted in Mr. Piddington's\npaper are clearly not of the complex type described by Miss\nJohnson ; and in the second place that the intelligences of Mrs.\nPiper's trance show nowhere any explicit knowledge of the\ntheory of cross-correspondences.\nAt the first sitting with Mrs. Piper, Sir Oliver Lodge\nsuggested to the Piper-Hodgson that a cross-correspondence\nexperiment should be made. The control agreed, and chose\nthe words St. Paul. The experim.ent was successful. The next\nsuccessful cross-correspondence consisted of the words Frwncis\nand Ignatius : the third, of a geometrical figure \u2014a triangle\n\f6 Jdx.rnal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., i909.\ninscribed in a circle\u2014which was suggested by Mr. Piddiugton,\nand successfully transferred to Mrs. Verrall. The fourth, the\nword Stayplc, was apparently inspired by a recent dream of Mr.\nPiddington's. These all are correspondences of the simplest\npossible kind. From this point onwards, however, it will no\ndoubt have been observed that the correspondences are for the\nmost part of one uniform type. An idea occurs first in Mrs.\nVerrall's script, and is repeated with several variations, as if for the\npurpose of emphasis. A few hours, days, or weeks later, the same\nidea, generally in the form of a single word, is given in Mrs. Piper's\nscript, or is spoken by her on coming out of the trance.\nThus, to quote an instance, at 11 a.m. on the 11th March,\n1907, Mrs. Verrall wrote a passage harping on the word\nviolet, in which the following phrases occur :\n\" with violet\nbuds,\" \" violacese,\" \" violet and olive leaf, purple and hoary,\"\n\" the city of the violet and olive crown.\" On the same day,\ntwo hours later, Mrs. Piper in the waking stage ejaculated\nViolets. Mrs. Piper's part of the cross-correspondence is\nnearly always later than Mrs. Verrall's, and is always quite\nsimple and straightforward, consisting usually of a single word.\nIn Mrs. Verrall's script not only, as readers will have seen, is\nthe idea emphasised by repetition and variation, but in some cases\nthe actual word suggested by the script, which emerges subse-\nquently in Mrs. Piper's trance, is not given\u2014is indeed, it would\nalmost seem, deliberately suppressed. Thus, on 3rd April, 1907,\nMrs. Verrall wrote several phrases about wings, \" and with\ntwain he covered his face,\" \" the hosts of heaven,\" \" his flame-\nclad messengers,\" and finally draws a winged human figure.\nFive days later, one of Mrs. Piper's controls announced :\n\" I\ngave angel,\" meaning apparently \"I gave anycl to Mrs. Verrall,\nas the subject of a cross-correspondence.\" In another case Mrs.\nVerrall's script is full of imagery and allusions conveying the\nidea of death ; but the word death seems to be deliberately\navoided. Thus, the quotation :\n\" Come away, come away,\" breaks\noff short before the significant word is reached.\nNow these, and one or two other cases of the kind, unques-\ntionably suggest design. It looks like an attempt at the kind\nof cross-correspondence described by Miss Johnson. But if\nthere is design, it must be recognised that the design has\nfailed ; the allusions are not sufficiently enigmatic. In the\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 7\nlast case, it will be remembered, Mrs. Verrall at once inter-\npreted her script as alluding to Death.\nFurthermore, it would appear from the last quoted instance\nthat some, at any rate, of the allusive references are not\ndue to an external intelligence : for two of the allusions to\nDeath are personal to Mrs. Verrall, and would be meaningless\nto an outsider. There is one case, moreover, which is still\nmore significant in this connection. On Feb. 19th, 1907,\nMr. Piddington suggested Giant and Dwarf as the subject\nof a cross-correspondence expei'iment with Mrs. Verrall. Mrs.\nPiper's control accepted the suggestion, and said he would\ngo off at once to execute it. Later, the controls repeatedly\nclaimed to have been successful in transferring Dwarf. Mrs.\nVerrall, who was not told of the date of the experiment,\ntwice searched the whole of her script written during that period.\nOn the first occasion, she failed to find any allusion to\nDwarf. On the second occasion, still in ignorance of the date,\nshe found in the script of the 19th Feb., written a few hours\nonly after the suggestion had been given to Mrs. Piper, an\nallusion to Dwarf which had escaped her original scrutiny.\nThe allusion is contained in the words :\n\" A long featiier.\nAsk about the feather,\nUp the mountain\u2014no, that is\nOwl's feather ; not what I want.\"\n\" Up the mountain \" and \" owl's feather \" suggested to Mrs.\nVerrall, it will be remembered, a very familiar poem, dealing\nwith little men, wee folk, or, in other words, fairies. The\ncoincidence in time is here so close that it seems probable\nthat Mrs. Verrall's script is actually connected with the Dwarf\nof the experiment ; and it would seem at first sight that we\nhave found here a cross-correspondence of the kind desired : an\nallusion artfully concealed even from the automatist herself.\nBut if there were indeed design in this instance, it was not\nthe design of external intelligence. For what the Piper controls\nrepeatedly claimed to have impressed on Mrs. Verrall was not\nthe idea of Dwarf, but the actual letters of the word\u2014D.W.Pi.F.\nSo that the imagery in the case was unquestionably supplied\nby the mind of the automatist.\nFew, then, of these later experiments have even a friria\n\f8 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. Jan., 1 909.\nfacie claim tu be cross-correspondences of the complex kind\ndescribed by Miss Johnson. But the theory, it will be remem-\nbered, was based not merely on a study of individual cases,\nbut on numerous allusions made by the controls.\nIf the theory is correct, we should expect to find that\nthe Piper controls\u2014some of whom purport to be identical with\nthe intelligences controlling the other automatists referred to\nwould be well acquainted with the scheme of complex cross-\ncorrespondences. It is, of course, on the theory, a scheme of\ntheir own invention.\nIn connection with this subject let me call your attention\nto the test message and its reception by the Piper controls : \u2014\n\" We are aware of the scheme of cross-correspondences which\nyou are transmitting through various mediums, and we hope\nthat you will go on with them. Try also to give to A and\nB two different messages, between which no connexion is dis-\ncernible. Then as soon as possible give to C a third message\nwhich will reveal the hidden connexion.\"\nThis message was translated into classical Latin, and repeatedly\ndictated word by word at several successive seances to the\ncontrols. The dictation began on the 17th December, 1906,\nand was not completed until the 2nd January, 1907. The\nLatin is so worded that a person ignorant of the language,,\nor even a lower-form schoolboy armed with a dictionary,\nwould be unlikely to arrive at the meaning of the whole passage.\nOn Jan. 16th, a fortnight after the completion of the Latin\nmessage, and before a translation was attempted, Mr. Piddington\ntells us that he impressed on the Piper-Myers the import-\nance of cross-correspondent messages, and expressed the opinion\nthat it was \" more important to get them than for you\nspirits to give facts about your past lives.\" To that the\nPiper-Myers replied by asking why so much importance was\nattached to cross-correspondences : for, said he, \" if you estab-\nlish telepathic messages, you will doubtless attribute all such\nto thoughts from those living in the mortal body\" (p. 318).\nThis answer, as Mr. Piddington points out, shows intelligence.\nBut it is not, I submit, the intelligence that we should\nexpect on the hypothesis that this Piper-Myers is identical\nwith the Verrall-Myers. For the answer shows conclusively,\nfirst, that the Piper-Myers had not grasped the plan of complex\n\f\/\nJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 9\ncross-correspondences, which the Verrall-Myers, according to the\nhypothesis, had been actively elaborating for some years previ-\nously; and secondly, that the Piper-Myers, at that date, 16th Jan.,\n1907, had not yet succeeded in translating the Latin message.\nThe Piper-Myers makes his first attempt to translate the Latin\nmessage on the 20th Feb., more than a mouth later. \" It is\nwith reference,\" he says, \" to my being a messenger and my\nhanding through to you coherent . . . messages\" (p. 330).\nA few days later, on Feb. 27th, the Piper-Myers writes:\n\" I feel a little perturbed over your message to me when you\nsaid I [failed] in replying sufficiently to convince you, etc.,\nalthough I, as intermediary, had long since united my ideas.\"\nLater in the same sitting he makes it clear that this passage\nwas intended for a translation of the Latin message: for he\nnow gives the translation as follows :\n\" Although you as intermediary have long since united mutually\nideas. You have or do not reply or respond sufficieutly to our\nquestions as to convince us of your existence\" (pp. 332-3)\nThese replies show unmistakable knowledge of the meanin\"\nof some of the individual Latin words, and equally unmistak-\nable ignorance of the meaning of the passage as a whole.\nThere is, it will be seen, no reference to cross-correspondences.\nLater the trance intelligence seems to have connected the Latin\nmessage with cross-correspondences, as indeed under the cir-\ncumstances it or they could hardly fail to do. But it would\nnot appear that the true meaning, or an approximation to\nthe true meaning, was ever grasped. Thus, so late as the\n27th May, 1907, the Piper-Myers gives as the translation\nof the Latin message the following :\n\" You have long since\nbeen trying to assimilate ideas, but I wish you to give through\nMrs. Verrall proof of the survival of bodily death in such a\nway as to make it conclusive\"; and then adds, \"He mentioned\nmy own words in it, viz. the Survival of P>odily death,\" i.e.\nwords forming part of the title of Myers' last work (p. 394).\nTo sum up. It would appear from the reception of the\nLatin message that the Piper controls, though they had somehow\nacquired a knowledge of the meaning of individual words, are\nunable to construe a Latin sentence, and are reduced to\nguesswork. It appears, further, that they have not grasped\nthe scheme of complex cross-correspondences. Finally, the\na2\n\f10 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\ngreat majority of the individual cross-correspondences fail to\nconform to the complex type. On the other hand, there\nare clear traces of attempts to bring about such conformity\nby involving the idea in enigmatic allusions ; and the source\nof these enigmatic allusions can in some cases be clearly\ntraced to the mind of the automatist.\nI do not claim that this summary criticism covers the\nwhole ground. There are some four or five cross-correspondences\nwhich do not obviously fall into the category described. But\nthe details in these cases are extremely complicated, and the\ninterpretation is not merely difficult but ambiguous. Because\nthey are ambiguous the clue to the interpretation of these more\nelaborate cases must, it seems clear, be sought in the first instance\nin the analysis of the simpler instances of cross-correspondence.\nWe must proceed from the simple to the complex.\n(2)\nBy G. Lowes Dickinson.\nIn discussing this subject the whole of the evidence contained\nin Parts LIU., LV., LVII. of the Proceedings ought to be\nbrought under review. In the present paper limitations of\ntime have compelled me to confine myself to the evidence\npresented in Mr. Piddington's paper (Part LVII.) and to\ndeal with that in a very summary manner. Four hypotheses\nnaturally present themselves as accounting severally or jointly\nfor the phenomena to be discussed: (1) Fraud, (2) Coincidence,\n(3) Telepathy, ('4) a controlling intelligence or intelligences.\n(1) Fraud I do not consider : partly because it is ruled\nout by all who know Mrs. Piper and the other automatists\nconcerned ; but mainly because it could not explain the\ncross-correspondences, unless it were joint-fraud, or conspiracy\na hypothesis which I believe in the present case, no one\nwould seriously put forward.\n(2) Coincidence. The difficulty here is to determine the\nprobability of coincidence. Perhaps no more can be said than\nthat the probability increases (1) with the length of time\nintervening between the dates of the corresponding scripts,\n(2) with the commonness of the word or idea reproduced,\n(3) with the lack of precision in the correspondence. For\nexample, taken by itself, such a correspondence as the word\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 11\nmountain given by Mrs. Piper on various occasions in March,\nApril, and May, with the phrase \" the storied mount \" in Mrs.\nVerrall's script of April 6th (see pp. 230-7), would naturally\nbe explained by coincidence.\nOn the other hand, in the evidence before us, the corre-\nspondences are sometimes precise, almost coincident in time,\nand dealing with topics not very obvious. Thus on April\n8 th at 7 a.m. Mrs. Holland in India writes\n\u2014\"do you\nremember that exquisite sky when the afterglow made the\neast as beautiful and as richly coloured as the west\" (p. 265).\nOn the same day between 11.30 a.m. and 1.10 p.m. Mrs.\nPiper emerging from her trance gave the phrase \" light in west\n(p. 269). On the same day at 3.10 p.m. Mrs. Verrall wrote\n\" the words were from Maud but you did not understand.\nRosy is the east and so on\" (p. 271);\u2014a reference (with\nsubstitution of the word east i'ov luest) to the well-known\nlyric in MaAid. Here, even if these data be taken in\nisolation, the explanation by coincidence seems improbable.\nBut to isolate the data is to distort the evidence. Eor Mr.\nPiddington has been able to work out a connection between\na number of inter-related topics, of which the above is only\none, distributed among four different automatists. The chain\nof connection is too complicated to be reproduced here. But\nI presume it has been studied by most of those present ; and\nI hardly think that any one who has studied it will hold\nthat coincidence is a plausible explanation of the phenomena.\n(3) Telepathy, on the other hand, can put in a very serious\nclaim ; and if that hypothesis be indefinitely extended it might\nbe held to be a sufficient explanation of all the facts. Some\nof the facts are explicable by direct telepathy from an agent\nto a percipient present in the same room. In these cases\n(1) the agent may consciously have in his mind a word or\nidea, and desire to elicit it from the percipient. When, for\nexample, Mrs. Piper gave Plotinus, the author of the Greek\nquotation auro? o'upavo<s aKVfxwv (p. 170) Mrs. Sidgwick, the\nsitter, it must be presumed, had the name in her mind and\ndesired to get it. The same remark applies to the appearance\nof the name Aht Vogler at another sitting where also Mrs.\nSidgwick was the sitter (p. 373). (2) The agent may not\nconsciously have in his mind the words or ideas elicited ; but\n\f12 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nthe telepathy may proceed from his sub-conscious self. Thus\ntelepathy is a possible explanation in the cases where Mrs.\nPiper gives correspondences with passages in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript which the sitter has read, even though he may have\nforgotten them. I may quote as an example the correspondence\nof the words uttered by Mrs. Piper on emerging from her\ntrance on March 6th \"moaning at the bar when I put out to\nsea\" (p. 150) with the words written by Mrs. Verrall on\nFeb. 26th \"and may there be no moaning at the bar\" (p. 114).\n\u2014Mr. Piddington having read that script before his sitting\nwith Mrs. Piper on March 6 th.\n(2) The agent and percipient may be separated by a\nconsiderable distance ; and there may be no conscious attempt\nto transmit nor any presence in the normal consciousness of\nthe ideas actually transmitted. This is clearly a great extension\nof the hypothesis of telepathy ; but it is necessary if some of\nthe facts are to be explained by that hypothesis.\nE.g. On Jan. 23rd Mrs. Verrall wrote \" Eats star tars and\nso on,\" and also '\"'\nKTATS rearrange these five letters or\nao-ain tears\nstare \"\n(p. 61).\nOn Jan. 28th she wrote \"Aster\" (p. 62).\nAnd on Feb. I7th Miss Verrall wrote\n\" a star above it all\nrats everywhere in Hamelin town.\" And also the word arts\n(p. 68).\nIf this is to be explained by telepathy, it is unintentional\ntelepathy from a distance and it is delayed. There is however\nanother correspondence in connection with this anagram which\nis still more remarkable on the hypothesis of telepathy.\nAmong the late Mr. Hodgson's papers, at that time in\nAmerica, was one containing the same anagrams, viz., EATES,\nSTAEE, TEAES, TAEES, ASTEE and STAE, TAES, EATS,\nAETS (p. 65). Mr. Piddington had seen, but forgotten a paper\nof Mr. Hodgson's containing the latter of these anagrams ; he\ndoes not believe that he had seen the former. If he had\nnot, the telepathy must be supposed to proceed from some\nother person unknown who had seen Mr. Hodgson's papers.\nIf he had, the telepathy may be supposed to proceed from\nhim, but without any knowledge or intention on his part.\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 13\nIn this case, on the hypothesis of telepathy, certain words\nare transmitted unchanged, but in others, and the majority of\ncases contained in this volume, and in the preceding ones\nedited by Mrs. Verrall and Miss Johnson, instead of a direct\nreproduction of simple words or ideas we have an interchange\nof often remote and recondite allusions. Thus, to refer to\nMr. Piddington's most complicated case, there appear, in Mrs.\nHolland's script of April 8th, the words \" east and west,\nMartha and Mary, Leah and Eachel,\" and \" Paradiso \" (p.\n265). Leah and Eachel as types of the contemplative and\nthe active life, also commonly typified by east and west, are\nthe subject of a vision dreamt by Dante previous to his\npassing through the fire and entering the Earthly Paradise.\nIn the cantos of the Purgatorio dealing with this episode occur\nthe words \" GEEYON, CYTHEEEA, HELLESPONT\" which\nhave occurred in the scripts of the other automatists and are\nrelated by a complex series of associations which Mr. Piddington\nhas traced. If telepathy be the explanation here, we must\nsuppose a number of ideas to be unconsciously and uninten-\ntionally transmitted by an automatist in England to an\nautomatist in India and to emerge there in the form of a\nremote and recondite literary allusion. This, I should say,\nis about the furthest possible extension of the hypothesis of\nTelepathy. In my own opinion it is an extension beyond\nwhat is probable, and the cases to which I have referred,\ntaken in connection with others, compel me to have recourse to\nthe fourth hypothesis of a directing intelligence or intelligences.\n(4) This hypothesis does not exclude telepathy; but it supposes\nthat the telepathy is deliberately controlled by some intelligence\nwhich is not the normal intelligence of any of the automatists.\nThe question remains what intelligence ? Broadly there are\ntwo possibilities. The intelligence may be\u2014what it purports\nto be\u2014that of a person or group of persons deceased ; or it\nmay be the sub-conscious intelligence of some living person or\npersons\u2014for example, of one of the automatists\u2014dramatically\nimpersonating persons deceased. This latter hypothesis it would\nbe, so far as I can judge, impossible definitely to set aside. Not\nonly does demonstration in matters so new and strange appear to\nbe impossible, but common sense can hardly apply the ordinary\ncriteria of probability. Still there are certain considerations\n\f14 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nthat naturally suggest themselves. In favour of the hypothesis\nthat the controlling intelligence is what it purports to be, we\nhave: (1) The fact that this is suggested throughout by the\nform of the script. This, of course, is not conclusive evidence.\nThe possibilities of dramatisation by the sub-conscious self\nappear to be very extensive, and I don't know that we can\nset a limit to them. At the same time I am myself, as I\nread the evidence, very much impressed by the vraiscmblance\nof the spiritistic hypotliesis ; and especially by the utterances\nof Mrs. Piper when she emerges from trance. And I think\nthat this is a kind of evidence which must be taken into account.\n(2) We know that the group of persons who purport to com-\nmunicate were intensely interested in the question of the\nsurvival of bodily death and were in a sense pledged, if they\nsurvived, to endeavour to give us evidence of the fact (see\nProceedings, Part LV. p. 375). The kind of phenomena we\nare now getting are, I think it may be claimed, such as\nwould be produced by intelligent people anxious to demonstrate\ntheir existence and their agency but working in a very diffi-\ncult element. Miss Johnson has worked out this point in her\npaper on Mrs. Holland's script, and I need not elaborate it here.\nOn the other hand, the hypothesis that the persons professing\nto communicate really do communicate is one which most\npeople find it difficult even provisionally to accept. This is\ndue partly to the confusion of the script. That, however,\nis not x'eally a strong objection, for it is easy to suggest\nreasons for the confusion, such for example as those put\nforward by Dr. Hodgson in his paper on the Piper phenomena\n{Proceedings, Vol. XIII. pp. 357-406). Partly the difficulty\nis due to the failure of the supposed Controls to give inform-\nation for which they are asked. Why, for example, should\nMyers, if Myers it were, be unable to give a simple reference\nto Horace, Odes, i. 28, when elsewhere he has given quite\nclearly references to the New Testament ? Why cannot he\ntranslate accurately the simple phrase uvto? oupuvo? ukuixwv\ninstead of paraphrasing its meaning in the words Cloudless\nSky Horizon ? Why cannot he translate the Latin Message\ninstead of giving a very loose suggestion of some part of its\nmeaning ? I do not, however, myself lay much stress on\nthese points, because we know so little about the conditions\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 15\nof communicatioa with spirits, supposing such communication\nto be possible. What really makes people hesitate to adopt,\neven provisionally, the spiritistic hypothesis is a great\nweight of prejudice against it. The grounds and justification\nof this prejudice cannot be here discussed. I will only say\nin conclusion that I regard it as unscientific and unphilosophical\nand that I think the question ought to be approached with a\nquite open mind, without any bias against the spiritistic view.\n(3)\nBy F. C. Constable.\nA CYNIC has said that human beings cannot reason : that\nall they can do is to produce arguments in support of their\npersonal prejudices or, perhaps, what we may more courteously\nterm, their preconceived ideas. Out of respect, then, for the\npreconceived ideas of those who may listen, I must state,\nat the outset, two personal prejudices which govern the argu-\nments I shall adduce to-ni\"ht.\nThe first is that I am foolish enough to think I do not\nbelieve but know we have continued personal existence after\nthe dissolution of the body in a higher form than that of\nhuman personality.\nThe second is involved in the first : the survival of human\npersonality after death is, to me, impossible. There are very\nmany, of whom I am one, who believe that human personality\nis no more than a passing manifestation in our time and\nspace of some real personality, and that it is this person-\nality which survives the dissolution of the body, the brain\nand human ideas. Myers himself said, \" If an immortal\nsoul there be within us, she must be able to dispense with\npart of the brain's help while the brain is living, as with the\nwhole of its help when it is dead.\" {Proceedings S.P.E., Vol.\nIV. p. 260.)\nWhat do we mean by human personality ?\nIf we consider any number of children at the moment\nof birth, we do not speak of their human personalities : their\nhuman personalities are potential only. What they may be\nat manhood depends largely on environments of wealth or\npoverty, social status and personal opportunity. Xo one, for\ninstance, would deny that the human personality of a Myers\n\f16 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nor Gurney was in great part the result of personal environ-\nments of comparative wealth, social status and opportunity.\nNo one, on the other hand, would deny that many a child\nwho has grown up into a man, absorbed through life in the\nmindless labour of the plough, might, if born under a luckier\nstar, have evolved into a human personality marked by full\nintellectual development.\nHuman personalities, then, appear to many of us to be\nin great measure subjects of the environments of our universe\nin time and space : each human personality appears to be\ndistinct from all others only because of the particular evolved\nformation of the material brain of the particular individual.\nSo we cannot believe in the survival of human personality\nafter the dissolution of the material brain.\nMany of us, also, find in the fact that only the very few\nhave opportunity of evolving into the higher forms of human\npersonality, that which, on its face, marks an inherent injustice\nin the scheme of nature. If, however, we make the intellectual\nin humanity subjective to what\u2014for want of better words in\ndefinition\u2014we may term \" will and idea,\" then, possibly, we\ndestroy the reality of this inherent injustice. I submit that\nSchopenhauer's expansion of Kant's reasoning in the Critiqtte\ndoes not involve us in pessimism. It points rather to Death\nas the Supreme arbitrator between good and evil, those principles\nof contradiction which are always at strife in our phenomenal\nuniverse.\nDeath is the one touch of nature which makes the whole\nworld kin. Death, by dissolving our bodies and our brains,\nfrees us from bondage to earth and earthly ideas and sets\nus on a wider, spiritual path, where brotherly love and universal\nsympathy are free and unfettered. Eansomed by Death, we\nat last find our own full self-consciousness. And we find it\nnot in ourselves but in others.\n\" To see the world in a grain of sand\nAnd a heaven in a wild flower;\nHold infinity in the palm of your hand\nAnd eternity in an hour.\"\nWeighted by these prejudices I turn to the question of cross-\ncorrespondence.\nWe have reports before us, all admirable, from Mrs. Verrall,\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for 31emhers mid Associates. 17\nMiss Johnson, and Mr. Piddington. But as that of Mr.\nPiddington makes most strongly for the theory that human\npersonality survives, and as I am limited in time, I confine\nmyself to a consideration of Mr. Piddington's paper. It must\nbe remembered, however, that we have not Mrs. Piper's full\nscript before us : it is given to us only in isolated passages.\nAnd these passages are isolated solely for the purpose of\nillustration and support to Mr. Piddington's strenuous and\nvaluable labour in arriving at explicit cross-correspondences.\nThe full script would be required before it could be used\nas evidence in support of the fact of our communion with the\ndisembodied as personalities higher in form than human per-\nsonalities. But, even as offered to us, I doubt that it supports\nany theory of the survival of human personality, tlrough it\nmay possibly favour some theory of the survival of higher forms\nof personality.\nIf human personalities survive, then they are\nthings of cognition lilvc to ourselves. They think in succession\njust as we think, they have ideas in succession as we have ideas.\nAnd they have memory i7i succession like to ourselves.\nIf, then, these human personalities survive we are justified\nin assuming there can be, w\"hat is ordinarily termed, direct\ntransference of ideas between them and us.\nBut, if this be so, why is it we never find from them\na direct answer ear-marked to a direct question ? iS^ever\na simple and direct correspondence ear-marked between the\nscript of two automatic writers ? Between the living we\ndo get this (apparent) direct transference of ideas\u2014note, for\nexample. Miss Eamsden's experiment of the white pig with a\nlong snout\u2014but I cannot find it between the living and the\ndisembodied.\nLet us assume that Myers, for instance, survives as a human\npersonality and judge the recorded facts by the light of that\nassumption.\nNow Myers in these experiments is treated at the outset\n(with Mrs. Piper) as a human personality who can deal with\nwords as distinct from feeling or emotion. And he assumes\nto deal with icorcls. For instance (p. 236) he gives to Mrs.\nPiper twelve words,\u2014lakes, rivers, etc.,\u2014which he says he has\nmade or will make Mrs. Verrall write. That is, he can think\n\f18 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nthese 12 words, he can tell Mrs. Piper the 12 words he has\nthought of, he can tell her he intends to give or has given\nthem in writing to Mrs. Verrall.\nThen, when he gives some of these words to Mrs. Verrall\nwhy can he not ear-mark the words he has given as those\nhe wanted to give ? He does not do so in any case : at\ntimes, he even leaves Mrs. Verrall in sheer ignorance of what\nhe has done and depends on the extraordinary ingenuity of\nMr. Piddington to pick out, from a number of others, the\nwords intended to be transferred, or to arrive at the fact that\ncross-correspondence exists by recondite analogy.\nWhy can he not do with Mrs. Verrall what he has done\nwith Mrs. Piper ? And, surely, if he gave the same word\nexplicitly to Mrs. Verrall that he gave to Mrs. Piper, the\nevidence of his personal interference would be in form far\nstronger than it, in fact, is (p. 319).\nIt is no reply to say \" the difficulty lies in the transfer.\"\nIf Myers can give a word so definitely to one, there is no\nreason why he should not if a human personality\u2014give it\nas definitely to another. There is not, I think, one case of a\nclear answer ear-marked to a clear question : not one case, for\ninstance, where Myers makes Mrs. Piper write, \" I shall transfer\nthe word crystal to Mrs. Verrall\n;\n\" and makes Mrs. Verrall\nwrite, \" Crystal. Tliis word I have transferred to you from\nMrs. Piper.\"\nAgain, in the avro^ ovpavo^ aKvfxcov case, Myers ab first\nvery definitely and persistingly gives Homer's Illiard {sic)\n(p. 166) as the reply to the request for the author's name.\nWho made the mistake ? Myers ? Ultimately Myers gives the\ncorrect reply \" Plotinus.\" And he expresses great pleasure at\nhis success. But how did he know of the success ? Because\nhe was told he had succeeded. If he had been told Homer's\nIlliard was the correct answer, 1 think we must assume he\nwould have expressed the same pleasure in assumed success.\nI cannot find evidence that he knew Plotinus was the right\nand Homer's \" Illiard \" the wrong reply : as a human personality\nhe appears not to be objective but fully subjective\u2014his very\npersonal belief appears to depend on what human beings tell him.\nBut this question of Myers's human personality being sub-\njective to Mrs. Piper or others, as the case may be, has been\n\fJax., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 19\nconsidered by other speakers. So I shall now only refer to\nMrs. Verrall's script.\nWhat is it that has obliged Mr. Piddington to enter on\nheavy labour which has involved long time , and strenuous\nintellectual expenditure in the unearthing of these correspond-\nences ? It is not that he finds any difficulty with Mrs. Piper\nfor, with her, the words, the subjects of experiment, are given\nexplicitly. His difficulty is with Mrs. Verrall. And that\narises from the fact that the words are given to her, not\nexplicitly, but implicitly.\nNow consider Mrs. Verrall's script. It consists of (1) passages\nfrom authors known to her, more or less correctly recorded,\n(2) apparently original imaginative productions for which she\nmust have used memory, (3) broken, scrappy sentences which,\nhowever, generally relate to what is in her memory or result\nfrom the play of her imagination with what is in her memory.\nIn this script Mr. Piddington sometimes finds the word\nwanted. But, I think, whether or not he finds the word wanted,\nthe script itself in most of the cases turns on some general\nunderlying idea in which the word wanted is involved.\nFor instance, consider the script on the bottom of page 196.\nThe word Mr. Piddington wants is \" Diana.\" The word Diana\nis itself given, but the script turns on a general idea relating\nto Diana.\n(In the \" thanatos \" case (p. 302) Mr. Piddington says that if\nthe subject of Death was inspired in Mrs. Verrall from the outside,\nwe must conclude that the form was, in part at least, deter-\nmined by the automatist's own mind. I agree, but say the form\nwas altogether determined by Mrs. Verrall's understanding.)\nNow all that appears in Mrs. Verrall's script was in her\npotential memory before she wrote it, except where the script\nshows also the play of her imagination with her memory. There-\nfore Myers did not originate the script. All he can have done\nis to have so affected Mrs. Verrall that she recalled in present\nmemory the particular passages, or that she exercised her own\nimagination in a particular way. Mrs. Verrall exercised\nthroughout her oum understanding (Cousin's reminiscence)\nMyers's influence (if any) was in affect 07i her understanding.\nBear in mind there is no magic in the writing itself : that\nresulted merely from Mrs. A-^errall's exercise of an acquired\n\f20 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Jan., 1909.\nart ; even Mrs. Piper could not have written or spoken as she\nhas if she had not acquired the art of writing or speaking.\nI have argued against the view that the evidence before\nus suggests communication from the disembodied as human\npersonalities. But the evidence of implicit, not explicit corre-\nspondence, remains to be accounted for.\nIf the disembodied exist in a state and universe free from oxtr\nlimitations of time and space we can still well imagine that\nthey may have power to project themselves\u2014for communication\nwith us\u2014on to our limited universe, and speak and appear to\nus as human personalities. And, too, I think, we can well\nimagine their finer and fuller minds can use our minds for\ncommunication with us. The disembodied cannot use their\nown great organs of mind, with infinite continuum of sound, to\ngive us music. They must play on the lilliputian human\norgans, with their finite limits of discrete tones, to make music\ncomprehensible to us : they can communicate with us implicitly,\nnot explicitly.\nI find, though but dimly, evidence in the cases we consider\nof directive influence from the disembodied.\nA discussion followed these papers.\nMi;. J. G. Piddington said : I shall try to make my\nobservations on the three papers to which we have just\nlistened as concise as possible. I shall deal with the papers\nin the order in which they were read.\nMr. Podmore says that with the exception of \" St. Paul,\"\n\" Francis and Ignatius,\" \" Triangle within a circle \" and\n\" Steeple, '\nthe cross-correspondences \" are of one uniform\ntype. An idea occurs first in Mrs. Verrall's script. . . .\nLater the same idea is given in Mrs. Piper's script.\" It is\ntrue that Mr. Podmore subsequently qualifies this statement\nand admits that the order of emergence does occasionally\nvary. He does not, however, emphasise the exceptions\nwhereas I wish to, as I consider them to be too important\nto be slurred over. Thus the cross-correspondences entitled\nin my paper \" Cup \" and \" Thanatos \" occurred first in Mrs.\nPiper's trance- script or speech, next in Mrs. Holland's script,\nand last in Mrs. Verrall's. The \" Wordsworth Country\ntopic emerged first in Mrs. Piper's script, and afterwards in\nMrs. Verrall's, What I take to be the allusions to the\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 21\nidentification of East and West emerged first in Mrs. Holland's\nscript, next in Mrs. Piper's waking-stage, and last in Mrs.\nVerrall's script. Moreover, none of the three names\u2014Leopold,\nHarold, Silvia\u2014which served to reveal a hidden connexion\nbetween a variety of apparently disconnected topics contained\nin all three scripts\u2014appeared in Mrs. Verrall's script at all.\nIf, then, Mrs. Verrall's subconsciousness was the originator\nand telepathic transmitter of the concordant ideas distributed\namoncf the various autoniatists, and of the clues to their\ninterconnexion, one must infer that in some cases it did not\nallow some of the ideas to emerge in lier own script until\nthey had first emerged elsewhere, and that in other cases\nit did not allow ideas which it had communicated to the\nother autoniatists to be expressed in her own script at all.\nIn Mr. Podmore's opinion the form of the allusions to\nthe same subject in the different scripts is not sufBciently\nenigmatic to indicate the intervention of a mind external\nto the automatists. As regards a good many of the cases\nI am disposed to agree with this view ; but I find the\nrequisite '\nenigmaticalness ' (if I may coin the word) in the\nconnexion of thought which links together many of the\nsubjects of the cross-correspondences. Of this connexion of\nthought not one of the automatists had the vaguest inkling.\nI agree with Mr. Podmore that there was nothing written\nor spoken by the Piper, controls (unless it were, perhaps,\nthe words \" United we stand, divided we fall \") to show that\nthey understood the second sentence of the Latin message.\nBut the fact that cross-correspondences of a complex type\nbegan to make their appearance only after the second sentence of\nthe message had been dictated to the controls, suggests\u2014though\nit certainly cannot be said to do more than suggest\u2014that they\nmay have comprehended the second sentence, although they made\nno attempt to translate it. The trance-personalities, be it noted,\nwere never requested to translate the Latin Message. What they\nwere asked to do was to send an intelligent reply to it.\nThe only other remark that I have to offer on Mr.\nPodmore's paper is that I regret that his analysis of the\ncross-correspondences stopped short just at the point where\ntheir complexity becomes difficult to account for by mere\ntelepathic interchange between the automatists.\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nTo turn now to the second paper. \" Some of the facts,\"\nsays Mr. Lowes Dickinson, \" are explicable by direct telepathy\nfrom an agent to a percipient present in the same room.\"\nThis is so ; but I would have you observe that in no .single\ncase of cross-correspondence need the sitter have been the\nagent ; in several cases he could not have been ; and in\nevery case one of the automatists may have been. And\nthat last statement holds good even in the \" Steeple \" cross-\ncorrespondence, where I seem to have a facie claim to\nbe regarded as the source of Mrs. Piper's knowledge ; for it\nwas not until Mrs. Verrall had learnt from me about the\ncross-correspondence which I wrongly imagined had occurred\nbetween her and Mrs. Holland that the word \" Steeple\nappeared in Mrs. Piper's script. And in this connexion\npart of the context in which \" Steeple \" was there given is\nof interest :\n\" I thought,\" wrote MyerSp, \" you \\i.c. J.G.P.]\ngave it at Mrs. Verrall's.\"\nMr. Dickinson cites the quotations from Crossing the Bar\ngiven by Mrs. Verrall and Mrs. Piper as a possible example\nof thought-transference from the subconsciousness of the sitter.\nBut I do not think it a well-chosen instance for these reasons\nWhen the quotation from Crossinr\/ the Bar was given in\nMrs. Piper's trance it was closely followed by the utterance\nof the name \" Arthur Hallam.\" Now I, the sitter, had read\nthe script of Mrs. Verrall's which contained the concordant\nquotation from Grossing the Ba.r ; but I had not read a\nscript of hers of later date which contained a quotation\nfrom In Mcmoriam. This script had in fact been written\nonly two hours before Mrs. Piper uttered \" Arthur Hallam,\"\nand had then not been read by any one except Mrs. Verrall.\nHence arises a strong presumption that, if any living person\nwas the agent, it was, not I, the sitter, who had seen only\nMrs. Verrall's Crossing the Bar script, but Mrs. Verrall who\nknew the contents both of the Crossing the Bar and of the\nIII Memoriam scripts. The cross-correspondences \" Laurel\nWreath \" and \" Library, my own name and Mrs. Sidgwick's\nwould be better examples of possible thought-transference\nfrom the sitter's subconsciousness than the quotation from\nCrossing the Bar.\nIncidentally in the course of his paper, Mr. Dickinson\n\fJan., 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 23\nasks :\n\" Why . . . should Myers, if Myers it were, be unable\nto give a simple reference to Horace, Odes, I. 28, when\nelsewhere he has given quite clearly references to the New\nTestament ? Even if we make the very big assumption\nthat because Myers can cast a message delivered to one\nautomatist in a certain form he can therefore cast a message\ndelivered to another automatist in the same form, and that\naccordingly Myers, had he chosen, could have communicated\nthe reference \"Horace, Odes, I. 28\" through Mrs. Piper,\nthere may have been a very good reason why Myers did\nnot answer Mrs. Verrall's question about an Ode of Horace\nin so simple a manner. Mrs. A^errall knew that the answer\nto her question ought to be \"Horace, Odes, I. 28;\" and if\nthe answer had been given in that form, Mrs. Verrall would\nat once have been pounced upon as being the guilty telepathic\nagent : and no one would have realized this better than Myers,\n\" if Myers it were.\" The roundabout and involved manner\nin which, as I think, MyerSp did answer the question, cannot\ncertainly be ascribed to any obvious and easy form of telepathic\ninterchange between Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Verrall.\nI will now discuss some points in the third and last\npaper. Mr. Constable asks :\n\" Why is it we never find . . .\na simple and direct correspondence ear-marked between the\nscript of two automatic writers?\" I should answer that question\nby denying the assumption on which it is based. We do\nfind simple and direct correspondence between two automatists,\nand, as I shall show presently, \" ear-marked \" too. \" Triangle\nwithin a circle,\" \" Laurel Wreath,\" \" Shadow,\" and the quotations\nfrom Crossing the Bar are instances of simple and direct\ncorrespondence.\nThen Mr. Constable goes on to say :\n\" When he [i.e. Myers]\ngives some of these words [i.e. words chosen as the subjects\nof cross-correspondence experiments] to Mrs. Verrall, why can\nhe not ear-mark the words he has given as those he wanted\nto give ? He does not do so in any case : at times he even\nleaves Mrs. Vei-rall in sheer ignorance of what he has done,\nand depends on the ingenuity of Mr. Piddington to pick out\nfrom a number of others the words intended to be transferred.\"\nAlthough in some cases a phrase, word or idea in Mrs.\nVerrall's script, which is reproduced by Mrs. Piper, was not\n\f24 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

It is the obliquity of the coincidences\nthat suggests the intervention of some third mind.\nSir Oliver Lodge said that he welcomed the frank discussion\nof the subject of cross-correspondences from various points of\nview, since he regarded the subject as one eminently worthy\nof discussion and likely to be treated as of considerable\nimportance in the future. The discussion could only be fully\nfollowed by those who had made some study of the recent\nProcecdhigs ; and he could assure the members of the Society\nthat they were well worth study.\nHe thought that Mr. Constable's paper rather led away\nfrom the immediate subject by introducing a C[uestion as to\nlocation of personality, whether it lodged in the human beings\nor automatists concerned, or whether it belonged in any degree\nto the ostensible communicators. This question at the present\nstage did not seem to him important ; the real point for\ndiscussion was whether the phenomenon as observed could\nbe explained by telepathy from living people or by an elabora-\ntion and dramatic simulation by the unconscious or subliminal\n\f26 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nself of the automatist. It was to fulfil tlie function of deciding\nbetween these three hypotheses that cross-correspondences were\ndesigned, and for this purpose the more complex and ingenious\nthey were the better.\nHe therefore opposed Mr. Constable's plea for greater\nsimplicity and directness, and favoured Mr. Podmore's plea\nfor greater subtlety and obscurity. A direct and simple\ncross-correspondence, say for instance such a sentence as\n\" A pig with a white-nosed snout,\" appearing in two places\nat once, would support the argument for ordinary telepathy,\nsuch as operated in the case of Miss Miles and Miss Kamsden\nfor instance. In order to make an effective cross-correspondence\nsuch as would justify as a working hypothesis the postulation\nof the activity of the intelligence, say of F. W. H. Myers, what\nwas required was something so ingeniously wrapped up that it\nwould convey no impression to either automatist alone ; but\nwhen put together by a third person,\u2014or, still better, by the help\nof another communication through a third automatist, and then\ncriticised by a fourth person,\u2014would result in full and lucid\nmeaning, and if possible a meaning which should involve wide\nliterary knowledge and recondite classical allusions.\nSuch cross-correspondences he thought we had now got ; and\nthe ingenuity and subtlety and literary allusiveness made the\nrecord difficult to read, even when disentangled and presented\nby the skill of Mr. Piddington.\nHe was quite sure that the correspondences were not invented\nby Mr. Piddington, but were detected by him as already existing\nin the script.\nThe only fault he found with Mr. Podmore's paper was that\nhe concentrated attention on the simpler and less important\ncorrespondences, and seemed to ignore those which more clearly\nsatisfied the conditions desired, saying that these must be\ninterpreted in terms of the simpler. From that conclusion\nSir Oliver Lodge dissented, holding that the phenomenon\npresented to our observation must be studied in its complexity\nand entirety ;\nsince, as was now clear, complexity was of the\nessence of the matter.\nMr. St. G. Lane Fox Pitt held that the result of these\nexperiments had been so far the clear demonstration of the\nfact that there were vehicles through which conscious intellectual\n\fJan,, 1909. Private Meeting for Members and Associates. 27\nlife could function other than the physical brain. That in\nitself was an achievement of undoubted scientific importance.\nThe next step was to discover the laws by which the\nobserved phenomena were governed. He deprecated the use\nof such expressions as \" external intelligences,\" \" Spirit identity,\"\nand \" Spirit hypothesis \" as being devoid of any real meaning.\nHe suggested that much light could be thrown on the subject\nof the manifested intelligences by the consideration of psychical\nphenomena within the experience of all, namely dream per-\nsonalities. These often seemed quite real to our sleeping\nconsciousness. They seemed to be endowed with reasoning-\npowers, with knowledge, which was sometimes beyond that of\nour waking capacity, and very often with an appearance of\nindependence and egoistic self assertion which was quite\nsurprising. Mr. Fox Pitt said he believed that our subliminal\nminds, not being limited and conditioned in the same way as\nthe normal supraliminal mind, were capable of assimilating\nideas and thoughts from other subliminals, and possibly also\nfrom what might be called the surviving psychic reliquite of\ndeceased personalities. Subliminals seemed at times to be\nable to coalesce with one another so as to generate in a psychic\nvehicle what had all the appearance of distinct and separate\npersonalities, capable of manifesting themselves through and\neven of \" controlling \" a living organism. Such \" entities \" might\npossibly account for the alleged materialisation phenomena.\nThe Hox. Johx Harfjs suggested that the hieroglyphic signs\nin the script printed on p. 68 of Proceedings, Vol. XXII.,\ncould be interpreted as a combination of illiterate Arabic and\nHindostani, and that the meaning would then be :\n\" Shut up\nit is not in our agreement ; that is the end of it.\"\nMrs. Veerall replied : With regard to Mr. Harris's point,\nI have heard it suggested that the script in question is\nPersian, and that it is shorthand, and I have received two\ninterpretations\u2014neither complete\u2014of its meaning in shorthand.\nBut, for the present, it seems safer to suppose that it is\nmere scribble.\nMr. Podmore drew attention to the number of cases of\ncross-correspondences between Mrs. Piper and myself, in which\nthe first emergence was in my script, and both he and Mr.\nConstable commented on the comparative simplicity of the\n\f28 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nexpressions used in Mrs. Piper's trance compared with the\nelaborate allusiveness found in my automatic writing.\nThe statistics as to priority of emergence are as follows\nThe 24 ^ cases in which Mrs. Piper was concerned consist of\n16 double eases {i.e. involving one other automatist) and 8 triple\ncases (that is, involving two other automatists). In the 16\ndouble cases, Mrs. Piper was first 4 times, Mrs. Holland\nonce, viz. in the only case in which she took part, and 111\ntimes out of the 14 in which I took part. In the 8 triple\ncases Mrs. Piper was first in 2 (thus keeping the same ratio\nto her total), Mrs. Holland was first in 2 out of 5, and I\nin 4 out of 8. It is thus noticeably true \u2014not so much that\nI was first, for Mrs. Holland's priority in the triple cases is\nalmost as marked\u2014but that Mrs. Piper was second.\nThe reason for this is prol)ably due to the same cause that\naccounts for the brevity and directness of her sayings. There is\na great difference in the circumstances of Mrs. Piper's script on\nthe one hand and Mrs. Holland's and mine on the other. Mrs.\nPiper is in trance, and therefore (1) unconscious of what she\nproduces, (2) kept to the point by questions from the sitter\nin charge. The complete consciousness on my part of each\nword as it emerges\u2014though never of the general sense\nprobably checks distinctive phrases and tends to produce\nvagueness, and in the absence of questions from a bystander,\nrepetition is an obvious means of bringing out the points by\nemphasis. Under these circumstances it is clearly easier to\nproduce a plain statement through Mrs. Piper ; and since it is\nsafer not to prophesy until you know, the plain statement\ntends to take the form \" Such a one has written,\" rather than\n\" will write,\" so and so.\nIt is true, as Mr. Podmore has said, that the majority of\nthe cross-correspondences are not of the complex type desired,\nand demanded in the \" Latin Message.\" But several of them\nare more than mere repetitions, in varying form, of the same\nidea. Of two in particular T should like to speak, \"Thanatos\"\n(No. XXI.) and \" Abt Vogler \" (Nos.

On April l7th, in the waking-stage, Mrs. Piper\nuttered the sounds, \" Sanatos, Tanatos,\" and on April 23rd,\n\" Thanatos,\" the Greek word for Death. On April 29th my\nscript consisted of four literary quotations, all involving the\nnotion of Death, the last of them being the famous passage\nin Horace {Od. L, 4), whose rhythm and alliteration imitate\nthe sudden interruption of the dance of the Graces, \" imminente\nluna,\" by the sound of the approaching footsteps in the Dance\nof Death :\n\" Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas\nEegumque turres.\"\nIt cannot be accident which combines in each case a sug-\ngestion of sound with the idea of Death, and makes use of\nthe three different languages through the three automatists.\nIn the case of \" Abt Vogler \" we have a cross-correspondence\nof the complex type desired. The dates here are important.\nOn January 2nd the delivery of the \" Latin Message \" was\ncomplete. On January 16th Mr. Piddington spoke to the\nPiper controls of the importance of cross-correspondences, and\nsuggested the drawing of a triangle within a circle to show\nthat a script formed part of a cross-correspondence. On\nJanuary 23rd and 28th my script contained allusions to Hope,\nStar and Browning's Abt Vogler, and on February 3rd and l7th\nMiss Verrall's script alluded to star and Browning. On Feb-\nruary 11th, before the completion of Miss Verrall's allusion,\nbut after its beginning, the Piper controls announced as a\ncross- correspondence \" Browning, Hope, and Star,\" and on\nMarch 6th and thenceforward persistently they claimed that\nthis particular cross-correspondence was \" an answer to the\nLatin Message\n;\n\" in other words, a cross-correspondence of the\ncomplex type.\nIs this claim justified ? Is something discoverable b}' putting\nthe statements together that is not discoverable from any single\none of them ? I think this is so. Mrs. Piper describes the\ncross-correspondence as \" Browning Hope and Star.\" ffajM\nappears in my script as a mis-quotation in a line of Abt Vogler,\nbut does not appear in the poem at all. Brovming and Star\nappear in both my script and my daughter's. The emphasis\nin my script among Browning's poems is plainly on Abt Voglrr,\nbut there is no indication in my script as to which, if either.\n\f30 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1909.\nof the lines in that poem which refer to a star nnderlies the\ngeneral thought.^ The lines are\nStanza IV. \"\n\u2022\n\"Not a point nor peak bnt found and fixed its wandering star.\"\nStanza VII.\n\"That out of three sounds he frame not a fourth sound but a star,\"\nBut given that one of these two lines is to be indicated, Miss\nVerrall's script settles the point beyond dispute. The star is\n\"the sign;\" there is \"heavenly harmony,\" \"the diapason,\" \"the\nmystic three,\" \"above it all is the star.\" Thus while my script\ndetermines the poem, my daughter's script determines the line.\nBut her script alone does not determine the poem. It is only\nby combining her script with mine, and by interpreting them\non the lines suggested by the three words of the Piper controls,\nthat we see the point of this complex cross-correspondence, and\nfind that the whole is something more than the sum of the\nparts.\nMoreover, to this, the first cross-correspondence since January\n16th, is appended the distinguishing sign suggested by Mr.\nPiddington, a triangle within a circle, ingeniously connected\nwith Browning's poem of Aht Vogler. Thus, though the first\nemergence of the allusion is in my script, the whole experiment\nmust be dated from the suggestion of the geometrical figure to\nthe Piper controls on January 16th, and therefore the cross-\ncorrespondence does not originate with me.\nIt is true that the Piper controls did not succeed in trans-\nlating the \" Latin Message,\" but they did better ;\nthey acted\nupon it. In immediate response, and by the method desired,\ncame an unmistakable allusion to the line in Alt Vogler\n\" That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star.\"\nIt is manifest that the verse thus indicated is singularly\nappropriate as the subject of a cross-correspondence of the\nparticular type desired, so that the choice of topic no less than\nthe method of conveyance points to an intelligent response to\nthe request of the experimenters, and justifies the claim of the\nPiper controls that tliis particular cross-correspondence was\nintended as an \" answer to your Latin message.\"\n'The quotations from the poem in my script are from Stanzas IX., X., XII.\n\fJan., 1909. Obituary. 31\nOBITUAEY.\nProfessor Jules Liegeois.\nMembers of the S.P.R. will have heard with profound regret\nof the tragic death of Professor Liegeois of Nancy. While\nspending his holiday last autumn in the Vosges he was run\nover and killed by a motor car before the eyes of his wife,\nwith whom he was walking on a quiet country road.\nDr. Liegeois was Professor of Jurisprudence in the University\nof Nancy, and a distinguished lawyer. He was one of the trio\nof eminent men occupying chairs in that university\u2014Liegeois,\nBernheim, and Beaunis\u2014who followed the teaching of Liebeault\nand did so much to place the study and practice of hypnotism\non a sound and scientific basis. In his first monograph on the\nsubject, Za Suggestion ct le Somnambulismc dans leurs rajyports avcc\nla Jurisjmcdcnee et la MMecinc Ugale, a work which had a great\nsale and aroused much interest when it appeared in 1889,\u2014he\ntells how, in 1878, his attention was first drawn to the question\nof hypnotism, and he was shortly afterwards introduced to Lie-\nbeault, at that time ignored by the Faculties. He soon realised\nthe importance of suggestion from a legal as well as a medical\npoint of view, and his experiments on Liebeault's somnambules are\namong the best reported. Professor Beaunis said of him that of\nall the authors who have investigated hypnotic phenomena none\nhas drawn a picture of such extraordinary clearness and exactitude.\nLiegeois took a prominent part in the famous trial of Gabrielle\nBompard in 1889. This young woman was charged with\nmurder under sensational circumstances, and Liegeois contended\nthat she had acted under hypnotic suggestion. He urged that\nshe should be hypnotised and made in the hypnotic state to\nreact the crime and divulge the name of the hypnotiser.\nHe argued the case with much eloquence, and at great length,\nbefore the Paris tribunal, but he was not allowed to put his\ntheories to the test, and the prisoner was found guilty and\nsentenced to a long term of imprisonment. This case illustrates\nthe views Liegeois took up and strenuously held to the end,^\nthat under hypnosis a certain proportion of somnambules are\nso dominated by suggestion that they become mere automata\n1 These views are set forth at length in his book UHypnotismt et hs Suggestions\nCriminellen, 1898.\n\f32 Journal of Society for Psyclvical ResearcJi. Jan., 1909.\nto execute the commands of the hypnotiser ; and that the\nexistence of this power for evil should be recognised and\nguarded against. As a safeguard he advised that very hypno-\ntisable subjects should be protected from abuse of suggestion\nby being told that they must never be hypnotised except with\ntheir written consent and in the presence of a member of\ntheir family,\u2014advice which is found to be efficacious and\nwhich is largely acted upon. Dr. Liegeois was a corresponding\nmember of the S.P.E., and was personally known to many of\nour members, who can speak of his 'genial personality and\nkindly hospitality. He was always ready to help inquirers by\nhis experience and advice ; and he will be missed by a large\ncircle of friends in all parts of the world.\nIn addition to the books already referred to, Liegeois con-\ntributed papers on the same subject to various scientific\nsocieties and international congresses, and at the time of his\ndeath was preparing for publication a large and important\nwork elaborating his theories of the condition lyrimc ct scconde.\nChas.

It is hoped that the whole Eeport will appear\nlater in the Proceedings.\nEEPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1908.\nThe membership of the Society has again increased consider-\nably during the year. 37 new Members were elected and\none Associate became a Member ; 117 new Associates were\n\fFeb., 1909. Report of the Council. 37\nelected and 9 Members became Associates. On the other\nhand, the total loss in numbers from various causes was 30\nMembers and 82 Associates, leaving a net increase of 52.\nThe total membership has now reached 1190, the numbers being\ndistributed as follows: Members 290 (including 25 Honorary\nand Corresponding Members); Associates 900 (including 15\nHonorary Associates).\nDuring this year two long reports have been issued on the\nautomatic scripts of Mrs. Holland, Mrs. Piper, Mrs. Verrall,\nand Miss Verrall. These scripts, as is well known, have in\nlate years greatly developed in interest and complexity, and\nthe second report in particular shows what laborious and pene-\ntrating study and comparison of the different scripts with one\nanother are required to bring out their significance. A con-\nsiderable amount of public interest has been aroused by the\nreports, as shown by articles in the Spectator, Nation, Hibhert\nJournal, Nevj Quarterly, etc., as well as by unusually large\nsales to outsiders of the Proceedings containing them. Experi-\nments are being actively continued with all the automatists\nconcerned and much fresh material has accumulated which it\nis hoped may be presented to the Society before long.\nAmong other woi'k undertaken by members of the Society\nduring the year, we may mention a fresh series of experiments\nin thought-transference at a distance carried out by Miss Miles\nand Miss Kamsden, an account of which was given at one of\nthe Private Meetings and printed in the Journal for June\nand an enquiry into the alleged miraculous nature of certain\nhailstones that fell at Eemiremont (Vosges) in May, 1907, and\nwere said to have an image of the Virgin imprinted on them.\nThe expenses of this enquiry were generously defrayed by a\nMember of the Society who took a special interest in the case;\nand the investigation was carried out by Monsieur M. Sage,\nwhose report will appear in Part LVI. of the Proceedings.\nIn November the Council commissioned Mr. Feilding to\nundertake a series of sittings with Eusapia Paladino at Naples.\nHe was accompanied by Mr. Hereward Carrington, and Mr.\nBaggally afterwards joined them. Eleven sittings were held\nduring November and December, and it is hoped that a full\nreport of the investigation will appear in the Proceedings.\nIn May the Council adopted a scheme for the establishment\n\f38 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Apparition.\nThe following account of an apparition seen by several different\npersons was received from Dr. J. H. Gower, who interviewed\nthe witnesses and collected their evidence. His first report of\nit was as follows\n19 Steele Block, Denver, Colo.,\nAugust 5th, 1908.\nLast Christmas the body of a man employed in one of our\nbusiness buildings was found dead at the bottom of the elevator\nshaft.\nEecently an apparition answering the description of the dead man\nhas been seen by three or four people at different times in the\nmidnight hours in the engine room of the same building. Neither\nof the parties seeing the ghost knew the deceased at all, and it was\ntherefore only by the description given that my friend, who runs\nthe building, could place him.\nI carefully examined the engine room, and believe it would be\nalmost impossible for a \"joker\" to make his escape. I have closely\nquestioned the percipients and am quite impressed by their declara-\ntions. They, at least, are quite convinced that they have seen the\n\" real thing.\" On the first occasion it shook up a sleeping fireman,\nand when he was about to expostulate with it for rough treatment\nit vanished. On each occasion it appears to have been \"sensible to\ntouch as to sight.\" The case has been given to me to investigate,\nand I shall try to visit the scene at night ;\nmaybe I shall see it\nmyself. . . .\nJohn H. Gower.\nDr. Gower's next letter on the subject was as follows\n19 Steele Block, Denver, Colo.,\nA^ov. 9th, 1908.\nEnclosed please find particulars so far obtained of the Ghost Case\nabout which I wrote you some time ago.\nUpon the receipt of Mr. Roberton's letter of Aug. 3rd, I went\ndown to the building for the purpose of making inquiries. I spent\nover an hour in questioning the men and examining the place where\nthe apparition was seen. The sworn statements give you a fair\n\f42 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1909.\nidea of what was said on that occasion and all subsec^uent statements\nAvere entirely of a corroborative nature. I have not yet seen Ellis,\nbut I understand that his experiences were very similar to the\nothers, with the exception that he scm nothing, but the ghost\nhandled him in the same uncanny manner that it had handled the\nothers.\nThe room in which the phenomenon occurred is a very small one\nand is very difficult of access. It is situated in the basement of\none of the office buildings in this city, and to reach it one has to\nclimb down a short ladder way from an entrance somewhat of the\ntrapdoor kind.\nThe room is well filled with machinery\u2014a compressor-tank\u2014and\nit is only with difficulty that one can move about in it, although it\nis well lighted by electricity. It has no door, but an entrance,\nthrough which a man of more than ordinary size would have to\nsqueeze himself. I mention this because it was quite clear to me\nthat an attempt to play \"spooks\" here would have resulted in\nbeing caught in the act immediately.\nThe men stood a pretty severe cross-examination on all occasions,\nboth hy Dr. Rogers and myself, without weakening in any particular,\nand I was much struck by the open way in which they gave their\nevidence, and am quite impressed by the fact, that they all fully\nbelieve that they have seen the real thing. . . .\nI should add that I understand that none of the men knew the\nengineer who was killed personall}' ; but that it was entirely from\nthe description given of the apparition that Mr. Roberton was\nable to recognize the likeness, which seems to have been quite\nremarkable as to detail.\nI will send Ellis' statement as soon as I obtain it, together with\nany further information that you may wish to have.\nJohn H. Gower.\nThe statements enclosed by Dr. Govver were as follows\nDenver, Colo., Aug. 3, 1908.\nDear Dr. Gower, \u2014About a week before last Christmas the\nEngineer of the Block was found dead in bottom of front\nElevator Shaft.

Kelley and Wm. Norder, engineers of the Block, and\nof Mrs. Norder, in reference to the Psychical Phenomena experi-\nenced by them in the Block.\nYou ask me to include a statement from mj'self, but tiie only\nstatement I can make is that about a week before Christmas, 1907,\nan engineer of the block was killed in the elevator shaft, and the\nengineers whose statements are included were, of course, aware of\nthis accident, and naturally connect the apparition with the\ndeceased engineer. Anything further that I might add would only\nbe a repetition of the statements made by the parties already\nnamed.\nTrusting this will be all that is necessary, I remain,\nYours very truly,\nFrank Roberton {CasJder).\nBill Kellej', Night Engineer of the Block, states that\nabout the 10th of June, 1908, about a week before he started to\nwork in this building, he was visiting the night engineer of the\nbuilding, and while the latter was making his round of the building\nat 12 o'clock midnight, he lay down in the corner of the com-\npressor room, underneath the tank, which was located a few feet\nabove him. He was sleeping in this position when he felt a hard\nrap on his shoulder. He jumped up suddenly, and in doing so\nstruck his head against the tank, and at the same time his atten-\ntion was arrested by seeing a figure standing just inside of the\nopen doorway (there being no door leading from the compressor\nroom into the boiler room).\nHe states that the figure was that of a man about 25 years to\n30 years of age, of medium height, dressed in the regulation\noveralls and dark cap of an engineer; that he was of slight build\nand pale complexion and smooth-shaven face, and what hair was\nvisible on his head was of a light colour.\nA month or so later than this he was standing in the boiler\nroom at the rear of the boilers oiling one of the valves leading to\nthe water tank, and resting his arm on one of the pipes, when his\narm slipped and he commenced swearing, when he heard a low\n\f44 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1909.\nmumbling voice a short distance away and looked in that direction,\nbut saw nothing. He then went on with his swearing, and dis-\ntinctly heard a voice immediately behind him say, \" Don't do that.\nI wouldn't do that. You don't gain anything by swearing. I\nwouldn't do that.\" Glancing over his shoulder and seeing nothing\naround he became alarmed, and dropping his oil-can made a bolt\nfor the front end of the boiler room. This happened about 2\no'clock in the afternoon.\nWm. Kelley.\nKelley also states that Bill Norder, chief engineer, and his wife,\nand a fireman named Ellis, have all seen this same figure ; that\nBill Norder told him that he was sitting in his chair in the com-\npressor room when something took hold of his foot and shook it,\nand when he looked up suddenly he saw a figure standing in the\ndoorway and answering the same general description as the figure\nwhich had appeared to him. At the time this figure appeared to\nthem there were three electric lights burning in the room, and as\nsoon as they saw the figure it vanished.\nKelley also states that Mrs. Norder (his sister) told him that\nshe was sitting in the chair in the compressor room one night\nwhile her husband was making his round of the building about 10\no'clock in the evening. She was sitting in the compressor room\nwith her knees crossed when she distinctly felt some one take hold\nof her foot and push it down on the floor alongside the other foot,\nand that this happened repeatedly, and that on one occasion she\nfelt something shake her by the shoulder when she was sitting in\nthe same place dozing and until she roused up and saw standing\nimmediately in front of her a figure which she described practi-\ncally the same as the figure described by Kelley.\nKelley also states that the man named Ellis, who worked there\na short time as night engineer on the building, saw this figure on\nmore than one occasion, and became so disturbed at it that he quit\nwork after a short time.\n(Signed) Wm. Kelley.\nSubscribed and sworn to before me this 5th November, 1908.\nFrank Roberton, Notary Public.\nBill Norder, day engineer of the Block, says he has been\nworking here as night engineer about 2 months, when one night\nabout 11 o'clock, he was sitting in the chair in the corner of the\ncompressor room reading an engineer book, when he felt something\n\fFeb., 1909. Case. 45\ngrab him by the foot and shake it, and thinking it might be a fireman\njust amusing himself, did not pay any attention to it until the same\nthing occurred again very emphatically, when he looked up and saw\na figure standing in front of him, within an arm's length, staring\nstraight at him. Bill Norder said \" What the you want 1\nand jumped up, when the figure vanished completely.\nThis figure he described as of medium height and slight build,\nabout 26 years of age, and dressed in ordinary working clothes of\nan engineer, also of a pale complexion and light auburn hair. He\nthen started out into the boiler room to investigate thoroughly, but\ncould see nothing. He said to himself that it could not be any-\nthing human and get out of sight that quick. That was the only\ntime he ever saw anything of the sort, either there or elsewhere,\nalthough he had often been on night picket duty with the U.S.\nArmy around Manilla, sometimes on graveyard picket duty, where\nthe surroundings were such as might tend to cause a person of\nimagination to think that they saw such apparitions.\nNorder states that the feeling he experienced was exactly as if\nsome one had taken firmly hold of his foot and shaken it, and as\nhe looked up, the figure was standing quietly in front of him and\nsmiling.\n(Signed) Wm. Nokder.\nSubscribed and sworn to before me this 4th March, 1908.\nFrank Roberton,\nNotary Public.\nMrs. Norder, wife of Wm. Norder, engineer of the Block,\nstates that soon after her husband went to work in this building,\nabout 2 o'clock one morning, when her husband was away on one\nof his rounds of the building, she was sitting by the desk in the\ncompressor room and leaning back in the chair in a light sleep,\nwhen she felt something take hold of her shoulder and shake her,\nfirst one side and then the other, until she was completely awake.\nLooking up she saw standing before her a figure, and having had\nsimilar experiences many times before in her life, she looked at it\nsteadily and critically. She states that it was diessed in overalls\nand in an under-shirt, and had the general appearance of an\nengineer or fireman.\nMrs. Norder stated that she had heard that an engineer had been\nkilled in the building some time previous, but had never given the\nmatter more than a passing thought. She did not at the time tell\nher husband anything about the appearance of this figure, thinking\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1909.\nthat it would only make him nervous ; but some time afterwards,\nwhen he was sitting in the same place, the figure appeared to him,\nand when he described it to her, it agreed exactly with the\ndescription of the figure which she had seen, and which she had\ndescribed to a neighbour, whom she got to corroborate her testimony\nto her husband. She states that at the time this figure appeared\nto her she felt perfectly at ease, and was in a condition to notice\ncarefully the details of its appearance, but that after her husband\nreturned she felt somewhat nervous at the idea of remaining alone,\nso she accomiDanied him on his further rounds that night.\nOn another occasion, about 10 o'clock at night, she went to the\nbuilding to take her husband's supper, and while sitting alongside\nof him in the compressor room, she felt distinctly what seemed to\nbe a hand grasping her foot and moving it off to one side on the\nfloor several inches, and thinking to see if it would continue, she\nplaced iier foot back again in its original position several times,\nand each time had the same experience, but did not at that time\nsee anything.\n(Signed) Mrs. Delia Norder.\nSubscribed and sworn to before me this 5th Nov., 1908.\nFrank Roberton,\nNotary Public.\nMrs. Norder states further that she had on several occasions\nseen apparitions of persons known to her, both living and dead,\nbut \" had never paid much attention to psychical matters.\"\nDr. Gower writes later :\nDecember 3rd, 1908.\n. . . Ellis's statement (which I expect in a few days) will, I\nunderstand, be to the effect that he felt the ghost, but did not see\nit. This seems to me important as dispelling the theory of trick\nor joke, as by no possible means could a joker have shaken Ellis\nin the engine room without showing himself and being spotted at\nonce. . . .\nIn another letter, dated January 26th, 1909, Dr. Gower\ntells us that Ellis has been lost sight of, so that it has not\nbeen possible to obtain his evidence.\nThe following further statement was received by Dr. Gower\nfrom Mr. Eoberton :\nDenver, Colo., Dec 2, 1908.\nReplying to your inquiries suggested by a recent letter from the\nPsychical Societj' in London, I have seen Norder, and he says that\n\fFeb., 1909.

He treated the matter as a joke at\nthat time, and did not pay any particular attention to it, but he\nadds that no one could now convince him that he did not see\nclearly the figure which he describes, or did not experience the\nshaking, etc., of which he speaks.\nI have also inquired of each of the parties testifying, and find that\nnone of them had ever met the engineer who was killed. . . .\nFrank Roberton.\nSUPPLEMENTARY LIBRARY CATALOGUE.\nBooks added to the Library since the last List, Journal \/'or April, 1908.\nAbbott (David P.), Behind the Scenes witli the Mediums.\nChicago. 1908.\ntAndrews (W.

Mae., 1909.\nTHE DOWSING EOD.\nBy Professor W. r. Barrett.\nSince I published my monograph on the so-called divining or\ndowsing rod a vast accumulation of additional evidence has\nreached me. Some of it is of considerable value, but at\npresent I have neither time nor courage to sift the whole of\nthis mass of material. It is, however, I think, desirable to\npublish the following letters as affording evidence on behalf\nof the dowser from men of some distinction and accustomed\nto weigh evidence.\nThe first letter is from Sir John Franks, K.C.B., the Secretary\nto the Irish Land Commission, who writes\nDalriada, Blackrock, Co. Dublin, May 28, 1902.\nDear Professor Barrett, \u2014I want to make searcli for water on\na farm I have in Co. Kilkenny and I am told no one can advise\nbetter as to the modus operandi than you ; so perhaps, if not too\nmuch trouble, you will give me the benefit of suggestions on the\nsubject.\nThe lands lie at an elevation of from 100 to 440 feet, and are\nbounded by a stream at tlie lowest level, and there are good wells\nor rather springs close together at an elevation of about 200 feet.\nOn the old Ordnance map (made in 1836) there are some wells\nwhich had been afterwards marked (probably by my father) in quite\nanother part of the farm, but these have not been wanted for many\nyears past, and there is nothing on the surface to show where they\nwere. They would be of use now, if water is to be found. . . .\nJ. H. Franks.\nI gave Sir John Franks the name of an amateur dowser\nliving on the borders of Co. Kilkenny, viz. Mr. J. H. Jones,\nof Mullinabro, Co. Waterford. Mr. Jones met Sir John at\nhis place, with the following result\nDalriada, Blackrock, Co. Dublin, Sept. 14, 1902.\nDear Professor Barrett,\u2014 ... I was quite astonished at the\nlesults of the tests to which I subjected [Mr. Jones's] work and\nmethods, before I incurred the expense and trouble of sinking for\nwater at the place indicated by him.\nHe had never been over the ground before, and there is nothing\n\fMae., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 51\non the Ordnance sheets (which are very old) to indicate the\nposition of the old wells mentioned before. I made three tests by\nbringing him from 100, 200, 800 yards away from these wells,\nwhich are only apparent when qtdte dose, with no paths lead-\ning to them. He quartered the ground back and forwards\nlike a dog looking for game, and after some delay in each\ncase eventually found a flow, and the direction [of the flow].\nOnce the direction was found, he followed it steadily, working\nback and forwards across flow, till without aid he hit off the\nplace where the concealed wells are. The last test was quite\nwonderful, as I brought him quite half a mile away to the top\nof the watershed, to a place from which he could not have had\nan idea where the well opened, in a spot quite out of sight until\none got within two yards of it, but he hit it off with absolute\naccuracy. In the place where he indicated a site to sink for a\nnew well there were no surface indications at all, and it was quite\nhalf a mile away from any of the old wells. We had to cut and\nblast principally through solid rock, 38 feet down, before we hit\nthe spring. There are now 20 feet of water in this Avell.\nJ. H. Franks.\nThree other remarkable cases in which Mr. Jones was\nsuccessful when other attempts, some under expert geological\nadvice, had failed, I have investigated. The evidence in these\ncases is, however, too long to quote here ; one was at the model\nfarm at Glasnevin, Co. Dublin, under the Department of Agri-\nculture and Technical Instruction ; another was at Dunganstown\nEectory, Co. Wicklow, a very striking case, concerning which I\nhave detailed reports, and have myself visited the spot and\nverified the statements ;\nanother was at the National Consump-\ntive Hospital, Newcastle, Co. Wicklow, which, at a critical time,\nsaved the Hospital from a water famine.\nThrough the kindness of Sir Oliver Lodge I have received\nthe following letters. The dowser referred to in Mr. Andrew\nLang's letter is Mr. E. Howson, of Middlesboro', a gentleman\nwith whom I have had a good deal of correspondence, and who\nhas also been very successful in dowsing for minerals\nMoNREiTH, Whauphill, N.B., July 15, 1907.\nDear Lodge,\u2014An amazing dowser has been staying here, a gentle-\nman, a land agent in Lancashire. My host. Sir Herbert Maxwell,\nF.E,.S., is not a very credulous philosopher, but what he tells me\n\f52 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.\nof the man's success in tracking people here, and finding hidden\nthings, beats anything I have heard of. I understand that the agent\nhas electrical theories on the subject. If you care to know more\nabout and try to see this gentleman I will give you his address, if\nhe consents, and some particulars.\nA. Lang.\nThe next account was written by Mr. Jesse Ceilings, M.P.,\nat Sir Oliver Lodge's request, and is as follows\nEdgbaston, Feby. 1, 1909.\nMy Dear Sir Oliver,\u2014 . . . The dowsing incident took place\nduring the last annual excursion of the British Dairy Farmers' Asso-\nciation. About a dozen of us were going through a field \u2014a short\ncut\u2014to rejoin the others who were on the road. The question of\nwater-divining came up, and Mr. Walker, a well-known journalist who\nwas with the excursionists, cut a twig from a tree in the middle\nof the field. It was this shape [sketch omitted].\nHe grasped it in his hands [by the two ends]. The field was\na dry hilly one, and we all went down to a \"bottom\" which\nwas swampy. As we came close to the wet swamp the top of\nthe twig steadily rose-\u2014indeed the whole of it \u2014to about this angle\nor more, and when we left the swamp it gradually fell back into\nposition. Several of the farmers present tried it without any effect\nwhatever. Mr. AValker said that very few could do it. I think\nhe said not one in a hundred or one in a thousand, I forget\nwhich.\nBeing very sceptical, I took the twig and we went down to the\n\" bottom \" again, when the twig rose as we approached the water,\nhigher and more deliberately than before. Though I had grasped\nthe ends very tightly I suggested that the parts in my hands had\nturned and so turned the other part of the twig. Mr. Walker\nthen cut notches at the ends of the parts held in my hands. On\nrenewing the experiment the twig behaved exactly as before, while\nthe notches showed that the parts held in the hands had not revolved\nor moved in any way.\nWhat followed astonished us still more. Mr. AValker took a very\nthick twig\u2014speaking from memory about \\ in. or fths thick. He\nnotched the ends and grasped them in the same manner, and on\ngetting near the water the part not held rose up with such force\nthat the arms of the twig being too thick to yield twisted them-\nselves to such an extent [between his hands and the apex] that\n\fMak., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 53\nthe rind was broken and the inside skin was laid bare and twisted,\nand but for the fibrous character of the wood would have dropped\noff altogether. It looked like a rope instead of the smooth stick\nit was before. As it was it became listless with no further animation.\nThe parts grasped, as shown by the notches, had not moved or\nturned in the least. Mr. Walker stated that this experiment hurt\nhis wrists, as he had to hold the ends with all his force to prevent\nthem following the motion of the other parts.\nI certainly should not have believed in the experiments if I had\nnot seen them. As it is I have no theory to advance, but simply\ndescribe\u2014accurately, I think\u2014what I saw, and what others present\ndid not pretend to doubt or dispute.\nJesse Collings.\nMr. Jesse Ceilings' experience is similar to others I have\nalready given in my published reports, and to the following,\nwhich my friend Dean Ovenden has kindly written at my\nrequest. The Dean, I may mention, has published some useful\nlittle books on elementary science, hence he does not take\nrefuge in the usual electricity theory, albeit nothing will shake\nhis conviction that some force external to the dowser moves\nthe rod. The unanimity with which all dowsers hold this\nview shows how distinct from our conscious personality are the\ninvoluntary actions of our sub-conscious life.\nChanter Hill, Enniskillen,\nNov. 22, 1906.\nDear Professor Barrett, \u2014I knew nothing about dowsing, I\nnever saw a dowsing rod nor a dowser. My mental attitude towards\nthe subject was the same as about apparitions, viz. I had heard of\napparitions and dowsers, but both were absolutely outside my personal\nexperience.\nOn Tuesday, the 13th inst., I went to Eossory Glebe as the Bishop's\nrepresentative on a commission of repairs and dilapidations, a new\nrector having been appointed. We found in the corner of an old\nkitchen a small well of clear water. The outside well was 39 feet\nfrom the ground to the surface of the water. We asked the outgoing\nrector where the clear water came from which supplied the indoor\nwell. He replied, \"I don't know.\" Mr. Jervois, the district R.B.\narchitect, said, \"Come out until we look for the source.\" He cut a\nforked twig of a suowberry bush shaped like a Y. Then he held\nhis elbows to his sides and his palms upward, the little fingers\n\f54 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.\nbeing next one another. He bent the forks of the twig outwards\nand gripped them at [the two ends], with the point projecting hori-\nzontally before him. I noticed that he held the bent forks very\ntightly. In this attitude he walked across the bank sloping towards\nthe rectory. For some time the stick remained pointing straight\noutwards ; then, suddenly, as he crossed a certain spot, the twig bent\nupwards violently and hit him on the chest. He was holding it so\ntightly that the parts held in his hands could not turn, and the\nwrench broke the stick like an untwisted cord. I was amazed. He\npassed by the spot and the twig remained inert ; but going back-\nwards and forwards, always at the same spot, where the stream was\nrunning underground, the twig leaped upwards. He said, \" Now\ntouch my hand and you will neutralise the effect.\" I laid my hand\nloosely on his closed fist and we passed over the spot without any\nmovement in the stick. Being more surprised, I said, \" Let me try\nit.\" He said, \" You would be no good, for you stopped my power\nby touching me.\" However, I held the twig as he did, having cut\noff the broken part, and when I passed the spot I felt the light twig\nsuddenly become as heavy as if it were made of steel and was being\npulled downward by a strong magnet. I held it as tightly as I\ncould close my strong hands, but in spite of my efforts it twisted\nround and pointed downwards.\nMr. Jervois said (and I heard this for the first time in my life)\nthat with most dowsers it did point downwards.\nThe next day I cut a forked snowberry twig here and went out\nto make experiments in the garden. Passing down one of the walks\nthe stick insisted on pointing downwards until I reached a spot where\nit became light again. I left the walk where the drag ceased and\ncrossed the earth bed where potatoes had been. Immediately the\nstick began to drag downwards. The gardener said, \"You are right,\nsir, for that's where the drain goes off towards the pond. I found\nit when I was digging.\" Knowing nothing of the drainage of the\nold garden, and not being sure that the drains were where the stick\nindicated them, I called out my daughter and put the stick in her\nhands, but go where she would over the spots which I had passed,\nshe felt nothing. I therefore went to the avenue gate, where I knew\nthat the water supply of Enniskillen crossed the road. The moment\nI came over the pipe the stick pulled downwards with a force which\nI could not resist. Just then a small boy, aged about 12, passed by\nwith some baskets. I told him nothing, but asked him to hold the\nstick as I placed it in his hands and to walk down the road [opposite\n\fMar., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 55\nto and away from the gate]. When he came to [a certain] point he\ncalled out, \"I can't hould it, sir, it's lepping.\" He reversed his walk\nand I walked beside him. At [this same point] I saw that he\nstruggled to hold the stick out straight and could not prevent it\nfrom pointing straight down towards the earth.\nOn Monday last an engineer, Mr. Allman, came here to pay a\nvisit. I took him outside the hall door and gave him the same twig,\nwhich bj' then was not fresh. He detected the drain from the house\nfoundations at once. He did not know where the water pipe crossed\nthe road, but at the same point at the avenue gate the stick felt so\nheavy that it twisted itself down. He and I crossed the lawn, and\neasily detected every drain in it. Coming to the house, he said,\n\"My fingers are all cramped trying to hold that stick against its\nextraordinary pressure.\"\nMr. Allman was as ignorant of the phenomenon as I was. He was\nmuch interested, and has taken away the stick to find water for his\nfather-in-law, at whose house there is a great scarcity. I may mention\nthat when I held the stick over a water barrel and over the garden\npond it was absolutely inert and remained as a light twig pointing\nout straight before me.\nThese are the plain facts, from which I inier that . . . [your]\nsuggestion that the motion of the twig is due to unconscious muscular\naction is wholly incompatible with my experience. Obviously, having\nseen Mr. Jervois' twig turn upwards, if there were any mental sug-\ngestion, it was that mine should do the same, but, contrary to my\nexpectation, it did exactly the opposite. I felt a downward drag\nwhich I was unable to resist, although employing all my muscular\nforce in the opposite direction. Mr. AUman's hands were blistered\nin his efforts to prevent the twig from turning. There was, I am\nconvinced, a force external to myself pulling against me. [See p. 59.]\nIn the case of Mr. Jervois that force acted in an upward direction,\nand in my case in a downward direction, and when I touched him\non the hand the upward and the downward forces neutralized one\nanother, so that the twig remained inert. . . .\nI send you a snowberry twig, the same as I used.\nYours very sincerely,\nCharles T. Ovenden,\nDean of Clogher.\nP.S.\u2014I have just tested these sticks. The snowberry twig is much\nmore sensitive than the hazel.\n\f56 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.\nI have investigated a number of cases of remarkable success\nwhich Miss Miles had in water-finding. The followin'? is a strik-\ning case, as it comes from the authorities at the Curragh Camp,\nwhere good potable water is difficult to obtain and a supply was\nneeded for a memorial hospital. Captain Greer writes\nCrotanstown, The Curragh,\nCo. KiLDARE, September &th, 1903.\nThe facts relating to the finding of water to supply the Drogheda\nMemorial Hospital are as follows :\nThe AVoods and Forests Department offered a site on The Cur-\nragh for the building of the hospital for a small rent. Before\naccepting this offer the committee responsible for the building had\nto assure themselves that a water supply to the hospital could be\nsecured.\nMiss Miles, hearing of these circumstances, kindly consented to\nendeavour to find by \" divining \" whether a spring existed, under-\nground, in the portion of land embraced in the proposed site for\nthe hospital. (This occurred in the winter of 1896-97 : I think\nJanuary, 1897.) She came here and visited the proposed site with\nMrs. Greer and me. She went backwards and forwards over the\nsite with the divining rod, and for some time could not find a\nspring, though she informed us that there was a large deposit of\nsurface water (she thought about 15 ft. under the surface). After\nconsiderable search she came on a genuine spring, which, after\nmeasuring, she said was about 45 to 50 ft. underground, and quite\nseparate from the deposit of surface drainage. By my orders a well\nwas sunk on the spot over which Miss Miles declared the spring\nexisted. At 17 feet we came on an apparently plentiful supply of\nwater, which resisted an endeavour to pump it dry, lasting for eight\nhours, and we were convinced, in spite of Miss Miles' caution about\nthe surface water, that this was the spring, and we actually built\nin the well and connected the water supply to the hospital. This\nsupply, however, turned out to be surface water. On analysis it\n\u2022 was declared to be of moderate quality, and was used only for\nwashing, drinking water being obtained from a house close to the\nhospital, which was then a small institution.\nIn the following spring the well, which had contained 4 to 5 ft.\nof water, went dry, and then for the first time we realised that\nMiss Miles must have been correct in her diagnosis, and that we\nhad made a well to contain what was merely surface drainage.\n\fMak., 1909. The Dotvsing Rod. 57\nI sunk through the bottom of the well with an Artesian borer,\nand found at 43 ft. a strong spring of perfectly pure water, which\nhas provided the hospital with a perfect water supply ever since.\nJ. H. Greer.\nI gave several cases of the successful use of dowsing in\nAmerica in niy monograph. The late Dr. Hodgson sent me\nmany more : here is one of some interest, as it is from the\nengineer to the Mount Whitney Power Co. in California\nViSALiA, California, May 20th, 1905.\nThe method that some of the well-borers use in locating wells\nis by means of a forked \"switch\" or stick cut from a live tree.\nThey say that the particular kind of a tree makes no difference,\nthe only requirement being that the tree be alive. In using the\nswitch the operator grasps the two branches of the fork in his\nhands and holds the switch upright; with the switch in this posi-\ntion he slowly walks over the ground which he is exploring for\nwater. If an underground stream is passed over, this is indicated\nby the movement of the switch downward, like a pointer. Men\nwith whom I have talked say that, when the underground stream\nis passed over, they can feel the switch twitch or jerk in their\nhands, and that they can feel the tendency of the switch to point\ndownwards, the hands simply following this movement. They also\nsay that they can tell roughly or approximately the amount of\nwater in the stream and the depth below the surface at which it\nwill be found.\nI do not recall now a single well that has been bored wliere\nindicated by the switch that has been a failure ; on the other hand\nmany wells not so located have been failures.\nSome of the evidence that appears rather convincing to me is\nas follows :\nThe company of which I am superintendent had occasion to bore\na well at Lindsay for the town waterworks. This well I had bored\nat a point most convenient with respect to the buildings ; the well-\nborer at this time said that no water or little water would be\nfound, for the stream was twelve feet south of the point selected.\nThe well, however, was bored down to a depth of one hundred and\nfifty feet, a small quantity of water was found, but the amount was\ninsuiEcient. The next year (1903) another well was bored, this\ntime at the point indicated by the switch twelve feet south of the\nfirst one, and an abundant supply of water was found.\n\f58 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1909.\nMr. Robert Berry, of Lindsay, located this well, as well as many\nothers throughout that section.\nAnother instance occurred at Lindsay Heights, where several wells\nwere located by Mr. Berry for Messrs. Hammond and Wishon,\npresident and manager of this company respectively.\nMr. Wishon was on the ground when Mr. Berry was exploring\nfor the wells; and as he was rather sceptical about the method, he\nthought he would try it himself, and was surprised to find that\nthe switch would respond for him as well as it would for Mr.\nBerry. To check the matter further he had Mr. Berrj' walk two\nor three rods ahead of him over the ground with their switches in\nposition. As Mr. Berry would pass over a stream he wouhl\nindicate it ; as Mr. Wishon came to the same point he would say\neach time :\n\" Yes, I feel it.\"\nTwo or three times, to tr}' him, Mr. Berry would not say any-\nthing when he passed over a stream. As Mr. Wishon came over\nthese places he would say: \"Here, Bob, you missed one.\" This\noccurred several times.\nAnother test that I knew of was made by Mr. James N.\nReynolds, of Lindsay. He engaged Mr. Berry to locate a well for\nhim on a certain piece of land ; the point selected Mr. Reynolds\nprivately marked. He then engaged another man, and had him\nlocate a well on the same piece of land. This second man, after\nexploring about with his switch, selected the identical spot that\nMr. Reynolds had marked ; a well has since been bored at this\npoint, and a supply of water has been found. . . .\nCahl H. Holley.\nAs regards the explanation of the dowsing rod, I have seen\nnothing to shake the conclusions which were given in my\nlast report {Proceedings S.P.R., Vol. XV., pp. 313 and 314).\nThat there is no special property possessed by running water\nwhich affects the dowser is shown by his discovery of under-\nground mineral ores, oil wells, etc. Concerning the latter, Miss\nMargaret Benson informed me, on the authority of a personal\nfriend who knew the facts, that in locating the exact spot for\nsinking for petroleum wells in Peru scientific experts are not\nemployed, but always \" instinctive experts.\" A dowser is an\ninstinctive expert, and we may call his peculiar instinct \" a\nsub-conscious transcendental perceptive faculty,\" as I have done,\nor anything else we like. The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, who\nhas both read and seen much about dowsers, writes to me\n\fMae., 1909. The Dowsing Rod. 5!)\n\" All the evidence that I have seen or heard of entirely supports\nyour conclusions, strange though they may appear.\"\nThat the vigorous motion of the rod, one limb often being\nbroken, is really caused by the unconscious muscular action\nof the dowser is, as I have said, hotly contested by every\ndowser, who is persuaded the twig moves his hands, and not\nvice versa. For example. Dr. Eshelby, of Stockton House, near\nWorcester, writing to me about a young farmer in his\nneighbourhood, named Skyrne, who is a very successful dowser,\nsays :\n\" He (Skyrne) tries to resist the motion of the rod, and\nI assured myself of this by clasping his hands tightly in\nmine and then walked over a buried pipe of running water\nat nio'ht-time. The moment we came over where we subse-\n(|uently found the pipe to be, the sensation was as though\nsome one had seized the apex of the forked branch and forcibly\npulled it dov\/n. Our hands resisted this downward movement,\nand the two sides of the forked twig gave way at the spot\nwhere they left his hands, and showed a green-stick fracture.\nI certainly should have detected any muscular movement\nsufficient to break the forked stick, and I know he did not move\nhis hands or wrist, as I had hold of them all the time.\"\nThe extraordinary and often violent motion of the rod was\nnaturally enough during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nattributed to supernormal agency, good or mischievous demons\nas the case might be. Later on, when the use of the rod for\nfinding underground water became more general than its use\nfor locating underground ore and buried treasure, some attrac-\ntive force exerted by the water was urged by the Abbe de\nVallemont and other Cartesian philosophers. But that remark-\nable man, who was really the founder of modern experimental\nscience, the learned Jesuit, Father A. Kircher, showed that if\nthe rod were delicately suspended on some fixed support, no\nmotion whatever was produced on the approach of water or\nmetals. Kircher, two centuries before Chevreul and Carpenter,\ndiscovered the agency of involuntary muscular action.^ There\nare no cases, so far as I know, where any one has shown the\nrod will move over underground water unless held by the\ndowser. It is not any known physical force that attracts the rod.\n^ See my report Proceedinr\/s S.P.R., Vol. XV., p. 276; also Kircher's\nMu7idu.i Subterraneus, 1646, Vol. II., p. 200.\n\f60 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1909.\nOne cannot deny the possibility that some unknown force\nmay be concerned, but what we know of unconscious and in-\nvoluntary muscular action is adequate to explain the ordinary\nsudden movements of the forked twig. There are, it is true,\ncertain extraordinary cases which stretch this hypothesis almost\nmore than it can bear. Such cases are worth careful investi-\ngation by a trained anatomist. It is possible we may have\nto fall back on an involuntary, unconscious cxteriorisation of\nthe muscular force of the dowser. If so, it would bring the\nmotion of the rod into the same category as many of the\n\" physical phenomena \" of spiritualism : for I am convinced\nthere is a much closer connection than is at present recog-\nnised between these latter phenomena and the actual physical\npersonality of the medium.\nPOSSIBLE AUTOMATISM OF YOUNG CHILDEEN.\nBy Sir Oliveij Lodge.\nIt occurs to me that perhaps we have paid insufficient attention\nto what is sometimes called genius, but which may be a\nvariety of automatism, as displayed by young children.\nIf, for instance, it were possible to obtain sensible automatic\nwriting from a very young child, it would be proof of some-\nthing supernormal. But the obvious objection is that it is\nprobably impossible. The only thing that suggests anything\nin the direction of its possibility is the existence of musical\nprodigies, able to play the piano by instinct long before they\ncan have learnt. The most striking case of this, known to\nme, is the Spanish boy Pepito Eodriguez Arriola, who is stated\nto have begun at the age of two and a half and to have\nplayed before musicians and crowned heads before, or about\nthe time that, he was three years old. This boy is authentic,\nas he was seen and reported on by Professor Eichet, when\nhis age was between three and four ; and one of my sons saw\nthe child at Professor Eichet's house.\nI have looked up Professor Eichet's report, which is con-\ntained in the Annates cles Sciences Psychiques for 1900, p. 324.\nIt appears that Pepito, who was born in December, 1896,\nsometimes pretended to write music, but his attempts were\nobviously only imitative, and had no meaning. He did, how-\n\fMa\u00bbr., 1909. Possible Automatism of Young Children. 61\never, frequently improvise on the piano, as well as play from\nmemory. Even if he had only lieard an air in the form of\na song, a few times, he could usually play it with adequate\nharmonies. His execution was unequal. There were times\nwhen he broke down and hesitated for half a minute or so,\nand then suddenly, as if inspired, he began to play again\nvv'ith skill and precision. But although his execution was\ndecidedly less than perfect, the amount of expression he got out\nof his very inferior piano seems to have been amazing. \" II a\nune richesse d'expression etonnante,\" says Professor Eichet.\nAn abstract of Professor Eichet's paper is contained in the\nJournal of the S.P.E., Vol. X., p. 20, where another not alto-\ngether dissimilar case is also quoted, that of Mr. E. C. Eowe\nof Cambridge, who at a later stage was known to me, as well\nas to most Cambridge members of the Society. And in his\ncase even a printed musical score used to give him pleasure\nat an extraordinarily early age.\nIt is probably worth noticing that musical notation has more\nof a natural and less of an artificial character than ordinary\nwriting or printing has. Eelative pitch is clearly represented\nby the spacing of the notes ; absolute pitch is indicated by\nthe simple, though crude, device of \" signature\n;\n\" and though\nthe duration of each sound is recorded in an entirely arbitrary\nmanner, yet the elementary convention involved is such as to\nappeal readily to a very slightly instructed eye,\u2014genius being,\nof course, presupposed.\nThe only thing that is not at all represented by the notation\nis the division into octaves, and the occurrence of musical\nintervals generally. But apart from any knowledge of arith-\nmetical ratios among the frequencies,\u2014the detection of which\ninvolved a certain amount of scientific discovery,\u2014the testhetic\nappreciation of musical intervals must be regarded as a matter\nof direct sensation, existent among people of quite ordinary\nmusical faculty, if not universal.\nTo return to Pepito. Since 1900 I have not heard of\nhim ; but a statement now appears in the papers that his\nhalf-sister, now about four years old, has the same faculty,\nbeing able to play classical music\u2014by ear only, of course ;\u2014\nand a photograph has recently appeared in an illustrated paper\nshowing this child seated, with Pepito standing by her.\n\f62. Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. Mae., 1909.\nISIow, if it be true that a child of between two and four\nyears of age can play the piano, the question arises, Why\nshould they not write also ? To that question, however, I\nsuggest a definite answer.\nThe symbols of writing, and words themselves, are pure\nconventions, having no relation whatever to actual things,\nbeyond convention and mutual agreement based upon historical\ntradition. That is what makes the existing multiplicity of\nhuman languages so profoundly unsatisfactory and hindering to\nthe progress of the race.\nThere is a certain amount of convention about the diatonic\nscale in music, but the sequence of notes in the gamut does\ncorrespond with something in nature ; while even the arrange-\nment of keys on a piano in regular order and succession may\nbe regarded as a natural, and not an artificial phenomenon. For\nits artificiality is of the very simplest character, such as even a\nchild could understand, viz., a series of pieces of wood or bone\nof equal widths, all associated with the notes of a regularly\nascending scale, and such that if any one is struck, the interval\nnecessary to reach any other note may be considered evident\nto a musical genius. The harmonies producible by striking\nnotes simultaneously are also natural phenomena, such as can\nexcite direct and uninstructed appreciation. Hence the act of\ninstinctive playing, although surprising, must be considered\npossible ; while the act of instinctive writing conventional words\nin some human language may have to be considered impossible.\nThe question next arises : Is there anything else, then, that\ncan be done with the hands, of a more natural character\nthan writing ? And the answer is, I think, moulding and\ndrawing. About moulding there would seem to be a minimum\nof convention. Drawing involves some perspective ;\nbut, after\nall, that represents what the eye really sees, though an\nuntrained person is not aware of it. Hence it would seem\nthat an exceptional child might be expected to draw auto-\nmatically, although not to write.\nIt is possible that performances of this kind would not\nattract as much attention from parents as a musical perform-\nance does, nor would they be so likely to be encouraged\nbut it may be well to be on the lookout for them. And it\nis not wise to lay down any restriction as to what may turn\n\fMar., 1909. Possible Automatism of Young Children. 63\nout to be possible, because few things can compete in prima\nfacie incredibility with elaborate musical execution from a\nchild of three.\nA further possibility is worthy of attention. A child may\nbe old enough to be able to write normally, and yet be\nunable to write anything beyond matter of infantile quality.\nThis would be the ordinary state of things ; but in excep-\ntional cases it would seem as if it ought to be possible to\nobtain, through such an automatist, ideas and language as\nmuch beyond its normal capacity as classical music necessarily\nis. The oft-quoted Greek and Hebrew recital of an ignorant\nservant-girl was perhaps of this character, unless it is quite\napocryphal\u2014as seems not unlikely ; at any rate, if any such cases\nare known, they ought to be communicated to the Society.\nBut an obvious caution is necessary. If any such records\nare ever obtained, parents and guardians ought to be very\ncareful not to allow the children to think that there is\nanything uncanny in the proceeding, nor encourage an\nunwholesome amount of attention to it. Wisely dealt with,\nthe script might be made available for scientific purposes\nwithout confusing the normal mind of the child with specu-\nlations concerning its origin and meaning. These may be\npuzzling enougli to anybody, and should no more be emphasised\nin the hearing of the automatist than any other effort of\ngenius should be. Emotion and excitement are utterly unneces-\nsary and out of place in any scientific enquiry.\nIt is a commonplace to say that \" prodigies \" of any kind\nrequire protection from themselves, or, rather, from the public\ncuriosity which they attract ;\nbut, as natural though rare\nphenomena, they may be of the utmost interest for psychological\ninvestigation of a careful and judicious character.\nSOCIETY YOR PSYCHICAL EESEAECH.\n'\nDublin Section.\n[This Report was held over from the February Journal for want\nof space.\u2014Er>.]\nA Meeting of the Dublin Section was lield on Saturday,\nDecember 19th, 1908, at 3.30 p.m., at the Leinster Lecture\nHall, Molesworth Street. Professor Barrett, F.Pi.S., Vice-\n\f64 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1909.\nChairman, presided, and forty-seven members of the Section\nwere present.\nThe Chairman briefly reviewed the history of the Section\nto date, and pointed out the various directions in which\nresearches could be undertaken by members.\nMr. Fournier d'Albe, Hon. Secretary, exhibited a modified\nplanchette, designed to test whether the writing produced was\never done otherwise than by normal automatic muscular action.\nIt consisted of an ordinary planchette, from which the castors\nhad been removed. The planchette thereupon assumed an in-\nclined position, the inclination to the paper depending solely\nupon the length of the pencil. Such an inclined planchette could\nbe used for ordinary automatic writing without much ditticulty,\nbut as soon as a postcard was interposed between the hand\nand the planchette, writing by normal muscular action became\nimpossible, as did also the drawing of a circle, or of any curve\nhaving a component in the direction pointing from the tip of\nthe pencil towards the centre of the edge in contact with the\npaper. The interposition of a postcard did not interfere with\nthe action of the ordinary planchette, for he had obtained such\nwriting (which appeared to be unconscious) with the postcard\ninterposed. As regards writing with the new \" test plan-\nchette,\" he thought he had obtained it on two occasions with\none writing medium, but until the experiment had been many\ntimes repeated he could not be sure whether the test conditions\nhad been strictly observed.\nAt the request of the Chairman, Mr. T. H. Webb exhibited\nand explained the action of the \" Ouija,\" through which, he\nsaid, he had obtained many communications purporting to come\nfrom deceased relatives.\nProfessor Barrett gave a short summary of the theory of\ncross-correspondences, with illustrations from his own experi-\nence and from the data accumulated by the Parent Society.\nCanon Carmichael wished, he said, to rectify some errors\nwhich had got abroad with respect to the objects of their Section.\nMembers were not necessarily identified with spiritualism or\nwith any other interpretation of the phenomena studied. All\nthat was expected of them was an open mind with regard to\nthe existence of supernormal phenomena, and a desire to take\nsome part in the laborious task of elucidating them.\n\fNo. CCLVIII.\u2014Vol. XIV.

After seeing the fjords as far north\nas Trondlijem we came south to Stavanger, which we reached Mondaj^,\nJuly 13th.\nWe knew nothing whatever about the town beyond that there\nwas a cathedral and an old church now converted into a school.\nAfter strolling round for some time we happened on what we thought\n^ Some earlier experiences of Miss Grieve's have already been printed in the\nJournal, namely a case of collective crj^stal vision (Vol. X., p. 13-t) ; a short\nseries of experiments in thought-transference (Vol. X., p. 260); and an appari-\ntion of a friend, apparently visible also to Miss Grieve's ilog (Vol. XIII., p. 27,\nFebruary, 1907).\n\f66 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil, 1909.\nwas this old churcli (it was in reality the cathedral), and entered.\nThe moment I closed the door behind me I felt a strange and\ndecidedly unpleasant feeling\u2014as if something or some one was present\nI could not see. I looked at Miss Baughan to see if she noticed\nanything, but she was already half-way up the aisle and deej) in the\ndog-toothing and designs on the beautiful old Norman pillars and\narches. Quite suddenly, about 6 feet above my head and a little in\nfront of me, appeared a shadowy forearm and hand ; most conspicuous\nwas the hand, pointing. It hovered for a moment where I first saw\nit and then slowly turned towards Miss Baughan, but passed her,\nand pointed steadily towai'ds the chancel. Presently, from a side\nchapel behind the chancel, came a man, apparently a tourist like\nourselves. The hand immediately pointed at him and followed him\nwherever he went. After a few minutes he left the church, and the\nvisionary hand slowly faded from my sight. I regret to say I did\nnot say anything to Miss Baughan at the moment, but told her the\nsame evening when we got back to our hotel.\nWe looked into the cathedral on our way back in the evening\n(before I told her of the vision) but there was no one there, and I\nsaw nothing and had no unpleasant feeling. The old verger outside\ncould not speak English at all, and neither of us had enough Norwegian\nto inquire about legends, so we left Stavanger without any sort of\nclue to the meaning of the vision. Immediately on my return to\nAberdeen, I went down to the Free Library and searched among\nbooks on Norway for legends of Stavanger. At last in Norwegian\nBy-ways, by Charles W.

I certainly had never read or even heard of Norwegian By-ivays.\nHad I done so the tale would certainly have lost interest from a\npsychical point of view, but would have been far more interesting\nto me, for I should have experimented (as the author did) and linked\narms with my friend to see if she could see the hand then.\n\fApril, 1909. \" Spirit Hands,\" Suggestion and Bogs. 67\nThe arm ended at the elbow ; it was only a forearm, shadow-like\nbut white, and the hand much whiter and therefore more distinct.\nThe elbow end simply tailed off from white to grey to nearly black,\nso that it faded into the surrounding shadows of the cathedral aisle,\nabout 10-12 feet above the ground.\nIt just appeared in mid-air, not from behind any obstacle. I had\nbeen looking round uncomfortably for some minutes and could see\nnothing, and quite suddenly the pointing hand was there where I\nhad looked many times before. No, the actual point where it left\noff was not visible to me ; I saw as far as the elbow and then it\nmerged into the general atmosphere. The date was July 13th,\n1908\nB. H.

The following is the account there given (pp. 13-16):\nNever can I forget an evening spent there [at Stavanger Cathedral]\nyears ago waiting for the steamer. . . .\nWe were a party of four friends, and the writer alone remains\nto tell the tale. . . . We were the only Englishmen in the place\nand waited the Bergen boat.\nIt was evening and a glorious sun was sinking westward. I\nhad obtained the key at the fire-station (it is still kept there) and\nwith some difficulty had persuaded the others to visit the cathedral.\nSport, they declared, was more in their line than architecture.\nWe strolled up the narrow, hilly street, and had it to ourselves.\nDaylight was waning as the door slowly rolled back on its hinges,\nand we all passed into the impressive silence and solitude of the\nempty church. The Norman arches, softened by the gloaming,\nstood out in all their beauty.\nI don't know what it was, and shall never know, but as we walked\nthrough the aisles criticising the work, noting the dog-tooth moulding\non the arches between the pillars, here and tliere varied by the\nold Norwegian and interesting dragon-tracery\u2014as we moved about\ncontemplating minute detail and general effect, a strange feeling\ncame over me, a sensation or conviction of some unseen presence\nhovering about us. It thrilled me from head to foot with an\nemotion never felt before and never since.\nI glanced at the others. Two seemed absorbed in the building\nand in that alone; the third, Sir John Dacre, youngest of all\nhe was only just twenty\u2014was evidently under the same strange\n\f68 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

He\nused to say that he had the gift of second sight ; and his mother,\nold Lady Margaret, was descended from a long line of ancestors\nwho had all believed in or possessed the faculty to the point of\nsuperstition. She still lives, though her boy, as she yet fondly\ncalls him, has been lying for twelve long years in the chapel of\nthe old castle. They were Scotch of the Scotch.\nI looked at Dacre, his eyes met mine, and each felt conscious\nof something withheld from the others. Then he linked his arm\nin mine and we went up the long aisle towards the communion-table.\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\"The place is haunted. Do you see nothing?\"\nI shook my head.\n\"Look,\" pointing down the aisle we had just traversed. Whether\nthat interlacing of arms in some way communicated his power for\nthe moment, certain it is that I plainly saw the outlines of a shadowy\nform, whilst a hand appeared to hover over the heads of the two\nwho were standing in the aisle. The other hand pointed towards us.\n\"It is intended for me, not for you,\" said Sir John; \"I noticed\nit when we all stood together, and the hand carefully avoided\nyou.\"\n\" But what does it mean ?\n\" And even as I spoke the ghostly\napparition, or whatever you may choose to call it, seemed to slowly\nfade from sight.\n\" It means death \u2014a warning ; call it what you will. Not\nnecessarily immediate ; in fact I should say some years will first\npass : but we shall all three die young, and all within a short\ntime of each other. I shall be the first to go, for the hand first\ncame to me ; but the others will not tarry long.\"\nHe spoke calmly as though making the most common-place remark,\nbut it was assumed; in reality I saw that he was much moved. . . .\nSome years went on, and then, as he had predicted and in the\norder indicated, came the end.\nYou ask what the ghost was like ? I can hardly tell you, it\nwas so shadowy and insubstantial. The most visible part was the\nhand that seemed to float over their heads and the finger that\npointed.\nMr. Wood informs the Editor of the Journal that this incident\ntook place between twenty and thirty years ago, and that he\nhad not heard of any apparition having been seen there since\n(except the case above recorded). In regard to the question\n\fApkil, 1909. \"Spirit Hands,\" Suggestion and Dogs. 69\nwhether his own experience had been published elsewhere, he\nwrites that his Nonuegian By-ivays first appeared in the Argosy\nMagazine, but that he feels sure the story has not been mentioned\nin any guide-book.\nMiss Grieve writes :\n\" I am quite certain there was no\nreference whatever [to the story] in Baedeker, which was the\nonly guide-book we had.\" It is, of course, possible that at\nsome previous time she had seen or heard of Mr. Wood's\naccount and completely forgotten it, in which case the apparition\nwould represent a revived subliminal memory. But her account\nshows that, if this was so, it had been so completely forgotten\nthat she was not reminded of it again, either by seeing the\napparition or by reading the book.\nMr. Wood has informed me that, as is obvious, Dacre was\nnot the name of his friend : the Dacres held the Southern\nBorder against the Scots. Miss Grieve gave me the name and\naddress, recorded in the hotel book, of the Irish tourist whom\nthe hand followed. I may add that she is not in the way of\nseeing uncanny things ; the only two instances are the hand\nand the phantasm of a friend, viewed by herself and her dog,\na much respected Dandy Dinmont terrier, on August 6, 1906\n(see Journal, February, 1907, pp. 27-30).\nIn that case Miss Grieve, on the top of Skelfhill, in Teviot-\ndale, saw a friend, a lady, whose dress she minutely describes\nbut the friend was in Cornwall. \" I was so surprised that I\ndid not say anything for a second or two, till the dog began\nto growl.\" Miss Grieve pursued the appearance, and \" Turk\nbarked and growled the whole time, but kept close to my\nheels and would not run out as he usually does at strange\npeople or strange dogs.

Turk, probably,\nhad often seen Miss Grieve silent \" for a second or two,\" and\nthat was all the suggestion that she gave, and Turk growled,\nas she informed me at the time, before she spoke. Nothing\nthat Turk could do was apt to suggest the presence of her\nfriend to Miss Grieve.\nIf suggestion did not affect either Turk or Miss Grieve,\nsomething of unknown nature was there which affected Miss\nGrieve, and, in his doggish way, affected Turk.

We were sitting in a loom by a fire, with the\ndoor shut ; I reading, the dog sleeping on the floor. I was roused\nfrom my book by the dog\u2014Dan's\u2014growling, and stooped to talk to\nhim and console him ; and while stroking him, as he continued to\ngrowl, I followed the direction of his gaze with mine (I had to turn\nin my chair to do so), and saw to my astonishment a figure in a\ngrey gown by the door, its face hidden from me by a plant which\nstood between us on a table. In my surprise I took it to be my\nsister, and addressed it, asking how she had returned so quickly\nand quietly. Then, recollecting that I was alone in the house and\nthe outer doors locked, I got up hastily and Dan sprang towards\nthe figure, which disappeared, the door remaining shut. The dog\nshowed every symptom of fear and anger\u2014lowered head, glaring\neyes, hair erect all down his spine. He was evidently convinced\n\fApril, 1909. \" Spirit Hands,\" Suggestion and Dogs. 71\nthat some one was there, for on my opening the door of the room\nhe tore out barking and rushed up and down stairs in a vain chase\nafter the visitor, whom I need not say we failed to find. The house\nwas empty, and I was quite glad a little later to hear the bell ring\nand to let my sister in. I have no theories on the subject, nor can\nI in any way connect the appearance of my strange visitor with\nanything that happened before or since. But I am absolutely certain\nthat Dan and I did see something, though I can bring no other\nwitnesses to speak for us.\n(Mks.) Emma L. Darton.\nMrs. Darton writes further :\nii2 York Mansions, Battersea Park, S.W.,\nFehruary 23rd, 1909.\nDear Sir, \u2014I am very glad to give the particulars for which you\nask. (a) There were no servants in the house at the time, nor\nwould it have been possible for any pei'son to have escaped our\nnotice, as Dan and I were in the passage outside the door (which\nwas shut until I opened it) within a moment of the figure's dis-\nappearance. The room is on the first floor, (b) The house is in a\ncountry village, and stands about 15 yards from the village street\nin its own garden, (c) This is my only experience of an apparition,\nthough I have, as I suppose most people have, had sensations\nimplying the presence of the unseen.\nI might add that the house is one in which the sound of a\nperson moving is very audible, and footsteps coming along this\nparticular passage are always heard in the room and on the floors\nabove and below.\nI do not feel certain that any of my relations in the present\ngeneration have had any experiences of the kind, but my grand\nfather, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, the novelist, used to assert that\nhe saw this sort of thing constantly.\nEmma L. Darton.\nF.S. \u2014I told my sister of the appearance on her return.\nIn this case I surmise that the figure in grey was what\nthe Eev. Robert Kirke (ob. 1692) calls the co-walker of the\npercipient's sister. It was \" an arrival case \" ; the lady was on\nher way home. Such cases are very common ; the Scandi-\nnavians have a special name for them. As to suggestion, why\nshould the growling of the dog, who would not growl at his\n\f72 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Perhaps Mr.\nMyers's term, psychorrhagy, is the right word to use in such\ncases. I have a third case, a precise parallel to the second\n(bar the absent sister). The percipient was an eminent\npainter, an intimate friend of mine, and the dog began it.\nBut my friend knew that the figure in grey had once been\nseen by his wife in the room where he sat. He has had no\nother visual hallucination, but you may invoke suggestion, as\nthe appearance had once been seen before, and a lot of\npoltergeist was about.\nCASES.\nL. 1174.

Suddenly the room began\nto rock ; the pictures swung out from the walls, and the ornaments\non the chimney-piece rattled. I said to Major : \" Do you\nthink this is an earthquake ? \" and he answered :\n\" It looks uncom-\nmonly like it.\" Then suddenly the whole room seemed to rise up\ntowards me ;\nmy two companions were turned over, chairs and all,\nand the whole of the breakfast things shot into my lap.

The first news of the earthquake reached Mrs. Aitken (Miss.\nAitken's sister-in-law) with the morning paper, probably the Scotsman,\nat breakfast, after a dream which was before 5 a.m.\nIt was, I think, about three weeks ago that Miss Aitken told\nme of her sister-in-law's letter.

Owen, of Hanley, Camberley, Surrey, whose daughter, Mrs.\nComyn, had a vivid dream of her mother a few hours before\nthe latter's death, which, as stated in the Times of October\n14th, 1908, occurred on October 11th. Mrs. Comyn's account,\nextracted from a letter dated November l7th, 1908, is as\nfollows :\nI will write out exactly what appeared to me, but I cannot say\nwhether I was asleep or dozing, but all was quite clear to me at\nthe time. On Saturday night I went to bed, the 10th ; first about\n4.30 I was awakened by three distinct scratchings on the door,\nwhich were also heard by the servants in their room at the top of\nthe house. I then dozed off, and whether really asleep I cannot\nsay, but there appeared to me my mother, looking very young,\nnot more than 18 or 19. She was very pretty, lovely pink and white\nface, round beautiful eyes, also a great deal of brown hair ; she\nwas dancing about, when suddenly I heard singing, which seemed\nto come closer and closer, as if hundreds of voices (women's voices).\nMy mother was there, and these voices sang and sang, at last so\nloudl}', and seemed so powerful, that I then awoke, feeling my head\nin a whirl with the deafening voices ;\nmy ears sang from the effect,\nand I felt very ill. I fancy this was between 5.30 and 6.30 a.m.\non the morning oi the 11th. It must have been her soul soaring\nupwards, and she disappeared from sight.\nMrs. Comyn adds on November 23rd, 1908 :\nWhen I saw my vision I heard the music distinctly coming nearer\nand nearer to my mother, and when it came closer she disappeared\ninto the midst of these voices. She did not smile at me, but was\nsmiling all the time in my dream. The singing was like that of\nangels, but I did not see the angels ; but she went up with the\nvoices, it seemed like amongst angels.\n(Signed) SoPHXA A.

April, 1909.\nnot, but heard the sound of many sweet and high voices quickly\nincreasing in volume. She now perceived the presence of her\nmother, looking young as a girl, fair and pleasant. Her mother did\nnot look at her, but disappeared as the voices became lost.\nMy wife became very apprehensive, knowing of her mother's\nillness. Next morning at breakfast she ate nothing, and on a\ntelegraph boy's arrival told me to open the message. I did so, and\nread the sad death of Mrs. Owen. The servants told me later that\nthey had heard the scratching, but had seen nothing, and heard\nnothing more.\nJ. Sarsfield Comyn,\nDep. Surgeon-General A. M.S.\nDr. Comyn adds later :\nFehj. Qih, 1909.\nMy wife told me of her vision on Sunday morning, and the\ntelegram from her father arrived at breakfast time the same day.\nI opened it at her request, she being then under the gravest appre-\nhension regarding her mother.\nJ. Sarsfield Comyn. -\nP.S. \u2014The vision was about 5.30 on Sunday morning.\nGeneral Owen, in sending the account, states that the shock\nso prostrated Mrs. Comyn that she could not attend the\nfuneral, and adds :\nThe description she here gives of her mother corresponds exactly\nwith what she was when young. Her mother had a beautiful\ncomplexion, and large lovelj' eyes with deep soft expression, and\nbrown hair\u2014plentiful then, although thin of late. The time of\nthe vision was that of the last fatal attack, which lasted from\nabout 6 to 8 a.m., and she was all this time quite insensible. Mrs.\nOwen had a strong idea that human beings had guardian angels\nwatching over and assisting them in dangers and troubles, and\nalways had a cast of a guardian angel hung above her bed. Although\nMrs. Owen had been ill for a couple of weeks, neither I nor the\nnurse attending her, nor, I think, the doctor, thought she was going\nto die until an hour before the end ; the doctor had declared she\nwas better the day before. Mrs. Comyn had no reason to think so,\nas the accounts she had received were favourable.\nCharles H.

Apkil, 1909.\nEEVIEW.\nNew Light on Immortality. By E. E, Fournib;r D'Albe. Longmans,\nGreen and Co. London, 1908. 334 pp. 6\/- net.\nThe title-page of this book, with its description of the author as Hon.\nSecretary of the Dublin Section of the Society for Psychical Research,\nis somewhat misleading. It led us to look first for a discussion of\nthe I'ecent investigations conducted by the S.P.R. into the problem\nof survival. We found these just referred to, but not discussed, in\na passage at the close of the book. For the rest, the phenomena\nof the type dealt with by the S.P.K. \u2014referred to as evidence support-\ning the theories advanced in the book, date for the most part from\na period of over thirty years ago. These phenomena, curious and\npuzzling as some of them are, can hardly be made to shed \" New\nLight on Immortality \" unless they are carefully discussed from the\npoint of view of some new theory.\nSuch a discussion is not seriously attempted by our author. For\nthe most part he contents himself with quoting a miscellaneous\nselection of extracts of very diverse values from the writings of\nothers on these subjects. He merely uses the alleged facts as\nillustrations of his theories, and makes no attempt to criticise the\nevidence on which his facts rest. He seems equally willing to ex-\nplain a rap as produced by supernormal as by normal means, and\nappears indeed to have a bias towards the supernormal explanation.\nFor he mentions raps obtained in the presence of Miss Kate Fox\nin the text of his book, while he relegates her \" confession \" of\nfraud, with a caution against its too ready acceptance, to a footnote.\nNo trace is shown of any feeling that a very careful scrutiny of\nthe evidence for so-called supernormal phenomena is not only\njustifiable but necessary before these phenomena can be urged in\nsupport of any theory. We are free to confess that the effect upon\nus of reading the third part of the book, in which psychical matters\nare chiefly referred to, was a distinct weakening of the effect of\nthe first two parts, in which the peculiar theories of the book are\ndeveloped. For a theory that can be made to explain \" the alleged\n'\nexposures ' of honest mediums \" by the recombination of two forms\nand by the non-dematerialisation of drapery is apt to repel the\nserious investigator of matters psychical. It would, however', be a\npity if the unsatisfactory nature of Part III. prevented readers from\ntaking up the book at all. For Mr. Fournier D'Albe's speculations\nmake very interesting reading. So long as they are regarded meiely\nas speculations and nothing more, little can be urged against them\nin the way of criticism. The idea that the soul may consist of\nsome lO^s psychomeres, which pass out of the body at the time of\ndeath and float together to some higher stratum of the atmosphere,\nis harmless as a hypothesis and leads to a good deal of interesting\ntheorising and to some clever pieces of writing on the part of the\n\fApril, 1909. Review. 79\nauthor. But it does not, so far as we can see from the book, find\npositive support in any known physical or physiological facts, while\nit fails to give any adec[uate explanation of the very uncertain\nphenomena urged in its support.\nIn fact the sole support of all the theories in the book\u2014and\nthese theories are claimed to give \"New Light on Immortality\"\nlies in ignorance rather than in knowledge. Now ignorance may\nfairly be allowed to open the door to speculations outside the\npale of scientific orthodoxy, but it is not a safe key wherewith to\nunlock the inner chambers of truth. Some such attempt has been\nmade with it by our author. Starting from the fact that we know\nvery little of the behaviour of individual atoms of matter, and still\nless of the meaning of the reactions of inorganic and organic\nchemistry, he deduces the conclusion that a materialistic hypothesis\nbased upon a mechanical view of life has but a weak foundation.\nBut he is not content with this, and proceeds to construct a rival\nhypothesis.\nHis own scheme of nature is essentially this Life and freedom for\nthe individual hold right down the scale from man to atom, and\nprobably further. Our so-called natural laws apply only to aggregates\nof individuals, and correspond to the social laws governing the be-\nhaviour of masses of men. Much is said by way of analogy in support\nof this idea. From the nature of the case little can be said by way of\nproof. But the conclusions derived from this hypothesis are freely\nscattered throughout the book in such a form that the ordinary reader\nmight easily take them for statements of scientific fact. There is a\nserious danger for the general public in such treatment as this.\nA parade of scientific knowledge, in the absence of any careful\ndiscrimination between the purely speculative parts of a theory and\nthose which are experimentally demonstrable, is apt to mislead the\nnon-scientitic reader, and we should wish to record a most emphatic\nprotest against some of the expressions in the book. The list of\nconclusions given in the last chapter, unaccompanied as it is by\ncertain very necessary cpialifications, is a sample of the statements\nto which we think strong objection should be taken.\nThe book has been put forward in the hope that it may provide the\nbasis of a working hypothesis of a future life which may be accepted\nby scientists and theologians alike. Like so many eirenicons, we fear\nthat it is likely to be rejected by both sides. Few scientists\nwill have the patience to read it through, and those who do so will\npnjbably remain unconvinced. Few theologians will find it possible\neither to fit its conclusions into their present theories or to build up\non its basis truer and deeper views of the universe. The book seems\nto fail wherever it aims at the serious discussion or solution of difficult\nproblems. If it could be reissued as a series of delightful speculations\nwith no claim to a true scientific character, we would gladly welcome\nit. As it is, since the writer has in all seriousness attacked a most\ndifficult problem, it seems necessary to point out the fundamental\ndefects in his attempted solution of it.\nF. J. M.

April, 1909.\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nIn the February-March, 1909, number of Tlie Journal of Abnormal\nPsyclwloriy, Dr. Morton Prince continues his monograph on The\nUnconscious. By the unconscious he means the neural dispositions\nwhich persist as the pliysiological residua of conscious experiences.\nUnder certain conditions the ideas making up an experience tend\nto become organised into a system or complex, and when the\nexperience is past, tlie mental complex is said to become dormant\nand the correlated nervous complex unconscious. The subsequent\nfunctioning of such dormant complexes is part of the ordinary\nmechanism of memory. But if the complex becomes dissociated so\nthat it cannot be synthetised with the main stream of consciousness,\nits functioning gives rise to the phenomenon of co-consciousness\n(usually called sub-consciousness). In certain psychological states it\nis a question whether we have to do with a physiological complex\nwithout consciousness, or with a co-conscious complex.\nW. D. Scott defends the thesis that the psycho-analj' tic method\nof Breuer and Freud (see Human Personalitij, Vol. I., p. 50) is nothing\nmore than an unusually skilful application of the method of\nsuggestion, and that it offers no proof for the existence of sub-\nconscious complexes of suppressed emotional ideas.\nAn abstract is given of a case of suicide prevented by a hallucina-\ntion wliich was lecorded by Th.

The following\nMembers of Council were present : Mr. W. W. Baggally, the\nRt. Hon. Gerald W. Balfour, Professor W. F. Barrett, Mr. E.\nN. Bennett, Sir William Crookes, the Hon. Everard Feilding,\nthe Rev. A. T. Fryer, Sir Lawrence Jones, Sir Oliver Lodge,\nMr. W. M'Dougall, Mr. J. G. Piddington, Mr. St. G. L. Fox\nPitt, Lieut.-Colonel G. L. Le M. Taylor, Dr. C. Lloyd Tuckey,\nand Mrs. Verrall ; also Miss Alice Johnson, Eesearch Officer,\nand Miss Isabel Newton, Secretary.\nThe minutes of the last Meeting of the Council were read\nand signed as correct.\nThree new Members and thirty-one new Associates were\nelected. Their names and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly accounts for January and February, 1909,\nwere presented and taken as read.\nOn the proposal of Sir Oliver Lodge, seconded by Sir\nLawrence Jones, the Right Hon. Gerald W. Balfour was elected\na member of the Committee of Reference.\nIt was decided that the front rooms of the office should be\nre-decorated, and the Secretary was instructed to obtain an\nestimate for painting and papering, etc., and to submit it to\nthe House and Finance Committee.\nAn application for the recognition of a Local Section at\nPhiladelphia was brought forward ; and on the proposal of\nProfessor Barrett, seconded by Mr. G. W. Balfour, the applica-\ntion was granted.\n\f84 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1909.\nThe President's Introductory Note to the forthcoming Eeport\non Sittings with Eusapia Palladino was read, and after discussion\nand amendment, approved of.\nOn the President's proposal, seconded by Mr. Piddington, a\nvote of thanks was passed to Mr. G. B. Dorr for the work he\nhas been doing for the Society with Mrs. Piper, and the great\ntrouble he has taken in the matter.\nA letter was read from Mr. Frank Podmore resigning his\nseat on the Council. The Council commissioned the Hon.\nSecretary to convey to him their cordial recognition of his\ngreat services to the Society and their deep regret at his\nwithdrawal.\nPermission was given to Mr. Podmore to make use of some\ncases in the Proceedings and Journal for a book on psychical\nresearch on which he is now engaged.\nThe Council filled the vacant place among their elected\nMembers by appointing to it Dr. P. C. S. Schiller, hitherto a\nco-opted member.\nPPJVATE MEETING FOPt MEMBEES AND ASSOCIATES.\nThe 26th Private Meeting of the Society for Members and\nAssociates only was held in the large Hall at 20 Hanover Square,\nLondon, W., on Tuesday, March 30th, 1909, at 4 p.m.; the\nPresident, Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, in the chair.\nMiss Alice Johnson read a paper on \" Some Incidents in\nthe Script of Mrs. Holland,\" which it is hoped will appear later\nin the Proceedings.\nMENTAL TYPES: A SUGGESTION FOE EXPEEIMENTS.\nBy Edward Bullough.\nThe following method of experimenting, with a view to estab-\nlishing the personal identity of \" controls,\" occurred to me a\nlittle while ago as offering perhaps a novel chain of problems\nof relatively easy access.\nHitherto the proofs of such identity have been attempted\nby showing that the contents of manifestations or communica-\ntions, the jmrjm't of messages from the controls, correspond to\nor are identical with the experience (memories, associations,\n\fMay, 1909. Mental Types : A Suggestion for Experiments. 85\netc.), which the deceased and \" controlling \" personality was\nknown to have possessed. Such a line of testing is indeed\nthe most natural, and the advantage of such a \" proof by\ncontent \" is unquestionably its relatively objective validity. It\nfurthermore appears that to those who personally knew the\ndeceased, the communications seemed in many cases also\nstrikingly characteristic of the person, not in respect to their\ncontent, but by reason of the particular form which the message\ntook. Thus an acquaintance of the late Mr. X, might feel\nwith regard to a certain communication: \"This is just how X.\nwould have put it \" ; the convincing point being not so much\nI'jhat was said, but hoiv it was said. The \" life-likeness \" of\ncommunications which is bound to carry much conviction with\nthose to whom they are addressed is obviously founded largely\nupon this characteristic form of the messages. At the same\ntime it is evident that such a formal similarity between the\nturn of phrase of the message and the turn of mind of the\ndeceased can only be of definite value to the person who\nenjoyed his acquaintance, and would carry little weight beyond\nbeing \" subjectively convincing \"\u2014if I may say so\u2014in that\nsense.\nNow the point of my suggestion lies in the fact that the\nmethod proposed would from this side\u2014the side of form\u2014too\nbe capable of yielding objectively valid results, accessible to\ncloser and more precise study than so-called \" characteristic\nexpressions \" usually are : and that, combined with \" proofs by\ncontent,\" they might form a valuable reinforcement of the\nlatter. Even if found useless from this point of view, experi-\nments on these lines might help to cast a little light upon\nthe unknown conditions of communication, created by the co-\noperation, and probable interference, of a second\u2014the medium's\n\u2014mind.\nThe suggestion is based upon the assumption that it is not\nmerely in respect of the content or matter of experience and\nits elaboration that one mind differs from another, but that\npersons differ also, and more fundamentally, by reason of the\nparticular type of mind which they severally possess, and which\nin its turn determines only secondarily the selection and\nutilisation of experience at large. Thus two persons might,\neven with complete identity of experience (of course, an impos-\n\f86 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1909.\nsible case), yet differ in the forvi of their mentality. This in its\nwider sense is self-evident ;\nevery one recognises at once that\nthe late F. W. H. Myers was of a cast of mind different from\nthe late Edmund Gurney or the late Dr. Hodgson ; but in this\ngeneral sense this fact could not be subjected to experimentation\nor tests. It would be necessary to select less vague and more\nhidden peculiarities of the mind, peculiarities less likely to\ndraw attention to themselves, and therefore less exposed to\nimitation (by the medium's subliminal mind or secondary per-\nsonalities), in order to obtain definite data for comparison.\nThe peculiarities I have in view are those differences which\nare known to exist between certain types of mind, described\nas \" visual,\" \" auditive,\" \" motor,\" etc., types, with their sub-\ndivisions or modifications, each possessing its own kind of\n\" imagery,\" memory and associations, organised upon the basis\nof its particular type. Although the majority of people are of\na mixed type, relatively pure examples are by no means\ninfrequent, and can easily be detected by means of a few test-\nquestions. Let us assume that a representative of the auditive\ntype tries to communicate to another, say the meeting with\na person, unknown to the latter : the question, what was he\nlike ? would meet with little response ; the answer would\nprobably be : he has a very agreeable voice and said . . .\nof the external appearance nothing, except generalities, would\nbe remembered ;\nnothing of those minor details which alone stamp\na person's appearance as characteristic of him and him alone. On\nthe other hand, it would be manifestly useless to ask a \" visual\nfor a description of an auditive impression, as I know from per-\nsonal experience. There is nothing more difficult for me than to\ndescribe, for instance, a concert, as, in spite of the momentary\nenjoyment of the music, I cannot remember the music itself,\nthough I may vaguely recall specially striking passages, by\nmeans of motor-images. Even within the visual sphere, my\ncolour-memory is less reliable than my linear-memory, and I\nusually notice the outlines of objects more easily than their\ncolouring. Thus for each individual type the differences can\nbe refined beyond the main distinctions.\nSuch peculiarities, if at all pronounced, generally lead to\nthe working of the whole mental apparatus on the lines of\nthe special tendencies. \" Visuals \" organise their present ex-\n\fMay, 1909. Mental Types: A Suggestion for Experiments. 87\nperiences as well as their memory of past ones on a visual,\n\" auditives \" on an auditive basis, etc., and can communicate\nexperiences only in terms of their particular imagery.\nThese considerations may suggest the following possibilities\n(1) Differences of type may constitute a special difficulty to\ntelepathic communication. As I have personally no experience\nwhatever, I must appeal to the experience of others, who may\nprove this to be a merely imaginary obstacle. Is it possible\nto communicate to a \" non-visual \" the visual image of an\nobject, say a cross ? can you convey to him the image \" + \" or\nonly the word-image \" cross,\" or the motor-image \" x \" or the\ngeneral idea \" cross \" ? If \" cross \" is conveyed at all, how has\nit been transferred to him ? This, it seems to me, would be a\ncase in which the interference of the second mind might be\nexperimentally tested.\nThere is undoubtedly the difficulty that telepathic \" experi-\nments \" of a complicated nature are at present not yet sufficiently\ndeveloped to allow of tests of this kind. It might, however,\nbe a step towards approaching them from the experimental side,\nto apply the test to cases of elementary thought-transference, such\nas were undertaken by the Society some years ago. Might\nnot, even in such elementary attempts to transfer an idea or\nimage, instances of failure be due to some extent to incompati-\nbility of mental type ? Among the few successful telepathic\nexperiments of a complex kind, those of the Misses Miles and\nEamsden could perhaps prove of the greatest value. In what\nform of imagery do they attempt to convey or receive their\ntransmitted thoughts ? To what degree is there any original\nagreement of mental type between them ?\n(2) A complication might arise from the fact that, as it\nseems, the missing types of imagery of the waking-state are\nregained in dream-states. At least in the \" hypnagogic \" con-\ndition, non-visuals recover their visualising power and visual\nimagery. Does the subliminal consciousness always retain its\nimagery complete, while only the supraliminal consciousness\nrepresents a special type ? Yet, as I believe Miss Goodrich-\nFreer pointed out, visualising power is essential for crystal-\ngazing. What conditions prevail in trance-states ? Ketention\nof the ordinary type or recovery of missing imagery ?\n(3) The application of these ideas to the messages purporting\n\f88 Journal of Society for Psychical Researclt. May, 1909.\nto come from the dead is obvious. The agreement or disagree-\nment of the terms of a communication with the known imagery\npossessed by its \" control \" during his terrestrial existence might\nbe of considerable value, especially if by means of numerous\npreliminary experiments with living subjects the positive im-\nportance of such an agreement could be shown. If it were\nobjected that the conditions after death could hardly be brought\ninto comparison with life here, as regards mental imagery,^ it\ncould be urged in return that, since a certain mind on this\nside was of a certain type, this mind's memory could, in the\nbeyond, scarcely be changed in respect to terrestrial experiences\nwhich were all organised on the lines of this particular type,\nwhich only existed for him, so to speak, in terms of this type\nand could not well be communicated in any other terms. It\nwould, for the same reason, appear unreasonable to expect from\na \" non-visual,\" for instance, information, intended for purposes\nof identification, which could only be given in visual terms.\nThat there must have been in some measure obstacles of this\nkind seems to me evident, in the failure, for instance, to\ncorrectly convey test-passages from writings, or the difficulty\nexperienced by \"Hodgson\" in communicating the word \"Arrow\"\n{Proceedings S.P,E., Vol. XXII. pp. 77-86).\nThe ideal problem would be, in the case of an individual of a\nclearly-established, pure type, attempting to communicate through\na medium, whose ordinary, as well as trance-imagery (if\nnecessary ?) is known, to ascertain to what extent these messages\nconform to the type previously exhibited by him, or to what\nextent deviations from it might be referable to the interferences\nof the medium. This latter question could easily be separately\nstudied by means of telepathic experiments and suggestions with\nsubjects in the waking state, in trance and uiider hypnosis.\nThese suggestions are not only intended for the study of the\n\" controls \" now upon the scene, although it would probably be\npossible to form a fairly accurate idea of Mr. Myers', Mr.\n^ The theoretical objection based upon the presumable physiological connexion\nbetween imagery and certain brain-centres, according to which imagery naturally\nceases with the destruction of the brain at death, is a fundamental difficulty\nattaching to all \"communications,\" and need not be specially considered here,\nthe more so as it can be met by the same explanations which have been advanced\nas rendering the facts of communications from surviving personalities possible.\n\fMat, 1909. Mental Types : A Saggestion for Experiments. 89\nGurney's or Dr. Hodgson's imagery from their writings. In\norder to render the proceedings truly experimental and of\n\" prospective \" utility, the experiments ought to iuclude especially\nthe study of the mental types of living beings, of such, for\ninstance\u2014if the mention of names may be excused\u2014as Sir Oliver\nLodge, Prof. William James, Mr. Piddington, Mrs. Verrall, etc., as\nof persons most likely to figure after their death as \" controls.\"\nWhether we regard \" communications \" from the spiritistic point\nof view or explain them by the theory of dramatic impersonations\nof the medium's secondary personality, there is in any case a\nstrong presumption of certain people eventually playing a part in\ncommunications.\nAltogether the scope of the experiments is considerably wider\nthan their application to the present state of the Society's work\nonly. They would involve experimentation on a large number of\nside-issues (as the above-mentioned differences between supra-\nand sub-liminal imagery, hypnotic imagery, trance-imagery, inter-\nference by a second person, as a medium or a mere receiver of\ntransmitted thoughts) and\u2014if the value of imagery as a criterion\ncould be shown,\u2014the organised registration of living beings,\naccording to their mental characteristics, for possible reference\nafter their death.\nIt seems to me that, even if leading to no positive results,\nthis line of experimenting might conceivably throw a little\nlight upon the so far quite unknown conditions of mediumship,\nand might possibly\u2014as experiments so often do\u2014direct atten-\ntion to other ideas infinitely more valuable than the initial\nsuggestion.\nVF^ CONGEES INTEPtNATIONAL DE PSYCHOLOGIE.\nGeneve 3-7 aout 1909.\nCirculaire No. 2 (Fevrier 1909).\nLe VI\"\"\" Congres international de Psychologie s'ouvrira a Geneve le\nmardi matin 3 aout et durera jusqu'au samedi 7 aout inclusivement\n(le lundi soir 2 aout il y aura deja une reunion familiere des\nCongressistes presents a Geneve).\nVoici le programme des travaux du prochain Congres tel qu'il\nse presents a cette heure.\n\f90 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. may, 1909.\nI-\nThemes de Discussion.\nUn certain nombre de questions \u2014 dont plusieurs nous ont ete\nsugger^es du dehors \u2014 ont ete raises a Tordre du jour de nos dis-\ncussions. Les Rapporteurs qui ont bien voulu se charger de les\nintroduire devant le Congres ont ^te pries de nous envoyer leurs\nrapports le phis vite possible, afin que nous puissions les faire im-\nprimer et les expedier a toutes les personnes inscrites comme membres\ndu Congres. Elles pourront ainsi les lire a loisir et preparer leurs\nremarques et objections en connaissance de cause.

C'est pourquoi nous inscrivons les quelques articles suivants\nau programme de notre reunion de cet ete :\n1. Terminologie. \u2014 Comme introduction a ce sujet et pour engager\nnos coUegues de tons pays a nous apporter leurs idees et leurs\nsuggestions utiles en ce domaine un pen aride a premiere vue, nous\npublierons et leur enverrons au cours de ce printemps un premier\nessai ou avant-projet de convention, portant sur un certain nombre\nde notions indispensables et d'un emploi constant dans les recherches\nde psychologie experimentale.\n2. Etalonnage des Couleurs (Standard-Colours). \u2014 II serait fort de-\nsirable que les divers experimentateurs qui ont a se servir de couleurs\ndans leurs investigations puissent les designer d'une facon a la fois\nprecise, simple et commode, en se referant a une echelle numerotee\nsuivant les nuances et les degres de saturation, et universellement\nadmise comme etalon. Xous invitons ceux de nos collegues qui sont\ncompetents dans cette branche, ainsi que les fabricants d'appareils\nd'optique ou de papiers de couleur, a nous apporter leurs propositions,\net, eventuellement, des echantillons.\nNous esperons que cette question si importante sera introduite au\nCongres par j\\I. le prof. W. Nagel (Rostock).\n3. Mode de numeration des fautes dans les exp6nences de tdmoignage. \u2014\nM. Otto Lipmann, Dr. phil. (Berlin) rapportera.\n4. Notation de Vage des enfanis.\u2014Certains auteurs ont I'habitude\n\f92 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1909.\nd'indiquer en jours ou en semaines I'age des enfants. Cette notation\nest mal commode : on ne voit pas tout de suite quel est I'age qui\ncorrespond au 164\"' jour ou a la 89\"\"' semaine. Nous proposerons au\nCongres d'adopter le mode de notation recemment employe par Stern.\n5. Ddterniination mathdmatique des rcsuUats numiriques des exph'iences.\n\u2014 Lorsqu'il s'agit de prendre la moyenne d'un grand nombre de\nresultats, ou de chercher la correlation de caracteres psychiques ou\nautres, de difficiles problemes se posent a I'investigateur. Ces pro-\nblemes, cependant, sont de nature trop delicate et speciale pour que\nnous ayons demande a des rapporteurs de les introduire devant le\nCongres avant de savoir si certains de nos coUegues desirent qu'ils\nfigurent a I'ordre du jour. Si c'est le eas, nous sommes prets a\norganiser une seance speciale qui reunirait les personnes s'interessant\na ces questions de matbematique appliquee.\nLes membres du Congres qui desireraient que d'autres objets\nd'unification fussent portes a I'ordre du jour sont pries de bien\nvouloir nous en aviser au plus tot.\nIII.\nExposition d'Instruments, Etc.\nToutes les personnes (psychologues, fabricants, etc.) qui auraient\nI'intention d'exposer pendant le Congres des instruments, appareils,\nlivres ou brochures, collections et objets divers concernant les\nrecherches et I'enseignement de la psychologic, ou de faire des de-\nmonstrations experimentales, sont priees de nous en donner avis le\nplus vite possible, avec toutes les indications necessaires pour que\nnous puissions leur reserver I'emplacement qu'elles desirent.\nIV.\nCommunications Individuelles.\nAinsi que nous I'avons indique dans notre premiere circulaire, un\nde nos vifs desirs \u2014 en tachant de concentrer les efforts des congres\nsistes sur les themes de discussion indiques plus haut \u2014 serait de\nreagir centre cette plethore de communications individuelles dispa-\nrates dont les derniers Congres ont tant eu a soulfrir. Cependant,\nnous ne nous sentons pas le droit de fermer d'emblee et absolument\nla porte aux travaux inedits et particulierement interessants que des\nmembres croiraient devoir presenter au Congres. C'est pourquoi\nnous conservons cette rubrique des Communications individuelles, en\npriant leurs auteurs eventuels de bien vouloir nous les annoncer le\nplus vite possible (au plus tard avant le 15 juin).

Barrett, F.R.S.\nLondon : Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd. 1909. Pp.\niv-i-227. 3s. 6d. net.\nProfessor Barrett has raised a memorial tribute to his friend Mr.\nMassey, who was, like himself, one of the founders of the Society\nfor Psychical Research, but who, in very early days, retired from\nit because he was out of sympathy with its demand for scientific\ntests for what could be seen, or weighed, or measured, or\nrecounted in safe human testimony. His method of acquiring\n\fMat, 1909. Review. 95\nknowledge was an inward method, and he applied a life of large\nleisure, unfettered by domestic or professional cares, to thinking\nand writing on ultimate things.\nHe lived in chambers in Victoria Street, Westminster, was much\nin the Athenaeum Club, and died in 1905 at the age of sixty-seven.\nHe was, by universal testimony, an attractive personality, an\nearnest and fearless thinker, ever engaged in the pursuit of\nabstract truth. Indeed, his friend Laurence Oliphant wrote to him\nthat it would do him good to drop his restless questioning for a\nwhile, and live an outdoor life of physical exercise, inasmuch as\nhe was like a man whose head was in a hot box and his body\nsuffering from cold. At one time he thought of joining Laurence\nOliphant at Haifa in Syria. At another he approached the\nCatholic Church, but could not join that either; so he remained\never a hovering inquirer, not easily labelled, except as a spiritualist\nwho did not value material manifestations, and a theosophist who\ndid not value Mahatmas.\nWe must also admit that he is an author whom it is very\ndifficult to read. He had not the gift of style, and we have\nvalued the occasional elucidation added by the editor. He coined\na number of new words, which a reader has to learn, such as\n\"mediated,\" which means brought into effective action through\nsome such intervening medium as a Bible story, or a popular\nreligion :\n\" factural,\" which is applied to a truth not in its aspect\nas a general truth, but as partially revealed and partially obscured\nby some outward fact such as the Eesurrection.\nThe central idea in his mysticism\u2014if I may dare to attempt a\ndescription of what is so difficult to grasp\u2014is that historical\nstatements are often crude, unreliable, and likely to be rejected\nthey are the clothing of a truth behind them. Our author does\nnot give us many illustrations of his meaning, but an instance of\nthis would be that whilst the story of the Fall of Man is not\nhistorical, it represents the truth that the absorption of our spirits\nin the garment of flesh brings them into sin. To reach some such\ngeneralised truth is, then, the second stage of what is called\n\"cognition\" or \"integration.\" The final stage is to rehabilitate the\noriginal fact in some way which is to be accepted, because it is\nfound to be the vehicle of general principles\u2014even eternal truth.\nIt will be seen that this sometimes leaves it difficult for a\nreader to know whether the author does, or does not, accept the\nordinary historical facts with which he begins. One feels that\n\f96 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1909.\nmysticism of this type ought to be expressed, in order to be clear,\nnot in the rather brief concentrated style of a conversational\nletter, but in carefully worded and expanded paragraphs.\nThe following passages will give some idea of the author's manner\nof treatment.\n\"Therefore, too, to speak of our nature\u2014the nature of our\npresent consciousness\u2014as entitled to respect from 'interference,'\nis for me a radical nonconception of the religious problem.\nCertainly I do not believe in the Gospel narrative [of the Virgin\nBirth] as let alone in its crude immediacy as historic fact, but I\nconceive in its '\ntruth,' as having a process of intelligence, which\nmust go through the negative '\nmoment ' of denial of fact, but with\nthe consummate result of a resurrection of the fact as dependent\nand consequent on the ideal or eternal truth which is in the\nhistory, and which eventually restores the very history which it\nbreaks in its own evolution. \". . . .\n\" It seems to me that if we deny the Virgin birth so explicitly\nstated in two of the Gospels, we may as well '\nbe hanged for a\nsheep as a lamb,' and deny the whole historic basis of Christi-\nanity \u2014all that realises its idea for us. Doubtless, the true\nrealisation, the true '\nwitness,' must be in our own experience\u2014and\nI still often doubt. But as often do I recur to my belief in the\n'\nresurrection '\nof the '\nfact,' transfigured, surely, eternalised, '\nraised\n'\nto 'truth.'\"\nIt would be impossible to judge a difficult book of this kind by\nisolated paragraphs ; the reader has to get into its swing and\nacquire such a new vocabulary as indeed is to some extent inevit-\nable in mystical researches.\nJ.

CORIAT, M.D. (London : Kegan Paul,\nTrench, Triibner & Co. 1908. Pp. x, 427. Price 6s. net.)\nIn the introduction to this book we are told that its object is to\ndescribe in plain terms the principles underlying the new medico-\nreligious effort which goes hy the name of the \"Emmanuel movement\"\n(from the name of the church in Boston where it originated), and the\nmethods by which these principles are applied. This movement is the\noutcome of a conviction on the part of its founders that the Church has\nan important mission to discharge to the sick, and that the physician\nand the clergyman can work together to the benefit of the community.\nBeing conversant with the striking results that have been obtained in\nthe treatment of functional nervous disorders by modern psycho-thera-\npeutic methods, and recognizing that many of these disorders are\nassociated with disturbances of the moral life, they formed the opinion\nthat therapeutic suggestions cond^ined with spiritual guidance and\nprayer would effect for sufferers of this kind more than could be\neffected in any other way. But although they thought that the clergy\nare by character and training specially qualified to practise treatment\nby suggestion, thej^ realized that they might do harm rather than good\nif they undertook to treat unsuitable cases. They therefore made it a\n\fJune, 1909. Revieiv. 101\nrule not to treat any case until a diagnosis of functional nervous\ndisease had been made hy a competent physician.\nThe method of treatment employed is that method of modern psycho-\ntherapy which is known as treatment by suggestion, with or without\nhypnosis, and the principles which are said to underlie this form of\ntreatment are familiar to neurologists who have studied this branch of\ntherapeutics, although by no means accepted by all of them. There is,\nindeed, even in this book, a fundamental difference of opinion between\ntwo of the writers in regard to the psychological status of what they\nboth refer to as the \" subconscious.\" Dr. Worcester believes that there\nis in each of us a subconscious mind which is a normal part of our\nspiritual nature, which has more direct control of the physical processes\nand is, under certain conditions, more amenable to external control\nthan our ordinary consciousness. Dr. Coriat takes a totally different\nview of the nature of the subconscious. He regards the subconscious\nas being always due to a dissociation of consciousness ; and to a sub-\nconsciousness so originating no peculiar powers can be ascribed. This\nopinion regarding the nature of the subconscious is held by the majority\nof American neurologists, and although its supporters maintain that the\nmanifestation of subconscious phenomena is not necessaril}' an indica-\ntion of abnormality, it differs very little from the opinion of Professor\nJanet, who regards every manifestation of subconsciousness as proof of\npathological dissociation. Its weakness as a hypothesis lies in the\ndifficulty of applying it to the description or explanation of all the\nobserved phenomena.\nDr. Coriat's contribution to this book is restricted to a purely\nscientific discussion of the main problems of abnormal psychology in\ntheir relation to therapeutics, and he gives no indication that he is\nparticularly in sympathj- with the views of his clerical collaborators in\nregard to the matters which form the distinctive character of the\nwork. In what follows, reference to the writers of the book applies to\nDr. Worcester and Dr. M'Comb.\nThe foundation of the belief that the clergy may successfully under-\ntake the treatment of certain diseases is to be sought in the records of\nthe results which have been obtained by the use of suggestion as a\ntherapeutic agent in medical practice; and there is just a suspicion of\narrogance in the attitude of the writers with regard to treatment by\nsuggestion as used by themselves. They seeiQ inclined to forget that\nwhat they know about it they have learned mainly from the medical\nprofession. They say that sufferers from functional neuroses are the\ndespair of the ordinary practitioner and \" will continue to be such until\n\f102 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1 909\nthe phj'sician enlarges the sphere of his culture and qualifies himself to\ntreat the whole man.\" Phj'sicians may apprehend that moral maladies\nrequire moral treatment, but \" on account of their ignorance of psycho-\nlogical methods few physicians feel themselves competent to undertake\nsuch treatment.\" Now it may be doubted if the ordinary clergyman\nhas any greater knowledge of psychological methods than the ordinary\nphysician, and the sphere of a clergyman's culture makes him no more\nqualified than the ordinary practitioner to treat \"the whole man.\"\nAlthough it may be true that the time is coming \" when a knowledge\nof physiological jjsychology will be considered as necessary to the art of\nhealing as a knowledge of anatomy,\" we have no assurance that in the\nmeantime the clergy as a whole have any such knowledge as would\nentitle them to exploit this particular branch of the healing art, or such\nqualifications as would justify them in attempting in this matter to\nforestall the ordinary practitioner, who finds it increasingly difiicult to\nkeep abreast of scientific progress in every department of medicine.\nIf the claim of the Church to cure disease be based on the scientific\nattainments of her ministers, there is little to be said in favour of the\ncontention. But the plea really put forward is something quite different\nfrom this ; and instead of regarding this book as giving merely a\ndescription of the principles and methods of the Emmanuel movement,\nwe must regard it as an appeal to the Christian Church throughout the\nworld to return to the faith and the practice of its early days, and in\nthe fulfilment of its mission to the sick to \" outdo the wonders of the\napostolic and the post-apostolic age.\"\nIt is maintained that the healing of the sick was an essential part of\nChrist's ministry, enjoined on his disciples and practised by the early\nChurch, and that in so far as the Church of to-day has lost faith in its\nhealing powers and takes no care for the temporal well-being of its\nmembers, it is failing in its purpose. The thought that lies at the\ncentre of the Emmanuel movement is that only by a return to a literal\nfulfilment of Christ's commands in respect to the curing of disease will\nthe Church be able to maintain her position in the modern world.\nIt is the alliance of religion with the practice of theraiseutic sugges\ntion that mainly distinguishes this book from ordinary works on\npsycho-therapeutics. Besides attaching a religious importance to the\nmental states in which suggestion is most effective and believing that\nin these states \" the Spirit of God enters into us and a power not our\nown takes possession of us,\" the writers also believe in the therapeutic\nvalue of prayer. \"The prayer of faith uttered or unexpressed has an\nimmense influence over the functions of organic life.\" And this influ-\n\fJCNE, 1909. Review. 103\nence is not merely a result of suggestion, not merely \"a beneficial reflex\neffect upon the mind of him who prays \" or of him who knows that he\nis being prayed for. An element of suggestion is tacitly admitted by\nthe writers, but they believe that there is something more. They say,\n\" If we grasp the thought that we are organically related to God, that\nwe exist in Him spiritually somewhat as thoughts exist in the mind,\nwe can see that a strong desire in our soul communicates itself to Him\nand engages His attention just as a thought in our soul engages ours.\"\nSuch a prayer \" rises in the mind of God, and if it is good becomes one\nof His determining motives.\"\nAnother reason for combining religion with the practice of thera-\npeutic suggestion is to be found in the view which the writers hold as\nto the importance of the kind of faith which has power in effecting\ncurative results. Faith in the physician or in his treatment may be\nenough for the cure of an illness, but it is a poor substitute throughout\nlife for faith in a living God. A suggestion that a tuning fork is a\npowerful magnet which relieves pain and cures many diseases may work\nwell in some cases, but Dr. Worcester says he would \"expect no moral\nregeneration, no newer and higher life, to proceed from such a source.\"\nHere we see plainly that the aims of the writers are essentially\ndifferent from those of the physician. It has been supposed that the\nEmmanuel movement was instituted for the purpose of treating certain\ndiseases, but the object of its founders was manifestly something quite\ndifferent. They claim that their work is essentially ethical and spiritual,\nand admit that their chief interest in the men and women who seek\ntheir care is a moral and religious interest. To the phj'sician the relief\nof sickness is an end ; to the Emmanuelist it is a means of prosely-\ntising.\nThe writers believe that we are living to-day in the midst of a great\nreligious movement in which the Church has no part. \"Everywhere\nmen and women are feeling and apprehending, however dimly, that the\nreligion taught and practised by the churches is not the whole religion\nof Christ ; hence we see on one side a wholesale defection to strange\ncults and institutions which, with all their aberrations, hold up the\npromise of immediate help to the whole man, and on the other hand we\nobserve a growing apathy and indiflference toward the Church.\" In\nthe realisation of the declining prestige of the Church and in the belief\nthat by attending more to man's temporal needs she may hold her own\nagainst aberrant forms of faith, we find the mainsprings of the action\ntaken by the leaders of the Emmanuel movement. Not the cure of\ndisease or the relief of suffering is their object, but the saving of souls.\n\f104 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1909.\nThe Christian religion, they saj;^, \"despises no undertaking, no matter\nhow humble, that is intended to benefit man, but its quarry is the soul,\nit concerns itself only with great things.\" The Christian religion is\nbeing defrauded of its legitimate quarr}' because strange cults have\narisen which, instead of \" preaching that is vague and impractical and\nwhich deals largely with a distant future \" give \"the promise of an\nimmense immediate good as the result of faith.\" If, then, the Church\nwould resume her old sway over the hearts of men, let her return to her\nearly traditions, let her regain the heroism of faith, let her once more\nbe able to say in the words of her Founder, \"Behold I cast out devils\nand I do cures.\"\nThis desire of devout men once more to make the Practical Motive\nthe most important motive of religious belief is profoundly interesting.\nMen, they say, will believe only what is good and useful to believe.\nYes, but men must believe what is good and useful to believe on the\nwhole and in the long run. Two great types of religious belief have\narisen in the course of man's moral development, and the transition\nfrom the lower to the higher type has always been characterised by the\nprojection of the goal of religious thought out of the present into a more\nand more remote future. The more highly developed man's religious\nconsciousness becomes, the more does he realise his relation to the\nuniversal and the infinite, and the more insignificant does every\nmaterial interest of the present appear. To make temporal welfare or\nwell-being a motive for religious belief is to revert to a type of faith\nwhich all the higher religions of the world have already outgrovv^n.\nReligious systems based on the promise of material benefits here and now\nmust die out because they are no longer adapted to the furtherance of\nman's destiny, and the introduction of such promises as a motive for\nbelief into the highest form of religion the world has ever known can\nonly tend to lower the ideals of believers and pervert their outlook on\nthe universe.\nT.

The first article in this number is a further record by Mrs.\nLambert of experiments in automatic writing, etc., made by her and\nher husband's clerk, Mr. Hannegan, and various other people. Mr.\nHannegan is said to have suddenly discovered in March, 1908,\nthat he had great mediumistic cajjacity, and a report of some\nof his earlier sittings with Mr. and Mrs. Lambert and their\n\fJune, 1909. Notes on Current Periodicals. 105\nfriends during May and June, 1908, was published in the previous\nnumber of the Proceedings.\nThe phenomena seem to be of the usual spiritualistic type ;\nand\na very complete and minute dramatisation of the controls is shown\nnot only in the automatic writing, but also in the daily lives of\nthe mediums.\nShorthand notes were made of the sittings, but there are no\nsigned statements of witnesses published in corroboration of any of\nthe incidents in the report. Besides the automatic writing, a good\nmany \"physical phenomena\" are reported, occurring either in the dark\nor when the medium and Mrs. Lambert alone were present. Thus, a\nmessage was asked for from the dead wife of a friend and, after the\nlights were lowered, two white roses were laid on the table for this\nfriend. Mr. Hannegan undertook the position of tutor to Mrs.\nLambert's boy of ten, and on one occasion when they were alone\non the beach together Mr. Hannegan cut his hand. The boy\napparently did not see the blood, but did see a visionary golden\nhand clasping Mr. Hannegan's. There are instances of both Mr.\nHannegan and Mrs. Lambert going into trance and mentally\nvisiting foreign countries and places and seeing on several occasions\nthe same scenes and people. After one of these incidents, in Avhich\nMr. Hannegan supposed himself to go daily to nurse a wounded\nboy, Mrs. Lambert found him in bed in trance with his hands\ncovered with blood. She saw an apparition in the room at the\ntime, which she at first thought was Mr. Hannegan himself,,\nbut judged from his groans that he was really in bed. In the\nautomatic writing on one occasion reference is made to a particular\ndesk in Mr. Lambert's office which was subsequently found broken\nopen. The other phenomena resemble these instances and several\n\" incidents too personal to quote \" are mentioned.\nIn a lengthy introduction Professor Hyslop points out that the\nexplanation must lie either in fraud, collective hallucination, or in\nan unusual type of physical phenomena. He puts aside the\npossibility of fraud and suggests that the \"physical phenomena\"\nmay be due to sensory and motor automatisms combined with amnesia,\nand that Mrs. Lambert in particular may often go into and recover\nfrom a state of trance without knowing it (which from the account\ncertainly might be the case) and herself produce the phenomena\nautomatically.\nThe second article, \"A Record of Dreams, etc.,\" by Marie Shipley,\ngives in detail some fifty-five psychic experiences of Mrs. Shipley,.\n\f106 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1909.\nthe wife of a bank manager of Columbus, Ohio, most of which\noccurred between July, 1907, and September, 1908. Until July,\n1907, when she wrote to Professor Hyslop about her experiences,\nshe had kept no record of them ; after this date she kept a diary,\nbut even then no records of her experiences were signed or\ncorroborated until some time after they occurred, and, in most cases,\nnot until after the fulfilment or coincidence had become known to\nher and those about her.\nSome of the earlier experiences occurring four or five years before\nher record was kept or corroboration obtained seem, as reported,\nto be very remarkable, and it is noticeable how much more com-\nplete and perfect they appear than those which occurred later and\nare more carefully observed and recorded. '\nThe phenomena consist mainly of \" premonitory \" dreams, but\nthere are coincidental dreams and impressions, apparitions of dead\nand living persons, supposed communications from the dead, etc.\nOf these, premonitory dreams, more or less accurately fulfilled,\nconstitute nearly half the total number. They take the form of\n\" dreams \" in which Mrs. Shipley sees her friends in varying circum-\nstances, sometimes very trivial, but usually serious, as when they\nappear to her ill or dying. A curious incident, better corroborated\nthan most, is . one in which Airs. Shipley, writing to a friend at\na great distance, of whom she had not heard for some months,\nmentions that she saw him in a dream, \" very plainly yesterday\nin a room with a lot of playthings on the floor\u2014children's clothes\nand toys.\" This friend, Mr. Lewis, is a professor of art and\ndrawing, but on the day on which he received this letter from\nMrs. Shipley (two days after it was written), he had been giving a\ndemonstration before a kindergarten to oblige the teacher, and had\nbeen making a bird-cage surrounded by the children on the floor.\nAnother case is one in which she dreamt of a friend's child in\ngreat danger of falling from an open window ; about three weeks\nlater the child's mother found her sitting on a roof outside the\nsecond-floor window of a shop and was just in time to prevent an\naccident. In another case she dreams of the death of a friend to\nwhom in reality an accident occurred.\nOne interesting case is the apparition of a dead friend, an old\nnurse, who warns her against kidney disease, which she had no\nreason to fear at the time. About nine months later she developed\ndiabetes. This incident is well authenticated, as the account of the\ndream was sent to Professor Hyslop as soon as it occurred.\n\fJune, 1909.

This mass of material\nis not classified in any way and even the writer's analysis and\nconclusions are interspersed at random in the record, together with\ncopious extracts from the writings of Myers, Maxwell, and others,\nso that it is not easy to estimate the value of the material.\nThe writer is evidently possessed of some \" mediumistic \" faculty ;\nhis experiences are chiefly raps, metallic and other sounds, \"touchings,\"\n\u2022etc., in the room near liim, both when alone or with other people.\nMr. T. is accustomed to regard the raps as a signal to begin auto-\nmatic writing, which he can usually only obtain after such a signal.\nHis writings purport to come from dead friends and relations and\nappear to be in general quite unevidential, while in nearly all the\ninstances where they purport to be evidential they are incorrect.\nMr. T. in fact is himself disposed to regard them as the productions\nof his own subconscious mind. But he is convinced of the objective\nnature of the sounds, raps, etc., which he heard both in his own\nhouse and in his mother's, and which were apparently heard as\nmuch by his mother and relations in his absence as by himself.\nOn several occasions he noticed that the raps seemed to coincide\nwith a heart beat, though at irregular intervals, and after careful\nattention decided that they practically always did so : on this he\nspeculates at great length. He is convinced that the raps, etc., are\nnot hallucinatory, but that they are produced by his subliminal\nconsciousness \"as a sort of motor automatism.\"\nJ. R.\nThe Psychological Review (Baltimore, U.S.A.) for January, 1909, con-\ntains an account by Elmer E. Jones, Ph.D., of the gradual disintegration\nof consciousness under chloroform, founded on three observations upon\nhimself. Amongst the noteworthy points are the illusions of the\nkintesthetic sense. At an early stage of the experiment it was\nnoticed that muscular movements appeared to be of much greater\nextent than they actually were, and to occupy a much longer\ntime. Mr. Dunbar's observations on his own experience under\nhashish were to a similar effect. The phenomenon may have some\nbearing upon the slowness of movement commonly reported in\nPoltergeist cases. Of course, in those cases the motions observed\nare not in the subject's own organism ; but it should be remembered\n\f108 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1909.\nthat our chief standard for estimating the rate of motion in external\nobjects is to be found in the movements of our own eye-muscles.\nDr. Jones found that the senses disappeared in the following order\nhearing, the tactile sense (followed by the loss of muscular control),\nvision : consciousness, memory, and the reasoning faculties remained\nfor some time, but slightly impaired, after the abolition of all sensation.\nThe following passage is of interest :\n\" With the disappearance of\nthe tactile sense and hearing, the body has completely lost its\norientation. It appears to be nowhere, simply floating in space. It\nis a most ecstatic feeling. Consciousness is now almost pure ideas\nit is free from any disturbing stimuli from the sense organs, and is\nprobably just what is meant traditionally by a free spirit.\"\nIn the Archives de Psychologie for October and December, 1908,\nMr. Ernest Naville gives an account of numerous visual hallu-\ncinations of which he has been the subject. He is now in his ninety-\nsecond year ; in good health ; his eyes are free from organic defect\nand serve quite well for the ordinary affairs of life, though he finds\nmuch difliculty in reading or writing.\nHis hallucinations, of which he first became aware some time in\nthe course of last summer, are exclusively visual ;\nthey represent\ngenerally small crowds or processions of human beings, or flocks of\nanimals, mostly sheep. The figures are perfectly normal in character\nand movement ;\nindeed, at first he could only recognise them for\nhallucinations because others could not see them. They are seen\nsometimes as if through the window ; sometimes when the\npercipient is himself out of doors. They disappear when the eyes\nare closed (he does not say whether they reappear when the\neyes are reopened), but fixing the gaze upon them has no effect\u2014\nthey usually disappear in a natural manner, by moving out of\nsight. On two or three occasions Mr. Naville has attempted to\napproach them, but on each occasion they vanished when he came\nwithin a certain distance. In one case the hallucination had its\norigin in an illusion\u2014some white stones were transformed into a\nflock of sheep, which afterwards multiplied and moved about. In\nanother case, when, after passing through a muddy place, he saw\nsome mud on his shoes, though none was really there, the hallu-\ncination was apparently due to an immediate provocation from the\nsurroundings. In most cases, however, Mr. Naville thinks that the\nvisions are due to memory, with very little admixture of imagin-\nation. A tall building which he has seen on several occasions was\napparently a reminiscence of a similar building seen in Geneva.\n\fJune, 1909. Notes on Current Periodicals. 109\nIn one case he thinks he has traced the haUucination\u2014a vision of\na crowd of women in large white coifs (cornettes) \u2014to an incident\nwhich occurred sixty-two years ago.\nIn one case oidy have the haUucinations been of a disagreeable\ncharacter : they generallj' interest and amuse him. Mr. Naville notes\ntwo points which may throw some light on their origin. (1) That\nwhite is the dominant colour : almost all the figures, whether men\nor women, have white head coverings. (2) The phantom processions\nare generally accompanied by a white smoke : sometimes the smoke\ncomes out in puffs from the procession, sometimes it lies above it\nin a horizontal layer. Sometimes the appearance of a procession\nis heralded by the appearance of a white smoke. This white smoke\nmay possibly be homologous with the cloud occasionally seen as a\npreliminary to crystal vision. Mr. Naville's grandson saw in the\nsmoke a possible reminiscence of a torchlight procession at the\nf^te of Zofingue, which would be a familiar sight to Mr. Naville in\nGeneva.\nF. P.\nIn the Revue de VHypnotiRme, March, 1909, Dr. Berillon writes on\nthe Psychology of Olfaction and emphasises the importance of the\npart taken by the olfactory sense in the constitution of personality.\nIn another short paper he explains the diagnostic value of what he\nhas named the \" signe de la detente muscidaire.\" He says that ability to\nrelax immediately all voluntary muscles is a valuable indication of a\nhealthy neuro-muscular state. Any slowness in passing from the\ncontracted to the relaxed state, or the need of any voluntary effort\nin order to obtain muscular relaxation, points to some perturbation\nof the cerebral functions.\nDr. Demonchy writes on the importance of the \"awakening\" in\nHypnotism. He thinks that sufficient attention has not been paid\nto this in the past, and declares that just as the sleep of a hypnotised\nperson may be more or less profound, so the awakening may be\nmore or less complete. He says that he does not regard all the\npatients that come to him for hypnotic treatment as persons who\nare awake and have to be put to sleep in order to cure them,\n\"but often rather as persons more or less asleep Avhom it is necessary\nto awake completely. Hypnotism is only a method which facilitates\nthe thorough awakening of the patient. There seems to be nothing\nvery new in this way of looking at the therapeutic side of hypnotism.\n\f110 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, im.\nIt is onlj' another wa}' of stating the modern view that in hypnosis\na synthesis of dissociated mental states can be effected.\nThere are several articles dealing with therapeutics of hypnotic\nsuggestion and a short notice of Dr. Pierre Janet's Les Nevroses appears.\nIn the Bevue de VHypnotisme, April, 1909, Dr. Paul Farez records\na case of hysteria in which a secondary personality developed.\nIn the Journal of Ahnornal Psychology, April-May, 1909, there is\nan article by C. H. Johnston on The role of Sensations and Feelings\nimder Ether. The author is of opinion that the intense mentality\nof partial anaesthesis may be the active work of feelings, undisturbed\nby sensory factors ; and he is inclined to justify the position of those\npsychologists, at present in the minority, who claim that there is no\ninseparable connection of sensation with feeling-tone.\nDr. Morton Prince concludes his monograph on The Unconscious.\nHe discusses the influence of dormant mental complexes on the\npersonal consciousness when these complexes have never formed a\npart of the experience of the personal self, as is the case with\ncomplexes originating in hypnosis or other dissociated states. Such\ncomplexes may affect the personal consciousness through the for-\nmation of co-conscious ideas, or through the persistence of the emotions\ncreated in hypnosis. He thinks, however, that the chief mechanism\nis through the stimulation of dormant complexes by associated ideas\nfrom the environment which act as points de repere.\nIn The American Journal of Psychology, April, 1909, Charles W.\nWaddle writes on Miracles of Healing. A useful bibliography, com-\nprising ninety-one publications bearing on the subject, is given. The\nauthor traces the history of miraculous cures in all ages and amongst\nall peoples, and shows that miracle workers, being unable to explain\ntheir own results, have invariably attached to them a religious\nsignificance and have attributed them to such supernatural agencies\nas they believed to exist. The advance of scientific psychology and\nscientific psychotherapy in recent years has done much to rationalise\nour views by demonstrating the possibility of explaining supposedly\nsupernatural happenings on the basis of laws of physical and mental\nactivity. While ascribing cures of a miraculous nature to the operation\nof the law of suggestion, the writer is impressed with the necessity\nof further careful and accurate study of the operation of this law.\n\" We need,\" he says, \" far more data upon the conditions favouring\nand hindering the operation of the law. We have had much\ntheorising but as yet too little scientific study and experimentation\nin this promising field.\"\nT W M\ni\n\fJune, 1909. Correspondence. Ill\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nIdentifying Characteristics of Living People.\n{To the Editor of the S.P.R. Journal.)\nMay oth, 1909.\nI am interested in the suggestion made in the Maj' Journal,.\np. 84, by Mr. Edward Bullough, that experiments should be tried\non the kinds of answers obtainable from living people, to questions\nof a type similar to those which have recently been addressed to\ncertain \"controls,\" especially to the trance controls of Mrs. Piper.\nI think it would be quite instructive if a few carefully drawn-up\nquestions \u2014asking, for instance, what a certain quotation or a certain\nsubject suggested\u2014were sent round to a few people such as those\nthat he mentions on p. 89, to see what they would say.\nI even think that in a few cases the test might be carried\nfurther, and we might be asked whether we should send a ditferent\nsort of reply if we had to dictate say to \"Rector,\" or to the\n\" Nelly \" control, or to a presumed stranger like Mrs. Holland.\nBut perhaps it is hardly likely that the same question would do\nfor every one. For instance, the \" autos ouranos\" test, so ingeniously\ndevised by Mrs. Verrall, and so successful in extracting information\nfrom a Myers control, would have conveyed to me no literary\nreferences whatever. I should not have known its source, and I\nshould have had no associations with it. All I could have said was\nthat it seemed to mean something about \" heaven itself.\" And so\nit might readily be, in my case, with other literary references out of\nthe beaten track.\nIt may be necessary, therefore, for some one to take special trouble\nto select or concoct a sentence which he or she may think appropriate\nfor arousing definite associations in the mind of a specified living\nperson, and then to submit the question to that person. It does not\nat all follow that the question selected would be really appropriate\nbut a test of the questioner, as well as of the questioned, is part of\nthe experiment.\nWhile I am writing, I may add a general remark.\nIt has long struck me, as it has no doubt also struck others, how\nvery difficult a matter it is to prove identit}'', especially when general\ntelepathy has to be allowed for. For instance, I have often discussed\nin a half jocular manner with Lad\\' Lodge how I should convince\nher of my identity, in a posthumous communication ; and I have\nwarned her that if I forget a number of incidents which she thinks\nI ought to remember, such ignorance will not in the least prove a\nnegative, since I forget them in a wholesale manner now.\nSmall and intimate details\u2014family jokes and the like\u2014might be\nrecollected, but they would have to be discounted on the score of\ntelepathy from herself; and no very crucial method of proof has yet\noccurred to me. Progress, however, is so rapidly being made in the\n\f112 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

DICKINSON'S \"IS IMMOETALITY DESIRABLE ?\" ^\nThe most recent of the \" Ingersoll Lectures on the Immortality\nof Man,\" delivered annually at Harvard University, has just\nbeen published, and it is interesting to note that this is the\nfirst time that a member of our Council has been invited to\ndeliver it. The subject is treated with the clear thought, the\nwide sympathy for different attitudes of mind, the concise\nfelicity and eloquent restraint of style that we are\naccustomed to look for in Mr. Dickinson's writings, and we\ncordially recommend the book to all our readers. We have\nonly space here to quote a few passages bearing special\nreference to the work of the S.P.E.\n\" I must repeat . . . that it is mere dogmatism to assert\nthat we do not survive death, and mere prejudice or inertia\nto assert that it is impossible to discover whether we do or\nno.

July, 1909.\nTwo new Members and four new Associates were elected.\nTheir names and addresses are given above.\nThe monthly account for May, 1909, was presented and\ntaken as read.\nGENERAL MEETING.\nThe 134th General Meeting of the Society was held in the\nQueen's Hall (Small), Langham Place, London, W., on Friday,\nJune 18th, 1909, at 3.30 p.m.; Sir Oliver Lodge in the chair.\nSir Olivek Lodge observed that during the last few years\nthe Society had been devoting its energies chiefly to the inves-\ntigation of purely psychical phenomena,\u2014automatic writing,\ntrance speaking and the like,\u2014and the results had been to\nhis mind of the utmost importance, since they had brought\nus nearer to a scientific proof of human survival after bodily\ndeath than any evidence hitherto obtained. The phenomena\nto be discussed that day were of what might be called a lower\nkind,\u2014having no bearing, as far as he could see, on the pro-\nblem of human survival. They were physical phenomena,\nconsisting chiefly in the movements of objects apparently\nwithout contact, or with such contact as could not normally\naccount for the movement ; and there seemed no reason to\nattribute them to anything beyond an apparently supernormal\nfaculty in the medium.\nHe himself had had four exceptionally good sittings with\nthe same medium, Eusapia Palladino, in 1894, at one of the\nhouses of Professor Kichet, under very favourable conditions,\nand subject to his own control. He had thus become con-\nvinced of the genuineness of some of the phenomena produced\nby her, as stated in his report of these sittings, printed in the\nJournal for November, 1894. Subsequently, as most of those\npresent were probably aware, Eusapia had been detected in\ntrickery at a series of .sittings held at Cambridge in 1895.\nWhile fully admitting the fraudulent nature of one of the\nCambridge sittings which he attended, Sir Oliver Lodge felt\nquite sure that the main tricks experienced there,\u2014namely, the\nsubstitution of hands or feet held by two sitters, so that one\nhand or foot was made to do duty for two, while the other\nwas freed and used to perform movements,\u2014could not account\nfor the phenomena lie had previously witnessed ;\nsince in several\n\fJuly, 1909. General Meeting. 115\ncases he had himself held both hands of the medium and also\ncontrolled her legs while some of the phenomena were occurring.\nHe had at that time recognised the importance of complete\nholding by a single person, and had insisted on this condition\nbefore being finally satisfied. He had therefore always retained\nhis conviction of the genuineness of some of her phenomena\nthough he felt doubtful if any evidence that could be adduced\nin her case would now be regarded as of any weight by the\npublic. For himself the bare fact of the occurrence of unusual\nphysical phenomena in the presence of exceptionally constituted\npeople was not a matter of serious doubt ;\nthough of course it\nwas still suh judice for the Society and for the scientific world.\nThe Hon. Everaed Feilding then read a paper on \" Some\nSittings with Eusapia Palladino,\" as follows :\nThe subject on which I am to address you this afternoon\nconcerns certain recent experiments conducted by Mr, Hereward\nCarrington, Mr. Baggally, and myself, on behalf of this Society,\nwith the famous\u2014perhaps some will expect me to use the word\nnotorious\u2014medium, Eusapia Palladino, in Naples. The class of\nmanifestations associated with this medium belong exclusively\nto what are called the physical phenomena of spiritualism.\n(The word spiritualism, of course, in this connection implies a\ntheory to account for the phenomena in question, but in using\nit I wish it to be understood that I do so only provisionally\nand without intending myself either to endorse or to reject\nthe spiritualist hypothesis).\nIt is a very long time since the subject of these physical\nphenomena has been considered at meetings of this Society.\nOur President, Mrs. Sidgwick, did indeed touch upon them in\nher Presidential Address, but only to point out that whereas\ngreat progress had been made in almost all the other subjects\nlaid down for study in the original programme of the Society,\nin her opinion practically no positive advance had been made\nin our knowledge, not only of the nature but even of the\nexistence of these phenomena.\nMrs. Sidgwick would of course be the first to admit that\nthis opinion is merely personal to herself, and if we take into\naccount, as I think we should, investigations of other observers\nnot connected with this Society, it is an opinion which many\nwill not share. But so far as investigations of the Society itself\na2\n\f116 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.\nare concerned\u2014counting only investigations subject to the same\ncritical examination and careful presentment of evidence which it\nhas been our aim to offer regarding other branches of our work\nit is strictly true. The one problem which, on the foundation\nof the Society, figured so prominently in its scheme, and which,\non account of the wealth of evidence concerning it, and its\napparent susceptibility of exact examination, seemed likely to\nbe among the first to reach solution one way or the other,\nhas proved the very one upon which opinions have remained\nthe most divided and regarding which the hopes and expecta-\ntions of the original investigators and their successors have faded\nfirst into disappointment and ultimately almost into despair.\nThe reason for this failure to reach any generally accepted\nconclusions as to the existence of these phenomena is not\nvery far to seek. In the first place, the number of persons\nthrough whose agency they are reported to occur has always\nbeen much restricted, and has, since the disappearance of the\nfamous D. D. Home, been almost entirely composed of people\nof a more or less uneducated class who worked their gifts,\nwhatever they may have been, for gain, preferring rather to\nplease and astonish their own admirers, against an equivalent\nin cash value, than to lend themselves to serious and exact\nexamination. Most of them, even if we assume their original\nhonesty or the occasional display by them of powers superior\nto mere conjuring, succumbed to the temptations of their trade,\nand finding that the bulk of their adherents were as well\nsatisfied with conditions which admitted opportunity for decep-\ntion as with conditions which did not, chose the easier and\nmore profitable course of fraudulent mediumship ;\n\u2014a calling,\nby the way, which has this singular advantage over any other,\nthat, while its value depends wholly upon a profession of\npowers superior to those of ordinary mankind, a disclosure\nthat they are nothing of the sort appears rather to enlist the\nsympathy and encouragement of your victims than to excite\ntheir indignation and reproach. There have, it is true, been\na certain number of private persons possessing, or reputed to\npossess, the powers in question, but they have for the most\npart either regarded them as too sacred for investigation, or\ntoo wicked for exercise, or else they have professed themselves\ntoo indifferent to the whole matter or too anxious about the\n\fJuly, 1909. General Meeting. 117\npossible consequences to their health, to care to submit them-\nselves for observation. I am of course generalizing, and there\nare exceptions, but if one takes it broadly, between the decep-\ntions of the one class and the difficulties raised by the other\nit has been possible in this country to do but little. We are\ntold by our critics among convinced spiritualists that the fault\nis largely ours, and that our unsympathetic attitude has been\nthe cause of our ill-success. I am inclined to think there\nmay be some justice in this complaint. But when failure has\nfollowed upon failure, when fraud upon fraud has been dis-\ncovered\u2014I need not, to those of you who have followed this\nsubject, recite the catalogue\u2014a body of investigators, as well\nas a single individual, would be more than human if they\nresisted the current of their experiences and were able to\ncontinue to approach the examination of fresh cases with the\nsame sympathy and balance as at first.\nIn the year 1894 a break came in the chain of negative\nexperiments. Attention on the continent had for some time\nbefore been directed to Eusapia Palladino, daughter of an\nItalian peasant, illiterate, unable to read, or to write more\nthan her own name, and to the remarkable phenomena said\nto take place through her mediumship. She had already been\nthe subject of investigation by certain spiritualist groups of\nobservers, and had by them been brought to the notice, in\nthe first instance, of the Spanish Professor Acevedo, and later\nof Professors Lombroso, Tamburini, and others. Shortly after-\nwards a series of experiments were conducted by a further\ngroup of scientific men in Milan, including Professor Schiaparelli,\nthe well-known astronomer. Professor Eichet of Paris, Professor\nGerosa, and Dr. Ermacora. Further experiments followed in\nWarsaw by M. Ochorowicz, and eventually, in the year I have\nnamed, 1894, Professor Eichet, whose interest had been speci-\nally stimulated, invited some of the leading members of this\nSociety, Professor and Mrs. Sidgwick, Mr. Myers, and Sir\nOliver Lodge, to attend a series of experiments in the South\nof France. The report by Sir Oliver Lodge was printed in\nthe Journal S.P.B., for November, 1894, and amounted to an\nexpression of conviction, in which Mr. Myers concurred, of\nthe possession by Eusapia of some supernormal power affecting\nmatter, by which she was able to produce movements of material\n\f118 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, i909.\nobjects without any ascertainable material agency, and, still\nmore, produce matter itself or the appearance of matter, without\nany ascertainable source of supply.\nThe report was subjected to much criticism, notably on the\npart of Dr. Hodgson, who made a detailed analytical study of\nthe record of the experiments with a view to proving that it\ndid not of itself show that possibilities of fraud had been\nexcluded. This study appeared in the Journal for March-\nApril, 1895. I need not discuss it, except to say that it\nalways appeared to me more ingenious than convincing, and I felt,\nbalancing improbabilities, that the improbability of the truth of\nthe phenomena, preposterous as they were and preposterous as\nthe observers had themselves stated them to be, was less than the\nimprobability of such an eminent group of experimenters having\nbeen deceived in the manner suggested by Dr. Hodgson.\nIn any case, it was felt that further experiment was\nnecessary, and Eusapia came to Cambridge in the summer of\n1895 for an extended series of s<!^ances. You are, or at all\nevents most of you are, aware of what resulted. The only\nissue of the experiments was to establish fraud. Eusapia\ncheated, not once or twice, but apparently continuously and\ndeliberately, and although, from reading the unpublished records,\nit would appear that there was a certain number of phenomena\nfor which the ascertained trickery was insufficient to account,\nit was felt, I think unanimously, by the Committee, among\nwhom were several who had taken part in the earlier experi-\nments in Erance, that the results of these Cambridge sittings\nwere so unsatisfactory as to preclude any judgment in favour\nof Eusapia's supernormal attributes. Not only this, but so\nmuch doubt seemed to be thrown on the whole investigation\nthat it was decided to be inopportune to publish the report\nof the former experiments. Eusapia was dropped, and so far\nas any official investigation of her by this Society was con-\ncerned, her case was considered at an end.\nI am not going to discuss the justice of this conclusion or\nthe necessity of this policy. One thing to my mind is certain,\nand that is, that the whole character and conduct of the\nCambridge sittings differed markedly from the better seances\namong those which had preceded them, as well as among those\nin which I have myself recently taken part. They differed in\n\fJuly, 1909. General Meeting. 119\nthree ways. First, that for the most part they took place either\nin complete darkness or in light so poor as to be useless for\npurposes of observation, all attempts on the part of the experi-\nmenters to secure better light being resisted by Eusapia, or her\n\" control.\" Secondly, that the phenomena instead of being\nvaried and remarkable were monotonous and of small account\nand thirdly, that Eusapia herself interposed so many difficulties\nin the way of reasonable control that the observers ultimately\nabandoned any attempt at eftective control whatever, and, in\norder to study her methods, allowed her opportunities for cheat-\ning, of which opportunities she took the fullest advantages.\nI wish, however, to correct any misapprehensions on one\npoint, and it is this : the Cambridge experimenters did not\ndiscover any neio method of tricking, the possibilities of which\nhad not been perfectly well known before by experimenters on\nthe continent ; and further, that the sum total of her ascertained\nfraud was the trick of substitution of hands, which Eusapia\nis extremely clever at effecting when it is dark enough to\nenable her to bring her two hands close together and make\nthe two persons holding them believe they are holding different\nhands, when by mancBuvring she has contrived to get them\neach to hold different parts of the same hand, thus having\nher other hand free. This trick, which can only be success-\nfjully done in the dark, had been actually noticed and published\nby M. Torelli Viollier, a Milanese journalist, years before the\nCambridge sittings, and had already been the subject of a good\ndeal of discussion. There is, further, evidence, not only in the\nCambridge, but also in other records, that she also makes use of\nsubstitution of her feet, and I have no doubt that in certain\nmoods she would, if permitted, make as free use of her feet\nas she sometimes appears to do of her hands. So far as\nI know, with the exception of a few little childish devices,\nsuch as a hair or a nail, with which Eusapia has been pleased\nto amuse herself, sometimes outside seances altogether, and\nsometimes in order to bring off some special new effect at\nwhich she is asked to try her hand, these are the only tricks\nof which Eusapia has ever been definitely found guilty, in all\nthe countless experiments of which during the last sixteen or\nseventeen years she has been the subject with scientific men\nof almost every European nationality, though opinions have\n\f120 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, im\nvaried among those who have experimented with her as to\nhow often she practised them. Although, as I have said, the\nnet result of the Cambridge experiments was not to show\nany hitherto unsuspected method of trickery, they did never-\ntheless show that these particular already discovered methods,\nsubstitution of hands or feet in the dark, were far more\nfrequently resorted to than the continental observers had up\nto then ascertained. The reply, in effect, of the continental\nobservers was that that was the fault of the Cambridge\ngroup, who should not have allowed her ; and the reply of\nthe Cambridge group, that it was the fault of Eusapia, who\nwould not allow them to do anything else.\nSo much then for the Cambridge series, I believe the only\nwholly negative series of any importance in the experience of\nthis medium. This Society had, as I have said, dropped her : not\nso her continental investigators. From that time to this she\nhas undergone almost continuous experiments with Professor\nEichet, M. Camilla Flammarion, Professor and Madame Curie\nand Professor d'Arsonval and their colleagues of the Institut\nGeneral Psychologique, and other distinguished men in France\nProfessors Bottazzi and Galeotti in Naples, and Professor\nMorselli, with whose enormous work on the subject some of\nyou may be familiar, in Genoa. The list is by no means\nexhaustive. The evidence of men of European reputation had\nmounted up and could not further be ignored, and towards\nthe close of last year the Council of this Society decided that\nthe question should again be reopened, and Mr. Carrington and\nI were asked to go to Naples and try to obtain a further\nseries of experiments with Eusapia.\nI have, I fear, been a very long time in coming to my\npoint, but I have thought it necessary to make these pre-\nliminary remarks in order to put you in possession of the\ngeneral situation, and I must still say a few words as to the\nspecial objects in view in sending out this new Committee.\nGroup after group of eminent scientific men and others had\nalready experimented with Eusapia, and with practical unani-\nmity (with the exception of the Cambridge group) tempered,\nof course, in many cases with reserve, with reluctance and\nwith caution, and in the case of certain individual members, with\ncomplete dissent, had reported their belief in the display by\n\fJuly, 1009. General Meeting. 121\nher of some force hitherto unascertained. The general public,\nhowever, both scientific and lay, remained wholly unmoved\nand unconvinced. In the eyes of the world at large a belief\nin, even an interest in, the hypothesis of the existence of\nsuch a disreputable force, was indicative,\u2014and in this country\nundoubtedly, from our omniscient big man of science to\nour still more omniscient little man of the press, still is\nindicative,\u2014of a general mental unsoundness, and symptomatic\nof a not distant intellectual decay. The scientific reports\nproduced practically no impression. The facts reported were\npreposterous, and could not take place. Therefore, they did\nnot take place. What hope, then, is there that any report\nfrom a Committee of far less eminence than its predecessors\ncan possess any interest ?\nWell, the reason why the former reports have not had\nmore influence in forcing attention to their consideration, is\nthat in most of them the conclusions of the investigators\nhave been more prominent than the evidence by which they\nwere led to them. Even Sir Oliver Lodge's report of the\nexperiments at the ile Roubaud, which seemed detailed enough\nto those who were present, was not found proof against the\nhostile criticism of the absent Dr. Hodgson. Further, it was\nsaid that men of science, accustomed to deal with the forces\nof nature which do not cheat, are not the best investigators\nof the forces of human nature, especially the forces of\nmediumistic human nature, which generally try to. Better a\nconjuror. And so upon a conjuror the choice of the Council\nfell. In Mr. Hereward Carrington they found a man who,\nbesides having made conjuring a pursuit for many years, had\nfor some time conducted investigations for the American Society\nfor Psychical Eesearch, and after a pretty exhaustive exami-\nnation of most of the physical mediums in America, had\nwritten, to their very great annoyance and confusion, articles\nin the Journal of that Society showing how they did their\ntricks, as well as a large book on the Physiccd Phenomena of\nSpiritualism, in which he gave his opinion that, so far as\nanything that he had ever seen was concerned, there weren't\nany, though he judiciously left himself a loophole as regards\nthings which he had not seen. We had not only one\nconjuror, but two, for Mr. Baggally, a member of the Council\n\f122 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. jdlt, 1909.\nof this Society, joined Mr. Carrington and myself in time for\nour fifth stance. Mr. Baggally also, though not a professional,\nhad made a considerable practice of the art of conjuring with\nspecial reference to the conjuring of spiritualism, and as a\nresult of the investigation of practically every medium that\nhad appeared on the spiritualist horizon for the last thirty\nyears, had come to the same conclusion as Mr. Carrington,\nthough I think without any reservation whatever. As for\nmyself, though not a conjuror, I had had a fairly complete\neducation at the hands of fraudulent mediums, my unbroken\nexperience of whom had led me into an attitude of entire\nscepticism as regards the probability of ever finding anything\nworth serious examination, and, I regret to say, into such a\nhabit of flippancy of mind, or at all events of utterance,\nconcerning these things, as to have evoked censure, both public\nand private, from enquirers of a more sober temperament.\nSuch, then, was the Committee. As regards our method of\ninvestigation we felt that our one object should be not merely\nto come to a conclusion ourselves as to whether or not the\nphenomena were true, but to present a report in such a form\nas to enable a reader to judge of the possibility of our having\nbeen deceived ;\n\u2014that is, to give an absolutely full account of\nthe occurrences at each stance, with a detailed statement of\nthe precautions taken and of the control existing at each\nmoment. Our first care, therefore, was to procure a short-\nhand writer, who was present at an adjoining table through-\nout the seances, and to whom we dictated the conditions of\nlight, the phenomena themselves as they occurred and the\nposition and the visibility of the hands, feet and head of the\nmedium at the moment of occurrence. Whether we have\nsucceeded or not, we have at least attempted to avoid the\ncriticism which Mrs. Sidgwick made of Professor Morselli in\nher review of his book, that, before speculating upon the\nagency producing the phenomena, it was advisable to have\nmore evidence of their existence.\nThe seances took place in my bedroom on the 5 th floor of\na hotel. Across a corner of the room we hung, at the\nmedium's request, two thin black curtains forming a triangular\nrecess which is called the \" cabinet,\" about three feet deep in the\nmiddle. Behind this curtain we placed a small round table, and\n\fJdly, 1909. General Meeting. 123\nupon it various toys which we bought at Naples, a tambourine,\na flageolet, a toy piano, a trumpet, a tea bell, and so forth.\nIf you ask me to defend the reasonableness of this pro-\ncedure, I can only say that, as the phenomena which take\nplace in Eusapia's presence consist chiefly, though not ex-\nclusively, of the movements and transportations of smallish\nobjects within a certain radius of her, objects of some kind,\n\u2014it doesn't much matter what, \u2014have to be placed there.\nAnd as to the curtain, all I can say is that Eusapia believes\nthat the provision of a closed space helps to concentrate\n\" force,\" and that, as most of the effects seemed to radiate\nfrom the curtain, she is possibly right.\nEusapia herself never looked behind the curtain and did\nnot know what had been arranged there. Outside it was\nplaced a small oblong table 85 A cm. x 48 cm. (2 ft. 9 in. x\n1 ft. 6f in.). Eusapia herself sat at one end of this table with\nher back to the curtain, the back of her chair distant from\nthe curtain about a foot or 18 inches. One of us sat on\neach side of her, holding her hands and controlling her feet\nwith our legs and feet, while on certain occasions a third was\nunder the table holding her feet with his hands.\nIn front of her hung from the ceiling at a distance of\nabout 6 feet from her head, a group of 4 electric lights of\nvarying voltage, candle power, or colour, and therefore of\nvarying illuminating power, which could be altered from the\nshorthand writer's table by means of a commutator. The\nstrongest light was bright enough to enable us to read small\nprint at the furthest end of the room, and of course at our\nplaces at the table, while the weakest was sufficient to enable\nus to see the hands and face of the medium. On a very few\noccasions we were reduced to complete darkness.\nWe had eleven seances in all, at some of which we were\nalone, while at others we invited the assistance of friends\nof our own, and by way of experiment, of Eusapia's. The\nseances varied greatly. It is noteworthy that among the\nworst seances were those at which Eusapia's friends assisted,\nwhile the best were among those at which we were quite\nalone. As a general rule, though not invariably, the pheno-\nmena classified themselves according to the prevailing light\nthat is, for certain phenomena a feeble light seemed necessary,\n\f124 \/ournal of Society for Psychical Research. Jdlt, im\nwhile for others it was immaterial whether the light was weak\nor strong. From the point of view of facility for trickery we\nwere unable to trace any special connection between the de-\ngree of light and the phenomena generally producible in it.\nFrom the first seance to the last, with certain sets back, there\nwas a gradual progression in the phenomena ; that is, in the\nearlier stances they were restricted in variety, though not in\nfrequency of occurrence, while later on they became more com-\nplicated. Sometimes they took place so rapidly, at the rate\nof several a minute, that the dictation of one was constantly\ninterrupted by the occurrence of another. Sometimes they\nwere sparse and intermittent. On these occasions Eusapia\nwould ask for the light to be reduced, but we did not find\nthat the reduction of light had any favourable influence on\nthe production of the phenomena. On the contrary, the dark-\nest seances were those at which least occurred.\nThe actual procedure of a stance was as follows : About\nhalf-an-hour before the expected arrival of Eusapia the room\nwas prepared by the removal of unnecessary furniture, the\narrangement of the objects inside the curtain, and so on.\nOne or two of us remained there, while one went downstairs\nto await her arrival. She came escorted by her husband, who\nthen went away, and Eusapia was brought alone up the five\nflights of stairs to our rooms. She immediately sat down at\nher place at the table, with her back to the curtain, behind\nwhich, as I have said, she never looked. Sometimes the\nmanifestations, which I will describe presently, began at once\nin the brightest light. Sometimes we had to wait half-an-\nhour, an hour, even an hour and a half, before anything took\nplace. Those delays seemed to proceed from one of two\ncauses. Either she was in such a flamboyantly good temper\nand talked so incessantly that she did not give her mind to\nthe proceedings ; or else she appeared so unwell and fatigued\nas to be incapable of accomplishing anything. On the former\noccasions there was nothing to do but to wait till she had tired\nherself out with her own conversation. Eventually she would\nbegin to yawn. This was a favourable symptom, and when\nthe yawns were followed by enormous and amazing hiccoughs,\nwe knew it was time to look out, as this was the signal for\nher falling into a state of a trance.\n\fJuly, 1909. General Meeting. 125\nHer trance was of varying stages. It was not absolutely\nnecessary for the production of phenomena of a simple kind,\nand in two or three seances she remained wide awake\nthroughout and had a continuous memory of the proceedings.\nHer state of half trance, which was her usual condition during\nthe production of phenomena, was only distinguishable from\nher normal state by the fact that she was quieter in demean-\nour and by the fact that she professed to have no recollection of\nwhat had happened ; in her state of dee}) trance, however, which\ndid not often supervene, but, when it did, was nearly always\naccompanied by the more startling phenomena, she appeared\ndeeply asleep, sometimes lying immovable in the arms of one\nof the controllers at either side and always surrendering her-\nself completely to the fullest control of her hands. In this\nstate she spoke little and in a deep bass voice, referred\nto herself in the third person as \" my daughter \" or \" the\nmedium,\" and called us \" tu.\" In this state she professes to\nbe under the \" control \" of a spirit to whom she gives the name\nof \" John King \" and who claims to be the chief agent for\nthe production of her phenomena. In her state of half trance\nthere constantly appears to be a battle between her and this\n\" control,\" which manifests itself through tilts or levitations\nof the table, and, by means of a code, gives directions as to\nthe conduct of the seance and the degree of light to be\nallowed, against which Eusapia herself often protests vigor-\nously. Thus 5 tilts of the table mean less light. Eusapia\ngenerally insists on the light remaining up, or if it has been\ndiminished, on its being turned up again. The table, how-\never, persists in its demand and Eusapia eventually gives way.\nNow as to the phenomena themselves. They consisted in\nthe first place of levitations of the table at which we sat,\noutside the curtain. As a rule the table began to rock in a\nmanner explainable by the ordinary pressure of her hands. It\nthen tilted in a manner not so explainable, that is, in a direc-\ntion away from the medium while her hands were resting\nlightly on the top, and finally it would leave the ground\nentirely and rise to a height of one or two feet rapidly,\nremain there an appreciable time and then come down.\nSometimes there would be slight contact with the hands on\nthe top, but very frequently no apparent contact whatever, her\n\f126 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.\nhands being held by us at a distance of a foot or two from\nthe table, either in her lap or above the table. These levita-\ntions were among the most frequent phenomena and took\nplace in the brightest light. No precautions that we took\nhindered them in the slightest. She had no hooks, and we\ncould never discern the slightest movement of her knees or\nfeet. We very often had our free hands on her knees, while\nher feet were controlled either by our feet or by one of us\nunder the table, and were generally away from the table legs,\na clear space being discernible between her and the table.\nSometimes a partial levitation or tilt would last a very long\ntime, half a minute or even a minute, during which the table\nremained at an angle. We would press it down and it would\ncome up again as though suspended on elastics.\nOne of the most frequent phenomena was movements of the\ncurtain behind her. For this she generally, though not always,\ndemanded a reduction of the light, but it still remained suffi-\ncient to enable every movement of the medium to be clearly\nseen even from the further end of the table. She would\ngenerally hold out one of her hands towards the curtain,\nalways held by or holding one of ours at a distance of about\n8 or 12 inches from it, and the curtain would bulge out to-\nwards it. Sometimes the same effect would be produced if one\nof us held our own hands towards the curtain at her request.\nThe bulge was a round one, as if the curtains were pushed\nout from behind. If we made a sudden grab at the bulge, no\nresistance was encountered. There was no attachment to her\nhand, as we constantly verified by passing our hands between\nher and the curtain. Nor would any attachment produce the\nthe same effect, as the curtain was so thin that the point of\nattachment of any string would at once have been seen. Be-\nsides these bulges in response to her or our gestures, there\nwere spontaneous movements of the curtain, often very violent,\nand frequently the whole curtain would be flung out with so\nmuch force that the bottom of it came right over to the\nfurther end of the table. This occurred notwithstanding that\nEusapia herself was perfectly visible and motionless, both hands\nheld and separately visible upon the table, her feet away from\nthe curtain in front of her under the table.\nThe next phenomenon was touches by some invisible object\n\fJuly, 1909. General Meeting. 127\nthat is, while the light was strong enough to see the face and\nhands of Eusapia, we were constantly touched on the arm,\nshoulder or head by something which we could not see. The next\ndevelopment was grasps through the curtain by hands. When I\nsay hands, I mean palpable living hands with fingers and nails.\nThey grasped us on the arm, shoulder, head and hands. This\noccurred at times when we were absolutely certain that Eusapia's\nown hands were separately held on the table in front of her.\nThe first occasion on which this occurred to me is among\nthe phenomena most vivid in my memory. I had been sitting\nat the end of the table furthest from Eusapia. Mr. Car-\nrington and Mr. Baggally had for some time been reporting\nthat something from behind the curtain had been touching\nthem through it. At last I told Eusapia that I wanted to\nexperience this also. She asked me to stand at the side of\nthe table and hold my hand against the curtain over her\nhead. I held it 2i to 3 feet above her head. Immedi-\nately the tips of my fingers were struck several times\nthen my first finger was seized by a living hand, three\nfingers above and thumb beneath, and squeezed so that I felt\nthe nails of the fingers in my flesh ;\nand then the lower\npart of my hand was seized and pressed by what appeared\nto be the soft part of a hand. Eusapia's two hands were\nseparately held by Messrs. Carrington and Baggally, one on the\ntable and one on her knee. These grasps, if fraudulent, could\nonly have been done by an accomplice behind the curtain.\nThere was no accomplice behind the curtain.\nThe next development was that these hands became visible.\nThey generally, though not always, appeared between the part-\ning of the curtains over Eusapia's head. They were of\ndifferent appearances, dead, paper white, and of a natural colour.\nI think only once was a hand both seen and felt at the\nsame time, and that was when a hand came out from the\nside, not the middle of the curtain, seized Mr. Baggally and\npulled him so hard as almost to upset him off his chair.\nI have followed the general development of these hands\nthrough the course of the seances, but meanwhile other pheno-\nmena had been occurring. As a rule, after the movements\nof the curtain, the first manifestation took the form of violent\nnoises inside the cabinet, as though the tea table were being\n\f128 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.\nshaken. It was sometimes shaken so hard that the objects\non it fell off. It then itself appeared over Eusapia's shoulder\nand landed on our table horizontally, that is, with its top\nresting on our table and its legs pointing into the cabinet.\nIt would then, during the space of a minute appear to hang\nthere, partly supported no doubt by Eusapia's arm or ours\nas we held her hand, and try to climb on our table, which\nit never, however, succeeded in doing, but eventually fell back.\nThis transportation of the table took place several times, till\nat length, to prevent its upsetting our arrangement of the\nobjects on it, we took to tying it down, after which it was once\nor twice violently shaken, but did not otherwise molest us.\nAfter this, however, the objects which had been placed upon\nit were transported from within one by one. The flageolet\ntapped me on the head, the tambourine jumped on to my lap,\nthe toy piano landed on the head of a friend of mine ; the\ntea bell was rung and presently appeared, ringing, over\nEusapia's head carried by a hand which attached it quickly\nto her hair, and just as I was putting up my free hand to\ndetach it, reappeared, detached the bell itself, rang it again\nover Eusapia's head, and threw it on to the seance table.\nWhile this was occurring I was holding Eusapia's left hand\nclose to my face, while Mr. Baggally held her right hand\nunder the curtain on the opposite corner of the table, and\nthe light was sufficient for the shorthand writer from his\ntable, at a distance of about 8 or 9 feet from Eusapia, to\nsee the hand which carried the bell.\nOne of the most interesting transportations of objects was\nthat of a board on which we had put a large lump of wet\nclay in the hope of obtaining an impression of one of these\nhands. I was controlling to Eusapia's right, and Mr. Ryan, a\nfriend of mine whom we had invited to the seance, to her\nleft, and therefore opposite to me. Her right hand was under\nmine on my side of the table. Her left hand was on Mr.\nEyan's on his side. Both were motionless and visible. Mr.\nCarrington was standing behind me. The clay had been placed\non the tea table inside the curtain, directly behind Eusapia.\nAt a certain moment Mr. Carrington saw it appear at the\nfurther side of the curtain, behind Mr. Eyan, and travel\nthrough the air on to Mr. Eyan's shoulder. I noticed it first\n\fJULT, 1909. General Meeting. 129\nat that point. I saw it slide gently clown his right arm, across\nEusapia's hand which held his, cross the table towards me, and\nland on the top of my hand which held Eusapia's right.\nAnother class of phenomenon consisted of lights, which at one\nseance appeared twice over her head, once in her lap, and once\nat the side of the curtain furthest from her. They were of three\nkinds, a steady blue-green light, a yellow light, and a small\nsparkling light like the spark between the poles of a battery.\nBesides the visible hands, which were clear and distinct,\nthere were also more or less indescribable appearances of\nvarious kinds, in themselves of the most suspicious character\nwhite things that looked like handfuls of tow ; black things\nlike small heads at the end of stalk-like bodies, which emerged\nfrom the middle or side of the curtain and extended them-\nselves over our table ;\nshadowy things like faces with large\nfeatures, as though made of cobweb, that shot with extreme\nrapidity and silence from the side of the curtain.\nThere were also other phenomena, but the last which I\nshall touch on now were movements of objects outside the\ncurtain at a distance from Eusapia of from one to three feet. I\nspeak chiefly of a stool which was placed on the floor, about\na yard from Eusapia. She held her hand towards it, held by\none of us, and presently the stool moved towards her ; she then\nmade gestures of repulsion, and it moved away from her. The\nshorthand writer, who, during part of the time, was standing\nclose to it, passed his hand round it several times to ascertain\nthat it had no attachment, but it continued to move. There was\na clear space between her and it. The light was sufficient for\nme to follow the movements of the stool while I was standing\nup at the end of the table furthest from Eusapia.\nI am not attempting in this paper to do more than describe\nthe kind of thing that took place. For the precautions that\nwe took, for the searchings of the medium's person, for the\ncontrol that existed at the time of the production of each\nphenomenon, and for a general discussion of the possibilities\nof deception (incidentally I may remark that two or three\ntimes we had opportunity in sufficient light to observe her\nsubstitution trick, unaccompanied, however, by any phenomena),\nor hallucinatioiL, I must refer you to our detailed report when\nit is published.\n\f130 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.\n( ' 1 1 am fully aware that for evidential purposes a statement\nof the kind I am now making is absolutely valueless, nor do\nI pretend that for all the phenomena I have described the\nconditions were of equal evidential value. I have, however,\nto report on the part of my two colleagues and myself our\nfirm conviction that for some of the phenomena, including\nsome of the more remarkable ones, we obtained evidence of\nunimpeachable validity. Further, that though a considerable\nportion of the manifestations, taken by themselves, must be\nregarded as non-evidential, we had no ground for believing in\nthe fraudulent production of any one of them.\nOn the other hand, I wish it to be clearly understood that\nthis expression of conviction is a purely personal one on the\npart of the actual investigating committee, and in no way\nrepresents the corporate view of the Council of this Society,\nwhich, by the way, has no corporate view on any subject\nwhatever, and the majority of which has not yet even seen\nour report, which has not yet passed through the press.\nI will, in conclusion, say one thing more. While I have\nconvinced myself of the reality of these phenomena and of the\nexistence of some force not yet generally recognised which is\nable to impress itself on matter, and to simulate or\ncreate the appearance of matter, I refrain for the present\nfrom speculating upon its nature. Yet it is just in this\nspeculation that the whole interest of the subject lies. The\nforce, if we are driven, as I am confident we are, to pre-\nsuppose one other than mere conjuring, must either reside in\nthe medium herself and be of the nature of an extension of\nhuman faculty beyond what is generally recognised ; or must\nbe a force having its origin in something apparently intelligent\nand external to her, operating either directly from itself, or\nindirectly through or in conjunction with some special attribute\nof her organism. The phenomena then,\u2014in themselves pre-\nposterous, futile, and lacking in any quality of the smallest\nethical, religious, or spiritual value,\u2014are nevertheless sympto-\nmatic of something which, put at its lowest by choosing the\nfirst hypothesis, must, as it filters gradually into our common\nknowledge, most profoundly modify the whole of our philosophy\nof human faculty ; but which, if that hypothesis is found in-\nsufficient, may ultimately be judged to require an interpreta-\n\fJuly, 1909. General Meeting. 131\ntion involvino- not onlv that modification, but a still wider\none, namely, our knowledge of the relations between mankind\nand an intelligent sphere external to it. Although one may-\napproach the investigation of the phenomena themselves in a\nlight, shall I say, even a flippant spirit,\u2014(I sometimes think\nthat in this way alone one can preserve one's mental balance\nin dealing with this kind of subject),\u2014one must regard them\nas the playthings of the agency which they reveal, and the\nmore perfect revelation of that agency, whatever it may be,\nthrough the study of them, is surely a task as worthy of the\nmost earnest consideration as any problem with which modern\nscience is concerned. If our report, by reason of its form and\ndetail, is found to do something towards supplying a further\nevidential basis for, and therefore directing the attention of\nmen of science in this country towards, the far more important\nand elaborate published investigations of many of our more\neminent predecessors, and of inducing them to take a part in\nthe research, I shall feel that it has amply served its purpose.\nMe. W. W. Baggally then spoke to the following effect\nIn forming an opinion on the phenomena that we witnessed in\nthe presence of Eusapia Palladino, it was very important to\nbear in mind any normal methods by which she might have\nproduced them. Thus, it might be supposed that she had\nfreed \u2022 one of her hands or fc^t by substitution or by the\nmere removal of it from the hand or foot of the controller,\nleaving him under the impression that he still felt it ; or\nthat she used her head or some other part of her body, or\nsome mechanism concealed about her person, or that she had\nan accomplice. But all these methods would require darkness,\nwhereas it was in light, more or less strong, that the majority of the\nphenomena took place. In many cases both hands of Eusapia were\ndistinctly seen above or quietly resting on the seance table, or both\nher hands were clearly seen as they were held by the controllers,\nand at the same time her body was in view down to her feet.\nI will now refer to one or two phenomena which took\nplace under these conditions. At the termination of Seance VI.,\nthe light being good, the medium released both her hands\nfrom control and placed them on the table. They were\nperfectly visible to all of us. The curtain on her right, which\nwas not in contact with any part of her body, made a slight\n\f132 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1909.\nmovement. Owing to the good light and to my position, I\ncould see distinctly, at the same moment, her head, her two\nhands, her body down to her feet and the curtain, which\nwas close to me, but not touching her. Very shortly after-\nwards, while I was still intently watching Eusapia, who did\nnot move, the curtain bulged out as if pressed by a balloon\nfrom within the cabinet. The bulge was about a foot and a\nhalf from her head and on a level with it. She was examined\nshortly afterwards at this S(^ance, and no mechanism was found\nconcealed about her person. The force which produced the\nphenomena seemed capable both of attracting and of repelling\nmatter. On one occasion, the little stool, which was placed at\na distance of 3 feet from Eusapia, moved away from her when\nshe made a motion of her hand as if pushing it, and came\ntowards her when she moved her hand as if beckoning it. I\nwas between her and the stool, controlling her foot. Her hand\nwas in mine when she made the motions, and at a distance\nof several feet from the stool.\nAt the eleventh seance a hand squeezed my left hand several\ntimes and grasped my left arm. At the time not only could\nI see the mediun:i's hands, but I was grasping them separately\nby her two thumbs with both my hands, and keeping them a\ngood distance apart. Mr. Feilding then spontaneonsly said that\nhe conld see me doing this (which showed that I was not\nhallucinated). The control of Eusapia's foot was verified by\nme at the time, and she could not have raised it to the\nheight of my hand and arm without detection.\nI have no theory to advance as to the nature of the force\nthat was manifested at these seances, but I witnessed enough\nphenomena under the strict conditions above described to con-\nvince me of the existence of some supernormal force which\nmanifests itself in the presence of this medium, and is capable\nof moving matter at a limited distance from her body.\nME.

Oct., 1909.\nA EEPLY TO PEOFESSOE PIGOU'S CEITICISM\nOF CEOSS-COEEESPONDENCES.\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nAt the conclusion of the recently issued Part of the\nProceedings (Part LVIII. Vol. XXIIL, pp. 286-303) there is\nan interesting discussion by Professor Pigou of the legitimate\ndeduction that can be made concerning the source of the\ncross-correspondences which have been so far reported.\nHe discusses the question with an open mind, and leaves it\nopen at the end, but he is inclined to press for the proba-\nbility that the whole thing originates in the subliminal activity\nof one or more of the autoniatists; and he adduces as the\nchief argument in favour of this view the fact that the auto-\nmatic writings obtained by Mrs. Verrall, in response to an\neffort of Dr. Verrall to transmit the substance of a literary\nepisode, exhibited very similar flaws and difficulties and bore\na very close resemblance to the script obtained, also through\nMrs. Verrall, in response to an ostensible attempt from a Myers\ncontrol to construct and convey a characteristic literary allusion.\nIn fact, Professor Pigou claims that the \" one-horse dawn\n\"\nincident exhibits throughout all the signs of a typical case of\ncomplementary cross-correspondence, and runs in close analogy\nwith the \" Browning, Hope and Star \" and the \" Hail, immortal\nEome \" incidents.\nWith this statement I fully concur. I admit the close\nresemblance of this whole episode with those which are claimed\nas the work of a discarnate mind. But the argument which\nProfessor Pigou bases upon this fact is that, just as the\nformer script originated wholly in subliminal activities, so also\nthe latter scripts must probably have originated so likewise.\nHere however I disagree, for I must deny the premise. The\n\" one-horse dawn \" script originated not at all in subliminal\nactivities, but in the conscious plan and intention of Dr.\nVerrall.\nUndoubtedly the agency of transmission was subliminal\nactivity,\u2014the transmission was quite beyond Dr. Verrall's\nconscious power,\u2014but it was his intelligence and active mind\nwhich set the subliminal activities to work. It sat above\n\fOct., 1909. ProfessoT Pigou on Gross-Correspondences. 135\nthem and pulled the strings, or at any rate it initiated the\nenterprise.\nLet this be applied to other complementary cross-corre-\nspondences, and the moral is obvious.\nSo far as the incident goes, it shows that subliminal\nactivities do 7iot originate things of this sort. They carry out\nan effective suggestion, externally initiated, just as the\nsubliminal activities of Pierre Janet's or Charcot's patients\ncarry out their physiological or pathological suggestions ; but\nan intelligent mind is needed to start the whole business, and\nif it were not thus started, any result obtained would presum-\nably be mere gibberish and would mean nothing to anybody.\nThe only reason why all that apparently meaningless stuff\nquoted on p. 301 of Professor Pigou's paper has any signi-\nficance, is because Dr. Verrall tells us what his intention\nwas ; he says he endeavoured to transmit something about a\none-horse dawn ; and in the light of that information we\nperceive that the fragments fit in.\nSimilarly the posthumous Myers control claims that he was\ntrying to transmit something about Browning, Hope and a\nStar, or about Eome and two persons, one of whom was\nPrimus inter ^xtres ; and we perceive that in his case also\nthe fragments fit in.\nIt is true that we may believe the one testimony and not\nthe other, but my contention is that the similarity of the\n\" one-horse dawn \" incident to the \"Abt Vogler \" and the other\nincident is a help and not a hindrance to those who think\nthey detect the initiating agency of the persisting intelligence\nof some specific individual.\nIn so far as the one case was certainly brought about by\nan incarnate intelligence, and in so far as any deduction by\nanalogy can be drawn, it may be held to follow that the\nother cases were brought about by a discarnate intelligence\nfor by analogy both sets of messages were initiated by intel-\nligences, acting of set purpose, conscious of what they wished,\nthough constrained to achieve something like the desired\nresult by unknown means through unconscious channels. And\nthe one intelligence purported to be that of F. W. H. Myers,\njust as the other intelligence purported to be that of Dr.\nVerrall.\n\f136 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1 909.\nThe 'set purpo.se '\nin the discaniate cases was indeed specially\nemphatic, since the round-about and allusive character of those\nscripts was not solely accidental or trivial or fautc de mieux ;\nit has the air of being part of a plan, for it is essential to\na real effective cross-coiTespondence that the fragments sepa-\nrately shall be unintelligible, each to its respective medium,\nin order that the operation of ordinary living telepathy may\nbe excluded.\nA CASE OF HALLUCINATION.\nBy J. G. PiDDINGTON.\nI LEARNT from Dr. M. that a patient of his, whom I will\ncall Mrs. E., had had a curious psychical experience. The\naccount which he gave me was briefly as follows\nMrs. R., who had given birth to a son over two years previously,\nwas expecting her second confinement in the beginning of June. On\nApril 12th, 190 ,^ she gave birth to a seven months' child. During\nthe labour, which lasted rather over four hours, she saw almost con-\ntinuously the figure of her father, who had been dead twelve months,\nstanding by her. During her first confinement she had seen a\nblue-grey bird perched on the picture-rail, and had thought that the\ndoctors attending her\u2014Di-. M. and Dr. C. \u2014weie trying, or at any rate\nwishing, to crush the life out of it.\nDr. M. obtained Mrs. E.'s permission for me to call upon\nher, which I did on May 7th, 190\u2014, and I wrote the present\naccount on the following day. My interview with Mrs. E. lasted\nsixty-five minutes, and she impressed me as being an exception-\nally clear-headed and scrupulous witness. The record of the\ninterview which follows does not profess to reproduce Mrs. E.'s\nstatements rcrhatim, except where words are enclosed in inverted\ncommas. Mrs. E., though choosing her words carefully, spoke\nwith too great fluency to allow of my taking down her ijjsissima\nverba. I regret that I could not do so, for she described her ex-\nperiences with a nicety and discrimination of phrase to which\nmy record does faint justice. jMy record has, however, been\nrevised by Mrs. E. and her husband, and may accordingly be\nconsidered to be accurate so far as it goes.\n^ The precise date is given in Mr. Pidilington's original account, whicli is\nin our possession. Editor.\n\fOct., 1909. A Case of Hallucination. 137\nRecord of Interview.\nMks. R. At 9.20, on the morning of April 12th, 190\u2014, I was seated\non a sofa by the window in the drawing-room writing oi\\t\non a slate the menu for dinner, when \" my father walked\ninto the room.\"\nJ. G. P. Did you see him walk in 1\nMrs. R. No; I was just going to explain. I say \"walked in,\" but I\ndidn't actually see him do so. After the experience was\nover\u2014it lasted some hours\u2014I asked myself, \" How did I\nknow my father came in?\" \"Did I see his legs mover'\nAnd I also asked myself why did I say to Dr. M. (whom I\nsaw about 2.4.5 p.m. that afternoon) that my father\n\" walked in.\" The answer I gave myself was this :\n\" His\nappearance had to my brain all the ordinary concomitants\nof the physical life.\" I can't, then, say how he came in ;\nand I can't say how he was dressed. I don't know\nwhether I saw his arms and legs. I saw his face very\nclearly, especially his eyes, which were always very\nstriking.\nJ. G. P. Did you notice any colour?\nMrs. R. It appeared to me as a form seen at dusk. The eyes and\nbrow appeared as they would in broad daylight.\nJ. G. P. Did they stand out from the rest of the features ?\nMes. R. No ; I can't describe exactly. Let me try and explain. After\nyou've gone I shouldn't be able to say what coloured suit\nyou had on. It would be just the same with any visitor.\nI realised only after this experience that I'm not much\nin the habit of noticing what kind of clothes people\nwear, especially when their conversation is absorbing or\ninteresting me.\nThe child was born about 1.45 p.m., and lived a few\nhours.\nJ. G. P. When had you expected the birth ?\nMrs. R. About seven weeks later. I had no idea that the pains I was\nsuffering when the figure first appeared were the beginning\nof labour. I stayecl in the drawing-room from 9.20 till\n12.30, and all the time my father was in the room, within\ntwo feet, or less, of me. I was lying on the sofa, and\nmy father was standing close beside me and looking down\nat me. I was looking into his eyes, and he into mine\n\f138 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., im\nYet there was no sense of physical fatigue, such as there\nwould have been if two ordinary people had been staring\nat each other for three hours.\nJ. G. P. While you were looking at your father were j'ou aware of\npain 1\nMes. R. Yes. When the vision began I was thinking about cookery,\nand not about my father at all. The pain I thought was\ncolic or cramp. I had no idea it was labour.\nJ. G. P. Do you think that the vision of your father had the efltect\nof deadening the pain at all 1\nMrs. R. That, of course, is a very difficult thing to say. The pains\ndue to the muscular contractions were probably not\ndiminished. When these pains came on \"I pi'obably shut\nmy eyes and my inner vision too,\" and did not see my\nfather. But during the interludes I think I was conscious\nonly of my father's presence, and did not feel as much\npain as otherwise I should have done. I can, of course,\nonly judge by comparison with the pain I suffered during\nmy first labour ; and that may be misleading as a standard\nof comparison, because, as is often the case in a first\nlabour, it was greatl}' protracted and very severe.\nJ. G. P. Did you speak to your father 1\nMes. R. During my first confinement my favourite aunt, who had been\ndead about seven years, came into the room, and I clearly\nremember beseeching her repeatedly to take me with her.\nWhen this happened I had been inhaling a mixture of\nchloroform, ether, and alcohol.\nJ. G. P. Had you seen the figure of your aunt before you began to\ninhale ?\nMrs. R. I don't remember for certain whether I saw my aunt before\nor after I began inhaling.^ AVhen I first saw my father\n^ Mrs. R. wrote on May 11, 190\u2014, as follows : \"I only saw the figure of my\naunt during the last twenty hours or so of labour. But the figure of the blue-\ngrey bird appeared nearly forty-two hours before the birtli, and remained for\nabout five or six hours on the picture-rail. I spoke to it very often, I am told,\nand especially spoke to '\nothers ' who appeared to be attempting to catcli or\ncrush or injure it. The bird was very much in my thoughts, very real and very\ndear to me, and its safety was the one thing I thought of at the time, and during\nall the time I was aware of it. But I had very little recollection of its having\nappeared for some days afterwards.\"\n\fOct., 1909. A Case of Hallucination. 139\nI had not inhaled any of the mixture. My aunt looked\n\"angelic;\" there was, as it were, \"a brightness about\nher.\" My father looked like an ordinary human being\nseen in the dusk; or rather, I should say, \"seen at the\nlast point of daylight at which one can see a figure.\"\nWhen I left the drawing-room and went to my bedroom\nI didn't see the figure of my father. I can't say the\nfigure disappeared. I just forgot to think about it\nAfter lying on my bed face-downwards to get relief from\npain, and perhaps after two, three, or five minutes, I\nturned over on my back\u2014that particular pain having\npassed\u2014and I saw my father standing close by my bed-\nside just the same as in the drawing-room, except that\nthe light in the drawing-room fell on his face, whereas\nin the bedroom \" I was distinctly conscious of a figure\nbetween me and the light.\" I was also conscious of there\nbeing \"a countenance on the top of the figure,\" but I did\nnot notice other details.\nJ. G. P. Did you speak to the figure in the bedroom 1\nMks. R. In the drawing-room my father was just like an ordinary\nhuman being, and I was not aware that he was dead. In\nthe bedroom there was a new phase. I thought I was\na young girl of sixteen ; and I seemed to resume the\nordinary tenour of my life at that age. I thought I was\nliving at home as I was at the age of sixteen. I thought\nI was out riding with my father. Something went wrong\nwith a stirrup, and the groom\nJ. G. P. Did you see the groom ?\nMks. R. No; I didn't see him. \"I sensed he was there.\" The groom\ncouldn't get the stirrup right. This part of my experience\nwas rather like a mild nightmare. My husband, who\nwas in the bedroom with me for a short time, says\nthat I was talking a great deal with my father, and\nthat I asked him (my father) to come, and said I wanted\nhim. He also heard me talking about the stirrup a great\ndeal. I was then inhaling at intervals. I can't remember\nseeing my father after I was told the child was born.\nIt was only during the last quarter of an hour that I\nrealised that the pains I was suffering were those of\nchild-birth.\n\f140 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1909.\nJ. G. P How was it, if you were not expecting labour to come on,\nthat you had the chloroform, ether and alcohol mixture\nby you? '-\nMrs. R. I had been having cramp.s for months back, and had been\ninhaling the mixture, a very mild anaesthetic, now and\nagain to relieve them a little.\nAiter the child was born I lay and wondered if my\nfather would come again ; but he didn't.\nJ. G. P. Were you at all frightened by your experience ?\nMrs. R. (laughing) No ; not in the least. I delighted in his presence\nof which I had been deprived for a year.\nJ. G. P. Besides these two visions\u2014one of your father and one of\nyour aunt\u2014have you had any others ']\nMrs. R. Yes. I first saw a figure when I was thirteen years old.\nAt that age I was very much afraid of the dark; but,\nas you will see, this vision cured me of my dread.\nI was in bed, unable to sleep. I heard a knock at the\ndoor, and felt ver}^ nervous. I waited, but nothing\nhappened. I then put the bedclothes over my head and\ntried to go to sleep. Then came three knocks at the\ndoor. I called out \" Come in\n;\n\" but no one came in.\nI was in awful terror, and was trembling in agony. For\na. time nothing further happened. After what seemed\nlike an hour, and as I- was settling down to sleep, I\nsaid a prayer for protection for the whole house. I began\nto think over what had happened, and I said to myself\n\" I am a coward\n;\n\" and I determined to overcome my\ncowardice. So I went to the door and opened it. Before\nme stood a tall figure, taller than the architrave of the\ndoor by which it stood. (It was standing by a door\nopposite mine.) It was about 7 to 8 feet high. It was\ndressed in a grey cloak. Where the face should have\nbeen was darker than the rest of the figure, and the\ncavity of the eyes was darker. I could not exactly dis-\ntinguish the eyes, only the cavitj' where they should\nhave been. I saw no limbs. I was in perfectly good\nhealth at the time. I Vjanged the door shut and fled\nback in to bed. I was dreadfully afraid ;\nbut I said to\nmyself I must see it again ; and I was conscious that\nI was deliberately exerting my will to conr|uer my fear.\n\fOct., in09. A Case of Hallucination. 141\nI -went to the door and opened it. I saw the figure again\nacross the passage just the same as before. For the first\ntime my fear began to disappear. The figure seemed to\nmove like spray seen in sunshine. I mean it seemed to\nmove within itself, without liowever moving forwards.\nThen the figure grew smaller, turned and moved\u2014pro-\ngressed without limbs (it had no legs)\u2014glided round a\ncorner. I then got a shock, for I saw a basket containing\nlinen at a spot on the passage floor, where it was not\nthe custom to place such things. I followed the figure\ndown the passage as far as the door of my brother's\nroom, who was lying ill with ear-ache. He died five\ndays later. (No\u2014I'm not sure if my brother was in\nthat room on that night ; but he certainly was the next\nday.) The figure then disappeared in the doorway of my\nbrother's own room, which was next to the room in\nwhich he died five or six days later. I then went back\nto bed and was in a sort of dazed state for some time It\nwas February. The clock struck four, and as I listened\nto it I began to be nervous again, so I made myself get\nup and go out into the corridors. I gently opened every\ndoor on the first floor and ground floor and looked in\n(merely to overcome the nervousness), and then went\nout of the garden door and all about the garden ; and\nit was when I was out of doors that all fear passed,\nand I came in again feeling unusually elated. And never\nagain during my childhood did I have the least fear of\nthe dark, not even to swim in a lake or tarn at midnight.\nAnd this liberation from the awful slavery of fear I owe\nentirely to this apparition.\nSome nights afterwards, when my brother's body had\nbeen laid out, the linen was placed in a basket at the\nspot in the passage where I had seen the basket of linen\nwhen following the figure.\nWhen I sent Mrs. E. my record of our interview^, I put\nher several questions, which she answered in a letter dated\nMay 11, 190 \u2014. From this letter I append some extracts.\n\"... My senses were so dulled by the pain, and my memory\nby the weakness and prostration, which followed [the first confine-\nment], that accurate details elude me now, especially as to what I\ndid or said at the time.\n\f142 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1909.\nThe only things which have all along remained vividly clear are :\nthe blue-grey bird and my anxiety to protect it. Then the beautiful\nvision of my aunt, and uiy intense longing to go to her. Both\nthese (the bird and the angelic vision) came at intervals during the\nWednesday night, i.e. after 11.30 p.m. The labour began about\n11 p.m. on Wednesday night, and lasted through Thursday, Thursday\nnight, and Friday. Chloroform was administered about 6.15 p.m. on\nFriday, and the child born at 7.30 p.m.\nThe visions were recurrent, especially the bird. Whenever I\nturned to that side of the room I saw the bird on the picture rail\nfacing the window. I saw the visions both before and after inhaling\nthe A.E.C. mixture. I clearly remember that of my aunt recurring\nthree times; twice during the Wednesday night, remaining for long\nspaces of time; and again on Friday afternoon.\nAnother thing which I remember with terrible clearness, is the\nutter blank despairing disappointment when I awoke after the child\nwas born, and realised that I had to remain on earth, and had not\nbeen allowed to go to my aunt. A sort of frenzy of longing seized\nme to gather up my husband and child, and fly to her. For the\nvision so penetrated me with a wonderful sense of exquisite and\ncalm joy and heavenly satisfiedness (if one can use the word), that\nto come back to an earthly bedroom was really an agony. It was\na harsh and jarring sense of forlornness and misery which I shall\nnever forget as long as I live.\n... I never saw the bird moving to different places, though it ims\nin different parts of the picture rail. . . . But I often saw the\nbird tremble in its feathers, and its head moved. It had dark\nchina-blue wings, and a light grey-blue breast. In shape it was\nlike a bullfinch, but considerably larger, and [it had] a longer tail.\nIt remained for long spaces together on the rail, and I never saw\nit in the act of going awaj', although sometimes it did not appear\nto be there. (You will remember that we are speaking of a period\nof more than 40 hours' duration.)\nI did not touch the figure of my father, nor that of my aunt.\nI spoke often to both of them, but they did not answer. And yet\nmy father's changing expressions of face did serve as conversation\nwithout any actual words. I thought he spoke several times to\nthe groom whom I could not see, for he was between the two\nhorses. I saw the horses quite distinctly, but only for a short\ntime\u2014in my bedroom, not downstairs.\nWith my aunt it was quite different. It was not like friendly\n\fOct., 1909. A Case of Hallucination. 143\nhuman intercourse. Her atmosphere, her aura, penetrated me. She\nseemed to fill me with rays of her own effulgence, which gave me\nindescribable joy. But when the vision faded, and liefore it\nre-appeared again, I felt like an outcast, and trembled lest I should\nreally be left behind. I can distinctly remember kneeling before\nher when she re-appeared, and beseeching her to take me ;\nthough\nI cannot say whether I kneeled physically and sjwlie the words ])hym(dly.\nBut I think I did.\nMy aunt had arms, I know, because she held them out to me\nthe rest of her body was like shining draperies, and they shone\non the floor.\"\nCASE.\nL. 1177. Veridical Auditory Hallucination.\nThe following account of a telepathic auditory hallucination was\nsent to us by Mr. Severin Lauritzen, an Associate of the Society.\nMr. Lauritzen, who, it will be observed, recorded the case\na few minutes after its occurrence, writes\nHoLTE, Denmark, May 5th, 1909.\nI live in a villa in the country, and in a neighbouring villa lives\nmy married daughter, who is named Evelyn. There is only a\ndistance of 33 steps, or say some 22 yards, in a straight line, between\nthe houses. I have a telephone from a central station in my house,\nand also a short private telephone that connects the two houses. I\ncommence writing this 1.20 p.m., May 5th. The same day about\n1 o'clock my son-in-law, K., telephoned from his place of business in\nthe town to my house to say that he wanted to speak with Evelyn.\nIt was my wife who answered the telephone when K. called, and\nwhen she heard what he wanted she immediately pressed the button\nof the private telephone to summon E. Just before this moment E.\nheard her mother's very clear and distinct voice call \"Evelyn,\nEvelyn.\" She arose from her writing-desk where she sat absorbed\nin household accounts, opened the door to the hall in her house,\nand asked Miss N., who was working there: \"Did mother call?\"\n\"No,\" said Miss N., \"nobody called.\" E. said: \"Yes, she did call.\"\nThen she turned to go back to an open window in the room where\nshe had been writing, to see if her mother was outside there ; but\nshe did not reach the window before she heard the private telephone\nbell sounding, so she turned again and went straight to my house\nwithout answering the call per telephone. Passing the telephone\n\f14-t Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct.,1909.\nand Miss N., she said, '\u2022\nThere, you see, mother called.\" Arrived\nat my house, she foutid that her husband wanted to speak with\nher. Just as she had finished her conversation with her husband,\nI came out from an adjacent room to speak with her, but she\ninterrupted me and said, \" Now we have a clear case of telepathy !\nWhen E. walks in her garden she can sometimes, with a favourable\nwind (west), ami when certain doors and windows in my house\nare open, hear my public telephone bell sounding, and she expected\nher husband to call her per telephone in the course of the day.\nBut to hear my public telephone in this case, the sound would have to\npass to her from the hall in my house either through my kitchen (door\nfrom hall to kitchen was open), then through a closed door to a\npantry, through the pantiy and an open window there facing east,\nfurther across the gardens and round a corner of her house, through\nan open window there and into her room, or from my hall upstairs\nthrough a closed door and a bedroom, and then through an open\nwindow there facing east, then down and across the gardens, etc.\nall with an easterly wind, the most unfavourable. At two o'clock the\nsame day, I tried whether my public telephone could be normally\nheard where E. had been sitting. I had even opened the above-\nnamed pantry door, but not one of three persons [who tried]\ncould hear the telephone bell. Nobody was in the gardens when\nE. K. heard her name. In fact, nobody calling her by her Christian\nname could be there.\nThis, it seems to me, is a case of subliminal perception and\ntranslation either of a telepathic impulse or at least of a subliminally\ncaught, extremely weak, sound. There is at least the interesting\ntranslation (so often met with in telepathic and other cases), because\nthere was no one actualhj calling \" Evelyn, Evelyn.\" INIy wife corroborates\nthis ; I myself heard from my room all the proceedings in my hall,\nand we never call out in such cases ; it would be absurd not to\ntake the private telephone instead.\nI have much reason to believe that neither my wife nor my\ndaughter is in any way \"sensitive\" or \" mediumistic.\"\nS.

Case. 145\nLater, Mr. Lauritzen adds: June 2dth, 1909.\nMrs. L. was in a room upstairs with an open window eastward.\nWhen she heard the telephone call she just looked out of the\nAvindow to see whether Mrs. Kemp was accidentally in the garden\noutside, because she thought it might be Mr. Kemp who called,\nand she would then have informed her that the telephone called.\nNot seeing Mrs. Kemp there, she at once turned round, went eight\nsteps down the stairs, and took the telephone, heard Mr. Kemp say,\n\" I want to speak with Eva,\" or some such short remark, said\n\"Yes,\" turned round, and pressed the private telephone button to\nsummon Mrs. Kemp. Now, you remember that Mrs. K. heard her\nmother call her, went to her hall, said, \"Did mother calU\" returned\nto her room just beside the hall, and turned again when hearing her\nprivate telephone, or she heard it in passing it. You will see how\nunlikely it is that she should hear her mother's call immediately\nafter our public telephone had sounded, or as a consequence of its\nhaving sounded. No, the time between Mrs. L. looking out of her\nwindow and her pressing the private telephone button (the telephones\nare placed one yard apart), and the time between Mrs. Kemp's\nleaving her writing-desk and her hearing the private bell, must\nhave been almost exactly the same; so I am quite convinced that\nthe moment Mrs. L. looked out of her window to call Mrs. K.\n(but she did noi call out), was the moment of the telepathic impact.\nThe ladies are lively and intelligent, and fully aware of the import-\nance of being accurate in such matters. S. Lauritzkn.\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nIx the Archives de Psychologie for April, 1909, M. Emile Yung has an\narticle on \"Suggestibility in the Waking State.\" His duty is to\ninstruct the first year students at the University of Geneva in\nmicroscopy. Before the pupils are allowed to examine an object\nthrough the microscope, he gives them a short verbal description of what\nthey are to see. Some years since one of the pupils brought him a\ndrawing of a diatom which was so unlike the original that he sent\nhim back to the microscope. The second attempt was as remote from\nnature as the first, and M. Yung, looking hurriedly through the\nmicroscope, found that the object-slide was empty !\nActing on the hint he took occasion, in the course of fifteen years,\nto place empty slides before 80 pupils. Of these 63 reported that\nthe slides were empty, 6 saw images too A^ague to draw, or possibly\nfigures explicable by \" mouches volantes.\" But 11 produced finished\n\f146 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The last two were rarely successful.\nThe results are very similar to those described by Braid fiftv\nyears ago.\nThe Psychological Review, July, 1909, contains a long article by\nProfessor June Downey on Muscle Reading (with contact), which,\nhowever, has no direct reference to telepathy : and there is, perhaps,\nfrom the standpoint of Psychical Research, nothing strikingly new\nin the results obtained. But a careful exploration of the field of\nmuscle reading serves to illustrate once more the extreme difficulty\nof excluding all possible sensory indications in telepathic experimenting\nat close quarters. For \"it is difficult to comprehend without first-\nhand experience the wonderful accuracy of the operator's [percipient's]\nresponse to the slightest variation in the guide's [agent's] muscular\ntension. H., for instance has, as guide, placed a clock on a ledge\nabove a long table which is three and a half feet wide and flat\nagainst the wall. On Dy's arrival at the table, H. begins to chuckle,\nmentally thinking 'she can never reach it.' Dy raises herself on\ntip-toe and leans over the table exclaiming, 'I can never reach it.'\nH. sees in a visual flash Dy climbing the table and Dy actually\npulls herself over the table and gets the clock.\" Unfortunately,\nhowever, in this case we are not told whether the clock was going.\nMiss Downey found that between 70 and 80 per cent, of the persons\ntested by her proved fairly good subjects for simple muscle reading\nexperiments, such as finding hidden objects. She lays stress upon\nthe extraordinary difficulty which most persons experience in realising\ntheir own unconscious muscular movements. Very few could succeed\nin observing them : many refused to accept the explanation.\n\fOct., 1909. Notes on Current Literature. 147\nFour cases of pronounced verbal automatism, \u2014whispering, or moving\nthe lips, \u2014were observed : when it was recorded, it was found that\nthe agents were completely unconscious of their actions. F. P.\nIn the Revue de VHypnotisme, May, 1909, Dr. Berillon suggests\nthat the phenomena associated with the production and cessation of\nsleep tend to demonstrate the existence of a cerebral \" centre of\nawakening,\" a motor centre presiding over a group of motor activi-\nties on which awakening and the maintenance of the waking state\ndepend. Hypnosis is due to inhibition of this centre, and the\ntermination of hypnosis comes with the removal of the inhibition.\nThe evidence put forward by Berillon in support of his contention\nseems inconclusive.\nIn the Revue de VHypnotisme, June, 1909, there is an interesting\npaper by Dr. Georges d'Hotel on the importance of dilatation of the\npupil as a sign of suggestibility in the Avaking state. The first\nobservations recorded were made in the course of a political cam-\npaign. Dr. d'Hotel found that the people most easily won over to\nhis views were those Avhose pupils dilated when he was addressing\nthem. When persuasion was more difficult, he observed alternate\ndilatation and contraction of the pupils according as his efforts were\neffective or not. Later observations on the pupils of many persons\nunder a variety of suggestive or persuasive influences confirmed Dr.\nd'Hotel in his opinion as to the close relation existing between this\npupillary sign and mental receptivity.\nAt the present time there is perhaps no matter connected with\nthe psychology of suggestion on which it is more important to have\nnew observations and experiments than in regard to the conditions\nwhich hinder or favour the action of suggestion in what are\napparently Avaking states. It is mainly in relation to psycho-thera-\npeutics that the question has arisen, but a clear understanding of\nthe conditions which accompany or lead to suggestibility in ordinary\nlife is of great importance in connection with many of the problems\nof psychical research. Dr. d'Hotel's paper is a welcome contribution\nto a subject on which hitherto little of value has been published.\nA good instance of recovery of a lost memory by means of\nsuggestion during hypnosis is recorded by Dr. Paul Joire in the\nRevue de I' Hypnotisnie, July, 1909. M. F., an electrical engineer, had\ninvented an arc lamp free from certain defects which are common\nto all existing arc lamps. The problem presented was difficult, and\nthe solution was arrived at only after much thought. Having made\n\f148 Journal of. Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1909.\nthe necessary notes and drawings of his invention, M. F. laid them\naside for a time, being absorbed in other more urgent occupations.\nSoon afterwards, his health broke doAvn, and he was treated for\nneurasthenia by Dr. Joire. On his recovery, desiring to continue\nhis work on the arc lamp, he searched for the papers which he had\nput away six months previous!}'. He could not find them, and\nwhen he tried to work out the problem anew, he was unable to\nsolve it. He worked at it for five months without success, and\nfinally asked Dr. Joire to try to recover the lost memory during\nhypnosis. A graphic account is given by Dr. Joire of how M. F.\nin the hypnotic state was made to retrace the events of his life\nback to the occasion on which he had solved the problem, and\nof how the solution was again found and the original drawing\nreproduced.

G. Piddington on \" Some Classical Allusions\nin Mrs. Piper's Trance \" was read by Miss Verrall. This\npaper will, it is hoped, appear later in the Proceedings.\nREMINISCENT CRYSTAL VISIONS.\nThe following accounts by the Rev. H. E., received by us\nthrough Mr. F. C. Constable, relate to experiments similar to\nthe three recorded in the Joicrnal for November, 1908, but\ncarried out with other hypnotic subjects. The first account was\nreceived by Mr. Constable on January 5th, 1908 :\n\f152 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.,i909.\nNo. 4.\nMay 22, 1904. F. B. entranced and told to multiply 5789 by .3\nat a signal, after being awaked.\nOn waking and seeing me look at my watch, F. B. took up a\npencil and wrote automatically :\n5789\nF. B. always goes on doing (when possible) the suggested act,\nunless told he is only to do it once. As I forgot to mention this\nto him, he started the sum a second time, thus :\n3589\n! (B)\n10767\nAs soon as I saw him start (a) I said: \"Now begin counting\nbackwards from 100.\" This he did. When he came to 56 he\njumped to 45, and then began to laugh and talk about the mistake\nhe had made. F. B. then went back to 55 and continued the\ncounting. It was at 56 that he began the second sum (b) with\nother figures than those I gave him. In spite, however, of this\nchange, the (b) sum is worked correctly, proving, it seems to me,\nthat the reasoning is done with the waking mind, or else that the\nmind in hypnosis is still capable of reasoning.\nThe writing was done without planchette, the pencil being simply\nheld in the hand. The patient was cj^uite unconscious, both of the\norder and of the fact that he was writing at all. F. B. was\nthoroughly occupied with the counting backwards, and with laughing\nat his mistakes. He writes without taking his pencil off' the paper.\nWhen the pencil is taken off\", one figure is put on top of\nanother. He does the same with words. He cannot \" space,\" as\nseveral others can. H. E.\nMr. F. C. Constable comments on this case as follows\nF. B. on counting backwards from 100 made a mistake at 56\nhe jumped to 45, \"and then began to laugh and talk about the\nmistake he had made.\" He was evidently counting with normal\nconsciousness. And at the same time that he made the above error\nhe also made an error in writing down 3589 instead of 5789.\nI hold the coincidence in time of these two errors is of great\nimportance : I deny chance coincidence. There was operation of\n\fNov., 1909. Reminiscent Crystal Visions. 153\nF. B.'s understanding both in counting and in writing : the one\nerror is related to the other .... and both imported a form of\nconscious operation of the understanding. . . .\nIt appears to me that the abnormality of the case lies only in\nthis : that one and the same understanding was carrying on at the\nsame time a double operation (that of counting and writing), whereas\nnormally the understanding can carry on but one operation. Through\nthe inriuence of hypnotism, the understanding of F. B. was doing\nmore than it normally could do.\nIf this be so, we must refer the double operation of counting and\nmultiplying .... not to two distinct forms (supraliminal and sub-\nliminal) uf consciousness, but to one form : he was consciously\ncarrying on two operations of his understanding\u2014just as Julius\nCaesar is said to have been able to read one subject and dictate\nanother, or Lord Brougham to listen to a legal argument and\nwrite a treatise on mathematics at the same time\nHerein we find, as with H. E.'s previous experiments, evidence\nthat hypnotism affected F. B.'s understanding in no way directly :\nit only so affected the environments of his understanding that he could\ndo what ordinarily he could not do. There was already latent\npower in F. B. to count by words and multiply by his hand : hyp-\nnotism rendered this latent power potent in action by freeing his\nunderstanding from those environments which normally prevented\nhis carrying on the double operation.\nJanuary 25th, 1909.\nNo. 5.\nJ. M., aged 21, carpenter, of good average ability. Good hypnotic\nsubject, and good at crystal vision.\nJan. 22, 1909, 11 o'clock a.m. Sees in crystal a man in white\napron kicking a boy. Thinks boy is a grocer's assistant. Can't see\nfaces plainly. Man takes boy by the arm and kicks him again.\nSays he does not know either boy or man. Thinks it is inside a\nshop, but is not sure. Vision fades.\nOn questioning J. M. he cannot remember ever having seen this.\nI should state that I consider he has a bad ordinary memory, and\na fairly bad memory when in the hypnotic trance, i.e. bad compared\nwith the ordinary run of subjects in this state. On being hypnotised\nand asked where the scene took place, he replies at once that it was\nfive years ago when he was working with another boy\u2014W. Q.,\nunder a carpenter named E. C. The boy and he had each made a\n\f154 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.\nwheelbarrow. The carpenter, E. C, found fault with W. Q., \"and\nhe gave him cheek, so he put his boot into him, and kicked him\nover the barrow.\" Asked what made him see this picture, he\nanswered :\n\" I was pushing a barrow this morning.\"\nFurther asked 'what this had to do with it,' he replied: \"I\nthought of the new one I was making, as I was pushing the barrow.\"\nAwake. J. M. says he remembers clearly thinking of the new\nbarrow he is making, and noticing the way the one was made that\nhe was pushing, but feels sure he never thought of W. Q. or of the\nkicking affair.\nIt seems to me fairly obvious that the barrow J. M. was pushing\nsuggested the barrow he is making. His mind was idle probably,\nas he was going along the road, and the incident about W. Q. rose\nat least as far as his sub-conscious memory, being suggested by\nbarrow-makins;.\nNo. 6.\nJ. M., date, time, etc., as above.\nSees in crystal a man hanging from a beam in a room, by his\nneck\u2014small table upset on floor below him. Man about 70 years\nof age. Light tweed coat, dark trousers. Rope fastened to hook in\nold-fashioned whitewashed beam. Kope double. Face is to right.\nVision fades.\nJ. M. remembers this incident thoroughly. It haj^pened at S. in\nthe Midlands, on Easter Monday 1907. He was called into the\nhouse, together with the man with whom he was lodging, to cut the\nman down. The house was opposite the one in which he lodged,\nwhere this took place.\nThe question now was, \u2014what made him see this very unpleasant\nvision 1 There was no need to find out further details as to what\nthe vision was, as he could naturally describe such an afl'air\nthoroughly.\nOn being hypnotised, and the question being asked, he replied\n\"I saw them hanging up a pig [on Jan. 18th] that was just killed,\na day or two ago.\" \"Did you think of this man when you saw\nthat?\" \"No, not that I know of.\" \"If you saw that, a day or two\nago, why do you see it to-day in the crystal\n?\n\" \"I saw a postcard\nto-day with a pig on it.\"\nAfter waking, J. M. told me that while driving a cart with a\nhorse that went very slowly through the village of 0. on Monday\nlast, he saw a newly killed pig hung up to the roof of a shed that\n\fNov., 1909. Reminiscent Crystal Visions. 155\nopened on to the road. He merely looked at it as the horse went\nslowly by. As far as he knows, he never thought of the suicide\nat all.\nThis morning i.e. Jan. 22, about half an hour before these ex-\nperiments\u2014he called at B.'s house, and was shown a postcard, .sent\nfor a joke, showing a pig Avithout its head. Is quite sure he did\nnot think of the pig he saw hung up at 0.\nThe chain of memory is again obvious. The postcard pig suggests\nthe dead pig at 0, and this in turn suggests tlie suicide at S.\nBut these two cases seem to have a further interest. After J. M.\nhad seen Vision 5, I took the crystal away and wrote the notes\nof the experiment. This took rather less than 10 minutes. I then\nhanded J. M. the crystal again. He immediately saw the No. 6\nvision. Why does this one follow the other? The wheelbarrow in\nNo. 6 that he was pushing he stopped outside B.'s house and\nwent in. Here he took the postcard into his hands and examined\nit. After staying there a little while, he went back to the barrow\nand took it to its destination, and then came on to me for experi-\nments. Again the chain is fairly obvious. H. E.\nCASE.\nL. 1178. Dream.\nThe following case was sent to Mrs. Sidgwick by a corre-\nspondent, Mrs. Arnold Shavp, who is acquainted with all the\npersons concerned. We are requested to print their initials\nonly, but the full names and addresses have been given to us.\nThe percipient, Miss G. writes\nDecember I9th, 1908.\nI dreamt my married friend Mrs. L. came with her sister to me\nin my room, in motor costume, in great distress. The scene seemed\nto change to her morning room, and she and her sister were in\na very distressed state of mind, because her husband and a friend\nhad left her, or gone away\u2014that part was very vague\u2014but she\nwas so upset, and it impressed me so much, and it was all so\nvivid. I telephoned first thing in the morning to see if anything\nwas wrong, but did not hear anything, as she was not then up\nin the afternoon I heard that her husband and a friend had gone\nout for an hoar's run on the motor. It had broken down, and\nthey had not returned till 2 a.m. in the morning, and could get\nto nowhere to communicate with the wife. She meanwhile was\n\f156 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.\nin an awful state of mind, and she has told me since that she\nthought several times of telephoning to me, only the lateness of the\nhour prevented her ; and she longed for me to be there.\nG. G.\nThe following are questions asked by Mrs. Sidgwick, to\nwhich Miss G.'s answers are appended\n1. What was the date of the dream?\nJust before Xmas, 1907.\n2. Does the dreamer often have vivid dreams ?\nNot specially.\n3. Has she on any other occasion had a dream which has so im-\npressed her that she has taken steps afterwards to find\nout if anything corresponding to the dream had happened ?\nNo.\n4. Has she ever attached any significance to a dream l>efore 1\nNo.\n5. Does she often dream of Mrs. L. 1\nNo. \u2022\nMrs. L.'s account, obtained independently of Miss G.'s, was\nreceived by Mrs. Sidgwick on January 9th, 1909, and is as\nfollows :\n... On Sunday, December 22nd, 1907, my husband and I had intended\nhaving a quiet day at home, when in the afternoon my brother-in-\nlaw unexpectedly arrived with a light-powered car which he had\nbought not long before, and which he wanted my husband to try.\nLater on, though it was now dark, they decided to go for a run,\nand arranged to call at . . . the home of my husband's sister, Mrs.\nB. A friend, H. N., went with them.\nMy husband said he would be home by 8 o'clock, and as he keeps\nhis word, I knew he would do his best to be back at that time.\nHowever, at 8 o'clock they did not return, and at a few minutes\npast, Mrs. B. telephoned to say that they were staying supper,\nbut would leave 9 o'clock certain. She also said that the car had\nbeen running badly and that it would give the chauffeur time to\nput the engine in order. They would be home 10 o'clock by the\nlatest.\nI seldom feel nervous, but in this case I knew the car was\nnot in really safe running order. When 11 o'clock, then 12 o'clock\ncame, and still they did not return, I at last felt certain that\n\fNov., 1909. Case. 157\nsomething sei-ious must have happened. In spite of myself my\nmind was filled with accidents and horrors. I was quite alone,\nhaving sent the maids to bed long before, and every moment I\nfelt more frightened and helpless. I knew that something ought\nto be done, that somebody ought to go after them. They might\nall be lying badly injured on the road.\nI did not dare to ring up Mrs. B. or my own people, who live\nsome miles away. It would probably have been worse than useless.\nI began to long for some one to be there with me, and while won-\ndering to myself which of my friends I would rather have, my\nmind decided for me upon my friend G. G. As the time w^ent on,\nmy suspense became more and more unbearable, the silence of it all\nseemed dreadful.\nBetween 12 and 1 o'clock, I several times almost decided to go\nover to the house of our own chauffeur (about ten minutes' walk away)\nwake him up, and tell him to get the car out for me to go and\nfind them. Over and over again I felt that I must rush upstairs\nand put on a motoring veil and cap, and find my big coat. Then\nI was afraid that all the village street would hear the alarm if I\nwent knocking loudly for the chauffeur. I also thought of callino-\nup the maids to go to [the chauffeur's house]. However, soon after\n1.30 I was suddenly surprised to hear some one walking up the drive,\nand, on rushing to the door, I was overjoyed to see my husband\nand the rest safe and sound, but absolutely tired out.\nThe engine had broken down miles away, and after trying for\nsome time to mend it up temporarily, but without success, they had\npushed the car inside somebody's drive gate for safety and had\nwalked all the way home.\nNext morning between 9 and 10 o'clock, G. G. telephoned to me.\nShe asked how I was, and my maid who answered the ring replied\nthat I was \"much better,\" merely thinking that G. G. was referrino\"\nto a bad cold that I had been suffering from the week before.\nIt was not until later in the day that G. G. met some of H. N.'s\npeople and heard what had happened.\nSoon after that she told me her side of the experience, all about\nher painfully vivid dream, and I have no shadow of a doubt that\nshe went through very anxious hours with me, and that her\nthoughts were parallel with mine all through the time of dreadful\nsuspense.\nE. L. L.\n\f158 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.\nH. K's sister, Miss M. N., writes as follows\nJanuary \\Qth, 1909.\nMiss G. came to see us the Monday before Christmas, 1907,\nand told us about a dream she had had the nia;ht before. The details\nof the dream, as far as I can vememl)er, were that Mrs. L. had come\nto her in great distress saying her husband had gone away and had\nnot come back. She also said that my brother had had something to\ndo with it. Miss G. also said that the dream so affected her,\nthat as soon as she came down in the morning, she had telephoned\nto Mrs. L. to see if she was all right, but was not able to speak\nto her.\nWe rather laughed at her taking any notice of a dream and\nthought no more about it until my brother (who had been away for\nthe week-end), came in at mid-day and told us that on the Sunday\nafternoon, he, Mr. L., and others had started for a motor ride,\nMr. L. telling his wife that he should not be away long ; he\nexpected to be back about 7 o'clock. All went well till they were\ncoming back, when about twelve miles away from home something\nwent wrong with the car, and after vainly trying to put it right,\nthey started to walk home, and did not arrive till about 2 o'clock\nin the morning, finding Mrs. L. naturally in a great state of\nalarm. During Monday afternoon I happened to meet Miss G.\nand told her of the accident, and we remarked that it must account\nfor her dream, as Mrs. L. must have been worrying just about\nthe time she was dreaming of her. I heard later on that Mrs.\nL. was actually intending to telephone to Miss G. to ask her\nwhat to do, if they hadn't turned up when they did. This is, as\nnear as I can remember, all that occurred.\nM. N.\nOBITUARY.\nProfessor Cesare Lombroso.\n[We regret to have to record the death of Professor Cesare\nLombroso, for twenty years a Corresponding Member of our\nSociety, who died of heart failure at Turin on October 19th, after\na few days' illness. The following notice is quoted, with the\npermission of the Editor, from the British Medical Journal :]\nProfessor Lombroso was born at Verona in 183-5, studied medicine\nat Padua, and afterwards at Vienna, where he came especially under\nthe influence of Skoda. He graduated at Padua in 1856. He served\n\fNov., 1909. Obituary. 159\nas a surgeon in the Austro-Italian war, which broke out in 1859. Some\nyears later he was appointed Professor of Psychiatry in the University\nof Pavia. One of his earliest works was a volume of researches on\ncretinism, which was published in 1S58. He made original observations\non pellagra, the results of which were embodied in a monograph\npublished in 1872. He followed this up with a memoir on the poisons\nof maize. 1\nLater he was appointed to the chair of psychiatry in the University\nof Turin. From the beffinnin<r of his teachini!' career he had been\ninterested in the relations of nervous disease and crime, and he pursued\nhis researches and observations at Turin. These were published in his\nwell-known work, L' Uomo Delinquente, which appeared in 1889. After-\nwards he applied himself to the study of genius, which he held to be a\nform of nervous disease. He became celebrated as the founder of a\nschool of criminal anthropology, the doctrines of which were pushed by\nsome of his disciples to extreme consec|uences that brought his teaching\ninto undeserved derision. He was a shrewd observer, and a most\nindustrious collector of facts from all sources j but his notions of\nevidence were very loose, and he lacked the power of presenting his\nviews in logical order. But to him belongs the credit of being a pioneer\nin a new region of scientific thought, and though much of his work was\nfantastic and inaccurate, he gave a stimulus to other investigators, which\nwill probably lead to fruitful results. Of him it might, we think, be\nsaid, as it was said of the old Spanish exploder of popular superstitions\n\u2014Feyjoo, that a statue should be raised to him, at the foot of which his\nown writings should be burnt.\nTHE SIXTH INTEENATIONAL CONGEESS OF\nPSYCHOLOGY.\nThe sixth International Congress of Psychology was held at\nGeneva from August 3rd to August 7th under the presidency of\nProfessor Th. Flournoy. The number of members was very\nlarge, though but few came from this country.

It was resolved that the\nnext congress should be held in the United States in the year\n1913. From the point of view^ of the S.P.E. the most\nimportant feature of the Congress was perhaps the reading of\na paper by Dr. Sidney Alrutz, in which he described experiments\non the production of movements of a registering apparatus (some-\nwhat on the lines of Sir Wm. Crookes's well-known experiments\nwith Home) in mechanically inexplicable fashion. The experiments\nseem to have been successful with several private mediums. The\npaper was well received, and it was noticeable that the tone of\nthe Congress seemed favourable to \" psychical research.\" There\nwas an important discussion on \" subconsciousness,\" in the course\nof which Dr. Morton Prince gave some account of a new case\nsimilar to, but, if possible, even more interesting than the one he\nhas made so widely known.

I\npicture the process as follows :\n\u2014The bell-wires collect atmos-\npheric electricity, by induction or otherwise, which the walls\nare insufficiently conducting to carry off freely ;\nconsequently\nthe bells get charged, are attracted to a neighbouring wall or\npipe and released suddenly by a spark.

Correspondence. IGl\nCORRESPONDENCE.\nOn Prof. Pigou's Criticism of Cross-Correspondences.\nI.\nIn the last issue of the Journal Sir Oliver Lodge prints a short\ncomment on my criticism of cross-correspondences in the recent\nProceedings. I should like to be allowed a few words of rejoinder\nor perhaps it would be better to say of explanation, because, if I\ncould accept Sir Oliver Lodge's interpretation of my argument, I\nshould also endorse his criticism. I did not maintain that \"just\nas the former {i.e. the Verrall script) originated wholly in sub-\nliminal activities, so also the latter (Myers) script, must probably\nhave originated so likewise.\" This, of course, would be invalid,\nfor, as Sir Oliver Lodge rightly points out, the Verrall script did\nnot originate in subliminal activities, but in Dr. Verrall's conscious\npurpose. The argument which I intended to state, and which,\nperhaps from an author's natural prejudice, I cannot help believing\nthat I did state, was more complicated. From the Verrall script\nI inferred, not that a complementary correspondence, but. that the com-\nplementary element in a complementary correspondence, can originate in\nsubliminal activity. This seems to me to be correct, since it is\nclear that the complementary relation between Mrs. Verrall's different\nscripts formed no part of Dr. Verrall's intention. On the basis\nof this inference I argued that a complementary correspondence\nafifords no more evidence of non-subliminal agency than is afforded\nby a simple correspondence. If this be so, the evidential value, not\nof complementary correspondences, but of the complementary element\nin complementary correspondences, is destroyed ; and we have\nmerely to consider whether the appearance of simple correspondences\nmakes probable the activity of dis-carnate intelligences. My negative\nanswer to this second question was based, not on the Verrall script,\nbut on the experiments of Miss Ramsden and Miss Miles discussed\non p. 293 of my paper ; and it was supported by reference to Miss\nJohnson's opinion which I quote on the succeeding page.\nA. C. PiGOU.\nII.\nI am glad to understand more clearly the precise meaning of\nProfessor Pigou, and I think that other readers of the Proceedings\nmay be similarly assisted by his present communication. The\n\f162 Journal of Society for PsychAcal Research.. Nov., 1909.\nadvantage of these friendly discussions is that they tend to elucidate\nlittle intricacies in what is virtually a new kind of study.\nThe Editor of the Journal has suggested to me that it is probably\nnecessary to discriminate between \"accidental fragments\" and \"com-\nplementary factors.\" The disjecta membra of a really good cross-\ncorrespondence are complementary rather than fragmentar}', and\ntheir separation exhibits signs of purpose. At least that is what\nthe evidence seems to point to, though that may be a matter for\ndiscussion. But the fragments of the \" One horse dawn \" episode\nare nothing more than fragmentary, and their separation, as Professor\nPigou remarks, seems to be unavoidable rather than intended. The\nincident would probably have been given as a whole, had it been\npossible. There was no advantage in breaking it up, since it all\ncame through one person. But in the case of a cross-correspondence\nbetween different autoniatists there is every advantage, from the\nevidential point of view, in breaking the communication up into\ncomplementary portions which are separately unintelligible.\nIf it be true that the accidentally fragmentary and the purposive\ncomplementary can be discriminated ; and if the discrimination is\napplicable, as I have tentatively suggested, say to the \" One horse\ndawn\" case on the one hand, and the \"Browning Hope and Star\"\ncase on the other; then there is a distinction (which, when answering\nProfessor Pigou before, I confess I had not noticed) between the\ntwo cases to which he refers.\nIf the distinction thus suggested is real, then the absence of\nintention in producing the \" fragments \" of the one case does not\nprove, and need not necessarily imply, the absence of intention in\nproducing the \"complements\" in the other.\nThe question can, however, only be settled by a careful study\nand analysis of the characteristics of a number of cases ; and further\nmaterial for this will, I hope, be afforded before long by the later\nscripts of Mrs. Piper, Mrs. and Miss Verrall, and Mrs. Holland,\nreports on which are now being prepared for publication.\nOliver Lodge.\nREVIEW.\nThe Religious Attitude ami Life in Islam, being the Haskell Lectures on\nComparative Beligion, 11)06. By D. B. Macdonald, M.A., B D.\nChicago University Press, 1909. Post 8vo, pp. 317.\nThese lectures, ten in number, are, to quote the author's preface,\n\"an attempt to outline the religious attitude and life of Muslims,\n\fNov., 1909. Revieiv. 3 63\nas opposed to the systematic theology of Islam.\" The authorities\nchiefly relied upon are Ibn Khaldun, \" part statesman, part scholar,\npart lawyer,\" who died at Cairo in 140G, and al-Ghazzali, who died\nin 1111 ; and lengthy extracts from the works of these two Avriters\nform a considerable portion of the volume.\nMr. Macdonald's book is primarily a study in comparative religion,\nand it is a valuable contribution to the literature on that subject\nbut the reader soon discovers, not without surprise, that its contents\nare calculated to appeal to those interested in such matters as the\nS.P.E. exists to investigate, no less than to the student of religions.\nThis will be seen at once from an enumeration of some of the\nsubjects of Muslim belief discussed by the Arabic authors. The Muslim\nbelieves that the veil which separates him from the unseen world,\nin which dwells the Almighty, and which is peopled by angels and\nspirits {Jinn), good and evil, is of the very thinnest, and that it can\nbe, and often is, pierced by man. All men may hold communion\nwith God through prayer and meditation, but to some it is given\nto have intercourse with the spirit-world by other means also. The\nsoul of the prophet passes through the veil in his trance, and\nreceives the revelation of the divine will from messengers of the\nAll-Hol}-. The Kahin, who is both poet and soothsayer (rates),\nreceives his inspirations in a similar manner. Wizardry and magic\n(the phenomena of which include telekinesis), and 'scrying' with\nmirrors, bowls of water, and other media, are practised, and are\nfeatures of the religious life. In these practices, as also in\ndivination by dreams and through the insane ('possession' and\n'\nautomatic speech ') the Muslim believes the phenomena to be pro-\nduced, or at least their production assisted, by denizens of the\nspirit-world, some good, some evil, with whom he has brought him-\nself into touch. Such, among others, are the subjects dealt with at\nlength by Ibn Khaldun and al-Ghazzali, and it is clear from their\nwritings that they are part of the very marrow of the Muslim\nfaith. Mr. Macdonald states an obvious truth, therefore, when he\nsays, \"It was necessary, in the search for interpretative analogies, to\nturn, not to our metaphysical systems or to our religious philosophy,\nbut rather to what we call commonly, in jest or earnest, the\noccult. These analogies, therefore, had to be sought chiefly in the\nProceedings of the Society\/ for Psychical Research and similar publi-\ncations. The case of Muhammad himself, for example, can be\nindefinitely more completely illustrated and explained by the\nphenomena of so-called trance-mediumship than by any other\n\f164 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1909.\nhypothesis.\" He goes on to add, \"And it is noteworthy, further,\nthat the theory of veridical hallucinations worked out by Gurney\nand Myers is essentially that of al-Ghazzali and Ibn Khaldun.\"\nThe following is a quotation from Il)n Khaldun ; he declares that\nhe has seen \"another body\" influenced in the way he describes.\n\"The philosophers distinguish between magic and tab'smans, but\nthey lay it down that both together are due to an influence be-\nlonging to the human soul. They give as a proof of this influence\nhow the soul afl'ects the body apart from the ordinary operations\nof nature or physical causes\u2014nay, there are effects which arise\nfrom spiritual conditions, such as heat caused by joy, or from\nideas, such as those which result from fear. One who is walking\nupon the edge of a wall, or upon a tight-rope, when fear of falling\ncomes strongly upon him, will most certainly fall. Only by long\npractice can the fear of falling be removed, and then such walk\nsafely. If, then, the soul has this influence upon its own body,\nwithout physical natural causes, it is probable that it can have a\nsimilar infliuence upon another body, since its relationship to\nbodies in this kind of influence is one ; for it is not enfolded in\nthe body or shut up in it. So it follows that it can exert an\ninfluence upon all material objects.\"\nMr. Macdonald's comment is, \"This, you will notice, is precisely\nthe theory which lies behind the '\nmental science ' and '\nChristian\nscience ' of our own day. It is also practically involved in the\ninfinitely more scientific '\nmetapsychical,' to use Dr. Maxwell's word,^\ninvestigations which are now going on. There lies in it an indubit-\nable element of truth.\"\nMr. Macdonald's work shows that he is thoroughly at home with\nhis subject ; his exposition is clear, and his comments lively and\ninforming.

Dec, 1909.\nADDITIONAL INFOEMATION ABOUT CASE G. 283.\nThe Jotmial for May, 1908 (pp. 228-234), contains an\naccount, which had previously been read by Professor Barrett\nat a private meeting of the Society held on March 30th,\n1908, of an apparition seen shortly after the death of the\nperson represented by it. The percipient. Miss \" Minnie\nWilson,\" being at the time in a convent school in Belgium,\nstated that she saw^ on June 1st, 1907, an apparition of her\ngodfather, \" Captain Oldham,\" who informed her that he had\ntaken his own life because a lady had refused to marry him.\nA few days later she heard from her mother that he had\ndied suddenly on May 29th, 1907, and, on coming home on\nAug. 6 th, asked her mother if the information given her by\nthe apparition was correct, and learnt that it was so.\nWhen the case was printed. Professor Barrett had had no\nopportunity of making enquiries at the Convent or of obtaining\nfrom there tlie corroborative evidence which was required to\ncomplete the ease. Eecently an Associate of the Society, Miss\nF. M. Charlton, at Professor Ban-ett's request, kindly imdertook\nto visit Belgium and caiTy out these enquiries, for which\npurpose he put all the documents into her hands.\nMiss Charlton spent several days in the neighbourhood of\nthe Convent and found the nuns, whom she visited daily, ready\nand willing to give her all possible help in her enquiries even\ninto the most minute details. Unfortunately, however, very\nlittle corroboration was obtainable, and some distinct inaccuracies\nin the details of Miss Wilson's account revealed themselves.\n(1) Prom some letters written by Mrs. Wilson in September,\n1907, it appears that her daughter told her she had been in\nthe church with a nun named Mere Paule when she saw\nthe apparition, and that she told Mere Paule about it in\nconfidence, but did not tell her the subsequent news, received\nfrom her mother, of Captain Oldham's death. Writing on\nFebruary 20th, 1908, Mrs. Wilson says that her daughter\n\" only confided in old Mere Columba . . . and after my letter\narrived, said :\n'\nYou see. Mere, he is dead.' \" On the dis-\ncrepancy being pointed out, Mrs. Wilson writes (March 15th,\n1908): \"It was a clerical error on my part using Mere\n\fDec, 1909. Additional Information ahoid Case G. 283. 167\nPaule's name instead of Mere Columba's,\" and Miss Wilson,\nin her own narrative (printed in the Journal for May, 1908,\np. 232), says that she was with Mere Cohimba in the church\nwhen she saw the apparition, and that she told her about it.\nMiss Charlton has ascertained that Mere Columba could not\nhave been in the church, as she was bed-ridden at the time\nit was probably Mere Paule who was there, she being the\nsacristan. Mere Paule, however, denies that Miss Wilson ever\ntold her anything about the apparition (see statements below),\nand Mere Columba having died since, no confirmation can be\nobtained from her of Miss Wilson's statement that she told her\nof it.\n(2) The original account says that Miss Wilson first saw\none of her school friends, whom she knew to be away at the\ntime, coming towards her in nun's dress, and that this young\nnun led her in her vision through the Nuns' Eefectory, where\nno one of the girls is allowed to go, and thence into their\nprivate chapel, where she saw the apparition of her godfather\nand that on her way through the refectory she saw a curious\npicture which she had never seen before. It appeared to have\npieces of red tape hanging from a figure in it. She stated\nthat it was the custom for the girls who got prizes to go\ninto the refectory to receive them at the end of their last\nterm at school, and that when she went there, two months\nafter the vision, she recognised this picture\u2014the picture of a\nsaint dripping with blood\u2014on the wall.\nMiss Charlton has, however, found that the picture in ques-\ntion is not in the refectory, but in the nuns' Chapter-Koom\nthat the girls never under any circumstances go into the\nrefectory, but some of the older girls are admitted once a\nyear to the Chapter-Eoom to walk in a procession that takes\nplace there on March 19th, and it appears that Miss Wilson\nhad been there on March 19th, 1907, and therefore had\nhad every opportunity of seeing the picture several weeks\nbefore the date of her vision.\nThese somewhat serious vaguenesses and inaccuracies in\nMiss Wilson's account show that her memory is not altogether\nto be relied on, and it is the more unfortunate that no con-\nfirmation is now obtainable of her having mentioned the vision\nat the time of its occurrence and before Captain Oldham's\n\f168 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. Dec.,1909.\ndeath was known to her. We cannot, of course, doubt that\nshe had some unusual experience, nor that the news of his\ndeath greatly affected her, nor that she saw visions of him.\nAnd that she spoke of her experience to Mere Columba seems\nprobable, both from her own recollection and from what Mere\nColumba's sister says (see below). But evidentially the important\nquestion is whether the first of the series of visions occurred\nbefore she had heard of the death ; and this is a point on\nwhich, during the weeks when the vision was recurring, her\nmemory might easily have become confused.\nEven supposing, however, that no apparition was seen until\nafter Miss Wilsoia had heard of the death, the important fact\nremains that, as testified to by Mrs. Wilson, she asked her\nmother on first coniing home whether it was not true that\nher godfather had committed suicide because a lady liad\nrefused to marry him, which facts her mother had taken\nparticular pains to conceal from her.\nMrs. Wilson's first and most explicit statement on this\npoint, in a letter dated September 4th, 1907, is: \"It was\nmy earnest desire that [Minnie] should never know the cir-\ncumstances under which her Uncle \u2022\n(as she always\ncalled him) met his death, so I never mentioned anything\nabout him till the Tuesday following, in my usual weekly\nletter. My few words were :\n'\nI have very sad news for\nyou ! Poor Uncle died suddenly on Wednesday and\nwas buried on Saturday.'\nIn estimating the evidence it must not be overlooked that\nin some cases the very reticence as to the cause of death\nmight lead to a correct inference ; but whether this could have\noccurred in the present case, it is now impossible to say.\nIn sending her report of the case, Miss Charlton writes\nWith every intention, evidently, of telHng the truth, Minnie does\nnot seem to have had a good memory, or even to have been very\nobservant of facts at the time. She confounded Mere Paule with\nMere Columba, and the Nuns' Refectory with their Chapter Room.\nShe did not even know the surname of one of her friends, and\nspoke of the elder girls receiving prizes in the Nuns' Refectory,\nwhen the incident referred to was really a procession in the Chapter\nRoom. She said that the girls of different nationalities were kept\n\fDec, 1909. Additional Infovmation about Case '288. 169\napart, whereas nothing separates them but the fact that at first\nthe Flemish girls cannot understand the English language, and,\nas a matter of fact, it seems that one of the Belgian girls was\nthe recipient of [Minnie's] confidences [on another subject] before\nshe left.\nBut the gravest inaccuracy in her account and that which most\nseriously affects the evidence is the statement that she had not seen\nthe picture Avith the \"red tape\" before her vision, Avhereas it is\ncertain that she had seen it beforehand. It is also disappointing\nthat we have not been able to get an explanation of the fact that\nshe first said that Mere Paule had been with her when she saw the\napparition ; but after the case had begun to be investigated and\nMere Columba had died, shifted her statement and said it was Mere\nColumba who had been with her, whereas Mere Columba, who was\nher class-mistress, had been bed-ridden and away from her class for\nfive months, and had never been accustomed to dust the church at\nany time.\nI think that the notion that she had become acquainted with her\ngodfather's suicide and the reason for it through the ordinary\nchannels of knowledge, cannot be entertained for a moment. The\ngirls never see any newspapers, and no one in the Convent seems\nto have known even of her friend's existence.\nThe signed statements of the nuns, obtained by Miss\nCliarlton, are as follows :\nStatement of Mere Paule.\n'\n\u2022\nApril 29\/\/i, 1909.\nI recognize this photograph brought by Miss Charlton as being a\nlikeness of [Minnie Wilson], whom I knew well when she was at\nschool here. 1 am the Sacristan, and she frequently assisted me in\ndusting the statues in the Church, and very probably did so on the\nmorning of June 1st, 1907, though I have nothing to mark the\ndate in my mind, for I am positive that [Minnie] never confided\nthe extraordinary experience in question to me.

I am con-\nvinced in my own mind, from certain indications, that [Minnie] did\nconfide something mysterious to my sister. I knew [Minnie Wilson]\nvery well myself. She was a very thoughtful girl, and used often\nto go of her own accord in the evening to the Nuns' Chapel to\nfollow the Stations of the Cross by herself.\nI recognize the remarks which [Minnie] states Mere Columba\nmade when she told her of her vision as being characteristic of\nmy sister.\nWith regard to the girl called \"Marie\" I have made careful\ninquiries, and find that none of [Minnie's] companions of that name\nwho subsequently became Nuns left until Easter, 1907, when Marie\nleft, returning in Sept., 1907, when she and two other\n\"Maries\" took the Postulant's cap and became Novices in Nov.\nThey all knew [Minnie], but none of them connects her with any\npsychic experience. One of them, Marie , was an intimate\nfriend of hers, and helped her to pack before she left. [Minnie] at\nthat time told her how anxious she was to come back. . . . She was\nof course aware all along of her friend's intention to enter religion,\nand must certainly have known about the two other Maries as well.\nMere M.

[Minnie's] statement that before leaving\nschool she was taken into the Nuns' Refectory for the first time,\nand there recognized the picture of her vision, is manifestly\nincorrect. She could never have been inside the Nuns' Refectory\nat any time, and moreover there is no picture there which at\nall corresponds to the one she describes ; but it is a very good\nimpressionist description of an extremely badly painted attempt\nto represent St. Francis of Assisi receiving the stigmata, which\nhangs just inside the door of the Chapter-room. Into that room some\nof the older girls are admitted, as a reward for their good behaviour,\nonce a year, to walk in a procession. This takes place at 7 o'clock\non the evening of March 19 (the Feast of St. Joseph), and that is\nthe only occasion when [Minnie] could have been inside that room,\ni.e. March 19, 1907, and she was certainly present on that occasion.\n\fDec, 1TO9. Additional Information about Case 283. in\nIt may be worth while to mention a fact which was first recalled\nto me by Mere Anastasie in Miss Charlton's presence, i.e. that on\nthe evening of May 31, 1907 (the night before the vision), the\nFeast of St. Angela was celebrated by the girls acting in a play\nwhich was founded on her life, and that several of [Minnie's]\nschool companions were acting in it dressed up as Nuns.\nM^RE M. Ambroisine.\nIn regard to these statements Miss Charlton adds\nMere Anastasie, who signs second, is teacher of Music and\nArithmetic. She was in Johannesburg all through the Boer War,\nbut her martial experiences have left her extremely gentle and\nuninsistent in her opinions, excepting where the question of truth\nis concerned, about which she is remarkably scrupulous. I had to\nwrite her statement over again, because she thought I had not\ngiven quite the proper shade of value to a quite unimportant\nmatter. I never have known any one weigh her words so much, and\nthis I think is important in view of her having said that she was\nconvinced in her own mind that [Minnie] had spoken to her sister\nMere Columba about the apparition. When we all five had made\nup our minds that [Minnie] must have been right when she said\nit was to Mere Columba to whom she had confided her secret,\nMere Anastasie said: \"That accounts for the curious expression that\nalways came over my sister's face whenever I spoke to her of\n[Minnie Wilson] !\n\" . . . I questioned her afterwards about it, and she\nsaid with the utmost earnestness :\n\" Yes, indeed, Miss Charlton, it\nis true. I always used to notice such an odd smile on Mere\nColumba's face whenever I talked to her about [Minnie], a kind\nof\u2014not exactly mocking, but a sceptical smile. I never could under-\nstand what it meant, but as soon as I heard this story it flashed\nupon me ; but I hope the Society won't imagine from this that\nmy sister couldn't keep a secret, for her smile conveyed absolutely\nnothing to me until I heard all this, when I understood it.\"\nThis I am confident is the exact truth, and I think we may feel\nquite satisfied that [Minnie] was correct when she said it was to\nMere Columba she had confided her experience.\nMere Ambroisine's final statement, that the evening before [Minnie]\nsaw, in her trancs condition, her former school companion, dressed as\na Nun, she was looking on at or taking part in a play in which\nsome of her school companions were dressed up as Nuns, seems to\nnie of considerable importance.\n\f172 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.\nI was taken all over that part of the Convent represente 1 in the\nsketch,^ and have traced with black ink the way that [Minnie] must\nhave gone on March 19th, 1907, when she walked in a procession\nwhich formed up in the schools and terminated in the Chapter-\nroom. The girls marched through the door, and deposited their\nbanners against the opposite wall, when they would naturally face\nround and have the picture of St. Francis receiving the Stigmata\nright before them. This picture represents a small crucifix floating\nsideways in the air, with straight lines which look exactly like red\ntape proceeding from the hands, feet, and side, and striking the\nSaint, who is kneeling at some distance off. It is an extremely ill-\npainted and grotesque picture, and one that no one would be likely\never to forget. ... . Frances M. Charlton.\nMiss Charlton sends us a small water-colour copy of the oil\npainting referred to, which bears out precisely the description\nshe has given. The red lines proceeding from the crucifix to the\nSaint are a very conspicuous feature in it. She adds that she\nhas received a later letter from Mere Ambroisine, in which the\nlatter mentioned a second occasion, namely, on May 1st, 1907,\nwhen Miss Wilson is known to have been inside the Chapter-\nroom, where the picture hangs.\nTHE EEPOET ON EUSAPIA PALLADINO.\n1.\nI HAVE read with extreme interest the Eeport of the Com-\nmittee appointed to investigate the phenomena presented by\nEusapia Palladino. My first impression, some weeks back,\nafter reading the Eeport and a great part of the evidence, was\nthat now at last we had the issue fairly and squarely pre-\nsented\u2014that we had in fact, as the Committee themselves\nput it, to choose between the alternatives of a new force and\ncollective hallucination. So strong was the impression produced\non me that I wrote to Mr. Feilding (but the letter did not\nunfortunately reach him before his departure for the Congo)\nurging less cavalier treatment of the hypothesis of collective\nhallucination.\nsketch of part of the Convent was included in Miss Charlton's report,\nbut is not reproduced here.\n\fDec, 1909. The Report on Eusa-pia Palludino. 173\nA few clays ago I had occasion to make a more careful\nstudy of the evidence, and in the course of my further reading\nsome suspicions circumstances came to light, which led me to\nmake a still closer analysis. To analyse with care the whole\nmass of evidence would be an extremely laborious under-\ntaking. There are only five completely successful seances\nseances, that is, which include the whole range of phenomena,\nfrom tilts of the table to phantom heads\u2014viz. V., VI., VII.,\nVIII., and XL But at seance VIII. and XL, except for an\nunproductive hour at the beginning of seance VIII., one side\nof Eusapia was under the control of a visitor. Seances V.,\nVI., and VII. represent therefore at once the high-water mark\nof the phenomena and the best conditions of control. Through-\nout these three seances both Eusapia's hands and feet were\nunder control of the members of the Committee\u2014Mr. Feildincf,\nMr. Baggally, and Mr. Carrington. My analysis has therefore\nbeen in the main confined to these three sittings. But from\na cursory examination I see no reason to doubt that the\ncriticism made on these seances will apply mutatis mutandis\nto all the rest.\nTwo conclusions at once emerged from this closer analysis.\n(1) That Eusapia is afraid of Mr. Carrington. Twice in the\ncourse of these seances he was, by Eusapia's request, displaced\nfrom the control of the right side ; so that, in fact, save for two\nbrief and unproductive intervals at the beginning of seances\nV. and VII. respectively, he was not allowed, during these\nthree seances, to sit at Eusapia's right. (2) That at these\nthree seances, as a rule, she preferred to make use of her\nright limbs. Whether this performance is characteristic of her\nstances generally I am unable to say ; but the Committee of\nthe Institut Ghi6ml Psychologique reported that Eusapia suffered\nfrom a painful corn on her right foot, which rendered her\nintolerant of the more effective control of that foot, viz. by\nplacing it under the foot of the controller.\nAt any rate, setting aside the simpler and commoner phe-\nnomena\u2014levitation of tables, bulging of medium's dress,\nmovements of curtains, thumps and raps\u2014which are so\ndiiJicult to isolate as not in any case to afford a crucial test\n\u2014I challenge the Committee to point to a single phenomenon\n(grasp of the hand, transportation of object from cabinet, or\n\f174 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.\nappearance of head, hand, or other similar object) presented\nat these three seances which could not be explained on the\nassumption that Eusapia succeeded in\" freeing the right hand,\nor possibly, in some instances, the right foot.\nIf this be admitted\u2014and the statement can easily be\nverified\u2014it is all important to know the exact condition of\nthe control exercised on the right hand.\n(1) Throughout these three seances, whereas Eusapia's left\nhand is generally reported as lying in or being held or grasped\nby the hand of the controller on that side, the right hand as\na rule is reported as resting on or lying on, or lying under,\nthe other controller's left hand. The difference, in view of\nEusapia's known propensities for cheating by substitution of\nhands, is important.\n(2) It happens unfortunately that while the control of the\nleft hand is generally stated precisely e.g. \" left hand held in\nmy right visibly on the table \"\u2014that of the right is often\nstated in general terms, such as \" Control perfect,\" or \" Control\nas before.\" Frequently at the critical moment the statement\nis incomplete. Sometimes no statement at all is forthcoming.\n(3) On many occasions it is reported that the right-hand\ncurtain has blown out over the controller on that side so as\nto cover his head, or his hand in contact with Eusapia's right.\nThus at V. 10.57 the right-hand controller reports: \"The\ncurtain is blown over my head\"; at 10.58 \"The curtain\nis still over my hand.\" No further statement on the subject\nis made until 11.56, when Eusapia's right hand is reported\nas visible. In the meantime several phenomena had happened,\nand from certain indications it is probable that Eusapia's\nright hand was under the curtain during their progress (read\ncarefully e.g. levitation of table at 11.26 p.m.). In seance\nVI. the right-hand curtain blows out over the arm of the\n\u2022controller on that side at ll,o5. At 12.11 Eusapia places\nthe curtain between her right hand and the controller's left.\nAt 12.50 (or thereabouts) Eusapia's right hand is again under\nthe curtain\u2014but it has not been there continuously, and\nwe are not told when and how it got there again. At VII.\n11.17 the controller on the right reports: \"Her right hand\nin my left hand is under the curtain.\" There it appears to\nJiave remained throughout the transportation of the bell and the\n\fDec, 1909. The Report on Eusapia PaUadino. 175\nnext incidents\u2014and may have remained there until the close\nof the sitting, so far as we can gather from the controller's\nstatements. The controllers on Eusapia's left side were not\nonce embarrassed in this manner by the curtain during their\nthree seances.\n(4) Eusapia is reported as occasionally releasing one hand\nmomentarily and replacing it. This procedure is not reserved\nexclusively for the right hand. In seance V., for instance\n(10.44J and 11.36 p.m.), her left hand is twice released.\nBut her right hand is released more frequently and to more\npurpose (see e.g. VI. 12.4, 12.30; VII. 10.54). On each of\nthese occasions after control is renewed it is found that both\nEusapia's hands are on her knees, the right hand lying on\nthe hand of the controller on that side, the left hand held by\nthe other controller. These, of course, are Eusapia's usual\npreliminaries for substitution of hands. And on each of these\nthree occasions the release of the hand was followed, in a few\nminutes, by the appearance of a \" head \" or nondescript object\nfrom between the curtains. At VI. 11.40 (about) the release of\nthe right hand is followed as usual by a nondescript\nappearance from between the curtains, but the right hand\nis reported on the table, under the curtain.\nIf the reader wishes to verify these statements let him\nstudy closely the sequence of events in seance VII. 10.54\nto end, and let him endeavour from the record to make out\nthe exact nature of the control exercised on Eusapia's right\nhand at each point, its position, whether on the table or in\nher lap, and whether or not it was held under the curtain.\nThe defects of control, it will be found, culminated in this\nseance. So did the phenomena.\nIn the Committee's view the hypothesis of sense-deception\ncompels us to assume a concurrent and concordant hallucination\nof sight and touch on the part of two or more witnesses. The\nabove considerations suggest that, for the three most successful\ntest seances at any rate, all that we need assume is the\ndeception of a single person and a single sense\u2014and that the\nsense of touch.\nIn conclusion, let me offer an apology to the Committee.\nI am very far from imputing negligence or incompetence to\nthem. I am inclined to think that most of us would have\n\f176 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.\nfailed more conspicuously. The Eeport is valuable primarily\nbecause it is a recluctio ad absurchtm of this method of investi-\ngation. It has been tried under the most favourable conditions\nwith investigators second to none in their qualifications, whose\npractical experience is probably unrivalled, and it has failed.\nThe investigators, in short, set themselves a task which is\nalmost beyond the limit of human faculties.\nHenceforth if Eusapia will have nothing to do with smoke-\nblackened letter scales, or commutator keys and manometers\nin securely closed boxes, we had better leave her severely alone.\nFrank Podmore.\nII.\nI MAY, perhaps, be permitted at the outset to express my admira-\ntion for the form of this minute and laborious report. The most\ninsignificant details appear to be recorded, so that the reader has\nbefore him the fullest evidence possible on which to form an\nopinion.\nBut certain doubts have arisen in my mind which may be worth\nconsideration.\n(1) Why are the phenomena all of such a nature that fraud on\nthe ])art of the medium might be an explanation]\n(2) If precautions might have been taken to prevent the\npossibility of fraud, why were these precautions not\ntaken ?\nUnder the particular circumstances which existed when the\nseances were held, it is, probably, impossible to suggest precau-\ntions more stringent against fraud than those which were taken.\nThe observers were picked men, on the evidence of whose senses,\nI think, we may rely as fully as on those of our own, and the\nmeans taken at all times to control movements on the part of the\nmedium were heroic in kind.\nBut still the possibility of fraud appears to have always been\npresent in the minds of the observers, and, as I read the report,\ntheir main reliance in believing that there was no fraud, is based on\ntheir conviction that their control was so stringent that fraud was\nimpossible. That is, the phenomena themselves were not of such a\nnature that, in themselves, they removed the possibility of fraud\nit is to the certainty the observers felt that their control pre-\nvented fraud, that their belief in the abnormal nature of the\nphenomena is to be traced.\n\fDec. 1909. The Report on Eusa'pia Palladivo. 177\nTurning now to the question of precautions that might have been\ntaken to prevent fraud, let us assume that Eusapia has all the\nabnormal powers which it is alleged she has.\nIf this be so, then :\n\u2014(1) she can cause the levitation of a table\nwithout touching it ; (2) she can make objects at a distance from\nher move without physical contact ; (3) she can \u2014and this is the\nmost important fact of all \u2014make objects move when a material\ncurtain is interposed between her and the objects she causes to move.\nWhy should she not be able to make manifest all the said\nphenomena when she is tinder no human control at all, but simply\nplaced at her ease in a cage of the same material as that of the\ncurtain, the interposition of which between her and certain objects\ndid not prevent her from causing them to move?\nThe belief of Mr. Feilding, Mr. Baggally, and Mr. Hereward\nC'arrington in the abnormality of these phenomena appears to be\nbased on assurance that their control was perfect. If the experi-\nment I suggest were carried out, the question of reliance on human\ncontrol would be eliminated ; for we should have the material\ncontrol of the cage. All that would be required would be the\nsame careful observation.\nThe suggestion for the material control of the medium which I\nmake is not original : it was tirst formulated in Light} And it\nmay be there is some fundamental objection to its being carried\nout. But surely some form of material\u2014as opposed to human\ncontrol is possible 1 If not, it is to be feared we can never arrive\nat scientific proof of the objectivity of the phenomena in question ;\nfor so long as the control is human, the possibility must always\nexist that the normal senses of the observers have been deceived.\n- F. C. Constable.\n1 A similar suggestion was made when Eusapia came to Cambridge in 1895.\nIt was then proposed that a close-meshed networli should he stretched across an\nopen doorway, being fastened securely to the woodwork all the way round, and\nthat Eusapia should be placed on one side of the net, the objects to be moved\nbeing on the other side. But Eusapia refused absolutely to submit to any such\ntest. For its evidential value, it would, of course, be necessary that it should be\ncarried out in a good light. This, on the evidence, ought to be no bar to success,\nfor the Naples report states explicitly that \" it was on the nights when . . . our\nprecautions were most complete and the light the strongest that the phenomena\nwere the most numerous\" [Proceedings, Part LIX, p. 323).

Demy 8vo, pp. 344. 7s. 6d. net.\nThroughout the twenty-eight years of its existence our Society has\nbeen fortunate in having had placed at its disposal the voluntary\nservices of a series of highly trained and expert investigators, and\nalmost equally so in the fact that these volunteers have not only\nbeen gifted with great patience and astuteness in observation and\nexperiment, but quite equally so in the faculty of lucid exposition of\nthe results of their labours. The latest example of this combination\nof gifts not always found in association is before us in Sir Oliver\nLodge's recent publication The Survival (f Man.\nIt is not easy within the limits of a necessarily brief notice to\nsummarise the contents and characteristics of a work so compact as\nthis ;\none, moreover, which touches questions of physics, physiology,\nand psychology, and which will be deemed by many to have an\nimportant bearing on theology and on some of the abstruse con-\nceptions of metaphysics. The task is scarcely rendered easier by the\nfact that the reviewer finds himself in almost complete accord with\nthe author in his methods and conclusions.\nWithin the space of about 350 pages Sir Oliver Lodge presents\nto us an epitome of the evidence bearing on his subject matter which\nthe Society has been diligently collecting for a quarter of a century,\nand which is scattered over thousands of pages of its Proceedings\nand Journals, together with other evidence not, so far as I am aware,\nbefore published. This in itself will be of incalculable value to the\nmany amongst our members, who, however keen their interest, can\nscarcely find the time necessary to examine so great a mass of matter\nas appears in our publications. It is of special value to those newly\nentering upon a study of our Society's work, who, from want of\nprevious knowledge of the subject, may at times be somewhat\nmystified by the contents of articles and papers which assume an\nacquaintance with the methods pursued, and with a terminology\nunfamiliar to those who have not closely followed our investigations\nin their development. But it would be doing scant justice to Sir\nOliver's work to represent it as a mere epitome of evidence, however\nwell selected and arranged. It is far more than this. A weak,\nirresolute judge will sometimes sum up the evidence in a case for\nthe jury, throwing on them the entire responsibility of forming their\nown conclusions from a complicated mass of statements. A strong\njudge will go further and give to the jury such assistance as can be\nrendered by a trained mind and accumulated experience. Assistance\n\fDec, 1909. Review. ]79\nof this nature is given us in the work before us. There is a\nsynthesis of evidence ; there is an abundance of highly suggestive\nillustration ; and there is, further, a clear presentation of the relation\nto each other of the collected facts ; and lastly a lucid exposition of\nthe conclusion to which they seem to point.\nA olance at the Table of Contents will make this clear. Section I.\nbriefly refers to the origin and practical work of the Society.\nSection II. sets before us admirably chosen illustrations of the early\nexperiments in thought-transference and telepathy. Section III.\nsimilarly deals with spontaneous telepathy, clairvoyance and prevision\nor precognition, adding some ingenious illustrations and suggestions\nas to the possible 7nodus operandi. Telepathy being regarded as\nscientifically proved, Section IV. takes us on to the consideration of\nthe phenomena of automatism and lucidity, dealing especially with\nautomatic writing and trance speech, and containing an extended\nexamination of the Piper experiences. The chapter bearing on the\ncross-correspondences which have figured so largely in our recent\npublications will be particularly useful to those newly entering upon\na study of the subject, though, as the author points out, it is hope-\nless for any one to attempt to form an opinion on this large and\ncomplicated subject without patient study of the writings of Mr.\nPiddington, Mrs. Verrall, Miss Johnson and others, which have\nappeared in recent volumes of the Society's Proceedings.\nIt would be futile to attempt within our limits of space to\nsummarise the argument based on the evidence before us. Opinions\nwill widely differ as to the conclusions which may be rightly drawn\nfrom it. Assuming telepathy or thought-transference to be proved\nas an operative power, the question rises as to what are the limits\nof its potentiality. On this point no one is yet in a position to\nform a very definite opinion. Most students of our publications will\nno doubt concur with Sir Oliver Lodsre in regarding thought-trans-\nference as experimentally proved to this extent\u2014namely, that there\nmay often be produced \"a hazy and diflBcult recognition by one\nperson of objects kept as vividly as possible in the consciousness of\nanother person.\" But such elementary thought-transference as this\nis utterly and hopelessly insufficient to account for such phenomena\nas are presented in the automatic writings of Mrs. Piper and others,\nand especially in the cross-correspondences. Is it then scientifically\nadmissible to adduce as a true explanation of such phenomena\nhypothetical extensions of the faculty of thought-transference which\nhave not been experimentally proved 1 Materialists who are strongly\nbiassed against the supposition of The Survival of Man will doubt-\nless be disposed to press any and every such hypothesis into their\n\f180 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, 1909.\nservice. Bub some significance must be attributed to the fact that\nthe intelligences or \"controls\" through which the phenomena under\ndiscussion reach us, uniformly claim to be discarnate survivals.\nAs to the identification of such controls, it is obvious that no\ndescription of the experiments, however detailed, can be expected\nto [)roduce the same convincing effect as that which may be\nexperienced by a first-hand witness. After an exhaustive analysis\nof ;ill the facts, our author says: \"It rather feels as if we were\nat the beginning of what is practically a new branch of science\nand that to pretend to frame explanations except in the most\ntentative and elastic fashion for the purpose of threading the\nfacts together and suggesting fresh fields for experiment, is as\npremature as it would have been for Galvani to have expounded\nthe nature of electricity or Copernicus the laws of comets and\nmeteors.\" And again, \" Man's practical outlook upon the universe is\nentering upon a new phase . . . his power of reciprocal mental\nintercourse is in process of being enlarged ;. for there are signs that\nit will some day be no longer limited to contemporary denizens of\nearth, but will permit a utilisation of knowledge and powers superior\nto his own, even to the extent of ultimately attaining trustworthy\ninformation concerning other conditions of existence.\"\nAll psychical researchers will rejoice, rejoice perhaps with something\nof wonder, that Sir Oliver Lodge has found time, in the midst of\na strenuous life, to render them such service as is rendered by the\nvolume befoie us. They will eagerly look for the further help,\npromised in his Preface, to the study of what are known as the\n\"Physical phenomena\" of spiritualism.\nIt ou]y remains to say that the work is admirably got up iti the\nstyle already familiar to readers of the author's previous work, Man\nand the Uiiiverse, and that it contains a copious Index. One\nsuggestion, however, may perhaps be made; namely, that the limits\nof quotations should be more uniformly indicated by the use of\ninverted commas. Sometimes a change of type assists us ; but at\nother times, for example, in the quotation of Mrs. Verrall, commencing\non p. 337, it is not very obvious at first sight where the quotation\nends and comment begins. H_ Arthur Smith.\nNOTICE.\nIn consequence of statements that appeared in several news-\npapers about a club to be called the International Club for\nPsychical Eesearch, a number of enquiries reached us. We\ntherefore desire to make it clear that\u2014contrary to the suggestion\nconveyed by some of the newspaper paragraphs\u2014the proposed\nClub has no connection of any kind with our Society. It\nwas also stated that Professor Barrett would be the first\nPresident of the Club, but Professor Barrett informed us that\nthis statement was entirely groundless.\n\fN... CCLXV.\u2014Vol. XIV.

F. Barrett, F.R.S.\nAlthough our Society has of late devoted so much of its\ntime to the critical investigation of automatic writing and\nother evidence which points to the existence of life and\n\f184 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., i9io.\nintelligence in the Unseen, it must not be forgotten that there\nare many other branches of psychical research which need\nfuller enquiry and more abundant evidence than we possess\nat present. We still need more evidence on telepathy before\nit can be generally accepted by orthodox science, but its\ncredentials are, by most, now considered higher than those on\nbehalf of clairvoyance. And yet this should not be the case,\nfor it would not be difficult to gain the additional evidence\nwe desire if the members of our Society would co-operate in\nthis matter. One object I have in bringing this paper before\nyou is to urge this co-operation, to show how you can set about\nit, and to indicate the kind of results you might obtain.\nThe term clairvoyance is frequently used to mean perceiving\nspirits : of that I know nothing ; it may or may not be true,\nbut you will first have to convince science that spirits demon-\nstrably exist, before you can hope science to believe they can\nbe seen by certain persons. In the present paper I restrict\nthe term clairvoyance to the perception of some hidden object\nwithout the aid of ordinary vision, or of any of the recognized\norgans of sense. Such perception may be a conscious act,\nbut it is more frequently sub-conscious, revealing itself by\nsome involuntary muscular action, such as the twisting of a\nforked twig, held in neutral or in unstable equilibrium, or by\nautomatic writing, or occasionally by an epigastric or emotional\nspasm. It is an ideo-motor stimulus, albeit the idea is usually\na sub-conscious one.\nThe term coined by Mr. Myers, tela:sthesia, sensation at a\ndistance, better expresses this than clairvoyance, and I hope\nthis term may come into more general use. It is true that,\nverbally, telepathy and tehesthesia have much the same mean-\ning. Mr. Myers has however defined the latter as a \" knowledge\nof things terrene which surpasses the limits of ordinary per-\nception \" in distinction to telepathy, which he defines as\n\" fellow-feeling at a distance.\" What we need is a word\nexpressing sujjcrnormal-mattcr-pcrcepiion, as distinct from tele-\npathy, which is supernormal-mincl-perception.\nDowsing for water and mineral lodes, is, as I have shown in the\nreports published in Vols. XIII. and XV. of our Proceedings, the\nbest evidence we possess of this faculty of telcesthesia or super-\nnormal-matter-perception. A good dowser can find indifferently\n\fJan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Dotvsers. 185\nmineral lodes, underground water, buried coins or any other\nobject, the appearance of which is known to him, and which\nhe definitely sets forth to find. In regions where mineral oil\nis found, a dowser is sometimes employed, and with remarkable\nsuccess, to locate the underground oil-spring. In both my\nEeports on the dowsing rod, several striking instances of the\ndiscovery of hidden coins by difl'erent dowsers were given. I\nwill only refer to two of these : one is on the evidence of a\nWiltshire country gentleman, Mr. W. J. Brown, and published\nby him in the Bath Natural History and Field Club Proceedings\nfor 1889. Mr. Brown had employed the famous dowser, John\nMullins, to locate the site for a well, which turned out a great\nsuccess, and incidentally tested Mullins' power of finding hidden\ncoins. Mr. Brown writes\nIn Mullins' absence we took ten stones off a wall, and, having\nplaced them on the road, we put a sovereign under three of the\nstones. [When Mullins returned] he passed his rod over the stones,\nand without the slightest hesitation told us at once under which\nstone the sovereigns were. When he came to a stone under which\nthere was no sovereign he at once said, \"Nothing here, master,\"\nbut when he came to the others he remarked, \"All right, master,\nthankee,\" turned the stone over and put the sovereign in his\npocket.\nA more stringent test is the following : Mr. Bruce, of\nNorton Hall, Grloucester, who also employed John Mullins\nsuccessfully to find water, writes to me as follows :\nMullins also found a half-sovereign I had buried in a walk we\nwere then making. I would have lost the half-sovereign if it had\nnot been for Mullins, as I was so careful not to put any mark\n[where it was hidden] that I was not able to find the place myself,\nand when Mullins stopped and said it was under his foot, I\nthought he was wrong, but there it was !\nMiss Miles,\u2014to whom, with Miss Eamsden, we are so much\nindebted for their painstaking and successful experiments on\ntelepathy across great distances,\u2014is also a singularly successful\ndowser, and many cases of her success in dowsing I have\ninvestigated ; some are published and others await publication.\nHere I will only cite one case in which, whilst locating the\nsite for a well, she also discovered a buried and long lost\n\f186 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\ncistern. Here is the account sent by Mrs. Batson, of Hoe\nBenham, Newbury, for whom the experiments were made\nHoe Benham, Newbury,\n15 Sep., 1905.\nI was anxious this suromer, 1905, to lay on a small supply of\nwater to a part of our flower garden which suffered much from\ndrought, and Miss Miles very kindly consented to seek for a\nsource that would suffice for our wants. I wished also to locate\nthe site of the spring from which pipes were laid on for the\nsupply of our house some fourteen years since. All record of this\nsite had been lost, even the plumber who had laid on the water\nbeing uncertain about its exact position and unable to indicate it.\nMiss Miles very quickly assured us of the whereabouts of this\nsupply cistern, and a post was driven into the earth at the place\nsuggested by her. She also indicated another spot at which, as\nshe asserted, water sufficient for our [flower] borders would be\ndiscovered within a few feet of the surface. Here also the place\nwas carefully marked. The following morning the ground was\ndug out, and a spring of water was found within about six feet\nfrom the surface at the spot where Miss Miles had advised us to\ndig for our supply. The crown of the lost cistern also appeared\nto sight at the expected place. I must confess to some previous\nscepticism, but in both these instances we have had undoubted\nevidence as to Miss Miles' gift in divining the existence of water,\nand I am now as completely convinced as before I was incredulous\nabout it. H. M. Batson.\nMiss Miles informs me that directly she came near the spot\nshe \" saw the tank unmistakeably, it appeared large with a\nrounded top and something branching away from it.\"\nIn connection with this supernormal vision, Miss Miles has\nkindly submitted to rigorous tests both in London and in Ireland.\nAs is the case with all other psychics, her lucidity varies, from\ncauses of which we know nothing. Once in London during Miss\nMiles' absence from the room, I concealed a sovereign under one\nof several rugs in a drawing room. On her return I asked if\nshe could find it, and turned away from her, lest any unconscious\nguidance from me might assist ; she closed her eyes and said,\n\" I see it under the corner of that rug.\" This was correct.\nAgain I hid the coin in her absence and again she found it\n\fJan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Dotvsers. 187\ncorrectly, and the third time she was more doubtful, but it was\nfairly right. Telepathy may here be possible, though I doubt\nit, but in the case of the tank and in water-finding it is\nexcluded.\nLast May I was invited to witness some experiments at\nCaxton Hall, London, where several dowsers were present in\norder to test whether they were sensitive to the presence of con-\ncealed radium. These experiments were arranged by a consulting\ngeologist, Mr. Beeby Thompson, F.G.S., who sent me an account\nof his preliminary trials at Sanderstead, which are given in\nAppendix C to this paper. Mr. Thompson was convinced that\nthe dowsers detected underground water chiefly when radio-active\nemanations came from the water or rocks below.\nAt Caxton Hall there were present several geologists and\nengineers besides Mr. Beeby Thompson, and three dowsers, Mr.\nEde of Arundel, Mr. Farndell of Littlehampton, and Mr. J. F.\nYoung, formerly one of our hon. associates, whom I had invited to\nattend. Fifteen milligrams of radium (worth a very large sum)\nwere kindly lent by Mr. Glew of Clapham, who was also present.\nBy means of a rough electroscope, consisting of two silk ribbons\nexcited to wide divergence by friction, the activity of the\nradium was tested. It caused the instant collapse of the\nribbons at a distance of 5 or 6 feet. The radium bromide\nwas as usual enclosed in a lead box with a lead lid, and when\nit was covered, not the slightest effect was produced on the\nelectroscope even when brought up as close as possible, show-\ning the impermeability of the lead to the rays affecting the\nelectroscope.\nThe dowsers were sent out of the room, and the radium,\nwith the lid off, was then hidden in different places ; but the\nresults were quite valueless, as is shown in the report which\nappeared in the Annals of Psychical Science for July-September\nlast, p. 507. The dowsers, Ede and Farndell, brought a bundle\nof strong forked sticks, and the extraordinary violence with\nwhich these twisted, one limb being constantly wrenched into\ntwo (especially with the dowser Farndell), showed that these\ndowsers possessed strong motor automatism. This, however,\ndoes not necessarily indicate, as professional dowsers believe it\ndoes, any corresponding clairvoyant or tehesthetic faculty. It\nwas, in fact, amusing to notice how powerfully suggestion\n\f188 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., i9io.\noperated on them. Movement of the uncovered radium down\ntheir back caused the most violent twisting and even breaking\nof their forked rods ; whilst when the radium was covered not\nthe slightest motion occurred. They knew, however, whether the\nradium was open or enclosed and were aware it was inert in the\nlatter CRSG, \u00a3IS they watched the previous tests with the electro-\nscope. Many present seemed convinced the radium powerfully\naffected the dowsers until I made the following experiments :\nShowing the dowser under trial the open radium, I stood\nbehind him and secretly covered the box, then slowly moved\nit down the back of the dowser ; the rod twisted violently and\nbroke. Then I told the dowser (Ede) I was going to cover the\nradium and showed him the closed box ;\nstanding behind him\nI secretly uncovered the box and moved it down his back as\nbefore. Not the slightest motion of the rod occurred : this\nexperiment was repeated two or three times with exactly\nsimilar results. This conclusively demonstrated three things\nfirst, that radio-activity had nothing to do with the motion of\nthe rod; next, that telepathy had no action, for both I and\nMr. Curnock, the Daily Mail representative, who was present,\nknew the real state of affairs ;\nand, lastly, that auto-suggestion\non the dowser's part is the true explanation of these experiments.\nI was, however, anxious to try Mr. J. F. Young's power of\nclairvoyance or tekesthesia when auto-suggestion and other\nsources of error were excluded. Those who have read the\nAppendix to my second report on the dowsing rod (Vol. XV.\np. 361) will remember I had previously tested Mr. J. F. Young\nand found he possessed this faculty ;\nmoreover, he had auto-\nmatically and correctly written the words contained in two\nopaque and carefully sealed envelopes I had sent to him,\nwhich it was impossible to read by eyesight, nor could the\nenvelopes be tampered with without discovery ;\nthey were sent\nback to me intact. Accordingly at Caxton Hall, having shut\nthe dowsers in an adjoining room, I covered the seats of\n46 chairs in the large Council Room with hats, coats, and\nbooks, and unseen by any one present, I placed a sovereign\nbeneath the covering on one chair. Mr. Young was then sent\nfor and told to try all the chairs in succession whilst I\nlooked out of the window. At a certain chair he stopped\nand said that was the one ; and when it was uncovered.\n\fJan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Dowsers. 189\nthe sovereign was found below. The odds were 45 to 1\nagainst success by chance coincidence. Again he was sent\nout of the room and watched by a sceptical friend who\nwas present, whilst I secretly hid the sovereign under a\nhat on another chair. All the others present were requested\nto look out of the window (as I did) when Mr. Young was\nrecalled. Again he correctly found the sovereign without\nhesitation. The probability of two successes running being due\nto chance coincidence was now over 2000 to 1. A third\nexperiment was made with Mr. Young, and this time a\nsceptical gentleman who was present asked leave to hide\nthe sovereign, the dowsers of course being absent, and all\nothers present looking out of the window whilst he did so.\nThe gentleman who hid the sovereign then left the room\nand the dowser came in and fixed upon a certain chair.\nThis was wrong; but, on the return of the hider of the sove-\nreign, he said he had first put it there under a bag and\nthen removed it to another chair. Without any information\nbeing given to the dowser he was asked again to try and find it,\nwhich he then did correctly. A fourth experiment was made in\na similar way, the sovereign being hidden by another gentleman,\nand its position accurately found by Mr. Young, who was\nagain tried. Finally a sceptical geologist who was present\nwished to hide the sovereign, and great precautions were\ntaken by him to avoid any possible collusion, or knowledge\nby any one present of where he had hidden it. In this case\nthe dowser Mr. Ede was tried, and when he was recalled the\nhider left the room. Mr. Ede fixed on a certain chair, and\nupon removing the covering the sovereign was not there. The\ndowser declared, however, that was the spot, and the geologist\nwho hid the sovereign, upon being recalled, said it was quite\nright, for he had put the sovereign under one of the legs of\nthat very chair, where it was found.\nThe law of probabilities shows that chance coincidence could\nnot be the explanation after the four successes running by\nMr. J. F. Young, nor can I find any other explanation recog-\nnized by science. The foregoing evidence,\u2014taken in conjunc-\ntion with the amazing success which attended good dowsers\nlike John Mullins, W. Stone, and the charity boy Bleton in\nFrance in the eighteenth century in finding underground water\n\f190 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\nwhen other means had failed,\u2014goes far to establish the\nexistence of telsesthesia, i.e. a supernormal-matter-perceptive-\npower in certain persons commonly called dowsers.\nIf telaesthesia be really an extension of human faculty\nin certain persons, its existence affords an explanation of\nmany curious statements which are to be found in the works\nof some learned writers more than 350 years ago. Thus a\nSpanish writer, Alphonsus of Yera Cruz, published a folio\nwork called Physica Speculatio, in 1557, in which he states\nthat there are certain people called \" Zahoris,\" or clear-seeing\nfolk, who have the power of vision through opaque bodies.\nA little later the learned and famous Jesuit of Louvain, Martin\nDelrio, in his great work on Magic, states that there are\ncertain men in Spain known as Zahoris, one of whom he saw\nin Madrid in 1575, and that these people \"can see things\nhidden in the inward bowels of the earth, veins of water,\nand treasures of metals and also corpses within sarcophagi.\nThis thing,\" he remarks, \" is most fully received and well\nknown.\" ^\nP.S.\u2014I asked Mr. Curnock if he could let me have a copy\nof the shorthand notes he took of the experiments in the\nCaxton Hall.

However, the summary of the experi-\nments on hidden coins tried with Chennels is as follows :\n\"Experiment 1. 12 saucers used, coins under same; dowser right\nin 7 cases, wrong in 5.\n'\n\u2022\nExperiment 2. 7 saucers used ; dowser right in 4 cases, wrong\nin 3.\nExperiment 3. 9 saucers used; dowser right in 7 cases, wrong\nin 2 : a distinct success.\nExperiment 4.

The results therefore were inconclusive.\"\n\f192 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\nAPPENDIX C.\nRECORD OF EXPERIMENTS MADE AT SANDERSTEAD,\nAPRIL 10th, 1909.\nBy Beeby Thompson, F.C.S., F.G.S.\nMessrs. Duke and Ockenden recommended Mr. Arthur Ede of\nArundel, aged 27, as one who they believed had the power\nof \"Divining,\" as the term is usually understood, that is to say, he\nwas affected in some mysterious way by running water.\nIn the experiments detailed a sample of 10 milligrammes of pure\nRadium Bromide was used, obtained from Mr. Glew of Clapham\nRoad.\nThe experiments commenced about mid-day in a garden at Sander-\nstead and extended to near five o'clock, and Mr. Ede used ordinary\nforked twigs which he had cut himself, but they were rather thicker\nthan he preferred.\nExperiment 1. Ede located certain spots in the garden, which,\npegged out, made a nearly straight, diagonal line, and this line he\npredicted was that of a spring. There was no means of proving\nthis. The garden is on Chalk (with possibly a capping of gravel),\nand it is rather improbable that there is any spring within a\nmoderate distance underground, as the garden is on a slope and\nno springs come out on the hill-side.\nExperiment 2. The garden, mostly grass, was more thoroughly\ngone over, and the same spots were again indicated ; but although\nEde walked right over the spot where the Radium was buried a\nfew inches underground in a cardboard box, he did not detect it.\nAn interval of 15 minutes or more was allowed between successive\nexperiments, and Mr. Ede never knew at any time what the experi-\nments were for. Radium was never mentioned.\nExperiment 3. Set tap running in house, and caused Ede to\nwalk over a considerable length of ground by side of house, where\nthe waste water was running only a few inches below ground, but\nnothing happened.\nExperiment 4. Put Ede beside a water-pipe which led to the\nbath-room, etc., on the floor above, and tested him in various ways\nby turning the water on and off. On the whole this was very\nsatisfactory. When the tap was turned on and off quickly the\nresponse was quick, although Ede and Mr. Maurice Ockenden, who\nwas with him, said they could not hear the water running from\nthe tap. When the tap was turned on very gently, as much as\ntwo minutes elapsed before the movement of water was detected.\n\fJan., 1910. Detection of Hidden Objects by Bowsers. 193\nExperiment 5. Hid the Radium in a slipper standing on the\nfloor of a room. Ede failed to detect it, and at only one point\nin the room was there a rather doubtful movement of the twig.\nExperiment 6. Hid two sovereigns in a small cup standing on\na table, and the Radium in a cloth bag hanging by the fire-place.\nThe coins were not detected, but the Radium was accurately\nlocated.\nExperiment 7. After an interval repeated the last experiment\ncoins not detected. Radium located just as before. Ede said he\nseemed drawn to this spot, he had never felt anything like it\nbefore.\nExperiment 8. After another interval, during which the Radium\nhad been removed from the bag and placed under a cushion on a\ncouch, Ede found that he seemed drawn both to the bag and to\nthe couch, although the bag was empty.\nExperiment 9. Further trials led Ede to remark that he couldn't\nmake it out, he seemed to be getting affected all over the room,\nalthough when he first began the trials there was little effect on\nhim.\nII.\n: Some Sittings with Carancini.\nBy W. W. Baggally.\nA SERIES of articles have recently appeared in Italian newspapers,\nin L'Eclio du Merveilleux, in the Annales des Sciences Psychiques,\nand in the Annals of Psychical Science, referring to physical\nphenomena which it was alleged took place in the presence of a\nnew medium, Francesco Carancini. The seances at which these\nphenomena occurred were held in the residence of Baron von\nErhardt, a gentleman who has resided in Rome for some time\nand who has been instrumental in bringing the alleged super-\nnormal powers of Carancini befoie the notice of several scientific\nmen. The phenomena said to occur in connection with this\nmedium appear, prima facie, to be very similar to those produced\nby Eusapia Palladino, such as the transportation and levitation\nof objects, impressions on clay, and luminous appearances ; but\nthere are others which it is asserted take place with Carancini\nand which, so far as my reading and experience go, are dissimilar\nto Eusapia's. I refer to the writing on lamp black in Latin,\n\f194 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\nmodern and ancient Greek, and in an unknown language, the\npassing of objects into closed wire cages, and the taking off of\nthe medium's jacket while his hands are presumably securely\nheld by the controllers.\nThe article that appeared in the April, 1909, number of the\nAnnals of Psychical Science is illustrated by flashlight photographs\nwhich purport to show the phenomena at the actual moment of\ntheir occurrence. Musical instruments are seen apparently\nfloating in the air, and larger objects, such as tables, appear to\nhave been raised from the floor and placed upon the medium's\nshoulders. In one photograph Carancini is seen levitated. I\nshall have occasion to refer to these photographs later on.\nDr. Lancellotti communicated the above mentioned article\nto the Annals of Psychical Science. He states therein that\n\" Carancini seems to have discovered his mediumship one\nevening when he was present at a seance at which Politi was\nthe medium.\" A few days afterwards another seance took place\nat which Carancini was persuaded to try his powers as a\nmedium, and these were, according to Dr. Lancellotti, almost\nat once shown to be even stronger than those of Politi himself.\nCarancini, for some time, continued to officiate as medium in\nspiritistic circles only. It was not until the beginning of last\nyear that a series of more carefully controlled experiments\ncould be carried out. These took place, as I have already\nstated, in the residence of Baron von Erhardt in Eome. During\nthe course of a conversation with Professors Bottazzi and\nGaleotti (two gentlemen who were present at some of our\nrecent seances with Eusapia Palladino) Mr. Feilding and I were\ntold of the existence of Carancini.\nOwing to the short time that I had at my disposal between\nthe termination of the Eusapia seances and Christmas day I\nwas obliged to hurry back to lingland, but Mr. Feilding while\npassing through Kome in December, 1908, had an opportunity\nof assisting at two sittings with this medium. Dr. Schiller\nhappening to be in Piome also assisted at these sittings, and\nsubsequently attended other stances, and Mr. Feilding and he\nwere sufficiently interested in what they observed to recommend\nthe Council to engage in a more systematic study of the case.\nSignor Carancini was accordingly invited to England, and\nduring the months of July and August, 1909, gave a series of\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings with Garancini. 195\nthirteen seances. Nine of these took place in Mr. Feilding's\nhouse in John Street, Mayfair, and four in the country residence\nof a mutual friend of Mr. Feilding and myself. At these last\na lady was present who was believed to be a physical medium.\nIt was thought advisable to try some experiments in the presence\nof this lady and Garancini.\nI was asked to undertake the general conduct of the sittings\nand to look after the comfort of the medium. Garancini does\nnot speak English. I spent with him the greater part of his\nstay in this country, 1 understand Italian and was consequently\nof service to him.\nMr. Feilding was present at twelve of the sittings, Mr. Sydney\nScott at eight, Sir \"William Grookes at four, Lady Grookes at\nthree, Sir Lawrence Jones at four, Dr. Wm. MacDougall at two,\nMr. Sidgwick and Miss Isabel Newton at one, and I at all the\nthirteen. Various other friends of Mr. Feilding and myself were\nalso invited to several of the sittings in order to make a larger\ncircle in accordance with the medium's request. Garancini is\naccustomed to sit outside the cabinet with his back to it. An\noblong table, such as a small kitchen table, is placed in front\nof him, upon which he places his hands. These are con-\ntrolled by the sitters on either side by holding his hands or\nby Garancini placing his hands on theirs. His feet are also\ncontrolled by the feet of the same sitters. At our S(^ances the\ncontrollers took their boots off to enable them better to feel\nthe medium's feet.\nWith Eusapia Palladino tlie musical instruments and other\nobjects used in the transportations are generally placed inside\nthe cabinet, but with Garancini they are placed, as a rule,\noutside on shelves or small tables at his side and at a short\ndistance from him.\nI have already made mention of the writing in foreign\nlanguages on smoked glass and of the passage of objects into\na closed wire case. In the hope that these phenomena would\ntake place with us I had a case made like two picture frames\nput together, with a glass front and a glass back to them. The\ninner surface of one of the glass plates was smoked, and could\nbe seen through the other plate, but the smoked surface could\nnot be tampered with without separating the two picture frames.\nThese were securely sealed together. I also procured a wire\n\f196 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., l9io.\ncage, the door and wires of which were strongly soldered. It\nwas impossible for an object of a larger bulk than the space\nbetween the wires to enter the cage, except by breaking it,\nunless supernormally. The smoked frame and the wire cage\nwere examined by Mr. Feilding and myself, at the commence-\nment of each sitting, to verify that no writing was then on\nthe smoked glass and that no object had been introduced into\nthe cage. Besides these test apparatus Sir William Crookes\nsupplied two rings cut out of a piece of parchment. The\nthreading of these rings together without either being damaged\nwould have conclusively proved the possibility of the passage\nof matter through matter. Other objects, such as a tambourine,\na toy trumpet, a bell, a zither, an indiarubber ball, etc., were\nalso placed on the table on the right of the medium and on\nthe tray stand and the steps of a ladder on his left. At the\nthird seance, and at subsequent ones, a chair was put inside\nthe cabinet with one or two objects on it. An electrical\napparatus with white and red globes hung from the ceiling\nover the seance table. The intensity of the light could be\nregulated (from light sufficiently strong for the reading of\nsmall print to a mere glimmer) by means of a commutator\nwhich rested on the stenographer's table. This was always\ndone in accordance with the medium's request. In other\nrespects he willingly submitted to any precautions that\nwere from time to time suggested. A three-leaved clothes\nhorse, 6 feet in height, upon which a fine mesh hammock net\nhad been tightly stretched and nailed, was placed behind him,\nwith the two outer leaves one on each side of him, at the John\nStreet seances, so as to prevent contact with any of the objects\nplaced according to his wont for transportation. I had some\npieces of cardboard painted with luminous paint sewn to his\ncoat sleeves close to his wrists.\nThe general procedure at Carancini's seances is as follows\nAfter the sitters have taken their places round the seance\ntable and formed the chain, i.e. taken hold of each other's hands,\nand the control of the medium has been established, he requests\nthem to keep silence for a short time and then asks them to\ntalk. While they are doing so Carancini goes into what pur-\nports to be a state of trance. An alleged spirit guide named\nGiuseppe then controls him and produces the principal mani\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings witli Carancini. 197\nfestations. Questions asked are now answered by Giuseppe\nthrough the medium or by means of raps.\nI will now describe the phenomena that took place at our\nsittings, giving extracts from the stenographic notes taken at\nthe time.\nSSance I. July 30th, 1909.\nMrs. Sidgwick controUing on the left of medium.\nMr. Baggally on the right.\nIn very dim light.\nMrs. Sidgwick reports : Raps on my chair. I was touched behind\nat the back just above the seat or my chair, as if it came through\nthe back of the chair. It was not a definable touch, only a feeling\nof something.\nSir William Crookes controlling on left.\nDr. Wni. MacDougall on right.\nComplete darkness.\nThe small tray-stand on left of medium, behind the net screen\nand close to Sir William Crookes, is heard to fall over.\nSir William immediately says : I had my hand holding his between\nmy fingers and the palm of my hand. He was grasping my fingers\nbetween his thumb and the first and second fingers and so tightly that\nit became almost painful. The foot control was perfect. On the\nwhite light being turned up the tray-stand and the various objects\nupon it are found upset on the floor.\nSeance II.\nControllers\u2014Sir Wm. Crookes on left.\nLady Crookes on right.\nNotes taken in the dark. Raps, apparently on the floor behind\nmedium, follow raps made by ourselves on the table. Both con-\ntrollers report that his feet are under control, and his hands are\nquite still on the table. Scratches are heard on the woodwork of\nthe net screen. The medium said he was going to try and produce\none more phenomenon. He then raised his two hands, held on each\nside by Sir WiUiam and Lady Crookes, made a great effort and a\nnoise was heard. Giuseppe then said that he had lifted the screen\n10 centimetres and it had then fallen back. When the white light was\nturned up the screen is found changed in position and partly pushed\ninto the opening of the cabinet.\n\f198 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\nSiance III.\nControllers^\u2014Sir Wm. Crookes on left.\nMr. Scott on right.\nLight diminished to the last point.\nThiee raps are heard, position indeterminable, sort of dull thuds\nlow down. Then series of raps apparently inside cabinet. Feet of\nmedium stated to be immovable by both controllers. Hands motion-\nless on table. The medium asks the controllers to hold his legs\nwell and to place them so that they can feel them all the way down\nfrom the knee. Medium asks that somebody should knock on the\ntable. Feilding raps four rhythmical knocks ;\nthey are answered like\nan echo, apparently in the cabinet. Feilding does it again and an\nextremely bad imitation follows, all wrong.\nSir William puts his hand between the back of the medium's chair\nand curtain. Feilding then asked that raps should be made inside\ncabinet. Raps are heard of a different quality of sound and Sir\nWilliam said that the}^ sounded near where his hand was. Sir\nWilliam says : The medium was moving my hand, and whenever\nhe moved my hand backwards a rap sounded on the floor.\nStance IV.\nControllers\u2014Sir Lawrence Jones on right.\nSir William Crookes on left.\nBright red light. Raps that cannot be localized, apparently low\ndown on floor beliind Sir William Crookes. Both hands visible\nand held on the table motionless. Feet held as before motionless.\nLight diminished to No. 3. He moves Sir William's hand, and\nsynchronously with the movements raps are heard low down behind\nhim. He does the same with his right hand with Sir Lawrence Jones'\nhand with the same result.\nMedium asks for paper and pencil and writes something. The\nwriting, when the light was turned up, contained the words, \"Non\nsono Giuseppe sono Zurucruft,\" (I am not Joseph, I am Zurucruft,)\nand then follow a few lines of what looks like Tamil.

Sittings with Garancini. 201\nStance XIII.\nControllers\u2014Mr. C. on the right.\nMr. Baggally on the left.\nComplete darkness.\nMrs. Lowry reports : I was touched behind. There is some one\nbehind my chair. My name has been called twice.\nBefore referring to the four other sittings which were held\nat the country residence of a mutual friend of Mr. Feilding\nand myself, and at which sittings the lady who was believed\nto possess supernormal physical powers was present, I will\ncomment on the phenomena that I have just described. The\nfirst thing that strikes a reader of the above stenographic\nnotes is the paucity in number of the phenomena and the\nunsatisfactory conditions under which they were obtained.\nWith the exception of some of the raps which occurred in\nlight, more or less strong, all the other phenomena took\nplace in complete darkness.\nCarancini appeared to be willing to submit to any precautions,\nbut somehow no manifestations occurred, with the exception of\nthe raps, until after the light had been completely extinguished\nat the request of the alleged control Giuseppe. The phenomena\nwere therefore quite unlike those that Mr. Feilding, Mr.\nCarrington, and I witnessed with Eusapia Palladino and to\nwhich we attach great importance on account of their occur-\nrence in good light.\nIt will be noted that, with the exception of the raps on\nMrs. Sidgwick's chair at the first seance, all the raps were\nheard to sound behind the medium, apparently on the floor\nor in the cabinet behind his chair.\nThe fact that the raps were heard in that locality and in\nclose proximity to the medium suggests the probability that\nthey were produced by his tipping the chair on which he sat\nand striking the floor with the back legs. Mr. Scott, when\nhe was controlling, noticed a suspicious movement of the\nmedium's body when he heard some of the raps, and Mr.\nC. at seance VIII. just after the note in stenographer's\nreport which reads, \" Thumps are heard. The medium asks\nthe controllers to ascertain that the chair legs are on the\ncarpet,\" makes the following observation, \" I should like to\n\f202 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\ncorrect that as I was looking round to see if the legs were\non the carpet, as I thought, I saw the legs of the chair moving.\"\nThe raps at the iirst seances, though not loud, were sharp and\ndistinct, but after a carpet had been placed under Carancini's\nchair they changed in sound, being then more like thuds.\nThe controller's statements that when the raps were heard\nthe medium's hands and feet were immovable do not prove\nthat he might not have been tipping his chair at those times.\nHis hands and feet could have been perfectly still and yet\nhis body could have tipped the light chair upon which he sat.\nI have stated that at the first sitting Mrs. Sidgwick heard\na few faint raps on her chair. They were inaudible to\nme. I sat on the other side of Carancini controllin<T him.\nThese and the raps at the second seance, after the medium\nhad asked the controllers to hold his legs well and place them\nso that they could feel them all the way down from the knee,\nwere the most evidential.\nTaking into consideration the difficulty of localizing sound,\nthe possibility of raps being produced by the cracking of a\njoint (I have met individuals who made raps in this manner)\nand the above stated suspicious circumstance of the medium's\nchair having been seen to move and also of the change in\nthe character of the sounds when a carpet was placed under\nCarancini's chair, there seems strong evidence that the raps\nwere produced normally.\nI attach no importance to the scratches heard on the wood-\nwork of the screen nor to the change of position of the screen\nat seance II. The back of the medium's chair was in close\nproximity to the framework, and Carancini's convulsive move-\nments could have produced these phenomena by the rubbing\nand pushing of his chair against the framework.\nThe writing by the medium in apparently oriental characters\nis of no evidential value whatever. Even if it had been\nreally in an oriental language this would not have precluded\nthe possibility of his having learnt to form the characters\npreviously in his normal condition. This hypothesis is supported\nby the fact that some of these characters written by the medium\nin our own presence resembled others that are shown in one\nof the photographs in the Annals of Psychical Science. These\nlast were alleged to have been produced by an independent\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings with Garancini. 20a\nentity, not by the medium. The name of the Indian who\ndied 4000 years ago, \" Zurucruft,\" has a German sound about\nit, as if it were intended to represent the past participle of\nziiriickrufen, to call back.\nWhen considering the evidential value of a phenomenon it\nshould be borne in mind that if the conditions under which\nit occurs are such that it could have been brought about by\nnormal means, then a normal explanation should be accepted,\nas this would be in accordance with our ordinary principles of\nreasoning.\nI apply this rule to the consideration of the other phenomena\nwhich took place at our sittings in total darkness.\nThe falling over of the tray-stand behind the net when one\nof the medium's hands controlled by Sir William Crookes was\nbrought in close proximity to it, although he did not touch\nthe stand, might have been caused by pushing the net against\nit. Sir William Crookes' hand was pressed against the net\nand the net yielded a few inches. The tray-stand stood at\nthe time quite close behind the net.\nThe lights seen at seance Y., within or close to the cabinet,\nappeared after Carancini entered the cabinet by himself and\nconsequently when he was uncontrolled. He sat on a chair inside\nthe cabinet with the clothes horse surrounding him ; but this\nprecaution, which had been suggested by himself, would not have\nprevented him from standing on the chair, as there was no netting\non the top of the clothes horse. A suspicious noise was heard as\nif the medium were getting on his chair just before the lights\nappeared high up towards the ceiling. One of the sitters, Mrs.\nPaton, made tlie remark at the time\u2014\" It sounds as if he were\ngetting on the chair.\" The medium took his jacket off with the\nluminous patches on it before he sat in the cabinet. This was\na very suspicious action on his part. It suggested that he did\nnot wish the position of his hands to be known at the time\nthat the lights were seen.\nWhen the seance was over I searched the medium and\nfound in his pocket a box of safety matches, and amongst\nthem a few phosphorus matches. I took one of these, and\nafter the medium had retired I produced, in the dark, with\nthe phosphorus match that I had taken, before Mr. Scott\nand Miss Saunders the stenographer, lights which were in\n\f204 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\nall appearances identical with those that had been seen at\nthe seance.\nThe phenomena of the touches remains to be dealt with.\nBefore I refer to these I will relate our experiences at the\ncountry residence of our friend. Some of these experiences\nhave a bearing on the methods that in my opinion could\nhave been used for the production of the touches. The results\nobtained at Mr. Feilding's house up to the eighth sitting\nhad proved almost wholly negative. There were, it is true,\na certain number of phenomena besides the raps, but these\nphenomena had occurred in complete darkness and were of\nsuch a nature that the possibility of their having been produced\nby normal means could not be excluded. Both Mr. Feilding\nand I were greatly disappointed at these results. We had\nhoped that the members of our Council and other sitters who\nattended the sittings would have witnessed phenomena similar\nto, and under as good test conditions as, those that we had\nobtained with Eusapia Palladino at Naples. We did not, how-\never, abandon all hope, but decided to continue the investigation\nin a different environment and in the presence of fresh sitters.\nThe boisterous manifestations that we obtained at the first\nsitting in the residence of our friend, seemed fully to justify\nus in the course that we took.\nMiss X., the lady to whom I have referred, who was believed\nto be a physical medium, sat as controller on Carancini's right,\nand oixr host in a like capacity on his left.\nMr. Feilding graphically describes what took place at this\nseance in a letter to Miss Johnson. These are his words\nAugust \\'2th, 1909.\nWe had a seance last night. The results were sensational to a\ndegree, also exasperating. Unfortunately we had not got our luminous\npatches nor the network screen ; nor were Baggally and I controlling,\nalso it was exceedingly dark. I had every reason to believe that\nthe control was well carried out. The controllers constantly reported\nthat they had the hand firmly by the thumb and their legs were\nright round the medium's legs. In these conditions we had a large\nnumber of pinches and touches and transportations of objects. Some\nof the manifestations were rather violent and the ladies screamed.\n[Our hostess], who sat number two from the medium, had the\nshoulder of her dress pulled right down, a handkerchief was wiped\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings with Caraneini. 205\nall over her face, thrust down the front of her dress inside, and then\npulled out again right across her husband, who was controlling.\nMiss X., who was controlling on the right (and although very\nnervous appears to have frozen on like grim death), was seized by\nthe leg and nearly pulled out of her chair, and subsided in shrieks\nupon the floor, still grasping the medium's hand when the light was\nturned up. Objects at a distance of more than a foot from my\nextended hand, when sitting in the medium's position, were moved,\none of them being transported to a second table, added at tlie\nfurther end of the medium's table, in order to accommodate the large-\ncircle. A hand felt about all over Miss X. and Miss W., who was.\nholding her in her arms to give her courage.\nFurther, a dinner bell placed on a chair in the cabinet fell\nto the ground with a loud crash.\nAt last, thought we, the phenomena are genuine. Mr. Feilding\nand I therefore decided to use extra precautions and to control\nthe medium ourselves. We did so the following evening, Mr..\nFeilding controlling on the right and I on the left.\nAt this sitting Miss X. occupied a seat next to me on my left.\nShortly after the light was extinguished the usual raps were-\nheard, apparently on the floor behind the medium, but what\nsurprised me was that they were accompanied by loud raps,\nunder Miss X.'s chair. I very gradually lowered my left hand,,\nwhich I had free, and placed it under the chair of this lady,,\ntill I could feel the heels of her feet. I then detected Miss X.\nstriking the floor with the point of one of her boots, thus pro-\nducing the loud raps that were heard under her.\nThis discovery immediately gave rise in my mind to the\nsuspicion that some of the phenomena of the previous seance\nhad been produced by her. I also could no longer feel sure\nthat she had continuously held the medium's hand while she\nwas controlling him. The evidence for the genuineness of the\nmanifestation was further vitiated by Mr. Feilding and ujy\ndetecting the medium, shortly after, in the fraudulent pro-\nduction of phenomena by means of his right hand, which he\nhad liberated after resorting to the trick of substitution of\nhands. Owing to the luminous patches on his sleeves the\nfirst substitution was immediately detected. After this the\ncontrol of his hands was conducted with deliberate carelessness\nand the substitution was repeated four or five times. It was\n\f206 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 1910.\ncarried out with extreme caution. We could see the medium's\nright hand being retired, at a snail's pace, from contact with\nMr. Feilding's hand while he substituted his left hand for it.\nAfter this Carancini passed his free hand under the table,\ntouched us, and pulled our coats. It should be noted that at\nthe time of the substitutions the medium purported to be in\na state of trance and under control of Giuseppe. I am unable\nto say whether this was really the case. If it was, Giuseppe\nmust have been the guilty party who perpetrated the frauds,\nand he must have practised them for a long time previously\nto this series of sittings. I sometimes think that, with physical\nmediums, the alleged control serves as a very convenient\nscapegoat, ever ready to hand to bear the blame which other-\nwise would have attached to the mediums when they are\nfound out in trickery.\nOnly three phenomena now remain to be described, i.e. the\nmovement of a pencil, the touches on the shoulders of two\nsitters at the third sitting at our friend's house, and the\nluminous appearances at the fourth sitting. A pencil and\npaper had been placed on the seance table at a distance of\nabout 3 feet in front of the medium. This pencil was heard,\nin total darkness, to move apparently independently two or\nthree times. I must observe that previous to the first move-\nment Carancini had leaned his head on his outstretched arms\non the table. By this action his hands, which were tied to\nthe hands of our host and myself, were brought close to the\npencil, and it was not impossible for him to have taken hold\nof it with the tips of two of his fingers and, after he sat back\nin his chair and raised his hands, to have let the pencil drop\non the table and thus produce the sound. When the pencil\nwas heard to move a second time '\nGiuseppe ' said, \" I did not\ndo that.\" I have a strong suspicion that Miss X., who was\nseated opposite to where the pencil was, produced this pheno-\nmenon. I permit myself to say this as Miss X. has since\nadmitted to our host her offences in respect to these sittings.\nCarancini at this seance not only had his hands held by the\ncontrollers but his wrists were tied to theirs. It was not\npossible for him to effect a substitution of hands, nevertheless\nour host and I, who were controlling, felt light touches on\nour shoulders on the sides next to the medium. When I\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings with Carancini. 207\nreceived a touch I previously felt a movement of the medium's\narm which gave me the impression that he was leaning his\nbody towards me. The touch felt as if he were pressing my\n.shoulder gently with his nose.\nThe only manifestation at the last seance, held in our friend's\nhouse, was the appearance of a few lights, one at a time, in\nor near the cabinet, after Carancini had entered it by himself\nuncontrolled. Each light resembled a phosphorus match head\nwhen rubbed between the fingers. After the sitting was over\nthe medium was insistent about my searching him. He possibly\nmay have had in his mind the fact that I had found a box\nof matches on him on a previous occasion. I searched him,\nbut found no matches this time. A single phosphorus match,\nhowever, would have sufficed for the production of the lights,\nfor it is so small an object that it could have been easily con-\ncealed about his person after the lights were seen.\nI have said enough to show that all the phenomena that we\nobtained with Carancini were of an unsatisfactory nature. With\nthe exception of the raps they all took place in absolute darkness.\nThe medium, or 'Giuseppe,' was detected several times carrying\nout the trick of substitution of hands, after which the sitters\ngot touches. When he was not able to effect a substitution,\nowing to his hands being tied, there were indications that he\nthen made use of his head to touch the sitters.\nIt is by the above methods that he, in my opinion, produced\nthe touches which were felt at the John Street sittings.\nThe only touch that could not have been produced by either\nof the above methods was the one felt, in the dim light, by Mrs.\nSidgwick at the first seance. I understood Mrs. Sidgwick to\nsay, however, just after she reported the touch, that she came\nto the conclusion that she was mistaken in the cause of her\nsensation, which she found was really due to the pressure of\nthe bottom bar of her chair against her back.\nGreat importance is attached, by believers in Carancini's\nphenomena, to the flash-light photographs which were taken at\nhis seances. Let us, for a moment, consider what their value\nis for evidential purposes. Being instantaneous photographs,\nthey can, by their very nature, only show the levitated object\nfor a moment. They do not show the events that cause the\nobject to be in the position in which it is seen.\n\f208 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jan., 191o.\nWe read in Dr. Lancellotti's paper that Carancini's control,\n'\nGiuseppe,' indicates the exact moment the photographs can be\ntaken by calling out the word \" Fuoco.\"\nNow, what is to prevent a fraudulent medium,\u2014^^just at the\nmoment that he throws a small object into the air, or after he\nhas pinned or hooked it to the cabinet curtain, or after he\nhas placed a heavier object on his shoulders, or on another\npoint of support,\u2014from calling out the word \" Fuoco,\" or any\nother word as a signal for the photograph to be taken at that\nconvenient moment ? It will be noted that in the photographs\nonly small objects appear to be floating in the air. All the\nheavier ones have a point of support. Carancini himself at\nthe moment of his alleged levitation, appears to be standing\non his own chair.\nIt may be said that the medium could not have pro-\nduced the phenomena fraudulently, as the photographs show\nthat his hands were controlled at the time. To this I reply\nthat although both Carancini's hands were in contact with\nthose of the controllers at the instant that the photographs\nwere taken, yet it was quite possible that one of his hands\nwas free just before he called out the word \" Fuoco.\" I have\nample grounds for making this assertion. These grounds are\nbased on the careful observations that Mr. Feilding and I were\nable to make of the process that Carancini or '\nGiuseppe ' resorted\nto when he carried out the substitutions of hands at the time\nthat we were controlling him. It was very interesting to watch\nthe rapidity with which he replaced his right hand on Mr.\nFeilding's immediately after he had brought about a phenomenon.\nHe would touch us or pull our coats with his free right hand\nand immediately afterwards lift his left hand from the back\nof Mr. Feilding's and replace it by his right hand, the action\nbeing accompanied by a strong convulsive movement of his body,\nby his then violently pulling our hands, in contact with his\nown, up into the air, and by the uttering of a loud groan.\nFlash-light photographs do not prove the genuineness of a\nphenomenon. They merely give us a picture of what is actually\nhappening at any one time without showing us the preceding\nactions of the medium leading up to the event.\nIn regard to the substitution of hands that was detected at\none of our sittings when the medium professed to be in a trance,\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings ivith Garanc%ni. 209\nif it be asserted that this may have been an action for which the\nmedium was not responsible, I may repeat that it was performed\nat the time with great deliberation and apparent care to avoid\ndetection, and also that such a trick, to be carried out with\nsuccess, requires previous training, which it is difficult to suppose\ncould have been effected in a trance state.\nIn conclusion, I would point out that the phenomena obtained\nat these seances differed fundamentally from those we witnessed\nwith Eusapia Palladino at Naples, not only in that Carancini's\nphenomena (with the exception of the raps) occurred in com-\nplete darkness, whereas with Eusapia Palladino many of the\nphenomena took place in light when her hands and her whole\nbody were in full view, a condition which is of course essential\nfor any good evidence for supernormality ; but also in that there\nwas definite positive evidence of fraud in Carancini's case.\nDuring the discussion that followed Mr. Baggally's paper,\nMr. Sydney C. Scott, who had been present at all the sittings\nheld with Carancini in London, said :\nThe arrangements of the room in which the sittings were\nheld had been very carefully made by Mr. Feilding and Mr.\nBaggally, and the device of the patches of luminous paint on\nthe medium's sleeves was an excellent one, enabling the move-\nments of his arms to be seen, even when there was least light.\nThe manifestations which took place at the sittings when\nI was present were of four kinds, viz.:\u2014(1) Eaps or taps,\n(2) upsetting a small table, (3) the production of moving lights,\nand (4) the writing of some strange characters.\nThe table at which we sat was a small light deal table,\nat one end of which Carancini was placed, flanked closely on\neach side by the controllers, who held his hands firmly and\nalso his legs by wrapping theirs round his.\nThe raps which took place were faint in the extreme and\ncould only be detected by listening intently. We all agreed\nthat the sounds proceeded from the region of the floor and\nin the rear of the medium's chair. By sitting on the extreme\nfront edge of a chair it is quite easy with scarcely any per-\nceptible muscular movement to make the chair tilt forward\nand in this way to produce faint taps on the floor. I satisfied\n\f210 Journal of Societij for Psychical Research. Jax.,1910-\nmyself when acting as one of the controllers that this was the\nway the taps were produced, as T could feel slight movements\nin the medium's leg, produced by extension and contraction of\ntlie muscles which synchronised with the sounds.\nWith the view of testing this further, I asked Mr. Feilding\nto put the medium's chair at a subsequent meeting on a carpet\ninstead of on the parquet flooring. This was done, and, as we\nanticipated, the taps were then of the muffled kind which\nmight be expected when the legs of the chair struck the iloor\ncovered with carpet.\nThe upsetting of the small table only occurred once. Sir\nWilliam Crookes was then acting as one of the controllers, and\nit was agreed that the occurrence possessed no evidential value,,\nas the medium's movements were very convulsive at the\nmoment, and although his hands were not released and he\nwas enclosed by the netting cage, yet it seemed quite possible\nthat he could have tilted the table over with his elbow. The\ntable was standing near the netting, which had a certain amount\nof slack or elasticity and yielded to pressure. On subsequent\noccasions the table was put further away from the medium\nand never fell over again.\nThe appearance of the lights also only occurred at one\nsitting. On this occasion the medium had asked to be put\ninside the cabinet or alcove and a chair was placed there for\nhim to sit on. After an interval a small spot of light appeared\nhigh up and apparently at the top of the curtain, about the\nheight the medium could reach easily by standing on his chair..\nThis light was repeated several times and was occasionally\nduplicated. It alternated with the appearance of luminous\npatches rather lower down.\nAt the close of the sitting Mr. Baggally asked Carancini\nto allow himself to be searched before leaving the room, a\nrequest to which he readily acceded, and Mr. Baggally and\nI accordingly examined him and went through his pockets..\nThe contents were found to comprise a few unsuspicious articles\nand a small box of matches. Without expressing any suspicion\nof these, Mr. Baggally with the dexterity of a practised conjuror\npossessed himself of a few of the matches, unknown, I think,\nto Carancini, who then left the room. As soon as he had\ngone Mr. Baggally switched off the electric light and them\n\fJan., 1910. Sittings with. Carancini. 211\nproduced the identical effects of the moving spots of light\nwhich we had witnessed during the sitting.\nThe writing of strange characters happened twice, the writing\non the first occasion being much more regular than on the\nsecond. A marked feature about the first writing was the\nspeed with which it was produced and its regularity.\nThe characters, or some of them, bore a resemblance to\ncertain Greek and Russian characters, but we were told by\nGiuseppe, Carancini's alleged control, that they embodied a\nmessage from an individual who lived some \"iOOO years ago,\nthough, as the interpretation was not vouchsafed, we were not\nmuch the wiser. It was obvious that the production of these\ncomplex characters at such a rate of speed in the dark would\ncertainly require a large amount of practice beforehand, except\non the hypothesis, which seemed untenable, of their being\nproduced genuinely by external control.\nIn view of all these experiences, I had arrived at a definite\nopinion adverse to the genuineness of all the phenomena which\nhad occurred during the ten sittings at whicli I was present.\nIn regard to these sittings I was satisfied not only that\nCarancini had cheated, hut that he had cheated all the time\nand whenever he could. Thus the results were disappointing,\nnot only because of the total absence of anything in the\nnature of genuine phenomena, but also because of the presence\nof fraudulent tricks perpetrated by the medium.\nDONATION EECEIVED.\n\"We wish most gratefully to acknowledge the receipt, on\nDecember 20th, 1909, of two \u00a35 notes which were sent\nanonymously to the Secretary as a contribution to the funds\nof the Society.

Melian Stawell, 231\nDISCUSSION OF THE NAPLES EEPOET ON\nEUSAPIA PALLADINO.^\nI.\nMr. Podmore in his paper {Journal S.P.Pi., Dec. 1909) on the\nabove Eeport limits his analysis to three seances, V., VI., VII.,\nand to a certain class of phenomena depending for their evidential\nvalue on the sense of touch alone and to the phenomena at which\none member of the Committee (B.) controlled on the right.\nEor a normal explanation of the phenomena at these three\nseances, he says :\n\" All that we need assume is the deception of a\nsingle person (B.) and a single sense\u2014and that the sense of\ntouch.\" 2\nFrom this limited analysis he desires his readers to draw the\nconclusion that the phenomena, of whatever nature, at all the\nseances, including those at which B. was not present, were of a\nnon-evidential nature.^\nI would say that I entertain the greatest admiration for Mr.\niSee Proceedings S.P.R. Vol. XXIII. pp. 306-569.\n'\u2022^Mr. Podmore limits the words \"the deception of a single person\" to B., as\nhe says in his paper that the intervals during which C. controlled on the\nright of Eusapia were unproductive [of phenomena], therefore C. could not\nhave been deceived.\n^ When dealing with the report as a whole Mr. Podmore definitely states\nthat the Committee's method of investigation failed. He also says, \" I see no\nreason to doubt that the criticism made [by me] on these seances will apply\nmutatis mutandis to all the rest.\"\n\f214 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nPodmore's analytical and logical powers, but he will pardon me\nfor saying that in this case his argument appears to me to lack\nlogical consistency.\nThe following propositions\n(1) Because on the assumption that a single person was\ndeceived in his sense of touch, certain phenomena were\nnon-evidential, therefore the other phenomena which\noccurred at other seances, at which B. was not present,\nwere also non-evidential:\n(2) Because certain phenomena, depending for their evidential\nvalue on a single person's sense of touch, were not\nevidential, therefore other phenomena witnessed by the\nmembers of the Committee not depending for their\nevidential value on their sense of touch alone were also\nnon-evidential ; .\n.\nappear to me to be illogical.\nMr. Podmore begins by setting aside certain phenomena, such\nas levitations of the table, etc., as by their nature inconclusive.\nThe distinction he draws appears to me an arbitrary one, and I am\nunable to see any justification for it.^ Further he limits himself\nfor the details of his criticism to the phenomena of the three\nseances V., VI., VII., but includes in his conclusion the phenomena\nof all the other seances. The words that he uses, \" this method\nof investigation . . . has failed,\" can but mean that no pheno-\nmena whatever were of any evidential value.\nI think that this sweeping condemnation of all the phenomena\n\u2014no matter of what nature\u2014justifies me in bringing forward\nany incident from any seance in answer to his criticisms, and in\nwhat follows I propose to use this liberty.\nMr. Podmore says\nTo analyse with care the whole mass of evidence would be an\nextremely laborious undertaking. There are only five completely\n^The reason he gives is \"difficulty of isolation,\" but surely Mr. Podmore\ndoes not mean to imply that in every case the phenomena thus set aside\n(1) were so mixed up and entangled with others of a different character, or\n(2) that they always occurred in contact with Eusapia's physical organism, so\nthat it is impossible to find in the Report a clear cut statement of the isolated\noccurrence of any one. If Mr. Podmore attaches either of the above meanings\nto the word '\nisolation '\nthe first is at once refuted by the report of seance\nIX., 10.13 to 10.2.3, \u2014to give only one example, \u2014and the second by the report\nof seance XI. 10.18, \u2014to give also only one example.\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Pallaclino. 215\nsuccessful seances \u2014seances, that is, which include the whole range of\nphenomena, from tilts of the table to phantom heads\u2014viz., V., VI.,\nVII., VIII., and XI. But at seance VIII. and XL, except for an\nunproductive hour at the beginning of seance VIII., one side of Eusapia\nwas under the control of a visitor.\nMr. Podmore uses here the words \" unproductive hour \" in an\narbitrary sense, for during this very hour, amongst other pheno-\nmena, the following are reported.^\nSeance VIII., 10.15. F. The table tilts towards medium and then a\ncomplete levitation of it.\nF. Her hands on the table holding and above C.'s and my hands.\nHer left foot on mine.\nC. Her right foot was just touching my left foot. My left knee\npressing against her right knee.\n10.18. Two complete levitations of the table cloiselj^ following one\nupon the other.\nF. She had asked all except the controllers to take their hands\noff the table, and they had accordingly sat back. My\nright hand across both her knees. Her left foot un-\ndoubtedly on mine. Both her hands on the table and\nvisible.\nC. Her right foot pressing against my left foot. My left knee\npressing against her right knee. I passed my hand\nbetween her body and the table several times [showing\nthat there was no hook or attachment. C, Dec. 11\/08].\nI do not bring forward the above phenomena for evidential\npurposes, as visitors sat at the table (of whose honour, however,\nI do not entertain the slightest doubt), but to show that,\ncontrary to his statement, this hour was not unproductive.\nThis may appear captious criticism on my part, but as Mr.\nPodmore requires absolute completeness in the description of the\ncontrol by the members of the Committee, so should he be\nabsolutely complete in his criticism and not exclude certain kinds\nof phenomena.\nI continue to quote from his paper\nSeances V, VI., and VII., represent therefore at once the high\nwater mark of the phenomena and the best conditions of control.\nf\u2014\n1 1 give the description of the control in detail in order to save the reader\nthe trouble of having to refer to the report.\n\f216 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nThis is misleadino- as the best conditions of control did not\ntake place only at these seances. (See amongst others seance IX.,\n10.14, 10.16, 10.17. Complete levitation of seance table when\nstrongest light was on and Eusapia's hands were visible and also\nher body down to her feet. Seance IX., 12.38\u20140. grasped by a\ncomplete hand through curtain, Eusapia's hands controlled and\nvisible on the table and feet controlled.)\nMr. Podniore says\nTwo conclusions at once emerge from this closer analysis.\n(1) That Eusapia is afraid of Mr. Carrington. Twice in the course\nof these seances he was, by Eusapia's request, displaced from the\ncontrol of the right side ; so that in fact save for two brief and\nunproductive intervals at the beginning of seances V. and VII.\nrespectively, he was not allowed, during these three seances, to sit at\nEusapia's right.\nAlthough it is not stated in the Eeport, it is a fact that Mr.\nCarrington was ill and was compelled to keep his bed for some\ntime during the course of these seances, and when Eusapia asked\nhim to retire from his control at seances V., VII., she said that\nshe did so because his vitality was very low.\nI cannot of course either substantiate or contradict Mr. Pod-\nmore's conclusion that Eusapia was afraid of Mr. Carrington, but\nI would ask, if she was afraid, why she allowed him to control\nher on the right during the whole of seance IX., when many\nphenomena occurred on his side, and she did not ask him to\nretire.\nI continue to quote from the same portion of Mr. Podmore's\npaper\nSo that, in fact, save for two brief and unproductive intervals\nat the beginning of seances V. and VII. respectively,\nThe word \" unproductive \" is here again used arbitrarily, for\nin the interval at the beginning of seance V., when C. was\ncontrolling on the right and E. on the left, amongst other\nphenomena, the following is reported\n10.13. Partial levitation on the two legs away from medium.\nP. Both [E.'s] hands were oif the table at the time the table\nwent up and were clenched at a distance of about three\nor four inches from the table, slightly below it. The\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 217\ntable remained up and then fell back. My right hand\nwas on both her knees. I was perfectly certain of her\nleft foot.\nC. I have my left foot on her right clearly. My left knee\npressing against her right.\nAnd in the interval at the beginning of seance VII., 9.47,\nwhen C. was controlling on the right and F. on the left, occurred\nthat most remarkable phenomenon, the bulging of Eusapia's\ndress, which took place in full light when her hands were\nvisible to all, and she showed us that the controllers were\nholding different feet and that there was no mechanism under\nher dress (see C.'s description of foot control and B.'s note\nto seance VII.). Therefore Mr. Podmore has clearly omitted\nto notice that these intervals were not unproductive.\nMr. Podmore concludes further\n(2) That at these three seances as a rule she preferred to make\nuse of her right limbs.\nThe words \" as a rule\" would imply that sometimes she made\nuse of her left limbs. There is an inconsistency here with\nhis assertion at the end of his criticism.\nFor the three most successful test seances [V., VI., VII.] all\nthat we need assume is the deception of a single person [i.e. B.,\nwho controlled Eusapia's right limbs] and a single sense\u2014and that\nthe sense of touch.\ndeferring to the same portion of his criticism, I read\n(2) That at these three seances, as a rule, she preferred to\nmake use of her right limbs. Whether this performance is character-\nistic of her seances generally I am unable to say ; but the Committee\nof the Institut General Psychologique reported that Eusapia suffered\nfrom a painful corn on her right foot, which rendered her intolerant\nof the more effective control of that foot, viz. by placing it under\nthe foot of the controller.\nI do not know what object Mr. Podmore had in making\nuse of this sentence unless it is that he wishes his readers to\ninfer that Eusapia was intolerant of her right foot being\n1 See my previous foot-note regarding Mr. Podmore's limitation of the words\n\" the deception of a single person \" to B.\n\f218 Journal of Society for Psycliiccd Research. Feb., 1910.\ncontrolled in this manner at these three seances. I have just\nquoted above C.'s report of his control of Eusapia's foot\n(Seance V., 10.13) in which he makes use of these words,\n\" I have my left foot on her right clearly.\" This shows that\nthe inference of her intolerance in this respect, at these three\nseances, is incorrect.\nFor another occasion on which the medium's right foot\nwas under the controller's left foot, see seance I., 11.44 (F. My\nleft foot was pressing strongly on hers).\nMr. Podmore goes on to say :\n...\nSetting aside the simpler and commoner phenomena\u2014levitation\nof tables, bulging of medium's dress, movements of curtains, thumps\nand raps\u2014which are so difficult to isolate as not in any case to\nafford a crucial test\u2014I challenge the Committee to point to a single\nphenomenon (grasp of liaiid, transportation of object from cabinet,\nor appearance of head, hand, or other similar object) presented at\nthese three seances [V., VL, VII.] which could not be explained\non the assumption that Eusapia succeeded in freeing the right hand,\nor possibly, in some instances, the right foot.\nAs there was no difficulty in isolating the phenomena of\nlevitation of tables, bulgings of medium's dress, etc., at our\nseances, Mr. Podmore's setting aside of these as stated above\non this ground does not appear justified. Inasmuch as some\nof these occurred under the most crucial test conditions, I\ncannot set them aside when considering his challenge.\nThere appears to be an implication in the challenge ; it is\nthis : All the phenomena of the nature which Mr. Podmore\ninstances (grasp of hand, etc., etc.) were carried out by the\nright hand or right foot of Eusapia. This implication is for-\ntified by the sentence at the end of his criticism, in which\nhe says\n\u2014\" For the three most successful test st^^ances at any\nrate, all that we need assume is the deception of a single\nperson [who was controlling the right limbs of the medium]\nand a single sense, and that the sense of touch.\"\nNow, if it can be shown that phenomena of the nature\nmentioned in Mr. Podmore's challenge occurred at these three\nseances, which could be explained on the assumption that\nEusapia succeeded in freeing her left hand or possibly her left\nfoot, the implication falls to the ground.\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia PaUadino. 219\nI proceed to bring forward some of the.se phenomena\nSeance V., 11.38. \u2022\n-\nC. I hold it [my hand] about two feet above her [medium's]\nhead. . . .\nC. Now I feel a hand pushing against my right hand.\nF. Her left foot on my right. My left hand on her knees.\nC. Again a liand pushes my right hand ;\nagain a hand pushes\nstrongly. I felt resistance as I pressed the curtain\ngently.\nB. Her right hand in my left hand on the table. . . .\nP. Her two hands are at least two feet apart.\nNote.\u2014(F. had previously reported that he had hold of her\nleft hand, but it was not stated that her left hand was visible\nnor where it was.)\nSeance VI. after 12.6 a.m. F. stands to the left of C. [who controls\non left of medium] and leans over with his left hand outstretched\nabout 2i- feet above and to the left of the medium's head. Immedi-\nately after\nF. I am touched by something coming straight on the points of\nmy fingers.\n12.11 a.m.\nF. I am touched again, I am taken hold of by fingers and I\ncan feel the nails quite plainly.\nC. Her head pressing against my head. I am absolutely holding^\nher left hand on the table.\n3. I am absolutely certain that her right hand is on my left\nhand on her right knee.\nNote.\u2014Her left hand not stated to be visible.\nSeance VI., 12.17. F., C. and B. see a white thing over\nEusapia's head and immediately after a hand pulls B.\n12.19.\nC. At that time I had hold of her left hand in my right on\nmy corner of the table and I could feel her arm up as\nfar as the elbow ...\n^ Should Mr. Podmore say that Eusajjia could Bot have had her left hand\nfree, as C. reported that he was holding it, I would reply that Eusapia could\nnot have had her rigJit hand free whenever B. reported that he was holding it.\n\f220 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nB. Her right hand was resting on my left hand on the table\nand I was holding her thumb.\nHotc.\u2014Her left arm and hand not stated to be visible.\nFrom the above considerations it will be seen that Mr.\nPodmore's implication that all the phenomena at these three\nseances were carried out by Eusapia's right hand, or right foot,\nis an incorrect one. He should have challenged the Committee\nto point to a single phenomenon (grasp of hand, etc., etc.) pre-\nsented at these three seances which could not be explained on\nthe assumption that Eusapia succeeded in freeing her right or\nleft hand or, possibly in some instances, her right or left foot.\nI now proceed to consider the challenge. Mr. Podmore excludes\nlevitations of the table, bulgings of medium's dress, bulgings of\ncurtains, thumps and raps, and also other phenomena, e.g. move-\nments of objects in the cabinet. The challenge to have been\na complete one should have included these, as they occurred at\nthese three seances, and they are as much phenomena as those\nto which he wishes the challenge to be restricted, and they\nshould be taken into consideration when endeavouring to arrive\nat a correct conclusion as to whether phenomena of the nature\nthat he mentions, and other phenomena, could have been\nexplained on the assumption that Eusapia succeeded in freeing\nthe right hand or the right foot.\nI will enumerate some phenomena which will meet the\nchallenge in the restricted form and also in the complete form\nwhich should have been adopted by Mr. Podmore.\nSeance V., 11.51. Transportation of small table from cabinet\nbetween the left of medium and F.\nJVote.\u2014Eusapia was visible and motionless while this was\ngoing on. Her legs under the seance table. Her back towards\nthe cabinet. The back of her chair between her and the cabinet.\nNo possibility of substitution of hands or feet. I reported at\nthe time that her right was in my left resting on the table and\nher right foot on my left, and that I felt her knee against my\nknee. Assuming that her right hand, or right foot, was free,\nit was a physical impossibility to effect the transportation with\nher right hand, or right foot, on the left side of the medium in\nthe manner that it took place.\n\fFeb., 1910.

Her hand was about 2J- feet from the curtain and her foot\non mine as before.\nB. Same control as before [i.e. her right hand was on the table\non my corner and visible. My left hand on her two\nknees and her right foot on the toes of my left foot].\nHer back was at least a foot from the curtain.\nJSfotc.\u2014The meditiDi sat motionless, her legs .under the seance\ntable. Both her hands were visible at the time, therefore her\nright hand was not employed in the production of this pheno-\nmenon, and it was a physical impossibility for her to make the\nleft-hand curtain come out and cover F.'s chair with her right\nfoot even if it were free. The seance table being turned broad\nways towards the medium, F.'s chair was not in close proximity\nto her (see diagram, p. -468 of our report).\nAfter 10.30, about 10.33.\nF. Immediately after she held my hand out away from her\ntowards the small stool, which is somewhere (under the\ncurtains), I do not know where, and it jumped.\n10.33.\nF. Both her hands are free but cjuite visible. Her left foot is\non mine. ^\n.\nB. I also see both her hands, free, and both her knees, which\nare under the table, and her right foot is on my left\nfoot.\nNote.\u2014iSTot only were her hands visible but her knees also.\nThey were under the table between its narrow legs. Eusapia\nsat with her back to the cabinet. If her right foot had been\nfree it would have been impossible for her to use it (her legs\nbeing under the table in front of her) to make the stool\njnmp behind her inside the cabinet. She did not use her\nright hand as it was visible. . .: ! \u2022.\n\u2022\nTo a reader of our report who does not approach the con-\nsideration of the phenomena under the assumption that the\nMembers of the Committee were continuously hallucinated or\nthat they had lost their sense of touch, during the whole\ncourse of the sittings, the phenomena (which for their fraudulent\na2\n\f222 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. rKB.,i9lo.\nproduction would have necessitated the use of one of Eusapia's\nhands), at the seances V., VI., VIL, when B. reported that\nher right hand was in his left or that he was holding or\nfeeling her right thumb, would have offered evidence that\nEusapia did not use her right hand for their production.\nSee amongst others, e.g.\nSeance V., 11.38. Uusapia's right hand in B!s. A hand\npushes C.'s hand through curtain.\nSeance V., 11.51. Eusapia s right hand in B.'s. Small table\ntransported from cabinet between E.

(who\nis on left of medium) pulled by the hair of his head\nby a complete hand through the curtain ;\nbut to a reader who approaches the consideration of the\nphenomena under the contrary assumption evidence of this\nkind will be useless. The argument between him and the Members\nof the Committee would narrow itself to an assertion on his\npart (he not having been present at the seances) that they\nwere constantly hallucinated, or deceived, and on their part\n(they having been present) to an assertion that they were not.\nFiguratively speaking, it would be arguing along two parallel\nlines which can never meet.\nI now leave Mr. Podmore's challenge and proceed to comment\non his statements as to the conditions of control.\nIt will be noticed on perusing these statements that Mr.\nPodmore is very particular as to the precise wording of the\nvarious controls, and he places great importance on the difference\n(not in the nature only, but in the wording also) of the\ncontrol of the left and the right hand of Eusapia. As he is\nso hypercritical in this last respect I am reluctantly compelled\nto imitate him and to be equally hypercritical with regard to\nthe words which he alleges were used in the description of\nsome of the controls.\nHis first statement is to the following effect\nThroughout these three seances, whereas Eusapia's left hand is\ngenerally reported as lying in or being held or grasped by the hand\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Repm^t on Eusapia Palladino. 223\nof the controller on that side, the right hand as a rule is reported as\nresting on or lying on, or lying under, the other controller's left hand.\nThe difference, in view of Eusapia's known propensities for cheating\nby substitution of hands, is important.\nNote.\u2014jSTot once is it stated, during the whole course of\nthese three seances, that Eusapia's left hand is lying in the\nhand of the controller on the left. Not once is the statement\nmade that her left hand is grasjjed hy the controller on that\nside.\nOnly nine times (not as a rule) is it stated that her right\nhand was resting on the other controller's left hand. Not once\nis it mentioned that her right hand was lying on the con-\ntroller's left hand. Not once is it reported that her right\nhand was lying under the controller's left hand.\nMr. Podmore's next statement reads\nIt happens unfortunatelj^ that while the control of the left hand\nis generally stated precisely e.g. \" left hand held in my right visibly\non the table \"\u2014that of the right is often stated in general terms,\nsuch as \"Control perfect,\" or \"Control as before.\" Frequently at the\ncritical moment the statement is incomplete. Sometimes no state-\nment at all is forthcoming.\nNote.\u2014Only six times (not generally) is it stated that the\nmedium's left hand is held in controller's right visibly on the ted)le.\nOnly four times (not often) did B. use the words Control\nperfect. The controller on the left used the words \" my control\nis quite complete.\" The definite words \" Control as before \" were\nused 16 times by B., but Mr. Podmore omits to say that the\ncontroller on the left made use of the same words 12 times.\nThe statement was made incompletely by B. 17 times, but\nMr. Podmore omits to notice that it was made incompletely\nby the left controller also 17 times. As regards no state-\nment at all being forthcoming, I would observe that this\noccurred about an equal number of times on the left and on\nthe right.\nThe phenomena followed each other sometimes so rapidly\nthat there was not time to dictate the control, and when the\ncontrollers were able to do so, they were more intent on the\nsecurity of the control than on the precise words that they\nshould use in describing it.\n\f224 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nAs Mr. Podmore excluded from his challenge certain pheno-\nmena which offered good evidence for a supernormal force\nbeing at work, so in the above statements has he excluded from\nhis consideration B.'s descriptions of his best conditions of\ncontrol at seances V., VI., VII., when he reported that Eusapia's\nright hand was visible, that both her hands were visible, that\nher right hand was in his left visibly, that he was holding her\nthumb, that he was feeling her thumb, that he was holding\nher right hand in his left. Mr. Podmore's criticism consequently\nis defective and gives his readers a wrong impression as to\nthe severity, actually exercised by B. in his control of Eusapia's\nright hand.\nPtegarding his next statement. No. 3, which begins with the\nwords\n(3) On many occasions it is reported that the right hand curtain\nhas blown out over the controller on that side so as to cover his\nhead, or his hand in contact with Eusapia's right.\nI will say that I agree with Mr. Podmore's observations on\nthe imperfection of the report in recording some of the times\nthat the curtain was blown over, or remained on, or was\nremoved from the hand of the controller on the right ; but I\nwould observe that at the time that it covered my hand I was\nmost rigorous, assuring myself continually that it was the\nmedium's right hand by feeling her thumb, equally when her\nhand was on mine as when mine was on hers, also assuring\nmyself that it was a living hand by its warmth, movement\nand responses to my pressure.\n\u2022 On the one occasion (not on the many occasions, as Mr.\nPodmore says) that the curtain was blown over my head I\nimmediately removed it from that position (see V., 10.57\u201410.58\np.m.), and on the only occasion that it was placed between\nthe medium's and my hand, I at once took it from between our\nhands, felt her bare flesh, and squeezed her thumb (see seance\nVI., about 12.16 a.m.).\nIf all the phenomena at all the seances had taken place\nwith one of the controllers' hands under the curtain, then (on\nthe assumption that they had lost their sense of touch) Mr.\nPodmore's implied assertion that Eusapia had one of her hands\nfree would have weight ; but the majority of the phenomena\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 225\noccurred when the curtain was not covering one of their hands\nnevertheless Mr. Podmore condemns all the phenomena as non-\nevidential, even those which took place in full light, when\nboth the medium's hands were clearly seen and at the same\ntime her body was in view down to her feet, while the con-\ntrollers were assured by tactual examination or by their sense\nof sight that no mechanism was being brought into play and\nwhen it was certain that there was no accomplice. On these\nlast phenomena he has not a word to say (see my final note in\nthe Eeport for examples of these). ...\nI pass on to Mr. Podmore's next statement\n(4) Eusapia is reported as occasionally releasing one hand\nmomentarily and replacing it. This procedure is not reserved\nexclusively for the right hand. In seance V., for instance, (10.44|^\nand 11.36 p.m.) her left hand is twice released. But her right hand\nis released more frequently and to more purpose (see e.g. VI., 12.4,\n12.30 ;\nVII., 10.54). On each of these occasions after control is\nrenewed it is found that both Eusapia's hands are on her knees, the\nright hand lying on the hand of the controller on that side, the left\nhand held by the other controller. These of course are Eusapia's\nusual preliminaries for substitution of hands. And on each of these\nthree occasions the release of the hand was followed in a few\nminutes by the appearance of a \" head \" or nondescript object from\nbetween the curtains. At VI., 11.40 (about), the release of the right\nhand is followed as usual by a nondescript appearance from between\nthe curtains, but the right hand is reported on the table under the\ncurtain [and her left hand visible on the left controller's hand on\nthe table].\nThe letters \" e.^\/.\" in the parenthesis (see e.g. YL, 12.4, 12.30 ;\nYIL, 10.54) would imply that there were several other occasions\non which, after renewal of control of Eusapia's right hand, the\nmedium's and controllers' hands were in the positions that he\nmentions.\nThere was only one other occasion, VII., 10.59. I must\npoint out that at seance VII., 10.54, it is not stated that\nEusapia's right hand was released ; therefore Mr. Podmore should\nnot have included this occasion in his parenthesis, and conse-\nquently the appearance of a nondescript object at VII.,\n10.57\u201410.58 cannot be taken into account when referring to\na release of Eusapia's right hand. The words used in the\n\f226 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nEeport are :\n\" Medium asked if she could touch the curtain\nfor a moment, but she did not attach anything to it.\" It\nshould be noted that Mr. Podmore makes no mention (with the\nexception of VI., 11.40 about) of the occasions on which a head\nor nondescript object appeared from between the curtains when\nthere was no possibility of a substitution, as both the medium's\nhands were controlled apart, or separately, on the table, or\none hand was controlled on the table and the other on her\nlap (see seances VI., 11.47 (about)\u2014 12.17 to 12.19\u201412.40;\nVII., 11.30). All that Mr. Podmore's statement really amounts\nto is to show that on two occasions, at seance VI., 12.4 and\n12.30, when a head and nondescript object appeared (after\nrenewal of control of Eusapia's right hand), her hands and\nthose of the controllers were in a position that might have\nenabled her to carry out a substitution. That she did so he\ndoes not prove.\nMr. Podmore proceeds to say :\nIf the reader wishes to verify these statements, let him closely\nstudy the sequence of events in s6ance VII., 10.54 to end, and let\nhim endeavour from the record to make out the exact nature of the\ncontrol exercised on Eusapia's right hand at eacli point, its position,\nwhether on the table or in her lap, and whether or not it was held\nunder the curtain. The defects of control, it will be found, culminated\nin this stance. So did the phenomena.\nMr. Podmore is justified in pointing out the defectiveness\nof the report as regards its recording whether or not Eusapia's\nhand remained under the curtain at seance VII. (not from\n10.54 but from 11.17; see his statement No. 3 and my\ncomments on that statement), to end of this seance.\nBut his words\nLet him [the reader] endeavour from the record to make out the\nexact nature of the control exercised on Eusapia's right hand at\neach point, its position, whether on the table or in her lap,\nare misleading, for any reader who refers to the Eeport will find\nthat all B.'s descriptions of his control of Eusapia's right hand,\nwith the exception of ten, were quite definite. I think he will\nalso conclude that the control was adequate. Thus\nSeance VII. 10.54. [No phenomena, therefore no description of\ncontrol dictated by B.]\n\fFeb., 1910.

She holds my left hand with her right hand. She squeezes\nmy hand while this levitation takes place. My hand was\nalso on her knee in her hand.\nOne word on Mr. Podmore's last statement in his paper\nThe above considerations suggest that, for the three most successful\ntest seances at any rate, all that we need assume is the deception\nof a single person and a single sense\u2014and that the sense of touch.\nI would point out the inconsistency of using the words \" a\nsingle person,\" as, if Mr. Podmore's theory holds, obviously not\na single person but two people were deceived. Not only B. but\nalso C. sat on Eusapia's right at seances V. and VII., and\nphenomena took place at both seances at the time that C.\ncontrolled.\nMr. Podmore's conclusion as to the non-evidential value of\nthe phenomena of all our seances is based on an assumption,\nviz., that each of the members of the Committee was con-\ntinually hallucinated or deceived. This hypothesis has been\ndealt with, in anticipation, on pp. 341 to 344 of our Eeport.\nMr. Podmore's paper is an admirable example of special\npleading. He limits his analysis to three seances, confines his\ncriticism to phenomena depending for their evidential value on\nthe sense of touch of a single individual (B.), and passes over\nin silence not only the phenomena depending evidentially on the\nsame sense of the other members of the Committee, but also\nthe other phenomena of all the seances which did not depend\non that sense alone for their evidential value, but also on the\n\f228 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

For there were many cases in which Eusapia's\nhands as well as the whole of her body down to her feet were\nseen, and also cases when the hands were both seen and felt.\nMr. Podmore's method of criticism as applied to our Eeport^\nhas failed, as it does not take account of these last phenomena.'^\nW. W. Baggally.\nII.\n^\nMr. F. C. Constable's letter in the Journal for December,\n1909, on the recent experiments with Eusapia deserves atten-\ntion. It would certainly be very satisfactory if some fundamental\nchange in the conditions of the supposed \"manifestations\" could\nbe effected which should make their authenticity or otherwise\ndepend no longer on \" human \" but on \" material \" control. But\nwhile striving to attain this aim, we should not leave out of\naccount several circumstances which may have a decisive import-\nance. And first of all, we ought not to lay down a jjriori rules,\nbut to try and elicit them, {i.e. the rules which regulate the sup-\nposed \"phenomena\"), from apparently well-established facts. For\ninstance, it would be, I think, rash and anti-scientific to start from\nthe assumption that, if genuine, the \"phenomena\" must occur in a\ntolerably good light. For after all we know nothing about it,\ntheoretically speaking. What we are entitled to in this connection\nwill be only this : we have a right to try to ascertain from the\nevidence in our possession how many well-attested instances of\n\"phenomena\" occurring in the light we have on record already.\nAnd I believe the results of such an enquiry would be chiefly\nnegative. For what do we know, strictly speaking, of the amount\nof \" light,\" e.g., at D. D. Home's seances 1 We certainly have\nevidence that it was very poor in a good many cases, and, generally\nspeaking, we have but little precise information on this point. And\n\u2014as I had occasion to point out elsewhere\u2014I do not consider an\nordinary \" light \" seance of Eusapia's with the curtain to be much\nsuperior evidentially to a totally dark seance. There may of course\nbe exceptions\u2014and the recent Naples sittings may belong to that\ncategory\u2014but they will be rame aves.\n1 1 remind the reader of Mr. Podmore's words :\n\" I see no reason to doubt that\nthe criticism made [by me] of these seances [V., VI., VII.], will apply wiHia^\/.s\nmutandis to all the rest.\"\n-For the relative importance that I attach to these last phenomena for\nevidential purposes, as compared with other phenomena, see my final note in\nthe Report.\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 229\nSo much for the Editor's remark as to the desirability of a \"good\nlight.\" As to Mr. Constable's suggestion that in future experiments\nEusapia should be placed \" in a cage of the same material as that\nof the curtain,\" the objects to be moved remaining outside the\n\" cage \"\n\u2014why I think the idea is a very good one, and ought to be\ntried at the next opportunity. And perhaps E. P. will not always\ndecline to submit to some such test, as she unfortunately did\nat Cambridge.\nThis being so, 1 must still point out\n(1) That we have no proof nen deplaise to Mr. Constable\u2014that\nE. P. can affect objects through the curtain\u2014or rather curtains, for\nthere were two of them, leaving an opening in the middle. Most of\nthe things seem to have happened as if the medium bad one hand\nfree to produce them, and I see little or no evidence of direct\nsupernormal action through any material obstacle which was interposed.\n(2) And here another remark. \/\/ they are genuine, I am inclined\nto believe that some day we shall find that these strange \" manifes-\ntations \" are produced not so much by \" psychic force \" \u2014whatever\nthat may mean\u2014as by ephemeral, enigmatic protuberances projected\nmomentarily from the medium's body ;\nprotuberances of various\ndegrees of density\u2014from \" fluid \" to \" hand \"\n\u2014which spring inta\nexistence and vanish in the twinkling of an eye.\nIf so, we can easily understand :\n(rt) That light mai\/ have a deteriorating influence on those\nephemeral organisms (of course, just as it may not : one hypothesis\nbeing as probable as the other).\n(b) That material obstacles\u2014screens, etc. \u2014may present to such\n\" pseudo-limbs \" almost insuperable difficulties. For acting through\nthem would almost involve \"passage of matter through matter\"\u2014\nphenomenon for which we have no good evidence (just as we\nhave practically none for \" apports \").\n(c) That the phenomena would invariably occur in close proximity\nto the medium.\nI do not believe the existence of such \"pseudo-limbs\" to be\nalready established. I seriously doubt them to be \"facts in nature.\"'\nBut still I do see some evidence which makes me pause in my\nscepticism and suspend my judgment.\nBut, I repeat, if such things exist, the three circumstances I\nhave just pointed out, suspicious as they may be in themselves,\nbecome easily intelligible and lend themselves to a rational inter-\npretation.\n\f230 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 191o.\nAVe should therefore be careful not to lay down the standard to\nwhich the phenomena should, in our opinion, conform, but rather\nendeavour to find out a modus vivendi in which should be united at\nthe same time (a) the conditions apparently necessary for the\nproduction of the supposed \" manifestations,\" and (b) precautions\nsuflficiently stringent to make deception impossible.\nI see some grounds for believing such a compromise practicable,\nthough probably not very easy to achieve at once.\nSome people will perhaps think the laws which regulate such\nphenomena very unsatisfactory. So do I. I should much prefer\nithem to be altogether different. But many of the natural laws in\nforce on the surface of our planet are similarly unsatisfactory\u2014and\n-even distinctly bad\u2014at first sight. Many of us feel we could do\nbetter ; and yet we have to submit to these laws, and our protests\nare of no avail. \" Metapsychical \" laws may perhaps be of the same\nipattern.\nIn conclusion, may I say a few words about the report of the\nl^aples sittings printed in Proceedings, Part LIX. ?\nI think this report very remarkable. It is certainly one of the\nIjest, if not the best, that has ever appeared on the subject. No\nmore competent investigators than Messrs. Feilding, Baggally and\nCarrington could be desired ; the report is as full as it could be\nmade ; the precautions adopted seem to have been in many cases\nexcellent ; some of the \" supernormal \" incidents appear beyond the\npossibility of cavil ; and finally, the \" collective hallucination\n\"\nhypothesis is treated as it sliould be.\nThe only really serious objection that can be made is in my\nopinion the following : the foot-control seems to have been not quite\nadequate in some cases.\nIs it not a pity, for instance, that it was not more thorough in\nthe incidents described on pp. 553 and 564 1 Mr. Baggally, we are\ntold, was holding hoth the hands of the medium and yet experiencing\na series of touches and pulls through the curtain. I wish we had\n2}0sitive evidence this could not have been done by the medium's\nfoot. Mr. Baggally gives us his grounds for believing that this\ncould not have been the case (p. 565)\u2014but his reasons do not appeal\nto my mind as being quite irrefutable. I should prefer something\nelse\u2014and this \" something else \" in the present instance is missing.\nAnd so the best case of the series (so far as \" spirit-hands \" are\nconcerned) is spoiled. There are, it is true, other instances, but\nxione perhaps so striking.\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 231\nThe account of the seance in question (the eleventh one of the\nseries) has reminded me of one I had with Sambor in March, 1899.\nHere also a curtain was used, the medium sitting in the opening.\nThe room was lighted by a small lamp, shaded with books and\nturned very low (it was placed in a corner of the room on the floor).\nUnder these conditions, the medium's hands being grasped and\nvisible almost the whole time, his head being also visible\u2014in short\nthe hand and head control leaving almost ^ nothing to be desired\nnot only were two objects (a small album and a small log) brought\nupon the seance-table (the latter visibly coming down upon it\nalmost under my eyes, for an appreciable period of time, though,\nit is true, a very short one)\u2014but Sambor's left-hand neighbour\nexperienced a series of pulls and contacts which must have resembled\nthose described by Mr. Baggally. And yet, I confess, I was not\nparticularly impressed by these incidents. It has always seemed to\nme possible that the medium's foot may have had something to do\nwith them ; and here also, as in Mr. Baggally's case, lack of precise\ninformation as to the foot-control has been a most serious draw-\nback.\nI will add that after reading the Naples report, coming as it\ndoes on the top of the far less satisfactory Paris report and a series\nof isolated observations\u2014I feel that there is at last one of Eusapia's\n\"phenomena\" which, to my mind, is proved: I refer to her most\nremarkable table-levitations. I consider that after all these investi-\ngations the onus prohcmdi in this respect now devolves upon those\nwho maintain these levitations to be spurious \u2014not upon those who\nbelieve them to be authentic. This is already something.\nPeROVSKY-PeTROVO-SOLOvovo\nIII.\nThe following pages are written in agreement with Mr. Podmore's\nview that the Report shows how unsatisfactory such an investigation\nmust be, however good the investigators, under the conditions imposed hy\nthe medium. For these are such as in no case to preclude the\npossibility of fraud, which may be undetected even by skilful con-\njurers. It therefore becomes in order for an outsider to ask whether\nthe cogency of the evidence here presented on Eusapia's side is\nsufficient to outweigh the many suspicious circumstances so frankly\nstated by the Committee, including obvious attempts at trickery\n^ The \"almost\" refers to the personality of the controllers themselves. \u2014P.-P.-S.\n\f232 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\n{e.g. pp. 338, 383, 400, 543). It is a great thing to possess the\nshorthand report taken at the time, with its wealth of impartial\ndetail, and a comparison of this report with later accounts shows,\nincidentally, how impossible it is to remember afterwards exactly\nwhat took place at the moment. For example, I do not see how\nto make consistent with the shorthand report F.'s later notes about\nthe substitution of hands and the seizing of Mrs. H.'s wrist at\nSeance XI. (10.30 and 12.11.)\n(p. 540) Shorthand report :\n\" F. Substitution of hands !\nMrs. H. \/ thought that I still had hold of the medium's left hand.\"^\nLater note :\n\"I asked Mrs. H. if she held the medium's left. She said, 'No,,\nshe has made a snbstitution.' F.\"\n(p. 549) Shorthand report:\n\" F.

F.\"\nAgain, there appear certain discrepancies between the report and\nthe account given by Mr. Carrington (C.) in M'Clure's Magazine.\n(October, 1909). See below on the levitations of the table, the\ncold breeze, and the movements of the milking-stool.\nIn the report itself nothing strikes a careful reader more than\nthe incessant changes in the position of Eusapia's hands, feet, and\nlegs, {e.g. Seance V., 11.13-11.18, apparently four changes in five\nminutes; ox ibid. 11.28-11.30, three changes in two). And it is\njust the moments of change, whether announced by Eusapia or not,\nthat might provide the opportunity for the phenomena, Heeting as\nthese are. For example we have this entry at Seance VI.., 12.30 :\n\" F. She saw me holding my hand up against the cabinet waiting\nto be touched. She therefore let go of B.'s hand, saying that she\nwas going to do so, put her hand inside the curtain and took hold\nof mine through the curtain, saying 'This is my hand,' and she\nthen resumed hold of B.'s hand.\nC. I saw a head come out from the curtains slowly and within\nsix inches of my head, and it stayed out about two seconds and\nthen went back.\"\nNow between the moment when Eusapia took hold of F.'s hand\ninside the curtain and her resumption of B.'s, an appreciable time\n. , \u2022 , 1 Italics mine throughout.\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 233\nmust have elapsed. Would it not have been quite long enough\nfor the fugitive phenomenon observed by C. ?\nAgain in the remarks on Seance V. (p. 420) we read\n\"From 10.52 onwards there were a series of movements of the\nsmall table and of other objects behind the curtain, culminating at\n11.8 by the small table striking B. on the shoulder and upsetting\ncompletely, the medium being rigorously held, visible and motionless.\"\nThe inference might be drawn that this condition endured through\nthe sixteen minutes in question. But in the shorthand report we\nfind (pp. 428, 429) :\n\" 10.58. B. The curtain is still over my hand,\"\nevidently, from the report at 10.57, the hand which had been\nheld by the medium, so that one of hers would also be hidden and\nnot visible ihen. Moreover, from the reports at 10.54, 10.55, 11.0,\nand 11.4, it is clear that both her legs were incessantly in motion,\ne.g. one taken down off F.'s knees, then the two enclosing F.'s leg,\nthen the left \"kicking backwards and forwards,\" the right \"making\na rhythmic movement,\" and so on. It is after the little table has\nstruck B. at 11.8 that the medium appears to become motionless.\nBut the important point to note is what she was doing just before,\nwhen she was anything but that.\nThe holding at its best consisted of her feet being on their feet,\nher right hand being in B.'s left, imder the curtain, and her left hand\nTjeing held, not continuously, by F.'s right (cf. F. 11.0 with F. 11.5). ;\nIt is hard to understand how, under the circumstances, the Com-\nmittee can be \"absolutely certain\" which of Eusapia's feet is\ntouching theirs, except at the moments when they feel them with\ntheir hands. And this they cannot do continuously. When a woman\nis prepared to trick, as we know Eusapia is, it is surely impossible\nalways to tell merely by the pressure of her foot on yours, or yours\non hers, which one you have got. Moreover, it cannot but be felt\nsuspicious that the ladies, when searching Eusapia, found that her\nboots \"were only buttoned by the top button\" (p. 505). This certainly\nsuggests preparation for slipping her feet in and out, leaving the\nboots to keep their place meanwhile in contact with the controllers'\nfeet. If this were skilfully done it would be almost impossible for\na controller to detect, except by feeling with his hands or free foot,\nsince if he moved the foot that had been placed in contact with\nEusapia's he would run the risk of losing control. She might,\nin short, under certain circumstances, practically imprison a con-\ntroller's foot by her empty boot.\nEusapia's incessant motion helps, among other considerations, to\n\f234 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nmake it seem likely that, as Mr. Podmore appears to suggest, she\nsubstituted a dummy hand for her right during Seances V., VI.,\nand VII., when she got the curtain over the table, obscuring her\nright arm and B.'s left. The Committee note (p. 326) how skilfully\nshe can perform her ordinary substitution and how hard it is to\ndetect by touch alone. It is curious, too, when the curtain is thus\nover the table to read in the report (Seance V.): \"11.14. F. I\nhave got hotlh hands of the medium,\" and immediately afterwards,\n\"11.18. B. My right hand control was perfect.\"\nVarious other questions suggest themselves about the phenomena\nthat most impressed the Committee (see pp. 331-340).\nThese questions are put with the reserve incumbent on any critie\nnot present at the seances : they are intended chiefly to fix attention\non the inevitable, and important, gaps in the evidence available.\nPuips, p. 334 (4).\nOn one occasion it looks as though she might have employed a\nconfederate, and that is when the raps were made at the end of the\nlast Seance (XL), on a closed door into B.'s room (p. 554), \"the only\nreally evidential raps obtained throughout the whole series \"\n(p. 537).\nNow,\n((() There was no member of the Committee in B.'s room at the-\ntime.\n\u2022\n{h) From the plan facing p. 345 (Fig. III.) it appears that there\nwas another door from B.'s room leading out into the hall ; and\nthat this door was not locked. (Even if it had been, it could have\nbeen opened with a skeleton key.)\n(c) As the door from the seance room into B.'s, \u2014the door on\nwhich the raps were heard\u2014was \" permanently locked and secured\nwith tape \" (p. 345), it would not have been possible to detect the\nconfederate by suddenly opening it.\n(cl) The incident occurred at the very last of the seances, by\nwhich time Eusapia and her friends could have become thoroughly\nacquainted with the arrangement of the rooms and doors.\n(e) The close of the seance was plainly marked by the lights-\nbeing turned up and three of the company going into the room on\nthe other side (C.'s room). Apparently, however, Signor Zingaropoli,.\nEusapia's friend, (p. 536) remained in the seance room.\nNow might not Eusajjia have arranged with little risk for a\nconfederate to slip into B.'s room at the end of the stance, and>\nat some preconcerted signal, produce the noises she required 1\n\fFeb., 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 235\nIt may be significant that when Eusapia was asked by F. to\nrepeat the raps she appears to have failed, at least partially. But\nthe shorthand report ceases before this, and the notes of F. and\nMrs. H. are conflicting. F. says (December 20th), \" She made three\nor four gestures and no raps followed. Then she made a final\ngesture and a loud rap foUotved.\"\nMrs. H. writes (December Slth), to the effect that at first Eusapia\n\"failed to produce them\"\u2014(the raps) \u2014\"again,\" and then, after\nseizing the curtain, \" made the usual gestures and produced the raps,\nthoiogh feebly \"\n(p. 554).\nLevitations, p. 331 (1).\nIs there a single undeniable case of table levitation with no con-\ntact at all, and with the table remaining long enough in the air\nto preclude the possibility of its being tossed up or pulled up, and\nthen let go 1 I will take the three cases quoted by C. in M'Clure,\npresumably the strongest. In the first (Seance I. 11.44, M'Clure^\np. 670), it is obvious that there was a change of control when least\ndesirable. The quotation varies from the full S.P.R. report; but\naccording to either there was a change.\nAccording to the S.P.K. report, the medium must haA'e removed\nC.'s right hand from her knees at the critical moment ;\naccording to\nthe quotation she must have released her own right from F.\nS.P.R.

The medium's left hand grasped my right hand firmly and was\nover mine, mine being between hers and the table.\"\nThe quotation in M'Clure reads :\n\" The medium's right hand\ngrasped my left hand firmly.\"\nIn the second instance quoted (Seance II., 11.1), the control of\nthe feet seems most unsatisfactory, for they were not even felt as\non the controllers' feet, but only as touching them (11.0). (In\nM'Clwe there is, probably by mistake, \" F. My right hand was\nacross both her knees,\" instead of the reading in the S.P.E. \"My\nleft hand,\" etc. If this is not a mistake there was an important\nchange of control between 11.0 and 11.1. See the full report.)\nIn the third instance (IX. 10.2-3), when F. was on the floor\nholding both Eusapia's ankles, her two hands appear to have been\n\f236 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The shorthand report\nstates that Eusapia's hands were \"just touching the rim\" of the\ntable when it went up. F. adds (the next day): \"The table had\ntilted over a long way ... It then made a sudden jump with all\nfour legs oft' the ground. Experiment shows that if her knees were\nagainst both legs, a strong pull with both hands on the rim could\nproduce this effect.\"\nIt may be added that the table is both small and light (p. 345),\n-and that Eusapia is an exceedingly powerful woman.^\nObjects emerging from the caliinet, pp. 337-339 (12), (13), (14).\nMight not the \" white hands \" and \" black heads \" be produced by\nEusapia's own hand, either bare, or wraj^ped in her handkerchief,\nor in the curtain The Committee themselves call attention to\nthe suspicious appearance of some of the \" black heads \" (p. 338,\n483), and Mrs. H.'s description of one is very significant (Seance XL,\n11.34):\u2014\n\" The black object was decidedly covered with the curtain (not\nblack muslin). It (the curtain) came out on my side close to me,\nand it was tightly stretched over the object in which I distinguished\nthe same elongated hand seen at 10.54 p.m. The fingers seemed to\nimitate a profile like an omhre chinoise, the middle finger crooked\nlike a Roman nose, the folded thumb forming a chin.

But,\n(\u00ab) Skilful handling would have reduced the movement of the\ncurtain to a minimum.\n(6) It seems as though it must have been very hard to detect a\nslight movement of the black curtain in that dim light (Light III.),\nand from the angle where he was standing (see plan, p. 503).\n(c) Were not his eyes fixed on the passage of the clay outside the\ncurtain at the time 1\nThat Eusapia really could have got her left hand free is strongly\nsuggested by the shorthand report. The four hands\u2014her two, one\nof R.'s and one of F.'s\u2014were at first all together on the table\none curtain was right over the table (11.55), and one at least of <\nher hands was moving about. (\"12.22. li. Her left hand was\nstroking my wrist.\") Is it not quite possible that what R. thought\nwas her left hand was part of her right 1\nThe cold breeze and the curtain bulging, etc., p. 340 (18), p. 332 (2).\nC. (Note to Seance VI., p. 457) states \"it is almost impossible\nto conceive the elaborate apparatus that would be necessary to\nproduce all the effects observed by us.\" But the out.sider has to\njudge by the written record, and is forced to press the question\nwhether that evidence necessitates for the remaining phenomena\nanything more elaborate than the following\n(1) A dummy hand which could be made collapsible, and slipped\nbetween Eusapia's skin and her combinations, or between her stays\nand her shift.\n(2) A short indiarubber tube with a bulb at one end, and pos-\nsibly wired at the other. If this were hidden in her hair, she\nmight, one ventures to suggest, produce the famous \" breeze \" from\nthe scar under her tresses, by squeezing the bulb either with her\nhand or against the back of her chair (pp. 340, 421, 458,\nSeances V. and VI.). This breeze is generally known as \"the\ncold breeze,\" and C. in M'Clure says, \" when tested by a thermometer\nit has caused a fall of 3 or 4 degrees \"\n(p. 669). But in the S.P.R.\nreport the Committee note (p. 458) that \" a thermometer, held to\nher head, failed to record any lowering of the temperature.\" The\n\f238 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nexperiments referred to in APChire cannot, therefore, be taken as\nconclusive. At the end of the same article C. gives an account of\nthe remarkable effects he could produce with a similar tube. The\nappearance of innocent astonishment on Eusapia's part when he\nshowed her his skill is exactly what we might expect on the\nhypothesis that she is a cunning trickster, and used a tool of the\nsame kind herself.\nSince the above was written. Miss Johnson has told me that a\nsimilar suggestion had been made to her independently by Mr. W.\nS. Davis,! Secretary of the Metropolitan Psychical Society in New\nYork. He writes (New York Times, Oct. 17, 1909) that this effect\ncan be produced by the bulb being \"concealed under the dress close\nto the armpit, while the hose runs up the back under the dress,\nthence into the hair to the temple.\" Of course Eusapia could hide\nthe tube at some seances in one place, and at others in another.\n(3) A thin bladder made to fit the mouth-end of the same tube,\nand such that it could either be left to lie flat, or inflated by\nsqueezing the bulb (or possibly a second tube, with bulb and bladder\ncomplete). There appear to be many possible modifications of this\ndevice, from the ordinarj' \"Mysterious Plate-Lifter\" (which can be\ngot at a conjurer's shop), to more elaborate kinds, e.g. those used\nfor spraying scent, which have an arrangement of valves allowing\nfresh air to be drawn in through the bulb. By some such means\na thin bladder could be dilated to a considerable size, while, when\nnot distended, it could easily be tucked away. The descriptions of\nthe dress-swelling and curtain-bulging - seem exactly to suit the\neffect that might be produced by such a bladder, dilated at will.\nThe curtain is stated to \" balloon out in a round bulge \" as though\npushed out from behind. \"If we made a sudden grab at the bulge,\nno resistance was encountered, and the bulge subsided as though\n1 Mr. Davis has for many years made a study of the methods used by\nfraudulent mediums, and is himself an adept in reproducing them. See an\narticle by Dr. Hodgson in Proceedings S. P.R. , Vol. VIII. pp. 295-6, and\n302-7.\n-Mr. Davis, writing to Miss Johnson later (January 2nd, 1910), suggests\nthat \"the blowing out of the curtains may be explained by the use of a very\nthin rubber hose, about the thickness of a lead pencil, and painted black so\nas to be invisible, which is attached to a bulb, or possibly a small steel flask\ncontaining compressed air, under considerable pressure. The curtains are very\nthin, and it wouldn't take much air in motion to move them. It would be\nexceedingly difficult to detect this sort of trickery, for if the curtains were\nsuddenly parted nothing would be noticeable.\"\n\fFeb., 1910. The Nci'ples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 239\none had pricked the surface of a balloon \" (p. 333). The usual\nposition observed for the bulge, not far from Eusapia's head, and\n\"about 4 ft. from the floor\" (pp. 380, 381) would appear to\ncoincide with the position required if the tube came from her back\nhair and was slipped through the opening of the curtains.\nIf the bladder were made detachable, it seems probable that the\ncurtain-bulging might have been produced by the same tube\nemployed afterwards for the breeze. For it is noticeable that this\nlatter phenomenon occurred at the dose of the seances when Eusapia\nhad no further use for the bladder.\nThe dummy hand and the tubes and bladder (possibly only one\ntube) appear to be all that she needed during Seance V. (when\nshe offered to be searched) or during Seances VI. and VIII., the\nonl}' two seances at which a search was made. And on neither\noccasion was it possible to make the search complete. For even at\nthe ladies' examination (p. 505) Eusapia was not entirely undressed,\nnor was her hair undone. She remained clothed in \"a pair of\ngrey, woolly, divided combinations ; that is to say, body and\ndrawers.\" A good deal could be hidden there. Moreover, she was\nallowed to undress herself: so that she had abundant opportunity as\nshe took off each of her numerous outer wrappings for slipping\nanything from one layer to the next beneath it.\nFor certain of the other seances she may have needed two other\nappliances, but,- so far as I can see, only two, and those of a simple\ncharacter, viz. :\n(4) A thin, dark, wire rod, about the thickness of a hairpin,\nhooked at one end, so that it could pull or push a light object\nsuch as the little table or the milking-stool (Seances II., IX., and\nXL, i.e. the seance before the third member of the Committee arrived,\nand the seances after the searchings were over).\n(5) Some phosphorus for the two Seances VII. and XL, when the\nlights were produced, p. 339 (17).\nAt Seance VII. (11.36-11.46) the lights appear cfter the medium\n\" puts her head behind the curtain and makes a sudden dive to\nthe right\": at Seance XL (10.55-11.1) after \"the left curtain came\nright over the table\" (10.54) and Mrs. H. had observed \"an\nelongated hand \" over which \" the curtain was tightly stretched.\"\nIt is true that for Seance VII. (11.46) we find the note \"There\nare no indications of the smell of phosphorus.\" But we have\nevidence from the able report on Carancini by Mr. Baggally (B.)\nthat the absence of the smell is no proof that phosphorus was not\n\f240 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., l9io.\nused. See Journal S.P.R., Jan. 1910, p. 199. During Seance V.,\nwhen the lights appeared, we have this entry :\n\" Mr. Scott and\nMr. Baggally Avent into the cabinet immediately afterwards and did\nnot perceive any smell of phosphorus.\" But at the close of the\nseance B. searched Carancini (p. 203), and \" found in his pocket\na box of safety matches, and amongst them a few phosphorus\nmatches.\" One of these he dexterously abstracted and produced\nwith it \" lights which were in all appearances identical with those\nthat had been seen at the seance.\"\nDress-swelling, p. 333 (3).\nThe best example of this was at the beginning of Seance VII. in\nthe brightest light, \" the only seance at which we had an oppor-\ntunity of careful observation of it \" (p. 334). If Eusapia had the\nindia-rubber tube on this occasion tied round her waist by a string,\nmight she not, when she sat down, have arranged it through her\nplacket-hole so that the bulb was between the back of her chair\nand her thigh, while the bladder lay among her petticoats ? Then\nmight not a slight pressure with her thigh have done the rest ?\nWhen she prepares to lift her dress and petticoats for inspection,\nshe could hitch up the tube and sit on it, and she would, in the\nhands of English gentlemen, be quite safe from detection.\nMovements of tlie little table, p. 335 (8).\nMost of these can be explained on the quite possible supposition\nthat Eusapia got one hand or foot free, but there remains one case\nwhere this seems unlikely, viz. Seance II., 11.55 S., when it retired\nfrom her in \" a series of little jumps.\" Now, is it impossible for her\nto have produced these motions undetected, by means of a wire\nrod on the floor ? The movements were continued in Light I., but\nthey began in Light IV., venj dim, and were preceded hy a request\nthat her feet should be untied, which would constitute a serious\ndiversion. Tliat the phenomenon should take place in the best\nlight cuts against the argument that darkness is really bad for the\nsupernormal force. On the other hand, that it should be jrreceded\nby a period of great dimness strongly suggests trickery, for the\nmoment of arranging the connection between herself and the table\nwould be the moment most dangerous for discovery. C. (p. 371)\nsaw that \"there was no contact between the medium's foot and the\ntable,\" but apparently he did not feel along the floor between it\nand her to discover if there was any other connection. Nor can he\n\fFeb., ]91o. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 241\nbe blamed for not doing so, since he would have had to lose control\nof her for the time (only F. and C. being present at this seance).\nThis illustrates\u2014what is frequently illustrated throughout\u2014the fact\nthat under the conditions imposed by the medium the controllers\nmust often be as much hampered by her as she by them.\nTwanging of the guitar, p. 335 (7).\nFirst Case. Seance II., about 12.3. Is it out of the question for\nher to have plucked the string with the hooked wire already used\nfor the little table? (See the last paragraph on II., 11.55.) C. says,\np. 373, that her feet were controlled, but on p. 372 we find (as noted\nby himself and F.) that \"the foot-control is omitted\" in the report.\nIt is true they add \" owing to the excellence of the light, however,\nwe could clearly see that her feet were not employed.\" But,\n(1) The light, though their best, could not be called brilliant,\nfor it was shaded and contrasted (p. 361 fin.) with the \"bright\nlight \" in the next room.\n(2) Eusapia's \"knees and feet were towards the seance table,\" and\ntherefore, presumably, in its shadow, or even under it.\n(3) Both F. and C. were looking attentively into the dark cabinet\nbehind her (p. 371 fin.), and therefore it is hard to understand how\nthey could see what she was doing with her feet at the critical\ntime.\nThere was a good opportunity for her to secrete the rod imme-\ndiately afterwards, for we read (p. 372, just before 12.5):\n\"F. The medium says that she wants to touch the small table\nin the cabinet. She raises it from the floor and puts it upside\ndown and closes the curtains.\"\nSecond Case. Seance VI. (p. 457. Note by C.)\nThis occurred\n(1) After the shorthand report ends.\n(2) When they thought the seance was over, and therefore could\nnot have been controlling her so carefulh\\\n(3) When B. and M. were talking.\n(4) When Eusapia might have imitated the slight sound of the\ntwanging that they heard. That she does imitate sounds is the almost\ninevitable inference from the \"kiss\" episode, see Seance VII., 12 p.m.\nMovements of the curtains, p. 332 (2).\nThe tmJging has already been discussed, and it is not suggested\nthat anything else was produced by the device of the bladder.\nBut the other movements seem susceptible of other explanations.\n\f242 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., i9io.\nFor instance, she might have pulled the curtain with her own\nhand, as B. actually cauglit her doing with the very hand that\nF. was controlling at the time (Seance VIII., 12.43, Note by B.).\nOr she might whisk it out with the help of the rod on the floor,\na method suggested by the account of the curtain movements at\nthe beginning of Seance XL, considered by F. to be the most\nevidential he had seen. These occurred in the best light ; and\nat 10.11, F., seated on the medium's right, had made a clear\nspace of about 12 in. between her foot and the right curtain. But\nsince then ;\n\u2014\n(1) There had been some moments of less light (10.18).\n(2) Eusapia had made a request for the little stool, which would\ncause some diversion.\n(3) The only control mentioned for hands or feet is that F. held\none of her hands, and that one foot, presumably her right, was\non his.\n(4) Her dress had bulged out towards the curtain between her\nchair and F.\nIt seems possible, therefore, that she might have got the wire rod\nlaid aslant on the floor, at her other side, where F. could not see\nit, one end being under her left foot, and the other slipped in\nthrough the opening behind the edge of the right curtain. A jerk\nwith her left foot might then have produced the effect he observed,\nwhen \"the whole of the left edge of the right curtain rushed out\nand completely enveloped her right side.\"\nMovements of the little stool, p. 339 (16).\nI take the strongest cases.\n. (a) Seance IX., after 11.45 (pp. 514 ff.) when it moved along\nthe floor, in a poorish light, (the second Light II. = the original\nLight IIL)i\nHere, again, we must ask what security we have that there was\nno connection between the medium and the stool when it was\nmoving 1 \"Examination for an attachment of some kind was made\nin the intervals between movements of this kind \" (p. 339). But that\nis not enouah ; since it is conceivable that Eusapia could jerk the\nconnection away when she saw the investigator preparing to examine.\nThe examination by M., the stenographer, was made (p. 514)\niThis light is called \"very good\" ad loc, but see pp. 419, 355. In the first\nLight II., which ivas brighter, the room was so dark that the reflection on a\npatent leather shoe looked like a mysterious light on the floor, (p. 355.)\n\fFeb., 1910. The Nafples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 243\nwhen the stool \" had finished.\" M. was sitting at another table\n(plan, p. 508), and had to leave his place for the purpose. And\nno doubt Eusapia would say that any interposition during the\nmovements would impede \" her fluid.\" According to the Eeport,\nit was only M. who examined the stool at this Seance, and in this\ninconclusive fashion (cp. also XL, 10.23). There were previous motions\nof the little stool outside the cabinet, IX. 10.30-10.40, but in a still\npoorer light, (Light IIL), and this when the foot control was\nobviously weak, (see B. 10.30 and C. 10.33), and when C. notes\nthe day after, \" I was dissatisfied at the time with the sensation of\nthe hand control (10. 34).\" On the other hand, at the beginning\nof Seance VIL, when the conditions were more exacting, when the\nlight had not yet been lowered, and when F. could report, \"I have\nfelt several times between her and the stool right along the\nfloor, . . . and since I have passed my hand between her and the\nstool she has not touched the curtain in any way,\" then we find\nthat nothing happened, except the bulging of her dress.\" \" TAe stool\ndid not move. F. December 8th, 1908.\" Later on (VIL, 10.30) the\nstool did move, but meanwhile there had been a \" relaxation of\ncontrol \" when \" the seance table was being turned round,\" and\nthe stool was now invisible '\u2022\nunder the curtains \" (F. 10.33).\n(5) Seance XL, 12.26, when the stool climbed up the curtain.\nThe control here is not given in full, (see 11.49, p. 548), so\nthat the whole episode might be dismissed as non-evidential. But,\ntaking the report as it stands, there appears a strong presumption\nthat the stool was hoisted by Eusapia's left hand, working inside\nthe curtain at the point where the stool touched it. I should\njudge from experiments I have made that this would be quite a\npossible feat, if part of the bottom of the curtain were held taut\nat a certain angle. Now it is very rash to suppose that Eusapia\ncould not have got at least one hand and foot free, because :\n(1) Only Z. (her friend) and Mrs. H. were controlling her at the\ntime.\n(2) The curtain had just been over the table (12.15).\n(3) The hght was very dim (Light IV. shaded), so dim that M.,\nstanding between the medium and Mrs. H., had to feel their arms\nand hands to make sure of their position. When M. felt the medium's\nleft hand later it was too late to be conclusive, because by that time\nthe stool must have been over Mrs. H.'s shoulder. Even so, Eusapia\nwas evidently annoyed at M.'s attempt.\n(4) No foot control is mentioned at all after 11.49.\n\f244 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Feb., 1910.\nM. felt on either side of the stool as it was climbing up, \" hut\nnot between the stool and the curtain, as I ivas afraid of interfering with\nthe movements,\" (which no doubt he would have done). He then\nadds, \" there was nothing tangible behind it.\" But as it was too\ndark for him to see, and as he would not feel, it is not easy for\nan outsider to accept this inference.\nThe touches on B.'s hade outside (Jie curtain, p. .3.36 (10).\nSeance X., 12.11-12.20, and Notes by F. and B., pp. 533 535.\nThese touches occurred in the total darkness, a darkness that corre-\nsponded suspiciously with the presence of a photographer. At 12.11\nF. caught Eusapia's hands in the \" substitution position.\" F., in the\nkindness of his heart, is inclined to attribute this to \"weariness or\ncarelessness \" on her part, because she showed him \" the position of\nher left hand, which was under B.'s right. B. stated that it had\nbeen there all the time.\" But the last time B. stated his control\n(11.42), her left hand was in his left, and his rigid was on the back\nof her neck. Even if there was no substitution, might not the\ntouches have been produced by the wire hooked on to some part of\nEusapia's person ' '\"\nThe touches on B. during Seance XL, 12.51 and later (pp. 552, 564.\nSee also (11), p. 337).\nNow, (1) These occurred after the control was no longer to be\ngiven in full (11.49).\n(2) The light\u2014(No. IV. shaded)\u2014from 10.58 onwards was so dim\nthat F. when sitting next to the medium could not see the individual\nfingers of her hands.\nB. thought he could see both hands at 12.51, but he was not\ntouching both, and in that dimness would it be possible to distinguish\nhy sight alone a dummy hand from a real one?\n(3) B. did not hold both Eusapia's hands until after 12.56, when the\ncurtain was blown over the table. Then he only held her thumbs, so\nthat her fingers were free. After that, it is scarcely surprising that\na hand from inside the curtain played with B.^\nF.

On the other hand, the total loss in\nnumbers from deaths,^ resignations, and other causes was 20\nMembers and 102 Associates, leaving a net increase of 40.\nThe total membership has now reached 1230, the numbers\nbeing distributed as follows: Members, 300 (including 25\nHonorary and Corresponding Members); Associates, 930 (in-\ncluding 12 Honorary Associates).\nA general increase in activity has also been evinced by the\nfact that three Parts of Proceedings have been published this\nyear, in February, June and November, amounting to 782 pp.,\nwhereas last year (1908) only two Parts appeared, in June\nand October, amounting to 686 pp., and the year before (1907)\ntwo Parts, in February and October, amounting to 318 pp.\nThe papers published this year included two reports on the\ntrance phenomena of Mrs. Piper ; the first by Professor James,\nchiefly relating to the sittings in America that took place\nshortly after Dr. Hodgson's death (that is, during the first half\nof 1906) in which a number of communications purported to\ncome from him. The second report by Sir Oliver Lodge dealt\nwith his sittings with Mrs. Piper in England at the end of\n1906, and the spring of 1907, the intermediate period having\nbeen already dealt with by Mr. Piddington in his report in\nProceedings, Vol. XXII.\nSince Mrs. Piper's return to America, a series of sittings\nwith her on behalf of the S.P.E. has been held by one of our\nVice-Presidents, Mr. G. B. Dorr. Some of the results of these\nsittings were reported by Mr. Piddington at a meeting of the\nSociety in October, and several papers on them will be\npublished in the forthcoming part of Proceedings.\nMeanwhile Miss Verrall has been working over the volumi-\nnous unpublished records of earlier Piper sittings held by Dr.\n^ It happens that we have lost an unusually large number throuf;h death\nthis year, viz., 6 Members and 19 Associates, total 25; whereas last year the\ntotal number of losses from this cause was 14, which was larger than usual.\n\f250 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

Mak., 1910.\nHodgson in America, which were sent over to England after his\ndeath, and a paper on these is now nearly ready for publication.\nMrs. Verrall and the other automatic writers, between whom\nand Mrs. Piper so many \" cross-correspondences \" have occurred,\nhave been continuing their script, with results which will be\nreported to the Society from time to time. As stated by\nMrs. Verrall at a meeting of tlie Society in May, some cross-\ncorrespondences also occurred between Miss Verrall's and her\nscripts, and those of a new group of automatic writers hitherto\nunknown to any of the others. Mrs. Verrall's paper on this\ncase will be included in the forthcoming part of Proceedings.\nPart LIX. contained the full report of the Naples sittings\nwith Eusapia Palladino, of which Mr. Feilding gave a summary\nat the meeting of the Society in June. Some criticisms of\nthis report have since appeared in the Journal and the discus-\nsion is to be continued.\nIn July and August some sittings were held with the\nItalian medium, Carancini, who was alleged to produce \" physical\nphenomena \" of the same general type as those which are said\nto occur with Eusapia. The results of these sittings, however,\nwere disappointing ; not only because they presented no evidence\nof any genuine phenomena, but also because there was definite\npositive evidence of fraud on the medium's part. Mr. Baggally,\nwho was in charge of the sittings, gave an account of them\nat the last meeting of the Society, and his account is printed\nin the Journal for January, 1910.\nDuring the year a legacy of \u00a3100 was left to the Society\nby the late Mr. Eobert Hannah, who died on April 5th, 1909.\nMr. Hannah had been a member for many years and was\ndeeply interested in the work, to which he had generously\ncontributed for several years an extra annual subscription.\nThere are a few points in the balance sheet for the year\nwhich may be noted. On the one side we have\u2014in accordance\nwith the increase in membership of the Society\u2014an increased\nincome from annual subscriptions, which amounted this year\nto about \u00a388 more than last year. It is also gratifying to\nobserve that the sale of our publications to persons not belong-\ning to the Society brought in nearly three times as much\nthis year as last, viz., \u00a3128 instead of \u00a344. This seems to\nindicate a general growth in the interest taken by the public\n\fMae., 1910. Report of the Council. 253\nin our work. On the other hand, corresponding to an increased\noutput of publications, our expenses for printing and postage\nhave increased, being \u00a3181 more this year than last. There is\na prospect that this item will continue to grow as time goes\non, and while it should be possible always to meet the\nprinting expenses from the annual income from subscriptions,\nthe research work, which leads to the greater part of these\nexpenses, will also, it is to be hoped, constantly increase, and\nresearch in some cases involves other expenses. The Council\ndesire, therefore, to remind members that the Endowment\nEesearch Fund has not yet reached the \u00a38000 which they\nfixed as its first goal, and that further contributions to it\nwill be gratefully received.\nTwo General and four Private Meetings of the Society (for\nMembers and Associates only) were held during the year. The\ndates and subjects of the papers read were as follows\n*January 28th. \"Preliminary Report on Mrs. Piper's\nHodgson Control,\" by Professor William James.\nMarch 30th. \"Some Incidents in the Script of Mrs.\nHolland,\" by Miss Alice Johnson.\nMay 18th. \"A New Group of Automatic Writers,\"\nby Mrs. A.

Baggally.\nTHE EDUCATION OF AN OBSERVEE.\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\nA NOTABLE paper by Miss Johnson appeared in the Proceed-\nings, Vol. XXL, under the title \" The Education of the Sitter,\"\na head under which she usefully criticises certain records of\nobservations of physical phenomena ;\nregarding them\u2014either\nnaturally or artificially, that is to say either in her own proper\n* Those marked with an asterisk were General Meetings.\n\f254 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1910.\nperson or as a useful exercise\u2014from the point of view of\nthe extreme sceptic. I have nothing to find fault with in\nthe paper ; it is well adapted to its purpose, which I presume\nis to urge whatever can be urged against the accounts which\nhave been given hitherto of the observation of supposed super-\nnormal physical phenomena, so as to assist future records to\nbe of a more complete and more obviously trustworthy\ncharacter.\nBut there are two points on which I think her article\nneeds supplementing, since without some supplement it may\nbe misleading.\nOne is that she appears to think an observer worse instead\nof better for continual opportunity for observation, because he\nis liable to become sophisticated by habit ; whereas her real\nmeaning doubtless is that this only applies to observers who\nare insufficiently critical and too easily convinced ; inasmuch\nas they are liable to observe less and less well as they go on,\nso that their accounts become less and less reliable.\nThe other point is that she seems hardly to discriminate\nsufficiently between the reports of a skilled practitioner and a\nnovice\u2014meaning by a novice not a novice in everything, but\na novice in the art of making and learning from experiment.\nThe most learned moral philosopher\u2014the most astute man\nof letters\u2014may be a novice if immersed in the intricacies\nof a laboratory. If he is wise he will keep his hands in\nhis pockets and not attempt to meddle. It used to be amusing\nto see an examination candidate sometimes automatically assume\nthis attitude in a junior practical examination. It was a sure\nsign that he had learnt from text-books and blackboard draw-\nings ; he might answer questions on paper fairly well, but of\ninstruments themselves he had a marked and well-grounded\nmistrust. An experienced experimentalist is not in this\npredicament, since he is accustomed to manipulate and deal\ncritically with phenomena and to draw deductions from them.\nMiss Johnson's reply to this will doubtless be that even\nscientific experimentalists are novices when they enter the\nregion of psychical research, and must be treated as such\nuntil they have had experience in this particularly treacherous\nfield. Their special aptitude and skill will make them quick\nto realise features of importance, but will not guard them\n\fMai?., 1910. The Education of an Observer. 255\nagainst deception. For this kind of investigation it is indeed\noften urged that an expert must be an expert oA hoc, and\nthat general scientific training is not sufficient ;\n\u2014that the\ntraining of a conjurer is better.\nI do not wish to contest that position,\u2014both kinds of training\nare certainly useful ; but I do feel that a man of science has\nan undeniable advantage over\u2014let us say\u2014a man of letters\nor a philosopher, in the particular matter of learning by direct\nobservational experience, whatever other comparative disadvan-\ntages may fall to his lot. And if he cares to devote his\nenergies to psychical research for a moderate time he ought\nbefore long to become an expert in that field also.\nHowever I do not propose either to discuss or criticise Miss\nJohnson's paper in detail\u20141 only propose to supplement it\nand I can do so most readily and compactly by making a\nshort and independent communication of my own. And in\nso doing I would explain that I have in my mind her few\nremarks on the testimony of Sir William Crookes, rather than\nher criticism of observations made by Lord Adare. The latter\ngentleman is not known to me, but I presume that he would\nnot claim to be an observer with the training of a man of\nscience.\nThe title Miss Johnson uses for her paper will serve my\nturn\u2014only slightly modified so as to make it more general\nand not applicable to psycho-physical investigators alone.\nIt must be admitted that however great the intellectual\ncompetence of a man of letters may be, he is not accustomed\nto the examination and discovery of truth by means of physical\nexperiments. A training in this special kind of observation is\nsurely necessary for the formation of a valid and secure opinion,\nin addition to the natural powers of an educated mind. Take\nsuch a person into an ordinary physical laboratory for instance,\nand show him an experiment of any delicacy ; it is quite\npossible that he will see nothing at all. He certainly will\nnot be able to interpret what he sees without guidance, and\nit will not be difficult to guide him wron\" Knowing this,\nhe will mistrust his own judgment,\u2014he will not think of\nexpressing a first-hand opinion; and if\u2014to suppose something.\n\f256 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. Mae., l9io.\nabsurd\u2014he is asked to report on the phenomena in a respon-\nsible manner, he will necessarily be ultra-sceptical and hard\nto convince of anything whatever. Amid so many loop-holes\nfor error, under such strange surroundings, the circumstances\nwill necessarily call out a degree of caution which cannot be\nstigmatised as excessive. In some instances even the trained\nphysicist will have lost his bearings and feel on strange\nground. In that case he too will, if he is wise, be extremely\ncautious. But when he is on familiar territory, he knows fairly\nwell what to look for, and is ready to draw inferences, with\ncaution indeed but without excessive compunction. Every\nman of science makes inferences which to men trained in\nother branches\u2014even in other sciences\u2014will seem to be rapid\ninduction based upon instinct rather than upon complete\nevidence. The facts which led Dalton to the atomic theory,\nfor instance, would not have led the ordinarily educated man\nanywhere. Ordinary men live surrounded by phenomena of\nwhich the scientific meaning and theory is quite unknown to\nthem. The very same facts, to the trained intelligence specially\ndirected to them for months or years, may be full of signi-\nficance. No stigma\u2014nothing odious\u2014is conveyed by such a\ncomparison. The score of a symphony is one thing to a\nskilled musician ; it is another thing and nearly meaningless\nto a man in the street.\nEven a practised observer like Faraday, a man who lived\nin a laboratory all his life and worked constantly with his\nown hands\u2014even Faraday when taken to a new experiment\nasked to be told \" what he had to see \" before sitting down\nto it ; and he never considered himself capable of seriously\ncriticising an observation until he had himself witnessed the\nexperiment which demonstrated it. He knew well what a\nmultitude of things might confuse the observer ;\nhe knew how\ndifficult it is to see a phenomenon for the first time,\u2014how\ncomparatively easy the repetition becomes. Instruction from\nthe man who was familiar with the particular experiment,\nand a hint as to what the precise point was that constituted\nthe novelty, was sought\u2014even by him.\nHow then can it be supposed that an observer or sitter can\ndispense with education ? How can it be thought that his\nfirst and unaided impressions are likely to be the best ?\n\fJlAK., 1910. The Education of an Observer. 257\nIf it be urged that every one is a novice in a strange field\nfor some time after he has entered it, I agree. Great and\npatient care must be taken not to be hasty either in coming\nto a conclusion or in publishing results ;\nacceptance on the\npart of a novice might easily be detrimental, and vi^ould not\nreally substantiate the phenomenon to which he prematurely\ntestifies. But still the converse remains true, that the novice\nin every kind of physical science feels himself at a still\ngreater disadvantage ;\nand, if wise, he is instinctively cautious,\nself-distrustful and sceptical. To learn direct from phenomena\nis not a common attitude of mind : the usual method is to\nlearn from books and from people. The exploration of nature\nat first hand is not a matter to be lightly and confidently\nundertaken ; and a person who had dealt chiefly with books\nwould find it necessary to be ultra-sceptical, in order not to\nbe credulous, when called upon to deal with things. Here I\nthink lies the explanation of some of the hyper-scepticism now\nprevalent concerning what are called \" physical phenomena,\"\nwhose basis is necessarily that of direct experimental observa-\ntion. They are facts extremely difficult to admit into any\nscheme of nature, since they seem to run counter to life-long\nexperience. They are indeed so extraordinary as to be repellent.\nThey cannot, I should judge, be legitimately accepted on second\nhand testimony. No testimony seems able to sustain them\nit can but establish a lyrima facie case for an open mind.\nNevertheless, both by physicists and physiologists, they have\nhad to be admitted as true, as a result of direct and repeated\nexperience ; and sooner or later their place in the scheme of\nthings must be found.\nMeanwhile it will remain difficult to demonstrate them.\nThe object of showing experiments to a learner is to\nillustrate something which is being verbally explained\u2014to\nmake the fact more real and living. Sometimes a diagram\ndoes better, and always the experiment must be simplified as\nmuch as possible. He must to a certain extent take things\non trust\u2014at least he cannot be supposed to be a competent\ncritic, and if unable to see some faint result when it occurs,\nhis failure proves nothing concerning it either way. Even if\nhe does see it, or imagine that he sees it, he will find himself\nnot permanently proof against the suggestion\u2014sometimes quite\n\f258 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mar., 1910.\nabsurd, but sometimes not unjustified\u2014of anticipatory hallucina-\ntion. Novices brought in to see the efi'ect of imaginary\nN-rays sometimes saw them. Skilled physicists from this\ncountry did not. The evidence of the novice\u2014however good\nit may really be\u2014is bound to be mistrusted even by himself.\nCall upon a spectator at a conversazione to inspect a\nphotograph of a spectrum which demonstrates, say, the magnetism\nof a sun-spot,\u2014and he will see nothing but a smear crossed\nby rather fuzzy streaks. The fuzziness is the essence of the\nphenomenon. How can he possibly form an opinion on what\nhe sees ? No one expects him to. He would feel bound to\ntake an agnostic attitude.\nThis is probably the reason why even orthodox scientific results\nare only half accepted by the public, until they have become\na matter of habit. If anything depends upon acceptance by\nthe public, that body is bound to be sceptical : it can -only\ntake new things on authority. We all take things to some\nextent on authority, except in the special and narrow field\nwhich we have ourselves investigated after a lifetime of training.\nEverybody has his own field, and outside that he is content\nto learn from others,\u2014subject always to his ordinary common\nsense, which enables him to judge and more or less clearly\ndiscriminate between authorities, if they confiict.\nConcerning this very matter of supernormal physical phenomena\nthere is decided conflict, and it is to the ordinarily trained\neducated man that appeal must be made.\nIf after due consideration people in general decide against\nthe reality of modern miracles\u2014as they have been called\u2014\nshall be entirely content. If the time is not ripe for their\nreception it is better that they be rejected for a season. Far\nbetter things than they have had to run the gauntlet of hostile\ncriticism and to bide their time.\nAll I would suggest is that meanwhile wise and responsible\npersons\u2014whatever their training may have been\u2014should not\ntoo strenuously or too assiduously deny the possibility of the\noccurrence of everything that has at one time or another been\nstyled miraculous. Some day we may have to discriminate,\nand to admit that some of them\u2014some few of them\u2014may\nhave really happened.\n\fMar., I'JIO. The Education of an Observer. 259\nNote on the above Paper.\nWith Sir Oliver Lodge's permission I add a few words to his\npaper in the same number of the Journal, \u2014not with a view to\ncombatting his general conclusions, with which I heartily concur,\nbut in my turn to supplement them, and also to make my own\nposition clearer.\nThe title of my paper was, perhaps, unfortunate, as it lends itself\nto his interpretation that an observer becomes worse instead of better\nfor continual observation. This no doubt happens sometimes with\nvery uncritical and careless observers ; but in speaking of the\n\"Education\" of the sitter, I was referring to the gradual develop-\nment in him of susceptibility to suggestion, \u2014either from the general\nenvironment or from the medium,\u2014and I think that no one who\nhas had much practical experience of sittings can doubt that such\na development is often liable to occur.\nSir Oliver Lodge shows clearly the necessity for practical training\nin observation before a man can become an expert observer, and\nremarks that even Faraday did not think himself capable of judging\na physical experiment the first time he saw it. Still less, I suppose,\nwould he have felt capable of judging a biological experiment,\nand following out the same principle, he should have felt less\ncapable still of judging an experiment in psychical research.\nAnd, as an intelligent man distrusts his own judgment of a subject\nwhich is new to him, so he expects that any one who claims to\nbe listened to on any subject must first have studied it thoroughly.\nThus, if a supposed discovery is made in chemistry, its acceptance by\nthe scientific world does not depend on whether the discoverer is,\nsay, an expert astronomer, but on whether he is a competent chemist.\nBut if a supposed discovery is made in psychical research, it is almost\ninvariably recommended to the world on the groimd that the dis-\ncoverer is an eminent physiologist, or a distinguished psychologist,\nor astronomer, or physicist, whereas it appears to me that the only\nrelevant consideration is his competence as a psychical researcher.\nBy a competent psychical researcher I do not mean, as Sir Oliver\nLodge suggests, a conjurer. A professional conjurer is generally a\nman of limited education, whose limitations are apt to make him\ndogmatic in some cases and credulous in others, and it is notorious\nthat professional conjurers have been deceived by fraudulent mediums,\nthough they have also done good occasional service in exposing\nfrauds. While a conjurer is on safe ground in dealing with fraud,\n\f260 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mae., 1910.\nsince the art of deception is his special province, he is on the same level\nwith any other amateur as far as genuine phenomena are concerned.\nTherefore, while his evidence is valuable when he can show how\na given performance is done, the mere fact that he cannot see how\nit is done proves nothing, except that the capacity of the performer\n\u2014whether fraudulent m' genuine\u2014exceeds his own.\nNevertheless, since, of course, fraud is a large element in what\nwe have to deal with, an expert in fraud is one\u2014though by no\nmeans the only one\u2014of the experts needed in our work. I think,\nhowever, that a man of general education who has added a practical\nknowledge of conjuring to his general equipment (as was pre-\neminently the case, e.g. with Dr. Hodgson), is likely to be much\nmore useful than a mere conjurer.\nWith the greatest possible respect for science, I do not regard it\nas the one and only study in which a scientific habit of mind can\nbe cultivated. An equally high standard of accuracy, a power of\nnice discrimination, and a capacity for judging evidence, may be\nfound among men of letters. And even a philosopher may be useful\nin expounding the general principles on which enquiries should be\ncarried on, and the conclusions which may legitimately be deduced\nfrom them. In our work, the help of educated men of every type\nis of great advantage, and we liave been fortunate in never being\nwithout it. But we have been fortunate above all in being able\nto count among our founders\u2014to speak only of those who are\nno longer living\u2014men who were not only eminent in philosophy,\nor in letters, or versed in practical science, but each one of whom\nwas at the same time an expert in psychical research.\nAlice Johnson.\nConcluding Note.\nThere is nothing in this Note of Miss Johnson's with which I\ndisagree, unless it be the emphasis laid on \"suggestibility\" in con-\nnexion with skilled and responsible observers ; and in her concluding\nparagraph\u2014as is clear from page 4 of my book \" The Survival of\nMan\"\u2014I heartily concur.\nOliver Lodge.\n\fNo. CCLXVIII.\u2014Vol. XIV. ;\nApril, 1910.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nSociety for Psychical Research.\nCONTENTS.\nPAGE\nNew Members and Associates, 262\nMeeting of the Council, 263\nPrivate Jfeeting for Members and Associates, 263\nEusapia Palladino in America, 265\nMr. G.

Arthur Smith, in the chair.\nDr. T. W. Mitchell read a paper on \" A Study in Hysteria\nand Double Personality, with Eeport of a Case,\" which will, it\nis hoped, be published later in the Proceedings. The following\nis a short abstract of the case reported\nIn 1901 Amelia G. P., aged 29, developed a variety of\nhysterical symptoms after a period of acute illness which corre-\nsponded to no known affection. She presented many of the\nrecognised stigmata of hysteria, such as hemianaesthesia, con-\ncentric reduction of the visual fields, paralysis and tremor of\nthe limbs. She also suffered for over a year from an unusual\nform of speech-defect, which was accompanied by word-blindness.\nThe power of writing was retained, but her spelling reproduced\n\f264 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Apkil, 1910.\nall the peculiarities of her speech. This illness lasted for\neighteen months, after which she remained well until the end\nof 1904, when she again became affected in a similar way.\nAll the old symptoms returned in a more severe form, and\nmany new ones developed. On this occasion her illness lasted\nuntil the end of December, 1905. From this date she kept\nwell until ISTovember, 1908, when she had a recurrence of the\nsame kind of illness.\nFrom the beginning of this last attack she was treated by\nhypnotic suggestion, and Dr. Mitchell said he was struck by\nthe unequal response to therapeutic suggestions which he met\nwith in this case. It seemed to him that the resistance\nencountered in connection with particular suggestions was the\ndeliberate act of a second personality which was brought to\nlight by the induction of hypnosis. Only when the hypnotic\npersonality so pleased were suggestions for the relief of any\nparticular symptom of any avail.\nFurther evidence of the existence of a second personality was\nfound in the somnambulic life of the patient, and in her\ntendency to drop into the second state spontaneously in the\ndaytime. For convenience the hypnotic state was referred to\nas Amelia and the waking state as Milly\u2014the name generally\nused by the patient's friends. Amelia claimed to be different\nin some ways from Milly. She said she knew more than\nMilly did and remembered much that Milly had forgotten.\nAmelia maintained that she was the originator of some of\nMilly's hysterical symptoms. She said :\n\" I made her hands\nshake and her legs as well, and I scratched her and made all\nthose nasty places on her hands and legs, and made her fingers\nclose down and her thumbs so that she could not move them.\n. . . I made her fall downstairs and hurt herself.\" She denied\nall responsibility, however, for the speech troubles and the other\nmore serious symptoms, and Dr. Mitchell was inclined to think\nthat there was some foundation for the distinction she made.\nThe more serious functional disorders appeared to him to be\nconnected with the functioning of dissociated states of conscious-\nness which were not synthesised within the hypnotic personality.\nAnd although these symptoms were ultimately removed by\nsuggestion, their removal seemed to necessitate the induction of\nDO '\na deeper hypnotic state.\n\fApeil, 1910. Euscipia Pallaclino in America. 265\nDuring the discussion that followed, Dr. Agatha Porter\nasked if there had been any evidence of double personality\nbefore the patient was hypnotised.\nDr. Mitchell replied that he had had no reason to suspect\nthe existence of a second personality until after hypnosis had\nbeen induced. But he did not think that the doubling of the\npersonality was a result of hypnosis. He said that in ordinary\nhypnotic somnambules a second personality, perhaps as well\nmarked as that shown in the case recorded, might be artificially\ncreated by suggestion, but in this case he had found the second\npersonality already formed when the hypnotic state was first\ninduced.\nIn reply to the Eev. J. W. Hayes, Dr. Mitchell said he\nthought the amount of malice that such an artificially formed\npersonality could be made to display would depend on the real\ncharacter of the subject rather than on the intentions of the\nhypnotist.\nEUSAPIA PALLADINO IN AMEEICA.\nA somewhat sensational article by Professor Hugo Miinsterberg\non the sittings with Eusapia Palladino in America has recently\nappeared in The Metropolitan Magazine (for February, 1910).\nApart from one incident, to be related presently, on '\naccount\nof which we refer to it, the article contains little or nothing\nin the way of facts or of comments that will be new to those\nwho have paid any previous attention to the subject, while\nProfessor Miinsterberg disarms all criticism of himself as an\nobserver by remarking at the beginning, \" I myself am entirely\nunfit for such an investigation.\" He seems to decide, never-\ntheless, at the end that \"physical phenomena\" must be\nimpossible on a priori grounds, and between the two one\nwonders tliat he took the trouble to sit with Eusapia at all.\nWith the fact that she is extremely skilful in making sub-\nstitutions of one of her hands or feet for the other we are\nalready familiar; and we know that a number of devices\nhave been mentioned (in our pubhcations and elsewhere) by\nwhich, in the opinion of many persons, some of her perfor-\nmances may be carried out. Further, several cautious observers\nhave previously remarked that the occasional searches to which\n\f266 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, i9io.\nshe has submitted are not sufficient to exclude the possibility\nof hidden apparatus.\nThere is, however, one observation of Professor Miinsterberg's\nwhich seems novel and which, if confirmed and followed up\nby other investigators, might be instructive. He says\nI noticed, while I was sitting at her side, that every time before\na levitation of the table began she arranged something between her\nknees under her clothes. It was often only a quick movement as if\nshe were pressing a button, but I never saw the levitation without\nsuch a preparatory action, though the knees themselves, which I held\nwith my hand, were kept entirely quiet. Moreover, frequently she\narranged the folds of her skirt around the legs of the table as if\nsome forceps were to hold the table leg from below the gown.\nThe last part of the article also gives an account of a very\ninstructive and hitherto unpublished incident, as follows\nOne week before Christmas, at the midnight hour, I sat again at\nMadame Palladino's favorite left side and a well-known scientist on\nher right. We had her under strictest supervision. Her left hand\ngrasped my hand, her right hand was held by her right neighbor,\nher left foot rested on my foot while her right was pressing the\nfoot of her other neighbor. For an hour the regulation performance\nhad gone on. But now we sat in the darkened room in the highest\nexpectancy while Mr. Carrington begged John to touch my arm and\nthen to lift the table in the cabinet behind her and John really\ncame. He touched me distinctly on my hip and then on my arm\nand at last he pulled my sleeve at the elbow. I plainly felt the\nthumb and the fingers. It was most uncanny. And, finally, John\nwas to lift the table in the cabinet. We held both her hands, we\nfelt both her feet, and yet the table three feet behind her began to\nscratch the floor and we expected it to be lifted. But instead, there\nsuddenly came a wild, yelling scream. It was such a scream as I\nhave never heard before in my life, not even in Sarah Bernhardt's\nmost thrilling scenes. It was a scream as if a dagger had stabbed\nEusapia right through the heart.\nWhat had happened 1 Neither she nor Mr. Carrington had the\nslightest idea that a man was lying flat on the floor and had succeeded\nin slipping noiselessly like a snail below the curtain into the cabinet.\nI had told him that I expected wires stretched out from her body\nand he looked out for them. What a surprise when he saw that\n\fApeil, 1910. Eusapia Palladino in America. 267\nshe had simply freed her foot from her shoe and with an athletic\nbackward movement of the leg was reaching out and fishing with\nher toes for the guitar and the table in the cabinet ! And then\nlying on the floor he grasped her foot and caught her heel with firm\nhand, and she responded with that wild scream which indicated that\nshe knew that at last she was trapped and her glory shattered.\nHer achievement was splendid. She had lifted her unshod foot\nto the height of my arm when she touched me under cover of the\ncurtain, without changing in the least the position of her body.\nWhen her foot played thumb and fingers the game was also neat\nthroughout. To be sure, I remember before she was to reach out\nfor the table behind her, she suddenly felt the need of touching my\nleft hand too, and for that purpose she leaned heavily over the table\nat which we were sitting. She said that she must do it because\nher spiritual fluid had become too strong and the touch would relieve\nher. As a matter of course in leaning forward with the upper half\nof her body she became able to push her foot further backward and\nthus to reach the light table, which probably stood a few inches too\nfar. And then came the scream and the doom.\nAs our readers may like to have further authentic informa-\ntion about this incident, what led up to it, and to whom the\ncredit of the exposure is due, we print the following account\nby Mr. G-. B. Dorr of the sittings in question. The account\nwas undated, but bore the postmark Dec. 26th, 1909:\nI had three seances with Eusapia Palladino in New York last\nweek. I arranged for them some time ago. And friends of mine\nwent to them with me, so that we could, to some extent, control\nconditions. Professor Miinsterberg went with me also on two evenings,\nthe first and last. I had read the Naples report quite carefully,\nand went, so far, prepared. The first evening Professor Miinster-\nberg, I, and one of my friends controlled during the whole evening,\nobserving very closely, but\u2014like others\u2014came away quite unable to\nexplain the things that happened, which were mainly levitations of\nthe table, the over-throwing, or throwing out from the cabinet of the\nlittle table placed in it, the blowing out of the curtain, and its\nbulging out as though with pressure from behind, and toihchings on\nthe arm or side toward the cabinet, while my friend controlling\nopposite me was grasped at one time on the arm. The light during\nthe levitations of the larger table was excellent, even strong, but\neverything else happened in a dark-red light, diflficult to see in.\n\f268 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. April, 1910.\nA temporary boarding across the room, with a boarded-up recess in\nit for cabinet, before which E. P. sat, made her background.\nOne could pass behind this boarding. I noticed one or two things\nthat seemed to ask attention that evening. One was that she com-\nplained beyond what was reasonable, 1 thought, of pain caused by\nmy holding her hand even lightly, and by my resting my foot on\nhers, so that she presently had both hand and foot resting upon\nmine, and free.\nAnother thing was that the first thing that happened when any-\nthing was about to take place in the cabinet was the blowing out\n(as it seemed) of the curtain, which then remained resting on, and\ncovering, one or other of her arms and shoulders, screening that\nwhole side from being seen in the dim light. I also noticed that\nE. P. asked one of my friends, who was standing behind my chair\nas I controlled during the time of dim light, to go further off, on\nthe ground that if I were \" touched,\" I might think it was he that\ndid it.\nThe second evening Professor Miinsterberg was not present, but\nProfessor Trowbridge of Princeton, a physicist, was. Otherwise the\ngroup was practically the same. We then tried the experiment of\nshifting the cabinet (without previous warning) to the obviously solid\ncorner of the room, across which we stretched the curtains, as in the\nNaples sittings. And I asked Mr. Carrington and the interpreter (one\nof my friends spoke Italian like a native) to leave us alone with E. P.\nduring that sitting, which [they] very courteously did. Under these\nconditions the same phenomena as before took place, and in addi-\ntion something resembling slightly a palely illuminated hand appeared\nin the dim light, three times, above E. P.'s head. Her own hand,\nif free, however, could easily have got into that position. And\nProf. Trowbridge told me that at a previous sitting at which he\nhad been the week before something similar in appearance had shot\nswiftly out over the table in front of her\u2014when the light was\ndim\u2014and that then it was at a lower level, the level of her shoulder,\nat which it would have to be in order to reach out far in front if\nit really were her hand thrust out from under the concealing cuitain.\nAnd I came off with the impression that it probably was her hand,\nin some way free.\nAnother thing I noticed that evening was that when the curtain\ncame out it seemed to me to be rather twitched out from some\npoint low down\u2014as low down as her waist\u2014than freely blown out\nfrom behind. I was able also from where I stood to reach across\n\fApeil, 1910. Eiisapia Palladino in America. 269\nand feel of it before the movement ceased, and it was drawn, I\nthought, quite tensely above the point of movement, which I could\nnot reach. The corner of a room is a poor place in one way to\nlocate the cabinet, because no one but the controllers on either\nside\u2014whom she controls as well as is controlled by\u2014can get\nnear it. It also seemed to me that evening that the wind from the\ncabinet was caused by the curtain as it was moved, not that it was\nthe wind that moved it.\nThat evening E. P. began by saying that she wanted no one to\nstand near the controller upon either side, nor as far back as they\ntowards the cabinet ; that is, she wanted to keep all present within\na certain angle in front of her, as it were. I also noticed that\nbefore the cabinet performances began she gradually worked her\nchair and the table back until she practically touched the curtain,\nand that she left her controls \" con permesso \" at times, and stretched\nabout as though to rest herself, which was, of course, quite natural,\nbut gave opportunitj-, when the light was dim and the curtain had\nblown out over her shoulder, to arrange things in the cabinet or\nelsewhere if she wished.\nThat evening I did not control at all myself, but getting as close\nas I could behind one of my friends who was controlling, in the\ncabinet period of the seance, I found myself able to see into the\ncabinet, as soon as the curtain on my side had been blown out\nand was resting on her shoulder, with considerable distinctness,\nthanks to the white-plastered, sloping wall, and I made up my mind\nthat whatever took place in it had its origin behueen her and the\nobject moved, and not behind the latter. Moreover, all the move-\nments that took place from the cabinet outward seemed to have the\ncharacter of ones due to . sudden pulls\u2014or pushes\u2014not to any per-\nsistently acting force ;\ne.g. the little table seemed to me to be thrown\nout always\u2014even when, one time, it was thrown out on top of the\nother\u2014and not to be propelled by any steady force.\nThe third evening\u2014the sittings were on the 13th, 16th and 18th of\nDecember\u2014more people were present than previously, a dozen or so\nin all, besides herself and those wlio came with her, the interpreter,\na stenographer, and Mi', and Mrs. Carrington, but several of the.se\nhad been present at the other sittings. That evening we began by\nasking E. P. to let herself be searched by two ladies who were\npresent by my own arrangement. This was done quite thoroughly,\nby their report, but I noticed that E. P. did not, they told me\nafterward, take off her boots, which did not occur to them as\n\f270 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 191.o.\nnecessary. I merely made a mental note of the fact at the time,\nbut afterwards it seemed important. The cabinet was now back\nin its old place, in the recess in the boarding, which gave those\npresent and not controlling more room to get near, or in a line at\nleast with the front of, the cabinet.\nIn the first part of the sitting there were levitations of the table in\nfull light, as before, and these we could in no way explain. Professor\nMiinsterberg was controlling on one side ; one of my friends\u2014a keen,\nintelligent, and younger man\u2014upon the other. I was free, and could\nsee jilainly under the table as it rose. Her knees were not lifted,\nber hands were above the table and in control, and one of my friends\nonce ran his hand down between her body and the table as it was\nrising. None of us indeed, however sceptical, who were present at\nany of these sittings have yet been able to suggest any explanation\nfor these full-light levitations. I think it possible that they may be\ngenuine.\nAfter a while the light was turned down\u2014that is, a bulb covered\nwith dark-red paper was used instead of the plain bulb\u2014and things\nbegan to happen in the cabinet, the curtain having first blown out)\nor been drawn out, as usual, and resting on her shoulder\u2014her left\nshoulder it was. Prof. Miinsterberg had not been \" touched \" ; she\nwas asked to \"touch\" him\u2014that is, to get him \"touched\"\u2014the same\nthing if you will ! To bring this about she brought him from control-\nling on her rigid side to her left. I had noticed previously that the\nthings done from the cabinet seemed to come mainly from one side\nor the other at any given time, not from both indifferently. M.\nwas then touched on the arm ; I was standing behind him, a little\nway off but leaning forward with my hands resting on the back of\nhis chair.\nOne of the friends who had come with me, a younger man,\nactive, quick and cool, stooped down between me and M.'s chair, to\nwatch, if possible, if anything came out from the cabinet. The\nroom was then quite dark (with a single red light), and being unseen\nbehind M.'s chair and E. P. being then close to the cabinet\nwith the curtain {i.e. a strip of it) drawn over her left shoulder,\nwhich further prevented her from seeing as from being seen, my\nfriend gradually stretched out upon the floor until his head was in\nthe cabinet, and lay there watching.\nA suggestion was then made that the little table should be brought\nout again\u2014it had already been thrown out once and been replaced,\nand E. P., I think, had herself replaced it where it then was standing\n\fI\nApeil, 1910. Eusapia Palladino in America. 271\n\u2014when suddenly my friend saw a foot, no boot upon it, above him\nin the dim light, and took hold of it. E. P. screamed out, in Italian\nof course, that some one had touched her foot. He let go immediately\nand drew cjuietly back, rising up behind me in the dark, so that\nhe remained throughout unseen. At the moment no one, I think,\nbut myself knew what had happened, and one of the other men\npresent, familiar with her stances, who happened to be standing\nopposite me, behind her right control, remarked that it was \"very\nextraordinary,\" he had \" never known of Eusapia's being '\ntouched\n'\nbefore.\" She herself was very much disturbed ; accused a quite\ninnocent person\u2014who did not even know what had happened\u2014of\nhaving crept into the cabinet ; and then exclaimed that the newspapers\nwould say, the next morning, that she did things with her foot.\nNothing more of importance happened after that. She kept re-\ncurring to it, that some one had touched her foot ; but she did not\nseem at the end to be as h} sterical, I thought, as previously at\nthe trance's end, which left me with a question as to how real the\nhysteria and exhaustion had been in which the other trances had\nseemed to leave her.\nNow, to go back, the foot, when my friend grasped it, must from\nhis position have been at least two feet behind her. At the same\ntime Prof. Miinsterberg\u2014and it was unmistakably upon his side\u2014was\nquite unconscious that he was not \" controlling \"\u2014able to account\nfor, that is \u2014that same foot, which was placed on his and pressing\ncontinuously on it at the time, he tells me. That she released her\nfoot from under mine in a previous sitting and placed it above, I\nhave already mentioned. The simplest explanation would seem to\nbe, I think, that she has very supple feet and limbs, and draws\nher foot out from her boot, which she still continues to hold\ndown in some way\u2014with some attachment on the other foot con-\nceivably\u2014on the controller's foot while she uses her own to move\nthings in the cabinet, and probably to touch the controllers on the\narm or elsewhere. Mr. Carrington told me in the beginning that\neverything that happened took place within four feet of her. Now\nthis is just about the reach of leg and foot, if she has a chance\nunder the cover of the extended curtain and the darkness to stretch\nout at length. I think she also reaches back and places things in\nthe cabinet where she can reach them later, when she stops and\nfrees herself to \" rest.\" She rearranges the curtain then, and might\neasily arrange the things behind it too, for the room is dark and\nshe is close to the curtain, where she could readily reach back.\n\f272 Journal of Society for Psycldcal Research. April, 1910.\nIn my three sittings there was nothing that took place in con-\nnection with the cabinet that could not easily be explained by a\nfree foot or hand, used skilfully ; and that she does use both, and\nskilfully, there now can be no doubt. The levitation of the larger\ntable in full light I am rather inclined to believe in as genuine,\nas I have already said, partly because the control of eye as well\nas touch seems, in this case, to be so good ; and if this be\ngenuine, perhaps other things are genuine too. But I feel quite\nsure myself that none of those we saw were so, apart from the\nlevitations of the larger table. E. P. certainly has a well worked out\nsystem for doing things by trickery if they fail to do themselves.\nThe knocking of the table, bidding people talk, is part of it, no\ndoubt. Mr. Carrington told me it seemed to \" help things to\nhappen \"\n\u2014and I think it did. The tying of the feet\u2014which we\ndid one evening at her suggestion\u2014I think must hold the hoot,\nnot the foot.\nThe man controlling opposite Prof Munsterberg at the time of the\nfoot incident was an unusually intelligent, clear-witted younger man,\nand an old friend of mine, who had been present at all three\nsittings and had controlled before. He, like Prof. Miinsterberg,\nwas quite unconscious at the time of her having escaped in any\nway from his control. Nor did she probably, as it was quite\nevidently on Prof. Miinsterberg's side that she had freed herself.\nBut he was also watching closely, and feels quite certain of the\npressure of her foot\u2014as he thought it\u2014on his at the time the thing\ntook place. He now thinks the touch he felt just previously was\nno doubt her toes, reaching up under the cover of the extended\ncurtain to his right arm. G. B. Dour.\nAfter writing this letter, Mr. Dorr obtained the following\nstatements from the sitter who grasped the foot and from\nProfessor Miinsterberg. In sending us the original account of\nthe former Mr. Dorr calls attention to his own error in stating\nthat the foot was seen in the cabinet ; the dim light and the\nshadow of the extended curtain precluded sight, and the foot\nwas grasped on the indication of sound alone. The writer of\nthe account is an old friend of Mr. Dorr's ; what he did was\ndone upon his own initiative, as he saw the opportunity offered\nhim and took it, and not in consequence of any suggestion\nfrom Professor Munsterberg, whom he had met for the first\ntime that evening. His name and address were given to us, but\n\fApril, 1910. Eusajna Palladino in America. 273\nwe were asked not to print them, as he wished to avoid being\ninvolved in the notoriety which the incident had gained in\nAmerica. He writes as follows\nFebruary 9fh, 1910.\nI wish here to place on record my impressions of what happened\nat the seance of Eusapia Palladino which I attended in New York.\nDuring the early part of the evening I acted as \" control \" of\nEusapia's left arm and left leg, while Professor Hugo Miinsterberg had\ncontrol of her right arm and leg. The usual phenomena occurred\nas described in the various reports of the E. P. sittings. The only\ndifference that I see from the reports which I happen to have read\nwas the very much larger number present. There were in the\nroom, including Eusapia, the stenographer, and Mr. and Mrs.\nCarrington, seventeen people.\nAt the end of a considerable time I signified my intention of\ngiving up my place, which Miinsterberg took, his place being\ntaken by a well-known scientist, the President of a scientific body\nin New York.\nDuring my \" control \" I had been touched several times in the\nright ribs, and so when the manifestations had progressed and the\nroom returned to its darkened condition, I dropped to the floor and\nglided back of Miinsterberg's chair. There I lay in a strained\nposition for a long time with my open hand covering his ribs hoping\nthat whatever had touched me would touch him, intending instantly\nto close on it. Nothing, however, happened, except that I lost my\nbalance slightly, owing to the strain of my position, and I lightly\nbrushed M.'s ribs by mistake.\nI then crept back to the furthest end of the table from E., and\nresumed my standing position among the onlookers in order to\nrest from the long strain of my position. It must be realized that\nduring all this time the curtain of the cabinet had been blown or\nlifted on to the table and completely filled the gap between Eusapia\nand Miinsterberg. Realizing that probably no one but you [Mr.\nDorr] would notice another attempt, I once more dropped to the\nfloor and glided on my stomach along the back of Miinsterberg's\nchair, but instead of stopping there I crept on to the extreme edge\nof the cabinet. Of course that side was open, as the curtain was\non the table between E. and M. Just as I got there the table\nwas upset and almost fell on my face. It was then lying half\ninside and half outside the cabinet and I right beside it. I lay\nthere from then on, with my left hand raised ready to intercept\n\f274 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, i9io.\nanything that might be between the small table and Eusapia's\nchair. I had already felt all up and down the table to see if\nthere could be anything there, but it was completely clear. I here\ndraw a rough plan of the situation at this moment, although it\nis not in scale. ;\nAs my position made it possible to intercept anything returning\nfrom the table to E., I determined to wait for the first slight\nmovement of the table, as earlier in the evening it had first upset\nin the cabinet and then later on shot out behind my chair when I\nwas the left \"control.\" I did not know what to expect, \u2014a wire\nhook, possibly electricity, \u2014when suddenly the table moved and I\ninstantly closed in to intercept, and my fingers closed firmly on\na human foot in rapid motion which was stopped and arrested by\nmy hand. My fingers were over the instep and my hand closed\nfirmly on it. It was then that Eusapia gave a piercing shriek and\nI glided quickly back in the darkness towards the other end of the\ntable, where I resumed my standing position. Eusapia's outcry,\nfollowed by continuous wailings that she had been seized by the\nfoot, so distracted the attention of the general company that I\nescaped detection except by you and by one of the ladies present.\nI was very much aided in being able to remain so long near\nthe centre of action unobserved by the fact that there were so\nmany people present. As the curtain was lying on the table between\nMiinsterberg and Eusapia, the journey from his chair to the cabinet\nwas comparatively safe as long as it was accomplished in perfect\nsilence.\nIf at any time you require this statement in a more formal\ncharacter, please send me a type-written copy of it and I will swear\nto it before a notary public.\nProfessor Miinsterberg wrote to Mr. Dorr as follows\nCambridge, Massachusetts,\nJanuary 19, 1910.\nIn accordance with your request I state here in writing what I\nat once told you orally after our seance with Madame Palladino\n\fApril, 1910. Eusapia Palladino in America. 275\non December 18th, the second in which I took part. I understand\nthat you are interested only in a statement concerning those observa-\ntions which have reference to Madame Palladino's situation at the\ntime when her foot was grasped in the cabinet.\nAt the moment when her screaming indicated that she was\ngrasped, I felt sure that I held her left hand with my right hand\nand that I felt her left shoe on my right foot. Moreover I felt\nsure that no change in the pressure of the shoe had occurred\nduring the preceding minutes. I believed myself to feel both the\nheel and the sole of her left shoe, while it was her left foot which\nreached out for the table in the cabinet. Inasmuch as the gentle-\nman on her right side also felt her whole foot on his foot, I\nconsider it impossible that a substitution had set in by which her\nright foot gave to both her neighbours the feeling of being touched\nby her shoe. As throughout that part of the seance I gave my\nfullest attention to my foot sensations, I must believe that her\nright foot remained on the foot of her right neighbour and that her\nleft shoe remained on my foot.\nThe skill with whicli she succeeded in removing her foot from\nthe shoe without giving me the slightest suspicion appears to me\nmarvellous. By my laboratory work I am accustomed to careful\nobservation of impressions. I gave my full attention to the tactual\nsensations which her shoe produced on my foot, and yet I did not\nnotice anything of the change until the scream occurred. On the\nother hand I confess that the surprise of the scream withdrew my\nattention for a few seconds so fully from the tactual sensations that\nlater I was unable to remember what happened immediately after\nthe surprise. Certainly when I turned my attention to my foot\nagain, her foot was in the shoe once more. But it may be that a\nminute had elapsed since the excitement which the scream\nproduced.\nLet me add that the gentleman who caught Madame Palladino's\nfoot in the cabinet told me a few minutes afterwards that he had\ngrasped it near the heel and that the foot was without a shoe.\nThe tactual sensations which I perceived at the arm were also such\nas an unshod foot might easily produce with the toes, while a\nshoe could not have given them.\nHugo Munsterberg.\n\f276 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. April, 1910.\nMR. G. W. BALFOUR ON PSYCHICAL RESEARCH\nAND PHILOSOPHY.\nAn important article by Mr. Gerald Balfour has appeared in the\nHihhert Journal for April, 1910, on \"Psychical Research and Current\nDoctrines of Mind and Body.\" These he divides into three principal\nvarieties, namely :\n(1) Parallelism, which holds that between mind and brain inter-\naction is inconceivable ; neither can influence the other. Yet they\nare so closely related that to every change in the mental series a\nchange in the physical series exactly corresponds.\n(2) Epiphenomenalism, which also asserts that every mental event\nhas its exact counterpart in a brain event ; but that, while conscious-\nness cannot influence the molecular changes in the brain, the molecular\nchanges in the brain are the cause, and the sole immediate cause, of\nall conscious states.\n(3) Interactionism, which\u2014like Parallelism \u2014recognises both a dis-\nparity and a correlation between the mental and the physical series,\nbut holds that the two series may be causally related to each other\nand that the relation of the mind with the brain is one of reciprocal\ninfluence.\nAfter explaining briefly the essential features and some of the\nconsequences of these doctrines, the writer goes on to consider whether\nany fresh light is thrown on the Cjuestion of the relation of mind\nand body by the special investigations to which Psj'chical Research\nis directed. He shows that if empirical proof were produced that\nthe individual mind may survive bodily death, carrying with it\nsufficient of its earthly memories to maintain continuity between its\ndiscarnate and its corporeal existence, the doctrine of Parallelism\nand still more that of Epiphenomenalism\u2014would, so far as we can\nsee, have to be abandoned, and some modification of the Inter-\nactionist theory\u2014involving a doctrine of the relations of soul and\nbody rather than of mind and brain\u2014would seem to remain the\nonly one tenable.\nThe evidence for individual survival, however, in Mr. Balfour's\nopinion, falls considerably short of proof, but telepathy between\nthe living is in his view an established fact, and he expresses his\nastonishment at the readiness with which the ordinary educated\npublic (we may add, with little or no examination of the evidence\non which it rests) have adopted a behef in telepathy, while they\nfail to see how profoundly even this belief should modify all current\npsycho-physical doctrines. Finally, he points out that, though\nthe evidence for survival is seriously weakened by the counter\nhypothesis of telepathic faculty combined with subliminal agency;\non the other hand, if a mind associated with a brain can be in\ndirect telepathic relation with some other mind, there is at least a\nprima facie ground for supposing that this relation may subsist after\nthe destruction of the brain.\n\fNo. CCLXIX.\u2014Vol. XIV.

Taylor, 277\nReview: Mr. Podmore's \"Telepathic Hallucinations,\" 290\nEndowment Fund for Psychical Research, - - - 292\nErrata in ProceeiUngs Part LX., 292\nDISCUSSION OF THE NAPLES EEPOET ON EUSAPIA\nPALLADINO.\nI AM sorry that the conditions of investigation accepted by our\nCommittee and explained in their Report on Eusapia Palladino\nshould not meet with Miss Stawell's approval ; but I think in her\ncriticism, published in the February Journal, she sometimes seeks\nto put a construction on words and reported actions they do not\nfairly bear.\nShe begins her paper by speaking of the \" suspicious circum-\nstances \" and \" obvious attempts at trickery \" described on pp. 338,\n383, 400, and 543. (Proceedings, Vol. XXIII.)\nIt is well known that things take place during Eusapia's seances\nwhich do seem to be attempts at fraud, but during the present\ninvestigation they seem to have been very rare. Miss Stawell calls\nattention to only 4 as having occurred throughout the 13 seances\nreported ; there were, however, one or two more. I do not know\nthe reason for this, but, if other things are shown to have been\nunaccountably abnormal, rare attempts at fraud of the description\nmentioned in Miss Stawell's paper, even granting that they do\ntake place, are in my opinion of no consequence.\nMiss Stawell now goes into greater detail to show that Mr.\nPodmore's views are warranted, and because she cannot \" see how\nto make the shorthand report consistent with F.'s later notes about\nthe substitution of hands and the seizing of Mrs. H.'s wrist,\" she\nconcludes it is not so, and makes some remarks on the difficult}^ of\n\f278 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1910.\naccurate memory, tending to depreciate the evidence tendered by\nour Committee.\n(1) As to the \"substitution of hands\" affair, if Miss Stawell had\nenquired she might have found out that the shorthand notes (Pro-\nceedings, Vol. XXIII. p. .540) are not inconsistent with the supple-\nmentary information given on p. 541 \u2014that what took place\nbetween 10.30 and 10.34 during Seance XL, was in fact as follows:\n(ft) E. P. substituted part of her right hand for her left, un-\nperceived by Mrs. H.\n(h) F. saw E. P.'s left hand moving towards the curtain and\nasked Mrs. H. if she was holding the medium's left hand. Mrs.\nH.'s attention being thus attracted to what her right hand was\nholding, she became aware, by feeling the thumb-nail of the medium's\nright hand, and probably other indications, of the substitution that\nhad taken place and answered, \"No, she has made a substitution.\"\n(c) F. now exclaimed \" substitution of hands \" in such a way as\nto attract the attention of the stenographer, who recorded this\nremark, and also that of Mrs. H. which followed, namely, \" I\nthought that I had still hold of the medium's left hand.\"\n(2) Frotn what I read on p. 549, it appears that what F.\ndictated for note by Mr. Meeson, namely, \" Mrs. H.'s hand was\nseized by the wrist by a hand and dragged across the table to\ntouch B.'s face \" must have been prompted by what Mi'S. H. told\nhim (unless Mrs. H. dictated it herself), for although he saw her\nhand move across the table, he did not \"see any hand holding it.\"\nI fail to recognise any want of consistency.\n(3) Miss Stawell is struck by what she considers the incessant\nchanges in the position of Eusapia's hands, and gives the following\nexample from the report of Seance VI. 12.30, of how she thinks\nsuch changes may \"provide the opportunity for the phenomena,\nfleeting as these are.\" She cjuotes from p. 453 the shorthand\nnotes of what took place, and asks whether there might not have\nbeen time between that at which E. P. withdrew her hand from\nF.'s and replaced it in B.'s to have done some act which caused C.\nto aver that he saw a head come out from the curtains slowly and\nto within six inches of his head, stay out about two seconds and\nthen go back. I do not know\u2014-but granting that E. P. took more\nthan two seconds to move her hand from F.'s to B.'s, what C. saw\nwas a head, not a hand. If he saw this head come out from\nbehind the curtains to the left of Eusapia's head, it could not have\nbeen represented by her hand, because she could not have got it\n\fMay, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 279\ninto that position. If not so, however, remembering that Eusapia's\nhead was resting against C.'s head, and her left hand in his, so\nthat, when she put her right hand inside the curtain to take F.'s,\nshe must have swung her right shoulder back, and the only way\nshe could have performed the miracle imputed to her must have\nbeen\n(rt) To change the appearance of her hand to that of a head.\n(b) To swing this false head right across in front of B., to\npause a moment close to C.'s head, then repass B. and\ngain the shelter of the curtain.\n(c) To permit her hand to re-assume its ordinary shape and\nthen replace itself in B.'s.^\n(4) Miss Stawell's next remarks refer to the statement that during\nSeance V. 11.8, the little table struck B. under the shoulder\n(p. 429). She quotes the following sentence from \" Remarks on the\nseance\" (V. p. 420). \"From 10.52 onwards there were a series of\nmovements of the small table and of other objects behind the cur-\ntain, culminating at 11.8 by the small table striking B. on the\nshoulder and upsetting completely, the medium being rigorously\nheld, visible and motionless,\" and from this she infers that the\nintention is to imply that E. P. was \"held, visible and motionless\"\nfrom 10.52 to 11.8. I could draw no such conclusion, but if for a\nmoment I did entertain it, a glance at the shorthand report of the\nseance would be enough to dispel that error.\nShe goes on to remark on the incessant motion of E. P.'s limbs,\nand would, I think, like the reader to infer that the movements of\nthe things behind the curtain were caused by Eusapia, owing to the\nwant of control exercised by the experimenters. I maintain, however,\nthat since the table and the other things were behind the curtain,\nand the curtain behind the medium's chair, she could not have been\nthe cause of their movement with even much more liberty of action\nthan the report grants her. Miss Stawell describes the medium's\nleft leg as \"kicking backwards and forwards,\" but forgets to say\nthat it was under the table and under F.'s control. To Miss\nStawell the fact that on one occasion it was found that Eusapia\nhad only buttoned her boots by the top button \" suggests pre-\nparation for slipping her foot in and out\n;\n\" to me it suggests\nslovenliness only.\n^ The above speculation is, however, needless, for on enquiry I find that\n\"tlie head appeared after Eusapia had replaced her hand on B.'s.\"\n\f280 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1910.\nBut to go back to Mr. Feilding's original statement on p. 420,\nthat when the table struck B. Eusapia was \" rigorously held, visible\nand motionless\" (pp. 420 and 429) and Miss Stawell's that \"it\nwas after the table has struck B. at 11.8 that the medium appears\nto have become motionless.\"\nHere are two statements which cannot both be true, one made\nby a witness of the event, the other by one who was not. In order\nto settle which is correct, let us turn to the shorthand report made\nat the time, and then and there recorded.\n\"11.8 p.m. B. The little table struck me under the shoulder\nand fell over completely on the right of the medium.\n\" B. At the same moment she was holding my left hand with\nher right, and her right foot was resting on my left foot. I felt\nthe whole length of her leg against my leg.\n\" F. Her left hand is in my left, on the corner of the table. My\nright hand across both knees. Her left leg motionless. Her left\nfoot on my right foot, and I know it is the whole of it. Her head\nclose to me and motionless and clearly visible.\n\"B. Her head is visible to me as well.\"\nThis appears to me inconsistent with Miss Stawell's statement.\nFinally, in this section of her remarks. Miss Stawell thinks it likely\nthat E. P. \" substituted a dummy hand for her right during Seances\nv., VI., and VII.\"! \"Possible,\" \"conceivable,\" it may be; but\nI think\u2014in the face of the report of those present\u2014altogether\nunlikely. 1\n(5) i^ajjs, p. 334.\nUnder this heading Miss Stawell calls attention to par. 10, page\n537 :\n\" Finally the series of raps produced on the door leading\ninto B.'s room, at the side of the cabinet, at the close of the\nseance (XL), which must be regarded as the only really evidential\nraps obtained throughout the whole series. The No. I. Light was\non, and the room additionally flooded with light through the open\ndoor of the next room.\"\nShe explains these raps by supposing a confederate of Eusapia's\ncrot into B.'s room and made them in answer to signals; of course\nthis is a possible explanation, but under the circumstances not a\nlikely one.\n(a) Miss Stawell says the door from B.'s room opening on the\n^Mr. Baggally, who is tlie witness most concerned, repudiates my expressions\n\"possible, conceivable,\"' as completely wide of the mark.\n\fMat, 1910.

The other\npersons who had been present at the seances (with the exception of\nthe stenographer who remained seated at his table) had retired into\nC.'s room.\" 2 She reminds us that Signor Z. is a friend of Eusapia's ;\ndoes she suggest that he was her confederate 1\n^\nI do not know what they do with strangers who \" slip into \" the\nbedrooms of guests in Italian hotels, but I fancy it is something\nnot very nice, particularly if they gain admittance by help of a\nskeleton key.\nHow does Miss Stawell imagine that the necessary signals were\nmade 1 Did one of them perhaps consist in scratching the back of\nB.'s hand 1\nAs to the raps being described as both \"loud\" and \"feeble,\" it\nmust be remembered that these are merely relative terms.\n(6) Levitations, p. 331 (1).\nThe view that the occurrence of levitations in the presence of\nEusapia may be denied on a jrriori grounds is reasonable ; but to\nargue from the report published that the members of our Committee\nwere mistaken when they thought there was no adequate physical\nconnection between the medium and the things levitated seems to\nme unreasonable on the part of one who was not present at the\nseances, and whose opportunity of judging must be small compared\nwith theirs.\nThe first instance of levitation of the seance table criticised by\nMiss Stawell is one which took place during the first seance at\niln fact, the door of B.'s room oijetis, not on the passage, but into a dressing-\nroom, the door of which, he assures me, it was his custom to lock whenever he\nleft the room, aud he has no recollection of not having done so on this occasion.\n- Or this may be looked at from the point of view of arithmetic\u2014Present,\n6 persons, three (H., B., and M.) remaining in the seance-room and \"three\nof the company going into the room on the other side (C.'s room)\" (Miss\nStawell's Paper, p. 234).\n\u2022^Ou referring this to Mr. Baggally, he says, \"Miss Stawell's implied assertion\nthat Signor Zingaropoli was a confederate cannot be entertained.

In the report of this case the description given of the con-\ntrol exercised is not quite accurate owing to some confusion in the\nuse of the words \" right \" and \" left,\" this confusion would no doubt\nbe cleared up by means of a question or two addressed to the\nwitnesses ; ^ still the main point is, that the experimenters who\nwere on the spot were satisfied that the levitations were \" genuine.\"\nIf Miss Stawell wishes to criticise the report of levitations, she\nshould attack the strongest cases she can find, and had she drawn\nattention to the one that occurred at 11.43, one minute before the\none the evidence for which she attacks, she would have been unable\nto show any confusion in the wording of the description of the\ncontrol exercised, and would have had to meet in addition the evi-\ndence of the shorthand writer, Mr. Meeson, who says, \" I could see\nthe table in the air with nobody touching it,\" and this in Light I.\n(7) Objects emerging from the Cabinet.\nThe shape, colour, and size of the objects observed to emerge\nfrom the cabinet, are, no doubt, matters of interest, but our\nenquiry is rather whether this emergence was the result of some\nphysical action on the medium's part or not.\nRead the report of a \" white hand \" coming out from behind the\ncurtain at 12.9 a.m., during Seance VII. p. 477, and say whether\nthat report leaves any room for supposing it to be Eusapia's hand,\nparticularly when the outsider has to judge by the written record,\nas Miss Stawell (p. 2.37) maintains he must.\n(8) The transportation of the clay on the board.\nIn her criticism of this incident, Miss Stawell commences by\nsaying, \"If Eusapia once got her left hand free,\" but this is, I\nthink, a bold suggestion when its possibility is denied as follows, by\nthree responsible witnesses.\nSays E. \" My right hand was lying perfectly flat on the middle\nof the table, and her left hand was stroking my wrist \" (p. 496).\nSays F. \" Her right hand was continuously in mine.\" If the\nmedium's right hand was under F.'s, as the Committee agree in\nsaying (p. 485), it could not have been the one stroking B.'s\nwithout F. being aware of it ; but F. has more to say ; he writes :\n\"Eusapia's two hands were both visible, her left on R.'s right hand\n^ The following question addressed to Mr. Carriiigton was all that was\nnecessary\u2014\"I cannot follow the explanation, p. 353, unless in line nine, 'right\nhand' should have been 'left hand.' Is it so?\" The answer from Mr.\nCarrington was \"Yes.\"\n\fMay, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusaioia Pcdladino. 283\nnear the middle of the table, her right hand under my right hand\nabout a foot distant from her left\" (p. 503), and lastly, C. says\n(p. 503), \"It would have been an utter impossibility for the medium\n{even supposing that she had her left hand free) to have placed the\nclay in the position in which I first saw it ( x 2 on plan, p. 503), and\nthen to have moved it on to the seance table.\" Certainly not without\nbeing discovered, for as they could see the clay and board move\n.slowly out, they could also have seen the medium's hand carrying it.\nThe above rather strongly suggests to me that E. P. did not get\nher left hand free ; Miss Stawell, on the contrary, gains an opposite\nsuggestion, just as powerful, perhaps, from the facts that half an\nhour before one curtain had been right over the table, that the\nmedium's two hands were resting on the table, about a foot apart,\nvisible and controlled respectively by F. and R. and that \" one at\nleast of her hands was moving about,\"\u2014was stroking R.'s wrist, if\nthat is what you call \" moving about.\"\nCommenting on C.'s report, Miss Stawell says (p. 237), \" It\nseems as though it must have been very hard to detect a slight\nmovement of the black curtain in that dim light (Light III.) and\nfrom the angle where he (C.) was standing, (see plan, p. 503).\"\nA slight movement !\n\u2014If Eusapia had leant back in her chair and\nthrust her hand into the cabinet (her left hand is, I suppose,\nsuggested) between the two curtains, and then brought it round\nand out of the cabinet again between the left-hand curtain and the\nwall, by the window, and so back to the middle of the table, the\nwhole of the left-hand curtain would have been gathered up in her\nleft arm and carried forward so as to cover the left-hand corner of\nthe table at least. If she had thrust her hand into the cabinet by\nthe wall, the disturbance to the curtain would not have been\n\"slight,\" as Miss Stawell describes it, but considerable, even before\nshe was able to get at the clay at all.\n(9) The cold breeze and the curtain lulging, etc.\nFor between 20 and 30 years Eusapia has been before the public,\n-during which time the phenomena occurring in her presence have\nbeen enquired into, examined and re-examined by eminent scientific\nmen of all nationalities, yet, as far as I know, no evidence has been\nforthcoming that she provides herself secretly with apparatus for\nfraudulent purposes, and if any such evidence exists, I feel confident\nthat Miss Stawell would have brought it forward in support of her\ntheories ; instead of that, however, she now floats away on the wings\nof an imagination which despises all difficulties of manipulation and\n\f284 Jottrnal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt. Mat, i9io.\nany inference which might be drawn from the non-discovery, during\nso many years, of these hypothetical tools.\nMiss Stawell supposes Eusapia to provide herself, as occasion re-\nquires, with tubes, bulbs, bladders, dummy hands, crooked wires, and\nphosphorus, but when we come to look more closely at how these\nthings are to be used for fraudulent purposes, it seems to me that\nthey will require for their manipulation, hands free beyond all\nfreedom that \" substitution \" could give them, and also that the\neffect they are supposed to serve could be, in many cases, much\nmore easily produced without their aid.\nIf, for example, the dummy hand was used to deceive during\nSeances V. VI. and VIII., its use seems a needless refinement,\nseeing that Eusapia's own hand must itself have been behind the\ncurtain to hold it.^ Again, if a bladder at the end of a tube is\nsupposed to be the device by means of which the curtains are made\n\" to balloon out in a round bulge \" the bladder itself must have been\nheld behind the curtains; Eusapia with her naked hand, without the\nbladder, could make c|uite as effective a demonstration with no risk\nof any apparatus being discovered, and without the trouble of getting\nthe thing out from between her \"skin and her combinations,\"\ninflating it, etc., etc.\nMiss Stawell says that \" the description of the . . . curtain-bulging\nseems exactly to suit the effect that might be produced by such a\nbladder dilated at will;\" but the experimenters say : \"If we made a\nsudden grab at the bulge, no resistance was encountered. . .\n.\" Now,\nif the bulge was made by a bladder being pressed against the\ncurtain from behind, it would be distinctly felt by any one who\nsuddenly grabbed at the bulge.\n(10) Dress swelling.\nPerhaps the dress swelling is not incompatible with the use of the\nsupposed bladder, but from my ignorance of ladies' underclothing I\ncannot follow the arrangements described; a good deal depends on\nthe size of the swelling and the consequent size of the bladder.\nThe diflBculty of deflating the bladder without noise also has to be\nconsidered.\n(11) Movements of the little table.\n\" Most of these movements,\" says Miss Stawell, \" can be explained\non the quite possible supposition that Eusapia got one hand or foot\n1\nTo suppose that the Committee could have been deceived by a detached inflated\nthing placed loosely on the table under the curtain seems to me preposterous.\n\fMay, 1910. Tlie Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 285'\nfree.\" The supposition does not seem to me quite so possible as she\nwould have it. In the only instance, as Miss Stawell thinks, in\nwhich the movements of the small table could not have been caused\nby one hand or foot unassisted by apparatus, was at 11.55, during\nSeance II. when she supposes the use of a thin wire about the\nthickness of a hairpin\u2014 how long this wire is supposed to be she-\ndoes not say, though this dimension is of vital importance. In any\ncase, the wire could only assist the medium in either drawing the\ntable towards her or pushing it directly away, if that ;\nbut, as far\nas I can follow the report, it seems that the table moved from some\nposition on the floor to the right of the medium to a position in\nthe cabinet directly behind her, and this change of position could\nnot be effected by any direct push or pull.\nI have a little table, weighing just about 7 lbs., which I put on\nthe bare floor and tried to move with a wire, gauge 18, length\n3 ft. 6 inches. I could not move it. I then tried a piece of wire,\ngauge 16, of the same length, and found that by bending an end I\ncould pull the table to me, but not push it away. It was not till\nI tried a wire of the gauge 10 that I could cause any motion of\ntranslation except directly towards or away from myself, and then\nonly partially and with difficulty. I had, however, I expect, not so-\nsmooth a surface to work upon as the possibly polished floor of the\nroom in Naples.\n(12) Twanging the Guitar.\nOf this phenomenon Miss Stawell takes two cases on which she\ncomments.\nIn the first case, during Seance II., she says :\n\" Is it out of the\nfjuestion \" that in good light the medium should with a wire pluck\nthe strings of a guitar which was over three feet away directly\nbehind her chair, with an overset table between them, this wire\nbeing held in one of her hands, hands which the experimenters\nthought they were controlling, or actuated in some mysterious way\nwith her foot ? If asked, I should answer \" quite.\" Think what\nlength of wire this supposition would require\u20143 feet and over\njust get a piece of jvire of this length and No. 18 gauge, which is.\nthat of an average hairpin, take it by one end and see what you\ncan do with the other\u2014you will be astonished !\nOn the second case, Seance VI., her comments are four in number :\n{a) \"After the shorthand notes ended\"\u2014Yes, because the full\nlight had been turned on, indicating the end of the\nsitting.\n\f286 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 191.o.\n{h) \" When they thought the seance was over, and therefore\ncould not have been controlling her so carefully.\" The\nmedium was standing up outside the curtain, \"her two\nfeet were controlled by those on either side of her (C. and\nF.), and her two hands held.\"\n{<:)\n\" When B. and M. were talking,\" but C. and F. listening\nand giving their whole attention to what was going forward.\n{(1)\n\" When Eusapia might have imitated the slight sound of\nthe twanging that they heard.\" She may have been able\nto do this, but those standing by her do not think so.\n\"That she does imitate sounds,\" continues Miss Stawell, \"is\nthe almost inevitable inference from the 'kiss' episode, see\nSeance VII. 12 p.m.\" But if a \" kiss,\" the sound of which is\nso easily reproduced, was so badly imitated on that occasion\nas to be described as \"clicking of the nails,\" how can we\nsuppose that she imitated the vibration of a guitar string\nso well as to deceive two critical witnesses standing one\non each side of her 1\n(13) Movements of the Curtains.\nOn the assumption that Eusapia surreptitiously got one hand free,\nit is legitimate to suppose that she used the freedom of a hand to\ncause movements of the curtain with it, but it seems to me far-\nifetched as a theory to suppose that she used the freedom of a\nihand to lay a hypothetical wire \" aslant on the floor \" \" one end\nunder her left foot, the other slipped through the opening behind\n.the edge of the right curtain,\" and then to suppose that by a jerk\nof the foot she could cause \"the whole of the left edge of the\nright curtain\" to rush out and \"completely envelop her right side.\"\nIn this connection Miss Stawell writes :\n\" For instance, she might\nhave pulled the curtain with her own hand, as B. actually caught\nher doing with the verj^ hand F. was controlling at the time \" (Seance\nVIII. 12.43, note by B.). This sentence would convey to an average\nreader the suggestion that B. had caught the medium doing some-\nthing fraudulently and surreptitiously, when in fact F. says \" She\nappeared to give these [pulls] quite openly and without concealment\nfrom me.\"\n(14) Movements of the little Stool.\nUnder this heading Miss Stawell in her remarks suggests a\nsituation so different from that disclosed by the report that it is\ndifficult to suppose her serious.\n\fMat, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 287\nShe takes two cases.\n(a) During Seance IX. 11.45, that which she describes as having\ntaken place in \" poorish light\" is spoken of by B., who was present,\nremember, as being observed in \" a very good light.\"\nAlso, if the account given by M. of his examination of the stool,\np. 514, be compared with what Miss Stawell says about it, it will at\nonce be seen what a different impression is conveyed by the report\nand the conjecture.\n(h) The second case is one from \" Seance XI. 12.26, when the\nstool climbed up the curtain.\"\nAll I can say is, that whatever force was used to make the stool\nclimb up the curtain, it was not exercised through the medium's left\nhand, because at the moment that it would have required the\nsupport of that hand or fallen to the ground, the hand named was\nbelieved by Mrs. H. to be in hers, and was felt to be there by M.,\nwhom F. saw feel for it. Miss Stawell, from experiments she has\nmade, thinks it quite possible to make a small stool climb up a\ncurtain, using her left hand only, but I fear that the movement of\nthe stool she speaks of is not the motion of the stool as reported\nby two witnesses,' namely, \" It slid past the curtain, which remained\nmotionless,\" and \"The stool appeared to slide along the stuff of the\ncurtain.\"\nMiss Stawell requires for her experiments that part of the bottom\nof the curtain be held taut and at a certain angle, and for her\ntheory, I presume, that Eusapia's left leg should be out of control.\n(15) The Touches.\nAbout the touches felt bj^ B. during the Seance X. at 12.11 and\n12.20, Miss Stawell says that they correspond suspiciously with the\npresence of a photographer, but as far as I can see, no photographer\nis reported to have been present, that is, in the room, and why\nshould his presence in another room be thought suspicious ?\n^\nThat F. found the medium's right hand in the \"Substitution\nposition \" at a moment when the position of her left hand rendered\nsubstitution impossible, strengthens the inference that the touches\nthat B. felt were not made by either of Eusapia's hands. Miss\nStawell omits to notice the statement made by F. the morning after\nthe seance was held about this incident, namely, that \" After this,\nB. and I together controlled both the medium's hands, I leaning\n1 Simply by asking the question I found that there were no photographers\npresent at all at this time, they had been dismissed previously.\n\f288 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Mat, 1910.\nover to B.'s side of the table. The touches, however, on B.'s back\nstill continued as before.\" This was at 12.13 and 12.20, when the\ncontrol was particularly attended to, and described in the report\nmade at the time.\nOf the touches during Seance XI. 12.51 Miss Stawell says :\n(a) \" These occurred after the control was no longer to be given\n[reported] in full \" \u2014but there is no reason for thinking that it wa&\nany the less rigidly maintained on that account.\n(6) Miss Stawell complains that the light was \" dim.\" It was,,\nbut what I have to complain of is that although B. says \" I can\nsee both the medium's hands on the table,\" Miss Stawell should say\nhe only thought he saw. What a man is able to see depends on\nthe goodness of his eyesight, and the man himself must, I think,\nbe a better judge of how much he sees than any other person.\n(c) Miss Stawell calls attention to the fact that it was only after\n12.56, when the curtain was blown over the table, that B. held\nboth Eusapia's hands and was touched nevertheless, and she con-\ntinues, \" Then he only held her thumbs, so that her fingers were\nfree.\" Miss Stawell puts the words \"her fingers were free\" in\nitalics, to suggest, I suppose, that those free fingers were concerned\nin the touches felt by B.^ but this is what is reported by\nwitnesses present at the time :\n\" B. now takes hold of both thumbs of medium in his right hand.\n\"F. B.'s left hand lying on the corner of the table, and a hand\nfrom inside the curtain plays with it.

Her right hand was on my left hand, but she had lifted\nher foot and placed it on the bar of her chair.\n1 Mr. Baggally says that the conditions were such that Eusapia's fingers\nwould have to have been a foot and a half long to do it.\n\fMay, 1910. The Naples Report on Eusapia Palladino. 289\n\"F. Her hand in mine on this side of the table and her left\nfoot was on mine.\"\nI fail to see how this report favours the theory of the presence\nof phosphorus.\nMiss Stawell, accepting Mr. Baggally's opinion that the lights\nseen in the presence of Carancini were produced by phosphorus,\nafter the use of which no smell was observed, argues that the lights\nnow under discussion might also have been made by phosphorus,\ndespite no smell having been perceived.\nIn the first place, I fear Miss Stawell does not appreciate the\ndanger and difficulty of dealing with phosphorus in such a way\nas to produce lights such as described, if it will produce such.^\nPhosphorus is described in the Century Didionarij as \" A solid,\nnon-metallic, combustible substance, (which) exposed to the air at\n\u2022common temperatures . . . emits a white vapour of a peculiar garlic\nodour.\" Twelve grains of phosphorus melted in half an ounce\nof olive oil and contained in a small bottle is the preparation\nusually imagined to be used for fraudulent production of \" spirit\nlights.\" On uncorking in the dark this solution emits light and,\npermit me to say, also smell.\nThere are, however, \"phosphorescent\" substances containing no\nphosphorus which may be used for this purpose, such as barium\nsulphate, which, properly prepared and sealed up in small glass\ntubes after exposure to sunlight, shines with a bright orange\ncoloured light, or calcium sulphate, which is said to shine even\nbrighter than the other when similarly dealt witli.\nBoth in this paper and in that contributed by Mr. Podmore in\nDecember, it seems to me that the authors are more anxious to\ncriticise the report of the Committee appointed to examine the\nphenomena than to ascertain what really occurred ; ljut what actually\ndid take place in Eusapia's presence is what the Committee was\nappointed to enquire into and is that about which the S.P.R. is\nparticularly concerned. The common-sense way of getting this infor-\nmation would be, if any point in the report is considered obscure, to\nrequest the witness or witnesses concerned to throw what light they\ncan upon it, and only after everj^ means to asceitain what really\noccurred had been exhausted to venture an opinion as to how it\nwas done.\n1 A few days ago a chemist who prepared for me a small bottle of\nphosphorus oil burned his hands so badly that he is now unable to do his\nbusiness and will not have completely recovered under three weeks.\n\f290 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, i9io.\nAs an illustration of what I consider the vicious method of\nenquiry, I would remark how easy it would have been for Miss\nStawell to have asked what had happened in the \"substitution of\nhands \" case, and saved herself the trouble of drawing from an\nimperfect conception of the situation the doubtful inference of \"how\nimpossible it is to remember afterwards exactly what took place\nat the moment \"\u2014the \" afterwards \" in this case being the next\nmorning.\nIn the same way Mr. Podmore also complains that the\nCommittee's report is indefinite, and \" Frequently at the critical\nmoment the statement is incomplete,\" p. 174 (2). I agree with him\nin this complaint, but the first thing that would occur to me\nif I were about to discuss the matter would be to ask those\nconcerned what the real situation had been. Mr. Podmore continues\na few lines lower down :\n\" It is probable that Eusapia's right hand\nwas under the curtain during their progress \"\u2014that is, during the\nprogress for about an hour of various phenomena. How much more\npractical applicability his inference would have, namely, the inference\nthat Eusapia used .\na freed hand between 10.58 and 11.56 to\nfraudulently impose on our Committee, had it occurred to\nhim to ascertain by enquiry whether the place where her right\nhand was supposed to be, had, in fact, been covered by the curtain\ncontinually during this hour or not. If it turned out that the\ncurtain was there all the time, so much the better for Mr.\nPodmore's contention. If it was not, then it would have been\nbetter if he had not launched a suggestion resting on inaccuracy.^\nLe M. Taylor.\nREVIEW.\nTelepathic Hallucinations : The New Vieiv of Ghosts.

Yet before any one can be competent\nto form an estimate of what evidence exists on these topics, he\nmust first have made a careful study of the possibilities of super-\n1\nOn reference to one who was present, I am informed that \"The curtain\nmost decidedly did not cover the medium's right hand continuously from\n10.58 till 11.56 as Mr. Podmore suggests.\"\n\fMay, 1910. Review. 291\nnormal mental action as exercised by living persons. It is therefore\nmost important not to lose sight of the fact that our knowledge of\ntelepathy is still in a purely empirical stage, and that no greater\nservice could be done to psychical research than to discover the laws\nwhich govern its operations and so raise it to the rank of a science.\nTo those unfamiliar with the mass of material to be found in our\nProceedings and Journal, Mr. Podmore's little book will form an\nexcellent introduction to the subject, for it contains not only a\nselection of some of the best authenticated cases, but also a clear\nand instructive exposition of the application to them of acknowledged\npsychological principles.\nTwo questions are raised in the book : whether there are\n\"ghosts\" and what \"ghosts\" are. The first question Mr. Podraore\nanswers in the affirmative, that is to say, he considers that\nthe cumulative force of the evidence for apparitions of the\nliving and the dead is too strong to be resisted. A particular case\nmay be explained by supposing error or exaggeration on the part\nof the percipient, but all collectively cannot be so explained. In\nconsidering the second question, he discusses and rejects the theory\nthat there is \" in each of us a quasi-material form . . . which can\nleave the body for a time during life, which must leave it per-\nmanently at death, and which can, under favourable conditions,\nmake itself visible to mortal eyes.\" \"There is no evidence, (he says,)\nfor such entities : for apparitions have never furnished proof of their\nkinship with matter, and recent discoveries of science show us that\nthey are to be regarded rather as sensory hallucinations \" (a term\nwhich is carefully and clearly explained by Mr. Podmore). But to\nsay this is not to say that they ai'e necessarily subjective in origin,\nfor these apparitions are often seen when the person whom they\nresemble is ill or dying ; and from a consideration of the evidence\nafforded by the Census of Hallucinations, it appears that such co-\nincidences are too numerous to be ascribed to chance. The evidence\nfor experimental and spontaneous telepathy is next briefly reviewed,\nwith special reference to the experiments conducted by Mrs. Sidgwick\nand Miss Alice Johnson, by Professor Pierre Janet, and more recently\nby Miss Clarissa Miles and Miss Hermione Ramsden. The result of\nall these experiments, in Mr. Podmore's opinion, is to establish \" the\naffection of one mind by another at a distance, as a fact.\"\nThus the theory that some ghosts are to be regarded as telepathic\nhallucinations is greatly strengthened. Moreover we find, as would\nbe expected on this hypothesis, other examples of hallucination, not\nnecessarily of human form, apparently produced by telepathic agency^\nwith examples of \"experimental ghosts,\" that is to say, \"fully\n\f292 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. May, 1910.\ndeveloped hallucinations of a human figure, produced by mental\nsuggestion.\"\n\"But if apparitions of the living may be inspired by the thoughts\nof the living, may not apparitions of the dead be inspired by\nthoughts of the dead 1 \" Mr. Podmore admits that to this question\nno certain answer can be given, but he shows that many phenomena,\nwhich at first sight may suggest telepathy from the dead, prove on\nfurther investigation explicable by telepathy from the living. E.g.\nin several cases the percipient's impression coincides with the time\nwhen the death became known to other living minds. \" Mr. George\nKing, on December 2nd, 1874, dreamt of his brother being wrecked.\n\u2022On the following morning the newspapers contained an account of\nthe foundering of his brother's ship, which had taken place on\nNovember 29th.\" At the time of Mr. King's dream \"the founder-\ning of the ship would have been known at least in the printing\noffice and by the owners of the vessel.\"\nWith regard to haunted houses, Mr. Podmore suggests that in\nmost cases, \" real sound.s, exaggerated and misinterpreted, induced\nin nervous persons a state of uneasy expectancy, and this nervous\nstate in its turn gave rise to hallucinations.\" But there remain a\nfew instances which are difficult to explain thus and which suggest\nrather some telepathic origin, and in these cases common sense points\nto the source of the apparition in the thoughts of the living, whom\nwe know, rather than in the imagined thoughts of the unknown dead.\nNevertheless, Mr. Podmore concludes that \" the investigation of\nthese phenomena is by no means complete, and though they should\nprove to be wholly l)orn of earth, these ghosts of the living and\nof the dead assuredly illustrate in a striking manner the mysterious\nworkings of the human mind and the unsuspected influence of soul\non soul. They are meteors which throw strange gleams of light\nupon the structure of the cosmos of which they form a hitherto\nneglected part.\" H. de G.

Dream.\nThe followino- case of a dream which coincided with the\ndeath of the person dreamt of was sent to us by Major-\nGeneral Carey, who carefully examined the witnesses and\nobtained their statements.\nThe dreamer's account is as follows\n30 Archers Road,\nSouthampton, April lith, 1910.\nI, Charlotte Cox, am in the service of Miss Lydia Le Cocq,\nwho resides at No. 30 Archers Road, Southampton. (I have been\nupwards of 38 years in her service and in that of her cousin, Mrs.\n\f296 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nLaurence, who died in 1889.) My mistress being in poor health,\nI am accustomed to sleep in her room.\nOn Sunday, 19th December, 1909, at about 7 a.m., I had a vivid\ndream. I thought I saw an old friend of mine standing in the door-\nway (half-open) between the bed-room and the landing. I said in\nmy dream, \" 0 here is Susan.\" She appeared to be dressed in her\nbonnet and mantle, looking quite natural, like herself as I recollect\nher, though I had not seen her for some years. Miss Le Cocq, I\nthought, turned round with a smile to welcome her, she being an\nold acquaintance, having lived for upwards of 50 years in the familj',\nwith Dr. Le Cocq, Miss Le Cocq's uncle, and Mrs. Barnes, his\ndaughter, both now deceased. She had married a Mr. Thomas\nBrailey about 20 years ago, being then upwards of 60 years of\nage, and lived with him in Guernsey till his death about three years\nago, afterwards in Jersey.\nThe dream was a short one, and I awoke at about my usual\nhour in the winter, 7 a.m.\nI mentioned the fact of having had the dream that morning,\nboth to Miss Le Cocq, and also to my fellow-servant, Lilian\nAllmeritter, who too has been 17 h years with Miss Le Cocq.\nOn the next evening, Monday, 20th December, 1909, I received a\nnotice from Messrs. Croad & Sons, Undertakers in Jersey (attached\nhereto), dated 19th December, 1909 (Post-mark Jersey, 11.45 p.m.\nDec. 19, '09) to the effect that Mrs. Thomas Brailey had died on\nthat day at The Birches, St. Saviour's, Jersey.\nA few days after I also received a letter from a friend in Jersey,\nwho mentioned the hour of the death, viz. 7 a.m. \u2014thus coinciding\nwith the time when I awoke from my dream here. I was not\naware at that time of Mrs. Brailey being ill, nor had any reason\nbefore my dream for being anxious about her. I had never dreamt\nof her before, nor have I had any other experience of a similar\ncharacter at the time of the death of any other friend of mine.\nCharlotte Cox.\nMiss Allmeritter vvrites : .\n.'\n.\n'\nApril lith, 1910.\nI am in Miss Le Cocq's service.

Krebs.\n[Dr. Krebs is an Associate of the Society who was formerly\nan Associate of the American Branch. He has for many years\nmade a special study of the trick-methods used by fraudulent\nmediums, and an article of his on the slate-writing of the\nMisses Bangs, of Chicago, with an introductory note by Dr.\nHodgson, appeared in the Journal S.P.E. for January, 1901\n(Vol. X., pp. 5-16). He writes to us that he was greatly\ndisappointed at the results of his sittings with Eusapia, which\nwere, we understand, held before the exposure advertised by\nProfessor Miinsterberg had become known. Ed.]\nIn round numbers there were a dozen guests present at both\nthe seances referred to in the following account, wliich were\nheld in Eoom 328, third floor, Lincoln Square Arcade, New\nYork, Dec. 1909 and Jan. 1910.\nA rough board partition had been erected at the farthest\nend of the room, in which was built the \" Cabinet '\n\\^\\th two\nthin black curtains hanging from the top and falling loosely\ndown to the floor covering the entrance.\nAgainst these curtains the back of the medium's chair was\n\f298 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nplaced. In front of her was the table, a very small table\nand light in weight; in fact it weighed only twelve pounds,\nand was only a foot and a half wide and about a yard long,\nmade of plain, unpainted, pine boards. The gentlemen who\noccupied the places of right and left \" control \" at various\ntimes during the two s(^ances were Dr. Frederick T. Simpson,\nhospital neurologist, of Hartford, Conn. ; Dr. Daniel Frohuian,\ntheatrical manager, of New York ; Mr. Lewis G. Mayer,\nelectrical engineer, of Philadelphia ; Mr. Frank Tilford, mer-\nchant, of New York; Mr. Bradley, business man of Florida;\nand myself. Dr. Leonard K. Hirshberg of Johns Hopkins\nUniversity requested to be placed in control, but Eusapia\nfailed to elect him\u2014perhaps wisely from her standpoint.\nThree others sat at the table, the other guests beintr distri-\nbuted around the room, mostly sitting close to the chairs or\nthe table-circle. A stenographer sat back taking notes at a\nsmall table covered with a black cloth, her note paper being\nillumined by a dim red electric bulb screened so that it could\nnot throw any light in any direction but upon her tablet.\n[The general arrangement of the room and cabinet was as\ndescribed in the account by Mr. Dorr printed in the Journal\nfor April, pp. 267-272, but Mr. .Krebs adds that the sides\nand back wall of tlie cabinet were painted black. The\nphenomena were of the usual type.]\nAbout half-an-hour after the sitting had commenced Dr.\nSimpson took the place of Mr. Mayer as right-hand \" control,\"\nand I remained in \" control \" on the left.\nAbout eleven o'clock Dr. Hirshberg disturbed the seance\nand caused a mild sensation by openly declaring that the\nwhole thing was a fraud and specifically charging that Eusapia\nhad a string attached to the flower-stand. The full light was\nturned on and the stand examined ;\nEusapia took off her black\nskirt and it was examined by me as well as her under white\nskirt, stockings, and shoes ; but no trace of a string, or hook,\nor any machine whatever was found.\nAbout half an hour after this interruption I left my chair and\ngave place to Mr. Bradley, who remained as left \" control \" the\nbalance of the evening. This change left me free to observe\nthe proceedings from various points nearer the table and\ncabinet.\n\fJune, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 299\nThe bulk of the phenomena consisted of the levitation of\nthe table, the \" blowing out \" of the curtain upon the table,\nand the movements of the flower-stand.\nThe phenomena of tlie second seance were practically the\nsame as those of the first. One variation was that not only\nwere the feet of the medium tied to each \" control's \" chair,\nbut her wrists were also tied to their wrists. Twice the knot\non left \" control's \" wrist was untied by \" John \" (Eusapia's\nspirit guide or control) and the rope thrown up upon the\nseance table.\nGeneral Explanation of the Phenoviena.\nI found substitution and thus liberation of hand or foot\ngoing on all the evening, i.e. as long as I was in \" control\n\u2014the only position in the circle in which this trick can be\ndiscerned. Other experimenters have detected this, but only\non a few sporadic occasions ;\nmy claim is that this is the core\nof the whole matter, and that Eusapia does it all the time,\nand in several ways. I apply it to the whole performance,\nand not only to occasional or fractional parts thereof.\nI ibund, then, that the major secret of her phenomena is\na free hand, or a free foot, or both, employed simultaneously.\nHer trick consists in skilfully freeing a hand or foot under\ncover of (1) the table; (2) the curtains of the cabinet; (3)\nher black dress; (4) the darkness of the room; (5) the\ncabinet curtain when \" blown out \" and lying upon the seance\ntable.\nThese are the five blinds or screens which are necessary to\nthe seance, and cover up the movements of hand and foot.\nWhen the light is lull and bright, and table tiltings and\nraps are tlie only phenomena, then the table and her skirt\nare the only blinds required, but they constitute quite good\nand sufficient ones. The withdrawal of one foot and substi-\ntution of part of the other for it, so that her one foot presses\nupon both feet of the \" controls \" at the same instant, and a\nsimilar manoeuvre with her hand, she has refined to an art.\nNo sitter who allows his mind to be dominated by \" expectant\nattention,\" diverted in the slightest degree to the \"phenomena,\"\nor hypnotized by the wonder-feeling generally pervading the\natmosphere of the circle, will ever detect the nicety of these\n\f300 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nhand and foot movements unless she bungles them, which, of\ncourse, sometimes happens. Hence she is sometimes detected\nin them by those who sit in \" control.\"\nTwo features at once aroused my suspicion :\n(1) The extreme\nnarrowness of the table\u2014only 18 inches wide; (2) the fact\nthat her feet were placed on ours instead of, as I had sup-\nposed, ours on hers, and I determined to follow out to their\nlogical conclusion the clues thus thrust upon me. It flashed\nover me instantly that this table had been made to oi'der ; its\nunusual dimensions and small weight evidently designed for\nsome unusual purposes. I saw, for instance, at a glance that\nits extreme narrowness would naturally bring the feet of the\ntwo \" controls \" close together on the floor beneath it ; and\nthen I noticed finally that the feet of the table were all\nsquare, with sharp or perfect edges, not rounded or bevelled.\nHer feet being on those of the \"controls,\" she controls them,\nnot they her. She not only wants to know, but must know\nwhere their feet are in the darkness, so that they do not get\ninto her way or into dangerous places for her work. This is\nthe reason she keeps her feet in touch with the two \" controls'\n\"\nfeet all the time. Her first shift towards freeing one foot or\nthe other is to move both feet down to the toes of both\n\" controls.\" I'rom this position either foot can be removed\nand the other one made to cover both toes at once. It is\nmuch better when the \" controls' \" feet pass each other side\nby side\u2014a position that often naturally follows, because the\ntable is so narrow ; in this position each \" control \" will feel\nwhat seems to him the entire foot pressing his. This\nmanoeuvre is done quicker than it takes to describe it. She\nfrequently taps, pats or kicks with her foot. This motion\naccustoms your foot to momentary absences of hers, and in one of\nthese momentary absences the other foot takes its place.\nThe control of hands follows two general plans: (1) When on\ntop of the table in sight, she will allow yours to rest upon hers.\n(2) When under the table and on her lap out of sight, or\nunder the \" blown out \" curtain on the table top, hers grasps\nyours or lies lightly on top of yours, and it is in this posi-\ntion that she is enabled to loosen her hand grasp gradually\nuntil only the fingers are lying flat on the back of your\nhand ; the next move is to play furtively or restlessly on\n\fjnxE, 1910. Trick- Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 301\nyour hand with the fingers of her left hand, when suddenly\nthe fingers of her right hand will take up this play with\nthe palm of it still resting upon the back of the opposite\n\" control's \" ; thus she has her left hand free.\n. This is all done skilfully, and much more rapidly than it\ntakes either to read or to write it. A free hand and a free\nfoot is the key that can unlock most of the performance that\nshe gives. I insist that it is much more essential for her to\nkeep tab on the \" controls \" than they on her, a fact which\nexplains why she is so careful and alert to keep in touch with\nyou. Several times I tried gradually and stealthily to release\nmy hand when under the table from hers in order to reach\nout in the dark and grab her free arm ; but just as soon as\nshe detected this slight sliding of my hand away from hers\nshe pressed it all the harder.\nI followed her in these hand and foot movements again and\nagain while I sat in left \" control \" ; I focussed my attention\nthere ; her slightest movement on my side I did not allow to\nescape me ; and besides this I kept my eyes practically glued\nto the leg of the table that stood between me and the medium.\nThat our two feet were close enough together to be covered\nby one of hers I ascertained when Mr. M. was my opposite\n\" control \" by simply moving my foot forward until it touched\nhis ; I had to move it less than an inch. When I did this\nI felt her move her foot up upon my instep, i.e. back to its\noriginal position. I made this little experiment towards the\nmiddle of the seance.\nThat the \" controls' \" feet do, moreover, pass each other by\ntwo or three inches and lie parallel I ascertained distinctly at\nthe second seance held January 10th. When the medium's\nankles were tied I was asked to get down and exa^mine same,\nand report to the circle. When feeling around the medium's\nankle to see how the rope had been tied, I also felt both feet\nof the two \" controls,\" and found them side by side.\nChange of \" Control \" and, the Instruction it afforded.\nWhen Mr. M. left \" control \" and Dr. S. took his place, I\ndistinctly felt her left foot slide in and upon my right, while\nthe toe of her other foot was still on the toe of my right, i.e.\nshe failed to time the bringing back of her left foot and the\n*\n\f302 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJt.

Had no change in the \" controls \" been made she would\nnot have been in such a hurry to get her foot back to the\n\" original position \" for it, and her bungle (for such it was)\nwould then not have occurred.\nThis bungling, by the way, explains, I think, why she is\nsometimes caught in her work and only sometimes ;\nfor, when\nshe is not fully alert or is perhaps scared by some sudden\naction on the part of some one in the circle, she is naturally\nin a hurry to get hand or foot back into proper place, and in\nthis hurry fails in the gradual approach or instant co-operation\nwhich is necessary to truly artistic results. As a rule she has\nfull command of herself, because she has had immense practice\nand is an artist in her line ;\nconsequently the slightest diversion\nof the \" controls' \" attention is sufficient to enable her to accom-\nplish the trick undetected, when instantly the \"phenomenon\"\nhappens, whereby attention is still more diverted from hand,\nknee, and foot to the phenomenon.\nAt every seance it is officially announced that the backs of\nEusapias feet and hands are sensitive \" extremely hyper-\naesthetic\n\"\n\u2014during the seance, ai^d for this reason the \" controls\n\"\nshould not place their feet upon hers nor hold her hands with\ntheir thumbs pressing the backs of hers, as such control is very\ndistasteful to her and makes her nervous.\nOn the subject of Eusapia's \" hyperaesthesia \" I must relate\nan experiment I made later in the evening.\nMr. H., when standing behind my chair and close to the\ncabinet in light 3 or 4, when the pale white of any one's\nhands could still be seen, stuck his hand and arm into the\ncabinet behind the curtain, which had been thrown out and\nwas lying upon the seance table. Instantly Madame Palladino\ncried out as if in pain, whereupon Mr. Carrington explained\nthat she always does this when any one thrusts their hand\ninto the cabinet when the cabinet phenomena are taking place,\nbecause the hand seems to pierce the vitality or substantial\n\fJune, 1910.

He\nhad put it into the cabinet to see if he could feel, catch, or\ndetect anything. But later in the evening, when Mr. B. was\nin my place in \" control \" and I stood behind his chair\nclose up to the cabinet, I quietly slipped on a dark glove,\nstuffed my cuff up under my black coat sleeve, and at least a\ndozen times had my whole right hand and nearly all of my\narm in the cabinet, and yet not once did she cry out for pain\nWhy not ? Simply because she could not and did not see my\ngloved hand enter the cabinet, while in the case of Mr. H.'s\nungloved hand she did. Her crying out in his case, therefore,\nwas all acting, which proves that she will turn tricks to produce\nmental effects as well as physical ones. '\nPhenomena Occdrking in Full Light.

There were four faint\nechoes, raps that imitated the rate and number of her finger\ntaps. The echoes were dull and sounded more like a distant\ndrum than a sharp, hard click such as her finger nail had made.\nThese echo-raps were made by gently thumping the heel\nor toe of her free foot against the lower extremity of the\ntable leg. I not only distinctly felt the muscular contraction\nand slight movement of her leg near the knee when she\ndid this, and also having my leg against the leg of the table\nfelt the four vibrations of the table leg, but further, looking\ndown around the corner of the table I saw the lower part\nof the black skirt hit four times against the table leg.\nTable Levitations. - . .\nDr. H., as stated above, departed early and left a sensation\nbehind, to settle which I was asked to examine the medium's\n\f304 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

I\nnoticed that it was somewhat loose or projecting, as is often\nthe case, thus furnishing a splendid little shelf into which\nthe square edge of the table foot could snugly fit and upon\nwhich it could get a perch of about a quarter of an inch.\nAll she had to do was to tilt the table and move her heel\nslightly under the leg ; then she was ready for \" levitations,\"\npartial or complete. I saw the table leg in exactly this\nposition to her foot with her black skirt between the table\nfoot and her shoe, thus hiding the presence of the latter.\nI have tried again and again, and find that you can\nproduce a \" complete levitation \" with only one hand on\nso light a table ; thus the other hand could be held in the\nair above the table and clenched, as Eusapia often does, as\nthough \" the force \" was being thrown by this muscular effort\ninto the substance of the table\u2014an occult discharge from\nthe one into the other\nThe free or fulcrum foot is in such a position that the\nprojecting edge of the sole of the shoe can also be used as\na little shelf for the sharp edge of the table foot.\nI noted very easily that when the table was levitated\n\" on all fours,\" i.e. completely levitated, all four legs being\nin the air at once, that it was never evenly levitated ; there\nwas always an angle of levitation, i.e. one corner was\nalways the highest and its diagonal opposite was the lowest.\nIn all the complete levitations the corners of the end\naway from the medium were higher than the two corners\nnear her.\nAll these features will be clearly understood from the\nsimple fact that when the left foot is used as the fulcrum\nit is under the near left leg of the table, the bottom of\nthat leg or rear edge of it resting on the vamp of the\nshoe ; while her hands, resting flat on the table, or only\none hand, press upon it and so have sufficient friction to\npull so light a table backwards and diagonally to the left\nwhich would have the effect of raising it highest at the far\nend, with the right far corner higher than the left, the left\nnear leg being 2, 3, or 4 inches from the floor and resting\nupon the heel vamp. To raise the table leg this high she\n\fJune, 1910.

When the table is levitated\nwith the right foot, the left far corner would naturally be the\nhighest point, and the right near corner the lowest.\nThus the phenomena as they actually happened are\nexplained, together with the fact that no levitation was\neven, i.e. all four corners never rose to an equal height, say\n12\" or 15\" from the floor.\nI distinctly felt the slight muscular strain or movement\nin her knee on my side at the moment when the levitation\noccurred, as I sat at the left leg ; and twice I gently pushed\nmy leg closer and felt the calf of her left leg back of where\nits true position would be if it were connected with the foot\nI felt upon mine.\nThe above considerations show how the \" controls \" feel a\nknee and a foot and think they belong to the same leg, when\nthey really belong to different legs.\nNo man could do the foot-substitution, simply because any one\nlooking under the table could see it ; but the skirt of a\nwoman hides it. Eusapia's skirt was not only over her foot\nbut also under the table foot ; hence when levitations occurred\nthe table foot seemed simply to be touching her dress in the\nmost natural way, though it really was grounded upon the\nshoe vamp under her skirt.\nPhenomena Occukking in Dim Light.\nOne thing had struck me from reading the published reports,\nand that was that the left curtain was the one generally\n\" blown out.\" I therefore hovered around the left side of\nthe cabinet and made it the centre of my observations during\nthe evening ; and my experience agrees with the reports, for\nit is a fact that the left curtain at these two seances was\nthrown out far more frequently than the right.\nCurtain BloiV7i Out.\nWhile standing during the first seance close up to Mr. B.,\nwho was on the left \" control,\" and close to the curtain as\n\f306 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nwell, whenever the light was dimmed (for that is the signal\nthat cabinet phenomena are about to come), I always focussed\nmy gaze into the cabinet through the crack between the loosely\nhanging curtain and the partition. In a moment or two the\nleft curtain was \" blown out \" or thrown forward up upon the\ntable, where it remained.\nWhen this happened I distinctly saw a pale white hand\nand black sleeve back of it pushing or throwing out the curtain.\nWhose hand and arm could this have been but Eusapia's ?\nFor the black arm that ran up from the swiftly moving pale\nwhite thing that looked like a hand ran straight up towards\nher shoulder.\nHovj she Finds Out tvhat is in the Cabinet.\nIt is sometimes stated that the articles are placed in the\ncabinet before she enters the room, and that since she does not\npull the curtains aside or otlierwise look into the cabinet, she\ncannot know what they are or where placed.\nBut all she has to do, and actually did at these stances,\nis to \" blow out \" the curtain with a free arm and then simply\nturn her head slightly to the side and look into the cabinet.\nThis was done in Light 2 and Light 3, when articles could\nstill be seen and their location easily discerned.\nI saw her deliberately do this on the right and left sides\nof the cabinet.\nMoreover, it is significant in this connection that a metro-\nnome which Dr. S. brought and placed far back in the\nmiddle of the cabinet on the floor, against the partition, could\nnot be readily seen without turning her head completely around.\nThis metronome was not touched nor disturbed during the first\nseance. But a letter from Dr. S., who was present at another\nseance the very next night, tells me that on this night the\nmetronome was moved forward from the rear of the cabinet\nby \" John \" and the pendulum of it disengaged. Why did\nthis happen the second night Dr. S. was there and not the\nfirst night ?\nBecause on the first night she evidently did not know that\nthe metronome was there, nor what the metronome was, nor\nwhat it was expected to do ; but after the first seance was\nover Dr. S., I well remember, freely talked of what he had\n\fJune, 1910. Trick-AIethods of Etisapia Palladino. 307\nhoped would happen to it aud where he had placed it in the\ncabinet. So on the second night all this occurred.\nHand and Arm in Cabinet.\nWhile moving my gloved hand around in the dark of the\ncabinet on one occasion it suddenly came into contact with\nEusapia's arm there ; what I touched felt exactly like any\nhuman arm. I knew it was hers for two reasons: (1) Mr. B.\nhad his arm lying on her lap with her right hand touching\nit and covering the other \" control's \" too ;\nstooping forward\nas I was at that moment I could readily see this. (2) When\nthis touch occurred it naturally startled her and she moved\nuneasily in her chair, turning and looking searchingly at me.\nThis action proved she had been touched. I said nothing\nand appeared to be unconcerned, which relieved her fears,\nand so she took B.'s hand in hers and moved both up and\ndown and around in the air to her left and his right, and\nin front of the cabinet, by which manoeuvre she wished to\ndemonstrate to me that what I had touched in the cabinet\na moment before was that combination ! My keeping discreet\nsilence reassured her that I would not report anything to the\ncircle, and all she had to do then was to convince me alone,\nwhich she sought to do by waving B.'s hand and hers around\nin the air, imagining that I would infer that it was the same\nhand I had touched just a moment before. But the arm I\nhad touched a moment before did not have hold of B.'s, because\nhis was quietly lying on her lap in the usual position of control.\nI could not catch the arm I touched in the cabinet because\nit was instantly withdrawn after our bump and in her\ndirection\u2014which again is very significant\u2014it did not melt\naway in the cabinet, or go to \" John \" ! No, it drew back\ntowards her, and I saw it going.\nAgain, a dentist was standing near me in the second\nseance, and when the flower-stand in the cabinet was moved\nout and lifted bodily from the seance table, he too saw the\npale white hand grasping the leg of it and lifting it up. I\nsaw that hand, and saw, moreover, that an arm was attached\nto it which ran straight up to Eusapia's shoulder, just as I\nhad seen it do before. In the second seance also the\nmandolin passed through the air over Eusapia's left shoulder\n\f308 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nand gently descended upon the seance table ; I was standing\nto the left of the medium over near the cabinet and\ndistinctly saw her right hand under the blown-out curtain\nholding the string end of the instrument and placing said\ninstrument upon the table covered by the curtain which was\nstill lying out upon it. To those sitting around the table and\nin front this thing could not be seen, simply because it\nwas protected by the curtain. On seeing this, we both\ninstinctively moved forward to get a better view into the\ncabinet and be ready for the next moving thing, which\nI wanted to get close enough to to seize ; but this proximity\nevidently made Eusapia nervous, for she ordered us to move\naway from the cabinet and retreat farther back into the room.\nSeveral times, while standing alone close to the cabinet\nbefore D. came near me, I attempted to steal forward unobserved\nin order to get close enough to scrutinize more carefully a\nlight object (size of a human hand) which I saw move from\nthe medium into the cabinet a moment or two before\nseveral of the phenomena occurred there; but every time\nEusapia watched me closely, and at last commanded me,\nthrough the interpreter, to stand away from the cabinet, on\nthe ground that my presence disturbed her \" fluid.\"\nOnce she lifted her entire left leg and laid it prone on\nboth of my knees under the table, while I was in \" control.\"\nWith this arrangement both feet were surely out of com-\nmission, for Dr. S. felt her right foot firmly on his, while\nboth of us felt her hand on ours in her lap or on the table\ntop under the \" blown-out \" curtain. With this apparently\nimpregnable \" control \" the phenomena nevertheless continued.\nBut I noticed particularly that they were such as could be\nproduced by a free left hand, such as rappings or slight bumps\nof the table at her end of it, table tiltings, movements of the\nflower-stand, and touches of a hand on my side, which was the\nleft side of the medium. When the flower-stand had fallen to\nthe floor and was then slid across it, I saw the pale white\nhand grasping its highest leg, and so distinctly that I also\nsaw that the thumb-side of the grasping hand was towards\nme. This would be the only possible position in which Eusapia\ncould grasp it with her left hand.\nThe rope with which they tied her wrists later in the seance\n\fJune, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusajna Palladino. 309'\nwas a clean, new, white rope, whiter than the skin of her\nhands. Dr. G. tied it around the sleeve of her arm just above\nher wrist ; she did not allow it to remain there, however, but\nslid it down until it was free from above the sleeve, and then\npushed it back on the bare wrist until the black sleeve\ncovered it. She explained she did this for comfort, and it\nseemed to be a very natural and non-signiticant action. But\nin view of the fact that she needs her hand and arm for\nreaching into the dark cabinet and moving things there, we\ncan readily see that so white an object as the rope around\nthe outside of a black sleeve would at once be seen and\nrecognized. It was therefore a neat and necessary precautionary\nmeasure to cover the whiteness of the rope with the blackness\nof the sleeve.\nTied with Bojyes.\nAt her own suggestion she was tied with ropes. Dr. G-.,.\nwho did the tying, wanted to tie both of her ankles together\nbut this she objected to. He was then instructed to tie\neach wrist of hers to wrist of \" controls,\" and each ankle\nto chair of \" control.\" This was done ; but each tie, according\nto instructions, had to have at least twelve inches slack in it.\nBesides this the interpreter stated that the \" controls \" were\ninstructed by Madame to yield to any pull or stress in\nany direction and not to resist same. All this gave her as\nmuch freedom of hand and foot movement as she had enjoyed\nbefore this serious looking rope was applied.\nK7wt Un tied.\nAt the second seance \" John \" untied the rope around the\nwrist of the left \"control.\" Dr. G. tied it again; the light\nwas dimmed, and again the \" control \" announced that the knot\nwas being untied, and soon it was thrown upon the seance\ntable. It seemed to be a striking act indeed.\nI was standing behind and slightly to the right of the left\n\" control,\" and had stooped forward and to the right, which\nbrought my eyes in line with the end of the seance table\nand a little below it. In this position I could see under the\ncurtain which was lying on the table, and all along the edge\nof it over to the right \" control \" ; and this is what I saw : I\nsaw the medium's left hand covering both hands of \" controls,'\"\n\f310 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nand her right arm passing under her left with her right hand\ntugging away at the knot. From the position of the right\n\" control \" (Mr. Frohnian) and curtain at that moment this\nhand might have been seen also by him ; but it could not be\nseen by the left \" control \" or by any one at the table or any\nother part of the room, because the curtain covered \" controls'\niands and hers.\nThe Mandolin.\nThe mandolin sounded twice, as though a finger were\nfurtively swept over it. But it was within easy reach of her\nright hand, and it was easy to get that right hand free from\ncontrol.\nDynamometer and Mateh Box.\nThey were lying on the table, and were mysteriously dropped\nby \" John \" into the left \" control's \" outside pocket, i.e., the\npocket nearest the medium. ,\n\u2022\nTo accomplish this neat trick all that she had to do was\n(1) To throw the left curtain out upon the table partially\ncovering the dynamometer and totally covering the match box ;\nand this was the way the curtain fell upon them. (2) With\nher free left hand to reach under the curtain and secure the\ndynamometer and match box, which was also done, for we saw\nthe dynamometer disappear under the curtain.

Prof. Miinsterberg thinks this touch can be made\nby her free foot ; that she could lift her foot to that height\nwhile seated on the chair and do it without the slightest\nchange in the position of her body. I hold that such a\ngymnastic performance is utterly impossible. The \" control\nof tliat leg would at once detect the strain and stretch of\nit and the withdrawal of her knee, which would be absolutely\nnecessary to reach the upper arm or shoulder. But even if\npossible, how could a foot mimic the squeeze of a thumb\nand fingers ? Tlie toes of the foot might press like the fingers\n\fJune, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 311\nof the hand ; but what on the foot could mimic the thumb\npressing in a direction opposite to the contracting fingers ?\nNo, it is impossible for her, thus seated, to produce so hand-\nlike a squeeze and at the height of one's shoulder. But how\nridiculously easy the squeeze becomes with a free left hand\nunder the blown-out curtain !\n< . . The Toy Piano and Metronome.\nAll sitters have noticed the fact that as a rule only those\nobjects are moved which are within reach of the medium's\narms or feet.\nHowever, there were two exceptions to this rule, namely,\nthe metronome, which was placed against the rear partition of\nthe cabinet on the floor, and the toy piano, which was also\non the floor against the left partition of the cabinet, and both\nof these objects were so low and small that it was clearly\nimpossible to reach them unless she leaned very far over to\nthe side or backward, which she never did. Nevertheless, in\nthe first seance the toy piano was seen to come out directly\nover her head, as it seemed to us, pushing the blown-out\ncurtain with it and gently falling upon or laying itself upon\nthe seance table. This was in Light 4. It was a striking\nperformance, for even if her left arm were free, how could she\nreach the piano in the first place, and then move it directly\nover her head ?\nTo answer the first question : The fiower-stand in the\ncabinet is the instrument, I feel sure, which was used to\nreach the toy piano and draw it nearer, within arm's reach.\nNote this fact, I was appointed several times during the seance\nto enter the cabinet and rearrange the contents after they\nhad been thrown into disorder by the frequent falling over of\nthe flower-stand, and in one of these excursions into the\ncabinet I found that the stand had fallen over the toy piano\nin such wise that the latter could easily have been drawn toward\nthe medium by pulling the stand. Prior to this particular\nmanifestation of the toy piano which we are now considering,\nthe flower-stand fell over in the cabinet. Then there was\nsilence ; then all of us heard something slowly sliding over the\nfloor of the cabinet as if something was sneaking around in\nthere : we watched, but nothing appeared from the cabinet as\n\f312 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nwe momentarily expected it to do ; instead some other things\nhappened\u2014some tiltings of the table, and the dynamometer\nand match box incident\u2014which attracted or distracted our\nattention, and just when we were not expecting it, lo ! the toy\npiano pushed out and landed on the seance table.\nThis flower-stand, which figures so prominently in the\nseances, is an innocent-looking, frail affair. But its three legs\ncrossing form a clever hook at the top end to \"scoop\" in\nthings lying on the floor, and the legs are good handles to\ngrasp easily ; for you can let it fall in any direction it may,\nand one leg is always up in the air, while the clear space at\nthe top end between the two legs and the top is a splendid\narrangement in which to bag objects beyond arm-reach. A\nfour-legged stand would have to be cross-stayed, which would\nsurely prevent as thorough and sure a hold on objects as the\nthree-legged arrangement provides.\nI think, therefore, she could get the metronome at another\nseance by pushing the flower-stand to fall back over it ; the\ntop of the stand would thus catch the metronome, and she\ncould draw it slowly forward within reach, just as she\nevidently did with the toy piano.\nBut even if the toy piano was brought within reach by the\nflower-stand, how could she lift it directly over her head from\nrear to front ?\nMr. B. was standing behind the right \" control,\" Mr. H.\nand I behind the left \" control.\" To one standing at the\nside, as we were located, the toy piano appeared to come out\ndirectly over her head ; but I found afterwards this was a\ncase of mal-observation, for the stenographer, who saw it from\ndirectly in front, and could therefore see the exact relation\nit had to the medium, reported it as coming out over her\nleft shoulder, as high as the top of her head,\u2014a movement\nwhich is not at all difficult to execute. So one can see how\neasy it was for her to bring out the toy piano with her\nfree left hand under the blown-out curtain and gently place\nit upon the table, all in very dim light, too.\nDr. S.'s Chair is Moved.\nDr. S.'s chair was twice pulled, with him sitting in it, of\ncourse. This seems to be too heavy a bulk of matter for\n\fJu.\\E, 1910. Trick-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 313\none woman to pull without giving open signs of muscular\neffort. Is there an explanation ? In answering this, I have\nthree points to make: (1) It happened on the side of the\ntable opposite to where I sat ; nevertheless all could dis-\ntinctly see that the slide of an inch or two (not more)\nwhich the chair made was in the direction of the medium.\nThis was very evident and also very significant. (2) It\nhappened twice. After it had happened once \" John \" was asked\nto do it again. Upon this request I focussed my whole\nattention on the foot and knee of the medium on my side\n(for at this time I was still in \" control \") and found that,\nwhen the phenomenon was repeated, there was a distinct\npressure of her foot on mine and slight muscular movement\nof knee, with slight increase of pressure against my knee.\nAll these circumstances made me think that with her free\nright hand (the left still covering both \" controls \") she\npulled the chair, and at the same instant braced herself with\nher feet and knees so as to keep her body stationary or\nimmovable. (3) On practising this afterwards with a man as\nheavy as, if not heavier than, our slender Dr. S., I found, to my\nsurprise, that it requires but a slight, somewhat sudden, mus-\ncular contraction of the arm to draw the chair towards you an\ninch or two.\nHer Trance State.\nShe occasionally yawns and hiccoughs. These signs, we are\ntold, herald or accompany the oncoming of the trance state.\nIf she is really in a trance, how can she be asking the\ninterpreter all the time what the sitters are saying whenever\nthey say anything ? If any one makes a serious remark, she\nat once asks to have the interpreter explain it to her. (She\ndoes this, in my judgment, to get cues as to which point or\nin which direction their suspicions may be tending, and to\ngovern herself and the phenomena accordingly.) How could\nshe be entranced, and at the same time keep so firm a hand\non all these questions and mental currents of the circle ?\nA dentist and I were standing right back of left \" control\nnear the cabinet ;\nEusapia, through the interpreter, asked us\nto step away and not stand so close.

This seemed to be in her favour.\nBut it really works the other way in my judgment ;\nfor, if\nI were in her place, I too would not want the light so low\nthat I could not see where people were, for some one might\napproach the cabinet unobserved by me, and there do infinite\nmischief.\nDoes any one ask why, when I detected her in these\nsubstitutions and movements, I did not then and there expose\nthe facts? For two reasons: (1) Item 4 in the \"Notes to\nSitters,\" the printed and formal instructions which Mr. Car-\nrington mails to all who engage seats, reads as follows :\n\" It is\nvery important to remember that, whatever the attitude of the\nsitter toward the Medium may be, no suspicion be openly\nmanifested at the sittings, as this is liable to spoil the\nphenomena.\" I obeyed this rule. Of all things I did not\nwant the phenomena spoiled ; on the contrary, I wished them\nto be produced and multiplied in as great numbers as possible\nin the time allotted to the seance. (2) I wanted her to have\nher own way unmolested. I was there to observe, not to\nobtrude ; to discover, and not to dictate. She was the per-\nformer, and I simply part of the audience.\nEusapia claims that she is anxious to allow sitters,\nespecially the sceptical ones, to examine everything and do\nanything they please to satisfy themselves. Not only the\nwriter, but many others besides, can bear positive evidence\nto the unquestionable fact that she does not allow any\nsuch absolute freedom. She positively refused to let me have\nmy foot on hers and my hand hold hers ; she positively\nrefused to have her ankles tied together ; she positively\nrefused to allow me to stand as close to the cabinet as I\nwanted to, etc., etc. Note carefully : she refused at the\nvery points I found to be the vital points ;\non the non-\nvital points, such as examining the table, the cabinet, the\nflower-stand, etc., she is liberal enough.\n\fJune, 1910. Triclc-Methods of Eusapia Palladino. 315\nMr. reilding says :\n\" She keeps her hand on top of the\n'r controls' ' and moves them restlessly about.\" This restless\nmotion gets the controls accustomed to the motion, which,\nas I found again and again, is her preparation for hand\nsubstitution.\n\" Her right foot on mine is kicking about.\" This is what;\nI mean by the tapping of the foot or working of it on the\ncontrol's. By this means they get accustomed to the\nmomentary absence of the medium's foot, and in that\nmomentary absence the other foot is substituted, they think-\ning, however, all the time, that it is the same one she had\nstarted out with.\nDr. Morselli conducted a series of seances with Eusapia\nat Genoa that were far more successful than the series\nconducted at Milan. Dr. Morselli noticed that muscular\ncontractions made by the medium synchronized with the\nappearance of the phenomena. \" We have almost always\nnoticed,\" the report says, \" this isochronism between the\nphenpmena and the gestures of the medium ; the effort of the\nmedium is produced on these occasions on the opposite side\nto that on which the phenomena are produced.\"\nThese two facts may be explained by the hypothesis of ^\na free hand or free foot on one side, while the other hand\nand other foot are pressing upon the \" controls','' for thus the\nmuscular contractions would be felt on one side, while the \\\nphenomena would be produced on the other.\nIt is a curious thing, to my mind, that we all had to learn\nItalian enough to say \" Bene,\" \" Controlo Bene,\" \" Molto\nBene\" (\"good,\" \"control good,\" \"very good\"). We said\nthis to encourage the medium. We had only a few minutes\nto learn this, while the medium has been with English people\noften. It is said she is an illiterate woman, but she is quite\nbright, and should have been able to learn some English words\nin all this time. Mr. Feilding writes :\n\" We have always\nbeen extremely suspicious of a substitution of feet being\nperformed. During this seance Carrington did notice a change,\nand he stooped down to feel, and found that Eusapia had\ncrossed her feet. He told me in English that the foot control\nwas not good. Eusapia, who is always annoyed when she\ndoes not know what is being said, was furious. She worked\n\f316 Journal of Society for Psychical Research.

The storm raged for about an\nhour.\"\n.\nHere she seemed to understand English perfectly well.\nConclusions.\n(1) She uses no confederate.\n(2) All the phenomena are produced in a space or area\nthat is within reach of the arm and leg of the medium, still\nfurther lengthened by the use of a flower-stand as a \" reacher,\"\nand a shoe edge as a fulcrum for levitations.\n(3) Personally I do not believe Eusapia Palladino has any\nextraordinary psychic or telekinetic power. Her whole per-\nformance seems to me, on the basis of what I saw and felt,\nto be the deception of two senses, sight and touch, assisted by\nintentional suggestions.\nInstruments of precision from the scientific laboratory are\nnot needed here. The problem, in my judgment, lies in quite\na different and far simpler field\u2014that of clever detection.\nFrom my experience of these two sittings, I would make the\nfollowing suggestions to future investigators\n(1) The medium was always dressed in a black dress. If\nshe were dressed in white her whereabouts and movements\ncould easily be seen in the dark room. This would be the\nsimplest test of all, and I therefore place it first.\nThe cabinet was painted black on the inside. The table\nwhich \" John \" moved so frequently was made of plain unpainted\npine boards ;\nwhy then had the cabinet to be painted, and\npainted black ? The answer is simple, namely : to render\nthe sleeves of her black dress unseen when she thrust her\narm inside. And another thing may be explained by this\nblack sleeve and black background, namely, that it isolates\nher hand for the sense of sight, so that sitters, seeing a\npale white hand in the cabinet, will exclaim: \"I see a hand\nunattached ;\njust a hand ; no arm with it.\" If she wore a\nwhite dress this illusion of sight could not take place.\n(2) Another simple precaution would be to place the\nmedium at the broad side of the table and have only one.\nperson in control of both her hands and both her feet at one\nand the same time.\n\fJune, 1910. Trick-Methods of Euscqna Pcdladino. Sit\n(3) I would also suggest a square table, each side of which\nis at least three feet in length. This width would compel the\n\" controls \" to sit so far apart that their feet could not be\npressed simultaneously by only one foot of the medium\nand she should then keep her hands on the table top in\nfull view.\n(4) Since she asks to be tied, her two ankles should be\ntied together with a slack of only four or five inches\u2014nob\nmore\u2014and her two wrists together with a similar slack.\n(5) But if she will allow none of these test conditions,\nthen I would advise the sitter who desires to verify my\nobservations for himself to secure the place of left \" control,\"\nsince that appeai-s to be the more active side. He will then\nhave more numerous opportunities of detecting the various\nmovements here described.\nDISCUSSION OF THE SECOND REPORT ON MRS.\nHOLLAND'S SCRIPT.\nIt is always easier to believe in spirits than in any known cause,\nbecause, knowing nothing about spirits, we are justified in crediting\nthem with omnipotence, whereas in advocating a known cause,\neven a cause so imperfectly investigated as telepathy, our very\nknowledge of the subject reveals difficulties and objections.\nAny explanation on telepathic lines of the remarkable series of\ncorrespondences in the \" Sevens \" case ^ must obviously leave gaps, and\noffer numerous points of attack. Let that l)e admitted. But it is\nhardly necessary to point out that the case points primarily to\ntelepathy as the explanation. Moreover, it invalidates by anticipation\nthe evidence to which we have all been looking as almost crucial\nthe evidence to be derived from a posthumous letter. Personally I\nhave always recognised that the explanation by telepathy from the\nliving was not wholly precluded in such a case, but if a posthumous\nletter had actually been I'ead, I should certainly have felt that the\nevidence for the action of the dead had been enormously strength-\nened. Obviously, one can feel that no longer. The possibilities of\nleakage so clearly demonstrated in this case have practically shattered\nall our hopes of obtaining evidence in that direction.\niSee Proceedings, Part LX. pp. 222-263.\nI\n\f318 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, i9io.\nBut the explanation of telepathy from the living presents, as said,\ndifficulties. Let us attempt to trace out the possible outlines of the\nprocess. Mr. Piddington ever since July 13th, 1904, has been mentally\nwhispering \"Seven\" and \"Seventy times seven\" to all the world.\nNow we know from the \"Steeple\" incident {Proc. Vol. XXII.\np. 38) that Mr. Piddington has influenced Mrs. Piper telepathically.\nFrom Mrs. Verrall's script, written also on July ISth, 1904, he\nappears also to have influenced Mrs. Verrall. (Note, as bearing upon\nthe hypothesis of communication from the dead, that this same\nscript, which gave true information about the contents of a living\nmind, gave false information, and that in the most emphatic terms,\naliout the contents of a mind no longer living. Miss Johnson\nsuggests (Part LX. p. 257) that the true information may have\ncome from the [disembodied] intelligence which planned the whole\nscheme from the other side. What, then, was the source of the\nfalse information given in the same piece of writing 1)\nThere is no direct evidence that Mr. Piddington influenced the\nmind of any other contributor to the cross-correspondence. Indeed,\nfrom the fact that all the correspondence occurred in the space of\nthree months, nearly four years after the posthumous letter was\nwritten, it seems clear that something else was needed. That some-\nthing else was no doubt Mrs. Verrall's influence. The idea of\nSeven, latent probably in Mrs. Verrall's mind for years, seems to\nhave taken definite shape on the occasion of her reading Dante,\nand to have been thence transferred, in close alliance with Dantesque\nimagery, to the other automatists. This explanation does not pre-\nclude the possibility that Mr. Piddington directly influenced the\nminds of all the automatists. If he did so, it would appear that\nhis influence was not sufficient, until reinforced by that of Mrs.\nVerrall, to arouse any mental image.\nNow let us suppose a double stream of telepathic influence acting\non the minds of the five other automatists, and tending to produce\nthe idea of Seven, allied with images from the Divine Comedy. It\nseems to me probable that the automatic association of ideas would\nproduce results such as we find recorded. The telepathic influence\nis not quite strong enough in most cases to make the ideas come\nto the surface of themselves. The imported image can only make\nitself visible when reinforced by its connection with images momen-\ntarily passing through the mind. Thus Mrs. Piper has some\nmediaeval Latin doggerel read to her, and selects from it the words\n\"angel band,\" because Mrs. Verrall has for some days past been\ntrying to say \" angel band \" to her.\nIn Miss Verrall's case the procedure appears to have been more\ncomplex. The idea of Seven is here much more conspicuous than\nthe Dante imagery. The idea of Seven calls up primarily images from\nbotany and from the book of Revelation. But these are fixed, it\nmay be, because they happen to coincide with Dante images. But\nthe Dante influence does not seem to me predominant. The attempt\nto connect [d) and (b) with Dante seems far-fetched.\nMrs. Home was apparently inaccessible to the Dante influence, and\n\fJune, 1910. Second Report on Mrs. HullancVs ScrijJt. 319\nthe allusions to Dante in Mrs. Holland's script are very dubious. The\nidea of the posthumous letter in these two cases would here seem\nto be reproduced unalloyed, but the time-coincidence points to the\nconclusion that even here Mr. Piddington's influence could jiroduce\nno eft'ect until reinforced by Mrs. Verrall's. Mrs. Piper's \"tick, lick,\ntick,\" would also point to Mr. Piddington's influence. Here, again,\nwe may suppose that Longfellow's poem passed through the mind\nby natural association of ideas, and was arrested in its passage by the\nprevious faintly impressed image of tick. But the coincidence hei'e\nmay be puiely fanciful.\nIn conclusion, may I briefly recall some experiments which present\ncertain parallel features to the cross-correspondences. In 1884 Prof.\nRichet conducted some experiments as follows : At a table were seated\nthree mediums or automatists\u2014-persons under whose unconscious\nmuscular action the table would tilt. Behind their backs, at a second\ntable, was seated an operator, who incessantly let his pencil travel\nbackwards and forwards along a printed alphabet. The alphabet\nwas further concealed by a screen from the meiliums. When the\ntable tilted a bell rang, and the letter imlicated by the pencil at\nthat moment was recorded. M. Richet him-^elf thought of a word,\nor looked at a line in the dictionary\u2014and the word would be\nspelt out, letter by letter.\nIn this experiment we have to assume a double telepathic action\nof some kind. The simplest explanation is that the \"mediums\"\nwere influenced both by Richet and by the \"operator.\" Alternatively,\nthe operator may have received Richet's thought telepathically, and\nhave telepathically influenced the mediums to tilt. The experiments\nare quoted in Froc. Vol. II. pp. 247 seq. On either explanation we\nfind here a rudimentary form of the more complex process which\nappears to be demonstrated in the recent cioss-correspondences.\nI will take the present opportunity to discuss another point. Miss\nJohnson, in criticising my account of the Latin Message incident,\nrepeats a claim originally made by Mr. Piddington. \" Mr. Podmore,\"\nshe says, \"has omitted to take into account the important fact that\nthough the Piper-Myers failed to show any real comprehension in\nthe abstract of the plan of cross-correspondences, he pointed out\nand maintained his point in the face of every discouragement\u2014that\n'\nBrowning, Hope and Star '\nwas an instance of tha kind required.\"\nIn my original criticism (published in the Contemporary Review for\nSeptember last) I designedly omitted any reference to this point,\nbecause I thought that it was not substantiated. Let us see how the\ncase stands.\n\" Browning, Hope and Star \" is a brief description of an extremely\ncomplex, allusive, and enigmatic cross-correspondence in which Mrs.\nPiper, Mrs. Verrall and Miss Verrall all took part. The relative\nscripts were written in the period between January \"iSrd and February\n17th, 1907,\u2014that is, shortly after the Latin message had been dictated.\nThe first attempt at translation of that message took place on February\n20th. In the interval, on February 11th, though not in any connection\nwith the Latin message, the Piper-Myers spontaneously referred to\n\f320 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. June, 1910.\nEvangelical, Browning, Hope and Star. Immediately after the second\nreference to the three words last quoted, Mr. Piddington, in taking\nleave of the control, asked him to reply to the Latin message at\nthe next sitting {Proc. Vol. XXII. pp. 320-1).\nIn the course of the next few days Mr. Piddington read the\nscripts of Mrs. and Miss Verrall, in which the cross-correspondence\n\"Hope, Star and Browning\" occurred, and, in his own words, before\nFebruary 20th \" I had become impressed, I may even say obsessed,\nwith the idea that Mrs. Verrall's script of January 28\u2014which had\non February 11 been described in the trance by the Piper-Myers as\n'\nHope Star and Browning '\n\u2014-was an attempt by the Verrall-Myers\nto give, by means of indirect allusions to Stanza Vil. of Aht Vogler,\nan intelligent answer to the Latin message\" (p. 330).\nNote Mr. Piddington's very candid account of the state of mind\nin which he appioached the seances of February 20th and subse-\nquent dates.\nOn February 20th there occurred the first attempt at translation.\nOn February 27th occurred two other attempts. In the interval\nbetween these two later attempts the control remarked \" I believe . .\nI have sufficiently replied to your various questions to convince the\nordinary scientific mind . .\n.\" Mr. Piddington, referring to this\nstatement, said later in the stance to the control :\n\" You say you\nhave replied\u2014tell me in what messages your reply is given.\" The\ncontrol, in answer, refers successively to \"the poems,\" \"halcyon\ndays,\" \"evangelic,\" \"shrub,\" \"syringa,\" \"the poems and cross-\ncorrespoTiding messages.\" Mr. Piddington then asks, \" What poems 1\nThe control replies, \" My own. Browning. Horace.\" At the con-\ntrol's request Mr. Piddington repeats this last utterance, and the\ncontrol continues: \"Yes; chiefly Browning's lines as given through\nMrs. Verrall and another.\n'\nMr. Piddington then told the control :\n\" I want to say that\nyou have, I believe, given an answer worthy of your intelligence,\n\u2014not to-day, I mean, but some time back\u2014but the interpretation\nmust not be mine. You must explain your answer [through Mrs.\nPiper]. . . . You could do it in two woids.\"\n-\nThe control replies, \"Hope, Star.\" Mr. PidcUmjton, \"Well? YesT'\nThe control\u2014\" Browning.\" Mr. Piddington then tells the control :\n\"In telling me that 'Browning, Hope, and a Star,' contains your\nanswer to the Latin Message you have given an answer which to\nme is both intelligible and clear.\"\nIt is hardly necessary to say that after this last explicit statement\nfrom Mr. Piddington no later reference to the connection of the\nLatin Message with \"Hope, Star and Browning\" could possess\nmuch evidential value. But in fact it does not appear that, despite\nthe strong hint given, the trance intelligence did advance much\nfurther in connecting the two ideas.\nIt is then on the conversation above summarised that Mr. Piddington\nhas based his contention that the control showed a comprehension\nof the purport of the Latin Message. And presumably Miss\nJohnson relies upon the same incident to support her statement\n\fJune, 1910. Second Report on Mrs. Holland's Scrijjt. 321\nthat the Piper-Myers \"pointed out, and maintained his point in\nthe face of every discouragement, that 'Browning, Hope and Star'\nwas an instance of the kind required.\"\nIn my view we should not even be justified in regarding the\nconnection\u2014casual and insignificant as the connection seems to be\n\u2014of the Latin Message with \"Hope, Star and Browning\" as having\nbeen effected spontaneously by the trance intelligence. The control\nsuggests several things : Mr. Piddington, on its repetition, selects\nthe word poems, and asks \"What poems'?\" The control names three\npoets and asks Mr. Piddington to repeat the sentence after him.\nAfter listening to Mr. Piddington, the control selects Browning.\nBut Browning had already been connected with Hope and Star at\na previous seance. The evidence, as it stands, would certainly not\nbe accepted in a telepathic experiment.\nFrank Podmore.\nEXPEPJMENTS IN CEYSTAL VISION AND\nHYPNOTISM.\nThe following accounts by the Kev. H. E. of experiments in\nhypnotism were sent to us by Mr. F. C. Constable. The\nfirst experiment is similar to those recorded by Mr. H. E. in\nthe Journcd for November, 1908, and November, 1909.\nNo. 7.\nFebruary =l\\st, 1910.\nApril 11, 1909. F. B. and E. E. P. F. B. had been describing\na dream. A public house called the Milkman's Arms, and a slate\nwith the drawing of a cow on it, formed part of this dream. On\nthe table was a cycling map, and F. B., having finished the above\ndescription, read from the cover of the map a list of names of places\nfor which other maps of a like kind were prepared.\nI gave the crystal to E. E. P. He held it up to his eye, and\nlooked at the lamp through it. I have never seen him use the\ncrystal like this before. He then began to describe a shop where\nmilk and butter were sold. It had marble slabs on the counter and\nferns in the window. A man with reddish wdiiskers was behind\nthe counter. Outside, it was a stjirlight night, and there were large\nelectric lamps in the street. The shop was situated in the fork of\na road. E. E. P. was able to read the name over the shop indis-\ntinctly, and thought it seemed to be Newman. He could not\nremember ever having seen the shoji, and declared he did not\nknow where it was.\nOn being hypnotised, he state4 in reply to my question, \"Where\nwas the shop you just saw in tlie crystal?\" \"At Newbury; I slept\nthere with my brother W. when we cycled through it, about seven\n\f322 Jourmd of Society for Psychical Researcli. June, 1910.\nyears ago.\" Asked why he saw the picture, he replied that F. B.\nhad mentioned Newmarket when reading out the names on the\nmap-cover. \"What had that to do with it?\" \"There was a\nrace-course there ;\nthey were making a new one and I went to see\nit.\" Further questioned about the shop, he said he thought of\nthe milk-shop when F. B. was describing his dream about the cow\ndrawn on the slate. There was a white china cow in the window\nof the shop. He did not know the name of the shop at all. Was\npressed hard on this point, but kept to his statement that he did\nnot know it. He did not say \"did not remember\" it.\nThe chain of thought seems to start with the name Newmarket.\nThis suggests racing. This suggests the racecourse at Newbury.\nAlso the description of the cow on the slate suggested the cow in\nthe window. Doubtless the name Milkman's Arms also helped. It\nis curious to note how many of F. B.'s random remarks by chance\nfitted in with a previous experience of E. E. P.'s, and suggested the\ncrystal picture. This experiment differs from others inasmuch\nas the cr3'stal gave the name (indistinctly and uncertainly) of the\nshop, ami yet E. E. P. could not recall it in his hypnotic state at\nall. He also professed entire ignorance of the name of the shop\nin his waking state.\nE. E. P. has only this once been to Newbury, arriving late in\nthe evening \" when the stars were out,\" and leaving the next\nmorning after seeing the race-course. H. E.\nThe following is a simple ease of the exaltation of memory\nunder hypnotism, the impression which then emerged having\nbeen apparently limited to the subliminal consciousness when\nit first occurred.\nFebruary lOth, 1910.\nI once gave a subject, while awake, a cedar pencil which I took\nfrom my pocket. He was to make some calculations for me, pre-\nviously to being hypnotised, and he nsed the pencil for about 5\nminutes or so. After he had been hypnotised and had completed\nthe experiment in which I was engaged, I asked him suddenly\nthe name, etc., of the maker of the pencil. He gave it me at once,\nand knew the number of the paiticular make, which was stamped\nin the usual gold letters and figures, together with the name of\nthe manufacturer. Afterwards, wiien he was awake, I offered him\n5s. if he would give me these details, but he was quite unable to,\nadding that he had never troubled to look at the pencil. Now he\nhad looked at the pencil, and he had taken in all these details,\nprobably at a glance, \u2014but he was quite unconscious of the fact.\nIt may be argued that he read my mind. But this will not help\nmuch, as [in that case] I must equally unconsciously have learnt\nthese details and stored them, for ,1 did not know in the least the\nwords or numbers on the pencil, and should be quite ready to\ndeclare I had never seen them. ' H. E.\n\fJune, 1910. Exj^erivients in Crystal Vision and Hypnotism. 323\nThe following are experiments in the timing of dreams\nthat occurred in the hypnotic state.\nMarch Idth, 1910.\nW. R S. A stoker in Royal Navy, aged 27. An exceptionally\nstrong subject, mentally and physically. He goes into a deep\nhypnotic sleep, if allowed to, \u2014so deep that it is difficult to get\nany answers to questions. While in this profound trance, he dreams.\nOn waking, he remembers these dreams which he says are the\nsame as ordinary dreams. He is not subject to dreams in normal\nsleep and has them but rarely. I suggested, while W. R. S. was\nin hypnosis, but before I let him go into the profound sleep, that\nif a dream occurred, he should give a \"grunt\" and another when\nit ended. I took the time by the second-hand of my watch that\nelapsed between the two signals. The following dreams occurred :\n(1) March 11, 1910. Sitting in No. 3 mess H.iMS. playing\nwhist. Has for partner F. C. and as opponents S. and B. Plays\nthree hands and wins. Was playing for beefsteak and (tin) peas.\nAt end of game W. R. S. goes to galley and cooks steak ; dream\nended while cooking. Brought back from deep sleep to a lighter\none, and asked how long the dream he had just had, had lasted,\nhe replied \"about half an hour.\" I then awaked W. R. S. and\nasked him if he had had a dream while asleep, to which he replied\nby relating the dream, as above. He said it was vivid and clear,\nand seemed very natural. Asked how long it lasted, he again said,\n\"about half an hour. I was able to play the three hands right\nthrough, and nearly finish cooking the steak.\" Actual time, 10\nseconds.\n(2) March 16, 1910. W. R. S. dreams: Gets on cycle at H\nto ride home. Almost directly, a child runs into him, and he comes\noff. No one hurt. Starts again, and just before getting home,\nagain runs into children playing marbles in the road, who won't\nmove for him. He kicks at one as he rides past.\nAfter waking he says this really happened a day or two before.\nThat the dream seemed to take about 20 minutes. That he could\nnever see anything clearly, \u2014all seemed dark. He was conscious\nof the handle-bars of the cycle, but nothing else. He knows he\ncan ride this journey in 20 minutes. Actual time, 25 seconds.\n(3) March 17, 1910. Dr. C present. W. R. S. dreams:\nAt No. 16 boiler in H.M.S. S. is drawing fire. Stoker B.\nis damping down. W. R. S. thinks he is standing behind B.

June, 1910.\nAzotes.\nIn dream (2) W. R. S. has a repetition in sleep of an event exactly\nas it occurred in all details. The dream differed from Nos. (1) and\n(3) in not being clear and vivid. \"He was always in darkness.\"\n\" He could feel the cycle going, but could see nothing hut the\nhandle-bars.\" \"He saw nothinaf of the road,\" etc.\nIn dreams (1) and (3) we get scenes manufactured out of various\n[actual] events. In (1), for instance, the card game [which had\nactually been] played for the supper was not whist, and it was\na \" drive,\" in which many more than four players took part. Also,\nW. R. S. has never [really] played whist at any time with S. and\nB , \u2014they would be a class of person he would not play with. But\nhe has often played with F. C, who he dreamt was his partner.\nIn [the actual event on which] dream (3) [was based], W. R. S.\ndid not pick up the fainting man, as he could not get at him,\nthe fire being between them, but Stoker C, who was not in the\ndream at all, took the man away.\nThe cause of dream (3) is interesting. I had asked Dr. C. to\nbe present to test the dream-timing, as it seemed a new experiment.\nWe had been getting\" a number of crystal visions from W. R. S.,\nand one of them we had dwelt on for some time. This was the\nvision of a railway station and a man lying on the platform with\na crowd round him, and it had occurred nine days previously. I\nhad not asked him afterwards, while in hypnosis, what it meant, and\nhe could not give any account of it in his normal state. As this\npicture came again, I sent W. R. S. to sleep and asked for an\nexplanation. He said it was Pl3'mouth N. Road station, and at\nEaster, 1902, when there, starting for his leave, a man had a\nfit on the platform just as the train came in. The man was put\ninto the train, and he got out at Exeter. Both on March 8th and\nagain on tliis occasion, W. R. S. said, while looking at the crystal,\na G. W. Railway station, for I can see G. W. R. and number 275\n\"it looks like Exeter station.\" On March 8th, he added, \"it is\non a porter.\" This man in a fit probably suggested the drean,i\n(3), which was the next experiment. H. E.\n.

Cctse. 327\nCASE.\nL 1180. Dream.\nThe following account has been communicated to us by General\nSir E. H., who, while informing us of the full names of all\nthe persons concerned, requested us to print their initials only.\nHe gives a preliminary statement of the circumstances, as\nfollows\nIn order to understand the dream, I should mention that my\nelder brother some years ago took on an additional surname, so\nthat from General H. he changed to General H.-S. I am\ncorrectly referred to as General H., or Sir R.\nMy brother decided to have a slight operation, and the doctors\nand surgeons considered there was no risk. The operation took\nplace in a Nursing Home in London on April the 25th [1910],\nand was considered a success. On the 26th he was found to be\nsuffering severely from shock, but this nearly all passed away on\nthe 27th. On the 28th he was not so well, and by night time\nthe case was very serious. On the morning of the 29th the\ndoctors decided that the only hope lay in sleep. Morphia was\ngiven every 4 hours. Before the first injection, about 7 a.m.,\nhe was quite collected and calm, and agreed to sleep. His son, R.,\nhad been with him all the time, and his daughter, B., arrived in the\nearly morning, and she exchanged a few words with her father. For\nthe rest of the day he was drowsj' under morphia. About 6.30 p.m.\nhe began to collapse, and breathed his last at 7 p.m., in the presence\nof his son and daughter and the doctors.\nBefore the operation he was in excellent health, and very\nstrong for his age, 66.\nMiss F. [the dreamer] met my brother once, a year or two ago.\nShe had met his daughter some years ago, and she met his son\non the 13th April last for the first and only time, and she knew\nslightly one of my sons, who received a telegram from his cousin\nat about 8 p.m. on the 29th, announcing the death. I have ascertained\nthat not one of these three persons had given a thought to Miss F.,\nand it would have been strange if they had.\nAt my request the lady referred to by Miss F. has signed as\ncorrect the statement made to her on Aj^ril 30th.\nMiss F. is devoted to my wife and myself; she saw us and our\ndaughter off from Victoria Station for the Continent on April\n16th; and just in fun I gave her our accident insurance tickets\n\f328 Journal of Society for Psychical ResearcJi. July, wio.\nfor the journey, requesting her to hand them over to my son in\ncase of a tragedy. Before she had heard of my brother's death,\nshe wrote to my wife and said she was anxious to hear news of\nus, as we had promised to send a postcard on arrival, and she\nmade some joking reference to the insurance tickets, but no\nmention of the dream she had had. We do not remember having\npromised to send the postcard. Miss F. is middle-aged, absolutely\nreliable, clever, very exact and methodical.\nIt will be observed that Miss F. dreamed of my brother's death\na few hours afterwards, on the night of April 29-30, but she did\nnot know of his death till the night of May 7th.\nAt about 6 p.m. on April 30th I received at Aix-les-Bains a\ntelegram from my son to say my brother had died on the 29th.\n^. R. C. H.\nr\nMiss F\/s account, dated May 8th, 1910, is as follovi^s, the\nsecond signature being that of the lady to whom she told her\ndream onl the morning after its occurrence\nAn Ac'fiount of my Dream of the niglit of A pril 29th-30th\nIn mW dream I somehow became aware of the fact, \"General\nH. is c^ad.\" There was a slight hesitation after H., as if an\ninstrun^nt at work had gone wrong, and made a hissing sound.\nThere did not seem any one about to explain, but I queried in\nmy owji mind, \"If they mean Sir R., why is his title omitted?\"\nAgainJ;'the fact was repeated, and again with the slight hesita-\ntion, ^nd the sound of an \" s,\" as in hissing, and that and the\nomiss&n \u00bbmade me feel (in my dream) that there was something\ninaocfer^te about it, though I felt convinced it had to do with\nSir jL's family, and that it was because I knew him the informa-\ntioET J^as given to me. The next morning (Saturday, April 30th)\nab'ou^ 11 a.m. I met a friend, to whom I told my dream, and I\nsaid\/\"I do wish I could hear from Aix, as I know my dream has\nsomething to do with Sir R. ; he is mixed up in it somehow, I am\nquite sure.\" So as I was anxious, I despatched a letter to Lady H.\nBut neither asleep nor aM'ake did I once think of the H.-S.'s.\nE.

Miss C, remarked, \"But\nSir R. did not go abroad ill.\" \"No,\" I replied, \"but a good\ndeal can liappen in a fortnight ; all three of them could be dead\nand buried in that time ; however, do not go away with the idea\nthat it is Sir R., for I am sure it is not, as there was no title,\nthough at the same time I know he is mixed up in it, so I wish\nthey would write.\"\nBeing still anxious, I wrote to Lady H., either that night or\nSunday afternoon, May 1st, but did not mention my dream,\nthough I stated I was anxious for news. I began my letter with\na small joke, though feeling in anydiing but a joking mood.\nLady H.'s letter of May 5th reached me on the night of May\n7th. From it I learnt, for the first time, of General H.-S.'s death\nhaving occurred on April 29th, and the thought flashed through\nray mind, that accounts for all those \" S's \" in my dream.\nStrange to say, I never once thought of the H.-S.'s untd I received\nLady H.'s letter, and yet I had met General H.-S., his son, and\ndaughter.\nE.

Miss F. writes on June\n30th, 1910 :\nI write to say positively that I had not heard of General H.-S.'s\nillness or operation previous to my dream.\nSITTINGS WITH EUSAPIA PALLADINO IN AMERICA.\nMany of our readers will probably have seen the accounts\nrecently published in some of the American newspapers\u2014especi-\nally the Ncxo York Times \u2014of frauds practised by Eusapia\nPalladino. Newspaper reports, whether favourable or the\nreverse, of matters connected with psychical research, are of\ncourse always to be received with caution, and in this case\n\f330 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1910.\nfull authentic details of the sittings in question are still\nlacking, though we hope to be furnished with them before long.\nMeanwhile, we reprint from Science of May 20th, 1910, a\npreliminary statement of the main results obtained in an\nimportant series of sittings carried out during the early part\nof this year at New York by nine Professors, of Columbia and\nother Universities, who were assisted by conjurers, amateur and\nprofessional.\nReport of an Investigation of the Phenomena connected with\nEusAPiA Palladino. . i\nThe undersigned had three sittings with the Italian medium,\nEusapia Palladino, in the Physical Laboratory at Columbia Univer-\nsity in January last. The object in view was to secure and report\nany evidence of the operation of hitherto unknown forces through\nher or in her presence.\nThough the investigation may fairlj' be called patient and\nlaborious, no convincing evidence whatever of such a phenomenon\ncould be obtained. Many indications were obtained, however, that\ntrickery was being practised on the sitters. These indications will\nbe more fully stated by the individual investigators.\nSo far as these sittings afford data for judgment, the conclusion\nof the undersigned is unfavorable to the view that any super-\nnormal power in this case exists.\nCharles L. Dana, M.D., Professor of Nervous Diseases,\nCornell University Medical College.\nAViLLlAM Hallogk, Professor of Physics, Columbia.\nDickinson S.

Wilson, Professor of Biology, Columbia.\nRobert Williams Wood, Professor of Physics, Johns\nHopkins.\nIt has been said that Eusapia finds trickery more easy than the\nexercise of her supernormal power ; that she consequently resorts\nto the former whenever the control by the sitters permits it ; and\nthat the only fair test is had when there is such control as makes\ntrickery absolutely impossible. During a fourth sitting, at which\nthe undersigned were present, something like this control was exer-\n\fJuly, 1910.

B.\nf\nPitkin, E. B. Wilson.\n* * *\nI have been present at nine sittings with Eusapia and in an\nadjoining room at a tenth. Broadly speaking, her \" phenomena,\"\nas observed in America and as reported before, fall into seven\nclasses: (1) levitations of a table, (2) rappings, (3) touches, (4)\nbreezes, (5) lights, (6) \"materializations,\" (7) movements in and\nabout the cabinet. With the lights I was not favored. Of all\nthe other classes, I can say: (1) That conclusive and detailed\nevidence was gained as to the method by which typical specimens\nof them were repeatedly produced,^ and (2) that when the medium\nwas securely held they were not produced at all.\nStatements of observations on essential points will, I trust, be\npublished later. These include each of the classes named.\n* * *\nThanks are due to Messrs. W. S. Davis, J. L. Kellogg and J. W.\nSargent, who have all had much experience, both of professional\nconjuring and of the investigation of mediums, and who gave their\ntime and invaluable services at my last two sittings. Mr. J. F.\nEinn, a merchant, who is a trained observer and an investigator of\nspiritualism, deserves special acknowledgments for his work as a\nwatcher. Dickinson S. Miller.\nI agree substantially with the committee's report. My sittings\nwith Palladino have failed to convince me that she possesses any\nunknown force. In fact, she has been detected in so much trickery\nthat there is in my opinion an extremely high probability that all\nof the manifestations which I witnessed were produced by merely\nnatural means. But I do not feel that the methods and conditions\nof our experiments were of such a kind as to warrant the rigorously\nscientific and finally conclusive verdict for which we had hoped, or\neven to justify quite the degree of emphasis expressed in the\nmajority report.\nIt has long been known that Palladino resorted to trickery, and\nthe claim has been made and will still be made that she finds it\neasier to perform fraudulently that which she can and sometimes\ndoes accomplish otherwise. The Cambridge exposure of 1895 proved\n^ Accounts are presented in the article by Professor Jastrow in Collier's WeeJcly\nfor May 14, 1910.\n\f332 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, i9io.\nthat she used trickeiy, but did not put a stop to her scientific\nvogue. I had hoped, perhaps foolishl}', that our investigation would\nbe rather more than a repetition of something already accomplished.\nAnd it seemed plain that the policy to pursue was to insist upon\nconditions of control by mechanical means, which, instead of en-\ncouraging fraud by their looseness, should be so rigorous as absolutely\nto eliminate her Avell-known tricks of foot and hand substitution.\nIf this plan had had a fair trial, and no \" phenomena \" had\nresulted, our report might have given a permanent quietus to the\nPalladino cult. W. P. Montague.\n* * -it-\nProfessor Miller has asked me to add to the statement which I\nsigned as a member of the committee, a personal report of the\nimpression made on me by the three sittings with Eusapia Palladino\nwhich I attended in January.\nJudging from the eaidier sittings which I attended on the invita-\ntion of Mr. Herewai'd Carrington, I should say that those held\nwith the committee were fairly representative as regards the class\nof phenomena which Palladino has attempted to produce in this\ncountry, though as regards quantity, rather than quality, they should\nbe regarded as poor sittings.\nI was particularly struck by an incident which occurred during the\nthird sitting (January 22, 10. .32 p.m.), which goes to show how very\ncautious one must be in accepting as evidential motions of objects\napparently out of reach of the medium.\nFrom 10.29 p.m. until 10..32 p.m. objects were moved in the\ncabinet behind E. P. while she was under the following conditions\nof control\u2014feet tied together by a rope which prevented her from\nseparating them by more than eight inches, in addition her ankles\nwere held b}' one of the sitters who had taken up a position on the\nfloor, each wrist tied to a wrist of her neighbor, on the right and\nleft, by means of a rope which allowed her ten inches free motion\nin case she should elude the tactile control which her neidibors\nwere endeavoring to keeji. The light in the room at the time was\nthat from a frosted electric bulb which I estimated to be giving\nabout four candle power, placed about four feet from tlie medium's\nhead.\nIt Avould seem that the oljjects moved in the cabinet were outside\nthe range of free motion of her hands and feet, and the motions\nseemed to be taking place under what might be called \" test condi-\ntions.\" However, the shorthand report of this sitting shows that\n\fJuly, 1910. Sittings ivith Eusapia Palladino in America. 333\nthree of the sitters were convinced that the motions were caused by\nthe medium knocking over objects in the cabinet with the back of\nher chair\u2014I noted that so soon as her chair was moved openly a few\nmoments afterwards more objects fell.\nI mention this particular incident as I think it shows how difficult it\nis to obtain really \"test conditions.\" Incidents of a similar character\nat other sittings I have attended, where at first sight the conditions\nof control seemed excellent, have rendered me extremely reluctant to\nbase an opinion as to this remarkable woman on the very interesting\nreports of her numerous European sittings, but, so far as the evidence\ncollected at the relatively uninteresting American series of sittings is\nconcerned, I think it is decidedly unfavorable to Eusapia Palladino's\npretensions.\nAugustus Trowbridge.\nAfter attending six sittings with Eusapia Palladino, I find myself in\nmuch the same position as at the start.\nMany things have occurred which I find great difficulty in ex-\nplaining by fraud while I have repeatedly seen trickery employed.\nI have succeeded in watchincr the manifestations within the cabinet\nthroughout two entire evenings, the floor being illuminated with a\nfeeble light which was thrown by means of a mirror through a crack\nbetween the bottom of the cabinet and the floor. The cabinet was\nof wood built into a doorway, so that it projected back into the\nadjoining room. My plan was to employ a powerful X-ray apparatus\nand a large fluorescent screen, so that a shadow picture of whatever\nwas (Toing on within the cabinet could be obtained in the back room\nat any instant without the knowledge of the medium.\nThe interior of the cabinet I viewed through a large hole cut in\nthe top, reclining on a mattress placed on the top of an instrument\ncase adjoining the doorway. The X-ray tube was placed within the\ninstrument case and carefully muffled, the fluorescent screen three feet\nsquare was placed against the opposite wall of the cabinet, on the\noutside of course. This apparatus was never actually used, owing\nto the sudden termination of the sittings, but it was set up and\nthorou!2;hlv tested, and sjave excellent satisfaction. I mention it as\nit may be of use to future investigators, for, if properly installed, it\nis proof against any fraud, as it can be used without the medium's\nknowledge.\nFrom my position above the cabinet I saw that whenever anything\nin the cabinet was moved the curtain was pushed back, a black\nobject reaching in from Palladino's back groping around and finally\n\f334 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1910.\nseizing the table. Those who believe in Eusapia's supernormal powers\nwill say that this was the third arm. I need not say that an X-ray\npicture of this third arm as seen on the fluorescent screen would be\nan interesting subject of study. It would not be difficult to so\narrange the apparatus that the shadow of the medium's entire body\ncould be obtained. The switch for operating the coil should be\nplaced within reach of the observer on the top of the cabinet, so\nthat the flood of rays need only be turned on when something is\ngoing on worth investigating. In this way no possible injury could\nresult.\nAt the first sitting at which the illumination of the floor was\ntried Eusapia comijlained of this light, which appeared to be quite\naccidental. I accordingly constructed a grill of vertical strips of\nthin wood, painted black. The floor of the cabinet was covered\nwith this. From her position in front Eusapia could not have seen\nthe light on account of the grill, while the observer above, looking\ndown directly between the strips, could see the illuminated floor\nwithout difficulty. The object of illuminating the floor was of course\nto obtain a luminous l^ackground against which moving objects could\nbe seen. It proved to be a very effective way of investigating cabinet\nphenomena.\nOn two occasions the black object whicli appeared was pointed,\non the third, when the table was seized, it was blunt and rounded.\nEusapia had pushed her chair back until her back was against the\ncurtain, and I doubt if what I saw was the \" third arm \" ! On the\noccasion when I held one of Eusapia's hands, nothing was disturbed\nin the cabinet, but some very fine levitations occurred, in a brilliant\nlight, and I could not only see between the medium's knees and the\nlegs of the table, but passed my other hand between them and her\nskirts. I felt very positive that the legs of the table were free from\ncontact with any part of her person.\nThe proper system of investigation, in my opinion, is the one\noutlined. Whenever I saw anything going on in the cabinet, I sent\nan electric signal to seance room, so that particular pains could be\ntaken by the persons holding her hands, to see whether the contact\nhad been broken at the moment.\nIf the phenomena are genuine it can be proved by the X-rays, I\nthink, a7id in no other way. Madam Palladino need have no fear of the\nX-ray test, if the thing seen in the cabinet is a supernormal third\narm. If the sittings had not been suddenly terminated, I feel certain\nthat at the next one we should have had a complete explanation\n\fJuly, 1910. Sittings with Eusapia Palladino in America. 335\nof how the disturbance in the cabinet was created. I am quite\nready at any time to aid Madam Palladino in establishing the\ngenuineness of her supernormal powers by means of the X-rays.\nE. W. Wood.\nThe following is a reprint, with some omissions, of the article\nby Professor Joseph Jastrow (Professor of Psychology in the\nUniversity of Wisconsin) referred to above, which appeared in\nColliers Wccldy for May 14th, 1910. It will be noted that\nthe detective devices used were only adopted after abundant\nevidence of fraud had been obtained on other occasions\nThe first seance was held at the house of Professor H. G. Lord\nof Columbia University, on April 17, 1910. Those present, besides\nProfessor and Mrs. Lord and their guest, Miss E. K. Olmsted of Buffalo,\nwere Mrs. Fabian Franklin, Mrs. F. D. Pollock, Miss Carola\nWoerishoflfer, all of New York ; Professors Dickinson S. Miller, J. B.\nFletcher, and Mr. A. A. Livingston of Columbia University ; Messrs.\nW. S. Davis, J. L. Kellogg, J. IF. Sargent, Joseph L. Rinn, and\nWarner C. Pytie of New York; Professor Joseph Jastrow of the\nUniversity of Wisconsin and lecturer in Columbia University, and\nthose Avhose names appear in italics, were also present at the seance\nof April 24, held at the same place. In addition, there were present\nat the second seance Dr. W. T. Bush, Professor W. P. Montague,\nand Mr. W. B. Pitkin, all of Columbia University.\nMr. A. A. Livingston of Columbia University kindly consented to\nact as interpreter. Eusapia arrived and departed under his escort.\nShe raised no objection to the arrangements of the sitters, though\nin many seances she selects her right and left control. As the\nseance was about to begin, the director of the seance proposed a\ntest of Eusapia's alleged power to influence by her \"force\" an electro-\nscope\u2014an experiment familiar to the medium in her European\nsittings. The apparatus was brought to the room in its paper\nwrappings, was duly disclosed and set on the table ; while the\ncompany dramatically gathered about with expressions of eager\ninterest. Eusapia was absorbed in the experiment. The whole\ndevice was a deco}', and provided a diversion and a screen of\n\" floaters,\" to conceal the entrance of two black-clothed and black-\nstockinged forms, who wriggled their way along the floor to assigned\npositions under the chairs of each pair of sitters at the sides of the\ntable. It was agreed that Eusapia's hands and feet should be\ncontrolled \" according to her instructions. The director dictated\n\f336 Journal of Society for Psychical JResearch. July, 1910.\nto a stenographer the \"events\" and the state of tlie \"control,\" the\nstenographer writing a few feet away by the light of a screened\nlamp. The dictation served the double purpose of securing a record\/\nand of making natural a good deal of talking and comment. To\nthe frequent inquiries of Eusapia, who is supposed to understand\nno English, whether all was well or what was said, the answer was\nalways reassuring, and it was stated the comment was directed to\nthe stenographer.\nThe evening proved rich in phenomena. The table rapped, rocked,,\ntilted on two legs and on one, and left the floor completely. Under\nlowered lights (signaled for by five raps of the table) the curtains\nblew apart; a swelling appeared under the left curtain; the curtain\nwas blown over the table ; a tabouret emerged from the cabinet, was\nbalanced for a moment, repeatedly advanced and retreated, and at\nlast was lifted and deposited on the seance table ; later a hand\nappeared against the cabinet over Eusapia's head ; there were more\nbulgings of the curtain, more levitations ; and then the seven raps-\nof the table, indicating the close of the seance, followed by a violent,\noutburst from Eusapia when the sitters continued to retain their\npositions. Such, with omission of all detail, was the seance. The\nphenomena were those most commonly associated with this\n\" medium.\"\nThe witness below the chair on Eusapia's left had the position of\nvantage. This was Mr. J. L. Rinn, a produce merchant of New\nYork City, who has long been deeply interested in the methods of\nmediums, and has proved himself a reliable observer. Eusapia\nbegins by placing her right foot on the left foot of her right control\n(Kellogg), and her left foot on the right foot of her left control\n(Davis). Her problem consists in freeing her left foot for service-\nand making the right foot serve to maintain contact with one foot\nof each sitter.\nThe following by Mr. Rinn: \"For a few minutes the medium\nkept her feet tapping upon the feet of Messrs. Davis and Kellogg\nwithout resting completely. Then she placed her right foot obliquely\nwith her heel on Kellogg's toe and her toe upon Davis's toe, facing\ntoward J. L. Rinn. Only one foot was in sight on the feet of\nKellogg and Davis. In a few moments, after some ejaculations in.\nItalian from the medium, the table began to wobble from side to\nside ; and a foot came from underneath the dress of the medium\nand placed the toe underneath the leg of the table on the left side-\nof the medium, and, pressing upward, gave it a little chuck into-\n\fJuly, 1910. Sittings ivith Eusapia Palladino in America. 337\nthe air. Then the foot withdrew and the leg of the table dropped\nsuddenly to the tioor. More wobbling of the table occurred. Again\nthe foot came from underneath the dress of the medium and placed\nitself underneath the leg of the table, forced the table upward from\nthe floor about half a foot, held it there for a moment, suddenly\nwithdrew its support from the table, which fell to the floor with a\nbang. Each time after a levitation, the medium would appear to\nrest her left foot upon the top of the right, which remained\nconstantly in an oblique position upon the feet of Davis and\nKellogg. At no time did she have her left foot hampered in any\nway. It was constantly moving in the space about her chair ; and\nI was lying with my face on the floor within eigJd inches of the\nleft leg of the table ; and each time that the table was lifted,\nwhether in a partial or a complete levitation, the medium's foot\nwas used as a propelling force upward. At one time the table was\nlifted about two feet up from the floor. The starting of the lifting\nwas done by the left toe of the medium under the left leg of the\ntable ; and she appeared to rise up with it, using some other portion\nof her body to raise it higher ; and from my point of observation\nit seemed as if the knee, as well as the foot, was operating when\nthe table v\/as lifted the highest. At different times throughout the\nseance the medium caused rappings upon the table by striking the\nleft leg of the table with the side of her foot about three inches\nfrom the floor.\"\nAnd now as to the manifestations from the cabinet :\n\" A short\ntime after the liirhts were lowered she swuns; her left foot free from\nher dress at the back and kicked the curtain of the cabinet\nquickly, which caused it to bulge out toward the sitters. This was\ndone several times so daringly that under the chairs where I lay it\nseemed almost impossible that the people above the table could not\nhave observed it.\n\"Later the medium placed her left leg back into the cabinet and\npulled out from behind the curtain a small table with certain\narticles upon it, which was dashed to the floor in front of the\ncabinet on the left-hand side. It remained there in varying positions\nand was kicked by the medium a number of times. At one time\nthe medium juggled the table that had been kicked out from behind\nthe curtain on the end of her left toe, holding it oft' the ground and\nbalancing it on the edge of her toe in a very clever manner, so that\nit gave the appearance as if the table was floating in the air.\n\"The light at all times, even when it was at its dimmest,\n\f338 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, loio.\npermitted me to see clearly the actions of her foot, as I was so\nclose to it that the movement of the foot caused the dress to lift\nand more or less light shine through, so that at no time had I the\nslightest doubt of the motive cause of any movement that occurred.\"\nNext a brief statement from the other floor observer, Mr. Warner\nC. Pj'ne, a student of Columbia University and trusted friend of\nProfessor Miller. Mr. Pyne moved away from Mr. Kellogg's chair.\n\"This put my head about under the center of the table, about five\ninches from the feet of Messrs. Kellogg and Davis. The light was\nvery dim. I then saw the position of Eusapia's feet very well.\nThe heel of her rifjht foot was resting on the toe and forward part\nof Mr. Kellogg's left foot, and the ball of her right foot was resting\non the toe and forward part of JMr. Davis's right foot. This left\nEusapia's left foot free.\"\nThus each floor observer corroborates the other. The same holds\nfor the cabinet phenomena. Mr. Pyne reports: \"I was now enabled\nto get a good view of what was going on, since the illumination\nwas much improved. Under the better light conditions, on two\nseparate and distinct occasions, I positively saw the medium's left\nfoot go back and touch the tabouret, which liad previously been\noverturned and was lying on the floor to the medium's left. When\nshe touched the tabouret thus with the toe of her left foot it moved.\nThe first time she did it, nobody in the company seemed to notice\nthe fact that the tabouret was moving, which seemed to give\noccasion for a second kick (a few seconds after the first). The\nsecond time she kicked it, some one in the company remarked that\nthe tabouret was moving. The so-called '\necho ' raps I saw her\nproduce on two separate occasions by hitting the lower end of the\nleft leg of the table (about two inches from the floor) with the toe\nof her left foot.\" An additional observation by Mr. Pyne, of a\nlevitation under lowered lights, is this :\n'\u2022\nSomehow she got the left\nleg of the table resting on the toes of her left foot. Her foot was\nraised ofl^ the floor about three inches, and with the table leg still\nresting on it, was moved about back and forth in the air with a\nsidewise motion.\"\nSuch are the sights seen by the two men hidden under the\nchairs. Let us turn to the evidence above-board. The critical\nposition at Eusapia's left was taken by Mr. W. S. Davis, who, like\nMr. Rinn, co-operated with Richard Hodgson in his investigations\nof mediums in behalf of the Society for Psychical Research, and is\nan expert of long training.\n\u2022\n\fJuly, 1910. Sittings ivitlt Euso,pia Palladino in America. SSO\nThat Mr. Davis was well aware that Eusapia at the outset sub-\nstituted her right for the left foot thus appears in his notes :\n\" Then\nwhen she beat the air with her fist, thereby diverting attention and\ncreating a jerky mental impression, she correspondingly slid her left\nfoot off my right foot, until I felt pressure at the toe-end of my foot\nonly, whereas there had been pressure on my instep. She then\nrocked the table from side to side, [with] all of our hands upon it,\nuniil she saw that no apparent notice had been taken of her sliding\nfoot.\n\"Thoroughly convinced that Eusapia's left foot was not resting\nupon my right foot at all, and that her other foot was touching me,\nI cautiously raised my left foot, and passing it over my right foot\nin the direction of Eusapia, was unable to touch her left leg from\nthe knee down, at the place where it should have been. After further\nrocking from side to side (giving Eusapia ample opportunity to place\nher toe under the table leg), the end of the table nearest to her\nreared up. She held Ivellogg's left hand up in the air with her\nright, while her left hand rested upon my right upon the table.\nThis rearing up occurred two or three times more ; and as there\nwere no obstreperous sceptics present to retard manifestations by\ninterfering with her methods, she felt sufRcientlj' safe to risk an\nentire levitation, and the table went up into the air several inches.\n\" This particular levitation is the prettiest thing that Eusapia\ndoes ; and it should not be confused with the miscellaneous levitations\noccurring in the second act of her performance, when the lights are\npoor, and when she gets the table up off the floor in any way she\ncan, some of her methods being exceedingly bold.\"\nThe cabinet tricks are performed partly by her left hand and\npartly by her versatile left foot. Since the hand substitutions might\nbe seen even in the gloom, the left curtain is flung over the table,\nand under cover of the curtain the hand substitutions are made.\nOf this Mr. Davis reports\n\" The evidence that she used her left hand in producing part of\nthe phenomena in the poor light is more than ample. Before a\nphenomena I usually felt her hand releasing its pressure, and during\na phenomenon contact with her appeared to be with the end of my\nfingers only ; and after a phenomenon her truant hand returned to\nmine with a firm touch, almost amounting to a grasp. Indeed, I\ncould generally tell in advance when something which her hand\ncould do would happen, and gave those near me some indications\nof that fact. Also, our hands perspired somewhat, and when her\n\f34:0 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jdlt, 1910.\nhand came back to mine, the j^ers pi ration was often chilled, pre-\nsumably depending upon the time that it had been away from\nmine. \/\n\"The curtain bulgings were upon this occasion performed in three\nways : Sitting sideways and pointing at a place on the left curtain\njust on a line with her head, she said, look, or something which\nmeant that, and then blew the curtains so that there was a slight\nripple. She has a method of controlling her lips so that she can\nblow from the side of her mouth without distorting her face or\nmaking the effort very apparent. I noticed this with my own eyes\nnot more than two feet from her head. |\n\" The principal bulgings are produced by slapping the curtain from\nthe inside with her left hand, as I ascertained by seeing part of her\narm in motion. It will be remembered that the two curtains were\nfastened at the top only and that they swung loose at the bottom,\nat both sides, and in the center. (During some of the footwork\nEusapia kept the curtains from parting at the center by catching\nthem between her own back and the back of the chair.) The third\nmethod of '\nbulging ' consisted of striking the lower end of the\ncurtain with her foot, which sent a tremor along the cloth.\n\" During general physical manifestations she at times threw both\nof her legs on my lap, but that only proved that she wasn't using\nher feet at that particular moment ; and it wasn't necessary that\nshe should, for at that very time, when her feet were resting, she\nwas using her hand.\"\nMr. Kellogg, who acted as the control on Eusapia's right, is a\nmanufacturer of trick toys and apparatus. He likewise has been\ndeeply interested in the ways of mediums and their exposure.\nThe following notes from his report support the observations\nof his companion on the left. Mr. Kellogg discovered Eusapia's\nfoot-substitution procedure independently.\n\" She placed her right foot on mine and her left on the right foot\nof Davis. This was at the beginning. The pressure was inter-\nmittent, and in a few moments it was plain that her right foot was\ndoing duty for both. The heel of her shoe only was on my foot.\nDuring the entire seance I am positive that I did not lose the position\nof her right foot or her rirjht arm. All the manifestations occurred on\nher left side. She often took my left hand and placed it on her knee,\nevidently to show me that it was quiet. She very carefully prevented\nme from reaching across to the left knee at certain times, and it was at\nthese times I was convinced that the left leij was in full action. At\n\fJuly, 1910. Sittings luitli Eusapia Palladino in America. 341\nother times she carefully placed my hand across both her knees,\nevidently to convince me that they were both quiet \u2014^as they doubtless\nwere at such times.\"\nOf the latter portion of the seance, with lowered lights, when the\ncabinet phenomena appeared, Mr. Kellogg reports :\n\"She took my left hand and placed it over her right shoulder, far\nenough to let me feel her left shoulder-blade, where I exerted some\nl^ressure with the finger-tips. With my hand in this position it was\nalmost impossible to know whether she was moving her left arm or\nnot ; hence I took the liberty of placing the ball of my lef t wrist where\nthe tips of my fingers had been, and this gave me ample opportunity to\nfeel, with my fingers thus freed, the movements of the sleeve of her left\narm without her knowing it. Then it was plain that whenever the\ncurtain was sharply 'blown' forward, it was done by her throwing\nit forward with her left hand with a quick impulsive jerk. It was\nalso plain that the hand we saw at the parting of the curtains was\nnone other than liers. The exact position is hard to describe ; but\nshe was half lying on my left arm, and this gave her plenty of\nroom for action on her left with both leg and left arm.''\nThe sitter at the end of the table, who had a good survey of the\nscene as a whole, was Mr. J. W. Sargent, a professional conjurer,\nwell-versed in sleight of hand and the tricks of professed mediums,\nand a past president of the Society of American Magicians. Mr.\nSargent corroborates, so far as his position permitted, the conclusions\nof his colleagues. He testifies that he distinctly saw a number of\nEusapia's actions, such as the throwing of the curtain out upon the\ntable with her left hand ; that the so-called spirit-hand which appeared\nbehind her head was distinctly her own left hand, the arm remaining\ninvisible because of the lack of contrast of her black sleeve atrainsfc\nthe black curtains.\nIn consideration of the notoriety attaching to the performances of\nthis medium, it was felt that no step should be omitted which might\nadd to the convincing character of the verdict. It was accordingly\ndecided to supplement if possible the positive evidence by negative\nevidence. At a second seance the following plan was successfully\ncarried out : In the first part of the evening to exercise just the\nsame lax control which inexpert sitters would use in response to\nEusapia's instructions, and to demonstrate that under these circum-\nstances (closely duplicating those of the first seance) the same\nphenomena would occur; and then, upon a given signal, to tighten\nthe control and rigidly guard both hands and both feet, and observe\n\f342 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Jult, 1910.\nwhether, under these circumstances, any \"phenomena\" would occur.\nAn interested and approving attitude was maintained, and in this\natmosphere, under lax control, levitations, curtain movements, and\ncabinet phenomena duly appeared and continued for forty minutes\nor more. Then, judiciously and expertly, Mr. Davis and Mr. Kellogg\ncontrolled all suspicious movements of her hand and foot ; and the\nphenomena slackened and stopped. They reported persistent and\nincreasingly strenuous attempts on the part of the medium to free\nthe left foot and to secure conditions favorable to the foot-substitution.\nEusapia's irritation arose ; she complained of the violence of her\nrestraint, which was in reality a most gentle but firm contact. In\nagonised tones she cried out that the director's fingers, lightly touching\nthe leather heel of her shoe, aroused in her suddenly-made-sensitive\nnerves the tortures of purgatory. Her protests grew louder, and\nwere echoed with passionate fervor by her sister-in-law, who came\nwith her to the sitting ; and at length she threatened to leave the\ntable. The observers remained unaffected, and, wary of any sudden\nmovement of Eusapia's hand or foot, continued to report her vain\nefforts to evade the control. An intermission was taken. Eusapia\ngrew calmer, was permitted to put her hands on the table, and once\nmore attempted to distract attention by exciting cries and movements\nbut all to no avail. The hours slipped by ; the same conditions were\nmaintained, and all medinmistic phenomena ceased.\nAfter the appearance of these articles, it was proposed to\nhold a test sitting under certain conditions designed to prevent\nfraud, so as to give Eusapia another chairce of showing her\ncapacity to produce genuine phenomena. Mr. Carrington, while\nadmitting the frauds practised, held to his belief in her posses-\nsion of genuine supernormal powers, and in this he was sup-\nported by Mr. Howard Thurston, a professional conjuror (former\nassistant and successor to Mr. Harry Kellar), who had witnessed\nlevitations of the table which he believed to be genuine. The\nconditions for the test sittings were arranged jointly by Mr.\nCarrington and Mr. Thurston on the one side, and Messrs.\nW. S. Davis, Einn, Kellogg and Sargent on the other, and were\nagreed to by Eusapia. She, however, failed several times to\nkeep her promise to attend, and the sitting has consequently,\nwe understand, not yet been held.\nOpinions will, no doubt, differ as to the bearing of all these\nobservations on Eusapia's phenomena taken as a whole. The\n\fJuly, 1910. Sittings with Eusccpia Palladino in America. 343\nadverse evidence is the accumulation of a large number of\nindependent observations made at different times by different\npersons ;\nthe three sittings reported by Mr. Dorr in the April\nJournal were held on December 13th, 16th and 18th, 1909 ;\nthose reported by Mr. Krebs in the June Journal on December\n17th, 1909, and January 10th, 1910,\u2014both before the incident\nof Eusapia's foot being caught in the cabinet had become\nknown ; while the sittings referred to in the present article\ntook place later and were held by other groups of persons.\nIt appears that while some individuals among these latter\nare not satisfied that the tricks discovered will fully account\nfor all the phenomena they witnessed\u2014in particular, for the\nbest cases of table-levitations\u2014none of them has expressed\nhimself as convinced that any of the phenomena are genuinely\nsupernormal ; for there may, of course, be other fraudulent\nmethods not yet discovered, and it cannot be denied that the\nmore fraud is discovered, the greater becomes the probability\nthat all the phenomena are fraudulent.\nThe reader who wishes to form an unbiassed judgment of\nthe case is recommended to study again the Naples report,\nwhich is agreed on all hands to furnish the best evidence so\nfar obtained in favour of Eusapia. It does not seem possible\nto advance the matter further\u2014one way or the other\u2014unless\nshe will submit to further tests of a more stringent kind than\nhave yet been applied to her, and her refusal to attend the test\nsitting arranged in New York permits of little hope that this\nwill ever be the case.\nNOTE ON THE ABOVE.\nBy the Hon. Everard Feilding and W. W. Baggally.\nIt is perhaps premature to express an opinion on the sittings\nreferred to in the above account, and Ave defer any detailed con-\nsideration of them until the actual shorthand reports are received,\nand until Mr. Carrington is enabled to supply his comments. For\nthe present, it will suiEce if we state that on such evidence as is\nbefore us we are neither of us moved to modify our original opinion\nas expressed in our report on the Naples sittings. The American\nevidence so far does not appear to do more than emphasize what\neverybody knew already, viz. (1) that, if allowed to cheat, Eusapia\n\fJournal of Society for Psychical Research. July, loio.\nwill certainly do so, and (2) that on certain occasions nothing of\nany evidential consequence occurs. Had we adopted what appears\nto haA'e been the American system, that is, to permit indefinite\ncheating during most of the seances and then to tighten up the\ncontrol and prevent it, and if a failure to produce phenomena had\nhappened to coincide with such prevention, we should certainly\nhave arrived at the same conclusions as the Americans. But our\neffort in the Naples sittings M'as at all times to prevent cheating,\nand the irregularity of the results was in no way to be accounted\nfor by any variation in the rigour of our control. Three out of\nour eleven seances (3rd, 4th and 10th) were practically blank so\nfar as any evidential phenomena are concerned. If these had\nhappened to be seances at which the conditions were specially\nrigorous, the inevitable conclusion would have been that the\n\"force\" failed in consequence of the severity of the conditions.\nThis was, however, not the case.\nWhen we seek to apply the explanations offered by the American\nprofessors and conjurors to what we considered evidential pheno-\n'\nmena at Naples, their inadequacy appears to us clear.\n(1) luqis. The American raps seem to resemble those which\noccurred throughout all our sittings up to the eleventh, and all of\nwhich (with one exception, Naples Report, Proceedings, Vol. XXIIL,\np. 491, Seance VIII., 11.19) we dismissed as non-evidential. But\nat the end of the eleventh seance (see Eeport, p. -554) occurred\na series to which the explanations suggested above cannot apply.\n(2) Levitations. Whether or not all the American levitations were\nproduced bj' the medium's foot, and on this jjoint the evidence of\nthe American observers themselves is decidedly conflicting, there are\nnumerous cases in the Naples Report where no such explanation is\npossible. See, e.g., Report, pp. 423, 424 (10.24), 508 (10.14), and 510.\n(3) Bulgings of tlie curtuiti. Mr. Davis speaks of these as a\n\"ripple\" producible by blowing from Eusapia's mouth. Eusapia\nconstantly blows with her mouth, and takes no pains to conceal the\nfact. But anv resultinii; tremblino-s of the curtain were never claimed\nas \"phenomena,\" nor would it have occurred to us to consider them\nas such. The real bulgings are something wholly different from\nwhat Mr. Davis describes (see Report, p. 333). If Eusapia can\nmake a curtain bulge slowly outwards by blowing at it from out-\nside, she must be even more adroit than she is credited to be.\nNor were these bulges produced by her hands from within the\ncurtain, they being almost always both visible outside ; nor by her\n\fJuly, 1910.

Such\n\" explanations \" as these are purely futile when applied to the\nNaples sittings.\n(4) A'ppearances and grasps of hands. It may be remarked that\nwhereas Mr. Podmore is convinced that these and other phenomena\nwere produced by Eusapia's right hand, the American observers\nare equally convinced that they are performed with her left. For\nan example which seems to show that neither the one nor the other\nwas concerned, see Report, p. 4-30, 11.10. It will be noticed that\none hand was held on the left corner of the table and visible, and\nthe other held under the curtain. Substitution at all events is not\npossible. See also p. 516, 12.38, when both hands were visible and\nboth feet accounted for, one being stationary and the other moving.\nAlso p. 518, 12.51, and pp. 552-553, when both the medium's hands\nwere held by the same controller.\n(5) Movements i>f objects at a distance. See Naples Report, p. 514,.\nand F.'s note, p. 520.\nIt is needless to labour our case. No amount of arguing will\naffect any one. But it is idle to suggest that a problem which\nhas puzzled so many of the best intellects in Europe for the last\ntwenty years can be disposed of so easily. We think we have said\nsufficient to justify our impenitence, and for the rest await the\nreport of Mr. Carrington.\nSOME POINTS IN THE RECENT REPORTS ON\nAUTOMATIC SCRIPTS.\nBy Alice Johnson.\nTo those who are engaged in studying the evidence\u2014obscure and\nconflicting as it is \u2014for survival after death, such criticisms as\nthose brought forward by Mr. Podmore in the last number of\nthe Journal are both welcome and valuable, and I wish to take\nthis opportunit}' of withdrawing a statement made in my Second\nReport on Mrs. Holland's script, which he has there shown to be\nunfounded. In referring to the Latin Message, I said that the\nPiper-Myers \" pointed out and maintained his point in the face of\nevery discouragement\u2014that '\nBrowning Hope and Star ' was an\ninstance of the kind [of cross-correspondence] required\" by the Latin\nMessage. This was written, someAvhat rashly, from my recollection of\nthe experiment as it was going on. After reading Mr. Podmore's\n\f346 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. July, l9io.\ncomments, I referred to the original records, which show that\nwhile it is not certain that MyerSp realised the appropriateness of\n\"Browning, Hope, and Star\" in relation to the Latin Message, his\ntentative efforts after this realisation were in no way discouraged.\nMy statement then was much exaggerated.\nThe whole incident was an extremely complicated one, and certain\npoints in the trance utterances were sufficiently dubious to admit of\ndifferences of interpretation. Under these circumstances we are clearly\nbound to minimise the evidence for the supernormal, as Mr. Podmore\n- has done. I tiiink, however, that he has gone rather too far in\nthis direction, and that his summary of the case\u2014from its omitting\nto indicate how appropriate manj' of Myersp's statements were to\nthe corresponding Verrall scripts\u2014hardly gives a fair impression of\nits evidential value. I therefore give another summary to supply\nthese omissions.\nDec. 17 th, 1906. Mr. Piddington dictates half of the first sentence\nof the message to Myersp (p. 31 5).^\nDec. nth, 1906.

As to \"Poems, my own \u2014Browning\u2014chiefly\nBrowning's lines,\" Mrs. Verrall's script of Dec. 17th, 1906, owes\nmuch of its i^hraseology to some verses by Mr. Myers, and the\nVerrall scripts included in my summary also contain allusions to or\nquotations from poems by Dryden and Blake, while the chief points\nare brought out by c|uotations from Browning.\nIt is true that \" Horace \" is not directly connected with the\ncross-correspondence, and the statement that it was so was spon-\ntaneously corrected by MyerSp at the next sitting, on March 4th,\n1907 (see p. 338); but the mention of Horace had considerable\nsignificance in this connection (see pp. 339 and 398-414).\nTaking all these records together, there is definite positive\nevidence of supernormal knowledge on the part of MyerSp as to\nthe contents of jNIrs. Verrall's scripts ; while some of the remarks\nhe makes, and the time at which these remarks are made, suggest\nat least a certain degree of comprehension of the relevancy of\n^'Browning Hope and Star\" to the Latin Message. When this\nhad once been mentioned in the trance, and Mr. Piddington had\nsignified his approval, no evidential weight is, of course, to be\nattached to repetitions of it : the important question is whether\nthe idea originated with MyerSp or with Mr. Piddington. Mr.\nPodmore inclines to the latter hypothesis. He mentions that at\nthe sitting of Feb. 11th, 1907, immediately after MyerSp had said,\n\" Look out for Hope, Star and Browning,\" Mr. Piddington asked\nhim to reply to the Latin Message at the next [really the next\nbut one] sitting; which, Mr. Podmore seems to imply, might have\ngiven MyerSp a hint. If so, it was a purely accidental hint, for\nat the time Mr. Piddington had not the least reason for suspecting\nany connection between the two topics (p. 321).\nAnother point mentioned by Mr. Piddington in the Journal for\nJan. 1909 (Vol. XIV., p. 21) may be repeated here. \"The fact\n{says he) that cross-correspondences of a complex type began to\nmake their appearance only after the second sentence of the\n\fJuly, 1910.

The trance-personalities, be it noted, were\nnever requested to translate the Latin Message. What they were\nasked to do was to send an intelligent repl}^ to it.\"\nMr. Piddington nevertheless, as he authorises me to say, agrees\nwith me in admitting the force of Mr. Podmore's general criticism\nof this case.\nIn regard to cross-correspondences in general, Mr. Podmore\nsuggests a comparison with certain early experiments in telepathy\nconducted by Professor Eichet, of which one possible explanation\nwas that the thoughts of the agent were transmitted to the per-\ncipient through the subliminal consciousness of a third person (the\n\"operator\"), whose supraliminal consciousness did not at any stage\nbecome aware of them.\nFrom the more detailed account of these experiments given in\nPhantasms of the Living (Vol. I., pp. 72-79), however, it would seem\ndoubtful whether there was any telepathic connection between the\noperator and the other persons, or whether the percipient had not\nunconsciously reckoned the point reached by the operator.^\nI do not of course dispute that an idea may exist in the sub-\nliminal consciousness without ever emerging into the supraliminal ;\nbut I maintain that the only evidence Ave can have of its existence\nmust be through its expression in some form, e.g. in automatic\nwriting. If it is not expressed at all, either explicitly or implicitly,\nwe cannot assume\u2014as I think Mr. Podmore is sometimes too ready\nto assume\u2014that it exists.\nHe prefaces his criticism of the \"Sevens case\" - with the remark:\n\" It is always easier to believe in spirits than in any known cause,\nbecause, knowing nothing about spirits, we are justified in crediting\nthem with omnipotence.\" Now, if human spirits survive bodily\ndeath, it would seem that the only method by which they could\ncommunicate at all, either with each other or with us, would be\nthrough telepathy, that is, taking telepathy in the sense in which\nit was originally defined in Pltaniasms of the Living, \u2014\"the ability\nof one mind to impress or to be impressed by another mind other-\n^The arguments iised in Phantasms against this hj'pothesis seem to me\nunconvincing.\n- ProceediiKjs, Fart LX., pp. 22'2 et seq.\n\fS50 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. July, 1910.\n\u2022wise than through the recognised channels of sense.\" It is probable\nthen that, if they survive, they have some telepathic power at least\nin regard to one another ; whereas for us evidence of their survival\nmust be afforded, if at all, by telepathic communication between us\nand them. Therefore to entertain the h3'pothesis that spiritistic\nagency may have been one of the factors in the Sevens case, is to\nmake but a small assumption in regard to the powers of the\n\" spirits.\" Far from \" crediting them with omnipotence,\" it assumes\nonly a certain degree of intelligent mental activity on their part,\nwith a certain limited power both of receiving mental impressions\nfrom the living, and so acquiring knowledge of some of their actions,\nand of transmitting mental impressions to the living, and so exerting\nsome influence on their actions, e.g. on their automatic script.\nMr. Podmore says that Mrs. Verrall's script of July 13th, 1904,\nappears to have been influenced by telepathy from Mr. Piddington,\nand observes that this script, which gave true information about\nthe contents of a living mind, gave at the same time false informa-\ntion about the contents of a mind no longer living, and he adds\n\" Miss Johnson suggests that the true information may have come\nfrom the disembodied intelligence which planned the whole scheme\nfrom the other side. What then was the source of the false infor-\nmation given in the same piece of writing 1\n\"\nIf this is a conundrum, I will ask Mr. Podmore another. Mr.\nPodmore suggests that the true information may have come from\nthe embodied intelligence of Mr. Piddington. What then was the\nsource of the false information given in the same piece of writing?\nBut why should we suppose that the true and the false informa-\ntion came from one and the same source, whatever that source may\nhave been 1 May not the false information have come from Mrs.\nVerrall's subliminal imagination, while the true information came to\nher telepathically from some mind external to her own 1\nThe reason against supposing this mind to be Mr. Piddington's is\nthat the script did not, as Mr. Podmore asserts, give \" true infor-\nmation about the contents of\" his mind. The idea in Mr. Pidding-\nton's mind was that he would endeavour after death, not before, to\ntransmit the number Seven. Mrs. Verrall's script said: \"In London\nhalf the message has come.\" This sentence was perfectly meaning-\nless if applied to what was happening and what Mr. Piddington\nwas thinking of at the time ; it did not in any way represent the\ncontents of his mind. It only made sense when applied to what\nhappened three years later ; it may be regarded in fact as a pre-\n\fJuly, 1910. Recent Reports on Automatic Scripts. 351\nmonition of what did actually happen, though this was not what\nMr. Piddington wished or expected to happen.\nMr. Podmore goes on to say :\n\" The idea of Seven, latent probably\nin Mrs. Verrall's mind for years, seems to have taken definite shape\non the occasion of her reading Dante, and to have been thence\ntransferred, in close alliance with Dantesque imagery, to the other\nautomatists.\" But the number 7 plays a very subordinate part\nin Mrs. Verrall's script, and is not there associated with Dante at\nall (see Proceedings, Part LX., pp. 225-6).\nMr. Podmore says later :\n\" Mrs. Piper has some mediaeval Latin\ndoggerel read to her and selects from it the words '\nangel band\nbecause Mrs. Verrall has for some days past been trying to say\n'\nangel band '\nto her.\"\nThe description of the souls descending on Jacob's Ladder\noccurs in Mrs. Verrall's .script of May 8th, 1908. This,\nI find, was written between 11.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m., whereas\n\" Angel band \" was mentioned by Mrs. Piper on the same day\nand at about the same hour, which\u2014allowing for the difl:erence of\ntime between England and Boston \u2014makes Mrs. Piper's utterance\nabout 4^ hours later than Mrs. Verrall's. \" For some days past\nseems therefore to be a slip of the pen ; Mr. Podmore probably\nmeans \" for some hours past.\" But it appears that, as a matter of\nfact, this was not the first time that Mrs. Piper had mentioned\n\"angel band.\" In the waking stage of April 27th, 1908, she had\nsaid \"Angels' choir\u2014seat of God,\" which is clearly intended as a\ntranslation of the words \"Angelorum chori\u2014Deus sit.\" At the sitting\nof May 4th, when Mr. Dorr read the verses through to her again,\nat the words \" Angelorum chori \" the hand wrote :\n\" Yes, angel\nchorus ;\n\" and again in the waking stage of this day she said\n\"Angels\u2014they say God sits on his throne. ... I will go join the\nheavenly choir.\"\nIt is clear then that the idea of Angel choir, chorus or band,\nwas prominent in Mrs. Piper's trance consciousness ^ for some time\nbefore it emerged in Mrs. Verrall's script.\nThis fact, which Mr. Podmore has inadvertently misrepresented\nthrough not having an opportunity of consulting the original records,\ndoes not of course affect his main argument, for the case might equally\nwell be attributed to telepathy between the automatists, no matter\nwhich of them was agent and which percipient ; that is, no matter\n1 It seems equally clear that the primary reason of its prominence lay in the\nlikeness of sound between the English and the Latin words.\n\f352 Journal of Society for PsycJdcal Research. July, 1910.\nwhich of them had the idea first. But I think that we have no right\nto maintain the existence of an idea\u2014in a suiSciently potent form for\npurposes of telepathy\u2014in any one's mind without positive evidence.\nThere is little or no evidence for the association of iSeven with Dante\nin the mind either of Mrs. Verrall, Mrs. Piper, or ^Ir. Piddington ;\nconsequently telepathic influence from any of them seems to me\ninadequate to account for a cross-correspondence compounded of\nSeven and Dante.\nMr. Podmore's description of the part played by association of ideas\nin the whole process seems to me illuminating and well founded\nThere are many cases in the scripts bearing out his notion that the\ntelepathic influence is often not strong enough to make the ideas\nemerge of themselves, and that then the imported image can only mani-\nfest itself when reinforced by its connection with images momentarily\npassing through the mind. Thus, he says, in Miss Verrall's script,\n\" the idea of Seven calls up primarily images from botany and from\nthe book of Revelation. But these are fixed, it may be, because\nthey happen to coincide with Dante images.\" Quite so, but I ask,\nwho fixed them, unless it was some one who already had in mind\nthat combination ? Again, Mr. Podmore says that in Mrs. Home's\nand Mrs. Holland's scripts the idea of the posthumous letter only\nseems reproduced, but the time coincidence suggests that \"Mr. Pid-\ndington's influence could produce no effect until reinforced by Mrs.\nVerrall's.\" But in what way can Mrs. Verrall's influence have rein-\nforced Mr. Piddington's 1 It may be argued that Mrs. Verrall's\nscript affords some evidence of subliminal knowledge that Mr.\nPiddington was trying some experiment (if his \"posthumous letter\"\nmay so be described) ; but there is no evidence of any subliminal\nknowledge on her part of the subject of his experiment, that is, of\nhis letter. On the other hand, the scripts of the other automatists,\nwhile showing some knowledge of the subject of Mr. Piddington's\nletter, seem entirely ignorant of the authorship of the letter. What\nevidence, then, is there that these scripts were influenced by Mrs.\nVerrall 1\nI think with Mr. Podmore that many of the items of this cross-\ncorrespondence, taken alone, may be accounted for by the various\ncauses mentioned in my Report and reiterated by him here ; \u2014associa-\ntion of ideas, telepathy between the automatists, and chance coincidence\n(e.g. he suggests that Mr. Piddington's \"tic\" and Mrs. Piper's \"tick\"\nis only a chance coincidence, which would of course be the natural\nexplanation, if it were the only coincidence in the case). But I\n\fJuly, 1910. Recent Reports on Automatic Scripts. 853\nthink that association of ideas fails altogether to account for the\ncoincidences, and that the coincidences are far too numerous and\ndetailed to be accounted for by chance. I understand Mr. Podmore\nto agree with me so far.\nI think also\u2014and this is where we part company \u2014that the way\nin which a large number of details, some apparently of a completely\nirrelevant kind, are woven together and fitted in to one harmonious\nscheme, suggests the action of a mind with a more extensive knowledge\nof all the circumstances, and consequently a greater power of guiding\nthem than there is any reason to attribute to any of the living\npersons concerned.\nNOTES ON CURRENT PERIODICALS.\nIn The Psi\/cliological Bulletin of April 15tli, 1910, there is an\nessay on Freud's Psychology by Dr. Ernest Jones. Any writer\nwho tries to give an intelligible account of Freud's work in a\nshort paper has unusual difficulties to overcome. One difficulty\nis that Freud's views have undergone a continuous evolution\nduring the past twenty years, and his jDresent standpoint is not\neasily understood except in the light of its historical develop-\nment. Another and greater difficulty is that Freud's Psychology\ninvolves a radical change in our attitude towards the questions\nof the structure and functioning of the mind. Its applications\nare exceedingly diverse, and much of the cogency of Freud's\narguments is derived from the confirmation and mutual support\nthat the application of them receives from widely different fields\nof study, such as psychopathology, dreams, wit, mythology and\nevery-day life.\nThe conception of the Unconscious {U nhewusstsein) as a sea\nof submerged ideas and emotions interacting with and determining\nthe course of events in the consciousness which we know by\nintrospection forms the foundation on which Freud's psychological\nsuperstructure rests. Freud's Unconscious is in truth not very\n-different from Myers's Subliminal, but it seems to be more\nacceptable to the scientific world, in so far as it has been invoked\nto account for normal and abnormal phenomena only, and does\nnot lay its supporters open to the implication of belief in\n\u2022supernormal happenings.\nThe following are some of Freud's more general and funda-\nmental principles referred to by Dr. Jones:\n(1) Psycliic determinism.\u2014Psychical processes are never\n\f354 Journal of Society for Psycliical Research. July, i9io.\nisolated or accidental phenomena. They are related to preceding\nones just as are successive physical events. There is no more\nroom for chance in the mental world than in the physical world.\n(2) Quantitative elements m affective processes. \u2014\"There is\nto be distinguished in psychical functions something (amount of\naffect, sum of excitations) which has all the attributes of a\nquantity\u2014although we have as yet no means of measuring it,\nsomething capable of being increased, diminished, displaced, or\ncarried off, and which spreads itself over the memory traces of\nideas, rather like an electric charge over the surface of the body.\"\nThe property in question may be described either in physiological\nor psychological terms. It is assumed to have a certain autonomy\nso that it can become transferred from one idea to another, the\nlatter then becoming in a sense the representative of the former.\n(3) The dynamical nature of mental 'processes. \u2014\"Accompany-\ning every mental process is a varying amount of psychical energy\nwhich roughly corresponds with what we term affect. Excessive\naccumulation of this energy results in a tension that is experi-\nenced as pain (Unlust), and there is a constant tendency towards\nthe discharge of this energy (Abfichr). The discharge is experi-\nenced as pleasure, as relief or gratification (Befriedigungserlebniss).\"\n(4) Psychical repression. \u2014The tendencies to seek pleasure and\nto avoid pain are the fundamental regulating mechanisms of\nmental processes, and such striving towards more or less definite\nends constitutes a wish in the broadest sense of the word. When\nsuch a wish must not be gratified it is repressed. \" The tendency\nof the psychical energy to discharge itself is inhibited, a local\ndamming-up takes place, and the mental process in question\nloses its former power of making free associations.\"\n(5) Intra-psychical conflict. \u2014It is the conflict between two\ntendencies or wishes that leads to the repression, and Freud\nmaintains that\n'\n' when a mental process is the seat of a com-\npetition of opposing affects, blocking {Sperrung) of the usual\nassociative activities occurs, and the mental process becomes shut\noff or dissociated.\" Consciousness exerts a censorship which pre-\nvents the emergence of the pain-producing mental process, and\nthe psychic energy pertaining to the repressed \"wish\" must find\nan 6utlet in some direction other than the direct route into\nconsciousness. In abnormal cases of repression it may be con-\nvei'ted into physical innervation or become linked with indifferent\nmental processes, so giving rise to hysterical manifestations or\nphobias and obsessions.\n\fJuly, 1910. Notes on Ctivrent Periodicals. 355\n(6) Infantile mental processes. \u2014According to Freud uncon-\nscious mental life is indestructible and the intensity of its wishes\ndoes not fade. Consequently, he lays great stress on the mental\nprocesses of early life, and believes that they form the basis of\ncharacter. They persist in the unconscious, and form the springs\nof conduct all through life. The wishes and interests of adult\nexistence are chiefly significant in so far as they ally themselves\nwith those of childhood. This association is unconscious, for the\nsignificant wishes of childhood are repressed in the course of\ntraining and education.\n(7) The importance of psycho-sexual trends. \u2014Some miscon-\nception of Freud's views has perhaps arisen owing to the\nmultiplicity of functions and mental processes whose origin he\nderives from the sexual instinct. His conception of the wide\ndomain of sex in psychology is, however, only the application in\nan unusual field of a wide generalization made lone ago by\nbiologists\u2014the dichotomy of life-interests into self-preservative\nand reproductive.\nThe main principles of Freud's psychology are thus resumed\nby Dr. Jones: \"Freud lays stress on the dynamic aspects of\nmental processes, and sees in the tendency of the affects to seek\ndischarge of their tension the motive force determining the flow\nof mental life ; he expresses this in terms of wishes. He holds\nthat unconscious mental life is rich and complex, and by the\ninteraction between it and consciousness explains the ajDparent\ndiscontinuity of conscious processes, thus adopting a deterministic\nattitude towards intuitive and apparently spontaneous mental\nevents. Much of this interaction depends on the result of con-\nflicts between various psychical trends, some of these undergoing\nrepression, so that they can be manifested only along indirect\nchannels. He attributes fundamental importance to the repressed\nwishes of early childhood life, and to the psycho-sexual systems\nof activities.\"\nFreud's views are arousing considerable interest among\npsychologists at the jaresent time, and various articles dealing\nwith the different aspects of his work have ap23eared of late in\nthe psychological journals. In the Journal of Abnormal\nPsychology, Feb. -Mar., 1910, Dr. Bernard Hart writes on \"The\nConception of the Subconscious,\" chiefly with reference to\nFreud's views. The A?nerican Journal of Psychology ,\nApril,\n1910, is almost entirely devoted to Freud's work. Five lectures\ndelivered by Freud at Clark University in September, 1909, are\n\f356 Journal of Society for Psychical Researcli. July, i9io.\ntranslated. Three lectures by Jung on \" The Association\nMethod \" are also reported. Dr. Ernest Jones writes on Freud's\ntheory of dreams, and Dr. Ferenczi, of Budapest, deals with the\nsame topic '\nin a lecture on \"The Psychological Analysis of\nDreams.\"\nT. W. M.\nThe Bevue Philosophique for April and May 1910 contains a study by\nProfessor Pierre Janet on a case of prolonged doable consciousness\nwhich he entitles Une Fdida artificielle.'^ The patient's history in\nfact presents a close resemblance to that of Dr. Azam's famous\npatient, only that in Dr. Janet's case the state of secondary\nconsciousness was produced by suggestion. The patient as a girl of\n19 was practically given over by the doctors: her stomach refused\nto retain any nourishment, she was in the extremity of feebleness\nand inanition, reduced almost to a skeleton, all but blind and deaf,\nand without sensation over the whole surface of the body. By means\nof suggestion she was put into an \"alert\" state in which she re-\ncovered her lost sensibilities and her power of retaining nourishment to\nsuch an extent that she put on 18 lbs. in three months. Gradually\nby means of suggestion the alert condition was prolonged until it\ncame about that the greater part of her life was spent in that state,\nwith great benefit to her health. Always when she \" awoke \" to\nher original state, the old digestive troubles returned, and her\ncondition was rendered the more wretched by the fact that, like\nFelida, she had entirely lost her memory of the time spent in the\nalert state.\nBut Marceline's state differs from that of Felida, as portrayed\nfor us by Dr. Azam. In this latter case we do not find two sharply\ndefined alternating memories. In Marceline's depressed state she\nloses all the memories of the alert state. But she is liable to lose\nother memories as well. Thus on one day in October 1898, in the\ndepressed state, she went back to May 189-i, and put that date on\nall her bills in the shop where she served. Her distress at the\nmistake caused a still further loss of memory, and on the next day\nshe went to resume her duties in a shop which she had left in\n1888, and being unable to find it, presented herself to M. Jules\nJanet, who had ceased to treat her in 1889, when he handed the\ncase bver to his brother. In short, in carrying his analysis a little\nfarther, M. Janet finds that the phrase alternating personality is\ntoo clear cut to fit the facts, at any rate in the case of Marceline.\nWhat we find on the physiological side are many diff\"erent degrees\nof anaesthesia and muscular disturbance : and corresponding to this\non the psychical side what may be described as fluctuations in the\nlevel of consciousness. M. Janet suggests that in the classical case\nof Felida it is possible that a closer analysis would have shown\nvariations of level in the so-called secondary personality. F.

Oct.,1910.\nOBITUAEY.\nWilliam James and Frank Podmore.\nSince the last number of the Journal appeared, we have\nsuffered heavy loss in the death of two of our most eminent\nmembers, Professor William James and Mr. Frank Podmore.\nMr. Podmore's long-continued and zealous services in the\ncollection and appraisal of evidence in all departments of our\nwork have from the beginning been of the greatest value to the\nSociety, while whatever reputation for scientific thoroughness,\ncritical acumen and sobriety of judgment it possesses in the\neyes of the serious outside public is largely due to the brilliant\nseries of studies ^ in which he showed what it has-\u2014and what it\nhas not\u2014accomplished.\nProfessor James, the foremost psychologist of his day, who\nwas President of the Society in 1894-95, by the support both\nof his name and of his unfailing and cordial sympathy, lent\nweight to its work, not only in his own country, but through-\nout the civilised world.\nAt our next meeting, as announced above, memorial papers\nwill be read, which will afterwards appear in the Proceedings.\nCASE.\nP. 281. Impression. -\n'-\n. - -\nThe following case of a premonition was received from Dr.\nEmil Mattiesen, an Associate of the Society, who collected the\nevidence for it and also kindly furnished translations of the\nwitnesses' original statements, which were written in German.\nThe full names and addresses of all the persons concerned\nwere given to us, but we were requested to print their initials\nonly. Miss L. P>.'s hrst account, which was received by\nDr. Mattiesen on July 27th 1909, was as follows:\nOn June 6th, 1908, ray father died suddenly from brain-\napoplexy, without any previous illness, having only mentioned [on\nMay 31st] a shght pain in the chest, which caused us to ask him\nto consult a physician, by whom he was pronounced perfectly\n^ His latest work, The Neirer Spiritua\/ism (published by Fisher Unwin, price\n8s. 6d. net), which was fortunately completed just before his death, will shortly\nbe reviewed in the Proceedings.\n\fOct., 1910. Case. 359\nhealthy. Now I, his daughter, had experienced the same pain\nsince May 26th, which my father took for a cold. On my men-\ntioning [on Ma)^ 31st] that to this pain there was added in m}'\ncase a peculiar feeling of suffocation, sudden breathlessness, and\ngreat anguish, my father looked at me with surprise, and he, who\nnever complained of any indisposition, confessed that he felt exactly\nthe same sensations. With me these sensations grew to an unbear-\nable degree; I took bromides, etc., but without .any effect. On\nMay 30th I was dining with my fiance and a friend in a wine\nrestaurant, when for the first time I understood this feeling of\ndread : it meant that I was to lose my father, and I said so to both\ngentlemen, who only made light of it. But I found no rest, until\nI M'ent home and waited in the front garden, and saw my father\ncome in, looking healthy and vigorous.\nThe day after this I went with the same gentlemen on an\nexcursion to a neighbouring village, where I had frequently been\nwith my father. There also I was able to stay but a few moments.\nThe ever-growing dread gave me no rest. I spoke about it to my\ncompanions, who now became annoyed about my forebodings, because\nI was spoiling their fun and wanted to go home. At home I\nfound my father in the garden occupied with his flowers, but still\nI could find no real peace.\nOn June 2nd the above-mentioned consultation took place, but in\nspite of the doctor's cheerful pronouncement, my sensations did not\nleave me. On the [previous] afternoon my father had given me a sum\nof money to take to the bank, a commission I had frequently been\nentrusted with, but which I found impossible to carry out this time.\nI asked my sister to go in my stead, as I was tortured with a sudden\nfeeling : your father is providing for you for the last time. On June\n4tli my father was free from pain, so that he made no use at all of\nthe plaster which the. doctor had advised him to put on the aching\nspot on his chest. During the following night I was awakened by\na sudden bark of our dog who slept in the passage. I as well as\nmy sister distinctly heard a low soft voice which sounded as if\nsomebody was trying to quiet the animal. Although I assumed it\nto be my brother who occupied a room at the other end of the\npassage, I was seized with an unspeakable horror and shivering, so\nthat I ran out, and found the dog sitting bolt upright, but heard\nnothing further. (My brother had heard the bark, but had not\nspoken.) In my anguish I ran into my parents' bedroom and\nroused my father. Only when I heard his voice I calmed down\n\f360 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., l9io.\nsufficiently to return to my room, but got no further sleep. For\none moment I saw with terrible clearness my father dead and laid\nout before me.\nOn June 5th in the afternoon we went out on a steamer to\nZ., an excursion place near S., in response to an invitation of\nHerr von L. for the celebration of his birthday. I found it\nimpossible to share in the festive feelings of the company, and\nwas repeatedly questioned about it, all the more as my paleness\nattracted attention. Then a ramble into the forest was proposed, in\nwhich my parents took no part. Driven by my inward dread, I\nleft the company and ran back only in order to see my father.\nDuring the afternoon of the 6th I went to the railway station to\npost an urgent letter, when suddenly this dread seized me with a\nperfectly crushing power. Having got home I found my father\nsitting at a window with a book, whereupon he read to me the\nconclusion of a novel we had been reading together. Then we went\nin to supper, after which my mother and sister went to the kitchen\nin the basement, while I remained alone with my father, who was\nreading his paper at the table, sitting behind him on the sofa and\nplaying with our dog. Suddenly my father's head sank on to the\ntable ; I lifted him up, and saw what had happened. From that\nmoment I became quiet and calm. . L. B.\nAfter carefully cross-examining Miss B. and her friends,\nDr. Mattiesen writes\nOdoler Tith, 1909.\nI have examined all the members of the household separately,\nand . . . they declare unanimously and positively that Mr. B.\nhad not complained in any way or to anybody about the oppression\non his chest before May 31st. He was noted in the town and in\nhis own house for never mentioning troubles. Besides, he was a\nrobust man and \"quite exceptionally healthy,\" who had \"never\nbeen ill or missed a day's work\" until New Year's Eve (Dec. 31st,\n1907), when he had apparently caught a severe cold, and quietly\nleft the company before midnight, without a word of explanation,\nwent to the funeral of a friend on Jan. 1st, and was delirious with\ninfluenza till the 12th. He soon recovered, however, and was able\nto look after his office duties in March. During April and May he\nwas in his usual health, not feeling any after eff'ects of his illness,\nand in excellent humour, \"always jolly.\" Miss B. had no conscious\nanxiety at all about her father during most of this time. When\n\fOct., 1910. Case. 361\nshe began to experience her objectless \"dread\" and \"restlessness,\" she\ncannot tell exactly; \"it came on gradually.\" On the 1st of May,\nperhaps, she was for the first time clearly conscious of it, when,\ngoing to a concert she had been looking forward to with much\npleasure, she felt like going home before reaching the hall. From\nthe 1st of May till the 26th this restless feeling \"never left her\nentirely,\" and she fought it, but without any success, by swallowing\nbromides which she purchased secretly, in order not to trouble her\nfamily.\nMiss B. ... is constitutionally rather strong, \"entirely without\nnerves,\" as she says herself. \"I have never known anything like\nthis before, healthy and vigorous creature that I am. Anybody\ncould testify to that. When my grandmother died some years ago,\n1 experienced nothing of the sort. My friends have often expressed\ntheir envy at my total absence of '\nnerves.' I was in perfect health\nat the time.\" . . . . ,\nDr. G. S., Miss B.'s fiance, confirms the account as follows\nAugust \\st, 1909.\nA fortnight before the death of my father-in-law, my fianc4e. Miss\nL. B., complained of a singular pain in the chest and [a feeling of]\nstrangulation in the throat, coupled with a strong sensation of\ndread ; all remedies employed produced no improvement. On May\n28th, 1908 (Ascension Day), I accompanied my fiancee on a walk\nthrough the town of S. I wanted to show her some objects in\na shop window, but she was so restless that I had to take her\nhome without having attained my end.

We\ntherefore hurried to get home, where we found my father-in-law\nsitting in his easy-chair and reading, lie spoke with great vivacity\nabout a novel he had just finished reading, and said the author had\ngot over his dinouement in a very simple manner.

But they do not touch my argument\nperhaps because it was not clearly expressed. Let me give a con-\nCrete illustration of my meaning.\nMiss Johnson (p. 3-51) takes exception to my remark \"Mrs.\nVerrall has fryr some days past,\" on the ground that Mrs. Verrall's\nscript was actually written only a few hours before Mrs. Piper's.\nMy \"some days,\" however, had been intended to refer, not to\nMrs. Verrall's script, but to the images aroused in her mind by her\nreading of Dante, which had been going on for \" the first week\nin May.\" To which Miss Johnson would probably reply (1) that\n\f364 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.\nMrs. PijDer had actually mentioned \"Angels' Choir\" on April 27th,\n(2) that I have no right to assume the existence in Mrs.\nVerrall's mind of an idea not yet expressed. (See her remarks in\nlast paragraph but one on p. 349.),\nTo all which I can only reply that Miss Johnson's remarks are\neminently just, and point to a real defect in my statement of the\ntheory of telepathy from the living.\nMiss Johnson is able to pick holes in the hypothesis of telepathy\nfrom the living. But it is not open to me, or to any one else, to retort\nby picking holes in the hypothesis of telepathy from the dead. We\nhave here no limitation of place or time. We are at liberty to credit\nthe spirits with omnipotence, because we cannot know of any limits to\ntheir povjer.\n(p. 350) In posing this \" conundrum \" I must again plead guilty\nto some obscurity of expression. I will try to restate my point\nin plain language. The same passage in Mrs. Verrall's script con-\ntains a fictitious spirit message and a piece of true information about\nMr. Piddington's contemporary proceedings. Miss Johnson suggests\nthat this piece of information possibly (or probably, I am not sure\nwhich) came from a spirit, because the mode of its presentation\nsuggests a spirit rather than the mind of Mr. Piddington. To which\nmy reply is that the subconscious mind of Mrs. Verrall, which in this\nvery passage has shown itself capable of working up imaginary details\ninto a wholly fictitious but nevertheless plausible spirit message, must\nsurely be adjudged capable of working up telepathically received\ninformation into a similar fictitious form. I could expand the argu-\nment by reference to the analogy of dreams, where a like process is\nof frequent occurrence : and by further insistence on the fact that\nthe \" spirit message \" forms, so to speak, the mould in which the\nsubconsciousness of Mrs. Verrall and of most other automatists prefers\nto cast its communications.\n[The above letter was received by me from Mr. Podmore shortly\nafter the July Journal came out. I wrote to him in reply to the\neffect (a) that he seemed to be mixing up the Paradiso and the\nPurgaforio in his comments, since what Mrs. Verrall had been reading\nwas the Purgatoiio, whereas Mrs. Piper's script, as I interpreted it,\nreferred to the Jacob's Ladder of the Paradiso ; and {h) that I fully\nadmitted the possibility that the subliminal consciousness might work\nup telepathically received information into a fictitious form, but\nthat the information about Mr. Piddington's letter was not worked\nup into a fictitious form by Mrs. Verrall's script. What the script\n\fOct., 1910. On the Recent Automatic Scripts. 365\nsaid (\"In London half the message has come\") was a true description\nof the future, though\u2014if interpreted at the time\u2014it might have\nappeared a fictitious description of the contemporary circumstances.\nThe essential part of Mr. Podmore's letter in reply to me, dated\nAugust 9th, 1910, is printed below. A. J.]\n(a) There is no mistake on my part. I think the reference of\n\" Borne far aloft on oarage of their high wings \" [in Mrs. Verrall's\nscript] to Jacob's ladder very dubious. But clearly the whole poem\nrefers to Dante, and the reading of any part of the Divine Comedy\nwould be likely to call up visions of angels. That is all that I\nmeant to imply.\n(b) \"In London half the message has come.\" I am afraid I missed\nyour point, that this sentence seemed to imply preternormal know-\nledge of the future. But there is a perfectly normal and plausible\ninterpretation at hand. The idea of cross-correspondences was already\nin the air, and Mrs. Verrall's subliminal self might naturally take\nMr. Piddington's message in London as an attempt at a cross-\ncorrespondence. I don't admit the prophecy. But I should like to\nhear whether you have any further argument in support of the\nsuggestion.\nFrank Podmore.\nOX A SITTING WITH ME. AND MES. TOMSON.\nBy Sir Oliver Lodge.\n[Sir Oliver Lodge, having been informed that Mr. Tomson hfis\nrecently claimed his authority as vouching for the inexplicable\ncharacter of certain \" cabinet \" performances, desires that the'\nfollowing contemporary report by him of the only one of tliese\nperformances which he witnessed should now be printed in the-\nJournal.\u2014Ed.]\nJanuary 'loth, 1909.\nMr. Stead kindly invited me to occupy a seat in his drawing-\nroom, while a seance was conducted with Mr. and Mrs. Tomson,\non the evening of January !^2nd, 1909, and he strongly urged\nme to attend. ,\nAs I happened to be in London for a Mansion House meet-\ning on that day, I accepted the invitation, and agreed to abide\nby conditions drafted by himself in consultation with the Hon.\nEverard Feilding, Hon. Secretary of the Society for Psychical\n\fSGfi Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., i9io\nEesearch ;\nonly stipulating that I should not be called upon\nto sign any report at the time, nor agree to any joint report,\nbut should make my own report at my own time, though in a\nspirit of fairness to all concerned.\nFor no other report than my own am I in any way respon-\n.sible, nor do I know that any other report has been made.\nWhat happened, so far as I was concerned, was this. I\nTeached Mr. Stead's house about 6.45 p.m., found a certain\nnumber of persons assembled to whom I was introduced, those\nI had previously known being Mr. Feilding and Mr. and Mrs.\nISaggally. I found also an impromptu \" cabinet \" erected in\none corner of the sitting-room, built up of ordinary iolding\nscreens so as to form sides, back, and roof, with a pair of cur-\ntains in front running with rings on a light iron rod. This\ncabinet I was invited to take to pieces and rebuild, which\naccordingly I did, examining the rug below, the corner of the\nroom behind, and removing all stray objects from the neigh-\nbourhood.\nI am able to certify that the cabinet was absolutely fair,\nand that no white material nor other objects were accessible\nfrom its interior when erected ;\nnor was there anyone behind\ndt to pass things in. A single ordinary cane chair was placed\nin the cabinet for the medium to sit upon.\nWe then waited a little time for Mr. and Mrs. Tonison, who\nwere late; but about 7.30 they arrived at the house, and,\nwithout entering the room, were conducted to their respective\n\u2022dressing-rooms by the gentlemen and ladies respectively who\nhad undertaken the office of searchers. I remained in the\ndrawing-room all the time, with the cabinet.\nBy reason of their experience in these matters I wish to\nsay that I have confidence in any careful and leisurely state-\nment made by either Mr. or Mrs. Baggally.\nAfter a further interval Mr. Tomson was brought in by\ntwo gentlemen (Mr. Feilding and Mr. Baggally), one holding\neach hand ; and at his own request they continued to hold\nhim thus until after the first manifestation.\nMrs. Tomson, attired in dark garments, was brought in\nsimilarly by two ladies (Mrs. Baggally and her lady friend),\nand was conducted straight to the cabinet, where she sat down\n\u2022on the chair, and the curtains were drawn.\n\fOct., 1910. On a Sitting with Mr. and Mrs. Tomson. 367\nThe company sat more or less facing the cabinet.\nI'rom this time Mr. Tomson, seated, and at first still held,\ntook control. He asked for the main light to be extinguished,\nleaving only a red lamp, and twice subsequently he asked for\nthat to be lowered too. He also asked for the pianola to be\nplayed. The light was regulated, at Mr. Tomson's request, by\nMiss Stead, or another, who stood near the lamp, which was\nbehind the spectators but facing the cabinet. It seemed to be\na paraffin lamp covered with red paper. The light was quite\ndim, but the position of everybody could be seen ; and the\ncabinet could be seen too.\nBefore long a bunch of white drapery was protruded through\none of the two side chinks of the curtains\u2014that on the left of\nthe spectators\u2014near the Hoor ; it was moved about a little, and\nthen withdrawn.\nIt next appeared in tlie middle chink of the curtains, again\nnear the floor, and now it gradually displayed more and more\nof itself, giving an appearance of vertical growth, till it rose to\nthe stature of a human figure, the growth being probably really\ndue to the curtain chink being gradually opened from below\nupward, while something white was gradually unfolded until it\nfilled the space behind the gap. A figure in white could now\nbe dimly seen, and after one or two apparent efforts it came\nbetween the curtains, and hesitatingly advanced a few inches\nbeyond them, but ready to retreat instantly. This was repeated\nmore than once.\nMr. Tomson, now released, rose and led me to the figure, himself\nstanding on my left and holding my right hand continuously.\nThe figure touched my head with its hands. It was certainly\na person, and had all the appearance of being the medium, but\nswathed now in gauzy white drapery thrown over the head and\narms, and over its ordinary clothes also apparently. The appear-\nance was whitish from head to foot. My hand was not\nreleased, and I did not touch anything.\nAfter I was re-seated, others were led up to a similar\nappearance, which was repeated from time to time without\nmuch variation. But occasionally a black skirt like that of\nthe medium could, by those seated, be seen on one side of the\nwhite, and immediately under it, as if the white had been\naccidentally displaced.\n\f368 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.\nThe appearance might probably be produced by hanging a\nstrip of white, gauzy material down the front of the medium\nwhile she was standing up in the middle chink of the curtains,\nwith another strip floating over head and arms.\nSo far as the face could be seen, in the dim light, it looked\nlike that of the medium.\nAt a later stage, and after several persons had entered the\ncabinet in threes, holding each other's hands, the curtains were\ndrawn partially back, and we, still seated, were called upon to\nrecognise the medium and the white figure separate, inside the\ncabinet and at the back : but nothing was distinct. All that\ncould be seen was the dim white face of the medium seated\nin her chair, and a bunch of white stuff, probably intended for\nanother form, a little ou her right and above. This part of the\ndemonstration was valueless, at least on that occasion.\nFinally, first I and then Mr. Baggally were called up to the\noutside of the cabinet and told to hold out our hands for\nsomething. Thereupon through the chink a double handful of\nsoft stuff was placed in my hands, which, when taken to the\nlight, proved to be chiefly maiden hair fern with some white\nflowers below. Something dropped from the clump as it was\nbeing handed to me, which proved to be blue violets when\nthey v\/ere subsequently picked up from the carpet. Two red\nflowers were also subsequently handed to me by some one in\nthe audience as having been part of the parcel. Probably they\nwere picked up too. The flowers and ferns I received could\nbe compressed into small compass, but they had been opened out\ninto the double handful I have described. They were not\nspecially damp, nor had they any smell that I could detect.\nThey gave me the impression of being slightly warm, i.e.,\nwarmer than ordinary fresh flowers, and of having been\ncrumpled up.\nThe lights were now turned up and the sitting ended.\nOn withdrawing the curtains the medium was seen to be\nseated asleep in her chair, clothed in black as at the beginning,\nand nothing else was in the cabinet.\nMr. and Mrs. Tomson were led off as before to their\nrespective rooms, and as they went I tried to suggest to\nthe lady-searchers to seek for the case in which the flowers\nhad presumably come ; while it was obviously desirable to\n\fOct., 1910. On a Sitting tvith Mr. and Mrs. Tomson. 3G9\nascertain what had become of the white drapery which had\nbeen seen.\nIt might, for instance, have been left in the cabinet ; which\nwas not the case. It might have been handed to Mr. Tomson,\nin which case it would be found by the gentlemen searchers.\nOr it might have been placed in a pocket of some unsuspecting\nvisitor ; but as I had not the slightest reason to suspect con-\nfederacy, this was unlikely, since there was not much chance\n\u2022of being certainly able to remove it again before detection. Or,\nfinally, it might have been retained by the medium, probably in\nless compact and elaborately disposed form than that in which\nit had been originally introduced. So a great deal depended\non the final search.\nThat of Mr. Tomson proceeded without incident, but from\nMrs. Tomson's room upstairs presently proceeded a loud,\nhysterical voice, \" I will not do it,\" repeated several times.\nMiss Stead came down for Mr. Stead, and shortly afterwards,\nMrs. Baggally and her friend descended, saying that the con-\ncluding search had not been allowed in wliat was to them a\nsatisfactory manner. So at that point the incident terminated\nas far as I was concerned, and soon afterwards I left the house.\nI wish to thank Mr. Stead for kindly giving me the oppor-\ntunity of witnessing what he no doubt considered, and probably\n\u00abtill considers, a remarkable demonstration. And I wish\nespecially to thank the searchers for endeavouring efficiently to\ndischarge their thankless and distasteful task.\nAs regards my own opinion on the subject, I regard the\naffair as a performance, in which some flimsy and compressible\nwhite drapery and some flowers are ingeniously concealed until\nthe time comes for producing them. I conjecture that the\nflowers may have been, at some early stage of the sitting,\nextracted and deposited perhaps under the chair to cool, while\nthe drapery was employed in ingenious and effective fashion.\nThe flowers were then bestowed on the company, and the\ndrapery once more concealed.\nI am not prepared to say exactly how the drapery or the\nflowers were concealed, preparatory to their introduction and\npartial removal, though I have my own ideas on the subject\nbut to my mind there was no evidence of anything of a super-\nnormal character.\n\f370 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., i9io.\nI did not, indeed, hear such a claim made by either of the\nentertainers ; I prefer to assume that their desire is to show\nhow much can be accomplished by normal means. If the\nexhibition of any supernormal power is claimed, then I strongly\nrepudiate the idea.\nEUSAPIA PALLADINO AND FRAUD.\nBy Hereward Carrington.\nIt is becoming daily more certain, I think, that psychical research\nwill win its due recognition only by the constant accumulation of\nnew facts, and not by the requotation of the old ones. Argument\nas to past experiments yields but contradictory results (as we have\nseen in the discussion of the Naples Report), and finally convinces\nneither the one side nor the other. Sir WilHam Crookes has never\nchanged his views regarding Home's mediumship, nor did Sir Oliver\nLodge and the Continental observers alter theirs re Eusapia as a\nresult of the Cambridge exposure. After our Naples sittings, I\npersonally felt so far convinced that we had seen genuine phenomena\nthat I said to myself at the time :\n\" If Eusapia were caught cheating\nat every seance from now until she dies, I should still believe that\nwe had seen genuine phenomena !\nSince then, my faith has had ample opportunity to be tested\nto be tried to the full. For during the American seances (at the\nlater ones particularly) Eusapia was caught in trickery repeatedly\nand trickery of a character which renders it very evident that she\nhad practised it long, and had reached such a degree of adroitness\nin it that detection \u2014if not impossible to experts\u2014was at least\nextremelj^ difficult for any one not watching closely for the kind of\ntrickery practised. Prof. Miinsterberg alleged trickery at the seances\nattended by him ; Mr. Dorr's were, to him, evidently not conclusive ;.\nDr. Stanley L. Krebs stated, in his article in the Journal S.P.E.,\nthat he had witnessed constant fraud ; while it is highly probable\nthat practically the whole of the seances attended by Messrs.\nJastrow, Davis and Rinn were fraudulent from beginning to end.\nHow, then, does this afiect the past evidence 1 And how, I might\nperhaps be asked, does it affect my own point of view and belief\nin Eusapia's powers ?\nSpeaking personallj', I may say at once that I remain precisely\nwhere I was before these exposures took place. I admit her\ntrickery ; but then I bad always admitted it. And, in spite of\nthis, I feel more convinced than ever that genuine physical\nphenomena occur through Eusapia's mediumship ; that our obser-\nvations in Naples were not mistaken ; but that, on the contrary,\ngenuine phenomena were observed by us there too. Just as previous\nexperimenters have remained unaffected in their belief by later\nexposures, so I, too, must record my continued conviction in the\nreality of the majority of Eusapia's manifestations.\nAnd the reason is this : although Eusapia does, unfortunately;\n\fOct., 1910. Etvscipia Polladino ami Fraud. 371\ncheat whenever a chance is given her to do so, I have seen\nphenomena which no conceivable form of trickery could explain\ncertainly no form of trickery that has been discovered in the past.\nWhen I \" think back \" over the records, and remember certain\nindividual incidents that took place, either at Naples or in the\nAmerican series, I cannot help but think how wholly\u2014even\ngrotesquely\u2014inadequate any theory of trickerj' is, when applied to\nthese incidents. I do not base my faith upon dubious phenomena, but\nupon those M'hich, in my estimation, are unquestionable. It is\nhighlv probable that, had I attended the third, fourth, fifth, seventh,\neighth and tenth seances in Naples onhj, I should have gone away\nunconvinced of the reality of the facts. It is only a really good\nseance which finally convinces ; and nothing else will. Knowing\nthis, I said in the circular letter I sent to members, before Eusapia's\narrival in the U.S. :\nNOTES FOR SITTERS.\n\"It is important for all sitters to bear in mind the following\nfacts when attending seances with Eusapia Palladino :\n\" During the series, there will probably be good and bad sit-\ntings. While good sittings are convincing, bad sittings will possibly\nleave on the mind a suspicion that fraud may have been employed,\nand on the whole will probably be unconvincing. It is therefore\nessential to remember that if only one or two sittings are witnessed,'\nand these happen to be bad sittings, no fair conclusion can be\ndrawn until at least one good seance be witnessed.\"\nIn spite of this warning (based on experience), however, what do\nwe find? All the principal informants against Eusapia in\nAmerica have published their formal accusations of trickery after\none, or at most two, seances !\n^ The single exception is Mr. Dorr,\nwho had three.^ In this connection, I may remark that Mr. Dorr's\nattitude strikes me as all the more extraordinary because, at these\nsittings, both controllers (friends of Mr. Dorr) were convinced that\ntrickery had not been employed.\nAs to the seances attended by the group of scientific men at\nColumbia University, these were so poor that no other result could\nhave been expected ; the only wonder is that they had the patience\nto sit through four such sessions. To give an idea of the character of\nthese seances, I may mention the fact that hardly a single complete\nlevitation occurred in the best light ; and at some seances not a\nsingle levitation, even in semi-darkness ! It is small wonder, then,\nthat the conclusion reached was contrary to the claims of Eusapia\nit would be expecting too much of human nature to hope for any\nother verdict.\n^ Prof. Miinsterberg, two ; Prof. Jastrovv, one ; Dr. Krebs, two ; Messrs.\nDavis, Piinn, Kellogg, and Sargent, two ; etc.\n-The unfavourable report on Eusapia, published in Science of May 20th, 1910,\n(see Journal for July) which is referred to by Mr. Carringtou in the next para-\ngraph, states that eight of the authors of the report were present at three\nsittings, and several of them at a larger number ;\ne.g. Professor Dickinson Miller\nwas present at nine sittings. Ed.\n\fS72 Joiiomal of Society for Psychical Research. Oct., 1910.\nThose of us who believe in the possession by Eusapia of genuine\nsupernormal powers of a remarkable character, base our belief, not\non dubious phenomena (as I have said before), but on those in\nwhich there could have been no question of trickery of the ordinary\nkind. For myself, I remain convinced chiefl}' because of the fact\nthat I have repeatedl}' seen phenomena in light good enough to see\nthat Eusapia did not touch or approach the object moved, and that\nno thread or other material attachment existed, connecting her body\nand the table or the instrument played upon. These and these only\nare, to my mind, phenomena of a conclusive character ; and I base\nmy belief on none other. But when once convinced that genuine\nphenomena do occur under such conditions, is not one justified in\nbelieving that other manifestations, similar in appearance, are genuine\nalso, but that they happen in darkness too great to allow of the\nsame exact observation being made 1\nTaken all in all, I must contend that\u2014at the lowest estimate\u2014the\nevidence stands just where it was before. Much fraud has been\ndiscovered, it is true ; but there is some reason for this, and reason\nto think, also, that those who have \" exposed \" Eusapia were some-\nwhat too hasty and premature in their judgments. On the other\nhand, an enormous amount of fresh evidence has been collected,\ntending to show that these phenomena are genuine ; and this side\nof the controversy has not yet been presented to the public. When\nthis newer evidence is published (as it will be, I hope, very\nshortly), it will be found to present a far stronger case than has\nbeen imagined for the genuineness of these manifestations, and will\n.serve to indicate that, in spite of her petty trickery, Eusajjia is\npossessed of a remarkable power, capable of moving physical objects\nwithout contact, and of producing even more phenomenal occur-\nrences ; and that this power is exhibited only on certain occasions,\nand under certain conditions ;\nfailing which, Eusapia endeavours to\nproduce these phenomena, as best she can, by recourse to artful\nand at times skilful trickery.\nME.

H. Northcote. The\nreal names of the witnesses were sent to us in confidence,\nbut the names of persons and places printed here are\nassumed.\nMr. Northcote himself makes a preliminary statement as\nfollows :\nOdoler 29th, 1909.\nI am British chaplain in a small Continental town, having been\nhere nearly six years, while the Chelmsford family have been in\nresidence for about the same time. They are intimate friends of\nmyself and my family. They\u2014especially the father, Mr. Walter\nChelmsford\u2014are interested in psychic research. They are honourable\npeople, and their bona fides is beyond doubt.\nIn the winter of 1904-5 (or it might have been 1905-6) I was\nhaving a talk with the eldest daughter of the family, Miss Gladys\nChelmsford, now Mrs. Rupert Chelmsford, having since married her\ncousin. Miss Gladys Chelmsford suddenly asked me if I believed\nin ghosts ; and I returned a rather guarded answer, admitting the\npossibility of authentic apparitions. She then told me something\nabout having seen repeatedly the figure of a nun, when the family\nwere living in another European country some years before. She\nadded :\n\" And I see something at nights in our house here (Villa\nFinisterre). It is something black that comes into my room in the\nmiddle of the night and frightens me.\" She asked what I thought\nit was. I said :\n\" Perhaps you have had a bad dream, and have\ngot into the way of expecting it again : and so your nerves get\nhighly strung and sensitive, and you imagine, when you are half\nawake, that you see the thing again.\" I asked her if she was\nquite wide awake when this occurred (she spoke of it as occurring\nfrequently) ; and she maintained that that was so. I said something\nin the direction of discouraging her from thinking about the matter;\nand the subject dropped, and she did not refer to it again.\nI had almost forgotten the matter when, in the summer of 1908,\nmy wife came in one day from visiting the Chelmsfords. The\nfamily had a guest at that time, a young lady whom I call Miss\n\fNov., 1910. Cases. 375\nDenton, and who is now married to the eldest son, Mr. Herbert\nChehnsford. My wife said :\n\" Such a strange thing has happened\nat Villa Finisterre. Miss Denton declares she has seen an appari-\ntion. She saw it for several nights in succession, but wouldn't\nspeak of it, fearing that her own nerves were in disorder ; and\nthat this was the cause. One night Mrs. Chelmsford, who was\nstaying up late, heard Miss Denton cry out in a frightened voice :\n'Go away'; and then the affair came out.\"\nMy wife told me this; and there came into my mind what Miss\nGladys Chelmsford had said to me three or four years before. I\nvi^ent up to Villa Finisterre that day or the next, and asked the\nChelmsfords about the occiirrence. They gave the same account\nand then I saw Miss Denton and the room where she had had\nher experience. She said it happened in the small hours. She\nhad been asleep (I am not sure whether she had been asleep\nevery night or not), and then woke up and saw the apparition.\nShe seems to have distinguished it more clearly than Miss G.\nChelmsford had done. She said it was the figure of a tall man.\nIt used to come towards the bed ; then she would get frightened,\nand the figure would disappear in the direction of a cupl^oard in\nthe wall.\nI examined the room. The walls were boarded, and there is a\ngood space between the planking and the stone walls. The house\nis old. In company with two of Mr. Chelmsford's sons I examined\nthe cupboard where the figure was said to disappear ; and by forcing\ntwo boards asunder we managed to look into the empty space\nbetween the lining and the wall. Nothing was visible ; and as this\nwas mere guesswork on our part, we did not examine further.\nOur idea was that if the room was haunted, there might be\npapers or something hidden away which would explain the\nmystery.\nThe Chelmsfords gave Miss Denton the adjoining room ; and I\nthink she had a light in her room the next night. In those\ncircumstances she saw nothing; nor was the figure ever seen when\nthere was a light in the room. The following night, however,\nsleeping without a light, she did see the figure again. This time\nshe was not alarmed. There is, in the room she now occupied, a\ndoor communicating with the haunted room ; and the figure seemed\nto disappear through this door.\nSoon afterwards Miss Denton left, and I think the above-\nmentioned occasion was the last on which she saw the figure. I\n\f376 Jotirnal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.\nasked her particularly whether any one had told her beforehand\nabout anything strange having been seen in the room. She says\nnot ; and all the Chelmsford family say the same.\nNo explanation of the affair is as yet forthcoming. Mrs. Herbert\nChelmsford is now living in this place ; bat has never slept at Villa\nFinisterre since her strange experience. I have not heard that the\nfigure has been seen by any one during the whole of this year. I\nhave delayed writing about it, partly because I thought fresh evidence\nmight turn up.\nAlter writing this account, Mr. Northcote obtained first-\nhand statements from the various witnesses, as printed below\nFrom Mrs. Rupert Chelmsford {nee Miss Gladys Chelmsford).\nI am asked to relate the strange experiences I had in an old\nhouse my parents rented abroad.\n\u2022 It happened my bedroom was situated at the end of a long\npassage and was the end room of the house. It was small and very\nquaint, two of its walls were entirely panelled, and the other two\nonly half way, the unpanelled portion being covered with a yellow\nmaterial. The fireplace had been converted into a small cupboard,\nand in one corner of the room there was a large deep cupboard\non the outside wall, in the panelling. The room possessed two\ndoors, one leading into a small dressing-room, and then on to the\npassage ; the other was opposite the cupboard, and led into my\nfather's study. There was also a big window, between the cupboard\nand door, which I always kept open.\nIt was in the spring of 1905 that we took possession of the\nhouse, and the first night, being very tired, I went to bed early,\nand fell asleep at once ; the next thing I remember was suddenly\nsitting up in bed, with a sense of horror and fear upon me almost\nbeyond my control. I looked wildly round the room, which was\ndark, and to my terror saw, what I naturally took to be a burglar,\nquietly entering the room, by the door leading from the passage.\nI sat still for a minute, being quite unable to move ; the figure\ncame round to my bedside, after standing at the foot, then it\nseemed to fall on to its knees ; I wildly thought to hide under the\nbed; so I took a jump as far as possible out into the room, so as\nto miss him, and get help. On reaching the door, I looked back,\nand could see nothing, so I stood and watched awhile, as I was\nashamed to go and rouse the house for nothing, perhaps.\nDamp fear on my face began to cool, as I stood there, and\n\fNov., 1910. Cases. 377\ngrowing bold, as nothing happened, I crept over the bottom of my\nbed, to get at the candle, to light it. This I did, and all being\nquite silent I took a good look round. There was nothing to be\nseen, but the curious feeling of a strong presence with me in the\nroom. I felt I was being watched, and that the light was the only\nsafeguard between me and something horrible. I looked at my\nwatch : it was a quarter to 2. I got into bed, and sat there all\nstrained, listening and watching, painfully wide awake. The next\nroom clock struck 2, and suddenly I began to feel sleepy ; the\nstrain seemed to have snapped as it struck. I fell asleep, to wake\nnext morning with mj' candle burnt out beside me. Of course, I\ntried to put it all down to nightmare, and said nothing about it.\nBut the next night the same thing happened, and this time I\nwoke. I quite lost my head in the great terror the thing inspired;\nI ran down the passage to my parents' room. Of course nothing\nwas to be found, and it was put down, as is usual, to imagination or\nnightmare. However, every night at the same time I went through\nthe same thing, and saw this tall dark figure, unless I had a light,\nand even then strongly felt its presence until the hour of 2, when\na great peace seemed to fall over the night, and I got into the\nhabit of blowing my light out, and sleeping.\nFrom Mrs. Herbert Chelmsford {n^e Miss Denton).\nIn September, 1908, I went to stay with Mr. and Mrs. Chelms-\nford at Villa Finisterre. I was in good health and excellent spirits\nat the time, and had heard no mention of a ghost having been\nseen in the house. On the evening of the day of my arrival I\nwent to bed rather late and slept very badly, continually waking\nup with a most uncomfortable feeling, so much so that at last I\ncould endure the darkness no longer and lighted a candle, which I\nleft burning until daylight. I did not attach any importance to my\ndisturbed night, merely putting it down to being overtired and sleep-\ning in an unaccustomed bed. But the second night I slept no\nbetter, and towards 2 o'clock I was very startled by seeing an\nopaque mass of light at the foot of my bed. At first I thought it\nmust be light thrown from the window, but gradually I saw this\nmass of light taking form\u2014that of an extremely tall man (I should\nsay, about 6 ft. 2 in. in height), who, after standing quite still for\nwhat seemed a very long time to me\u2014though it was probably only\na few seconds\u2014moved across the room and seemed to disappear\nthrough a cupboard built into the wall. The third night the same\n\f37S Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.\nthing happened. By this time I was very alarmed, and the next\nday asked if a dog might sleep in my room, as I had heard\nnuises of mice in the room. My request was readily granted, and\nI went to my bedroom feeling rather happier.\nThe dog was tucked up in a rug in a comfortahle chair, and was\nsoon asleep; but about 2 o'clock he sat up, and turned round and\nround and whint-d. At the same time I saw my nocturnal visitor\nagain at the foot of my Ijed. I was so frightened that I called\nout, \"Go away.\" Mrs. Chelmsford, who was writing late in the next\nroom to my bedroom, heard me, and went to her husband and told\nhim she was afraid I was sleeping very badly, and suggested coming\ninto my room, but decided not to, as it might distuii) me. I did\nnot say anything about this to any one in the house at the time, as\nI was afraid it might only be my imagination playing me tricks, and\nI intended to endure it as long as I could ; but one night, about\nei.tjhteen days aftei' I had been there, the figure that came to my\nbedside was completely illuminated, resembling\u2014 more than anything\nelse I can think of\u2014tliose representations of people in fireworks, in\nwhich all the features of the face and the principal lines of the\nbody are outlined in light. After this I felt too alarmed to sleep\nin that room any longer, and the next day at breakfast I asked if\na ghost had' ever been seen there. I described what I had seen,\nand my description tallied with that of an apparition seen by both\nof Mr. and Mrs. Chelmsford's daughters. Needless to say I did\nnot sleep in that room again. Mrs. Clielmsford most kindly turned\na sitting-i'oom into a bedroom for me, as she said nothing had\nbeen seen in it; and I used this room, always keeping a light\nburning at night, and never seeing an} thing there until one night\nwhen (having received a letter V)y the last post with news which\ncompletely absorbed all my thoughts) I put out my light absent-\nminiledly and went to sleep, waking up sudden!}' to see the\nbrilliantly lighted figure of the man at my bedside. After that I\nalways kept a light burning at night, and never saw the vision\nagain.\nFrom Mrs. Clyde (ude Miss Dorothy Chelmsford).\nI slept alone in tlie big bedroom at the top of the house. The\nfirst night I slept there I had a dream that the room was haunted.\nLater on, I awt)ke one night with a great sense of fear. I sat up\nand looked all round me, and in the tar corner to the right of the\nwindow I saw a dark figure crouching, and, as I gazed at it, it\ngot up slowly and came towaids me. 1 was so terrified that I hid\n\fNov., 1910. Oases. 379\nmy face in the pillow. I felt it standing by my side, just as if it\nwere leaning over me and touching me on the shoulder. I lay like\nthat for some time, and then I lit my candle, and kept it alight\nfor the rest of the night. I couldn't clearly define the figure. It\nseemed to me a tall daik object. It might have been a very tall\nwoman or a man. The fact is, I was really too terrified to have\na good look at it. Well, after that night, for about a year I used\nto wake up nearly every night at a certain hour with a feeling\nthat there was something in my room, until it got so on my nerves\nthat I was made to sleep with a lighted lamp in my room all\nnight. Even then, sometimes, I would wake up with a feeling of\nfear, expecting something to happen, and in the far corner I would\nhear a low tap, tap, tap, for a few seconds, and then it would\nstop. So clear was it that the first time I heard it I thought it\nwas my mother tapping for me, as her room was under mine,\nand I ran down at once to see if she wanted me. She was\nsleeping.\nAbout two years later my sister came up to sleep in the same\nroom with me. I slejjt in the same bed I always had, Avhich had\nalways been in the room, and she had another bed that was brought\nup. Her bed was one side of the room, and mine the other. One\nnight I awoke, and I saw a dark tall object coming towards me. I\nthought it was my sister walking in her sleep, as she did so some-\ntimes, and I gave a shriek and hid my face in the bedclothes. Then\nI heard my sister's voice from her bed, asking me what was the\nmatter. I told her I thought she was walking towards me in her\nsleep ; but she had never moved from her bed, so it must have\nbeen the same apparition that I saw the fiist time, and it came\nfrom the same corner of the room.\nAs far as I can remember, there was no moonlight either of the\ntimes I saw the apparition ; there was only the light of a clear\nnight. I cannot remember the dates when I saw the apparition.\nEach time I woke suddenly from deep sleep with a great sense of\nfear, as if something was going to happen. I only saw the appari-\ntion twice, as I was married shortly after I saw it the second time\n.and left home ; but all the time I slept in that room, I felt at night\nas if there was something or some one there, which I could not\nsee. The tapping Sdund I heard more often. Sometimes I wouldn't\nhear it for two or three months, and then one night I would wake\nup feeling I was going to hear it again, and in the far corner I\nwould hear it tap, taj), tap, like some one tapping softly.\n\f380 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.\nFrom Mr. Herbert Chelmsford.\nDuring the month of August, 1908, whilst I was on a visit to\nmy parents at Villa Finisterre, I saw what I believe to have been\nan apparition. Owing to the house being full, I shared a large\nbedroom with one of my brothers, which was in the top storey.\nOne night I awoke suddenly, and, looking across the room, I\nsaw the cloaked figure of a man bending over my brother's bed. I\nthought at first this might be a dream, and kept opening and\nshutting my eyes to make sure. My brother's bed was situated\nbetween the cross lights of two windows, and this enabled me to\nmake out the outline of a figure fairly clearly. The time was\nbetween 2 and 3 a.m. I tried to call out to my brother, but was\nC[uite unable to do so. I did not feel in any way nervous, but merely\ncuriously excited. My brother suddenly awoke, and said \" Who's\nthat ?\n\" I tried to answer, but could not do so for at least ten\nseconds, and then I asked him what was the matter. Before my\nbrother spoke the figure had cjuite disappeared. On discussing it\nwith him, he said he thought he had been hit by some one on his\nside. We searched all round the room and found no sign of any\none or anything. My brother did not see the figure.\nThis is the only exjjerience of the sort I have had at Villa\nFinisterre or elsewhere.\nL. 1181. Apparition.\nThe following case of an apparition coinciding with a\ndream was sent to us by an Associate of the Society, Mr.\nJ. H. Clapham, of King's College, Cambridge, who wrote\nconcerning it\nSept. 1, 1910.\nIts main interest is that my appearance had no significance. I\nwas comfortably asleep in a Swiss inn. Fortunately my diary has\na note of the excellent night that I spent, and one of my com-\npanions can also witness to what I said about it at breakfast. We\ncan also get the note in Mrs. Nicholson's diary mentioned in the\nletter. . . .\nAlison is our little girl aged 2^. . . .\nJ. H.

Cases. 381\n55 Bateman Street,\nCambridge, Wednesday, Aug. 3, 1910.\nWhat were you doing this morning between 5 a.m. and 5.15?\nSuch a strange thing happened. To the best of ni}- belief I was\nawake, for I had just been putting some lotion on the restless [Alison]\nand heard 5 o'clock strike. I turned round to face the window,\nto try and get off to sleep, and there were you standing by the\nbed looking down on me. I said \" John, what are you doing licre ?\nbut you said nothing, and walking round the bed you bent over\nAlison's cot and looked at her, and she stirred restlessly in her\nsleep and said \"Daddy, Daddy, I can't 'member.\" Then you came\nround and looked at me again, and by that time I was terrified, for\nI thought something must have happened to you. I said \" What\nhave you come for 1 \" and tried to touch you, but you retreated\ntowards the window and disappeared. At that moment Alison woke\nand popped lier head over her cot. I gave her her biscuit and\nlooked at the clock ; it was 5.15. I comforted myself by reflecting\nthat you could hardly have begun to climb yet, but I haven't felt\ncomfortable all day. When Alison came into my bed, she said\n\"Daddy was mowing the grass when I waked up.\" I told her\nyou were away in Switzerland and not mowing the grass, but she-\nsaid \"I know he was mowing the grass, 'cause I seed him.\" And\nagain at breakfast, in the middle of demanding sugar, .she suddenly\nsaid \"I know Daddy was mowing, I seed him doing it when I\nwaked up.\" So if I was dreaming, she must also have been dreaming\nof you at the same time. I went up to Mrs. Nicholson after\nbreakfast and told her, and she is going to write it down in her\ndiary. . . .\nOu this letter Mr. Clapham had noted\nReceived Brieg\u2014Tues., Aug. 9, 1910.\u2014J. H. C.\nMr. Clapham sent us the diary that he was keeping in\nSwitzerland at the time to show his contemporary doings. From\nthis we extract the relevant entries as follows :\nSomething after 6.0 [p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 2] we came to\nGoschenen and put up . . . at the White Little Horse. . . .\nWed. Aug. 3. There was a furious rain overnight, but the\nmorning came fine, though not clear. . . . After an excellent night\nall were fresh and keen. . . .\nTues. Aug. 9. . . .

Nov., 1910.\nMrs. Nicholson, the lady whom Mrs. Clapham had told\nof her experience at the time, sent her the following state-\nment about it, which she forwarded to us :\n12 Harvey Road, Cambridge, Oct. 25, 1910.\nDear Mrs. Clapham,\nWith reference to your experience, I find this in my diary\nfor Wednesday, August 3 :\n\" Mrs. C. called ; she had '\nseen '\nher husband this morning, when she\nwaked, about 5. He came to the side of the bed, she tried to touch\nhim, and was about to say, '\nOh, you're coming to bed;' he then went\nto the side of Alison's cot, and bent over her. She tossed in her sleep\nand said, '\nI don't bemember, Daddy.' He returned again to the side\nof the bed ; Mrs. C. (I think) again tried to touch him. Then he went\nto the window, away. She found it was \\ past 5. Alison woke then,\nfor good ; and said later :\n'\nWhen I waked this morning Daddy was\nmowing the lawn.' Mrs. C. said: 'No; Daddy's in Switzerland.'\nMr. C. was to arrive at his destination in Switzerland last night; he\nwent there on Monday. She said : 'I've come to tell you, as ... if I\nfind that anything happened then, you'll l)ear witness.'\" . . .\nCecilia Nicholson.\nMrs. Clapham, in sending us this letter, writes:\n55 Bateman Street, Cambridge, Oct. 28, 1910.\n... I notice [Mrs. Nicholson] says I was about to say \" Oh, you're\ncoming to bed \" to my husband, which is incorrect, for, knowing him to\nbe away, it never occurred to me that he was coming to bed, only that\nhis party had broken up for some reason, and that he had come home\nunexpectedly. I believe I said :\n\" What lias brought you back 1 \" or\nsomething similar, but the exact words are in the letter I wrote to my\nhusband, which I believe you have. ... I have never seen any\napparition of my husband before. I was rather anxious aljout him this\nyear, as the weather conditions were unusually bad for climbing, and I\nknew, too, that his party were going guideless across country. . . .\nM.

My original letter, which T am copying,\nwas written on the 1.3th inst. . . .\nAs a boy I went to see my grandfather at P. very frequently ;\nhe died in '88, and amongst my lecoUections was an oblong\nwhitewood box with six grooved compartments on each side,\nin which I used to put various aiticles, and coloured sands,\nand to play with it generally. Many years later, I asked my\nsister what became of it. Slie told me it had never existed: it had\nbeen a dream. But it was the greatest reality I had.\nIn November of last year my old fiiend, Q,., and I were using\nthe planchette, at which he is remarkably adept. We asked what\nthe box signified. Tliere was another man present previous to our\nenquiring these lad details. The planchette then evolved a [a-etty\ntale of two Cornish friends, wlio were drowned and were animating\nthe instmment, and wou'd not work except through me. I enclose\nthe origirial records, as well as a copy of the answers j it stated\ntwelve periods of my life, as the meaning of the box. The\ntwelfth it WDuhl not reveal. It was to come in May of this\nyear ('May' was a conscious act of my will). It said I shotdd go\nto St. Valery, there meet my greatest friend, Count Louis de\nMericourt, engage with him in conversation on phihisophy and other\nthings, and disa|)i)ear and be swallowed up in tlie quicksands. And\nthroughout it i sisted on 'on tlie sands.'\nThis queer dream-cerebration I dismissed. It was the usual kind\nof thing, only better.\ni This year I had not intended to go anywhere, as I had no one\nto go with, and no inclination. A friend, H. T., suddenly offered\nto go to Brussels. We had settled on ever\\ thing, when the British\nSection was Imrnt down. Then we decided to go somewhere\u2014\ndid not care \"here; he suggested Dieppe, I agreed. We went to\nDieppe on Aug. 23. We got tired of Dieppe, and wanted to move\non to sometiiing smaller. He suggested St. Valery-en-Caux, I urged\nfeeble arguments, he in>^iste<l. We settled on Tues., Aug. 30th, to\nleave. All this while, 1, ot cour.-e, t-aid nothing ot the queer trend\nof events. That night a cyclist, iioing on to Boulogne, dined at\nthe hotel. He told me o\\ tiie ffyiug at Havre and altered my\nintentions.\n\f384 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., 1910.\nIn my room, I told T. I wanted to go to Havre, and then of\nthe strange forecasts connected with St. Valery. To my surprise\nhe was not sceptical, and, with some reluctance, told me that on\nthe sands he had had a waking vision, in which he had seen\nme and a bearded Frenchman (whom he described exactly) have\na struggle on the sands and disappear. He tried to intervene\nwith robust common sense, rushed after us ; but we had vanished.\nThe whole scene of the Plancheite had been telejiathed to him. He\nwoke up expecting to see me. I had hardly informed any one of\nthe forecast, and least of all him. He also said he was set^\npiqued, on going to St. Valery, and nothing but the flying, and my\nwish for it, would have deterred him.\nNext day we parted and did not meet again until the 13th Sept.\nin London.\nOn the 13th he called on me. He tells me he went to Fecamp,\nEtretat, and St. Valery. Despite the conformation of the coast^\nthere are quicksands at St. Valery, and nowhere else apparently\non that coast.\nI knew nothing of the place, had never been there or heard of\nit ;\nhaving maps of Normandy, I may have seen the name.\nM.

Gases.\nNovember (or late in October) last year. We were operating with\nthe \" planchette \" together. During the earlier part of the evening\na friend of yours (whose name I forget) was present, but I think\nhe had left before the answers referring to St. Valery and to\nyour future friendship with \"Louis de Mericourt \" occurred. The\nabstract of these answers which you send me corresponds exactly\nwith my own recollection.\nI may add, as far as I am concerned, that I had stayed myself\nat St. Valery-en-Caux some time before the evening in question, but\nhad no idea that there were any quicksands there. The name\nof \"Louis de Mericourt\" I am pretty confident I had never heard\nbefore. Q.\nlifh Sep., 1910.\nHaving been privileged to read your letter which sets out this\nextraordinary conjunction of anticipations and after-events connected\nwith our recent trip to Normandy I am able to confirm the relation\nof incidents, so far as I was a party to them.\nPressure of business prevents me giving, as I had intended, my\nown version of events ; but I feel this is now, in any case, un-\nnecessary, in view of your detailed narrative.\nH. T.\nIn reply to further questions from us, Mr. H. T. stated\ndefinitely that he had heard nothing of the planchette state-\nments before his experience and that he did not know Mr. Q.\npersonally ;\nand sent us later the following account of his\nrecollections of the whole matter\n\u202225fh Oct., 1910.\nI am glad to be of any assistance I can in a matter in which my\nfriend Mr. L. takes an interest, but incidents of the character\ndescribed in his letter to you make so little impression on me\nthat if it were not for his recalling them to my mind, I am afraid\nI should by now have forgotten all about them. You will readily\ngather from this fact of temperament with what hesitation I attempt\nany statement of the details of the incident in which I was con-\ncerned.\nOn, I think it was, the 30th August last, when sitting on the\nsands at Dieppe, I closed my eyes for a few minutes in the\nendeavour to get more complete rest by shutting out at the same\ntime visual impressions and mental perceptions of facts of any kind.\nAfter being a few minutes in this condition, I fancied I saw my\n\f386 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov.. 1910.\nfriend Mr. L., whom I. had shortly before left at the hotel, engaged\nin a tussle, whether friendly or not I could not distinguish, on the\nsands with a stranger whom I did not recognise. I roused myself\nto go towards them, and both disappeared as if through the sand.\nI thought no more of the illusion until late the same night when\nsomething led to Mr. L. telling me the story of the planchette\nof which I had not heard before. Upon this, I said that friend\nof his might have been the person I saw him struggling with as\nI sat half asleep on the sand. Fresh as the thing then was in\nmy mind, I replied to his queries in so far as I felt able to dis-\ntinguish between fact and illusion, and I have sufficient confidence\nin his powers of accurate retention and reproduction of facts to\nwarrant me in saying that his version of the matter is reliable.\nH. T.\nDOES EUSAPIA TRICK UNCONSCIOUSLY?\nThe Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research for\nAugust, 1910, contains a detailed and instructive report by\nMr. W. S. Davis of two sittings with Eusapia, held on\nApril l7th and 24th, 1910, at the house of Professor Lord,\nof Columbia University. Professor Jastrow's brief account of\nthese sittings was quoted in our Journal for July (pp. 335-342),\nand we would recommend those of our readers who are interested\nin the details of the case to study Mr. Davis's article.\nAnother of the sitters concerned in the exposure, Mr. James\nL. Kellogg, writes to us to supplement Mr. Davis's report as\nfollows :\nNew York, July \\5ih, 1910.\nHe discusses the question from the viewpoint of conscious\nimposture, whereas a number of students consider Eusapia a hysteric\nand an irresponsible person. We all consider her a conscious\ntrickster, for the following reasons : When she entered Professor\nLord's house from the street, she greeted us cordially, shook hands\nwith us, talked with us in a most sensible and businesslike way,\nthiough an interpreter, Mr. Livingston, and was in a perfectly\nnormal condition. I called her attention to a table we had which\nwas of approximately the same dimensions as her own, but which\nhad a top of one inch boards instead of one-half inch, as had the\n\fNov., 1910. Does Eusapia Trick Unconsciously ? 387\ntable she brought with her in the automobile. She took my hand\nand led me to her table, rapped it on the top and it resounded\nsomething like a drum. She then led me back to the table we had\noffered and rapped on this, showing that it had a much deader\nsound. This, and all the other things which she did, indicated\nthat she was exceedingly conscious and knew exactly what she was\ndoing. While in full possession of her mental faculties she took\nher seat at the seance table, and when we also were seated she\ndeliberately proceeded to secure certain reprehensible advantages\nwhich were to facilitate all the trickery which was to follow. She\nlaid her plans to deceive us within a very few minutes after she\nentered the house and before there were any pretensions of hysteria\nor trance. \"Jockeying\" for the foot substitution was one of the\nfirst things Eusapia did, and she certainly knew what she was doing\nit for. The \" phenomena \" which occurred later, when she was in\nthe so-called hysterical condition, were all dependent upon traps\nwhich she set shortly after she entered the house. Her preliminary\nmanoeuvring while in her normal condition not only required skill,\nbut she was cautious in making up her mind whether it would be\nsafe to proceed with the \"phenomena,\" as was shown by the way\nshe questioned us in order to discover whether we were likely to\nseriously interfere with her methods.\nThe production of \"phenomena\" ran on smoothly on the two\noccasions mentioned for over an hour without any indication of an\nabnormal condition, and not until after the lights were lowered did\nshe feign hysteria.\nHer table is built exclusively for trick purposes. The weight,\nlength, breadth, depth, etc., must be in accordance with her specifi-\ncations, and the whole thing is devised for the very tricks which\nshe performs. In fact, it would be rather ruinous to her perform-\nance to use a table of any other make, and this table is demanded\nby Eusapia when she is engaged and when she knows what she is\ndoing and when she is full of business shrewdness. Likewise the\ncurtains are demanded at the same time, and she certainly knows\nwhat she proposes to do with them.\nAgain, trance and hysteria usually constitute a part of the stock\nin trade of all physical mediums, and I see no reason why we\nshould assume genuineness in the case of Eusapia and only pre-\ntence in others.\nI purposely managed to feel Eusapia's wrist several times through-\nout the evening, and often could distinctly feel the pulse beat. I\n\f388 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Nov., i9io.\ncould not detect the slightest acceleration or nervousness on her\npart, and I doubt if there was a person in the room who had\ncooler nerves or was more self-possessed than the performer who\nwas entertaining us.\nAnother point is this : Those here who accept Eusapia, insist\nthat we should not have permitted her to perpetrate fraud, for we\ncould have obtained genuine phenomena had we demanded them.\nThe fact that we had another seance a week later, when we did\nnot allow her to perpetrate fraud, makes no impression upon their\nminds. Moreover, Prof Miller states that at seances previously\nattended by him he noticed that the volume of phenomena appeared\nto depend upon the amount of liberty which Eusapia was able to\nsecure, and that when she was held in check, manifestations pro-\nportionately lessened.\nI also want to make it clear that we did not deliberately invite\nfraud at the seance of April 17. We simply obeyed Eusapia and\naccepted the conditions imposed upon us. It .should also be noted\nthat at the second seance we were exceedingly gentle with the\nmedium, and made it a special point not to give her any excuse\nfor claiming that we were severe. All of the ladies and gentlemen\nin our party will testify that we merely replaced Eusapia's hand\nand foot whenever she undertook to secretly slip either away.\nOur seances were preceded by eight others, which were attended\nby Prof. Miller, and no evidence of anything supernormal was\nobtained, though a veiy great amount of evidence of imposture was\nsecured. In addition to these evidences of actual fraud, it was also\nclearly shown that as to her \"hysteria,\" she had a perfect know-\nledge of all that transpired while under its influence, and she seldom\nloses an opportunity to make every point count in her favor. . . .\nShe also makes careful preparation, as outlined above, for her\ntrickery when she is in her normal mental condition, even though\nthe phenomena may not be presented until her professed hysteria.\nIn view of all the facts, I think that Prof Jastrow's rather\nsevere article on Palladino in the American Review of Beviews for\nJuly, 1910, was entirely logical, and hence justifiable. . . .\nJ.

Arthur Smith, in the chair.\nThe President delivered a short Commemorative Address\nand papers were read by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick and Mr. W.\nM'DouGALL on Frank Podmore and William James, which\nwill be published later in full in the Proceedings.\nEXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TEANSFERENCE.\nIn this series of experiments the telepathic agent was Miss\nHermione Ramsden, an Associate of the Society, who has on\nseveral previous occasions taken part in similar experiments\n(see Proc. S.P.R. Vol. XXI. p. 60 and Jour. Vol. XIII. p. 243);\nthe percipient was Miss Tamara Statkowski, who is also an\nAssociate. Both agent and percipient were in England during\nthe whole course of the experiments, which extended from\nSeptember 8, 1908, to December 12, 1908. The method\nfollowed was the same as in the experiments made by Miss\nMiles and Miss Ramsden.^ The day was fixed but not the\nexact time. The percipient agreed to receive impressions at\n7 p.m., or later, should she be interrupted ; but the agent writes\nthat she was to \" send the message at any hour\u2014preferably in\nthe late afternoon\u2014when I happened to see something of\nsufficiently striking interest to impress inc. This we have always\nfound to be an important point.\" Both agent and percipient\nrecorded their- impressions on post-cards, which each sent to the\nother on the day of the experiment, and which are now in\nour possession. The date of these impressions is thus attested\nby the post-mark. On several occasions Miss Eamsden used\na picture post-card, and tried to convey the scene on it to Miss\nStatkowski, also recording on it any special points that struck\nher. Eleven experiments were made,, in six of which some\nsuccess was obtained.\nThe agent's original post-cards are marked throughout (a),\nthe percipient's (&) ;\nsubsequent comments by the agent are\nmarked (c).

Statkowski.\n{c) [Note by Miss Ramsden.]\nI arrived at Rushmore 6 p.m. [on Sept. 11th] and drove\nclose to this temple,^ when the thought crossed my mind\n' The temple, as shown in a print sent to us by Miss Ramsden, is round\nwith a domed roof supported on pillars and steps below. Between each of\nthe pillars is a \"low stumpy palm\" in a pot. In front of the temple is a\nstatue of the Emperor Augustus ; he is standing and holds a rod in his left\nhand ; his right hand is outstretched. His head is bare and he is wearing\na breast-plate. Ed.\n\fDec, 1910. Experiments in TlLought-Transference. 399\n\" that would be a good subject for telepathy. I will try it\nto-morrow!\"^ I saw the statue of the Eoman Emperor in\nthe distance, from behind, but did not notice it and did not\ndiscover the likeness to this [i.e. Miss Statkowski's] descrip-\ntion until the 13th. The garden here is square with a hedge\nround it, but I had spent the whole morning in a \" walled-in\nsquare garden with grass \" at Morton's House, Corfe Castle :\nthere was a little 2;irl aged six but she had no white kerchief\nor broom. At Rushraore there was a girl as described. The\nrest is wrong.\nIn this case it appears that in identifying the statue as a\nEoman Emperor, Miss Statkowski went beyond what was con-\nsciously known to Miss Eamsden at the time. The points\nupon which the description of the statue is correct are\n(1) The figure represents a Eoman Emperor.\n(2) It is \" a full figure in armour,\" i.e. wearing a breast\nplate.\n(3) The right arm is outstretched.\nThe description is incorrect in the following particulars\n(1) The statue is in the open, not in a niche or arch.\n(2) The Emperor holds a staff not a spear, in his left not\nhis right hand.\n(3) He has no wreath.\nSeveral of the other points noted by Miss Statkowski suggest\nconfused impressions of the two places visited by Miss Eamsden\non September 11th. The \"arched sort of cloister\" may have\nbeen suggested by the pillars of the temple.\nIt will be noticed that sometimes in these experiments, as\nin those of Miss Miles and Miss Eamsden, the impression\nreceived by the percipient, although in some way connected\nwith the agent, is not that which she endeavoured to transmit\n{vide, e.g. Experiment IV.). The series is not sufficiently long\nfor it to be possible to draw any conclusions as to the kind\nof impressions most easily transmitted. In some cases it seems\nto have been a visual image that was transferred and in some\nan idea.\n1 Miss Rainsden did not carry out this intention, but tried next day to\ntransfer a different impression.

Dec, i9io.\nA DISCUSSION OF CROSS-CORRESPONDENCES.i\n[To THE Editoii of THE Spectator.']\nSir, \u2014In a review of Mr. Podmore's book, The Newer S2nritualis7n,\nwhich, under the title \" The Progress of Psychical Research,\"\nappeared in your issue of October 15th, the writer speaks of \"the\nalmost universal assumption that cross-correspondences are among\nthe best evidence in support of\" the hypothesis that \"the spirit of\nFrederic Myers is communicating with us through various auto-\nmatists.\"\nSince he seems to regard only their form, I am not surprised that\nyour reviewer does not share this \"almost universal assumption.\"\nThe theory in regard to cross-correspondences to which he seems to\nbe alluding was first put forward in June, 1908 (S. P.R. Proceedings,\nPart LV.), by Miss Alice Johnson. She neither then nor subse-\nquently suggested that the form of cross-correspondences can supply\nevidence for identity ; nor has any other responsible member of\nthe Society for Psychical Research made the suggestion. Your\nreviewer later on remarks\n\" Even if such things [i.e. cross-correspondences of a complex type]\nwere common, might it not be argued that they would only prove\nthat some conscious being was producing them ; that they would\nscarcely prove that the conscious being was '\nin the spirit ; that\nthey would certainly not prove that he was the particular dead\nperson that he claimed to be ? A cross-correspondence is a possible\nproof of organisation, not of identity.\"\nNow, if the form only of cross-correspondences is taken into\naccount, I for one should be ready to answer your reviewer's three\nquestions in the affirmative, and to subscribe to his statement, though\nrather awkwardly expressed, that a cross-correspondence is not a\nproof of identity. The utmost that the fonn of a cross-correspondence\nof the complex type can do is to furnish evidence of design. It\ncannot reveal whose the design is. Nevertheless, the fact that the\nform of cross-correspondences can reveal design may have a bearing\non the evidence for survival. It has been urged against all the\nevidence for survival obtained before cross-correspondences began that\nit consists merely of facts once known to the individual of whose\nidentity proof is being sought, and that this kind of evidence, v\\^hile\nit may prove the survival of a nucleus of memories, cannot prove\n1 Re-printed fcom the Spectator of Nov. 5tli, 1910, by tlie kind permission\nof the Editor.\n\fDec, 1910.

But if\u2014which remains of course to be proved\n\u2014the complex cross-correspondences are the work of spirits, then\nthis objection is met; for the design exemplified in .them cannot\nproceed from a mere surviving nucleus of memories.\nThe strongest evidence of the older kind is to be found in the\n\u2022\"G.P.\" communications in Mrs. Piper's trance. \"G.P.\" confined\nhimself\u2014a few trifling exceptions apart\u2014to reciting past facts known\nto the real \"G.P.\" The \"spirits\" who call themselves Frederic\nMyers, Richard Hodgson, and so on, have not only communicated\npast facts known to the real men, but have improved on \"G.P.'s\"\nmethod by initiating and repeatedly eff'ecting complex cross-corre-\nspondences, the form of which suggests design, and accordingly active\nintelligence in the present. But though the form of the cross-\n\u2022correspondences may be evidence of an active intelligence, it afi'ords\nno evidence, positive or negative, of the identity of that intelligence.\nThis kind of evidence may, however, be aff'orded by the content of\ncross-correspondences, an element of them which your reviewer has\neither ignored or failed to observe. Negativelj^, the content, if it\n\u2022cannot prove, may render it highly probable that the mind which\n\u2022originated and gave it expression is not the mind of any one of the\nautomatists concerned in its production. I mean that if, for instance,\nthe subject-matter of the cross-correspondence, or the idea under-\nlying it, is unknown to all the automatists, it follows that not they,\nbut some other mind external to them must have originated it.\nPositively, the content of a series of cross-correspondences might\n-afford evidence (I do not sa}' \"proof\") of the identity of this\nexternal mind. How it might do so it would be impossible to explain\nwithout the limits of a letter. I can only cite as an illustrative hint\nthe way in which \" internal evidence \" has served to reveal the\nidentity of an anonymous or pseudonymous author, to confirm or\nconfute the claims of a reputed author, or to expose the pretensions\nof a forger. A series of complex cross-correspondences might, then,\nI maintain, by their form suggest design and present activity, and\nby their content identify their author. I cannot, therefore, agree\nwith your reviewer when he says that \" a cross-correspondence is a\npossible proof of organisation, not of identity\"; nor when he says\nthat \" all the experiments in cross-correspondence would seem to\nhave been irrelevant.\"\nI am not claiming that any of the cross-correspondences have\nfurnished proof of identity. (For one thing, I do not know, and\n\f402 Journal of Society for Psychical Research. Dec, i9io.\nno one does, what would constitute proof of identity. Your re-\nviewer's suggestion that before experimenting we ought first to\nhave decided this baffling problem strikes me as rather naive.) I\nam only claiming that they might afford fairly strong presumptive\nevidence of identity and of surviving active intelligence. As a\nmatter of fact, I do not believe that reasonable certainty will ever\nbe reached by trusting to any one line of experiment or observa-\ntion. Many different lines will have to be pursued, and satisfactory\nproof of survival will follow only if they all, or most of them, are\nfound to converge and lead to the same conclusion. \u2014I am, Sir, etc.\nJ. G. PiDDINGTON.\n[Our reviewer writes:\u2014\"I cannot think that my 'rather naive'\nsuggestion was entirely wasted, since it has extracted from Mr.\nPiddington this most interesting letter. I asked for a discussion\nas to what kind of evidence was valid in helping to establish any\nhypothesis that was put forward. Mr. Piddington's letter is an\nexample of just such a discussion. He points out one kind of evidence\nthat is valid in helping to establish the hyj^othesis that the spirit\nof Frederic Myers is communicating Avith us. But these arguments\nare capable of immense extension and elaboration ; and my point\nwas that they are likely to be of very great help to us in judging\nthe experiments that have already been made and in arranging those\nthat are to be made in the future.\" Ed. Spectator.]\nREVIEW.\nPsychotherapy. By Hugo Munsterberg, Professor of Psychology in\nHarvard University. T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1909. 401 pp.\n8s. 6d. net.\nThis is one of the rapid stream of volumes now pouring from the\npen of Dr. Munsterberg in which he seeks to popularise and to\napply the principles and results of modern psychology. It contains\nmuch sound and serviceable doctrine, but from the point of view of\n\" Psychical Research \" it is of little interest, for the author's attitude\ntowards all its problems is one of dogmatic negation. The events with\nwhich \"Psychical Research\" is concerned cannot happen, because they\nare incompatible with \"modern scientific psychology\"; and they are\nincompatible with it because \"modern scientific psychology\" is strictly\nmechanistic, and explains all mental process in terms of the mechanics\nof the brain.\n\fDkc, 1910. Bevievj.\nAll this dogmatism about \" modern scientific psj'chology \" is laid\ndown as universally accepted doctrine, whereas it depends on philo-\nsophical doctrines which are peculiar to Dr. Miinsterberg ; and we\nthink that in a popular work this should have been made clear. How\nunsatisfactory the author's conception of \"scientific psychology\" is, he\nhas himself abundantly demonstrated ; for, after showing in two large\nvolumes that, according to his conception of it, it can have no bearing\nwhatever upon the realities of human life, he has published a stream\nof books showing its bearings upon education, medicine, and the\nvarious great departments of human activity. It may therefore be\nhoped that Professor Miinsterberg will display the same inconsistency\nas regards \"Psychical Eesearch,\" and that at some future date the\nS.P.E. will be able to claim him as one of its brightest ornaments, \u2014\nhope which is further justified by the fact that he has already, with\nan amiable weakness, taken part in sittings with Eusapia Palladino.\nWhile that happy consummation still lies in the future, we may at\nleast congratulate Professor Miinsterberg on the fact that his\npsychological activity refuses to be confined within the narrow and\nsterile limits prescribed for \" modern scientific psychology \" by his\nepistemological reflections. -.y atiT)\nSUPPLEMEXTAEY LIBEAEY CATALOGUE.\nBooks added to the Library since the last list, Journal \/b\/- January, 1910.\n**Cauzons (Th. de), La Magie et la Sorcellerie en France, Vol. II.\nParis [n.d.]\n*Dallas (H.
